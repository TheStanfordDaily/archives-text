Much anticipated, the
Ram's Head Theatrical
Society's spring musical
production of "Into the Woods"
opens this weekend to kick off the
quarter with a lively story about all
of our favorite childhood charac
ters. Stephen Sondheim's musical

brings fabled figures like Jack and
his beanstalk, Cinderella and her
slipper and Rapunzel with her long
locks into one twisted fairytale
about family, romance and magic.
Running for around two hours, the
musical feels like an adult's adven
ture through childhood fairytales, a
dream from which we wake with
more understanding of human rela
tionships.
The story begins with a fun and

fast-paced opening number that
introduces us to the many different
characters and conflicts. A baker
and his wife bargain with a wicked
witch in order to have a baby, Little
Red Riding Hood braves the woods
to visit her grandmother, poor Jack
must sell his beloved yet useless cow
because his mother needs the
money and Cinderella needs to find
away to attend the ball. To fulfill
their specific goals, the characters
travel through the woods, causing
problems for one another along the
way. Every character builds a unique
relationship with the others, creat

ing a complex and ever-thickening
plot, yet the didactic tale has the
characters ultimately find common
ground in their struggles and pain,
uniting over motherhood and mar
riage, loss and love. The music, of
course, mimics the plot's poignant
complexity and emotional trajecto-

ry. Multiple characters sing at once,
with different songs that explain
their feelings and thoughts. The
ensemble took to the challenge of
Sondheim's layered music and its
renowned difficulty, and the vocal
talents of the cast truly shine in this
production.

I was very impressed by the
actors' vocal ability and musical
direction. Although the whole pro
duction seemed vocally flawless,

Laura Stampler 'lO, playing
Cinderella, Ken Kansky 'l2, playing
Jack, Braden Lake 'lO, as the Baker's
wife, and Mary Beth Corbett 'l2,
playing the witch, were particular
standouts. (Stampler has written for
The Daily.) The music of "Into the
Woods" is beautiful and demands
that the singer pay great attention
to detail because so many other
rhythms occur simultaneously.
Although the speed jumbles their
words at times, the singers showcase
their vocal abilities with confidence
and surely do Sondheim's songs jus
tice. The witch has some of the

most powerful and difficult songs of
the musical, and Corbett rises to the
challenge. I loved the "Stay With
Me" scene, in which the wicked
witch becomes a devoted mother,
desperately fearful of the harm the
woods may do to her daughter
Rapunzel. Here Corbett turns the
witch's insanity into sadness and
pain and presents her theatrical
ability in achieving the character's
emotional levels. James Everett 'l3
and Lake, as the Baker and his wife,
are also a highlight of show, espe
cially in their scenes of quarreling
and romance. Their conversations
of song flow very well, as their
words bounce back and forth in
perfect rhythm, so that they bicker
just as husband and wife would.
My only criticism would be of
the set. Using three pretty brick
rooftops and near leafless trees, the
set feels provincial, suggesting all
action is occurring in a quaint
town. I would have liked to go
deeper into the dark and mysterious
woods, although, the provinciality
does work for some scenes. The set
creates that essential fairytale feel
that draws the audience in to the
world of childhood fables, but with
more time (and perhaps more
money), I felt as though the set had
potential that remained untapped.
Ram's Head does a remarkable
job of bringing to life Sondheim's
twisted fantasy world. The group is
Stanford's oldest and largest com
pletely student-run theater organi
zation, and to know that everything
from lighting to costume design,
from blocking and scoring to make
up, is done by the students leaves
one in awe of the power of an
ensemble. Students from all aca
demic backgrounds, class years and
social circles work together to put
on this professional production.
Director Liz Stark 'l2 praised Ram's
Head, noting that its productions
allow students a uniquely social
experience, in which everyone
comes to know one another as
friends. (Stark is a staff writer for
The Daily.) This tight-knit commu
nity makes the Ram's Head produc
tion process one of collaboration
and personal growth, as students
participate for love of performance.
Their love of musical theater defi
nitely shines through in this show.
Ram's Head once again gives us a
fun and exciting Spring Musical
that will leave you skipping in song!
"Into the Woods" runs April 9-10
and 15-17 in Memorial Auditorium
at 8 p.m. Tickets are $lO for students
and $l5 for facidty and staff; $2O
general admission.
