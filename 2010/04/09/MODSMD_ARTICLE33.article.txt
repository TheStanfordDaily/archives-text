MGMT is an American
band, formed by Ben Goldwasser
and Andrew VanWyngarden, that
rose to both critical acclaim and
major commercial success after the

release of its debut album,
"Oracular Spectacular," in 2008.
The band provided something
new (or, better said, a refresh
ingly new take on old psychedel
ic, electro-rock) at a time when
the output from indie bands
seemed to be growing stale,
nothing but an emblem of hip
ster culture. MGMT did some
thing that too few other indie
groups have been able to do:
they experimented with music
in unexpected ways, creating
sounds that could be harsh and
pleasant to the ear at the same
moment. Yet despite all the
experimentation, they managed
to create songs that not only
appealed to hipsters, but to the
general public. Pop gems like
"Time to Pretend" and "Electric
Feel" had just the right amount
of synths and drums to create a
sound that was alien, yet recog
nizably human.
Their new album,
"Congratulations," which leaked

before the expected release date
(April 13) and can be heard at their
Web site http://whoismgmt.com, is
both a continuation of their work
in "Oracular Spectacular," and a
departure of sorts. One thing is for
sure you won't find any songs
with the mass appeal of "Time to

Pretend "or "Kids" on this album,
and that is not a bad thing at all. It
is a joy to have musicians who work
with music as their priority, instead
of commercial success.
The album consists of nine
songs, all bending sound in innova
tive ways, sometimes with success
and other times not so much. There

are moments in the album when an
arrangement of absolute genius is
followed by a flop, like a turn of
phrase not completely realized or a
joke without a punch line. The
album has a major case of
unreached potential. In other
words, it is inconsistent, and some

times aggravatingly so. And here
arises the main problem with
"Congratulations." Listening to the
album I couldn't help but think of
the painter who throws paint at the
canvas hoping that a masterpiece
will be result from the mess. I'm not
saying that MGMT doesn't have tal
ent, but they need someone to edit

their ideas. There are songs of
real beauty here that are encum
bered by too much sound, such
as the anthem "Someone's
Missing," which could have been
sublime had they remembered
that sometimes simplicity is
best.
Despite its inconsistencies,
the album is ambitious and fun,
becoming more coherent with
repeated listening. Lyrically,
MGMT continues their adept
use of nonsensical writing.
Songs like "Flash Delirium" are
completely incomprehensible
and anyone who says otherwise
is looking for meaning where
there is none. On occasion, how
ever, the absurdity of the words
creates a strange and elusive
atmosphere, hinting at a deeper
meaning (see "I Found a
Whistle"). Overall, the vocals in
the album are no more than
inconsequential complements to
the electronic soundscape in the

background, and this is completely
acceptable because the group is
aware of this fact.
There is one song that
stands above the rest: the 12-minute
long "Siberian Breaks" is the boldest
song they have ever produced. The
track is a sampling of mood pieces,


Photos courtesy Columbia/Sony Records
one that feels both epic and reas
sured. There's not a single false step,
the sounds perfectly in harmony
with one another, even when it
seem like they shouldn't be. It is an
exciting piece of music, full of twists
and turns. Just when it seems like
the song is winding down, it resur
rects with full intensity. It is pol
ished and rudimentary at the same
time. Here the juxtaposition of all
their influences seems like a confi
dent and sensible choice, rather
than a random pairing of musical

references as in "Flash Delirium." As
that song asks: "Hey people, what
does it mean?" What does it all
mean indeed? I'm not sure we are
supposed to know, but MGMT
doesn't know either.
Ultimately
"Congratulations" succeeds because
its triumphs more than make up for
its inconsistencies. However, the
band needs to refine their work if it
wants to remain relevant. They need
to find eloquence among their
musical chaos and know what they

are trying to say, even if the listeners
don't.
