# Nerd Heaven
##

I died and went to heaven this
past weekend not literally, of
course. No, this heaven is where
God is Darth Vader and the angels
include Sailor Moon, Cloud, the
Transformer Bumble Bee and
Batman.
This past weekend, I had the
great fortune of attending
Wonder Con, the largest comic con
vention behind the behemoth
Comic-Con of San Diego. Every
year, thousands of fans, ranging
from the dabblers to the I-own-the
first-edition-of-Batman #l, arrive in
San Francisco, salivating at the
thought of immersing themselves in

their dreams.
As my friend and I walked
through the convention center door,
we were greeted by a horde of
Storm Troopers and Jedi Knights
hustling through the halls in fairly
accurate costumes that must have
taken weeks to put together. Not far
behind, the Silk Spectre from
"Watchmen" graced the onlooking
male nerds with her skimpy uni
tard. Of course, Sailor Moon simply
couldn't be outdone, and her celes
tial presence affected both fanboys
and girls. And me? I was loving it.
The side I often hide was just
screaming with joy! People dressing

up as characters from my favorite
video games, anime, movies and
childhood cartoons? As I said, it was
heaven.
As we made our way down to
the show floor, some of the feebler
looking attendees were hurriedly
walking in the opposite direction.
No, it wasn't from the sunlight
entering the rooms it was much
better. Darth Vader was walking
toward us, and I couldn't help but
squeal when his voicebox kicked in.
I felt like I was on the Death Star,
preparing to I'm-your-father the
place up.
Entering the main hall, I real
ized having a dismal bank account
was possibly the best thing for me.
Comics, anime, action figures,
posters of every super hero you
could imagine, and, for once, I felt
like I wasn't alone in a crowded
room. Let me be honest here for a
moment I felt like a celebrity.

Simply grooming myself led me to
have the biggest self-confidence
boost ever, though I love my peers
and lauded their ability to embrace
their inner nerd by dressing up,
something I simply could not do.
Rows and rows of goods lay
before our eyes, and I was floored
that so many comics could fit into
one space. Some booths that caught
my attention: an exhibit flanked
with roman columns, housing 6
LCD TVs running the new Dante's
Inferno video game, a giant
Nickelodeon booth that brought me
back to some of my best memories
of childhood, an impressive Emily
the Strange booth that touched all
our dark sides and a towering con
traption that displayed every super
hero's signature mark on a T-Shirt.
Along with these elaborate booths
were smaller stations, catering to
the owners' personal hobbies. Every
one was unique and full of work

that you knew he or she put his
entire heart behind. It was rather
uplifting to know that so many peo
ple follow their personal dreams,
regardless of age, gender or back
ground.
The final part of our
Wonder Con experience was defi
nitely the most worthwhile. We
were funneled into a large banquet
room where segments of three
upcoming major motion pictures
were shown, each with select scenes
chosen specifically for us. The first,
"Prince of Persia: Sands of Time"
can be summed up in the following
statement Jake Gyllenhaal's fabu
lous muscles star in another adven
ture where he ironically gets the
beautiful woman, flashes his gor
geous smile and then achieves vic
tory against whatever enemy in a
stunning display of sand, swords
and over-the-top computer anima
tion. After the clips, Gyllenhaal sat
for a panel interview with the direc
tor, Mike Newell, and super-pro
ducer Jerry Bruckheimer. The
screaming was enough to deafen me
for the rest of the day.
After some lackluster clips of

"The Sorcerer's Apprentice" and a
panel with Jay Baruchel and Nicolas
Cage, the preview ended with "Toy
Story 3," and this wonderful piece of
animation easily made up for the
pieces of garbage that preceded it. I
felt like the giddy child who only
wishes he had awesome talking toys
like Woody, Buzz and the others we
have grown to love over the past
twelve years. I won't spoil anything,
but there's a cute unicorn with a
voice audiences will not expect.
While many of my friends
spent their Saturdays doing laundry
or staying inside, I was lucky
enough to experience a convention
that embraced comics, cartoons and
other geeky obsessions. Whether I
came out a Trekkie or with a love
for samurai swords is another ques
tion, but I do know it was amazing
to see so many people acting out
their dreams instead of spending
another day in earthly reality.
