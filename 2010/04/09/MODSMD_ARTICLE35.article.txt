Showcasing Stanford bands in
an epic battle for year-long
honor, supremacy and hot
ness, Battle of the Bands is an annu
al event put on by Phi Kappa Psi. In
my opinion, Battle of the Bands is
way under-attended it's one of
the few frat parties where you can
see multiple rock bands, and it has

vastly superior alcohol to most of
the parties thrown on this campus
as well (although I suppose that
might change if more people
attended, so perhaps I should dis
courage others from going). The
audience judges the competition,
which this year consisted of five
participating bands.
Ripcord opened with a "rock
ish" sound, which apparently means

that their lead singer sounds like a
choir boy. It was the opening for
what was a relatively homogenous
concert in terms of style, unlike last
year's Battle, which had a metal
band, a neo-punk all-girl ensemble
and a funk band complete with sev
eral saxes. This Battle of the Bands
looked a lot more like a compilation

of bands playing in my mental
image of coffee shops in Seattle ...
in other words, they were "indie."
The Offbeats, like Ripcord, were rel
atively mellow, but perhaps too
witty for their own good. They are
the kind of band you need to listen
to in your room so that you can
fully understand their lyrics, which
seem to be far more central to their
band than to the others.

The next band, Finding Jupiter,
probably would have won if not for
the fact that their lead singer, who

records beautifully and has a good
sense for song choice, has sadly

failed to learn how to rock a mike.
This, combined with technical
issues outside of their control, pret-

ty much kicked them out of the
competition their bassist, howev

er, was outstanding. Finding Jupiter
and the Offbeats had some of the
best vocals of the night. With
Finding Jupiter's microphone issues,
the Offbeats were clear winners in
this category.
The Sea People is the all-frosh
band that ultimately won the com-

Ed musicians (their guitarist is note
worthy), but the vocals are a bit
lacking in depth and soul. I was
actually surprised when they won
because, I think, talented musicians
notwithstanding, they seem a bit
confused. They sound like they each
wanted to play a different genre of
music and it was clear to me that

they were freshmen on that front.
Zen Finger Painting was the one
band that sounded a little more
"rock" in their recording, but they
are missing the kind of bass and
drums required to sound like what
they aim for.
Any musical flaws aside, this

event should be monstrously
attended. Great people, good alco
hol and awesome student music are
a recipe for an event that isn't so
much a battle, but rather an exhibi
tion of some truly incredible talent.
