# Remote Nomad: Redefining Science Fiction
##

Full disclosure: I know little
to nothing about science
fiction. American Girl dolls
indoctrinated me into a love of
historical fiction that I have not
been able to shake. I have seen
snippets of many programs

employed as examples in the text
below, but I am in no way an
expert. To any Trekkies, Heroes or
Galac-tites out there, I apologize
in advance.
Just as fiction catapults
its readers and viewers thousands
of years into the future, the televi
sion networks are forcing critics
and viewers out of their spring

comfort zones with discussion of
programming for the 2010-11
year. In a season where new pro
grams made a larger splash, good
and bad, than in recent memory,
the fates of many beloved net
work shows are in question. ABC
freshmen "Flash Forward" and "V"
and NBC's "Heroes," weighed
down by narrative dead ends and
lack of buzz in its fourth season,

are all on the chopping block.
Based on this roster and successes
such as "Lost," the genre of which
is in actuality merely "awesome,"
ABC seems to lead the way in pio
neering the science fiction form
for network television. Two weeks

ago, however, ABC chose to put a
"V" countdown clock in the lower
right hand corner of the screen
during "Lost," and you could say
it was the biggest disaster to hit
television since Janet Jackson at
the Superbowl. Fans felt manipu
lated and pigeonholed does
anyone actually think "V" is wor
thy of "Lost" fans?

All of this leads me to
my central question: how feasible
is science fiction as a television
program? In its extreme forms,
the genre already exists on the
margins of culture and society, in
part because of its highly academ
ic roots. Is it possible to make a
good science fiction show in the
populist, serialized network tele
vision format?

The most offensive
aspect of "V" has been its failure
to embrace the science fiction
form in favor of transparent
political commentary and sex.
Inherent to any good science fic
tion is a strong plot and writing,
not just sets and special effects.
"V" stands for the Visitors who
arrive on Earth, but have slowly
been taking over the planet over
the previous decades. In a year
when the film "District 9" was
nominated for an Academy
Award, the broad science fiction
stereotypes employed on "V" are
an offense to the incisive com
mentary of the aforementioned
film. I have found literally no
redeeming factors in "V" and
would be shocked if it were
renewed for the coming year.
While networks try to fill genres
and niches, science fiction is so
idiosyncratic and story-driven
that you can't just throw together
a science fiction show in the way
you can a sitcom (no offense to
the latter).
"Flash Forward" suffers
from the opposite problem the
premise of the pilot surprised
everyone in last fall's pilot season.
All the citizens of Earth "flash for
ward" six months ahead and catch
a glimpse of their lives in the
future, only to be jolted back to
the present to confront their new
found knowledge and ask
questions. The show centers on a
few characters and their individ
ual premonitions, one of which
includes death. This program suf
fered from a mid-season hiatus
that killed its buzz and a seeming
ly unplanned trajectory to span
the six months. Also, the most
important question is, where does
the show go after we hit the six
months? Another flash forward?
Back to the future? In this exam
ple, the fast-paced structure of
television seasons hurts the con
clusion-centered structure of sci
ence fiction.
And then there's
"Heroes," which lost its way long,
long ago. It's unfortunate that the
series, which was on fire in its first
season, will probably end so dis
appointingly. Again, television
writers are at the mercy of net
work schedules. They do not pitch
projects and demand a certain
number of seasons to fit the nar

rative; they keep going like the
Energizer bunny until the net
works take the drum away.
The question of science
fiction on TV seems particularly
important, given recent develop
ments. For one, SciFi rebranded

itself as SyFy to appear softer to
mass audiences. It followed up the
illogical new name with a spinoff,
"Caprica," of the wildly successful
"Battlestar Galactica." Despite
these efforts, SyFy is floundering
in all areas except reruns. The
recent commercial failures, fresh
wounds for his groupies, of Joss
Whedon's "Firefly" and

"Dollhouse" suggest that audi
ences don't want to stretch their
brains to alternate universes when
they watch TV. And then there's
the elephant in the room, 3-D tel
evisions. Thanks to the film
"Avatar," soon enough Americans
will be watching their nightly
news and "Modern Family" with
3-D glasses taped to their faces. To
revel in this technological

advancement of sorts, television
will have to push the limits of
content and budget toward genres
such as science fiction. I simply
don't think audiences are ready
for it.
Isn't television in and of

itself a kind of science fiction?
The fictions that have been the
lifeblood of American culture
have been channeled through the
science and technology of the tel
evision for more than half a cen
tury now, but we're still grappling
with how to make that harmo
nious on the screen itself.
