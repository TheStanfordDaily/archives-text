# SLIPPERY SLOPE
## Cardinal will try to halt three-game skid 
### DANIEL BOHM SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The No. 22 Stanford baseball team (13-11,
3-3 Pac-10) continued its struggles Wednes
day, falling to visiting Saint Mary's 7-3 at
Sunken Diamond.

The Cardinal has now lost five of its last
six after a promising start to the season.
The same problems that have haunted the
Cardinal all season wild pitching and a
lack of clutch hitting came into play
Wednesday.

Stanford outhit the visiting Gaels eight to
five, but Cardinal pitchers issued seven free
passes (and hit a batter) and Saint Mary's
capitalized on the miscues.

The Cardinal jumped out to an early 2-0
lead in the bottom of the second on a pair of
RBI singles by freshman third baseman
Kenny Diekroeger and junior shortstop Jake
Schlander.

The lead was short lived, however, as the
Gaels pushed across five runs on only one
hit in the top of the third.
Freshman pitcher Garrett Hughes, who
came on in the second inning, suddenly lost
his control in the third, walking four batters
and leaving with two outs and the bases
loaded with a run already in. Another fresh
man reliever, Dean McArdle, came on and
was greeted rudely by Gaels' third baseman
Patrick Wisdom, who crushed a grand slam.

It would be the first of two home runs on
the day for Wisdom he added a two-run
shot in the top of the sixth off the otherwise
effective junior Danny Sandbrink.
Hughes (0-1) took the loss for Stanford.

NOTES ! Stanford has lost its last three games
and five of its last six, including losing a con
ference series to UCLA. The team will look to
get back on track this weekend as it opens its
third Pac-10 series of the season. The Cardi
nal will face one of the Pac-10's weaker pro
grams Oregon has fielded a Division-I
baseball team only for two seasons and is 2-
4 in conference play this year. Stanford will
probably send sophomore pitcher Brian Bu
sick to the mound on Friday.

After a strong start to the season, Stanford has weakened considerably. It has lost three straight games and
five of its last six. Cardinal pitchers have also had control issues, with walks becoming a key feature of games.

Junior outfielder Dave Giuliani
believes that Stanford's hitters need
to do a better job of focusing, regard
less of how their pitcher is throwing.
"The only thing you have to worry
about with the walks is not losing
concentration and intensity," Giu
liani said. "I think we've been doing
that the last few games, and it trans
lates into bad at-bats."

The Cardinal squandered a few
chances to get back in Wednesday's
game. In the bottom of the sixth, trail
ing 7-2, sophomore designated hitter
Christian Griffiths bounced into a
double play with the bases loaded
and one out, ending a potential rally.
An inning later, Schlander was
stranded at second after he doubled
with nobody out to score
Diekroeger. The Cardinal also left
two on in the bottom of the eighth.
Schlander says that the team un
derstands its weaknesses and is
working to correct them.
"We need to play better as an en
tire team," he said. "We have to cut
down on the walks, get timely hits at
the plate and have better at-bats."
Although the Cardinal appears to
be sputtering, the game did not come
without its bright spots.
Sophomore pitcher Brett

Mooneyham, who started the game,
has struggled immensely with his
control this season he has walked
32 batters in 26.1 innings. Although
he went just an inning, he looked
sharp in retiring the Gaels in order.
It is unclear whether Mooney
ham, who has been in the weekend
rotation all season, will make his
scheduled start this Sunday versus
Oregon. The fact that he went just an
inning yesterday appears to indicate
that head coach Mark Marquess is
likely to stick with his hard-throwing
lefty.

The Cardinal needs to get out of
its recent slide this weekend when it
hosts the Ducks for a three game Pa
cific-10 Conference series.

"This is an opportunity to turn it
all around and get back on track,"
Schlander said. "We could use a good
Pac-10 series win to jump start the
team again."
Oregon, which is only in its second
season playing Division I baseball, is
a surprising 19-10 on the year under
head coach George Horton. The
Ducks won a series earlier in the sea
son against perennial powerhouse
and former employer of Horton
Cal State Fullerton, and also handed
Arizona State its first loss of the sea
son last weekend.
The Ducks boast four solid
starters and are expected to use a ro
tation of sophomore left-hander
Tyler Anderson on Friday, senior
right-hander Zack Thornton on Sat

urday and sophomore right-hander
Alex Keudell on Sunday. All three
boast sub-4.00 ERAs and have excel
lent control.

Although Stanford's rotation is
not set yet, Marquess is likely to send
sophomore Brian Busick to the
mound on Friday for the second con
secutive week. On Saturday the Car
dinal's most consistent pitcher this
season, sophomore Jordan Pries, is
likely to take the ball, and it appears
Mooneyham will go on Sunday.
Marquess will likely continue to
juggle his lineup as he has all sea
son â€” until he finds a combination
that will consistently produce runs.
Recently he has been using freshman
outfielder Tyler Gaffney in the lead
off spot and junior catcher Zach
Jones in the two-hole, providing a lot
of speed at the top of the lineup.
Gaffney, who is hitting .317 on the
season, has provided a spark with his
hustle and ability to find his way on
base, while Jones leads the team with
four home runs.
This is a critical series for the Car
dinal, which currently sits in a tie for
fifth in the Pac-10 at 3-3. Oregon, on
the other hand, is in a four-way tie for
seventh in the conference at 2-4.

Tonight's first pitch will be at 5:30
p.m. at Sunken Diamond. Saturday's
will be at 1 p.m. and Sunday's will be
at 12 p.m.
