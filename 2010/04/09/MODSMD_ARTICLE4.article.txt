# SLIPPERY SLOPE
## Cardinal will try to halt three-game skid 
### DANIEL BOHM SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The No. 22 Stanford baseball team (13-11,
3-3 Pac-10) continued its struggles Wednes
day, falling to visiting Saint Mary's 7-3 at
Sunken Diamond.

The Cardinal has now lost five of its last
six after a promising start to the season.
The same problems that have haunted the
Cardinal all season wild pitching and a
lack of clutch hitting came into play
Wednesday.

Stanford outhit the visiting Gaels eight to
five, but Cardinal pitchers issued seven free
passes (and hit a batter) and Saint Mary's
capitalized on the miscues.

The Cardinal jumped out to an early 2-0
lead in the bottom of the second on a pair of
RBI singles by freshman third baseman
Kenny Diekroeger and junior shortstop Jake
Schlander.

The lead was short lived, however, as the
Gaels pushed across five runs on only one
hit in the top of the third.
Freshman pitcher Garrett Hughes, who
came on in the second inning, suddenly lost
his control in the third, walking four batters
and leaving with two outs and the bases
loaded with a run already in. Another fresh
man reliever, Dean McArdle, came on and
was greeted rudely by Gaels' third baseman
Patrick Wisdom, who crushed a grand slam.

It would be the first of two home runs on
the day for Wisdom he added a two-run
shot in the top of the sixth off the otherwise
effective junior Danny Sandbrink.
Hughes (0-1) took the loss for Stanford.

NOTES ! Stanford has lost its last three games
and five of its last six, including losing a con
ference series to UCLA. The team will look to
get back on track this weekend as it opens its
third Pac-10 series of the season. The Cardi
nal will face one of the Pac-10's weaker pro
grams Oregon has fielded a Division-I
baseball team only for two seasons and is 2-
4 in conference play this year. Stanford will
probably send sophomore pitcher Brian Bu
sick to the mound on Friday.

After a strong start to the season, Stanford has weakened considerably. It has lost three straight games and
five of its last six. Cardinal pitchers have also had control issues, with walks becoming a key feature of games.
