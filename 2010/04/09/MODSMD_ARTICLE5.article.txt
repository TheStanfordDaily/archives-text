# WOMEN'S GYMNASTICS
## VAULTING TO A CHAMPIONSHIP 
### LAUREN TAYLOR STAFF WRITER 
Nearing the end of its long sea
son, the Stanford women's gymnas
tics team heads to West Virginia this
weekend to compete against five
other teams ranked No. 31 or better
in the NCAA Southeast Regional

Finals. The No. 6 Cardinal (19-3) are
seeded No. 1 in the Morgantown
Regional and will face (in order of
seeds) Michigan, Southern Utah,
North Carolina State, Kent State
and West Virginia to contend for a
berth at the National Champi
onships in Gainesville, Fla. on April
22-24.

The top two teams from the re
gion will qualify, which Stanford has
done the past three years, as well as
seven of the past nine. In fact, the
Card has appeared in the NCAA
Regionals for 27 consecutive sea
sons, and the team hopes to use its
extensive experience and its posi
tion as a No. 1 seed to claim a berth

at nationals.
However, Stanford was barely
able to take the No. 1 regional spot,
as the team is tied with Michigan
(19-3) at No. 6 in the national rank
ings and only edged the Wolverines
because of an overall score
tiebreaker. Michigan is expected to
be the Cardinal's most difficult com

petition in the meet, and the two
teams have not faced each other so
far this season.
Last year, Stanford helped knock
Michigan out of the NCAA Cham
pionships when the Cardinal fin
ished 0.700 ahead of the Wolverines
