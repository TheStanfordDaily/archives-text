# WOMEN'S GYMNASTICS
## VAULTING TO A CHAMPIONSHIP 
### LAUREN TAYLOR STAFF WRITER 
Nearing the end of its long sea
son, the Stanford women's gymnas
tics team heads to West Virginia this
weekend to compete against five
other teams ranked No. 31 or better
in the NCAA Southeast Regional

Finals. The No. 6 Cardinal (19-3) are
seeded No. 1 in the Morgantown
Regional and will face (in order of
seeds) Michigan, Southern Utah,
North Carolina State, Kent State
and West Virginia to contend for a
berth at the National Champi
onships in Gainesville, Fla. on April
22-24.

The top two teams from the re
gion will qualify, which Stanford has
done the past three years, as well as
seven of the past nine. In fact, the
Card has appeared in the NCAA
Regionals for 27 consecutive sea
sons, and the team hopes to use its
extensive experience and its posi
tion as a No. 1 seed to claim a berth

at nationals.
However, Stanford was barely
able to take the No. 1 regional spot,
as the team is tied with Michigan
(19-3) at No. 6 in the national rank
ings and only edged the Wolverines
because of an overall score
tiebreaker. Michigan is expected to
be the Cardinal's most difficult com

petition in the meet, and the two
teams have not faced each other so
far this season.
Last year, Stanford helped knock
Michigan out of the NCAA Cham
pionships when the Cardinal fin
ished 0.700 ahead of the Wolverines
for second place in the regional com
petition.

Though the Cardinal has not yet
seen any of the other five teams in its
region this year, the team remains
confident in its preparation. This is
primarily because of its success in last
weekend's Pac-10 Championship, in
which Stanford finished second be
hind No. 3 UCLA, 197.350-196.550.
"We fought really well and did a
great job covering for one another,"
said head coach Kristen Smyth. "But
we didn't hit every routine, and that is
keeping us hungry as we head in to
this weekend. The girls are fresh, en
ergized and excited Pac-lOs went
well, but we want more."
The team's rotation will include a
bye, followed by floor, vault, another
bye, uneven bars and finally the bal
ance beam. This is the exact same se
quence of events as last year's region
al, and the past week has been dedi
cated to honing the team's skills and
mental readiness.
"We have backed off on the con
ditioning and done more game-days
to really get a grip on the competi
tion," Smythe said. "We've been lim
iting our numbers and trying to get a
good body-feel and plenty of confi
dence.
Senior captain Carly Janiga also
expects the past week of especially
strong practices to carry the team
through the competition.
"We have had some really great
workouts, which bodes well for us be
cause we tend to play like we prac
tice," she said. "This should eliminate
some of our nervous energy, and it
makes us excited to go in to competi
tion because we know we have our
practices to back us up.That hasn't al
ways been there, and we've had to
rely on other factors to give us confi
dence."
Smyth expects Janiga, the Pac-10
Floor Champion, to be a crucial con
tributor to the Card's success. She is
also looking forward to having junior
Shelley Alexander return to the rota
tion after a shoulder injury. Alexan
der has consistently been one of the
team's top performers on the vault.

and Smyth is excited to have her
scores back in the mix.
With one more day of practice be
fore the competition begins on Satur
day, the team plans to put its final
touches on the routines and prepare
to put together its best performances

of the season, which Smyth says are
"yet to come."
Events will begin at 6 p.m. on Sat
urday.

weekend. It will hold the top seed in its regional tournament by a knife's
edge over Michigan, which is tied with the Cardinal in the national rankings.
