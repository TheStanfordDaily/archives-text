# TOUGH TESTS

### CHRIS JUHNKE DESK EDITOR 
The No. 1 Stanford men's volleyball team will host its last
home matches of the regular season this weekend, facing some
of its toughest competition in No. 3 Pepperdine and No. 6 USC.
The Cardinal (16-5,13-5 MPSF) is seeking to clinch first
round home-court advantage with wins over the Waves (14-7,
12-6) and Trojans (13-9,10-8). Along with Pepperdine, Stan
ford is the only team that controls its own destiny for the
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation (MPSF) tournament's
No. 1 seed.
"Friday's match is crucial," said sophomore outside hitter
Brad Lawson. "With the top five teams in the league separat
ed by no more than a game or two, every win from here on out
is going to count big time.
Junior outside hitter Spencer McLachlin agreed.
"Not only will [the matches] have a big impact on our seed
ing for the conference tournament, but we also want to send
our seniors out with a couple of big wins," he said. The team's
Senior Night is this Saturday.
Those seniors include Ail-American setter Kawika Shoji
and Stanford's career kills record holder, opposite Evan
Romero.
"These matches are extremely important," Shoji said. "Not
only are they absolutely critical when it comes to the MPSF
standings, but they are also a celebration of the work that the
senior class has done the past four years."
