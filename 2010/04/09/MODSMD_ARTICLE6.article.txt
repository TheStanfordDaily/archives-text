# TOUGH TESTS
## 
### CHRIS JUHNKE DESK EDITOR 
The No. 1 Stanford men's volleyball team will host its last
home matches of the regular season this weekend, facing some
of its toughest competition in No. 3 Pepperdine and No. 6 USC.
The Cardinal (16-5,13-5 MPSF) is seeking to clinch first
round home-court advantage with wins over the Waves (14-7,
12-6) and Trojans (13-9,10-8). Along with Pepperdine, Stan
ford is the only team that controls its own destiny for the
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation (MPSF) tournament's
No. 1 seed.
"Friday's match is crucial," said sophomore outside hitter
Brad Lawson. "With the top five teams in the league separat
ed by no more than a game or two, every win from here on out
is going to count big time.
Junior outside hitter Spencer McLachlin agreed.
"Not only will [the matches] have a big impact on our seed
ing for the conference tournament, but we also want to send
our seniors out with a couple of big wins," he said. The team's
Senior Night is this Saturday.
Those seniors include Ail-American setter Kawika Shoji
and Stanford's career kills record holder, opposite Evan
Romero.
"These matches are extremely important," Shoji said. "Not
only are they absolutely critical when it comes to the MPSF
standings, but they are also a celebration of the work that the
senior class has done the past four years."

NOTES ! With only four conference games
remaining, the Stanford volleyball team
will win the first seed in the MPSF Tourna
ment if it wins out. The Cardinal's main
competition will be from No. 3 Pepper
dine, which is currently fourth in the con
ference. In the two teams' previous meet
ing in Malibu, Pepperdine defeated Stan
ford 3-0. This weekend's meeting be

tween Stanford and USC is also the sec
ond between the two teams. Stanford
took the first match, 3-1.

Senior setter Kawika Shoji (above) will be a key part of Stanford's run at the top seed in the
MPSF playoffs. Shoji will play the last regular-season home matches of his career this weekend.


Other Stanford seniors playing
their last regular-season match at
home on Saturday include outside hit
ters Ed Howell and Jason Palacios and
middle blocker Garrett Werner.

To ensure that the Card gets these
much-needed wins, the team has been
working hard in practice. The players
know that neither of these matches
will be easy, having lost to Pepperdine
before taking a grueling four-set win
from USC when the teams played ear
lier in the season.

All of the Cardinal players empha
sized that excellent defense would be
necessary to beat a Pepperdine of
fense that doesn't commit a lot of er
rors. Pepperdine also utilizes a very
balanced attack, with four players av
eraging over two kills per set and two
more hovering just under two.
"We have been tightening our
block and defense," Shoji said. "We
need to score points with our defense
during this crucial weekend."
"With such a wide range of options
on the attack, it's going to be important
that we slow down Pepperdine's of
fensive game by blocking, digging and
turning points on our serve," Lawson
added.

Against the Trojans, the Cardinal
will face a less-balanced attack cen
tered on USC's two stars, junior out
side hitter Murphy Troy and sopho
more outside hitter Tony Ciarelli. Both
players average around four kills per
set, with Troy leading the team at 4.48.
The Trojans need one more win in
their last four matches to reach the
MPSF Tournament, and they will like
ly be looking to improve their seeding
with a win over Stanford.

However, while the opponents in
the MPSF are tough, Stanford has
grown as a team over the year, seem
ingly peaking at the perfect time it
has won nine of its last 10.

"Two things that I see in our team
are confidence and poise," Lawson
said. "Throughout the season, we
seemed to trust more and more in our
ability to play consistent, high-level
volleyball, but stay calm and relaxed
when another team brought its A
game and challenged us to side-out or
score a big point in a close game. I
think these traits have enabled us to
win close matches and outlast our op
ponents down the stretch."

This weekend, the Cardinal will
look to gain a little breathing room in
the conference standings, looking for
ward to the MPSF and NCAA Tour
naments, while also looking back into
the past to celebrate the careers of the
team's seniors.

"If we can get two wins at home
this weekend, we'll be that much clos
er to a No. 1 finish in the MPSF regu
lar season and an NCAA playoff

berth," Lawson said. "These matches
are also important because they are

the last two regular season games that
our seniors will play at home and in
that sense they have a special mean
ing for both our seniors and our team
in general."
The match against Pepperdine
starts at 7 p.m. tonight. Senior night is
on Saturday against USC at 7 p.m.
Both matches will be played in Maples
Pavilion.
