## SPEAKERS & EVENTS Nobel laureate Ostrom discusses social ecology 
### AN LE NGUYEN DESK EDITOR 
Nobel laureate Elinor Ostrom spoke at a
packed Annenberg Auditorium on Thursday
about social ecology systems, focusing on the
theoretical framework behind cooperation in
the commons.
Ostrom, who shared the 2009 Nobel Prize
in Economic Sciences with Oliver E.
Williamson, was the first woman to win in that
category.
Throughout the lecture, Ostrom assessed
how "social and ecological systems interact"
and when they prove to be "resilient." This
topic of study, she argued, has been complicat
ed by the fact "that social systems have im
mense variety."

Ostrom said having an understanding of
these systems yields important implications
when scholars study lakes, forests, fisheries and
other "commons."
"Our argument is that our social, ecological
systems are structured by multiple variables
that affect the patterns of outcomes over time
and that we need to be better developing our
diagnostic skills," Ostrom said.
But accomplishing this goal, she warned, is
not an easy feat.
In fact, there have been hotly contested de
bates over the theoretical groundwork of the
commons. The conventional theory of collec
tive action has assumed that individuals maxi
mize short-term material benefits for them
selves. Ecologist Garrett Hardin became
known for his work on the tragedy of the com

mons theory, which maintains that self-inter
ested individuals are trapped in a non-cooper
ative state and will deplete the resources with
in their commons.
Ostrom was one of the first scholars to chal
lenge this widely accepted theory.
To escape from the tragedy of the com
mons, individuals "have to impose rules from
the outside," Ostrom said.
The implementation of socially optimal
rules will lead to a beneficial outcome; the
problem, however, is that individuals do not al
ways follow this path.
"The theory says that it's possible [but] we
find that in many cases that it isn't supported,"
Ostrom said.
"[Empirically] you find a very large num
ber of factors that appear to be affecting

whether or not people succeed," she added.
Ostrom cited a host of factors that encour
age cooperation among individuals; she high
lighted learning norms and building trust as es
pecially significant features. Ostrom conclud
ed that academics "have to examine how the
micro situation affects trust and reciprocity."
Ostrom's lecture resonated strongly with
international relations major Lacey Dorn 'll.
"It's an intersection of my interests
ethics and the environment," Dorn said. "And
I really admire Elinor Ostrom for being the
first female winner of the Nobel Prize in Eco
nomics."
Given her avid interest in the environment,
Dorn jumped at the opportunity to attend an
event co-sponsored by the Woods Institute
and the economics department.

"I thought that her interest in community
members' ability to learn has a really inspiring
implication for environmental scientists to
continue to research and educate the global
commons," Dorn added.
Dorn's high praise of Ostrom was echoed
by philosophy professor Debra Satz, who in
troduced the visiting speaker as a "pioneer and
path-breaker" during the beginning of the talk.
In 2009, Ostrom became the first woman to
receive a Nobel Prize in Economics for her
work on the commons. She currently serves as
the Arthur E Bentley Professor of Political Sci
ence at Indiana University and is the author of
a large volume of papers and books.
