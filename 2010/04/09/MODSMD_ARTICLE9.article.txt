## ASSU voting underway 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Elizabeth Titus 
Shortly after 9 p.m. Thursday, 3,638
students had cast votes in the ASSU
election; polls remain open until 11:59
p.m. Friday. Voters are deciding next
year's ASSU president and vice presi
dent, undergraduate senators, Gradu
ate Student Council members, special
fees recipients and class presidents.
Results are set to be announced on
Saturday at 5 p.m. at the CoHo.
A brief endorsement scuffle arose
on Wednesday when The Stanford
Review reported that the Green Al
liance for Innovative Action had
dropped its endorsements of Senate
candidates Rebecca Sachs 'l3 and
Carolyn Simmons 'l3 after they used
non-recycled paper to print campaign
fliers.
GAIA representatives confirmed
they took back their endorsement of
Sachs and Simmons after discovering
the two had printed fliers on new
paper a violation of a "sustainable
campaign" agreement between can
didates and GAIA.
Sachs told The Daily she turned to
using non-recycled materials because

of the volume of flyers she decided to
print after receiving GAIA's endorse
ment. Simmons said she was "unable"
to follow the endorsement guidelines.
David Geeter II 'll said the candi
dates' use of new paper violated the
"values of the community" of sustain

ability organizations that form
GAIA.
Noel Crisostomo 'lO, another
GAIA representative, said the en
dorsement was about "building trust"
in the long term with elected ASSU
officers, and that whoever is elected

this week would be welcome to par
ticipate in projects of GAIA's mem
ber organizations.
