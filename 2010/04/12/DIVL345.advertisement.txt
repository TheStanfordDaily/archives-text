Memory: The Engine of Thought
In rhe Middle Ages, memory was ar the heart of culture —
verbal, visual, and auditory. People who mastered the art
of memory were capable of prodigious feats of recall
including memorizing the entire Book of Psalms and other
vast sections of the Bible, committing lengthy speeches to
memory and delivering them without notes, and composing
books in their entirety in the mind's eye and then dictating
individual chapters at random to a series of scribes
working simultaneously.
Join Mary Carruther Professor of Literature, New York University and Ulman Lindenberger,
Psychologist for Max Planck Institue for Human Development in Berlin, as they explore
and discuss the rich territory of the medieval art of memory as a concept, how the skill
was acquired, and how it worked in practice.
