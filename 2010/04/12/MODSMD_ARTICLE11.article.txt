# IF YOU BUILD IT, VOLUNTEERS WILL COME
## 
### E. BLAIR LAING STAFF WRITER 
Early Friday morning, a Stanford
Habitat for Humanity executive
greeted student volunteers with
Izzy's bagels at theTresidder bol
lards. The executive, Keren
Mikva *l2, greeted me by name,
"I look people up ahead of time so that
way I can recognize them if they are wan
dering around the parking lot," Mikva said.
"Or if they don't show up and I see them
again, I can call them on it."
Stanford Habitat for Humanity relies
on volunteers from the general student
body and getting enough people for a par
ticular build is sometimes difficult. No
shows are a constant problem, and Friday
was no exception.
Mikva attempted to call one last student
who had signed up, but she never answered,
so the four of us Lizzy Collins 'l3, Mario
Vazquez'l3,JesusMoraT3 andmyself â€”all
climbed into Mikva's car and we hit the road.
On the car ride over, Mikva filled us in
on what we'd be doing later at the build and
gave us a little history about Habitat for
Humanity. We would be working with
Habitat Silicon Valley and Habitat Greater
San Francisco, two partners of Habitat for
Humanity, on one of the homes in a six
house renovation project in Menlo Park.
Mikva explained that in the fall, Stanford

Habitat for Humanity focuses on their
charity event, the Home Run, to raise
money for their partner groups.
"This year we raised about $14,000,"
Mikva said. "And lately, we've been doing
about three to four builds per month. It re
ally depends on when they can give us
builds."
After a short drive we arrived at the
house where three Habitat workers met us
and decided that with such a small group,
we should actually work on a different
house nearby. We then filled out release
forms and donned hard hats, and the work
ers told us a little bit about Habitat's inter
national project.
Then came the safety instruction, which
the workers took very seriously.
"Even though these look like homes,
they are not yet homes, they are construc
tion sites," said Leena, one of the workers.
"It is very important that you be careful."
After our orientation, Leena took the
five of us to another house just around the
corner, where we were finally put to work.
Most of the time we were priming the exte
rior for its final paint, but some volunteers
also worked on scraping old paint, painting
the interior, and weed whacking. Students
worked on their own or in groups, and most
of the time was spent in idle chat.
"I'm always looking for volunteer op
portunities," Collins said, "but with my
schedule it is always really hard. I got an e

mail, and I didn't have class or practice
until the afternoon. I have wanted to do
Habitat for Humanity for the last couple of
years, and I finally got my opportunity."
Mora had also never participated with
Habitat, but also devotes much of his time
to philanthropy.
"I heard a lot about [Habitat] in high
school, and it's something I've always
wanted to do," he said. "I jumped at the op
portunity."
Vazquez, on the other hand, was quite
familiar with construction sites, having
worked on numerous homes during high
school.
"I used to help build houses back home
in Mexico, with a local group," Vazquez
said. "I went to a Catholic school so they
raised me to do a lot of community service
and I like it, it makes me feel good."
After a few hours of working in the sun
it was seventy and sunny we were all
hungry and ready to head home. After
hours of working and talking together,
about school and life and our families, the
ride back to campus was filled with easy
conversation and even light mocking
we were all covered in white paint and
looked pretty ridiculous.
"I really enjoyed it, and I'll make sure to
come back soon," Mora said.
