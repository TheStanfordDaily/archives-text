### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Elizabeth Titus Marisa Landicho 
With turnout up slightly up from

Council vote, six incumbents and
eight new candidates were elected to
the council on Saturday.
In the Graduate School of Busi
ness district, current Funding Com
mittee Chair Ping Li won the seat.
Current at-large council member
Justin Brown is the Earth Sciences
representative-elect. Joanna
Lankester, the top vote-getter among
the district candidates with 389 votes,
and Tao Chu were elected as School
of Engineering representatives.
In the School of Humanities and
Sciences, Praveen Shanbhag was
elected as humanities representative,
while Erik Lehnert won the natural
sciences spot and Salvador Zepeda
took the social science position. Jessi
ca Tsai retained her job as School of
Medicine representative, while Evan
Berquist is the new Law School repre
sentative.

ja, Krystal St. Julien in biochemistry,
at-large incumbent Drew Kennedy in

bioengineering, Yichuan Ding in
management science and engineering
(MS&E) and current secretary Crys
tal Yin, also in MS&E.
There were no candidates for
School of Education representative.
Voter turnout in the overall ASSU
election increased by 3.2 percent to
5,804 total votes, with gains mostly
coming from a 7.3 percent rise in
graduate student voting. Turnout fell
short of the record-breaking 2008.
Elections Commissioner Quinn
Slack 'll said 162 coterminal students

voted, and could cast votes for both
graduate and undergraduate ballot
items. In past years, coterms had to
choose whether to vote as undergrad
uates or graduates.
The presence of a graduate slate for
executive failed to galvanize the grad
uate population as much as some were
predicting, with graduate voting show
ing only a slight increase to 1,914 from
last year's 1,783. There are more than
8,000 graduate students at Stanford.
