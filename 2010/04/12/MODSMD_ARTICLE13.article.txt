## Stanford ranked "most stressful college" 
### KABIR SAWHNEY DESK EDITOR 
During New Student Orientation,
every incoming freshman is warned
about the so-called "Stanford Duck
Syndrome," which says, in a nutshell,
that appearances aren't everything.
Freshmen are told that, while it may
seem like they're struggling as every
one else is merely gliding along like a
duck, in reality everyone is paddling
furiously under the water just to
keep up.
The idea seemed to earn merit in a
recent report on the nation's 50 most
stressful colleges, published by The
Daily Beast. In the report, which was
published last week amid fierce
methodological criticism, Stanford
was ranked as the most stressful col
lege in the nation for undergraduate
students.
The ranking's authors did not rely
upon campus visits or speaking direct
ly to students. Rather, they developed
a methodology that uses data on indi
rect indicators of stress from several
sources.
The researchers believed that two
factors were the most prominent in de
termining stress levels: cost of tuition
and academic rigor. Each of these was
weighted at 35 percent in the ranking
calculation, with data drawn from the
National Center on Education Statis
tics and U.S. News & World Report, re
spectively.
The ranking also included three
other criteria, each weighted at 10 per
cent: acceptance rate, strength of the
engineering program and on-campus
crime. According to the report, a lower
acceptance rate correlates to a more
competitive student body. The authors
also said science and engineering stu
dents tend to have heavier workloads
and more stress than their peers.
While Stanford scored well on
crime, it had poor scores in all of the
other four categories.
Given these metrics, it is not sur
prising that the list closely mirrored the
U.S. News rankings for top universities,
with Columbia, M.1.T., Pennsylvania
and Harvard rounded out the top five.
The next California school on the list
was Caltech in ninth place.
Simon Wong, a Stanford electrical
engineering professor, was skeptical
about Stanford's position ahead of
other institutions. He believes students
at UC-Berkeley and M.I.T. are more
stressed than students at Stanford due
to M.l.T.'s greater competitiveness and
the bigger size of Cal's school.
"We have fewer students than Cal
or M.1.T.," he said. "Having more stu
dents leads to more stress ... I don't
think this study was very scientific.
They are going off of implied stress."
Anecdotal evidence also failed to
lend credence to the report's view for
some students.
"Stanford is really good with finan
cial aid," said Jaqi Pok 'l3. "I feel like
people aren't really stressed out too
much about finances."
Though cost appears to have a
much lower impact than assumed by
the researchers, academic pressures do
certainly add up.
"You don't come to Stanford if you
don't thrive on academic pressure,"
said Hannah Varnell 'l3. "Not stress,
but pressure."
Aside from taking issue with the re
port's methodology, Thomas Lee, a
professor in electrical engineering, also
questioned the entire idea of "stress."
"There are so many dimensions to
stress that, without a working defini
tion for it, it's hard to evaluate," he said.
"They try to come up with a single
number, because we like to reduce di
mensionality to a single value and
that's one."
Indeed, though the article is titled

"The 50 Most Stressful Colleges," it
does state that it is impossible to quan
tify stress; rather, the presence of a
"stressful environment" is highlighted.
Lee did agree that engineering stu
dents tend to have more academic
pressure on them than humanities or
social science students. However, he
did not concede this workload direct
ly leads to increased psychological
stress.
"If you have a lot of quantitative
sciences, that's probably going to put a
little more stress in some sense," he
said. "But does that mean that the stu
dents are emotionally damaged in
some way? That seems to be the im
plied message here, and I don't think
that's true."
Deniz Kahramaner 'l2, a computer

science and electrical engineering
double maj or, agreed with the multidi
mensional quality of stress. He also
emphasized the presence of numer
ous stress-relieving resources on cam
pus, and the ability of students to bal
ance academics with other activities.
"The term 'stress' is kind of over
generalized," he said. "I wouldn't say
we're the most stressful college, main
ly because of our resources. We have
CAPS [Counseling and Psychological
Services] and The Bridge, so I feel like
those things help a lot with not getting
stressed and taking care of balancing
your academic life and your personal
life."
