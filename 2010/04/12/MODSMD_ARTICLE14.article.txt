was found outside singing, "I gotta be,
I gotta be, I gotta be so much more
than me" with an emphasis on "so
much more."
"I'm so excited for next year," ex
claimed freshmen Misha Nasro and
Maxine Litre, simultaneously.
Four slates entered the race this

Brennen Clouse, Cordelia Sendax,

Franklin, Elise Geithner and Thomas
Hendee, "iThirteen" with Camilla
Boyer, Nelson Estrada, Adam Klein
and Greg Naifeh and "Sophs 4 More"
with Steven Greitzer, Shane Hegde,
Nasro and Litre.
The Sophs 4 More slate was elected
after gaining the highest number of
votes in all three run-off rounds. So-

Phresh was the final contender to
Sophs 4 More in the final round and
fell short by 50 votes, losing 559-509.
SoPhresh was the only slate to seek
endorsements, winning support from
the Queer Coalition and the Women's
Coalition.
In interviews with The Daily last
week, the slates disclosed their cam
paign spending Think Thirteen mem
bers said they spent $350 on campaign
materials, while the remaining three
slates said they spent around $BOO.
Sophs 4 More members said they
were surprised by the results and had
not expected to win.
"They were all such amazing
slates," Nasro said. "We were so sur
prised that we won."
The new sophomore class presi

on their plans."
"We've already started talking to
Junior Shore and Senior Package," the
presidential slates for the Classes of
2012 and 2011, Greitzer said.
All four members agreed that
planning for the upcoming year would
start immediately.
Members of the other slates said

that they would still be involved in
sophomore class affairs. Franklin, a
member of the So-Phresh slate, said
campaigning was a "fun experience,"
"I wanted to look back on campaign
week, win or lose, and be like, that was
a great week," she said. "And it was."
Franklin plans to apply for class
cabinet.
"I'm really excited and I still get to
be involved," she said.
"And I'll be able to sleep at night!"
she added.

unopposed. "Junior Shore," which in
cluded incumbent sophomore presi
dents Marie Caligiuri-de Jesus, Adrian
Castillo, Taylor Goodspeed and Is
abelle Wijangco, as well as newcomer
Cody Sam, was elected with 644 votes,
while "Senior Package" was elected
with 596 votes.

Hadidi, as well as newcomer Molly
Spaeth, will continue as senior class
