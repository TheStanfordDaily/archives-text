## THE 						GAO REPORT Time to Govern 
### Shelley Gao 
Now that the ASSU elections are over, the
focus must shift to governing. There is
much that can be said in a post-elections
analysis. The 10 out of 15 Senate seats gained by
the candidates endorsed by the Students of
Color Coalition (SOCC) can be attributed to
turnout. ASSU races are never issue driven, de
spite regular protests and demands for reform.
Get Out The Vote (GOTV) was the deciding
factor.
SOCC candidates were backed by a well-or
ganized operation that targeted and mobilized
core constituencies through personal emails,
phone calls and a strong chalking and flyer pres
ence. In a year of decreased turnout, the strategy
of driving the base to vote, and vote the ticket,
worked.
This tremendous organizational capacity re
flects a recent trend towards professionalization
of campus politics. Our student government
elections look insane compared to other schools.
The rise in campaign spending into thousands
for executive slates, the dominance of interest
groups that attempt to dictate the agenda and
the increased polarization make the elections
process both dramatic and arduous.
The results also expose the underlying dy
namics of Stanford student politics. For example,
groups attempt to induce and run on rhetoric of
fear e.g. "protect us from funding cuts!" This
tactic works particularly well in a culture of cyn
icism where the majority does not vote and
turnout is underpinned by identity politics. In
stead of launching into these matters, however,
thoughts on governing are more constructive
way for moving forward.
Serving in office is very different from run
ning for office. While being much harder, it is at
the same time less fun. Campaigning consists of
making promises; governing involves delivering
them. Being a candidate requires idealism; being
a legislator demands realism. Money does not
grow on trees, and bureaucracy does not em
brace change.
One of the most valuable lessons I have
learned is the importance of process. The means
is just as significant as the ends. How the Senate
conducts its business is instrumental to deter
mining the success of its initiatives and the legit
imacy of the institution.
First, the newly elected senators should take
the time to learn Roberts' Rules of Order, the set
of parliamentary procedures adopted by delib
erative assemblies. These standards that govern
weekly Senate meetings are vital to promoting
orderly behavior in the group decision-making
process. They also function as safeguards by pro
tecting the liberty of the minority voice in the fif
teen-member body. For example, debates can
not be ended without two-thirds approval.
Second, a thorough knowledge of the gov
erning documents is necessary. The ASSU Con
stitution and the Undergraduate Senate bylaws
serve as the foundation for how the organization
operates. In addition to stipulating responsibili
ties for officers, division of power and rules of

order, senators should be aware of the obscure
components. Given the poor attendance this
year, the Senate should have enacted the bylaw
dictating a vote on a bill of expulsion for mem
bers missing three meetings in a quarter.
Third, improving communication and the
feedback mechanism between the ASSU and
student body is critical. ASSU people tend to
suffer from myopia when in office. Being sur
rounded by insiders tends to narrow our outlook
of what really matters to the students. Everyone
ran on the promise of "engagement," and the
challenge now is enact proposals like the Senate
blog and dorm outreach events.
Engage for the sake of representing student
interests, and also for your own reputations. A
key lesson gained from last quarter's appropria
tions reforms is that how policy is created and ar
ticulated matter more than what the policy actu
ally is. Despite overwhelming consensus in the
Senate on the need to ensure sustainability of
the special fees system and reduce financial bur
den on students, poor public relations resulted in
outcry. Involving the student body from the be
ginning through office hours, reaching out to stu
dent groups, and meetings with opinion leaders
is critical to formulating and implementing well
received changes.
Despite my emphasis on process, sheer polit
ical will matters more. Combining the position's
inherent freedom and independence, the hectic
nature of being a Stanford student and a lack of
accountability, it is difficult to get things done. It
takes proactive mentality and a pragmatic philos
ophy to succeed. Apart from allocating funding
to student groups, most of the agendas are long
term advocacy projects that require patience and
an appreciation for incremental results.
My final piece of advice is to use your re
sources. Transition is a weakness for the Senate.
Institutional memory is difficult to maintain in
an organization with high turnover rate. Try to
have conversations with the current and past
senators and ASSU officials. We have invested
substantially into getting elected, learning the
ropes and paying for our mistakes.
Admittedly, the ASSU is a thankless job. The
institution is stacked against change. But engag
ing with it is the only effective and meaningful
avenue for promoting student voice and shared
governance at Stanford.
