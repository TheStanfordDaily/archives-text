# UNFASHIONABLE NONSENSE
## Spring Quarter and the Science of People-Watching 
### Emily Hulme 
Spring quarter, as everyone knows, is the
best quarter at Stanford. It doesn't take
long to realize this.
Why exactly it is the best quarter, like why
the sky is blue and why time is relative and why
baby otters are adorable, is more elusive. Some
how, right at the end of the year, there is a quar
ter packed with new beginnings, as seniors plan
their next move and freshmen sort into their
first draw groups. After hibernating behind
stacks of books in Bender, it seems even the
most reclusive students trade in pens, paper and
course readers for sun, napping, and lightheart
ed chatter on every lawn across the campus.
Most importantly, I think, is the conscious
decision that we no longer resent procrastina
tion, but embrace it. The warmth invites us to
willfully abandon work; burdens give way to
sun-kissed leisure.
After all, the cosmic order of the world is
once again balanced with Moonbean's, also
known as Coupa,reopening.There are plenty of
other coffee places on and off campus, but only
this location has the prime seating for people
watching, a favorite pastime of degenerates like
myself. While in winter it could have served its
nominal function as a caffeine distribution
point, only in the lazy days of spring quarter can
the real competitive people watching begin.
The art of people watching and an art it is
begins with selecting a good vantage point.
While White Plaza has the advantage of being
the venue of choice for publicity stunts, it's actu
ally not that great for people watching. To the
expert palette, these attention grabbing, bour
geoisie exercises lack the necessary nuance. So,
bears are the number one threat to Americans
and some guy can walk on a tightrope.These are
meant to be noticed, and people watching is
more about the accidental and peculiar than the
obvious and overt. Also, most of the people loi
tering around that area are tourists and/or ran
dom couples with children, since evidently ei
ther Tresidder doubles as a playtime facility or
the salads at the CoHo are really the height of
Bay Area cuisine.
Sometimes, though, its worth watching what
exactly tourists consider picture worthy. Most
of the time, they take pictures of silly, ordinary
buildings, hardly aesthetically remarkable or
historically prominent, but sometimes they

take pictures of the silly, ordinary buildings that
I only think of as pedestrian because I happen
to have the good fortune to see them each and
every day.

Nonetheless, for sheer amusement per
minute, the benches by Meyer cannot be beat. If
you have a sadistic bent, during the de facto
passing period a few accidents are guaranteed
around some of the turns here. But these tran
sient bikers are not the real focus of the best
people watching. Instead, the people on the
lawn by the fountain, especially those sleeping
with copies of books split open over their eyes,
are priceless. Awkward couples also abound,
and will loiter around the table area. The overly
educated also debut their quirky sense of fash
ion here; but, if you can overhear them, you
might get in on some gossip about the latest re
search-funding quarrel. As it turns out, real peo
ple and students complain in just about the
same way, and the best is when an especially in
furiated speaker paints a vivid picture of just
how psychotically deranged their boss/hus
band/wife/yoga instructor really is.
Also, seeing as this is the Silicon Valley, there
are always a few dozen people loitering around
with their eyes cast down to their iPhone. These
technologically savvy souls resist people watch
ing, for they reject all the strangers and even
strangeness around them in favor the familiar
and their friends.The people watcher, instead, is
all about the unfamiliar.

And perhaps the unfamiliar is very much
what spring quarter is all about. New begin
nings are both exciting and unpredictable, or
perhaps exciting because they are unpre
dictable. As it warms up, we can certainly all
cheer for new beginnings over a cup of Moon
beans ... er, Coupa.
