## NEAR PERFECT 
### LAUREN TAYLOR STAFF WRITER 
Though gymnastics is an individual sport,
the Stanford women gymnasts proved this
weekend at the NCAA Southeast Regionals in
West Virginia that team momentum can be the
key to victory. Armed with enthusiasm and
team support, the No. 1 seed Cardinal showed
three high-scoring rotations to win handily
with 196.775 points and advance to the NCAA
Championships for the fourth consecutive sea
son.
No. 2 seed Michigan (195.800) also received
a berth to the Finals, and the Card and the
Wolverines will be two of the 12 teams to com
pete in Gainesville, Fla. at the NCAA Team
Preliminaries.
Stanford came into the meet with both high
energy and high expectations. According to
sophomore Alexandra Skoly, from the time the
team woke up on the morning of competition,
the gymnasts all "had a great feeling that today
was going to be something special."
Stanford justified its No. 1 ranking with a
strong first rotation: the floor exercise. Senior
Tenaya West set the standard high with a solid
9.80, but her teammates rose to the challenge
and scored even higher, as fellow seniors Allyse
Ishino and Carly Janiga both hit 9.905.
"Their tumbling was great, their showman
ship, their performance quality," said head
coach Kristen Smyth."One routine built on an
other."
Stanford's floor score 0f49.300 was eclipsed
one rotation later by the vault, in which the
Cardinal gymnasts stuck every single landing.
The team scored a 49.400, its second-highest in
the event all season. Junior co-captain Shelley
Alexander led the way with a 9.95 and won the
event, and three of her teammates joined her
with 9.90-plus scores.

"I don't think I've ever seen an event like
that before," Smyth said after Stanford had
built a score of 98.700 after the floor and vault.

"The first two events were absolutely lights
out."
The bars gained another 49.275 points for
the Cardinal but the team's beam performance
kept Stanford from delivering a completely
perfect performance. Alexander, however,
closed the beam section after a teammate's fall
and hit her second winning routine with a 9.90.
Alexander had a spectacular meet, setting
personal collegiate career bests on the vault
and in the all-around with a 39.500. In the latter,
she placed third overall, between teammates
Janiga (39.525) and senior Allyse Ishino
(39.350), who placed second and fourth, re
spectively. Never in Alexander's collegiate ca
reer had she won multiple events in a single
meet, but on Saturday she held key positions in
the lineup, led off the bars and anchored the
vault, beam and floor, despite a recent shoulder
injury.
"It was a fantastic effort," Smyth said. "On
the beam, she knew we had a miss and rose to
the occasion. She competed in only one event
at Pac-lOs and I think that fired her up and
helped her use that as motivation to go out and
prove something to herself."
Now Stanford heads to nationals for the
eighth time in 10 years. In contrast to last sea
son, when the team seemed to dip in confi
dence during regionals, this year's Cardinal
team is heading in the opposite direction and
gaining plenty of momentum.
Despite a late beam fall that prevented
Stanford from achieving its primary goal and
hitting all 24 routines, the team is confident and
ready with all of the right elements to produce
the overall performance that has been elusive
all season.
"The girls all really believe in themselves
and seem to be putting it all together," Smyth
said. "We've got great positive energy. We just
need to open up and let the great work come
out."
