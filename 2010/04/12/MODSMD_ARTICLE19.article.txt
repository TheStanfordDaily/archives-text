## Card avoids Oregon sweep, ends losing streak 
### KABIR SAWHNEY DESK EDITOR 
Entering the weekend on a three-game los
ing streak, the Stanford baseball team hoped
to rebound in its third Pac-10 series of the year
against Oregon. Instead, the Ducks (21-11,4-5
Pac-10) took two out of three games from the
No. 22 Cardinal (14-13,4-5).

The results from this series do not bode
well for the remainder of Stanford's Pac-10
campaign. The Ducks are one of the confer
ence's weaker squads the school just rein
stated its Division I baseball program.
Though the series was originally scheduled
to be played over three days, Sunday's game
was moved to Saturday in anticipation of in
clement weather.

On Friday, Oregon came away from
Sunken Diamond with a 5-2 win. Two Oregon
pitchers, Tyler Anderson and Scott McGough,
combined to five-hit Stanford's lineup. While
freshman third baseman Kenny Diekroeger
stood out with two hits and an RBI, the rest of
the Cardinal lineup was unable to capitalize
on opportunities. In total, seven runners were
left on base.

Stanford's pitching staff also found difficul
ty in containing Oregon's hitters. In his second
start of the year, sophomore pitcher Brian Bu
sick gave up four runs in five innings.The three
relievers that came after him sophomore
Chris Reed, freshman Dean Mc Ardle and jun
ior Danny Sandbrink were more effective.
