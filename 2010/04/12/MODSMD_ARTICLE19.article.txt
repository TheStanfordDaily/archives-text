## Card avoids Oregon sweep, ends losing streak 
### KABIR SAWHNEY DESK EDITOR 
Entering the weekend on a three-game los
ing streak, the Stanford baseball team hoped
to rebound in its third Pac-10 series of the year
against Oregon. Instead, the Ducks (21-11,4-5
Pac-10) took two out of three games from the
No. 22 Cardinal (14-13,4-5).

The results from this series do not bode
well for the remainder of Stanford's Pac-10
campaign. The Ducks are one of the confer
ence's weaker squads the school just rein
stated its Division I baseball program.
Though the series was originally scheduled
to be played over three days, Sunday's game
was moved to Saturday in anticipation of in
clement weather.

On Friday, Oregon came away from
Sunken Diamond with a 5-2 win. Two Oregon
pitchers, Tyler Anderson and Scott McGough,
combined to five-hit Stanford's lineup. While
freshman third baseman Kenny Diekroeger
stood out with two hits and an RBI, the rest of
the Cardinal lineup was unable to capitalize
on opportunities. In total, seven runners were
left on base.

Stanford's pitching staff also found difficul
ty in containing Oregon's hitters. In his second
start of the year, sophomore pitcher Brian Bu
sick gave up four runs in five innings.The three
relievers that came after him sophomore
Chris Reed, freshman Dean Mc Ardle and jun
ior Danny Sandbrink were more effective.
allowing just one run in the final four
innings. Busick took the loss, drop
ping his season record to 2-1.
The Ducks extended Stanford's
losing streak to five games on Satur
day, taking the first game of the dou
bleheader 9-6 and decisively winning
the series.
However, for most of the game it
appeared that the Cardinal would be
able to take home its first win of the
series. After seven innings, Stanford
led 6-1 and looked poised to get the
final six outs with ease. Freshman
Eric Smith, the designated hitter,
had a breakout day, going 2-for-3
with a triple and also hit by a pitch.
Entering the weekend, he had a .182
average in only 22 at-bats.
After the game, Stanford head
coach Mark Marquess said that
Smith would figure more prominent
ly in the Cardinal lineup in future se
ries.
"He did a great job for us today
and gave us a lift when we needed it,"
he said. "He's going to be a real good
hitter."
But Stanford's pitching fell apart
in the last two innings. The Ducks
mounted a three-run rally in the
eighth inning to bring the score to 6-
4, then broke the game open with
five runs in the ninth to take a 9-6
lead. Despite Stanford's attempts to
draw even, its offense was shut down
by Oregon's relief pitchers in the last
two innings.
The Cardinal relievers managed
to choke away the solid start by
sophomore pitcher Jordan Pries,
who gave up only one run on five hits
through seven innings. While Pries
earned a no-decision for the game,
he has been Stanford's ace this sea
son. In seven starts, he has a 3-1
record and a 3.06 ERA, with two
complete games. He has also pitched

50 innings, a much higher total than
any other Cardinal pitcher.
However, the two pitchers that
came on in relief of Pries, freshman
Mark Appel and junior Alex Pracher,
were unable to hold down the Ore
gon offense. Appel only got one out in
the eighth while giving up three runs,
and Pracher gave up five runs in the
ninth before freshman Sahil Bloom
got the final out of the game.
"We had that 6-1 lead in the
eighth and then we gave it away,"
Marquess said. "That was unfortu
nate, and we needed a good perform
ance."
The final game of the series saw
Stanford save itself from the sweep
with a 2-1 victory.
Stanford's offense was not partic
ularly strong against Oregon starter
Alex Keudell, scoring only two runs
off him in six innings. Keudell gave
up only one walk while striking out
six.
Keudell's removal from the game
in the seventh inning generated
some controversy, as Oregon's pitch
ing coach was ejected from the game
after irking the umpire during a con
ference on the mound. Such ejec
tions are highly unusual in college
games, and came on the heels of a
hotly disputed interference call on
Keudell.
Nevertheless, the two pitchers
Oregon used in relief were also
strong, holding the Cardinal to no
runs in the final two innings.
Meanwhile, sophomore Brett
Mooneyham, the starting pitcher for
Stanford, pitched eight excellent in
nings, allowing just one run on five
hits (and that run came on a walk
which drove in a runner after
Mooneyham had left the game). He
had five walks while striking out
seven. Mooneyham had not been
pitching well up to that point he
entered the game with a 7.52 ERA.
"My mechanics were a lot
smoother," Mooneyham said. "It
made it easier for me to repeat and
throw strikes. There was also great

defense behind me,"
McArdle closed out the game in
the ninth inning to earn the save.
The Stanford defense was also
stellar, turning three double plays
and giving up no errors.
The next game for Stanford is a
mid-week contest at Santa Clara (14-
15, 1-4 West Coast Conference).
While the Broncos should not pose
too much of a challenge to the Card,
Stanford has not had much recent
success in similar midweek games
against nonconference opponents.
Santa Clara recently split two games
with Pepperdine, which the Card
swept earlier in the season.
The first pitch against the Bron
cos will be at 6 p.m. on April 13 in
Santa Clara, Calif.

eighth and then we gave it away,"
Marquess said. "That was unfortu
nate, and we needed a good perform
ance."
The final game of the series saw
Stanford save itself from the sweep
with a 2-1 victory.
Stanford's offense was not partic
ularly strong against Oregon starter
Alex Keudell, scoring only two runs
off him in six innings. Keudell gave
up only one walk while striking out
six.
Keudell's removal from the game
in the seventh inning generated
some controversy, as Oregon's pitch
ing coach was ejected from the game
after irking the umpire during a con
ference on the mound. Such ejec
tions are highly unusual in college
games, and came on the heels of a
hotly disputed interference call on
Keudell.
Nevertheless, the two pitchers
Oregon used in relief were also
strong, holding the Cardinal to no
runs in the final two innings.
Meanwhile, sophomore Brett
Mooneyham, the starting pitcher for
Stanford, pitched eight excellent in
nings, allowing just one run on five
hits (and that run came on a walk
which drove in a runner after
Mooneyham had left the game). He
had five walks while striking out
seven. Mooneyham had not been
pitching well up to that point he
entered the game with a 7.52 ERA.
"My mechanics were a lot
smoother," Mooneyham said. "It
made it easier for me to repeat and
throw strikes. There was also great

defense behind me,"
McArdle closed out the game in
the ninth inning to earn the save.
The Stanford defense was also
stellar, turning three double plays
and giving up no errors.
The next game for Stanford is a
mid-week contest at Santa Clara (14-
15, 1-4 West Coast Conference).
While the Broncos should not pose
too much of a challenge to the Card,
Stanford has not had much recent
success in similar midweek games
against nonconference opponents.
Santa Clara recently split two games
with Pepperdine, which the Card
swept earlier in the season.
The first pitch against the Bron
cos will be at 6 p.m. on April 13 in
Santa Clara, Calif.

Sophomore pitcher Jordan Pries gave up only one run on five hits through the first seven innings of Saturday morning's game,
but the Card's pitching fell apart in the final two innings, giving up eight runs and the eventual victory to the Ducks, 9-6.
Entering the weekend on a three-game los
ing streak, the Stanford baseball team hoped
to rebound in its third Pac-10 series of the year
against Oregon. Instead, the Ducks (21-11,4-5
Pac-10) took two out of three games from the
No. 22 Cardinal (14-13,4-5).

The results from this series do not bode
well for the remainder of Stanford's Pac-10
campaign. The Ducks are one of the confer
ence's weaker squads the school just rein
stated its Division I baseball program.
Though the series was originally scheduled
to be played over three days, Sunday's game
was moved to Saturday in anticipation of in
clement weather.

On Friday, Oregon came away from
Sunken Diamond with a 5-2 win. Two Oregon
pitchers, Tyler Anderson and Scott McGough,
combined to five-hit Stanford's lineup. While
freshman third baseman Kenny Diekroeger
stood out with two hits and an RBI, the rest of
the Cardinal lineup was unable to capitalize
on opportunities. In total, seven runners were
left on base.

Stanford's pitching staff also found difficul
ty in containing Oregon's hitters. In his second
start of the year, sophomore pitcher Brian Bu
sick gave up four runs in five innings.The three
relievers that came after him sophomore
Chris Reed, freshman Dean Mc Ardle and jun
ior Danny Sandbrink were more effective.
allowing just one run in the final four
innings. Busick took the loss, drop
ping his season record to 2-1.
The Ducks extended Stanford's
losing streak to five games on Satur
day, taking the first game of the dou
bleheader 9-6 and decisively winning
the series.
However, for most of the game it
appeared that the Cardinal would be
able to take home its first win of the
series. After seven innings, Stanford
led 6-1 and looked poised to get the
final six outs with ease. Freshman
Eric Smith, the designated hitter,
had a breakout day, going 2-for-3
with a triple and also hit by a pitch.
Entering the weekend, he had a .182
average in only 22 at-bats.
After the game, Stanford head
coach Mark Marquess said that
Smith would figure more prominent
ly in the Cardinal lineup in future se
ries.
"He did a great job for us today
and gave us a lift when we needed it,"
he said. "He's going to be a real good
hitter."
But Stanford's pitching fell apart
in the last two innings. The Ducks
mounted a three-run rally in the
eighth inning to bring the score to 6-
4, then broke the game open with
five runs in the ninth to take a 9-6
lead. Despite Stanford's attempts to
draw even, its offense was shut down
by Oregon's relief pitchers in the last
two innings.
The Cardinal relievers managed
to choke away the solid start by
sophomore pitcher Jordan Pries,
who gave up only one run on five hits
through seven innings. While Pries
earned a no-decision for the game,
he has been Stanford's ace this sea
son. In seven starts, he has a 3-1
record and a 3.06 ERA, with two
complete games. He has also pitched

50 innings, a much higher total than
any other Cardinal pitcher.
However, the two pitchers that
came on in relief of Pries, freshman
Mark Appel and junior Alex Pracher,
were unable to hold down the Ore
gon offense. Appel only got one out in
the eighth while giving up three runs,
and Pracher gave up five runs in the
ninth before freshman Sahil Bloom
got the final out of the game.
"We had that 6-1 lead in the
eighth and then we gave it away,"
Marquess said. "That was unfortu
nate, and we needed a good perform
ance."
The final game of the series saw
Stanford save itself from the sweep
with a 2-1 victory.
