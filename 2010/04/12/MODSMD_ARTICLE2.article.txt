# STUDENT GOV'T
## Six groups do not get special fees All other groups acquire enough support to receive fees 
### ERIC MESSINGER SENIOR MANAGING EDITOR 
Out of 55 total requests for special
fees funding from voluntary student or
ganizations in this year's election, 49
were approved by voters during this
weekend's election.
Six groups did not receive approval
for special fees funding: The Stanford
Progressive, Stanford Students in Enter
tainment, Stanford Cardinal Broadcast
ing Network, the Stanford Chaparral, the
Society for International Affairs at Stan
ford and the Stanford Journal of Interna
tional Relations.
All six groups requested undergradu
ate-only special fees. They each received
more than 50 percent "yes" votes, but not
from the 15 percent of total undergradu
ates required for approval.
Requests for undergraduate special
fees from 43 other groups passed, as did
the six requests for joint fees, which re
quired approval from both undergradu
ate and graduate voters.
The five undergraduate groups to re
ceive the most "yes" votes (as opposed to
"no" or "abstain") were: Alternative
Spring Break (2,277), the Sexual Health
Peer Resource Center (2,149), Student
Initiated Courses (2,009), the Leland
Stanford Junior University Marching
Band (1,997) and The Bridge Peer Coun
seling Center (1,953).
The special fees process earned
greater attention this year after the Sen
ate Appropriations Committee sought to
reduce per-student special fees costs and
the quarterly refund rate. Accordingly,
the Senate passed a bill to essentially end
the ability of groups to automatically re
quest a ten-percent increase in special
fees from year to year.
Many student groups then petitioned
to be on the ballot with amounts greater
than those recommended by the Appro
priations Committee. Most who peti
tioned found success on Saturday; ac
cording to Committee Chair Anton Zi
etsman 'l2, with the exception of the So
ciety for International Affairs at Stan
ford, all groups that petitioned for more
than the recommended amount passed.
Three of the six organizations rejected
for funding were publications, which
have a potential safety net for
funding through the ASSU Publi
cations Board. Co-Director Devin
Banerjee 'll wrote in an e-mail to
The Daily that the Board would
consider funding applications
from the groups. Banerjee is a sen
ior staff writer for The Daily and
its former editor in chief.
In total, voters approved re
quests for $1,748,356.68 in special
fees funding for the 2010-11 year.
