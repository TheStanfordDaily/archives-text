# VOLLEYBALL BEATS NO. 3, NO. 6 TEAMS

### CAROLINE CASELLI DESK EDITOR 
Playing in front of two large crowds in Maples
Pavilion this past weekend, the No. 1 Stanford
men's volleyball team beat two Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation (MPSF) opponents. The victo
ries maintained the Card's top ranking and secured
home-court advantage for the first round of the
MPSF Tournament.
After suffering its first loss in over a month and
a half to Cal State Northridge last Friday, Stanford
looked to rebuild and refocus for this weekend's
matches.
"I think the loss last weekend really gave us a
sense of urgency for this week," said sophomore

libero Erik Shoji. "We knew we had to win these
two matches and that really helped us in our prepa
ration."
On Friday, the Card (18-5,15-5 MPSF) faced a
familiar foe, No. 3 Pepperdine (15-8,13-7 MPSF). In
February, the last time that the two teams met, Pep
perdine handed Stanford one of its five losses.
Flowever, this time the Card fared better, taking
down the Waves in an exciting five-set victory.
Stanford took charge of the match early, jump
ing out to a 10-4 lead in the first set after a string of
three kills and an ace from senior opposite Evan
Romero. The team took an eight-point lead at 16-8
that was maintained to the end; a Romero kill
sealed the victory, 30-22.
The second set went back and forth up to 13-13,

at which point the Cardinal began to pull away.
Dominant hitting from Romero in addition to sev
eral kills from sophomore middle blocker Gus Ellis
led the Card to a 30-25 second set conclusion.
But the Waves stayed alive, narrowly winning
the third set 38-36 after each team traded set point
several times. Pepperdine then took the fourth set,
30-26, leaving the match's conclusion to the decid
ing 15-point fifth game.
"After game four we had a team huddle to refo
cus and reenergize ourselves for the fifth set," Shoji
explained. "That huddle really provided us with the
energy we needed for game five."
From the first point, the fifth set was Stanford's
