# VOLLEYBALL BEATS NO. 3, NO. 6 TEAMS
## 
### CAROLINE CASELLI DESK EDITOR 
Playing in front of two large crowds in Maples
Pavilion this past weekend, the No. 1 Stanford
men's volleyball team beat two Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation (MPSF) opponents. The victo
ries maintained the Card's top ranking and secured
home-court advantage for the first round of the
MPSF Tournament.
After suffering its first loss in over a month and
a half to Cal State Northridge last Friday, Stanford
looked to rebuild and refocus for this weekend's
matches.
"I think the loss last weekend really gave us a
sense of urgency for this week," said sophomore

libero Erik Shoji. "We knew we had to win these
two matches and that really helped us in our prepa
ration."
On Friday, the Card (18-5,15-5 MPSF) faced a
familiar foe, No. 3 Pepperdine (15-8,13-7 MPSF). In
February, the last time that the two teams met, Pep
perdine handed Stanford one of its five losses.
Flowever, this time the Card fared better, taking
down the Waves in an exciting five-set victory.
Stanford took charge of the match early, jump
ing out to a 10-4 lead in the first set after a string of
three kills and an ace from senior opposite Evan
Romero. The team took an eight-point lead at 16-8
that was maintained to the end; a Romero kill
sealed the victory, 30-22.
The second set went back and forth up to 13-13,

at which point the Cardinal began to pull away.
Dominant hitting from Romero in addition to sev
eral kills from sophomore middle blocker Gus Ellis
led the Card to a 30-25 second set conclusion.
But the Waves stayed alive, narrowly winning
the third set 38-36 after each team traded set point
several times. Pepperdine then took the fourth set,
30-26, leaving the match's conclusion to the decid
ing 15-point fifth game.
"After game four we had a team huddle to refo
cus and reenergize ourselves for the fifth set," Shoji
explained. "That huddle really provided us with the
energy we needed for game five."
From the first point, the fifth set was Stanford's

in the short game. Junior outside hitter

win the set, and match, 15-6.
Romero had a career-high 37 kills
and an impressive .429 hitting per

mature we are as a team," Kawika

panicked, but this team has learned
from its mistakes and is mature
enough to play its best during the most
difficult situations."
On Saturday, Stanford took on No.
6 USC. Despite trailing by seven in the
second set, the Card easily swept the
Trojans, 30-23, 30-24 and 30-15. By
winning this match, the Cardinal en
sured it will play the first round of the
MPSF Tournament at home,
"We are excited to play at home
again," Kawika Shoji said. "We have
the best crowd in the country. It's a fun

atmosphere."
Lawson and Romero led the team
in kills with 15 and 13, respectively.
Kawika Shoji had a perfect hitting
percentage, with four kills on four at
tempts, in addition to his 36 assists and
13 digs.

side hitter Tony Ciarelli tallied 14 kills

Murphy Troy contributed nine kills

"Everyone has their aches and
pains but we are working through
them," Erik Shoji said. "As far as
morale, we're pretty good right now.
We are happy with where we are right
now but we know we have two more
regular season matches left that are

very, very important, so we are contin
uing to work hard."
This weekend, Stanford will play

Heading into the final stretch of
the season, Stanford is trying to stay
healthy and positive.
"Everyone has their aches and
pains but we are working through
them," Erik Shoji said. "As far as
morale, we're pretty good right now.
We are happy with where we are right
now but we know we have two more
regular season matches left that are

very, very important, so we are contin
uing to work hard."
This weekend, Stanford will play
its final two MPSF matches in South
ern California. On Friday, the Cardi
nal will face No. 7 UCLA, and on Sat
urday, Stanford will take on No. 8
UC-Irvine, with both matches start
ing at 7 p.m.
