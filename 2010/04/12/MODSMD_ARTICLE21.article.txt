# Woods' lackluster return
## 
### Mike Lazarus 
On the 14th green at Au
gusta National on Sun
day, we saw a new Tiger
Woods a suddenly
vulnerable Tiger Woods.
Not vulnerable as the perfect role
model superstar, that was already lost.
He was vulnerable in his last sanctuary
of normality —as a golfer on a golf
course.
For the past six months, Tiger Woods
(the brand) has been systematically dis
mantled, banished into hiding and then
brought back into the public eye with
every word, facial hair and action script
ed to perfection.
We heard how he was ready to win
again. We heard how he felt a burden
had been lifted. We heard how he was
more focused than ever. And we be
lieved it.
While we mocked his desperate
voicemails to his mistresses and
watched his new Nike commercial fea
turing his late father with either admira
tion or astonishment, we never doubted
his athletic greatness.
This is the savior, after all. A man
who does the meaning of the word im
possible on a golf course; a man who
could orchestrate one of the greatest in
fidelities of all time one night, and then
go shoot a 66 the next day.
We expected to see the Tiger of old
on Sunday. On the 14th hole, we saw
Happy Gilmore.
Coming off a birdie on 13 to keep
him in the hunt, Woods had a short
birdie putt to put him within striking
range heading into the final four holes
of the tournament. The Tiger we knew
sinks this putt without fail.
On Sunday, he didn't. After missing
the birdie putt by a few feet, Tiger
walked straight up to his ball and non
chalantly tapped in to settle for par.
Except that he missed. Tiger did the
unthinkable —he faltered mentally.
His stroke was about twice as fast as it
needed to be a clear sign of frustra
tion and his shot lipped out. Then
again, without hesitation, Woods quick
ly approached his ball, this time sinking
the bogey putt.
Squint your eyes and you could al
most see Adam Sandler mercilessly
hacking away at his ball in Happy
Gilmore.
Whatever sense of invincibility Tiger
had, he left it on the 14th green. There it
was, a man defeated. Half a year of ad
missions, apologies and a lack of an
swers had apparently taken its toll.
Sensing his Masters championship
slipping away as his birdie putt rolled
past the hole, Tiger lost control. Yes, he
wears his emotions on his sleeve on the
course, slamming clubs and swearing
after a bad shot. But then he goes and
drills a seven-iron out of the trees with
in a yard of the pin.
Rushing and missing a gimme par
putt? That's not Tiger, it can't be Tiger.
Will it be Tiger, though?
It would be foolhardy to extrapo
late too much from Tiger's Masters
performance. After a six-month layoff;
he still finished tied for fourth in the
most signature event of his sport. He
responded to his meltdown on 14 by
eagling 15. By any stretch of the imagi
nation, Tiger did not play poorly.
It just wasn't, well, it wasn't Tger
like. And that's the problem. We tune in
to watch the greatest golfer in the
world dominate his sport in away no
one ever has or ever will. Anything less
and we feel shortchanged.
So, did what we witness on the 14th
green at Augusta National on April 11,
2010, mark the beginning of the end of
Tiger's stranglehold over the golfing
world or will it just be a minor blip in
the history books?
Tiger will go on to win more majors.
He has too much talent not to win. Yet
what the entire golfing world saw on 14
was proof that Tger was in fact vulner
able. Never before had anyone seen
the great Tiger Woods collapse like that
and most assumed they probably
never would.

Tiger's biggest strength the fear
he struck in his competitors is gone.
