# Woods' lackluster return

### Mike Lazarus 
On the 14th green at Au
gusta National on Sun
day, we saw a new Tiger
Woods a suddenly
vulnerable Tiger Woods.
Not vulnerable as the perfect role
model superstar, that was already lost.
He was vulnerable in his last sanctuary
of normality —as a golfer on a golf
course.
For the past six months, Tiger Woods
(the brand) has been systematically dis
mantled, banished into hiding and then
brought back into the public eye with
every word, facial hair and action script
ed to perfection.
We heard how he was ready to win
again. We heard how he felt a burden
had been lifted. We heard how he was
more focused than ever. And we be

While we mocked his desperate
voicemails to his mistresses and
watched his new Nike commercial fea

his athletic greatness.
This is the savior, after all. A man
who does the meaning of the word im

range heading into the final four holes
of the tournament. The Tiger we knew
sinks this putt without fail.
On Sunday, he didn't. After missing
the birdie putt by a few feet, Tiger
walked straight up to his ball and non
chalantly tapped in to settle for par.
Except that he missed. Tiger did the
unthinkable —he faltered mentally.
His stroke was about twice as fast as it
needed to be a clear sign of frustra
tion and his shot lipped out. Then
again, without hesitation, Woods quick
ly approached his ball, this time sinking
the bogey putt.
Squint your eyes and you could al
most see Adam Sandler mercilessly
hacking away at his ball in Happy
Gilmore.
Whatever sense of invincibility Tiger
had, he left it on the 14th green. There it
was, a man defeated. Half a year of ad
missions, apologies and a lack of an
