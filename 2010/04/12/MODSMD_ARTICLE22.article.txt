## GERHART BATTLES BEAVERS OFFENSE 
### KABIR SAWHNEY DESK EDITOR 
After a strong series against Califor
nia to open its Pac-10 season, the No. 8
Stanford Softball team traveled to Cor
vallis, Ore. for its first road game since
spring break. Against Oregon State, the
Cardinal (30-6,4-2 Pac-10) was able to
win the series by taking games on Fri
day and Saturday. However, the
Beavers (21-18,2-4) avoided the sweep
by winning the final game of the series
on Sunday.
Once again, the Cardinal looked to
ride the pitching of freshman Teagan
Gerhart to victory. Gerhart started all
three games of the series, pitching a
total of 19.2 innings over three days.
In the first game of the series, Stan
ford built a four-run lead in the fourth
and fifth innings off Oregon State pitch
er Paige Hall. In the fourth inning, the
Card was able to score due to two field
ing errors, both committed by Beaver
shortstop Nikki Chandler. Though
Stanford left two runners on base, soph
omore second baseman Ashley Hansen
and freshman shortstop Jenna Rich
scored in the inning.
In the fifth inning, Stanford added
two more runs to its lead with three hits
in the inning.
However, Oregon State refused to
go down easily and attempted to mount
a comeback in the sixth inning. The
Beavers hit two home runs off Gerhart
a two-run shot by designated player
Audrey Roderfeld and a solo homer by
first baseman Ally Kutz.
Unfortunately for Oregon State, it
was not enough to close the gap the
Beavers were only able to amass three
runs. The game ended with a final score

of 4-3.
Saturday's game was equally close,
decided by a margin of one run. The
game was a classic pitcher's duel, pitting
Gerhart against Hall for the second
straight contest.
Gerhart allowed only three hits in
seven innings while striking out five,
while Hall allowed five hits and gar
nered three strikeouts.
At the end, Gerhart outlasted Hall
once again, as the Stanford offense
eked out a run in the fifth inning. Field
ing lapses hurt the Beavers, as an error
allowed Stanford to score its only run,
which went into the books as unearned.
The final score of the game was a close
1-0.
After two low-scoring contests, the
third game was markedly different. The
two teams combined for 18 runs, with
Oregon State taking the game 10-8 on
the back of a huge six-run rally in the
fifth inning off the pitching of Gerhart
and Rich.
In the final game of the series, the
Beaver offense finally figured out how
to get hits off the previously invincible
Gerhart. In 5.2 innings, she gave up 10
hits and seven runs, all earned. In 0.1 in
nings, Rich was also unable to staunch
Oregon State's offense, giving up three
runs on three hits.
After delivering eight runs of sup
port through the first five innings, the
Cardinal offense found itself unable to
close the gap with the Beavers. Hall shut
it out in the final two innings to preserve
the win for the Beavers.
Senior catcher Rosey Neill was the
offensive star for Stanford she had
two hits and four RBIs in three at-bats.
Sophomore right fielder Maya Burns
was also a big contributor, going 1-3
with two RBIs.
The Cardinal will continue Pac-10
competition next weekend against No.
3 Arizona. The Wildcats (32-7, 2-4)
were recently swept by Washington,
the No. 1 team in the nation.

After a strong series against Califor

Stanford Softball team traveled to Cor
vallis, Ore. for its first road game since
spring break. Against Oregon State, the
Cardinal (30-6,4-2 Pac-10) was able to
win the series by taking games on Fri
day and Saturday. However, the
Beavers (21-18,2-4) avoided the sweep
by winning the final game of the series
on Sunday.
Once again, the Cardinal looked to
ride the pitching of freshman Teagan
Gerhart to victory. Gerhart started all
three games of the series, pitching a
total of 19.2 innings over three days.
In the first game of the series, Stan

Unfortunately for Oregon State, it

runs. The game ended with a final score

of 4-3.
Saturday's game was equally close,
decided by a margin of one run. The
game was a classic pitcher's duel, pitting
Gerhart against Hall for the second

Gerhart allowed only three hits in

After a strong series against Califor
nia to open its Pac-10 season, the No. 8
Stanford Softball team traveled to Cor
vallis, Ore. for its first road game since
spring break. Against Oregon State, the
Cardinal (30-6,4-2 Pac-10) was able to
win the series by taking games on Fri
day and Saturday. However, the
Beavers (21-18,2-4) avoided the sweep
by winning the final game of the series
on Sunday.
Once again, the Cardinal looked to
ride the pitching of freshman Teagan
Gerhart to victory. Gerhart started all
three games of the series, pitching a
total of 19.2 innings over three days.
In the first game of the series, Stan
ford built a four-run lead in the fourth
and fifth innings off Oregon State pitch
er Paige Hall. In the fourth inning, the
Card was able to score due to two field
ing errors, both committed by Beaver
shortstop Nikki Chandler. Though
Stanford left two runners on base, soph
omore second baseman Ashley Hansen
and freshman shortstop Jenna Rich
scored in the inning.
In the fifth inning, Stanford added
two more runs to its lead with three hits
in the inning.
However, Oregon State refused to
go down easily and attempted to mount
a comeback in the sixth inning. The
Beavers hit two home runs off Gerhart
a two-run shot by designated player
Audrey Roderfeld and a solo homer by
first baseman Ally Kutz.
Unfortunately for Oregon State, it
was not enough to close the gap the
Beavers were only able to amass three
runs. The game ended with a final score

of 4-3.
Saturday's game was equally close,
decided by a margin of one run. The
game was a classic pitcher's duel, pitting
Gerhart against Hall for the second
straight contest.
Gerhart allowed only three hits in
seven innings while striking out five,
while Hall allowed five hits and gar
nered three strikeouts.
At the end, Gerhart outlasted Hall
once again, as the Stanford offense
eked out a run in the fifth inning. Field
ing lapses hurt the Beavers, as an error
allowed Stanford to score its only run,
which went into the books as unearned.
The final score of the game was a close
1-0.
After two low-scoring contests, the
third game was markedly different. The
two teams combined for 18 runs, with
Oregon State taking the game 10-8 on
the back of a huge six-run rally in the
fifth inning off the pitching of Gerhart
and Rich.
In the final game of the series, the
Beaver offense finally figured out how
to get hits off the previously invincible
Gerhart. In 5.2 innings, she gave up 10
hits and seven runs, all earned. In 0.1 in
nings, Rich was also unable to staunch
Oregon State's offense, giving up three
runs on three hits.
After delivering eight runs of sup
port through the first five innings, the
Cardinal offense found itself unable to
close the gap with the Beavers. Hall shut
it out in the final two innings to preserve
the win for the Beavers.
Senior catcher Rosey Neill was the
offensive star for Stanford she had
two hits and four RBIs in three at-bats.
Sophomore right fielder Maya Burns
was also a big contributor, going 1-3
with two RBIs.
The Cardinal will continue Pac-10
competition next weekend against No.
3 Arizona. The Wildcats (32-7, 2-4)
were recently swept by Washington,
the No. 1 team in the nation.
