## Tennis takes down two Pac-10 rivals Cardinal trounces Ducks, Huskies over weekend 
### JACK DUANE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With three matches left to go in
the regular season, the Stanford
men's tennis team continued its
dominance on the court. This week
end, the Cardinal (15-5,4-1 Pac-10)
thrashed Pac-10 rivals Washington
and Oregon, 6-1 and 7-0 respective
ly, to extend its winning streak to
four matches.
"We're trying to get a little better
each match," said head coach John
Whitlinger. "Our guys know that our
best tennis is still ahead of us."
On Friday, Stanford led No. 22
Washington from start to finish
under blue skies, though the Cardi
nal doubles teams, which have been
phenomenal all year, faced tougher
matchups to clinch the doubles
point.
The freshman squad of Denis Lin
and Matt Kandath handled Tobi
Obenaus and Alex Rosinski, 8-3, but
the UW teams at the first and sec
ond slots challenged the Cardinal.
Sophomores Bradley Klahn and
Ryan Thacher, the nation's top dou
bles team, pulled out a close victory
over Jeevan Nedunchezhiyan and
Kyle McMorrow, 8-6. The pair is now
10-1 in dual matches this season.
Junior Alex Clayton and senior
Richard Wire, ranked No. 31 by the
ITA, went to a tiebreaker to finally
defeat UW's Derek Drabble and
Martin Kildahl, 9-8 (8-6).
The fierce competition of the
doubles matches suggested that
Washington might put up a fight in
the singles and claw its way back
into the match, but the Huskies
proved to be incapable of contend
ing with Stanford's robust singles
lineup.

No. 5 Klahn beat Ne
dunchezhiyan in straight sets, 6-2,6-
1 to set the tone for the rest of the

day. Soon after Klahn's match
ended, junior Greg Hirshman fin
ished off a 6-2, 6-4 victory over
Aaron Clissold in the sixth slot.

Hirshman, a self -described
"pretty scrappy" player, is now 14-2
in dual matches this season. The jun
ior is also undefeated at home this
year and undefeated while playing
in the sixth spot.
Whitlinger juggled the singles
lineup for the Washington match,
moving Thacher up to the second
spot and moving Clayton down to
the third spot.
"I just wanted to see how certain
guys would react in different posi
tions," Whitlinger said. Both players
reacted with two-set victories.
No. 93 Thacher clinched the team
match with a two-set triumph over
Washington freshman McMorrow,
6-2,7-6 (4).
No. 45 Clayton defeated Drabble,
6-4,6-4.

Kandath won his third consecu
tive match since returning to the sin
gles lineup, 6-1,7-6 (10-8).
Stanford's only loss on the day
came at the hands of Kildahl, who
defeated freshman Lin in a third-set
tiebreaker after the team match had
been clinched, 3-7,7-5,1-0 (13-11).
On Saturday, Stanford celebrat
ed Senior Day with a 7-0 sweep of
No. 72 Oregon in windy conditions.
Richard Wire and Paul Morrissey
were honored before the match and
took down their nameplates from
the scoreboard in a ceremony after
the victory.
Morrissey has been sidelined
with a leg injury all year. He served
as the team's honorary volunteer as
sistant coach for Saturday's match.
Richard Wire, a four-year starter,
has witnessed the resurgence of
Stanford tennis during his career.
In 2007, when Wire was a fresh
man, the Cardinal limped to an 8-16
record. Since that losing season.
Wire has seen Stanford return to its
traditional status as a Pac-10 power
house and a national title contender.
"We got more confident over the
years and learned how to play in
close matches against top teams,"
Wire said.
The veteran Wire was the story
of the day, with victories in both of
his matches. Wire and Clayton
were beating Oregon's Ric
Mortera and Nico Bjerke 6-4 when
the doubles point was clinched.
Wire played in the third spot for
singles and coasted to a 6-3,6-3 vic
tory over Mortera.
"It was bittersweet," Wire said.
"I've had so much fun playing at
Stanford so I was sad that it's end
ing, but I played really well and I
got to be coached by one of my best
friends, [Morrissey]."
The Cardinal didn't lose a set
against Oregon in doubles or sin
gles.
Klahn and Thacher defeated

Alexander Cornelissen and Mar
cos Verdasco 8-4. Junior Ted Kelly
and freshman Walker Kehrer de
feated Aaron Clissold and Douglas
Mayeda, 8-2.
Klahn, Clayton, Lin, Kandath
and Hirshman all won their singles
matches in straight sets.

The Cardinal will look to extend
its four-match winning streak
against Santa Clara on Tuesday and
San Francisco on Wednesday. Both
matches will be played at home.
