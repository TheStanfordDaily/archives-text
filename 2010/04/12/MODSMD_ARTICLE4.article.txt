# Cardona and Wharton win Exec
## Pair beats graduate student slate by 500 
### NIKHIL JOSHI SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Angelina Cardona' 11 and Kelsei Wharton 'l2
beat out five other slates to win the position of
ASSU executive on Saturday, defeating Ryan
Peacock and Jonathan Bakke, both doctoral stu
dents in chemical engineering, in the final round
of runoff voting by a margin of more than 500
votes.
Cardona and Wharton are the latest in a line
of executives who have adopted the mold of an
ASSU that attempts to tackle broad student life
issues dealing with public service and campus
wellness.
Two years ago, Jonny Dorsey 'OB and Fagan
Harris 'OB were elected on a mandate of trans
forming the ASSU into a "big picture" student
government. Last spring, David Gobaud, a
Dorsey-Harris cabinet member and coterminal
student in computer science, was elected presi
dent after running on a platform that continued
many of the priorities of his predecessor.
Cardona, who served as co-chief of staff and
wellness chairperson for the Dorsey-Harris ad
ministration, told The Daily it was a call from
Dorsey and Harris that led her to declare her
candidacy in this election.
Juniors Thorn Scher and Stephanie Werner
came in third on Saturday, followed by G
MRDA juniors Austin Guzman and Patrick Ma
honey, Katherine Heflin 'll and Dan Leifer 'lO
of the No Rain Campaign and Two Dope Boys in
a Caddylack Billy Kemper 'll and Josh Meisel
â€¢12.
Undergraduates, who turned out in far
greater numbers than graduates, ruled the polls,
leaving even Peacock unsurprised at the results.
"I mean, it turned out about how I figured. I
predicted about a 600-vote [difference]," Pea
cock said on Saturday. "Last night we saw the
grad turnout... we were hoping for turnout
more like two years ago. When we saw 1,900
[graduate votes], the writing was on the wall."
While David Gobaud paved the path to the
ASSU presidency for graduate students, Pea
cock and Bakke ran a campaign that was very
different from Gobaud's winning campaign with
Jay de la Torre 'lO last year. While Cardona, a
freshman resident assistant in Trancos, and
Wharton, the deputy chair of the Undergraduate
Senate, covered undergraduate residences with
flyers, t-shirts and word of mouth, Peacock and
Bakke, both doctoral students, relied mainly on
electronic campaigning.
When Gobaud won last year's election, he
had spent a full year working with Dorsey and
Harris, and after losing the presidential race two
years ago with a coterminal student, Greg Gold
gof, as his running mate, Gobaud partnered with
undergraduate de la Torre.
De la Torre stepped down in November after
he was suspended for one quarter for cheating in
