# Cardona and Wharton win Exec
## Pair beats graduate student slate by 500 
### NIKHIL JOSHI SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Angelina Cardona' 11 and Kelsei Wharton 'l2
beat out five other slates to win the position of
ASSU executive on Saturday, defeating Ryan
Peacock and Jonathan Bakke, both doctoral stu
dents in chemical engineering, in the final round
of runoff voting by a margin of more than 500
votes.
Cardona and Wharton are the latest in a line
of executives who have adopted the mold of an
ASSU that attempts to tackle broad student life
issues dealing with public service and campus
wellness.
Two years ago, Jonny Dorsey 'OB and Fagan
Harris 'OB were elected on a mandate of trans
forming the ASSU into a "big picture" student
government. Last spring, David Gobaud, a
Dorsey-Harris cabinet member and coterminal
student in computer science, was elected presi
dent after running on a platform that continued
many of the priorities of his predecessor.
Cardona, who served as co-chief of staff and
wellness chairperson for the Dorsey-Harris ad
ministration, told The Daily it was a call from
Dorsey and Harris that led her to declare her
candidacy in this election.
Juniors Thorn Scher and Stephanie Werner
came in third on Saturday, followed by G
MRDA juniors Austin Guzman and Patrick Ma

â€¢12.
Undergraduates, who turned out in far
greater numbers than graduates, ruled the polls,
leaving even Peacock unsurprised at the results.
"I mean, it turned out about how I figured. I
predicted about a 600-vote [difference]," Pea
cock said on Saturday. "Last night we saw the
grad turnout... we were hoping for turnout
more like two years ago. When we saw 1,900
[graduate votes], the writing was on the wall."
While David Gobaud paved the path to the
ASSU presidency for graduate students, Pea
cock and Bakke ran a campaign that was very
different from Gobaud's winning campaign with
Jay de la Torre 'lO last year. While Cardona, a
freshman resident assistant in Trancos, and
Wharton, the deputy chair of the Undergraduate
Senate, covered undergraduate residences with
flyers, t-shirts and word of mouth, Peacock and
Bakke, both doctoral students, relied mainly on
electronic campaigning.
When Gobaud won last year's election, he
had spent a full year working with Dorsey and
Harris, and after losing the presidential race two
years ago with a coterminal student, Greg Gold
gof, as his running mate, Gobaud partnered with
undergraduate de la Torre.
De la Torre stepped down in November after
he was suspended for one quarter for cheating in

a computer science class.
Without a strong undergraduate
base, Peacock and Bakke were forced
to depend on graduate turnout, and
when they couldn't bring enough
graduates to the polls, were unsuc
cessful in their bid for executive.

Scher and Werner, early frontrun
ners and the first serious contenders
to declare their candidacy, were more
than a thousand votes behind Car
dona and Wharton in the first round
of voting.
The pair, who ran on a "students
first" platform, struggled with en
dorsements; they did not win the en
dorsement of The Stanford Review,
which went to Peacock and Bakke, or
SOCC, which went to Cardona and
Wharton. They walked out of an in
terview for The Daily's endorsement,
which also went to Cardona and
Wharton.

Guzman and Mahoney finished
behind Scher and Werner, running on
a practical campaign centered
around helping students with corn

mon problems like theft and party
planning.

The No Rain Campaign, which
waged an untraditional, quirky cam
paign, finished just behind Guzman
and Mahoney; the two slates had the
same number of votes in the first
round, and Guzman and Mahoney
beat them out by just seven votes in
the second round.

Two Dope Boys in a Caddylack,
best known for their rambunctious
debate performance the week prior
to the election, was the last-place
slate, winning only 288 first choice
votes.

After two weeks of campaigning,
the candidates were an exhausted
bunch on Saturday, eager to find out
the results.

"I'm excited exhausted, but ex
cited," said Wharton, the new vice
president. "I woke up about 15 min
utes before this and slowly walked
over here."

Wharton's running mate, Car
dona, who will become president on
April 24, shares his excitement.
"I'm excited to celebrate tonight
and also get to work," Cardona said.
