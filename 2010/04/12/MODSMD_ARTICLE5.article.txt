## SOCC takes ten ASSU Senate seats SUN coalition wins four seats, final candidate is unaffiliated 
### ELLEN HUET DESK EDITOR 
Candidates endorsed by the Students of
Color Coalition (SOCC) won a majority of
seats in the ASSU Undergraduate Senate on
Saturday as undergraduate voters elected 10
of 12 coalition members to next year's legisla
tive body.

Four candidates from the Students United
Now (SUN) coalition and one other candi
date were elected.
The last time SOCC-endorsed candidates
controlled this many seats in the Senate was in
2006, when 10 of SOCC's endorsed candi
dates were elected. Seven SOCC-endorsed
candidates won in each of the 2007,2008 and
2009 elections.
SOCC-endorsed candidates elected on

Saturday are, in order of highest to lowest
number of votes: Madeline Hawes 'l3, Deepa
Kannappan 'l3, incumbent Michael Cruz 'l2,
Juany Torres 'l3, Ben Jensen 'l2, Daniel Kha
lessi 'l3, Rafael Vasquez 'l2, Kamil Saeid 'l3,
Robin Perani 'l3 and Pat Bruny 'l3, who was
the lowest elected vote-getter of the race with
797 votes.
Four candidates from the SUN coalition
were elected with more votes than Bruny, in
cluding freshmen Will Seaton, Stewart Mac
gregor-Dennis, Rebecca Sachs and Carolyn
Simmons. Seaton is a Daily sports writer.
The last candidate elected to the Senate,
Khaled Alshawi 'l3, was not affiliated with ei
ther group. Alshawi received 815 votes.
Hawes, who was elected with 1,159 votes,
credits her victory to the interactions she had
with individual students.
"The conversations I had with people
were very real," Hawes said. "I think that I
came away knowing their needs and
they came away knowing who 1 was."
In an election that traditionally di
vides candidates along endorsement
lines, some incoming senators remain
optimistic about future collaboration.
"Now that we're elected, we're all
united," said Saeid, who was endorsed
by SOCC. "We're all Stanford stu
dents."

"I hope we can all work together
and destroy any biases that we may
have, because I remember that this
year, SBS and SOCC senators didn't
get along," said Torres, who was also
endorsed by SOCC. She was referring
to Students for a Better Stanford, a
2009 Senate candidates coalition. "We
should make sure that SUN and
SOCC candidates will work together
in the upcoming year."
Alshawi said running without the
support of a coalition or endorsement

group presented difficulties as well as
some advantages.
"I definitely had to stay up more
hours and skip more classes to flyer
dorms and get to hall meetings," he
said, but he added that it was "cool" to
be able to say he was running inde
pendently.
The four-person team in the Stu
dents With Experience (S.Ex.) coali
tion, though endorsed by current
ASSU President David Gobaud, a
coterminal student in computer sci
ence, were shut out from the Senate.
Their highest vote-winner, junior
Danny Crichton, placed 18th, 44 votes
shy of a Senate seat.
"We started late in the game," said
Crichton, who is also a columnist for
The Daily. "I think it came down to or
ganization earlier in the race."

Two current senators also credited
SOCC's outreach efforts with con
tributing to the success of its candi
dates.

Senator Shelley Gao 'll, a Daily
columnist, pointed to a "very exten
sive GOTV [get-out-the-vote] effort."
She would not discuss how she be

lieves the dynamics of next year's Sen
ate might reflect endorsements, but
noted that serving as a senator is "very
different than campaigning."

"The results of the election reflect
a particular sentiment within certain
politically active communities on
campus," added Anton Zietsman 'l2,
the current Senate Appropriations
chair, who also emphasized the suc
cess of SOCC at turnout and out
reach. Zietsman said he will be work
ing to maintain "continuity" between
this year's and next year's Senate.
One outgoing senator also high
lighted the difficulties that new sena
tors could face.

"These [newly-elected] senators
don't know what they're getting into,"
said Mohammad Ali 'lO, a current
senator. Ali was elected to the Senate
last year with the highest number of
votes.

Election results are set to be con
firmed at this Tuesday's Senate meet
ing.
