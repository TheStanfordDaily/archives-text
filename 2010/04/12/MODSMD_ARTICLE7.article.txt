Senator-elect Ben Jensen 'l2 said
on Sunday that although he plans to
serve in next year's ASSU Undergrad

Studies Program in Berlin.
The news comes after Jensen signed

not fully enforce the requirement. Two
candidates, Kamil Saeid 'l3 and Milton
Achelpohl 'l3, did not submit declara

he told The Daily he e-mailed Slack a
declaration and is not going abroad.

very vague in the Joint Bylaws, it could
be argued that they did submit a decla
ration of intent by starting a petition,"
Slack wrote in an e-mail to The Daily.
"That's why we let them run without
having submitted one."
The deadline to accept a spot in a
fall quarter overseas program was
March 14, according to an e-mail to
