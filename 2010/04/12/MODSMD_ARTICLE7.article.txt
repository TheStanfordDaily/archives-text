# Newly elected senator to be in Berlin fall quarter
## 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€” Ellen Huet 
Senator-elect Ben Jensen 'l2 said
on Sunday that although he plans to
serve in next year's ASSU Undergrad
uate Senate, he will be abroad fall
quarter at Stanford's Bing Overseas
Studies Program in Berlin.
The news comes after Jensen signed
a declaration of intent in March that
said, in part, that he intended to be on
campus throughout next year.
"I'll be nine hours ahead, so I'll get
up at four or five in the morning to
Skype into meetings," Jensen said.
Last fall, second-term Senator Shel
ley Gao 'll was in the Stanford in
Washington program and used Skype
to video-chat with the Senate during
weekly meetings.
According to Senate Parliamentar
ian Alex Katz 'l2, there are currently
no Senate bylaws or other rules pro
hibiting senators from completing part
of their terms from off-campus loca
tions.
Elections Commissioner Quinn
Slack 'll said candidates were re
quired to sign declarations of intent by
March 18 affirming they would be on
campus throughout their term, except
summer, but that the commission did
not fully enforce the requirement. Two
candidates, Kamil Saeid 'l3 and Milton
Achelpohl 'l3, did not submit declara
tions. Saeid was elected on Saturday;
he told The Daily he e-mailed Slack a
declaration and is not going abroad.
"Since the 'declaration of intent' is
very vague in the Joint Bylaws, it could
be argued that they did submit a decla
ration of intent by starting a petition,"
Slack wrote in an e-mail to The Daily.
"That's why we let them run without
having submitted one."
The deadline to accept a spot in a
fall quarter overseas program was
March 14, according to an e-mail to
program participants. Slack said none
of the candidates who signed declara
tions struck out the on-campus provi
sion of the statement.
Gao's quarter out of state was the
first quarter of her second term as a
senator. She credits having already
spent a year in the Senate as essential
for her ability to handle completing

her term from off-campus, emphasiz
ing that the first few months as a sena
tor have a "steep learning curve" and
that new senators "spend a lot of time
in the Senate just learning how things
are done."
Jensen, who was endorsed by the
Students of Color Coalition (SOCC),
did inform the endorsing group dur
ing the endorsement process about
the possibility of his quarter abroad.
"We knew he had the chance to go
abroad, but he hadn't yet decided
when we interviewed him before
spring break," said Tiq Chapa 'lO, a

member of SOCC leadership. "Other
senators have been abroad during
their terms before, but we know it's
best that senators spend their whole
term on campus."
Chapa is a member of The Daily's
editorial board but did not participate
in the board's ASSU endorsement in
terviews because of his involvement
with SOCC.
The results of the election are up
for confirmation at the Senate meet
ing on Tuesday.
