## The 						Car That Drives Itself 
### TYLER BROWN STAFF WRITER 
In 1984, Michele Mouton was the first
woman to win the Pikes Peak Inter
national Hill Climb a twelve-and
a-half mile race to the Colorado
mountain's summit. About 26 years
later, professor of mechanical engineering
Chris Gerdes and his Dynamic Design Lab
are preparing to run Mouton's namesake, a
white Audi TTS named "Shelley," up the
mountain again.
But this time, there won't be a driver.
Gerdes' team of graduate and Ph.D. stu
dents and Volkswagen's Palo Alto research
lab have spent the last two years conceptu
alizing and modifying the car to make the
solo climb up the Peak.
At this point, Shelley knows enough to
navigate parking lots and racetracks
around Stanford. Rami Hindiyeh, a sec
ond-year doctoral student in mechanical
engineering, said, "the basics are working
pretty well."
But not all systems are "go" yet, and the
car's computerized brain is still being re
fined. At a recent driverless speed test in
Bonneville Salt Flats, Shelley ran into some
problems when she passed 130 miles per
hour.
"Our GPS started giving us some issues
once we started going that fast," Gerdes
said.
Gerdes' team's work is a variation on
one theme: make Shelley drive faster, safer

and smarter.
"The one thing that we're trying to em
phasize with the project is it's extremely
fun to build a robotic racecar, but the goal
is not to have robotic car races replace
racecar drivers," Gerdes said. "The real be
lief is that if we can learn how to control a
car at its very limits of handling, then we
can also help ordinary drivers who enter a
turn too quickly or are driving on a wet
road and don't realize when they need to
brake ... so that's ultimately where we
hope this goes, is safety systems."
Shelley isn't the first of Stanford's robot
cars before the Audi TTS, there was Ju
nior, Stanford's autonomous Volkswagen
Passat.
"Junior was a perceptual challenge,"
Gerdes said. Junior, and its predecessor
Stanley, were designed to perceive the en
vironments around them, understand signs
and recognize the "driving situation" of
nearby vehicles then logically respond
to what they saw.
But Stanley and Junior crept along at
speeds well below the average driver's
comfort level, and there was little emphasis
on driving dynamics.
"They're both autonomous vehicles to
some extent, but they both have very dif
ferent scopes, and I guess you could say,
very different personalities as well,"
Gerdes said.
Gerdes' group wanted to avoid doing
what they had done before, and wanted to
push technology forward in other areas.

"Can we go around turns as fast as pos
sible, brake at the last possible minute, can
we accelerate out as soon as they're steer
ing out of a turn?" Gerdes said, listing what
the team is working to perfect in Shelley.
Hindiyeh has the task of crafting Shel
ley's "judgment." He writes software de
signed to mimic a rally car driver's mind
with a series of mathematical analyses that
predict how the car should control itself in
different situations. Currently, he looks at
"ways to slide Shelley through turns like a
rally car racer would."
Mick Kritayakirana, a third-year gradu
ate student in mechanical engineering, is in
charge of working to control Shelley "at
the limits, kind of like racecar drivers race
on the pavement," he said. He is working
on the autonomous racing controller.
The standard Audi TTS's steering,
brakes, gears and throttle are all controlled
electronically, so Shelley required few me
chanical modifications by Gerdes' re
search team to integrate her systems into a
"controller area network," that allows the
vehicle's components to communicate.The
network allows the team to individually
switch each component from manual to au
tomatic so they can test its reliability.
Shelley's most critical components are a
rack of GPS antennas coupled to a system
that determines speed and sideways mo
tion. It controls the car's direction when
the GPS can't connect with the satellites,
and gives prompt updates on the car's posi
tion.

Yet while the combined effects of Shel
ley's systems are complex, the computer in
the car's trunk that processes these data
isn't any faster than one you could buy a
decade ago. Most calculations are done
separately within the GPS and in the vehi
cle electronics.
"We don't need a whole lot of computa
tional power to run the driving and racing
algorithms," Gerdes said.
Testing Shelley today usually means
having a safety driver in the cockpit, in case
something goes awry with one of its elec
tronic systems. In the near future, however,
the team hopes Shelley will be able to flaw
lessly navigate solo.
"We have to spend a lot of time trying to
make the car listen to what we command,"
Kritayakirana said.
The Pikes Peak course will be plotted
on a GPS map for the car to follow, and
based on that information and how much
friction the computer predicts, it has an
idea of how fast it can take turns at differ
ent angles and with varying road surfaces.
The computer refines its speed and steer
ing with each test turn to figure out what
Gerdes calls Shelley's "braking point."
David Hoffert, a second-year graduate
student in mechanical engineering, ex
plained that Shelley tries to model what a
human being would do and plan ahead,
with a safety net so that "when we screw up,
[it makes] the appropriate correction."
"When a human is driving a car and
they see a turn coming up, they can just try

to, at a constant rate, so to speak, just try to
turn the wheel towards that curve preemp
tively," Hoffert said. "And that works be
cause roads are designed with certain
mathematical geometric properties that if
you do that, [you] follow the path."
As Gerdes' team nears the finish line,
they are continuing to closely collaborate
with Volkswagen's research group. They
have "weekly meetings where we talk
about our current status ... and evaluate
the hardware and software," said Marcial
Hernandez, senior research engineer at
Volkswagen.
Gerdes' team aims to have Shelley on
the mountain in September, right before
the start of fall quarter.
"We'd really like to send the car pretty
close to its capability, certainly much, much
faster than people would be comfortable
driving unless they were highly skilled
racecar drivers," Gerdes said.
