## FACES welcomes delegates to campus conference 
### IVY NGUYEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Delegates from China and across the United
States converged at Stanford this week to attend
FACES's 2010 conference on U.S.-China relations,
entitled "On Common Ground."
The five-day event features experts on U.S.-
China relations from across the country, including
Hoover Institution fellows and a former director
of the World Bank.
FACES, which stands for "Forum for Ameri
can/Chinese Exchange at Stanford," is a student
led organization whose mission is to "improve the
future of U.S.-China relations by fostering person
al relationships and understanding among future
leaders in the United States and China," wrote Lil
iana Chan-Hou 'll, the FACES vice president of
development, in an e-mail to The Daily.
The organization was founded in 2001 and has
hosted a total of eight conferences to date.
At this year's FACES conference there are 20
Chinese delegates hailing from universities locat
ed in Tsinghua, Peking, Fudan, Remin and Zhe
jiangm, according to Kimberly Cheng 'lO, the

FACES vice president of N
marketing. Another 20 are
from top American col
leges, including Cornell,
Harvard, UNC-Chapel Hill
and UC-Berkeley.

While many of the confer
ence attendees have backgrounds in international
relations, the conference organizers tried to select
delegates with different backgrounds, such as en
gineering and history, to incorporate different
points of view into the discussion, Cheng said.
Many members of FACES are of Chinese de
scent, but the conference also welcomes a large
number of non-Chinese attendees who are inter
ested in China and U.S.-China relations.

According to Sherry Wang 'l3, a member of the
FACES programming committee for this confer
ence, attendees will discuss topics ranging from
dating and sex in China to the debate over nuclear
weapons.

"We try to give students in the U.S. and China a
chance to exchange ideas, talk about U.S.-China
relations and connect to each other," Wang said.
"This is so that when they become future leaders,

they will have perspectives
from different groups of peo
, pie."
Despite the sensitive

nature of political discussion in
China, Cheng said FACES does not censor or
avoid any controversial topic, pointing to a semi
nar in last year's conference discussing Tibet, one
of the most heated issues in U.S.-China relations.
"The Chinese delegates come to Stanford
knowing full well that we talk openly about issues
on U.S.-China relations and it's very much uncen
sored," Cheng said. "We don't shy away from con
troversial topics at all."
The conference continues through Thursday,
April 15.
