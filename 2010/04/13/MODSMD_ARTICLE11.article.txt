# OPINIONS
## JUST A THOUGHT It's all Greek to me... 
### Nikola Milanovic 
The first couple weeks of spring have ar
rived, and with them has come a time
many love and fear, popularly known as
Rush. These coming weeks will provide stu
dents with the opportunity to bromance,
speed-date, judge and be judged. And at the
end of the process, there will be "winners" and
"losers" and an opportunity to consider who
one's real friends are. Awesome.
Stanford offers a diverse selection of Greek
organizations, with 16 fraternities and 12 soror
ities (seven and three housed, respectively).
Many represent specific interests or cultures,
such as the Jewish AEPi or the traditionally
athletic Kappa Alpha. For all those interested,
the next few weeks will give students the op
portunity to learn about the houses they can
join and what kind of scene they cater to.
I remember rushing and joining my frater
nity two years ago, and in retrospect, that side
of the process was daunting. A word of advice
going into it: be honest with yourself about
why you are rushing.There are many good rea
sons to look into joining the Greek scene, and
there are also many bad ones.
Put simply, joining a fraternity or sorority
will allow you some opportunities. It will allow
you to guarantee living with some of your
friends. It will introduce you to an entirely new
social scene and culture. It will let you make new
friends you would never have made otherwise.
Joining the Greek scene will not make you
more interesting. It will not make you thinner
or more muscular. It will not boost your GPA,
clear up your acne, make you inherently more
fun to be around or compensate for any of the
above. It may attract people to you, but it will
not necessarily make you a more attractive
person.

Joining a fraternity or sorority is away to
boost your social status a pretty good way. It
will give you the competitive edge in the cut
throat world of social hierarchies. Much like
college and job applications, the Rush process
is a contest of selling oneself effectively in order
to be granted entrance into an elite organiza
tion. Brotherhood and sisterhood come with
the privilege of leveraging that social resume
bullet point against others in the ongoing pop
ularity contest known affectionately as "life."
This sounds jaded. Sorry. Unfortunately, it's
an accurate concern for the Stanford Greek
scene, just as it is at most other schools.This cri
tique does not apply to all the fraternal and
sororal organizations at Stanford, but it does
apply to many.The simple truth is that these so
cial groups tend to engender shallowness.
Luckily, this effect can be easily sidestepped by
adhering to one rule: don't let your fraternity
or sorority become your identity.
I forgot that rule for a while. My guess is

that many people, enamored with the social ac
creditation that comes from joining a house, in
dulge in their new status by defining them
selves according to their fraternity or sorority.
It's the hazard of becoming comfortable with
this mentality that produces "fake" people in
the Greek scene.
The benefit of an amazing school like Stan
ford is the diversity of experiences, back
grounds, interests and qualifications that make
us as students so interesting. Nobody needs to
join a sorority or fraternity to be interesting,
but people occasionally forget this and make
their defining feature their Greek affiliation.
"Hi, I'm Nik I'm in X-Fraternity."
Aside from the cynical commentary and
minor self-deprecation (I'm actually a pretty
ebullient, optimistic person), the one point I
want to stress is to take your newfound social
categorization with a grain of salt. We are all
fascinating people for a multitude of reasons
and for the various facets that make up our
personalities don't invest too much of your
social stake in joining a fraternity or sorority. It
will give you an automatic icebreaker at a
party (on par with "I'm captain of this athletic
team" or "I'm president of this club"), but it
won't contribute to who you are.
That being said, I want to encourage every
one who is thinking of doing so to rush. The
process is entertaining and exciting, and gives
students a fantastic opportunity to evaluate
what kind of living and social situation they
want to find themselves in for the coming year.
But of all the reasons you have for rushing a
Greek organization, please don't prioritize the
opportunity to boost your social status. In
some cases this admittedly condescending ad
vice will fall on deaf ears, but hopefully people
have the introspective capacity to understand
that they don't need to be Greek to feel secure
about their social merits.
For all the eager and curious people out
there looking to join a fraternity, I hope to see
you at Rush. And for all you social statisticians
and intrepid scalers of the popularity pyramid,
I'll see you there too.

Take all this with a grain of salt, or else it's only
gonna break, break your break, break your
heart. Nik is the Inter-Fraternity Council Presi
