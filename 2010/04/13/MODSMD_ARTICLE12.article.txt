# BROADLY SPEAKING
## When No One Watches the Watchdog 
### Molly Spaeth 
Well, I'm back. And I'm nervous.
I'm nervous because it's my first column in two
months; I'm nervous because I just drank three cups
of coffee; but most of all, I'm nervous because I'm
about to criticize the organization that just gave me
my voice back.
And as we saw last week, the Daily Editorial
Board doesn't exactly respond well to criticism.
As I swallow my fourth cup of coffee (and hope
fully some courage), I'd like to remind you of the
three major independent reporting publications on
campus and the roles they play in promoting trans
parency and accountability both within the ASSU
and the University at large. The Stanford Progres
sive and The Stanford Review, while absolutely
fundamental in promoting campus dialogue, repre
sent two of the smaller publications and are admit
tedly influenced by particular ideological leanings.
The Stanford Daily, on the other hand, has staked
its reputation on being the preeminent and largest
objective independent reporting institution on
campus. The paper plays an absolutely fundamental
role in playing watchdog over campus life, perhaps
falling only behind the ASSU in its power and its
clout.
Last week, the Editorial Board announced its en
dorsement of Cardona-Wharton for ASSU Execu
tive, Whether or not you agree with whom they en
dorsed is frankly irrelevant; at the end of the en
dorsement it was harder to tell why exactly they sup
ported Cardona-Wharton in terms of anything other
than the fact that they weren't Thorn and Stephanie
[Ed. Note: a competing executive slate ]. Instead of ad
hering to the responsibilities of what any sentient
being would assume is the Editorial Board's job
(namely, providing a largely uninformed student
electorate with fair and accurate information illumi
nating why a specific slate was best suited for the
job), the Editorial Board used two of the editorial's
seven total paragraphs detailing in very explicit ad
jectives (petty, vindictive, unfortunate, refusal, unbe
coming) why a slate it did not even interview would
represent the very stagnation of effectiveness within
the ASSU as we know it. This argument was made
not on the basis of substantive, tangible points like
their platform (which the Editorial Board admitted
was quite good) but on the basis of their "petty vin
dictiveness." Furthermore, this evaluation of their
character was made not through an interview (which
Thorn and Stephanie declined) but on the basis of
petty assumptions.
Thom and Stephanie's very act of refusing the in
terview for the Daily endorsement put a negligible
crack in the Editorial Board's monolithic credibility.

But that negligible crack became a crushing self-in
flicted blow when the Editorial Board disguised its
own disingenuous attempt to defend its institutional
credibility as an endorsement for Cardona-Wharton.
In resorting to the same level of petty politics they
claimed was espoused by Thorn and Stephanie, the
Editorial Board sacrificed not only their credibility,
but also its integrity.

The bigger lesson here is not so much who the
Daily Editorial Board endorsed or who it didn't, but
that it completely overstepped its boundaries and
used its power not to educate, but to deprecate. The
Daily may be by far the biggest independent report
ing publication on campus, but that doesn't mean it
has any right to not be held accountable for its actions.
When the power of The Stanford Daily, an institution
whose importance in influencing student affairs is
comparable to the ASSU but whose leadership is not
elected by the greater student body, remains
unchecked, any hope for accountability in student
governance as a whole is put in jeopardy. If the watch
dog can't even hold itself accountable, how can we ex
pect it to hold any single other aspect of this Univer
sity accountable?

This criticism is, more than anything, a plea. A plea
for accountability, a plea for objectivity and most of
all a plea that the members of the Editorial Board re
member not only what their responsibilities are, but
who they are to. The Editorial Board wields an enor
mous amount of power, but they need to remember
that this power is given to them with the caveat that
it be used responsibly. In the "petty vindictiveness" of
their last endorsement, the Editorial Board in
evitably perpetuated exactly that which they were
trying to avoid: a blow to their credibility. It is now
time that the members of the Editorial Board check
their own egos and realize that they have a far greater
responsibility to the student body, to decent journal
ism and to their own human integrity to be funda
mentally better than petty politics.

Molly has (hopefully) started writing again for the
Daily. However, if she's not here next week, she either
got silenced by the Editorial Board or went into the
WPP. Shoot her an e-mail at mspaeth@stanford.edu.
