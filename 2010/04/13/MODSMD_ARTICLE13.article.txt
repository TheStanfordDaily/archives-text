## FINISHING STRONG Card place tenth with solid final day 
### JENNY PETER STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford women's golf team
finished strong in the last round of the
PING ASU Invitational last weekend
to secure 10th place at the Karsten
Course inTempe,Ariz.The Cardinal's
top-10 finish is respectable because
Stanford had to contend with nine of
the top 12 teams in the nation. UCLA
finished first at the 54-hole tourna
ment with an 856 (eight under par),
overcoming host Arizona State (857, -
7) by one shot. USC (858, -6), New
Mexico (863,-1) and Purdue (864)
placed third, fourth and fifth, respec
tively. Stanford was 20 strokes behind
the leaders with a 12-over 876.
Stanford had a rough first round
that motivated the team to fight back
even harder during the second and
third rounds. After shooting a nine
over-par 297 in the first round, the
Cardinal got progressively better,
carding a 291 the second day and a
288 the last day of the tournament.
The 10-stroke improvement from day
one to day three gives the Cardinal
golfers confidence in their ability to
redeem themselves, but the team
would rather not need a comeback in
the first place.
"We proved to ourselves that we can
shoot solid team scores... now we just
need to do it for three straight days,"
said junior Rebecca Durham.
"The course is extremely scorable
in that it's relatively short," said head
coach Caroline O'Connor. "Howev
er, the wind can really make it tough.
Additionally, the desert had a very
wet winter so growing conditions
have been ideal. Consequently, the
rough adjacent to the fairways and
around the greens is long and thick.
Driving accuracy [was] important this
week as well as placement on and

around the greens."
The team procured 16 birdies the
second day and 14 birdies the last day.
"We made enough birdies to go
deep, but we need to eliminate some
of the bogeys," Durham said.

In addition to a few birdies on her
card, Durham also had the personal
highlight of chipping the ball in on a
par-five for eagle. She was in 55th with
a 76 after the opening day of the tour
nament, and then moved to 37th after

shooting an even-par 72 the second
day. Durham finished 38th (222) with
a final round 74, helping to lead Stan
ford with her consistency and experi
ence with the course.
The Stanford freshmen performed

well and galvanized the team with
their low scoring and quick adjust
ment to the course, Sally Watson shot
a final round 69 to finish in eighth
place (212), five strokes behind
Stephanie Kono of UCLA (207), who
finished in first at nine under par.
Krishna Wong of Stanford also fared
well with a final round 71 to clinch
29th place (219).
Senior captain Angela King tied for
46th with a 224 and sophomore Syd
ney Burlison tied for 75th at a 233.
Stanford will go into the Pac-10
Championships next week with the
goal of starting off stronger and put
ting itself in a better position to win.
"The difference between us and
the top five teams in the nation is
shrinking," Durham said. "We're
peaking at the right time."
The Pac-10 Championships are
scheduled for April 19-21 at the Eu
gene Country Club.
