# CARD EXTENDS STREAK
## 
### WILL SEATON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The No. 11 Stanford women's
tennis team (17-1, 6-0 Pac-10)
turned its attention north for a
three-game road trip last weekend
and returned with wins over Wash
ington State (12-13, 1-6), No. 25
Washington (10-6,2-5) and Oregon
(7-15,1-7).
Heading into the last weekend of
the regular season, the women have
only lost one match all season,
against UCLA on the road, and are
on a 10-match winning streak. This
streak has really highlighted Stan
ford's strength at the bottom of its
lineup, and this strength was put on
display all weekend.
The first match took place at
Washington State, where the
women recorded a 5-2 victory. Stan
ford swept through the doubles,
highlighted by an 8-0 victory at the
top spot by the nation's No. 2 team
of junior Hilary Barte and senior
Lindsay Burdette. While both expe
rienced a few struggles over the
weekend, their doubles play has
been as flawless as ever.
Barte dropped only her second
match in dual play this season, the
first coming against USC's Maria
Sanchez the weekend before. She
lost 6-4, 6-0 to unranked Elisabeth
Fournier. She says that the loss to
Sanchez was still weighing on her
mind while she played.
"It was weird," Barte said. "I was
just still thinking about the USC
match. It was still annoying me I
was still pretty bothered so mental
ly I just wasn't there. It's obviously
really tough to play in those kinds of
conditions."
Burdette also lost a tough three
setter 4-6,6-2,6-2 to No. 94 Liudmi
la Vasilieva, but the rest of the line
up won fairly convincingly. At the
No. 3, 5 and 6 spots, Stanford
dropped a combined four games. In
the four spot, Stacey Tan came back
from a set down to defeat Andjela
Kankaras 4-6,6-1,6-2.
Next, No. 25 Washington proved
to be the closest match the Cardinal
has faced all year. Stanford edged
the Huskies in the end 4-3, but only
after losing the first set in every sin
gle match except Mallory Bur-

dette's. She and Stacey Tan lost at
No. 2 doubles, but Stanford pulled
out the doubles point with wins at
spots one and three. Once singles
came, it was an all-out brawl for the
victory. Mallory Burdette pulled out
the only straight-sets win despite
being down initially in the first set.
"I started to focus on my court
more and so I took care of business
in my match," Mallory Burdette
said. "But as I got done and started
looking around, everyone had lost
their first sets. They just all started to
turn it around. Everyone played
super well and it showed that even
when we're getting beaten, the
other person is having to play really
well and it's hard to keep that up."
With the doubles point already
in their pocket, the women needed
to tough out three more wins to
have the day. Mallory swept through
her opponent 6-4, 6-2 to be first off
the court. Barte was the next to fin
ish, turning her play around to de
feat her opponent No. 17 Venise
Chan 2-6,6-3,6-1. With Stanford up
3-0, Veronica Li lost in straight sets
7-6 (5), 6-1 to give Washington its
first point. Just afterward. Tan
closed out the match with a 5-7,6-2,
6-2 performance to clinch.
"It was probably one of my fa

vorite matches of the year," Barte
said. "We needed to be feisty and of
course they were trying to protect
their home court. In my match,
when I lost the first set, I just decid
ed it was a new day. I stormed back
in the second set and, once we split
sets, I knew it was really close so I
had to pull my match out."
After surviving a scare, Stanford
routed Oregon 7-0 to finish off the
weekend. The Cardinal won all the
doubles and singles matches in
straight sets, with the closest match
coming at No. 2 doubles as Mallory
Burdette and Tan won 8-7 (7-4). No
Cardinal player lost more than four
games in a singles match.The team's
motivation for the match came from
the imminent arrival back on the
Farm.
"We were all pretty tired by the
time Oregon came around," Barte
said. "Our motto for Oregon was
that we could smell home so get up
for [the match] and win and it ener
gized us in that way."
"We were all tired it was the
last match of the series and we were
ready to get home," Mallory Bur
dette added. "A 7-0 sounds great,
but usually that doesn't happen so it
was cool to go out there and win
every match."
A successful weekend highlight
ed by Stanford's closest match yet
will be great motivation going into
this upcoming weekend, as senior
captain Lindsay Burdette plays her
last match against Cal on Senior
Night.

to be the closest match the Cardinal
has faced all year. Stanford edged
the Huskies in the end 4-3, but only
after losing the first set in every sin
gle match except Mallory Bur-

dette's. She and Stacey Tan lost at
No. 2 doubles, but Stanford pulled
out the doubles point with wins at
spots one and three. Once singles
came, it was an all-out brawl for the
victory. Mallory Burdette pulled out
the only straight-sets win despite
being down initially in the first set.
"I started to focus on my court
more and so I took care of business
in my match," Mallory Burdette
said. "But as I got done and started
looking around, everyone had lost
their first sets. They just all started to
turn it around. Everyone played
super well and it showed that even
when we're getting beaten, the
other person is having to play really
well and it's hard to keep that up."
With the doubles point already
in their pocket, the women needed
to tough out three more wins to
have the day. Mallory swept through
her opponent 6-4, 6-2 to be first off
the court. Barte was the next to fin
ish, turning her play around to de
feat her opponent No. 17 Venise
Chan 2-6,6-3,6-1. With Stanford up
3-0, Veronica Li lost in straight sets
7-6 (5), 6-1 to give Washington its
first point. Just afterward. Tan
closed out the match with a 5-7,6-2,
6-2 performance to clinch.
"It was probably one of my fa

vorite matches of the year," Barte
said. "We needed to be feisty and of
course they were trying to protect
their home court. In my match,
when I lost the first set, I just decid
ed it was a new day. I stormed back
in the second set and, once we split
sets, I knew it was really close so I
had to pull my match out."
After surviving a scare, Stanford
routed Oregon 7-0 to finish off the
weekend. The Cardinal won all the
doubles and singles matches in
straight sets, with the closest match
coming at No. 2 doubles as Mallory
Burdette and Tan won 8-7 (7-4). No
Cardinal player lost more than four
games in a singles match.The team's
motivation for the match came from
the imminent arrival back on the
Farm.
"We were all pretty tired by the
time Oregon came around," Barte
said. "Our motto for Oregon was
that we could smell home so get up
for [the match] and win and it ener
gized us in that way."
"We were all tired it was the
last match of the series and we were
ready to get home," Mallory Bur
dette added. "A 7-0 sounds great,
but usually that doesn't happen so it
was cool to go out there and win
every match."
A successful weekend highlight
ed by Stanford's closest match yet
will be great motivation going into
this upcoming weekend, as senior
captain Lindsay Burdette plays her
last match against Cal on Senior
Night.
