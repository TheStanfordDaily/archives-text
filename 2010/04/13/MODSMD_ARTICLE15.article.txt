# Tiger media circus dominates the Masters
## 
### Kabir Sawhney 
As the results from the
final round of the Mas
ters came in on Sunday,
the sports media dutiful
ly covered the fact that
Tiger Woods had won another green
jacket. After all the media hype sur
rounding the event, which marked
Tiger's return to professional golf after
the sex scandal that consumed his life
last winter, it was only justified that
Tiger should win...

Wait, what's that? Phil Mickelson
actually won the event, for his third
green jacket?
OK, so I'll admit that the major
media outlets did grudgingly agree to
suspend their "all Tiger, all the time"
approach when he didn't actually win
the event. However, the extreme over
dose on Tiger coverage rivaled Heath
Ledger's (too soon?), and left me pret
ty sick.
To take one example, ESPN ran
coverage of Tiger's practice putting on
Thursday, the first day of the event.The
majority of the golfers in the event are
lucky to get on TV for a stroke or two,
and yet here was ESPN's entire crew
virtually fixated on just one golfer who
hadn't actually done anything in the
event yet.

As the Masters continued into Fri
day, the Tiger bonanza didn't diminish
if anything, it picked up speed. In
the recaps all over the Internet, arti
cles obsessed over Tiger's position and
mentioned the actual leader, Fred
Couples, only at the tail end. On
Sports Center, broadcasters always
mentioned Tiger and his position first.
I suppose it's just a silly notion to
think that the athlete who's actually
winning, not the one with the celebri
ty, should get the media accolades.

Even as the cut was made and the
event shifted to CBS, the Tiger binge
refused to slow down. His every shot
was watched and carefully catego
rized, with the announcers dissecting
his every move in painstaking (and
painful) detail.
At times it felt like the golf itself
was just a sideshow.There were stories
on the event from such prominent
sporting web sites as E! Online.
Who cares about the sport when
we can watch a celebrity instead and
gleefully follow the cult of personality
that has surrounded Tiger for so long?
I was incredibly relieved when
Mickelson won the event and the
sports media was finally forced to ac
knowledge that golf had actually been
played and that yes, Woods had ac-

tually failed to win and complete his
glorious comeback. In Golfxom's
final recap, Woods only merited men
tion twice: first, along with the other
golfers he ended up tied for fourth
with, and in a short paragraph about
how he began the week as the most
prominent storyline of the Masters.
Of course, Mickelson had a story of
his own, obscured by the whirlwind
that had surrounded Tiger over the
course of the tournament. Both his
wife. Amy, and his mother, Mary, are
currently undergoing treatment for
breast cancer. As Mickelson has spent
more time with his family and away
from golf, his game has suffered
somewhat, but his return to Augusta
and his victory in this event was every
bit as significant and emotionally up
lifting as a win for Tiger would have
been. I certainly like Mickelson's
story I think it's far superior to the
sordid details of Tiger's life.
Admittedly, I'm happy that Mick
elson won for another reason â€”it
prevented the nearly unfathomable
media orgy that would have occurred
if Tiger had won the event. I was al
ready sick and tired of Tiger Woods
before the Masters and before Sun
day, and I don't think I could have
stomached the triumphant declara
tions that would have undoubtedly
accompanied a Woods win.
You will probably agree with me
that something would have been in
credibly amiss if people were tuning
in to celebrity-following networks
like MTV to get their Masters cover
age.
Until Tiger Woods regains his for
mer form and begins winning regular
ly, I will continue to scoff at a media
that continues to deify him and a will
ing public that laps it up. Right now, he
is both a golfer and a celebrity, and re
spected sports media like ESPN
should ignore his celebrity status and
treat him just like any other golfer.
Leave the celebrity coverage to Peo
ple Magazine, and keep it out of my
Sunday golf.
