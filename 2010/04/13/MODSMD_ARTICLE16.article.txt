# Soccer deserves some credit
## 
### Jacob Jaffe Fields of Failure 
It's the final week of the NBA
season and the Western Confer
ence is still not settled. The NHL
playoffs are about to start, and a
very intriguing Masters just
ended. The MLB season is underway,
with the Blue Jays leading the most
talked-about division in baseball and
the Astros doing their best New Jersey
Nets impression. A Steeler and a for
mer Steeler are making headlines for
being less than responsible off the
field, and college basketball's elite
players continue to flee for the money
and poor officiating of the NBA.
So it's time to talk about soccer.
Yeah, yeah, you're probably saying
that soccer is boring and looking for an
article about an American sport.
Everyone loves to bemoan soccer's
lack of goals and point out everything
that is better about watching Ameri
can football or basketball or paint dry
ing. It's the cool thing to do to talk
about soccer being un-American. Soc
cer is for Europeans and South Amer
icans, right? Just like hockey is only for
silly Canadians (unless the U.S. decides
to suddenly do well, then everyone is a
hockey fan).
I'll admit that I have not been com
pletely immune to some of these senti
ments. For years, I only watched foot
ball, basketball and baseball on a regu
lar basis. I played soccer, and it was fun,
but everyone always told me that soc
cer doesn't work as a spectator sport
and no one cares about it in America.
So I believed it.
Only in recent years, with signifi
cant help from FIFA video games,
have I really grown to love soccer. Of
course, it takes some getting used to. If
you're expecting bicycle kicks and hat
tricks in the first two minutes, you'll
probably be disappointed. When you
get past these ideas about what you
think soccer is, it can actually be a fas
cinating game, packed with strategy,
stars and as much controversy as any
sport in the world.
Clearly, soccer is not as popular in
America as some other sports, and
nothing I say is going to change that in
the slightest. Some people don't like
soccer, and I can't get mad at people
for that.
What really annoys me, though, is
when people who talk about sports for
a living don't have baseline knowledge
of soccer. As anyone who knows me or
reads my columns can tell you, I watch
a lot of ESPN, and I love it. While I am
very grateful for ESPN's soccer cover
age of several important games, includ
ing the upcoming World Cup, it baffles
me how little everyone on ESPN who
isn't a soccer analyst knows or cares
about soccer.
Just last week, I was watching
Sports Center's Top 10 Plays, which is
always one of the best segments of the
show. I had watched that day's Cham
pions League showdown between
Manchester United and Bayern Mu
nich, which was a huge event through
out Europe and ended up being a
thrilling contest. My friends and I had
decided to root against ManU just be
cause it would have been more fun to
see the upset, and Bayern Munich
came back from a 3-0 deficit to score
two goals and win the aggregate on
away goals (ask your local soccer fan
for a translation).
In any case, two plays from that
game were amazing enough to make it
into the top 10 plays of the day. Yet the
Sports Center anchors were busy talk
ing about another play during the first
highlight and only made a weak joke
about Nene and Nani while ignoring
the miraculous back-heel goal from
Nani that put ManU on the board. I
thought this could have just been an
isolated event, but later, the ridiculous
volley by Arjen Robben that ended up
putting Bayern Munich through to the
semis received a similar fate. Robben's
goal was the big sports news of the day
in the non-American world, and it was
as spectacular as it was important.
The reaction of the anchors mis
pronouncing Robben's name and say
ing "oh, around the defenders,nice"
was about the reaction a parent makes
to a goal made by the other team in a
youth soccer game. It was the equiva
lent of watching The Catch by Dwight
Clark and saying "he was in the end
zone, cool" or watching Christian Laet
tner's buzzer-beater and saying "he
caught the inbounds pass and made
the shot, good job."

I couldn't believe sports enthusi
asts could say so little about a sports
achievement as impressive and impor
tant as these goals. I even watched a
later episode of Sports Center that
night to see if they could correct their
mistakes, but the second time was no
better.

I wish I could say this was an iso
lated incident, but it really isn't. Im
portant games like ManU-Chelsea

and Real Madrid-Barcelona get
maybe one play on highlight shows,
and anchors act like it's just a
sideshow.

Yes, fans of these shows probably
care more about Leßron's dunk than
Messi's goal, but you'd think sports
people would do the work to learn
about the best players in the world.
I'm no soccer expert and I won't
pretend to be. I know several people
(Americans, no less) that know and
care tons more about the sport than I
do. But that's just it: lots of people know
and care about soccer (after all, it's the
most popular sport worldwide), so why
can't the media accept it?

There will always be dissenters
people will say that soccer doesn't get
the kind of viewers that other sports
get, and that soccer is stupid and bor
ing. Some of these people might even
say that to this column. But no one can
deny that soccer is a major sport, even
in America. And if you're going to
learn the name of Jimmie Johnson's
crew chief, learn the names of the best
soccer players in the world.

to suddenly do well, then everyone is a
hockey fan).
I'll admit that I have not been com
pletely immune to some of these senti
ments. For years, I only watched foot
ball, basketball and baseball on a regu
lar basis. I played soccer, and it was fun,
but everyone always told me that soc
cer doesn't work as a spectator sport
and no one cares about it in America.
So I believed it.
Only in recent years, with signifi
cant help from FIFA video games,
have I really grown to love soccer. Of
course, it takes some getting used to. If
you're expecting bicycle kicks and hat
tricks in the first two minutes, you'll
probably be disappointed. When you
get past these ideas about what you
think soccer is, it can actually be a fas
cinating game, packed with strategy,
stars and as much controversy as any
sport in the world.
Clearly, soccer is not as popular in
America as some other sports, and
nothing I say is going to change that in
the slightest. Some people don't like
soccer, and I can't get mad at people
for that.
What really annoys me, though, is
when people who talk about sports for
a living don't have baseline knowledge
of soccer. As anyone who knows me or
reads my columns can tell you, I watch
a lot of ESPN, and I love it. While I am
very grateful for ESPN's soccer cover
age of several important games, includ
ing the upcoming World Cup, it baffles
me how little everyone on ESPN who
isn't a soccer analyst knows or cares
about soccer.
Just last week, I was watching
Sports Center's Top 10 Plays, which is
always one of the best segments of the
show. I had watched that day's Cham
pions League showdown between
Manchester United and Bayern Mu
nich, which was a huge event through
out Europe and ended up being a
thrilling contest. My friends and I had
decided to root against ManU just be
cause it would have been more fun to
see the upset, and Bayern Munich
came back from a 3-0 deficit to score
two goals and win the aggregate on
away goals (ask your local soccer fan
for a translation).
In any case, two plays from that
game were amazing enough to make it
into the top 10 plays of the day. Yet the
Sports Center anchors were busy talk
ing about another play during the first
highlight and only made a weak joke
about Nene and Nani while ignoring
the miraculous back-heel goal from
Nani that put ManU on the board. I
thought this could have just been an
isolated event, but later, the ridiculous
volley by Arjen Robben that ended up
putting Bayern Munich through to the
semis received a similar fate. Robben's
goal was the big sports news of the day
in the non-American world, and it was
as spectacular as it was important.
The reaction of the anchors mis
pronouncing Robben's name and say
ing "oh, around the defenders,nice"
was about the reaction a parent makes
to a goal made by the other team in a
youth soccer game. It was the equiva
lent of watching The Catch by Dwight
Clark and saying "he was in the end
zone, cool" or watching Christian Laet
tner's buzzer-beater and saying "he
caught the inbounds pass and made
the shot, good job."

I couldn't believe sports enthusi
asts could say so little about a sports
achievement as impressive and impor
tant as these goals. I even watched a
later episode of Sports Center that
night to see if they could correct their
mistakes, but the second time was no
better.

I wish I could say this was an iso
lated incident, but it really isn't. Im
portant games like ManU-Chelsea

and Real Madrid-Barcelona get
maybe one play on highlight shows,
and anchors act like it's just a
sideshow.

Yes, fans of these shows probably
care more about Leßron's dunk than
Messi's goal, but you'd think sports
people would do the work to learn
about the best players in the world.
I'm no soccer expert and I won't
pretend to be. I know several people
(Americans, no less) that know and
care tons more about the sport than I
do. But that's just it: lots of people know
and care about soccer (after all, it's the
most popular sport worldwide), so why
can't the media accept it?

There will always be dissenters
people will say that soccer doesn't get
the kind of viewers that other sports
get, and that soccer is stupid and bor
ing. Some of these people might even
say that to this column. But no one can
deny that soccer is a major sport, even
in America. And if you're going to
learn the name of Jimmie Johnson's
crew chief, learn the names of the best
soccer players in the world.
