## Nurses reject final proposal Hospitals and nurses haven't healed differences 
### AN LE NGUYEN DESK EDITOR 
A week after a "last, best, and
final" labor offer fell through, Stan
ford Hospital & Clinics and Lucile
Packard Children's Hospital are still
at odds with nurses there.
The Committee for Recognition
of Nursing Achievement (CRONA),
the union that represents Stanford's
nurses, said on its Web site that 2,302
nurses voted against the offer last
Wednesday. The organization repre
sents some 2,700 nurses.
The large consensus led the union
to officially reject Stanford's latest
proposal.
CRONA President Lorie John
son submitted a letter to the hospi
tals last Friday expressing the nurses'
dissatisfaction with the hospitals'
final offer.
"We call upon the hospitals to re
turn to the table with us as soon as
possible, and to come to the table
with an open mind and willingness to
bargain over all issues ... We ask the
hospitals to present a new proposal
that considers and responds to
CRONA's last offer," Johnson wrote.
Robert Dicks, a spokesperson for
Lucile Packard Children's Hospital,
said he was surprised by the nurses'
overwhelming rejection of the pro
posal.
"Twenty [negotiation] sessions
have enabled us to arrive at an offer
that includes four-percent wage in
creases for all nurses in their first
year and some additional increases
for subsequent years, along with a
$3,000 signing bonus if no strike no
tice is given," Dicks said.
"We arrived at what we believe is
a very fair and generous offer," he
added. "We're disappointed and find
it hard to believe that the nurses have
not signed it."
Nursing New Wounds
According to Peter Nussbaum,
CRONA's lead attorney, there are
three major issues at hand: paid time
off, professional development and
union representation.
Under the hospitals' final propos
al, nurses are not permitted to accu
mulate paid time off over time. Nuss
baum said aggregating paid sick days
is an important option because em
ployees would have something to
draw from when emergencies arise.
"Unlike most employers, the hos
pital does not provide employees
with separate amounts of guaran
teed sick leave, vacations [and] holi
days," Nussbaum said.
He speculated that the hospitals
aim to limit the amount of paid time
off that nurses can keep a claim
that Dicks strongly denied.
"Their paid time off ranges from
26 to 39 days in a year," Dicks said.
"We feel that that range of paid time
off is quite significant."
Adding fuel to the fire is the de
bate over the Professional Nurse
Development Program (PNDP).
Within hospitals, nurses have the
ability move up a four-step ladder;
employees at nurse-four status are
the highest-ranked.

"Within each one of those classi
fications, there are steps that you
progress to over time and it affects
your benefits [and] salary," Nuss
baum said. "Most of the nurses at
Stanford are in the highest two cate
gories, three and four."
Under the proposed standards,
many of these high-ranking nurses
could be demoted. The new criteria
would make it "very difficult for
nurses to achieve and to even main
tain their nurse-three or four status,"
Nussbaum said.

But according to Dicks, the new
PNDP criteria are in line with stan
dards at other hospitals and institu
tions.

"We feel like we made an offer
that provides for some extraordi
nary nursing development processes
and programs," Dicks said.

Nussbaum also expressed con
cern that the hospitals aim to "seri
ously weaken CRONA, both finan
cially and in terms of the role that it
has played."
Stanford's nurses do not want to
lose their representative at the bar
gaining table, he said.
Resuscitating the Debate
Though the two parties do not see
eye to eye on many issues, they do
agree on one point: a strike by the
nurses is undesirable.
Nussbaum acknowledged that
strikes are always a possibility when
negotiations turn sour. He does not
believe, however, that the situation
has deteriorated to such a degree
that a strike is the sole recourse.
"We don't believe that we're at
that point, and we hope we never get
to that point," Nussbaum said.
As a precaution, Stanford Hospi
tal & Clinics and Lucile Packard
Children's Hospital have made con
tingency plans for a possible strike.
"If the situation requires, we will
continue delivering quality care to
patients and families," Dicks said.
CRONA has not ruled out the
option of re-starting talks.
"We will do everything that we
can to get these negotiations back
together ... negotiations involve a
give and take, and that has not been
present on the hospital's side," Nuss
baum said.
Since the proposal failed to gain
approval last week, both parties are
working under the expired CRONA
contract from 2007, as stipulated by
federal labor law.
