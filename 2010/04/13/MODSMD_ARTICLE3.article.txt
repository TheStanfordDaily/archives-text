### NIKHIL JOSHI SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Vice Provost for Undergraduate Educa
tion John C. Bravman '79 M.S. 'Bl Ph.D. 'B5, a
veteran of thirty five years on the Farm, said
Monday he will leave Stanford this year to be
come the 17th president of Bucknell Universi
ty in Lewisburg, Pa.
Provost John Etchemendy will look within
the University for someone to replace Brav

man and plans to transition the job over the
summer, said University spokeswoman Lisa
Lapin.
Bravman, 52, made his start at Stanford in
1975 as a freshman in the materials science
and engineering department. He stayed in the
department as a student for 10 years, earning
three degrees, and was appointed as an assis
tant professor while finishing his doctorate.
By 1996 he was a full professor and depart
ment chair. President Gerhard Casper ap

pointed Bravman vice provost in 1999.
Now, effective July 1, he will take the reins
at Bucknell, a 3,500-student liberal arts institu
tion in eastern Pennsylvania.
The challenges and opportunities Bravman
will face at Bucknell will be on a different scale
from those he saw at Stanford. As vice provost,
he played a role in the Stanford Campaign for
Undergraduate Education, which raised $l.l
billion. When he joins Bucknell, Bravman will
inherit a comprehensive fundraising campaign

with a $4OO million objective.
At Bucknell, Bravman will also set top
level direction for the university, which has a
strong focus on the liberal arts and undergrad
uate education.

"Bucknell University holds a special place
in higher education," Bravman said in a state
ment on Monday. "I am indebted to my friends
and colleagues at Stanford for their mentor-

"John Bravman has been a treasured member of the Stanford community for nearly 35 years,
first as an outstanding student, then as a faculty member, and finally as a university leader."
