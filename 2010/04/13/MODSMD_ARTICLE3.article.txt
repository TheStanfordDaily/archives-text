### NIKHIL JOSHI SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Vice Provost for Undergraduate Educa
tion John C. Bravman '79 M.S. 'Bl Ph.D. 'B5, a
veteran of thirty five years on the Farm, said
Monday he will leave Stanford this year to be
come the 17th president of Bucknell Universi
ty in Lewisburg, Pa.
Provost John Etchemendy will look within
the University for someone to replace Brav

man and plans to transition the job over the
summer, said University spokeswoman Lisa
Lapin.
Bravman, 52, made his start at Stanford in
1975 as a freshman in the materials science
and engineering department. He stayed in the
department as a student for 10 years, earning
three degrees, and was appointed as an assis
tant professor while finishing his doctorate.
By 1996 he was a full professor and depart
ment chair. President Gerhard Casper ap

pointed Bravman vice provost in 1999.
Now, effective July 1, he will take the reins
at Bucknell, a 3,500-student liberal arts institu
tion in eastern Pennsylvania.
The challenges and opportunities Bravman
will face at Bucknell will be on a different scale
from those he saw at Stanford. As vice provost,
he played a role in the Stanford Campaign for
Undergraduate Education, which raised $l.l
billion. When he joins Bucknell, Bravman will
inherit a comprehensive fundraising campaign

with a $4OO million objective.
At Bucknell, Bravman will also set top
level direction for the university, which has a
strong focus on the liberal arts and undergrad
uate education.

"Bucknell University holds a special place
in higher education," Bravman said in a state
ment on Monday. "I am indebted to my friends
and colleagues at Stanford for their mentor-

"John Bravman has been a treasured member of the Stanford community for nearly 35 years,
first as an outstanding student, then as a faculty member, and finally as a university leader."

ing, support and guidance, and for
the fundamental role they have
played in shaping my core belief in
the liberal arts and undergraduate
education, a value which Stanford
and Bucknell so deeply share."
In the 35 years Bravman has
spent at Stanford, he has left a num
ber of lasting impressions on the
University.
It was Bravman who, in 1999,
founded Freshman-Sophomore Col
lege, where he is still the dean. For 11
years, Bravman, who sports "FroSo-
Co" on his car's license plate, has
held Friday barbecues for FroSoCo
residents in his backyard in the
spring and fall and hosted a number
of special events for those in the pro
gram.

He also created the Stanford
Summer Engineering Academy, a
four-week program designed to at
tract a diverse student body to the
School of Engineering by preparing
high school students from non-tradi
tional backgrounds.
As vice provost, he led the search
committees that chose Greg Board
man as vice provost for student af
fairs and Richard Shaw as dean of
admission.
"My choice of him as vice provost
for undergraduate education in 1999
was one of the very best decisions I
have made," Casper said in a state
ment. "He approached his task with
commitment, determination and dis
ciplinary breadth ranging from engi
neering to the humanities, with
imagination, and with the ability to
rally support for our and for his
agenda."
Throughout his time on the Farm,
Bravman has maintained close con
tact with students. He has spent 20

years as a freshman advisor and has
lived among students for 14 years,
first as a resident fellow in Yost and
now as the dean of Freshman-
Sophomore College. He won the
University's highest teaching honor,
the Walter J. Gores Award, in 1989.
In a statement, President Hen
nessy lauded Bravman's contribu
tions to the University in all his dif
ferent roles.
"John Bravman has been a treas
ured member of the Stanford com
munity for nearly 35 years, first as an
outstanding student, then as a facul
ty member, and finally as a universi
ty leader," Hennessy said. "During
that time he has been a distinguished
researcher, one of our most highly
regarded and sought-after teachers,
and an energetic and admired
leader."
