## Robinson speaks to Farm The 						former Irish President puts human rights into context for students 
### JULIA BROWNELL SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Former President of Ireland Mary Robinson spoke
about human rights at Stanford on Monday, drawing
from her past work as the United Nations high commis
sioner for human rights and on her more recent work
with nonprofits like Realize Rights. She focused on
practical action and the role Stanford could play in the
process.
"Academic institutions like Stanford ... have an op
portunity to reaffirm and give meaning to what Article
I [of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights] de
clared, that all human beings are born free and equal in
dignity and rights," Robinson said. "Our challenge is to
ensure that it comes to life for all people."
Robinson outlined issues she thought deserved the
most attention in developing human rights worldwide,
including women's empowerment, decent wages and
health care, institution-building in developing nations
and climate change.
Before outlining her own goals, she addressed the di
versity of opinions on human rights and the role of the
U.N. in that discussion.
"As I say those words, 'human rights,' many of you in

In last night's lecture, Presidential lecturer Mary Robinson said that Stanford and its peer
institutions "have an opportunity to reaffirm and give meaning" to universal human rights.
the audience hear different things ..
. we don't have a totally shared
view," Robinson said.

The U.N.'s work was "never
meant to impose a single model of
action on governments and coun
tries," she said. It is, however, meant
to provide some guidance and struc
ture.

Robinson said countries need to
"bring voices of marginalized
women to the political arena." She
spoke about maternal health in
Africa versus Ireland, and the role of
women in conflict and peace negoti
ations.

According to Robinson, climate
change is the most important human
rights issue of the day but it needs

a human face to gain momentum.
"The icon of climate change is a
poor woman farmer," Robinson
said. "She has to try and cope...
[and she has] no safety nets."
The former president also de
scribed decent work as a human
right.

"Decent work is central to having
a life filled with dignity," she said.
She urged nations to "put job cre
ation at the center of macroeconom
ic policy."
In addition to putting the talk in
an economic context, Robinson
talked about her view on health care
reform in the United States during
the question-and-answer session.
She said that the United States needs
to address rights issues on its own
soil, especially since it lags behind
other nations on human rights scales.

"We need access to health care
for ourselves," she said. "The United
States is not doing well on a whole

range of issues, and it can do far bet
ter."

Students who came were im
pressed by the talk many came
because of their concern about
human rights issues.
"I was really interested to hear
what some of her solutions were,"
said Patrick Freeman 'l3. "I'm an
Earth Systems major, so her words
on climate change most affected
me."

Jeff Gerson 'l2 said that Robin
son's words about the importance of
academic institutions had a lingering
effect.
"The resonance was when she
was talking about the influence that
institutions have," Gerson said. By
fostering projects like the Yang and
Yamazaki Environment and Energy
building, "we're already seeing
progress on climate change."
"There's supposed to be a strong
focus on global citizenship here at
Stanford ... [the talk] enforces that
there are avenues to make a differ
ence," he added.
The lecture was part of the Presi
dential Lecture series sponsored by
the Office of the President and put
on by the Center for the Humanities
at Stanford.
