## Hospital expansion is a work in progress Stanford & Palo Alto talk shop about construction

Before Stanford can begin con
struction on its vast hospital expan

of Palo Alto but the two are still at
odds over what benefits Stanford
should provide as it adds some 1.3

space for incoming patients.
According to the renewal pro

emergency department last year be

However, construction has been
delayed due to ongoing negotiations
with the city.
