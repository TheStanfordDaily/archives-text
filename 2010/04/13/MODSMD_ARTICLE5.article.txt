## Hospital expansion is a work in progress Stanford & Palo Alto talk shop about construction 
### CAROLINE CHEN STAFF WRITER 
Before Stanford can begin con
struction on its vast hospital expan
sion project, it must first reach a de
velopment agreement with the city
of Palo Alto but the two are still at
odds over what benefits Stanford
should provide as it adds some 1.3
million square feet to its hospitals.
Stanford Hospital & Clinics and
Lucile Packard Children's Hospital
have been planning a renewal proj
ect in response to a state law that re
quires hospitals to be earthquake
safe by 2013. Stanford has requested
an extension until 2015, eyeing not
just compliance with state seismic
safety laws, but demolition and re
placement of the current Stanford
Hospital & Clinics complex and ren
ovation and expansion of the Chil
dren's Hospital.
Altogether, the $3.5 billion proj

ect would add 1.3 million square feet
of infrastructure.

One of the reasons for a proposed
expansion is the size of the current
emergency department, said Shelley
Hebert, a spokesperson for Stanford
Hospital & Clinics.
"The emergency room was built
for less than half of the patient vol
ume it serves every day," Hebert
said. "We have to start diverting am
bulances to other hospitals that are
further away, and that would be a sit
uation where someone's life or well
being would be at stake."
Hebert said a lack of beds at the
hospital has caused "gridlock" since
patients cannot be efficiently moved
out of the emergency room to make
space for incoming patients.
According to the renewal pro
ject's Web site, 950 visitors left the
emergency department last year be
fore they could be seen by a doctor.
However, construction has been
delayed due to ongoing negotiations
with the city.
"This is the largest single develop
ment project in the history of Palo
Alto," said the city's mayor, Pat Burt.
Burt listed traffic impacts and in
creased demand for housing as two
of the most significant consequences
of the project.
In June 2009, Stanford outlined
public benefits worth $125 million to
the city in exchange for the city's per
mission. The benefits included subsi
dies for low-income patients, support
for community health programs in
Palo Alto and payment into the city's
housing fund.
Most expensive was the proposal
to purchase Caltrain passes for all
medical center employees in order to
reduce traffic congestion. These pur
chases are estimated to cost $9l mil

lion over the project's lifespan.
Burt, however, claimed many of
the items listed as public benefits are
"mischaracterizations." He said a
number of these benefits are re
quired by California state law.
Meanwhile, Burt sought to clarify
the city's intention after reports that
Palo Alto has requested that Stan
ford pay for the construction of a new
police building. He said Palo Alto has
already waived housing impact fees
and has asked Stanford to pay $3O
million to support local infrastruc
ture.

"No one is asking Stanford to
build a new police department," Burt
said. "Palo Alto has $5OO million in
backlogged infrastructure, and the
$3O million as a public benefit would
be used for a wide variety of identi
fied backlog."
The city and the school will not be
able to finalize a development agree
ment until the publication of an envi
ronmental impact report, which is ex
pected to be released in late spring.
The report will include a number of
studies on topics ranging from traffic
impacts to water and electricity use.

Non-hospital spokespeople for
the University declined to comment
on the negotiations until the report is
released. Hebert, however, seemed
optimistic about the negotiations.
"We have a longstanding and very
positive relationship with the city,"
Hebert said. "All parties are encour
aged by the fact that things do seem
to be moving forward."
Burt echoed Hebert's sentiment.
"I think we're making a lot of
progress," he said. "We've made a
commitment to really try to move the
process forward this year as expedi
tiously as possible."
If a development agreement is
reached, the project proposal would
undergo a detailed review at the
state level. If approved, construction
would begin in 2011 and last for five
years.
