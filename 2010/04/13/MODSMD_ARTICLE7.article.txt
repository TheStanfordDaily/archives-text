## Pipe Dreams 
### SHAWNEE BAUGHMAN 
It's dark. It's hot. It's steamy,
and hell, it's dangerous.
It could pass for a setting straight
out of Raiders of the Lost Ark and
draws comparisons to the mysterious
men's locker room at Avery Aquatic
Center. Yet while the common male
student has braved the locker room,
only a few daring individuals have
explored the intricacies of the Stan
ford steam tunnel system.
The subterranean system, built in
1881, takes saturated steam and
pipes it to over 200 campus and med
ical center buildings. The tun-

nels and pipes are still
used to this day to
heat our water an 1
buildings. But for
enterprising stu
dents, the tun
nels transport
more than just
steam.
Plunging into
the depths of the
network of tunnels be
neath the Main Quad, stu
dents seek to discover the
mystery that lives under our
feet and has remained a forbidden
intrigue since the Universi
ty's original development.
Stanford Magazine voted
steam tunneling one of the

"101 things you must do" before
graduating from the Farm. From a
forbidden foray for those who like to
drink, socialize or even fornicate in a
dirty place to a chance to form a con
nection to the literal roots of our
University, students have been navi
gating the underground corridors for
decades.
Wielding a dingy, white towel to
protect themselves from the scalding
pipes, a flashlight to navigate the
dark corridors and water bottles to
keep themselves hydrated, one
group of eager explorers journeyed
through the tunnels in the hopes of
happening upon unexplored territo
ries. They dreamed of creating a map
that could one day be used to aid
other hopeful adventurers. (No
names are used because of potential
legal liability for steam tunnelers.)
"If you're scared of the dark,
claustrophobic, scared of bugs or rats
... it's probably not for you," one
student warned. "I would say it's just
a fun thing if you're looking for that
extra adventure."
For one veteran, the initial
thought on his mind when he first en
tered the humid tunnel was, "Well,
this smells lovely."
"I guess the smell just serves as a

reminder that you're underground
in tunnels that haven't been used
for a while," he added.
The walls closed in as soon as they
entered. Most of the time the stu
dents were forced into a crouching
position, and sometimes the corri
dors were narrow enough to prevent
passage of even the smallest student.
The walls were made of faded red
brick and the floor was covered in
dirt, making for a messy journey.
Most of the tunnels were connect
ed to one larger passage that some of
the human moles referred to as the
"main corridor." This has many off
shoots, sometimes leading to locked
gates, other times leading to flooded,
impassible sections of the tunnels.
"There's a small room off the

main corridor where you move a
board and behind it is a bunch of
names and dates," said
one sophomore. "The
" oldest date was
something in the
fifties ... It's re-
L ally cool."
Tunnel
ers ducked
below pipes
f and contorted
their bodies to
avoid touching
hot surfaces. Yet
some of the most diffi
cult obstacles were those
left behind by past adven
turers who wanted to
make their previous pres-

ence known. The tunnelers watched
their steps to avoid beer cans, party
favors, bottles, red cups and condom
wrappers.
But the allure of partying in a
cramped, dirty place is not the only
reason to explore the tunnels. Some
simply have an appreciation for the
activity of tunneling itself and feel a
connection with the history of the
University by exploring the same
tunnels that students have been nav
igating for years.
"It's fun because it's supposed to
be this secret deal," said a sopho
more, "It's kind of mysterious."
There's a certain satisfaction on
the faces of the tunnelers when
they've completed a successful trip
through the system. After a journey
through the dark and stifling tunnels,
the fresh air relieves their heat
weathered faces and the light is a fa
miliar friend. Already, they're talking
of their next underground trip.
"At first I did it because I thought
it sounded cool," said one of the tun
nelers after the trip. "Well, my expec
tations were pretty much met on the
coolness factor."

After going down the manhole, two students duck and dodge to avoid the
many pipes in the steam tunnels. Students try to avoid the pipes at all costs to
keep from being burned.


DOWN THE RABBIT HOLE: Some students said that the hardest part of steam tunneling is finding an entrance. Entrance points can vary from
manholes to secret grates or doors. Oftentimes it is just sheer luck that leads students to an available entrance that is not bolted or locked.
