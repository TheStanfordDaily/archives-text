# Steam Tunneling Tips
## 
### 
Number J: Finding an Entrance
The first step to steam tunneling is finding a reliable and
discreet entry point. From large, cumbersome manholes,
to semi-secret grates and doors, these points exist all
over the Main Quad.
Number 2: Getting Inside
While it may be easy to locate these entrances, it's not al
ways easy to get in. Many of the grates and doors are
bolted, locked or only accessible from the inside. The un
locked manholes that do exist are very heavy. Some use
team effort to lift the heavy covers, while others are more
resourceful and sometimes just lucky finding bro
ken locks or unsecured doors to enter through.

Number 3: Staying safe and undiscovered once inside
It's no walk in the park once you've entered the tunnels.
Tunnelers advise to bring water, a flashlight and perhaps a
towel to help avoid touching the hot pipes. The tunnels are
hot, and the pipes are still carrying hot steam to the build
ings in the Quad so be careful where you rest your hand!
There are also flooded corridors and dead-end off-shoots
to be wary of. Finally, keep quiet once you're inside you
don't want to alert security to your presence!
Number 4: Getting out
Getting out of the tunnel can be just as tricky as getting in.
Veteran steam tunnelers know their way around; they have
designated "emergency exits" and plansforescaping quick
ly should they need to. One thing to remember is that there
could be guards posted in the Quad at any time, so you
should be careful and quiet when coming out. Traveling in
groups is recommended so that you can exit one at a time
each alerting the others to any possible security threat.
