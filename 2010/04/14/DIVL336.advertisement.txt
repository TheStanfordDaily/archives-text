tHe Public
Jk merican public education is at a historic turning point,
especially in urban districts. Over the past 20 years,
# % demands for accountability and school choice
have grown. Since the passage of the No Child Left Behind
Act in 2001, every state is required to measure the reading
and math skills of students from grades three through eight.
Leaders of both political parties now support school choice.
Ravitch, once a supporter of both accountability and choice, now subjects the two
movements to critical analysis and finds that the results are meager to date. As
currently defined, accountability may produce the paradoxical results of higher
test scores and poorly educated students. The convergence of accountability
and choice promotes the privatization of American public education, a dangerous
trend that will leave many children behind.
