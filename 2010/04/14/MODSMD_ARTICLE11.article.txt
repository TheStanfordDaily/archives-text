## EDITORIAL Sensationalism, distortions cloud marijuana debate 
### 
This November, California voters could
make California the first state in the
union to decriminalize the recreation
al use of marijuana, a landmark in the drug's
history in this country. Currently, fourteen
states have legalized the use of marijuana
for medical purposes. In October of last
year, the Obama administration declared
that the federal government would discon
tinue the practice of prosecuting marijuana
offenders, as long as they complied with
state laws.

For many advocates of marijuana de
criminalization, Obama's departure from
the Bush-era prosecution of the drug, cou
pled with the growing number of states al
lowing its use for medical reasons, is evi
dence of the nation's desire to end the an
cient prohibition. Opponents of this meas
ure known as the Regulate, Control and
Tax Cannabis Act of 2010 are stepping
up to stress the detriments that this act will
have on overall public health and safety.
We, the Editorial Board, want to make it
clear that we believe that marijuana, like
any drug, poses potential dangers to society.
Regrettably, a clear analysis of the dangers
and benefits of marijuana decriminalization
has been clouded for decades, mainly be
cause personal preferences have rendered
those involved in this debate unable to pro
vide unbiased research on the subject. Pro
ponents of the decriminalization of marijua
na have capitalized on California's current
financial situation and sold the drug as a
part of the solution to the state's budget
woes. Regardless of the legitimacy of this
claim, California voters cannot make this
decision for the shortsighted goal of allevi
ating the deficit, but must consider the long
term societal changes that this act will cause.
The facts about marijuana are difficult to

determine from the numerous conflicting
studies, but a few facts are clear the num
ber of sentences for the possession of mari
juana has increased dramatically over the
last 20 years, yet the use of the drug has re
mained relatively steady, according to most
available surveys. Fears that decriminaliza
tion will increase use of marijuana seem as
unfounded as hopes that increased prosecu
tion would decrease the drug's use. Oppo
nents of marijuana today use scare tactics
similar to those used by Harry Anslinger
and the creators of exploitation films such
as "Reefer Madness" in the 19305, relying on
anecdotal evidence and unsubstantiated
claims of the negative effects of the drug.
This is a danger to the democratic process.
It is for this reason that advocates of mar
ijuana decriminalization have avoided en
gaging in conversation on the social costs of
the drug, and instead focus their efforts to
wards illuminating the medical and fiscal
benefits of legalization. In the process, the
American public has been shortchanged of
what is the most important question to be
answered in November: Does the legaliza
tion of marijuana pose significant dangers
to our communities? We implore those on
both sides of the fence to return to this ques
tion and provide honest evidence so that we,
as citizens, can make an informed decision.
Recent opinion polls show that this
proposition has a good chance of passing. If,
in November, the people of California de
cide to decriminalize marijuana, the ancient
practices of sensationalism and misinforma
tion must cease. It is the responsibility of ad
vocates and opponents alike to put their
prejudices aside and work together in ensur
ing the safety and health of California resi
dents. And come November, both sides will
have to respect the outcome of the election.
