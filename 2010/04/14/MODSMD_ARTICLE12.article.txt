# GET IT RIGHT
## Tea Time! 
### Erica Morgan 
Students traversing White Plaza this
Thursday, April 15, will have the oppor
tunity to witness the debut of a new stu
dent group: The Stanford Tea Party. A fitting
date for the Tea Party's premiere, April 15 is
the dreaded day by which Americans must
file income tax returns. The process of filing
returns with the Internal Revenue Service
(IRS) may seem a daunting experience, and,
unless one plans to make a career of tax ac
counting, one may be flummoxed by the in
tricacies of tax law. Thankfully, as full time
students, the majority of us do not have to
contend with the aches and pains of compli
cated tax returns.

Just because we're not frantically assem
bling receipts and filling out IRS paperwork
on April 14 doesn't mean that we should
blithely write off the 15th as that one day
other people wring their hands and pull their
hair over taxes. As college graduates, we will
be likely to join the ranks of the highly taxed
income brackets in our country. Though it's
popular to demonize "the rich" in the hack
neyed Robin Hood saga, the fact remains
that "greedy," profit-seeking capitalists pro
vide the majority of the money that keeps
our government floating (or, these days, sink
ing less quickly).
Since the near future may entail forking
over more than a quarter of our incomes to
our government, it behooves us to be wary of
how that money is spent. With the United
States national debt currently surpassing
$12.8 trillion, deficit projections of $9.1 tril
lion in the coming decade and President
Obama's own assertion that "we are out of
money," concerns about reckless spending
and government inefficiencies are most cer
tainly merited. One might think that the debt
crisis would compel the administration to
scrutinize deficit spending more carefully
and reign in government expenses. One
would be mistaken. Obama's solution: a pro
posed $989 billion increase in taxes over the
course of the next decade on individuals and
businesses. So, we're going to stifle business
es and individual innovations with hefty
taxes as we continue to pour money into
stimulus packages (unemployment is still
climbing), bank bailouts (too big to fail), so
cial security (no one is pretending that the
system is going to survive anymore) and now
healthcare!

Enter the Tea Party Movement. Painted
by critics as a radical fringe group of crazy
white-racist-male-libertarians, the move
ment is, at its core, a non-partisan grassroots
organization that promotes a balanced budg
et and reduced spending. Members partici
pate in peaceful protests of what they deem
unconstitutional taxation and downright asi
nine spending policies. The Tea Party Patriots

Web site outlines the movement's mission:
"the impetus for the Tea Party movement is
excessive government spending and taxa
tion. Our mission is to attract, educate, organ
ize and mobilize our fellow citizens to secure
public policy consistent with our three core
values of Fiscal Responsibility, Constitution
ally Limited Government and Free Mar
kets."
According to a Gallup poll, "Tea Partiers
are fairly mainstream in their demograph
ics." Though Tea Party supporters skew right
politically, they are generally representative
of the American public in terms of age, edu
cation and race. This finding contradicts the
angry white man label and suggests that anti-
Tea Party groups such as Crash the Tea Party,
which claim to be sick and tired of the "loose
affiliation of racists, homophobes and mo
rons," might need to rethink their critiques.
Tax Day Tea Party protests express con
cerns about the recklessness of government
spending. This Thursday, Stanford students
sharing these concerns will rally in White
Plaza from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m., launching a Stan
ford Tea Party.

Bring a cup of tea and your Bill of Rights.
