# STRANGELY CHARMING
## Tree-ness Envy 
### Jack Cackler 
I had a fascinating column prepared for
this week on teleportation, but an issue
surfaced which requires immediate re
dress. An article by Lea Hachigan in last
week's Harvard Crimson entitled "Califor
nia Dreaming" (www.thecrimson.com/arti
cle/2010/4/7/day-out-harvard-work/) wist
fully theorized that the poor weather in
Cambridge compared to Palo Alto is actual
ly a positive feature, and enables Harvard
students to fully reach their potential and
minimize wasted time. While it's unclear
what combination of satire, delusion and
self-loathing the piece is, I feel compelled to
defend the honor of Stanford from such
brazen attacks from the "Stanford of the
East." My only hesitation in writing this ar
ticle is that perhaps the fruit hangs too low;
in the twenty-first century, a comparison be
tween the two schools, particularly when it
comes to weather, is not even fair. Never
theless, this is a science column, and so per
haps the best way to settle this playful rival
ry once and for all is to use science to crown
a victor.
For starters, Hachigan asserts that poor
weather keeps students from exercising
outside, so that they can instead remain in
side and study. Her presumed assertion is
that, by spending more time in the library,
Harvard students will have superior aca
demic performance. A study out of the
American Heart Association just last
month, however, tested both physical ac
tivity levels and academic performance in
725 adolescents. The study concluded that,
even controlling for confounds, students
that were more physically active per
formed better academically. So while
"wasting time" being physically active in
balmy February conditions might appear
to be a detriment to students purely fo
cused on GPA, our recreation in fact en
ables superior and more effective academ-

ic performance. Stanford's fifteen Direc
tors' Cups probably help qualify us as an
"active" school.

In addition to exercise, Hachigan also
claims that inclement conditions keep stu
dents from socializing, sparing them a few
more minutes to work on their precious
problem sets. As with exercise, the error in
her logic is in assuming that simply spend
ing more time studying will lead to higher
performance. A study out of Lousiana
State University published in October
2008 measured both academic ability and
performance by analyzing ACT scores and
exam scores throughout the year, as well as
socialization in 867 undergraduates. Stu
dents were asked to report new friendships
and social interactions they made, and the
students that made the highest academic
improvements over the year showed a high
correlation with those that gained the most
friendships. The implication of the study is
that while developing friendships may
draw time away from focused studying, the
process of socialization is an enormous
boon to academic performance. Also,
friends are fun.

As to Hachigan's claims that poor
weather will aid Harvard students in their
quest to save the world from injustice, I
might advise a read through a study done
out of UCLA and the University of Ply
mouth last June demonstrating that good

weather is positively linked to altruistic be
havior. The study corroborated a study con
ducted in 1977 which showed that sunshine,
higher temperatures, lower humidity and
lower winds all increased subjects' altru
ism. Altruism was quantified both by meas
uring how well subjects tipped and how
willing they were to help a researcher with
a seemingly unrelated task. I'm by no
means implying causation, but perhaps the
Cambridge winters were a contributing fac
tor to Harvard President Drew Faust not
ing that 39 percent of her graduating class
in 2008 went into finance or consulting, and
chiding them to lead meaningful lives at her
Baccalaureate address.

Hopefully, I've provided enough Veritas
to put this old rivalry to rest. All kidding
aside, I think we all know that both Stan
ford and Harvard are excellent schools.
Both sets of student bodies are driven, or
ganized and exciting enough to find plenty
of time to exercise, socialize and help
change the world, rain or shine (some shine
more than others). There is much that binds
us together, from our size, to our 11-digit
endowments, to our generic shade of dark
red mascot. But despite a 252 year head
start, there's a reason that Stanford and the
Bay Area have already eclipsed Harvard as
the omphalos of the technological world,
particularly in information technology,
biotechnology, clean energy, start-ups and
non-profits. And while we may joke about
our splendid weather, the impact of 300
sunny days a year on quality of life should
not be understated. The Wind of Freedom is
strong at Stanford, but perhaps the Sun of
Joy is the unsung hero that drives us to truly
excel and enjoy life while doing so.
