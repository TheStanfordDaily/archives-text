## Holding ASSU Senate Candidates Accountable 
### Sincerely, ADAM ADLER '12 
Every year, several students decide
they want to enter the world of stu
dent politics. They design platforms,
they campaign, and eventually, a few of
these students are selected by their peers to
join the ASSU Undergraduate Senate. The
candidates campaign on platforms of sus
tainability, ethics reform, transparency, and
a variety of other important issues. This year
was no exception. Just as in previous years,
several candidates campaigned in an effort
to win a spot on the Senate, and just as in
previous years, the students chose 15 candi
dates to represent them.
But this year, the election process was
marred by unethical action undertaken by

two of the Senate candidates. Like many of
their peers, these candidates sought and re
ceived the endorsements of several student
groups on campus. Specifically, these candi
dates received the endorsement of GAIA,
an environmental umbrella group. As part
of the endorsement, the candidates agreed
to run a sustainable campaign. They agreed
to use pre-used paper for all of their cam
paign fliers. But after receiving the endorse
ment, they quickly discovered they would
not be able to abide by the rules and expec
tations put forth by GAIA they did not
have enough pre-used paper to print all of
their campaign fliers. At this point, the can
didates acted in away that was irrefutably
unethical. They printed fliers on virgin
paper, and included the GAIA logo on
these fliers so the student body would think
they were in compliance with GAIA's rules
even though they were not. This was a delib
erate act of deception. They did not inform
the student body of this switch, nor did they
inform GAIA. But this is only the begin
ning. Not only did they use new paper
they took actions to make their new paper
seem like pre-used paper even though it was
not. Specifically, they printed the full text of
the health care bill on the back of their fliers
so that students and GAIA members would
think they were still in compliance with en
vironmental regulations. These two candi
dates, Carolyn Simmons and Rebecca
Sachs, took actions which are clearly uneth
ical and intolerable. Their actions were not
the products of accidental missteps or cam
paign negligence. Rather, their actions rep
resent a deliberate attempt to deceive the
students of Stanford. Their actions are unac
ceptable.
Simmons and Sachs were elected by their
peers to sit in the Senate. I do not dispute

that, nor do I contest their right to serve. But
Rebecca Sachs campaigned on a platform of
ethics reform, and Carolyn Simmons cam
paigned on a platform of sustainability and
government transparency. Their actions,
however, represent the opposite of those
ideals. Their actions call into question the le
gitimacy of their Senatorship. Actions speak
louder than words. If Senators Sachs and
Simmons truly value the ideals on which they
campaigned if they truly value ethics in
the ASSU and if they truly want our student
government to be open, accessible, and hon
est, then they should step forward and ac
knowledge that what they have done is
wrong. They should apologize to the students
of Stanford, whom they deceived and
showed little respect for throughout their
campaigns. Further, they should promise
never to take actions of this nature again. Ad
ditionally, they should champion a code of
ethics upon taking office that would apply to
current and prospective members of the
ASSU government.
I find it particularly distressing that such
unethical action can take place without stu
dents in Stanford knowing about it. Sim
mons' and Sachs' actions were described in
only one location on campus, and even then,
it was displayed online only and was pub
lished only after a significant number of
votes had already been cast. Most students,
even aware students, still don't know what
happened. The students of Stanford deserve
better. They deserve to know about any eth
ical misdeeds taken by Senate candidates
and by Senators. To accept anything less
would be to accept a corrupt and ineffective
democracy.
