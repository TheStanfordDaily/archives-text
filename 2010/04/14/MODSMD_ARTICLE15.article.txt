### CLAUDIA LOPEZ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford women's water polo dominated
this weekend as it faced off against the Univer
sity of Hawaii late Sunday afternoon in
Hawaii, winning 10-6.
"Playing far away wasn't a big deal it
just got us ready for the long weekends that we
have ahead of us for MPSFs and NCAAs,"
said junior goalkeeper Amber Oland.
Although Hawaii is far away, the team had
no problem adjusting and playing well in the
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation (MPSF)
match.
"Playing in Hawaii is always a blast," said
sophomore driver Pallavi Menon. "Besides
the beach and amazing weather, UH usually
brings a crowd when they have home games
it was a really fun environment to play in."
Stanford began the game strongly as it led
4-1 by the end of the first quarter. By halftime,
the Cardinal was ahead 6-3 and would keep
the lead until the end of the match.
"The team played great," Oland said. "We
came out hard getting a 4-1 lead and maintain
ing that lead for the game. We have to keep
this up though if we want to continue to win,
especially with our last two games being
against Cal and USC."

"We played as a unit on Sunday, both of
fensively and defensively, which I feel played
a huge role in our success," Menon said. "We
also started the game with fire and deter
mined the tempo of the game through all four
quarters."

Senior driver Kelly Eaton smashed an im
pressive four goals into the net. Freshman two
meter Annika Dries skipped in a total of three
goals. Junior driver Kim Krueger, Menon and
sophomore two-meter Melissa Seidemann
tacked on a goal apiece, Oland had a whop

pmg nine saves.
"It was good to win on the road, especially
traveling that far," Dries said. "Knowing we
can stay focused will be key to the major tour
