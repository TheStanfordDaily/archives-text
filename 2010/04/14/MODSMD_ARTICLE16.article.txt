A chilly day in Berkeley ush

of a rain-free day did not hold
true, the promise of an exciting,
close meet did come to fruition.
While the Stanford men won the

meet, the women's side came
down to the last event, the 4x400

The meet was laid out with

point respectively. In the relays,

the 100 meters with a time of
10.59 seconds and the 200 me
ters with a personal best time of
21.59 seconds.
"It was one of the best days of
my college career," said Belch,
who is a Daily columnist. "I
knew that I had those times in
me, it was just a matter of putting
it together in one race, and I def
initely did."
Also faring well in the sprints
and hurdles was sophomore
Amaechi Morton, who won the
400-meter hurdles with a time of
51.13, and placed second in the

3:49.80, and senior Justin Mar
