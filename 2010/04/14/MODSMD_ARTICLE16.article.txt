# SPLIT-DECISION
## Men win Big Meet, but women fall to Cal in final event 
### ANARGHYA VARDHANA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
A chilly day in Berkeley ush
ered in the 116 th Big Meet be
tween Stanford and UC-Berke
ley, fondly or not so fondly
known as Cal. While the promise
of a rain-free day did not hold
true, the promise of an exciting,
close meet did come to fruition.
While the Stanford men won the

meet, the women's side came
down to the last event, the 4x400
relay, which resulted in a Cal
win.
The meet was laid out with
first through third scoring five
points, three points and one
point respectively. In the relays,
the first place team scored five
points, with the losing team scor
ing no points.
On the men's side, senior

Danny Belch led the Cardinal
with two meet titles, in both the
100 and 200 meters. Belch won
the 100 meters with a time of
10.59 seconds and the 200 me
ters with a personal best time of
21.59 seconds.
"It was one of the best days of
my college career," said Belch,
who is a Daily columnist. "I
knew that I had those times in
me, it was just a matter of putting
it together in one race, and I def
initely did."
Also faring well in the sprints
and hurdles was sophomore
Amaechi Morton, who won the
400-meter hurdles with a time of
51.13, and placed second in the
110 hurdles with a time of 14.58
seconds.
To close out the sprints, the
Cardinal captured another
event with the 400 meters, with
freshman Spencer Chase win
ning the event with a time of
48.12 seconds.
In the middle distances, soph
omore Dylan Ferris had an ex
cellent run, winning the 800 me
ters with a time of 1:48.79. Plac
ing third in the event was fresh
man Andrew Berberick. The
1,500 meters also proved a suc
cessful event for the Cardinal,
with junior Elliott Heath win
ning the event with a time of
3:49.80, and senior Justin Mar
pole-Bird placing third with a
time of 3:50.61. Sophomore
Chris Derrick also won the 3,000
meters easily, coming in a full
three seconds ahead of second
place finisher Marpole-Bird.
Stanford runners had nine of the
top 11 finishes in the race.
The Stanford men also fared
well in the field events, with
freshman Jules Sharpe captur
ing the high jump title with a
mark of 6-9. Sophomore Geof
frey Tabor scored twice for the
Cardinal, winning the discus
with a mark of 174-0 and placing
second in the shot put with a
mark of 49-7. Redshirt junior
Carter Wells also scored twice,
winning the hammer throw with
a toss of 194-0 and placing third
in the discus with a mark of 159-

The men's track and field team won its fourth consecutive Big
Meet over Cal this past weekend. The Card put on a dominating
performance, scoring 93.50 points to Cal's 69.50.
0. The final win of the field events
came from freshman Robert Hintz,
who won the javelin with a throw of
194-2.

The meet was incredibly close on
the women's side. The women were
led by senior Griffin Matthew, who
set the bar high by winning three in
dividual events and a relay. Matthew
started the day off with a win in the
long jump, leaping a personal best
mark of 21-1.5, which should be
enough to secure her spot in the
postseason. Matthew has qualified
for the NCAA Championships in the
100 and long jump in the past, and
should easily qualify once again this
year.

At Big Meet, Matthew won the
100 meters and 200 meters with
times of 11.51 and 23.87 respectively.
Matthew was also a part of the win
ning 4xloo meter relay, along with
junior Brittni Dixon-Smith, junior
Shataya Hendricks and freshman
Carissa Levingston.
Hendricks and Levingston also
scored points for the Cardinal
women in the individual events, as
sisting in a sprints sweep for the
women. Levingston finished second
in both the 100 and 200, with times of
11.65 and 23.93, while Hendricks fin

ished third in both events, with times
of 12.03 and 24.43.
In the distance events, the Cardi
nal women were led by senior
Madeleine O'Meara, who won the
3,000 meter steeplechase with a time
of 10:47.70, with sophomore Emma
Miller-Bedell finishing third with a
time of 11:03.04. A brutal event, the
steeplechase requires the runner to

jump over several large hurdles
throughout the race, and also re
quires a splash through a make-shift
pond.
The women had an exceedingly
good day in the field events as well,
with senior Jaynie Goodbody lead
ing the way. Goodbody won both the
hammer throw and the shot put, with
marks of 185-2 and 43-4.25, respec
tively. In addition to her two meet ti
tles, Goodbody also placed second in
the javelin with a toss of 136-11.
Stanford junior Liz Minoofar cap
tured the javelin title with a mark of
142-3.
Sophomore Katerina Stefanidi, a
consistently excellent pole vaulter,
captured the meet title in the event
with a mark of 13-5.75. Her skill and
ability is only slightly showcased by
the fact that she passed on several
heights before clearing 13-5.75,
which was not a personal best, but
enough to win the event title.
Despite a number of excellent
performances and event titles, the
Stanford women were unable to cap
ture the meet title, and lost their first
Big Meet after a 10-year winning
streak. Needless to say, the Cardinal
will meet Cal with a vengeance in the
upcoming Brutus Hamilton Meet, as
well as Pac-10 Championships,
which will both be hosted on enemy
territory.
