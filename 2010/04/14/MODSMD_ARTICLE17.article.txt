# The
						highs and lows of Twitter

When a 26 year old former
Super Bowl MVP is trad
ed, it raises eyebrows.
When it's only for a fifth
round pick, it drops jaws.
Such is the case of Santonio Holmes,
formerly of the Pittsburgh Steelers and cur
rently of the New York Jets. Holmes was
traded over the weekend after the Steelers,
known league-wide for their emphasis on
character, deemed him unworthy of the
black and gold. While his transgressions
marijuana usage, alleged domestic abuse
would get a shrug from many organiza
tions, they didn't from Pittsburgh, who
would have released him if they didn't find
a trading partner. But they did, and the
biggest transaction of the new decade fol
lowed.
But this is not a column extolling the
virtues of a morally guided organization.
Leave that to Rick Reilly. Instead, let's look
at the events leading up to Pittsburgh's dis
illusionment with Holmes and the ramifi
cations therein. Specifically, let's look at
Twitter.
A friend described Twitter as the single
biggest threat to public relations profes
sionals and other athlete handlers. Why?
Examine the record. Holmes, who will be
suspended for the first four games of 2010
for violating the NFL's substance abuse
policy, tweeted about a "wake n bake,"
which, as any college student can confirm.

has a little something to do with pot. But
that's not all: in the wake of his domestic
disturbance case, Holmes told a critical fol
lower of his Twitter feed to "kill urself." Did
those two incidents directly lead to Holmes
being traded? Hard to say. But when you
essentially confirm that you're smoking
Mary Jane and viscerally react to a sup
posed fan over an act of violence, it can only
confirm prior beliefs.

These are the pitfalls of Twitter, or any
avenue, microblogging or otherwise, that
allows for athletes to directly interact with
the public. While the overall media rela
tions scene is still largely similar to the one
of the olden days of 2006, there are now
easier ways to sidestep accepted norms
namely, social networks. Twitter enabled
Robert Henson of the Washington Red
skins to call out his team's fans, Terrell
Owens to take a swipe at Tony Romo and
Holmes to dig himself deeper into a hole.
Some players, like Owens, don't control
themselves on camera, either, but for oth
ers, the internet enables a "keyboard war
rior" mentality that may otherwise be ab
sent.

But while there are obvious issues
posed by Twitter, it also has a number of
positive uses in the sports world. For exam
ple, I know a talk show host who secured
guests of high stature just by chatting with
