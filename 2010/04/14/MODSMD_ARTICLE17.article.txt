# The 						highs and lows of Twitter

### Wyndam Makowsky Between the lines 
When a 26 year old former
Super Bowl MVP is trad
ed, it raises eyebrows.
When it's only for a fifth
round pick, it drops jaws.
Such is the case of Santonio Holmes,
formerly of the Pittsburgh Steelers and cur
rently of the New York Jets. Holmes was
traded over the weekend after the Steelers,
known league-wide for their emphasis on
character, deemed him unworthy of the
black and gold. While his transgressions
marijuana usage, alleged domestic abuse
would get a shrug from many organiza
tions, they didn't from Pittsburgh, who
would have released him if they didn't find
a trading partner. But they did, and the
biggest transaction of the new decade fol
lowed.
But this is not a column extolling the
virtues of a morally guided organization.
Leave that to Rick Reilly. Instead, let's look
at the events leading up to Pittsburgh's dis
illusionment with Holmes and the ramifi
cations therein. Specifically, let's look at
Twitter.
A friend described Twitter as the single
biggest threat to public relations profes
sionals and other athlete handlers. Why?
Examine the record. Holmes, who will be
suspended for the first four games of 2010
for violating the NFL's substance abuse
policy, tweeted about a "wake n bake,"
which, as any college student can confirm.

has a little something to do with pot. But
that's not all: in the wake of his domestic
disturbance case, Holmes told a critical fol
lower of his Twitter feed to "kill urself." Did
those two incidents directly lead to Holmes
being traded? Hard to say. But when you
essentially confirm that you're smoking
Mary Jane and viscerally react to a sup
posed fan over an act of violence, it can only
confirm prior beliefs.

These are the pitfalls of Twitter, or any
avenue, microblogging or otherwise, that
allows for athletes to directly interact with
the public. While the overall media rela
tions scene is still largely similar to the one
of the olden days of 2006, there are now
easier ways to sidestep accepted norms
namely, social networks. Twitter enabled
Robert Henson of the Washington Red
skins to call out his team's fans, Terrell
Owens to take a swipe at Tony Romo and
Holmes to dig himself deeper into a hole.
Some players, like Owens, don't control
themselves on camera, either, but for oth
ers, the internet enables a "keyboard war
rior" mentality that may otherwise be ab
sent.

But while there are obvious issues
posed by Twitter, it also has a number of
positive uses in the sports world. For exam
ple, I know a talk show host who secured
guests of high stature just by chatting with

them through tweets his program
went from sometimes having no call-ins
at all to having professional athletes on
a week-to-week basis. It is not a conven
tional way of securing talent, but it
works.
My own experience with Twitter
through the lens of a reporter has been
enlightening. Although initially appre
hensive of the platform, I set up the
Daily's sports account and have curat
ed it since. A number of current, future
and past Stanford athletes have ac
counts and, while much is not athletical
ly focused, it has become valuable if
only for the nuggets of information it
provides.
Ekom Udofia, for instance, is train
ing for the NFL Draft. He posted his
bench press reps and 10-yard split times
on Twitter for all to see. When he threw
up an impressive 35 (or 36, depending
on who you ask) repetitions of 225
pounds at the Cardinal's Pro Day, it was
seen as a fairly surprising total. But for
followers of his tweets, it appeared on
par with what he'd been doing previ
ously.
His coach, Jim Harbaugh, is a noto
rious tweeter with 329,000 followers to
his name. His posts range from 40-yard
dash times to recruit signings to practice
thoughts to the academic success of his
players. Again: isolated yet helpful
pieces of knowledge. As a reporter, it
only helps.
It holds interest for fans, too. A num
ber of Stanford women's basketball
coaches and players have accounts and
tweet about their road trips and send
out virtual thanks to their supporters.
It adds up to this: Holmes presents a
social networking horror story, and in
deed, there is great potential for harm.
But for the cognizant athlete â€”of
which Stanford has an abundance it
provides a safe, yet unfiltered commu
nication tool.
As more and more players flock to
Twitter, the previous barriers to direct
contact continue to break down. Con
trary to the experiences of a few indi
viduals, the situation that presents is
not an inherently dire one.
