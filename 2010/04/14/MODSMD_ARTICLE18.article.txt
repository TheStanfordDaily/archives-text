## Lacrosse suffers first conference loss 
### 
The No. 11 Stanford women's lacrosse
team fell at Denver 17-12 on Sunday for its
first Mountain Pacific Sports Federation
(MPSF) defeat.
The Cardinal (8-5,2-1 MPSF) and the
Pioneers (10-4, 4-0) came into the match
as the only two teams without a loss in
MPSF play. Unfortunately for Stanford,
junior goalkeeper Annie Read could not
play, so the Cardinal started with a major
disadvantage. Read is the only goalkeeper
on Stanford's roster and had been the only
player in goal for the Cardinal for almost
two years. Freshman defender Elizabeth
Adam filled in as goalkeeper for the
match and made five saves in the second
half, but it was not enough to overcome
the Pioneer attack.
Stanford outshot Denver 40-26, but Pi
oneer goalkeeper Ashley Harman made

16 saves to help the home team come out
on top.
Junior attacker Sarah Flynn led the
Cardinal with four goals and an assist,
while senior attacker Claire Hubbard
added three goals and two assists. Lauren
Ciccomascolo and Bonnie Wells led the
Pioneers with four goals apiece.
The Cardinal will finish its regular sea
son with three straight home conference
matches, starting with a matchup with
Oregon on Friday at 6 p.m. at Cagan Stadi
um. In two weeks, Stanford will head back
to Denver for the MPSF Championships.
