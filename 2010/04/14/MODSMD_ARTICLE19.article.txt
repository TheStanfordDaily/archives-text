# Romero named MPSF co-Player of the Week
## 
### â€” Jacob Jaffe 
Men's volleyball senior opposite Evan
Romero was named the MPSF co-Player
of the Week along with UC-Irvine's Car
son Clark. It is Romero's first conference
award of the season.
Romero had 50 kills and 10 digs in
two important wins over No. 3 Pep
perdine and No. 6 USC over the
weekend. He had 37 kills in the Pep
perdine match a career high and
one off the national high for the sea
son. Romero's kills were important,
as five of them came in the fifth set.
For the weekend, Romero hit .422
in his final two regular season match
es at home. The two victories brought
Stanford one win away from a No. 1
seed in the MPSF Tournament. The
Cardinal has two regular season
matches left at UCLA on Friday
and at UC-Irvine on Saturday.
