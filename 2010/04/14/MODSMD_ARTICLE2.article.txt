# What to do with senators abroad?
## Senate grapples with absences, special fees error 
### ZOE RICHARDS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Post-election debriefing is underway, and
ASSU undergraduate senators have a bone to
pick with Ben Jensen' 12, who was elected Satur
day to the 12th Undergraduate Senate.
Senator Alex Katz 'l2 authored a bill this
week mandating the on campus presence of
elected senators for the full duration of their
term, excusing only short departures from cam
pus— and barring altogether quarters spent
abroad, in Washington or otherwise away from
campus.
The legislation arrives in light of a report in
The Daily on Monday that Jensen, despite hav
ing signed a declaration of intent last month
confirming his intent to be on campus through
out his term, has accepted a spot in a Bing Over
seas Studies Program in Berlin for the upcoming
fall, just months after taking office.
"The name of the ASSU has been taken
through the mud with regard to credibility and

ethics," said Senator Anton Zietsman 'l2, offer
ing an amendment to the bill that would have it
apply to the incoming Senate, not the 13th Sen
ate a year from now. "I think it is very appropri
ate for this bill to apply to the 12th Undergradu
ate Senate because of "this declaration of intent."
Zietsman said his intent was not to "kick out"
Jensen from office, but rather to press Jensen to
decide between a quarter abroad and a quarter
on campus as senator.
Katz, the chair of the Administration &
Rules Committee, did not support the amend
ment. He did make explicit that he found
Jensen's signing of the declaration "unethical"
given Jensen's full knowledge that he might be
off campus during part of his term.
"He purposely did not tell the student body,"
Katz said. "In my opinion, undergraduates could
not make an informed decision."
Elections Commissioner Quinn Slack 'll
said in March that all candidates were required
to sign a declaration to get onto the ballot. He
said this week that Senator-elect Kamil Saeid 'l3

and another candidate had not turned in paper
declarations, but that Saeid e-mailed him one.
Slack said he allowed them on the ballot any
way because their intent was made clear when
they started a candidate petition, and that none
of the candidates who turned in declarations, in
cluding Jensen, struck out any provisions.
In the 11th Senate, two-term Senator Shelley

Gao 'll used Skype to tune into meetings from
Stanford in Washington in the fall. Both Adam
Creasman 'll and Zachary Warma 'll are off
campus this quarter.
"Frankly, I think it is a little hypocritical,"
Mohammed Ali 'lO said, adding that current

Undergraduate Senate Deputy Chair Kelsei Wharton '12, left, Chair Varun Sivaram '11 and Appropriations
Chair Anton Zietsman '12 met Tuesday. Zietsman introduced an amendment to a bill
that would bar an incoming senator from serving in office while he is abroad in the fall. Sivaram
opposed the measure, which ultimately failed, calling it a "personal attack." Wharton, who will
serve in the Senate next year as ASSU vice president, asked why the Senate has not already ruled
on the issue of elected students going to Washington, D.C. and abroad. The group is expected to
vote on a bill next week that would forbid the conflict effective during the 2011-2012 term.
