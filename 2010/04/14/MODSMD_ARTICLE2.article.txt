# What to do with senators abroad?
## Senate grapples with absences, special fees error 
### ZOE RICHARDS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Post-election debriefing is underway, and
ASSU undergraduate senators have a bone to
pick with Ben Jensen' 12, who was elected Satur
day to the 12th Undergraduate Senate.
Senator Alex Katz 'l2 authored a bill this
week mandating the on campus presence of
elected senators for the full duration of their
term, excusing only short departures from cam
pus— and barring altogether quarters spent
abroad, in Washington or otherwise away from
campus.
The legislation arrives in light of a report in
The Daily on Monday that Jensen, despite hav
ing signed a declaration of intent last month
confirming his intent to be on campus through
out his term, has accepted a spot in a Bing Over
seas Studies Program in Berlin for the upcoming
fall, just months after taking office.
"The name of the ASSU has been taken
through the mud with regard to credibility and

ethics," said Senator Anton Zietsman 'l2, offer
ing an amendment to the bill that would have it
apply to the incoming Senate, not the 13th Sen
ate a year from now. "I think it is very appropri
ate for this bill to apply to the 12th Undergradu
ate Senate because of "this declaration of intent."
Zietsman said his intent was not to "kick out"
Jensen from office, but rather to press Jensen to
decide between a quarter abroad and a quarter
on campus as senator.
Katz, the chair of the Administration &
Rules Committee, did not support the amend
ment. He did make explicit that he found
Jensen's signing of the declaration "unethical"
given Jensen's full knowledge that he might be
off campus during part of his term.
"He purposely did not tell the student body,"
Katz said. "In my opinion, undergraduates could
not make an informed decision."
Elections Commissioner Quinn Slack 'll
said in March that all candidates were required
to sign a declaration to get onto the ballot. He
said this week that Senator-elect Kamil Saeid 'l3

and another candidate had not turned in paper
declarations, but that Saeid e-mailed him one.
Slack said he allowed them on the ballot any
way because their intent was made clear when
they started a candidate petition, and that none
of the candidates who turned in declarations, in
cluding Jensen, struck out any provisions.
In the 11th Senate, two-term Senator Shelley

Gao 'll used Skype to tune into meetings from

Undergraduate Senate Deputy Chair Kelsei Wharton '12, left, Chair Varun Sivaram '11 and Appropriations
Chair Anton Zietsman '12 met Tuesday. Zietsman introduced an amendment to a bill
that would bar an incoming senator from serving in office while he is abroad in the fall. Sivaram
opposed the measure, which ultimately failed, calling it a "personal attack." Wharton, who will
serve in the Senate next year as ASSU vice president, asked why the Senate has not already ruled
on the issue of elected students going to Washington, D.C. and abroad. The group is expected to
vote on a bill next week that would forbid the conflict effective during the 2011-2012 term.
senators who served terms off cam
pus "can't be glazed over."
Dean Young 'll deemed Skype a
"nuisance."

After leaving the meeting early,
Senator-elect Jensen reappeared in
the heat of challenges made to his le
gitimacy as incoming senator to field
questions about his conduct during
elections, particularly with regard to
the declaration he signed.
Jensen said he had not fully com
mitted to a decision to go to Berlin
until three days after he signed the
declaration. He said he should have
read the clauses of the declaration
more carefully before signing it.
While many newly elected sena
tors agreed that Jensen's behavior
was regrettable, none indicated a de
sire to remove Jensen from his antici
pated seat in the 12th Senate.

Senate Chair Varun Sivaram 'll
said he did not support the bill with
Zietsman's amendment, and suggest
ed that applying the bill to a member
of the recently elected Senate would
be a "personal attack" on Jensen.
Deputy chair and incoming ASSU
Vice President Kelsei Wharton 'l2
questioned why such a bill had not

been written earlier in the year if
not during Gao's absence, then surely
when the body was informed of
Warma's and Creasman's plans to
leave campus.

Jensen has said he would "do the
best job that is possible" as senator,
calling into Senate and committee
meetings via Skype, even at odd
hours.

The normal time for Senate meet
ings is 7 p.m. PST on Tuesdays, which
would translate to a 4 a.m. Skype call
from Berlin on Wednesday morning.
It is unclear which committees Jensen
would serve on, and when they would
meet.

After a straw-poll, with Zietsman
alone supporting his own amend
ment, Katz rejected the amendment.
The bill will likely be voted on next
week.

The Senate passed all funding bills
and unanimously passed two modifi
cations to the joint bylaws, legislating
how and when the Graduate Student
Council (GSC) and Senate inform
one another about funding meetings
and how the bodies will determine
appropriate funding for joint events.

Special Fees Error?
The Senate discussed alleged mis
calculations by last year's Elections
Commission, indicating that students
have been overcharged $l4 each to
ward their student activities fee.

ASSU Financial Manager Matt
McLaughlin 'OB announced that by its
own error, ASSU has wrongly been
collecting what totals $90,000 from
students for six groups that failed to
garner enough votes to gain special
fees funding during last year's elec
tion.

McLaughlin reported recommen
dations made by Student Financial
Services to "do nothing," especially
given the difficulty of executing such
a fix. McLaughlin outlined the chal
lenges of redistributing dollars owed,
suggesting that students abroad and
students requesting refunds, to name
a few, must be accounted for and ex
cluded when returning dollars.
Alternately, the Senate could leg
islate to refund students through the
buffer fund or account for the money
by deducting it from the student fee
toward next year.
McLaughlin also suggested that if
the Senate decides to undertake re
turning the money to students, they
may have to deal with paying Student
Financial Services for extra hours to
disentangle who is owed what.
As an alternative, Student Activi
ties and Leadership Director Nanci
Howe suggested offering students a
$l4 credit of sorts to sidestep poten
tial legal and logistical issues.

Undergraduate Senate Deputy Chair Kelsei Wharton '12, left, Chair Varun Sivaram '11 and Appropriations
Chair Anton Zietsman '12 met Tuesday. Zietsman introduced an amendment to a bill
that would bar an incoming senator from serving in office while he is abroad in the fall. Sivaram
opposed the measure, which ultimately failed, calling it a "personal attack." Wharton, who will
serve in the Senate next year as ASSU vice president, asked why the Senate has not already ruled
on the issue of elected students going to Washington, D.C. and abroad. The group is expected to
vote on a bill next week that would forbid the conflict effective during the 2011-2012 term.
senators who served terms off cam
pus "can't be glazed over."
Dean Young 'll deemed Skype a
"nuisance."

After leaving the meeting early,
Senator-elect Jensen reappeared in
the heat of challenges made to his le
gitimacy as incoming senator to field
questions about his conduct during
elections, particularly with regard to
the declaration he signed.
Jensen said he had not fully com
mitted to a decision to go to Berlin
until three days after he signed the
declaration. He said he should have
read the clauses of the declaration
more carefully before signing it.
While many newly elected sena
tors agreed that Jensen's behavior
was regrettable, none indicated a de
sire to remove Jensen from his antici
pated seat in the 12th Senate.

Senate Chair Varun Sivaram 'll
said he did not support the bill with
Zietsman's amendment, and suggest
ed that applying the bill to a member
of the recently elected Senate would
be a "personal attack" on Jensen.
Deputy chair and incoming ASSU
Vice President Kelsei Wharton 'l2
questioned why such a bill had not

been written earlier in the year if
not during Gao's absence, then surely
when the body was informed of
Warma's and Creasman's plans to
leave campus.

Jensen has said he would "do the
best job that is possible" as senator,
calling into Senate and committee
meetings via Skype, even at odd
hours.

The normal time for Senate meet
ings is 7 p.m. PST on Tuesdays, which
would translate to a 4 a.m. Skype call
from Berlin on Wednesday morning.
It is unclear which committees Jensen
would serve on, and when they would
meet.

After a straw-poll, with Zietsman
alone supporting his own amend
ment, Katz rejected the amendment.
The bill will likely be voted on next
week.

The Senate passed all funding bills
and unanimously passed two modifi
cations to the joint bylaws, legislating
how and when the Graduate Student
Council (GSC) and Senate inform
one another about funding meetings
and how the bodies will determine
appropriate funding for joint events.

Special Fees Error?
The Senate discussed alleged mis
calculations by last year's Elections
Commission, indicating that students
have been overcharged $l4 each to
ward their student activities fee.

ASSU Financial Manager Matt
McLaughlin 'OB announced that by its
own error, ASSU has wrongly been
collecting what totals $90,000 from
students for six groups that failed to
garner enough votes to gain special
fees funding during last year's elec
tion.

McLaughlin reported recommen
dations made by Student Financial
Services to "do nothing," especially
given the difficulty of executing such
a fix. McLaughlin outlined the chal
lenges of redistributing dollars owed,
suggesting that students abroad and
students requesting refunds, to name
a few, must be accounted for and ex
cluded when returning dollars.
Alternately, the Senate could leg
islate to refund students through the
buffer fund or account for the money
by deducting it from the student fee
toward next year.
McLaughlin also suggested that if
the Senate decides to undertake re
turning the money to students, they
may have to deal with paying Student
Financial Services for extra hours to
disentangle who is owed what.
As an alternative, Student Activi
ties and Leadership Director Nanci
Howe suggested offering students a
$l4 credit of sorts to sidestep poten
tial legal and logistical issues.

Post-election debriefing is underway, and
ASSU undergraduate senators have a bone to
pick with Ben Jensen' 12, who was elected Satur
day to the 12th Undergraduate Senate.
Senator Alex Katz 'l2 authored a bill this
week mandating the on campus presence of
elected senators for the full duration of their
term, excusing only short departures from cam
pus— and barring altogether quarters spent
abroad, in Washington or otherwise away from
campus.
The legislation arrives in light of a report in
The Daily on Monday that Jensen, despite hav
ing signed a declaration of intent last month
confirming his intent to be on campus through
out his term, has accepted a spot in a Bing Over
seas Studies Program in Berlin for the upcoming
fall, just months after taking office.
"The name of the ASSU has been taken
through the mud with regard to credibility and

ethics," said Senator Anton Zietsman 'l2, offer
ing an amendment to the bill that would have it
apply to the incoming Senate, not the 13th Sen
ate a year from now. "I think it is very appropri
ate for this bill to apply to the 12th Undergradu
ate Senate because of "this declaration of intent."
Zietsman said his intent was not to "kick out"
Jensen from office, but rather to press Jensen to
decide between a quarter abroad and a quarter
on campus as senator.
Katz, the chair of the Administration &
Rules Committee, did not support the amend
ment. He did make explicit that he found
Jensen's signing of the declaration "unethical"
given Jensen's full knowledge that he might be
off campus during part of his term.
"He purposely did not tell the student body,"
Katz said. "In my opinion, undergraduates could
not make an informed decision."
Elections Commissioner Quinn Slack 'll
said in March that all candidates were required
to sign a declaration to get onto the ballot. He
said this week that Senator-elect Kamil Saeid 'l3

and another candidate had not turned in paper
declarations, but that Saeid e-mailed him one.
Slack said he allowed them on the ballot any
way because their intent was made clear when
they started a candidate petition, and that none
of the candidates who turned in declarations, in
cluding Jensen, struck out any provisions.
