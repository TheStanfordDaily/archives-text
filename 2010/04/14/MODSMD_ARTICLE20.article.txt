# It's all about the money

What some fans often
forget is that sports
are, above all, busi
nesses. In the pro
fessional ranks,
owners look at their teams as assets,
while at the collegiate level, universi
ties and the NCAA as a whole aim to
use athletics to generate profit.
But when does business get in the
way of the games themselves and of
the fans' experiences?
Recently, it seems that the answer
to that question is "too often."
Should a Major League Baseball
team's owner who receives revenue
sharing money from other teams be
required to use that money to im
prove his team?
For me, the answer is yes. Too
often, owners have been able to use
revenue sharing dollars to increase
profits without attempting to put the
best team out on the diamond. It has
happened in Kansas City, Pittsburgh
and almost any other city with peren
nially bad teams. This past offseason,
the Florida Marlins were even
warned by Major League Baseball
for not spending enough of the
money they received from revenue
sharing.
It's like the government making
sure food stamps are actually used on
food it's common sense.
Like it or not, as a sports fan, you
would rather be a fan of teams like
the Yankees and the Red Sox, who
make it abundantly clear that their
priority is to win games, not to pinch
every penny. Maybe the owners that
skimp off the top might actually do
better if they invested more in their
teams.
Obviously, the Yankees and the
Red Sox are at inherent advantages
because of the size of their markets,
but that does not stop their primary
interest from being winning, which
isn't always the case elsewhere.
Which raises the question, is it
bad for their respective sports for the
Yankees or the Lakers to be the best
teams in their leagues year in and
year out? Not for the MLB or NBA,
it isn't. When the large market teams
are doing well, they make money. It's
not bad for the fans either. Both
teams, like the Patriots in football or
the Red Wings in hockey, are com
pletely invested in winning at all
costs, meaning the backlash against
the large markets, to me, is unfound
ed.
Would the MLB, the fans or any
one besides opponents be happy if
George Steinbrenner, John Henry or
Jerry Buss simply profited more at the
expense of their team's success? I
doubt it.
While MLB owners can be bad,
the NCAA may be the worst.
Currently, the NCAA is exploring
the idea of expanding the NCAA
Basketball Tournament from 65
teams to 96 teams, which would be, in
essence, messing up the best thing the
NCAA does: March Madness.
No matter how the NCAA frames
it, the idea is to make more money.
More games equals pricier TV deals,
more tickets and concessions sold,
and thus, higher profits. It doesn't
take a Stanford student to figure that
out.
March Madness is quite possibly
the best sporting event there is each
year. Thousands of Americans be
come temporary basketball fans
every March because of it. Now the
NCAA wants to make the 9-16 seeds
play an extra "play-in" game to get in
the tournament. Who really wants to
watch the Northeast Conference run
ner-up play the third place team from
the Ohio Valley Conference for the
right to be pummeled by Kansas or
Duke in the first round? Quinnipiac
versus Eastern Illinois. Sounds
thrilling.
Seriously though, I wouldn't
watch it, and neither would you.
Hardly anyone watches the play-in
game that currently exists. And the
excuse that bubble teams won't have
gripes about not getting in anymore if
the tournament has 96 is ludicrous.
Now the 97th and 98th teams will be
the ones crying. Where will it end?
But hey, it's all about the money.
Which is why the NCAA won't fix
its real problem: the Bowl Champi
onship Series in football. I've written
about the stupidity of the BCS be
fore, so I won't bore you with it, but I
