## Draw applications open today 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Elizabeth Titus 
Applications to the 2010-11 housing draw which will offer
no less than 180 combinations of residences and room type op
tions, according to Student Housing open today.
Among changes to this year's draw, which are listed on the
Student Housing Web site, students may now choose "umbrella"
options in their housing application, like "any east campus resi
dence hall" or "any upper Row self-op."
Suites will no longer allow mixed-gender six-person draw
groups, though four-person groups of mixed gender will still be
permitted.
In Rains, some units will be converted to shelter "overflow"
undergraduates as soon as fall quarter, a move that had some
graduate students up in arms last week about younger students'
possible incursion into social life in the complex.
Assignments to focus houses Branner, Adelfa, Murray and
Toyon will be made separately ahead of the draw, while stu
dents looking to draw into those houses as non-focus residents
will go through the regular draw.
Sorority and fraternity members living in Greek houses "will
have their tier years removed," Housing said. "If they need cam
pus housing, they will have their years returned beginning with
tier three for the first year, tier two for
the second year, etc."
And in Bob, La Casa Italiana and
Storey, in-house draws may not take
place until "late summer" because
capital improvement projects could
affect room configurations before
then.
Housing said it would continue to
assign some students who return to
campus winter quarter to Oak Creek
and Escondido Village.
The disability draw deadline is
April 16; pre-assignment, April 22;
regular draw, May 9.
