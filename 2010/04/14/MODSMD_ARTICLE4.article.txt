## Hennessy signs on to Judicial Affairs change Pilot program will offer an alternate process for hearing rape, stalking cases on campus 
### ELIZABETH TITUS MANAGING EDITOR 
President Hennessy has signed the Alternate Misconduct
Review Process, a plan developed by the Board on Judicial
Affairs that changes the way sexual assault cases are handled
at Stanford.

The new plan, a pilot that will be assessed in fall 2011,
makes the process for hearing accusations of rape, harass
ment, dating violence and stalking among students faster
and more private, said a board member.
The draft of the plan sent to Hennessy was made avail
able on the board's Web site, where the board began posting
public minutes for the first time earlier this year.
Among the most significant changes to the current
process is the elimination of the requirement that alleged
victims and suspects attend the same panel hearings during
a case and, in some instances, answer questions about the al
leged misconduct in each other's presence.
That feature of the current process has been derided by
board and community members alike for serving as what
they call a deterrent to victims to pursue cases against their
attackers at Stanford.
"The current system is broken,"
said Tommy Tobin TO, a board
member and judicial panelist. "This
is a step in the right direction." He
said the board's approval of the
plan on April 6 was not unanimous.

Board President Nate Chambers
described the rigor of the year-long
discussions leading to the board's
approval of the plan on April 6.
"This pilot program has gone
through intense analysis and is the
result of a long and open discussion
between both faculty and students,"
Chambers wrote in an e-mail to

The Daily. A graduate student in
computer science, Chambers be
came board president spring quar
ter after past president Ben David
son, a law student, graduated.
"Students who serve as judicial
panelists, faculty and Board mem
bers were part of the group" to de

velop the initial proposal, Cham
bers said.

Hennessy emphasized on Tues
day that the program is a pilot,
which means the board will decide
in fall 2011 whether or not it should
continue.

Board and community members,
including some who gave input on
the alternate process this year, ac
knowledge that the number of sex
ual assaults that occur on campus
each year probably far exceeds the
number of cases pursued in Judicial
Affairs to hold accused students re
sponsible.

The Office of Judicial Affairs
oversaw 123 cases involving accusa
tions ranging from academic cheat
ing to sexual assault during the 2008-
2009 academic year. One sexual mis
conduct case, which typically consti
tutes a Fundamental Standard viola
tion, was heard in fall 2008, the most
recent quarter for which statistics
are publicly available.
