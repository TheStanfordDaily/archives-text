## Hennessy signs on to Judicial Affairs change Pilot program will offer an alternate process for hearing rape, stalking cases on campus 
### ELIZABETH TITUS MANAGING EDITOR 
President Hennessy has signed the Alternate Misconduct
Review Process, a plan developed by the Board on Judicial
Affairs that changes the way sexual assault cases are handled
at Stanford.

The new plan, a pilot that will be assessed in fall 2011,
makes the process for hearing accusations of rape, harass
ment, dating violence and stalking among students faster
and more private, said a board member.
The draft of the plan sent to Hennessy was made avail
able on the board's Web site, where the board began posting
public minutes for the first time earlier this year.
Among the most significant changes to the current
process is the elimination of the requirement that alleged
victims and suspects attend the same panel hearings during
a case and, in some instances, answer questions about the al
leged misconduct in each other's presence.
That feature of the current process has been derided by
board and community members alike for serving as what
they call a deterrent to victims to pursue cases against their
attackers at Stanford.
