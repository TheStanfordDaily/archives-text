## Free speech class is ACLU-inspired Student Initiated Courses negotiate tough issues; faculty consider rigor over balance

Students Amir Badat 'lO and Jeff Tai 'll are working to in
crease student awareness of free speech policies on campus
through PoliSci 92X, a one-unit student initiated course (SIC) on

regarding political classes, according to coordinator Justin
Brooke 'lO, a highly polarized course may raise concerns for the
review panel of faculty members.
"If it's clear that a class seems one-sided, then the panel might
take [that] into account and think that the class was underdevel
oped," Brooke said.
But Peter Pompei, a professor in the School of Medicine who
has judged SIC applications, said this does not necessarily occu
py top priority for the faculty members in charge of approving
courses. Academic value is the most important criterion, he said.
"Not every class has to be balanced," Pompei said. "If some
one's particularly interested in jazz music, for instance, and they
want to present a class on that, we don't expect them to hand us
a curriculum that includes classical and rock. We want to make
sure that whatever is being delivered in the SIC has value and ac
ademic integrity."
"They can present one side without necessarily being bal

added.
Advocating specific political values was never part of the
