## Free speech class is ACLU-inspired Student Initiated Courses negotiate tough issues; faculty consider rigor over balance 
### CASSANDRA FELICIANO STAFF WRITER 
Students Amir Badat 'lO and Jeff Tai 'll are working to in
crease student awareness of free speech policies on campus
through PoliSci 92X, a one-unit student initiated course (SIC) on
free speech in the college context.
Both members of the American Civil Liberties Union's Stan
ford chapter, Badat and Tai were inspired in part by First Amend
ment cases on campus, such as the Stanford Democrats' difficul
ties in executing events during the 2004 and 2008 elections due to
tax issues. The events sparked Badat and Tai's interest in explor
ing free speech issues further.
While the SIC program does not have any special regulations
regarding political classes, according to coordinator Justin
Brooke 'lO, a highly polarized course may raise concerns for the
review panel of faculty members.
"If it's clear that a class seems one-sided, then the panel might
take [that] into account and think that the class was underdevel
oped," Brooke said.
But Peter Pompei, a professor in the School of Medicine who
has judged SIC applications, said this does not necessarily occu
py top priority for the faculty members in charge of approving
courses. Academic value is the most important criterion, he said.
"Not every class has to be balanced," Pompei said. "If some
one's particularly interested in jazz music, for instance, and they
want to present a class on that, we don't expect them to hand us
a curriculum that includes classical and rock. We want to make
sure that whatever is being delivered in the SIC has value and ac
ademic integrity."
"They can present one side without necessarily being bal
anced, but it has to be accurate and founded in knowledge," he
added.
Advocating specific political values was never part of the
agenda for Tai and Badat. They
adamantly emphasized that PoliSci
92X is a non-partisan class because
the topic of free speech requires an
understanding of many sides.
"It's a complicated [and] messy
issue," Tai said. "A lot of things are not
as intuitive as they seem. For every
real cool awesome mobilization that
happens, like the response to West
boro Baptist Church, what allowed
[that] to happen, that is also what al
lows the Westboro Baptist Church.
The same regulations that protect
their rights to stage a counter-protest
have to be extended likewise. There
can't be a double standard."

Tai was referring to a demonstra
tion by members of Westboro Baptist
Church in January on the corner of

Mayfield Avenue and Campus Drive,
which sparked a large simultaneous
gathering of students.
"We're hardly experts on that,"Tai
said. "It's not that we're advocating a
political position or anything like that.
We just want to facilitate discussion."
The discrepancy in the interpreta
tion of what falls under constitutional
protection at Stanford is often inad
vertent and can be attributed to sheer
lack of knowledge, according to Rubi
Ancajas'l2, a Stanford Review writer
whose September 2009 profile of
Stanford cases will be frequently re
ferred to in PoliSci 92X. Although the
topic has come up three or four times
this year, its frequency is difficult to
define and may be more subjective
than it seems, she said.
"We might think something is an
issue of free speech, whereas they
might think something is clearly writ
ten in our policy," she said. "A lot of
times, students do not realize when
they're violating the rules."

For Badat, the ultimate goal of the
course is to further educate Stanford
students, especially those in political
groups, whose demonstrations and
events may not be approved in a time
ly manner because they are not in line
with University policy. The philan
thropic objective was part of the ap
peal of the course, Pompei said.
"[We want to] inform them about
their rights on campus, so if they feel
like their rights are being infringed
upon by administration or by anyone
else, then they know not only that they
have a right to act, but how they can go
about protecting their rights," Badat
said.

PoliSci 92X, which meets in Wal

First Amendment violations are dealt
