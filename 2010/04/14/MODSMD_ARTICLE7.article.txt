## Refund rate is down from winter quarter At more than $99K, special fees refund requests are still second-highest in three years 
### ERIC MESSINGER SENIOR MANAGING EDITOR 
The rate and total amount of special
fees refund requests declined in spring

quarter, potentially reflecting a legisla
tive push made in the winter by the Un
dergraduate Senate.
In total, there were 959 refund re
quests totaling $99,776. Of those re
quests, 322 were for the full amount,
representing students who declined to
fund any student group with special
fees.

The data show a decline from winter
quarter, which had 1,132 requests to

taling $115,794, with 379 requests for
the full amount.

In all major metrics, however the
number of refund requests, the refund
amount requested and requests for the
full amount this quarter represents
the second-highest total over the last
three academic years, indicating that
the baseline for typical refund requests
may have risen substantially.
By contrast, spring quarter 2009 had

886 requests for $82,355, and fall quar
ter 2009 had 788 requests for $79,604.
Also a change from the norm was
the decline from winter to spring this
year, which had not occurred in either
academic year 2008-2009 or 2007-2008.
"Any given year, there are more re
funds in spring than in winter than in
fall," said Senate Appropriations Chair
Anton Zietsman 'l2.
Zietsman credited bills passed
to reduce the burden on special
fees groups and the time wherein
students could request refunds
with the winter-to-spring decline.
Refund requests had been at
the center of debate in the Senate
during winter quarter over special
fees funding for student groups. A
rise in requests and in the cost of
funding the resulting shortfalls for
student groups led senators to seek
reform in a number of areas relat
ing to special fees, including the
ability of students to request re
funds and, more contentiously,
controlling the size of special fees
requests from student groups. This,
in turn, led to debate and con
tention with student group finan
cial officers, who often criticized
both the strictness and transparen
cy of policies and enforcement
measures.

The expected special fees rate
for students next academic year is
expected to be $ll2 per quarter.
Six student groups failed to receive
special fees funding in last week's
election; if all groups had passed,
the rate per quarter would have
been $ll6, Zietsman said.The total
per quarter for this academic year
was $ll9.
The Senate on Tuesday dis
cussed a possible error by last
year's Elections Commission that
may have led to overcharging stu
dents for special fees this year. The
Senate remained undecided about
what its legal and practical options
were for fixing the error.
The numbers for refunds per
quarter for the four quarters pre
ceding 2010 are: fall 2008, 488 re
quests, totaling $43,385,150 full re
funds; winter 2009,660 requests, to
taling $61,156, 230 full refunds;
spring 2009, 886 requests, totaling
$82,355, 284 full refunds; fall 2009,
788 requests, $79,604, 248 full re
funds.
