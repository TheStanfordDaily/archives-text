## Refund rate is down from winter quarter At more than $99K, special fees refund requests are still second-highest in three years 
### ERIC MESSINGER SENIOR MANAGING EDITOR 
The rate and total amount of special
fees refund requests declined in spring

quarter, potentially reflecting a legisla
tive push made in the winter by the Un
dergraduate Senate.
In total, there were 959 refund re
quests totaling $99,776. Of those re
quests, 322 were for the full amount,
representing students who declined to
fund any student group with special
fees.

The data show a decline from winter
quarter, which had 1,132 requests to

taling $115,794, with 379 requests for
the full amount.

In all major metrics, however the
number of refund requests, the refund
amount requested and requests for the
full amount this quarter represents
the second-highest total over the last
three academic years, indicating that
the baseline for typical refund requests
may have risen substantially.
By contrast, spring quarter 2009 had

886 requests for $82,355, and fall quar
ter 2009 had 788 requests for $79,604.
Also a change from the norm was
the decline from winter to spring this
year, which had not occurred in either
academic year 2008-2009 or 2007-2008.
"Any given year, there are more re
funds in spring than in winter than in
fall," said Senate Appropriations Chair
