## 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Eric Messinger 
"Paper or plastic?" may be on its
way out.
The Santa Clara County Board of
Supervisors voted in favor of an ordi
nance that would end the use of paper
and plastic bags for carryout at retail
stores in unincorporated areas in the
county, the San Jose Mercury News re
ported Tuesday.
Stanford, one such unincorporated
area in the county, would be affected by
the ban, which targets "single-use" bags
and is in line with statewide efforts to
introduce environment-friendly meas
ures.

The vote will not have an immedi
ate impact; pending an examination of
the effect of similar initiatives in nearby
areas, including San Jose, a final vote is
set to be held in October.
Palo Alto and San Francisco have
similar bans in place.
Opposition from plastic bag manu
facturers and some retailers, as well as
the results of an environmental report
on the ban, could pose obstacles for the
measure. It is expected that it would af
fect 52 retail businesses in the area.
