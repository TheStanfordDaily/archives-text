## Danner outlines the legal issues of torture In human values lecture, journalist calls post-9/11 America 'a state of exception' 
### MIKE DING SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Acclaimed investigative reporter Mark Danner gave
the first of two Tanner Lectures on Human Values at
Stanford on Wednesday. Danner, a professor of journal
ism at UC-Berkeley and Bard College, discussed the pro
found changes that took place in the American political
landscape after September 11,2001.
Danner said post-9/11 America exists as a "state of ex
ception," which has been characterized by eight primary
features: declaring the war on terror, proclaiming under
the Bush doctrine that terrorists could be attacked wher
ever they were found, redefining terrorists as unlawful
combatants not unprotected by the laws of war, broadly
imposing an aggressive and preventative military para
digm, increasing the power of the executive branch while
excluding the other branches, increasing government se
crecy, improvising solutions to large and complicated po
litical problems and embedding the war on terror in the
American political structure.
"This state transcends the borders of the strictly legal,"
Danner said. "It occupies a position at the limit between
politics and law, an ambiguous borderline fringe between
legal and political realms."
Danner said the dialogue in the media regarding tor
ture has been one of the most salient features of the state
of exception.
"When President Barack Obama, in his elegant ad
dress accepting the Nobel Peace Prize, declares to the
world that he has 'prohibited torture,' we should pause in
our pride and gratitude to notice that torture violates in
ternational and domestic law and that the notion that our
new president has the power to prohibit it follows insidi
ously from the pretense that his predecessor had the
power to order it," he said. "During the near decade-long
state of exception, not only because of what President
George W. Bush decided to do but also because of what
President Obama is every day deciding not to, torture in
America has metamorphosed. Before the war on terror,
official torture was an anathema. Today it is a policy
choice."
In addition to skirting the boundaries of legality, Dan
ner said the United States' method of gathering intelli
gence in the war on terror was highly inefficient. Danner
called this method the "one percent doctrine." If there
were even a one percent chance of terrorists getting a
weapon of mass destruction, he explained, the govern
ment would treat the situation as if it were matter of cer
tainty.
Danner said that the problem with this approach is that
the United States detained suspects for interrogation
who probably had little or no information to divulge, in
cluding at Abu Ghraib, the Iraqi prison.
"I shall call this fact the broken funnel prisoners

clogging and debilitating the intelligence system," he
said. "Prisoners were swept into the system, often on very
flimsy or no evidence, and once in it, stayed there, clog
ging and debilitating it, for there was not only no adver
sary system to judge their guilt or threat a system that,
had it existed, whether administrative or judicial, would
at least have had the effect of forcing the gathering of in
formation. There were no incentives to release them."
Danner urged the audience to reflect on the country's
policies toward torture and indefinite detainment of ter
ror suspects and the people who engaged in that detain
ment.
"As we gaze back today, on this sunny day, on these
ghostly figures, we can have the sense, haunting as it is,
that they are all looking forward at us as we stand here
today judging what they did," he said. "For if we know
anything, it is that they knew that this moment would
come."
Students who came to the event said that Danner's talk
left an impression. Amanda Greene, a doctoral student in
philosophy, said she was particularly struck by Danner's
discussion of torture practices in interrogations of sus
pected terrorists.
"What stood out to me in the talk was his diagnosis of
the post-9/11 state of emergency as one of improvisation
and experimentation," she said. "It's easy to have a knee
jerk moralistic response to torture, but tonight I learned
that during WWII we had a policy on enhanced interro
gation that was nuanced, effective, and legal."
"He convinced me that this is a double moral failing,"
she added, "since it wasn't even effective as a means of in
terrogation."
