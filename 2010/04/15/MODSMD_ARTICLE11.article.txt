## Ravitch critiques education reform 
### ERIC DUNN 
Diane Ravitch, the former assis
tant U.S. Secretary of Education and
onetime supporter of No Child Left
Behind (NCLB), spoke candidly on
Wednesday about her change of
heart concerning the education poli
cy of former President George W.
Bush and charter schools in a ques
tion-and-answer session with Linda
Darling-Hammond, a professor in
Stanford's School of Education.
Ravitch, a senior fellow at the
Brookings Institute and former as
sistant Secretary of Education under
George H.W. Bush, had strong words
for the Obama Administration and
its "Race to the Top" fund, as well as
glowing praise for teachers around
the country.
"No Child Left Behind has failed
... it has become a philosophy of
'measure and punish,'" Ravitch said.
She said proponents of NCLB are
"destroying education and calling it
reform."
Ravitch focused on moving the
dialogue in education reform away
from "measure and punish" and to
ward helping schools and teachers
deal with difficult problems. She dis

couraged policymakers from seeking
blanket solutions to define and ad
dress failing schools and offered an
analogy: "NCLB is like promising to
keep cities crime free and then firing
police officers in cities that don't
meet this impossible goal."
Once a steadfast supporter of
standards, she now believes that
"high stakes testing has encouraged
teachers to teach to the test and
states to cheat the federal govern
ment." Ravitch said standards are
important but that "the language of
education should be a language of
education, not punishment."
On charter schools, Ravitch urged
teachers in charter schools to return
to "serving children with the greatest
need" instead of playing into the
"game" of high-stakes testing.
Linda Darling-Hammond, an ad
visor to President Obama in the 2008
election, asked Ravitch what she
would say to the president if she had
five minutes. Ravitch responded by
saying the federal government
should "remove NCLB sanctions
that are encouraged by the 'Race to
the Top' fund" and "pay for special
education mandates" to remove
burdens from public schools.

Although sometimes a controver
sial figure in education policy de
bates, Ravitch broke her speech sev
eral times to receive overwhelming
applause. In a brief interview with
The Daily afterward, she described
the question-and-answer session as a
"two way exchange of electricity."
Mark Kushner, a lecturer in the
School of Education, offered slight
criticism. "Her presentation was
lacking empirical evidence, which
may be present in her book, to back
up some of her claims about charter
schools," he said.
Jenna Queenan 'll, who attended
the lecture, found the presentation
very informative.
"It was nice to hear a substantive
talk about ideas I agree with, but
which aren't normally in the main
stream," she said.
Ravitch ended her remarks with
one request: "If you have the chance,
thank a teacher," she told the audi
ence.
The lecture was put on by Stan
ford's School of Education Spring
Cubberley Lecture series.
