## EDITORIAL Preserve student e-mail accounts for life 
### 
It is a rare and invaluable occurrence on
campus when student advocacy leads to
far-reaching changes and benefits for stu
dents. Even rarer is when substantial policy
change is enacted that serves not only cur
rent students, but also alumni. After two
years of engaging our campus administra
tion, current ASSU President David Gob
aud's collaborations with University leaders
led to an announcement that students and
alumni would be allowed to retain their
@stanford.edu e-mail addresses for life.
This announcement was made in the fall,
and by the time the winter quarter arrived
there was serious doubt regarding the per
manence of the change. The ASSU once
again reached out to the University, hoping
that IT Services and the administration
would be able to ensure that the plan was car
ried out. Unfortunately last week the plan
was deemed unfeasible and upon leaving a
meeting regarding the policy President Gob
aud was made aware that the graduating
class of 2009 would soon lose their ©Stan
ford.edu e-mail addresses.
In rescinding their decision to forward
Stanford e-mail addresses for life, the Uni
versity cited administrative errors and signif
icant complications that would arise from
maintaining the privilege. Since the policy
has been retracted, countless students are
struck by the swift reversal of a program that
would make all students transitions from
Stanford much more seamless.
Undaunted by the University's sudden re
versal, Gobaud is working to see the plan re
instated before the end of his term in the ex
ecutive. He has contacted all members of the

class of 2009, and has employed his thorough
knowledge of the University to engage un
dergraduate and graduate student leaders
across the University. He has also garnered
countless student leader signatures on a let
ter in which his concerns are succinctly ex
pressed.
In the meantime, the Editorial Board
hopes that the administration will recognize
the need and desire for lifelong
@stanford.edu e-mail addresses and rein
state their original offer. There are relevant
concerns regarding forwarding
@stanford.edu e-mails for life, but all can be
addressed. Worries of not being able to reuse
e-mail addresses or exhausting potential new
SUNetlDs ring hollow, as SUNetlDs are al
ready reserved for perpetuity. An auto-reply
that would be sent to those who e-mail alum
ni would make it impossible for anyone to
pretend they are a current student. Also, the
immeasurable benefits of e-mail forwarding
and the commoditization of e-mail outweigh
the cost of increasing forwarding obligations.
If allowed to retain our @stanford.edu for
life, the access to accounts and resources tied
to our e-mail addresses will be more readily
accessible, freeing newly-graduated students
one more burden to consider in their transi
tion to the real world. We encourage Presi
dent Hennessey and Provost Etchemendy to
push for the implementation of the plan as it
originally stood prior to the retraction.
Though not without small concerns and chal
lenges, preserving student e-mail accounts
for life would go a long way towards helping
the administration match their rhetoric of
concern for student input and preference.
