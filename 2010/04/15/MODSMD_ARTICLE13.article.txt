# ADVENTURES IN ACADEMIA
## The 						Long Battle to Defend Education 
### Danny Crichton 
Higher education, the very source of
American prosperity over the last 50
years, is now very much at risk in the
United States. All one has to do is look at Cal
ifornia, which offers perhaps one of the best
vantage points to see this destruction of edu
cation in action. The state was once the shin
ing beacon of higher education, building the
vast University of California system that
would make the state one of the most dynam
ic economies in the world.
The state, once merely mired in perennial
budget wars, has now waged an aggressive
war against higher education, furloughing
professor and cutting large swaths of stu
dents out of the system.
I wish it were only the budget cuts that
were harming the system. An upturn in the
economy and more flush revenues could eas
ily lead to a reversal of the higher education
downturn. Alas, budget cuts are only the
most recent attack on America's economic
crown jewels.
As the number of laws regulating univer
sities increase with each successive year, the
administration of the modern university
grows ever more complex. Universities in the
1960s had significantly smaller staffs com
pared to our universities today, where the
typical research university now requires
thousands of personnel to handle dense reg
ulations while also providing an ever-ex
panding portfolio of services. For instance,
the UC system last year had almost seven
staff members for every faculty member.
Another source of stress is the grand am
bitions of government and university offi
cials who see their job as increasing the pres
tige of their institutions instead of improving
the core missions of their universities ed
ucating students. Most recently, that has
meant a focus on funded research, a shift that
has taken place over the past few decades but
has been accelerated due to the downturn
and economic stimulus funding.
Unfortunately, the universities being built
to withstand these attacks share very little in
common with the universities of the past few
decades. These new universities are mere
shells of educational institutions, acting more
like factories producing research than acade
mies of learning. That is a troubling develop
ment, because it was the strength and access
available at America's top institutions that
ensured the economic dynamism seen in the
last two decades.
Students from any social class could af
ford to attend a state public school by work
ing and living a modest lifestyle. Today, a full
time job may not even be sufficient to pay for
in-state tuition, in addition to the general ex
penses of life.
As this ladder out of poverty disappears
and social mobility declines, we are begin
ning to see the outlines of a new society, one
where prosperous families continue to find
prosperity while those less fortunate are un
able to leave the poverty cycle. By only devel
oping a slice of America's potential work-

force, we are selling ourselves short and hurt
ing our own economic futures.
In response, we are seeing an academic
fragmentation in higher education. For-prof
it institutions are now the fastest growing
sector in higher education, and many pro
grams are now cutting liberal arts require
ments to focus on "practical training." Such
programs provide a short-term boost to ca
reer outlook, but it is the soft skills that are
taught in the liberal arts that ensure the long
term employment viability of an individual.
The ability to learn new skills, adapt to
changing environments and critically analyze
new phenomenon are the core of an educa
tion, and the core of America's gains in pro
ductivity and economic efficiency.
America's universities need to be de
fended from this fusillade of attacks. As is
typical, finding these solutions is not trivial.
Some commentators have suggested that
the U.S. government nationalize top public
schools in each region and provide them a
dedicated funding source. This would en
sure that school like UC-Berkeley, which
provide a source of innovation for the entire
domestic economy, are not harmed due to
the provincial interests of a single state gov
ernment.
Others have suggested that a more central
administration of higher education is a better
approach. Accrediting agencies could pro
vide an accountability metric and Congress
could promulgate goals for higher education
that would carry more force and align better
with national priorities.
The problem is that neither solution
seems particularly appealing. Defending
higher education is a tough job in a time of
declining tax revenues and a fragmented
population. But this country must fight for
the institutions that helped develop the tal
ent and technology that has made America
so strong over the past half century.
As students, we have an obligation to en
sure that state and federal governments hear
from us. Send your representatives letters,
and be an ambassador of higher education to
your friends and family (i.e. voters). We owe
the future generations of America the oppor
tunity to attend strong universities, and we
must be the ones that begin the outreach to
defend this critical part of the American
economy.
