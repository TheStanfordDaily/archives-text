# ALTERNATIVE LIVING... WITHOUT THE NAKED
## Drama Isn't All That Girly 
### Samantha Toh 
According to a bevy of my menfriends,
girls are to drama as God was to
Adam: we create it, we see it as a bane
to perfection, but we also enjoy it when it
self-propagates. And as much as the idea of
dramatic girls creates a gender stereotype,
for a long time, I was inclined to agree. Hav
ing attended a girls' school for most of my
life, lived with girls, and understood them as
my primary source of emotional connection,
I have also realized that the more girls are in
my life, the higher the level of tension and
emotion.
I have tried to avoid drama at Stanford
and have done so quite successfully. Over the
course of my post-adolescent years, I gained
a fairly strong control of my emotions: I can
refrain from getting emotionally antago
nized, and I can be detached if I need to be. In
the process of doing so, I have also become
much less passionate what I still see as a
necessary trade-off. Passion, after all, is im
portant, but Bront?-esque fits of angst are
hardly states of emotion I aspire to.
The divide between expressiveness and
stolidity is one that I conceptualized and
still do, to some extent as a gendered dif
ference, where women are more complex
and emotional than men are. On a theoretical
level, I knew that men could be as emotional
and complex, and likewise, that uncommu
nicative women do exist. In practice, howev
er, it remained difficult for me to resist
stereotyping, classifying, and falling victim to
gender norms. This tendency has led me, in
my constant escape of complications and
their ensuing emotions, to view male spaces
as a kind of calming refuge, where there is a
certain mindless ease that I can enjoy.
I have found male spaces in spontaneous
ways. By this, I mean that I have barged into
rooms, invaded spaces, and sat on floors,
quite unperturbed by the looks of shock on
the owners' faces. In most occasions, I have
either studied with them in silence, day
dreamed about nothing, or snoozed over the
chirpy tones of their Pokemon videogames.
Inhabiting a space devoid of overt problems
relaxes me like nothing else. In one of my
newly-discovered rooms, I have even gained
the status of the room's "fat cat," because all
I do is sip their beer, slump around, and take
long naps.
Last week, however, I had an unfortunate
crisis of unexpected proportions. Perhaps it
was part of the process simply adjusting back
to campus life, or perhaps it was trying to
confront the fact that my undergraduate ca
reer was about to come to an end. Whatever
it was, one of my friends came to visit me,
yelling, "Tohhhhh!" only to discover me hid

ing under my blanket, freaking out and being
paralyzed by my own freaking out.
In the minutes that ensued, our conversa
tion amounted to me apologizing profusely
for my emotional state, I was extremely
adamant that I never freaked out, that I was
usually a strong, stoic and a calm buffoon,
and that little troubled me I had learned
not to care. As I emitted low, monsterly
sounds of woe, my dear friend sat by me and
patted my hand, finally saying, "You're not
freaking out. You're just upset."
The use of the word "just" surprised me.
To "just" be upset meant to only be upset, to
merely be upset. There was, with the use of
"just," a connotation of normalcy: my fla

grant and unwanted display of emotion was
not anything to be ashamed of.
Perhaps, to some of you, it seems strange
I would associate displays of upset emotion
with weakness. I emphasize constantly the
dangers of inhibition, and I appreciate hon
est presentation of self whenever I get to
know people. It gets even more confusing
considering how I find nothing wrong with
displays of emotion in general. I enjoy dis
playing affection toward my friends, and it is
extremely evident when I am happy. Baked
goods fill the house, I become annoyingly
talkative, and I dish out hugs like Mother
Theresa does love.
But I never wanted to be associated with
the complex emotional state of being at once
troubled, disappointed and angry, a state
summarized almost euphemistically as dra
matic. To some extent, the yearning to be
stoic influenced the general way I presented
myself. I was careful not to be a girly girl, the
image so prone to hysteria over a smudged
lipstick or chipped nail. I also became a little
rougher around the edges, and stopped car
ing too much about small things.
This entire incident, however, provoked
much re-evaluation on my part, where my
behavior and assumptions no longer seemed
right. Gendering states of being, words and
emotions, for example, felt too narrow
minded. Just like how I don't think men
should be wild sex fiends and girls timid
prudes, I don't think men should be confined
to states of emotional frigidity and women to
hysteria.
As important was my re-evaluation of
distress, and the fact that it was okay to be
distressed. I should not have been avoiding
"drama" wholesale, if drama meant being
upset or anxious. What I should have avoided
was being upset or anxious about petty
things. If I'm stood up once by a friend, that is
not reason to flip out on them, cry, or throw
myself into a pit of fiery torment. If I'm stood
up ten times by a friend in a span of four
weeks, perhaps that is a reason to get upset,
but only to the extent that my distress creates
a practical reassessment of the issue itself -
the nature of the friendship, or the priorities
in my life.
So the next time you feel weepy or sad or
plain pissed off, escapism may not be the an
swer. You are not being weak or silly. The
question to ask is, rather, why you are upset,
and if the reason is bigger than a chipped nail,
perhaps you have a right to it.
