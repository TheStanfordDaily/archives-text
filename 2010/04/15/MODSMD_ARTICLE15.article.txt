# LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
## 
### 
I would like to take this opportunity to re
spond to Adam Adler's letter to the editor
appearing in Tuesday's Daily.
In addition to formally apologizing to
GAIA over a week ago and acknowledging
the situation on the Stanford Review blog, I
would like to again sincerely apologize that I
was unable to follow the guidelines laid forth
by GAIA, and tried to wrongfully circum
vent GAIA's endorsement requirements. I
wholeheartedly regret the course of action
that I chose.
I'm thankful that I was able to, as Adam
put it, "step forward and acknowledge" my
non-compliance with GAIA's policies before
the election and before GAIA had publicly
announced its endorsees.
I do agree that more attention should be
paid to the elected leaders of the ASSU I
ran a campaign that supported transparency
and sustainability, and I intend to fulfill these
and my other campaign pledges.
Be assured that I will do everything in my
power to ensure that the 12th Undergradu
ate Senate upholds the highest standards of
accountability.
Before the election, I reached out to sus
tainability leaders to assure them that I in
tend to work with them closely as a Senator;
I look forward to contributing significantly to
the next elections cycle on how to best create
and enforce elections policies.

Statements have been published in The
Stanford Daily questioning my campaign ac
tivities. I write to restate my apology for mis
leading the Stanford community to think I
did not use virgin materials. As I said in my
statement to GAIA on Monday, April sth, I
take responsibility for my actions and apolo
gize for not upholding the GAIA sustainable
campaign standards. Having recognized my

mistake, I came forward and withdrew the
acceptance of my GAIA endorsement on
April sth. I regret my actions and hope that
this matter can be laid to rest. I did campaign
on ethics reform, and if this experience has
taught me anything, I know I will demon
strate and fight for a high level of integrity
and honesty throughout my tenure as an
ASSU senator.
