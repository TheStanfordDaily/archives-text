## LOOKING TO REPEAT Gymnasts try to defend 2009 national title 
### JESSICA YU CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Today, defending NCAA champi
on Stanford men's gymnastics at
tempts to defend its national title at
the 2010 NCAA Championships at
the United States Military Academy
in West Point, N. Y.The No. 4 Cardinal
takes on No. 1 Illinois, No. 2 Okla
homa and No. 3 Michigan, along with
Ohio State, California, Minnesota,
Penn State, Illinois-Chicago, Nebras
ka, lowa and Temple in a competition
that will last until Saturday.
Though the Cardinal went unde
feated against all collegiate teams in
its regular season, it faltered at the
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation
(MPSF) Championships just two
weeks ago. Entering the competition
as the No. 1 ranked team in the na
tion, Stanford simply could not live
up to the hype and found itself
plagued by mistakes, big and small.
Oklahoma took the MPSF title in
front of a home crowd in Norman,
Okla., while Cal placed second and
Stanford third. It was the first time all
season Stanford had lost to either
team.
The loss was both stunning and
humbling to the Stanford men, who
have since prepared themselves
emotionally, mentally and physically
for this week's competition.
"We just got too comfortable,"
said redshirt senior and co-captain
Greg Ter-Zakhariants after MPSFs.
"We're now going to have to go back

to the gym and get ourselves togeth
er."
"[This time] is crucial for us to re
fine our routines and get mentally
ready for championships," added
junior co-captain Abhinav Ramani.
Stanford will begin to showcase
its regrouping during tonight's first
team qualifying session. In order to
move on to the team final on Friday
evening, Stanford must finish in the
top three of six teams in its group.
Stanford gymnasts to watch in
clude junior and co-captain Tim
Gentry, freshmen James Fosco and
Eddie Penev and juniors Alex
Buscaglia, Josh Dixon and Ryan
Lieberman.
Gentry is the team's most valu
able gymnast of 2010 and is current
ly ranked No. 1 on vault with an aver
age score of 16.12. He is also ranked
No. 2 on still rings.
Fosco is also a top-10 athlete on
rings, ranking fifth in the nation in his
first collegiate season. If he can
bounce back from a torn bicep sus
tained during MPSFs, he could help
lead Stanford to its second consecu
tive title and contend for an indi
vidual title on the event.
Penev ranks second in the nation
on floor exercise with an average
score of 15.525. Dixon and Buscaglia
join him in the top 10 with rankings
of ninth and 10th, respectively.
Lieberman ranks seventh on high
bar with an average score of 14.64.

Stanford also boasts a trio of ath
letes ranked top-20 in the nation on

parallel bars: Buscaglia and sopho-
mores John Martin and Cameron
Foreman.
However, to rebound from its
MPSF loss, Stanford must put in
extra effort to hit its pommel horse

routines. Stanford does not have any
athletes in the top 10 —or top 20
on this event, but does have athletes
that are capable of completing clean
routines.
Stanford arrived at West Point

late Monday evening and has had
two full days to familiarize itself
with the arena and equipment, per
fect routines and observe other
competitors before competition
starts today.
According to head coach Thorn
Glielmi, Stanford is looking good as
NCAAs commence.
"To get to this point has been a
complete team effort with all of the
guys stepping up," he said.
