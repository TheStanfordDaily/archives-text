# BACK ON THE WINNING TRAIL
## 
### DANIEL BOHM SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford Cardinal baseball team
may be down, but it is showing that it isn't
out quite yet.
The Cardinal won its second consecutive
game Tuesday, a 14-0 drubbing of host Santa
Clara, to improve to 15-13 on the season.
Five Stanford pitchers combined to two
hit the Broncos. It was the second game in a
row that Stanford pitching, which was spotty
earlier in the season, has looked stellar.
Freshman left fielder Stephen Piscotty
and junior first baseman Jonathan Kaskow
led a Cardinal offense that pounded out 18

hits with three each. Piscotty scored four
runs and knocked in two while Kaskow
scored three and knocked in three. The pair
hit back-to-back homers in the top of the
seventh to put the Cardinal up 12-0. The
home run was the first of Piscotty's colle
giate career and Kaskow's was his first of
2010.
Junior second baseman Colin Walsh and
freshman third baseman Kenny Diekroeger
also had three hits apiece in the win, while
Stanford also capitalized on four Bronco er
rors leading to four Cardinal unearned runs.
Sophomore Brian Busick (3-1) went the
first two innings for the win. He was fol
lowed by three impressive shutout innings

from freshman Mark Appel.
The Cardinal will look to ride its new
found momentum up to Corvallis, Ore. this
weekend for a three game conference series
with No. 14 Oregon State.
The Beavers enter the weekend 20-8 on
the season and in a three-way tie for third in
the Pacific-10 Conference at 3-3.
Although Oregon State is highly ranked
and a perennial contender, it has struggled
against tougher opponents this season, los
ing two of three last weekend to No. 1
UCLA and two of three to Long Beach
State back in March.
The Beavers are a pitching-oriented
team, owning a team earned run average of
just 2.97. Their staff is lead by junior Greg
Peavey, who is 3-0 with a 1.91 ERA in seven
starts this season, and junior Tanner Robles,
who is 4-3 with a 2.25 ERA this season.
While Oregon State has a bevy of arms, it
struggles to consistently score runs. The
team's batting average is just .264 on the
year. The team's best hitter is probably jun
ior infielder Stefan Romero, who is batting
.311 with a team-leading seven home runs
this year.
If Stanford is going to win a tough road
series, it is going to come down to its ability
to score runs against the robust Beaver staff.
The Cardinal is in dire need of a series victo
ry over a conference opponent as it is cur
rently in a three-way tie for seventh in the
conference at 4-5.
That offense has become increasingly de
pendent on a group of very talented fresh
men: outfielders Tyler Gaffney and Jake
Stewart as well as Piscotty and Diekroeger.
Gaffney has assumed the role of leadoff
hitter thanks to his speed and grittiness. The
two-sport star is hitting .288 and has showed
continued improvement this season.
While Stewart has struggled a bit at the
plate, he has provided the Cardinal with
great defense in center field.
Piscotty and Diekroeger are two of the
team's leading hitters, batting .352 and .313,
respectively. Piscotty also leads the team
with 21 RBIs and 27 runs scored.
All will need to step up behind a weekend
rotation that has had an up-and-down sea
son. Sophomore Jordan Pries has been the
team's most consistent pitcher. Pries is 3-1

GAME NOTES : Stanford finally found some offense in its
last game against Santa Clara. The Cardinal, which
had scored 16 runs in its past five games combined,
pummeled the Broncos for 14 runs in a blowout victo
ry. Stanford must now travel to Corvallis for a three
game series against Pac-10 foe Oregon State.

Juniorsecond baseman Colin Walsh did his part to bring Stanford's offense back to form with three
of the Cardinal's 18 hits in a 14-0 rout of Santa Clara. Stanford will take on OSU this weekend.

with a 3.06 ERA on the year as Stan
ford's Saturday starter.
Sophomore Brett Mooneyham is
likely to start Sunday, and head
coach Mark Marquess has to be
thrilled with what he has seen from
his ultra-talented, yet ultra-erratic
lefty of late. Although he is 1-4 with
a 6.09 ERA on the year, Mooney
ham, who has struggled with his con
trol all season, has looked a lot better

in his last few outings. Last Saturday
against Oregon, he went eight in
nings and gave up just one run on
five hits and five walks.
It is unclear who will start on Fri
day for the Cardinal, but it is likely to
be Busick, who has also had a good
early season at 3-1 with a 3.16 ERA.
After the trip to Oregon State,
Stanford returns home for a four
game homestand beginning with
Santa Clara on Tuesday before host
ing California next for a three-game
series next weekend.
