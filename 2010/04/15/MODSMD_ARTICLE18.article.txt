## Card tries to clinch title in final matches 
### WILL SEATON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A successful season will depend on the last
weekend for the No. 10 Stanford women's tennis
team (17-1, 6-0 Pac-10), as it hosts Santa Clara
(13-5,3-2 WCC) and then rival No. 12 California
(17-4,5-1 Pac-10) in the final dual matches of the
regular season.
With four teams all within one loss of each
other, this weekend will prove to be decisive in
determining who will gain the Pac-10 title. The
Cardinal is in good position to gain a share of the
title, as it is undefeated in conference play this
season. Stanford's one loss came against UCLA
in a pre-conference match back on Feb. 26. The
three other teams still in contention are Califor
nia, UCLA and USC, all at 5-1 in conference play.
So wherever the cards fall, the race to be Pac-10
champion is as close as ever.
Another important part of the Pac-10 race is
the unfinished Stanford-USC match, suspended
because of rain, which will need to have the dou
bles point played now.
Fortunately, the women have history on their
side. They have not lost a home match at Taube
Family Tennis Stadium since Feb. 27,1999. Since
then, they have won 159 consecutive matches on
their home courts. The Golden Bears were the
last team to upset them, 5-4, but even then, Cal
has not won even a share of the conference title
since 1987.
First up, though, is Santa Clara. The Broncos
recently dropped a tough decision to No. 58 Cal
Poly 6-1. Stanford is their first Pac-10 opponent
of the season. In doubles, they have a great fresh
men duo of Maggie McGeorge and Kelly Lam
ble, who were responsible for their one doubles
victory against Cal Poly. Sophomore captain
Kacie Wagner was responsible for the lone sin
gles victory. The team is very young, with only one
junior, no seniors and more than half the team
freshmen.
"I honestly don't even know if we've played
them in the last four years," said senior Lindsay
Burdette. "We're not really sure what to expect,
so we're just going to go out there and do what we
do best."
Cal will pose more of a problem for Stanford.
With three ranked singles players, including No.
2-ranked sophomore Jana Juricova, the team has
quality individuals. Juricova has won three Pac
-10 Player of the Week awards. On top of that, Ju
ricova combines with Mari Andersson to make
up the No. 7 doubles team and the defending
NCAA doubles champions. The matchup be
tween them and Stanford's No. 2-ranked team of
Hilary Barte and Lindsay Burdette may be key to
deciding the day.

"The biggest challenge for us going into Cal is
making sure our own nerves don't get in the way
of our play," Lindsay Burdette said. "We've
proven that we have all the ability to take care of
them on our home court. We just
have to stay focused."
On top of that, Burdette's little
sister Mallory will be a big contribu
tor to the team. Mallory leads the
team with a record of 28-4 and a 16-
2 record in duals. Despite her out
standing freshman season, she refus
es to become overconfident.
"It can get in your head," Mallory
Burdette said. "Like, 'Oh, I've won
this many matches. I need to contin
ue to win.' I refuse to let that happen
though. I try to build confidence
from [my wins], but not become
cocky."
Other players to follow will be
sophomore Veronica Li (15-3 dual
record) and No. 120 Carolyn
McVeigh (13-4 dual record). The two
of them have anchored the five and
six spots this season and been a
major reason behind Stanford's suc
cess at the bottom of the lineup. Fi
nally, No. 69 freshman Stacey Tan is
one win away from a 25-win season
and is close behind Barte and Mallo
ry Burdette. Switching between the
three and four position, she has
found a large degree of success at the
four spot. There, she has a 9-1 record
compared to a 4-4 record at No. 3.
"We're all doing pretty well," Tan
said. "We're playing well with one
another and the energy we have,
bringing it out to different matches
home or away, has increased over
time. That's really good because I
think pretty much everyone likes
the support and the energy we show.
Should Stanford win Saturday

against Cal, all doubts from last sea
son will have been answered and the
team will be in a great place going
into the Pac-10 Tournament to con
tend for another title. Stanford hosts

Santa Clara Thursday at 1:30 p.m.
and California Saturday at 12 p.m.
