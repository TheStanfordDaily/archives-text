## Card tries to clinch title in final matches 
### WILL SEATON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A successful season will depend on the last
weekend for the No. 10 Stanford women's tennis
team (17-1, 6-0 Pac-10), as it hosts Santa Clara
(13-5,3-2 WCC) and then rival No. 12 California
(17-4,5-1 Pac-10) in the final dual matches of the
regular season.
With four teams all within one loss of each
other, this weekend will prove to be decisive in
determining who will gain the Pac-10 title. The
Cardinal is in good position to gain a share of the
title, as it is undefeated in conference play this
season. Stanford's one loss came against UCLA
in a pre-conference match back on Feb. 26. The
three other teams still in contention are Califor
nia, UCLA and USC, all at 5-1 in conference play.
So wherever the cards fall, the race to be Pac-10
champion is as close as ever.
Another important part of the Pac-10 race is
the unfinished Stanford-USC match, suspended
because of rain, which will need to have the dou
bles point played now.
Fortunately, the women have history on their
side. They have not lost a home match at Taube
Family Tennis Stadium since Feb. 27,1999. Since
then, they have won 159 consecutive matches on
their home courts. The Golden Bears were the
last team to upset them, 5-4, but even then, Cal
has not won even a share of the conference title
since 1987.
First up, though, is Santa Clara. The Broncos
recently dropped a tough decision to No. 58 Cal
Poly 6-1. Stanford is their first Pac-10 opponent
of the season. In doubles, they have a great fresh
men duo of Maggie McGeorge and Kelly Lam
ble, who were responsible for their one doubles
victory against Cal Poly. Sophomore captain
Kacie Wagner was responsible for the lone sin
gles victory. The team is very young, with only one
junior, no seniors and more than half the team
freshmen.
"I honestly don't even know if we've played
them in the last four years," said senior Lindsay
Burdette. "We're not really sure what to expect,
so we're just going to go out there and do what we
do best."
Cal will pose more of a problem for Stanford.
With three ranked singles players, including No.
2-ranked sophomore Jana Juricova, the team has
quality individuals. Juricova has won three Pac
-10 Player of the Week awards. On top of that, Ju
ricova combines with Mari Andersson to make
up the No. 7 doubles team and the defending
NCAA doubles champions. The matchup be
tween them and Stanford's No. 2-ranked team of
Hilary Barte and Lindsay Burdette may be key to
deciding the day.

"The biggest challenge for us going into Cal is
making sure our own nerves don't get in the way
of our play," Lindsay Burdette said. "We've
proven that we have all the ability to take care of
