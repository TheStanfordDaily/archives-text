# Hold coaches to the same standard
## 
### Zach Zimmerman Dishing the Rock 
The Chicago Bulls have had a
very interesting season. With
lofty expectations heading
into this year after taking the
Boston Celtics seven games
in the first round of last year's playoffs,
the Bulls really struggled. Hampered by
injuries and coaching decisions rivaling
Dennis Rodman's life decisions, Chica
go looked destined for the golf courses
in June, However, the Bulls just clinched
the eighth and final playoff spot in the
East with last night's win over the Bob
cats and things are finally looking up.
The Bulls gave Leßron all he could han
dle during the regular season, and this is
a team battle-tested in a seven-game se
ries. The team is riding a wave of mo
mentum, and nothing can go wro
Wait, what? The GM and the head
coach just got in a shoving match?
Like true grown men running a sev
eral 100 million dollar organization,
Bulls executive vice president (and for
mer general manager) John Paxson and
head coach Vinny Del Negro decided to
(allegedly) resolve their differences by
physically fighting. Forget the days of
front office meetings to settle problems.
This issue at hand was huge, one that
could no longer be ignored by any
means. This problem, if not settled with
shoves, would be the downfall of the en
tire organiza—
Wait, say that again? Paxson was just
pissed about Joakim Noah's playing
time? Joakim Noah?!?
It's almost laughable how routine
these stories are becoming. It seems like
every week we're dealt another "report"
regarding an altercation between a man
ager and a coach, a coach and a coach, a
coach and a player and Jerry Jones
against the world. I am the first one to
concede that having that competitive fire
is a necessity to succeed in sports at every
level. Although this tenacity is most es
sential on the court or field, every fan
deeply desires passionate and fiery per
sonalities leading their team, a la Mark
Cuban.
But the idea that these altercations
can extend past the line of vocal displeas
ure is dumbfounding. Front office mem
bers and coaches are often ex-players
Paxson and Del Negro are both former
point guards and continue to have
trouble accepting that their careers as
athletes are over. Their actions are often
justified by the fact that they' 'still haven't
lost that fire" and that "winning means
everything, no matter the cost!"
Paxson and Del Negro are a com
bined 92 years old.Time to grow up, boys.
The fact is that these guys are no
longer players. They are overpaid busi
ness partners with a common goal
leading a team of professional basket
ball players to a NBA Championship.
By no means am I discounting the work
that they do. Although most of us think
that we would be willing to give any
thing to switch shoes with them, their
lives are incredibly stressful. But they
have both been given the opportunity to
remain around the game that they love
in significant positions of power. This
type of behavior should be absolutely
intolerable.
Player behavior is now strictly moni
tored by leagues like the NBA and the
NFL, so why shouldn't the big dogs be
held to the same standards? Celtics for
ward/center Rasheed Wallace has paid
enough fines to cover over a decade of
Stanford education, while Patriots wide
receiver Randy Moss was heavily scold
ed for his admittance of occasional mar
ijuana use. I'm not condoning these ac
tions by any means and I agree with the
professional leagues when they punish
these players on the basis of setting a bad
example for kids
Coaches and managers are also pun
ished, but far less frequently. Oakland
Raiders coach Tom Cable currently
boasting a 9-19 career record alleged
ly fractured the jaw of assistant coach
Randy Hanson. No charges were filed,
but witnesses saw the whole thing. Add
in the fact that two ex-wives and an ex
girlfriend accused Cable of physical
abuse, and it becomes increasingly more
difficult to give the guy the benefit of the
doubt.
So whom would you rather have
your kid leam from: an athlete that
smokes a little grass, or a coach that
punches everything in sight? For me, it's
really not close.
I want Paxson, Del Negro and Cable
to all be passionate about their jobs.
Sports are so much more entertaining
when it appears as if the coaches and

management actually give a shit. Being
"fiery" is one thing. Acting like a punch
throwing maniac is another.
Men, let's all take a deep breath, and
put the fists down. Do it for the kids.
