## Dvorkovich talks Russian economics President's chief advisor stresses need for "economic modernization" 
### PHILIPPE DE KONING 
Arkady Dvorkovich, the chief economic ad
visor to Russian President Dmitry Medvedev,
spoke Wednesday at Arrillaga Alumni Center
about the need for economic modernization in
the Russian Federation in the post-Cold War
era.
Until the global financial crisis hit, "we were
sleeping too much on our natural resources, oil
and gas, without thinking too much about the
future," Dvorkovich said.
"Russia has potential to grow," he said, "and
the crisis came at the right time to the right
place. The gap between Russia and the rest of
the world will increase if we do not succeed right
now."
The address served as the keynote speech for
the first annual conference of the Stanford U.S.-
Russia Forum (SURF), an event aimed at im
proving U.S.-Russia relations by focusing on
youth.
"SURF is an initiative to bring together stu
dents from across the U.S. and Russia to explore
the most pressing global challenges facing our
respective countries," said co-founder Sam
Stone'lo.
Dvorkovich, who got a master's degree at
Duke University, now designs policies intended
to instigate innovation and modernization in
the Russian economy. Fie said the government
has been successful in fostering a new mood in
Russia that is conducive to innovation.
"What we are trying to do now is to gather as
many partners as possible in our endeavors," he
added.
He highlighted efforts at creating innovation
in the energy sector as a crucial aspect of his
work. Oil and gas companies, including
Gazprom, and steel-making corporations serve
as some of the hotspots for collaboration in
these endeavors.
"Russia is not the Soviet Union,"
Dvorkovich proclaimed in an effort to debunk
claims that Russia is reverting to authoritarian
leadership.
"The president is focusing on feedback con
sistently coming from the people. He has his
own blog and looks for feedback on the Internet
everyday," he said.
Though he did not dwell on the criticisms
against the Russian government, he did high
light his belief that Russia is staying away from
an authoritarian leadership.
"We are not going to create a closed society,"
he said. "My hope is that any Russian can go
abroad if he wants to go abroad."

Russian economic advisor Arkady Dvorkovich
said in his talk Wednesday night on economic
modernization that "we are not going to create
a closed society...my hope is that any Russian
can go abroad if he wants to go abroad."
Discussing the corruption that
often plagues public works funding,
he said former President Vladimir
Putin's early efforts at minimizing
the role of bureaucracy to combat
corruption largely failed, and hopes
that this new set of priorities will
serve to further eradicate corrup
tion.
"I was impressed with how can
did he was with respect to the prob
lems Russia is facing, particularly
corruption," said Mikael Bernstein
'l2, who works as a deputy director
for SURF.
"I expected him to be much more
diplomatic and appreciated his hon
esty," added co-founder Anda Gan
sca 'll. "He also came off as pretty
optimistic with respect to Russia's
future."
Dvorkovich said the increase in
educational exchanges between the
United States and Russia serves as a
crucial factor in improving the two
countries' relationship. He is work
ing with Stanford and M.I.T. to or
ganize educational exchanges for
post-doctoral students to further
cultural dialogue.
"The future depends on young
people, which is why education and
this SURF project in particular is
crucial," he said.
