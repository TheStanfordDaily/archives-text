# Vice provost, a prolific fundraiser, reflects on 35 years at Stanford
## Bravman explains Farm exit 
### ERIC MESSINGER SENIOR MANAGING EDITOR 
When the announcement came Monday
that Vice Provost for Undergraduate Edu
cation John Bravman '79 M.S. 'Bl Ph.D. 'B5
would leave Stanford to become the presi
dent of Bucknell University, it was the same
day he brought home his newborn son,
Cole, from the hospital.
For Bravman, a Farm mainstay for 35
years, the chaotic day was only the most re
cent convergence of family life and Stan
ford. He completed his undergraduate edu
cation at the University, stayed on for grad
uate study and moved to being a professor
in the last years pursuing his doctorate.
Married to another materials science pro
fessor, Wendy Wright, residing on campus
and spending "99 percent" of his time here,
Bravman said he often thought he would re
main here forever.
"I never expected to leave Stanford,"
said Bravman, 52. "I expected to spend my
entire adult life here and retire."
Speaking to The Daily after the unex
pected announcement, Bravman laid out
the reasons for his departure, the principal
values and lessons he gained from his time
here and his priorities for his few months
left on campus.
In order to leave for another institution,
Bravman said, he had to avoid direct com
petition with Stanford by avoiding the mi
lieu of top-tier research universities.
"It had to be something in my mind that
was a special opportunity but also had to be
a different place from Stanford," Bravman
said.
The challenge of finding the Stanford
spirit he believed in at an institution operat
ing in a different sphere, Bravman said, nar
rowed the possibilities considerably.
"You put all those things together, that's
actually a small constellation of opportuni
ties," he said.
Bravman said he initially turned down
the offer from Bucknell, finding himself
content at Stanford. He was persuaded,
however, to attend dinner in San Francisco
for 30 minutes with the chairman of Buck
nell's board.
"The rest, as they say, is history, but we
really hit it off," Bravman said. "I really
found it a very compelling two-hour con
versation instead of a 30-minute conversa
tion, and I immediately resonated with him,

and that opened my eyes and my willing
ness to explore a bit more."
"And I start meeting people, and I find
this is a school in a small town in rural Penn
sylvania, and people were just tremendous,"
he continued. "And the students, the staff,
the faculty, they really believe in the school,
the alumni, the parents ... like Stanford, it's
a beloved institution by its people. And that
spoke volumes to me. It wasn't just a place
to go to school."
What he saw proved too much to resist:
on July 1, Bravman will become Bucknell's
president. He said he expects to move to

Pennsylvania with his family a week before
hand.
Before he departs, most of Bravman's
top priorities will be filling key administra
tive posts in the Office of the Vice Provost
for Undergraduate Education. In addition
to the appointment of English professor
Nicholas Jenkins as the new director of the
Program in Writing and Rhetoric (PWR),
Bravman will be finalizing the search for a
new director for the Bing Overseas Studies
Program (BOSP) to succeed history profes
sor Norman Naimark.
The priority closest to Bravman's heart,

however, may be the Freshman-Sophomore
College (FroSoCo), where he has served as
its first and only dean.
"We have to find a great successor in
FroSoCo," Bravman said. "I think of FroSo-
Co as very much my program. I started it, I
was the only dean. And so I want someone,
and we will find someone, who has the same
kind of passion for undergraduate educa
tion, and wants to do some of the things that
I have done and also invent his or her
own things in the dorm there,"

Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education John Bravman made two announcements on Monday: the birth of his son, Cole, and his
decision to leave Stanford to head Bucknell University in Pennsylvania next year. His term as the school's president begins July 1. "It had to
be something in my mind that was a special opportunity but also had to be a different place from Stanford," Bravman said on Wednesday.
Bravman added that he felt heart
ened learning that 50 percent of
freshmen in the program will return
for their sophomore year, even after
his departure.
"The announcement came out
before they had to sign up to stay
I would have felt bad if it was the
other way," Bravman said. "They had
the option, and they elected to stay.
So I think, and this is very important,
we've tried to create a community
that's above any of the senior staff."
The new director of FroSoCo will
also be a different person than who
ever succeeds him as vice provost,
ending the arrangement that had
him filling both posts since 1999.
Bravman, who has also been vice
provost for eleven years, said he was
proud of what had been accom
plished during his time, citing facul
ty-student engagement in programs
such as Sophomore College, the arts
intensive and overseas studies.
Fie added that he is optimistic
about the future of VPUE in upcom
ing years after a difficult time for the
University budget.

"We weathered last year's finan
cial storm," he said. "We got through
that, it was very difficult, but the
whole University took the hard path
and got it done. So we're looking at
modest growth when our peers are
still looking at shrinking budgets."
This commitment to moving for
ward and seeking improvements,
which he called "one of the hall
marks of Stanford University," was
one Bravman said he recognized in

Bucknell.
"We can pat ourselves on the
back occasionally, but we don't do
that very often," he said. "We're al
ways talking about, how are we
going to be better? How are we
going to do more? We do it in
physics, we do it in football, we do it
everywhere in between. The same
thing is true at Bucknell."
Bravman closed by reasserting
the admiration he had for Stanford,
and the shared values he hoped to
find across the country.
"I'm not leaving Stanford," he
said. "I'm changing careers to a great
new institution but Wendy and I love
Stanford, more than you can possi
bly imagine."
"One of the things that attracted
me also about Bucknell they
weren't looking for someone who
was not happy at their institution,"
he added. "They love the fact that I
love Stanford. Tliey love that. And of
course they're hoping that I develop
that loyalty to Bucknell. It was very
attractive to me that they weren't
looking for someone who was dissat
isfied. They were looking for some
one who was very hard to move. And
that was me."

the alumni, the parents ... like Stanford, it's
a beloved institution by its people. And that
spoke volumes to me. It wasn't just a place
to go to school."
What he saw proved too much to resist:
on July 1, Bravman will become Bucknell's
president. He said he expects to move to

Pennsylvania with his family a week before
hand.
Before he departs, most of Bravman's
top priorities will be filling key administra
tive posts in the Office of the Vice Provost
for Undergraduate Education. In addition
to the appointment of English professor
Nicholas Jenkins as the new director of the
Program in Writing and Rhetoric (PWR),
Bravman will be finalizing the search for a
new director for the Bing Overseas Studies
Program (BOSP) to succeed history profes
sor Norman Naimark.
The priority closest to Bravman's heart,

however, may be the Freshman-Sophomore
College (FroSoCo), where he has served as
its first and only dean.
"We have to find a great successor in
FroSoCo," Bravman said. "I think of FroSo-
Co as very much my program. I started it, I
was the only dean. And so I want someone,
and we will find someone, who has the same
kind of passion for undergraduate educa
tion, and wants to do some of the things that
I have done and also invent his or her
own things in the dorm there,"

Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education John Bravman made two announcements on Monday: the birth of his son, Cole, and his
decision to leave Stanford to head Bucknell University in Pennsylvania next year. His term as the school's president begins July 1. "It had to
be something in my mind that was a special opportunity but also had to be a different place from Stanford," Bravman said on Wednesday.
Bravman added that he felt heart
ened learning that 50 percent of
freshmen in the program will return
for their sophomore year, even after
his departure.
"The announcement came out
before they had to sign up to stay
I would have felt bad if it was the
other way," Bravman said. "They had
the option, and they elected to stay.
So I think, and this is very important,
we've tried to create a community
that's above any of the senior staff."
The new director of FroSoCo will
also be a different person than who
ever succeeds him as vice provost,
ending the arrangement that had
him filling both posts since 1999.
Bravman, who has also been vice
provost for eleven years, said he was
proud of what had been accom
plished during his time, citing facul
ty-student engagement in programs
such as Sophomore College, the arts
intensive and overseas studies.
Fie added that he is optimistic
about the future of VPUE in upcom
ing years after a difficult time for the
University budget.

"We weathered last year's finan
cial storm," he said. "We got through
that, it was very difficult, but the
whole University took the hard path
and got it done. So we're looking at
modest growth when our peers are
still looking at shrinking budgets."
This commitment to moving for
ward and seeking improvements,
which he called "one of the hall
marks of Stanford University," was
one Bravman said he recognized in

Bucknell.
"We can pat ourselves on the
back occasionally, but we don't do
that very often," he said. "We're al
ways talking about, how are we
going to be better? How are we
going to do more? We do it in
physics, we do it in football, we do it
everywhere in between. The same
thing is true at Bucknell."
Bravman closed by reasserting
the admiration he had for Stanford,
and the shared values he hoped to
find across the country.
"I'm not leaving Stanford," he
said. "I'm changing careers to a great
new institution but Wendy and I love
Stanford, more than you can possi
bly imagine."
"One of the things that attracted
me also about Bucknell they
weren't looking for someone who
was not happy at their institution,"
he added. "They love the fact that I
love Stanford. Tliey love that. And of
course they're hoping that I develop
that loyalty to Bucknell. It was very
attractive to me that they weren't
looking for someone who was dissat
isfied. They were looking for some
one who was very hard to move. And
that was me."

I expected to spend
my entire adult life
here and retire."

Underg raduate
Education
When the announcement came Monday
that Vice Provost for Undergraduate Edu
cation John Bravman '79 M.S. 'Bl Ph.D. 'B5
would leave Stanford to become the presi
dent of Bucknell University, it was the same
day he brought home his newborn son,
Cole, from the hospital.
For Bravman, a Farm mainstay for 35
years, the chaotic day was only the most re
cent convergence of family life and Stan
ford. He completed his undergraduate edu
cation at the University, stayed on for grad
uate study and moved to being a professor
in the last years pursuing his doctorate.
Married to another materials science pro
fessor, Wendy Wright, residing on campus
and spending "99 percent" of his time here,
Bravman said he often thought he would re
main here forever.
"I never expected to leave Stanford,"
said Bravman, 52. "I expected to spend my
entire adult life here and retire."
Speaking to The Daily after the unex
pected announcement, Bravman laid out
the reasons for his departure, the principal
values and lessons he gained from his time
here and his priorities for his few months
left on campus.
In order to leave for another institution,
Bravman said, he had to avoid direct com
petition with Stanford by avoiding the mi
lieu of top-tier research universities.
"It had to be something in my mind that
was a special opportunity but also had to be
a different place from Stanford," Bravman
said.
The challenge of finding the Stanford
spirit he believed in at an institution operat
ing in a different sphere, Bravman said, nar
rowed the possibilities considerably.
"You put all those things together, that's
actually a small constellation of opportuni
ties," he said.
Bravman said he initially turned down
the offer from Bucknell, finding himself
content at Stanford. He was persuaded,
however, to attend dinner in San Francisco
for 30 minutes with the chairman of Buck
nell's board.
"The rest, as they say, is history, but we
really hit it off," Bravman said. "I really
found it a very compelling two-hour con
versation instead of a 30-minute conversa
tion, and I immediately resonated with him,

and that opened my eyes and my willing
ness to explore a bit more."
"And I start meeting people, and I find
this is a school in a small town in rural Penn
sylvania, and people were just tremendous,"
he continued. "And the students, the staff,
the faculty, they really believe in the school,
the alumni, the parents ... like Stanford, it's
a beloved institution by its people. And that
spoke volumes to me. It wasn't just a place
to go to school."
What he saw proved too much to resist:
