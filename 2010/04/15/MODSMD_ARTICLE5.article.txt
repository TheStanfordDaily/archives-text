## GSC moves on funding, talks Senate Prelim VSO spending caps are announced; Senate spurs worry 
### BRIANNA PANG STAFF WRITER 
Wednesday's Graduate Student
Council meeting was dominated by
number crunching and funding con
cerns as council members debated next
year's budget and the Funding Commit
tee's proposed bylaw updates.
The council also mentioned concerns
about a sophomore senator-elect who is
going abroad next fall, but ultimately
dismissed it as an undergraduate issue.
Robert Hennessy, a graduate student
in electrical engineering, also updated
the council about the news last week
that some undergraduates would be
housed in Rains starting next year. Ac
cording to Hennessy, Buildings 201 and
202 in Rains are now planned for under
graduates; meaning graduate students
would not have to be relocated.
"The Rains situation has been re
solved successfully," he said. "Hous
ing and ResEd are reconsidering the
decision."

Funding Bylaws Change
Major changes to the Funding
Committee bylaws included a
change in the soft cap for Voluntary
Student Organization (VSO) fund
ing, a clarification of the "copies"
section and putting "what [the
Funding Committee] does already
in writing," said Krystal St. Julien, a
second-year graduate student in
biochemistry.
The maximum funding per fiscal
year per VSO would be lowered to
$6,000 from $B,OOO. According to
Funding Committee Deputy Chair
Justin Brown, a fourth-year gradu
ate student in geophysics, since only
two groups requested an amount
more than that this fiscal year, the
change would not make a great dif
ference.
Ryan Peacock, a doctoral student
in chemical engineering, said the
change would only help redistribute
resources.
"We have hundreds of VSOs, and
if everyone started requesting at the
same amount of funding, then we
would be out of money," he said.
Joint graduate-undergraduate
events would be evaluated on a case
by-case basis.
Additionally, marketing expenses
per VSO per quarter would be
capped at $lO. Use of Facebook
events would be encouraged, while
the use of Facebook ads would be
discouraged and not funded by the

Funding Committee.
Fundraisers, conferences, infor
mation sessions and academic semi
nars also would not be funded by the
GSC. Food caps were also lowered
by $2 per attendee at each event.
"We already do that though," St.
Julien said. "It's just a clarification."
Peacock, the GSC financial offi
cer, proposed next year's budget.
Among the changes are the elimina
tion of a paid FLiCKS coordinator
position and Grad Night at FLiCKS,
approved by council members with
an 8-3 vote, with two members ab
staining.
Council members discussed the
auditor position for graduate events,
disagreeing on whether the job
should be done by one or two peo
ple. About $l,OOO dollars has been al
located for this position.
More discussion will follow next
week as council members evaluate
the changes and provide feedback.
Election Review
Elections Commissioner Quinn
Slack 'll provided an election sea
son wrap-up, opening up the floor to
comments on vote results. Council
members brought up Ben Jensen 'l2,
the senator-elect who plans to go
abroad in the fall, and senators-elect
Rebecca Sachs 'l3 and Carolyn Sim

mons 'l3, who drew criticism when
they lost the endorsement of the
Green Alliance for Innovative Ac
tion over fliers.
The council ultimately dismissed
the debate, saying it belonged to the
Senate and Elections Commission to
resolve.
In other election news, though no
candidate ran for the School of Edu
cation representative position. Slack
said one student received three
write-in votes and the former School
of Education representative, Jon
McNaughtan received two write-in
votes.
Slack said he would release the
name of the student who received
three write-in votes after the student
has been notified and if he or she
agrees to accept the responsibility.
"So, we might actually have a full
GSC!" Slack said.
GSC member-elect St. Julien was
confirmed by the council as Fund
ing Committee chair for 2010-11
after working closely within the
committee for the last two quarters.
She is set to be officially confirmed
by the new GSC at a later date, but
will assume all responsibilities im
mediately.
