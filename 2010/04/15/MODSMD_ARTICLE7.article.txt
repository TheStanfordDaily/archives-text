## DRAWN OUT Students work to finish graphic novel 
### JENNY THAI 
Most of the time, Meyer
Library is a serious
place where students
slave away over diffi
cult problem sets and
language exams. But on Monday
nights, it is fun and organized chaos in
classroom 220.

Several large mobile white boards
are scrawled with panels of scenes,
some peacefully scenic, others mor
bidly captivating. Illustrators are
hunched over their papers, filling the
blank panels with life. Tables strewn
with sheets of papers dot the class
room. Thumb-nailers are sketching
away at the whiteboards.
It's a typical scene for ENG
LISHI9OG, known as The Graphic
Novel class, a two-quarter long project
with an ambitious goal to craft a
quality graphic novel with a humani
tarian focus, from scratch.

"We write nonfiction," said English
lecturer Adam Johnson, who co
teaches the class with fellow English
lecturer Tom Kealey. "We go out and
find stories from real people and help
them find a larger audience."
The students in the class handpick
the graphic novel's story. This year's
story is titled Pika-Don, which means
"Flash-Boom" in Japanese, a term the
Japanese used to describe the atomic
bombings. Pika-Don chronicles the
tale of Tsutomu Yamaguchi, a ship
builder who was a survivor of the 1945
atomic bombings in both Hiroshima
and Nagasaki.
The class is divided up into several
teams tasked with portraying different
aspects of the story, from writing, to il
lustrating, to thumb-nailing, to post
production editing.
The writing team is responsible for
composing the script and storytelling
of the graphic novel, which can only be
tackled after extensive research on
Yamaguchi. As the team is discover
ing, that's no small task.
"One of the problems we had was
to put words in someone's mouth
when they've never said them be
fore," said Lucas Loredo 'l2, a mem
ber of the writing team. "We had to
figure out how comfortable we were

with making things up, while remain
ing as faithful as we can to what actu
ally happened."
In addition to the difficulty of fill
ing up the gaps of research, there is
also the struggle to write about events
that are, in some ways, almost beyond
comprehension.
"How do you write about a person
who has just experienced an atomic
bombing?" Loredo continued. "How
can you fathom experiencing Hiroshi
ma and Nagasaki?"
However, one beauty of the class is
that this scaling this daunting obstacle
is a collective endeavor.

"One of the most important parts
of the class is the idea of collabora
tion," Kealey said. "There is collabora
tion between individuals of the teams
as well as between teams."

For many students, the group na
ture of the work is a refreshing change.
And it has its perks.
"Writing is usually something you
do by yourself," said Anna Rosales 'l2,
another member of the writing team.
"So it's interesting to work together to
write."

"We're not writers we're a writ
ing team!" added Sarah Snow 'lO.
The writing team works closely
with the thumb-nailing team, whose
task is to bridge the worlds of text and
pictures by creating storyboards. As
such, thumb-nailers also directly col
laborate with the illustration team.

"We get pure text and have to
translate that into pictures," said
James Lipshaw 'll. "We decide how
much we need to show scenes textual
ly and visually. We also get a lot of the
creative control since the illustrators
embellish on the basic scenes present
ed in the panels."
The illustration team brings the
novel to life through page after page
of meticulous drawings.
"We use the thumbnails as a guide
to draw the pictures," said Tamarind
King 'l2, one of the illustrators."[You]
pencil in things first, then get cri
tiqued, then ink things in, then get cri
tiqued again."
"Hopefully, you won't mess up,"
she added. "If you do mess up ... well,
there's always white-out."
One of the greatest challenges for

the illustration team is to establish sty
listic consistency in the drawings.
"Everyone has a distinctive style,"
said Katie Pyne 'l2. "And it's hard hav
ing to look at something someone else
has already drawn and trying to make
your part look as close as it can so that
it'll look like only one person drew it,"
The final stage of the process is
completed by the post-production
team, which cleans up the lines, layout
and font.

"My job is to make sure the lines
are crisp and clean," said Guillermo
Huerta 'O9. "I try to keep the element
of the hand-drawn feel in the panels."
One exciting addition to this year's
graphic novel is that it will be pro
duced in color, a first for the class.
"Black and white is a good starting
point but this year, we're adding color,"
Huerta said. "We pick a single tone of
color to add depth. With the dimension
of color, you can add a whole lot of
artistic direction to guide the eye with."
With so many component parts
working together on the project, coor
dination and timing are central con
cerns. Each team must be ahead of the
other to ensure peak efficiency; for in
stance, the writing team must be one
chapter ahead of the thumb-nailing
team. This system often demands a
commitment to invest long hours.
"We sometimes stay up really late
to get things done," Pyne said. "We've
had sessions before that ran from 3
p.m. all the way to 11 p.m."
But the workload isn't putting a
damper on students' passion for the
class.They're invested in the project.
"The process has been like raising a
baby," said Susan Chen 'lO. "Every
step takes longer and is more chal
lenging than initially expected. How
ever, with each elongated step, we can
hone our various skills. We become
more and more expert at our work. I
trust that our end product is a testa
ment to our uncompromising passion
and persistence."
"We'll be banging our heads
against the wall stuck on a single line
we do this quite regularly," Loredo
added. "But it's all worth it."

"We sometimes stay up really late
to get things done," Pyne said. "We've

p.m. all the way to 11 p.m."

"The process has been like raising a
baby," said Susan Chen 'lO. "Every
step takes longer and is more chal

ever, with each elongated step, we can
hone our various skills. We become
more and more expert at our work. I

Students in the graphic novel class are divided into four teams —writing,
thumbnailing, illustrating and post-production.
Most of the time, Meyer
Library is a serious
place where students
slave away over diffi
cult problem sets and
language exams. But on Monday
nights, it is fun and organized chaos in
classroom 220.

Several large mobile white boards
are scrawled with panels of scenes,
some peacefully scenic, others mor
bidly captivating. Illustrators are
hunched over their papers, filling the
blank panels with life. Tables strewn
with sheets of papers dot the class
room. Thumb-nailers are sketching
away at the whiteboards.
It's a typical scene for ENG
LISHI9OG, known as The Graphic
Novel class, a two-quarter long project
with an ambitious goal to craft a
quality graphic novel with a humani
tarian focus, from scratch.

"We write nonfiction," said English
lecturer Adam Johnson, who co
teaches the class with fellow English
lecturer Tom Kealey. "We go out and
find stories from real people and help
them find a larger audience."
The students in the class handpick
the graphic novel's story. This year's
story is titled Pika-Don, which means
"Flash-Boom" in Japanese, a term the
Japanese used to describe the atomic
bombings. Pika-Don chronicles the
tale of Tsutomu Yamaguchi, a ship
builder who was a survivor of the 1945
atomic bombings in both Hiroshima
and Nagasaki.
The class is divided up into several
teams tasked with portraying different
aspects of the story, from writing, to il
lustrating, to thumb-nailing, to post
production editing.
The writing team is responsible for
composing the script and storytelling
of the graphic novel, which can only be
tackled after extensive research on
Yamaguchi. As the team is discover
ing, that's no small task.
"One of the problems we had was
to put words in someone's mouth
when they've never said them be
fore," said Lucas Loredo 'l2, a mem
ber of the writing team. "We had to
figure out how comfortable we were

with making things up, while remain
ing as faithful as we can to what actu
ally happened."
In addition to the difficulty of fill
ing up the gaps of research, there is
also the struggle to write about events
that are, in some ways, almost beyond
comprehension.
"How do you write about a person
who has just experienced an atomic
bombing?" Loredo continued. "How
can you fathom experiencing Hiroshi
ma and Nagasaki?"
However, one beauty of the class is
that this scaling this daunting obstacle
is a collective endeavor.

"One of the most important parts
of the class is the idea of collabora
tion," Kealey said. "There is collabora
tion between individuals of the teams
as well as between teams."

For many students, the group na
ture of the work is a refreshing change.
And it has its perks.
"Writing is usually something you
do by yourself," said Anna Rosales 'l2,
another member of the writing team.
"So it's interesting to work together to
write."

"We're not writers we're a writ
ing team!" added Sarah Snow 'lO.
The writing team works closely
with the thumb-nailing team, whose
task is to bridge the worlds of text and
pictures by creating storyboards. As
such, thumb-nailers also directly col
laborate with the illustration team.

"We get pure text and have to
translate that into pictures," said
James Lipshaw 'll. "We decide how
much we need to show scenes textual
ly and visually. We also get a lot of the
creative control since the illustrators
embellish on the basic scenes present
ed in the panels."
The illustration team brings the
novel to life through page after page
of meticulous drawings.
"We use the thumbnails as a guide
to draw the pictures," said Tamarind
King 'l2, one of the illustrators."[You]
pencil in things first, then get cri
tiqued, then ink things in, then get cri
tiqued again."
"Hopefully, you won't mess up,"
she added. "If you do mess up ... well,
there's always white-out."
One of the greatest challenges for

the illustration team is to establish sty
listic consistency in the drawings.
"Everyone has a distinctive style,"
said Katie Pyne 'l2. "And it's hard hav
ing to look at something someone else
has already drawn and trying to make
your part look as close as it can so that
it'll look like only one person drew it,"
The final stage of the process is
completed by the post-production
team, which cleans up the lines, layout
and font.

"My job is to make sure the lines
are crisp and clean," said Guillermo
Huerta 'O9. "I try to keep the element
of the hand-drawn feel in the panels."
One exciting addition to this year's
graphic novel is that it will be pro
duced in color, a first for the class.
"Black and white is a good starting
point but this year, we're adding color,"
Huerta said. "We pick a single tone of
color to add depth. With the dimension
of color, you can add a whole lot of
artistic direction to guide the eye with."
With so many component parts
working together on the project, coor
dination and timing are central con
cerns. Each team must be ahead of the
other to ensure peak efficiency; for in
stance, the writing team must be one
chapter ahead of the thumb-nailing
team. This system often demands a
commitment to invest long hours.
"We sometimes stay up really late
to get things done," Pyne said. "We've
had sessions before that ran from 3
p.m. all the way to 11 p.m."
But the workload isn't putting a
damper on students' passion for the

more and more expert at our work. I

ment to our uncompromising passion
and persistence."
