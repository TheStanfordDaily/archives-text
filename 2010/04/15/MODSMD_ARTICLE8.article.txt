# FOR WHOM THE MELL TOLLZ
## 
### AMY LANCTOT 
There's more wackiness in the Leland
Stanford Junior University March
ing Band (LSJUMB) than just foot
ball field antics and death-defying
Tree wannabes. Each band section
"sexion" in Band spelling has a unique
flair for the dramatic and competes for who can
be the most crazy, the most spirited and, of
course, the loudest within the already rowdy
group.
The "mellz," or mellophone, section takes
that challenge seriously. They find themselves
playing a uniquely niche instrument and so
have created a particularly strong and
quirky group identity.
The mellophone, the marching band's mo
bile equivalent of the French horn, is an instru
ment rarely played in other settings, but propo
nents claim its virtues surpass those of its sym
phonic cousin.
"A French horn has the bell turned down
and is hard to play standing up, and harder to
play in general," said Elaine Ballinger 'l2, this
year's section leader. "The two instruments
also sound very different though they have
similar ranges."
"The French horn has two different keys,
while the mellophone has just one," added
Adam Adler 'l2, another member of the mellz.
"Some of the fingerings are different as well,
and the mellophone is shaped more like a
trumpet."
Despite these strong parallels, many of the
members of the mellz section have little or no
previous experience with the French horn.
Ballinger played cello and piano before Stan
ford, but no brass instruments, and Amanda
Klein 'l3 played the trumpet in high school,
with only a few months of experience with the
French horn.
Adler, however, chose the mellophone
specifically because he had experience playing
the French horn.
"[I chose French horn] because it was pret
ty and because not as many people play it," he
said. Stanford's band allows students to ex
periment musically, welcoming newcomers to
any instruments and all sorts of styles Adler
said LSJUMB had an electric violin and keytar
players at one point. He himself once brought
his French horn on Band Run, having just got
ten out of wind ensemble rehearsal.
But the Band experience is not limited to
just non-traditional instruments far from it.
LSJUMB members sometimes find their sec
tion camaraderie and eccentric traditions the
most fun aspect of playing, only reinforced by
time spent practicing together.
"The entire Band practices together every
Monday night, and each section practices by it
self once a week," Klein said.
Part of the job of each section includes in
strument maintenance. Normally, mellophones
require regular cleaning and shining, but the

LSJUMB's rally instruments purposely are
kept in fairly bad repair.
"We keep them in cases so they don't get
stepped on and that's pretty much it," Ballinger
said. "We have a few nice horns that we play at
important events where we need to sound bet
ter, and we take care of them by playing them
less often and protecting them with our lives.
Usually our goal is to be loud and rock out,
which doesn't require really awesome instru
ments."
Some members of the mellz also have other
responsibilities in Band. Adler is one of the
writers of the Band field shows, which are del
egated to specific writers.
"Mondays, the entire Band gets together
and we brainstorm," he said. "Then the writers
take the result of the brainstorms and make the
shows, making them funny."
Band members also often arrange their own

music or preexisting songs for the Band.
What with practice, brainstorming sessions
and seasonal travel, Band is a big time commit
ment. Yet the admiration the group receives on
the part of Stanford students, who brag of its
wacky adventures with school pride, make it an
integral part of the Stanford experience.
"Personally, I love the Band because they
play good music, and they're obviously musi
cally talented," said Jordan Limoges 'l3. "But
they manage to be musically talented in away
that's very Stanford they're not uptight
about it."
Limoges played the French Horn before
coming to Stanford, but opted not to join the
Band. According to the mellz, she's missing
out.
"I joined to rock out, for fun," Adler said. "I
get to play music, but it's not too serious. If I
want, I can walk away from my section or play

with the trom
bones. I can steal
a trumpet solo."
The mellz
also feel they are
a vital part of
this uniquely
Stanford group.
"The mellz
are the best be
cause they are

really, really loud," Ballinger said. "Our sexion
has really awesome people, and it's a smallish
instrument so you can rock out a lot while play
ing."
"But if you asked anyone in Band they
would say their sexion is awesome," he added.
"Because, basically, Band is awesome."
