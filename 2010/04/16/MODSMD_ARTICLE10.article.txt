## U.S.-Russia relations remain imperfect Scholars discuss identity of post-Cold War Russia 
### ZOE LEAVITT SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Soviet Union no longer exists, but as
both the United States and Russia struggle
with the identity of the former superpower,
the question remains: what is it?
This question proved the driving force
behind the Stanford U.S.-Russia Forum
(SURF) panel on Thursday, when three for
mer policy shapers gathered to discuss the
nature of U.S.-Russia relations before com
munity members, students and 25 competi
tively selected Russian delegates.
Political science professor Stephen Kras
ner, the former director for policy planning
at the U.S. State Department, and Thomas
Fingar Ph.D. '77, the former deputy director
of National Intelligence for Analysis and
chairman of the National Intelligence Coun
cil, discussed the policy challenges that arose
following the collapse of the bipolar Cold
War era and how Russia must overcome cul
tural and political turmoil to face the wide
range of rising powers changing the game of
international relations.
Philip Taubman '7O, a consulting profes
sor in the Center for International Security
and Cooperation, moderated.
Fingar relied on his background in intel
ligence to illustrate the ways in which the
end of the Cold War forced a complete re
vamping of the American intelligence com
munity.

"The Cold War was a terrible time for a
lot of people, but boy, was it predictable,"
Fingar said.
Following the collapse of the Soviet
Union, the U.S. government faced the mon
umental task of confronting a world wider
than the walls of the Kremlin. After the Sep
tember 11 terrorist attacks showed America
that non-state actors could inflict high dam
age on even the world's most powerful
countries, the government realized it need
ed to revamp a structure designed for a tra
ditional enemy that no longer existed.
"For much of the world, for decades, all
[the United States] cared about was, 'Are
they on our side or on the Soviet side? And
if they're on the Soviet side, how do we get
them to our side?" Fingar said.
"We had been protecting our way of life,
and we've now moved down to the need to
protect any American anywhere in the
world from any threat," he said. "The aston
ishing thing to me is that we haven't made
more mistakes than we have."
The three speakers largely agreed that
rough periods in U.S.-Russia relations in the
past two decades have stemmed from Presi
dent Clinton's decision to expand NATO,
despite promises to the contrary. The Soviet
Union's collapse in 1991 provided an oppor
tunity to move forward in cooperation, but
the speakers agreed that the clashing prides
of the two nations made a spirit of equality
impossible.
Krasner, whose studies have focused on
questions of sovereignty, posed another ex
planation for difficulties in dealing with
Russia a theory that, if accepted, would
have large repercussions for American ac

tion.
"It's kind of a petro[leum]-mafia state,"
he said, asserting that Russia's actions can
not be counted on to make sense in tradi
tional terms, but rather are shaped by the
personal economic interests of Prime Minis
ter Putin and his allies.
Asked about the potential for success of
President Obama's recent friendly over
tures toward Russia, Krasner said, "I can't
tell you, because I don't know what the ef
fect of various policies are on Putin's bank
account."
While Russia has had decades to observe
the effect of special interest lobbying on
American policy, the United States has had
far less time to study Russia's post-Soviet
system.
"These views were not as optimistic as I
expected them to be," said Yury Isaev, press
attach? of the Russian consulate, after the
talk. "The real process in Russia that there is
not such a great level of corruption in real
life, and a lot of Western countries also have
this same problem ... the views of Mr. Kras
ner were more pessimistic than others."
Beside corruption, the three speakers
painted a portrait of Russia as a toppled
power unnerved by a new political balance
and flailing in the shadow of China's loom
ing growth. As U.S.-China relations have
grown and Russia's relative power has con
tinued to decline, the panel believed that the
nation had not yet developed a coherent
way of remaining relevant.
"The U.S., which remains a superpower,
has turned more and more of its attention to
China, so Russia is going to develop
an inferiority complex," Taubman
said.
"They want a seat at the table
more to play defense than to pro
mote a positive agenda," Fingar
agreed.
