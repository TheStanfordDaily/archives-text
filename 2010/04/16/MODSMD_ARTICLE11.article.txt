## Professors look over SUES, GERs Students chime in on possible revision of required classes 
### JULIA BROWNELL SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Faculty Senate convened yesterday to dis
cuss revising general education requirements for
Stanford undergraduates.
The conversation followed a brief presenta
tion on the progress of the new Study of Under
graduate Education at Stanford (SUES). SUES is
a University initiative that last quarter began the
process of examining the undergraduate academ
ic experience for the first time since 1994.
Co-chairs James Campbell, a history profes
sor, and Harry Elam, a drama professor, spoke
about what they had learned so far about general
education requirements (GERs) and asked for
faculty feedback.
"This is not really a report yet, because we're
not at that stage," Elam said. "This is a time for
you to give us some of your opinions on these is
sues."
They first summed up the current General Ed
ucation Requirements (GERs) at Stanford, in
cluding Introduction to the Humanities (IHUM),
the Program in Writing and Rhetoric (PWR) and
breadth and citizenship requirements.
"If one would have to take them all, it consists
of 15 courses, or about one third of the courses
needed to obtain a Stanford degree," Campbell
said. "It is indeed a lot."

Campbell and Elam reported that so far the
committee has been talking to students about
their views on the current GERs. In addition,
Campbell and Elam have met with administra
tors from other schools, including Harvard, to
talk about their successes and failures in general
education.
Campbell reported that other schools warned
that the most important aspect of GERs is to be
able to articulate well why they are necessary to a
Stanford education.
"What we want to find is a rationale that
speaks specifically to Stanford ... the Stanford
today, and where students will be and where Stan
ford is in terms of the culture and the spirit of the
institution, pushing it forward into the next mil
lennium," Elam said. "The question is, why do we
want students to take that course?"
SUES has already begun the process of engag
ing with students through focus groups. Every
Wednesday night, they have dinner in one of the
dorms and talk to approximately twenty students
about their experiences with GERs.
"They felt that the freshman year was incredi
bly packed," Elam said of the dinner meetings.
"And in that sense of packing it didn't allow for
the experimentation and exploration that we've
said is essential in the first two years at Stanford."
"They felt that general education require
ments were often an afterthought," he added.
The two went on to talk about two different
models of general education generally employed:
the core classes approach, which is focused on
freshman and sophomore years, and the distrib
uted requirements approach, which is spread
across the four years of the undergraduate career.
"We have a hybrid model," Elam explained.
"Are we happy with that hybrid model? Is that
what we want?"
After the presentation, the floor opened to
faculty members to offer comments and ask ques
tions.
Kenneth Taylor, a philosophy professor, of
fered the opinion that IHUM hurts humanities at
Stanford rather than helps.
"I think because we require them to take this
massive and obtrusive IHUM, we turn students .
. . off to the humanities," he said.
Virginia Walbot, a biology professor, referred
to an old Stanford program called Science, Math
and Engineering (SME). SME, an experiment by
Stanford in the mid-19905, was an interdiscipli
nary program in the sciences meant to increase
science literacy among non-science majors. The
one-year program fulfilled the math, science and

engineering GERs.
However, the program was ter
minated after many students dis
covered easier, less time-intensive
classes to fulfill the requirement.
"I think this was a really robust
experience for the rather small
group of students," said Walbot,
who taught a SME class. "I think
some attention should be paid to
pulling together the sciences with
some of the other disciplines."
Jeffrey Koseff, a civil and envi
ronmental engineering professor,
offered an engineering perspective
on the general education require
ments.
"The curriculum is really full,
and by meeting the accreditation re
quirements, we're even more con
strained," he said.
Campbell agreed, saying with
115 units required for mechanical
engineering, it's hard to leave room
to explore with 60 units of GERs.
Andrea Goldsmith, an electrical
engineering professor and chair of
the Senate, offered her own com

mentary.
"I realized that our engineering
students have qualities that are
unique, and that students who come
to Stanford to study engineering
come because we offer something
different than CalTech or M.1.T.,"
she said. "I think that's incredibly
valuable and something that needs
to be preserved."
However, she said, basic scientif
ic and mathematical literacy should
also be required. In addition, she set
off a conversation about what con
stitutes a shared educational expe
rience and whether that kind of
common class is valuable.
"Stanford has 74 residence halls,
so there's no way we can set up a
residential college system like those
of our peers; but we can do a lot bet
ter," Campbell said. "SLE [Struc
tured Liberal Education] is an in
tensive intellectual experience in
the residence ... there's no reason
why Stanford couldn't have a SME
and a SLE and a few other resi
dence-based kind[s] of intensive ex
periences. We don't have a one-size
fits-all approach."
Vice Provost for Undergraduate
Education John Bravman '79 M.S.
'Bl Ph.D. 'B5, who announced this
week he is leaving the Farm to be

come president of Bucknell Univer
sity, said it is natural for students to
not want to take required courses,
and that students will find the easi
est way out of such a system. He
therefore urged the SUES commit
tee to ensure that if it is committed
to a program, there are not alterna
tive routes to circumvent it.
SUES will continue work over
the summer and into next year and
hopes to generate a final report by
fall 2011.
