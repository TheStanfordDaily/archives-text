## Professors look over SUES, GERs Students chime in on possible revision of required classes 
### JULIA BROWNELL SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Faculty Senate convened yesterday to dis
cuss revising general education requirements for
Stanford undergraduates.
The conversation followed a brief presenta
tion on the progress of the new Study of Under
graduate Education at Stanford (SUES). SUES is
a University initiative that last quarter began the
process of examining the undergraduate academ
ic experience for the first time since 1994.
Co-chairs James Campbell, a history profes
sor, and Harry Elam, a drama professor, spoke
about what they had learned so far about general
education requirements (GERs) and asked for
faculty feedback.
"This is not really a report yet, because we're
not at that stage," Elam said. "This is a time for
you to give us some of your opinions on these is
sues."
They first summed up the current General Ed
ucation Requirements (GERs) at Stanford, in
cluding Introduction to the Humanities (IHUM),
the Program in Writing and Rhetoric (PWR) and
breadth and citizenship requirements.
"If one would have to take them all, it consists
of 15 courses, or about one third of the courses
needed to obtain a Stanford degree," Campbell
said. "It is indeed a lot."

Campbell and Elam reported that so far the
committee has been talking to students about
their views on the current GERs. In addition,
Campbell and Elam have met with administra
tors from other schools, including Harvard, to
talk about their successes and failures in general
education.
Campbell reported that other schools warned
that the most important aspect of GERs is to be
able to articulate well why they are necessary to a
Stanford education.
"What we want to find is a rationale that
speaks specifically to Stanford ... the Stanford
today, and where students will be and where Stan
ford is in terms of the culture and the spirit of the
institution, pushing it forward into the next mil
lennium," Elam said. "The question is, why do we
want students to take that course?"
SUES has already begun the process of engag
ing with students through focus groups. Every
Wednesday night, they have dinner in one of the
dorms and talk to approximately twenty students
about their experiences with GERs.
"They felt that the freshman year was incredi
bly packed," Elam said of the dinner meetings.
"And in that sense of packing it didn't allow for
the experimentation and exploration that we've
said is essential in the first two years at Stanford."
"They felt that general education require
ments were often an afterthought," he added.
The two went on to talk about two different
models of general education generally employed:
the core classes approach, which is focused on
freshman and sophomore years, and the distrib
uted requirements approach, which is spread
across the four years of the undergraduate career.
"We have a hybrid model," Elam explained.
"Are we happy with that hybrid model? Is that
what we want?"
After the presentation, the floor opened to
faculty members to offer comments and ask ques
tions.
Kenneth Taylor, a philosophy professor, of
fered the opinion that IHUM hurts humanities at
Stanford rather than helps.
"I think because we require them to take this
massive and obtrusive IHUM, we turn students .
. . off to the humanities," he said.
Virginia Walbot, a biology professor, referred
to an old Stanford program called Science, Math
and Engineering (SME). SME, an experiment by
Stanford in the mid-19905, was an interdiscipli
nary program in the sciences meant to increase
science literacy among non-science majors. The
one-year program fulfilled the math, science and

"[Students]
felt like GERs
were often an
afterthought."
