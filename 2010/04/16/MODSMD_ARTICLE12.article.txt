## Frugal after Google

I puters," says David Cheri-
I ton, professor of computer
1 science. And as his case
proves, some of the most
successful nerds aren't just about money either.
The Canadian, Google-investing computer
science Ph.D. holds assets valued over $1 bil
lion, largely as a result of having an eye for
business and the skill of assessing the potential
of groundbreaking Silicon Valley IT. But de
spite Forbes Magazine listing him as the 616 th
richest man in the world, Cheriton is known to
cut his own hair and drive a 1986 Volkswagen.
He instead feels his wealth comes from his
work.
Like Bill Gates, Cheriton started program
ming on massive mainframe computers
which he calls "dinosaurs" before computers
were a mainstay of everyday life. Back then,
Cheriton and his fellow students at the Univer
sity of Alberta were allotted tickets known as
"dinosaur fodder." With limited access to the
mainframe, computer science majors at that
time did not enjoy the trial-and-error luxury of
today's introductory computer science classes.
"I'm sure many people have trouble relating
to this if they're taking 106," Cheriton said, cit
ing Stanford's introductory programming
methodology class.
By the end of Cheriton's first computer sci
ence class, only 35 of the initial 100 students re
mained. Cheriton made the cut. He found an in
terest in computing that he counterbalanced
with his passion for music. His enrollment in the
University of Alberta's mathematics program
was partly a result of the music department's
choice to reject him.
Despite the initial setback to his musical ca
reer, Cheriton spent his college time playing
guitar, taking opera courses and participating in
musical theatre.
"I had friends who thought I was a guitar
player!" he said,laughing.
He ended up securing a Ph.D. from the Uni
versity of Waterloo in Ontario, Canada. He has
stayed loyal to Waterloo: in 2005, the university
renamed its computer science school the David
R. Cheriton School of Computer Science fol
lowing the establishment of a $25 million en
dowment.
Cheriton moved to Palo Alto in 1981 after
being denied a $25,000 research grant at the
University of British Columbia, where he
taught at the time, in the days when a 32-kilo
byte memory card cost $lO,OOO. Stanford, in
turn, had recently allocated $1 million to com
puter science research.
"I felt like I was being starved in Canada," he
recalled."Coming to Stanford was like traveling
to a different planet."
As an "impoverished university professor,"

Cheriton paired up with Andy Bechtolsheim
who later went on to co-found Sun Microsys
tems to start a tech company in 1995. After
existing for about 18 months, the startup was
bought up by Cisco for $2OO million. In his own
words, the venture took Cheriton "from the cat
egory of having to work for a living to the cate
gory of not having to work for a living."
Meanwhile, Google founders Sergey Brin
and Larry Page were working on their Ph.D.s on

the fourth floor of Margaret Jacks Hall, Stan
ford building 460. Though Cheriton had never
personally taught or advised either of the two,
the rumor that the Canadian professor down
the hall knew a thing or two about both the In
ternet and business drove Brin and Page to seek
out Cheriton for counsel.
Whereas Brin and Page worried about li
censing their technology and raising money for
the yet-to-exist Google company, Cheriton sim
ply told them that, "If you have a baby, you need
to raise it."
He calmly explained the business theory that
he wanted to impart to the Google guys.
"Raising the money isn't the hard part
building the company is," he said, reflecting on
the initial days of the startup that today holds as

sets totaling $43 billion. "Money doesn't turn
anything into a company. It means you have
something in your bank account until you've
spent it."
The 2005 book titled The Google Story gives
Cheriton credit for realizing that "Bechtol
sheim's involvement... could drastically in
crease [Brin and Page's] prospects for success."
Believing that the students had the technol
ogy to create the kind of search engine they en-

visioned, Cheriton set up the meeting between
the Google founders and their first investor on
his own front porch in Palo Alto, at the house
that he still lives in today.
The Web site was demonstrated outdoors. As
Cheriton remembers it, Bechtolsheim ran to his
car to grab his checkbook and wrote out a check
on the spot. At the time, Brin and Page didn't
even have a bank account.
"Bechtolsheim just said, 'Well when you do,
stick it in there,"' Cheriton remembered.
In the process, Cheriton threw in some
$200,000 himself, and Brin and Page rushed to
officially incorporate their company so that
they could cash the checks issued to "Google
Inc."
Cheriton cashed in too "Yeah, the media

likes to make a big deal about that," he laughed.
But Cheriton doesn't. He was listed in the
Business Insider as one of "The 10 Cheapskate
Billionaires Who Live Like Paupers." His expla
nation: spending his money would take too
much time.
Like most Stanford professors and students,
Cheriton finds himself with a packed schedule.
But while most undergraduates cut back on
sleep in response to their struggle to do it all,

Cheriton has, in comparison to his fellow bil
lionaires, let spending take a back seat in his
day-to-day activities. The nerd in him doesn't
like to waste time on comparatively inconse
quential things.
In that sense, Cheriton still lives by the ad
vice he gave to Page and Brin many years ago
about not letting money dominate one's con
cerns: "if you have a baby, you need to raise it."
"I'm very involved in technology still, in
volved in too many things," he said in his
fourth-floor corner office in the Gates Com
puter Science building. "If you buy a fancy car
you have to figure out which car and who's
going to look after it and all that sort of stuff."
