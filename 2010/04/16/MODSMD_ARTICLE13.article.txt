# BASQUE-ING IN GARMENDIA'S PRESENCE
## 
### JORDAN RICHARD-CRAVEN 
As a young novelist, Jose Irazu Gar
mendia shrugged off the beckoning
calls of his friends and the excitement
of the town dance. Instead, he opted
for the twisted and touching tales of
his Russian literary collection.The Basque writer
had found his passion at age 14, and today, Gar
mendia is still as dedicated to reading, writing
and literary rumination as ever.
Garmendia has published many works about
the great cultural oppression imposed upon the
Basques, an ethnic group that inhabits areas sur
rounding northeastern Spain and southwestern
France, and how that oppression has affected
him as a person and as a writer. Called the "De
fender of Basque culture," Garmendia is one of
the world's most renowned and respected
Basque writers. He will be teaching two classes at
Stanford this spring which focus on Basque lan
guage, literature and culture, while tying into
modern issues affecting the group.
In a conversation in broken English and
Spanish, Garmendia described his youth in
Asteasu, a small village in the Gipuzkoa province
of the Basque Country. Noting the closeness of
the Basque communities, Garmendia called his
village "ancient" because of its distance from the
outside world, almost as if the 1920s town was
stuck in a time before the forces of modernity.
"Life was about the church, the school and
the main street, creating a very tight community,"
Garmendia explained, smiling in reminiscence.
The secluded provinciality came to an end in
the mid-1930s when the Spanish government,
under the Franco dictatorship, banned all expres
sion of Basque language and cultural identity.
The imposed discrimination strongly marked
Garmendia's adolescence, and he and his peers
found an affinity with Russian literature.
"We became hypnotized," Garmendia re
called, describing how he and his friends loved
the literature's dramatic plots and psychological
analysis of human life.
Earning himself the nickname "Fyodor,"
after the deeply philosophical writer Fyodor
Dostoevsky, Garmendia began writing his own
novels in his early teens. Yet due to political con

flict, he could not continue studying philosophy
and literature in college, majoring instead in eco
nomics at the University of Bilbao.
After school, he worked as an economist, a
bookseller, a teacher of Basque and a radio
scriptwriter, until he finally decided to focus on
writing professionally. Writing in Euskadi, the
traditional Basque language that had been
banned by the Spanish government, Garmendia
adopted the pseudonym Bernardo Axtaga.
Under this name, Garmendia has written prolifi
cally since the 19705, publishing numerous
poems, short stories, novels, children's books and
articles.
"I needed to write hidden behind a mask,"
Garmendia said, noting again how the political
oppression influenced his professional decisions.
But from behind that mask, Garmendia has
still given a great deal to Basque literature. For
his works, Garmendia has received global fame
and won multiple literary awards, such as Spain's
1988 Premio Nacional de Literatura.
"I am not exactly a teacher I'm a writer,"
Garmendia said with an almost apologetic smile.
Although he may not identify as a teacher,
here at Stanford, Garmendia is a visiting profes
sor in the department of Iberian and Latin
American cultures. He is teaching two classes:
"Cultural and Political Change in the Basque
Country," a course about the leading figures of
the 1970s postwar period, and "The Hedgehog's
Awakening: Basque Culture's Return," a semi
nar on the rebirth of the Basque language and
new literary and artistic creations.
"This seminar provides a rare opportunity to
dive deeply into Basque culture under the tute
lage of a native scholar," said Monique Johnson,
an employee at the Stanford Office of Develop
ment who is auditing the class for fun. "Professor
Garmendia is very passionate about helping us
develop an insider's perspective on what it
means to be Basque."
Garmendia also offers Stanford students a
scholarly experience that few others could pro
vide.
"I have books and films that are very difficult
to find about Basque literature," Garmendia
noted, as he rummaged through a few old philos
ophy books on his desk.

He explained that his classes are more like
discussions, with dialogue about the layers, histo
ry and power of literary traditions as well as the
complexity of human life.
"I might be too broad, too unorthodox," Gar
mendia said of his teaching style, rolling his eyes
in between short chuckles.
Garmendia's love of literature, philosophy
and deep analysis of life emanates through every

minute of conversation with him. His apprecia
tion for them is evident, and he hopes to instill
this curiosity in his students.
"Literature is about life in general. Life is an
infinite thing," Garmendia said. "Life and litera
ture are without end."
