## EDITORIAL Allow students to opt out of Stanford Dining meal plans 
### 
Stanford Dining provides our campus
with a variety of eating options and, for
the most part, tries to accommodate stu
dents with special dietary concerns. Most stu
dents on campus are able to make due within
the particular confines of their meal plan and
dining options. Even so, some students may
still feel unnecessarily restricted by their meal
plans, prompting them to ask why students
are not afforded greater liberty when it comes
to opting out of the meal plan altogether.
A small number of eating associate spots
exist which allow students to purchase eating
rights at Row houses without having to live
on the Row. Otherwise, exemptions from the
meal plan are issued for medical or religious
reasons only. Both exemptions require an ap

opt out option for upperclassmen only. The
campus community would not be damaged
by allowing students to have a broader range
of options, and so we would like to see Stan
ford Dining make an effort to explore these
options.
The Editorial Board agrees with Stanford
Dining's statement that mealtimes "play a
key role in helping to build a sense of commu
nity within a house and in promoting interac
tion between residents, faculty and guests."
Even so, providing an opt out option could fa
cilitate easier living for students with unique
dietary restrictions and students desiring
more independence and self-sufficiency.

Even with the alternative dining options
available, there is bound to be a small minor

reasons of taste, convenience or lifestyle,

plan altogether in order to buy and prepare
their own food. Yet Stanford Dining, despite
its accommodation for dietary and religious
