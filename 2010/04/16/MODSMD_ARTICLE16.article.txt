A A Okay, maybe it's not that bad. But it's
almost that bad.
In a move students did not see coming,
Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education
John Bravman '79 M.S. 'Bl Ph.D. 'B5 is leaving
Stanford to become president of Bucknell
University this summer. In disbelief, one of
the first things a friend said to me on Monday
was that Dean Bravman (we are former
FroSoCoans, so to us he will always be
"Dean") would never leave Stanford. In
hindsight, I guess crazier things have hap
pened.
Students know him in different ways. To
some, he is the imposing figure who hands
out iPods at big freshmen events. To others,
he is the man who (allegedly) did a lot of not
so-wise but hilarious things while in a frat at
Stanford (ever heard the story of when his
friends dropped a TV off of a three-story bal
cony onto a car below?). To others still, he is
the inspirational example of someone who
went from being on academic probation as a
Stanford undergraduate to becoming a lead
ing scholar in his field (a story he tells at
Sophomore Convocation when many of us
are just starting to make the real transition to
Stanford).To many students, he is our class or
Sophomore College professor.
To those who lived in Freshman Sopho
more College, he is the B.A.D. (a.k.a. the
"badass dean" - did I mention the TV
story?). Dean Bravman is the man who in
vites FroSoCo residents into his home for
dinner with a faculty member every week,
who hosts us in his backyard for barbeques
on Fridays, who gives us waking-hour access
to his 800-DVD collection, who always has
time for us (even in moments when he does
n't really have time for us), who demon
strates in every interaction with students his
belief that with a little encouragement, we
can do amazing things.
And it is not just through words. In the fall
of last year, I held a fundraiser for a public
service organization by selling Krispy Kreme
donuts around campus. After I e-mailed our
dorm chatlist inviting people to buy donuts,
Dean Bravman asked me to get donuts for
the whole dorm out of his pocket. And he did
it again in each of the next two quarters.
While he does not broadcast these things, I
know I am not alone. There is a video on
You Tube of him donating to students raising
money for microfinancing in White Plaza.
When a student asks him what just hap
pened, he says, "I just invested in our stu
dents' belief in microfinancing capital." His
encouragement is often private and always
sincere.

Dean Bravman has always seemed like a
visionary to me, someone who sees both stu
dents and Stanford growing to reach our full
potential. He talks with so much enthusiasm
about University initiatives to give under
graduates more research opportunities and is
so confident in handing over the reins to oth
ers in the Stanford community to embark on
big projects. It is hard to think this man was
made for any place but Silicon Valley. And as
if leaving the wellspring of innovation were

not enough to stop him, has he forgotten how
cold Pennsylvania is?
I take a little consolation in the fact that it
cannot be easy for him. On Monday, he sent
FroSoCo residents a special note about his
departure. In it, he quoted lines by Adlai
Stevenson that Stanford President Donald
Kennedy used to invoke in his commence
ment remarks to Stanford students:
"Your days are short here; this is the last
of your springs. And now in the serenity and
quiet of this lovely place, touch the depths of
truth, feel the hem of Heaven. You will go
away with old, good friends. And don't forget
when you leave why you came."
Dean Bravman assured residents that he
will go away with his "old, good friends" and
will never forget why he came. After 35 years,
during which his longest departure from the
Farm was for his three-week honeymoon,
John Bravman has become a part of Stanford.
There is a beautiful line from Shakespeare in
which Hamlet expresses how unique his fa
ther was, saying he will never "look upon his
like again." Stanford could say the same: it
will not see two John Bravmans. While we
wish him and his family the very best, perhaps
it is a time to add that we too will never forget
him, nor what he did for us.

Aysha is feeling grateful. Send her your com
ments at abagchi@stanford.edu.

Dean Bravman has
always seemed like a
visionary to me,
someone who sees
both students and
Stanford growing to
reach our full
potential.
