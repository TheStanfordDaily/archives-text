## Friday is the Day of Silence 
### SAM KING '12 Queer/Straight Alliance Co-Chair 
Friday is the Day of Silence, which shows
the importance of voice. Participating
lets me think about the significance of
communication, what it means to be denied
a voice, and what the role of an ally is.
At one level, being silent on the Day of
Silence is an act of solidarity, but the day's
significance comes from teaching partici
pants about voice. At my high school, the
Gay Straight Alliance passed out note pads.
They weren't speaking, but they still had a
voice. This diminishes the event because
voice is important. I am a debater, so my
voice is my most powerful weapon.The Day
of Silence is about people who are denied
that ability to communicate: people without
a voice. I am in constant communication.
When I am silent, people wonder and ask. In
this sense, I am in a position that the true vic
tims of silencing are not in. My community
gives me every opportunity to speak. My si
lence is voluntary.
For many LGBTQ people, silence is
forced on them. There are laws, such as the
military's "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" policy, that
force LGBTQ people to remain silent about
their identities. Social norms silence: speak
ing can mean loss of employment or physical

harm. More insidious is the fear. Because
heterosexism is ingrained into our culture,
even spaces that are safe (where people will
not face discrimination for self-expression)
are not open because there is a chance that
the space isn't safe. Even if the chance is
small, if that chance is always present, it is
easy to fall into the habit of self-censorship.
Thinking about voice helps me make con
nections with other groups. LGBTQ people
are not the only people that have been si
lenced. I read Speak, a book about a rape
survivor who was silenced. The same psy
chology of the character in Speak is present
in other silenced groups.
During the Day of Silence, that same psy
chology is present in me. At the lunch table,
with my roommate, or in any other situation,
I want to talk, but there is a barrier. I bite my
tongue, and I disengage myself from my sur
roundings. In my class sections, my peers
participate, and I want to voice my ideas, but
all I can do is bite my tongue and disengage
from academics. That was the most signifi
cant thing that the Day of Silence has shown
me: the immediate psychological effect of
being denied self-expression. For me, speak
ing is organic. During the Day of Silence, I

think through everything that I want to say
and consciously silence myself, becoming an
observer rather than participant in my own
life.
The chance to observe makes me realize
the importance of allies. When people ask
why I am silent, I rely on my roommate or the
LGBT-CRC's shirt to volunteer an explana
tion. The principle applies to allies: some
LGBTQ people (and, as I said earlier, other
groups) are silenced, and they need allies and
community organizations to speak for them.
One role of an ally is to help those who can
not help themselves.
Not everyone participates in the Day of
Silence, and not everyone should participate
in it. A counselor should not be silent be
cause their silence would harm others. The
Day of Silence is a student movement. It is a
way for students to learn about the value of
communication, the people that can't com
municate, and the ways to help. I do not
speak during the Day of Silence to remind
myself that it is necessary for allies to speak
out every day.
