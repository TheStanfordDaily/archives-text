## FIRST LOOK Stanford football debuts in intrasquad Spring Game 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford football team will return to
competition for the first and only time this
spring when the squad splits in two and faces off
in the annual Cardinal and White Spring Game.
The contest, held at legendary Kezar Stadi
um in San Francisco at 2 p.m. on Saturday,
serves as the conclusion of two sessions of prac
tices that allow the coaching staff to evaluate
the team for the coming year. With numerous

positions up for grabs, the endeavor is forma
tive both for the players and the overall pro
gram.
Offensive line coach Tim Drevno will lead
the White team, with the assistance of David
Shaw, Vic Fangio, Randy Flart and Brian Polian.
The Cardinal team will be headed up by outside
linebackers coach Lance Anderson, who will be
joined by Greg Roman, Derek Mason and Pep
Hamilton. Head coach Jim Harbaugh will over
see the contest.
The two squads drafted players last week

end, with the Cardinal team selecting quarter
back Andrew Luck first overall. White combat
ed that with a strategy that both loaded up on
the first team defense and stole away Luck's
best weapons, such as wide receivers Ryan
Whalen and Chris Owusu and offensive line
men Jonathan Martin and David DeCastro.
The Cardinal team, by contrast, focused on ver
satility, as it consists of two-way players such as
Alex Loukas and Owen Marecic, as well as
youth. Luck's primary receiver in the game, for
example, will likely be talented freshman

Jamal-Rashad Patterson.
The team is playing at Kezar for the first
time since 1942. Stanford Stadium is currently
undergoing reseeding, and thus was not avail
able for use, but Harbaugh said that he hopes
that using Kezar becomes an annual tradition.
Since opening 85 years ago, Kezar has been
the home stadium for both of the Bay Area's
professional teams the Oakland Raiders
and San Francisco 49ers as well as the site of
the East-West Shrine Game and numerous
high school sporting events, including the city
championship.
Arguably the most memorable moment in
Stanford-Kezar history came in 1940, when the
Cardinal opened its season with a shutout vic
tory over San Francisco so dominating that it
earned the team the moniker of "Wow Boys."
That squad would go on to win the Rose Bowl
and finish the year undefeated.
Now, 70 years later, Stanford returns.
The gates will open at 1 p.m., admission is
free and parking is 10 dollars. Fans coming from
Stanford without cars can access Kezar via the
Caltrain and the MUNI. For those that cannot
attend, the game can be heard on KZSU's in
ternet-only stream.

GAME NOTES: Stanford football will play its annual Cardi

San Francisco. The game will be the first true look at
Stanford's football team since last fall and will serve a
good indicator of the Cardinal's prospects for this up
coming season. The spring game will also mark the
debut of Stanford's new-look defense, which is transi
tioning under new defensive coordinator Vic Fangio.
