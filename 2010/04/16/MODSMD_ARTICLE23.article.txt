# Wildcat Showdown
## 
### KABIR SAWHNEY DESK EDITOR 
After a strong start to the Pac-10 season, the
Stanford Softball team will go on the road again
this weekend for its third conference series of the
year. The No. 8 Cardinal (30-6,4-2 Pac-10) is com
ing off a road series against Oregon State. Stanford
won the first two games of the series, but the
Beavers battled back to avoid the sweep.
The Cardinal also had similar results in its first
conference series, at home against Cal two weeks
ago. Like the series against Oregon State, Stanford
edged the Golden Bears in the series' first two con
tests before falling in the final game.
Stanford will now travel to Tucson, Ariz, to take
on No. 4 Arizona. While the Wildcats (32-7, 2-4)

boast an impressive record, they have not fared
very well against highly-ranked competition. They
split a two-game series with No. 11 Missouri and
lost a close game to No. 2 Michigan.
Like Stanford, Arizona has played two confer
ence series, both on the road. It won its first series,
2-1 against No. 6 Arizona State, before being swept
in Seattle by No. 1 Washington last weekend. It
also won a doubleheader on Wednesday against
UTEP.
The last meeting between the two teams was in
last year's NCAA Tournament, where the Wild
cats took two out of three from the Cardinal at the
Super Regional to move on to the Women's Col
lege World Series.
In this weekend's series, both teams will look to
their top pitchers to lead them to victory.
For Stanford, freshman Teagan Gerhart has
pitched extremely well this season, leading the Car
dinal to its current record. Gerhart has a 22-5
record on the season, with a 1.58 ERA in 185.2 in
nings pitched.
Though Gerhart has been able to contain op
posing offenses for most of the season, her per
formance in the final games of the last two confer
ence series has not been as strong. After shutting
down both Cal and Oregon State in the first two
games of the respective series, Gerhart has proved

unable to carry the momentum into a third consec
utive start. Though starting three games consecu
tively is not unusual for a Softball pitcher, it remains
to be seen whether or not Gerhart will be able to
sustain her pitching throughout the weekend.
Arizona will counter Gerhart with its own fresh
man, Kenzie Fowler. Though she has not been as

dominant as Gerhart, Fowler will enter the week
end with a 21-5 record. She also threw a no-hitter in
the first game against UTEP on Wednesday.
Offensively, Stanford has been led all season by
senior left fielder Alissa Haber. She currently holds

GAME NOTES: Stanford will face its stiffest challenge of the
year this weekend, on the road at No. 4 Arizona. The Cardi
nal will rely heavily on freshman pitcher Teagan Gerhartto
contain the powerful Wildcat offense. Despite its ranking,
Arizona has had a tough conference season thus far, win
ning two of three over Arizona State before being swept by
Washington. The Cardinal is coming off of a 2-1 series win
over Oregon State.

a .469 average and has 53 hits and 25
RBIs for the season. With five home
runs, Haber is also one of the main
sources of power in the Cardinal line
up.
However, she was not as strong as
these numbers would suggest in the
Cardinal's last conference series
she went 3-9 against Oregon State
with no RBIs or runs scored.
Stanford's second offensive star
has been sophomore second base
man Ashley Hansen. She is hitting
.378 on the season. Like Haber, she
was somewhat quieter during the
Oregon State series, going 2-8 with
one RBI.
Stanford will play three games this
weekend against Arizona, on Friday,
Saturday and Sunday. The first two
games will begin at 7 p.m., while the
final one will start at 12 p.m.
