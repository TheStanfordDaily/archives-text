# How to win Directors' Cup No. 16
## 
### Danny Belch On My Mind 
Sweet 16 is in sight. We are
about two-thirds of the way
through the 2009-10 athletics
season and again, Stanford is
in the lead for the Directors'
Cup. We currently have 792 points,lead
ing Ohio State (703), Florida (648),Penn
State (621.50) and Virginia (610.50).
These scores include everything
through the winter except men's and
women's gymnastics.
Typically, Stanford has scored
around 1,200 points to win the Direc
tors' Cup. It again will take something
over 1,100 to win, which means we prob
ably need at least 350 points from the re
maining sports to feel good about our
chances.
Stanford still has all the spring sports
left to score, and a threat doesn't look to
be coming from any of the schools ex
cept for Florida. Only the Gators have
the strength in their spring sports to give
Stanford a challenge. I will go on record
saying that Florida has the only chance
to stop Stanford from claiming No. 16.
After the men's and women's gym
nastics teams compete at NCAAs over
the next two weeks, Stanford should in
crease its lead over all the teams. But
spring is crucial for the Cardinal if it
wants to win another one.
Florida is having an extremely strong
spring. The Gators are ranked higher
than Stanford in several spring sports
and their teams have the looks of cham
pionship contenders. Let's do a sport-by
sport comparison for the sports that are
left to score:
Men's gymnastics: Florida doesn't
have it, Stanford No. 2
Women's gymnastics: Florida No. 2,
Stanford No. 6
Men's tennis: Florida No. 6, Stanford
No. 7
Women's tennis: Florida No. 3, Stan
ford No. 10
Men's track and field: Florida No. 1,
Stanford NR.
Women's track and field: Florida No.
5, Stanford No. 18
Baseball: Florida No. 7, Stanford No.
22
Softball: Florida No. 3, Stanford No. 8
Women's water polo: Florida doesn't
have it, Stanford No. 2
Men's golf: Florida No. 16, Stanford
No. 2
Women's golf: Florida No. 19, Stan
ford No. 12
Women's rowing: No rankings; Flori
da doesn't have it, Stanford is defending
champ
Men's volleyball: Florida doesn't
have it, Stanford No. 1
While there is a lot of time left in the
season and a lot of things can happen
come NCAA time, if Stanford cannot
match Florida's postseason success, the
Cardinal could be crossing its fingers
come June. Just going off rough esti
mates from the above rankings, when
spring is over Florida has the potential
to pick up about 150 points on Stanford
(Stanford is currently ahead of the
Gators by 144 points). This all depends
on how teams finish, but Florida does
have the potential to pass Stanford.
The fun part is that both Florida and
Stanford have traditionally strong
spring sports. The battle will come
down to sports where Florida and Stan
ford are close to evenly matched, like
Softball, golf) women's gymnastics and
tennis. Any early NCAA exit by either
team will give a huge swing to the other
side. Any national championship won
by a team will be a big 100 points, unless
of course it's Stanford vs. Florida for the
title.
Stanford can put Florida away with
strong finishes by men's gymnastics,
men's volleyball, women's water polo
and women's rowing four sports
that Florida doesn't have at all. All four
Cardinal teams have legitimate poten
tial to win national championships,
which would be 400 points to Florida's
O.That would all but cement Stanford's
16th. Anything less, though, and Florida
could still have a chance.
So the quest for Stanford's 16th con
secutive Directors' Cup starts now.
Men's gymnastics is currently compet
ing at NCAAs and has the potential to
win the title. Women's gymnastics
heads to the NCAAs next week and
will face off with Florida. The rest of the
spring sports are heating up. Stanford
must continue to play well across the
board to hold off what will surely be a
late charge from the Gators.

Danny Belch is conspiring to add 10
more varsity sports so we win the Direc

need those at dbelchl @stan ford. edu.
