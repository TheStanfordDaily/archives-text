## Merkel visits Stanford Chancellor addresses Afghanistan, climate 
### TYLER BROWN STAFF WRITER 
German Chancellor Angela
Merkel emphasized "freedom and
partnership" in a speech at Stanford
on Thursday where she called for
strong international cooperation on
winning the war in Afghanistan, re
pairing repercussions from the fi
nancial meltdown and fighting cli
mate change. It was the only speech
Merkel is to give during her visit to
the United States this month.
Dinkelspiel Auditorium was
packed wall-to-wall for Merkel's ad
dress, given mostly in German, be
fore the chancellor attended the
dedication for the Center for Auto
motive Research at Stanford's Volk
swagen Automotive Innovation
Lab.
"In the 21st century, we have re
sponsibilities where we only can en
sure success when we stand togeth
er," Merkel said through a translator
after a moment of silence for four
German soldiers killed in
Afghanistan this week.
"Security is the precondition for
us being able to live in freedom,"
Merkel said. She acknowledged that
many Americans and Germans had
doubts about Western military in
volvement in the Middle East, but
was adamant about following
through in Afghanistan.
"I would like to state here very
clearly: I stand behind this mission,"
Merkel said. "I support this and I
think it is necessary to support this
mission until this country is able to
stand on its own feet."
Nevertheless, Merkel said, she believes
that the world has to take a careful and in
telligent approach.
"We need to do more research; we need
to gain more insights . . . about
Afghanistan, the region, ethnic tribes, roots
of readiness to resort to violence," she said.
One of the greatest single challenges
making today different from the Cold War
era, she said, is that nuclear material could
now be obtained by terrorist groups.
"It is absolutely obvious that such a
threat will not be mastered by a single
country alone," Merkel said.
Turning her attention to Iran, Merkel
explained that the Iranian nuclear program
could not be stopped without the support
of countries beyond the United States and
Europe.
"[l]t is not only a danger to Israel, it is a
danger to all of us," she said.
She said that Europe and the United

States are natural partners.
"If we want to maintain our prosperity,
Europe and the United States need to
work together" to retain economic and
technological advantages, she said.
In addition, there "need to be structures
where Russia also feels its place."
"[We need to] convince those who come
from different cultural background that we
don't wish to impose ourselves," she said.
Another pressing issue, she said, recov
ering from the international economic cri
sis.
"It came at us out of the blue two years
ago, and the repercussions were felt all over
the world," Merkel said.
While wealthy countries were hit hard
by the crisis, Merkel said she believed they
owe it not only to themselves, but also to
developing countries, to revamp the world
financial system. She proposed a new glob
al financial architecture that would extend

beyond current organizations like the
World Bank and trade agreements like
NAFTA.
"We need to do everything we can to
prevent protectionist measures and [en
courage] free world trade," she said. She
added that there should be "an equitable
balance between economic freedom and
rules."
Merkel also touched upon climate
change, which she described as, "one of the
great challenges of mankind."
"In Copenhagen we advanced very little
... it is very hard to find common answers
among more than 100 participants," she
said.
Merkel appealed to the students in the
audience to press current leaders to legis
late solutions to climate change. "Turn up
the heat, exert a little pressure," she said.
Speaking in English, she related her
years as a student in Germany behind the

Iron Curtain.
"I would like to thank the very first pres
ident of Stanford, David Starr Jordan, who
made the wise decision" to choose Stan
ford's motto, Merkel said. Translated from
German, the University's motto is, "The
wind of freedom blows."
"The wind of freedom this is what I
felt when the wall came down," Merkel
said.
In the audience, a graduate student in
applied physics asked the Chancellor, "Is
there a certain event that incited you to go
into politics?"
It was "personal experience that made
me go into politics," Merkel said. "The wall
fell. I felt as many others did that we can't
allow the same people to pursue politics
who had done it before."
