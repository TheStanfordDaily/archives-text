# Hot Chicks are Always Crazy

From Morgan J. Freeman, the
executive producer of tele
vision shows "16 and
Pregnant" and "Teen Mom" and a
one-time director for "Dawson's
Creek," comes "Homecoming," a

teen horror-thriller. The film fea
tures Mischa Barton as Shelby, a
lunatic ex-girlfriend obsessed
with her somewhat unimpressive
high school boyfriend/football
star. Madness ensues when the
football star, Mike Donaldson
(Matt Long), returns home to his
hometown on Homecoming

Weekend for the home school's
homecoming game hoping to
introduce a new girlfriend,
Elizabeth (Jessica Stroup), to his
parents, but without a clear plan
for how to deal with Shelby. His

analysis of the situation: "It's
ancient history." Yeah, sure Mike.
As one might predict, Barton
is clinically insane. So after hitting
Elizabeth with her car, Shelby
decides to hold her hostage
(because she's crazy). However,
there seems to be a problem with
this logic. Who's to say that Mike

won't just go back to
Northwestern and spark up a
romance with another severely
undernourished (and severely
average-looking) college girl?
Crazy Shelby, you should have
kidnapped Mike. This indiscre
tion is made all the more confus
ing by the movie's tagline, which
should rationally lead to a deci
sion to kidnap Mike: "If [Shelby]
can't have him, no one will." But
we digress. This movie is terrible
from the gold Audi that Mike
drives to the unidentifiable accent
that Shelby (Barton) speaks in. Its
only saving grace is a horribly
emasculated cover of David
Bowie's "Modern Love," which is
played by the avant-garde house
band at The Pitt Bar. But we
haven't even gotten to the good
(worst) stuff yet.
Confronting Shelby near the
movie's clumsy climax, Mike, in
his only flash of enlightened
awareness, offers his own
Kierkegaardian diagnosis of
Shelby's condition: "Shelby. You're
sick. You need help." And as
wooden as his brief, stoic appeal
is, he's right. Shelby is sick; this
seems to be the only real charac
ter trait the movie effectively gets
across. Kierkegaard, if he were
alive (he is in our hearts), would
probably say that she is suffering
from a sickness of the self, or
more precisely, despair not
wanting to be oneself — or even
more precisely, despair in weak
ness consciously in despair not
wanting to be oneself or even
more precisely than that, despair
over the earthly or over some
thing earthly, or to be more pre
cise, despair over Mike and
Elizabeth, or to be more precise,
despair over Mike having moved
on to Elizabeth. The fact that she
cannot rid herself of her self, that
is, her self as exists currently,
without Mike's love (though why
she values his love so highly con
stitutes a very good question),
prompts her to resort to murder,
kidnapping and severing
Elizabeth's Achilles tendon with
garden clippers. What she needs is
faith, or to be more precise, to
become a knight of faith.
"Homecoming" is strangely
reminiscent of Rob Reiner's film
adaptation of Stephen King's
"Misery," and though Barton may
not quite match the level of bril

liance of Kathy Bates' bat-shit
crazy performance, it makes up
for this with the fact that it is
Mischa Barton we are looking at
(see photo below) and not Kathy
Bates. It also offers us a glimpse
into the mind of a despairing self.
Or it would, that is, if the movie
gave us a glimpse into any of its
characters. In the end, Shelby
(Barton) is much like a needy
puppy that constantly wants to be
petted, which you think is really
cute, but you're too busy calling
animal control to care.

In line with the classic "bad
movie" paradigm, much of the
dialogue plays out like a series of
awkward interactions between
real people pretending to be peo
ple who aren't in awkward inter
actions, but who aren't pulling it
off or to be more precise,
actors in awkward interactions as
professionals or to be more
precise, actors struggling with a
cardboard script. To demonstrate
the depth of this movie's lack of
self-awareness (ironically, this is
one thing that Kierkegaard says
can keep you out of despair,
through pure ignorance), here is a
conversation between Elizabeth

and a man at the motel she is try
ing to rent a room at:
"Don't got no rooms tonight.
Big game tonight."
"No but your sign says
"Sign's broken. We only sell
out once a year anyway."
"Homecoming?"
"Bingo."
In this scene, probably the best of
the movie, "Homecoming" offers
up its only piece of self-knowl
edge: its title. Bingo indeed.
