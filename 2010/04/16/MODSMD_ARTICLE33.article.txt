# Under Heaven: A Tour de Force

### â€“ sarah GUAN contact sarah: sguan@stanford. edu 
Guy Gavriel Kay, the author
of such critically
acclaimed works as
"Ysabel," "Tigana" and "The
Sarantine Mosaic" (a duology),
has produced a new masterpiece:
"Under Heaven," a tale of ghosts,
feuds, power and love, set against
the sweeping backdrop of the
Empire of Kitai, an analogue of
Tang Dynasty China.
The protagonist, the emi
nently sympathetic Shen Tai, is
the second son of the late Shen
Gao, one of the most respected
Kitan generals in recent memory.
Near the end of his life, Shen Gao
told his son of his role in a
decades-old battle on the shores
of the lake Kuala Nor a historic
victory at the cost of forty thou
sand men, both Kitan and
Taguran and of his regrets
since. Tai, upon his father's pass
ing, retreats in mourning to Kuala
Nor, where for two years, he
buries the dead, Kitan and other
wise they are indistinguishable
by day and is haunted by the

wailing of their ghosts at night.
Tai's isolation comes to an
abrupt end when, to honor his
lakeside vigil, the princess Cheng
wan, the daughter of one emperor
and consort to another, makes
him an impossibly lavish gift: two
hundred and fifty of the famed
Sardian horses, of which any one
steed alone is a tremendous
reward. In a single stroke, she
places him squarely in the center
of imperial politics and court
intrigue, a world where he finds
himself utterly unprepared and in
often-mortal peril. Tai learns to
navigate these treacherous waters
by necessity, at great speed
even as the reader beside him is
plunged headlong into a realm of
itinerant poets, politically savvy
concubines, ambitious ministers
and strategically overlooked
princes. With another war threat
ening the imperial dynasty itself,
everybody of any importance
takes an interest in his Sardian
horses, and therefore in him. So,
too, did this reader.

"Under Heaven" is a master
work of epic proportions, which
at once captures the essence of an
entire people and society, and
delves into the lives of the indi-

viduals who populate his story,
from the crippled beggar on the
street to the courtesan-turned
concubine whose servant he once
was. Kay's literary style, too,
evokes the cultural legacy of

imperial China; his descriptions
of politics, his poetry (or rather,
translations thereof) and his com
mand of the full spectrum of
human emotion echo the Four
Great Classics and the preeminent
scholars and poets of the Tang
dynasty. This reader's one gripe,
admittedly a relatively small one,
lies with Kay's translations;
"Under Heaven" includes, for
example, an English rendition of
Li Bai's famous poem "Reflections
on a Quiet Night," a translation
which does not quite manage to
reproduce the cadence or mean
ing of the Chinese, beyond the
bones of the literal verse. Kay
fares better with original poetry;
at one point, Tai and his
estranged older brother find
themselves improvising before a
very literate audience a theme
common to many of Kay's works
and their verse is actually quite
good.
"Under Heaven" is in many
ways a historian's novel; never
does Kay lose sight of the butter

fly effect the actions of the
lowliest beggar do, in this case,
alter the course of an empire.
Throughout the book is a perva
sive sense of history, an awareness
among the major players that
their deeds will be recorded for,
and judged by, their heirs in per
petuity. It makes for a potent
sense of realism, a deep invest
ment in the lives of the characters
and a story of breathtaking
grandeur.
"Under Heaven" arrives in stores in
the United States on May 3, and
the author will be in Menlo Park
for a reading on May 9.
