# Miuccia Prada is my Homegirl

Despite the weather lately,
which seems to suggest
otherwise, it is, in fact,
springtime. How can I tell, you
ask? Birds singing? Purgatory
reorganization? Young love blos
soming? Nope. I knew the
moment that a certain six inch

tall, pink satin, sparrow print pair
of MiuMiu platform heels
appeared on the feet of The
Cherry Blossom Girl, my favorite
Parisian blogger. Although freak
ishly tall and waifish, she is in fact
a real person (as opposed to a
super model), who wears these
immaculate pieces of perfection

out in the world,
passing the rest of
us mere mortals
on the street. Ah
yes, the indu
bitable arrival
of spring has
come, I am
sure of it,
now that
the

moments of art I fell in love with
October last year, far away in the
magical land of Paris Fashion
week spring/summer 2010, have
made their first tentative steps
into reality.
Right now we are in the
midst of the final phase of this

season's artistic existence. That
pair of perfect pink shoes exists in
reality. We are now integral mem
bers of the product of Miucca
Prada's genius! But, before you get
too excited about how much clos
er your degree of separation from
Miuccia Prada just got, you may
ask, who is Miuccia Prada? She is
the Italian fashion designer who
has been the creative genius in
residence at both Prada since
1978 founded by her grandfa
ther in 1913 and MiuMiu, its
dispersion line, which she created
in 1992. But she is also my hero,
largely due to my obsession with
her most recent spring collection
to which the pink platforms
belong.
pt Its debut last October came
out of Miuccia's brilliant mus
ings on our culture's obsession
with youth. In a dimly lit room
complete with gilded walls and a

maroon carpet older than I am, to
the throbbing "Cat People" by
David Bowie, out came a cat suit.
Not so much one of the skintight
leather variety, but instead, of the
"impeccably tailored suit sepa
rates covered in white cartoon
cats on a dark textured pant and
cropped jacket divided by dense
daisies on the exposed shirt" kind,

all of which stood on towering
navy satin platforms further
destabilizing her playful paradox
of youth. In this opening look of
grown up pieces, the shape of the
jacket creating the illusion of a
bust and womanliness is bom
barded by the girlieness of an
impossibly long side braid, Lolita
lips, satin Mary Janes and a bevy
of cute graphic spring flora and
fauna. As the show progresses
Prada continues to play with this
tension by slipping in a recurring
reclining nude figure among the
Jack Russell terriers and swallows.
Additionally, as the silhouettes
become swishier and more bil
lowing, each look is topped off by
a crisp, attached shirt collar. As
the hemlines rise to school-girl
like pleats whole panels of fabric
go missing, although balanced by
the billowing long 70s sleeve, a
nod to the increasingly unsettling
Mr. Bowie in the background. A
color progression seems to lead to
innocence since the navy in the
opening look becomes baby blue,
followed by reds and pinks punc
tuated by sheer nude mesh inserts
covered in iridescent paillets;
however; the culminating white

look, on model Lindsey Wixson,
age 15, is still dotted with pink
and interrupted by bare skin drip
ping in crystals. Throughout the
entirety of the show the shifting
intersections of innocence and
sex, youth and sophistication,
undulate and consistently main
tain a slightly unnerving tension
that is somehow perversely beau
tiful.
Now don't fret; that feeling,
her genius and those thirty min
utes of live performance art do
not stop there. It steps off the
runway, is constantly re-imagined
and explored by countless pho
tographers and stylists on the
glossy pages of magazines every
month until it arrives. In the
flesh, in the world, each piece that
Miuccia touched with her vision
lives out among us. Here's to hop
ing for a lucrative summer job to
really ground and integrate me
with every step that I take in this
profound and living piece of art.
