The next few weeks promise lots of sunny days on Wilbur Field, hap
hazard games of sloshball, a few midterms sprinkled here and there
and everything else that is loved about spring quarter. The next few
weeks will also have television finales galore, specifically the conclusion of
many epic seasons of reality tv. Intermission understands that most
Stanford students are busy and don't have time to catch up on all things
reality, so we have compiled season summaries of the most important pro
grams to easily catch you up in time for the finales.

Survivor: Heroes vs. Villains
In the daddy of all reality shows, seven-time Emmy winner Jeff Probst finds
himself on another tropical island for the twentieth season of this smash
hit show. For this special anniversary, the players are not random citizens

vying for the million dollars instead, crowd favorites from past seasons
are back to battle it out, with one tribe of "heroes" and one of "villains."
From the get-go, this show was packed with drama. On the heroic side,
golden boy J.T. is proving not to be the honest farmer he made himself out
to be when he won two seasons ago. Hagrid-esque Rupert is no longer in
charge of the game, rather, he has become a lackadaisical figure, without
much to contribute to the strategy or physical side of the game. The villain-

ous tribe, however, is exponentially more dramatic than its adversary.
Sneaky mastermind Russell went head-to-head with long-time veteran and
master competitor, Boston Rob. With a divided tribe full of weak minds,
Russell was able to persuade many that Rob was a threat and needed to be
voted out. In the most controversial move of the season, lunatic Coach
snuffed Rob's proverbial torch this proved to be unwise, because the
next week, Coach was sent packing because of Russell's mindgames. Make
sure to catch the last half of the season it has been one of the best. The
tribe has spoken.

Amazing Race
Another reality television mainstay, the "Amazing Race" has proved seasons
over that it is not only one of the "classier" reality shows, but also one that
requires some skill to get ahead. Host Phil Keoghan (if nothing else, watch
for his accent!) leads twelve teams on a race around the world for a million
dollars, though many would say the race itself is the prize. This season,
audiences find entertainment in teams like Jet and Cord, cowboy brothers
that don't go anywhere without their Stetson hats, and Michael and Louie,
two stereotypical cops that are doing surprisingly well for the amount that
they bumble around. Perhaps most hilarious though is supermodel couple
Brent and Caite the latter widely known as Miss Teen South Caroline, or
the "like such as" girl on You Tube. She really is that stupid! With only four

teams left in the race, expect the aforementioned cowboys or brother duo
Dan and Jordan to take home the million in the home stretch of this epic
race.

RuPaul's Drag Race 2
The most underwatched and underhyped show on television is perhaps the
most hilarious. Queen of all drag queens, RuPaul, hosts this hybrid of
"America's Next Top Model," "Project Runway" and "American Idol," which
is in its second season on Logo, and, due to spreading popularity, now on
VHI. Twelve of the most talented up-and-coming drag queens are put to

the test in challenges that require only the most fierce outfits, incredible
bodies, great wigs, and, of course, an insane amount of attitude. Never has
a show on television had more drama and sass both in and out of drag,
these drag queens are nothing short of hilarious. As the season comes to an
end, only the most fabulous ladies are left in the running for the title of
"America's Next Drag Superstar." Raven, the rebel from L.A., looks like the
kind of guy you wouldn't want to mess with in a dark alley. With lots of
tattoos and some threatening piercings, Raven screams "bad-ass," but in
drag, Raven is stunning, a classic beauty with hints of Angelina Jolie.

Jujubee, the sassy comic relief of the bunch, is identical to one Kimora Lee
Simmons, dripping in hip hop swagger. Rounding out the top three is Tyra,
or as RuPaul calls him, "The Other Tyra." Untucked, Tyra is an unassuming
and soft-spoken young man, but transformed, Tyra is hot like Beyonce, and
ten times more booty-licious. If only to satisfy your curiousity, check out
"RuPaul's Drag Race 2." You'll be hooked after five minutes.
