You would think the son of
one of the best singer-song
writers of the last five
decades would have enough natural
talent and musical guidance to cre
ate an album that, at the very least,
is worth listening to. He proved
there was some potential for success

as the lead singer of the popular
90s rock band The Wallflowers, but
with the release of his sophomore
solo album, "Women + Country"
(released April 6), Jakob Dylan, son
of legendary Bob Dylan, disap
pointingly delivers a slew of sub
par, often boring songs. I feel it's
unfair to compare him to his father;
however, the sad truth is, they are
incomparable Jakob Dylan does
n't even hold a candle.

Dylan's first solo album,
"Seeing Things," was released in
2008 and was met with mild success
and mixed reviews. In listening to
this first album, I loved Dylan's style
and sound, but generally disliked
the CD because the songs were triv
ial and ordinary. On his second

album, Dylan unfortunately
encounters the same problem. It is
very irritating because I really want
to like his music; he has an acoustic
style with a folk blues vibe, and that
is generally my favorite genre. He is
a great singer with a very distinct
and deep voice that is both soothing
and mature. However, his likable
sound is ultimately unable to save
the lackluster songs that comprise
the album.

The content of most of the
songs is unimportant and border
line cliche, which, combined with
the mellow sound, produces boring
tracks. It felt as though he was try-

ing to be profound, but missed the
mark the songs lack emotion
and depth and are not very interest
ing. Another problem is that they
tend to blend together, which in
some respects is appreciated
because his album has a compre
hensible sound, but in this case,

works against him. With this laid
back kind of music, the songs are
not very loud or excited, and so, to
compensate, they should speak to
listeners. They should tell a story,

and the content should feel person
al, whether it is or not. The songs
don't necessarily have to be sad or
intense, but they should have a mes
sage.
Although I was dissatisfied
overall with the songwriting, there
are two songs that I do enjoy. The

fifth track on the album,
"Everybody's Hurting," does well to
blend the two components I feel are
lacking in the other songs a folk
blues vibe and a meaningful, yet
mild, message. Whereas other songs,
like "Nothing But the Whole Wide
World" or "Lend a Hand," detail
overstated and trifling ideas,
"Everybody's Hurting" has the right
combination. It also doesn't hurt

that it's catchy. Similarly, the eighth
track, "Truth for a Truth," is one of
the songs worth giving a listen.
Regrettably, I predict that this
album will make very little impact;
it just doesn't stand out enough.
The songs sound nice, and are fine
to listen to in the background as
you focus on something else, but do
not effectively work as engaging hits
neither musically nor in the
lyrics. He has a great vibe, but has
yet to translate it into anything
other than dull. I think the main
culprit for this problem is that
Dylan has yet to truly define himself

as an artist. He seems to span multi
ple genres, and his content is vague
and impersonal. Once he puts more
of himself into his music, maybe
then I'll want to listen to his work.
Perhaps I was expecting, even hop
ing, for something more because of
his legendary lineage, but Bob
Dylan's son or not, I'm disappoint
ed.
