# Coachella Preview: The Mecca of Musical Lovers

An hour outside of the
Empire Polo Grounds in
Indio, Calif., an hour east of
LA in the baked-dry SoCal desert,
something is not quite business as
usual.
Thousands of cars pack the
two-lane razor-straight avenues

that, for the other 362 days of the
year, only see trucks and horse trail
ers. Suburban stucco-coated houses
and the occasional cluster of palm
trees punctuate the pancake-flat
landscape, but today, stragglers
crowd the sidewalks, looking to buy

last-minute tickets or just a bottle of
cold water. Sun's pounding down.
Traffic's inching along. In the dis
tance, a handful of tents and stages
mark a musical oasis on the hori
zon, and the mass of cars, travelers
and hipsters continues its slow, tired
march toward the prize.

Welcome to Coachella.
Not everyone "gets" the hype
about this festival, and that's under
standable. It's overpriced, it's hot
and dusty, it's in the middle of
nowhere and you have to miss bio
lecture and your Friday econ sec-

tion. If you're thinking, "I might as
well sit by the pool and listen to my
iPod," then you probably should.
But for everyone else, being
there is the whole point. Fifty thou
sand people turn one vast, water
sucking lawn into a communal
experience. During the heat of the

day, festivalgoers subject themselves
to exorbitant price markups for a
soft frozen lemonade and seek shel
ter in one of the three tents or in
the shadow of a huge art installa
tion. The air pulses with muted
reverb as sound waves from five

stages hit interference in the center
of the fields. People nap anytime,
anywhere. Hipster teens frolic in
neon colors and body paint among
the throngs of guys who all seem to
be wearing the same uniform: cargo
shorts, no shirt, Rayßans and straw
fedoras.

By the time night falls, a few
people begin trickling out of the
polo grounds, sacrificing the end of
the final sets of the day in an
attempt to avoid outgoing traffic.
Most people, though, regale them
selves with the night's headliners,
taking it easy farther back from the
stage and watching the big screens,
or going all out at the front of the
mosh pit or in the chaos of the
Sahara dance tent.
The festival hits curfew around

midnight (and if bands go past the
cutoff time as they have in the past,
it's an expensive penalty), and the
grounds empty slowly, only to see
the same die-hards return twelve
hours later, refreshed and ready to
rumble.

This year, headliners include
Jay-Z, Pavement, Muse, Thom
Yorke, Gorillaz, LCD Soundsystem
and Tiesto. Festival passes have sold
out as usual, meaning scalpers will
line the walk from the parking lot
to the polo grounds, shouting out
ticket offers. Festival organizers usu
ally wait until a few days before the
event to announce specific set

times, which sets off a frenzy of
"scheduling" between all the bands
that, unfortunately, will have some
overlapping set times.
Friday opens slowly, with
smaller bands earlier in the day.
Yeasayer and She & Him start sets
around 5 p.m., and the action only
picks up from there. Passion Pit,
whose popularity has shot up in the
last couple years, takes the stage a
bit later, and Vampire Weekend, a
festival staple, gets an evening slot
on the second stage. The main stage
gets to host LCD Soundsystem
before Jay-Z takes over around 11
p.m., finishing the first day.
Although Jay-Z's presence on the
lineup made some festival veterans
scoff, it's not so much of an aberra
tion as it might seem, and his set
will certainly be an interesting twist
on a lineup of regulars.
Saturday will see fans running
between the main Coachella stage
and the second outdoor stage, as
Tokyo Police Club and the XX have

slightly overlapping set times. David
Guetta packs the Sahara Tent
around 9 p.m., while across the
field, Muse takes over the main
stage. Other late-night acts include
MGMT, the Dead Weather and
Tiesto.

Finally, Sunday's lineup is set to
be a heartbreaker. Spoon and
Phoenix share the dinnertime slots,
and festival closers Gorillaz and
Thom Yorke have simultaneous
ending sets that will certainly spur
some deep, tough choices for festi
valgoers (or a lot of people running
back and forth between the two
stages). Yorke, with his live band

Atoms for Peace, will always be a
sight to see Radiohead shows are
legendary in part because of his live
prowess and Gorillaz will always
be a surprise, since their live shows
in the past have incorporated huge
animated sequences of the virtual
band to back the live performers on
stage.
So, look around your Monday
classes for those classmates with
bags under their eyes and smiles
plastered on their exhausted faces.
It'll be those of us who aren't afraid
of a little dirt in exchange for the
best weekend that spring quarter
has to offer.
