# Glee Spring Premiere: More "Hell" than "O"
##

Tuesday night was the
much-anticipated spring
premiere of "Glee." Even
without much advertising, the

first hour after a four-month hia
tus drew a season high of 13.6
million viewers. The episode may
have been a win for advertisers
and Fox, and television program
mers everywhere looking to capi
talize on the tantalizing effect of
the mid-season break. For me and
my six comrades on the couch,
however, the return of the musical
extravaganza was a major let
down.
In the course of writing this
column, I have discovered that
pilot episodes are either red her
rings or pitch-perfect capsules of
tone for a series. "Parenthood," for

example, which I reviewed in
January, has proved to be just as
boring and unimaginative as it
was then. Fortunately and unfor
tunately, "Glee" falls perfectly in
between these classifications. The
premiere just less than a year ago
invigorated audiences with the
novelty of the musical form but
also made traditionalists wary
with its incoherent narrative. The
fall show, in turn, was a roller
coaster that alternately came dan
gerously close to killing you with
its unsupported plot points and
thrilled you with the artistry of its
musical numbers. Anyone who
watched the pilot and fall pre
miere closely could have predict
ed, and probably did predict, this
fluctuating quality. With that
hindsight, I'm going to try to
evaluate Tuesday's spring pre-

miere a little more closely.
By a little more closely, I
mean bluntly, because I think the
episode was worse than awful
it was dull. My reaction is due, in
part, to the thoughtless promo
tions, which gave away not only
the opening sequence of the
episode but also its second-best
song, "Gives You Hell." Ideally, the
latter would be an aspect of the
episode you could enjoy more
than once, but I find any song
that is staged as seated in the
music room inherently boring.
The first song of the episode,
"Hello, I Fove You," was framed in
such a contrived manner that it
played into the constant criticism
that the musical numbers are too
staged. The finale, "Hello

Goodbye," typically showcased
lackluster New Directions chore
ography and the cast all dressed
up, but the arrangement was not
as affecting as "Somebody to
Love" from earlier in the season.
The highlight of the episode
came with the introduction of
Jesse St. James, the lead singer of
Vocal Adrenaline, the rival glee
club, played sublimely by
Jonathan Groff. His first musical
impression upon the millions of
viewers was a powerhouse duet
with Lea Michele of Lionel
Richie's normally cringe-inducing
"Hello." Groff's beautiful, clear
tenor matched Michele's power
house belt even better than Cory
Monteith does as Finn. In the
episode, and surely going forward,
Groff's character plays a manipu
lative love interest for Rachel

Berry. That's all well and good,
except that the hour did not pur-

sue this enough. Once again, the
episode bowed under the weight

of Glee's complex narrative arc
we saw Rachel and Finn date and
break up; Emma and Will date
and break up; and Rachel and
Jesse date and "break up." It was
clear to me that Rachel had not
broken it off with Jesse at the end
of the episode, but the show failed
to tease us with previews of her
attempts to hide her forbidden
love from the club. Dead ends
abounded Tuesday night, a choice
that left me with no idea what to
expect going forward. Currently,
the only momentum carrying us
into the end of the season is
Madonna.
Speaking of divas, why didn't
Idina Menzel sing? And why was
her character, the coach of Vocal
Adrenaline, so mediocre? To be
honest, I was more entertained by
her grating personality in
"Enchanted" than this role. The
competing love triangles centered

around Rachel and Mr. Schuester
respectively left me with an
episode signifying nothing. Glee
and the SAG awards love its
ensemble casts, but it's totally
acceptable to pick the lead of an
episode and to neglect the others.
Sue Sylvester, in all honesty, got
the shaft last night, as her one-lin
ers and plot to undo Glee seemed
more regurgitated than usual.
With next week's "The Power
of Madonna" episode, we can be
sure that it will leave you crying
with joy or crying with uncom
fortable laughter, as I was last
night with the "Vogue" preview.
Glee, don't take yourself so seri
ously.
