## Stanford plays for No. 1 seed 
### CHRIS JUHNKE DESK EDITOR 
The No. 1 Stanford men's vol
leyball team has a big weekend
ahead as it looks to build momen
tum before the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation (MPSF) Tour
nament.

After dominating in its final
two home games last weekend to
clinch home-court advantage
through the quarterfinals of the
MPSF Tourney, the Cardinal (18-
5,15-5 MPSF) is looking to clinch
its first conference title since 1997.
One win on the road this weekend
guarantees the team a share of the
championship, while two wins
would win it outright.

However, winning the title
won't be an easy task for the Card,
as it faces two quality league op
ponents in UCLA (15-12, 10-10)
and defending national champion
UC-Irvine (14-13,9-11).

Outside of the conference
championship, stakes are also high

with regard to home-court advan
tage and consideration for the sin
gle NCAA Tournament at-large
berth should the Cardinal fail to
win the MPSF Tournament. In a
conference as competitive as the
MPSF, where the top five teams
are separated by only two games,

home-court advantage provides a
needed boost in the playoffs. If the
Cardinal wins both of its matches
this weekend, it will play at home
throughout the MPSF Tourna
ment but if it were to lose both
matches, the team could end up as
low as the No. 4 seed.

The Cardinal has been rolling
recently, winning its last three
matches and 11 of 12 overall a
streak that has elevated Stanford
to the No. 1 national ranking. A va
riety of players have led the Cardi

NOTES: Stanford, currently the No. 1 team
in the nation, will look to secure the top
seed in the MPSF tournament with two
wins this weekend. If it loses both match
es, the Cardinal may drop to the fourth
seed. Stanford must win the tournament
to guarantee a spot in the four-team
NCAA Championships. Meanwhile, both
UCLA and UC-lrvine are fighting for the
final spots in the conference tournament.
The Bruins are currently seventh in the
conference, while the Anteaters are
eighth.
