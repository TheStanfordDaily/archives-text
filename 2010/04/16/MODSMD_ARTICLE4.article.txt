## Stanford plays for No. 1 seed 
### CHRIS JUHNKE DESK EDITOR 
The No. 1 Stanford men's vol
leyball team has a big weekend
ahead as it looks to build momen
tum before the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation (MPSF) Tour
nament.

After dominating in its final
two home games last weekend to
clinch home-court advantage
through the quarterfinals of the
MPSF Tourney, the Cardinal (18-
5,15-5 MPSF) is looking to clinch
its first conference title since 1997.
One win on the road this weekend
guarantees the team a share of the
championship, while two wins
would win it outright.

However, winning the title
won't be an easy task for the Card,
as it faces two quality league op
ponents in UCLA (15-12, 10-10)
and defending national champion
UC-Irvine (14-13,9-11).

Outside of the conference
championship, stakes are also high

with regard to home-court advan
tage and consideration for the sin
gle NCAA Tournament at-large
berth should the Cardinal fail to
win the MPSF Tournament. In a
conference as competitive as the
MPSF, where the top five teams
are separated by only two games,

home-court advantage provides a
needed boost in the playoffs. If the
Cardinal wins both of its matches
this weekend, it will play at home
throughout the MPSF Tourna
ment but if it were to lose both
matches, the team could end up as
low as the No. 4 seed.

The Cardinal has been rolling
recently, winning its last three
matches and 11 of 12 overall a
streak that has elevated Stanford
to the No. 1 national ranking. A va
riety of players have led the Cardi

NOTES: Stanford, currently the No. 1 team
in the nation, will look to secure the top
seed in the MPSF tournament with two
wins this weekend. If it loses both match
es, the Cardinal may drop to the fourth
seed. Stanford must win the tournament
to guarantee a spot in the four-team
NCAA Championships. Meanwhile, both
UCLA and UC-lrvine are fighting for the
final spots in the conference tournament.
The Bruins are currently seventh in the
conference, while the Anteaters are
eighth.

Senior opposite Evan Romero (above) will attempt to lead Stanford into the MPSF Tournament in the team's last conference matches this weekend.
Romero has been one of Stanford's best players all season, and was named MPSF Player of the Week after last week's conference matchup.
nal, including senior opposite Evan
Romero, sophomore outside hitter
Brad Lawson and senior setter
Kawika Shoji.
Romero, who set a career high of
37 kills in last weekend's win over
Pepperdine, was named the MPSF
co-Player of the Week last week for
his efforts in the wins over the Waves
and USC. Lawson, for his part, is a
two-time AVCA National Player of
the Week this season and has 400
kills on the season to lead the Cardi
nal, while Shoji is second in the na
tion with 13.86 assists per game.
While Stanford has plenty of star
power, UCLA has a few stars of its
own, in particular senior outside hit
ter Garrett Muagututia. Muagututia
and sophomore opposite Jack Po
lales each average over 3.5 kills per
set for an offense that contains a con
siderable amount of firepower.
The Bruins will be further moti
vated by a desire to advance to the
postseason, something that is not yet
guaranteed for them. Currently,
UCLA sits at seventh place in the
MPSF and needs one win this week
end over the Card or Pacific to ad
vance to the tournament.
UC-Irvine faces a similar chal
lenge to the Bruins, and is currently
sitting in the final playoff spot at
eighth in the conference. The
Anteaters can potentially finish any
where from seventh to 11th place
and will need a strong showing this
weekend against Pacific and Stan
ford to advance into the MPSF Tour
nament.
The Anteaters also boast a suc
cessful offense, led by sophomore
opposite Carson Clark, who is third
in the nation with 5.01 kills per set.
He is complemented by junior out
side hitter Jordan DuFault, who
hammers 4.04 kills per set. The Car
dinal will also have to deal with the
strong service game of the
Anteaters, who rank second in the
MPSF with 1.46 service aces per set.
The games this weekend are in
credibly important for Stanford, and
while the team's success up to this

point has guaranteed it a spot in the
MPSF Tournament, a strong finish to
the season will bring the Card that
much closer to a berth in the four
team NCAA Tournament and the
ultimate goal of an NCAA champi
onship.
The season-ending road trip
starts with the UCLA match at 7
p.m. in Los Angeles on Friday night
and ends at UC-Irvine on Saturday,
also at 7 p.m.
