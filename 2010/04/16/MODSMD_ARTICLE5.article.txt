# PLAYOFF BOUND
## CARD WILL END REGULAR SEASON IN BERKELEY 
### MICHAEL LAZARUS STAFF WRITER 
With two more victories this week to ex
tend its winning streak to six matches, the
No. 7 Stanford men's tennis team seems to
be peaking at the right time. On Tuesday, the
Cardinal (17-5,4-1 Pac-10) defeated Santa
Clara 7-0, and the team posted another
shutout against San Francisco on Wednes
day.
"Our team is starting to gain a bit of con
fidence with every match," said sophomore
Bradley Klahn. "Guys are starting to play
better. The last few matches have really
helped us in making progress moving to
ward NCAAs."
Against Santa Clara, Stanford quickly
claimed the doubles point and never looked
back. Klahn and fellow sophomore Ryan
Thacher, the No. 3 doubles team in the na
tion, finished first, cruising to an 8-1 victory.
Confident in his team's ability to beat the
overmatched Broncos, head coach John
Whitlinger switched up his doubles lineup.

At the No. 2 spot, junior Ted Kelly took sen
ior Richard Wire's normal spot alongside
junior Alex Clayton. Kelly did not waste his
opportunity, winning 8-4 to secure the point.
Freshman Walker Kehrer and junior
Greg Flirshman, filling in for freshmen Matt
Kandath and Denis Lin, were the only team
to lose, 8-5.
Whitlinger kept his regular singles lineup
intact and the starters came through. Out of
the 14 singles sets played, the Cardinal only
lost two. Clayton, Klahn and Wire were the
first to finish, giving Stanford the clinching
four points.
Against USF, Whitlinger followed a sim
ilar strategy for similar results. Clayton and
Wire played in the No. 1 doubles spot for the
first time all season, easily winning 8-2. Kan
dath and Lin were back in action, playing in
the No. 2 spot, and quickly defeated an over
whelmed Dons team 8-2.
With Thacher receiving a break from
doubles, Klahn and Kelly rounded out the

NOTES ! Stanford is riding a six
match winning streak coming into
this weekend's match at No. 13
California. In order to retain a
chance at a Pac-10 title, the Cardi
nal must defeat Cal and needs
UCLA to defeat conference-leading
USC. In the last meeting between
the Cardinal and the Golden Bears,
which was on the Farm, Cal won
the match in a 4-3 upset. Stanford
will be led by sophomore Bradley
Klahn at first singles.

Stanford will take on Cal in its final regular-season match before the
Pac-10 Tournament. It will rely on sophomores Bradley Klahn and
Ryan Thacher, as well as junior Alex Clayton, to defeat the Bears.


doubles lineup, winning 8-2.
Even with Klahn taking a day off
from singles, Stanford did not drop a
set. Thacher, Lin, Wire, Kandath and
Hirshman all won in two sets, while
Clayton's opponent retired in the sec
ond set down 6-1,2-0.
"It was nice to get a little day off
from singles," Klahn said. "I know our
coach wanted to get Alex and Rich in
at No. 1 doubles. I played with Ted last
year. It's always fun to get out there
and get a quick win."

The victory over San Francisco was
Stanford's third consecutive shutout.
The last time the Cardinal lost a point
was a week ago against No. 22 Wash
ington.
Stanford knows it cannot expect
another easy victory tomorrow at No.
13 California. The last time the Cardi
nal faced the Golden Bears, on Feb. 20
at the Farm, Cal pulled off a shocking
4-3 upset.
"They beat us on our home courts,"
Klahn said. "They showed a lot of de
sire to come back. I think we're just
going to have to stay on them and not
let up."
Besides the added pressure of the
rivalry, tomorrow's match will carry
special significance for Stanford. The

match is the final regular season
match, and the Cardinal would love to
extend its winning streak to seven and
maintain its momentum going into the
Pac-10 Championships next week.
If Stanford wins, it would also have
a chance to claim a share of the Pac-10
title, one of the team's goals from the
outset of the season. In order to do so,
the Cardinal will need help; besides
defeating Cal, UCLA would need to
beat USC this weekend.
The last time the Trojans faced the

Bruins, USC won 6-1 at UCLA. USC
will be at home tomorrow.
Still, the Stanford players are trying
to focus on Berkeley instead of score
board watching down in Los Angeles.
"We can only control what we do
against Cal," Klahn said.
The match is set to begin at 1 p.m. in
Berkeley, Calif.
