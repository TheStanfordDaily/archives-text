## Fruits of their labor 
### ADAM COLE STAFF WRITER 
On Thursday afternoon
last week, the trees out
side the Post Office held
more than just oranges. A
handful of members of
Stanford Glean perched among the
leaves, stretching to pick the fruit that
bowed the laden branches. On the
ground, more students used long-han
dled, claw-like pickers to reach the
tops of the trees.
After barely an hour of work, the
students had filled several backpack
ing knapsacks to the brim with fresh
fruit. The bright harvest was later
hauled up to San Francisco and deliv
ered into the hands of the hungry.
Caitlin Brown 'l2 and Susannah
Poland 'll formed Stanford Glean
nearly a year ago, and they say the
fruit-picking project is all about taking
advantage of wasted potential.
"We live in such a fertile area no
one should go hungry," Poland said.
Plus, Brown added, "If the fruit rots
on the trees un-harvested, the repro
ductive system starts to shut down, and
rotting fruit on the ground attracts
pests."
The idea of Stanford Glean was
conceived in a class called "The Car
bon Cycle: Reducing Your Impact."
Environmental earth system science
(EESS) Prof. Page Chamberlain
teaches the course but said that since
the beginning, Brown and Poland have
been the driving force behind the proj
ect.
"Those two are so enthusiastic
you don't want to get in their way," he
said. "They'll just bowl you over."
Chamberlain added that Stanford
Glean's efforts have connected Stan
ford with a larger community of Bay
Area groups trying to bring organic,
healthy food to the homeless.
Lauren Anderson is a member of
this community and the director of
Produce to the People, a non-profit
that focuses on food security and agri
cultural education. Every Sunday
from one to three, she works at the
Free Farm Stand distributing organic
produce to anyone who needs it. The
food comes from local gardens and
farms, and recently from the heavy
backpacks of Stanford Glean.
"It should be a right of all people to
be able to eat healthy food," Anderson
said. "The effort is to create communi
ty through this act of sharing."
Chamberlain said the Free Farm

Stand and the Julian Pantry, another
program that receives donations from
Stanford Glean, gives the urban un
derclass access to the same healthy,
sustainable resources that Whole
Food shoppers can afford.
For those in need, Stanford Glean's
produce is not just free and nutritious,
but convenient.
"If you don't have a kitchen, dry
rice doesn't do you much good,"
Poland explained. "But an orange or
persimmon you can put that in
your pocket."
Stanford Glean started small, har
vesting fruit from a single tree in front
of the President's mansion. Now they
are officially recognized by the Haas
Center and have a Facebook group
with 60 members. Like generals as
sessing a battlefield, they have begun
to map the fruit trees on campus, push
ing colored pins into a huge aerial pho
tograph and uploading coordinates to
Google.
"Look, we've got persimmons, avo
cados, pomegranates, guavas," Brown
said, leaning over a list of the surveyed
trees.
"This is amazing an incredible
variety," Poland added. "It means we
can keep on harvesting all year
round."
Last year, Brown and Poland dis
tributed fliers in nearby faculty neigh
borhoods to assess the amount of sur
plus produce. In the coming weeks,
they plan to expand their canvassing
territory.
"If you have fruit or veggies to
share," say the pamphlets, "we would
love to help you harvest!"
If residents respond, another pin is
added to the map.
"More than anything else we do,
this map is something that will last,"
Brown said. She believes it will help
future gleaners know where to har
vest, and increase community aware
ness.
"People don't know what's around
them," Poland said. "They don't see
fruit on trees as food."
On Thursday, passing students
often reacted in surprise to see the
gleaners at work.
"Wow, are these ripe?" asked one
passerby.
"Yep," responded Brown, proffer
ing a farm implement. "Want to pick
some?"
Over the course of the afternoon,
several students stopped to try their
hand with the picker. Brown and
Poland hope these recruits will be
come dedicated gleaners who will help

take advantage of the informal or
chard spreading across their map.
"With the produce they collect,
they can give all the fruit a single food
pantry needs," Chamberlain said. With
more students helping, even more
pantries could be supplied.
Stanford Glean is determined not
only to take advantage of existing for
gotten produce.
"Instead of taking the waste of our
landscape, we could change the land
scape," Poland said.
She and Brown currently grow pro
duce on a small plot in the community

garden, but they hope Stanford will ex
pand its agricultural efforts to include
a real farm. This summer, Poland will
be working in the city to complete a
farm on an abandoned city block in
San Francisco. The farm's yield will
support the Free Farm Stand.
For now, there is plenty of fruit to
collect on Stanford's campus.
"Fruit happens every year, and it
just keeps happening whether people
pick it or not," Brown said.

"If you don't have a kitchen, dry
rice doesn't do you much good,"
Poland explained. "But an orange or
persimmon you can put that in
your pocket."
Stanford Glean started small, har
vesting fruit from a single tree in front
of the President's mansion. Now they
are officially recognized by the Haas
Center and have a Facebook group
with 60 members. Like generals as
sessing a battlefield, they have begun
to map the fruit trees on campus, push
ing colored pins into a huge aerial pho
tograph and uploading coordinates to
Google.
"Look, we've got persimmons, avo
cados, pomegranates, guavas," Brown
said, leaning over a list of the surveyed
trees.
"This is amazing an incredible
variety," Poland added. "It means we
can keep on harvesting all year
round."
Last year, Brown and Poland dis
tributed fliers in nearby faculty neigh
borhoods to assess the amount of sur
plus produce. In the coming weeks,
they plan to expand their canvassing
territory.
"If you have fruit or veggies to
share," say the pamphlets, "we would
love to help you harvest!"
If residents respond, another pin is
added to the map.
"More than anything else we do,
this map is something that will last,"
Brown said. She believes it will help
future gleaners know where to har
vest, and increase community aware
ness.
"People don't know what's around
them," Poland said. "They don't see
fruit on trees as food."
On Thursday, passing students
often reacted in surprise to see the
gleaners at work.
"Wow, are these ripe?" asked one
passerby.
"Yep," responded Brown, proffer
ing a farm implement. "Want to pick
some?"
Over the course of the afternoon,
several students stopped to try their
hand with the picker. Brown and
Poland hope these recruits will be
come dedicated gleaners who will help

take advantage of the informal or
chard spreading across their map.
"With the produce they collect,
they can give all the fruit a single food
pantry needs," Chamberlain said. With
more students helping, even more
pantries could be supplied.
Stanford Glean is determined not
only to take advantage of existing for
gotten produce.
"Instead of taking the waste of our
landscape, we could change the land
scape," Poland said.
She and Brown currently grow pro
duce on a small plot in the community

garden, but they hope Stanford will ex
pand its agricultural efforts to include
a real farm. This summer, Poland will
be working in the city to complete a
farm on an abandoned city block in
San Francisco. The farm's yield will
support the Free Farm Stand.
For now, there is plenty of fruit to
collect on Stanford's campus.
"Fruit happens every year, and it
just keeps happening whether people
pick it or not," Brown said.

GLEAN FROM THE RICH, GIVE TO THE POOR: Two members of Stanford Glean give out their harvest at Julian
Pantry. Stanford Glean is a student-led group that picks organic fruit from Stanford campus and distributes it to the homeless in the Bay Area.
