# When a sidewalk's a home

I I change. Every lit
tle bit helps," reads
-A- one woman's sign.
A blue-eyed, 20-something brunette
sits quietly outside of Starbucks in
downtown Palo Alto, watching as
countless people mill by without so
much as a downward glance.
The woman's name is Tanisha
Roberts, and she has been homeless
and begging for money for the past five
years.
Roberts is just one of many of Palo
Alto's homeless population who stake
out a spot on University Ave. to ask
passersby for donations. According to
the 2009 Santa Clara County Homeless
Census and Survey, 178 homeless indi
viduals live on the streets of Palo Alto.
An almost-high school graduate,
Roberts dropped out of Gunn High
School in 2004 when she became preg
nant. Then, a disagreement with her
mother landed Roberts and her fiance
on the streets. Since then, Roberts has
tried to work retail jobs in various
places but nothing has stuck.
"I have a hard time learning, and
most of my family isn't doing well ei
ther," she said. Roberts added that she
had ADD, and was in special education
for most of her life.
Now on the streets, she said that she
and her fiance seek shelter at hotels on
"good days," when they manage to
scrounge up enough money.
"But most days, it's just really slow,"
Roberts said. "There aren't that many
people, and usually, they just pass by."
Roberts stops talking and makes eye
contact and smiles at about 15 people in
a 30-minute period, but only one de
cides to drop a dollar bill in her metal
jar.The other 14 scurry past, pretending
not to see her.
According to Roberts, services were
provided to her, but they weren't

enough to support her fiance and two
children, who are both now in foster
homes.
"People sometimes come and give
me food and talk to me, but it's not
enough for me to provide for my ba
bies," she said.
Only a block down from Roberts,
another homeless person has set up
shop. A 50-something man with long
white facial hair and shoes that are rub
ber-banded together, he shows signs of
mental illness. Refusing to reveal his
last name, the man said that his name
was "Tom," and he was from Denver.
Tom gathered more attention from
the public than Roberts as he yelled,
"Extra change?" Even without a physi
cal sign, more people turned around
and took notice of the man, though only
two people handed him change.
"I sleep in a hot dog blanket in a
house on that street," he said, motion
ing towards the direction of the Oppor
tunity House. "They give me pants."
According to Tom, he received 15
dollars that day.
"It's pretty hard for me to do what I
have to do," he said. "People give me
money, but that's because I gave them
money before, but so I tell them I want
extra change, and I ask 20 times a day,
and they're really nice people."
Don Barr, associate professor of pe
diatrics, is one of the co-founders of Op
portunity Center, a house that provides
social services, health care and basic
food, clothing and shelter needs to
homeless people. The Center aims to
aid the homeless by providing job
training programs. If the person is diag
nosed with a mental illness, they are
provided with Section 8 vouchers for
rental assistance.
The city of Palo Alto does not dis
courage panhandling directly, accord
ing to Barr. However, there is a "Sit-Lie
Ordinance" in place, prohibiting people
from sitting or lying on the sidewalks.
Roberts said that she sat down on
the sidewalks when she could, claiming
that she hasn't been prosecuted yet. She

explained that no one has used brute
force against her; most people usually
just ignore her.
"It's tiring having to be out here all
day," she said. "But I need to do this."
Marie Baylon 'l2, co-president of
the Stanford Night Outreach to the
Homeless, is working to listen to the
stories of people like Roberts. Her
group often does "night walks" to hand
out first-aid kits, food and clothes. Night
Outreach's main focus, Baylon says, is
to provide attention to the homeless
population, who are most often over
looked.
In groups of less than five people,
about 30 Stanford students hit the
streets on Friday nights to make the
people "feel a part of the community,"
according to Baylon.
"It's important to establish some so
cial connection," Baylon said.
She explained that she was diag
nosed with a mental illness in previous
years, and what motivated her to re
main in school was her support net
work.
"Just that people would talk to me,
and just making me feel like a part of
the community still was really powerful
for me," she said. "It really motivated
me to go to school again."
"One of the most powerful things
you can do to someone is listen to their
story and respect it," she added.
