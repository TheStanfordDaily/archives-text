## Palo Alto Bowl keeps doors open 
### MELISSA CHAN 
Palo Alto Bowl on El Camino Real is set
to extend its lease to 2014, contrary to an an
nouncement earlier this year that the alley
would close as developers planned to demol
ish the south Palo Alto site and adjoining
Thai restaurant.
The half-century-old bowling alley has
been a Palo Alto landmark for 55 years, serv
ing as a frequent location for birthday parties
and Stanford-hosted "screw your room
mate" shenanigans.
In November, the alley announced its
lease would run out this month and it would
close to make way for a new hotel, 26 condo
miniums and a pedestrian and bike path
after Barry Swenson Builders purchased the
3.6-acre parcel on which the alley sits. The
news was met with some opposition in Palo
Alto and on campus.
Now, construction plans are on hold; cur
rent alley manager Rhythm Smith will as
sume the position of owner beginning May 1.
She purchased the alley from the owner, Rex
Golobic '45, who owns two other bowling al
leys in Daly City and San Mateo.
According to Smith, future management
will most likely stay the same because, as gen
eral manager, she already runs the alley
"the desk, the snack bar and the whole nine
yards," she said.
She hopes to build the business back up in
the coming year, believing the role of the
bowling alley within the community is a sig
nificant one.

"There really is not a lot to do around
here," Smith said.'Tt's almost like a historical
monument, it's been around here for so long.
It's a good place for the kids to come and
have a good time and safe time and not have
to worry about anything."
"The longer they're around the better, as
far as I'm concerned," said Magali Ferare 'lO,

who has planned events at Palo Alto Bowl.
Some local high school students remem
ber either hosting or attending birthday par
ties there.
"I hosted my 12th birthday party at that
bowling alley; when I heard that it would be
closing, I felt really sad," said Gunn High
School student Annie Tran. "I hope that it
will stay open at least until I am 50, because
that was a place where many of my high
school memories were made."
"I am optimistic for the future of the alley,
and I am so glad that it is staying open so that
my friends and I can continue to create mem
ories there for years to come," said bowler
Francesca Milinovich.
