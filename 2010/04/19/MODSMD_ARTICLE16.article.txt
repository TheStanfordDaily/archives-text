## Sustainability GER under consideration Proposal may move forward following a vote on Friday 
### CAITY MONROE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Committee on Undergraduate
Standards and Policies met April 9 to
discuss a proposal by students to have
"Sustainable Citizenship" added as a
fifth option to fulfill the Education for
Citizenship (EC) General Education
Requirement.
The committee has not made an of
ficial recommendation to the Faculty
Senate, but Philippe Buc, a history pro
fessor and chair of the committee (C
-USP), shared his thoughts on the pro
posal, saying that while the proposal
contains a few details that could be
changed or modified, it made a strong
argument and merits further discus
sion in the Faculty Senate.
"In our opinion, the proposal is
clear, forceful and articulate enough to
be considered as is by the Senate," Buc
said in an e-mail to The Daily.
He added that the proposal "needs
to be taken seriously and fully dis
cussed."
According to Buc, another possibil
ity for the sustainability proposal is to
integrate it into the "Global Communi
ty" EC requirement.
"We felt there was room for debate,
especially insofar as the relationship
between the potential Sustainable Civ
ilization option to the Global Citizen
ship option," Buc said. "As a result of

that slight discussion within the com
mittee, we didn't say we're going to en
dorse it. We said we liked it as a propos
al... it's a proposal we think the facul
ty should discuss."
The proposal submitted by students
argued that currently, sustainability ed
ucation is largely absent from the body
of courses intended to provide Stanford
students with knowledge necessary to
act as citizens in today's world. With is
sues of sustainability, resource alloca
tion and the environment becoming in
creasingly salient, some students want
these issues to be given more attention
in the Stanford curriculum.
The description of the "Global
Community" requirement in the Stan
ford bulletin says classes in that area
"address the problems of the emerging
global situation," including economic
development, health and "environ
mental exploitation and preservation."
Modification of academic policies
like these is a long process, but Buc
cited a few possible directions the ini
tiative could take from here.
"Likely outcomes are, short of an
outright rejection, adoption with
likely tinkering of the definition as
the fifth option within the GC GER, or
redefinition of the Global Citizenship
option of the GC GER to include con
siderations of sustainability," he said.
C-USP plans to meet on Friday to
formally vote on whether or not the
proposal will be sent to the Faculty
Senate for discussion.
