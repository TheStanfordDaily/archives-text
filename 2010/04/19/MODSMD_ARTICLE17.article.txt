## Morningstar argues for Eurasian energy 
### ERIN INMAN 
Richard Morningstar, the U.S.
Secretary of State's special envoy for
Eurasian energy, spoke Friday on a
panel for the Stanford U.S.-Russia
Forum about the political and eco
nomic conflicts surrounding gas
pipelines in Eurasia.
"Most importantly, we want to
constructively engage with Russia on
energy," Morningstar said when out
lining the United States' present pol
icy toward Russia in the "energy
era."
Morningstar spoke at the panel
Friday with Stanford professor Coit
Blacker, the director of the Freeman
Spogli Institute for International
Studies, and Jan Kalicki of Chevron.
Morningstar said the United
States' Eurasian energy policy was
formerly "Nabucco-centric," sup
porting the Nabucco pipeline that
would transfer natural gas from

Turkey to Austria and bypass Russia
entirely, raising questions about the
federation's influence in the region.
Russia, meanwhile, has been a
major proponent of the projected
South Stream pipeline. Seen as a
competitor to the Nabucco pipeline,
it would transport gas from Russia
into Europe, following a similar
route to the Nabucco through Eura
sia.
The United States has since aban
doned its former Nabucco-centric
outlook in favor of a more balanced
Eurasian energy strategy.
"We are not interested in zero
sum games anywhere," Morningstar
said.
He recognized the need for con
structive solutions to Eurasian ener
gy conflicts and cited interconnec
tions through transnational pipelines
as one such solution.
In that vein, Morningstar said the
United States was not opposed to
the development of the Nord Stream
pipeline in Europe controversial
for environmental and geopolitical
reasons because it created neces
sary links between Germany and
Poland.

"We can't be more European
than the Europeans," he said. "We
have no choice but to take the posi
tion that this is a European issue and
we're not opposed to it."
When asked why the United
States is involved in Eurasian energy
issues, Morningstar said European
energy security is in the United
States' interest because of interde
pendent economies.

"We're not preaching to the Eu
ropeans," he said. "We can only be
helpful in some ways. When it comes
to internal European politics, that is
not our business, and we do not try to
make it our business."
"We're trying to depoliticize dis
cussions on pipelines," he added.
"We are only asking that countries
can make their own decisions in how
to produce and distribute resources
in the region," rather than having to
submit to the control of Russia as the
dominant supplier of Europe's natu
ral gas.
The forum also brought in college
students from across the country.
Alice Underwood, a Harvard un
dergraduate, attended the panel as a
Stanford U.S.-Russia Forum dele
gate.
"This is a new perspective for
United States interjections in for
eign affairs," Underwood said.
Amanda Tuninetti, a Princeton
undergraduate, also attended as a
delegate.
"It's representative of this admin
istration's move towards greater co
operation with [Europeans] and
away from trying to dictate the inter
ests of the [Europeans]," Tuninetti
said.
"While the United States remains
a world power, it should let other
countries pursue their own goals,"
Underwood added.
