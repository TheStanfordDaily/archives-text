## Morningstar argues for Eurasian energy 
### ERIN INMAN 
Richard Morningstar, the U.S.
Secretary of State's special envoy for
Eurasian energy, spoke Friday on a
panel for the Stanford U.S.-Russia
Forum about the political and eco
nomic conflicts surrounding gas
pipelines in Eurasia.
"Most importantly, we want to
constructively engage with Russia on
energy," Morningstar said when out
lining the United States' present pol
icy toward Russia in the "energy
era."
Morningstar spoke at the panel
Friday with Stanford professor Coit
Blacker, the director of the Freeman
Spogli Institute for International
Studies, and Jan Kalicki of Chevron.
Morningstar said the United
States' Eurasian energy policy was
formerly "Nabucco-centric," sup
porting the Nabucco pipeline that
would transfer natural gas from

Turkey to Austria and bypass Russia
entirely, raising questions about the
federation's influence in the region.
Russia, meanwhile, has been a
major proponent of the projected
South Stream pipeline. Seen as a
competitor to the Nabucco pipeline,
it would transport gas from Russia
into Europe, following a similar
route to the Nabucco through Eura
sia.
The United States has since aban
doned its former Nabucco-centric
outlook in favor of a more balanced
Eurasian energy strategy.
"We are not interested in zero
sum games anywhere," Morningstar
said.
He recognized the need for con
structive solutions to Eurasian ener
gy conflicts and cited interconnec
tions through transnational pipelines
as one such solution.
