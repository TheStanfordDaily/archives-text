# OPINIONS
## EDITORIAL FutureFest makes great strides for sustainability 
### 
This past Saturday, a wide variety of peo
ple and organizations, from Engineers
for a Sustainable Stanford to NAACP,
came together for one common goal: the
need for interdisciplinary, collective action to
face the challenges that threaten our future.
Over four hundred people participated in
the day-long event, which included musical
and dance performances, a sustainable fash
ion show, poetry, a speech by Van Jones and a
concert by De La Soul. FutureFest was much
more than a hippie green festival. It was not
heavily politicized with conservation organi
zations or pictures of fuzzy polar bears. It was
a festival about far-reaching, holistic solu
tions to the world's future challenges.
While a lot of the content displayed at the
booths was environmental in nature, those in
attendance would not venture to say that the
purpose of the event was simply environ
mental. It was about sustainability, in every
sense of the word about exploring sus
tainable solutions for social, economic and
environmental challenges facing our future.
The event was organized by Students for a
Sustainable Stanford (SSS) with dozens of
co-sponsors. It featured booths on water,
waste, energy and sustainable food. The last
booth was the "vision" room, where atten
dants were encouraged to share their vision
for the future and make a pledge they called
"Taking the First Step." In this statement of
the Stanford Community Agreement, partic
ipants pledged to seek and create an educa

tional structure that prepares current and fu
ture students to tackle the problems facing
the Stanford community in the future, and to
catalyze innovation in different fields to co
create a sustainable Stanford. The event in
vited students, administrators, faculty, staff
and community members alike to unite skill
sets, interests and resources to reach com
mon goals to improve the University and the
world.
The keynote speech was delivered by Van
Jones, an environmental and human rights
activist and a former green jobs advisor for
the Obama administration in 2009. Jones
called on Stanford students to take advan
tage of their immense opportunities while
living in a hotspot of green technology. He
emphasized that the struggle for sustainabil
ity is not just an environmental one, but one
of justice. Jones claimed to have attended a
"radical school" as a child, one in which he
pledged allegiance to "liberty and justice for
all." He called for the fair democratization of
natural resources and job opportunities. He
spoke of "equal protection in the age of cli
mate change" and of the immense potential
of green jobs in refueling our economy.
The Editorial Board wishes to praise SSS
and GAIA for their great efforts in organiz
ing such an inclusive and interdisciplinary
event. We hope it sets an example for future
coalitions amongst groups and researchers
alike, aiming to unite efforts on common in
terests pertinent to the whole community.
