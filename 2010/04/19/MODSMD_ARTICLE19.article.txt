# THE

## An Interdisciplinary Future 
### Shelley Gao 
There has been a trend towards advanc
ing interdisciplinary approaches in
modern academia. Stanford prides it
self on the strength of its teaching and re
search transcending disciplinary boundaries.
We can choose between more than 50 inter
disciplinary degree programs, ranging from
public policy to human biology. In addition,
there are a dozen laboratories, institutes and
centers dedicated to interdisciplinary re
search, like the Freeman Spogli Institute for
International Studies and the Woods Insti
tute for the Environment.
This shift is occurring not only in the hu
manities (English, philosophy, history) and
social sciences (sociology, political science,
economics), but also in the natural sciences.
In January, the National Institute of Health
outlined a research agenda that emphasizes
the importance of collaboration among scien
tists from different disciplines as a foundation
for the future success of biomedical research.
Last year, Mark C. Taylor, a professor of
religion at Columbia University, published a
controversial op-ed entitled "End the Uni
versity as We Know It" in The New York
Times in which he called for a radical restruc
turing of American higher education. After
providing a bleak assessment of the fate of
graduate students in non-professional
schools no job, irrelevant skills, large debt
Taylor recommended replacing perma
nent departments, responsible for producing
"narrow scholarship," with "problem-fo
cused programs." Topics like water, law and
money could serve as "zones of inquiry." The
university curriculum should aim toward
combining various approaches to form prag
matic solutions to the world's problems.
This proposal seems rather drastic, and
undervalues the importance of disciplinary
strength in informing interdisciplinary stud
ies. Indeed, the existence of interdisciplinary
programs is based on the flourish of individ
ual disciplines. Each academic field provides
important frameworks to understand the
world, techniques to conduct research and
the expertise that is necessary to fuel the
growth of interdisciplinary approaches. But,
Taylor's proposal does effectively highlight
the increasing relevance of practical applica
tion in today's education.
Interdisciplinary studies provide better
training to deal with the "real world." Fields
like business, government and non-profits re
quire critical thinking based on various per
spectives, models and theories. Contempo
rary problems cannot be solved within any
single area of study. The complexity of chal
lenges like global warming, national security,
nuclear non-proliferation and global health
require innovative and practical solutions
that employ tools and knowledge across a
wide range of fields.
Some critics, however, consider this focus
on breadth rather than depth as lacking in in
tellectual rigor. During the era of university

budget cuts, there is debate regarding
whether resources should be allocated to de
partments based on traditional disciplines or
directed to "institutes" supporting interdisci
plinary work.
The tendency for fragmentation is a valid
point of contention. While most interdiscipli
nary programs require the formulation of a
coherent and integrated study plan, there is a
tendency for students to sample courses
across two or three departments without de
veloping expertise in any. The lack of immer
sion in a particular field makes compete mas
tery of core concepts and methodology un
likely. Without specialization, it is difficult to
produce cutting edge research or set new in
tellectual boundaries.
At Stanford, pursuing interdisciplinary
studies allows for the flexibility to cultivate
solid grounding in a discipline, particularly
through opportunities like independent re
search or an honors thesis. In addition, there
is value in gaining exposure to different
methodological approaches. Overcoming the
tensions among the different methods and
paradigms championed by each discipline
can be an interesting process. Having recent
ly switched from majoring in history to inter
national relations due to expediency and in
terest, I realized that crossing the discipline
boundary is not so easy.
There is a natural proclivity to bias what is
familiar over the unknown. During the first
few weeks, I clung to a historian's intuition,
utterly bewildered by all this business to do
with hypothesis, variables and causal logic.
Instead of looking at cross tabulations of
data and conducting statistical analysis, all I
wanted to do was bury myself in archival doc
uments and get a "feel" for the situation.
After some struggle, I began to appreciate
and integrate the other methods used to
grapple with the uncertainty of reality. As
someone who is rather fond of the Great
Man Theory, and has previously derided my
political science friends' love of models, the
transition to accepting and practicing a social
scientist's mode of inquiry has proved to be
challenging but valuable in many ways.
Now that bringing together specific fields
has become a fixture in the modern universi
ty, perhaps the future will involve attempts to
create synthesis and bridge the broader gap
between different branches of knowledge.
