# UNFASHIONABLE NONSENSE
## A
						Brief Meditation on the Meaning of Life, i.e., Why Napping is Virtuous 
### Emily Hulme 
rerry Eagleton puts it well: the question,
"what is the meaning of life? " is a "mo
mentous question" that happens to be
"inescapably funny." It is funny, of course, be
cause it's totally absurd right from the start.
Even the assumption that there could be an
answer is absurd. After all, every life is a spe
cial snowflake influenced by never-again-to
be-repeated passions, decisions, revisions
and regrets. It even seems possible that if two
people lived the same life, they could come to
the same juncture and diverge right there,
one turning left and the other turning right,
for no reason besides the very fact they are
two different people. When L.C. decided not
to go to Paris in order to stay with Justin dur
ing the finale of The Hills, it seemed just as
possible that she could have gone the other
route. Each of us faces a million decisions,
some consciously taxing and others simply
routine, and leads an individual life, entirely

distinct from our peers living next door and
down the hall, and even more distinct from
other members of our species living across
the globe. It would be absurd to assume these
lives could all boil down to a single meaning.
Yet we throw ourselves against the ques
tion anyways.
Perhaps it is not so absurd. Maybe the
similarities outweigh the differences, and the
other members of our species are also our
brothers. We all have two hands and one
heart, and maybe the differences all boil
down to instrumental errors that vanish after
appropriate rounding. So, to look for the uni
versal meaning of life requires looking at
what is left after the boiling.
Among the bones, I have discovered a few
potential starts toward answering this ques
tion. Today, I shall address only one: the uni
versal human appreciation for napping.
Modern people, namely, my people, gen

erally assume rest, a la Sabbath, is an old and,
more importantly, outdated tradition. After
all, we no longer have time to rest, seeing as
we have work/reading/four-year
planning/iPhones/YouTube clips of otters
holding hands. But, seriously, we don't have
time to rest in this fast-paced world of ours
in fact, we don't even have time to walk,
which is why the Segway is so popular. In the
agrarian culture of yesteryear, of course, peo-
