# UNFASHIONABLE NONSENSE
## A 						Brief Meditation on the Meaning of Life, i.e., Why Napping is Virtuous 
### Emily Hulme 
rerry Eagleton puts it well: the question,
"what is the meaning of life? " is a "mo
mentous question" that happens to be
"inescapably funny." It is funny, of course, be
cause it's totally absurd right from the start.
Even the assumption that there could be an
answer is absurd. After all, every life is a spe
cial snowflake influenced by never-again-to
be-repeated passions, decisions, revisions
and regrets. It even seems possible that if two
people lived the same life, they could come to
the same juncture and diverge right there,
one turning left and the other turning right,
for no reason besides the very fact they are
two different people. When L.C. decided not
to go to Paris in order to stay with Justin dur
ing the finale of The Hills, it seemed just as
possible that she could have gone the other
route. Each of us faces a million decisions,
some consciously taxing and others simply
routine, and leads an individual life, entirely

distinct from our peers living next door and
down the hall, and even more distinct from
other members of our species living across
the globe. It would be absurd to assume these
lives could all boil down to a single meaning.
Yet we throw ourselves against the ques
tion anyways.
Perhaps it is not so absurd. Maybe the
similarities outweigh the differences, and the
other members of our species are also our
brothers. We all have two hands and one
heart, and maybe the differences all boil
down to instrumental errors that vanish after
appropriate rounding. So, to look for the uni
versal meaning of life requires looking at
what is left after the boiling.
Among the bones, I have discovered a few
potential starts toward answering this ques
tion. Today, I shall address only one: the uni
versal human appreciation for napping.
Modern people, namely, my people, gen

erally assume rest, a la Sabbath, is an old and,
more importantly, outdated tradition. After
all, we no longer have time to rest, seeing as
we have work/reading/four-year
planning/iPhones/YouTube clips of otters
holding hands. But, seriously, we don't have
time to rest in this fast-paced world of ours
in fact, we don't even have time to walk,
which is why the Segway is so popular. In the
agrarian culture of yesteryear, of course, peo-

pie had time to rest. They just asked
the pests and weeds to take the day
off, and, following their contractual
agreement, the pests and weeds
complied.
I suspect the reason we reject rest
as a valid use of time is because it
doesn't really fit into the central
pathology of our culture: work
and/or material gains are indicative
of our value as human beings.
Whether or not we operate as if we
know the meanings of our lives, we
follow a de facto philosophy, and the
de facto philosophy du jour is that
money and work create our value as
individuals. But, after a moment's re
flection, I think it is fairly clear that
we don't want to actually believe this.

It's a common refrain that Stan
ford students are bred to pursue op
portunities that will become resume
points. But I don't think any Stan
ford student, or Yale student, or real
ly any person ever, anywhere, thinks,
"Hey! That's me! I really do think
the be-all end-all is my resume!" In
stead, we're meant to identify with
the jaded critic who is involved in
things he or she cares about sincere
ly. And "sincerity," by definition, isn't
really quantifiable. It certainly im

plies, though, that our critic would
stay involved with the Stanford Albi
no Harbor Seal Rescue Program
whether or not it led to a resume bul
let point, and thus material gain in
the future.

This, for me, is evidence that we
are not happy with material gain as
the meaning of life. Centering your
life around work and money is at
tractive insofar as it allows your self
defined center to remain seemingly
in your control. Especially at a
school like Stanford, it certainly
would seem that you really do have
all the opportunities for getting a
great job and achieving financial
success at your disposal, if only you
would reach out and take them.

But, by my lights, not only do we
suspect money is not all there is,
making the central objective unwor
thy, but we learn by experience that
it is patently false that we can control
everything. So, getting back to my
starting point: no, I don't think nap
ping is the meaning of life. But it's
not money either, and maybe we can
get closer to what it is by learning to
let go a little bit, and even by realiz
ing that the world will go on whether
you are checking your e-mail every
15 seconds or snoozing on the Oval.

Thanks to Paul Taylor for sending my
scattered thoughts in this direction.
