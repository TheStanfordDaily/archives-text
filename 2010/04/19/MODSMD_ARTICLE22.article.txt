## Understanding diversity 
### STEVEN TRAVIS REISINGER'10 
Diversity has become the euphemism of
social justice for the elite on the global
scale. Real diversity, and thus real vari
ety, would dissolve the very existence of the
meaning of elitism. It would be defined by the
inclusiveness of the abnormal, and other under
represented and uncounted minorities into the
general population of this university. It would
be not just the intelligent (however that is de
fined), but also the unintelligent. Not just the
functional, but also the dysfunctional. Not just
the abled, but the disabled. Not just the tolerant,
but the intolerant. Not just the intellectual, but
the anti-intellectual. And it would not just be
these polar opposites, but everything in be
tween. As it stands today, diversity is about so

cial justice for "equals" within their respective
classes. Thus activism for diversity has been for
maintaining the traditional social stratification
and disparity of power by consolidating interac
tive systems of people and balancing the coun
terparts of each system.
The problem with this is that real diversity
only connotes variety. Diversity in today's terms
is about achieving a racial and ethnic balance
within each strata of social class. To illustrate this
point, it is akin to the infinite mirror effect. The
goal of diversity is to stabilize a percentage that
corresponds to the general population (e.g. 10
percent black) within all levels of social stratifi
cation (wealthy, upper middle class, middle
class, working class, poor) so that race has no

bearing on socioeconomic status. But real diver
sity would be seen more like chaos and random
ness than the consistent pattern that the infinite
recursion would show in the macro viewing.
If this is the case, then the activists for diver
sity are not fighting for real diversity and neither
are they fighting for true social justice. What
they are really fighting for is a seat for them
selves and thus their respective group at
the table of the elites. This entails maintaining
and "improving" the traditional hierarchy and
boundaries of the meritocratic classes to make
outcomes more "fair" for deserving equals. But
