# LETTER TO THE EDITOR

Dear Editor,
Regarding your April 14th edito
rial, "Sensationalism, distortions
cloud marijuana debate" the drug
war is largely a war on marijuana
smokers. In 2008, there were 847,863
marijuana arrests in the U.S., almost
90 percent for simple possession. At
a time when state and local govern
ments are laying off police, firefight
ers and teachers, this country contin
ues to spend enormous public re
sources criminalizing Americans
who prefer marijuana to martinis.
The end result of this ongoing cul
ture war is not necessarily lower
rates of use.
The U.S. has higher rates of mari
juana use than the Netherlands, where
marijuana is legally available. An ad

mitted former pot smoker, President
Obama has thus far maintained the
prohibition status quo rather than
pursue real change. Would Barack
Obama be in White House right now if
he had been convicted of a marijuana
offense in his youth?
Decriminalization is a long over
due step in the right direction. Taxing
and regulating marijuana would ren
der the drug war obsolete. As long as
marijuana distribution is controlled
by organized crime, consumers will
continue to come into contact with
sellers of hard drugs like meth and
heroin. This "gateway" is a direct re
sult of marijuana prohibition.
