## CONFERENCE CHAMPS 
### CAROLINE CASELLI DESK EDITOR 
For the first time since 1997, the No. 1 Stanford men's volley
ball team secured the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation
(MPSF) title. The Card split two heart-wrenching five-set match
es, faltering on Friday, but coming back for a crucial victory on Sat
urday.
Playing at Pauley Pavilion in Los Angeles, the Card (19-6,16-6
MPSF) took on No. 7 UCLA (16-13,11-11) on Friday night.
In the first set, the Cardinal and Bruins battled point for point,
the score remaining within two until 23-21. Despite a late ace from
junior outside hitter Spencer McLachlin and a pair of kills from
senior opposite Evan Romero, the Bruins pulled away to win the
set 30-24.
The second and third sets each went in the Card's favor from
the opening points. McLachlin and sophomore outside hitter
Brad Lawson powered Stanford to set wins of 30-23, then 30-21.
However, momentum swung back in the Bruins' favor in the
fourth set with an early 4-0 UCLA lead and an eventual 30-26 vic
tory.
UCLA proved too much for Stanford to handle in the fifth set.
The Bruins jumped out to a quick 7-1 lead, and subsequent serv
ice and hitting errors prevented the Card from making a come
back. The Card dropped the set, and match, 15-7.
"Throughout the match everyone served the ball poorly, and
then we came out flat in the fifth game," said senior setter Kawika
Shoji. "It was a poor effort by all of us."
Romero, Lawson and McLachlin all had kills in the double dig
its, with 19,17 and 13, respectively. Kawika Shoji had 54 assists and
14 digs, and his younger brother, sophomore libero Erik Shoji, dug
another 15 balls. Stanford's serving was subpar, with 23 errors and
just one ace.
For the Bruins, senior outside hitter Garrett Muagututia led
the offense and defense with 23 kills and 13 digs. Sophomore mid
dle blocker Thomas Amberg added 13 kills on .462 hitting, and
redshirt sophomore opposite Jack Polales contributed 12 kills and
four blocks. Senior setter Kevin Ker recorded 61 assists.
On Saturday, the Card looked to recover from the previous
night with a win over No. 8 UC-Irvine (15-14,10-12) in its final reg
ular season conference match.
"We decided to drop the UCLA match from our heads on Sat
urday morning," Kawika Shoji said. "We had a team meeting and
addressed some of our mistakes from the previous night and
moved forward with a positive attitude."
The positive attitude proved effective, with the Card winning
the match in five sets, 30-21,27-30,30-28,24-30,15-6.
A pair of blocks from Lawson and sophomore middle blocker
Gus Ellis combined with kills from senior middle blocker Garrett
Werner, Romero and McLachlin helped the Card to an early 14-9
first-set lead. Stanford continued to outhit its opponent and won
the first set, 30-21.
The teams exchanged the next three sets, with the Anteaters
winning the second and fourth, and Stanford taking the third. For
the second night in the row, the match came down to the short, 15-
point fifth set.
But in contrast to the night before, the Cardinal took control of
the fifth set from the get-go. Lawson served seven consecutive
times, including two aces, to bring the Card to a 9-2 lead. Kills from
Ellis, Werner and Lawson in addition to multiple Irvine errors
helped Stanford take the final set, 15-6.
