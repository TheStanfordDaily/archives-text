# No love for the NFL Draft
## 
### Daniel Bohm 
The NFL Draft begins Thurs
day, and although no fan is
quite sure who his team will
pick, there are a few certain
ties for the weekend.
First, fans of 31 teams will vow that it
is this draft that puts their team over the
top.
Second, New York Jets fans will boo
their pick and vow that it is t!us draft that
puts their team back a decade.
Third, there will be entirely too much
talk about a player that will likely
amount to nothing in the NFL Tim
Tebow. In fact, I was completely conflict
ed about even bringing him up because
now I can be labeled one of those sports
writers.
And finally, come Monday there will
be lots of talk about which team had the
best draft and which team blew it, and ul
timately, it will amount to one of the
most overrated, overhyped events in
sports.
Pop quiz: who was your favorite
baseball team's first round draft pick last
year? Or your favorite hockey team's?
You probably don't know. Maybe you
know your favorite basketball team's
first round pick because team rosters are
so small, but nonetheless, none of these
drafts get near the hype of the NFL
draft.
Why? To be honest, I'm not sure.
Maybe it is America's love of college
football, maybe it is just away for foot
ball fans to feel like the season is forth
coming despite the long summer or
maybe it is just a contrived media event
to create revenue I'm not sure.
No matter what the reason, the mis
guided excitement is still there. There
will be endless speculation this week
about who is the best offensive tackle or
safety available in the draft, and while
fans may know the prospects now, come
football season, most average fans won't

know the names of their team's offen
sive linemen or defensive backs.

Fans will argue to boot who is the
better offensive tackle prospect: Okla
homa State's Russell Okung or lowa's
Bryan Bulaga. It's a ridiculous conver
sation because few fans have ever seen
either player play outside of the clips
shown on ESPN with a Mel Kiper, Jr.
voiceover. Furthermore, how many fans
really know how to evaluate an offen
sive tackle's performance and pro
jectability? (Note:"Projectability"is not
a real word. It is a word that has been
created for events such as the NFL
Draft).

I'm a diehard Kansas City Chiefs
fan, and I remember that the Chiefs sup
posedly had the best 2008 draft behind
two first round picks: defensive tackle
Glenn Dorsey and offensive tackle
Branden Albert. Those two were sup
posed to change the Chiefs' fortunes.
Well guess what? The Chiefs are still ter
rible. Dorsey is largely considered a
bust, and although Albert is a solid con
tributor, he is by no means the star that
he was projected to be. It turns out the

best pick the Chiefs made in that draft
was third-rounder Jamaal Charles, a
pick that wasn't talked about at all on
draft day or soon thereafter.
And you don't have to look further
than the Bay Area to see the overhyping
of the NFL Draft. Just consider the last
times the 49ers and Raiders had the No.
1 overall pick. San Francisco selected
Alex Smith, Oakland got JaMarcus
Russell. It doesn't take an expert to as
sess how those picks worked out. At the
time, however, they were seen as fran
chise-changers.
Then there is Tim Tebow. Fie is the
best evidence that the NFL Draft is a

contrived media event. He was a great
college player, but most everyone
agrees he doesn't project to be much of
an NFLer. Yet Sports Center dedicates

segments to him and his "new throwing
motion," more articles are written about
him than projected No. 1 overall pick
Sam Bradford and lastly, and most
ridiculously, the NFL invited him to at
tend the draft, even though he probably
won't be picked on the first day! It's as if
the media will milk everything they can
out of him before he inevitably flames
out in the pros.
This is the part of the article where I
would normally make my mock draft, be
cause that is fun for us sportswriters to do
—but I will refrain because that would be
blasphemous after this article, no?

Tim Tebow never accepted Daniel
Bohm's friend request, and there has
been ill will ever since. Initiate the heal
ing process at bohmd@stanford.edu.
