# No love for the NFL Draft
## 
### Daniel Bohm 
The NFL Draft begins Thurs
day, and although no fan is
quite sure who his team will
pick, there are a few certain
ties for the weekend.
First, fans of 31 teams will vow that it
is this draft that puts their team over the

will be endless speculation this week
about who is the best offensive tackle or
safety available in the draft, and while
fans may know the prospects now, come
