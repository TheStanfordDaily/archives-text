## Wildcats extend Softball slump Gerhart's absence paves way for Arizona sweep 
### DANIEL BOHM SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford Softball has had better
weekends.

In its first chance to get revenge
against No. 4 Arizona since last
year's Super Regionals, Stanford fell
flat in Tucson, getting swept by the
host Wildcats over the weekend.
Last season, the Wildcats eliminated
the Cardinal in the Super Regionals
with a trip to the Women's College
World Series on the line.

The No. 8 Cardinal (30-9, 4-5)
may have lost more than a Pac-10
Conference series this weekend.
Freshman pitcher Teagan Gerhart
left her start on Friday after just 2.2
innings and did not pitch again all
weekend. It is unclear if Gerhart is
injured or if her arm is just tired. She
will be re-evaluated this week,
though she did pinch run in Sun
day's loss.

Gerhart has been a star for the
Cardinal all season. She is 22-6 with
a miniscule 1.67 ERA in her first
season on the Farm.

With Gerhart out, junior Ashley
Chinn, who came into the season ex
pecting to compete for the first spot
in the rotation, made her return to
the circle. Chinn hadn't pitched
since March 23, as she has been
working on problems with her me
chanics. This weekend, Chinn
pitched in all three games, going a
total of 10.2 innings and giving up
seven runs. She took losses on both
Saturday and Sunday.
Last year, the Cardinal took the
first game of the Stanford Super Re
gional before losing two consecutive
games to the Wildcats, effectively

ending Stanford's season.
Arizona (35-7,5-4) used its usual
formula of out-slugging its oppo
nents to beat the Cardinal this
weekend.
A day after squeaking out a 3-2
win on Friday behind third baseman
Brigette Del Ponte's two-run
homer, the Wildcats embarrassed
the Cardinal Saturday, winning 10-2
in six innings.
Three Arizona players went
deep in the win. Catcher Stacie
Chambers who led the nation in
homers last season took Chinn
deep to lead off the bottom of the
third and give the Wildcats a 3-0
lead.
An inning later, Wildcat short
stop K'Lee Arredondo chased
Chinn with a one-out, three-run
shot of her own to break the game
open.
For the game, Chinn (6-3) went
just 3.1 innings, allowing six runs on
seven hits and four walks.
Pitcher Kenzie Fowler (23-5) got
the win for Arizona, going the dis
tance and allowing just two runs on
two hits and three walks.
Maybe the most impressive part
about Fowler who also got the
complete game victory Friday is
that she kept Stanford's three-time
All-American senior and left fielder
Alissa Haber hitless for consecutive
days. It was the first time all season
Haber went two games in a row
without a hit, and only the fifth and
six times she has gone hitless all
year.
Arizona's offensive explosion
was not much of a surprise. Year in
and year out, the Wildcats are at or
near the top of the league in home
runs and runs scored, and they are
especially difficult to stop in Tucson.
Sunday was no different, as the
Wildcats capitalized on three Cardi
