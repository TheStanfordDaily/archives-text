# Offense takes out OSU
## Baseball earns first Pac-10 sweep on the road against Oregon State 
### KABIR SAWHNEY DESK EDITOR 
A rough home series against Oregon last
weekend saw Stanford's baseball team lose its
top 25 ranking, but the team came roaring back
on the road against Oregon State. The Cardinal
(18-13,7-5 Pac-10) got its first Pac-10 sweep of the
year as it summarily dismantled the No. 17
Beavers (20-11,3-6).
The Cardinal offense was especially impres
sive, scoring a total of 29 runs in three games off
Oregon State's vaunted pitching staff. Entering
the series, Oregon State had a team ERA of 2.97,
a number that jumped to 3.56 after Sunday's
game.
The first game of the series, a 14-6 win for Stan
ford on Friday, saw Cardinal hitters dominate the
Oregon State pitching staff. Beaver starter Greg
Peavey, the staff's top pitcher, gave up five runs in
6.1 innings, while striking out four. Overall, Ore
gon State used five pitchers, but its relief staff was
ineffective the Cardinal won the game on the
back of two five-run rallies in the seventh and
eighth innings.
Junior shortstop Jake Schlander, who had
struggled in the Oregon series, was critical to
Stanford's success. He went 3-5 with six RBIs and
hit his third home run of the season. Junior first
baseman Jonathan Kaskow also hit well, going 2-
4, with three runs scored and four RBIs.
Oregon State's offense was also effectively
shut down by Stanford's pitchers, outside of a six
run outburst in the fifth inning. Sophomore left
hander Brett Mooneyham started the game and
gave up six runs on four hits before being taken
out in the fifth. While his performance dropped
off somewhat from his last start against Oregon,
where he held the Ducks to no runs in eight in
nings, it proved to be enough for the Cardinal.
The Stanford bullpen pitched remarkably
well, holding Oregon State hitters to just one hit
over the final 4.1 innings. Freshman Mark Appel
pitched the final three innings to pick up the save.
The second game of the series was a much
closer contest, with the Cardinal pulling out a 5-3
win in 10 innings. Stanford relied on a combina
tion of strong pitching and clutch hitting to secure
