# Offense takes out OSU
## Baseball earns first Pac-10 sweep on the road against Oregon State 
### KABIR SAWHNEY DESK EDITOR 
A rough home series against Oregon last
weekend saw Stanford's baseball team lose its
top 25 ranking, but the team came roaring back
on the road against Oregon State. The Cardinal
(18-13,7-5 Pac-10) got its first Pac-10 sweep of the
year as it summarily dismantled the No. 17
Beavers (20-11,3-6).
The Cardinal offense was especially impres
sive, scoring a total of 29 runs in three games off
Oregon State's vaunted pitching staff. Entering
the series, Oregon State had a team ERA of 2.97,
a number that jumped to 3.56 after Sunday's
game.
The first game of the series, a 14-6 win for Stan
ford on Friday, saw Cardinal hitters dominate the
Oregon State pitching staff. Beaver starter Greg
Peavey, the staff's top pitcher, gave up five runs in
6.1 innings, while striking out four. Overall, Ore
gon State used five pitchers, but its relief staff was
ineffective the Cardinal won the game on the
back of two five-run rallies in the seventh and
eighth innings.
Junior shortstop Jake Schlander, who had
struggled in the Oregon series, was critical to
Stanford's success. He went 3-5 with six RBIs and
hit his third home run of the season. Junior first
baseman Jonathan Kaskow also hit well, going 2-
4, with three runs scored and four RBIs.
Oregon State's offense was also effectively
shut down by Stanford's pitchers, outside of a six
run outburst in the fifth inning. Sophomore left
hander Brett Mooneyham started the game and
gave up six runs on four hits before being taken
out in the fifth. While his performance dropped
off somewhat from his last start against Oregon,
where he held the Ducks to no runs in eight in
nings, it proved to be enough for the Cardinal.
The Stanford bullpen pitched remarkably
well, holding Oregon State hitters to just one hit
over the final 4.1 innings. Freshman Mark Appel
pitched the final three innings to pick up the save.
The second game of the series was a much
closer contest, with the Cardinal pulling out a 5-3
win in 10 innings. Stanford relied on a combina
tion of strong pitching and clutch hitting to secure

Junior second baseman Colin Walsh had a standout offensive performance in Saturday's extra-inning victory
against Oregon State, hitting a two-run home run in the 10th inning to secure the game, and series, win.
the series win.
Junior second baseman Colin
Walsh was Stanford's offensive star.
His two-run home run in the 10th
gave Stanford the advantage in extra
innings. He also had two RBIs in reg
ulation, which narrowed the gap be
tween the Cardinal and the Beavers
after Oregon State took an early
lead in the third inning.
Freshman right fielder Tyler
Gaffney was also critical, getting an
RBI to tie the game in the seventh
inning.
For the Beavers, the bullpen
proved to be their Achilles' heel for
the second straight game. Starting
pitcher Tanner Robles gave up three
runs in 7.1 innings before turning it
over to reliever Tyler Waldron.
Though Waldron was able to hold
the Cardinal through the last two in
nings of regulation, he gave up the
home run to Walsh and took the loss
in the game.
Conversely, Stanford's relievers
shut down the Oregon State offense
late in the game once again. After
sophomore starter Jordan Pries gave
up three runs in 7.1 innings, sopho
more Scott Snodgress and junior
Alex Pracher pitched a combined 2.2
innings, giving up no hits and one
walk to the Beavers.
The teams found themselves in a
role reversal of sorts in the final
game of the series on Sunday. This
time, the Cardinal jumped out to an
early lead, scoring three and six runs
in the second and third innings, re
spectively, to take a 9-1 lead. Though
the Beavers tried to rally late, its of

fense fell short and gave Stanford
the 10-7 victory.
Stanford's offense was able to de
liver victory once more, with differ
ent players making big impacts. This
time, freshman center fielder Jake
Stewart was the offense's dynamo,
with four RBIs in the game. Sch
lander and freshman designated hit

ter Eric Smith were also strong, with
two RBIs each.
Unlike in the first two games of
the series, starting pitching proved to
be the Beavers' weak point.The line
up tore through Oregon State starter
Sam Gaviglio, who entered the game
with a 2.00 ERA. However, this was
only his third start of the season.
Gaviglio was removed after just 2.2
innings, having given up nine runs to
the Cardinal.
The four pitchers used after Gav
iglio proved to be effective, mostly
shutting down the Stanford lineup
for the last six innings of the game.
The Cardinal's offensive show
compensated for the pitching staff's
performance, which was not quite as
strong as in the first two games of the
series. Sophomore starter Brian Bu
sick gave up only two runs in six in
nings, but freshmen relievers Dean
McArdle and Appel gave up five
runs over the last three innings of the
game.
This series vastly improves Stan
ford's position in the Pac-10. After
starting the weekend tied for sev
enth in the conference, the Cardinal
is now tied with Arizona for third
place behind California and Arizona
State.
Meanwhile, the Beavers, who
started the weekend tied for third,
are now in an eighth-place tie with
Washington State.
The Cardinal is now on a five
game winning streak, and will look
to keep up its momentum heading
into a four-game homestand. Stan
ford will play Santa Clara on Tues
day before opening a three-game
conference series against Cal on Fri
day.

where he held the Ducks to no runs in eight in
nings, it proved to be enough for the Cardinal.
The Stanford bullpen pitched remarkably
well, holding Oregon State hitters to just one hit
over the final 4.1 innings. Freshman Mark Appel
pitched the final three innings to pick up the save.
The second game of the series was a much
closer contest, with the Cardinal pulling out a 5-3
win in 10 innings. Stanford relied on a combina
tion of strong pitching and clutch hitting to secure

Junior second baseman Colin Walsh had a standout offensive performance in Saturday's extra-inning victory
against Oregon State, hitting a two-run home run in the 10th inning to secure the game, and series, win.
the series win.
Junior second baseman Colin
Walsh was Stanford's offensive star.
His two-run home run in the 10th
gave Stanford the advantage in extra
innings. He also had two RBIs in reg
ulation, which narrowed the gap be
tween the Cardinal and the Beavers
after Oregon State took an early
lead in the third inning.
Freshman right fielder Tyler
Gaffney was also critical, getting an
RBI to tie the game in the seventh
inning.
For the Beavers, the bullpen
proved to be their Achilles' heel for
the second straight game. Starting
pitcher Tanner Robles gave up three
runs in 7.1 innings before turning it
over to reliever Tyler Waldron.
Though Waldron was able to hold
the Cardinal through the last two in
nings of regulation, he gave up the
home run to Walsh and took the loss
in the game.
Conversely, Stanford's relievers
shut down the Oregon State offense
late in the game once again. After
sophomore starter Jordan Pries gave
up three runs in 7.1 innings, sopho
more Scott Snodgress and junior
Alex Pracher pitched a combined 2.2
innings, giving up no hits and one
walk to the Beavers.
The teams found themselves in a
role reversal of sorts in the final
game of the series on Sunday. This
time, the Cardinal jumped out to an
early lead, scoring three and six runs
in the second and third innings, re
spectively, to take a 9-1 lead. Though
the Beavers tried to rally late, its of

fense fell short and gave Stanford
the 10-7 victory.
Stanford's offense was able to de
liver victory once more, with differ
ent players making big impacts. This
time, freshman center fielder Jake
Stewart was the offense's dynamo,
with four RBIs in the game. Sch
lander and freshman designated hit

ter Eric Smith were also strong, with
two RBIs each.
Unlike in the first two games of
the series, starting pitching proved to
be the Beavers' weak point.The line
up tore through Oregon State starter
Sam Gaviglio, who entered the game
with a 2.00 ERA. However, this was
only his third start of the season.
Gaviglio was removed after just 2.2
innings, having given up nine runs to
the Cardinal.
The four pitchers used after Gav
iglio proved to be effective, mostly
shutting down the Stanford lineup
for the last six innings of the game.
The Cardinal's offensive show
compensated for the pitching staff's
performance, which was not quite as
strong as in the first two games of the
series. Sophomore starter Brian Bu
sick gave up only two runs in six in
nings, but freshmen relievers Dean
McArdle and Appel gave up five
runs over the last three innings of the
game.
This series vastly improves Stan
ford's position in the Pac-10. After
starting the weekend tied for sev
enth in the conference, the Cardinal
is now tied with Arizona for third
place behind California and Arizona
State.
Meanwhile, the Beavers, who
started the weekend tied for third,
are now in an eighth-place tie with
Washington State.
The Cardinal is now on a five
game winning streak, and will look
to keep up its momentum heading
into a four-game homestand. Stan
ford will play Santa Clara on Tues
day before opening a three-game
conference series against Cal on Fri
day.

A rough home series against Oregon last
weekend saw Stanford's baseball team lose its
top 25 ranking, but the team came roaring back
on the road against Oregon State. The Cardinal
(18-13,7-5 Pac-10) got its first Pac-10 sweep of the
year as it summarily dismantled the No. 17
Beavers (20-11,3-6).
The Cardinal offense was especially impres
sive, scoring a total of 29 runs in three games off
Oregon State's vaunted pitching staff. Entering
the series, Oregon State had a team ERA of 2.97,
a number that jumped to 3.56 after Sunday's
game.
The first game of the series, a 14-6 win for Stan
ford on Friday, saw Cardinal hitters dominate the
Oregon State pitching staff. Beaver starter Greg
Peavey, the staff's top pitcher, gave up five runs in
6.1 innings, while striking out four. Overall, Ore
gon State used five pitchers, but its relief staff was
ineffective the Cardinal won the game on the
back of two five-run rallies in the seventh and
eighth innings.
Junior shortstop Jake Schlander, who had
struggled in the Oregon series, was critical to
Stanford's success. He went 3-5 with six RBIs and
hit his third home run of the season. Junior first
baseman Jonathan Kaskow also hit well, going 2-
4, with three runs scored and four RBIs.
Oregon State's offense was also effectively
shut down by Stanford's pitchers, outside of a six
run outburst in the fifth inning. Sophomore left
hander Brett Mooneyham started the game and
gave up six runs on four hits before being taken
out in the fifth. While his performance dropped
off somewhat from his last start against Oregon,
where he held the Ducks to no runs in eight in
nings, it proved to be enough for the Cardinal.
