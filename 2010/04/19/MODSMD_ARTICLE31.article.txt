# Big Splash ends in thriller
## Last minute goal helps No. 2 Card defeat rival No. 3 Bears 
### CLAUDIA LOPEZ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The No. 2 Stanford (21-1,6-0 MPSF) and No. 3 Cal
(23-6,4-3) women's water polo teams faced off at the
Avery Aquatic Center this Saturday for a thrilling
match, decided at the literal last second, with the
game-winning score from Stanford's senior two
meter Jessica Steffens.
The Big Splash stayed close from the opening sec
onds through the final goal at the close of both the
second and third periods, the score remained even at
fives and sevens, respectively. After a quick timeout call
in the final seconds by head coach John Tanner, senior
driver Kelsey Holshouser passed to Steffens, who
broke the 7-7 tie by punching a score past Cal goalie
Stephanie Peckham with one second left on the clock.
Points were scored from across the Card roster,
making the overall win a true team victory.
Junior driver Kim Krueger smashed in two goals,
while freshman two-meter Annika Dries, sophomore
two-meter Melissa Seidemann, Holshouser, senior
two-meter Alex Koran, Steffens and senior driver
Kelly Eaton each scored a single point to bring the
final score to 8-7. Junior Amber Oland had a total of
seven saves through the game as well.
With the win, the Cardinal gained its ninth straight
win and will now face off with No. 1 USC on Saturday.
"This Cal game prepared us for our game next
weekend, since it might come down to a close game,"

Eaton said. "Before our Cal game, we knew that we
were bound to have a game that came down to the
wire, since we hadn't had one all year yet. Sure
enough, this happened. I'm glad that we were able to
experience a tight game before we play in the end of
the year tournament."
Stanford's return home was a welcome change
after a road trip to Hawaii. Home or away, however,
Stanford is keeping its focus on a title.
"It is always fun to play at your own pool, but I
think we would have had the same outcome whether
we were here or there," Eaton said. "I'm sure in both
cases, there would have been a large, loud crowd, and
that pumps us up no matter what. A championship
team knows how to win at home and on the road."
The Cardinal is still undefeated in MPSF play,
while the MPSF Championship begins on April 30.
Two weeks after MPSFs, the NCAA Tournament will
begin, making the next month extremely important
for the Cardinal.
More immediately, Stanford must prepare for the
top team in the nation, USC, who swept UCLA this
weekend in a 14-5 victory. The Trojan women, now on
a 17-match winning streak, have not lost a match since
the beginning of February against the Cardinal.
Coming off a victory against longtime rival Cal, the
Card is hoping to ride its momentum into Saturday's
match, which will also be Senior Night.
"I am excited to have my Senior Night versus our
biggest rival because it is guaranteed to be a good
game," Eaton said. "Hopefully a lot of people are able
to attend."
The match will take place this Saturday at 4 p.m. at
the Avery Aquatic Center.
