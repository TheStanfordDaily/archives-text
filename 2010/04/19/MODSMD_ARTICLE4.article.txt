## 180 housing picks available to rank in Draw Students to rank residences, specific room options by May 9 
### MARIANNE LeVINE 
Following the changes brought about
by the Housing Master Plan last year, the
Draw will again undergo some changes as
students begin to rank their housing pref
erences for 2010-11, including a new fea
ture allowing students to rank which room

type they prefer.
The move gives undergraduates 180
housing options to rank by May 9.
The new draw process has brought
more positive feedback by students than
in past years, according to Rodger Whit
ney, the executive director of Student
Housing.The option to choose a preferred
room type may also help students choose
whether room type or residence location
is more important overall.
With this change, Housing will now be
able to "offer students participating in the

Draw 'premier' housing, such as single
rooms or two-room doubles or apart
ments, for two of their three upperclass
years," according to Whitney.
Many of the changes this year are a
continuation of the Housing Master Plan
implemented in 2009. Housing last sum
mer took on an "unstuffing" effort with
the opening of Munger Graduate Resi
dences, which can house 600 graduate stu
dents, and the conversion of Crothers Hall
from graduate to undergraduate housing.
Crothers currently houses 376 undergrad

uate students.
Next year, Whitney said, about 60 un
dergraduate upperclassmen could live in
the now-graduate Rains apartments, with
preference to those 21 and older. This
move initially met with resistance from
graduate students; Housing later said it
would assign undergraduates to two
buildings in Rains that were less disrup
tive to the existing graduate community
there.
He added that housing in Oak
Creek would continue to be offered.
Renovations are set to take place
during the summer months in Casa
Italiana, Bob and Storey, but will not
affect the draw process, according to
Housing.
In addition to work in these three
residences, Whitney said the Hous
ing Capital Improvement Program
is also expected to include "the re
modeling of bathrooms, addition of
sprinklers and refreshing of student
rooms" in Soto and Trancos, as well
as "the addition of card access to the
remaining large residences on the
east side of campus, including Mir
rielees,Toyon and Manzanita Park."
Other changes include giving au
tomatic priorities to three- or six
person groups applying to live in the
Governor's Corner six-person suites
and limiting gender-neutral assign
ments in Suites to four-person units
in response to several problems that
arose this year.
"A decision was made as a result
of the difficulties caused when
someone leaves a gender-neutral
suite mid-year and the assignment
must revert back to single sex, since
[Housing does] not randomly assign
residents to gender-neutral dorms,"
said Whitney.
Whitney said Housing is trying to
better support graduate students,
who may now stay in housing for six
years as long as they are enrolled.
Students last year faced a new
option to rank their preferences
among all residences. According to
Whitney, having a limited amount of
residence choices "caused the stu
dents to have to do a lot of strategiz
ing about which residences they
might have the opportunity to live
in, based on the random draw num
ber they were assigned" a con
tributor to the yearly ritual known
as "drawma."
The draw has three tiers. Tier
three has the highest or worst
draw numbers, while tier one has the
lowest and most preferable. Rising
sophomores are not allowed to use
tier one. Students can use tier one
and tier two only once each.
"The seniors are now caught be
tween the two systems, the old way
and the new way," said Natalie
Goodis 'll, who is about to draw
using tier one.
"The new system guarantees you
draw a number between one and a
thousand, so I will be guaranteed to
be somewhere I like," she added.
Housing preferences opened
April 14 and close May 9.
