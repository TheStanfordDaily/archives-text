## 180 housing picks available to rank in Draw Students to rank residences, specific room options by May 9 
### MARIANNE LeVINE 
Following the changes brought about
by the Housing Master Plan last year, the
Draw will again undergo some changes as
students begin to rank their housing pref
erences for 2010-11, including a new fea
ture allowing students to rank which room

type they prefer.
The move gives undergraduates 180
housing options to rank by May 9.
The new draw process has brought
more positive feedback by students than
in past years, according to Rodger Whit
ney, the executive director of Student
Housing.The option to choose a preferred
room type may also help students choose
whether room type or residence location
is more important overall.
With this change, Housing will now be
able to "offer students participating in the

Draw 'premier' housing, such as single
rooms or two-room doubles or apart
ments, for two of their three upperclass
years," according to Whitney.
Many of the changes this year are a
continuation of the Housing Master Plan
implemented in 2009. Housing last sum
mer took on an "unstuffing" effort with
the opening of Munger Graduate Resi
dences, which can house 600 graduate stu
dents, and the conversion of Crothers Hall
from graduate to undergraduate housing.
Crothers currently houses 376 undergrad

uate students.
Next year, Whitney said, about 60 un
dergraduate upperclassmen could live in
the now-graduate Rains apartments, with
preference to those 21 and older. This
move initially met with resistance from
graduate students; Housing later said it
would assign undergraduates to two
buildings in Rains that were less disrup
tive to the existing graduate community
there.
