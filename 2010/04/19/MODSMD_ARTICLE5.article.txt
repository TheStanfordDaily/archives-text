# RoHos still needed
## Heading into week, sign-ups are still open 
### KATE ABBOTT DESK EDITOR 
A record number of prospective freshmen have signed
up to attend Admit Weekend, which starts Thursday, leaving
coordinators in a scramble to ensure that there will be
enough room hosts to accommodate next weekend's 1,335
expected "ProFros."
Julie Lythcott-Haims 'B9, the dean of freshmen and un
dergraduate advising, sent an e-mail to upperclassmen on
Friday encouraging them to be "RoHos," imploring: "Don't
let Harvard, Yale, Princeton or CAL win! Sign up today and
save a Pro Fro from CAL!"
"The good news is that there are a lot of kids who want
to come and celebrate their admissions," said Dean of Ad
mission Richard Shaw.
"We sent out the request for more volunteers so that stu
dents will step up to the plate and help get the job done," he
added.
Admit Weekend Coordinator Norma Bonilla 'l2 said the
matching process between the ProFros and approximately
1,480 current RoHos is underway.
So, why the need for more?
According to Shaw, to provide flexibility. On Sunday, 32
ProFros remained unmatched because there is a lack of
male RoHos, and some have allergies that need to be taken
into account.
E-mails were sent to several lists asking for students
including upperclassmen who live in a residence with a
Resident Fellow to sign up to host a Profro; RoHos could
also host multiple ProFros if needed. At press time, sign-ups
were still open.
"I think upperclassmen will make great hosts because
they've been here longer and have
that much more to say about the Stan
ford experience," wrote Lythcott-
Haims in an e-mail to The Daily.
"Some ProFros may feel a bit nervous
about staying with someone older,
but I imagine that concern will be
swiftly alleviated."
According to Shaw, the current
number of registered RoFlos is "in
line with" last year's, but the increase
of ProFros by approximately 400
means more hosts are needed.
"Everything is going to be full,"

Shaw said. "There are a lot of parents
coming as many or more as
ProFros."
Coordinators have not made any
changes to the weekend's program
ming because of the surge in R.S. V.P.s.
"So far, it seems it's going to be
okay," Bonilla said.
"It's good news," Shaw added.
"Stanford is very desirable and popu
lar. These numbers being up are good
news, and we're working hard to
make sure we provide ProFros with a
good experience,"
Asked what these numbers mean
for the future of the Class of 2014,
both Lythcott-Haims and Shaw were
unsure.
"I think it means we may be in for
a record number of freshmen!" Lyth

cott-Haims said. "As someone who
loves freshmen, I'm thrilled, but prac
tically speaking, it could really spell
trouble for housing and the other
services that are allocated on a per
student basis."
Shaw said that while students on
the waitlist could potentially be ad
mitted, things would "depend on this
coming weekend."
"[There are] a lot of ifs," he said.
"Not sure what to predict in terms of
class, but we will not be over. We will
be within target."
Stanford admitted 2,300 appli
cants on March 26; another 998 were
waitlisted.
