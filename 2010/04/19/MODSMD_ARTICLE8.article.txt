# 2010 NCAA GYMNASTICS
## FIRST PLACE SLIPS AWAY Stanford relinquishes NCAA title 
### JESSICA YU CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In one of the longest and truly oddest
men's gymnastics competitions in collegiate
history, Stanford men's gymnastics just bare
ly missed reclaiming its championship title
Friday evening at the 2010 NCAA Team
Final in West Point, N.Y. Stanford earned sec
ond place with a team score of 359.8, just 0.7
points behind the Michigan Wolverines, who
vaulted to their fourth national title. The Ok
lahoma Sooners rounded out the top three
with a score of 357.05.
Though some fans were initially upset by
Stanford's second-place finish, others high
lighted the competition's great competitive
atmosphere.
Stanford catapulted through vault to
take an early lead with a team score of
64.05. Freshman Eddie Penev, a seasoned
veteran of international competition as a
member of the Bulgarian national team,
performed his best vault of the year and
the best vault of the competition earning

a 16.4. Junior Josh Dixon and junior co-cap
tain Tim Gentry also scored big on vault,
each earning a 16.0.
Stanford then went on to earn the top
parallel bars score of the night with a 59.70.
Redshirt junior Nick Noone scored a 15.45
and junior Ryan Lieberman scored a 15.25
to lead the Cardinal.
On horizontal bar, Stanford claimed the
second best score of the night. Dixon led the
Cardinal with a score of 14.75, redshirt
sophomore and co-captain Abhinav Ra
mani came in with a 14.65 and junior Alex
Buscaglia followed with a 14.60.
After these first three rotations, Stan
ford held a steady lead.
"We started off really well," said student
assistant coach Bryant Hadden.
But that's when the competition started
going haywire. As Stanford was finishing up
its horizontal bar rotation, Illinois was up
on still rings when the apparatus broke

Freshman Eddie Penev performed his best vault of the year in last weekend's 2010 NCAA
championships at West Point, N.Y., earning himself the 2010 vault champion title.
halfway through one gymnast's rou
tine. As NCAA and host Army offi
cials attempted to repair the appara
tus, competition halted for nearly
one hour.

In an effort to keep their momen
tum running and their muscles warm,
athletes began hopping, jogging and
even hand-standing in place. Realizing
that the sudden stop in competition
could affect the gymnasts' perform
ances, NCAA officials allowed for ad
ditional warm-up time before restart
ing the competition and also between
each apparatus.
However, the additional time may
not have been enough.
"Gymnasts definitely looked
tighter, like they were starting the com
petition all over again," Hadden said.
And even after officials repaired
the still rings, the apparatus was still
considered unstable. Five additional
gymnasts went on to peel off the
rings, causing several coaches to de
mand further inspection. Competi
tion was slowed again as NCAA and
Army officials re-examined and re
repaired the apparatus. Judges later
decided to allow those six athletes
who had peeled off during their dis
mounts to redo their routines for a
final score.
Through the second round of re

pairs, Stanford lost some momentum.
On floor exercise, normally an ex
tremely solid and explosive event for
the Cardinal, several athletes made
small mistakes on their landings, cost
ing the team several tenths of points to
move toward a 61.15. Penev, however,
performed one of the most crowd
pleasing events of the evening, earning
a score of 14.75.

On pommel horse, an event that
has worried the Cardinal all year, Stan
ford pulled off six clean routines, with
sophomore John Martin earning a
score of 14.75 to lead Stanford.
But as the Cardinal moved to still
rings, Michigan moved to vault typ
ically the highest scoring event of any
gymnastics meet. Few athletes and
fans going into the meet had consid
ered Michigan a contender for the na
tional title, but by the final rotation, it
was clear that Michigan was the team
to beat. Gentry and Noone led the Car
dinal with scores of 15.15 and 15.0, re
spectively, but Michigan pulled off six
solid vaults to secure the first-place fin
ish.

Still, Stanford athletes and fans are
happy with their performance.
"We did great," said head coach
Thom Glielmi. "There were several is
sues during the competition, but we
were able to keep focus and get the job

done."
At the individual competition on
Saturday evening, two Stanford gym
nasts, Penev and Lieberman, won na
tional titles, while six others became
All-Americans by placing in the top
eight on their apparatus.
Penev performed an extraordinary
vault to score a 16.45 and become the
2010 NCAA vault champion. He also
earned an Ail-American honor with
his second place finish on floor exer
cise, while Buscaglia finished fifth.
Dixon also did well on vault, plac
ing third and earning an All-American
honor with a score of 16.05. Gentry
placed fourth and earned an Ail-
American with a score of 15.95.
Lieberman performed an extreme
ly difficult parallel bars routine to be
come the 2010 NCAA parallel bars
champion. Noone placed fourth.
Gentry also became an All-Ameri
can on still rings, placing third in the
field. Noone earned an All-American
with his fourth place finish.
Buscaglia finished fifth, Ramani
seventh and Dixon eighth on horizon
tal bar to earn their All-American
honors.
Martin placed sixth on pommel
horse to earn his All-American.
