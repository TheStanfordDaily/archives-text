### JESSICA YU CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In one of the longest and truly oddest
men's gymnastics competitions in collegiate
history, Stanford men's gymnastics just bare
ly missed reclaiming its championship title
Friday evening at the 2010 NCAA Team
Final in West Point, N.Y. Stanford earned sec
ond place with a team score of 359.8, just 0.7
points behind the Michigan Wolverines, who
vaulted to their fourth national title. The Ok
lahoma Sooners rounded out the top three
with a score of 357.05.
Though some fans were initially upset by
Stanford's second-place finish, others high
lighted the competition's great competitive
atmosphere.
Stanford catapulted through vault to
take an early lead with a team score of
64.05. Freshman Eddie Penev, a seasoned
veteran of international competition as a
member of the Bulgarian national team,
performed his best vault of the year and
the best vault of the competition earning

a 16.4. Junior Josh Dixon and junior co-cap
tain Tim Gentry also scored big on vault,
each earning a 16.0.
Stanford then went on to earn the top
parallel bars score of the night with a 59.70.
Redshirt junior Nick Noone scored a 15.45
and junior Ryan Lieberman scored a 15.25
to lead the Cardinal.
On horizontal bar, Stanford claimed the
second best score of the night. Dixon led the
Cardinal with a score of 14.75, redshirt
sophomore and co-captain Abhinav Ra
mani came in with a 14.65 and junior Alex
Buscaglia followed with a 14.60.
After these first three rotations, Stan
ford held a steady lead.
"We started off really well," said student
assistant coach Bryant Hadden.
But that's when the competition started
going haywire. As Stanford was finishing up
its horizontal bar rotation, Illinois was up
on still rings when the apparatus broke
