## Pritzkers donate $10M for undergrad aid Funds will help Chicago students attend Stanford 
### MILES UNTERREINER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Pritzker family, founders of
the Chicago-based Hyatt Hotels
Corporation, pledged $lO million to
Stanford last week to help financial
ly needy students from Chicago at
tend the University.
Known as the Pritzker Scholars
Fund, the gift comes at a key point in
Stanford fundraising history. The
number of students demonstrating
financial need grew during the eco

nomic recession, with nearly half of
all undergraduates now relying at
least partially on scholarships from
the University to reduce tuition and
living expenses.
According to Stanford's financial
aid policy, undergraduates with an an
nual family income below $60,000 are
not expected to pay a parental contri
bution toward any educational ex
penses, while families earning less
than $lOO,OOO do not pay tuition costs.
The policy has strained the al
ready-shrunken University endow
ment, a factor that makes the Pritzk
ers' gift particularly timely, said Direc
tor of Financial Aid Karen Cooper.
University President John Hen
nessy, in a statement to the Stanford

Report, said, "Stanford is committed
to keeping its doors open for stu
dents from all walks of life, and this
gift helps us reinforce that pledge
especially in this economy."
"A $lO million gift is not common,
and very much appreciated," Cooper
added.
Cooper said the fund "will not
create immediate changes to any in
dividual student's eligibility for aid."
"Endowed support for the finan
cial aid program, like the Pritzker
Scholars Fund, means that we don't
have to use unrestricted University
funds for financial aid that could be
used for other purposes," Cooper
added.
The Pritzker family includes sev

eral Stanford Law and Business
alumni and parents of Stanford stu
dents. Their gift is not unprecedent
ed: in 2002, the family donated $3O
million to the University of Chicago
as part of that institution's $2 billion
Chicago Initiative.
"I have great affection and re
spect for Stanford as do many mem
bers of the Pritzker family," said
Penny Sue Pritzker J.D. 'B4 MBA 'B4.
"My mother was fond of saying, 'A
good education is one thing no one
can take away from you. It's some
thing you have for life.' My Stanford
education was first-rate."
