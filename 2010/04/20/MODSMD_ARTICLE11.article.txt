## Stanford to reinstate staff salary raises 
### â€” Julia Brownell DAILY NEWS STAFF 
Stanford recently announced a staff
salary program to be implemented this
September to reinstate merit-based
pay raises after a salary freeze last year
during the economic downturn.
The program's policies are similar
to policies that existed before the fi
nancial downturn and are intended to
encourage high performance among
staff.
The program comes after freezes
and personnel cuts hit campus last
year in the wake of University budget

strains.
"In 2010, staff members did a re
markable job handling the challenges
presented by our campus-wide budg
et reductions, which included a salary
freeze, staff reductions and other ex
traordinary measures," said Diane
Peck, the vice president of human re
sources, in a statement to the Stanford
Report. "It is important that the Uni
versity be able to recognize these
many employee contributions, even
in financially challenging times."
Departments will begin proposing
salary increases for their staff imme
diately, with varying deadlines. The
pay increases will be effective fiscal
year 2011.
