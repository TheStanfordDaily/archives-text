# Scientists identify breakthrough molecules
## 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Julia Brownell 
Stanford scientists have identified
multiple synthetic molecules that
mimic a key protein in the brain in
volved in learning and memory. The
protein, called BDNF, becomes inac
tive in degenerative diseases like
Huntington's and Alzheimer's and de
clines naturally with age.
The new molecules show promise
for creating drug therapies for these
and other neurodegenerative diseases.
Frank Longo of the Stanford
School of Medicine published the find
ings Monday in the Journal of Clinical
Investigation; other authors included
Tao Yang of Stanford and Steve Massa
of UC-San Francisco and the San
Francisco Veterans Affairs Medical
Center.
Massa created a computer data
base through which to identify the

compounds. The database identified
substances similar chemically to
BDNF, and from those 200 molecules,
17 were selected based on toxicity, sol
ubility and other specifications.
Yang then did most of the bioassays
of the identified chemicals at Stanford.
He tested whether or not the mole
cules could keep neurons in a dish
from dying, like BDNF.
BDNF promotes neuron growth
and synapse formation within the
brain. The complex protein supports
existing neurons and helps them make
new connections. In areas where new
neurons do grow in the brain, BDNF
helps facilitate that process.
However, BDNF cannot be used
directly as a therapy in the brain for
diseases where it is less active because
it does not survive for long in blood
and cannot cross the blood-brain bar
rier. These molecules are a break
through since they can replicate
BDNF's effects while overcoming its
chemical problems as a treatment,
making them potentially good candi
dates for future drug studies.
