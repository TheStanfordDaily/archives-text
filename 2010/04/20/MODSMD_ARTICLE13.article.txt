## EDITORIAL Senators must remain on campus throughout their terms 
### 
Today, the ASSU Undergraduate Sen
ate will vote on a bill to forbid future
senators from studying abroad, man
dating that they "shall remain on campus for
the duration of their term." The Editorial
Board believes that senators must be on
campus in order to sufficiently fulfill the
functions of their office. Being on the Senate
is about more than just attending meetings
senators must be aware of the day-to-day
discourse and atmosphere of campus life, a
responsibility for which studying abroad
does not allow. That is why we urge the cur
rent Senate to pass this bill immediately.
The Editorial Board recognizes that this
bill is necessary to end the policy of allowing
senators to serve while abroad. This step to
ward mandating the on-campus presence of
senators is crucial to the Senate's representa
tive function. The student body of Stanford
must be engaged by senators in order to truly
represent their interests; senators abroad are
physically cut-off from campus in away that
digital communication cannot remedy. Fur
thermore, meeting attendance is only half of
a senator's responsibilities. The true work for
the senators comes in meeting with adminis
trators, staff and student groups, working on
initiatives and being engaged in public dis
course to meet the campus' needs and con

cerns. Even if meeting attendance were the
crucial factor in a senator's position, digital
technology too easily affords for multitask
ing, and no accountability measure can be
put in place to ensure a senator's full atten
tion.
Senators who are abroad pose practical
problems, but the greater concern is philo
sophical. The position of senator is one of
public service. This service entails making the
conscious decision to place the needs of the
student body, to some extent, above the per
sonal needs of the senator. The position of
senator is not one of entitlement or conven
ience. When senators are allowed to study
abroad, the position becomes one of person
al power and not public service. Physical
presence is necessary for the intended func
tion of the Senate to be achieved. It is not
merely a function of face time on campus. It
is a function of being an active member of the
campus and serving that community in vote
and in action.
The Editorial Board urges the Senate to
take the measures necessary to ensure that
future senators will be required to remain on
campus for the duration of their terms. Pub
lic service should be the core tenet of sena
tors' decisions, whether concerning campus
issues or personal academic ventures.
