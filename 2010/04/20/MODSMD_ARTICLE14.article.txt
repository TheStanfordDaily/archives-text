# BROADLY SPEAKING
## Law School or Babies 
### Molly Spaeth 
So my little brother went to his first prom
this weekend.

My brother, Maxwell Christian Mueller
Spaeth (he was born 6 weeks premature and
my mom thought he needed a middle name
that really struck a chord with Sweet Baby
Jesus), shares a common trait with his older
sister: we both suck at prom. Max's story in
volves his prom group of 20 each shelling out
$46 per couple to ride a trolley around down
town Fargo (the Paris of the Midwest), only
to forget to tell their moms to come take pic
tures. As a direct result, we have no pictures
of Maxwell at junior prom.
My story is either less or more tragic, de
pending on how you look at it. Less tragic in
the sense that Mom was definitely there on
time with plenty of camera battery taking
pictures at my junior prom, more tragic in the
sense that I was a pretty tragic-looking junior
prom date.
But no matter what, Mom is great because
she always loves you unconditionally, regard
less of your lack of prom photos or lack of
good-looking prom photos. This is great be
cause you're her baby, and Mom always
looks out for the best interests of her baby,
right? This concern was perhaps most aptly
demonstrated in a conversation I had with
my mom last week, as I explained to her how
I would like to take a year off and work be
fore deciding if I really want to go to law
school.

Her response?
"Molly, I just really don't want you to do
that. If you take a year off before going to law
school you're just going to start having ba
bies and then NEVER go back!"
As crazy as it sounds, Mom perhaps un
knowingly illustrated a point that until her
little outburst was unbeknownst even to my
self: if you're not moving up, you might as
well get out. Here at Stanford, whilst con
stantly surrounded by such overachievers,
the next and obvious place always seems to
be up. Not sure what to major in? Well, then
double major! Not sure if your paper is sup
posed to be five or six pages? Write seven! It
is so easy to get caught up in the Stanford
bubble and the up-or-out trajectory that per
haps sometimes we lose sight of ourselves,
deep down and inside.
I visited a cousin of mine over spring
break who does paralegal work at a law firm
in New York. She, like myself, wasn't really
sure about law school, so she took a few years
off to get some hands-on legal experience. As
we walked through Greenwich Village, she
remarked, "I see the new associates coming
in fresh out of law school all the time. They
haven't worked a real job a day in their lives

most have no idea how to make copies,
brew coffee or answer a telephone, and all
but a few have no desire to respect anyone
who does make copies, brew coffee or answer
a telephone. They're smart as hell when it
comes to the legal world, but they have no
perspective when it comes to the real world."
I'm all for jumping straight into a post-un
dergraduate program right away if you're
jumping in for the right reasons. However, if
you're jumping in just because it seems like
the next step up, perhaps you need to take
the time to consider what you really want
deep down. Are you going to marry someone
you don't love just to advance the relation
ship? Are you going to take a promotion in a
job you hate just because it's more money?
Where will it end, and will you ever have the
courage not to move up?
For as much as IHUM taught us that
everything is gray, it's amazing how much we
still see our own lives in black and white. If
we're not advancing on the career path we're
homemakers; if we're not producing briefs
we might as well be producing babies. There
is this inherent insecurity that if we don't
view ourselves as moving up, others will view
us as moving down.
But perhaps the grayest, and most coura
geous, path involves breaking through this
deeply entrenched but fundamentally super
ficial dichotomy. The tracks to career ad
vancement and motherhood are far from
mutually exclusive, but the difficulty in their
convergence lies in the very nature of their
familiarity. The logical paths leading to each
are so predetermined, it's harder to carve
where and when you want those paths to in
tersect. But what our inherently perfectionist
campus (and their parents) need to realize is
that these paths do not and should not con
verge at the same point for everyone, and
that doesn't make anyone more or less suc
cessful than anyone else.

Mom, I don't want law school or babies. I
want law school and babies. I just don't want
either quite yet.

Molly just spent the last 20 minutes of lost pro
ductivity looking up pictures of babies online.
