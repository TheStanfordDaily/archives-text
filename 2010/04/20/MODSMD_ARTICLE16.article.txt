# JUST A THOUGHT
## Sometimes jokes are not jokes 
### Nikola Milanovic 
Back when I was a freshman, my buddy
and I liked to play a little game. Late at
night on weekends, after coming back
from parties, we'd go to our hall's whiteboard
and erase letters in the messages written on it
to spell out offensive phrases and curse
words. We thought it was a really funny game.
One night, I came back late and, seeing a de
tailed message written out on the whiteboard,
erased letters to spell out a homophobic slur
(I think you all know it, but if you need a hint,
it's three letters and starts with an 'F').
A little over a week ago, a gay friend of
mine deactivated from his fraternity, joined
by three of his friends. They left due to feel
ings of disappointment stemming from the
use of this same pejorative in casual conversa
tion and due to the blunt refusal of people to
excise it from their vocabulary.
This topic arises all too frequently because
certain derogatory terms have become so cul
turally embedded that it is difficult to con
sciously abstain from using them. The discus
sion of what constitutes appropriate speech is
often polarizing while one side wants to be
protected from disparaging slurs, the other side
wants to protect its ingrained expressions with
out being portrayed as homophobic or bigoted.
The side that wants protection is right:
people deserve to live in environments where
they don't feel marginalized by hate speech.
The dilemma is much more complex than it
initially appears to be, though. The question
revolves around where to place the brightline
between sensitivity and intolerance.
I grew up in a liberal area. I went to an in
ternational school. I lived next to a gay neigh
borhood.This heterogeneous melting pot cre
ated a community of people comfortable with
their identities and open enough to joke
about them. In effect, everyone I grew up
around was politically incorrect to some de
gree because it was acceptable in such a di
verse society. I have gay friends I can crack
gay jokes with and black friends I can make
black jokes to. My friends and I often joke
lightheartedly about my Serbian heritage.
There is a point, however, where jokes are
not jokes. Everyone has undoubtedly been
given the talk on crossing the line into offen

sive territory.Why,then,is it so hard to discern
how to remain inside the realm of innocuous
jokes? The answer is because that realm is
context-specific. The term queer was first ap
plied to gay people as a weaponized slur.
Then, groups like the Stanford Queer Coali
tion adopted the term to circumvent its harm
ful power as a pejorative. Though it is accept
able to refer to Queer Formal, singling some
one out by yelling the word at them is unac
ceptable.
It seems like the difference boils down to
one of usage. If you want to determine what
constitutes offensive speech, try substituting
in a word that fulfills the same function as the
term you would normally use. If, in a sentence,
you could easily substitute the word "homo
sexual" for "gay," chances are that it's inoffen
sive. If the word "lame" could be substituted, it
might not be so innocuous. Unfortunately, the
brightline isn't that simple: sometimes, even
when you could substitute "homosexual" for
"gay," the two terms both make reference to
the same concept in a derogatory manner
(e.g.,"Man, that outfit is so homosexual").

In the end, it's not these words that bother
people, it's the mentality that these words sig
nify. The proliferation of terms like "gay" as
pejoratives betrays an underlying mentality
of the speaker: namely, that they view homo
sexuality as undesirable, disgusting, or simply
wrong. Most people who use "gay" as a slight
would be quick to assert that they are not ho
mophobic, I fell into this group of people ac
customed to saying "gay" while also consider
ing themselves proponents of the queer agen
da. There are two problems with this defense.
One is that this common vernacular creates
an unconscious association that, ultimately,
makes people mentally comfortable with de
grading homosexuals. The other is that, re
gardless of the intent behind innocently used
slurs, the effect is the same: people are mar
ginalized by these terms.

When I erased that whiteboard as a fresh
man, I lived in a hall with gay friends I would
never want to hurt or offend. I could have told
them this. I could have noted that I was drink
ing and had a lapse in judgment. I could have
blamed it on my sense of humor. None of that

mattered. What did matter was the impact
that word had on people around me.
Maybe we all need to take pains to evalu
ate what is and is not contextually appropri
ate. When in doubt, maybe we should err on
the side of caution. And when it comes to
words like the three letter F-word, we have to
realize that using it is never appropriate.

Will next week's column be more lighthearted?
Man, I hope so. Tune in to find out. nikm@stan
