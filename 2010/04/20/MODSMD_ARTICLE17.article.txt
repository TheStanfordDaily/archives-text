## TOP OF THE PACK Stanford wins a share of the regular season Pac-10 title 
### MIKE LAZARUS STAFF WRITER 
For the first time in four years, the No. 7
Stanford men's team can call itself Pac-10
champions.
In a near-perfect match, the Cardinal de
feated Cal 6-1 on Saturday, clinching a share
of the conference title, closing out the regular
season with a victory and avenging an earlier
home loss to the Golden Bears.

Well, it wasn't quite perfect.
"I really wanted the 7-0 win, to be honest,"
said sophomore Bradley Klahn.
After an up-and-down season, the victory
marks a milestone for the team as it prepares
for the Pac-10 and NCAA tournaments.

"Obviously we had a tough loss (to Cal)
earlier in the season, which was on everyone's
mind," said senior Richard Wire. "We didn't
want to win we wanted to win badly."
One of the team's goals from the start of
the season was to win the Pac-10 title, so, with

the added rivalry from any Stanford-Cal
game, the Cardinal had more motivation
than it needed.

"If you can't get up for that match play
ing Cal, on the road, Pac-10 title, last match of
the season if you can't get up for that?"
Klahn said. "Man, it's going to be tough."
As late as Friday afternoon, the prospects
of a Pac-10 title seemed bleak. In order to
claim a share of the title, Stanford needed
some help from down south. If No. 4 USC
beat No. 12 UCLA, the Trojans would win the
conference title outright, denying Stanford
any chance, even if it defeated Cal.
Yet to nearly everybody's surprise, the
Trojans faltered.
"We got the help that we needed," Klahn
said. "I don't know how many of us were ex
pecting UCLA to beat USC at USC but they
did. It opened up a big opportunity for us and
we took advantage,"

While Stanford will share the title with
USC, that distinction is not putting much of a

damper on the Cardinal's celebration.
"It was really satisfying to have done it,"
Wire said. "This is the year we had the best
chance to do it."

As for the match itself, Stanford wasted no
time at Berkeley, sweeping the three doubles
matches to gain the 1-0 advantage. On the
singles side, junior Greg Hirshman kept the
Cardinal momentum going with a straight
set victory 6-0,6-0. Sophomore RyanThacher
cruised to a 6-2,6-3 victory to put the Cardi
nal within one point of the elusive Pac-10
title.

Fittingly, junior Alex Clayton, a captain
and former Pac-10 Player of the Year, deliv
ered the final blow. Playing in the No. 3 spot,
Clayton worked Nick Andrews of Cal 7-5,6-
2 for the clinching fourth point.
Wire won 6-4,7-5 at the No. 5 spot and
freshman Denis Lin held on for a 6-2,6-7 (7),
1-0 (8) victory at the No. 4 spot. Stanford's

MATCH NOTES: No. 7 Stanford captured a share of its first Pac-10 title
since 2006 with a dominating 6-1 victory over rival No. 13 California.
Bolstered by strong doubles play, the Cardinal took revenge on the
Bears for a loss earlier this season and, with a loss by USC, grabbed a
share of the title. The Cardinal now turns its focus to the postseason,
where the Pac-10 and NCAA tournaments await.
