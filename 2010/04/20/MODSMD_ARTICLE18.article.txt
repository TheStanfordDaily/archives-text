# CARD WIN PAC-10
## Stanford beats Cal to extend its home win streak and take the Pac-10 title 
### WILL SEATON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The No. 10 Stanford women's tennis team (19-1, 7-0
Pac-10) clinched at least a share of the Pac-10 title by de
feating rival No. 12 California (18-5, 5-2) on Saturday,
bringing the title back to the Farm after a one-year hiatus
and achieving one of the team's most important goals for
the season.

Stanford added one more victory in a shutout over
Santa Clara (14-7,4-2 WCC) on Thursday to give the team
momentum going into the rivalry match. Stanford won the
doubles point against the Broncos despite a loss at the No.
2 position by freshmen Mallory Burdette and Stacey Tan.
After going up 1-0 from doubles, Stanford swept its singles
matches without giving up more than four games in a set.
The day was highlighted by Veronica Li's demolition of
Santa Clara's Kimmi Cox, 6-0,6-1. This was Stanford's sev
enth shutout on the year and its 11th straight win.
"We needed to play again before Cal," said head coach
Lele Forood, "so it was good to play that match and get
ourselves tuned back up for dual match play."
With that win, the Cardinal looked to prepare for the
Spring Smash and its matchup against California. The last
time these two teams faced off, Stanford came away with
a 5-2 win at Berkeley, a major upset of the then-No. 5
Bears. This time, the stakes were higher: Stanford was
guaranteed at least a portion of the Pac-10 title if it came
away with the win. Cal has also proven to be a major chal

lenge the past few years, as the Bears reached the nation
al championship match each of the last two seasons.
"It was our Senior Day, it was our Spring Smash, final
home match of the regular season. Yeah, it was very excit
ing," Forood said.
Stanford was able to take the doubles point thanks to
strong play from its No. 2 and No. 3 teams. The combina
tion of junior Carolyn McVeigh and sophomore Veronica
Li took the first point 8-2 before Mallory Burdette and
Tan clinched the doubles point with an 8-4 victory. Unfor
tunately, the No. 2 duo in the nation of junior Hilary Barte
and senior Lindsay Burdette dropped its match to Cal's
No. 7 Mari Andersson and Jana Juricova, 8-6.

With a 1-0 lead, the Cardinal started singles play. The
Golden Bears quickly came roaring back to take a 2-1 lead
with wins at the top two spots. In a matchup of top-five

MATCH NOTES I The No. 10 Cardinal finished its regular season on a
high note with a victory over cross-bay rival Cal. The win was sweet
ened by the fact that it gave the Cardinal a share of the Pac-10 cham
pionship and the conference's automatic bid to the NCAA tournament.

their matches, and preserving the Card's 161 home match win streak.
