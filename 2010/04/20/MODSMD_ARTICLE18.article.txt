# CARD WIN PAC-10
## Stanford beats Cal to extend its home win streak and take the Pac-10 title 
### WILL SEATON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The No. 10 Stanford women's tennis team (19-1, 7-0
Pac-10) clinched at least a share of the Pac-10 title by de
feating rival No. 12 California (18-5, 5-2) on Saturday,
bringing the title back to the Farm after a one-year hiatus
and achieving one of the team's most important goals for
the season.

Stanford added one more victory in a shutout over
Santa Clara (14-7,4-2 WCC) on Thursday to give the team
momentum going into the rivalry match. Stanford won the
doubles point against the Broncos despite a loss at the No.
2 position by freshmen Mallory Burdette and Stacey Tan.
After going up 1-0 from doubles, Stanford swept its singles
matches without giving up more than four games in a set.
The day was highlighted by Veronica Li's demolition of
Santa Clara's Kimmi Cox, 6-0,6-1. This was Stanford's sev
enth shutout on the year and its 11th straight win.
"We needed to play again before Cal," said head coach
Lele Forood, "so it was good to play that match and get
ourselves tuned back up for dual match play."
With that win, the Cardinal looked to prepare for the
Spring Smash and its matchup against California. The last
time these two teams faced off, Stanford came away with
a 5-2 win at Berkeley, a major upset of the then-No. 5
Bears. This time, the stakes were higher: Stanford was
guaranteed at least a portion of the Pac-10 title if it came
away with the win. Cal has also proven to be a major chal

lenge the past few years, as the Bears reached the nation
al championship match each of the last two seasons.
"It was our Senior Day, it was our Spring Smash, final
home match of the regular season. Yeah, it was very excit
ing," Forood said.
Stanford was able to take the doubles point thanks to
strong play from its No. 2 and No. 3 teams. The combina
tion of junior Carolyn McVeigh and sophomore Veronica
Li took the first point 8-2 before Mallory Burdette and
Tan clinched the doubles point with an 8-4 victory. Unfor
tunately, the No. 2 duo in the nation of junior Hilary Barte
and senior Lindsay Burdette dropped its match to Cal's
No. 7 Mari Andersson and Jana Juricova, 8-6.

With a 1-0 lead, the Cardinal started singles play. The
Golden Bears quickly came roaring back to take a 2-1 lead
with wins at the top two spots. In a matchup of top-five

MATCH NOTES I The No. 10 Cardinal finished its regular season on a
high note with a victory over cross-bay rival Cal. The win was sweet
ened by the fact that it gave the Cardinal a share of the Pac-10 cham
pionship and the conference's automatic bid to the NCAA tournament.
Stanford's players in the three through six spots excelled, all winning
their matches, and preserving the Card's 161 home match win streak.

players, No. 2 Juricova defeated No. 4
Barte 6-3,6-3. This was the first loss
at home in dual match play for Barte
since Feb. 28,2009. Next, No. 17 Ma
rina Cossou defeated No. 68 Lindsay
Burdette 6-4, 6-2 to give California
the lead.

Next to finish was No. 73 Tan,
who, after grueling out a tiebreaker
in the first set, breezed through the
second set to win 7-6 (2), 6-0 over
Cal's Kasia Siwosz. The two teams

were tied at 2-2 before No. 120
McVeigh defeated Annie Goransson
6-2, 6-3 to put Stanford within one
match of victory.
The two matches remaining gave
no indication as to who would come
out on top. At the No. 3 spot, Mallo
ry Burdette had lost the first set 6-4
and was down 3-2 in the second. At
the No. 6 spot, Li had won her first
set but was struggling to break out of
a 4-4 tie in the second. Li broke at
that point to go up 5-4 and tried to
serve out the match. Her opponent,
freshman Taylor Davis, survived one
match point before knocking a fore
hand long that gave Li a 6-4,6-4 win
and Stanford a victory for the day. To

make the day sweeter, Mallory Bur
dette came back to win in three sets,
4-6,6-4,6-3.
"When we were up 4-2, the match
was basically decided, but it was real
ly important for Mallory to pull out
her match," Forood said. "It was real
ly important for her to pull through
in that third set and get that win."
While the Cardinal took home
the win and the regular season Pac
-10 title that day, it was bittersweet for
one player. Lindsay Burdette, who
played her last regular season match,
was honored beforehand.
"Lele and [assistant coach]
Frankie [Brennan] did a really god
job of keeping it light, which was
awesome," Lindsay Burdette said.
"The fact that it was short and sweet
was definitely the way I had hoped it
would go so it was perfect."
UCLA still has an opportunity to
tie for the Pac-10 title. Stanford's

match against USC was suspended
due to rain at 3-3 a few weeks ago
and so the doubles matches will be
played on Wednesday. If Stanford
wins the doubles point, it will be 8-0
and win the title outright. If the Card
loses, UCLA will be forced to play
Cal in another cancelled match.
Should the Bruins beat the Golden
Bears, they would share the title with
Stanford, but the Cardinal would
still get the Pac-10's automatic bid to
the postseason thanks to its 5-2 vic
tory over UCLA on April 3.
"It's been a very productive sea
son. I'm very proud of the team for
getting the Pac-10 title back,"
Forood said. "That was one of our
biggest objectives this year. We
structured our season to get it back."

Stanford was able to take the doubles point thanks to
strong play from its No. 2 and No. 3 teams. The combina
tion of junior Carolyn McVeigh and sophomore Veronica
Li took the first point 8-2 before Mallory Burdette and
Tan clinched the doubles point with an 8-4 victory. Unfor
tunately, the No. 2 duo in the nation of junior Hilary Barte
and senior Lindsay Burdette dropped its match to Cal's
No. 7 Mari Andersson and Jana Juricova, 8-6.

With a 1-0 lead, the Cardinal started singles play. The
Golden Bears quickly came roaring back to take a 2-1 lead
with wins at the top two spots. In a matchup of top-five

MATCH NOTES I The No. 10 Cardinal finished its regular season on a
high note with a victory over cross-bay rival Cal. The win was sweet
ened by the fact that it gave the Cardinal a share of the Pac-10 cham
pionship and the conference's automatic bid to the NCAA tournament.
Stanford's players in the three through six spots excelled, all winning
their matches, and preserving the Card's 161 home match win streak.

players, No. 2 Juricova defeated No. 4
Barte 6-3,6-3. This was the first loss
at home in dual match play for Barte
since Feb. 28,2009. Next, No. 17 Ma
rina Cossou defeated No. 68 Lindsay
Burdette 6-4, 6-2 to give California
the lead.

Next to finish was No. 73 Tan,
who, after grueling out a tiebreaker
in the first set, breezed through the
second set to win 7-6 (2), 6-0 over
Cal's Kasia Siwosz. The two teams

were tied at 2-2 before No. 120
McVeigh defeated Annie Goransson
6-2, 6-3 to put Stanford within one
match of victory.
The two matches remaining gave
no indication as to who would come
out on top. At the No. 3 spot, Mallo
ry Burdette had lost the first set 6-4
and was down 3-2 in the second. At
the No. 6 spot, Li had won her first
set but was struggling to break out of
a 4-4 tie in the second. Li broke at
that point to go up 5-4 and tried to
serve out the match. Her opponent,
freshman Taylor Davis, survived one
match point before knocking a fore
hand long that gave Li a 6-4,6-4 win
and Stanford a victory for the day. To

make the day sweeter, Mallory Bur
dette came back to win in three sets,
4-6,6-4,6-3.
"When we were up 4-2, the match
was basically decided, but it was real
ly important for Mallory to pull out
her match," Forood said. "It was real
ly important for her to pull through
in that third set and get that win."
While the Cardinal took home
the win and the regular season Pac
-10 title that day, it was bittersweet for
one player. Lindsay Burdette, who
played her last regular season match,
was honored beforehand.
"Lele and [assistant coach]
Frankie [Brennan] did a really god
job of keeping it light, which was
awesome," Lindsay Burdette said.
"The fact that it was short and sweet
was definitely the way I had hoped it
would go so it was perfect."
UCLA still has an opportunity to
tie for the Pac-10 title. Stanford's

match against USC was suspended
due to rain at 3-3 a few weeks ago
and so the doubles matches will be
played on Wednesday. If Stanford
wins the doubles point, it will be 8-0
and win the title outright. If the Card
loses, UCLA will be forced to play
Cal in another cancelled match.
Should the Bruins beat the Golden
Bears, they would share the title with
Stanford, but the Cardinal would
still get the Pac-10's automatic bid to
the postseason thanks to its 5-2 vic
tory over UCLA on April 3.
"It's been a very productive sea
son. I'm very proud of the team for
getting the Pac-10 title back,"
Forood said. "That was one of our
biggest objectives this year. We
structured our season to get it back."

No. 39 Mallory Burdette prepares to serve in Stanford's 5-2 win over Cal.
Burdette won in the No. 3 spot and, with the victory in the match, the Card captured
a share of the Pac- 10 title while extending its home win streak to 161 matches.
The No. 10 Stanford women's tennis team (19-1, 7-0
Pac-10) clinched at least a share of the Pac-10 title by de
feating rival No. 12 California (18-5, 5-2) on Saturday,
bringing the title back to the Farm after a one-year hiatus
and achieving one of the team's most important goals for
the season.

Stanford added one more victory in a shutout over
Santa Clara (14-7,4-2 WCC) on Thursday to give the team
momentum going into the rivalry match. Stanford won the
doubles point against the Broncos despite a loss at the No.
2 position by freshmen Mallory Burdette and Stacey Tan.
After going up 1-0 from doubles, Stanford swept its singles
matches without giving up more than four games in a set.
The day was highlighted by Veronica Li's demolition of
Santa Clara's Kimmi Cox, 6-0,6-1. This was Stanford's sev
enth shutout on the year and its 11th straight win.
"We needed to play again before Cal," said head coach
Lele Forood, "so it was good to play that match and get
ourselves tuned back up for dual match play."
With that win, the Cardinal looked to prepare for the
Spring Smash and its matchup against California. The last
time these two teams faced off, Stanford came away with
a 5-2 win at Berkeley, a major upset of the then-No. 5
Bears. This time, the stakes were higher: Stanford was
guaranteed at least a portion of the Pac-10 title if it came
away with the win. Cal has also proven to be a major chal

lenge the past few years, as the Bears reached the nation
al championship match each of the last two seasons.
"It was our Senior Day, it was our Spring Smash, final
home match of the regular season. Yeah, it was very excit
ing," Forood said.
