After Big Meet, the track and field team has been busy in and out
of the competitive athletic arena. With 33 members of the team re
cently honored with the MPSF All-Academic Award, the Cardinal
has been busy achieving excellence on and off the track. Stanford led
the conference with 33 nominees. Senior Kate Niehaus led the MPSF
with a GPA of 4.062 while majoring in bioengineering.
In addition to these academic endeavors and successes, the Stan
ford track and field team has also been busy attending various small
er meets, preparing for Pac-lOs and the NCAA Championships.
Leading the way for Stanford at the Mount SAC Relays was the
men's distance program, with three runners breaking the 14-minute
barrier in the sk. Junior Elliott Fleath, who ran one of the fastest
times in the NCAA thus far this year, set the pace with a time of
13:29.75, which was a personal best time. Following him was sopho
more Chris Derrick, who finished with a time of 13:31.67, slightly off
his own personal record of 13:29.98 a time he ran as a freshman to
set the American Junior Record. The
final Cardinal in the event was junior
JT Sullivan, who finished with a per
sonal best of 13:54.10.

Former Stanford pole vaulter and
current pole vaulting coach Toby
Stevenson was also present at the
meet and inducted into the Mt. SAC
Relays Hall of Fame. Stevenson, who
won a silver medal at the 2004
Olympics, competed at the Mt. SAC
relays in 2004,2005 and 2006 win
ning the event all three years.
Competing in the event for Stan
ford this year was sophomore stand
out Katerina Stefanidi, who took
third in the event with a mark of 12-
11.5.

The throwers also had an invita
tional meet his past weekend at UC-
Davis and fared quite well. On the
women's side, senior Jaynie Good
body took home the meet title in the
hammer throw with a toss of 182-11.
Another female thrower who placed
for Stanford was sophomore Molly
Kinsella, who placed third in the dis
cus with a mark of 142-0, which was a
season best.

On the men's side, redshirt junior
Carter Wells had an excellent meet,
placing third in the hammer throw
with a toss of 193-6 and placing second
in the discus with a mark of 156-0.

Coming up next for the Cardinal
is the Brutus Hamilton Invitational,
which will take place this Friday and
Saturday at Cal. The Invitational is a
highly competitive meet featuring
athletes from all over the country,
and the Cardinal will look for some
top performances and NCAA quali
fying standards.
Sophomore Dylan Ferris, current
ly one of the top 800-meter runners
in the country, will look to improve
his time and prepare for the next
level of competition. Ferris will need
to run even faster to succeed in Pac
10s as well as the NCAA Champi
onships, and he commented on how
he could do so.
"To run faster I need to work on
the distance from 200 to 600 meters
and make sure the pace continues to
be fast," Ferris said. "That is the hard
part of racing, to keep the pace mov
ing when people tend to get tired."

The Brutus Hamilton meet will
play a big role in setting the tone for
the higher-stakes meets awaiting the
Cardinal, such as Pac-lOs and
NCAAs.
