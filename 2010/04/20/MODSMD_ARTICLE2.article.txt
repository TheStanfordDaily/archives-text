### CAROLINE CHEN STAFF WRITER 
Nicholas Jenkins has been appointed
the new director of the Program in Writ
ing and Rhetoric (PWR), succeeding
10-year director Andrea Lunsford.
As director, Jenkins will both run the
program and help examine its role in the
Stanford curriculum as part of a major
study on undergraduate education that
began earlier this year.
Jenkins, an English professor and the
director of undergraduate studies in the
English department, completed his un
dergraduate and graduate degrees at
Oxford University and specializes in
20th century literature and poetry. He
also is a widely published essayist, espe
cially on the subject of poet W. H. Auden.

'B5 has hailed Jenkins' commitment to
the program; Lunsford called Jenkins a
"pure joy as a colleague."
Jenkins shared the same measure of
enthusiasm in an interview with The
Daily.
"Why wouldn't I want to be involved
with a program that tries to lift Stanford
undergraduates to a new level of
strength in their writing?" he said,
adding that he wished he had a similar
opportunity during his undergraduate
years.
