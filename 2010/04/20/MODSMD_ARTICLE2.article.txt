## New PWR director appointed Nicholas Jenkins inherits a program under review 
### CAROLINE CHEN STAFF WRITER 
Nicholas Jenkins has been appointed
the new director of the Program in Writ
ing and Rhetoric (PWR), succeeding
10-year director Andrea Lunsford.
As director, Jenkins will both run the
program and help examine its role in the
Stanford curriculum as part of a major
study on undergraduate education that
began earlier this year.
Jenkins, an English professor and the
director of undergraduate studies in the
English department, completed his un
dergraduate and graduate degrees at
Oxford University and specializes in
20th century literature and poetry. He
also is a widely published essayist, espe
cially on the subject of poet W. H. Auden.
Vice Provost for Undergraduate Ed
ucation John Bravman '79 M.S. 81 Ph.D.
'B5 has hailed Jenkins' commitment to
the program; Lunsford called Jenkins a
"pure joy as a colleague."
Jenkins shared the same measure of
enthusiasm in an interview with The
Daily.
"Why wouldn't I want to be involved
with a program that tries to lift Stanford
undergraduates to a new level of
strength in their writing?" he said,
adding that he wished he had a similar
opportunity during his undergraduate
years.
In addition to overseeing PWR and
acting as a liaison between the program
and the Faculty Senate, Jenkins is ex
pected to work closely with the commis
sion conducting the Study of Under
graduate Education at Stanford
(SUES). SUES was tasked by top ad
ministrators this year to review, among
other things, the general education cur
riculum, including Introduction to the
Humanities (IHUM) and PWR.
"I hope to discuss with SUES what
PWR requirements do for students, if
PWR requirements are doing what
they're supposed to do and what ways
they could be done better," Jenkins said.

Final recommendations from the
commission are at least a year and a half
away, so any changes made to the PWR
program would not come into effect for
some time, Jenkins said. While the
SUES review may lead to the revision
of non-major writing requirements,
Jenkins said a writing program would
always be key to Stanford's curriculum.
"Stanford is committed to writing
and to a vigorous, flourishing writing
program," Jenkins said.
Jenkins also hopes to find ways in
which IHUM and PWR can be mutual
ly supportive and collaborative, despite
their different purposes.
Russell Berman, the faculty director
of IHUM, also shared Jenkins' senti
ments. Like Jenkins, Berman believes
that the skills taught in IHUM and
PWR are an essential part of the Stan
ford curriculum.

"IHUM is about the reading and in
terpretation, PWR is about writing and
communication," Berman said. "There
is no career that Stanford students will
follow that does not involve a lot of
reading, discussing, writing and inter
pretation."
Jenkins will succeed Lunsford, who

came to Stanford 10 years ago and cre
ated PWR's existing structure,
"I couldn't find a programmatic cen
ter," Lunsford said about the old pro
gram, then called Writing and Critical
Thinking. She said more than half of the
freshmen were exempt from that pro
gram based on A.E English scores; lec
turers were employed part-time.
Today, Lunsford oversees first- and
second-year PWR and the program's
Undergraduate Advisory Board, which
she created.
Lunsford said it is time for leader
ship to change hands, though she con
tinues as an English professor while
working on four book projects.
"I'm very old and I should retire, but
I'm having so much fun!" she said.
As for Jenkins, his work with PWR is
just beginning. Citing his faith in the
words of philosopher Ludwig Wittgen
stein "The limits of language are the
limits of my world" Jenkins said he
hopes to help students extend their
powers of language.
"I want to help sustain and build a
culture of writing at Stanford," Jenkins
said. "It's always going to be fundamen
tal to the lives of Stanford undergradu
ates."
