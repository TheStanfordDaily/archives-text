## Baseball deserves some credit 
### Jacob Jaffe Fields of Failure 
I like sports, except baseball. I can't
sit through a whole game noth
ing happens! I hate baseball. How
many times have you heard people
say these things? How many times
have you heard yourself say these things?
Sadly, baseball has become the sport
to make fun of and complain about, even
though it is one of the preeminent sports
in America. Even among sports fans and
Daily editors, baseball often gets attacked
more than an Oregon football player's
girlfriend.
Now, don't get me wrong, I'm not
starting a club for Underappreciated
Sports in America (although the USA is
currently accepting donations if you're
interested). Baseball's reception in
America is not at all like soccer's. Base
ball is still America's Pastime, and it re
mains one of the most popular sports in
the nation —if you don't believe me,
check out the ticket prices at Yankee Sta
dium and look how many fans still show
up.
Despite the general popularity,
though,baseball still doesn't get the repu
tation it deserves from many people my
age. College students in particular seem
to enjoy bashing baseball in favor of
more glamorous sports like the National
Leßron Association. And there's noth
ing wrong with liking the NLBA (com
monly referred to as the NBA by the few
people who recognize the other 29 teams
in Leßron's league), but this shouldn't
detract from people's view of baseball.
This past weekend was a prime exam
ple of what makes baseball great.
For starters (no pun intended), there
was Übaldo Jimenez. A young, up-and
coming pitcher for a young, up-and-com
ing team reached the pinnacle of pitching
success (or at least one of its peaks) when
he no-hit the Atlanta Braves, who have
averaged over eight hits in the rest of their
games this season. Jimenez switched to
pitching entirely from the stretch usu
ally reserved for scenarios with men on
base when he ran into early trouble
with his control. This change, mixed with
a fastball that averaged 97 miles per hour
and the necessary outstanding defensive
play by Dexter Fowler, shut down the
Braves' bats and helped Jimenez's name
and skills become well-known around
the country.
That same night, the Mets and Cardi
nals played a marathon game in fact,
the game lasted over three times as long
as Robert K. Cheruiyot's Boston
Marathon victory. New York and St.
Louis played 20 innings on Saturday, but
that number alone doesn't tell the whole
story.
For 18 innings the length oftwo full
games two teams featuring offensive
stars like Albert Pujols, David Wright,
Matt Holliday and Jason Bay were held
scoreless. No runs in 18 innings That's like
a football game going four overtimes
with no points. What made it more ridicu
lous is that once the Mets finally touched
home in the top of the 19th inning, the
Cardinals turned around and tied it in the
bottom of the inning. After 18 failed at
tempts at scoring, each team succeeded
on its 19th try. The Mets ended up win
ning in the 20th against outfielder Joe
Mather, who was making his pitching
debut to save the rest of the Cardinal
pitching staff) but the craziness in the box
score is enough to make Ron Artest feel
uncomfortable.
The Cardinals went an astounding 1-
18 with runners in scoring position,
stranding 22 runners onbase.Jose Reyes,
Jason Bay and Jeff Francoeur, three of
the Mets' first five hitters,combined to go
0-21 in a victory. New York's staff had to
use 88 pitches against the Cardinals' first
two hitters alone.
In addition to these two games, there's
intrigue all over Major League Baseball.
The Boston Red Sox, one of the favorites
to win the World Series, added an elite
pitcher in John Lackey and elite defend
ers in Mike Cameron, Adrian Beltre and
Marco Scutaro. So of course, the Sox sit at
4-9, worse than the Royals, Nationals, Pi
rates and Blue Jays. It's like the Saints
adding Darrelle Revis and Dwight
Freeney and then losing to the Liona In
one game, Tim Lincecum got nearly as
many hits (three) and RBIs (three) as
MarkTeixeira has all year (five, six). Scott
Podsednik and Martin Prado lead their
respective leagues in hitting, and Casey
Janssen has more wins than the Balti
more Oriolea
Baseball is extremely unpredictable,
and that's what makes it great. The day
after being no-hit, the Braves won. The
day after going 20 innings, the Mets and
Cardinals lasted the usual nine and left
only 13 runners on base combined.The
Red Sox will probably rebound and be
in playoff contention by June, and I'm
guessing Tim Lincecum won't outhit
MarkTeixeira.
But who knows?
