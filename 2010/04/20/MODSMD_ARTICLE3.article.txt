# Gates discusses global problems
## Health & education are key concerns 
### AN LE NGUYEN DESK EDITOR 
Standing before a packed Memorial Auditorium on
Monday, Bill Gates asked, "Are the brightest minds
working on the most important problems?"
Despite a number of significant breakthroughs over
the past decades, the answer for Gates is far from a re
sounding "yes."
"My view is that we could do a lot better on this and it
would make a huge difference," he said.
As this year's Payne Distinguished Lecturer, Gates,
the chairman of Microsoft, spoke to the Stanford com
munity about the world's biggest problems and the
means by which bright minds can address them.The com
puting magnate's talk, sponsored by the Freeman Spogli
Institute for International Studies, underscored two
problems: global health and education.

Gates said childhood survival rates serve as an impor
tant metric when measuring global health. The sad truth
of the matter, he said, is that "childhood deaths are still a
huge problem." He said new vaccines and effective deliv
ery methods are needed. Though the visibility of health
concerns has improved from 10 years ago, medical inno
vations have yet to eradicate the host of diseases that
plague the developing world.
But health care is just one woe among myriad chal
lenges that the global community must address, Gates
said; education is another.
Gates stated the United States saw rapid improve
ments in primary and secondary education in the decades
following World War 11, but that progress has leveled off
in recent years.
"It's a system that really needs more excellence,"

At Stanford, Bill Gates spoke about the need to encourage brights minds to take
on the world's "most important problems." Gates drew on his personal
experiences in philanthropy and urged students to make a difference.
Gates said of the American public
school system. "We need to find out
what are good teaching techniques.
We need to figure out not only what
works but how to spread those
things."
The dearth of research in educa
tion is strongly felt in a country where
30 percent of students drop out of
high school. "I think you would be
amazed how little work there is in this
area," Gates said.
Gates' lecture on health and edu
cation was followed by a question
and-answer session in which the bil
lionaire answered audience mem
bers' queries. He touched upon topics
varying from successful charter
schools to the release of Apple's iPad.
At the beginning of the lecture,
Stanford Provost John Etchemendy
introduced Gates as "a visionary tech
nologist and business leader."
Encouraging Firsthand Action
In an interview with The Daily,
Gates spoke in depth about his per
sonal travels and life experiences.
Gates, who travels to India and
Africa at least once a year, said these
journeys have opened up his eyes in
many ways.
"It's inspirational in that you see
the needs, you see the importance of
the work," he said.
"I'd say the same thing about vis
iting inner-city schools with the kids
that are doing their best but not get
ting the resources they deserve," he

added.
Though the United States spends
far more than any other wealthy
country on education, it has seen little
improvement in K-12 learning. "In
the last 30 years, since we increased re
sources dramatically, we've had no
payoff at all in terms of students' basic
literacy or basic math," Gates said.
"Nobody can defend the high
school system that we have today," he
added.
The Microsoft mogul called upon
students to publicize their thoughts
about ways to combat global prob
lems on the Bill and Melinda Gates
Foundation's Facebook page. He en
couraged them to create interest
groups through mailing lists, bulletin
boards and Facebook groups.
"For the money that's invested,
under the right systems, something
fantastic can be done with the right
people," Gates said.
