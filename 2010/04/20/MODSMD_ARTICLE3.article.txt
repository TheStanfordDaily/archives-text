# Gates discusses global problems
## Health & education are key concerns 
### AN LE NGUYEN DESK EDITOR 
Standing before a packed Memorial Auditorium on
Monday, Bill Gates asked, "Are the brightest minds
working on the most important problems?"
Despite a number of significant breakthroughs over
the past decades, the answer for Gates is far from a re
sounding "yes."
"My view is that we could do a lot better on this and it
would make a huge difference," he said.
As this year's Payne Distinguished Lecturer, Gates,
the chairman of Microsoft, spoke to the Stanford com
munity about the world's biggest problems and the
means by which bright minds can address them.The com
puting magnate's talk, sponsored by the Freeman Spogli
Institute for International Studies, underscored two
problems: global health and education.

Gates said childhood survival rates serve as an impor
tant metric when measuring global health. The sad truth
of the matter, he said, is that "childhood deaths are still a
huge problem." He said new vaccines and effective deliv
ery methods are needed. Though the visibility of health
concerns has improved from 10 years ago, medical inno
vations have yet to eradicate the host of diseases that
plague the developing world.
But health care is just one woe among myriad chal
lenges that the global community must address, Gates
said; education is another.
Gates stated the United States saw rapid improve
ments in primary and secondary education in the decades
following World War 11, but that progress has leveled off
in recent years.
"It's a system that really needs more excellence,"
