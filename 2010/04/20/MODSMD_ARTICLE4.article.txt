## Stanford charter schools in EPAA could get extension 
### BRIANNA PANG STAFF WRITER 
Stanford New School, the University-oper
ated charter school in East Palo Alto, faces an
uncertain future after the Ravenswood City
School District Board denied its five-year
charter renewal in a 3-2 vote last week. The
board is now set to consider a two-year charter
extension on Thursday.

A product of the Stanford School of Educa
tion, Stanford New School, which includes an
elementary school and a high school, together
called East Palo Alto Academy (EPAA),
ranked in the state's lowest 20 percent of
schools based on test scores last month.

"The primary reason the charter was not
renewed was the minimal gains in student per
formance," wrote Ravenswood Superinten
dent Maria de la Vega in an e-mail to The

Daily. "We learned a hard lesson Wednes
day night that there is little room for learning
in the current policy environment, or for ef
forts to find a balance between preparing stu
dents for tests and fostering the other skills
they need to become productive citizens," said
School of Education Dean Deborah Stipek.
The high school component of the School
of Education project began about nine years
ago. In the past seven years, the high school in

creased its Academic Performance Index
(API) by 181 points.

"Stanford took a risk to start a school in
one of the most challenging communities in
California," Stipek said, "where most children
live in poverty and many arrive at school with
little English." A majority of the schools' stu
dents are non-native English speakers.
Supporters of EPAA, which has
about 520 students, point to its gains
in areas outside of standardized test
ing. The high school completion rate
is 86 percent, compared to Califor
nia's overall rate of 80 percent. The
schools' fact sheet indicates that 96
percent of graduates are admitted to
college, and more than half are ad
mitted to four-year colleges.
But numbers for the elementary
school, which has only been "a real
school" for three years, according to
its chief academic officer, were low,
driving the state's ranking and the
board's decision not to renew
EPAA's charter.
Though board members dis
played support for the high school,
its "fate is tied to that of our elemen
tary school," Stipek said.
Stipek remains hopeful that the
successes of the high school will en
courage the board to reevaluate its
decision.
"I hope the Ravenswood School
Board will give us some time to
achieve in the elementary grades the
level of success that we have reached
in our high school," Stipek said.
The board voted 4-1 last week to
discuss a shorter two-year charter
extension.

Meanwhile, Christelle Estrada,
the New School chief academic offi
cer, said improvements to the ele
mentary school, including one-on
one tutoring and "intervention"
groups for students who need extra
help, are being developed.
"We delineated a lot of changes
that we were already planning to im
plement," Estrada added. "We're
hoping that what we gave them will
make a strong case for considering
an extension."
The board is set to discuss
EPAA's charter at its meeting Thurs
day.
