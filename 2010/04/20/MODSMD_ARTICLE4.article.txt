## Stanford charter schools in EPAA could get extension 
### BRIANNA PANG STAFF WRITER 
Stanford New School, the University-oper
ated charter school in East Palo Alto, faces an
uncertain future after the Ravenswood City
School District Board denied its five-year
charter renewal in a 3-2 vote last week. The
board is now set to consider a two-year charter
extension on Thursday.

A product of the Stanford School of Educa
tion, Stanford New School, which includes an
elementary school and a high school, together
called East Palo Alto Academy (EPAA),
ranked in the state's lowest 20 percent of
schools based on test scores last month.

"The primary reason the charter was not
renewed was the minimal gains in student per
formance," wrote Ravenswood Superinten
dent Maria de la Vega in an e-mail to The

Daily. "We learned a hard lesson Wednes
day night that there is little room for learning
in the current policy environment, or for ef
forts to find a balance between preparing stu
dents for tests and fostering the other skills
they need to become productive citizens," said
School of Education Dean Deborah Stipek.
The high school component of the School
of Education project began about nine years
ago. In the past seven years, the high school in

creased its Academic Performance Index
(API) by 181 points.

"Stanford took a risk to start a school in
one of the most challenging communities in
California," Stipek said, "where most children
live in poverty and many arrive at school with
little English." A majority of the schools' stu
dents are non-native English speakers.
