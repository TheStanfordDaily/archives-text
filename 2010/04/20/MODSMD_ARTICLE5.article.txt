## Kappa Sig quiet on homophobic controversy 
### ELIZABETH TITUS MANAGING EDITOR 
Members of the Stanford chapter of the Kappa
Sigma fraternity remain tight-lipped this week after sev
eral men complained about the use of homophobic lan
guage in the chapter and said they would deactivate,
sparking the attention of the Inter-Fraternity Council.
A series of e-mails between members of the fraterni
ty began on April 3 with one member writing, "I'd appre
ciate it if we could stop sending out messages with the
word fag in them. I know it's not meant to be derogato
ry against gay people, but it does bother me,"
Another member wrote back: "Delayed April
Fools?"
A flurry of replies ensued, with members denouncing
the "April Fool's" response and at least three of them
saying they would deactivate.
The president of the chapter, Harris Brown 'll, called
for an end to the discussion, saying the concerns about
homophobic language were "legitimate" and that the e
mails were "embarrassing to our house."
The thread circulated on campus e-mail lists, includ
ing Qnet and The Diaspora, for days afterward.
Now, it remains unclear how the chapter is dealing
with the fallout. Brown, in an e-mail to The Daily, would
say only that it was "an incident that first must be re
solved internally, with the individuals involved, and with
the University."
One of the men who said he would leave the chapter,
Zach Wettstein 'll, echoed Harris, saying they were
"working through proper channels" to resolve the issue.
None of the other members involved in the flare-up
returned requests for comment, including juniors Ben
Halpern and Chris Winterbauer, who also said they
would deactivate, and Bert Mcßride 'lO, who first re-
sponded to the initial e-mail. The
member who first raised the con
cern, Jon Anderson 'll, declined to
speak publicly about it.
Nikola Milanovic 'll, the incom
ing president of the Inter-Fraternity
Council and a Daily columnist, said
the council was aware of the discus
sion in Kappa Sigma but staying out
of what he called an "intra-fraterni
ty" issue.
He said homophobia is a "salient
concern" to the Greek community
here.
"It's true that there are inci
dences of homophobic acts in frats,
and this is concerning to the IFC as
well as fraternity leadership because
these acts are not representative of
the culture that we want to create,"
Milanovic wrote in an e-mail to The
Daily.
Amanda Rodriguez, the Greek
program advisor for Residential Ed
ucation, deferred questions about
whether or not ResEd was helping
resolve the dispute to Nate Boswell,
an associate ResEd dean. Boswell
did not return requests for comment
on Monday.
