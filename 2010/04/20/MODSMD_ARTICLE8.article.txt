Strange words coming from a political wonk. But for Sullivan, a visiting
professor of political science, putting truth back into the political equation
has been worth an entire career of heebie jeebies.
Sullivan, who hails from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill,
is spending the year at Stanford's Hoover Institution as a Glenn Campbell
National Fellow. He is an expert on the presidency and works on mathemat
ical models of leadership and presidential operations, but he is best known for
being the co-founder and executive director of the White House Transition
Project, which has assisted new presidents in making the jump from campaign
mode to governing mode for over a decade.
A no-nonsense political firebrand with a vast knowledge of insider poli

tics, Sullivan isn't a huge fan of politicians. But he likes academics. That's why
he thinks that politicians and academics need to collaborate. That partnership
was the driving force behind the White House Transition Project.
"Clinton had a pretty disastrous transition," Sullivan said. "So, in 1996, a
group of scholars put together a project that would allow us to lend what we
knew about the White House to national politicians so they wouldn't
screw up their first days in office. It often hasn't occurred to them govern
ing isn't at all like campaigning."
Sullivan aimed to streamline the transfer of power and set up an institu
tionalized mechanism to chronicle the experience of the past administration
and give that information to the next administration. In transitions, Sullivan
says that years of invaluable experience are lost because no one asks the out
going administrative staff what they've learned.
In order to ease the transition from campaign mode to governing mode,
scholars with the Transition Project compile data, protocols, interviews and
other resources into guides for incoming staff, to preserve what Sullivan calls
"institutional memory." This is especially useful as new staff members are
often reluctant to ask for help from their predecessors.
"Most White House staffs come in thinking they're going to do things dif

ferently, but they end up doing the exact same thing," Sullivan said. "The pres
idency is an institution and an enormous burden. You don't have that much
choice. You have to do things the same way."

And so far, Sullivan says that the simple effort to capture the experience
of the former administration works. This time around, the 2009 presidential
turnover, nicknamed "No drama Obama," didn't run into the problems (and
shenanigans) that characterized George W. Bush's transition into the White
House.

"Bush going out did a lot of things to prepare for a smooth transfer of
power and after discussion with Obama's people, we had a rule that peo
ple had to exit the building in order of age," Sullivan said, explaining the logic
that the young people would leave first so that they couldn't pull any last
minute shenanigans. When the Bush administration settled in at the White
House, the keyboards had no Ws and phones were glued to the receivers.
"There were so many stupid little transition problems," Sullivan said.

That's where Sullivan feels academics can make their mark on politics.
They can see a problem, for instance a presidential transition, and devote the
time and resources to solving the details. But obtaining that mindset, for Sul
livan, comes from being exposed to the intellectual rigor of a university
and that's why Sullivan says he came to Stanford.

"The value of elite education is exposure to the truth," he said.
Sullivan feels that those opportunities to get at the truth abound at Stan
ford — "while one in 25 [at UNC-Chapel Hill] might have had experience
working for national politicians, ten out of ten here will have had that experi
ence," — but he worries that students fall into the trap of the infamous "Stan
ford bubble," where they prioritize prestigious honors and high-profile op
portunities over their studies.
"The much better range of opportunities might [actually be a] drawback,"
Sullivan said. "Stanford students have way too many opportunities to do
things out of class, and not in class — but the classroom is where truth is."
Sullivan hopes to take that message to politicians, and believes that his re
search and teaching can help politicians see the need to collaborate with ac
ademics.
"Being part of academics is being part of the march of knowledge through
time," he said. "Best of all, our interest is actually useful. We are using the
transformation of data about what happens inside the decision making
process to help decision makers."
