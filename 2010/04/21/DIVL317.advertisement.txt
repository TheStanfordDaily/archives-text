Stanford Continuing Studies and Stanford Historical Society Present
Patrick Suppes
Lucie Stern Professor of Philosophy, Emeritus
Over a career that has spanned six decades, Patrick Suppes has made profound contributions
to the philosophy of science, the theory of measurement, decision theory, psychology, and
educational technology. In the 19605, Suppes and Richard Atkinson (future president of the
University of California) conducted experiments in using computers to teach mathematics and
reading to school children in Palo Alto. This work led to the creation of Stanford's Education
Program for Gifted Youth (EPGY) that has taught multimedia courses to more than 50,000
K—l2 students in thirty-five countries. Suppes' lifelong dedication to the provision of
computer-assisted courses, and his progressive improvements in their design and implementation,
have earned him the nickname "The Father of Distance Learning." In 1990, he was awarded
the prestigious National Medal of Science by President George H.W. Hush.
Patrick Suppes will be introduced by his distinguished colleague, Nobel I.aureate economist
Kenneth Arrow, the Joan Kenney Professor of Economics, Emeritus.
