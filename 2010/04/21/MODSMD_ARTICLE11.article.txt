## EDITORIAL As Bravman leaves Stanford, replacement has tough act to follow 
### 
It is hard to measure the impact any single
administrator has on the student experi
ence here at Stanford. Even so, the immi
nent departure of John Bravman, current
Vice Provost of Undergraduate Education,
and the transformative impact he has had on
campus life here at Stanford definitely war
rants an attempt.
Bravman's tireless commitment to under
graduates is demonstrated from the adminis
trative level to the individual lives of each un
dergrad. Bravman's ability to articulately
communicate a vision for undergraduate ed
ucation at Stanford has led to an immeasura
ble increase in the quality of resources and
programs offered to undergraduates. He
played a pivotal role in the $l.l billion Cam
paign for Undergraduate Education and was
a member of President Hennessey's Needs
Assessment Task Force. He has been a part
of hundreds of events for the Office of Un
dergraduate Admission, the Stanford Alum
ni Association and the Office of Develop
ment. He also continues to engage in the
Stanford Challenge, the $4.3 billion cam
paign that grew from the President's Task
Force. Programs from Introductory Seminars
to Sophomore College and IHUM to the
Arts Intensives emerged under his leader
ship. A more robust advising infrastructure
for all undergraduates has come along with a
stronger residential education focus.
Furthermore, Bravman helped create a
two-year residential program on campus
FroSoCo serving as its first dean and invit
ing faculty and students to weekly dinners for
the program. These are just a few of the
countless contributions and efforts Bravman
has made to the undergraduate experience at
Stanford during his term as VPUE.
Moving forward, the Editorial Board
hopes that the search committee will seek a
replacement for Bravman who can live up to
his level of commitment and involvement. As
one student will represent the entire under
graduate community on the search commit
tee, we also hope the ad hoc committee will
find ways to survey student opinion on the
issue. Simple things such as a town hall meet

ing or using digital mediums to seek student
input could go a long way towards improving
student engagement in the process.
The Editorial Board recognizes the im
pact the VPUE has on student life at Stan
ford, and we hope that a replacement is
found who can live up to this responsibility.
Someone who has served with the highest
levels of University administration
preferably on committees and task forces fo
cused on undergraduate education would
be able to smoothly transition into the VPUE
office. Perhaps even more importantly, an
empathetic and intellectual leader is needed
for the role, as the collective University must
respect and trust the strategies the VPUE
seeks to employ in order to serve the student
population.
Vice Provost Bravman has served his po
sition with dedication, initiative and an un
wavering commitment to the quality of un
dergraduate life at Stanford. The Editorial
Board recognizes that he will be a tough act
to follow, but is hopeful that his replacement
will live up to and further his legacy of en
hancing the undergraduate experience.

position with
dedication, initiative and
