Teleportation has long been a cultural
fascination and has been mainly rele
gated to the realm of science fiction. In
our modern global society, transportation of
people, goods and information is often a lim
iting factor in any transaction. While non
stop flights, next-day delivery and the Inter
net have gone a long way in aiding these
costs, anyone who has ever had a flight delay
might yearn for a machine that could instan
taneously drop you halfway around the
world without long security lines, extra bag
gage fees or snoring seatmates. It may come
as a surprise to many that teleportation not
only exists, but has been around for over a
decade now. To clarify, at present researchers
have teleported particles, but are a long way
off from the technology to teleport people.
This is probably the most technical subject
I've written about so far, so I am going to do
my best to explain the abstruse procedure
using simple metaphors, but bear with me.
The entire process of teleportation de
pends on a related concept called entangle
ment, an idea that puzzled Einstein, which he
ultimately wrote off as "spooky action at a
distance". The idea behind entanglement is
simple: that two objects that are far apart can
affect each other. As an example, imagine
you have a green and a red ball, and you put
each one in an identical box. You then give
the box to a friend who rides her bike across
campus. If you open your box, you can in
stantly infer the color of your friend's ball
based on your own, regardless of how far
away she traveled. Additionally, until either
box is opened, you can consider each ball to
be half-red and half-green at the same time,
as it is unclear which one is which. Once ei
ther box is opened, the color of both balls will
be known, and the balls are no longer consid
ered entangled.
Now comes the tricky part, and the
metaphor starts to break down a bit. Imagine
you have a box containing a ball with a 70
percent chance of being red, which you'd like
to send to your friend on the other side of
campus. You and your friend also each have
a pair of entangled boxes, containing balls of
different colors (so there are three boxes

total). You then shuffle your boxes and open
them, and call up your friend to report your
findings. With a few complex calculations
and transformations, your friend now has a
box with a 70 percent chance of containing a
red ball, exactly the box you started with.
The procedure described above is quite
difficult, and requires extensive, carefully
controlled arrays to be successful, and even
then, success is not always guaranteed. Re
searchers at Caltech were the first to success
fully teleport photons in 1998, and in 2004, re
searchers at the NIST and the University of
Innsbruck were successful in teleporting
beryllium and calcium ions. Just last January
researchers at the University of Maryland
teleported the information from a Ytterbium
ion with 90 percent accuracy over a meter
away. From our earlier metaphor, the colors
of the balls represent the quantum states of
photons and atoms, essentially pieces of in

formation that determine the makeup of a
particle. As complicated as it is to send one
atom, even sending small molecules would
require a complexity that may be years off.
Some would argue that this procedure is
not really teleportation, as it doesn't physi
cally move material from one place to anoth
er, but merely recreates the material at the
target location. This question is particularly
interesting to ethicists interested in the even
tual possibility of human teleportation. Some
would have qualms with the idea that using
the procedure defined above would effec
tively kill a person, while making a new per
son with the same characteristics elsewhere.
However, in light of the fact that every atom
in the human body is replaced over the
course of a decade or two, perhaps this idea is
not so outrageous.

Teleportation of simple atoms and pho
tons could provide huge benefits for society.
As teleportation is essentially instantaneous,
teleportation has already been demonstrat
ed to be a faster method of transmitting in
formation than conventional methods, and
could be incorporated into computer proces
sors. Additionally, using teleportation to send
information is 100 percent secure; if a ne'er
do-well in our analogy were to steal your
friend's box and open it, the entanglement
would decohere and the box would be use
less. Using entanglement could also help re
fine and improve the sensitivity of radar, tel
escopes and microscopes by more than six
orders of magnitude.
While teleporting yourself may not be a
reality for a while, in the near future, telepor
tation may very well play a huge role in your
computers, phones and bank account. I've
tried to illuminate some of the theory behind
teleportation, though the brevity The Daily
affords me has been a limiting factor. As
Stanford has a long history of Nobel Prizes in
physics, I look forward to the day where one
of you helps beam us into the future.

Jack still offers cookies to anyone finding a
mistake in a column, though at present he can't
teleport them to you. Contact him at

been mainly relegated

science fiction.
