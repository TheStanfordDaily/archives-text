Dear Editor,
The "Pipe Dreams" feature in the Daily
on April 12 is a topic that has resurfaced in
the Daily from time to time. It is important to
clarify that students and other unauthorized
personnel are not to enter steam tunnels or
other campus underground utility spaces as
they can expose entrants to serious safety
hazards including oxygen deficiency, toxic
gases, and other dangers not easily detected
by the senses. Every year, -100 worker fatal
ities in the U.S. are linked to unsafe entry into
such confined spaces (per National Institute
of Occupational Safety and Health,
http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/confined
space/).
In accordance with California's Occupa
tional Safety and Health Administration
(Cal/OSHA) regulatory standards, steam
tunnels around the Stanford Campus are
Permit Required Confined Spaces, meaning
that all personnel involved with such entry
must be specially trained and equipped to
strictly follow safety procedures.
The University's Utilities Department
stresses the importance of preventing unau
thorized entry into its underground utility
spaces. In addition to safety hazards, unlaw
ful entry into the steam tunnels could also
result in a criminal prosecution for trespass
or referral to the University's Judicial Af
fairs systems. The risks here are simply not
worth it.
