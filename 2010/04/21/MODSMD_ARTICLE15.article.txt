## FERRIS FINDS HIS WHEELS Redshirt freshman enjoys stellar season for track 
### ZACH ZIMMERMAN DESK EDITOR 
Stanford track and field has gained its fame
through its elite distance program. As a perenni
al threat to win national championships in cross
country and indoor and outdoor track, the
marathon men known informally as "The Ma
chine" have often cast a shadow over the other,
lesser-known parts of the team.
Enter redshirt freshman Dylan Ferris, the
best Stanford runner you've never heard of.
Ferris, an emerging middle distance star, has
taken the Farm and the nation by storm. With
both a sub-four-minute mile and a new personal
record in the 800 meters under his belt, the
North Carolina native has added previously
missing depth to a Cardinal team with lofty
goals.
"What we're trying to do is create a broad
team," Ferris said. "We want people scoring in
the 10k as well as the 100 [meters]. Stanford is
obviously known for its distance, and we have a
great history and great distance runners. But
there are only so many things we can do with dis
tance runners in track."
Ferris grew up in a rural area near the Tri-City
region of North Carolina. He started running
competitively in seventh grade, practicing twice
a week in preparation for a weekly competition.
He soon blossomed into an elite high school run
ner, winning the North Carolina title in the 800
meters from 2006 through 2008 as well as in the
1,600 meters in 2007 and 2008.
As one of the nation's middle distance high
school stars, Ferris recalled the thrilling yet gru
eling recruiting process.
"It was really exciting having people wanting
you to come to their school," he said. "But it
started getting tedious. The biggest thing for me
was coming to a school where weather wasn't
going to bother me. Also, when I started thinking
about my future after running, Stanford was the
best because a degree from Stanford was better
than a degree from the other schools."
Although redshirted in his freshman year,
Ferris says that he struggled at times to adjust to
the college scene. As he tried to balance the
Stanford academic workload with the grueling
practices of coach Jason Dunn, he was unable to
meet his personal expectations for his first year
on campus.
"I definitely fell short of what I wanted to
do," he said. "I spent the whole year pretty much
getting my ass kicked by my teammates. When I
came to races, I fell short of what I wanted to do.
"But I got a lot of experience and ideas of
what college was like in general," he continued.
"I'm definitely in a much better place. The help
that I got last year and the strength that I've
gained this year have made a tremendous differ-

ence in my training."
This difference has been evident
from the get-go. At the Texas A&M
Challenge in late January, Ferris ran
a personal best in the 800 meters, fin
ishing with a time of 1:48.67, good
enough for second on Stanford's all
time indoor list. Then, just a few
weeks later at the Flusky Classic in
Seattle, Ferris won the second heat
of the mile in a blazing time of
3:58.90, the sixth fastest time in Car
dinal history.
He then proceeded to net his first
All-America honor at the NCAA In
door Championships, finishing eighth

in the mile. When asked which of the
three personal achievements was the
most special, Ferris was quick to re
spond.
"I'm really happy that I ran under
four minutes for the mile. Everyone
knows what that means," he said.
As the outdoor season progresses
and the competition heats up, Ferris
continues to work. Unfazed by an
undesirable team performance at
NCAA Indoors, he looks toward the
future, setting lofty goals for both

himself and his teammates.
"This year, I definitely want to be
at [the NCAA Championships] and
be in the top four or five guys in the
country in either the [BOO meters] or
the [l5OO meters], whatever I can
do," Ferris said. "I want to win
NCAAs and hopefully be part of a
nasty distance medley relay team,
and just be able to run cross country
as well in the next three seasons."
Each Sunday, he tags along with
the distance runners for their weekly

long run. With Ferris's help, the dis
tance guys, along with the rest of the
Stanford team, could be within reach
of their ultimate goal a national
championship.
"I want to be a big presence on the
team, score points and hopefully be
part of something bigger than my
self," Ferris said. "And that is by win
ning a team title,"
