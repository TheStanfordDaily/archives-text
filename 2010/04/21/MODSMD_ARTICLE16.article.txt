# FOUR-YEAR PLAN
## Class of 2010 has led volleyball resurgence 
### CHRIS JUHNKE DESK EDITOR 
To say that the senior class of the Stanford
men's volleyball team has come a long way
since its freshman year is an understatement. In
fact, considering that the Cardinal went 3-25
overall in the 2006-2007 season also the first
year with head coach John Kosty at the helm
it would be an impressive achievement just to
have a winning record this year.
Not for the Stanford seniors though, who
merely three years later are finishing their sea
son on the highest note possible, with a Moun
tain Pacific Sports Federation (MPSF) regular
season championship and the No. 1 seed in the
MPSF Tournament.
"Coming from very successful volleyball
backgrounds to a program that was struggling
at the time was an interesting and oftentimes
difficult transition," said senior Ed Howell. "Al
though our record didn't reflect it, freshman
year, we were in every match that we played ...
figuring out how to play a complete game and
not just the first 20 points was probably the
most valuable lesson we learned after that first
year."
Stanford's five senior players Evan
Romero, Kawika Shoji, Howell, Garrett Wern
er and Jason Palacios hail from diverse back
grounds and geographic areas, from Hawaii to
Wisconsin to Miami. As a group, however, they
have bonded as they struggled through the ad
versity of losing and helped Stanford men's vol
leyball return to prominence,
"It was a goal we set for ourselves, and while
most freshman would most likely say that and
wish for that to come true, we have been fortu
nate enough to be surrounded by hardworking
individuals that have helped us achieve that
goal," said Romero, who will leave Stanford as
its career leader in kills, of going from tied for
last in the conference freshman year to winning
the conference regular season this year. "That
fact that our hard work has helped put us in a
position to achieve our ultimate goal of a na
tional championship is a blessing, and we are fo
cused and determined to complete what we
have started."
To complete its ultimate goal and win a na
tional championship, Stanford will certainly
need a lot of help from the senior class, a group
where each individual has contributed signifi
cantly to the Cardinal's success this season.
In no other case is this truer than that of
Howell, who, although he was out for the season
with an injury, stayed on as team manager and

has played an important role by energizing the
team during matches.
"One thing that I cherish the most is the
friendship that I have gained with the four other
seniors," Howell said. "I consider every one of
them my brothers, and I know they feel the
same way."
One of those "brothers," Palacios, has pro
vided solid play in crucial situations off the
bench for the Card this season. It was his serv
ice ace that put Stanford ahead for the first time
in the second set of the Senior Night match
against USC, which sparked a Cardinal run and
resulted in a two-set lead for Stanford.

Another of the seniors, Werner, has also con
tributed significantly to Stanford's success this
season, starting 24 matches for the Card and av
eraging 1.78 kills per set and 1.11 blocks per set
a number that ties him with fellow middle
blocker sophomore Gus Ellis as the team's
leader.

Rounding out the "Fab Five," as labeled by
Romero, are Romero himself and Shoji. Both
players have been standouts on the team since
the beginning, and this season has been no ex
ception.

Shoji, who is a two-time All-American set
ter, has anchored the Cardinal offense this
year, averaging 13.56 assists per set. Shoji will
leave Stanford with 4,256 assists in his career
and holds the Stanford single season assists

mark, which he set last year with 1,394.
Romero has also been a powerful force on
offense for the Cardinal, as he is the Stanford
career leader in kills with 1,694. This season in
particular, Romero has come up big when the
Card needed him. In an April 9 game against
Pepperdine, then the No. 3 ranked team in the
country, Romero recorded a career-high 37
kills and a .492 hitting percentage, carrying
Stanford to a crucial five-set win.

Now, as Stanford turns its attention to the
MPSF Tournament, and possibly to the NCAA
Tournament, the seniors have their goal from
freshman year in sight. But regardless of the
outcome, they can look back on their time at
Stanford and know that they have succeeded,
often through adversity, embodying the true
Cardinal spirit and forging a lasting bond with
their fellow seniors.

"We have faced many challenges over the
course of our four years here ... Most recently,
the loss of one of our beloved coaches, Big Al,"
Romero said. "However, all these 'obstacles'
have also led to the best of times of our journey.
We have grown together both in volleyball and
in life. The obstacles have made us bond to
gether to overcome them, and the good times
have added to the memories that we will never
forget."
