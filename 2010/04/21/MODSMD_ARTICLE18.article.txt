# FOOTBALL SPECIAL: CARDINAL & WHITE SPRING GAME
## LITTLE-KNOWN PLAYERS EMERGE FROM SPRING GAME 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
In a stark contrast to last year's contest, the
2010 Cardinal & White Spring Game featured no
touchdowns and only six combined points
through four quarters of play. Gone was Andrew
Luck's five-touchdown performance of yester
year; in its place was a combination of stout de
fense and offensive missteps. But regardless, nu
merous players shined.

Some are veterans familiar to Stanford fans.
Tom Keiser was impressive from his new outside
linebacker spot; Doug Baldwin, who has suffered
from drops in his career, was a sure-handed receiv
er for Luck; and Matt Masifilo was destructive
from his defensive end spot.
But for many of the Cardinal and White play
ers, the game served as a coming out party to fans
who had yet to see them in a good amount of ac

tion for some players, it was their first appear
ance after their initial redshirt freshman years.
Here are four (relative) newcomers that made
their presence felt on Saturday:
Shayne Skov, Inside Linebacker
Skov, a true freshman in 2009, is the most expe
rienced member of this quartet. He came on
strong at the end of last season, moving from pri
marily a special teams player to a full-time starter,
and in the process, flashed the talent that made
him the top recruit in his class. But the Spring
Game was, by far, his most dominating exhibition
to date, and gave the Cardinal faithful a clearer
look at a linebacker expected to be a perennial All-
Pac-10 player.
Skov played less than two quarters before leav
ing with a hyper-extended right knee after the
game, head coach Jim Harbaugh said that there
was no ligament damage but in that short time,

he was an obliterating force. It appeared that he
was in on nearly every tackle, and if there was a big
hit, you hardly had to look chances were, it was
Skov making his presence known. His lateral and
linear speed enabled him to close quickly on ball
carriers in space and in the backfield, and his overt
ly aggressive style added a certain panache to his
play.
He is nicknamed "The Predator" in homage to
the sci-fi franchise, and he demonstrated why on
Saturday.
Alex Debniak, Jack of All Trades
Debniak played sparingly in his freshman year
in 2008 and was poised for a breakout year in 2009
with prototypical size and speed, he was seen as
a valuable asset at linebacker. He was a star of last
year's Spring Game, as he ran for 91 yards on just
four carries as a reserve running back.
But then he injured his PCL and missed the entire

2009 season. Now, with the switch to the 3-4, he is
seen once again as an important piece of the de
fensive puzzle.
On Saturday, he played as a stand-up outside line
backer, five-technique defensive end and, once
again, as a running back. He set up the Cardinal's
lone points of the game in the first quarter, when
he fought off a block to force a Josh Nunes fumble,
which Debniak subsequently recovered; just a few
plays later, Eric Whitaker gave the Cardinal an
early 3-0 advantage. He came in as a runner in the
fourth quarter and proceeded to do his best Toby
Gerhart impression, pushing the pile seemingly at
will as he sprang downfield.
Ryan Hewitt, H-Back
When Harbaugh announced that Owen Mare
cic, one of the best fullbacks in the nation and one
of Harbaugh's favorite players, would
be playing primarily at inside linebacker
during spring ball, the question arose:
who would replace him at fullback?
Hewitt, who redshirted this season,
quickly filled the void. Recruited as a
tight end, Hewitt moved to the back
field, both because of the depth of the
TE position and the void at FB. Hewitt
is not a traditional bruiser in the Mare
cic mold, but is rather more of a versatile
receiving option. During the spring
game, he demonstrated not only his
masteiy of the playbook he was con
stantly put in motion and sent out on
short routes, and was generally open
but also some nice blocking to prevent
containment. As a receiver, he provided
a constant safety valve for Josh Nunes
and Robbie Picazo, and was used often.
Marecic is not leaving the fullback
position completely, but he will not be
able to take the same number of snaps if
he plays ILB regularly. Hewitt's per
formance during the spring, then, is an
encouraging sign.
Usua Amanam, Running Back
Amanam was the third part of a
touted running back recruiting class in
2009, but could not join Stepfan Taylor
and Tyler Gaffney in the rotation be
cause a foot injury sidelined him for the
year. In his first action in front of a legion
of fans, Amanam starred, picking up 81
total yards on the ground and through
the air. His quickness was unparalleled
on the field, and the cuts he was able to
make made him look like a seasoned,
shifty veteran. His performance as an
all-purpose back brought to mind the
role that Delano Howell filled in the
2008 season an exciting player who
could be sent all over the field.
Honorable Mentions: Brent Seals had a
couple of impressive pass breakups, in
cluding one in the front corner of the end
zone that required good closing speed to

even attempt... Ben Gardner, who is
listed at linebacker but played defensive
end for much of the game, had some nice
penetrations, including a sack of Josh
Nunes... Devin Guillory saw extensive
action late in the game for the Cardinal
squad and showed some nice moves to
shed blocks and create pressure in the
backfield... In Skov's immediate ab
sence, Brent Etiz filled in admirably, issu
ing some big hits... Terrence Stephens
had maybe the hardest collision of the af
ternoon; he smashed into Step fan Taylor
so violently on a fourth-and-two play
that it sent the White runner stumbling
backwards before he was eventually
brought down... Finally, there is, of
course, Erik Whitaker, an unknown
commodity as the backup kicker. He
shanked one kick in regulation in awful
fashion and missed another wide right,
barely, but during the field goal kick-off
and overtime, he was nearly flawless
from long distance, going 4-5 from 40-
plus, and 1-2 from 52 yards.

from long distance, going 4-5 from 40-
plus, and 1-2 from 52 yards.

In a stark contrast to last year's contest, the
2010 Cardinal & White Spring Game featured no
touchdowns and only six combined points
through four quarters of play. Gone was Andrew
Luck's five-touchdown performance of yester
year; in its place was a combination of stout de
fense and offensive missteps. But regardless, nu
merous players shined.

Some are veterans familiar to Stanford fans.
Tom Keiser was impressive from his new outside
linebacker spot; Doug Baldwin, who has suffered
from drops in his career, was a sure-handed receiv
er for Luck; and Matt Masifilo was destructive
from his defensive end spot.
But for many of the Cardinal and White play
ers, the game served as a coming out party to fans
who had yet to see them in a good amount of ac

tion for some players, it was their first appear
ance after their initial redshirt freshman years.
Here are four (relative) newcomers that made
their presence felt on Saturday:
Shayne Skov, Inside Linebacker
Skov, a true freshman in 2009, is the most expe
rienced member of this quartet. He came on
strong at the end of last season, moving from pri
marily a special teams player to a full-time starter,
and in the process, flashed the talent that made
him the top recruit in his class. But the Spring
Game was, by far, his most dominating exhibition
to date, and gave the Cardinal faithful a clearer
look at a linebacker expected to be a perennial All-
Pac-10 player.
Skov played less than two quarters before leav
ing with a hyper-extended right knee after the
game, head coach Jim Harbaugh said that there
was no ligament damage but in that short time,

he was an obliterating force. It appeared that he
was in on nearly every tackle, and if there was a big
hit, you hardly had to look chances were, it was
Skov making his presence known. His lateral and
linear speed enabled him to close quickly on ball
carriers in space and in the backfield, and his overt
ly aggressive style added a certain panache to his
play.
He is nicknamed "The Predator" in homage to
the sci-fi franchise, and he demonstrated why on
Saturday.
Alex Debniak, Jack of All Trades
Debniak played sparingly in his freshman year
in 2008 and was poised for a breakout year in 2009
with prototypical size and speed, he was seen as
a valuable asset at linebacker. He was a star of last
year's Spring Game, as he ran for 91 yards on just
four carries as a reserve running back.
But then he injured his PCL and missed the entire

2009 season. Now, with the switch to the 3-4, he is
seen once again as an important piece of the de
fensive puzzle.
On Saturday, he played as a stand-up outside line
backer, five-technique defensive end and, once
again, as a running back. He set up the Cardinal's
lone points of the game in the first quarter, when
he fought off a block to force a Josh Nunes fumble,
which Debniak subsequently recovered; just a few
plays later, Eric Whitaker gave the Cardinal an
early 3-0 advantage. He came in as a runner in the
fourth quarter and proceeded to do his best Toby
Gerhart impression, pushing the pile seemingly at
will as he sprang downfield.
Ryan Hewitt, H-Back
When Harbaugh announced that Owen Mare
cic, one of the best fullbacks in the nation and one
of Harbaugh's favorite players, would
be playing primarily at inside linebacker
during spring ball, the question arose:
who would replace him at fullback?
Hewitt, who redshirted this season,
quickly filled the void. Recruited as a
tight end, Hewitt moved to the back
field, both because of the depth of the
TE position and the void at FB. Hewitt
is not a traditional bruiser in the Mare
cic mold, but is rather more of a versatile
receiving option. During the spring
game, he demonstrated not only his
masteiy of the playbook he was con
stantly put in motion and sent out on
short routes, and was generally open
but also some nice blocking to prevent
containment. As a receiver, he provided
a constant safety valve for Josh Nunes
and Robbie Picazo, and was used often.
Marecic is not leaving the fullback
position completely, but he will not be
able to take the same number of snaps if
he plays ILB regularly. Hewitt's per
formance during the spring, then, is an
encouraging sign.
Usua Amanam, Running Back
Amanam was the third part of a
touted running back recruiting class in
2009, but could not join Stepfan Taylor
and Tyler Gaffney in the rotation be
cause a foot injury sidelined him for the
year. In his first action in front of a legion
of fans, Amanam starred, picking up 81
total yards on the ground and through
the air. His quickness was unparalleled
on the field, and the cuts he was able to
make made him look like a seasoned,
shifty veteran. His performance as an
all-purpose back brought to mind the
role that Delano Howell filled in the
2008 season an exciting player who
could be sent all over the field.
Honorable Mentions: Brent Seals had a
couple of impressive pass breakups, in
cluding one in the front corner of the end
zone that required good closing speed to

even attempt... Ben Gardner, who is
listed at linebacker but played defensive
end for much of the game, had some nice
penetrations, including a sack of Josh
Nunes... Devin Guillory saw extensive
action late in the game for the Cardinal
squad and showed some nice moves to
shed blocks and create pressure in the
backfield... In Skov's immediate ab
sence, Brent Etiz filled in admirably, issu
ing some big hits... Terrence Stephens
had maybe the hardest collision of the af
ternoon; he smashed into Step fan Taylor
so violently on a fourth-and-two play
that it sent the White runner stumbling
backwards before he was eventually
brought down... Finally, there is, of
course, Erik Whitaker, an unknown
commodity as the backup kicker. He
shanked one kick in regulation in awful
fashion and missed another wide right,
barely, but during the field goal kick-off
and overtime, he was nearly flawless
from long distance, going 4-5 from 40-
plus, and 1-2 from 52 yards.
