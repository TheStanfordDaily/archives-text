# FOOTBALL SPECIAL: CARDINAL & WHITE SPRING GAME
## LITTLE-KNOWN PLAYERS EMERGE FROM SPRING GAME 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
In a stark contrast to last year's contest, the
2010 Cardinal & White Spring Game featured no
touchdowns and only six combined points
through four quarters of play. Gone was Andrew
Luck's five-touchdown performance of yester
year; in its place was a combination of stout de
fense and offensive missteps. But regardless, nu
merous players shined.

Some are veterans familiar to Stanford fans.
Tom Keiser was impressive from his new outside
linebacker spot; Doug Baldwin, who has suffered
from drops in his career, was a sure-handed receiv
er for Luck; and Matt Masifilo was destructive
from his defensive end spot.
But for many of the Cardinal and White play
ers, the game served as a coming out party to fans
who had yet to see them in a good amount of ac

tion for some players, it was their first appear
ance after their initial redshirt freshman years.
Here are four (relative) newcomers that made
their presence felt on Saturday:
Shayne Skov, Inside Linebacker
Skov, a true freshman in 2009, is the most expe
rienced member of this quartet. He came on
strong at the end of last season, moving from pri
marily a special teams player to a full-time starter,
and in the process, flashed the talent that made
him the top recruit in his class. But the Spring
Game was, by far, his most dominating exhibition
to date, and gave the Cardinal faithful a clearer
look at a linebacker expected to be a perennial All-
Pac-10 player.
Skov played less than two quarters before leav
ing with a hyper-extended right knee after the
game, head coach Jim Harbaugh said that there
was no ligament damage but in that short time,

he was an obliterating force. It appeared that he
was in on nearly every tackle, and if there was a big
hit, you hardly had to look chances were, it was
Skov making his presence known. His lateral and
linear speed enabled him to close quickly on ball
carriers in space and in the backfield, and his overt
ly aggressive style added a certain panache to his
play.
He is nicknamed "The Predator" in homage to
the sci-fi franchise, and he demonstrated why on
Saturday.
Alex Debniak, Jack of All Trades
Debniak played sparingly in his freshman year
in 2008 and was poised for a breakout year in 2009
with prototypical size and speed, he was seen as
a valuable asset at linebacker. He was a star of last
year's Spring Game, as he ran for 91 yards on just
four carries as a reserve running back.
But then he injured his PCL and missed the entire

2009 season. Now, with the switch to the 3-4, he is
seen once again as an important piece of the de
fensive puzzle.
On Saturday, he played as a stand-up outside line
backer, five-technique defensive end and, once
again, as a running back. He set up the Cardinal's
lone points of the game in the first quarter, when
he fought off a block to force a Josh Nunes fumble,
which Debniak subsequently recovered; just a few
plays later, Eric Whitaker gave the Cardinal an
early 3-0 advantage. He came in as a runner in the
fourth quarter and proceeded to do his best Toby
Gerhart impression, pushing the pile seemingly at
will as he sprang downfield.
