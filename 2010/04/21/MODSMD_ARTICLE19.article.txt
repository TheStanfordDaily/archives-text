# Could U.S. sports take over globe?
## 
### Tom Taylor 
All other sports are just
entertainment, soccer
is a force of nature. It's
a true global phenom
enon that both unites
and divides the world's population,
and every four years sends TV audi
ences through the roof. Over 5.6 bil
lion people watched live matches in
the 2006 World Cup and almost 300
million tuned in for the final.
It has caused international inci
dents (the blatant handball by French
striker Thierry Henry last year soured
relations between France and Ire
land) and even wars (the 100-hour
Football War between El Salvador
and Honduras). Yet it has also been
credited for breaking down barriers,
the most famous example being a
game played by British and German
soldiers in no-man's-land between
the trenches on Christmas Day, 1915.
This June, the 19th Football World
Cup will take place in South Africa,
but while the rest of the world is brac
ing itself for the onset of football
fever, America stands alone. How and
why, I don't quite understand. Un
questionably the U.S. could decide to
become a real competitor. It has the
facilities, the money and the patriotic
fervor to be up there with the very
best of them. If America really, really
wanted to win the World Cup it would
happen. Maybe not this tournament,
or even the next, but a team with the
full force of the USA behind it would
become a world beater.
The problem is, I don't think
America really wants this. But the
USA cannot isolate itself from inter
national sport forever, so I say you
have two options: If you won't join us,
beat us. Take one of your sports and
turn it truly global.
But could any American sport
ever really match soccer? There are
only four U.S. sports that could
maybe fit the bill: baseball, (Ameri
can) football, (ice) hockey and bas
ketball.
These are all big and all team sports,
both important factors since they al
ready have some global recognition
and people want to support a
team/country rather than an individ
ual.
I don't see baseball, however, as a
serious prospect. Apart from the per
ceived arrogance of calling its princi
pal national competition the "World
Series," games are too long and I just
cannot get past the comedy giant
gloves. A cricket ball is actually hard
er than a baseball and moves at simi
lar speeds, yet cricket players are
quite adept at catching it with bare
hands, albeit incurring the odd bro
ken finger. For this reason alone,
baseball would struggle to win over
any of the one billion cricket fans in
India.
Football is also not a good choice.
Games are far too long with far too
many drawn-out breaks from the ac
tion, and the Super Bowl is honestly a
pretty boring affair because of this
and a lot of people only watch it for
the commercials. It also has too many
obscure rules and the players have far
too narrow roles on the field. Some
spend pretty much their entire career
just attempting to move forward a
couple of feet and never seem trusted
with handling the ball.
So it's between hockey and bas
ketball. Both are fast-paced games
where pretty much every player can
be called on to play offense and de
fense in the space of a few seconds.
Even as a complete novice it's easy to
get drawn into a tight game.
Hockey, though, has two major
disadvantages. The first is equipment.
You need to either live somewhere
really cold or have an indoor ice rink
nearby, and so immediately most of
the world is excluded. It might be
pretty popular in North America and
Northern Europe, but there is no
chance of street kids in some poor
third-world country playing a pickup
game. The second is fighting. Simply
put, it's a joke. In any other sport the
players would be sent off and banned
for a very long time for what they get
away with in hockey. Until the game
sorts this problem out, its global am
bitions will be limited.
And that leaves basketball. The
good news is that, after making ene
mies by ripping the other three to
shreds, I have a very different opinion
of its prospects.
A Basketball World Cup could
just maybe oust soccer from the glob
al consciousness, if only for a while. It
is not an easy task, though, and the
fact that I only discovered while writ
ing this column that a world champi
onship actually exists, and plays its
