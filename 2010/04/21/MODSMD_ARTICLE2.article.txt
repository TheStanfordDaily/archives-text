When Flora Wang 'l3 went look
ing for an on-campus job, she found
many listings were only for students
who qualified for federal work study.
Wang was in luck: per her Free
Application for Federal Student Aid
(FAFSA) paperwork, the govern

for personal reasons.
According to Morrison, many
lower-income students have so many
scholarships that they don't actually
need to work. Those who do work
usually average no more than 12
hours per week during the school
