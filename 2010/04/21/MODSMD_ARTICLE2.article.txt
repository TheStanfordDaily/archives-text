When Flora Wang 'l3 went look
ing for an on-campus job, she found
many listings were only for students
who qualified for federal work study.
Wang was in luck: per her Free
Application for Federal Student Aid
(FAFSA) paperwork, the govern
ment determined that she was eligi
ble for an on-campus job funded by
federal dollars.
Now an employee in the office of
the Bing Overseas Studies Program,
she said "it was important for [the of
fice] to hire federal work-study stu
dents because it alleviated the finan
cial pressures on them."
Wang is one of some 400 Stanford
students who hold a federal work
study job, according to Mary Morri
son, the director of funds manage
ment for the Office of Financial Aid.
Flow many more qualify for the pro
gram is difficult to determine, Morri
son said.
What is clear is that work is avail
able for federally eligible students.
"The students who have the fed
eral funding do not have a problem
finding jobs," Morrison said.
Not all on-campus jobs are feder
ally funded, however, Morrison said.
"There are jobs on campus that
have nothing to do with what we
consider to be work study," she said.
The key point of distinction is
where the funding originates. For
federal work study, students are paid
primarily by the government, with
the Provost's office covering the rest;
other on-campus jobs are funded by
a scattering of University, public and
private units.

Not all students take advantage
of the work. Some have outside
scholarships, or decide not to work
for personal reasons.
According to Morrison, many
lower-income students have so many
scholarships that they don't actually
need to work. Those who do work
usually average no more than 12
hours per week during the school
year to avoid interfering with aca-
demies and extracurricular activities.
For students looking for jobs,
many on-campus employers simply
announce if they only hire those who
qualify for federal work study, and
check applicants' eligibility.
"During my search for a job on
campus, a lot of jobs said ... federal
work study students only or fed
eral work study students [were] pre
ferred," Wang said.

For those students who do not
qualify for federal work study, jobs
can be found through the Career De
velopment Center (CDC). Lance
Choy, the center's director, points
students to the online database
called Cardinal Careers.
While Cardinal Careers had more
than 8,000 listings during the 2008-09
school year, not all departments list
their jobs there. Many of these list
ings are for summer jobs, off-campus

work or
alumni.
"Many
times, profes
sors and staff
don't take the
time to post
jobs," Choy
wrote in an e
mail to The Daily.
"The proactive and
persistent job seeker
can find many
opportunities
that are
never listed."
Still, the
number of stu
dents with on
campus jobs,
both federally
funded and not, is dif
ficult for any single
individual to assess.

The number of listings in Cardinal
Careers has declined from more
than 13,000 opportunities during the
2006-07 school year a decrease
Choy said may be attributed to the

economic
recession's ef
fect on the job
market.
For now,
those guaranteed
a job by federal
calculations have
less to worry about,
thanks in part to
stimulus money that
helped sustain Stan
ford's work
study program,
according to
Morrison.
And some, in
cluding Wang, are
happy with the
arrangement.
"My friends at
Northwestern that
are on federal work
study get paid $8 an

hour," she said,"and I get paid $l2 an
hour."
