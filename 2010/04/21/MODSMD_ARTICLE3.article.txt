# Fewer coterms?
## Departments discuss ups, downs of fifth-year apps 
### CASSANDRA FELICIANO STAFF WRITER 
Records for the number of
coterminal degree applications re
ceived this year reveal a slight de
crease from previous years, accord
ing to some University depart
ments running contrary to wor
ries that a tough job market would
bring more "coterm" students back
this fall, possibly impacting gradu
ate housing.
Administrators attribute the de
cline to myriad reasons; in some
cases, applications are up, and the
drop rate also varies across depart
ments.
Biology has determined that its

numbers have steadily declined
since 2005, though only by a few ap
plications each year. This year, 16
students submitted applications
and 14 were granted admission.
Valerie Kiszka,the department's
student services officer, said that
she was surprised at what these sta
tistics showed, especially because
the department has made efforts to
cut some of its requirements, such
as the GRE exam.

"The faculty assumed that that
would increase our applications,"
she said. "We were all under the as
sumption that the number was
growing. My only guess is that, be
tween pre-med advising and the ad
vising that faculty and staff do in

the department [ . . . ] students are
realizing that they don't need to
coterm to get into medical school."
Students in previous years had
thought that, Kiszka added.
On the other hand, sociology,
which has changed its application
process multiple times in the last
five years, has had a much harder
time describing the slope of the
trend. The department's student
services officer, Sarah Giberman,
said on average, she receives about
40 applications per year.
Although that seems to be a
higher figure compared to other de
partments, even that number has
recently dwindled down by one or
two from last year.

"We started requiring the GRE,
so I think that some people that
would have applied maybe didn't
apply this year," she said.
But in some departments, there
are increases.

Patrick Ferguson, the student
services specialist in the mechanical
engineering department, said there
has been a 72 percent increase in

Applications to the coterminal degree program in biology have been declining;
sociology may be following suit, say administrators. Other departments, such as
mechanical engineering, have seen increases in fifth-year masters' applications.
