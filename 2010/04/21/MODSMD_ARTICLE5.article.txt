## Senators to successors: stick around Jensen says he will drop Berlin program; on-campus bill passes 
### ZOE RICHARDS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The ASSU Undergraduate Senate con
sidered a second plea on Tuesday to amend
a bill mandating the on-campus presence
of senators for the duration of their terms,
starting with the 13th Senate in fall 2011.
Senator Anton Zietsman 'l2 tried to
make an amendment last week that would
apply the bill to the recently elected 12th
Senate namely forcing Senator-elect
Ben Jensen 'l2 to decide between a quar
ter abroad or a seat on the Senate.
After a straw poll last week revealed
Zietsman was alone in his stance, he came
prepared to roll with the punches yester
day.
Armed with a formal speech, he out
lined issues of both ethics and efficacy as
key reasons why the bill ought to be effec
tive immediately. Zietsman claimed to
have received the support of "many" stu
dents for the proposed amendment.
"You cannot adequately represent and
advocate on behalf of your constituents
when you are more than 3,000 miles from
campus," he said, adding, "the notion that
Skyping in is an acceptable substitute for a
physical presence is ludicrous."
Zietsman denied the amendment
was a "personal attack" on Jensen.
He said a personal conflict between
serving office and a fall quarter at
Stanford in Washington had dashed
his initial plans to run for re-election.
"For me to exercise such restraint
upon myself and then witness others
fail to do so," Zietsman said, "is
something that I have experienced
as profoundly frustrating and funda
mentally unjust."
Jensen to Withdraw from Berlin
Program
Jensen said after some hesitation
that he has decided to withdraw from
the Berlin program for fall quarter so
he can remain on campus to fulfill his
duties as a senator. He said he would
apply to spend spring quarter of his
term in Berlin.

"The issues I'm going to work
with next year are vital for me to be
on campus," Jensen said.

He has until May 31 to submit his
intention to withdraw.

After a second straw poll, the
amendment had garnered the sup
port of four other senators, three of
whom have served part their terms
away from campus. Zachary Warma
'll and Adam Creasman 'll, who
made Skype calls from the east coast,
for example, supported Zietsman's
amendment.
But the amendment failed under
the weight of eight senators who re
mained unconvinced that the bill
should apply to the incoming Senate.
Administration and Rules Chair
Alex Katz 'l2 ultimately rejected the
amendment for a second time.
Sans amendment, the ratified bill
passed, preventing any senator from
spending time abroad or off-campus
for extended periods of time, effec
tive with the 13th Senate.
Executive Cabinet Salaries Central
to Budget Talks
As the Senate prepares its own
budget for next year and considers
the budget of the ASSU at large,
some members called into question
the contrast between executive cabi
net member pay with that of other

student leaders on campus, especial
ly in light of a bill the Senate recent -

ly passed to cut back significantly on
senator paychecks.
Katz, who has advocated against
the use of ASSU money for student
government salaries, said he is like
ly to submit a detailed amendment

for the body's consideration next
week.

ASSU President-elect Angelina
Cardona 'll suggested that she and
incoming Vice President Kelsei
Wharton 'l2, a current senator, have
already reallocated between $4,000
and $5,000 from cabinet salaries to

the discretionary budget and are in
the midst of considering other ad
justments.
While current ASSU President
David Gobaud, a coterminal student
in computer science, has offered por
tions of his own executive salary to
cabinet initiatives, the precedent is
not necessarily expected or recom
mended, said ASSU Financial Man
ager Matt McLaughlin 'OB.
Moving Toward Transition
The Senate continues to waffle
about an appropriate time for its dis
solution. While Katz and Zietsman
shared similar sentiments about a
later transition date, pushing it back
until the second half of the quarter,
others urged a more rapid turnover
of the senatorial reins.
In other business, McLaughlin
said that despite numerous compli
cations to the refund process, the ef
fort to return the $l4 in special fees
overcharged to each student last
year is underway.
All funding bills for the meeting
were passed.

The Senate meeting on Tuesday included calls via Skype from two senators
on the east coast, including Zachary Warma '11, left. The group passed a bill
that requires senators to stay on campus for their terms, effective in fall 2011.
