## Picture emerges of judicial debate on rape cases New mandatory program, a pilot, divided board members 
### ELIZABETH TITUS MANAGING EDITOR 
In their attempt to make sexual assault vic
tims more comfortable pursuing disciplinary
cases against their attackers, members of the
Board on Judicial Affairs debated how to pro
tect the interests of both parties, and the role
of the University in ensuring the best practices
for handling sensitive cases.

When the Board on Judicial Affairs devel
oped this year a new disciplinary process for
students accused of "sexual misconduct," dis
agreement arose over whether or not to make
the new plan which does not allow those

students to request an open panel hearing
mandatory.

Three board members said no, arguing that
such a departure from the current disciplinary
process should get ASSU and Faculty Senate
approval before the University president con
siders it.

But nine other board members voted on
April 6, after discussion for the better part of a
year, to send the plan straight to President
John Hennessy, who signed the mandatory
pilot program into existence last week. It will
remain in effect until December 2011, when
the board is set to reconsider it.

The new plan is expected to be swifter,
more private and more closely aligned with
the "best practices" of other universities deal
ing with student misconduct or at least the
board hopes. Perhaps now, more reported sex
ual assault victims will feel at ease in the sys

tern than in recent years.
But with the new process, a one-year pilot,
coming after 13 years of what some called a
"broken" system, board members are waiting
to see: will it work?
New Ground Rules
The former process allowed accused stu
dents to request an open hearing; it also called
for a panel of six people to hear cases of rela
tionship abuse, stalking or sexual assault and
harassment, which the pilot program covers.
And it allowed the alleged victim and offend
er to cross-examine each other directly.
Those features discouraged victims from
pursuing cases against offending students in
Judicial Affairs, according to board members,
panelists and members of Stanford's Sexual
Assault Advisory Board. In 2006 and 2007,
they note, 24 "sexual offenses" were reported

to campus police; eight cases were counted by
Judicial Affairs around the same time, during
academic years 2005-06 and 2006-07.
And the number of cases Judicial Affairs
heard where a student might be found re
sponsible for a Fundamental Standard viola
tion and face consequences from the Univer
sity is fewer than the number reported to
the office, according to Judicial Advisor Jamie
Pontius-Flogan, who would not disclose exact
figures.
Now, say board co-chair Nate Chambers, a
graduate student in computer science, and Ju
dicial Affairs staff, Stanford's disciplinary
process more closely mirrors the "best prac
tices" of other schools when it comes to accu
sations of sexual violence among students.
