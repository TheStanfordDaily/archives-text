## Picture emerges of judicial debate on rape cases New mandatory program, a pilot, divided board members 
### ELIZABETH TITUS MANAGING EDITOR 
In their attempt to make sexual assault vic
tims more comfortable pursuing disciplinary
cases against their attackers, members of the
Board on Judicial Affairs debated how to pro
tect the interests of both parties, and the role
of the University in ensuring the best practices
for handling sensitive cases.

When the Board on Judicial Affairs devel
oped this year a new disciplinary process for
students accused of "sexual misconduct," dis
agreement arose over whether or not to make
the new plan which does not allow those

students to request an open panel hearing
mandatory.

Three board members said no, arguing that
such a departure from the current disciplinary
process should get ASSU and Faculty Senate
approval before the University president con
siders it.

But nine other board members voted on
April 6, after discussion for the better part of a
year, to send the plan straight to President
John Hennessy, who signed the mandatory
pilot program into existence last week. It will
remain in effect until December 2011, when
the board is set to reconsider it.

The new plan is expected to be swifter,
more private and more closely aligned with
the "best practices" of other universities deal
ing with student misconduct or at least the
board hopes. Perhaps now, more reported sex
ual assault victims will feel at ease in the sys

tern than in recent years.
But with the new process, a one-year pilot,
coming after 13 years of what some called a
"broken" system, board members are waiting
to see: will it work?
New Ground Rules
The former process allowed accused stu
dents to request an open hearing; it also called
for a panel of six people to hear cases of rela
tionship abuse, stalking or sexual assault and
harassment, which the pilot program covers.
And it allowed the alleged victim and offend
er to cross-examine each other directly.
Those features discouraged victims from
pursuing cases against offending students in
Judicial Affairs, according to board members,
panelists and members of Stanford's Sexual
Assault Advisory Board. In 2006 and 2007,
they note, 24 "sexual offenses" were reported

to campus police; eight cases were counted by
Judicial Affairs around the same time, during
academic years 2005-06 and 2006-07.
And the number of cases Judicial Affairs
heard where a student might be found re
sponsible for a Fundamental Standard viola
tion and face consequences from the Univer
sity is fewer than the number reported to
the office, according to Judicial Advisor Jamie
Pontius-Flogan, who would not disclose exact
figures.
Now, say board co-chair Nate Chambers, a
graduate student in computer science, and Ju
dicial Affairs staff, Stanford's disciplinary
process more closely mirrors the "best prac
tices" of other schools when it comes to accu
sations of sexual violence among students.
Four people three students and one fac-
ulty or staff member make up a
panel in the new process, lending
greater privacy to the case, board
members said. Open hearings are not
allowed, and alleged victims and of
fenders submit questions to a Judicial
Affairs investigator, who then choos
es which questions to ask each party.

Associate Vice Provost for Stu
dent Affairs Chris Griffith also said
panelists will be trained for "greater
privacy and sensitivity."
Board co-chair Lynn Hildemann,
a professor in civil and environment
engineering, said she had participat
ed in a sample training, which in
volved "expert speakers and discus
sions and exercises all aimed at giving
the panelists a greater understanding
of what the perspective is of the in
volved parties and especially what

unusual behaviors you might see the
student filing the complaint show."
The larger pool of Judicial Affairs
student panelists some 75 ap
pointed by the Nominations Com
mission every year may opt in to
the additional training, which would
make them eligible to hear sexual as
sault cases.

The new process may also be
swifter: it generally requires the Judi
cial Affairs investigator to compile a
case file within 30 days of a com
plaint before a panel reviews it. Pre
viously, sexual assault cases would
join the backlog of other cases, rang
ing from cheating to drunk driving.
The average delay last year, accord
ing to Judicial Advisor Morris
Graves, was 19 weeks.
The panels' meetings may also be
more bearable, Graves said.
"Let me just briefly describe for
you [the] worst-case scenario under
the old process: a hearing that takes
13 hours," Graves said. "And at the
end of a 10 hour period, the panel has

determined that the student is re
sponsible, and now they're moving in
to determine what the appropriate
sanction should be."

Panels are expected to do their
work over a period of several meet
ings now.

Mandatory or Not?
Sitting next to his faculty counter
part Hildemann and Judicial Affairs
staff, Chambers chose his words
slowly as he explained the push to
mandate the new process.
"If this wasn't mandatory, it was
argued that the responding student
the one accused would basical
ly always choose to do the current
process because it's in their favor,"
Chambers said.

Brandon Jackson 'l2, one of three
students who voted against the plan,
which is known as the Alternate Re
view Process, disagreed.
"This process always seeks to pro
vide privacy both for the responding
student and the impacted party,

which is, in my opinion, more of a
reason they would actually choose
this new process," Jackson said. "The
bottom line is they should have this
choice and not be forced into it."

That the mandatory process does
not include an option for the accused
student to request an open hearing
was a reason, Jackson said, for the
board to send the proposal through
the regular channels of a Student Ju
dicial Charter change the ASSU
legislative bodies, the Faculty Senate
and only then the University presi
dent.

But the board chose in a 9-3 vote
to exercise another section of the
charter that gives the University
president authority to enforce stu
dent conduct rules. ASSU President
David Gobaud, a coterminal student
in computer science, and Graduate
Student Council co-chair Eric Os
borne, a law student, were shown a
late draft of the plan for input, ac
cording to Chambers.

If the board chooses to make the

pilot program a permanent one in
December 2011, it would undergo
the regular charter change process,
staff said.
Changing the Guard
By that time, new students will sit
on the Board of Judicial Affairs. The
Nominations Commission recently
announced its incoming roster; those
seven nominees, after ASSU legisla
tive confirmation, will select next
year's judicial board members.
Last spring, the commission's first
nominations were resisted by the Of
fice of Judicial Affairs, who said
more women needed to be nominat
ed to the board. Plans for the sexual
assault overhaul were in motion at
the time.
After weeks of legislative discus
sion, a new set of students three
women and three men were nom
inated and confirmed.
