## Researchers find electricity-plant link 
### JOSHUA FALK 
A team of Stanford engineers has
managed to harness electrical energy
directly from algae cells. The re
searchers believe that this result rep
resents the first step toward generat
ing "high efficiency" electricity from
living plants.
The research team, headed by
WonHyoung Ryu and Stanford me
chanical engineering professor Fritz
Prinz, published its findings in the
March issue of Nano Letters.
The researchers generated an
electrical current by inserting tiny
gold nanoprobes into individual liv
ing algae cells, extracting electrons
that the cells had produced during
photosynthesis.
During photosynthesis, plants con
vert sunlight to chemical energy in the
plant's chloroplast. This chemical en
ergy is stored in the form of sugar
bonds. Plants generate electrons
when their chloroplasts break water
into oxygen, protons and electrons.
When sunlight reaches the chloro
plast, these electrons are excited and
are subsequently picked up by pro
teins, which use the electrons' energy
to synthesize sugars.
The Stanford team intercepted
the electrons once they had been ex
cited by sunlight and before the pro
teins had begun to use their energy to
synthesize sugars.
According to the study, harvesting
electrons directly from plant cells
"potentially reduces energy losses as
sociated with the multistep transfor
mation of solar energy into products
used for the production of biodiesel
and bioelectricity."
While biofuel combustion typical
ly only yields three to six percent of a
plant's stored solar energy, the Stan
ford study's electron harvest yielded
20 percent. Electron harvesting could
theoretically occur with 100 percent
efficiency, Ryu said in an interview
with the Stanford News Service.
And unlike burning biofuels or
biomass, there is no carbon released
in electron harvesting, making the
process not only efficient but also
green.
But the team's research is still in
its infancy. Practical implementation
of their research, if it is possible, is still
years away.
The research is still "in its very
early scientific stage and many things
need to be understood," Ryu said in
an e-mail to The Daily.
Gary Brudvig, a professor of mo
lecular biophysics and biochemistry
at Yale, predicted in an e-mail to The
Daily that most in the scientific com
munity "would feel that this is an in
teresting result that may never have
practical applications."
"I feel that the work is a proof of
concept," said Arthur Grossman, one
of the paper's authors and a re

searcher in the Department of Plant
Biology at the Carnegie Institution
and the Department of Biology at
Stanford, in an e-mail to The Daily.
"There is still a lot that would need to
be done to develop this work more in
order to make it practical... so we
are only at the very beginning of the
development of this concept."
WonHyoung Ryu, now a profes
sor at Yonsei University in Seoul car
ried out the study while a research as
sociate for Prinz, who was unavail
able for comment while stuck in Eu
rope this week because of grounded
flights.
The project received funding from

the Global Climate and Energy Pro
ject at Stanford and from the Yonsei
University Research Fund of 2009.
The research team also includes
Seoung-Jai Bai, Tibor Fabian, Rainer
J. Fasching, Zubin Huang and Joong
Sun Park, all researchers at the Rapid
Prototyping Laboratory for Energy
and Biology at Stanford; and Arthur
R. Grossman and Jeffrey Moseley,
both researchers in the Department
of Plant Biology at the Carnegie Insti
tution and Department of Biological
Sciences at Stanford.
