The Program in Human Biology is an interschool, interdepartmental, undergraduate major.
The program's mission is to provide an interdisciplinary approach to understanding the human being
from biological, behavioral, social, and cultural perspectives.
The program seeks: (a) to provide a broad and rigorous introduction to the biological and
behavioral sciences and their interrelationships, and (b) to explore how this knowledge, in
conjunction with studies in other fields, can be applied to analyze and formulate health,
environmental, and other public policies that influence human welfare.
To achieve these goals, all students complete a 30-unit core sequence, normally in the
sophomore year that provides the foundation for the major. Also during the sophomore year, students
consult with student advisers to choose a faculty adviser and complete the declaration process.
Together they plan a roadmap of course work designed to help each student focus on an area of
interest within Human Biology. Early planning and subsequent refining of an individualized course
of study, in consultation with student and faculty advisers, is a strength and requirement of the
program.
The curriculum draws on faculty from across the University. To complete a B.A. in Human
Biology, students must take courses from within the program and from other University departments.
Most Human Biology majors go on to advanced training in professional schools, or graduate
programs in the behavioral, natural, and social sciences, including co-terminal master's degree
programs in other University departments. Additional information about the major may be obtained
from the program's offices or at http://humbio.stanford.edu/.
Wc look forward to seeing you!
