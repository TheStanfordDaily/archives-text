# OPINIONS
## ADVENTURES IN ACADEMIA Hopes and Dreams in a Stanford Education 
### Danny Crichton 
Three years ago, a young and wide-eyed
high school senior (who happened to
be me) first visited the campus of a gor
geous university nestled in the foothills of the
Silicon Valley. Stanford was an imposing in
stitution with that Palm Drive view, and the
students seemed to be uniformly smart -
smarter than me.

I made the decision to attend this school,
despite the storied rains of Admit Weekend
2007.1 am grateful for that decision and for
my time here so far. Reflecting back, I want
to share some thoughts on that decision, and
in the process, help all the ProFros here this
weekend prepare for one of the most forma
tive stages of their lives.
First, this decision is not the most impor
tant one you will ever make. All the top col
leges of America are strong schools, each
with their own strengths and weaknesses. To
an enormous degree, your fit in a university
will greatly determine your final perform
ance. If you enjoy the school you attend, your
next four years will be interesting and mem
orable - and I would argue more successful.
But what is "fit"? For me, it is being sur
rounded by energetic, ambitious, entrepre
neurial and interesting people who want to
change the world and throw out the old par
adigms. Stanford has been a perfect match
for me in this regard.

There is also the need to fit into an aca
demic community at Stanford. Since the vast
majority of students change their major dur
ing their freshman year as they explore new
fields, it is incredibly important that there are
a wide variety of strong departments to pro
vide options for majoring. Stanford was a
match for me in this regard as well. Even
though I changed my major a handful of
times, I was never at a loss for a new academ
ic home with an incredible department and
interesting faculty.
To sense the fit for yourself, avail yourself
of the faculty at department open houses,
and make sure to talk to your fellow ProFros
and current students. At least once this week
end, try to have a lengthy conversation with a
small group of individuals, probably at night
after all of the planned activities have con
cluded. These are the meat of a liberal arts
education, and few things this weekend will
decide your fate faster than finding someone
with as much passion as yourself.
I truly belie ve that any of the top universi
ties in the country can produce exceptional
students. However, if fit has not helped in
making your decision, then other factors
must be considered.
There are differences between Stanford
and some of our peer schools. I feel as though
we are younger, more nimble and more en
trepreneurial. We do not have as much of an
ivory tower feel, although the Bubble can
creep in. Stanford is the model of the twenty
first century research university for much of
the rest of the country. Just look at how
schools like Harvard, Princeton and Duke
have changed their campuses. These schools
and more like them hope to do what Stanford
has already done - to be at the center of soci
etal change by being the fundamental incu
bator of new ideas and theories and bringing
such knowledge into practice.
It begins with interdisciplinary studies,
and, thankfully, these are a hallmark of an ed
ucation here at Stanford. We do not teach a

single paradigm, but rather many of them,
with the goal of introducing a broad educa
tion to every undergraduate. This is the rea
son why majors like human biology, public
policy, and mathematical and computational
sciences are so popular - they allow the ex
ploration of a scholarly idea from multiple
perspectives.
If there is one aspect that I still feel makes
Stanford different, it is the culture. There is
something unique about the Bay Area that
makes this region thrive like none other.
There is competition, but camaraderie. Peo
ple can have brilliant failures, but also bril
liant successes - and both are considered
valuable. We have a culture of learning from
the past, but not allowing the past to hold up
the future. Plus, the Bay Area refuses to cre
ate rigid hierarchies. This kind of environ
ment is what created the Internet, and it is the
foundation for all of the incredible advances
Stanford is currently developing.
Reflecting back, I made the right choice to
attend because it felt good to be on this cam
pus - as it still does. The dynamism and ener
gy never gets old, and you are looking at the
school that truly is solving the biggest prob
lems of our time (maybe the solution will
come from you?) Take in the festivities of
Admit Weekend, and then go home and fill
out that sheet.
