# ALTERNATIVE LIVING... WITHOUT THE NAKED
## Love, Time and the Zero Sum Game 
### Samantha Toh 
I spent today lounging on a red couch at a
cafe in Palo Alto, curled up in a ball, read
ing and sipping tea. This past week, I have
gone ice skating, talked about Las Vegas on a
porch in the sun, eaten sushi and climbed a
roof to watch the stars. Unlike jumping off a
plane, all these activities do not seem partic
ularly extraordinary. At the same time, these
moments have crystallized into something
worthy of remembering, if only because they
were initiated by somebody else.
There is a lot to be said about proactivity
and reciprocity. I believe that most of the
world exists not as singular, free-floating
atoms. Rather, we clump together in giant
molecular chunks of matter. While this
metaphor is arguably terrible, what I mean to
say is that few people can exist independent
ly of other humans, and much of what holds
us and society together is affirmation. Seek
ing people out, wanting to spend time with
them, and affirming the need for their pres
ence also, in away, affirms their existence and
their importance.
This way of thinking about human rela
tions has framed the way I approach people,
which is to say, with great amounts of passion.
After all, people do many things to relax.
They listen to music, they watch movies, they
look at videos of kittens on Youtube ... and
while I do devote some time to music, movies
and kitty videos, a large part of my time and
energy is devoted to people. Finding out
about people their personal histories,
opinions and ideas is what really makes
life meaningful for me, I can drop whatever I
am doing to listen to somebody's problems. I
will give up opportunities to make money or
gain fame to further understand and better
love people. And aside from the fame part,
where I have yet to be made an offer to be
Hollywood's new Lucy Liu, these are all
things that I have done and will continue to
do, however much giving up tangible rewards
may seem like an extremely stupid decision
to those around me.

My overwhelming priority placed on peo
ple, however, sparked off a crisis, the back
ground of which lay in my belief that com

pletely equal reciprocation in any relation
ship should not matter. For example, Sam di
rects all her energies toward hypothetical
person Miriam. Miriam, at first, thinks Sam is
a strange creature. Until the point where
Miriam thinks Sam is as cool as Sam thinks
Miriam is cool, Sam loves Miriam more than
Miriam loves Sam. In this sense, friendship is
unequal and love is unequal.

But does this matter? Sam can derive af
firmation of her importance from other
sources, and because love, I believe, is not a
zero sum game, affection for Miriam should
not reduce Sam's capacity to have affection
for others. Talking about myself in hypothet
ical third person aside, I also believe that en
suring constant equality in a relationship, and
consequently attempting to calculate human
emotion, is both petty and impossible. As a
result, I often spent my time keeping tabs on
a group of something like fifty different peo
ple, organizing outings, meet-ups, and special
events. Putting indiscriminate effort into
everybody seemed like the way to go.
Yet, my crisis came along when I began to
think about who among these fifty people
valued my time, effort and care. Even if love
is not a zero sum game, time is. If, after a cer
tain amount of time, putting great effort into
something yields nothing for either party, all
the time spent and energy spent is akin to a
blank space. It might even be counterproduc
tive, where I create negative utility for my re
cipient of the care. If my goal is to make oth
ers happy - which it generally is - caring for
certain people ironically defeated my pur
poses. Moreover, my over-exuberant proac
tivity left no space for their reciprocity: I was
wiping out an indicator or descriptor of the

nature of my human relationships.
What I ended up doing, predictably
enough, was to come up with a project, where
I decided to take a hands-off approach to
people for a short period of time. I stopped
organizing outings and bugging people, and
even slowed down my rate of compulsive tex
ting. What I discovered is that some people
did contact me, to talk, to ask how I was, and
to meet up to climb roofs and drink tea. At
the same time, not every person from my
giant group of friends had the capacity to
keep in contact, and among those who could
not keep in contact, a few probably weren't
bothered.
In away, my project was helping me con
struct a VIP list of my friends. Certainly, the
information I gleaned opened up a whole
new can of worms: if I compulsively want to
continue giving to people who do not give
back, that illuminates another host of prob
lems I need to resolve. But the first step to un
derstanding the nature of what we do is to
first describe our habits and then question
them. In seriously constructing my VIP list, I
believe that I am on my way to articulating
where I am on the list of priorities for various
people. Such information will not simply help
me plan my time better, but could potential
ly create greater amounts of utility and hap
piness for everybody involved.
While I still value the importance of
reaching out, there are dangers to spreading
oneself too thin. The most meaningful human
connections, I believe, occur when people are
not substitutable. When they leave your life
for certain periods of time, you notice and
miss their presence and the same should
be felt the other way around. Who these peo
ple are in your life, I think, is an important
question, and when you have that figured
out, give them a call. Ask them to go ice skat
ing, then talk with them about Las Vegas on a
porch in the sun. Or perhaps, one evening
after a giant plate of sushi, climb a roof to
watch the stars.

not reduce Sam's capacity to have affection
for others. Talking about myself in hypothet
ical third person aside, I also believe that en
suring constant equality in a relationship, and
consequently attempting to calculate human
emotion, is both petty and impossible. As a
result, I often spent my time keeping tabs on
a group of something like fifty different peo
ple, organizing outings, meet-ups, and special
events. Putting indiscriminate effort into
everybody seemed like the way to go.
Yet, my crisis came along when I began to
think about who among these fifty people
valued my time, effort and care. Even if love
is not a zero sum game, time is. If, after a cer
tain amount of time, putting great effort into
something yields nothing for either party, all
the time spent and energy spent is akin to a
blank space. It might even be counterproduc
tive, where I create negative utility for my re
cipient of the care. If my goal is to make oth
ers happy - which it generally is - caring for
certain people ironically defeated my pur
poses. Moreover, my over-exuberant proac
tivity left no space for their reciprocity: I was
wiping out an indicator or descriptor of the

nature of my human relationships.
What I ended up doing, predictably
enough, was to come up with a project, where
I decided to take a hands-off approach to
people for a short period of time. I stopped
organizing outings and bugging people, and
even slowed down my rate of compulsive tex
ting. What I discovered is that some people
did contact me, to talk, to ask how I was, and
to meet up to climb roofs and drink tea. At
the same time, not every person from my
giant group of friends had the capacity to
keep in contact, and among those who could
not keep in contact, a few probably weren't
bothered.
In away, my project was helping me con
struct a VIP list of my friends. Certainly, the
information I gleaned opened up a whole
new can of worms: if I compulsively want to
continue giving to people who do not give
back, that illuminates another host of prob
lems I need to resolve. But the first step to un
derstanding the nature of what we do is to
first describe our habits and then question
them. In seriously constructing my VIP list, I
believe that I am on my way to articulating
where I am on the list of priorities for various
people. Such information will not simply help
me plan my time better, but could potential
ly create greater amounts of utility and hap
piness for everybody involved.
While I still value the importance of
reaching out, there are dangers to spreading
oneself too thin. The most meaningful human
connections, I believe, occur when people are
not substitutable. When they leave your life
for certain periods of time, you notice and
miss their presence and the same should
be felt the other way around. Who these peo
ple are in your life, I think, is an important
question, and when you have that figured
out, give them a call. Ask them to go ice skat
ing, then talk with them about Las Vegas on a
porch in the sun. Or perhaps, one evening
after a giant plate of sushi, climb a roof to
watch the stars.

Do it. Or just email Sam at samtoh@stanford.
