## Plant pathogen behavior is tissue-specific, says bio prof 
### CASSANDRA FELICIANO STAFF WRITER 
Stanford researchers reported a
first-time discovery of tissue-specif
ic targeting in pathogens that could
revolutionize research on disease
treatment in both plants and hu
mans. The findings of this study on
tumor-causing corn fungi, published
in Science earlier this month, oust
conventional ideas about how
pathogens attack their hosts.
This tissue-specific method of ex
ploitation makes these pathogens
more efficient because they do not
have to deploy an entire arsenal of
processes to destroy their host, as
many medical researchers had be
lieved, said Virginia Walbot, a pro
fessor in the biology department
who headed the study.
"So this provides a new way of
looking at pathogens," she said. "My
colleagues in the medical school who
study other kinds of pathogens are
very intrigued with this new concept
because it will stimulate new re
search on their favorite pathogen."
Walbot launched her project on
Ustilago maydis a type of species
specific oncopathogens called smut
that can grow on a variety of plants
but only cause cancer in corn in
August 2007 when she noticed that
sterile male mutants of maize never
developed corn smuts. She wanted to
determine whether or not these
strains were resistant to corn smut.
The research took place over the
course of 363 days, a relatively short
timeframe for research, according
to Walbot, on a 1.7-acre segment of
the department's on-campus fields,
using 20,000 to 25,000 stalks.
Results revealed that the degree
of infection depends on the growth
potential of the host tissue with the
pathogens taking on a "the bigger,
the better" approach in their attack.
This may explain why the cancer,
although it affects other parts of the
plant unlike other smuts that concen
trate only on floral tissue, remains
local. It is extremely rare to find an
entire plant to be infested with tu
mors, which surprised Walbot, who
expected the fungus to keep growing.
But the onset of the disease has a
time limit and can infect its host

only during the stages of early
growth.
"The earliest finding in the whole
study was that if you try to infect
plants where cell division is finished,
so mature plants, absolutely no tu
mors anywhere," Walbot said. "The
whole plant is resistant at that point
so that's a protection for the corn."

The sequel to this project will
begin this summer and will follow
up on a myriad of details in the cur
rent study's results
"Very little is known in the flow
ers about what cell types the fungus
actually forms an association with,"
Walbot said. "There's a lot of mi
croscopy evaluation of fungal
growth in seedlings but not in flow
ers."

The fungus shows a preference
for vascular tissue found on the
leaves of corn, according to Walbot.
But, because this tissue can only be
found in small amounts in the
flower's anther, the sac of pollen lo
cated at the center, she suspects that
the fungus chooses to live off of other
types of tissue.
"Maybe it likes all cell types in the
anther, we just don't know, and that

would be really fun to find out," she
said.

Walbot and her team will rely on
one of two ideas for how to deter
mine these host preferences: confo
cal microscopy, a common optical

imaging technique, and implanted
photon microscopes.
Stanford neurobiologist Mark
Schnitzer has engineered one- to two
gram miniature photon microscopes
that can film their surroundings.

"We're going to modify, with
Mark's help, these same types of mi
croscopes and implant them inside
the flowers," Walbot said. "The fun
gus is fluorescently labeled so we'll
be able to watch the fungus like a

movie watch it arrive and see how
it grows and which cell types it
prefers to grow within."

infect plans
where cell
division is
finished...
absolutely no

anywhere."

Biology professor Virginia Walbot examines a corn plant with a tumor-causing pathogen called corn smut. Recent findings, headed by Walbot, show that the
pathogen has the ability to target specific types of tissues within the corn plant, which has wider implications for research on disease treatment in plants and humans.
