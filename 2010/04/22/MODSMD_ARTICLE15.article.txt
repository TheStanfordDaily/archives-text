## DOUBLES TRIUMPH Cardinal sweeps USC and prepares for Pac-10s 
### WILL SEATON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With a dominating doubles performance
against USC, Stanford earned the outright
Pac-10 title. With this momentum, the Stan
ford women's tennis team (20-1, 8-0 Pac-10)
will head to the Pac-10 Championships, which
start today in Ojai, Calif.

The team had to come down earlier than
usual on Tuesday in order to play the doubles
point of their match against USC. The match
was delayed on April 4 with the two teams tied
at 3-3. With UCLA having a chance to tie Stan
ford for the Pac-10 title, the Cardinal needed
to close out this match in order to assure itself
sole possession of the title. With a Stanford
loss, UCLA would have had the opportunity
to tie for the title by defeating California in an
other rain-delayed match.

Yesterday, Stanford came out firing. The
team swept the doubles matches, allowing a
total of only seven games to their opponents.
The third duo of junior Carolyn McVeigh and
sophomore Veronica Li came off first with an
8-2 decision, and then the first team of junior
Hilary Barte and senior Lindsay Burdette fin
ished with an identical score to clinch the
match. The second team of freshmen Mallory
Burdette and Stacey Tan completed the sweep
with an 8-3 victory. Barte and Lindsay Bur
dette are ranked No. 2 in the nation, while Mal
lory Burdette and Tan are No. 26.
The win gives Stanford a 4-3 win over USC,
an 8-0 Pac-10 record and the outright Pac-10
title.

"[Head coach] Lele [Forood] gave a really
great pre-match speech," Barte said. "She sat
us down and said, 'Look, we're Pac-10 Cham
pions either way so just go out there and swing
away."'

At stake in Ojai was Stanford's NCAA
record home winning streak. Late Tuesday, the
Intercollegiate Tennis Association (ITA) stat
ed that the matchup between Stanford and
USC at Ojai would count as a home match,
since the entirety of the singles competition
was played at Taube Family Tennis Stadium.
The Cardinal defended its streak of 162 con
secutive home victories at a neutral site that is
closer to USC than to the Farm.

"This is what our team wanted to do,"
Forood said. "We've certainly never done this
before. I can't even remember one time we ac
tually finished a match at Ojai so it was really
unique territory."

The Pac-10 Championships will serve as the
last practice before NCAA Tournament play.
Singles play takes place on Thursday, doubles
play is on Friday and the championship match
es are on Sunday.

Heading into the weekend, Stanford is na
tionally ranked at No. 9. The team is on a 12-

match win streak since last losing Feb. 26 at
UCLA, its only defeat of the season. The Car
dinal's most recent win came over No. 12 Cal
this past weekend, as it completed the season
sweep of its Bay Area rival with a 5-2 victory
highlighted by strong play at the bottom of the
lineup.

"Both times I didn't know I was the clinch
er until after the match," Li said. "The team ran
over and pulled me to the ground, but it was a
really good feeling afterwards knowing that
my match decided it."

The play of McVeigh and Li at the five and
six spots has been essential to Stanford's suc
cess this season. With two of the best records
on the team, McVeigh stands at 21-7 and Li
stands at 23-6. The pair also combines to be
Stanford's No. 3 doubles team and enters the
Pac-10 Tournament on a 13-match win streak
together.

"We've learned more about each other's
game and what works for both of us and what
doesn't," Li said. "We've learned how to work
together and how to play together. We both re
ally enjoy playing doubles and competing so
we try to make every match out there really
fun for us."

Although the players at the top few spots
have struggled recently, the bottom of the line
up's ability to win has benefited the entire
team and its morale.

"That is the number one most awesome
thing we can bring from the past couple match
es," Lindsay Burdette said. "The way Hilary
and I have been struggling at the top of the
lineup a few times has really given the back
side this awesome sense of pride. They're defi
nitely gaining extra confidence from that."
Stanford opens up play at the Pac-10
Championships today at 8 a.m.
