# Vaulting to the Championships
## 
### LAUREN TAYLOR STAFF WRITER 
After months of anticipation and preparation, the time has final
ly arrived for the Stanford women's gymnastics team to compete in
the NCAA Championships. This weekend, the Cardinal gymnasts
will head to Gainesville, Fla., hoping to appear in the Super Six Fi
nals and produce the twenty-four solid routines they have been
waiting for.

No. 6 Stanford (19-3) re
turns to the NCAA Cham
pionships for the fourth
consecutive season and the
eighth time in the past 10
years. The meet will take
place today through Satur
day, and it will begin with
the team preliminaries.
Each of today's preliminar
ies is broken up into groups
of six, with the top three
teams in each advancing to
Friday's Super Six Finals,
which determine the na
tional team champion. The
Cardinal has reached the
Super Six a total of four
times, finishing a school
best third place on two oc
casions.

Following its regional
success on April 10, in
which Stanford collected its
fifth regional championship
and scored 196.775, the
team looks to surpass its al
ready established season

high scores. If the competition was any indicator of how well Stan
ford will compete in the upcoming championships, junior captain
Shelley Alexander will be a primary contributor to the team's ef
forts.

At the regional, Alexander won two events, the vault and the bal
ance beam, with scores of 9.95 and 9.90 respectively. It marked the
first time in her collegiate career that she has won multiple events in
the same meet. She set personal career bests on the vault and in the
all-around (39.500), placing third overall in the latter. Last year,

GAME NOTES: No. 6 Stanford returns to the
NCAA Championships for the fourth year in a
row this weekend. The Cardinal will have to
advance past a preliminary round in order to
get to the Super Six Finals, which will deter
mine the national champion. The top gym
nasts for Stanford include junior Shelley

Alexander and seniors Allyse Ishino, Carly
Janiga and Blair Ryland. Its toughest competi
tor in the preliminary will be No. 2 Florida, the
event's host.

Senior Allyse Ishino (above) represents one of Stanford's best hopes to secure a
national title. Along with junior Shelley Alexander, she also has a strong chance to win
All-America honors. Her main events will be the all-around and the floor exercise.
Alexander missed first-team Ail-
American recognition, as well as
qualification for the Individual
Event finals, by only one place on
the vault.

She and senior captain Allyse
Ishino are expected to be this year's
top All-America contenders. Ishino
was the 2009 NCAA Regional
Champion on the uneven bars, and
is having the best season of her col
legiate career. Though she missed
her entire freshman year and the

postseason of her sophomore year
because of illness and injury, she is
now fully healthy and will be one of
the team's main contributors to the
floor and the all-around.

Senior captain Carly Janiga and
senior Blair Ryland are the team's
two returning All-Americans. Janiga
has received the All-America honor
six times, with four first-team selec
tions, and she enters this year's
NCAA meet as one of only three re
turning second-place finishers from
2009. Ryland earned second-team
All-America honors in 2007 as a
freshman and will take a vital lead
ership role on the vault this week
end.

Collectively, the squad will take
on five other top-12 teams in Thurs
day's preliminaries No. 2 Florida
(the event's host), No. 3 Alabama,
No. 7 Arkansas, No. 10 Missouri and
No. 11 Michigan. Though Stanford
defeated Michigan in the Southeast
Regional, 196.775-195.800, the team
has not faced any of the others in its
preliminary group so far this season.
If the Card is to advance to the Super
Six, it will have to take one of the top
three slots, and could later potential
ly face No. 1 UCLA for the fourth
time this season. Stanford handily
defeated the Bruins twice in dual
meets earlier this year but fell short,
197.350-196.775, at the Pac-10
Championships in Tucson, Ariz, a
few weeks ago.

begins today at 4 p.m.
