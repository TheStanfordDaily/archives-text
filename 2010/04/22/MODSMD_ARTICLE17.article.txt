## Men's tennis heads to Pac- 10 Championships 
### â€” Kabir Sawhney 
No. 7 Stanford heads into the
Pac-10 Tournament after grab
bing a share of the regular-season
title in the last weekend of the
season. The Cardinal (18-5, 5-1
Pac-10) ended the season on a
seven-match winning streak that
vaulted it to its current ranking.
The streak included wins over
No. 9 UCLA and No. 13 Califor
nia.

Though scoring well at the
conference tournament is a goal
for Stanford, the event serves
more as a warm-up for the up
coming NCAA Championships.
The Pac-10 Tournament will be
played on an individual basis, un
like the team competition that
has been the main format of com
petition in Stanford's regular sea
son.

Stanford's toughest competi
tion will come from No. 5 USC,
which shared the conference title
with the Card. By virtue of their
regular-season victory over Stan
ford, the Trojans have secured the
Pac-10's automatic qualifying
spot for the NCAA Tournament.
The Cardinal should receive an
at-large bid on the strength of its
regular-season record.
Stanford's top star entering
Pac-lOs is sophomore Bradley
Klahn. Last year, Klahn won the
individual conference titles in
both singles and doubles, becom
ing just the fourth Stanford play
er to accomplish the feat. In the
doubles draw, he will pair with
fellow sophomore Ryan Thacher.
In the latest ITA rankings, Klahn
is ranked as the No. 12 singles
player in the country. USC's
