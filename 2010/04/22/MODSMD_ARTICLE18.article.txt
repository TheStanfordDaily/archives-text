# NFL conduct policy is unfair
## 
### Kabir Sawhney 
Though I find it difficult to
feel sorry for NFL players,
with their multi-million dol
lar salaries and superstar
dom, I really have sympathy
for Ben Roethlisberger.
No, seriously, I do.
Now that's not to imply that I en
dorse his alleged offseason activities,
including accusations of sexually as
saulting a college student in Georgia.
Such behavior is certainly deplorable,
in the eyes of the media, the fans, the
Steelers organization and the NFL.
However, I think the NFL and com
missioner Roger Goodell have over
stepped their bounds on this issue in
suspending Roethlisberger for the first
six games of the 2010 season. The main
reason for my stance is that Big Ben has
not been faced with criminal charges or
a civil lawsuit, and is unlikely to be
charged in the future in relation to
these incidents.
I find it immensely difficult to agree
with sanctioning a person who, in the
eyes of the law, has done nothing
wrong aside from making some poor
decisions.

While NFL players are certainly dif
ferent from the average American em
ployee, the fact remains that they are
really just people employed by their re
spective franchises and, by extension,
the NFL. I simply don't believe that it is
a fair bargain to take someone's pay
and livelihood away when they have
not done anything wrong legally. Sure,
Roethlisberger probably should not
have been partying it up and drinking
with underage girls; however, since the
police have decided not to charge him,
I don't think the NFL is justified in lev
eling any sanctions on its own.
To move away from the Roethlis
berger case to the bigger picture, the
league's "personal conduct policy"
vastly oversteps the traditional limita
tions on the intrusion of employers into
the personal lives of their employees.
The policy, which holds that players can
be punished for any "conduct detri
mental to the league," is far too broad
and sweeping to be considered equi
table to the players. What it really
means is that players should not create
any opportunities for the media to cast
the league in a negative way it is fun
damentally a public-relations policy,
designed to avoid the "thug" label that
has been associated with the NBA and
the Oregon football program.
While it might be tough to agree
with this point of view, given that NFL
athletes make so much money, imag
ine if all employers were to adopt sim
ilar policies. Any pictures of an em
ployee doing stupid things that wound
up on Facebook could result in re
moval of pay. Again, it just does not
seem fair for employers to have the
ability to stop paying employees just
because they did something that was
dumb (but not illegal).
Of course, given their celebrity sta
tus, players still have to face the court of
public opinion. Fans all over the coun
try will judge Roethlisberger negative
ly, even the Pittsburgh fans he won two
Super Bowls for. Rumors are swirling
that the Steelers may trade him some
where else; though this is unlikely I
would have no issue with it, as such an

It's not fair to

someone
when they
haven't done
anything
illegal.

action would fall within the bounds of
the normal relationship between play
er and franchise.
However, I don't even think that
the justification for the personal con
duct policy is valid. Fans and the media
are judging Roethlisberger not the
Steelers, not the NFL, but just Ben
Roethlisberger. Even after the much
publicized trade of another Steeler
plagued by off-field issues, Santonio
Holmes, the Pittsburgh organization

retains its sterling reputation.
I also don't disagree with the league
taking action when a player has done
something that is actually illegal. Had
Roethlisberger been charged with sex
ual assault or some other crime, then
the NFL would have been completely
justified in leveling its own punish
ment. Employers in general should be
allowed to terminate or suspend em
ployment when an employee does
something illegal, as it is entirely rea
sonable for an organization to not have
convicted criminals working for it.
Just as an addition to that point, it is
also important that, if the individual is
acquitted, their status should be re
stored. We must retain the principle of

innocent until proven guilty; it is unjust
for someone to face enduring conse
quences for something he has been ac
cused of, but actually didn't do.
In the end, the NFL's personal con
duct policy and its ability to punish
players outside of the legal system is a
gross misuse of its power as an employ
er.

To Roger Goodell, I say: leave the
policing to the police and the punish
ment to the court system, and get back
to your real job of running the NFL.
