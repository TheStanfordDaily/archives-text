billion to create the United Nations Founda

thing, he does not do it meekly," said GSB
Dean Garth Saloner 'Bl M.S. 'B2 Ph.D. 'B2 in
his introduction.
Turner kept the conversation casual and
humorous, insisting that students address
him as "Ted."
The discussion, moderated by second
year MBA student Jason LeeKeenan, cov

"It's a lot of work," Turner said. "You've

to do ... the secret of success in business is
early to bed, early to rise, work like hell and
advertise."
The conversation moved to Turner's
work with the United Nations Foundation

"We're going to have to get our govern
ment to work better ... they have to multi
task,"Turner said. "Why can't they do two or
three bills at one time?"
Turner also stressed the importance of
tackling global climate change, saying, "It's
time to say goodbye to coal and oil."
"We can't really afford to lose this one,"
Turner said. "The planet's collapsing all
around us."

"One thing that
should be
abundantly clear is
that when Ted
Turner does
something, he does
not do it meekly"
