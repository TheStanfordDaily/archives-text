# STUDENT GOV'T
## Execs are students too, says GSC GSC discusses executive salaries, committee bylaws 
### BRIANNA PANG STAFF WRITER 
As the current Graduate Stu
dent Council term comes to an end,
members are scrambling to set the
stage for the incoming council, dis
cussing budget and bylaw updates
and concluding their final projects.
GSC members unanimously ap
proved the appointments of
Alexandria Butler 'll, Ana Portillo
'll, Stephanie Garrett 'l2, Alekzan
dra June Scully'l3, Hilary Stone 'l3,

Dennis Mak, a business student,
and Makeda Robinson, a medical
student, to the Nominations Com
mission. Mak and Robinson will
serve as chair and deputy chair, re
spectively.
NomCom will nominate four
students to be "solicitors general,"
paid positions to represent cases be
fore the ASSU Constitutional
Council, according to GSC co-chair
Eric Osborne, a law student, and fi
nancial officer Ryan Peacock, a
graduate student in chemical engi
neering.
Co-chair Nanna Notthoff, a
graduate student in psychology,
provided a housing update, explain

ing that the housing committee
plans to improve communication
between students and Housing ad
ministrators.
"[Housing] said they didn't real
ly know about the concerns that stu
dents had," Notthoff said. "That's
why addressing the [Rains] issue
didn't happen until after the deci
sion had already been made."
ASSU President David Gobaud,
a coterminal student in computer
science, provided his final update of
ASSU affairs and said his farewell
to council members. Gobaud will
conclude his term on Friday when
incoming ASSU executives Angelina
Cardona 'll and Kelsei Wharton 'l2
take over.
Council members approved $570
for Bengalis at Stanford, $1,028 for
Sarvodaya and $4OO for the Gradu
ate Student Programming Board.
Executive Budget Debate
Heated debate arose over execu
tive salaries, with members divided
over whether or not executive
salaries should be left at their current
amount.
According to Peacock, the issue
was raised by Undergraduate Sena
tor Alex Katz 'l2, who favored using
the money for more voluntary stu
dent organization (VSO) funding.
Current executives are paid about
$lO,OOO each per year, while GSC
chairs and the Senate chair are paid a
combined total of $7,200 and $6,250,
respectively.
"How much of a full-time job
should this be?" Osborne asked.
Emphasizing the "student" in
"student body president," Notthoff
argued that the ASSU executives
should still commit a considerable
amount of time to their academic du
ties.
"The decrease in salary should
correlate with the decrease in re
sponsibility and expectation," she
said. "It's important that the presi
dent is a student as well."

Gobaud argued that the ASSU
executive job requires 70 hours a
week minimum, and decreasing the
salary wouldn't mean the executives
would work any less.
School of Education representa
tive Jon McNaughtan, a graduate stu
dent in education, said student body
presidents in other schools often take
academic leave during the year that
they serve, allowing them to devote
all of their time to improving campus
life. Gobaud supported this concept.
However, Amy Askin, a doctoral
candidate in civil and environmental
engineering, argued that requiring
too much of the student body presi
dents may also discourage qualified
candidates from vying for the execu
tive position.
"Telling people that they're going
to need to spend more time in school
before they can finish will also dis
courage people from running," Askin
said. "I wouldn't want someone who
does have great ideas to be discour
aged to run."
Gobaud asserted that the budget
does not need to be either increased
or decreased. He has not accepted a
paycheck for much of this year.
"There's really no need to reallo
cate the budget," Gobaud said.
"There's no need to cut. The amount
of money we have probably even
went up."
In a straw poll among all meeting
attendees, the majority voted to nei
ther increase nor decrease the execu
tive salary. In a separate straw poll,
voting members voted 12-1 not to in
crease the salary and 8-4 not to de
crease the salary. The polls will be

used to figure out next year's budget
in Monday's budget committee
meeting.
If no new budget is approved, last
year's budget will be used instead, ac
cording to parliamentarian Robert
Hennessy, a graduate student in elec
trical engineering.
Funding Bylaws
Funding committee bylaw
changes were contested over the
GSC members' e-mail list this week;
on Wednesday, newly elected fund
ing committee chair Krystal St.
Julien, a graduate student in bio
chemistry, addressed each concern as
members mulled over more adjust
ments.
Discussing caps on food spending,
GSC members determined that
snacks, lunch and dinner funding will
no longer be cut by an "arbitrary" $2,
but instead be cut to $3, $6 and $8
from the original $4, $8 and $lO after
the first 50 people. Larger groups can
get bulk deals, St. Julien said.
Council members also discussed
the wording of the seminars funding
policy. Instead of declaring that all
academic seminars would not be
funded, members decided only aca
demic talks of a "broad interest" will
be funded. The GSC would define
"broad interest" on a case-by-case
basis.
Additional changes will be made
in the upcoming week. Members
plan to vote on the final bylaw
changes at next week's meeting.
