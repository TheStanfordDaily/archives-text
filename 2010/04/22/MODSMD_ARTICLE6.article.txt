## SSE Labs to offer VC resources New program, rebranded from SSE Ventures, starts in summer 
### ELLEN HUET DESK EDITOR 
SSE Ventures, a summer venture
capital (VC) program started by
Stanford Student Enterprises (SSE)
in 2008, has become SSE Labs after
rebranding and structural changes to
the program.
SSE Labs, in a vein similar to SSE
Ventures, will offer entrepreneurial
students and groups with financial
support for product and business de
velopment.

The move marks a shift, however,
in the underlying model for the pro
gram. Ventures had previously relied
upon offering seed money for busi
ness ideas and proposals as an invest
ment, but managers felt that the
group was not functioning effective
ly or gathering enough interest from
talented student entrepreneurs.
"[SSE Ventures'] model was not
as successful as SSE was hoping for,"
said Cameron Teitelman 'll, the
managing director of Labs and cur
rent general manager of the VC divi
sion of SSE Ventures. T e i t e 1 -
man said that because SSE was un
able to offer competitive sums of
money to groups, they lost the best
ideas to other VC firms and received
"lower-quality ideas and applica
tions."

In contrast, SSE Labs is hoping to
entice teams of Stanford students by
providing support and resources
without asking for a cut of eventual
profits, as most outside VC firms
would. The focus will be on allowing
groups to devote an entire summer
to developing their ideas in an educa
tional environment, with access to
advising and mentorship.
"The big differentiation is that
we're not taking equity," Teitelman
said, referring to the shift away from
investing.
Groups who are selected to re
ceive assistance will be set up with of
fice space, funds for housing and liv
ing expenses and mentorship oppor
tunities with entrepreneurial experts
and guest speakers.
Although SSE Labs originally
sought University approval through
the Office of Development, the ven
ture ended up under the purview of
Student Activities and Leadership
(SAL). SAL officially approved
Labs this month. The program now
awaits confirmation from the Office
of Development to accept outside
funding.
