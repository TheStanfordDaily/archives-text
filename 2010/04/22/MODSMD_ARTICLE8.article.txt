## Writing out the storm 
### AMY JULIA HARRIS MANAGING EDITOR 
In the early 90s, Sheri Fink, a medical stu
dent studying neuroscience, was sitting
with about a hundred other Stanford un
dergrads in a Hum√üio course about
healthcare in the Nazi period. Professor
Tom Raffin, then-co-director of Stanford's
center for biomedical ethics, was describing
the horrifying role that physicians played in
the Final Solution in Germany in the 19405.
The class listened raptly as Raffin spoke of sys
tematic German euthanasia campaigns
against children born with congenital defects.
At her seat, Fink shook her head, shifting
her mop of dark curls. A human rights fire
brand with a bent for medicine, Fink was both
horrified and fascinated at what motivated the
Nazi doctors to do what they did. Flow could
physicians in the Third Reich euthanize thou
sands in the name of science? And how could
they do it again in the Bosnian genocide oc
curring right then?
These were the questions that Sheri Fink,
M.D. '9B, Ph.D. '99 asked as she watched the
horrors unfold in the Bosnian War in the early
90s from her position at Stanford. Nearly a J
decade later, she would pursue a variation on
the same theme, but in a different country and
with a new context how could a cohort of
desperate New Orleans doctors marooned at a
hospital in the wake of Flurricane Katrina eu
thanize elderly patients they thought weren't
going to make it to evacuation?
Answering that question led Fink, a social
justice-minded med student turned investiga
tive journalist, through a traumatic path that
earned her the 2010 Pulitzer Prize for inves
tigative reporting early last week.
"Deadly Choices at Memorial," Fink's
gripping 13,000-word expose published in The
New York Times Magazine in 2009 on the

fourth anniversary of Katrina was an up-close
reconstruction of the life-or-death decisions
that beset a team of health professionals in a
New Orleans hospital after the disaster. The
story, which took two years of reporting, hun
dreds of interviews and extensive evidence ex
amination, kicked off a national dialogue on
the ethics of "mercy killings" in disasters and a

debate about the culpability of medical pro
fessionals put into these crisis-mode decisions.
"I wanted to appreciate some aspect of
their experience, having worked in disaster
myself," said Fink, in a phone interview from
her home in Washington, D.C. "I think it was
an opportunity for them to tell their stories
and give their perspectives and to help Amer

icans understand what happened there, with
the hopes, perhaps, that that could help situa
tions like this from arising in the future."
So in February 2007, more than two years
after the levees broke and floodwaters pum
meled New Orleans, Fink headed to
