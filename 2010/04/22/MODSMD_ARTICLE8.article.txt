## Writing out the storm 
### AMY JULIA HARRIS MANAGING EDITOR 
In the early 90s, Sheri Fink, a medical stu
dent studying neuroscience, was sitting
with about a hundred other Stanford un
dergrads in a Humßio course about
healthcare in the Nazi period. Professor
Tom Raffin, then-co-director of Stanford's
center for biomedical ethics, was describing
the horrifying role that physicians played in
the Final Solution in Germany in the 19405.
The class listened raptly as Raffin spoke of sys
tematic German euthanasia campaigns
against children born with congenital defects.
At her seat, Fink shook her head, shifting
her mop of dark curls. A human rights fire
brand with a bent for medicine, Fink was both
horrified and fascinated at what motivated the
Nazi doctors to do what they did. Flow could
physicians in the Third Reich euthanize thou
sands in the name of science? And how could
they do it again in the Bosnian genocide oc
curring right then?
These were the questions that Sheri Fink,
M.D. '9B, Ph.D. '99 asked as she watched the
horrors unfold in the Bosnian War in the early
90s from her position at Stanford. Nearly a J
decade later, she would pursue a variation on
the same theme, but in a different country and
with a new context how could a cohort of
desperate New Orleans doctors marooned at a
hospital in the wake of Flurricane Katrina eu
thanize elderly patients they thought weren't
going to make it to evacuation?
Answering that question led Fink, a social
justice-minded med student turned investiga
tive journalist, through a traumatic path that
earned her the 2010 Pulitzer Prize for inves
tigative reporting early last week.
"Deadly Choices at Memorial," Fink's
gripping 13,000-word expose published in The
New York Times Magazine in 2009 on the

fourth anniversary of Katrina was an up-close
reconstruction of the life-or-death decisions
that beset a team of health professionals in a
New Orleans hospital after the disaster. The
story, which took two years of reporting, hun
dreds of interviews and extensive evidence ex
amination, kicked off a national dialogue on
the ethics of "mercy killings" in disasters and a

debate about the culpability of medical pro
fessionals put into these crisis-mode decisions.
"I wanted to appreciate some aspect of
their experience, having worked in disaster
myself," said Fink, in a phone interview from
her home in Washington, D.C. "I think it was
an opportunity for them to tell their stories
and give their perspectives and to help Amer

icans understand what happened there, with
the hopes, perhaps, that that could help situa
tions like this from arising in the future."

after the levees broke and floodwaters pum

porter at the time, she had secured a
grant from Kaiser Media Fellowship
in Health to report on the story. After
two intense years conducting more
than 140 interviews, Fink was ready to
publish. She sold the story both to
Steve Engelberg, the managing editor
of online investigative powerhouse
ProPublica, and The New York Times
Magazine,

Fink's "Deadly Choices at Memori
al" piece was just one instance of a long
career on the "medical crisis beat" that
had its roots in her time at Stanford.

Working on her Ph.D. research
under Robert Sapolsky throughout the

90s to design gene therapy to protect
brain cells from various neurological
diseases, Fink became more concerned
by what she read in the newspapers
than what she saw under her micro
scope. The ethnic cleansings in Bosnia
deeply disturbed her, and after her class
with Raffin on medical ethics, she want
ed to do more, leading her to co-found
Students Against Genocide to spread
awareness of the conflict.
Then, in 1997, just two years after the
end of the Bosnian War, Fink decided to
go to Bosnia as part of a conference put
on by Bosnian medical students titled
"Medicine, War and Peace" to study
how the students practiced medicine in
crisis.
She floated the idea to Raffin, who

was initially skeptical.
"I was worried that she would be
hurt," Raffin, now an emeritus profes
sor, remembered. "There was a lot of vi
olence in Bosnia at the time."
But Fink pressed him for funds and
he eventually conceded. Fink headed to
Sarajevo.
"1 decided to take a year off after
med school and go there and try to un
derstand what my colleagues in Bosnia
who were in med school were going
through," Fink said.
There was just one stipulation she
had to write a book.
To prep for that experience, Fink
decided to educate herself about jour
nalism, and completed a reporting fel
lowship through the American Associ
ation for the Advancement of Sciences,
aimed at giving reporting experience to
grad students with a science bent. As
part of the program, she did a three
month stint at a newsroom in Portland
and "fell in love with journalism."
From then on, she abandoned the lab
coat for a notepad, following in the foot
steps of her father, a journalist in her
home state of Michigan.
Triage: The process of determining
medical priority in order to increase the
number of survivors in times of crisis.
It's a word that Fink knows well.
She encountered it in her reporting on
Katrina, but fresh out of medical
school at Stanford, Fink actually prac
ticed it.
As a researcher for Physicians for
Human rights and background for her
book "War Hospital: A True Story of
Surgery and Survival," Fink went to
Kosovo, where she worked with med
ical services on the border near Mace
donia. One day, upwards of 100,000
people showed up at the medical camp,
which was underequipped.
"I was helping out with that right
after med school working under the di
rection of the more experienced doc
tors," she said. "And I was doing triage,
deciding who would get into the tents
for care first and who could wait, whose
injuries were not so serious."
Fast forward to Katrina and the
choices of physicians at the Memorial
Medical Center. It was miles removed
from Kosovo, but it was triage all over
again, of an entirely different scale.
And Fink knew what the doctors
were going through.

"I realized that these people in New
Orleans hadn't had that opportunity
because this was it for them," she said.
"It was hitting their city, which was a
very different thing. And even having
had a little taste of that, I realized that
people don't make the best decisions
when they haven't slept for days, and
that they might make decisions differ
ently if they were rested and if they had
better preparedness."
That nuance and the desire to shed
light on the human dilemma character
izes Fink's work and led her to pen an
emotional, illuminating portrait of New
Orleans Medical Center.
"This type of disaster, horrific as it
was, had the potential of occurring in
many places in America as in many
places around the world," Fink said. "I
felt like there might be some larger im
portance to the story than just the
specifics of what occurred."
Raffin agreed.
"Journalists have a critically impor
tant role to play in illuminating ethical is
sues for people who aren't normally ex
posed to them," Raffin said. "I think we
need to nurture people like Sheri Fink
who will go out and research and do im
portant pieces of journalism that shed
light on the issues we really need to con
sider."

In the early 90s, Sheri Fink, a medical stu
dent studying neuroscience, was sitting
with about a hundred other Stanford un
dergrads in a Humßio course about
healthcare in the Nazi period. Professor
Tom Raffin, then-co-director of Stanford's
center for biomedical ethics, was describing
the horrifying role that physicians played in
the Final Solution in Germany in the 19405.
The class listened raptly as Raffin spoke of sys
tematic German euthanasia campaigns
against children born with congenital defects.
At her seat, Fink shook her head, shifting
her mop of dark curls. A human rights fire
brand with a bent for medicine, Fink was both
horrified and fascinated at what motivated the
Nazi doctors to do what they did. Flow could
physicians in the Third Reich euthanize thou
sands in the name of science? And how could
they do it again in the Bosnian genocide oc
curring right then?
These were the questions that Sheri Fink,
M.D. '9B, Ph.D. '99 asked as she watched the
horrors unfold in the Bosnian War in the early
90s from her position at Stanford. Nearly a J
decade later, she would pursue a variation on
the same theme, but in a different country and
with a new context how could a cohort of
desperate New Orleans doctors marooned at a
hospital in the wake of Flurricane Katrina eu
thanize elderly patients they thought weren't
going to make it to evacuation?
Answering that question led Fink, a social
justice-minded med student turned investiga
tive journalist, through a traumatic path that
earned her the 2010 Pulitzer Prize for inves
tigative reporting early last week.
"Deadly Choices at Memorial," Fink's
gripping 13,000-word expose published in The
New York Times Magazine in 2009 on the

fourth anniversary of Katrina was an up-close
reconstruction of the life-or-death decisions
that beset a team of health professionals in a
New Orleans hospital after the disaster. The
story, which took two years of reporting, hun
dreds of interviews and extensive evidence ex
amination, kicked off a national dialogue on
the ethics of "mercy killings" in disasters and a

debate about the culpability of medical pro
fessionals put into these crisis-mode decisions.
"I wanted to appreciate some aspect of
their experience, having worked in disaster
myself," said Fink, in a phone interview from
her home in Washington, D.C. "I think it was
an opportunity for them to tell their stories
and give their perspectives and to help Amer

icans understand what happened there, with
the hopes, perhaps, that that could help situa
tions like this from arising in the future."

Sheri Fink M.D. '98, PH.D. '99 found her calling in journalism after years of studying medicine. Her "Deadly Choices at Memorial," a long
form feature published last year in The New York Times Magazine won her the 2010 Pulitzer Prize for investigative reporting. The piece, which
took two years to report and write, focused on theethical questions surrounding a group of stranded doctors after Hurricane Katrina who
decided to euthanize suffering patients following the disaster.
Louisiana. A young freelance re
porter at the time, she had secured a
grant from Kaiser Media Fellowship
in Health to report on the story. After
two intense years conducting more
than 140 interviews, Fink was ready to
publish. She sold the story both to
Steve Engelberg, the managing editor
of online investigative powerhouse
ProPublica, and The New York Times
Magazine,

Fink's "Deadly Choices at Memori
al" piece was just one instance of a long
career on the "medical crisis beat" that
had its roots in her time at Stanford.

Working on her Ph.D. research
under Robert Sapolsky throughout the

90s to design gene therapy to protect
brain cells from various neurological
diseases, Fink became more concerned
by what she read in the newspapers
than what she saw under her micro
scope. The ethnic cleansings in Bosnia
deeply disturbed her, and after her class
with Raffin on medical ethics, she want
ed to do more, leading her to co-found
Students Against Genocide to spread
awareness of the conflict.
Then, in 1997, just two years after the
end of the Bosnian War, Fink decided to
go to Bosnia as part of a conference put
on by Bosnian medical students titled
"Medicine, War and Peace" to study
how the students practiced medicine in
crisis.
She floated the idea to Raffin, who

was initially skeptical.
"I was worried that she would be
hurt," Raffin, now an emeritus profes
sor, remembered. "There was a lot of vi
olence in Bosnia at the time."
But Fink pressed him for funds and
he eventually conceded. Fink headed to
Sarajevo.
"1 decided to take a year off after
med school and go there and try to un
derstand what my colleagues in Bosnia
who were in med school were going
through," Fink said.
There was just one stipulation she
had to write a book.
To prep for that experience, Fink
decided to educate herself about jour
nalism, and completed a reporting fel
lowship through the American Associ
ation for the Advancement of Sciences,
aimed at giving reporting experience to
grad students with a science bent. As
part of the program, she did a three
month stint at a newsroom in Portland
and "fell in love with journalism."
From then on, she abandoned the lab
coat for a notepad, following in the foot
steps of her father, a journalist in her
home state of Michigan.
Triage: The process of determining
medical priority in order to increase the
number of survivors in times of crisis.
It's a word that Fink knows well.
She encountered it in her reporting on
Katrina, but fresh out of medical
school at Stanford, Fink actually prac
ticed it.
As a researcher for Physicians for
Human rights and background for her
book "War Hospital: A True Story of
Surgery and Survival," Fink went to
Kosovo, where she worked with med
ical services on the border near Mace
donia. One day, upwards of 100,000
people showed up at the medical camp,
which was underequipped.
"I was helping out with that right
after med school working under the di
rection of the more experienced doc
tors," she said. "And I was doing triage,
deciding who would get into the tents
for care first and who could wait, whose
injuries were not so serious."
Fast forward to Katrina and the
choices of physicians at the Memorial
Medical Center. It was miles removed
from Kosovo, but it was triage all over
again, of an entirely different scale.
And Fink knew what the doctors
were going through.

"I realized that these people in New
Orleans hadn't had that opportunity
because this was it for them," she said.
"It was hitting their city, which was a
very different thing. And even having
had a little taste of that, I realized that
people don't make the best decisions
when they haven't slept for days, and
that they might make decisions differ
ently if they were rested and if they had
better preparedness."
That nuance and the desire to shed
light on the human dilemma character
izes Fink's work and led her to pen an
emotional, illuminating portrait of New
Orleans Medical Center.
"This type of disaster, horrific as it
was, had the potential of occurring in
many places in America as in many
places around the world," Fink said. "I
felt like there might be some larger im
portance to the story than just the
specifics of what occurred."
Raffin agreed.
"Journalists have a critically impor
tant role to play in illuminating ethical is
