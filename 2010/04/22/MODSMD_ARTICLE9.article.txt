# THE 						HIGH-LIGHTS OF 4/20

### ALYSSA WISDOM 
Short Scenes from 4/20
10:10 a.m. Sitting in my Tuesday morning IHUM lecture
as the clock ticked from 10:09 to 10:10,1 struggled to keep
my eyes open. Still groggy from the meager four hours of
sleep from the night before, I overheard the conversation
of two boys behind me.
"Yo, are you getting blazed today after lecture?" one
freshman said.
"No man, I have class... but after that I'm totally get
ting baked tonight with the crew," the other responded.
"I can't pass that up, especially not today."
I looked at the date on my computer. April 20.4/20.
Since the early 70s, cannabis connoisseurs have cele
brated the de facto weed holiday on April 20. Rumored
to have originated at a Northern California high school
nearly 40 years ago, 4/20 has evolved from a small ob

scure practice to a national celebration.
And it's no stranger at The Farm.
Noon At lunch in Lagunita Dining Hall,
a motley group of students are discussing
4/20.
"It's a pretty good reason to get high
today," said one sophomore girl, noting
the date, "but it's a weekly and sometimes
daily practice ... regardless."
Late Afternoon Following a section in
Sweet Hall later on that evening, two class
mates discuss meeting up that night to cele
brate.
Their method of choice? A vaporizer because "it
gives you a functional, different kind of high."
11:00 p.m. As the clock struck 11 and the end of 4/20

neared, a pack of undergraduates on
the outskirts of Lake Lagunita pass
around a happy hookah filled
with flavored tobacco with weed
sprinkled on top.
A freshman boy was talking
about his epic day, when he began
the morning with a "wake and bake"
and had continued smoking in be
tween classes and at any other
time he could find a break. It was,
after all, a holiday.
"If you're only going to smoke
once a year, you've got to smoke on
4/20," he said.
