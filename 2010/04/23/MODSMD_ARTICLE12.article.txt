\f \I crisis in cen-
T turies, possi
bly in church history," read a National
Catholic Reporter editorial from
March 26,2010.
Since the 19905, when a wave of
abuse scandals first came to public at
tention in the United States and Ire
land, abuses by Catholic priests have
ignited a firestorm of public contro
versy, raising questions about
whether there are deep-seated insti
tutional problems within the Catholic
Church or whether an overzealous
media has sensationalized the abuses.
Now, with the uncovering of another
round of Catholic priest abuses in Ire
land, those questions have reemerged
in the national dialogue.
And here at the Farm. Catholics
are grappling with the same issues,
trying to make sense of the abuse
scandals.
"My stomach does a somersault
every time I hear a news story about
this," said Father Carl Schlichte, asso
ciate director of the Stanford Catholic
community. "I know the damage
that's done, not just to the victims, but
to the other faithful priests and the be
lievers who are just trying to follow
the Lord the best they can."
From editorials comparing bish
ops to Enron CEOs and preachers
comparing the media's fixation on the
abuse scandals to anti-Semitism,
many in Stanford's Catholic commu
nity don't know where to turn for the
truth. One of the biggest obstacles
Stanford students face is disaggregat
ing fact from embellishment.
"It's despicable, the [abuses] that
went on and the way things were per
petrated," said Mike Davenport, a
sixth-year graduate student in the
Catholic community. "But some of
the portrayals have been unfair, par
ticularly the way Pope Benedict has
been portrayed."
"You can't just go to one source
you can't just go to the New York
Times, but you also can't just go to the
most pro-Catholic apologist you can
find," added Charlie Capps 'lO, a
member of the Catholic Undergradu
ate Leadership Team. "If you find a
variety of sources, you can sift through
all the agendas."
At Stanford, some Catholics be
lieve that the appearance of out-of
control Catholic abuse deniers stems
from a non-tech savvy Vatican. Oth
ers feel that the media is to blame,
quickly pouncing on any comment
and painting it as the opinion of the
entire Vatican. Still others believe that
the Vatican needs to accept all respon
sibility for the clergy's statements.
"The nature of the papal position
is that you take responsibility it
puts a huge burden on the Pope; and
even though it may seem unfair, it's
the position he's in. Repentance is the
most appropriate response," said
Tommy Pauly'l2.
Students have sought help from
each other in making sense of the con
flicting media reports and Vatican
statements, turning to each other on
conversation forums and e-mail chat
lists.
While no formal conversation has
taken place at Stanford so far, last
weekend's mass did bring up a men
tion of the abuse. In order to foster

more of a dialogue on the issue, Stan
ford clergy will hold a forum this Sat
urday led by Thomas Plante, a Santa
Clara psychology professor.
Plante, who has worked extensive
ly in examining abuse within the
Catholic Church, will bring a bal
anced, outside perspective to help stu
dents put their worries in perspective.
"I'm happily surprised and im
pressed that they did something, be
cause they didn't have to," Pauly said.
In contrast to pundits and many
Catholics who believe that massive
systemic overhauls are necessary to
deal with the Church's abuse prob
lems, many at Stanford believe that
the Church has already made the
most necessary changes.
"I think the changes that were to
be made have already been made,"
Capps said. "The protocol is a lot
clearer for bishops now, and what
we're seeing is just more old scandals
coming out."
New doctrines within the Church
in the past decade have set up a more
efficient structure for dealing with
sexual abuse, as well as increased psy
chological screening for priests. But,
while these are steps in the right direc
tion, said Fr. Schlichte, "for better or
for worse, the church makes haste
slowly."
Throughout this abuse scandal,
Stanford's Catholic community has
focused on the Catholic teaching of
repentance to deal with the issue. And
they have re-emphasized the impor
tance of faith.
"Even if there could be a good ar
gument made for no more church hi
erarchy or for priests marrying, I don't
think that is the proper response to
these current issues," Pauly said. "The
changes should be more in the heart
of the organization, more in coming
back to the actual spirit of things,
rather than just rearranging."
Students hope that a focus on the
Church's true values can help it over
come its image in the media and the
pockmarks on its conscience.
"These are very un-Christian
things," Davenport said. "If people
lived up to their ideals at all levels we
wouldn't have these problems, but
we're only human."
Capps echoed this view, struggling
to find the right words.
"The Church is made up of simple
people that's the whole reason we
need Jesus Christ," he said. "To have a
solid, robust Catholic faith doesn't
mean you have to believe that every
thing every member does is always
the best thing to do."
He added, "Believing the facts
shouldn't be incompatible with faith."
