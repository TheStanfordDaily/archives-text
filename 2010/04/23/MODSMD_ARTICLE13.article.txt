# OPINIONS
## EDITORIAL An open letter to all ProFros on campus for Admit Weekend 
### 
Where you decide to attend college is
one of the most important decisions
that you will make in your life. For
that reason, it is a good thing that you are
here on the Farm right now. We, the Editorial
Board, hope that you feel welcome here at
Stanford. There are seemingly unlimited aca
demic resources here at Stanford, and think
ing extends well beyond the classroom.
Nowhere else on earth are world-class aca
demics and world-class sports blended so ef
fortlessly. Plus, in case you have not noticed,
we are located in California, and the weather
is beautiful. There are many things about this
University that can impress you, yet some of
the brightest advantages of life on the Farm
are unsung.
Nurtured by the surrounding Silicon Val
ley, there is a very entrepreneurial atmos
phere here at Stanford. Yet opportunities are
not limited to students with specific interests,
as the desire to create and innovate pervades
each area of study here on campus. We hope
that you bring with you all of your passions
because there is a place for every one of them
here. And if there is not, then you will have
ample opportunities to create one.
The entrepreneurial spirit here at Stan
ford is perfectly complemented by the many

genuine, relaxed personalities. You will hear
the phrases "Stanford Duck" and "chill"
thrown around a lot of times this weekend.
Here on campus nearly every student is in
volved in activities beyond academics, and
yet there is usually no way to guess by his or
her behavior. We know that you are probably
involved in many high school activities, and
rest assured that your extracurricular pas
sions need not end now that you are entering
college. Most students at Stanford who are
passionate about things outside of school
whether public service, the arts, athletics or
otherwise are able to find away to keep
their passions a part of their college lives.
Minimizing stress in college is simple if
you are in the right place. We know that
some of you have not yet made a decision as
to whether you will join the Stanford com
munity this year. To those of you who have
decided to come to Stanford, Admit Week
end is a great opportunity to lay the ground
work for your Stanford career. Take note of
the activities that interest you and think
about how you may be able to fit them into
your time next year. Your experience at
Stanford is truly what you make of it; if you
treat your time here as special, it will be spe
cial to you.
