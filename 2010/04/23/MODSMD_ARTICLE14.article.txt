# SENSE AND NONSENSE
## To a New Country, Go! 
### Aysha Bagchi 
There was a beautiful picture in the on
line Times of London travel section this
week of a mother in a Masai village in
Tanzania; she has a shaved head, long ear
rings that hang from the tops of her ears and
colorful layers of cloth wrapped around her
from neck to foot. Another woman in tradi
tional garb stands next to her with a serious
and stoic look, possibly trying to figure out
how to pose after being asked by the western
visitor if he may take their picture. But the
mother is distracted by her little girl, who is
tugging impatiently at her dress in order to
get the attention this intruding photographer
is stealing away. He writes below his photo
graph that children "are the same the world
over."
A human interaction across cultures
teaches us how similar we are in the context
of what are sometimes shocking cultural dif
ferences. I am half-Indian, and sometimes my
friends will joke to me about the strange
things Indians do and don't do, like praying
to hundreds of gods or not using toilet paper
(at least traditionally!). I would love for them
to one day visit India I suspect many of
them would grow attached, feeling the thrill
of personally connecting with people who
take them out of their comfort zones.
These kinds of experiences are so impor
tant for young people; they change us in ways
that few other things can. I remember how
emotionally stirring my experience teaching
English in two villages in western Hungary
was during my first summer at Stanford. I was
nineteen-years-old and had a lot to learn
about myself and the world (an eternal con
dition, I guess). Within two weeks in my first
village, Sojtor, I was thinking more seriously
about what I wanted out of life than ever be
fore, and actually finding some answers.
When I try to make sense of what in my
Hungary experience aided this self-searching
process, a few things come to mind. All the
ways in which I have been fortunate were
drilled home, ways that went even beyond
poverty. I learned from so many of my young
adult students who are pessimistic about
their futures. A bitter history of losing territo
ry at the end of World War I and then suffer
ing under a Communist regime for more than
three decades after a failed revolution
against it in 1956 has left them still barreling
away at the past. Growing up in villages they
love (but must leave one day because there
are no job opportunities) reinforces the pes
simism. One reason they were thrilled to get
to know a young American is that most of
them do not think they will ever get the
chance to visit the U.S. Whenever I have
thought about my own future, my vision has
included a world entirely open to me, so
theirs was a tough outlook for me to absorb.
My time in Hungary involved a lot of fa
miliar experiences in a foreign context. I
played with and looked after the most won
derful children everyday. This prompted
thoughts about what role I want family to
play in my life. The goodness and kindness of
everyone in my village warmed and humbled
me. This prompted a critical reflection on
what kind of person I want to be. In the day
time, I taught and felt the exhilaration of see
ing quick student progress and new friend
ships along the way; in the evenings, 1 helped
till the garden or cook dinner with my gener
ous host families. This prompted a broader

consideration of what kind of profession and
role in the world could sustain my enthusi
asm for a lifetime. By having all these human
experiences outside of my element, I was
able to examine who 1 am and where I am
going with a new pair of eyes.
My experience is not singular. One of my
closest friends at Stanford went to Ghana to
volunteer in an orphanage for three weeks
during our sophomore year and came back
certain she wanted to be a doctor for the first
time. Another friend knew he wanted to be a
doctor until he went to Madrid for a quarter
during his junior year and for the first time
questioned whether it was really for him (he
described the change as "that typical abroad
moment"). Being among different people,
habits and cultural traits forces us to examine
who we are and what we want from an out
side perspective. It reminds us that we are
culturally contingent creatures, giving new
life to the question of what is meaningful to
us. In such moments, we start to take owner
ship of our lives.
Luckily for us, Stanford has terrific study
abroad programs that reach nearly all cor
ners of the globe. If students want a summer
abroad, the Haas Center can help them find
and fund it. Traveling is the sort of thing
whose value is best delivered through experi
ence. We may get the chance later in life, but
by then, many of our choices will have been
made. Now is the time; so venture out!
