# MIDNIGHT FRYER
## Approaching Virginity 
### Yanran Lu 
Many Stanford students have re
mained virgins for various reasons.
Some are religious, and some are
waiting for that "special someone." Then
there exist others, for whom "saving oneself'
is an outdated concept particularly if it is
for some non-descript person in the future
whom one may or may not meet. Some do
not even believe in the institution of mar
riage. Others, women especially, are simply
repulsed by the idea that "virginity is the best
gift a woman can give to a man" because the
idea is rooted in viewing women as posses
sions that a man does not want "his"
woman's body to be "contaminated" by an
other man's touch. Once the woman is not a
virgin, she is "damaged," "impure," or "used"
and therefore "devalued." Thus a woman's
worth peaks before she gives up her virgini
ty. In addition, to "give" yourself to someone
sounds like the offer of a martyr, surrender
ing yourself on the altar, prepared for some
terrible mythical operation to happen to
your body, which in that moment no longer
belongs to you. Therefore, these people do
not place a monumental emphasis on virgin
ity. If anything, it almost seems like a hin
drance to liberty because of these particular
social connotations. Therefore, these people
have remained virgins simply because the
opportunity hasn't come up —or by the
"luck of the draw."
Therefore, being one of "those people"
aforementioned, I have always struggled
with the concept of virginity. Instead of let
ting virginity be infused with power and de
fine my worth as a woman, I wondered how I
could reclaim my agency and claim virginity
for what it is as simply an event in my life
which I have control over. The solution I
came up with involved, instead of thinking of
it as the "best gift" I can give to someone,
thinking of it as something I am doing for
myself as a step closer to the exploration
of what my body is capable of feeling and ex
periencing (which is equally applicable to
male virgins). I also asked myself if I was
ready for sex. What are the consequences?
How can I have safe sex? Pleasurable sex?

Having heard horror stories about how terri
ble, painful and bloody the first time can be, I
was almost ready to "get it out of the way" so
I could enjoy the "adventurous," "pleasura
ble," "ecstatic" sex I have always read about.
Of course, then the question is who is the
"partner in crime"? Should it be a girlfriend?
So I could learn from real experiences (who
can probably also deal with blood better)?
Feeling that homoeroticism was another
playing field, I decided perhaps I would also
postpone first time with a girl. Should it be
from a boyfriend? So I could feel sparks of

"fireworks"? Having also known both male
and female virgins who had their first time
with their significant other and then having
to endure their break-up stories, I decided
that perhaps with a boyfriend was not the
way to go for me either. I am by no means
ready for that level of emotional entangle
ment, particularly realizing that women are
more prone to post-sexual attachment. Hav
ing done my research, I was then ready for
the opportunity to arise so I could stop being
a "virgin-by-luck."
Through my questioning and reasoning, 1
was able to demystify sex, remove it from so
cial implications, see it for what it is and de
fine it for myself. I was taught to put virginity
and sex on a pedestal, but that inevitably just
set me up for disappointment. People some
times like to sell the propaganda that the first
time is the most beautiful thing in the world.
But when they say that, they omit the pain or
the awkwardness that are all associated with
the first time. Perhaps virginity is special
after all there is only one first time (as is the
case with golfing or rock climbing). Because
of the set ups and various other reasons (such
as not being ready for sex), people some
times regret their first time. We should be
honest with ourselves and with our expecta
tions, so we do not set ourselves up for re
grets.
Losing one's virginity is exciting because
it opens doors for sexual exploration. To
many, it marks the entrance into adulthood.
The first time probably won't be perfect.
Like other physical activities, sex takes prac
tice (and active researching of techniques
and tricks) to get better. So what if your first
time is not the crowning moment in your
life? It does not preclude you from having
great sex later in life. Have sex; have great
sex! Do it for the very first time, if you are
ready! And if you have done it already, do it
with just as much excitement and curiosity as
your first time!
