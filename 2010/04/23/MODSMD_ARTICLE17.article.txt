## SWING BACK Card tries to rebound from losing streak 
### DANIEL BOHM SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The No. 9 Stanford softball team looks to get
back on the right track this weekend when it returns
home to play host to No. 6 UCLA (30-9,4-5 Pac-10)
in an important Pacific-10 Conference showdown.
The Cardinal (30-9, 4-5) has lost four in a row
coming into this weekend, including a three-game
sweep at the hands of Arizona last weekend.
This will be Stanford's first game since the sweep,
as a scheduled midweek game against San Jose
State was rained out on Wednesday.
Stanford's biggest concern coming into the
weekend is the health of freshman pitcher Teagan
Gerhart. Gerhart left her start last Friday at Arizona
with an apparent arm injury. The injury was not be
lieved to be serious, but she did not pitch the rest of
the weekend; her availability for the matchups with
UCLA is uncertain.
With Gerhart out, junior Ashley Chinn returned
to the circle with mixed results. For the year, Chinn
is 6-3 with a 3.05-earned run average. If Gerhart
can't go, Chinn, along with freshman Jenna Rich
who is also the team's starting shortstop are ex
pected to throw the majority of the innings for Stan
ford.
Offensively, Stanford has possessed a powerful
lineup all season, led by Rich and senior left fielder
Alissa Haber.
Rich leads the club in home runs and RBIs with
11 and 38, respectively. She is also hitting a very solid
.331 out of the three spot in the Cardinal lineup.

Haber, who is a three-time All-American, leads
the team in almost every other offensive category.
She is hitting .450 with 40 runs scored while slugging
.708.
Haber and Gerhart were recently named to the
25-player USA Softball National Collegiate Player
of the Year award watch list. Haber is also a finalist
for the Lowe's Senior Class Award given annual
ly to an athlete for her performance on and off of the
playing field.
The Cardinal and the Bruins enter the weekend
with identical records in conference and nonconfer
ence play, making the series especially important.
Both teams are part of a four-way tie for fourth
place in the highly competitive Pac-10.
UCLA enters the weekend going in the opposite
direction as Stanford. The Bruins swept Oregon
State last weekend and come in riding high.
Senior Megan Langenfeld paces the offense with
an incredible .507 batting average and nine home
runs. The Bruins use five different pitchers, but the
most innings go to junior Donna Kerr. Kerr is 15-5
with a 1.97 ERA on the year.
Despite UCLA's high ranking and good record,
the Cardinal players see this weekend as an oppor
tunity to make up ground in the Pac-10.
It is a make-or-break weekend for both teams as
the series loser is likely out of contention for the
Pac-10 title.
Action begins at Smith Family Stadium tonight
at 7 p.m.
