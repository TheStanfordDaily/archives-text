# Season-ending showdown
## 
### JUSTIN MARPOLE-BIRD CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
This Saturday the No. 2 Stanford
women's water polo team takes on
the No.l USC Trojans in its final
game of the 2010 regular season.
The stakes for Saturday's contest
are high, with the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation (MPSF) regular
season title and the No. 1 seed at the
MPSF Tournament going to the
winner.
However, expect the ladies to be
primed as the game doubles as Se
nior Day and several of the women
will be receiving recognition as
graduating seniors. Alex Koran, Jes
sica Steffens, Kelly Eaton and
Kelsey Holshouser will be honored
as the Card's four graduating play
ers before taking to the pool at 4
p.m. on Saturday. Dubbed in press
releases as the "Clash of the Titans,"
the women will undoubtedly be
looking for a little bit of revenge, as
it was the Trojans who defeated the
Cardinal at the UC-Irvine Invita
tional earlier in the year to jump
ahead of Stanford for the No. 1
ranking.
When interviewed after the tour
nament in Irvine, senior two-meter

Jessica Steffens said, "We will be
looking forward to the next chance
we get to play USC down the road.
We know we can beat them and will
be excited to play them again."
This is a perfect opportunity for
not only Steffens and the other sen
iors, but also the entire squad to get
another crack at the Trojans before
heading to the postseason.
The Cardinal (21-1, 6-0 MPSF)
continued its undefeated run in
MPSF play last Saturday at Avery
Aquatic Center, winning its 10th
consecutive Big Splash against Cal
ifornia with a dramatic, last-second
8-7 victory over the Golden Bears.
The teams battled back and forth
the entire duration of the contest,
playing to a 7-7 stalemate until Stef
fens fired home from about eight
meters with one second remaining
to clinch the victory. Junior driver
Kim Krueger also scored twice for
the Cardinal, while junior goal
tender Amber Oland made seven
saves and held California scoreless
in the final period.
USC (19-1, 5-0 MPSF) will play
its final two regular-season contests
this weekend, facing off against San
Jose State this afternoon before the
big clash at Stanford Saturday. The

Women of Troy will bring their 17-
game winning streak to the Bay
Area this weekend. USC, last year's
national runner-up, is led by the
play of Joelle Bekhazi (40 goals)
and Kally Lucas (32), while in the
cage Tumua Anae leads the MPSF
with 9.95 saves per game and allows
just 4.60 goals per game.
The Stanford-USC rivalry is just
as fierce in the pool as it is on the
football, baseball and soccer fields, as
over the past three seasons (includ
ing 2010) the schools have fought to
a near standstill in women's water
polo. In 2008, the teams split four
meetings, but the Women of Troy got
the upper hand with wins at the
MPSF Tournament and NCAA
Championships, while last season,
USC won three of the four meetings
including the two tournament wins.
So far this year, the teams have each
won a match, and have been the only
two schools to be ranked No. 1 this
season. Saturday's regular season fi
nale could very well not be the last
meeting of the two schools this sea
son, but it will go a long way toward
determining the postseason paths of
each team.

The Card is riding a wave of con
fidence from the Big Splash as the

senior class played a major role in
carrying the women over Cal in per
haps their closest game of the year.
They look to carry that momentum
into their contest with the Trojans

this Saturday. The game will start at
4 p.m. at Avery Aquatic Center.
