# Stanford sports on upswing
## 
### Danny Belch On My Mind 
It is quite nice to see some Stan
ford teams returning to their
past form. For several sports at
Stanford, their histories have
been decorated with champi
onships and all-around great teams.
But in recent years, some Stanford
sports have slipped below that stan
dard and have struggled. A point
should be made that "struggling" at
Stanford probably translates to suc
cess at other schools, such as making
only the first round of the NCAAs or
having a record barely above .500. In
any case, there are at least three teams
on this campus that are righting their
respective ships and turning them
selves back into teams that are legiti
mate contenders for NCAA titles.
These are men's volleyball, women's
tennis and men's tennis.
Men's volleyball is probably as
sured a bid to the four-team NCAA
field this year, something it hasn't done
in 13 years. Four years ago, the team
won three matches in the entire sea
son, and ever since, it has slowly pro
gressed upward to being this year's
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation
(MPSF) champions, the No. 1 seed for
the MPSF Tournament and barring
any unforeseen circumstance a
NCAA semifinalist. Stanford's last of
six conference titles came in 1997, the
same year it won its last NCAA title.
This year's team looks as good as any
in the nation, and the team is a legiti
mate contender for the NCAA title. It
would be a long time coming. It would
also set the team up nicely for the fu
ture, as success breeds success in terms
of new, outstanding recruits. Stanford
men's volleyball could be on the verge
of an era of wild success.
The Stanford women's tennis team
knows championships better than al
most any team on this campus, having
captured 15 NCAA titles. In a six-year
span from 2001-2006, the team won
five NCAA titles, only falling in 2003,
when Stanford finished second. The
1986-1991 women's tennis teams actu
ally went all the way, winning six
straight NCAA titles.
Stanford has not seen the top of the
podium since 2006. While it is quite nit
picky to say that Stanford is not having
as much success as it has had in the
past, it is true that the team has been
"underachieving" over the past three
years. But this year, the Stanford
women are poised to reverse that
trend.They are 20-1 on the season, won
the Pac-10 with an 8-0 record and will
surely receive a favorable seed in the
upcoming NCAA Tournament. With
some solid players at the top of the
lineup and some young talent that has
contributed in big ways, the team has a
chance to go all the way. This year
could be the year Stanford halts the
"downward" trend and gets back to
the championship-winning ways that
so many previous teams possessed.
Another team that is no stranger to
NCAA titles is the men's tennis team.
It is the most decorated sports pro
gram on the Stanford campus, having
captured 17 NCAA titles and another
five runners-up. But the team has not
won an NCAA title since 2000, and has
been through some down seasons
since then. But the recruits got better.
After making the final 16 of the
NCAA Tournament last year the
team's best result in three years
today, Stanford finds itself the No. 7
team in the nation and the 2010 Pac-10
co-champions. The starting lineup fea
tures just one senior and several highly
ranked individual players. The team
has shown it can beat anyone in the na
tion this year, with several wins over
top-10 opponents. Stanford has the tal
ent to advance far into the N CAAs this
year if it can continue to play well (the
Cardinal is currently on a seven-match
win streak).
While men's tennis, women's tennis
and men's volleyball are definitely not
the only sports at Stanford having suc
cess this year, they are three teams that
have bounced back from some recent
struggles and down years. When you
hail from the school dubbed the
"Home of Champions," anything less
is an internal disappointment, and
everyone knows that the team is capa
ble of better things. For these three
teams, better days are certainly here
and hopefully here to stay.

cess get to his head. Calm him down at
