# Blackstage Theater Goes Abstract
##

On a cold night, with a
sun-setting sky like Trix
yogurt, this writer walks
into the Papua New Guinea
Sculpture Garden to be greeted by
figures in the forest, walking
between wooden statues of croco
diles climbing down into the dark
bed of woodchips. What sounds
like a shrooms-induced dream
was actually the press preview of,
"Said the Shotgun to the Head,"
the Blackstage Theater Company's
first show of spring quarter.
Originally an epic poem writ
ten by Saul Williams, it has been
adapted for the stage by Alan Holt
'll. The project was developed
while Holt was studying abroad in
Madrid during winter quarter,

and practices for the performance
began at the start of spring quar
ter. This show marks the first
show of the quarter for
Blackstage, a student performance

group dedicated to presenting
multicultural work and pro
moting black expression
through theater.
Holt got the idea to work
with "Shotgun" after taking
"Muse, Music and Musing," a
class taught by Williams him
self last year Tabatha
Robinson 'l2, choreographer
for this one-man show,
described the class as "sick, sick,

sick." Four Stanford students have
taken Williams' abstract epic and
transformed it into a uniquely

Blackstage dramatic experience.
While it's hard to say exactly what
"Shotgun" is about the
abstractness of the piece was what
initially attracted Holt to adapt it

for the stage the play focused
on the coming of a female messi
ah told through the voice of a

beggar, played by Kiyan Williams
'l3.
The eerie serenity of the
Sculpture Garden after dark
proved to be the perfect visual

frame for Williams' solo per
formance. The forest felt like a
veritable oasis among the
campus commotion the
calm of the space was only
disturbed by the occasional
perplexed jogger or beeping
Marguerite shuttle. The show
is comprised of 45 minutes of
10 poems blended into one
mega-poem, recited by
Williams in what he considers

to be his debut acting perform
ance. Holt's adaptation of
"Shotgun" is a song, a dance, a

play and a poem. There is so
much meaning in the movement,
and the depth and amorphous
ness of the stage make the entire
experience a wholly engaging one.
The warm timbre of Williams'
voice and his graceful movements
are accented by an original score
composed by junior David
Kettler, a "genius," in the words of
Holt, who brought in all his
instruments and began improvis
ing, until he found a subtle sound
that worked for the show.
45 minutes of an abstract
monologue is bound to leave even
the most erudite audience con
fused for at least a moment. But
even if you don't understand the
entire poem, you'll find parts that

affect you whether it's
Williams' description of a
woman's "eyes like two turnta-

bles" or his thoughts on the state
of the union, there are guaranteed
to be at least a few lines that will

hit you and make you think.
Every member of the audience
will have her or his own interpre
tation of the show for Holt,
"it's a piece about the human
condition. I know that sounds a
little vague, but it's a love story,
it's a story of pain, it's a story of
loss and memory. It's coming out
of this post-9/11 world we're liv
ing in and trying to find a true
sense of identity, despite all this
destruction and all this war going
on around us. It's really about
love, I think." Robinson calls it "a
twisted love song," while for
Williams, "Shotgun" is a
"provocative piece" that "encour

ages the audience to go on this
journey with us to examine the
beliefs and values that are central
to our lives and our being."
Even if you don't consider
yourself a fan of avant-garde
poetry, you will undoubtedly
learn something about yourself in
those 45 minutes in the Stanford
sculpture sanctuary. My only
advice: dress warmly. And come
with an open mind.
