# Fashion Fest: What's hot and What's Not
## 
### â€“ mel BRIDGES contact mel: mbridges@stanford. edu 
This year's Coachella was the best that it has been in
quite a while. Amazing music, sweet installations
and even a Ferris wheel! One of my personal
favorite attractions was the motorized "Light-up Shark,"
which moved by itself and can travel up to 25 mph, which
was mind-blowing. When I wasn't entrenched in the crowd
for Dirty Projectors or on the outskirts of Hot Chip eating
what festival-goers call "Spicy Pie," you bet that I was
scoping out Coachella fashion. While some people brought
their fashion A-game to Coachella, other outfit choices
were questionable but when I saw an outfit I liked, I
really liked it.

Rompers

I love rompers! My favorite Coachella rompers had
adorable small floral print and/or had inventive cutouts.
Some rompers were solid in color, but had great cutout
shapes on the lower back or above the midriff.

Wide-brimmed floppy hats

These hats were not something I was expecting to like, but
they really caught my eye! These floppy hats not only pro
tected smart Coachella fans' faces, but also looked so classy.
Paired with big dark sunglasses, they looked dramatic and
flirty. And of course, these hats look so chic with every
thing!

Lace T-shirts
How many kinds of lace clothes did I see at Coachella?
Hundreds. Some worked less well than others. However, I
loved the lace T-shirts that I saw in the crowds. They were
airy and elegant perfect for the desert. These shirts
should be lightweight and paired with layered necklaces
and chunky bracelets. They also look great with cut-off
denim shorts! (But let's clarify that cut-off shorts does not
mean that they should cover less than your bright red
Victoria's Secret booty shorts ... puh-lease.)

These pieces really rocked the concert grounds, but let me
just say that there were more fashion faux pas than there
were hippies smoking weed. I was shocked by what people
thought was appropriate attire! Here are some of
Coachella's most shocking moments, and evidence for why
a good taste in music does not necessarily equate to a good
taste in style.

How to NOT Wear Your Hair

If you have plastic flowers, bad pieces of streaked exten
sions, an upside-down-turned visor circa the fifth grade
beach party in 1998, double-stacked Justin Timberlake
fedoras or (the worst) actual lanyard strings tied into your
hair making you look like a Chia Pet, then you do NOT
look cute!

How to NOT Wear Your Clothes

If your body needs a trip to the gym, that does not mean
that you should leave your articles of clothing at home. It
seems as though the more that people let their body go, the
less clothing they think they can wear. This year, the gut
hanging out over those short shorts and under those crop
tops (on men and women alike) was just plain rude. Know
what's flattering for your body type, and as a general safety
rule, if an outfit is something that you would expect to see
in a strip club, you probably shouldn't risk wearing it!
