## Moving on after atrocity Zalaquett speaks of transitional justice 
### CAITY MONROE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
"The important thing is not to let
your heart grow cold while keeping
your head cool."

It was with this assertion that
Helen Stacy, a senior lecturer in law,
introduced Jose Zalaquett, Chilean
lawyer, legal scholar and human
rights defender, at his lecture on
Thursday evening.

The quote, spoken by Zalaquett in
a previous interview, was an apt way
to acquaint the audience with a man
who, despite being exiled for 10 years
and having encountered thousands
of stories of oppression and mass
atrocity, demonstrated a mastery of
balancing idealism and realism all
while maintaining an evident sense of
morality and empathy.

"I do believe that law and ethics
correlate a lot," he said. "They are in
my view like overlapping circles ...
and that area of overlap may be more
or less considerable."

Most of Zalaquett's lecture fo
cused on transitional justice and the
various options for repairing and re
constructing a nation in the after
math of mass atrocity. Zalaquett is
renowned for his work defending
human rights in his home country
during General Augusto Pinochet's
oppressive regime. Having served on
Chile's National Truth and Reconcil
iation Commission, Zalaquett has
first-hand experience with the im
portance of acknowledging atrocities
and revealing the truth however
grim it may be.
"The idea that these atrocities may
be left in the dark is repugnant to basic
moral principles," he said.
Stanford history Prof. James
Campbell and political science Prof
Terry Karl provided commentary on
Zalaquett's lecture. Both sided with
him on the importance of truth and
recognition post-atrocity. However, all
three also agreed that there are certain
restrictions on truth's ability to prevail
and on the capacity of post-conflict so
cieties to both uncover and subse
quently handle such knowledge.
"One of the things that alarms me is
that the more normal truth commis
sions become and the more normal
some qualified amnesty provisions be
come ... the more difficult it becomes
to bring persecution to perpetrators of
mass atrocity," Campbell said, high
lighting, as all three speakers did at
some point during the event, one of
the commonly-cited problems of such
situations.
Dealing with complex issues of eth
nic cleansing, mass atrocity and geno
cide is difficult and it appears that the
general consensus on the matter is that
there is no ideal solution.
Zalaquett depicted the transitional
justice dilemma as necessary and
promising, yet did so in a realistic
framework.
"It's a human endeavor, and
human endeavors fail more than they

succeed. Which is all the more reason
to try over and over again," he said.
This acknowledgment of some of
the political and logistical restrictions
that limit post-atrocity negotiations
was one thing that students most ap
preciated about the lecture.
"This guy is amazing... He is one
of the first people who acknowledged
the idea that you have political con
straints in post-conflict scenarios, and
you have to deal with it," said Cristina
Brandao, a student SPILS fellow in the
law school's masters program. "This is,
in my opinion, what makes him so im
portant ... somebody has to say this."
Another part of the talk that ap
pealed to many in attendance was the

way in which Zalaquett spoke of ac
knowledgement. He emphasized that
there is knowledge, and there is ac
knowledgement. In her comments
after Zalaquett's presentation, Karl
added that such acknowledgement is
particularly difficult for big powers
like the United States that have been
complicit in many different human
rights violations.
"I really liked his distinction be
tween acknowledgement and knowl
edge," said Lila Kalaf 'lO. "We know
that our government does some pretty
messed up things all the time, but we
don't acknowledge it. And the step be
tween knowledge and acknowledg
ment is so huge for Americans... it
probably causes a lot of upheaval be
cause once you acknowledge some
thing, it usually starts to require ac
tion."
