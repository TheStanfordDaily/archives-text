## Moving on after atrocity Zalaquett speaks of transitional justice 
### CAITY MONROE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
"The important thing is not to let
your heart grow cold while keeping
your head cool."

It was with this assertion that
Helen Stacy, a senior lecturer in law,
introduced Jose Zalaquett, Chilean
lawyer, legal scholar and human
rights defender, at his lecture on
Thursday evening.

The quote, spoken by Zalaquett in
a previous interview, was an apt way
to acquaint the audience with a man
who, despite being exiled for 10 years
and having encountered thousands
of stories of oppression and mass
atrocity, demonstrated a mastery of
balancing idealism and realism all
while maintaining an evident sense of
morality and empathy.

"I do believe that law and ethics
correlate a lot," he said. "They are in
my view like overlapping circles ...
and that area of overlap may be more
or less considerable."

Most of Zalaquett's lecture fo
cused on transitional justice and the
various options for repairing and re
constructing a nation in the after
math of mass atrocity. Zalaquett is
renowned for his work defending
human rights in his home country
during General Augusto Pinochet's
oppressive regime. Having served on
Chile's National Truth and Reconcil
iation Commission, Zalaquett has
first-hand experience with the im
portance of acknowledging atrocities
and revealing the truth however
grim it may be.
