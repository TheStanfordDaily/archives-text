MAJOR LAZER

After being introduced through their mutual friend and colleague,
red-hot producers Diplo and Switch created and collaborated on a
project called Major Lazer to enormous success. Their debut album,
"Guns Don't Kill People ... Lazers Do" was released June 2009. Drawing
heavily on reggae infused with hip hop and insane bass tracks, a smash-hit
was born. The music video for "Pon De Floor" is both notorious and
revered, and the video for "Hold the Line" was nominated for an MTV
Video Award. After garnering so much hype in such a short time, the duo
was invited to perform Saturday evening, and fans or not, the Mojave tent
was jampacked.
With Diplo and Switch set up with turn tables and computers in the
back, dressed in understated suits, many were initially unsure of the show
that was to come. That quickly changed when the industrial strength lasers
began to sweep over the crowd, while enormous Chinese dragons danced
around on stage. When hypeman Skerrit Bwoy took the stage, along with
an insanely talented dance partner, things got wild. His triple mohawks,
serious dance moves and infectious energy led the massive crowd to a bor
derline riot. The soundtrack was excellent, but more than anything, Major
Lazer was a spectacle not to be missed.

GORILLAZ

For the Gorillaz diehards desperate to be at the front of the stage for
Coachella's closing set, listening to the cheers from the Thom Yorke crowd
before Damon Albarn, the man behind the monkeys, took the stage was
torturous. Waiting for hours in a crowded pit, the excitement was palpable
as the massive video screens began to fire up and a recorded Snoop Dogg
announced, "Welcome to the plastic beach."
Albarn and an orchestra took the stage in nautical outfits, and the
audience was reassured that the long wait wasn't for nothing. While tradi
tional Gorillaz concerts use holograms and elaborate visual effects, the fes
tival setting forced the set to be scaled down to something like Gorillaz Lite.
The video screens added an intense aesthetic created by Gorillaz artist
Jamie Hewlett, but in a rare turn, Albarn sang not in shadow, but instead
fully visible for the crowd. Albarn justified his legendary status by singng
with incredible soul and flawless pitch, carrying an infectious energy
throughout the entire set. Appearances by De La Soul, Mick Jones and
Bobby Womack added considerable star power and talent to the show and
the crowd went wild for smash-hits "Feel Good, Inc." and "Clint Eastwood."
Albarn shone on tracks from his new album, "Rhinestone Eyes" and "On
Melancholy Hill," the latter of which moved many to tears. While the set list
showcased some great songs, the audience was left without an effective
closing number to round out the weekend, leaving many unsatisfied.
Regardless, Gorillaz has proved time and time again, and this weekend was
no exception, that this cartoon band is not a joke.

DEADMAUS

Rave enthusiasts came out in droves for this year's festival, and when
anywhere near the Sahara tent, it was impossible to escape the flashing
lights, strobes and lasers emanating from the stage, the art and the crowd
themselves. In perhaps one of the best sets of the entire weekend, legendary
electro house producer Joel Zimmerman, commonly known as Deadmaus,

proved to both his most loyal followers and ambivalent listeners why he is
considered one of the best producers in the world. Closing out the festival
on Friday night, Deadmaus took the stage in his signature sinister Mickey
Mouse head, except unlike ever before, it was rigged with unbelievable LED
lights, changing throughout the set, mesmerizing the crowd along with his
irresistible beats and thumping bass tracks. Perched atop a flashing dais,
Deadmaus ruled over an enormous crowd, assembling tracks off the cuff
and building an audience energy unlike anything I've ever experienced
before. Raver or not, Deadmaus is a must-see performer, with a talent that
will go down in electronic history.

SPOON

Austin-based veterans Spoon spun through a list of their best hits with
a cool demeanor that complemented the hazy sunset against the main stage
as the day began to morph into night on Sunday evening. Although the
crowd was a bit sparse, that left all the more room for those tired out by the
weekend to rock out while sitting down to classics like "I Turn My Camera
On" and "The Way We Get By." The band, known for its music's tendency
to evolve into long, jam-like repetitive crescendos, took advantage of the
live setting to draw out songs such as "Don't Make Me A Target" to its
stretching point. Near the end of the set, Spoon drove "The Underdog"
backed by a full brass section to a climax when Britt Daniel threw the
upright piano over onto its back, serving as a sufficiently powerful punctu
ation to the song. Many audience members, thinking this was the end of
the show, joined the wave of people migrating toward the Outdoor stage to
see Phoenix, but Spoon wasn't done yet. Broken piano lingering on stage,
the band whipped out one final song "Black Like Me" before signing
off with a humble, "Thanks, guys, but we've got to go."

THOM YORKE

The crowd that gathered to wait
a full hour for Thom Yorke and his
backing band Atoms for Peace was a
crowd that waited with bated breath
and touchy attitudes. Near the front
of the stage, a few terse exchanges
almost grew to fights in the cramped
space. When the band took the stage,
though, all was forgotten. Atoms for
Peace, driven by the epileptic stage
antics of Yorke and bassist Flea,
pushed the sparse music from
Yorke's solo album "The Eraser" into
a full-blown, fully-fleshed musical
freakout backed with a complete
band and plenty of energy. Around
the middle, though, Yorke dismissed
the band from the stage and, taking
up his acoustic guitar, went through
an acoustic version of "Give Up the
Ghost," ("You won't recognize this
one unless you spend too much time
on You Tube," he said to the audi
ence) where he skillfully looped a
chorus of "Don't hurt me" over and
over and half sang, half moaned a
melody above it. Then, he struck up
the opening melody of "Airbag" to an
uncontrollable wave of cheers, mor
phing the Radiohead classic into a
haunting, beautiful acoustic solo. Up
next was a piano-driven take on
"Everything In Its Right Place" in
his words, "for old times' sake." Then
it was back to the lightshow-driven
stage seizures of wildly exciting
music with the backing band for a
quick finisher before, with one last
thanks to the crowd, Yorke took his
leave, and the crowd moved en masse
to find Gorillaz on the main stage to
cap off the weekend.

PASSION PIT

Friday afternoon found
Cambridge-based Passion Pit wel
coming in the benevolence of cool
early evening with a lively show.
After a rough first day on the polo
grounds, concertgoers readily wel
comed the setting sun against the
band's irresistibly chipper sounds.

The show drew heavily from its first and only full studio album, "Manners,"
opening the show with its first track, "Make Light." Frontman Michael
Angelakos' distinctively high-pitched voice projected easily over the eager
crowd's faces as they flocked to the Outdoor stage. The band acknowledged
humbly that this was the biggest audience they'd played to yet, and did
their best to engage the audience, at one point shouting out, "How rowdy
can we get on this m f ing property?!" Moving through hits like
"Sleepyhead" and "Smile Upon Me," the quintet riled up the crowd, letting
them know that, "If you're not familiar with a Passion Pit show, you should
know it requires audience participation." The band capped off their evening
set with "Little Secrets," leading the audience to sing as a group about going
"higher and higher and higher, higher and higher and higher" an oddly
fitting transition from day to night as the artificial lights across the polo
grounds lit up to replace the sunlight.

JULIAN CASABLANCAS

Julian Casablancas knew he was coming to Coachella with a sparse
picking of original material. He also knew that his job was to make that
material last the massive 55-minute set he was allotted in the Mojave Tent
on Sunday afternoon. Did he do it? Well, judging by the fact that he played
a Christmas Song "Christmas Treat" a la Saturday Night Live the
clear answer was no. While The Strokes' frontman has the charisma to han
dle any crowd, he couldn't make up for the fact that his only working mate
rial was a nine-song album. It was indeed a disappointment, but what
could we expect? Casablancas can play "Hard to Explain" and continue on
his solo expedition for as long as he wants, but it ain't the collective beauty
that is The Strokes.
