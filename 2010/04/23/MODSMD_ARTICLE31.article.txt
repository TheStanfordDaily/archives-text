# Remote Nomad: [Insert Cat Noise]

Are you familiar with that
Wednesday night ABC
half-hour comedy... that
isn't "Modern Family?" "Modern
Family" has gained cult status on
this campus and throughout the
country, as viewers flock to the

goofy humor of Phil and the
anachronistic maturity of Manny.
"Modern Family" has swept criti
cisms of sexism and unnecessary
product placement (Apple did not
pay for the iPad episode) under
the rug of the Dunphy home to

become the new "30 Rock."
For me, however, "Modern
Family" suffers from the same
inconsistencies as "30 Rock."
Numerous nonsensical celebrity
guest stars, the inability to main
tain simultaneous plot lines and
bad episode premises have regu
larly plagued both comedy power
houses this season. Disillusioned
with the comedic balance of these
shining stars, where do I turn?
Well, I scroll down to the "You
Might Also Like" section of Hulu
and click on "Cougar Town."
Before I begin to sing its

praises, let it be known that 1
absolutely despise "Friends," so
my attachment to this Courtney
Cox vehicle is not merely a mani
festation of my lingering affection
for Monica Geller. I love "Cougar
Town" because it is consistently

absurd, irreverent and crass. Not
unlike myself.
I think that the title and its
setting have misled many viewers
about the show's modus operan
di. Cox's character, Jules, is a 40-
year-old single mother in an

overdeveloped Florida suburb.
Though she is by definition a
"cougar," the show has not harped
on her age or the youthfulness of
her intermittent sexual partners.
Instead, Jules grapples on a day to
day basis with issues of parenting,
friendship and work, while the
creators save her existential crises
about loneliness and companion
ship for particularly emotional
episodes. She is more often sur
rounded by her 20-year-old co
worker, Laurie, and her next-door
neighbor, Ellie, than by younger
men. This trium-gyn-ate of

women, and the show itself, is
able to mock the rare cougar
impulse because the writers of the
show employ the stereotype spar
ingly. This is not Fox reality tele
vision "Cougar Town" is an
experiment in the absurdity of
male cluelessness and of female
obsession. In my opinion, the
concept of the "cougar" has been
brilliantly reinterpreted as an
examination of the power rela
tionships related to gender and
age. Perhaps I have been too
eager to compare these wine-guz
zling, bathroom-loving, body-fix
ating older women to the moms I
see skipping to yoga class in Palo
Alto; nevertheless, the genius of
this show lies in its departure
from reality and its sparing use of
sentimentality. Every episode of
"Modern Family" ends with a
voiceover lesson, but every
episode of "Cougar Town" ends
with a punch line.
Other reasons "Modern
Family" seems to appeal to the
Stanford population are its liberal
politics and preference for
"Office" age deadpan. "Cougar
Town" abandons both of these to
create a product that is more
character-driven and compelling.
Where "Modern Family," and sar
casm in general, often fail to read,
the antics of the Cougar crew
never cease to put a smile on my
face: Jules' ex-husband lives on
land in a boat named "Jealous
Much?"; Elbe's husband ties his

baby son to his leg with a rope so
that he doesn't lose him and Jules
converts everyone to wearing a
"slanket." This is not nuanced
social commentary, just parody.
My favorite character on the show
is the seeming "straight" man, the
neighbor Bobby, who sleeps only
with girls under 25. The "will they
or won't they" tension between
Bobby and Jules is referenced just
the right amount, and his new
relationship with guest star Sheryl
Crow uses her musical talents
perfectly. Plus, he's hot. These
characters manage to be genuine
in their foolishness and idiocy,
without playing a certain niche or
mocked class of society. If

"Modern Family" is about gim
micks, Cougar Town is about
crazy ideas in a traditional for
mat.
Perhaps I enjoy defying the
dominant preference a little more
than I ought to, but I would hon
estly watch an episode of "Cougar
Town" before an episode of
"Modern Family." The family sit
com has been redefined by both
this year, for sure, though I would
argue that the former has done so
more creatively and consistently.
