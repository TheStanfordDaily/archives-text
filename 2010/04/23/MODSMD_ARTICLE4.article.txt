# SETTING UP
## Men's volleyball begins MPSF Tournament Saturday vs. UCI 
### CHRIS JUHNKE DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford men's volleyball team looks
to continue its regular-season success as it
hosts No. 8 seed UC-Irvine (15-14, 10-12
MPSF) in the first round of the Mountain Pa
cific Sports Federation (MPSF) Tournament
on Saturday night.

The Cardinal, who will enjoy home-court
advantage throughout the playoffs, enters
postseason play as the No. 1 seed in the tourna
ment and the No. 1 team in the country after
going 19-6 overall this season with a 16-6 con
ference record.

"The No. 1 seed in the MPSF Tournament is
huge," said senior Ed Howell. "It means that
we have the potential to host every postseason
game at Stanford, where we have the best fans
in the nation. Momentum is a key component
to volleyball, and having a home crowd to help
carry our momentum when we are playing
well, or find our stride when we are struggling,
is key."

As if that wasn't enough, several Cardinal
players and head coach John Kosty received
conference awards for their accomplishments

yesterday. In a flood of honors, Kosty was
named the MPSF Coach of the Year, sopho
more outside hitter Brad Lawson was named
MPSF Player of the Year and senior Kawika
Shoji was named to the All-MPSF First Team
for the second year in a row. Adding to the haul
were sophomore libero Erik Shoji and senior
opposite Evan Romero, who garnered second
team all-conference honors.

These awards are an incredible tribute to
the skill and success of the Cardinal this year.
Lawson, who leads the Cardinal in kills per set
with 4.78, couples with Romero to anchor
Stanford's top-ranked offense, a key aspect of
this season's team. In addition, Kosty has
achieved an incredible feat as head coach, tak
ing the Cardinal from last place in the MPSF in
his first year to first in 2010, merely three years
later.

While these stats are certainly impressive, it
will mean little if the Cardinal can't perform
against the Anteaters on Saturday, an impor
tant step on the road to the team's ultimate
goal of a national championship.
That road is currently blocked by a major
obstacle in the form of the Anteaters, last year's
national champions, who should not be under

estimated simply because of their eighth seed.
In fact, the Anteaters are actually ranked No. 7
nationally, tied with UCLA, and the depth of
the MPSF is such that the top eight teams in the
national rankings are all in the MPSF playoffs.
Irvine is also a familiar foe for the Cardinal,
who toughed out a grueling five-set win at
Irvine in the final match of the season, a win
that secured the No. 1 seed for Stanford. In that
match, Irvine was led by its two all-conference
selections, first team opposite Carson Clark
and second team outside hitter Jordan Du-
Fault. Both players are averaging over four
kills per set and will put pressure on the Cardi
nal to play at its highest level.
In order to overcome the Anteaters and ad
vance, the Cardinal will likely draw on the mo
mentum that comes from going 14-2 in its last
16 matches of the season coupled with the ad
vantage of playing at home in front of enthusi
astic and supportive Cardinal fans.
Stanford does hold the historical edge over
the Anteaters, going 2-0 against them this year
and leading them 26-12 in the overall series.
Furthermore, if the Cardinal wins against
Irvine, it will remain at home for the remainder
of the playoffs, playing in Maples Pavilion,

where Stanford is 10-1 this season.

Winning the tournament isn't the only
route to NCAA postseason play for the Cardi
nal, though. The NCAA Tournament consists
of four teams, three from the three major con
ferences, receiving automatic bids by winning
their conference tournament, and one selected
as an at-large bid. If Stanford does not win the
MPSF Tournament, there is a very good
chance that the Cardinal, the No. 1 team in the
nation, will receive the at-large bid.
Regardless of how it happens, if Stanford
does make the NCAA Tournament, it will be
fortunate to be able to play in Maples Pavilion
again, as the arena is the site of the tournament.
Therefore, as long as the Cardinal continues
winning and stays in the hunt for the national
title, it will continue to play in front of a friend
ly, hometown crowd.

For now though, the Cardinal needs to re
main focused on the task at hand, beating UC-
Irvine and advancing further in the MPSF
Tournament.

The match starts at 7 p.m. on Saturday at
Maples Pavilion.

NOTES: No. 1 Stanford looks to advance
in the MPSF Tournament when it takes
on No. 8 seed UC-lrvine. The Cardinal
and the Anteaters faced off just last

week in Irvine, with Stanford eking out a
five-set win to clinch the No. 1 seed.

With that victory, the Cardinal assured it
self home-court advantage throughout
the postseason, so every Stanford match
for the rest of 2010 will take place at
Maples Pavilion.
