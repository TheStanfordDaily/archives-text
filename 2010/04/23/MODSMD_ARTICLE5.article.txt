# CRUCIAL RIVALRY SERIES
## 
### DANIEL BOHM SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The No. 22 Stanford baseball team wel
comes No. 15 Cal this weekend for a very big
conference series.

The Cardinal (18-13, 7-5 Pac-10) has won
five in a row and it re-entered the national
rankings this week after last weekend's sweep
at Oregon State. The Cardinal has had an up
and-down season and had lost five games in a
row prior to the current win-streak.
Stanford has not played since last week
end's series because a midweek game with
Santa Clara was twice rained out.

This series is especially important for Stan
ford because it currently sits in a tie for third
place in the Pac-10, just a game behind the
Bears (22-11,8-4) for second in the conference.
During its recent surge, the Cardinal has en
joyed a potent offensive attack led by junior
first baseman Jonathan Kaskow.

Kaskow, the reigning Pacific-10 Conference
Player of the Week, enters the weekend leading
the Cardinal with a .455 batting average. He has
been on absolute tear of late, with four consec
utive multi-hit games, going 10-16 overall in
Stanford's last four games.

Junior shortstop Jake Schlander under
stands the importance of having a consistent
hitter like Kaskow anchoring the Cardinal line
up every day.

"It is great to have a steady presence in the
middle of the lineup. He has really been doing
a great job ever since he's had the chance to

play every day," Schlander said.
Although he is a switch-hitter, earlier in the
season Kaskow wasn't starting every game, es
pecially against left-handed pitchers. Recently,
however, head coach Mark Marquess has had
no choice but to play Kaskow every day.
Another key to Stanford's improved play
has been better outings from its starting pitch
ers. The Cardinal has announced a rotation of
sophomore lefty Brett Mooneyham (1-4,6.69)
on Friday, sophomore righty Jordan Pries (3-1,
3.14) on Saturday and sophomore righty Brian
Busick (4-1,3.13) on Sunday for this weekend's
series. Pries and Busick have been the Cardi
nal's two best and most consistent pitchers all
season, while Mooneyham has begun to pitch
somewhat better as the season has progressed.
The Cardinal hopes he will eventually begin to
throw more strikes he has walked 43 batters
in 39 innings and turn into the top recruit
that he was out of high school.
Schlander credits both the pitchers' com
mand and the batters' new approaches at the
plate for the team's recent hot streak.
"We've been playing a lot better and with a
lot more intensity of late," Schlander said.
"We've been a lot more aggressive and the
pitchers have stepped up and followed suit.
They've been throwing a lot more strikes."

part of last year's lineup, but he only
started eight games this season.

Cal comes into the weekend
equally as hot as the Cardinal, having
won 11 of its last 12 games.
One of those wins came against
the Cardinal, a nonconference, mid
week 2-0 win on April 5. Senior Chris
Petrini got the win for the Bears,
going seven shutout innings. Despite
his good outing, Petrini is not sched
uled to be in the rotation this week
end. Cal is expected to send sopho
more righty Erik Johnson (5-2,3.63)
to the mound Friday, freshman lefty
Justin Jones (8-2,2.62) to the hill Sat
urday and sophomore righty Dixon
Anderson (3-1,3.26) on Sunday.
Offensively Cal is led by junior
outfielder/first baseman Mark
Canha, who is hitting .400 with six
homers on the season.

Although playing Cal always
brings out a lot of emotions for Stan
ford players, Schlander says the team
has been downplaying the show
down with its archrival.

"I wouldn't say [Cal] means more.
Every Pac-10 game is big. This is es
pecially big because they are second
in the conference, and we are third,"
Schlander said. "It's a big series for
us. All the Pac-10 games are big for us
from here on out."

The series begins tonight at
Sunken Diamond at 5:30 p.m. Satur
day and Sunday's games will take
place at 1 p.m.
