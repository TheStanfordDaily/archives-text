## LOCAL Stanford-run East Palo Alto Academy lives High school gets two-year extension; fifth grade gets one year; K-4 are cut 
### ELIZABETH TITUS MANAGING EDITOR 
The Ravenswood City School District board voted 3-1 on
Thursday to extend a Stanford-run school's charter until 2012,
when the school's Stanford backers say they will look else
where for a "charter home" for the high school.
Operated by Stanford New Schools in Menlo Park, the high
school will stay open for two more years and the fifth-grade
program until 2011. The K-4 programs, whose test scores were
largely responsible for landing the so-called East Palo Alto
Academy on the state's list of "persistently low-achieving"
schools, will close in June.
Last week, the school board voted to deny Stanford's
school a five-year charter extension, sending its superintend
ent, Maria de la Vega, to negotiate a limited two-year extension
with Stanford.
Linda Darling-Hammond, a Stanford professor and transi
tion advisor on education to President Obama, founded Stan
ford New Schools, the umbrella organization for East Palo
Alto Academy.
Last month, the state labeled the school "persistently low
achieving" based on test scores. With a Growth Academic Per
formance Index score of 605, below the state's target of 800,
Stanford's school fell among the lowest-performing 20 percent
of schools statewide.
Stanford rushed to defend East Palo Alto Academy, saying
the nine-year-old high school's strong performance was
skewed by low scores at the fledgling elementary school, which
opened in 2006.
Deborah Stipek, the dean of the School of Education,
pointed to the high school's numbers: 86 percent of students
graduate, above the state's rate of 80 percent; 96 percent of
graduates go on to two- or four-year colleges; the high school
gained 180 API points in the past seven years. And all this in a
set of schools where 80 percent of 550 students are non-native
English speakers, in a school district where two other schools
also landed on the state's list for poor performance.
But the elementary school's scores were less sterling; its ad
ministrators have appealed its latest API score to the state, and
in 2009,18 percent of second-graders and 11 percent of third
graders scored as proficient in English. In math, 22 percent of
second-graders and 19 percent of third-graders scored as pro
ficient or advanced.
Now, attorneys for Stanford and the district must write the
proposal into a revised facilities use
agreement and memorandum of un
derstanding for approval by the
board.
The agreement also requires that
Stanford New Schools leaves its ele
mentary school facilities on Sheridan
Drive in Menlo Park and abandons a
Proposition 39 facilities request there,
instead operating its fifth grade and
high school at the current high school
site on Pope Street.
Stanford and Ravenswood must

also ensure that Ravenswood gets
"appropriate compensation" for use
of those sites.
On Thursday, district counsel Tim
Fox told the board the negotiated
agreement "appears to be the most el
egant solution" to the disappoint
ment surrounding the test scores at
East Palo Alto Academy Elementary
School. The elementary school and
high school are touted on Stanford's
You Tube page as "new models for K
-12 reform."
Ruben Abrica '7B, a former
Ravenswood board member, told the
board he was concerned with "this
whole high-stakes testing game."
"We live and die by it," Abrica said.
"I think Stanford got a taste of it."

Board President Sharifa Wilson,
Vice President Larry Moody and
Marcelino Lopez voted for the exten
sion. Board member Saree Mading,
an administrator at East Palo Alto
Charter School, voted against it.
"I had to," Mading said. "Principle.
We're not a K-12 district. I don't be
lieve a fifth-grade class should be with
a high school."
"Stanford's been embarrassed,"
she added. "I get that."
Board member John Bostic was
absent from the vote.
Moody said voting for the exten
sion was "in the spirit of the board,"
adding that Stanford has "gone
through their learning curve."
Stipek said Stanford would search

for a new "charter home" for the high
school at the end of the two-year exten
sion. There are no plans to seek a new
elementary school charter, she said.
"Right now, our immediate con
cern is to support our elementary
school children" who must go to new
schools next year, Stipek said.
Superintendent de la Vega said the
fifth-grade program got an extra year
under the agreement because there is
a natural "break" before those stu
dents enter junior high in sixth grade.
She would not say whether or not
the district would consider a renewal
of Stanford's high school charter two
years from now.
A scene apart from last week's
standing room-only meeting, Thurs

day's session was half-empty by the
time the board took up the Stanford
New Schools issue minutes before 11
p.m.
Rudy Rivera, a Guatemalan immi
grant with two children in Stanford
New Schools, sat at the back of the
room.
His daughter, a sophomore at East
Palo Alto Academy High School, will
finish high school there, he said. His
son, a first-grader at the Stanford-run
elementary school, will go next year
to Costano Elementary School,
where a brother also goes.
"I hope Stanford is looking for
something else to continue," Rivera
said. "It's important we have the
school."

He said he preferred it for his chil
dren because of the one-on-one at

Stanford and Ravenswood must

also ensure that Ravenswood gets
"appropriate compensation" for use
of those sites.
On Thursday, district counsel Tim
Fox told the board the negotiated
agreement "appears to be the most el
egant solution" to the disappoint
ment surrounding the test scores at
East Palo Alto Academy Elementary
School. The elementary school and
high school are touted on Stanford's
You Tube page as "new models for K
-12 reform."
Ruben Abrica '7B, a former
Ravenswood board member, told the
board he was concerned with "this
whole high-stakes testing game."
"We live and die by it," Abrica said.
"I think Stanford got a taste of it."

Board President Sharifa Wilson,
Vice President Larry Moody and
Marcelino Lopez voted for the exten
sion. Board member Saree Mading,
an administrator at East Palo Alto
Charter School, voted against it.
"I had to," Mading said. "Principle.
We're not a K-12 district. I don't be
lieve a fifth-grade class should be with
a high school."
"Stanford's been embarrassed,"
she added. "I get that."
Board member John Bostic was
absent from the vote.
Moody said voting for the exten
sion was "in the spirit of the board,"
adding that Stanford has "gone
through their learning curve."
Stipek said Stanford would search

for a new "charter home" for the high
school at the end of the two-year exten
sion. There are no plans to seek a new
elementary school charter, she said.
"Right now, our immediate con
cern is to support our elementary
school children" who must go to new
schools next year, Stipek said.
Superintendent de la Vega said the
fifth-grade program got an extra year
under the agreement because there is
a natural "break" before those stu
dents enter junior high in sixth grade.
She would not say whether or not
the district would consider a renewal
of Stanford's high school charter two
years from now.
A scene apart from last week's
standing room-only meeting, Thurs

day's session was half-empty by the
time the board took up the Stanford
New Schools issue minutes before 11
p.m.
Rudy Rivera, a Guatemalan immi
grant with two children in Stanford
New Schools, sat at the back of the
room.
His daughter, a sophomore at East
Palo Alto Academy High School, will
finish high school there, he said. His
son, a first-grader at the Stanford-run
elementary school, will go next year
to Costano Elementary School,
where a brother also goes.
"I hope Stanford is looking for
something else to continue," Rivera
said. "It's important we have the
school."

He said he preferred it for his chil
dren because of the one-on-one at
tention they got from teachers.
"My kids' education is a priority,"
Rivera said. "It has to work."
