## LOCAL Stanford-run East Palo Alto Academy lives High school gets two-year extension; fifth grade gets one year; K-4 are cut 
### ELIZABETH TITUS MANAGING EDITOR 
The Ravenswood City School District board voted 3-1 on
Thursday to extend a Stanford-run school's charter until 2012,
when the school's Stanford backers say they will look else
where for a "charter home" for the high school.
Operated by Stanford New Schools in Menlo Park, the high
school will stay open for two more years and the fifth-grade
program until 2011. The K-4 programs, whose test scores were
largely responsible for landing the so-called East Palo Alto
Academy on the state's list of "persistently low-achieving"
schools, will close in June.
Last week, the school board voted to deny Stanford's
school a five-year charter extension, sending its superintend
ent, Maria de la Vega, to negotiate a limited two-year extension
with Stanford.
Linda Darling-Hammond, a Stanford professor and transi
tion advisor on education to President Obama, founded Stan
ford New Schools, the umbrella organization for East Palo
Alto Academy.
Last month, the state labeled the school "persistently low
achieving" based on test scores. With a Growth Academic Per
formance Index score of 605, below the state's target of 800,
Stanford's school fell among the lowest-performing 20 percent
of schools statewide.
Stanford rushed to defend East Palo Alto Academy, saying
the nine-year-old high school's strong performance was
skewed by low scores at the fledgling elementary school, which
opened in 2006.
Deborah Stipek, the dean of the School of Education,
pointed to the high school's numbers: 86 percent of students
graduate, above the state's rate of 80 percent; 96 percent of
graduates go on to two- or four-year colleges; the high school
gained 180 API points in the past seven years. And all this in a
set of schools where 80 percent of 550 students are non-native
English speakers, in a school district where two other schools
also landed on the state's list for poor performance.
But the elementary school's scores were less sterling; its ad
ministrators have appealed its latest API score to the state, and
in 2009,18 percent of second-graders and 11 percent of third
graders scored as proficient in English. In math, 22 percent of
second-graders and 19 percent of third-graders scored as pro
ficient or advanced.
Now, attorneys for Stanford and the district must write the
