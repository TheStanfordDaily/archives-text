# ADMIT WEEKEND: THE HOHOS' TAKE
## 
### BRIANNA PANG STAFF WRITER 
Last Thursday afternoon, Jackson
Dartez 'l3, Head House Host
(HoHo) for Ujamaa, was camped
out in front of Arrillaga Alumni
Center, waiting for the throngs of
prospective freshmen (ProFros) to roll in for
Admit Weekend. For Dartez and all the other
Admit Weekend coordinators, it was show
time.
Clapping and cheering, the Head HoHos
greeted each Pro Fro with enthusiastic dorm
chants. It was organized chaos, and excite
ment was at an all-time high.
"It was a cluster**** of Profros, just
milling about," Dartez said. "I was a little
confused, though, because I wasn't sure
where I was supposed to be. The e-mail only
said come pick up your ProFros at Arrillaga,
but they didn't tell us where exactly."
Dartez was just one of the many Head
HoHos who helped plan the whirlwind of
welcome events for the prospective class of
2014. Head HoHos are in charge of program
ming social activities for the ProFros and
showing them the dorm-side of Stanford.
Nearly 10 weeks of planning went into the 72
hours of packed activities that made up
Admit Weekend.

According to Stewart MacGregor-Dennis
'l3, a Head HoHo for East Florence Moore
(FloMo), his team spent about five hours
each the week before, preparing for the
ProFros' arrival. Just days before, the Head
HoHos went door to door, spammed e-mail

lists and posted flyers, getting their dorm
mates to volunteer to house the 1,350 regis
tered ProFros. Their work paid off, and they
ended up recruiting an additional 400 RoHos
to share their rooms.

In planning for Admit Weekend, the Head
HoHos tried to structure their programming
around what they would have liked to see
during their own Admit Weekend.
"It felt like yesterday when I was there
last year," said Bailey Ferrell 'l3, Head
HoHo for Soto.

"I was hoping that they didn't think that
the dorm programming was completely
lame," added Christina Nguyen 'l3, Head
HoHo of West Flo Mo. "For my Admit Week
end, I remember I didn't do any dorm pro
gramming and just ran around campus."
Attempting to give the ProFros a crash
course on the Stanford experience, Head
HoHos planned fountain hopping, hikes to
the Dish and steam tunneling trips. The first
night, they organized dorm icebreakers like
"I love my homie who ..." to capture the
flag to speed dating.
"A few of the ProFros were really inde
pendent though," Macgregor-Dennis said.
"They met some people on Facebook, so they
kinda wandered off. It made it a little bit
more hectic, because we weren't sure where
everyone was."
"But I mean, they are 18 years old," he
added. "We wanted them to be independent,
so they can get used to Stanford."
But Dartez explained that despite their
extensive preparation, programming ran into
last-minute snafus.

"I left the planning of our barbeque up to
another HoHo, but the plans fell through at
the last minute," Dartez said, explaining a
change to an event originally scheduled for
Friday night. "I was left with a cart of raw
meat and forty hungry ProFros and twenty
minutes to find some way to feed them. I was
really anxious and stressed."
Dartez and his team postponed the event
to the next day.
"Somehow, all of Uj rolled in all at once,
and it actually turned out to be a success," he
said. "I was stressed trying to plan it, but I'm
glad it turned out well."
Looking back on the weekend, Head
HoHos had mixed feelings. For some, the
weekend was just an exhausting whirlwind.
Many felt burnt out.
"It was probably my worst week this quar

ter so far," Nguyen said, explaining that she
had an IHUM paper due. "I was sick at the
beginning of the week, and I was trying to do
work while still doing the dorm program
ming."
"I have to thank a lot of HoHos because
they knew I was sorta falling over at that
point, and they stepped in to help," she
added. "A lot of people were really helpful."
"I went to Wilbur Field [across campus],
and sat there for four hours because I just
didn't want to be here [on Saturday]," Dartez
said. "I was just tired of everything by then."
But for other Head HoHos, the sleep dep
rivation was worth it.

"I loved it, because you're talking to peo
ple who are excited and about to make this
huge choice in their lives, and you can really
be enthusiastic and still be very honest to

them," said Robin Perani 'l3, Head HoHo of
Junipero.
"I loved [Admit Weekend] this year, and I
hope to be involved next year," agreed
Daniel DeLong 'l3, Head HoHo for Donner.
"I look forward to seeing all the freshmen
that were here during the weekend. It would
be cool to see them next year as students."
