## Project evaluates Internet Privacy 
### ELIZABETH ROSEN STAFF WRITER 
Of the more than 550,000 appli
cations currently on Facebook Plat
form and the 140,000 applications
available for the iPhone, how many
offer their users valid privacy and
personal security protection? What-
App.org, an application rate-and
review project spearheaded by
Ryan Calo, a law fellow at the Stan
ford Center for Internet and Soci
ety, attempts to answer that ques
tion, one application at a time.
WhatApp.org, now in Beta, de
scribes itself as a forum where expe
rienced Internet users and novices
alike can assess, comment on and
use a five-point scale to rate the pri
vacy and security of a variety of mo
bile and Internet applications.
These include Facebook and
iPhone applications, office suites,
online mapping programs, toolbar
add-ons and media players.
Jonathan Mayer, a graduate stu
dent in law and computer science at
the Center, wrote in an e-mail to
The Daily, "It's no secret that con
sumer software often falls short on
security and privacy ... [ljnforming
users is an important first step."
According to Facebook, 70 per
cent of its users are connected to at
least one application on the Face
book platform.
"There are plenty of people rat
ing and reviewing them, but they're
not doing so on the basis of con
sumer values like privacy and secu
rity," Calo said.
The rating process begins with
experts answering a series of ques
tions on a sliding scale that also in
cludes the option to decline an an
swer. The questions focus on the pri
vacy, security and openness of vari
ous applications. What App summa
rizes these answers and displays
them on its so-called "rating badge,"
alongside developers' notes on the
privacy and security of their respec
tive applications.

According to its website, What-
App "combines traditional con
sumer reporting and review tools
with wikis and news feeds to allow
users to make informed choices
about the applications they down
load."
So far, the website includes re
views and analyses of a few hun
dred applications which are
growing in number each day by
26 law and security experts. Users
have responded positively to the
website, which has yet to encounter
issues with application developers
whose products are under scrutiny.
More than 100,000 people have vis
ited the site.
"We're very happy about the re
ception we've had," Calo said.
"Tliere have been no interpersonal
issues so far it's been wonderful."
The technical aspect of What-
App, however, has posed a few is
sues. According to Calo, creating
and standardizing criteria by which
to judge the security of an applica
tion has been very difficult. Effec
tively evaluating what Calo calls the
"back end" of an application pres
ents another difficulty.
"Even experts can't always fig
ure out exactly how an app is built,
so we've developed a series of
questions [about each application]
to try and get around that," Calo
said.
He added that it's also difficult to
keep up reviews and analyses of ap
plications when developers continu
ally release new versions, both with
improved and worsened security.
Calo describes WhatApp as a
work in progress: although applica
tion assessments are added every
day, the program is not in a position
to comprehensively analyze all the
apps on the web.
"WhatApp is by no means a
magic bullet, but it is a significant
development," Mayer said.
