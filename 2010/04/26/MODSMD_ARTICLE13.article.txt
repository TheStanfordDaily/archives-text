# Small fire breaks out in Storey

### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Elizabeth Titus 
A small fire broke out in a Storey
kitchenette on Friday around 6:09 p.m.
when someone storing boxes of party
supplies turned on a stovetop burner
by accident, causing some of the boxes
to catch fire.
The sprinklers in the kitchenette,
which doubles as a storage room, acti
vated and put out much of the flame
prior to the Palo Alto Fire Depart
ment's arrival to the undergraduate
residence on the lower Row.
PAFD fire captain Aaron Aguilar
said the damage to the room was like
ly "a couple hundred dollars," while
the water damage to the floor and the
basement below was likely "under
$10,000."
Student Housing officials responded
and walked through Storey with fire
fighters about an hour after receiving
the call.
About a dozen residents waited
outside, many of them half-ready for
junior formal, which was Friday night
in San Francisco. Residents were al
lowed in the house one by one, emerg
ing with shower supplies, curling irons
and suits on hangers in preparation for
the annual event.
