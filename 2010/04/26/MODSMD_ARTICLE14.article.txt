## THE
						GAO REPORT The
						Paths Less Taken 
### Shelley Gao 
As I exited Encina Hall last Friday, I was
trying to convince a Pro Fro about the
superiority of our political science de
partment, since she was deciding between
Harvard and Stanford. She was unsure what
she wanted to study, but was adamant that she
wanted to go to law school.

There is something admirable about peo
ple knowing exactly what they want. As Stan
ford students, we are privileged to be able to
choose among many options, for classes, in
ternships and post-graduation plans. Choos
ing seems to be the most difficult part. Howev
er, many undergraduates have already made a
decision regarding their post-Stanford desti
nation before arriving freshman year. Those
wanting to attend law school strategically
shape a college plan that will succeed in the
law school admissions' numbers game. Some
immerse themselves in entrepreneurship and
direct their energies in branding themselves as
future business leaders.

For others, the process of discovering one's
identity can be painstaking, but perhaps a
more multifaceted and rewarding journey. Ex
ploration is an integral part of college. Under
graduate years are a time to take advantage of
all the academic and extracurricular opportu
nities to explore our intellectual interests and
facets of our personality. On this path of twists
and turns, what questions we are interested in,
and how best to pursue those questions, may
evolve.

For some, it might be a class that sparks a
moment of realization, a professor who ignites
our passions or a research project that triggers
new ideas.Then, there are those who engage in
self-initiated contemplation and introspec
tion, a conscious process of information gath
ering and decision-making regarding how to
best craft a trajectory to meet one's interests
and aspirations. Particularly within the hu
manities and social sciences, where tremen
dous freedom is offered, it takes energy and
will to formulate a coherent plan for our time
at Stanford.

The process of planning requires good in
formation and guidance. Freshman advising,
like social security and immigration policy, is
one of those areas that always needs to be re
formed but never is. Less noticeable, however,
is the dearth of resources available to students
seeking to pursue advanced degrees in the hu
manities, arts, sciences or engineering. Com
pared to the resources available in law, busi
ness or medical schools advising, the contrast
is quite stark. In addition to UAR advisors,
there are active student groups dedicated to
providing support for students preparing to
enter the professional fields. Hardly does a
week go by without multiple e-mails being
sent advertising LSAT prep courses or net
working mixers with industry leaders.
Perhaps the correlation between supply
and demand suggests the status quo is a re
flection of the needs of Stanford students.
There is not a strong culture of attending
non-professional graduate school or entering

into academia among my peers. Upon reflec
tion, this is unsurprising, considering the
pragmatic spirit that seems to dominate the
campus. However, there is the increasing
possibility of reconciling the tension between
thought and action, transitioning between
public and private sectors and applying pio
neering research to solving the world's prob
lems in modern academia.

The danger in Stanford's undergraduate
intellectual milieu is that some might even not
consider PhD programs due to the lack of dis
course regarding it as a possibility. This is par
ticularly problematic for students who are the
first generation to attend college or those
from non-academic family backgrounds.
Since advanced degrees involve special
ization, departments should be the focal
points for strengthening advising in their
fields. Individual departments in humanities
and social sciences should devote greater ef
forts towards developing a systematic and
comprehensive structure of graduate school
advising, for example, organizing information
sessions or creating a mentorship program.
From my experience, most graduate students
are gracious and eager to offer honest advice
regarding their career choices. While faculty
members may be useful in clarifying our intel
lectual interests, current students are the best
sources for questions about the lifestyle and
challenge of balancing research, teaching and
coursework.

Each department has the potential to
serve an incredibly important and necessary
role as a bridge between the graduate and un
dergraduate communities. The two groups
operate in very different spheres academical
ly, socially and residentially, resulting in an en
trenched divide. Undergraduates tend to
have no interaction with the graduate popula
tion except with their TAs in discussion sec
tions or peers in certain student activities. Al
though this may be more of an issue in hu
manities and social sciences than natural sci
ences, where lab work demands collaboration
with postdocs, for the majority of undergrads,
it is easy to go for weeks without interacting
with any of the 8000 grads on campus.
While academia is not for everyone, hav
ing more opportunities to gather information
is critical for helping those students still in the
process of self-discovery find their way. Often,
it is the unexpected conversations that have
the most impact.
