# UNFASHIONABLE NONSENSE
## Voicemail, or Party Like It's 1995 
### Emily Hulme 
Once upon an alleged time,man had to
actually talk to his peers, man to man.
What a dreary time it must have been,
devoid as it was of emoticons. How our cave
man forefathers ever managed to organize
themselves to hunt buffalo without Twitter is
quite beyond my understanding, since in my
experience, it takes, at a minimum, two e
mails, sixteen flyers and at least one status
update to induce a college student to show up
for free food. Fortunately, man soon innovat
ed and created pens, phones and chatroulette
(oh hey, six weeks ago). Along the way, man
also realized that sometimes you don't want
to talk right now, and you'd rather leave a
message. Writing is a rather convenient in
vention addressing this particular need.
Now, for some godforsaken reason, a fool
in the hot bed of hot messes (read: Palo Alto)
came up with voicemail. Speaking, of course,
is intended to be in and of the moment; writ
ing, on the other hand, is meant to be record
ed. It's above all a method of stored commu
nication. But this bastard invention mixes the
two humors into a nauseating concoction
that somehow has managed to survive the
advent of text messaging and caller ID.
You might think most rational people
would believe I'm barking up the wrong tree
as far as critical issues facing everyday people
go, but, I think the fact we still even use voice
mail is sufficient evidence that most people
aren't rational. Lest you think I'm fighting a
ManßearPig of a problem, consider the fol
lowing. Suppose each American wastes two
minutes of productivity and/or American
Idol viewing time because of this inefficient
invention. That's 600 million minutes a day,
give or take, and, if nothing else, frankly Ford
probably wouldn't be performing so poorly if
all those minutes had been spent watching
Carrie Underwood and Clay Aiken traipse
around in a Focus. It doesn't take a hockey
stick graph on a PowerPoint and pictures of
polar bears crying to prove that voicemail is
lame.

Voicemail, like the DMV and Kesha, is
one part unavoidable and two parts obnox
ious. There probably was a time when it was
exciting to gather around and listen to the
recording of the last caller. But, obviously,
that day has passed. Only people who look
back fondly on the days of Furbies or Milli
Vanilli should find voicemail attractive, and,
even then, it's only because they are de
ranged nostalgic masochists.
That being said, I'm not sure if there even
is an audience that enjoys voicemail. The
people at Brach's that design those Valen
tine's candy hearts still include antiquated
messages like "Fax Me" and "Page Me" on
their candies. Somehow, they neglected to
design one that says "Leave Me a Voice
mail!" Reasonably, you might imagine that
the size of candy hearts prohibits a message
longer than 10 characters. Alternately, it's
because no one ever intends to leave a voice
mail; it's always the communication method
of second choice. There's no excitement to it.
A text or e-mail or even a fax can be how you
choose to contact someone; a voicemail is
what you're stuck with when calling doesn't
work as planned.
So voicemail is decidedly unromantic and
certainly impractical, yet in spite of competi
tion, survives on momentum. Paraphrasing
Marx, tongue firmly in cheek: phone owners
of the world, unite you have nothing to
lose but your phone tag chains.
