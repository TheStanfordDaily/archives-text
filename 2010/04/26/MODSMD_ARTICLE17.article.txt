## AXING ANTEATERS 
### CAROLINE CASELLI DESK EDITOR 
On Saturday, the No. 1 Stanford men's vol
leyball team won its first postseason match since
1997, taking down No. 7 UC-lrvine in an excit
ing four-set victory in the first round of the
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation (MPSF)
Tournament.

Playing in front of a spirited crowd of cos
tumed students from a fairy to a bowling pin
the Card (20-6,16-6 MPSF) came one step
closer to an MPSF Tournament title and auto
matic berth into the NCAA Tournament.
"It is nice to be home," added sophomore

libera Erik Shoji. "Our fans are awesome, and
we hope they continue to come out and sup
port."

"When you have R2-D2, Han Solo and
Princess Leia walking in at the same time fol
lowed by a hundred others in costume, we all get
some extra adrenaline going through our veins,"
said senior opposite Evan Romero. "It truly is a
home-court advantage when you have all of
them there for us."

Stanford took control of the match early,
jumping out to a 7-2 lead in the first set. Irvine
(15-15, 10-12) fought back, bringing the score
within two at 11-9, and eventually tying the set
at 22 apiece. But in the final stretch, Romero and

junior outside hitter Spencer McLachlin each
put down a pair of kills to win the set, 30-26.
The second set started much the same way,
with the Card taking a 6-2 lead, but Irvine quick
ly bounced back, tying the set 6-6. The game re
mained close throughout, with the score tied as
late as 28-28. But Stanford struggled toward the
end with shanked passes, serving errors and
mishit balls, and Irvine took the set, 30-28.

Stanford came out to another strong 7-2 start
in set three, and this time, the lead was never re
linquished. Strong hitting from sophomore out
side hitter Brad Lawson and Romero helped
the Card maintain a fairly steady five-point
cushion. A pair of smartly executed dumps from

senior setter Kawika Shoji extended Stanford's
lead to 26-19, and a McLachlin kill secured the
set victory at 30-25.
The fourth set started out evenly, but four
unanswered points from the Card brought the
score to 11-7. The Anteaters re-tied the score at
19-19 and again at 24-24, but Irvine errors com
bined with the Card's offense powered Stanford
ahead in the final stretch. A perfect serve-re
ceive pass from Romero, a set from Kawika
Shoji and a definitive kill from Lawson solidi
fied the set and match victory for Stanford, 30-
27.

Stanford's middle blockers, senior Garrett
Werner and sophomore Gus Ellis, had a major
presence at the net, garnering five points from
blocks in the fourth set alone.

"[The middles] were huge, especially in the
fourth set," Romero said. "Their blocking was a
key to our victory. It frustrated Irvine's hitters
while keeping momentum on our side."

Romero and Lawson led the Card on offense
with 24 and 21 kills, respectively. McLachlin
contributed an additional 15 kills, and all three
players hit over .300 for the night. Kawika Shoji
shined all around, with 59 assists, 12 digs, eight
kills and two aces. Erik Shoji led the defense
with 18 digs.
For Irvine, sophomore opposite Carson
Clark tallied 23 kills, while junior outside hitters
Jordan DuFault and Cory Yoder contributed 18
and 17 kills, respectively. Redshirt freshman
libero Will Montgomery led the match with 19
digs, and junior setter Jeff Schmitz set 42 assists.
