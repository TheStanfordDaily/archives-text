### KABIR SAWHNEY DESK EDITOR 
After going cold two weeks ago against Ari
zona, the Stanford Softball team continued to strug
gle against Pac-10 competition.The No. 10 Cardinal
(30-12, 4-8 Pac-10) could not keep up with No. 6
UCLA (33-9,7-5) and was swept at home for the
first time this season.
Stanford has now lost seven straight games and
has sunk to seventh out of eight teams in the con
ference, just ahead of Oregon State.
"This conference is tough it's very unforgiv
ing," said head coach John Rittman. "If you have a
bad weekend, you just have to be able to bounce
back."
The first game of the series on Friday saw the
Cardinal lose a game in five innings for the first
time this season. The Bruin offense relentlessly
pounded Stanford pitching, taking home a 10-0
win.
Without freshman Teagan Gerhart, who has car

contain UCLA's powerful offense. Junior Ashley
Chinn got the start, pitching 2.2 innings and giving
up four runs before being replaced by freshman
Caitlin Breen. In her 2.1 innings, Breen gave up 10
hits and six runs before the game was ended in five
innings due to the run rule.
Meanwhile, UCLA's Donna Kerr dominated
the Stanford lineup, pitching all five innings and
giving up only one hit, to senior left fielder Alissa
Haber. Kerr also registered eight strikeouts while
not issuing a walk. On the Stanford side, Chinn
gave up three walks before being removed.
Stanford fared slightly better in the next game
of the series. The Cardinal managed to keep the
game close early, with the score tied at three apiece
after three innings. However, the Bruins pulled
away in the next two innings, while Stanford was
unable to make a dent in UCLA's defense over the
last four. The game ended in a 7-3 UCLA win.
The Cardinal used two pitchers again in the
game Chinn and freshman Jenna Rich. After
earning the start. Rich stayed in for three innings,
giving up four runs. Chinn gave a similarly lacklus
ter performance, allowing three runs over the final
four innings.

Stanford's offense also found a few holes in
UCLA's pitching, though it was not enough to
match the Bruins' offensive output. UCLA starter
Whitney Baker gave up three runs in four innings
before being replaced by Megan Langenfeld, who
