## Bruins bash inconsistent pitching staff 
### KABIR SAWHNEY DESK EDITOR 
After going cold two weeks ago against Ari
zona, the Stanford Softball team continued to strug
gle against Pac-10 competition.The No. 10 Cardinal
(30-12, 4-8 Pac-10) could not keep up with No. 6
UCLA (33-9,7-5) and was swept at home for the
first time this season.
Stanford has now lost seven straight games and
has sunk to seventh out of eight teams in the con
ference, just ahead of Oregon State.
"This conference is tough it's very unforgiv
ing," said head coach John Rittman. "If you have a
bad weekend, you just have to be able to bounce
back."
The first game of the series on Friday saw the
Cardinal lose a game in five innings for the first
time this season. The Bruin offense relentlessly
pounded Stanford pitching, taking home a 10-0
win.
Without freshman Teagan Gerhart, who has car
ried much of the pitching load throughout the sea
son, the Stanford pitching staff was hard-pressed to
contain UCLA's powerful offense. Junior Ashley
Chinn got the start, pitching 2.2 innings and giving
up four runs before being replaced by freshman
Caitlin Breen. In her 2.1 innings, Breen gave up 10
hits and six runs before the game was ended in five
innings due to the run rule.
Meanwhile, UCLA's Donna Kerr dominated
the Stanford lineup, pitching all five innings and
giving up only one hit, to senior left fielder Alissa
Haber. Kerr also registered eight strikeouts while
not issuing a walk. On the Stanford side, Chinn
gave up three walks before being removed.
Stanford fared slightly better in the next game
of the series. The Cardinal managed to keep the
game close early, with the score tied at three apiece
after three innings. However, the Bruins pulled
away in the next two innings, while Stanford was
unable to make a dent in UCLA's defense over the
last four. The game ended in a 7-3 UCLA win.
The Cardinal used two pitchers again in the
game Chinn and freshman Jenna Rich. After
earning the start. Rich stayed in for three innings,
giving up four runs. Chinn gave a similarly lacklus
ter performance, allowing three runs over the final
four innings.

Stanford's offense also found a few holes in
UCLA's pitching, though it was not enough to
match the Bruins' offensive output. UCLA starter
Whitney Baker gave up three runs in four innings
before being replaced by Megan Langenfeld, who
held the Card to no runs over the
final three innings.
At the top of the order, Haber and
sophomore second baseman Ashley
Hansen combined to go 3-8 with two
runs scored, but the rest of the Cardi
nal lineup was an anemic 2-17.
Despite his team's struggles,
Rittman still saw some strong points
of play.
"We're getting runners in scoring
position, and we're putting pressure
on them, we're just not getting the
big hit to break open an inning," he
said. "We're making some decent
pitches, but at the same time, we're
walking too many people, and we're
giving up the long ball."
Although Saturday's results were
somewhat encouraging, the team
backslid on Sunday, getting run
ruled for the second time in three
games in a 10-1 loss.
Rich and Chinn pitched once
again for the Cardinal, and were
even more ineffective than on Satur
day. They combined to give up 10
runs, all earned, while walking seven
batters and striking out seven, of
which six came from Chinn.
On the other side, Kerr and Lan
genfeld continued their dominance
of Stanford's lineup. The Card only
managed a single run in the second
inning, despite getting seven hits in
the game.
Rittman certainly saw the Card's
inability to string hits together as a
big obstacle.
"We need to find away to get

timely hits," Rittman said. "If we can
do that, we'll find away to win."
After a Tuesday game at home
against San Jose State, the Cardinal
will try to improve its Pac-10 for
tunes at home against Arizona State
in a three-game series starting on

April 30.
However, Rittman is not looking

"We really have to take it one
game at a time right now," he said.
Tuesday's game will begin at 6
p.m. at Smith Family Stadium.

his team's recent woes.

Stanford has now lost seven straight games and
has sunk to seventh out of eight teams in the con
ference, just ahead of Oregon State.
"This conference is tough it's very unforgiv
ing," said head coach John Rittman. "If you have a
bad weekend, you just have to be able to bounce
back."
The first game of the series on Friday saw the
Cardinal lose a game in five innings for the first
time this season. The Bruin offense relentlessly
pounded Stanford pitching, taking home a 10-0
win.
Without freshman Teagan Gerhart, who has car
ried much of the pitching load throughout the sea
son, the Stanford pitching staff was hard-pressed to
contain UCLA's powerful offense. Junior Ashley
Chinn got the start, pitching 2.2 innings and giving
up four runs before being replaced by freshman
Caitlin Breen. In her 2.1 innings, Breen gave up 10
hits and six runs before the game was ended in five
innings due to the run rule.
Meanwhile, UCLA's Donna Kerr dominated
the Stanford lineup, pitching all five innings and
giving up only one hit, to senior left fielder Alissa
Haber. Kerr also registered eight strikeouts while
not issuing a walk. On the Stanford side, Chinn
gave up three walks before being removed.
Stanford fared slightly better in the next game
of the series. The Cardinal managed to keep the
game close early, with the score tied at three apiece
after three innings. However, the Bruins pulled
away in the next two innings, while Stanford was
unable to make a dent in UCLA's defense over the
last four. The game ended in a 7-3 UCLA win.
The Cardinal used two pitchers again in the
game Chinn and freshman Jenna Rich. After
earning the start. Rich stayed in for three innings,
giving up four runs. Chinn gave a similarly lacklus
ter performance, allowing three runs over the final
four innings.

Stanford's offense also found a few holes in
UCLA's pitching, though it was not enough to
match the Bruins' offensive output. UCLA starter
Whitney Baker gave up three runs in four innings
before being replaced by Megan Langenfeld, who
held the Card to no runs over the
final three innings.
At the top of the order, Haber and
sophomore second baseman Ashley
Hansen combined to go 3-8 with two
runs scored, but the rest of the Cardi
nal lineup was an anemic 2-17.
Despite his team's struggles,
Rittman still saw some strong points
of play.
"We're getting runners in scoring
position, and we're putting pressure
on them, we're just not getting the
big hit to break open an inning," he
said. "We're making some decent
pitches, but at the same time, we're
walking too many people, and we're
giving up the long ball."
Although Saturday's results were
somewhat encouraging, the team
backslid on Sunday, getting run
ruled for the second time in three
games in a 10-1 loss.
Rich and Chinn pitched once
again for the Cardinal, and were
even more ineffective than on Satur
day. They combined to give up 10
runs, all earned, while walking seven
batters and striking out seven, of
which six came from Chinn.
On the other side, Kerr and Lan
genfeld continued their dominance
of Stanford's lineup. The Card only
managed a single run in the second
inning, despite getting seven hits in
the game.
Rittman certainly saw the Card's
inability to string hits together as a
big obstacle.
"We need to find away to get

timely hits," Rittman said. "If we can
do that, we'll find away to win."
After a Tuesday game at home
against San Jose State, the Cardinal
will try to improve its Pac-10 for
tunes at home against Arizona State
in a three-game series starting on

April 30.
However, Rittman is not looking

"We really have to take it one
game at a time right now," he said.
Tuesday's game will begin at 6
p.m. at Smith Family Stadium.

too far into the future for a cure to
his team's recent woes.

Junior Ashley Chinn's pitching could not stop the No. 6 UCLA offense this
weekend, as the No. 10 Cardinal extended their losing streak to seven straight
games. The pitching staff has been shaky without freshman Teagan Gerhart.
