# Three draft picks show promise
## 
### Wyndam Makowsky Between the lines 
As Saturday's seventh
round came to a close, the
Cardinal's three 2010
draftees found them
selves not just in the Na
tional Football League, but also in good
situations therein.
Let's start, as always, with Toby Ger
hart. Minnesota was a bit of a surprise,
as most of the pre-draft talk centered
on a few places Denver, San Diego
and Philadelphia with the Vikings
rarely being a part of the conversation.
But they should have been, be
cause at first glance, they make quite a
bit of sense, Adrian Peterson is one of
the best running backs in the league,
but has a violent running style that
precludes him from carrying an entire
load. His value backup, Chester Tay
lor, left for the Chicago Bears this off
season, and the Vikings had to fill that
role.
Enter Gerhart, who instantly gives
Minnesota one of the most intimidat
ing rushing attacks in football. Take
out Peterson, and you have to deal
with another bruiser; fortunately for
Gerhart, Peterson is also enough of an
all-around speed threat that the holes
he will face will be just a tad bit wider.
Plus, the Vikings offensive line, though
at times maligned during the latter part
of last season, still features one of the
all-time best pulling guards in Steve
Hutchinson, two tackle bookends in
Bryant McKinnie and Phil Loadholt

and a young and developing center in
John Sullivan. They also added Chris
DeGeare, a well-regarded and versa
tile line prospect, in the fifth round of
the draft. So imagine: Gerhart will get
to face defenses broken down from
taking on Peterson, with a line that can
give him the room to operate.
Naysayers will point to Peterson's
status as indicative of a limited role for
Gerhart. But the NFL has, over the
past decade, evolved into a two-back
league few, if any teams feature just
one runner. Complementary backs
abound. Even the two running backs
taken in the top 12 picks will not be
asked to carry an individual load or,
frankly, even start. C.J. Spiller has Mar
shawn Lynch and Fred Jackson in Buf
falo; Ryan Mathews has Darren Spro
les in San Diego. Gerhart, Spiller and
Mathews all have tremendous impor
tance as secondary players, and that's
perfectly all right.
Additionally, the fullback question.

although nearly dead as is, can finally
be put to rest. The Vikings traded both
their second and third round picks in a
deep draft in order to move up the 11
spots to pick Gerhart. That type of in
vestment is not made in a lead blocker.
Head coach Brad Childress's press
conference was almost humorous
he was bombarded with questions
about whether or not Gerhart would
be a fullback, which he continuously
brushed off as narrow-minded and in
accurate. He even said that Gerhart
could be lined up outside as a receiver,
a statement indicative of the flexibility
the Vikings see in him.
Then there's Jim Dray, newly of the
Arizona Cardinals. Although taken in
the seventh round. Dray should get an
opportunity early to challenge for seri
ous playing time, as Arizona does not
have a featured tight end, and the qual
ity of its depth is precarious.
Outside of Dray, there are fourTEs
on the roster. Ben Patrick is a young
talent who has flashed promise and is
expected to be the starter. But Patrick
has suffered from injuries recently and,
even when healthy, has not entirely
capitalized on his opportunities his
production has been limited, as seen in

his career high of 12 receptions in a sea
son. Stephen Spach is apparently well
liked by the stall, but he is a bit older
and has bounced in and out of the
league with less than 100 career receiv
ing yards. Anthony Becht, a former
first-round pick, is in the twilight of his
career, and Dominique Byrd has
failed, repeatedly, to become a legiti
mate NFL player.
So Dray, who possesses not just ex
emplary blocking abilities, but soft
hands, too, finds himself in a place
where little is certain. Fie can compete
for playing time almost immediately.
The Cardinals, in turn, have themselves
a player who likely would have been
taken quite a bit earlier had injuries not
nagged him throughout his collegiate
career. Provided that he stays healthy,
he gives Arizona a talent boost at the
tight end position.
Finally, there is Erik Lorig, who
went to Tampa Bay as the draft wound
down. Lorig is still recovering from an
off-season surgery and is seen as more
of a developmental project. But even
then, the Buccaneers have an admit
ted, serious issue with their defensive
end depth, and head coach Raheem
Morris was quick to point Lorig out as
a guy who could see action on both the
right and left sides and earn playing
time on defense as a hustling reserve.
Outside of Stylez White starting at
RDE, the Buccaneers line is still unde
cided.
And so Gerhart, Dray and Lorig
will have their chances, even if the ex
pectations range from immediate con
tributor to long-term prospect. Some
draftees find themselves in situations
where they're buried on a depth chart,
with little chance for playing time or
even making a roster; for the three Car
dinal players, this is not the case.

Wyndam Makowsky is going through
an existential crisis now that he can no
longer write about Toby Gerhart. Get
