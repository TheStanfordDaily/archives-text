# Three draft picks show promise
## 
### Wyndam Makowsky Between the lines 
As Saturday's seventh
round came to a close, the
Cardinal's three 2010
draftees found them
selves not just in the Na
tional Football League, but also in good
situations therein.
Let's start, as always, with Toby Ger
hart. Minnesota was a bit of a surprise,
as most of the pre-draft talk centered
on a few places Denver, San Diego
and Philadelphia with the Vikings
rarely being a part of the conversation.
But they should have been, be
cause at first glance, they make quite a
bit of sense, Adrian Peterson is one of
the best running backs in the league,
but has a violent running style that
precludes him from carrying an entire
load. His value backup, Chester Tay
lor, left for the Chicago Bears this off
season, and the Vikings had to fill that
role.
Enter Gerhart, who instantly gives
Minnesota one of the most intimidat
ing rushing attacks in football. Take
out Peterson, and you have to deal
with another bruiser; fortunately for
Gerhart, Peterson is also enough of an
all-around speed threat that the holes
he will face will be just a tad bit wider.
Plus, the Vikings offensive line, though
at times maligned during the latter part
of last season, still features one of the
all-time best pulling guards in Steve
Hutchinson, two tackle bookends in
Bryant McKinnie and Phil Loadholt
