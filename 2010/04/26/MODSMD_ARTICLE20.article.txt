# Card wins offensive shootouts
## 
### KABIR SAWHNEY DESK EDITOR 
With ferocious competition at the top of the
conference standings, both No. 22 Stanford and
No. 15 California came into this weekend with
aspirations of moving up at the expense of a big
rival. Though both teams were relatively evenly
matched, Stanford (21-13, 10-5 Pac-10) swept
the series, taking three close wins from the Gold
en Bears (23-14,8-7).
"I felt that we had good clutch hitting," said
head coach Mark Marquess. "We got some big
hits with people on base, and I thought that made
a big difference ... We couldn't stop them very
much, but we had enough."
The hero of the weekend was undoubtedly
freshman third baseman Kenny Diekroeger. His
sacrifice fly in the ninth inning on Friday gave the
Card its first walk-off win of the series, and he de
livered again on Sunday afternoon with a ninth
inning single to drive home the winning run.

"For whatever reason, I've been in similar sit
uations several times this year," Diekroeger said.

"I'd say I was a little more cool and collected
than before. I've been there and done that, so
I've had that experience."
Friday's game saw each team's pitching staff
try to outduel the other before Diekroeger's sac
rifice fly gave the Cardinal a 3-2 win.
Sophomore pitcher Brett Mooneyham start
ed the game for Stanford. After a weak start to
the season, Mooneyham has pitched very well of
late, and he continued his strong efforts against
Cal's lineup. In Friday's game, he pitched 7.1 in
nings, allowing just two runs (one earned) to the
Bears. After struggling with his control early in
the season, Mooneyham seems to have returned
to form —he surrendered only three walks,
while striking out 10 batters.
Junior Alex Pracher, who came on in relief of
Mooneyham, also pitched well. In 1.2 innings, he
held the Bears to one hit, while striking out three.
He also earned the win for the game, improving
his record for the season to 6-2.

However, Cal starter Erik Johnson matched
Mooneyham's effort with an impressive per
formance of his own, giving up just two runs in

eight innings of work. The Bears' relievers, how
ever, proved unable to sustain Johnson's per
formance — in just one inning, reliever Matt
Flemer failed to stop Stanford from scoring the
winning run.
While the first game of the series turned into
a pitcher's duel, the final two games would not
follow the same pattern.
The second game of the series was a classic
offensive shootout, with both teams shredding
opposing pitching in a race to outgun the other.
The Cardinal was able to take the game, 15-12,
on the strength of junior second baseman Colin
Walsh's big day at the plate, which included five
RBIs and one home run.
Aside from Walsh, Stanford's offense was led
by two freshmen, right fielder Tyler Gaffney and
Diekroeger. Both players had two RBIs, and
Gaffney hit two doubles in the game.
While the Golden Bears did not have any
standout performers, they were led offensively
by first baseman Mark Canha and catcher Eddie

Junior first baseman Jonathan Kaskow slid into home plate in Sunday's 11-10 win against UC-Berkeley, helping the No. 22 Cardinal to their
series sweep against No. 15 Pac- 10 rival Cal. Kaskow and freshman designated hitter Justin Ringo each had two RBls in the series finale.
Hsieh, who each had two RBIs.
Though both teams were pulling
out all the stops offensively, their pitch
ing and defense left a lot to be desired.
The Cardinal used five pitchers, while
the Golden Bears used four.

Sophomore Jordan Pries, who
started the game for the Cardinal, was

uncharacteristically ineffective.
Though he has been Stanford's best
pitcher for most of the season, he
struggled against Cal, giving up four
runs in just 3.2 innings of work.
Errors were also a major factor,
with Cal committing four errors and
Stanford committing three.
The series' final game did not fail to
deliver the same kind of late-inning
drama and high-powered offense that
had come to characterize the week
end.
While Stanford jumped out to an

early lead with a big five-run rally in the
first inning, Cal clawed back, scoring in
the third, fourth, sixth, seventh and
eighth innings to take a 10-8 lead head
ing into the ninth. The Cardinal was
able to mount a three-run rally to win
the game in the bottom of the ninth to
take the game by a score of 11-10.
Gaffney and Diekroeger were crit
ical to that final inning Gaffney
started the rally with a deep double
that hit the center field wall, and
Diekroeger ended it by driving in the
game-winning run.

Other big offensive contributors in
cluded freshman designated hitter
Justin Ringo and junior first baseman
Jonathan Kaskow, who each had two
RBIs.

For Cal, the top of the lineup was ex
tremely productive, driving in eight of
the team's 10 runs. Its top three offen
sive players were Canha, catcher
Chadd Krist and shortstop Marcus
Semien.

Cal's defense was not nearly as
strong as its offense, however. For the
second game in a row, the Bears proved

to be porous, committing two critical er
rors.

The pitching staffs of each team
found themselves besieged again. Both
teams used four pitchers in the game.
While sophomore Brian Busick, the
Stanford starter, managed to last three
innings, Cal starter Dixon Anderson
was pulled from the game within just 0.2
innings pitched, after giving up five runs
to the Cardinal offense.

After this series, Stanford now
stands at second place in the Pac-10, just
one game behind No. 1 Arizona State.

"[The sweep] is huge because it puts
us two games ahead of Cal," Marquess
said. "They were one game ahead of us
before we started... We're one game
out of first place, so that's the real signif
icance of it."

Stanford's next game is a contest
today against Santa Clara. Play will start
at 6 p.m. at Santa Clara. The Cardinal's
next Pac-10 series is on the road against
Washington, and will start on Friday.

ing and defense left a lot to be desired.
The Cardinal used five pitchers, while
the Golden Bears used four.

Sophomore Jordan Pries, who
started the game for the Cardinal, was

uncharacteristically ineffective.
Though he has been Stanford's best
pitcher for most of the season, he
struggled against Cal, giving up four
runs in just 3.2 innings of work.
Errors were also a major factor,
with Cal committing four errors and
Stanford committing three.
The series' final game did not fail to
deliver the same kind of late-inning
drama and high-powered offense that
had come to characterize the week
end.
While Stanford jumped out to an

early lead with a big five-run rally in the
first inning, Cal clawed back, scoring in
the third, fourth, sixth, seventh and
eighth innings to take a 10-8 lead head
ing into the ninth. The Cardinal was
able to mount a three-run rally to win
the game in the bottom of the ninth to
take the game by a score of 11-10.
Gaffney and Diekroeger were crit
ical to that final inning Gaffney
started the rally with a deep double
that hit the center field wall, and
Diekroeger ended it by driving in the
game-winning run.

Other big offensive contributors in
cluded freshman designated hitter
Justin Ringo and junior first baseman
Jonathan Kaskow, who each had two
RBIs.

For Cal, the top of the lineup was ex
tremely productive, driving in eight of
the team's 10 runs. Its top three offen
sive players were Canha, catcher
Chadd Krist and shortstop Marcus
Semien.

Cal's defense was not nearly as
strong as its offense, however. For the
second game in a row, the Bears proved

to be porous, committing two critical er
rors.

The pitching staffs of each team
found themselves besieged again. Both
teams used four pitchers in the game.
While sophomore Brian Busick, the
Stanford starter, managed to last three
innings, Cal starter Dixon Anderson
was pulled from the game within just 0.2
innings pitched, after giving up five runs
to the Cardinal offense.

After this series, Stanford now
stands at second place in the Pac-10, just
one game behind No. 1 Arizona State.

"[The sweep] is huge because it puts
us two games ahead of Cal," Marquess
said. "They were one game ahead of us
before we started... We're one game
out of first place, so that's the real signif
icance of it."

Stanford's next game is a contest
today against Santa Clara. Play will start
at 6 p.m. at Santa Clara. The Cardinal's
next Pac-10 series is on the road against
Washington, and will start on Friday.

With ferocious competition at the top of the
conference standings, both No. 22 Stanford and
No. 15 California came into this weekend with
aspirations of moving up at the expense of a big
rival. Though both teams were relatively evenly
matched, Stanford (21-13, 10-5 Pac-10) swept
the series, taking three close wins from the Gold
en Bears (23-14,8-7).
"I felt that we had good clutch hitting," said
head coach Mark Marquess. "We got some big
hits with people on base, and I thought that made
a big difference ... We couldn't stop them very
much, but we had enough."
The hero of the weekend was undoubtedly
freshman third baseman Kenny Diekroeger. His
sacrifice fly in the ninth inning on Friday gave the
Card its first walk-off win of the series, and he de
livered again on Sunday afternoon with a ninth
inning single to drive home the winning run.

"For whatever reason, I've been in similar sit
uations several times this year," Diekroeger said.

"I'd say I was a little more cool and collected
than before. I've been there and done that, so
I've had that experience."
Friday's game saw each team's pitching staff
try to outduel the other before Diekroeger's sac
rifice fly gave the Cardinal a 3-2 win.
Sophomore pitcher Brett Mooneyham start
ed the game for Stanford. After a weak start to
the season, Mooneyham has pitched very well of
late, and he continued his strong efforts against
Cal's lineup. In Friday's game, he pitched 7.1 in
nings, allowing just two runs (one earned) to the
Bears. After struggling with his control early in
the season, Mooneyham seems to have returned
to form —he surrendered only three walks,
while striking out 10 batters.
Junior Alex Pracher, who came on in relief of
Mooneyham, also pitched well. In 1.2 innings, he
held the Bears to one hit, while striking out three.
He also earned the win for the game, improving
his record for the season to 6-2.

However, Cal starter Erik Johnson matched
Mooneyham's effort with an impressive per
formance of his own, giving up just two runs in

eight innings of work. The Bears' relievers, how
ever, proved unable to sustain Johnson's per
formance — in just one inning, reliever Matt
Flemer failed to stop Stanford from scoring the
winning run.
While the first game of the series turned into
a pitcher's duel, the final two games would not
follow the same pattern.
The second game of the series was a classic
offensive shootout, with both teams shredding
opposing pitching in a race to outgun the other.
The Cardinal was able to take the game, 15-12,
on the strength of junior second baseman Colin
Walsh's big day at the plate, which included five
RBIs and one home run.
Aside from Walsh, Stanford's offense was led
by two freshmen, right fielder Tyler Gaffney and
Diekroeger. Both players had two RBIs, and
Gaffney hit two doubles in the game.
While the Golden Bears did not have any
standout performers, they were led offensively
by first baseman Mark Canha and catcher Eddie

BRYAN LIN/The Stanford Daily
Junior first baseman Jonathan Kaskow slid into home plate in Sunday's 11-10 win against UC-Berkeley, helping the No. 22 Cardinal to their
series sweep against No. 15 Pac- 10 rival Cal. Kaskow and freshman designated hitter Justin Ringo each had two RBls in the series finale.
Hsieh, who each had two RBIs.
Though both teams were pulling
out all the stops offensively, their pitch
ing and defense left a lot to be desired.
The Cardinal used five pitchers, while
the Golden Bears used four.

Sophomore Jordan Pries, who
started the game for the Cardinal, was

uncharacteristically ineffective.
Though he has been Stanford's best
pitcher for most of the season, he
struggled against Cal, giving up four
runs in just 3.2 innings of work.
Errors were also a major factor,
with Cal committing four errors and
Stanford committing three.
The series' final game did not fail to
deliver the same kind of late-inning
drama and high-powered offense that
had come to characterize the week
end.
While Stanford jumped out to an

early lead with a big five-run rally in the
first inning, Cal clawed back, scoring in
the third, fourth, sixth, seventh and
eighth innings to take a 10-8 lead head
ing into the ninth. The Cardinal was
able to mount a three-run rally to win
the game in the bottom of the ninth to
take the game by a score of 11-10.
Gaffney and Diekroeger were crit
ical to that final inning Gaffney
started the rally with a deep double
that hit the center field wall, and
Diekroeger ended it by driving in the
game-winning run.

Other big offensive contributors in
cluded freshman designated hitter
Justin Ringo and junior first baseman
Jonathan Kaskow, who each had two
RBIs.

For Cal, the top of the lineup was ex
tremely productive, driving in eight of
the team's 10 runs. Its top three offen
sive players were Canha, catcher
Chadd Krist and shortstop Marcus
Semien.

Cal's defense was not nearly as
strong as its offense, however. For the
second game in a row, the Bears proved

to be porous, committing two critical er
rors.

The pitching staffs of each team
found themselves besieged again. Both
teams used four pitchers in the game.
While sophomore Brian Busick, the
Stanford starter, managed to last three
innings, Cal starter Dixon Anderson
was pulled from the game within just 0.2
innings pitched, after giving up five runs
to the Cardinal offense.

After this series, Stanford now
stands at second place in the Pac-10, just
one game behind No. 1 Arizona State.

"[The sweep] is huge because it puts
us two games ahead of Cal," Marquess
said. "They were one game ahead of us
before we started... We're one game
out of first place, so that's the real signif
icance of it."

Stanford's next game is a contest
today against Santa Clara. Play will start
at 6 p.m. at Santa Clara. The Cardinal's
next Pac-10 series is on the road against
Washington, and will start on Friday.
