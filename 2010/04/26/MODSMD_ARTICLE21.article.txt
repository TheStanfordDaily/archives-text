# Hard-fought fourth
## 
### LAUREN TAYLOR STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford women's gymnas
tics team delivered its highest-scor
ing performance of the season to fin
ish fourth at the NCAA Super Six fi
nals at Florida's O'Connell Center
on Friday. With a 197.100, the Card
finished behind No. 1 UCLA
(197.725), Oklahoma (197.250) and
Alabama (197.225), edging out Flori
da (197.000) and Utah (196.225). The
Stanford team was able to overcome
rough patches to secure a position
that was only one spot from the pro
gram's best-ever finish.
The Card suffered a balance
beam fall on the opening routine of
the meet, but managed to rebound
with some near-perfect scores, in
cluding a 9.95 on uneven bars from
senior co-captain Carly Janiga. One
judge awarded her routine a perfect
10.0.
"We might be in a sticky situa

tion, but we have each other's backs,
and we know that," Janiga told
GoStanford.com. "If someone goes
down, you can't get down on your
self, because you know the next per
son is going to be there to rock it."
Senior and co-captain Allyse
Ishino competed in Thursday's team
preliminaries through her sickness
and proved to be a key contributor
on Friday. The team was under sig
nificant pressure to hit every routine
in the opening series, but Ishino fol
lowed with a clutch 9.8 to keep Stan
ford going.
Likewise, on the floor, the Cardi
nal was nearly forced to count a 9.70,
but senior Tenaya West closed it out
with a 9.85 to add to the team score
of 49.325 on the event. The Cardinal
then scored 49.400 on the vault, its
best score on any event.
"This is one team that doesn't
like to do things the easy way," Jani
ga said. "We'll make it hard on our
selves, but that just shows how tough

we are."
Stanford finished third in the
NCAA Finals in 2004 and 2008, but
there were several points in this sea
son when head coach Kristen Smyth
wondered if her team could come
close to those previous squads' suc
cess.
"The team has grown so much
since the start of the year," Smyth
said. "Every weekend, they started
to believe more and more that they
were capable of doing great things."
In fact, the five-member senior
class, which includes Janiga, Ishino,
West, Blair Ryland and Stephanie
Carter, reached the Super Six three
times, more than any other class at
Stanford. At the end of the day on
Friday, the seniors gathered togeth
er in a tearful embrace.
"We were reflecting on the past
four years together, and how we've
led the team this year," Janiga said.
"Not just us, but everybody on the
team really stepped up throughout
the year. I was just kind of relishing
the moment and soaking it in."
But Janiga's season was not over
on Friday, as she capped off her col
legiate gymnastics career with a na
tional championship on Saturday,
becoming the second individual
champion in Stanford school histo
ry. She scored a 9.9375 to win the un
even bars and a 9.8875 to tie for sec
ond on the balance beam, producing
the highest score a Stanford gym
nast has ever received in the Individ
ual Event Finals.
"Tonight, Carly was what she has
been for our team for the past four
years: amazing, and an absolute rock
for our program," Smyth said. "She
is going to be impossible to replace,
and it has been such a privilege to
work with someone with her work
ethic and character."
Janiga finished her career with
nine All-America honors, tying vol
unteer assistant coach Lindsay Wing
as the third-most decorated gym
nast ever at Stanford. Her five first
team All-American honors, includ
ing three this year, tie her with Wing
and Natalie Foley as the second
highest in that category in Cardinal
history. Janiga was joined in the Indi
vidual Finals by fellow senior Ry
land, who placed ninth on the vault
with a 9.7625.
With the fourth-place finish,
Stanford's season is now over.
As Smyth said of her senior gym
nasts in their final meet, "they get to
go out with such pride, knowing that
they took this program where it had
never been before,"
