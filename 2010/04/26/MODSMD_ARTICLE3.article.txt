# STUDENT LIFE
## Students promote fundraising Philanthropy Week becomes new campus tradition 
### MARIANNE LeVINE 
Last week marked the beginning of
Stanford's first Philanthropy Week.
Beginning Monday, April 19, students
received e-mails from classmates in
their respective years, describing a new
tradition at Stanford.
Philanthropy Week focused on do
nations to The Stanford Fund (TSF),
which helps finance scholarships, aca
demic programs and student groups on
campus. Each day was defined by a
theme, varying from scholarships to
athletic programming. The week cul
minated with students filming thank
you responses in White Plaza at the
spring Activities Fair.
To mark the debut of Philanthropy
Week, Vice Provost for Undergradu
ate Education John Bravman, in a
video message, described the life
changing bond he formed with a facul
ty member while at Stanford. Fie said
in his video message that "without our
donors and what they've done on a
regular basis," students would not be
able to avail themselves of "freshman
seminars, sophomore seminars, over
seas campuses, undergraduate re
search programs, you name it."
"We would not be doing it," Brav
man said. "It's as simple as that."
Despite Philanthropy Week's de
sire to highlight the generosity of
donors, however, numerous students
were unaware of its existence or its
purpose.
"I only heard about it through what
I must admit were rather non-descrip
tive e-mails, which I just passed over,"
said Jason Bade 'l3.
The e-mails sent throughout the
week also featured video clips of stu
dents describing the impact of TSF on
their undergraduate experience.
Sophomore Class President Adrian
Castillo 'l2 said a goal of the week was
to help raise awareness of how de
pendent students are on funding. He
added that he expects Philanthropy
Week to be an annual tradition be
cause the class presidents have a
strong relationship with TSF and are
seeking to promote awareness of the
organization.
