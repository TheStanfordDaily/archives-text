# STUDENT LIFE
## Students promote fundraising Philanthropy Week becomes new campus tradition 
### MARIANNE LeVINE 
Last week marked the beginning of
Stanford's first Philanthropy Week.
Beginning Monday, April 19, students
received e-mails from classmates in
their respective years, describing a new
tradition at Stanford.
Philanthropy Week focused on do
nations to The Stanford Fund (TSF),
which helps finance scholarships, aca
demic programs and student groups on
campus. Each day was defined by a
theme, varying from scholarships to
athletic programming. The week cul
minated with students filming thank
you responses in White Plaza at the
spring Activities Fair.
To mark the debut of Philanthropy
Week, Vice Provost for Undergradu
ate Education John Bravman, in a
video message, described the life
changing bond he formed with a facul
ty member while at Stanford. Fie said
in his video message that "without our
donors and what they've done on a
regular basis," students would not be
able to avail themselves of "freshman
seminars, sophomore seminars, over
seas campuses, undergraduate re
search programs, you name it."
"We would not be doing it," Brav
man said. "It's as simple as that."
Despite Philanthropy Week's de
sire to highlight the generosity of
donors, however, numerous students
were unaware of its existence or its
purpose.
"I only heard about it through what
I must admit were rather non-descrip
tive e-mails, which I just passed over,"
said Jason Bade 'l3.
The e-mails sent throughout the
week also featured video clips of stu
dents describing the impact of TSF on
their undergraduate experience.
Sophomore Class President Adrian
Castillo 'l2 said a goal of the week was
to help raise awareness of how de
pendent students are on funding. He
added that he expects Philanthropy
Week to be an annual tradition be
cause the class presidents have a
strong relationship with TSF and are
seeking to promote awareness of the
organization.
In his video, Kyle Tsai 'll said, "I
have not made too many life deci
sions, but my coming to Stanford
has definitely been one of them .. .
the scholarship fund is definitely
the reason why I can make that de
cision, so I am forever grateful."
Tristan Kruth 'l2, a member of
Robber Barons, said in his video
that TSF has supported the comedy
group's ability to write, act and pro
duce. It has enabled the Robber
Barons to travel to various areas of
the country, as well.

When groups of students were
asked about their thoughts on Phil

anthropy Week, the most common
response was: "Is that what those e
mails were about?"
Linden Moot 'l2 said that tar
geting students other than mem
bers of the senior class "seemed
pointless."
"Becoming an alum is way too
far away to think about," he said.
"After the first [e-mail], I didn't
even read them, I just deleted
them," Moot added. "I thought I al
ready knew everything they were
talking about."
Moot further said that he was
eventually encouraged to become a
donor through his work at the Call
ing Center. He said that while Brav
man's message was inspiring, the
student e-mails were ineffective.
"If they had all been sent by
Bravman, I would have read them

all," he said, "but when it comes
from our class officers, I assume
that it's fake and unnecessary."
Castillo, by contrast, hopes that
the potential influence of Philan
thropy Week will extend through
out the year. He added that many
parts of Philanthropy Week "were
very successful" and expressed
hope that the weeklong events will
demonstrate "how important fund
ing is to our Stanford experience."
According to the TSF website,
approximately 30,000 donors con
tributed $lB million to the Univer
sity last year.
