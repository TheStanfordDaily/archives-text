# Admit Weekend gets mixed reviews
## 1,350 ProFros explore campus programs 
### ERIN INMAN 
Despite initial concerns regarding the larger
than expected number of ProFros (prospective
freshmen) on campus for Admit Weekend, those
involved with the event generally gave positive
feedback.
With more ProFros than expected, Roble Head
HoHo (house host) Stephen Trusheim 'l3 said that
despite having to "change all of our plans," he had
"just as much as fun as the ProFros did."
After originally working through "layers of red
tape" to get a Lake Lag BBQ approved, Trusheim
and other HoHos had to find alternative means of
entertainment for the ProFros. Trusheim initiated
dance parties while fountain hopping at night.
"I got plenty of strange looks from parents
when all of our HoHos walked around dancing to
'Party in the USA' as we led their kids around,"
Trusheim said.
Working alongside HoHos, RoHos (room
hosts) acted as additional resources for their
prospective freshmen. Seeing Admit Weekend as a
chance to "return the favor" for her own welcome
experience, RoHo Helena Villalobos 'l3 said that
she really wanted to show her Pro Fro a good time.
So, what were the ProFros thinking?
"I came to Stanford with high expectations, and
my weekend exceeded those expectations," said
Pro Fro Louise Lu. "I found that there's nothing I
don't love about Stanford. I can't wait to come
next fall!"
However, some of the weekend's programming
received mixed reviews, including the University
organized Academic Expos that aimed to give
ProFros a taste of Stanford's academic life.
Pro Fro Jenee Smith said psychiatry and behav
ioral sciences Prof. William Dement's Academic
Expo on sleep "was incredible, since he was such a
unique blend of an engaging and serious" lecturer.
And, after sitting in on Human Behavioral Biolo
gy (810 150), Smith said that the class "seemed
like a real taste of Stanford [and] not just a part of
Admit Weekend fun."
Trusheim, on the other hand, observed an "arti
ficially dead" feeling on campus. He said that this
sentiment might have been caused by the inability
of the Academic Expos to provide a genuine class
room experience and a general lack of group stu
dent involvement.
"I would like to see the University reach out to
all the student groups here on campus and have
them host events that really showcase Stanford's
unique life,instead of just explaining it,"Trusheim

HoHos were forced to make last
minute adjustments, and ProFros
enjoyed the typical barbeques,
classes and expos throughout the
three-day event, while causing traffic
jams throughout campus.

said.
Elena Higuchi 'l3, another Roble
HoHo, said that authenticity was a
major complaint, as many ProFros
felt that Admit Weekend was not
"an accurate portrayal of life at
Stanford."
"And to be quite honest, it really
wasn't," she added.
"They were disappointed that
this was a dry weekend and [that]
they didn't get to see what real Stan
ford students would actually be

doing on a typical weekend,"
Fliguchi said.
In an e-mail to The Daily, Julie
Lythcott-Haims 'B9, dean of fresh
men and undergraduate advising,
acknowledged the challenge of con
densing a "world class institution
into an extended two-day tour."
"Still, we try to put some key ele
ments of an undergraduate educa
tion before them and hope that they
experience enough of what we offer
so as to come away with a good sense
of the place," Lythcott-Haims said.
While Trusheim observed that
many ProFros wanted him to "sell
Stanford to them," he instead tried
to get them to "figure out what they
were really looking for in a school."

"Having meaningful conversa
tions about my ProFros' dreams and
aspirations and giving an honest im
pression of Stanford 'sold' more
ProFros than I could have other
wise," Trusheim said.
Lythcott-Haims also emphasized
the wider picture in the questions
she posed to students still undecided
about which college to attend.
"Is it a school they would just be
proud to have a degree from? Or is
it a school where they'll feel a true
sense of belonging for four years
and also be proud to have that de
gree?"
