## Quiz Bowl team wins national title 
### ELLEN HUET DESK EDITOR 
"Proving the namesake property in one of these
data structures relies on the Dynamic Finger Conjec
ture, and data structures without their characteristic
property can obtain it by running an algorithm
named for Day, Stout and Warren. In one of these
data structures, their characteristic property is main
tained through operations like a zig-zag during
searches."
Around this point in the moderator's statement, a
buzzer sounded. The University of Minnesota Quiz
Bowl team, playing in the final round of Academic
Competition Federation (ACF) Quiz Bowl Nationals
against Stanford's team, gave an answer: "tree." When
prompted for more, the team incorrectly answered
"B-tree" instead of the correct "self-balanced binary
search tree" a mistake that wasn't noted by the
moderator at the time, but would later cost the Min
nesota team their finals title and give Stanford's team
its first ever national championship in ACF format.
For the four-person team, a championship title in
last weekend's national tournament is the cap on sev
eral years of hard work. The tournament, hosted by
the University of Maryland on April 17 and 18, was
the fourth in a row for team member Arnav Moudgil
'lO, a photo editor for The Daily.
"It feels great to finally win," Moudgil said, who
further noted that the team "got absolutely de
stroyed" during his first year at nationals in 2007. In
2008, the team placed sixth; in 2009, third.
After an early Stanford lead, the University of


ELLEN HUET/The Stanford Daily
Stanford's four-person Quiz Bowl team competed in the national competition last weekend in
Maryland and brought its first ever national championship trophy back to The Farm.
Minnesota team began to catch up
and eventually passed the Cardinal's
score. At the end of the game, Min
nesota stood ahead, but Stanford
protested an earlier answer the
question regarding self-balanced bi
nary search trees and the question
was ruled in Stanford's favor, giving it
its national title.
"It's not the nicest way of win
ning," said Kristiaan de Greve, anoth
er member of the team and a fifth
year doctoral student in electrical en
gineering. "The other team knew their
answer was incorrect, but they were
hoping it would be allowed."
The team acknowledged that their
most skilled player is Andrew Yaphe,
a third-year law student who is widely
recognized as the best player in the
history of collegiate quiz bowl, having
been the leading scorer on eight
championship national teams.
"He literally got 70 or 80 percent of
our winning points at nationals," said
Brian Lindquist, the fourth team
member and fifth-year doctoral stu
dent in physics. "But he also wouldn't
have won without us."
The tournament was demanding,
with an extensive round-robin day on
Saturday and a bracketed setup for
the finals on Sunday. The team, how
ever, is used to competition. All of the
members have played at least five
years, most having started in high
school. With three graduate students
and one undergraduate senior, the
team was a bit of an exception to most

teams which have fewer graduate stu
dents. University of Minnesota, the
team's final opponent, was all under
graduates.
"We might have been the oldest
team there," Moudgil said.
The team tossed around quiz bowl
lingo in describing their preparation
for the competition.
"I'd say about half of the questions
I got right was 'fraudulent' knowl
edge," Lindquist said, referring to
knowledge acquired specifically for
quiz bowl, as opposed to information
the players already knew from their
general knowledge.
De Greve also distinguished be
tween ACF format and the other
main format, National Academic
Quiz Tournaments (NAQT), which is
not timed and contains more popular
culture subjects in questions, whereas
ACF is "purely academic," De Greve
said.
"ACF has no 'trash' questions at
all," he said, referring to non-academ
ic questions found in NAQT competi
tion.
Although the team's win was an
appreciated victory, the members em
phasized that they play mostly for the
joy of the game and the intellectual
challenge.
"It exposes you to a lot of new
things that you might not otherwise
learn about," Moudgil said. "I'm a bi
ology major, I'm not gonna otherwise
get that much exposure to, say, philos
ophy."

"I like competing," Lindquist said.
"This is something that I can actually
do well at, unlike sports."
