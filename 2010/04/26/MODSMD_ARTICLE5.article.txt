"Proving the namesake property in one of these
data structures relies on the Dynamic Finger Conjec

buzzer sounded. The University of Minnesota Quiz
Bowl team, playing in the final round of Academic
Competition Federation (ACF) Quiz Bowl Nationals
against Stanford's team, gave an answer: "tree." When
prompted for more, the team incorrectly answered
"B-tree" instead of the correct "self-balanced binary
search tree" a mistake that wasn't noted by the
moderator at the time, but would later cost the Min
nesota team their finals title and give Stanford's team
its first ever national championship in ACF format.
For the four-person team, a championship title in
last weekend's national tournament is the cap on sev

the University of Maryland on April 17 and 18, was
the fourth in a row for team member Arnav Moudgil

"It feels great to finally win," Moudgil said, who
further noted that the team "got absolutely de
stroyed" during his first year at nationals in 2007. In
2008, the team placed sixth; in 2009, third.
