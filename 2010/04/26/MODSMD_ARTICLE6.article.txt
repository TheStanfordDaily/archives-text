and a black sweater.
The Granada staff immediately no
tified residents about the intrusion and
called the police, who were on site with
in two minutes, said Resident Assistant
Rachel Dowling TO.The RF later alert
ed residence staff across campus about
the incident.
"The police were truly wonderful
and very assuring," Dowling said.
"They took every precaution possible
and collected finger prints, as well as
swept the area for any signs of the per
petrators."
In an e-mail to The Daily, Stanford
Police Chief Laura Wilson said, "In this
case, we felt that the student population
had been notified through informal, yet
potentially effective channels, so the
decision was made not to utilize the
AlertSU system to notify the commu-
nity about this crime."
The incident, however, was not the
first peeping torn disturbance on cam
pus this academic year. Responding to
these developments, West Lag will in
stall a key system for the women's and
men's showers. Although locks are al
ready in place, they have not been uti
lized in the past. Student Housing is set
to re-key the showers to prevent fur
ther disturbances from occurring.
"In addition to the shower locks, we
asked Housing to add locks to the sec
ond floor breezeway between Eu
calipto and Granada, which might
have been a security weak-point in the
past," Dowling said.
"We are urging all residents not to
let strangers into the dorm by follow
ing them in, and to ask strangers who
they are visiting if they see someone
unusual in the halls," she added.
