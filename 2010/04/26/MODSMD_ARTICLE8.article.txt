## Prize Citizen 
### ERIKAALVERO KOSKI 
The 1960s were a time of tempestu
ous turmoil and stormy conflict, of
racial tensions and assassinations,
of sit-ins and war protests. It was
this era of revolution that sparked
the fires of civil rights movements all across
the United States, flaring the rightful anger
against discrimination and inequality that still
pervaded the country.
It also provided the backdrop for Stanford
sociology Professor Doug McAdam to inves
tigate social movements and ultimately re
ceive the 2010 Tisch Civil Engagement Prize.
"We awarded [McAdam] the Prize be
cause of three areas in his lifetime work: un
derstanding the effects of participating in a
social movement on individuals, the success
or failure of a social movement and race in
America," said Peter Levine, director of the
Tisch College of Citizenship and Public Ser
vice, a branch of Tufts University similar to
the HAAS Center at Stanford.
This award has been bestowed a total of
three times in the course of the College's ex
istence. The first recipient was Robert Wuth
now, a Princeton sociologist who studied self
help groups in modern society. The second re
cipient was Elinor Ostrom, an expert in how
small groups can cooperate harmoniously for
the greater public good, and especially in how
they can benefit the environment.
"It's given as a lifetime achievement
award and for active citizenship," Levine
added.
McAdam has devoted his life to citizen
ship either by participating in social move
ments himself in the early 1970s to trekking
across the country to get an on-the-ground
look at different social movements.
"I had been politically active in the anti
war movement when I was in college," re
membered McAdam, "and I decided to study
social movements, which had always interest
ed me, because of my own background."
The Tisch College of Citizenship and Pub
lic Service was particularly impressed by
McAdam's work on the civil rights project
called Freedom Summer, which culminated
in a "brilliant" book called "Freedom Sum
mer."
"In Freedom Summer, 1,000 primarily
white college students were recruited to go, in
the summer of 1964, to Mississippi to register
black voters," McAdam said. "That's why I
picked it as the starting point of the project,
where I was interested in the links between
movements. I wondered how many of them
had been radicalized or trained in the civil
rights movement that summer and then went
on to play pioneering roles in other move
ments."

McAdam went on a quest to examine the
backgrounds of these recruits. While there
was no actual list of the students, by a stroke

of luck, he unearthed the original applications
of the volunteers, both the participants and
the non-participants, at the Martin Luther
King, Jr. Center in Atlanta, Ga.
"Suddenly, I had this natural experiment
dropped in my lap, there were these two
groups that looked very similar," McAdam
said. "On the eve of the summer, one goes to
Mississippi, the other doesn't, what difference
did that choice make in their lives? The sim
ple answer is it totally changed the biogra

phies of the two groups."
After a year and a half of searching
through alumni associations and phone
books, driving around the country, surveying
the application owners and interviewing a
randomly-picked 40 individuals, McAdam
had gathered enough material to draw con
clusions from the study.
"We always say that in the '6os, there were
all these different movements, but they
weren't all different," he said. "There was one

large activist community, with its roots
squarely in the civil rights struggle, and then
individuals coming out of the civil rights
movement were addressing other issues like
Vietnam, women's rights, the environment, so
one of the really strong implications was that
movements are not discrete."
The students of Freedom Summer were
from very privileged backgrounds. The
largest groups of volunteers attended Stan
ford, Berkeley, Harvard, MIT and Princeton,
and were all from upper class and upper-mid
dle class families. This was the design of
SNCC (Student Nonviolent Coordinating
Committee) in founding Freedom Summer.
They realized that they needed publicity in
order to promote their cause, as they were
barred from progress both by the hostile
white surrounding communities as well as the
general oblivion in the United States of the
horrific nature of the racism in Mississippi: six
or seven SNCC volunteers had already been
killed.

"They reasoned that if they brought the
sons and daughters of the white privileged to
Mississippi, the media would follow,"
McAdam said. " And that would then make
the rest of the country aware of how bad it
was."
Another goal of Freedom Summer was to
burst the sheltered, naive bubbles of idealiza
tion in which the northern students resided.
The students were mainly mobilized for reli
gious reasons, education purposes and partic
ipation in Young Democrat groups. The hos
tility they encountered on their expedition
shocked them into action, making them the
forerunners of the social movements of the
19605, in contrast to the fairly inactive appli
cants who were accepted and yet declined to
attend Freedom Summer.
"Doug McAdam's work should make us
think of social services, and why they are
good," Levine observed. "We are trying to un
derstand that so we can change the world."
