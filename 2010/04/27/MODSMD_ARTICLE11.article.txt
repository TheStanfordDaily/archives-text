### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€” An Le Nguyen 
In response to industry demands,
Stanford recently announced the ad
dition of a graduate certificate pro
gram for aerospace engineers.
The newly minted Advanced
Structures and Failure Analysis pro
gram will provide online courses to
engineers, who may enroll in the pro

gram independently or receive em
ployer sponsorship.
This new professional develop
ment opportunity aims to meet a de
mand by the aerospace industry. Dil
shani Jayasundara, a fuselage stress
analysis engineer at Boeing, first pro
posed the idea to Stanford.
The program is offered through
the University's Department of
Aeronautics and Astronautics and
the Stanford Center for Professional
