## EDITORIAL Upcoming California elections impact entire Stanford community 
### 
The Stanford community stays consis
tently engaged in national political is
sues. Almost every day, conversations
break out in dining halls, on email lists and in
classes exploring current events and debat
ing national issues. Members of the Stanford
community come from all over the United
States and the globe, and many remain well
informed on the issues facing the various
places that they call home. Yet as California
approaches the primaries this June and
elections in November many members of
the Stanford community may find the cam
pus suspiciously quiet on the issues and can
didates of this election.
The Editorial Board understands that
many members of the Stanford community
will not be voting in California come election
day this year. But we implore every member
of the Stanford community to stay aware of
the challenges facing California in the com
ing years. Even though many students may
only be here for a brief time, they will forev
er be members of the Stanford community.
Stanford's future is inextricably linked to the
future of California, and this is an important
year for the state of California.
Many of you are aware of the financial
turmoil that California is currently engulfed
in, and reducing the state's deficit will be one

of the most significant challenges that Cali
fornia has ever faced. There are many impor
tant projects that could end up casualties in
the battle to balance the California budget.
Altogether, the decisions of the coming elec
tion could have long-term repercussions for
the state. California has been a global leader
in the movement for sustainability, and it will
be difficult in light of the financial crisis that
the state is in to continue this progress.
There are very important ballot initiatives
this fall in California, most importantly a ref
erendum to delay Assembly Bill 32, and thus
delay California's committed action against
climate change. While large corporations
such as Valero use out-of-state resources to
create policies in California that will halt the
state's progress towards sustainability, Stan
ford students can be "out-of-state" resources
for California as well. By being engaged and
helping to spread the word on these issues,
we can call help the state of California a great
deal without even voting.
For those students who will be living in
California for longer and plan to vote in this
election, the gubernatorial election is sure to
be one of the most important in California's
history. We know that the Stanford commu
nity will stay informed and help this state to
recover and continue to push forward.
