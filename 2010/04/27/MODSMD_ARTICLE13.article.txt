# BROADLY SPEAKING
## The
						Psychology of Sections 
### Molly Spaeth 
So I had this really nice, gooey column
planned out where I was going to talk
about relationships and class govern
ment and how they intersect and interact at
Stanford as the Class of 2011 enters into our
senior year, but then I stopped.
I stumbled onto something better: This
week, ladies and gentleman, we're talking
about SECTIONS.

You know exactly what I'm talking about
those 50 dreaded minutes of each week
when you have to go from highly competent
G-chatter in lecture to highly insightful criti
cal thinker in a group of 10 other people you
don't know. Section requires you to take
highly opinionated, firm stances on whether
or not a theory some guy created in the 50s is
an accurate indicator of what happened in
the 1994 midterm elections and the Republi
can "Contract with America."

But in all (relative) seriousness, I wanted
to take this time to actually analyze the psy
chology of sections. And although my back
ground in psychology consists primarily of
the countless hours I've logged discussing
what "see you later" means in a text message,
I have also spent countless hours in section.
In sum, I may not have the expertise, but I
definitely have the experience.
Although there are a myriad of different
personality types that constitute the section
dynamic, I'm going to run through my fa
vorite five. The first is That Guy, that guy
whose greatest gift is his ability to somehow
tie every facet of the reading for this week to
some facet of his resume. Due to the sheer
volume of his comments and blatant desire to
blow everyone else's participation out of the
water, it doesn't really matter if That Guy's
comments are worthy of a Nobel Peace Prize
or if they couldn't pass a 6th-grade standard
ized test, everyone in section hates That Guy.
Then there's the Silent One, the antithesis
of That Guy. The Silent One spends the entire
section cultivating, analyzing and sweating
over that one comment she will contribute to
discussion. The Silent One turns bright red
whenever too many people look at her, and
has nightmares about being cold-called by
the professor in lecture. The Silent One
dreads section almost as much as That Guy
dreads not having enough copies of his re
sume to hand out at the Career Fair.
Then there's the Silent-But-Brilliant. Un
like the Silent One, the Silent-But-Brilliant is
silent not out of fear, but out of sheer cool
ness.The Silent-But-Brilliant has this incred
ible gift of spending the first 25 minutes of
section scrolling through pictures on failblog,
pausing for a few seconds to make the most
substantive, insightful comment in all of sec
tion, then spending the last 24 minutes and 30
seconds posting on cool pop culture blogs
with fellow Silent-But-Brilliant people. Un-

fortunately, the earth-shattering insight ex
hibited by Silent-But-Brilliant is often al
most immediately drowned out by That Guy,
to his right, rambling on about how his fi
nance internship last fall in Abu Dhabi
helped him to really understand what Pat
Buchanan meant about the 1994 midterm
elections (notice how a finance internship in
Abu Dhabi and Pat Buchanan have very lit
tle to do with each other? Case in point).
Then there is of course, Food Girl: the girl
who somehow thinks it's appropriate to eat
food loudly, messily and generally with utter
disregard for her peers. Her food of choice
usually involves some sort of pungent smell,
although this smell can range anywhere from
garlic cream cheese to the Southwest Chick
en Salad from Tresidder.

And then there is of course, The Silence-
Killer. The Silence-Killer, although
nowhere near the most brilliant or insightful
person in the room, feels a fundamental re
sponsibility to kill any prolonged, awkward
silence in discussion. The Silence-Killer is
the one that everyone, TAs and fellow stu
dents alike, fundamentally rely on for sim
ply saying something. The Silence-Killer is
the one you can depend on to somehow
fumble up a response to some highly meta
physical question the TA just asked that has
even That Guy stumbling for words. The Si
lence-Killer would rather be known as the
section idiot than sit through another sec
ond of unbearable silence as That Guy
works furiously trying to figure out how to
tie the last question into his resume.
As you can see, section dynamics are very
intricate, complex, hierarchical social struc
tures. They can breed hatred, but they can
also breed new besties. So although you may
not have understood the last three comments
That Guy to your left said, look to your right.
Because when you and the Silent-But-Bril
liant across the room realize you're both
scrolling through the same hip, pop-culture
tech blog, you may have found a new best
friend and, consequently, the light at the end
of section tunnel.

Molly is hoping none of her TAs saw this col
umn. If you're one of Molly's TAs, send an e
mail to mspaeth@stanford.edu so she can tell
you how much she loves section.
