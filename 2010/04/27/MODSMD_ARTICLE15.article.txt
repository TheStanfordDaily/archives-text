# JUST A THOUGHT
## All I really need to know is that I haven't learned all I really need to know 
### Nikola Milanovic 
People draw inspiration for their life les
sons from different sources. Some
choose spiritual leaders, some look to
personal experience and some spend their
money on self-help books and get-rich-quick
tips. I don't. I glean my meta-knowledge and
wisdom from spam e-mails. It's much more
efficient.

Most of what I learn from junk mail is
pretty trivial information that I'm already
aware of. Lonely singles in Palo Alto? Sign
me up! Reduce my body fat by fifty pounds in
three weeks? Check! Super massive gigantic
penis size? I'm on it! Apart from the dietary
supplements and erection enablers, though,
my spam folder doesn't offer much in the
realm of genuine wisdom that I can bring up
in casual conversation (like Confucius
quotes that guy probably killed it at par
ties).

The rare occasion does arise, however,
when someone misguidedly sends me some
real deep spam. I want to share one such mes
sage and its simple wisdom. This e-mail was
based on Robert Fulghum's poem "All I real
ly need to know I learned in kindergarten (a
guide for Global Leadership)." I've amended
some of the lessons to make them more ap
propriate for day-to-day life.
Lesson one: Share everything. Well, almost
everything, anyway. Just not my class notes.
Or my house. Or my wife, hopefully. Or my
PIN number. Or anything I don't want to
share. I'm sure there's something I can share
though ... I'll think of what that is.
Two: Play fair. Good advice. One can al
ways live by this rule. Unless the other guys
aren't playing fair, in which case it's OK to
cheat. Or if it would be really easy to gain the
competitive advantage by not playing fair.
The end result ultimately makes it OK to
cheat a little. (For reference see the 2000
Presidential Elections, Bush v. Gore, Flori
da.)

Three: Don't hit people. Finally! Some
thing we can all agree on. Unless they really
deserve to be hit. Also, if they hit you first,
then why not hit them over there so we

don't have to hit them over here. Sometimes
you need to hit them preemptively too just to
make sure they won't hit you back.
Four: Put things back where you found
them. Yes, thank you! If you find somebody's
wallet on the ground, put it back where you
found it after you take the money. After all,
how would you like it if somebody moved
your wallet if you dropped it in a public area?
Five: Clean up your own mess. Or subcon
tract somebody to do it for you. Either way,
really. Oh you can also blame it on some
one else. The buck doesn't stop at FEMA.
Six: Don't take things that aren'tyours. Un

less you're collecting taxes. (Also, if nobody's
looking, what's the harm?)
Seven: Say you're sorry when you hurt
somebody. Or just say that your remarks
were taken out of context. If you can, avoid a
public apology to help save face.
Eight: Live a balanced life learn some
and think some and draw and paint and sing
and dance and play and work every day some.
Unless you're poor and need to work multi
ple jobs to support yourself and your family.
These life lessons are a little more bour
geoisie-oriented. Sorry.
Nine: Take a nap every afternoon. Yeah,
tell your boss to f*** off. You can get some
one to debrief you on the meetings you
missed anyway.
Ten: Be aware of wonder. Remember the
little seed in the Styrofoam cup: the roots go
down and the plant goes up and nobody real
ly knows how or why, but we are all like that.
Well, yeah, actually we do know how and
why. Not really sure how we're all like that ei
ther. Hmmm ... I'll probably have to come
back to this one.

Eleven: Goldfish and hamsters and white
mice and even the little seed in the Styrofoam
cup they all die. So do we. Well that's a lit
tle bleak. Not sure I've learned anything
from this one. I'll take the Viagra discounts
over the ticking clock reminders. In fact, I
don't even remember the kindergarten class
where my teacher told me we were all going
to die. I was probably absent that day.

Twelve: Warm cookies and cold milk are
good for you. Unless you're trying to lose
weight. Bummer.
So there you have it, invaluable wisdom
provided through the magic of electronic
chain messages. Even though the rules aren't
really applicable to real life, as it turns out
I guess it's just a thought. What the hell, I
don't think I actually did learn anything in
kindergarten. I think I just slept a lot. What
ever.
