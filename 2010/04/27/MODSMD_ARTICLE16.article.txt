## STANFORD WINS MPSF 
### CLAUDIA LOPEZ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Cardinal came up big this weekend, tak
ing the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation
(MPSF) women's water polo regular season
title from USC in a thriller on Saturday after
noon at home that ended in a 7-6 victory.
Stanford started out the match strong as
sophomore Melissa Seidemann skipped in the
first goal on a penalty shot, but the Trojans re
sponded by scoring the next four goals, erasing
the Cardinal's momentum.

However, Stanford didn't go down and was
able to turn around and make a comeback.
"We buckled down on defense and decided
that we were not going to let them score once
they went up 4-1," said freshman two-meter of
fense Annika Dries. "We kept our composure
even though we got down early. I think this
mentality is going to be key going into MPSF
Championships and NCAAs. No matter what
the score is, whether we are ahead or behind, we
have to stay focused and execute our game
plan."

The Cardinal would not allow a repeat of its
last match against USC, when Stanford lost its
No. 1 ranking.

"This was the same situation that we were in
the last time we played USC," said senior driv

er Kelsey Holshouser. "During the second
quarter of this game, however, we had a critical
goal by Monica [Coughlan] to kind of spark us
back in to action. Our defense was pretty solid
after the first quarter so it was a matter of tak
ing advantage of the chances we had on the of
fensive end. I think that goal by Monica really
got us back in to it and it let our opponents
know that we weren't out of it yet."
The Cardinal kept its cool and did not let the
game slip out of its grasp.

"We did a really good job of staying calm
when we were behind," said sophomore two
meter defender Monica Coughlan, whose goal
made the game 4-2 and sparked the Stanford
comeback. "We always felt like we were in con
trol of the game, even when we got down 4-1
early. We never stopped attacking."

The Cardinal was determined to turn the
game around. Not only was it Senior Night, but
it was also the fight for the No. 1 seed for the
MPSF Tournament this upcoming weekend.
"After our first quarter when we were down,
we came together and told ourselves we need
ed to play together as a unit and focus on each
possession," said senior driver Kelly Eaton.
By the end of the first half, Stanford was only
down 4-3 to the Trojans. By the third period, the
Cardinal had fully recovered, as the score was
tied 5-5.

In the remaining quarter, each team scored
a single point, forcing the match into overtime.
Eaton scored the final goal, resulting in Stan
ford's outstanding 7-6 win.

The last time the Cardinal played the Tro
jans, it lost 10-6.

"We were able to respond to going down by
three goals this time instead of going down by

four," Holshouser said. "I don't think there is a
single thing that we can point out and say, 'We
did this differently, so we were able to outlast
them.' Amber [Oland] made some amazing
plays in the goal, Jess [Steffens] had some great
shot blocks in front of the goal, Alex [Koran]
made some huge moves in front of the goal and
we got lucky on some stuff. We are going to
need all of this and more as we move forward."
"I think the main difference between the
two games was our defense," Coughlan added.
"Last time we played USC, we didn't play the
team defense that we have played all season,
and that hurt us on both sides of the pool. This
weekend we were much more controlled on the
defensive end, and we used that to our advan
tage on the transitions from defense to of
fense."
Overall, the entire team contributed to the
win. Junior goalkeeper Amber Oland saved an
impressive 13 shots. Eaton and Holshouser
each skipped in two goals. Coughlan, Seide
mann and junior driver Kim Krueger each
tacked on a single point as well.
Now the Cardinal will head to Los Angeles
this weekend to compete in the MPSF Tourna
ment.

GAME NOTES: The Cardinal won the MPSF regular season
title on Senior Day, taking down No. 1 USC last Saturday
at home. In the victory, seniors Kelly Eaton and Kelsey
Holshouser each scored twice, with Eaton's final goal
giving Stanford the win in overtime. Next, the Cardinal
faces No. 8 seeded Arizona State in the MPSF confer
ence tournament on April 30th.

tain our focus one game at a time and
keep high intensity throughout our
practices and games," Coughlan said.
"It was great to beat USC, but we still
have areas of the game that we need
to improve, which is what we will be
working on this coming week."
The Cardinal began to prepare for
the tournament the morning after its
win.
"We had practice on Sunday
morning and we watched the entire
game," Holshouser said. "We have

some things that we need to clean up
both on offense and defense. Some
thing as simple as passing is going to
be key as we move forward, and for
the first 10 minutes of the game we
looked bad on that."
Now that the MPSF Tournament
is upon the Cardinal, the senior team
members must say goodbye to the
Avery Aquatic Center and home
games.

"It was extremely exciting playing
our last game against USC and win
ning in overtime," Eaton said. "It was
surreal standing in front of the rest of
the team like I have watched the sen
iors do every year in the past. These
last four years have sped by."

After the MPSF and NCAA tour

naments, the season will be over for
the Cardinal.
"It is hard to really pinpoint the
things that I am going to miss about
this team," Holshouser said. "I learn
something new from my teammates
each day, whether it has to do with
water polo, biology or someone's
childhood. I truly can't imagine
spending four years anywhere else
and that is 100 percent because of the
people that I get to play with each
day."
Stanford begins play in Los Ange
les this Friday at 1:30 p.m. against Ari
zona State.
