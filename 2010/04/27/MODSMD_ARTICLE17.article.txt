# CARD FAILS SHORT AT PAC-10S
## 
### MICHAEL LAZARUS STAFF WRITER 
The stage was set per
fectly.
The No. 7 Stanford
men's tennis team, fresh
off a victory over Cal to
claim its first conference
title in four years, headed
to the Pac-10 Champi
onships in Ojai, Calif, with
big expectations.
Simply put, the Cardi
nal disappointed.
Most of that disap
pointment can be traced
directly to USC's Robert
Farah, who is making a
name for himself as a
Stanford killer.
Farah, the eventual sin
gles champion, defeated
sophomore RyanThacher
in the semifinals and soph
omore Bradley Klahn in
the finals. The loss was es
pecially tough for Klahn,
who won the tournament
last year. It was the third
time Klahn has lost to
Farah this season.

While the Cardinal clearly is not happy with the results, the
team is not letting what happened bother it too much.
"It was a good tournament to get matches in and see some fu
ture opponents, but we're not as concerned with the result," said
junior Alex Clayton.

GAME NOTES: With team regular season play
over, the Cardinal traveled to Ojai to play in
the Pac-10 Championships. On the singles
side of the tournament, sophomores
Bradley Klahn and Ryan Thacher both per
formed well, with Thacher advancing to the
semifinals and Klahn finishing as runner-up
after falling to USC's Robert Farah in the fi
nals. In doubles, the duo of Klahn and

Thacher also led the way for Stanford,
reaching the semifinals before losing to a
pair from UCLA. In the Invitational Pac-10
Men's Doubles, Stanford's pair of freshman
Walker Kehrer and junior Greg Hirshman
won the title, beating Washington's Tobi
Obenaus and Alex Rosinski.
