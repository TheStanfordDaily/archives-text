# CARD FAILS SHORT AT PAC-10S
## 
### MICHAEL LAZARUS STAFF WRITER 
The stage was set per
fectly.
The No. 7 Stanford
men's tennis team, fresh
off a victory over Cal to
claim its first conference
title in four years, headed
to the Pac-10 Champi
onships in Ojai, Calif, with
big expectations.
Simply put, the Cardi
nal disappointed.
Most of that disap
pointment can be traced
directly to USC's Robert
Farah, who is making a
name for himself as a
Stanford killer.
Farah, the eventual sin
gles champion, defeated
sophomore RyanThacher
in the semifinals and soph
omore Bradley Klahn in
the finals. The loss was es
pecially tough for Klahn,
who won the tournament
last year. It was the third
time Klahn has lost to
Farah this season.

While the Cardinal clearly is not happy with the results, the
team is not letting what happened bother it too much.
"It was a good tournament to get matches in and see some fu
ture opponents, but we're not as concerned with the result," said
junior Alex Clayton.

GAME NOTES: With team regular season play
over, the Cardinal traveled to Ojai to play in
the Pac-10 Championships. On the singles
side of the tournament, sophomores
Bradley Klahn and Ryan Thacher both per
formed well, with Thacher advancing to the
semifinals and Klahn finishing as runner-up
after falling to USC's Robert Farah in the fi
nals. In doubles, the duo of Klahn and

Thacher also led the way for Stanford,
reaching the semifinals before losing to a
pair from UCLA. In the Invitational Pac-10
Men's Doubles, Stanford's pair of freshman
Walker Kehrer and junior Greg Hirshman
won the title, beating Washington's Tobi
Obenaus and Alex Rosinski.

Senior Richard Wire goes up for a serve at the Pac- 10 Championships in
Los Angeles. After claiming both the singles and doubles titles in last
year's tournament, the Cardinal struggled to find similarsuccess this year.
Six Stanford players were selected
to play in the singles tournament
Klahn, Thacher, Clayton, freshman
Denis Lin, junior Greg Hirshman and
senior Richard Wire.
Lin and Hirshman both lost in the
first round, to Amit Inbar of UCLA
and Jeevan Nedunchezhiyan of
Washington, respectively. Wire won
his first round match against Ravid
Hazi of Arizona, but fell to UCLA's
Nick Meister in the Round of 16.
Clayton cruised over Arizona's Borja
Malo in straight sets in the opening
round, but lost to UCLA's Matt
Brooklyn in three sets the next round.
That left Thacher and Klahn.
Thacher, the tournament's No. 3
seed, had three consecutive straight
set victories to advance into the semis
against Farah. Klahn, the tourna
ment's No. 2 seed, didn't have quite
as easy of a path, with two of his three
victories taking three sets.
The semis were an all-Stanford
and USC affair Klahn faced the
Trojans' Daniel Nguyen, as Thacher
took on Farah. Farah made quick
work of Thacher, winning 6-4, 6-3,
while Klahn took down Nguyen 6-3,
5-7, 6-3 to set up another Klahn-
Farah match-up.

The first time the two faced off,
USC was visiting Stanford. Due to a
threat of rain, the teams played sin
gles first. With the Cardinal leading 3-
2 after five singles matches, Klahn
had a chance to ice the match before
doubles. In a back-and-forth match in
which both players seemingly had it
locked up, Klahn dropped a heart
breaker 7-6,6-7,7-5. USC then went

on to win the doubles point to win the
match.
The next matchup between Klahn
and Farah, this time down in Los An
geles, was even more of a thriller.
Farah won the first set 7-6 (5), but
Klahn rebounded in the second set,
winning 6-1. The decisive third set
went to a tiebreaker, with Farah
eking out a 7-6 (8) victory. Stanford
lost 5-2.
"Every match we've played has
been close," Klahn said. "We have de
veloped a pretty good rivalry in my
two years at Stanford."
In Ojai, it was more of the same.
Farah got off to a fast start, claiming
an easy 6-2 first set victory. In the sec
ond set, Klahn was unable to win the
tiebreak, losing 7-6 (5) to give Farah
the title.
"It would have been pretty unbe
lievable just to win it back-to-back
years as a freshman and sophomore,"
Klahn said. "1 still have nothing to be
ashamed of getting to the finals."
On the doubles side, Stanford en
tered three teams Klahn and
Thacher, Wire and Clayton, and Lin
and freshman Matt Kandath. Wire
and Clayton lost in the first round
and Lin and Kandath lost to Farah
and Steve Johnson, who went on to
win the tournament.
Klahn and Thacher, the tourna
ment's No. 2 ranked team, fell to
Inbar and Meister in the semifinals.
One positive for Stanford that
came out of Ojai was the play of Hir
shman and freshman Walker Kehrer.
The duo, which has only played two
matches together all season, won the
Invitational bracket in doubles.

Up next for Stanford is something
it hasn't had in a while a break.The
Cardinal will have two weeks off be
fore the first round of the NCAA
Tournament begins.

For now, the Cardinal is trying to take
care of itself.
"We need to make sure we're in
jury-free," Clayton said. "We had
three or four guys hurt last year in the
tournament which was costly."
Stanford is waiting to see if it will
host the first round of the NCAA
Tournament, which begins May 15.

The stage was set per
fectly.
The No. 7 Stanford
men's tennis team, fresh
off a victory over Cal to
claim its first conference
title in four years, headed
to the Pac-10 Champi
onships in Ojai, Calif, with
big expectations.
Simply put, the Cardi
nal disappointed.
Most of that disap
pointment can be traced
directly to USC's Robert
Farah, who is making a
name for himself as a
Stanford killer.
Farah, the eventual sin
gles champion, defeated
sophomore RyanThacher
in the semifinals and soph
omore Bradley Klahn in
the finals. The loss was es
pecially tough for Klahn,
who won the tournament
last year. It was the third
time Klahn has lost to
Farah this season.

While the Cardinal clearly is not happy with the results, the
team is not letting what happened bother it too much.
"It was a good tournament to get matches in and see some fu
ture opponents, but we're not as concerned with the result," said
junior Alex Clayton.

GAME NOTES: With team regular season play
over, the Cardinal traveled to Ojai to play in
the Pac-10 Championships. On the singles
side of the tournament, sophomores
Bradley Klahn and Ryan Thacher both per
formed well, with Thacher advancing to the
semifinals and Klahn finishing as runner-up
after falling to USC's Robert Farah in the fi
nals. In doubles, the duo of Klahn and

Thacher also led the way for Stanford,
reaching the semifinals before losing to a
pair from UCLA. In the Invitational Pac-10
Men's Doubles, Stanford's pair of freshman
Walker Kehrer and junior Greg Hirshman
won the title, beating Washington's Tobi
Obenaus and Alex Rosinski.

Senior Richard Wire goes up for a serve at the Pac- 10 Championships in
Los Angeles. After claiming both the singles and doubles titles in last
year's tournament, the Cardinal struggled to find similarsuccess this year.
Six Stanford players were selected
to play in the singles tournament
Klahn, Thacher, Clayton, freshman
Denis Lin, junior Greg Hirshman and
senior Richard Wire.
Lin and Hirshman both lost in the
first round, to Amit Inbar of UCLA
and Jeevan Nedunchezhiyan of
Washington, respectively. Wire won
his first round match against Ravid
Hazi of Arizona, but fell to UCLA's
Nick Meister in the Round of 16.
Clayton cruised over Arizona's Borja
Malo in straight sets in the opening
round, but lost to UCLA's Matt
Brooklyn in three sets the next round.
That left Thacher and Klahn.
Thacher, the tournament's No. 3
seed, had three consecutive straight
set victories to advance into the semis
against Farah. Klahn, the tourna
ment's No. 2 seed, didn't have quite
as easy of a path, with two of his three
victories taking three sets.
The semis were an all-Stanford
and USC affair Klahn faced the
Trojans' Daniel Nguyen, as Thacher
took on Farah. Farah made quick
work of Thacher, winning 6-4, 6-3,
while Klahn took down Nguyen 6-3,
5-7, 6-3 to set up another Klahn-
Farah match-up.

The first time the two faced off,
USC was visiting Stanford. Due to a
threat of rain, the teams played sin
gles first. With the Cardinal leading 3-
2 after five singles matches, Klahn
had a chance to ice the match before
doubles. In a back-and-forth match in
which both players seemingly had it
locked up, Klahn dropped a heart
breaker 7-6,6-7,7-5. USC then went

on to win the doubles point to win the
match.
The next matchup between Klahn
and Farah, this time down in Los An
geles, was even more of a thriller.
Farah won the first set 7-6 (5), but
Klahn rebounded in the second set,
winning 6-1. The decisive third set
went to a tiebreaker, with Farah
eking out a 7-6 (8) victory. Stanford
lost 5-2.
"Every match we've played has
been close," Klahn said. "We have de
veloped a pretty good rivalry in my
two years at Stanford."
In Ojai, it was more of the same.
Farah got off to a fast start, claiming
an easy 6-2 first set victory. In the sec
ond set, Klahn was unable to win the
tiebreak, losing 7-6 (5) to give Farah
the title.
"It would have been pretty unbe
lievable just to win it back-to-back
years as a freshman and sophomore,"
Klahn said. "1 still have nothing to be
ashamed of getting to the finals."
On the doubles side, Stanford en
tered three teams Klahn and
Thacher, Wire and Clayton, and Lin
and freshman Matt Kandath. Wire
and Clayton lost in the first round
and Lin and Kandath lost to Farah
and Steve Johnson, who went on to
win the tournament.
Klahn and Thacher, the tourna
ment's No. 2 ranked team, fell to
Inbar and Meister in the semifinals.
One positive for Stanford that
came out of Ojai was the play of Hir
shman and freshman Walker Kehrer.
The duo, which has only played two
matches together all season, won the
Invitational bracket in doubles.

Up next for Stanford is something
it hasn't had in a while a break.The
Cardinal will have two weeks off be
fore the first round of the NCAA
Tournament begins.

For now, the Cardinal is trying to take
care of itself.
"We need to make sure we're in
jury-free," Clayton said. "We had
three or four guys hurt last year in the
tournament which was costly."
Stanford is waiting to see if it will
host the first round of the NCAA
Tournament, which begins May 15.
