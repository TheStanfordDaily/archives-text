## Card places in singles and doubles 
### WILL SEATON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford women's tennis team (20-1, 8-0
Pac-10) entered the Pac-10 Championships with six
players in the main draw and came away from a suc
cessful weekend with runner-up finishes in both sin
gles and doubles. The tournament's No. 1 seed, jun
ior Hilary Barte, was runner-up in singles and
earned a runner-up with senior Lindsay Burdette in
doubles.
After a dominating doubles performance
against USC that clinched the Pac-10 title outright,
the team started its individual matches full of fire.
Stanford had the most individuals in the singles
bracket. Five of the six players in the draw advanced
to the second round. Veronica Li fell to No. 5-seed
Andrea Remynse 6-1,2-6,6-4 in the first round.
"It was really nice to see all my teammates in our
draw," Barte said. "With six of us in the main draw,
it was nice to look around and see all those Stanford
shirts."
In the second round, Stanford suffered a few
closer losses that could have gone either way. No. 7
seed Mallory Burdette fell to unseeded Micaela
Hein from Arizona State 6-3, 7-5. No. 6 seed Mari
Andersson from California took out senior Lindsay
Burdette 6-3, 6-1, and in the most back-and-forth
match of the day, junior Carolyn McVeigh lost to
No. 3 Marina Cossou from California 1-6,7-5,6-4.
"We had some matches where it didn't go our
way," Lindsay Burdette said. "Like Mallory's
match, even though she played unbelievable, the
other girl had a better day."
With Stacey Tan and Barte still in, the two were
forced to meet in an all-Stanford quarterfinal. Tan
had already fought through a tough three-setter in

the first round before winning in
straights to get to the quarterfinals.
Meanwhile, Barte breezed through
her two opponents, losing a total of
four games. While this meant Stan
ford was guaranteed at least one
semifinalist, it put the two players in
an uncomfortable position.
"Playing Stacey in the quarters, it
was not a good feeling to be playing
my teammate," Barte said. "I wanted
her to do well, but then again, I want
ed to do well. It was like playing my
sibling. That was not a fun match be
cause it was a bad situation."

Barte ultimately prevailed 6-4,6-1
to secure her place in the semifinals.
The seeding had held up fairly well
throughout the tournament. The
final four was No. 1 Barte, No. 2 Yas
min Schnack from UCLA, No. 3 Cos
sou and No. 6 Andersson. In the op
posite semifinal, Schnack defeated
Andersson 7-5,6-2 to advance to the
finals. Barte advanced 6-2, 6-4 past
Cossou to set up a UCLA-Stanford
championship match against
Schnack.

"I played her at Americans,
played her in the season, so yeah, I
knew it was tough," Barte said of
Schnack. "She has a really good
game that matches up against mine,
so it's always pretty difficult."
In the championship match,
Schnack came out firing. In her sen
ior season, she downed Barte 6-4,7-5
to notch her first victory over Stan
ford's top player in four meetings
this season.

Doubles supplied less success for
the team overall, but provided a

great display of the doubles talent
between Barte and Lindsay Bur
dette. With three teams in the tourna
ment, only one made it out of the first
round.The No. 4 freshman tandem of
Mallory Burdette and Tan fell to Ari
zona's Natasha Marks and Claire Ri
etsch 8-4. Next, unseeded Veronica
Li and Carolyn McVeigh fell to
Danielle Lao and Alison Ramos of
USC 8-6.
Barte and Lindsay Burdette

cruised through their side of the
draw. They defeated a UCLA pair 8-
1 in the first, a pair from California 8-
4 in the second and a duo from Wash
ington 8-5 in the semis. Facing them
in the final was Barte's rival in the
singles, Schnack, and her partner An
drea Remynse. It proved to be a No.
1 versus No. 2 matchup in which
Schnack continued her recent spec
tacular play. Stanford was only able
to win one game in the championship
match, losing 6-1, 6-0 to earn a run
ner-up finish.
"My hat goes off to them because
they played so well," Lindsay Bur
dette said. "They did not give us one
opportunity to sneak in there and
they just did not stop. We definitely
didn't come out like they did and
they just kept it up throughout the
whole thing. I was proud of the way
Hilary and I just kept our heads up
and kept trying to find away to crack
them even though it was really tough
at times."
With a two-week break until
NCAAs begin, the team looks to use
the time off to perfect its game and
take advantage of the time to relax
their minds.

"Honestly, it's a mental break,"
Lindsay Burdette said. "It feels so
good to know that we have two
weeks to break any part of our game
down that wasn't doing so well or just
continue working on the things that
we do well. It's great to have that
chunk of time."
