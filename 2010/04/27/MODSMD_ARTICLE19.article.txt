# Stanford volleyball entertains

What do you want in a
sporting event? Ac
tion? Athleticism?
Drama? Skill? Ten
sion? Excitement?
You get all of that and more at a Stan
ford men's volleyball match.
For many people, volleyball is not the
most attractive sport in theory, especially
when the participants aren't attractive
women in skintight shorts. But there 's so
much more to volleyball, men's or
women's, than attire, and it only takes
one match to see that.
Take last Saturday's match against
UC-Irvine, for example. Just walking
into Maples Pavilion and seeing over
1,000 raucous fans is something special.
Sure, it's not a sport like football than can
approach 50,000, but volleyball is much
more about close, intense crowds than
large swarms of people.
The fans make up for the quantity
with quality. What is quality fandom?
Painted chests, Star Wars costumes and
clever jeers are as much a part of volley
ball as a kill or a dig. And when a hundred
costumed frat guys are yelling your
name in unison from 10 feet away, it
makes a difference. Nowhere was this
more effective than with UCl's Austin
D'Amore, who noticeably trembled
amid jeers from the crowd before miss
ing serves. What's not to like about a
sport where fans can impact the game?
Along with the heckling students and
costumes, there is even more action on
the court. Volleyball has the special com
bination of being easy to understand
(don't let the ball hit the floor on your
own side, etc.) while featuring athletic
achievements that almost every fan can
not do. This makes for very exciting
points that even an inexperienced spec
tator can appreciate.

Several of these were on display Sat
urday night, including a particularly long
rally that involved UCl's best player,
Carson Clark, crashing into the press
table in order to keep the point going.
Stanford had its share of athletic feats, in
cluding a number of diving digs by soph
omore libera Erik Shoji (of Youtube and
Sports Center fame for his kick save) as
well as a remarkable assist to MPSF
Player of the Year Brad Lawson that
brought the house down. These dives
contrast with the sky-high blocks and
emphatic kills provided by front-line
players like Lawson and senior opposite
Evan Romero.

What makes volleyball more than
just an athletic display, though, is the skill
and precision involved. Players can
smash the ball and dive all over the floor,
but it doesn't mean anything unless the
passes, kills and blocks are accurate. Par
ticular credit has to be given to the head
coach, and Stanford has one of the best in
John Kosty, who was named MPSF
Coach of the Year. Kosty has perfected
his rotations and called crucial timeouts
to keep UCI from building too much
momentum.

Tactics also matter for players, and
senior setter Kawika Shoji is one of the
best in the country at making decisions
along with his athletic play. He expertly
produces perfect assists out of slightly
misplaced passes, and he always catches
opponents off-guard by sneaking in kills
off "dumps." Kawika did everything for
Stanford on Saturday, including a couple
vital aces.

Volleyball is intriguing because a few
players have a large impact, but a team
cannot win without a complete team ef
fort. Hitters like Lawson, Romero and
junior Spencer McLachlin cannot get
kills without assists, and Kawika Shoji
cannot make good sets without good
passes from the back row, especially
from his brother Erik.These players can
not get to all the balls without good
blocking, which Stanford has in the form
of sophomore Gus Ellis and senior Gar
rett Werner, who both had resounding
blocks and kills to fire up the team and
the crowd on Saturday.The Cardinal gets
important contributions off the bench as
well, and all these players are important
to the overall success of the team.

If these are not reasons enough to go
watch volleyball, consider this: Stanford
is the No. 1 team in the nation, and last
Saturday's win was the first postseason
victory forthe Cardinal since 1997, when
Stanford won its last national title. As the
top team, Stanford will play host to the
rest of the MPSF Tournament, and the
NCAA Tournament, which will take
place in Maples Pavilion as well. The
Cardinal needs only four more wins to
secure its first national championship in

over a decade and the first national title
for any Stanford varsity sport this year.
Its quest continues Thursday, and the
team and sport need your support,
whether or not you have a C-3PO cos
tume.
