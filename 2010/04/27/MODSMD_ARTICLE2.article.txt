## Former counterterrorism official discusses U.S.-Muslim relations 
### DEVIN BANERJEE SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Ambassador Henry Crumpton,
the State Department's coordinator
for counterterrorism from 2005 to
2007, addressed more than 50 stu
dents and community members
Monday night on the relationship be
tween the United States and the Mus
lim world, trying to take a unified ap
proach to the topic but eventually ac
ceding to discuss the current and
widely different issues in Iraq,
Afghanistan and Iran.

Citing Gallup poll statistics that
reinforce the schism between Islam
and the West, Crumpton sought to
get at the heart of the intricate ten
sion between Muslim nations and the
United States. Specifically, he asked
why 44 percent of Americans believe
Muslims hold extreme views of their
religion, and why 22 percent say they
would not want a Muslim neighbor,
when the two entities share common
values such as trust, respect, justice
and the dignity of human beings.
"Living, working, spying and fight
ing in many parts of the world bring
me to the same conclusion," said the
53-year-old.

The short answer, Crumpton said,
is both sides' lack of "empathetic re
spect" for the other. This missing fac
tor, he continued, stems from three
characteristics of the current state of
the world: the asymmetry of warfare,
the growing power of non-state ac
tors and the global nature of the bat
tlefield.

Citing differences in instruments
such as nuclear and chemical
weapons, computer viruses and
media influence between Muslim
countries and the United States,
Crumpton called today's warfare
asymmetrical to an "unprecedented"

extent.
"Never before in the history of
war have we seen the ability of so few
to bring so much damage to so many,"
he said, terming the phenomenon
"micro actors with macro impact."
Also to blame for misunderstand
ings between Islam and the West, ac
cording to Crumpton, is the growing
power of non-state actors such as cor
porations, the media, universities and
NGOs.
"This is difficult for Washington to
think about," he said.
The global nature of the "battle
field" between the two forces further
contributes to the divide between
them, Crumpton said. With Muslims
and Americans interacting all over
the world, misunderstanding is wide
spread.
Together, the asymmetry, the
power of non-state actors and the
global nature of U.S. international re
lations "contribute to a huge gap, a
growing misunderstanding between
the U.S. and other forces, including
the Muslim community," said
Crumpton.
Whether discussing Iraq,
Afghanistan or Iran, the ambassador
emphasized the importance of "non
kinetic" tactics to success of U.S. ob
jectives.
U.S. intervention and post-conflict
reconstruction in Iraq, Crumtpon
said, failed to utilize such tactics.
"What if we identified the enemy as
Saddam [Hussein] and his followers
in the army, while working in concert
with our Iraqi allies?" he asked, indi
cating his opinion that the strategy
toward Iraq should have been more
detailed and methodical. "No, instead
we declared war against the nation
state of Iraq."

Yesterday, Ambassador Henry Crumpton spoke to students about the "growing
misunderstanding between the U.S. and other forces, including the Muslim community."
On the other hand, Afghanistan,
the country in which Crumtpon spe
cialized as deputy chief of operations
for the ClA's counterterrorism cen
ter in 2001 and 2002, was more suc
cessful because it identified the
threat as al-Qaeda and those Taliban
commanders who chose to ally with
Osama bin Laden. "It was because of
our emphasis on our allies, our focus
on the people and our respect for our
Afghan allies," he said.
Coming to terms with Iran will be
more difficult because a firm regime
is in place there. The approach, then,
Crumpton said, should be to engage
the non-state population in Iran via
allies in the region. At a state level,
Crumpton said the United States
should also continue to build consen
sus among the U.N. Security Council
members, specifically China and
Russia, in order to sanction Iran for

its ongoing development of a nuclear
weapons program.

Crumpton, who worked directly
with Secretary of State Condoleezza
Rice, a political science professor at
Stanford, during the last administra
tion, called the Obama administra
tion's efforts in the Middle East a
"learning process." He said there is
some continuity in policy due to De
fense Secretary Robert Gates' role
under both President Bush and Pres
ident Obama.

"If you look at the policies them
selves, there has not been enough
change between Bush and Obama,"
Crumpton said. "It's important that
we [the United States] have the right
message, but it's more important that
we have the right policies."
Carol Kuiper '63, an audience
member, agreed that both message
and policy are essential on the part of
the United States, but she said she be
lieves there is a stark dichotomy be
tween the two when it comes to rela
tions with the Muslim world.

"We speak of respect, but I think a
lot of Muslim people don't see that

respect in how we interact with
them," Kuiper said. "The West de
serves a bad rap in a lot of ways.
"I think we have to try to be a lit
tle more subtle, a little more under
standing in how we've become the
target and how we are to react to
that," she added.

Tabatha Robinson 'l2 wasn't sat
isfied with the 90-minute discussion.
"He speaks like a politician," she said
of Crumpton.
A specific point made by the am
bassador that elicited several ques
tions from the audience was his belief
that al-Qaeda's motivation for at
tacking the United States on 9/11 was
rooted in a fear of modernization.

"ft seems so idealistic," Robinson
said. "As if they [al-Qaeda] don't
have a reason to fear modernization.
Not all aspects of modernization are
good, you know?"

lim world, trying to take a unified ap
proach to the topic but eventually ac
ceding to discuss the current and
widely different issues in Iraq,
Afghanistan and Iran.

Citing Gallup poll statistics that
reinforce the schism between Islam
and the West, Crumpton sought to
get at the heart of the intricate ten
sion between Muslim nations and the
United States. Specifically, he asked
why 44 percent of Americans believe
Muslims hold extreme views of their
religion, and why 22 percent say they
would not want a Muslim neighbor,
when the two entities share common
values such as trust, respect, justice
and the dignity of human beings.
"Living, working, spying and fight
ing in many parts of the world bring
me to the same conclusion," said the
53-year-old.

The short answer, Crumpton said,
is both sides' lack of "empathetic re
spect" for the other. This missing fac
tor, he continued, stems from three
characteristics of the current state of
the world: the asymmetry of warfare,
the growing power of non-state ac
tors and the global nature of the bat
tlefield.

Citing differences in instruments
such as nuclear and chemical
weapons, computer viruses and
media influence between Muslim
countries and the United States,
Crumpton called today's warfare
asymmetrical to an "unprecedented"

extent.
"Never before in the history of
war have we seen the ability of so few
to bring so much damage to so many,"
he said, terming the phenomenon
"micro actors with macro impact."
Also to blame for misunderstand
ings between Islam and the West, ac
cording to Crumpton, is the growing
power of non-state actors such as cor
porations, the media, universities and
NGOs.
"This is difficult for Washington to
think about," he said.
The global nature of the "battle
field" between the two forces further
contributes to the divide between
them, Crumpton said. With Muslims
and Americans interacting all over
the world, misunderstanding is wide
spread.
Together, the asymmetry, the
power of non-state actors and the
global nature of U.S. international re
lations "contribute to a huge gap, a
growing misunderstanding between
the U.S. and other forces, including
the Muslim community," said
Crumpton.
Whether discussing Iraq,
Afghanistan or Iran, the ambassador
emphasized the importance of "non
kinetic" tactics to success of U.S. ob
jectives.
U.S. intervention and post-conflict
reconstruction in Iraq, Crumtpon
said, failed to utilize such tactics.
"What if we identified the enemy as
Saddam [Hussein] and his followers
in the army, while working in concert
with our Iraqi allies?" he asked, indi
cating his opinion that the strategy
toward Iraq should have been more
detailed and methodical. "No, instead
we declared war against the nation
state of Iraq."

Yesterday, Ambassador Henry Crumpton spoke to students about the "growing
misunderstanding between the U.S. and other forces, including the Muslim community."
On the other hand, Afghanistan,
the country in which Crumtpon spe
cialized as deputy chief of operations
for the ClA's counterterrorism cen
ter in 2001 and 2002, was more suc
cessful because it identified the
threat as al-Qaeda and those Taliban
commanders who chose to ally with
Osama bin Laden. "It was because of
our emphasis on our allies, our focus
on the people and our respect for our
Afghan allies," he said.
Coming to terms with Iran will be
more difficult because a firm regime
is in place there. The approach, then,
Crumpton said, should be to engage
the non-state population in Iran via
allies in the region. At a state level,
Crumpton said the United States
should also continue to build consen
sus among the U.N. Security Council
members, specifically China and
Russia, in order to sanction Iran for

its ongoing development of a nuclear
weapons program.

Crumpton, who worked directly
with Secretary of State Condoleezza
Rice, a political science professor at
Stanford, during the last administra
tion, called the Obama administra
tion's efforts in the Middle East a
"learning process." He said there is
some continuity in policy due to De
fense Secretary Robert Gates' role
under both President Bush and Pres
ident Obama.

"If you look at the policies them
selves, there has not been enough
change between Bush and Obama,"
Crumpton said. "It's important that
we [the United States] have the right
message, but it's more important that
we have the right policies."
Carol Kuiper '63, an audience
member, agreed that both message
and policy are essential on the part of
the United States, but she said she be
lieves there is a stark dichotomy be
tween the two when it comes to rela
tions with the Muslim world.

"We speak of respect, but I think a
lot of Muslim people don't see that

respect in how we interact with
them," Kuiper said. "The West de
serves a bad rap in a lot of ways.
"I think we have to try to be a lit
tle more subtle, a little more under
standing in how we've become the
target and how we are to react to
that," she added.

Tabatha Robinson 'l2 wasn't sat
isfied with the 90-minute discussion.
"He speaks like a politician," she said
of Crumpton.
A specific point made by the am
bassador that elicited several ques
tions from the audience was his belief
that al-Qaeda's motivation for at
tacking the United States on 9/11 was
rooted in a fear of modernization.

"ft seems so idealistic," Robinson
said. "As if they [al-Qaeda] don't
have a reason to fear modernization.
Not all aspects of modernization are
good, you know?"
The event was sponsored by the
Muslim Student Awareness Net
work.
