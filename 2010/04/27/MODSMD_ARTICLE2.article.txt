## Former counterterrorism official discusses U.S.-Muslim relations 
### DEVIN BANERJEE SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Ambassador Henry Crumpton,
the State Department's coordinator
for counterterrorism from 2005 to
2007, addressed more than 50 stu
dents and community members
Monday night on the relationship be
tween the United States and the Mus
lim world, trying to take a unified ap
proach to the topic but eventually ac
ceding to discuss the current and
widely different issues in Iraq,
Afghanistan and Iran.

Citing Gallup poll statistics that
reinforce the schism between Islam
and the West, Crumpton sought to
get at the heart of the intricate ten
sion between Muslim nations and the
United States. Specifically, he asked
why 44 percent of Americans believe
Muslims hold extreme views of their
religion, and why 22 percent say they
would not want a Muslim neighbor,
when the two entities share common
values such as trust, respect, justice
and the dignity of human beings.
"Living, working, spying and fight
ing in many parts of the world bring
me to the same conclusion," said the
53-year-old.

The short answer, Crumpton said,
is both sides' lack of "empathetic re
spect" for the other. This missing fac
tor, he continued, stems from three
characteristics of the current state of
the world: the asymmetry of warfare,
the growing power of non-state ac
tors and the global nature of the bat
tlefield.

Citing differences in instruments
such as nuclear and chemical
weapons, computer viruses and
media influence between Muslim
countries and the United States,
Crumpton called today's warfare
asymmetrical to an "unprecedented"

extent.
"Never before in the history of
war have we seen the ability of so few
to bring so much damage to so many,"
he said, terming the phenomenon
"micro actors with macro impact."
Also to blame for misunderstand
ings between Islam and the West, ac
cording to Crumpton, is the growing
power of non-state actors such as cor
porations, the media, universities and
NGOs.
"This is difficult for Washington to
think about," he said.
The global nature of the "battle
field" between the two forces further
contributes to the divide between
them, Crumpton said. With Muslims
and Americans interacting all over
the world, misunderstanding is wide
spread.
Together, the asymmetry, the
power of non-state actors and the
global nature of U.S. international re
lations "contribute to a huge gap, a
growing misunderstanding between
the U.S. and other forces, including
the Muslim community," said
Crumpton.
Whether discussing Iraq,
Afghanistan or Iran, the ambassador
emphasized the importance of "non
kinetic" tactics to success of U.S. ob
jectives.
U.S. intervention and post-conflict
reconstruction in Iraq, Crumtpon
said, failed to utilize such tactics.
"What if we identified the enemy as
Saddam [Hussein] and his followers
in the army, while working in concert
with our Iraqi allies?" he asked, indi
cating his opinion that the strategy
toward Iraq should have been more
detailed and methodical. "No, instead
we declared war against the nation
state of Iraq."
