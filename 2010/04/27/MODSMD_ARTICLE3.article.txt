## UNPAID IN FULL 
### JESS WERTHEIM STAFF WRITER 
Unfortunately for college stu
dents and recent graduates
seeking networking or profes
sional experience, unpaid in
ternships are on the rise.
This trend places a financial burden on
some students and effectively closes cer
tain fields to the less economically privi
leged.
"I'm from a low-income family," said
Chia Siong 'l3. "I need a paid internship so
I can come back to school in the fall without
having to work two jobs at a time to pay off
student [loans]."
And if that isn't enough to worry about,
recent findings have uncovered that many
unpaid interns' jobs violate minimum
wage laws as stipulated by the Department
of Labor.
"It appears that illegal internships are
widespread, albeit concentrated in certain
industries," said Ross Perlin'os, who is cur
rently writing a book on the rise of intern
ships worldwide.
Legally, unpaid internships should focus
mostly on training interns to enter the field,
with a limited amount of grunt work. But in
the current economic climate, unpaid intern
ships seem to be cropping up as substitutes
for paying jobs. This harms both the unpaid
interns and paid professionals, Perlin said.
"Interns are now more likely to be doing

core work at organizations, whether they're
getting paid or not, and it's more likely that
they're replacing full-time employees in
one way or another," he said. "The nature
of some internship roles has seen a subtle
shift, as employers sense their advantage
and feel they can ask interns to do more."
This can lead to a more interesting and
substantive internship experience. But Per
lin said that's simply an indication that in
terns taking on fuller roles should be com
pensated for their work.
"It's bad news for anyone who cares
about there being decent, well-paid jobs
out there," he said.
Some departments, such as English and
communication, offer grants to students to
help them afford to take unpaid or lower
paying internships.
Alison Law 'lO received a $lOOO grant
from the English department last year that
allowed her to do an unpaid summer in
ternship at Yale University Press.
"There aren't too many paid summer
programs in the publishing industry," Law
said. "I was kind of resigned to pay my own
way for the summer until I found out about
the grant."
Law used the money to pay for part of
her rent. She said her job involved a lot of
what she called "typical intern work"
such as making copies but it was still a
valuable experience.
