## UNPAID IN FULL 
### JESS WERTHEIM STAFF WRITER 
Unfortunately for college stu
dents and recent graduates
seeking networking or profes
sional experience, unpaid in
ternships are on the rise.
This trend places a financial burden on
some students and effectively closes cer
tain fields to the less economically privi
leged.
"I'm from a low-income family," said
Chia Siong 'l3. "I need a paid internship so
I can come back to school in the fall without
having to work two jobs at a time to pay off
student [loans]."
And if that isn't enough to worry about,
recent findings have uncovered that many
unpaid interns' jobs violate minimum
wage laws as stipulated by the Department
of Labor.
"It appears that illegal internships are
widespread, albeit concentrated in certain
industries," said Ross Perlin'os, who is cur
rently writing a book on the rise of intern
ships worldwide.
Legally, unpaid internships should focus
mostly on training interns to enter the field,
with a limited amount of grunt work. But in
the current economic climate, unpaid intern
ships seem to be cropping up as substitutes
for paying jobs. This harms both the unpaid
interns and paid professionals, Perlin said.
"Interns are now more likely to be doing

core work at organizations, whether they're
getting paid or not, and it's more likely that
they're replacing full-time employees in
one way or another," he said. "The nature
of some internship roles has seen a subtle
shift, as employers sense their advantage
and feel they can ask interns to do more."
This can lead to a more interesting and
substantive internship experience. But Per
lin said that's simply an indication that in
terns taking on fuller roles should be com
pensated for their work.
"It's bad news for anyone who cares
about there being decent, well-paid jobs
out there," he said.
Some departments, such as English and
communication, offer grants to students to
help them afford to take unpaid or lower
paying internships.
Alison Law 'lO received a $lOOO grant
from the English department last year that
allowed her to do an unpaid summer in
ternship at Yale University Press.
"There aren't too many paid summer
programs in the publishing industry," Law
said. "I was kind of resigned to pay my own
way for the summer until I found out about
the grant."
Law used the money to pay for part of
her rent. She said her job involved a lot of
what she called "typical intern work"
such as making copies but it was still a
valuable experience.
"I learned a lot about the publishing
process which I couldn't have gotten any
other way," she said, adding that internship
experience is essentially a prerequisite for
publishing jobs. "Even if it's just making
copies, they look for that on your resume."
Stephanie Caro 'll is hoping to receive a
grant this year or snag a paid internship.
"I have looked into unpaid internships, but
only ones that could be funded independent
ly by Stanford through grants," she said. "Liv
ing costs are a huge factor in determining
which job I'm going to take and limit what I
applied for this year. Unless I magically found
somewhere to live that didn't charge me any
thing, I would need to take a paying position."
Lance Choy, director of the Career Devel
opment Center (CDC), said that Caro was not
alone in her concerns.
"For some, financial obligations can be an
important factor influencing their decisions
about summer work experiences," Choy said.
Unpaid internships are gaining prevalence
at Stanford as well, the New York Times re
ported. Companies posted 643 unpaid intern
ships on the CDC's job board last year, com
pared with 174 just two years ago.
Perlin said that institutions like the CDC
rarely do a thorough enough look into the
jobs they post.
"Career centers by and large do a very
poor job of screening the internships they ad
vertise to students and of educating students
about what's legal and ethical in an internship
position," he said. "My impression is that
many career centers are concerned about
their relationships with employers and with
getting as many students into as many intern

ships as possible, as long as they're not
heinously exploitative."
The CDC did not respond to e-mails about
this concern.
With more and more companies offering
only unpaid positions, many students face the
choice of accepting a position that may fur
ther their career but is unpaid or working for
a salary in a field they have absolutely no in
terest in.
"While I can explain to my parents that I'm
taking an unpaid internship for the experi
ence, they are still very [wary] of the notion of
working for nothing," said Kelly Kleespies'll.
"My parents have highly discouraged me
from taking something that is unpaid, but I
would still rather take an unpaid internship in
a field I'm interested in than a paid internship
or job in a field I don't want to enter after
graduation."
No matter the priorities, competition for
internships, paid or unpaid, legal or illegal, is
only intensifying. Nationwide, companies
have started receiving hundreds more appli
cations for only a few internship positions,
and many of those vying for the position are
well beyond their college years.
"Some of these applicants may have mas
ter's degrees, significant work experience, and
other very serious feathers in their caps," Per
lin said. "This extreme level of competition is
only a few years old and may be an artifact of
the recession, but it's certainly making it hard
er for younger people with less experience to
break in even when they're willing to work
for free or for some very low stipend."

pared with 174 just two years ago.
Perlin said that institutions like the CDC
rarely do a thorough enough look into the
jobs they post.
"Career centers by and large do a very
poor job of screening the internships they ad
vertise to students and of educating students
about what's legal and ethical in an internship
position," he said. "My impression is that
many career centers are concerned about
their relationships with employers and with
getting as many students into as many intern

ships as possible, as long as they're not
heinously exploitative."
The CDC did not respond to e-mails about
this concern.
With more and more companies offering
only unpaid positions, many students face the
choice of accepting a position that may fur
ther their career but is unpaid or working for
a salary in a field they have absolutely no in
terest in.
"While I can explain to my parents that I'm
taking an unpaid internship for the experi
ence, they are still very [wary] of the notion of
working for nothing," said Kelly Kleespies'll.
"My parents have highly discouraged me
from taking something that is unpaid, but I
would still rather take an unpaid internship in
a field I'm interested in than a paid internship
or job in a field I don't want to enter after
graduation."
No matter the priorities, competition for
internships, paid or unpaid, legal or illegal, is
only intensifying. Nationwide, companies
have started receiving hundreds more appli
cations for only a few internship positions,
and many of those vying for the position are
well beyond their college years.
"Some of these applicants may have mas
ter's degrees, significant work experience, and
other very serious feathers in their caps," Per
lin said. "This extreme level of competition is
only a few years old and may be an artifact of
the recession, but it's certainly making it hard
er for younger people with less experience to
break in even when they're willing to work
for free or for some very low stipend."
