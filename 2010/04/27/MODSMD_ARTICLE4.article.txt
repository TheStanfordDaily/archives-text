## Genetic test monitors transplant rejection 
### JULIA BROWNELL SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford researchers published
findings from a clinical trial that may
lead to a reduction in biopsies to
monitor rejection in heart transplant
patients.

The study compared rates of rejec
tion and other complications be
tween two cohorts of transplant pa
tients: one undergoing biopsy moni
toring and the other undergoing a
combination of the genetic test and

echocardiogram imaging. The rates of

rejection, death, re-transplantation
and other primary complications
were slightly lower in the genetic test
ing group (14.5 percent) than those in
the biopsy group (15.3 percent).
"The major finding is that a nonin
vasive approach to the monitoring of
heart transplant patients for rejection
is not inferior to an endomyocardial
biopsy approach that has been in
place for nearly 30 years," said Han
nah Valantine, a professor of cardio
vascular medicine and the chair of
