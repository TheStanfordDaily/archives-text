## Genetic test monitors transplant rejection 
### JULIA BROWNELL SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford researchers published
findings from a clinical trial that may
lead to a reduction in biopsies to
monitor rejection in heart transplant
patients.

The study compared rates of rejec
tion and other complications be
tween two cohorts of transplant pa
tients: one undergoing biopsy moni
toring and the other undergoing a
combination of the genetic test and

echocardiogram imaging. The rates of

rejection, death, re-transplantation
and other primary complications
were slightly lower in the genetic test
ing group (14.5 percent) than those in
the biopsy group (15.3 percent).
"The major finding is that a nonin
vasive approach to the monitoring of
heart transplant patients for rejection
is not inferior to an endomyocardial
biopsy approach that has been in
place for nearly 30 years," said Han
nah Valantine, a professor of cardio
vascular medicine and the chair of
the study.
The results of the study indicate
that the two tests are comparable in
effectiveness and that the new ge
netic test could, in many cases, possi
bly replace the biopsy monitoring
that many patients fear and find un
comfortable.

"Heart biopsies can be reduced
by a quarter of what's performed
currently using a combination of this
new blood test with the echocardio
graphy," Valantine said. "That can be
done safely without any risks to the
patient."
The 602 patients studied had had
their transplants six months to five
years before the study and were
characterized by a lower risk of re
jection. The conclusions of the study
are limited to this low-risk group,
posing the question of whether or
not investigators need to further
study its relevance in higher risk
groups.

Heart transplant patients can "re
ject" their donated heart if their im
mune system, even under immuno
suppressant drugs, attacks the organ
as a foreign object, as it would attack
a foreign pathogen. This episode of
rejection can compromise the trans
plant's effectiveness and have major
complications.
Currently, to ensure that rejec
tion is not occurring, doctors take a
biopsy of a patient's heart muscle
and examine it under a microscope.
To get the tissue, doctors insert a
catheter through a vein in the groin
or neck and travel down to the heart
to collect the tissue. Complications
happen in fewer than one percent of
these invasive procedures.
The new genetic test utilizes bio
markers in this case, the activity
of 11 different genes to deter
mine the risk that the body is reject
ing the organ.
"There are many biomarkers out
there for a whole number of things,"

Valantine said. "It is very rare to
want to do this type of clinical trial
that asks the question of the rele
vance of the biomarker to the man
agement of patients."
Patients also fear the biopsy pro
cedure, and Valantine explained that
their satisfaction, which the study
also monitored, significantly im
proved with the genetic treatment as
opposed to the biopsy.
The trial, called Invasive Moni
toring Attenuation through Gene
Expression (IMAGE), was conduct
ed at 13 heart transplant centers
across the country from 2005 to
2009. The findings were published in
the New England Journal of Medi
cine on Thursday.
