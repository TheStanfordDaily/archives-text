## Report on faculty sheds light on demographics Annual study describes University's gender, minority and hiring statistics for faculty 
### ELIZABETH TITUS MANAGING EDITOR 
The number of black and Hispanic faculty members at
Stanford reached a new high last year but, their numbers as
a percentage of total faculty have not increased in a decade.
That was among the conclusions in this year's Report on
the Faculty, an annual study by the provost's office about
hiring, loss and demographics at a university where about
one in four faculty is female and about one in five is a per
son of color.
"We'd like to move those numbers up more quickly," said
Patricia Jones, the vice provost for faculty development.
Jones presented the report, whose latest data is from 2008-
2009, to the Faculty Senate this month.
"We'd much rather be at sort of 50 percent women facul-
ty, like our student body," Jones said,
adding that the University would
like the percentage of faculty of
color to more closely mirror the stu
dent or national population, too.
"But obviously we can't get there
that quickly," Jones said.
The number of female under
graduates is nearly level with males
3,405 versus 3,473 this school
year, while 3,065 women make up 36
percent of the graduate student pop
ulation.
Stanford's top administrators
have made plain their support for
faculty diversity. In 2007, President
John Hennessy and Provost John
Etchemendy said in a recruiting re
port that Stanford's commitment to
diversity is based "on the belief that
a more diverse faculty enhances the
breadth, depth and quality of our re
search and teaching."
"A diverse faculty also provides a
variety of role models and mentors
for our increasingly diverse student
population," Hennessy and
Etchemendy said.
Three years later, Jones said chal
lenges still exist in recruiting and
keeping a diverse teaching staff.
Chief among those challenges is the
slow rate of faculty growth in gener
al, she said.
"The faculty as whole grows slow
ly," Jones said. During last year's
study period, the faculty grew 1.9
percent to 1,908 members, an aver
age rate in "recent years." That net
growth came from 100 hires and 65
departures.
"By growth in faculty, we mean
how many new hires we can make,"
Jones said. "That reflects the fact it
costs money to hire new faculty,"
which can includes such costs as
salaries, lab renovations and addi
tions to library collections.
The report also cited low faculty
turnover, "inadequate pipelines"

channeling women and minority
scholars toward faculty careers, and
the local cost of living as challenges
to diverse faculty recruitment.
In fact, in a survey of academics
who turned down jobs at Stanford in
2007-2008, housing cost and avail
ability was the top-named reason for
rejecting offers here.
About two thirds of the 45 people
who turned down faculty jobs that
year responded to the survey, ac
cording to Jones.
The median sale price for an on
campus home, where faculty and
some staff are eligible to buy, was
$1,556,000 in 2009, according to sta
tistics from the University's Faculty
Staff Housing office. There were 12
sales in 2009.
The two homes sold so far in 2010
went for a median $1,438,500. Santa
Clara County's median home price
in March was $500,000, the San Jose
Mercury News reported; in San
Mateo County, the median price was
$700,000.
Diversity by the Numbers
The report this month broke
down women and minorities' share
of faculty positions by rank, school
and other metrics.
Of the University's 1,908 faculty
members, 488 are women, accord
ing to the report. They make up 40
percent of senior fellows at Stan
ford's policy centers and institutes
and 19 percent of full professors.
20.5 percent of tenured faculty are
women, as are 34 percent of non
tenure line faculty.
Women's shares of spots in all
schools rose from 1999 to 2004, and
again from 2004 to 2009.
Faculty of color now make up
21.1 percent of faculty at Stanford,
according to the report. The num
ber of Asian faculty 290 as of
September 2009 has grown since
1999 and 2004. The number of black
faculty grew by four professors, to
49, between 2004 and 2009. The
number of Hispanic faculty is up
one during that period, to 61 mem
bers, while the number of Native

American professors three
has remained unchanged.
The report also examined tenure
rates by gender and ethnicity.
Among faculty up for tenure be
tween 1995 and 2002, 85.5 percent
of women and 79.3 percent of men
received tenure. 82.4 percent of
Asian faculty, 74.3 percent of
under-represented minorities and
83.3 percent of non-minority facul
ty who were up for tenure between
1989 and 2002 received it.
For non-tenure line faculty up
for tenure between 1995 and 2002,
women's and men's rates were
nearly level, at 53.5 percent and
53.7 percent respectively. Between
1989 and 2002, 52.5 percent of
Asian faculty, 39.4 percent of
under-represented minorities and
53.5 percent of non-minorities got
tenure.
The data are from an internal
database of the Faculty Affairs divi
sion of the provost's office, Jones
said.

'Ongoing Efforts'
Among the University's attempts
to "support" diverse faculty recruit
ment is the Faculty Development
Initiative of the Center for Compar
ative Studies in Race and Ethnicity.
Albert Camarillo, a history pro
fessor, heads the project "to facilitate
the identification and recruitment
and appointment of faculty who do
race and ethnicity studies," he said.
The initiative provides "some
guidelines and information about
consideration of their pool of faculty
recruits and applicants" to depart
ments searching for new hires, Ca
marillo said.
The five-year project, which began
in 2007, has been involved in hiring six
faculty in the School of Education
and the School of Humanities & Sci
ences so far, according to Camarillo; it
is authorized to help make 10 faculty
appointments in total.
