## Students, admins evaluate Stanford Card Plan service 
### BRIANNA PANG STAFF WRITER 
Seven months after the University rolled out a new Stan
ford Card Plan, students and administrators are evaluating
the plan's usefulness to those looking to cover money for
books before financial aid arrives or simply to print from
cluster computers.
Debuting in September 2009, the Stanford Card Plan al
lows students to charge up to $l,OOO at on-campus venues,
including the Stanford Bookstore, residential dining halls,

the CoHo, the Tree
house and Tresidder
Express. The charges
are added to students'
University bills.
According to Kelly
Takahashi, a manager
at the Student Services
Center, 7,892 students
are enrolled in the
Card Plan. The aver
age student uses $56; 86
percent of students use

less than $5OO. Only eight students have used more than
$9OO.
Students have the option to spend any amount, from $0
to $l,OOO. However, if students choose to use the plan, they
must sign up for a credit line of exactly $l,OOO.
Takahashi said the plan is not designed for profit, but
rather to help students cover payments before financial aid
money is made available each quarter.
"The University is not making any money from the Stan
ford Card Plan," Takahashi wrote in an e-mail to The Daily.
"The plan was implemented to accommodate students'
need for funds for academic-related purchases prior to the
disbursement of their financial aid."

Enrollment in the Card Plan has
also increased over time, according
toTakahashi. Since the plan seems to
be "well-received," she said, the plan
will continue next year.
Modifications have been made
since its launch, allowing students to
view the remaining balance of their
Card Plan in Axess through the Stu
dent Center tab.
"While additional enhancements
are not currently in the pipeline, we
will continue to improve the service
as needed," Takahashi said.
From September 1,2009 to Febru
ary 28, 2010, about 61 percent of
transactions were at the bookstore,
according to Takahashi. Twelve per
cent of purchases were in dining
halls, while six percent were for print
ing from Residential Computing.The
remaining 16 percent of purchases
were at the CoHo,Treehouse,Tresid
der Express and engineering print
ers.
Stanford Bookstore director
David Gough said many students do
use the Card Plan, but this usage
does not impact the bookstore in a
significant way.
"It's just another convenience op

tion," Gough said.
One student questioned the utili
ty of the card service.
Eric Yurko 'l3 said the plan
would "tempt" him into spending his
parents' money rather than his own,
explaining that he uses his debit card
first. Yurko therefore decided
against registering for the Stanford
Card Plan.
"If I feel like my parents should
pay for it, I tell them about it," Yurko
said. "I don't really see the point of
Stanford allowing me to tack anoth

er $l,OOO onto a bill that they can
charge late fees for, rather than me
directly taking the money from my
account."
Another student, Siobhan Mc-
Cabe 'll, who did sign up for the
plan, said she only uses it for printing.
"It's convenient because I can
print in my dorm," McCabe said.
"But other than that, I don't see the
point."
