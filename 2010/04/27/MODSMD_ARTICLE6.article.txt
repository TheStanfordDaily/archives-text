## Students, admins evaluate Stanford Card Plan service 
### BRIANNA PANG STAFF WRITER 
Seven months after the University rolled out a new Stan
ford Card Plan, students and administrators are evaluating
the plan's usefulness to those looking to cover money for
books before financial aid arrives or simply to print from
cluster computers.
Debuting in September 2009, the Stanford Card Plan al
lows students to charge up to $l,OOO at on-campus venues,
including the Stanford Bookstore, residential dining halls,

the CoHo, the Tree
house and Tresidder
Express. The charges
are added to students'
University bills.
According to Kelly
Takahashi, a manager
at the Student Services
Center, 7,892 students
are enrolled in the
Card Plan. The aver
age student uses $56; 86
percent of students use

less than $5OO. Only eight students have used more than
$9OO.
Students have the option to spend any amount, from $0
to $l,OOO. However, if students choose to use the plan, they
must sign up for a credit line of exactly $l,OOO.
Takahashi said the plan is not designed for profit, but
rather to help students cover payments before financial aid
money is made available each quarter.
"The University is not making any money from the Stan
ford Card Plan," Takahashi wrote in an e-mail to The Daily.
"The plan was implemented to accommodate students'
need for funds for academic-related purchases prior to the
disbursement of their financial aid."
