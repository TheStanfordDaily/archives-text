## Focusing on the nuclear threat 
### DEVIN BANERJEE SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Martin Hellman is trying to save the world. On
any given Tuesday afternoon last quarter, the
slender, 64-year-old emeritus professor of elec
trical engineering could have been found in a
windowless room of Hewlett Teaching Center,
dancing from the lectern to the whiteboard to draw three large
circles in a row.
He draws the first, swiftly, precisely. It's clear he's done this
many times.
"This is the current state of the world," he tells his dozen au
dience members, most students, some colleagues, arranged in a
checkerboard fashion
across the small, white
walled room.

Then, a circle to the
left of the first one. A new
possibility, with a line sig
nifying the path from the
first. He doesn't even
have to look at the board.
"This is what I like to
call new thinking, or the
state of acceptable risk,"
he says, the pitch of his
voice rising with a sense
of latent optimism, draw
ing a contrast with the
seemingly perpetually
furrowed brow above his
granite eyes. Audience
members shift in their
seats.
"And this," Hellman
says, drawing the third,
rightmost circle, this time

slower and more carefully. Eyes widen slightly across the room
as he then constructs the paths between the three circles. "This
one I call the disaster state."

'Clearly... This Was My Life'
Martin "Marty" Hellman was born and raised in the Bronx,
a place, he says, that gave him enough "chutzpah" to make him
think he could make a difference in the world. (Chutzpah, he
explained, is arrogance or nerve.)
Raised by a high school physics teacher and a stay-at-home
mother, Hellman graduated from New York University in 1966
with a degree in electrical engineering, before going on to earn
a master's and a Ph.D. in the same field from Stanford. In 1971,
he joined Stanford's faculty after a two-year stint at M.1.T., and
in 1976, with cryptographer Whitfield Diffie and researcher
Ralph Merkle, Hellman designed the Diffie-Hellman key ex
change, a protocol that today allows for the secure transfer of
sensitive information, such as buyer and seller information,
over insecure channels of the Internet.
The invention was a major boost to Hellman's career, and
he continued to teach until, around 1980, things began to
change for the then-35-year-old. The ice beneath his marriage
was getting thinner, he said, and the fast pace of his work was
n't helping. At the time, his wife, Dorothie, joined a group called
the Creative Initiative Foundation, and Hellman decided to
follow.
The group, an environmentally-minded nonprofit founded
by Graduate School of Business Prof. Harry Rathbun and his
wife, Emilia, was itself undergoing changes at the time. As
Ronald Reagan ascended to the presidency and the threat of

nuclear war came sharply into focus against the backdrop of
the Cold War, the group turned its attention to the environ
mental threats of nuclear weapons. And in his interactions with
the Rathbuns, Hellman was forever changed.
"Before the 'Bos, I was a typical Stanford professor in elec
trical engineering, who would have little interest in the nuclear
threat," Hellman said on a sunny weekend morning in the
kitchen of his campus home. "But I realized, through Creative
Initiative, that the same thinking that was behind environmen
tal problems was also behind the nuclear threat: the lack of
long-range thinking."
As Creative Initiative morphed into an international move
ment known as Beyond War, Hellman's focus was slipping fur
ther away from teaching and closer to the group's campaign to
reduce the nuclear threat. He took an 18-month leave from
Stanford, without pay, and in 1984 traveled to the U.S.S.R. to
have what he called "honest conversations" with Soviet scien
tists.
"Clearly, by the mid-'Bos, this was my life," Hellman said.
In 1987, at age 93, Harry Rathbun died in his Palo Alto
home. At about the same time, Hellman's wife, Dorothie, began
suffering from chronic migraine headaches that eventually
confined her to bed. Suffering from both the loss of his role
model in Beyond War as well as an increasingly tenuous mar
riage, Hellman continued to teach until, in 1996, he retired from
Stanford.
Then 50 years old, Hellman vowed to continue the work to
which Harry Rathbun had devoted his own life.
'Engineering' A Solution
"The risk that a child born today will not live out his or her
natural lifetime is 10 percent," Hellman said, citing his own
analysis of nuclear risk while seated at his kitchen table. A pic
ture of two girls, his granddaughters, flashed in a digital
slideshow on a nearby counter. Behind him, on his living room
couch, lay two puppies who, having finished chasing each other
around the house, were sleeping on one another's paws.
Without a doubt, it's a claim that grabs attention wherever
it's heard, whether in the Tuesday seminar Hellman teaches
voluntarily or on this Saturday morning in his home. But in no
way does he shy away from backing it up.
By using the technique known as risk analysis, Hellman, in
two papers published in 2008, breaks down states of the world
into separate, smaller sub-states. In the case of nuclear disaster,
then, a series of individual failures will first have to occur be
fore the world shifts from its current state to what Hellman
often terms "World War III," or the nuclear disaster state.
But, Hellman added, with the current mode of thinking to
ward nuclear weapons and deterrence thinking that he em
phatically and repeatedly calls uneducated crises such as
the 2008 war between Russia and Georgia, nuclear tests in
North Korea and missile testing in Iran only move the world
closer to nuclear disaster. Hellman's papers support a one-in
-1,000 percent chance, per year, of a catastrophic failure of nu
clear deterrence. By extension along the lines of discrete prob
ability, this can mean that a child born today has a 10 percent
chance of dying in nuclear war.
"Nuclear weapons are extremely dangerous, and yet socie
ty is acting as if there's not a problem," Hellman said. "Com
mon sense tells a lot of people that the risk is unacceptable, that
having fallible human beings, who can go crazy, in control of
these weapons is unacceptable."
So, what's the long-term solution? For Hellman, to shift
people's mode of thinking regarding nuclear weapons from a
reliance on deterrence to an insistence on disarmament. In
order to initiate this shift, Hellman launched nuclearrisk.org, a
website with resources designed to educate visitors on the risk
posed by nuclear weapons.

"Without a fundamental change in our thinking about na
tional security, our long-term risk really won't change," he said.
At Stanford, in addition to launching a weekly seminar on
the topic last quarter, Hellman is trying to start a campaign by
organizing a series of events this quarter that feature other nu
clear experts from the University. In short, he is trying to
achieve a tipping point in conversation about nuclear risk by
getting 10 percent of Stanford's undergraduate population, or
about 650 students, involved in the project.
"I'm an engineer, and I've tried to engineer a solution,"
Hellman said, in a conversation that featured an engineering
analogy every few sentences. "If market segmentation is going
after a market niche, the market I've indentified is Stanford's
6,500 undergraduates roughly 50,000 times smaller than the
national population."
Analogies aside, Hellman is a man on a mission, and it's a
mission in which he believes deeply. On a campus where nu
clear experts from every related field work to influence policy,
Hellman is, as he's done several times in his amorphous career,
breaking the mold. One of his favorite quotes, which he fre
quently uses in presentation and which he repeated for this in
terview, is Albert Einstein's:
"The unleashed power of the atom has changed everything
save our modes of thinking, and we thus drift toward unparal
leled catastrophe."
In a rare moment of silence, Hellman simply nodded.
