## EDITORIAL Pilot program increases privacy, efficiency in sexual assault cases 
### 
President John Hennessy recently ap
proved a new pilot program in Judicial
Affairs designed to increase privacy
and timeliness in sexual assault cases. The
program will be in effect from now until De
cember 2011, and the Board of Judicial Af
fairs will reconsider it that quarter. The cul
mination of a year of struggle to reform the
system for handling sexual assault cases has
indeed paid off. The Edit Board applauds Ju
dicial Affairs and President Hennessy for
making a proactive move to fix some of the
core problems in the sexual assault hearing
process.

Of the changes taking effect under the
new program, perhaps none is more impor
tant than the move toward private hearings
in which the alleged victim and the accused
will be separated. By moving away from
open hearings and into separate, private
hearings, the pilot program hopefully will
help close the gap between incidents report
ed and cases actually filed. The stark con
trast between the actual number of inci
dents on campus and those that go through
Judicial Affairs has been troubling in the
past years. By giving the alleged victim
greater privacy, while still allowing him or
her to submit questions for the accused, the
process of submitting a sexual assault case
may finally be cleansed of the atmosphere
of fear and confrontation that in the past
may have led many victims not to pursue
their cases.

The new process also expedites and
makes more efficient the role of Judicial Af
fairs. The hearings will involve a panel of four
members, all of whom will receive training in
the area in order to serve both the victims
and accused. Furthermore, the new 30-day
requirement for a case to be constructed will
ensure that justice comes without delay and
cannot be bogged down by bureaucracy. The
average time for a case to be completed in
the last year was 19 weeks a grueling and
painful stretch of time for the panel members
and, more importantly, for the victims, who
were forced to wait to have the conflict re
solved.

This new pilot program helps to meet stu
dents' demands for a more efficient and less
intimidating system for dealing with sexual
assault. As the pilot launches, the University
is poised to consider whether or not it should
be mandatory. The strongest argument for
mandating the use of private hearings is the
very real possibility that the accused may re
quest an open hearing simply to publicly em
barrass an alleged victim. The new program
takes leaps forward in promoting an environ
ment where victims feel more comfortable
and confident in seeking justice. With the
launch of this pilot program, the Editorial
Board urges that the new process be manda
tory so as to ensure that real victims of sexu
al assault are never dissuaded from seeking
justice due to fears of public exposure or a
prolonged ordeal.
