# GET IT RIGHT
## "Undocumented" sounds nice â€“ "Illegal" is accurate

Wall Street may enjoy a brief period of
respite from the role of perfidious
villain in the blame game propagat
ed by the President in the coming weeks. The
rules of this game are simple: assign culpabil
ity for the nation's problems to some arch
nemesis. Previously, the position of Public
Enemy No. 1 has been filled by President
Bush (what can't we blame on him), CIA in
terrogators (abusing helpless terrorists),
health care insurance providers (greedy
profit-seeking charlatans), Tea Partiers (rais
ing Cain by quoting the Constitution . ,\p>.
oh no!) and finally New York bankers (they
single-handedly brought down the highly
regulated "free" market. Ap>. oxymoron?).
However, the bankers may be able to contin
ue their nefarious activities while their regu
lators watch porn at the taxpayers' expense,
at least for a short while, as a new blackguard
threatens to wreak havoc on the greatness of
our nation.

Arizona governor Jan Brewer had the au
dacity last Friday to sign into law a bill that
reinforces federal illegal immigration laws.
Having heard hysterical cries of "racism" and
"apartheid" on the news waves, I decided to
investigate the new law in an attempt to deci
pher how, in Obamaspeak, it threatens to
"undermine basic notions of fairness that we
cherish as Americans."

The law prohibits Arizona officials from
limiting "the enforcement of federal immi
gration laws to less than the full extent per
mitted by federal law." It requires officials to
determine immigration status if there is suspi
cion of illegality. It makes illegal immigration
a state crime "(note: it is already a federal
crime). It prevents illegal immigrants from
working in Arizona. For the record, under
Title 8 Section 1325 of the U.S. Code, any citi
zen of any country who "(1) enters or at
tempts to enter the United States at any time
or place other than as designated by immigra
tion officers, or (2) eludes examination or in
spection by immigration officers, or (3) at
tempts to enter or obtains entry to the United
States by a willfully false or misleading repre
sentation or the willful concealment of a ma
terial fact" has committed a federal crime.
Given the existing federal statute, I won
der how exactly the "misguided" Arizona
governor (along with the 70 percent of the
"misguided" population that supported the
bill) is violating American "notions of fair
ness?" Outraged predictions of racial profil
ing fly in from the left as commentators like

Reverend A1 Sharpton boldly declare, "we
will bring freedom walkers to Arizona ... we
cannot sit by and allow people to be arbitrar
ily and unilaterally picked off as suspects be
cause of the color of their skin."

The race card has been played too many
times. As Arizona State Senator Russell
Pearce said, "illegal is not a race; it's a crime,"
Arizona shares a border with Mexico. Thus, it
is not surprising that the majority of illegal
border crossers are Mexican. Acknowledg
ing this fact, and suggesting that the laws of
our nation actually be enforced, is not a coor
dinated attack on people of Mexican her
itage. It is an attempt to protect the rights of
American citizens and legal immigrants.
According to Immigration Counters.com,
the money wired to Mexico since January of
2006 amounts to more than $28.9 billion.
There are approximately 22.7 million illegal
aliens in the country, who have incurred so
cial service costs of $397 billion since 1996.
How is that demonstrating "fairness" to the
American taxpayers providing these social
services?

Small wonder that Mexico is displeased
with the new law. The government of Mexico,
in a two-page statement, laments that "legis
lators that approved this bill and the Gover
nor of Arizona did not take into account the
valuable contributions of [illegal] immi
grants to the economy, society and culture of
Arizona and the United States."

Nobody is discounting the contributions
of immigrants to the nation. How is it unjust
to require that those who benefit from life in
America do so legally? How is it racist to sug
gest that protecting the rights of American
citizens trumps protecting non-citizens? It is
ridiculous to claim that anti-illegal immigra
tion laws are unconstitutional when, by defi
nition, illegal aliens are not protected by the
constitution.

Erica is equally displeased with illegal Canadian
immigrants. Commiserate? Emorganl@stan
