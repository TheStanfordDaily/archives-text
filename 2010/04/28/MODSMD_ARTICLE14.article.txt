# STRANGELY CHARMING
## The 						Science of Laughter 
### Jack Cackler 
If you were anywhere near campus this
weekend, you probably noticed around
1,500 extra bodies chirping around. This
year's crop of ProFros was the most compet
itive and will probably be the largest class
ever to attend Stanford, and their delighted
laughter could be heard all over campus.
Rather than spending the article wallowing
in nostalgia or attempting to leave pearls of
wisdom for future students, I'd instead like to
spend this time illuminating some recent sci
entific discoveries related to laughter. While
laughter has been around for years, there is
still much to be understood as to why it oc
curs, what its function is and how it affects
people. Believe it or not, researchers win
grants to study these questions, and their re
sults are no joke!
Laughter holds an elite status among
most forms of communication in that it not
only transcends culture, but also even tran
scends species. Many apes have exhibited
laughter, and a variety of other animals like
dogs, birds and even rats have exhibited be
havior that probably serves the same pur
pose. While facial expressions depicting envy
and desire are thought to be learned, babies
as young as two weeks old have laughed. Sci
ence has long understood that laughter caus
es the prefrontal cortex of the brain to re
lease endorphins, making a person feel
happy following something humorous. More
recent research has delved into the exact
mechanism by which this works.
Dr. William Fry, a Stanford researcher,
was in a group last year that published a
paper of the effects of laughter on the car
diovascular system. His group documented
an important pathway between laughter
and cardiovascular health, after noticing
that negative emotions were highly corre
lated with cardiac risk. The general struc
ture of the pathway is that laughing stimu
lates the release of beta endorphins in the
brain, which in turn bind with opiate recep
tors. These opiate receptors are commonly
expressed on the surface of most veins and
arteries in the body, and release nitric oxide
(surprisingly, not to be confused with laugh
ing gas, which is nitrous oxide), which relax
es and dilates blood vessels. America's num
ber one and three killers, heart attacks and
strokes, often result from blood clots, so

laughing daily, while not a panacea, could
literally save lives.
A study published out of Emerson Col
lege this January instead looked at the social
benefits of laughter. Dr. Phillip Glenn
combed through fifteen different job inter
views, and analyzed the social dynamics of
laughing. Glenn had read studies that had
shown that in most interactions between two
people, there is one person that initiates
laughter, and one that might laugh along, but
will generally not begin laughing unprompt

ed. Glenn theorized that people who initiate
laughter are in a position of social power. He
tested his hypothesis by reviewing record
ings of 15 job interviews for college seniors.
He found that when the interviewer laughed,
the interviewee would often laugh along, but
that the interviewees rarely initiate laughter.
Laughter was shown to be a tool to build rap
port, and interviewees who responded with
laughter appropriately were more success
ful.
Another study performed by Ihtsham
Haq from Wake Forest University printed in
March used laughter as a medicinal tool to
cure obsessive-compulsive disorder. Dr. Haq
performed a clinical study on six patients, all
of whom had had no success with drug or be
havioral therapy. Electrodes were physically
implanted into each subject's brain, to aid an
advanced medical procedure called Deep
Brain Stimulation. Dr. Haq determined what
regions of the brain could be stimulated to in
duce laughter, to which subjects reported
feeling euphoric for around thirty seconds.
The experiment was repeated several times
over the course of two years, and all but one
patient showed marked improvement. The
experiment was significant in that it identi
fied areas of the brain that induced laughter
(which differed from patient to patient) and
used laughter to treat a previously untreat
able condition. While Dr. Haq's team ac
knowledges that the limited sample size may
hinder full scientific inference, the study cer
tainly opens the door to an entirely new kind
of treatment that could be applied to a host
of problems.
It has been said for centuries that laughter
is the best medicine, and modern research is
proving that adage to be true. While it does
n't take a National Institutes of Health
(NIH) grant to know that laughing is enjoy
able, it's illuminating to know that the signif
icant benefits laughter can provide both to
health and social wellbeing are no laughing
matter. With that in mind, those who fill their
lives with laughter and joy really will get the
last laugh.

Jack makes no apologies for ending a thought
provoking scientific article with cheap puns.
