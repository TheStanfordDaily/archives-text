## STREAK SNAPPED 
### KABIR SAWHNEY DESK EDITOR 
After a hot streak that saw it win eight
straight games, including two consecutive
sweeps of Pac-10 opponents, the No. 18 Stan
ford baseball team finally saw its momentum

grind to a halt on Monday. Though the Cardi
nal offense had overpowered Cal over the
weekend, it sputtered against Santa Clara
(15-22), getting shut out for the first eight in
nings of the game. In a stunning upset, the
Broncos took the game 9-3. Stanford (21-14,
10-5 Pac-10) will now have a few days off be

fore starting a three-game set at Washington
on Friday.
Though Stanford was shut down offen
sively until the ninth inning, no single Bronco
pitcher receives the credit. Santa Clara used
seven pitchers in the game, none of whom
pitched more than two innings. Starter Brock
Simon gave up just one hit and one walk, with
one strikeout.
Every pitcher used by the Broncos proved
to be fairly successful against the Stanford
lineup. Six pitchers gave up no runs only
Jon Hughes, who pitched the seventh, eighth
and part of the ninth inning, gave up three
runs, after his team had already established a
9-0 lead.
With the exception of sophomore pinch
hitter Scott Colton, who drove a three-run
home run over the wall in the ninth in his first
at-bat of the game, Stanford's offense was
simply unable to string together any rallies.
Despite getting nine hits in the game, the Car
dinal's only RBls came on the Colton homer,
and the team left eight runners on base. Three
Stanford players did hit well, though without
any RBIs freshman right fielder Tyler
Gaffney and junior first baseman Jonathan
Kaskow, both of whom went 2-3, and fresh
man third baseman Kenny Diekroeger, who
went 2-4.
On the other side of the ball, seven Stan
ford pitchers also played in the game, al
though their innings were nowhere near as
evenly distributed as those of the Bronco
pitchers. Junior starter Danny Sandbrink,
after throwing five shutout innings, was
charged with three runs in the sixth inning
and left the game having recorded 5.0 innings
of work.
The succession of pitchers that followed
Sandbrink fared little better against the
Broncos offense, which piled on nine runs in
the sixth, seventh and eighth innings. Four

Snodgress and freshmen Chris Jenk
ins, Dean McArdle and Garrett
Hughes combined to give up six
runs in these innings. The last two
pitchers used, freshman Sahil
Bloom and sophomore Elliott
Byers, were able to stop the bleed

the Cardinal. Two errors were made

Diekroeger, his 10th of the season.
Santa Clara was led offensively
by right fielder Tommy Medica and
designated hitter Pat Stover. Medica
had three RBIs, including a home
run, while Stover's three RBIs came
on a bases-clearing triple.
