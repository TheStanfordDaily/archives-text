This past weekend, the Stanford
track and field team traveled to
Berkeley for the Brutus Hamilton
Invitational, an annual meet in the
Bay Area that attracts numerous ath
letes from several different areas.

The meet was split into an open
section and an invitational section.
Stanford athletes entered both sec
tions of the meet.

Sophomore Amaechi Morton set
the bar high for the weekend, surpris
ing everyone with an incredible per
formance in the open 200 meters.
Normally a hurdler and a 400-meter
runner, Morton placed second in the
200 with a time of 21.28 seconds, mov
ing into eighth on the Stanford all
time list.The time was a personal best
for Morton.

Most of the events were actually
held on day two of the meet. Leading
the way for the women was sopho
more Katerina Stefanidi, who took
the meet title in the pole vault with a
height of 13-9.25.
Junior Arantxa King also had a
good meet, jumping a season best
mark of 20-10.75 in the long jump.
"The meet went pretty well for
me," King said. "It was my second
time jumping for the season and it
was a slight improvement."
"I am happy that my jumps are be
coming more consistent in the high
20s, which was a major issue for me
indoor season," King added. "I think
I am in condition to jump well this
season so I'm excited for the upcom
ing meets where I ideally hope to
break the 21-foot mark."

The women's 4x400 relay team
finished the day with its fastest time
of the year, 3:42.68. The team consist-

Ed of freshman Hannah Farley, junior

a successful meet, running the eighth
fastest time in Stanford history,
3:09.41. The team consisted of senior

man, freshman Spencer Chase and
redshirt junior Mark Mueller.
"All of the guys on the 4x400 are
really excited about the way things
are coming together this year," Cole
man said. "There's an energy flowing
through our team that has been an es
sential part of all of our performanc
es as well as those achieved by others
throughout the year."
Mueller also competed in the invi
tational 200, placing third with a time
of 21.71 seconds.
