hicks dig the long

Greg Maddux joking
ly stated in a late 90s
Nike commercial, but
the sentiment holds true for more than
just women: fans love offense.
The designated hitter (DH), no doubt,
ensures year in and year out that Major
League Baseball's American League is
the more offensive of the two leagues. In
fact, last year American League (AL)
teams averaged nearly a half run (4.82 to
4.43) more a game than National League
(NL) teams, despite having arguably bet
ter pitchers (going off interleague statis
tics).
Pitching is entertaining, and good
pitching is beautiful, so the sheer fact that
there is more offense with the existence of
the designated hitter is not enough of a
reason to validate it. There are, however,
countless other reasons why the DH
makes baseball better.
The existence of the DH allows players
to have longer careers and it allows pitch
ers to focus on their primary job pitch
ing.
Many baseball greats have ended their
careers as DHs. Would Ken Griffey, Jr. or
Jim Thome still be playing today without
the DH? Probably not, yet we all relish
watching them hit. Would baseball fans
have ever enjoyed the likes of Paul Moli
tor or Edgar Martinez if there was a DH?
Again, probably not.
So DHs only have to do half of the
game, you might say. But really, even in the
National League where pitchers hit, those
pitchers still focus almost all of their atten
tion on pitching, not hitting, and watching
them hit can often times be quite embar
rassing. Having the DH allows pitchers to
do what they do best, and hitters to do
what they do best.
Furthermore, the DH helps prevent
pitchers from getting hurt. Take Chien-
Ming Wang for example. While pitching
for the New York Yankees in 2008, Wang
was injured running the bases in an inter
league game at Houston. His once prom
ising career has never been the same
since.
Enemies of the DH often say that the
American League doesn't play real base
ball. TJie trouble with that argument is that
most every baseball league in the world
thinks the DH is a good idea. High school
baseball has a DH, as do college baseball
and basically all other amateur leagues, and
almost every international baseball league
and baseball tournament uses the DH.The
only league in the world outside of the Na
tional League that has not adopted the DH
is the Japanese Central League, one of
Japan's two leagues, and much like the
NL, there is a DH used in interleague
games played at Japanese Pacific
League stadiums.
Another argument made about
the DH is that it was contrived and
was not part of what baseball origi
nally was. That is a ridiculous claim
because, like all sports, baseball's
rules have evolved over the years.

Baseball's evolution has continu
ally been in favor of the batter. In
1920, doctoring of the baseball was
banned to help hitters. Later on, the
height of the mound was lowered and
the DH was added. Nobody com
plains about the first two, much as
basketball enthusiasts rarely lament
about the addition of the three-point
line and football fans don't whine
much about the forward pass being
added. Why is the DH any different?
It is simply part of the evolution of
baseball.
The DH was introduced in 1973 by
the AL as a result of pitching dominat
ing baseball and attendance being

down. As planned, offense increased in
the AL, and subsequently so did atten
dance and revenue. As a strictly busi
ness decision, the DH is a no brainer.

None of this is to say that the NL
should adopt the DH too. In fact,
there is something nice about the
slight difference between the game in
the AL and NL, and it makes inter
league play and the World Series even
more exciting. That said, it would be
foolish to say that the DH is bad for
baseball, and even more foolish for
the AL to get rid of it.
