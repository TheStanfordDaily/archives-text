# DH takes strategy, intrigue out of the game
## 
### Mike Lazarus 
There are two things every man
thinks he can do better than
every other man grill a ham
burger and manage a baseball
team.
Think about it. How many times have
you leaned over your buddy's shoulder to
give him unsolicited advice as he grills?
Yeah, make sure you don't flip it too many
times. Don't want to lose any of the juice. You
going to put the cheese on now? I mean, it's
your call, but I think you got at least another
few minutes.
How many times have you yelled at
your TV in frustration for an apparent, id
iotic coaching decision? Why are we
throwing it on fourth-and-one? Don't take
him out now, he's barely over 100 pitches.
You call a timeout and that's the play you
draw up, really?
What does this all have to do with why
the designated hitter is bad for baseball?
The reason why we are so overconfi
dent in our ability to grill a burger and man
age a ball team is that both require simple
decisions that produce immediate, tangible
results. I told you that burger was going to
burn. I knew you should have pulled that
pitcher, everyone saw the home run coming.
Hindsight is always going to be 20/20, so
we believe we would have made the right
decision had we been in charge. The prob
lem with the designated hitter (DH) is that
it eliminates nearly every possible manage
rial decision, detracting from the overall ex
perience of watching a baseball game.
In eveiy game, the biggest decision a
manager will make is when to take the start
ing pitcher out of the game. Factors like the
pitcher's performance and the score affect
the decision, but often that decision is dictat
ed solely on where the team is in its lineup.
If the pitcher's spot comes up in a big mo
ment in the game, the manager must choose
between trying to score now or let his pitch
er keep throwing well.
My colleague Mr. Bohm will almost as
suredly argue that the DH allows the best of
both worlds give a real hitter a chance
and leave the pitcher in the game,
Where's the intrigue in that? Where's
the in-game suspense? If you pull him, you
then worry about your bullpen, trying to
exploit the best matchup, while making
sure you have pitchers left if the game goes
extra innings. The NL has more variables to
consider.
An AL manager simply trots out his nine
best hitters and waits for something to hap
pen. An NL manager must find ways to
manufacture offense around his pitcher, be
they sacrifice bunts, hit-and-runs or suicide
squeezes.
And with each decision, there's going to
be immediate backlash by fans. That's
why we watch the game. We don't
want to walk away saying, "Man, our
nine best guys just didn't have it com
pared to their best nine."
We want to believe something
other than pure talent can win a game.
That strategy and game plans can
overcome a skill deficit. Otherwise,
there would be no Davids, only Go
liaths.

Yes, there is a laundry list of other
reasons why the DH should be
banned. It takes away from the tradi
tion of the game. It adds too much of
fense. It creates a dissymmetry be
tween the leagues. It violates the fun
damental rule of baseball that each
team has nine players who play the
field and hit.

Ultimately, the biggest criticism to
the DH remains the fact that it dumbs
down baseball, removing strategy, de
cisions and matchups that make base
ball so fun, not just to watch, but to talk
about years later.
Kirk Gibson's pinch-hit walk-off
home run in the 1988 World Series, ar
guably the most famous play in the his
tory of baseball? Never would have
happened if the NL had a DH.
Baseball is a thinking man's game.
The winner is not the team who can sit
back and launch the most home runs.
The winner is the team that most effec
tively utilizes its 25-man roster to score
more runs than the opponent.
