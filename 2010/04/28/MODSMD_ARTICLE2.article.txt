## Chief: alert on Sunday was 'wise' Gun threat was credible; police did not find suspects 
### ELIZABETH TITUS MANAGING EDITOR 
Stanford Department of Public
Safety Chief Laura Wilson offered
an explanation this week for the text
message students got early Sunday
morning alerting them that, after an
alleged car burglary on campus an
hour and 48 minutes earlier, two sus
pects with a gun may still have been
on campus.
Wilson said the Clery Act, a fed
eral law requiring colleges and uni
versities to make timely warnings to
the community of specific ongoing
criminal threats, prompted the de
partment to send the alert on Sun
day.
The text message came in the
chilly dark of Sunday, hours after
Admit Weekend had ended, at 1:41
a.m. in all capital letters: "AlertSU:
Auto burglary near Roble @
12:09 AM. Two male suspects.
Firearm seen. More info to be posted
soon at police.stanford.edu."
Wilson said that the department's
decision to call it an "ongoing
threat" was a "judgment call."
"When the police learned that the
reporting party had observed a
firearm and was confident in his ob
servation, we thought it was prudent
to notify the student community
about the incident because we know
that many of our students are still ac
tive in the early morning hours, espe
cially on the weekends," Wilson
wrote in an e-mail to The Daily.
After two hours of searching, and
despite "several" tips in response to
the text message, police officers
never located the suspects, who were
reported by a student and left in a
darkly colored Honda Accord or
Civic, Wilson said.
No information was ever posted
to the department's website about
the incident.

in the text... is where to go to ob
tain more information," said Wilson,
who would only communicate by e
mail with The Daily, on Tuesday. "No
additional information has been
posted to the webpage because there
really isn't much more to add."
The department sent an e-mail to
the "greater population" of faculty,
staff and students 22 minutes after
the text message with a synopsis of
the burglary and a description of the
suspects.

It said a student had verbally con
fronted two suspects in the Roble
parking lot who had allegedly bro
ken into the student's vehicle.

"After conducting a search of the
area for the suspects, police learned
from the student that he had seen the
barrel of a silver firearm in the pock
et of the sweatshirt of suspect #l,"

the e-mail read.
It encouraged readers to call 911
or the non-emergency police line
with information.
Wilson said the department de
cided to text students, rather than
call them, to avoid waking students
who were sleeping "and thus unlike
ly to encounter the suspects."
She said the department thought
it "wise" to notify faculty and staff,
who were contacted by e-mail.
Asked how the department de
termines when a warning is timely,
Wilson said "it is situationally de
pendent . . sending a text message
long after the threat is thought to
have passed defeats the intended
purpose of sending the text."
The AlertSU system was born in
April 2008, when Stanford contract
ed with Blackboard Connect Inc. to
deliver mass notifications "in the
event of a major emergency on cam
pus," the University said at the time.
The Department of Public Safety
and several top administrators have
authority to use the system.

Wilson acknowledged that fre
quent use could diminish the sys
tem's effectiveness. It is tested twice
a year and was last used to notify
people of a power outage on campus
on Jan. 19.
She said the University is consid
ering creating a tiered system of
alerts that would indicate different
threat levels.
"The bottom line is that there will
be a continual balancing act and peo
ple will have their own opinions
about what should and should not be
conveyed and through what mecha
nism," Wilson said.
"Here's the question I ask myself
when trying to evaluate all the po
tential outcomes," she added. '"lf we
do not send an alert and someone's
hurt, would a reasonable person
think that the decision was sound?"'
