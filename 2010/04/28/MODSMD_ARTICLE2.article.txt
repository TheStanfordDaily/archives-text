## Chief: alert on Sunday was 'wise' Gun threat was credible; police did not find suspects 
### ELIZABETH TITUS MANAGING EDITOR 
Stanford Department of Public
Safety Chief Laura Wilson offered
an explanation this week for the text
message students got early Sunday
morning alerting them that, after an
alleged car burglary on campus an
hour and 48 minutes earlier, two sus
pects with a gun may still have been
on campus.
Wilson said the Clery Act, a fed
eral law requiring colleges and uni
versities to make timely warnings to
the community of specific ongoing
criminal threats, prompted the de
partment to send the alert on Sun
day.
The text message came in the
chilly dark of Sunday, hours after
Admit Weekend had ended, at 1:41
a.m. in all capital letters: "AlertSU:
Auto burglary near Roble @
12:09 AM. Two male suspects.
Firearm seen. More info to be posted
soon at police.stanford.edu."
Wilson said that the department's
decision to call it an "ongoing
threat" was a "judgment call."
"When the police learned that the
reporting party had observed a
firearm and was confident in his ob
servation, we thought it was prudent
to notify the student community
about the incident because we know
that many of our students are still ac
tive in the early morning hours, espe
cially on the weekends," Wilson
wrote in an e-mail to The Daily.
After two hours of searching, and
despite "several" tips in response to
the text message, police officers
never located the suspects, who were
reported by a student and left in a
darkly colored Honda Accord or
Civic, Wilson said.
No information was ever posted
to the department's website about
the incident.
