# Printing on the cheap?
## ResComp is watching, but fallout is unclear 
### PHILLIP KLIMKE 
In an effort to combat abuse of
the printing system in dorms, Resi
dential Computing (ResComp) may
be moving to revamp the system and
crack down on the most serious of
fenders.

Designed to give students the
benefit of the doubt when it comes
to canceling print jobs, the printing
system in Stanford dorm computer
clusters does not charge the usual 10
cents for pages that have already

been printed when a job is canceled.
This, however, allows students to by
pass the charge altogether by termi
nating print jobs moments before
they complete.

After several Residential Com
puting Consultants (RCCs) report
ed incidences of abuse, ResComp
has identified a number of individu
als who routinely cancel print jobs in
away that suggests they are system
atically avoiding charges.
In the month of March, one stu
dent canceled 52 print jobs and an

other six students canceled more
than twenty print jobs each, accord
ing to Surajit Bose, the head of Aca
demic Computing Technology Ser
vices.

ResComp can identify users by
their SUNet ID.

Some of these students have
been reported to their respective
residence deans, Bose said. But on
behalf of ResComp, he declined to
name which dorms are affected and
what consequences students face,
saying that "at this point, we believe

the matter is better handled inter
nally out of respect for the stu
dents."

In order to close the loophole,
ResComp has decided to introduce
changes to the technical structure of
Stanford's printing system, accord
ing to Bose.

ResComp is faced with two op
tions: the system could be config
ured to charge for each page as it
prints or for the entire print job as
soon as it is released to the printer.
The latter option, while easier to im

plement technically, would lead to
additional overhead costs because
ResComp would be required to re
fund erroneous print jobs.
ResComp has not yet decided on
one specific system and is still work
ing on a concrete timetable for im
plementation.

In the meantime, Bose said,
ResComp will continue to report seri
ous offenders to resident fellows and
residence deans and is also consider
