## Senate rejects bill to cut exec pay Lame ducks eye ethics reform work before likely May transition 
### ZOE RICHARDS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The ASSU Undergraduate Senate was
scheduled to approve the association's
operating budget for the upcoming year,
but put on the brakes when an amend
ment to reduce executive salaries was
proposed in the name of fiscal responsi
bility.
Administration & Rules Chair Alex
Katz 'l2 offered two alternate amend
ments proposing to cut either $3,000 or
$1,500 from each of the executives'
salaries, which would leave them with ei
ther $7OOO or $8,500 each for the entire
year, including summer expenses for on
campus housing. Katz invoked a familiar
rhetoric, used in an attempt to cut Senate
salaries earlier this year, about the con
tradictory nature of what he considered
high salaries.
"We're being a little hypocritical in

the way that we're paying executives and
elected officials to such a high extent and
then paying even a basic VSO [voluntary
student organization] leader nothing,"
Katz said.
According to Katz, that money could
be better spent by adding it to the execu
tive discretionary to be spent on a large
campus-wide event, or could be pooled
for VSOs whose officers have com
plained about reduced funding.
Senate Chair Varun Sivaram 'll said
he would reject the amendment, particu
larly because he could not see a better use
of the money to be siphoned off from
salaries. He challenged Katz on the utility
of the amendment by criticizing what he
saw as a "nebulous zone" for alternative
uses of the money Katz was adamant to
reappropriate.
The current combined executive
salaries are $20,000, with a projected
$lO,OOO to be paid out to the president
and vice president respectively. Each is
anticipated to need at least $3,000 for
summer housing while they map out the
year ahead.
Katz argued that executive compensa

tion seems an anomaly not practiced by a
number of other universities he re
searched.
Many senators were left questioning
what seemed to them an "arbitrary" ad
justment, as Sivaram.
"Stanford offers the unique opportu
nity for student of any financial back
ground to have access to the executive
position because they don't have to relin
quish the time commitment to working
another job that might pay significantly
better," Sivaram said, adding that such an
amendment could limit the ability for
some students to apply and fulfill execu
tive duties.
The discussion struck a more emotion
al tenor when senator and newly elected
ASSU Vice President Kelsei Wharton 'l2
asked the group to consider a more
grounded and personal approach to the
legislation.
"Right now we're talking about it
very theoretically," Wharton said,
adding, "We need to get some money in
