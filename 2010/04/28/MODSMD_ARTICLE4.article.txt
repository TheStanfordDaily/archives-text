## Senate rejects bill to cut exec pay Lame ducks eye ethics reform work before likely May transition 
### ZOE RICHARDS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The ASSU Undergraduate Senate was
scheduled to approve the association's
operating budget for the upcoming year,
but put on the brakes when an amend
ment to reduce executive salaries was
proposed in the name of fiscal responsi
bility.
Administration & Rules Chair Alex
Katz 'l2 offered two alternate amend
ments proposing to cut either $3,000 or
$1,500 from each of the executives'
salaries, which would leave them with ei
ther $7OOO or $8,500 each for the entire
year, including summer expenses for on
campus housing. Katz invoked a familiar
rhetoric, used in an attempt to cut Senate
salaries earlier this year, about the con
tradictory nature of what he considered
high salaries.
"We're being a little hypocritical in

the way that we're paying executives and
elected officials to such a high extent and
then paying even a basic VSO [voluntary
student organization] leader nothing,"
Katz said.
According to Katz, that money could
be better spent by adding it to the execu
tive discretionary to be spent on a large
campus-wide event, or could be pooled
for VSOs whose officers have com
plained about reduced funding.
Senate Chair Varun Sivaram 'll said
he would reject the amendment, particu
larly because he could not see a better use
of the money to be siphoned off from
salaries. He challenged Katz on the utility
of the amendment by criticizing what he
saw as a "nebulous zone" for alternative
uses of the money Katz was adamant to
reappropriate.
The current combined executive
salaries are $20,000, with a projected
$lO,OOO to be paid out to the president
and vice president respectively. Each is
anticipated to need at least $3,000 for
summer housing while they map out the
year ahead.
Katz argued that executive compensa

tion seems an anomaly not practiced by a
number of other universities he re
searched.
Many senators were left questioning
what seemed to them an "arbitrary" ad
justment, as Sivaram.
"Stanford offers the unique opportu
nity for student of any financial back
ground to have access to the executive
position because they don't have to relin
quish the time commitment to working
another job that might pay significantly
better," Sivaram said, adding that such an
amendment could limit the ability for
some students to apply and fulfill execu
tive duties.
The discussion struck a more emotion
al tenor when senator and newly elected
ASSU Vice President Kelsei Wharton 'l2
asked the group to consider a more
grounded and personal approach to the
legislation.
"Right now we're talking about it
very theoretically," Wharton said,
adding, "We need to get some money in

our pocket just in case something
comes up and things do come up,
as they have been in the past few
weeks for me."

ASSU Financial Manager Matt
McLaughlin 'OB registered his
wholehearted disagreement with the
amendment, rejecting the roster of
arguments made in favor of the re
duction as "asinine." Fie contested
economic reasons for keeping the
salaries at status quo.
Katz shot back that McLaughlin's
"bang for the buck approach" had
less relevance for the Senate. "The
business approach has less of a place
here in a volunteer type of organiza
tion, a service organization," he ar
gued, suggesting that executives
would be no less likely to fulfill their
duties at a high caliber with a pay cut.
After much debate, and a litmus
test for approval of his amendment,
Katz withdrew his recommendation
that executive salaries be reduced by
29 percent, allowing the body to vote
only on an amendment that would
collectively reduce joint salaries by
$3,000.

The amendment was rejected in a
7-1 vote, Katz standing alone in sup
port of legislation in line with a num
ber of bills he has proposed this year
in the name of a more fiscally conser
vative Senate.

Senate to Move on Ethical Oversight
Bill?

The Senate also discussed a bill
authored by Shelley Gao 'll regard
ing ethical conduct oversight that
would legislate the appointment of
an independent auditor responsible
for conducting "objective investiga
tions" and queries about the way the
Senate spends its money.
The specific duties, compensation
and manner of appointment remain
questions to be considered in up
coming meetings, but ensuring that
the Senate is held responsible for its
actions fiscally and ethically would
be among the foremost thrusts of
such an initiative, Gao said.
ASSU President Angelina Car
dona 'll suggested the possibility of
reinstalling judicial advocates to
oversee and bring to the attention of
the Constitutional Council any ethi
cally compromising acts.

The Senate seemed in relative
agreement that what Ryan Peacock
'lO called a "moral watchdog" is
needed for added transparency.

Moving Toward Decisive Transition

In an effort to bind the Senate to
a clear and expedient dissolution
time frame, Communications Chair
Lee Jackson 'l2 proposed that the
current Senate bid its final adieu
after its May 11 meeting. With some
resistance from senators commit
ted to finishing up the Green
Events Checklist and other legisla
tive loose ends, the body is likely to
vote on the bill to dissolve next
week.

With the introduction of a "tra
ditions" fund, created explicitly to
provide backup funding for under
funded traditions under threat of
disappearing, Appropriations
Chair Anton Zietsman 'l2 also sug
gested that the Senate perhaps cut
back on some of its policy limita
tions to allow student groups to use
this fund to initiate pilot projects.
The stipulations and oversight of
such a fund and its uses will be fur
ther discussed as the Senate consid
ers significant policy overhauls and
reforms for next year.

All seven Nominations Commis
sion appointees were also unani
mously approved alongside the
week's funding bills.
