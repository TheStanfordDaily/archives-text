## Granada hadn't had a peeper 'yet;' now, precautions With new key access, dorm reviews security in third shower-peeping incident of year 
### KATE ABBOTT DESK EDITOR 
In response to a peeping torn incident Sunday morning
in a West Lagunita residence bathroom, Student Housing
has installed a new shower key system there to prevent un
wanted people from entering bathrooms a type of inci
dent already reported at least twice earlier this academic
year.
A female Granada resident reported a male intruder
peeking under a divider while she was showering on Sun
day; she said he ran away after the student screamed. Police
arrived on scene three minutes after receiving a call, but did
not catch the alleged peeper.
Similar intrusions were reported in both Robinson and
Branner during fall quarter, prompting police reports and
chatter across dorm lists.
"Whenever anything like this happens, people are a little
jumpy for a few days," said Marvin Diogenes '77, the Resi
dent Fellow (RF) for West Lag.
"There was an immediate call to the police department,
which I think is the appropriate response when anything
like this happens in a dorm, and the police were on sight
within a matter of minutes," he added.
