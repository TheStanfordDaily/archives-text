## Granada hadn't had a peeper 'yet;' now, precautions With new key access, dorm reviews security in third shower-peeping incident of year 
### KATE ABBOTT DESK EDITOR 
In response to a peeping torn incident Sunday morning
in a West Lagunita residence bathroom, Student Housing
has installed a new shower key system there to prevent un
wanted people from entering bathrooms a type of inci
dent already reported at least twice earlier this academic
year.
A female Granada resident reported a male intruder
peeking under a divider while she was showering on Sun
day; she said he ran away after the student screamed. Police
arrived on scene three minutes after receiving a call, but did
not catch the alleged peeper.
Similar intrusions were reported in both Robinson and
Branner during fall quarter, prompting police reports and
chatter across dorm lists.
"Whenever anything like this happens, people are a little
jumpy for a few days," said Marvin Diogenes '77, the Resi
dent Fellow (RF) for West Lag.
"There was an immediate call to the police department,
which I think is the appropriate response when anything
like this happens in a dorm, and the police were on sight
within a matter of minutes," he added.
Installing the shower key system is
not the only physical precaution
dorms have taken in response to un
wanted visitors.
According to Branner Resident
Assistant (RA) Viral Shah 'll, staff
there kept more doors locked after
that dorm's peeping torn incident in
November, and police responded to
reports of intruders in both Branner
and Robinson.
"We walked through the door and
tested all doors granting access to the
dorm," Shah wrote in an e-mail to The
Daily. "We decided to lock two addi
tional doors that we previously had
unlocked ... while this has been an
inconvenience to our residents re
turning from meals, we feel that the
added security is well worth it."
Shah believes the intruder gained
access to the building by posing as a
pizza delivery person.
Branner RF Clyde Moneyhun said
reminding residents to be aware of
their surroundings constantly is the
major precaution he has taken.
"I think such incidents may be in
evitable, as rigorously as we guard
against them," he wrote in an e-mail to
The Daily. "On a college campus, it's
fairly easy to find an open door, easy

to find people to annoy or harass, easy
to find expensive stuff to steal."
"I do think the campus is very safe,
but it only takes one incident to cause
a lot of uneasiness," Moneyhun
added.
Courtney Spens 'l3, a resident in
four-class Granada, was not in the
dorm the morning of the incident, but
thought it was handled efficiently be
cause locks were installed within 24
hours.
"A lot of people were really wor
ried about it especially the girls
because we've heard of a bunch of
break-ins elsewhere, but it hadn't hap
pened to us yet," Spens said.
Spens said she thought it was un
likely the intruder was allowed inside
or followed a resident into the dorm,
but probably entered through a
breezeway that is usually kept un
locked.
According to Diogenes, communi
cation continued with the Stanford
Department of Public Safety (DPS)
throughout Sunday, but there are no
new developments regarding the sus
pect, who fled. Moneyhun said that
the Branner intruder was not found
either, "but we didn't have another in
cident with him."
Bill Larson, the DPS public infor
mation officer, declined to comment
about Sunday's incident.
