The faces of students in the Alondra
lounge are briefly illuminated by the
black-and-white scenes of The Seventh
Seal flashing across the screen. In an icon
ic scene, the hooded figure of Death has
come for Block in his Swedish hometown, challeng
ing him to a game of chess.

When Ingmar Bergman's classic film eventually
flickers to a close, Greg Watkins 'B5, resident fellow
of East Florence Moore and coordinator of the
Structured Liberal Education program (SLE), gets
up from his seat in the back of the room. He launch
es into a discussion of religious imagery all before
he has even reached the front of the classroom.

As he discusses Bergman's technique, Watkins
speaks with an authoritative calm a heavy
thoughtfulness that is visible in his eyes. When he
gestures, the periphery of a tattoo a black scroll
like Rumi symbol on his upper arm peeks out
from beneath the sleeve of his colored shirt. This is a
man who clearly knows his stuff.
About 30 years ago, Watkins was himself a fresh
man in SLE, Stanford's intensive liberal arts, resi
dential learning experience, sitting in the same seats
as these students and intrigued by Bergman's
cinematic genius. He had been a film buff, attending
Stanford's weekly classic film series "Great Direc
tors, Great Films" that was projected in Cubberley
every Tuesday. Having grown up in a rather isolated
"farm town" in Idaho, he felt that these films radical
ly altered his perception of the world. He had no
idea of how dramatically Bergman's film would
alter his life.

In 1985, Watkins was in his senior year at Stan
ford. He was uncertain of his plans after graduation,
but one day, that uncertainty vanished after a con
versation with the Boise photographer who was tak
ing Watkins' senior portrait.

"He was taking my picture, and he said to me,'So,
you're a senior what are you going to do?"' And
I said, 'l'm going to apply to law school.' And he
started giving me a hard time, like, 'Oh great, the
world needs more lawyers. That's a wonderful
choice,"'Watkins said.

"So I wasn't sure how to take all this," he contin
ued. "And he's snapping away, and he said, 'Let me
ask you a question. If you could look at your life 20
years from now and consider it a success, what would
you have done?"'

One thing came immediately to Watkins' mind.
"I would've made a film as great as a Bergman
film," he responded. "And [the photographer] said,
'Well that's what you should do.'"

Watkins graduated from Stanford in 1985 with a
B.A. in Social Theory, a self-designed major. But the
exchange with the photographer prompted the
"year of confusion" when Watkins decided he would
take the riskier road and see if he could become a
filmmaker.

After taking a year off, Watkins pursued his pas
sion at UCLA, where he spent the next seven years
completing an MFA in film production.
Filmmaking was a vastly different field at the
time Watkins went to graduate school. Laptops and
programs like iMovie weren't accessible yet, so a
formal film education was the only way to get access
to specialized equipment and the training it re
quired.

As a film student in UCLA, Watkins produced
his first feature-length film with a friend, Caveh Za
hedi, who was also in the program. He explained
that he and Zahedi were having trouble coming up
with an idea for the film. At the time, Zahedi had
fallen madly in love with an art student, who worked
in the building next door, and who also had a
boyfriend.

"It suddenly occurred to us that we should film
the story of that infatuation, but use the people in
volved," Watkins said.

So the co-director played himself, the girlfriend
played herself and the boyfriend, even though he
had since broken up with the art student, agreed to
play himself. It was an intimate project; all of the
scenes were reenactments of real events, and
Watkins and his co-director did all of the writing,
filming and sound effects themselves. His first film,
A Little Stiff, made it to the Sundance festival in
1991.

But Watkins' focus wasn't solely confined to cap
turing romance on screen. It was while he was a stu
dent in Los Angeles that he met his wife-to-be at

Mom's, an Los Angeles bar.
"Obviously he was this awesome, nice guy that I
kind of liked," Watkins' wife Susan beamed. "He
was an interesting guy doing interesting things, and I
was kind of a boring engineer."
When Watkins moved back to the Bay Area in
1991, his passion for film ultimately reconnected his
life to Stanford, where Watkins began lecturing and
teaching film in SLE, the very program that first ex
posed him to Bergman's classic.
"SLE raised basic meaning of life questions,"
Watkins said. "I just love thinking about those big
questions."

When he began to see his job as his a career, he
knew he would need to get a Ph.D. He decided to
pursue a joint doctorate in religious Studies and hu
manities at Stanford out of his interest in philoso
phy. When he graduated, there was an available po
sition in SLE and the possibility of being an RF
Watkins filled both.

Watkins is currently approaching his seventh
year of being the RF of East Florence Moore Hall
with his wife, Susan, and two daughters. Over the
same time period, he has also been a lecturer in the
Humanities and is now co-coordinator of the SLE
program. He continues to weave film into his career.
Jeremy Sabol, a SLE fellow currently working
with Watkins on a film titled This is Hamlet, ex
plained that the RF has a special presence in the
SLE program.
"Greg really understands why SLE is residential,
and he incorporates residential life into the dorm in
away that none of us can do," Sabol said.
"These days Greg is the heart of SLE," Sabol
added.
As a SLE discussion leader, Watkins is known for
being patient, calm and for emphasizing that learn
ing should be fun and something to appreciate.
Emily Mitchell 'l3, a student now in Watkins'
spring discussion section, described the impact
Watkins has had on her freshman year.
"I switched to SLE from IHUM the second week
of school," Mitchell explained. "I sat in on his section
... it was because of him that I decided to do SLE,
and that's probably the best decision I have made at
Stanford."
Although it's hard to be an academic and film
maker he has two other directing titles under his
belt, A Sign from God and This is Macßeth
Watkins is balancing both. He is currently working
on several projects, on subjects from Sartre to Ham
let, and has partially-finished scripts in the works.
Although Watkins' return to SLE was a cir
cuitous one, the program that helped him define his
passion was and continues to be a defining aspect of
his life.
"I've never been sure of what's more than a year
down the road," Watkins said. "I certainly love being
here right now ... and it's hard to imagine not being
here in the future."

ing Watkins' senior portrait.

"He was taking my picture, and he said to me,'So,
you're a senior what are you going to do?"' And
I said, 'l'm going to apply to law school.' And he
started giving me a hard time, like, 'Oh great, the
world needs more lawyers. That's a wonderful
choice,"'Watkins said.

"So I wasn't sure how to take all this," he contin
ued. "And he's snapping away, and he said, 'Let me
ask you a question. If you could look at your life 20
years from now and consider it a success, what would
you have done?"'

One thing came immediately to Watkins' mind.
"I would've made a film as great as a Bergman
film," he responded. "And [the photographer] said,
'Well that's what you should do.'"

Watkins graduated from Stanford in 1985 with a
B.A. in Social Theory, a self-designed major. But the
exchange with the photographer prompted the
"year of confusion" when Watkins decided he would
take the riskier road and see if he could become a
filmmaker.

After taking a year off, Watkins pursued his pas
sion at UCLA, where he spent the next seven years
completing an MFA in film production.
Filmmaking was a vastly different field at the
time Watkins went to graduate school. Laptops and
programs like iMovie weren't accessible yet, so a
formal film education was the only way to get access
to specialized equipment and the training it re
quired.

As a film student in UCLA, Watkins produced
his first feature-length film with a friend, Caveh Za
hedi, who was also in the program. He explained
that he and Zahedi were having trouble coming up
with an idea for the film. At the time, Zahedi had
fallen madly in love with an art student, who worked
in the building next door, and who also had a
boyfriend.

"It suddenly occurred to us that we should film
the story of that infatuation, but use the people in
volved," Watkins said.

So the co-director played himself, the girlfriend
played herself and the boyfriend, even though he
had since broken up with the art student, agreed to
play himself. It was an intimate project; all of the
scenes were reenactments of real events, and
Watkins and his co-director did all of the writing,
filming and sound effects themselves. His first film,
A Little Stiff, made it to the Sundance festival in
1991.

But Watkins' focus wasn't solely confined to cap
turing romance on screen. It was while he was a stu
dent in Los Angeles that he met his wife-to-be at

Mom's, an Los Angeles bar.
"Obviously he was this awesome, nice guy that I
kind of liked," Watkins' wife Susan beamed. "He
was an interesting guy doing interesting things, and I
was kind of a boring engineer."
When Watkins moved back to the Bay Area in
1991, his passion for film ultimately reconnected his
life to Stanford, where Watkins began lecturing and
teaching film in SLE, the very program that first ex
posed him to Bergman's classic.
"SLE raised basic meaning of life questions,"
Watkins said. "I just love thinking about those big
questions."

When he began to see his job as his a career, he
knew he would need to get a Ph.D. He decided to
pursue a joint doctorate in religious Studies and hu
manities at Stanford out of his interest in philoso
phy. When he graduated, there was an available po
sition in SLE and the possibility of being an RF
Watkins filled both.

Watkins is currently approaching his seventh
year of being the RF of East Florence Moore Hall
with his wife, Susan, and two daughters. Over the
same time period, he has also been a lecturer in the
Humanities and is now co-coordinator of the SLE
program. He continues to weave film into his career.
Jeremy Sabol, a SLE fellow currently working
with Watkins on a film titled This is Hamlet, ex
plained that the RF has a special presence in the
SLE program.
"Greg really understands why SLE is residential,
and he incorporates residential life into the dorm in
away that none of us can do," Sabol said.
"These days Greg is the heart of SLE," Sabol
added.
As a SLE discussion leader, Watkins is known for
being patient, calm and for emphasizing that learn
ing should be fun and something to appreciate.
Emily Mitchell 'l3, a student now in Watkins'
spring discussion section, described the impact
Watkins has had on her freshman year.
"I switched to SLE from IHUM the second week
of school," Mitchell explained. "I sat in on his section
... it was because of him that I decided to do SLE,
and that's probably the best decision I have made at
Stanford."
Although it's hard to be an academic and film
maker he has two other directing titles under his
belt, A Sign from God and This is Macßeth
Watkins is balancing both. He is currently working
on several projects, on subjects from Sartre to Ham
let, and has partially-finished scripts in the works.
Although Watkins' return to SLE was a cir
cuitous one, the program that helped him define his
passion was and continues to be a defining aspect of
his life.
"I've never been sure of what's more than a year
down the road," Watkins said. "I certainly love being
here right now ... and it's hard to imagine not being
here in the future."

The faces of students in the Alondra
lounge are briefly illuminated by the
black-and-white scenes of The Seventh
Seal flashing across the screen. In an icon
ic scene, the hooded figure of Death has
come for Block in his Swedish hometown, challeng
ing him to a game of chess.

When Ingmar Bergman's classic film eventually
flickers to a close, Greg Watkins 'B5, resident fellow
of East Florence Moore and coordinator of the
Structured Liberal Education program (SLE), gets
up from his seat in the back of the room. He launch
es into a discussion of religious imagery all before
he has even reached the front of the classroom.

As he discusses Bergman's technique, Watkins
speaks with an authoritative calm a heavy
thoughtfulness that is visible in his eyes. When he
gestures, the periphery of a tattoo a black scroll
like Rumi symbol on his upper arm peeks out
from beneath the sleeve of his colored shirt. This is a
man who clearly knows his stuff.
About 30 years ago, Watkins was himself a fresh
man in SLE, Stanford's intensive liberal arts, resi
dential learning experience, sitting in the same seats
as these students and intrigued by Bergman's
cinematic genius. He had been a film buff, attending
Stanford's weekly classic film series "Great Direc
tors, Great Films" that was projected in Cubberley
every Tuesday. Having grown up in a rather isolated
"farm town" in Idaho, he felt that these films radical
ly altered his perception of the world. He had no
idea of how dramatically Bergman's film would
alter his life.

In 1985, Watkins was in his senior year at Stan
ford. He was uncertain of his plans after graduation,
but one day, that uncertainty vanished after a con
versation with the Boise photographer who was tak
ing Watkins' senior portrait.

"He was taking my picture, and he said to me,'So,
you're a senior what are you going to do?"' And
