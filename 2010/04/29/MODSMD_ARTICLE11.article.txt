## Faculty, staff explore wellness 
### KABIR SAWHNEY DESK EDITOR 
Part of a push toward "wellness" for
Stanford faculty and staff that often
goes unseen by students, Wednesday's
Wellness Fair at the Arrillaga Center
for Sports and Recreation drew hun
dreds of staff members as well as a few
students.

According to Eric Stein, a member
of the Be Well team and a senior asso
ciate athletic director, the goal of the
event was simple: "to create a healthi
er Stanford."

The main part of the fair was held
on the Arrillaga Center's basketball
courts, where numerous health and
wellness organizations had set up
booths.

The stations focused on physical
health, with BeWell volunteers leading
yoga classes, rock climbing and other
physical activities.

"BeWell @ Stanford has chosen to
focus on three main pillars: get active,
eat better and unwind," wrote Jennifer
Sexton, a member of the BeWell team
and the coordinator of fitness and well
ness programs, in an e-mail to The
Daily. "We feel that these three areas
play a major role in people's lives."
Stanford Dining also set up a
demonstration area along the wall,
where three of its chefs served gazpa
cho and handed out recipes. Nearby,
several nutritionists lined up to answer
questions about nutrition and healthy
eating.

Other health organizations were
also in attendance, including Kaiser
Permanente and the American Cancer
Society. Representatives from Stan
ford's Blood Center were also on hand
to take blood donations and sign up

participants to become bone marrow
donors.

Other activities included 100-pin
Wii bowling and free massages.
Free health screenings, including
tests for osteoporosis and skin check
ups, were also a big attraction, drawing
long lines of participants waiting to be
tested.

"Our focus is really on promoting
action, so there were many screenings
and tests available for [faculty and
staff] to take advantage of today," Sex
ton said. "We encourage faculty and
staff to take responsibility for their
health by gathering information, creat
ing a plan of action [and] engaging
their health providers and resources
on campus to put the plan into action."
For Xuhuai Ji, a staff research asso
ciate at the School of Medicine's Insti
tute for Immunity, Transplantation and
Infection, those services were the main
reason for going to the fair.
"I've been having some pain in my
shoulder, so I wanted to get one of the
free massages," he said.
Sukhdev Manman, a trades and
crafts supervisor at Buildings and
Grounds Management, also said the
free services were significant in getting
people to attend.

"You want to find out a little bit
more about your health through all the
free testing that they give," he said. "It's
important to raise awareness about
your health, how important it is to
maintain it."

Stein said the fair was part of a year
long BeWell program aimed at Uni
versity employees. He also said that
the Wellness Fair played into Stan
ford's employee incentive program
aimed at increasing "wellness," a cen
tral component of which is "knowing

your numbers" to help in creating an
effective fitness plan.
The costs of putting on the Wellness
Fair came from Stanford's fringe bene
fits pool, which, according to Sexton,
employees pay into for their health
and welfare benefits.

Overall, participants said they felt
that the University was putting ade
quate effort into the Be Well campaign
forfaculty and staff, not just focusing on
the student population. Indeed, Stein
stressed that much of BeWell's pro
grams were initiated for staff and will
be extended to the students next year.
"The emphasis was to start off with
the staff. Now we're trying to work on
students' well-being as well," he said.
Stein went on to say that many re
sources were already in place for stu
dents and that the program was not
disregarding the student body. He said
a proposal to create a wellness incen
tive plan for students will begin next
year; the plan will be similar in struc
ture to the one currently in use for em
ployees.

"They're doing an amazing job,"
said Dawn Maxey 'OB, a clinical re
searcher in pediatric cardiology. "I
went to graduate school on the East
Coast and there was nothing like this .
.. it's great to be on a campus where
this is possible,"
However, not all shared this opin
ion.

"Not enough attention is being paid
to [wellness]," Ji said. "There aren't
enough people coming I'm the only
one from my lab who came."

BeWell is set to host a student well
ness fair on May 12 in White Plaza.
