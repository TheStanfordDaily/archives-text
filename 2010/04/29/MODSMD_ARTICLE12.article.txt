# Stanford, the 'Hub'
## 
### 
When Hecker left Los Alamos
five years ago, he knew he wanted to
teach, but he could have gone any
where. In the end, he chose Stan
ford.
"If Stanford didn't have people
like Bill Perry, Mike May, Scott
Sagan and John Lewis, I wouldn't
have come here," Hecker said. "I
came here because of them and be
cause of the nuclear focus, because
that's what I wanted to dedicate the
rest of my career to."
Sagan, the co-director of CISAC,

emphasized Stanford's ability to
bring together state leaders and pol
icy experts in a track-two fashion
during times when they can't offi
cially engage each other in talks.
After the 1998 nuclear tests in India
and Pakistan, for example, CISAC
hosted former Indian and Pakistani
officials and military leaders "to dis
cuss stability in South Asia in ways
that were constructive and neces
sary at the time," Sagan said.
"Stanford has a long, long tradi
tion in helping behind the scenes,"
he added.

"It really is a kind of hub for
work in this area," David Holloway,
a professor of international history
and political science, said of Stan
ford. "It's hard to think of a better
place to be for somebody working
on these issues."
