In "Senate rejects bill to cut exec
pay" (April 28), The Daily failed to
make clear that ASSU Vice Presi
dent Kelsei Wharton 'l2 resigned as
a senator at Tuesday's meeting. He
did not participate in the vote on ex
ecutive salaries. Also, Ryan Peacock
was listed as a senior; in fact, he is a
graduate student.

In "Chief: alert on Sunday was
'wise'" (April 28), The Daily incor
rectly reported that "no information
was ever posted to the department's
website about the incident." It
should have said that, after the de
partment posted the contents of its
follow-up e-mail on its website, no
additional information was posted.
