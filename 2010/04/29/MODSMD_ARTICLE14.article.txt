## EDITORIAL Arizona immigration bill misguided and dangerous 
### 
Nearly a week ago, the governor of Ari
zona signed into law a controversial
new bill that severely tightens immi
gration policies in an effort to make it easier
for undocumented residents in Arizona to be
identified and arrested. The Editorial Board
believes that this bill is dangerous not only
because it places far too much power in the
hands of local police officials in Arizona, but
also because it contains no clear guidelines
for identifying those without legal documen
tation.
The Arizona bill known as S.B. 1070
requires police in Arizona to question any
one they suspect of being undocumented,
and allows them to detain suspected undocu
mented individuals who are unable to pro
vide proof of legal residence. The bill states
that those questioned by police must make a
"reasonable attempt" to verify their immi
gration status when the questioning officer
feels that there is "reasonable suspicion" to
warrant asking them for the information. The
vagueness of the bill's language is problemat
ic, and will probably lead to many disputes
and law suits later on.
With regards to immigration in America,
some believe that current federal legislation
and law enforcement does not do enough to
maintain our borders. But despite the failings
of current immigration policies, SB 1070
takes things too far by giving Arizona state
police officers the right to make evaluations
concerning someone's legal status in the na
tion, even to the point of keeping them in de
tention or having them deported. Immigra
tion law pertains not only to undocumented
immigrants but also to how American citi
zens are treated. Because of the implications
that our immigration policies have on U.S.
citizens as a whole whether Arizonans,
Californians or otherwise it makes sense
that the federal government would have the
final say regarding immigration policy and

enforcement.
It is unclear what will constitute "reason
able suspicion" for questioning a state resi
dent under the Arizona law, though ethnici
ty is forbidden to be the sole basis for ques
tioning. Arizona Governor Jan Brewer, how
ever, has been unable to define how police
will go about identifying undocumented im
migrants by sight. Yet this has not stopped
her from ordering training for state police
regarding the standards by which evalua
tions are to be made in these incidents. No
Arizona state official has publicly released
these standards.

To ignore the implications of ethnicity in
the framing of the bill is laughable. Ignoring
ethnicity while conjuring a notion of who
may be under "reasonable suspicion" is an
interesting thought exercise for those who
believe "being undocumented is not a race.it
is a crime." Rather than protecting citizens
through the bill's stated strategy of attrition
through enforcement, some American citi
zens will find it much more difficult to live
without increased fear and humiliation.

There is a strong likelihood that the Ari
zona bill will eventually be ruled unconstitu
tional, and the Editorial Board believes this
is rightfully so. Current law does not grant
state police the sweeping authority to en
force immigration policy federal agents
are tasked with this job. State police are not
trained to serve as immigration officials, and
therefore cannot be empowered to act like
them in any state in the U.S. Furthermore,
questioning all potential undocumented res
idents with no clear standards regarding
what may arouse "reasonable suspicion" will
lead to flagrant abuse of state-sanctioned
power. The possibility that the state of Ari
zona could have fewer undocumented resi
dents as a result of the bill does not begin to
outweigh the legal and ethical implications of
enforcing it.
