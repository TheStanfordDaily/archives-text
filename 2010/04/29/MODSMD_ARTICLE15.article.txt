# ADVENTURES IN ACADEMIA
## Why are such happy students so unhappy? 
### Danny Crichton 
How happy are Stanford students? It is
a tough question to answer, masked
by the compulsion of students here to
appear happier than they actually are, I never
really thought that mental health was a prob
lem before, but then again, I had never asked
any of my friends and fellow students what
they thought about it.
As I talk to more students though, I real
ize that mental health is something that af
fects all of us, even the people I least expect
ed. Whether academic or relationship stress,
the trials and tribulations of a Stanford edu
cation do not seem to miss many members of
the student body. Nonetheless, the discussion
of these problems is absent, save for the
handful of student groups on campus that
work to solve these problems.
Just why are so many Stanford students
unhappy? The first thing that came to my
mind was intensity. We are surrounded by the
most intense people in the world, and there
are few outlets for release. Leaving for the
city is difficult, and Palo Alto is certainly not
a bastion of tranquility.
Unfortunately, our culture here glorifies
the bravado of students, and rarely offers a
peek into their weaknesses. We do not admit
when we are stressed out, even when the
signs are clearly visible (hint: if you see a vein
popping, it probably is pretty bad). We all
have weaknesses and times when we are
physically and mentally stressed beyond a
level healthy for young adults. Yet we often
refuse to recognize these signs.
I believe that a large part of that failure is
a lack of a strong community of support. We
are not comfortable talking outside a small
circle regarding our personal travails, nor are
we in many cases willing to listen. Part of the
problem may be the housing system, which
encourages social fragmentation. Another
part comes from a culture of rugged individ
ualism that is the hallmark of this region.
However, this culture of support is built
into the freshman experience, which is why I
think that freshmen, who probably have the
most stress due to the adjustment process, ac
tually have less mental stress than upper
classmen. As that safety net disappears, we
see the first cracks form during sophomore
year, when friends have been scattered
across campus and there are not events
scheduled by staff to release stress.
Unfortunately, I think a large part of the
stress is placed on students by themselves; in
my opinion, this is the largest cause of mental
stress here at Stanford. We set the highest
possible bars for ourselves, and we are not
willing to move the bar to match our real per
formance, Having goals is one thing, but hav-

ing unrealistic ones which are repeatedly
missed can prove to be deeply distressing.
The need for someone external is crucial in
releasing stress, which is why a community of
support is so vital.
Even so, I think that there are also struc
tural issues that cause mental stress, ones
such a community would not be able to solve.
The fast pace of the quarter system forces
students to hurry from class to class, problem
set to problem set in order to finish every
thing on time, never allowing for the down
moments necessary for the human body to
recharge.

With all of these different sources of stres
sors, what are we to do in order to make our
undergraduate experience less stressful?
First, I recognize that meaningfulness and
stress are functions of time - the less time de
voted to an action, the less meaningful and
more stressful it becomes. We can start by
paring back the units we take (maybe by only
one or two) and cutting down on the hours
devoted to multiple student groups. We need
to focus on getting meaning out of every ex
perience here (it is indeed about quality, not
quantity).
Next, identify the signs that your friends
and neighbors are stressed it might be a
certain shirt that is worn, extra oily hair or a
bulging vein then take actions to reduce
the stress of that person. Have lunch with
them, offer to help and try to be humorous (I
tend to fail on this one). None of us will admit
to the stress we feel, but each of us can create
a community of caring without anyone ad
mitting to anything egregious.
Finally, engage with the mental health is
sues. There are plenty of student groups on
campus that work on this issue, and there are
many ways to get involved. The point of our
time here at Stanford, and indeed of our lives,
is to see our dreams become reality and to
love every moment of the journey. We can all
help create an environment where that can
be the case.
