# ALTERNATIVE LIVING... WITHOUT THE NAKED
## Sex and Sensitivity 
### Samantha Toh 
Suggesting that God does, perhaps, exist,
this article will discuss neither Jane
Austen, my personal sex life nor a terri
fying combination of both. Rather, what I
want to write about today is something quite
different: the Talk.

One amazing thing at Stanford is the
availability of expert opinion, frequently ac
cessible to all in the form of talks. While I
conduct continuous love affairs with ideas,
actually getting me to a speaking event is a
problem of its own. If it is fall, I am busy out
doors tromping in fallen leaves; winter, and I
am tucked up in my thermal blanket drinking
homemade honey chai; spring, and I am in
the sun, napping on random hammocks and
falling off them when I roll around in my
sleep.

In a surprising turn of events, however, I
was seduced by the temptation of catered
chicken Caesar salad last Friday afternoon.
Starving and armed with a thinking cap on
my head, I headed to the A3C for a Spring
Quarter Luncheon, led by Dr. Celine
Shimizu. I sat attentively for an hour, salad in
my belly. At the end of the hour, I left, brain
in a tizzy. While Dr. Shimizu had covered
many a topic in her specialized domain - in
particular, male Asian-American sexuality in
film - what hit home was a much broader
point about the way we construct notions of
sexuality in general.
The most illuminating implication of Dr.
Shimizu's research, I believe, is that sexuality
is not sex alone. While this understanding of
sexuality probably exists in the backs of our
minds, the fact that it is not at the forefront is
problematic. We threaten to reduce eroticism
to pornographic thrusting, or limit the target
of our sexual encounters to the orgasm. Hav
ing, as a freshman, had my mind exploded by
the kinds of porn my fellow residents
watched, I believe that I at least partially un
derstand the dehumanizing possibilities of
what constitutes sexuality. Pornography fo
cuses solely on sex for a purpose, but it is im
portant to understand that it is rarely reality
nor - in my opinion - should it be. Sexuality
has the potential to encompass a more
human aspect, and I'm not even talking

about love. There exist, in addition, concepts
of emotional intimacy that evoke senses of
protection, security and attachment. Even
something as simple as enjoying the compa
ny of a partner complicates but also enriches
what sexuality means.

What the talk revealed was not that relat
ing sex to sexuality is taboo or wrong in any
way. It simply suggested that we consider sex
as a subset rather than an equivalent. Limit
ing ourselves to narrow definitions of sexual
ity and the role sexuality plays in our lives
does not simply have effects on gender roles,
nor does it just reinforce human behavior
patterns in possibly violent ways. It also re
stricts our scope of latent sexual possibilities,
possibilities that may be more appropriate
for certain numbers of us, considering that
we are all individuals with different needs
and desires.

The curious thing about talks like this
however, is whether one can translate theo
retical concepts into large-scale action. They
often impact only certain members of their
audience. Trying to convince large numbers
of people to change their behavior patterns
based on a lecture alone is sometimes frus
trating; people are either too lazy or too com
fortable in their present state of behavior. Yet
if talks are supposed to initiate change, and if
change seems significant only on a wide
scale, does the idea of a "talk" become, then,
futile?

One interaction after the talk made me re
alize that sometimes, the most golden of
changes are the ones that we direct internal
ly; if we are one of the "certain members" im
pacted, that is what matters the most.
In an attempt to sort my head out, I struck
up a conversation with an upstanding young

gentleman whom I had met perhaps thrice
before. We ended up having a brain-jarring
conversation. In the ensuing time that we
spoke, I discovered how the talk made him
rethink not only sexuality, but also masculin
ity and the link between the two - from a per
sonal point of view. By diverging from the
traditional descriptions of what masculine
sexuality is - dominance, aggression and
emotional callousness, to name a few - and
including within the definition protection,
care and emotional sensitivity, he was able to
internalize the academic content of the talk
and translate it into a feeling of greater mas
culinity for himself.
That, I feel, is what made the talk truly
memorable for me. Past the intellectual stim
ulation of what it was, the content of the talk
had changed somebody's perception of
themselves. It had also challenged my own
assumptions about sexual beings. It made me
consider, for one, how I could think about
emotional sensitivity as potentially sensual.
It also made me consider what kind of role a
sense of protection could play in enhancing a
person's physical sexuality.
And I found myself learning - even
though I never really fell victim to these tra
ditional definitions to begin with. After all, I
have a great passion for dorks. I have also
historically (and perhaps cheaply) been
charmed by those sensitive enough to want
to protect me, be it from the cold, evil peo
ple, sadness or allergens. Yet, there is some
thing different between liking a dork and
sexualizing the concept of a dork. There is a
difference between liking sensitivity and re
alizing that sensitivity can be distinctly
male.

That was how I came out of the talk with
more than just a sudden muffin-top of chick
en Caesar salad. More than that, I came out
with a need to probe my assumptions, to
know which have been imposed on me and
which I really believe in, and how I can differ
entiate between the two.
