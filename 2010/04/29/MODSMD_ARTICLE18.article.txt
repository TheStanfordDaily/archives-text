## Character questions go too far 
### Zach Zimmerman Dishing the Rock 
Character issues. This loosely
defined term has become
virtually as important as a
player's 40-yard dash time
when it comes to the NFL
Draft. The idea is acceptable teams
don't want their locker rooms to be
filled with punch throwers or drug
abusers, bad attitudes and uncoachable
personalities. Prior to making draft-day
decisions, coaches and managers need
to gauge whether a guy with said issues
is worth the risk (Terrell Owens) or
headed for disaster (Pacman Jones).
This recent boom in concern has led
to the increased importance of player
interviews. The meetings between po
tential draftees, coaches and manage
ment are private in theory, but have be
come undeniably public. The year
round coverage of the draft yields
every fine detail of a player's life, from
academic performance to recreational
drug usage, and even to music selec
tion.
Unfortunately, this trend has taken
the interviewing process to a danger
ous level. These interactions have now
escaped from the comfortable discus
sion of locker room stability, and have
now become superfluous interroga
tions that can offend and belittle a play
er and those near to him.
Take for example Dez Bryant, the
former Oklahoma State wide receiver
and 2010 first-round draft pick of the
Dallas Cowboys. Bryant grew up in
conditions foreign to most of us. His
mother gave birth to him when she was
just 15 and has served jail time for a
drug-related offense. Bryant's difficult
upbringing, coupled with his NCAA
suspension in 2009 for lying about con
tact with former NFL star Deion
Sanders, made teams feel that they had
reason to suspect that the star receiver
may have character issues. Fair enough.
But in unbelievable fashion,
one team executive crossed the line.
During an interview in March,
Miami Dolphins General Manager
Jeff Ireland asked Bryant if his
mother was a prostitute.
Ireland's job is to build a football
team. He is employed to optimize the
talent, structure and efficiency of the
Miami organization. He is not respon
sible for humiliating prospective play
ers with distasteful and irrelevant ques
tions.
He attempted to justify his actions
by stating that it is his job to find out as
much information about a player as
possible. What he failed to grasp was
that this responsibility begins and ends
between the hashes. His job is to ensure
that Bryant and every other potential
Dolphin would mesh well with the cur
rent chemistry of the team and repre
sent the team well off the field. Does
the background of Bryant's mother re
ally matter? Absolutely not.
Additionally, what if Bryant had
said yes? Would the Dolphins have
based Bryant's draft stock on his moth
er's background? Are her life choices
directly related to her son's ability to
play professional football? Would they
guarantee that Dez would follow suit
and partake in illegal activities?
Ireland won't lose his job. He'll
come under temporary scrutiny, and it
will pass over in a matter of days. In fact,
many Miami fans will agree that the
question was not only acceptable, but
necessary. It's not entirely their fault
the obsession with the NFL Draft has
catapulted college kids straight to the
celebrity ranks. They are now expected
to pass every "character" test with fly
ing colors, and if not, they are expected
to face the consequences. Character is
sues no longer begin and end with the
player, but have extended to anyone re
motely associated with him.
Yet something needs to be done to
ensure that these practices are moni
tored. What if you interviewed for an
office position and the employer asked
if your brother was a cocaine addict?
How would you react? The idea is com
ical why would this have any bear
ing on my credentials or opportunity to
work? but the situation is far from
funny.

I'm sympathetic for Dez Bryant. It's
unfortunate that a kid that has come so
far has to be constantly probed to re
hash the memories of his childhood. He
demonstrated incredible poise during
the interview, and amazingly didn't lose

his cool. He is a phenomenal football
player, and I wish him all the success in
the world. I hope he burns Miami cor
ners for the next 12 years and instills
envy in all of the GMs that passed on
him because of his "poor character."
Football is just a game, and the
Draft is merely a small portion of it.
Ireland and his colleagues need to be
held to a very high standard when con
ducting player interviews. With the off
the-field issues of NFL players con
suming sports news, character is surely
an important issue. But the questions
are going too far, and football execu
tives are inappropriately and inaccu
rately deciding how to determine
character.

Jeff Ireland, you should be
ashamed.

Zach Zimmerman thinks Terrell
Owens is worth the risk. Find out if
