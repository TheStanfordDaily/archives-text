# SEMIFINAL WAR

### CAROLINE CASELLI DESK EDITOR 
The No. 1 Stanford men's volleyball team looks to extend
its playoff run tonight when it plays host to No. 4 Hawaii (19-
9, 14-8 MPSF) in the semifinals of the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation (MPSF) Tournament.
The Card (20-6,16-6 MPSF) already braved its first post
season challenge last Saturday, knocking out a formidable
opponent in the UC-Irvine Anteaters. The win marked the
first postseason victory for the Cardinal since 1997, and the
first playoff victory at Maples Pavilion since 1994.
But rather than bask in its success, the squad is keeping its
focus on the match at hand.
"It was nice to win this last match against such a good
team, however this was just a step in the right direction," said
senior opposite Evan Romero. "We can reflect on the
[progress] we've made after the season, but for now, we are
solely concentrating on the present and the next match
against Hawaii."
Although Stanford has faced and swept Hawaii
twice this season already, the matches were the first two of
the season and were played in January, over three months
ago.
"I am excited to see what they will bring to the table," said
sophomore outside hitter Brad Lawson. "Their lineup hasn't
changed much since the last time we met, but there's no
doubt they have matured and progressed as a team and will
be confident coming off of their close win against Pepper
dine, It will be exciting for us and challenging as well to face
UH when they're playing at their peak."
The Warriors' season has been peppered with both wins
and losses to teams across the rankings, including a 3-1 victo
ry over then-top-ranked USC in January and a recent 3-0 loss
to No. 9 UC-Santa Barbara.
Most recently, Hawaii took down Pepperdine a team
that has given Stanford some trouble this year â€”in a
thrilling five-set victory to advance in the MPSF tournament.
Like Stanford, this was a long-awaited win; the Hawaii team
hadn't won a postseason match since 2003.
The Card will have to contain the Warriors' standout
freshman opposite Jonas Umlauft. Recently named the
MPSF's Freshman of the Year, Umlauft led the conference
with a 5.29 kill average and has had 13 20-plus kill matches.
