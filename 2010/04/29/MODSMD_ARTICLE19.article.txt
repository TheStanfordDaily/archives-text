# SEMIFINAL WAR

### CAROLINE CASELLI DESK EDITOR 
The No. 1 Stanford men's volleyball team looks to extend
its playoff run tonight when it plays host to No. 4 Hawaii (19-
9, 14-8 MPSF) in the semifinals of the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation (MPSF) Tournament.
The Card (20-6,16-6 MPSF) already braved its first post
season challenge last Saturday, knocking out a formidable
opponent in the UC-Irvine Anteaters. The win marked the
first postseason victory for the Cardinal since 1997, and the
first playoff victory at Maples Pavilion since 1994.
But rather than bask in its success, the squad is keeping its
focus on the match at hand.
"It was nice to win this last match against such a good
team, however this was just a step in the right direction," said
senior opposite Evan Romero. "We can reflect on the
[progress] we've made after the season, but for now, we are
solely concentrating on the present and the next match
against Hawaii."
Although Stanford has faced and swept Hawaii
twice this season already, the matches were the first two of
the season and were played in January, over three months
ago.
"I am excited to see what they will bring to the table," said
sophomore outside hitter Brad Lawson. "Their lineup hasn't
changed much since the last time we met, but there's no
doubt they have matured and progressed as a team and will
be confident coming off of their close win against Pepper
dine, It will be exciting for us and challenging as well to face
UH when they're playing at their peak."
The Warriors' season has been peppered with both wins
and losses to teams across the rankings, including a 3-1 victo
ry over then-top-ranked USC in January and a recent 3-0 loss
to No. 9 UC-Santa Barbara.
Most recently, Hawaii took down Pepperdine a team
that has given Stanford some trouble this year —in a
thrilling five-set victory to advance in the MPSF tournament.
Like Stanford, this was a long-awaited win; the Hawaii team
hadn't won a postseason match since 2003.
The Card will have to contain the Warriors' standout
freshman opposite Jonas Umlauft. Recently named the
MPSF's Freshman of the Year, Umlauft led the conference
with a 5.29 kill average and has had 13 20-plus kill matches.

GAME NOTES ! No. 1 Stanford won its first postseason match in 13 years when
it defeated UC-lrvine on Saturday in the quarterfinals of the MPSF Tourna
ment. The Cardinal will now take on Hawaii, which won a five-set match over
Pepperdine to advance. Stanford is 2-0 against the Warriors this season, with
both wins being sweeps in the first two matches of the season.


JONATHAN POTO/The Stanford Daily
Sophomore outside hitter Brad Lawson and No. 1 Stanford beat UC-lrvine to advance to tonights semifinal against Hawaii. The Cardinal
swept the Warriors in both the teams' matchups this season, although the two meetings were Stanford's first two matches of the year.

Two juniors, outside hitter Joshua
Walker and setter Nejc Zemljak,
also received postseason MPSF
awards for their consistent play
throughout the season; Walker just
became the 12th player in UH histo
ry to record 1,000 career kills and
Zemljak has 1,385 assists, the sec
ond-highest in the program's history.
Although Stanford has won its
last six matchups against Hawaii, the
Warriors still have the overall edge.
Currently, the series stands at 34-30.
Should Stanford win tonight's
match, the team will face the winner
of the other semifinal match be
tween No. 2 BYU and No. 3 Cal State
Northridge in the MPSF Tourna
ment finals on Saturday. The winner
of the tournament is granted a berth
to the four-team NCAA Tourna
ment and a chance at a national title.
Stanford has not won a national

championship in men's volleyball
since 1997.
Even if the Card fails to win the
MPSF Tournament, it still has a
strong shot at a berth to the NCAAs
due to its first-place finish in the reg
ular season of the MPSF, the nation's
strongest conference by a long shot.
The only way for Stanford to be
sure of a berth, though, is to keep
winning, starting with tonight's
match against Hawaii.

"I think it's natural for us to be
nervous coming into the MPSF
semifinal because none of us have
played in such an important match
before," Lawson said, "but we've
prepared and are ready to take on a
tough UH opponent and more than
anything we're excited and anxious
to play tomorrow."
First serve will be at 7:30 p.m. at
Maples Pavilion.
