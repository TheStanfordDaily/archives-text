## GSC approves budget, changes hands 
### BRIANNA PANG STAFF WRITER 
Approving the fiscal year 2011 budget, out
going Graduate Student Council members
smoothly passed the torch to the new council
on Wednesday night and concluded their terms
with occasionally sad goodbyes.
Without skipping a beat, the newly elected
council chose officers for the upcoming year.
Jessica Tsai and Justin Brown now head the
graduate student branch of Stanford student
government.

Although the council had previously dis
cussed decreasing ASSU executive salaries, this

week council members decided not to further
pursue the issue after the Undergraduate Sen
ate shot down the proposed salary decreases 7-
1 at Tuesday's meeting.

Without the changes to salary, the proposed
budget up for vote more closely resembled the
2009-10 budget.

"I think the [salary] issue's dead," said GSC
Financial Officer Ryan Peacock, a graduate
student in chemical engineering. Peacock was
eager to pass the budget to allow for GSC tran
sition to new members, adding, "If you vote
against it, I will kick you in the face."
GSC members unanimously approved the
proposed budget without executive salary

changes for fiscal year 2010-11.
Fourteen members were sworn in, with one
member absent. Evan Berquist, the School of
Law representative, was reported to be abroad
in China.

Every GSC position has been filled, after
Imeh Williams, a third-year education student,
was chosen as School of Education representa
tive. Williams was elected after receiving three
write-in votes.

In preparation for the upcoming year, GSC
members voted on new officers while leaving
some spots open. Hoping to get more graduate

recruit from non-voting member
pools for positions such as equip
ment master.

However, the three positions that
require candidates to be voting
members were filled quickly. Jessica
Tsai, a medical student, and Justin
Brown, a graduate student in geo
physics, were elected co-chairs, while
Ping Li, a business student , was elect
ed to be the new financial officer.

Krystal St. Julien, a graduate stu
dent in biochemistry, was voted as
Funding Committee chair last week.
On Wednesday, St. Julien said she
was still seeking more graduate stu
dents for the committee before ulti
mately deciding on a deputy chair.

ASSU executives Angelina Car

vided an update, explaining they
were in the process of conducting
cabinet interviews.

Stanford. GSC members will also
use $2,000 for their upcoming new

The meeting concluded with a
hug between outgoing GSC co-chair
Eric Osborne, a law student, and re
turning GSC member Addy Satija, a
graduate student in energy resources
and electrical engineering.
