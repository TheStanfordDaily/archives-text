# HEAD TO HEAD: Are ties good for sports?
## Nature of sports requires a winner 
### Kabir Sawhney 
Sports are, at their' very core, about
competition. In every sport ever
conceived, the general idea is for
one person or group to compete
against another person or group
to see who can win given a predetermined
set of rules. Given this definition, it is hard to
say that ties are good for any sport.
To put it simply, the goal of any game is to
maximize how often you win. Of course, los
ing occasionally is something that one must
accept you can't win every game you play.
However, a tie is more deeply unsatisfy
ing to the competitors than even a loss. A win
or loss gives a sense of finality, and the idea
that you gave your best effort that led to the
result you achieved. A tie has none of these
qualities â€”it has neither the triumphant
feeling of a win nor the disappointment and
resignation of a loss. It is simply nothing

and that, to me at least, seems to be the
worst result you could possibly get out
of a couple hours or days of effort.
It's not just the competitors the
fans hate ties, too. Of course, if you're a
supporter of a certain team (or "side,"
as my esteemed colleague Tom Taylor
would say), you don't want to see your
team emerge from a match ("fixture")
with a tie you want to see them bring
home a win. In this case, I suppose a tie
might be better than a loss, because it
would at least come with the satisfac
tion that the opposing side didn't get
anything out of the game, either.
For unbiased viewers, however, ties
are the worst thing that can happen.
Ties are boring and uninspiring, and
can elicit no emotional response from
anyone. They also seem to suggest that
the whole exercise was simply a waste
of time. No one won and no one lost, so
what was the point of playing the game
in the first place?
For me, the World Cup best illus
trates why ties are bad for sports. Apart
from Team USA's games, which are fair
ly small in number, I watch most World
Cup matches as an unbiased viewer
simply looking for an entertaining
event. In these events, ties are always
deeply disappointing. I have no way of
knowing which team is better, nor is
there any real joy or sadness betrayed
by the players on the sidelines. The en
tire affair leaves a simple question hang
ing over it: why should anyone care?
To take another example that I'm
sure will be cited by Tom, cricket test

matches (which are played over five
days) often end in ties because the
teams simply run out of time and don't
complete two innings. As a follower of
the Indian team, I find that ties are also
just annoying, and sometimes can be
even more disappointing than a loss. I
remember watching a test series re
cently between India and Australia.
The Indians were destroying the
Aussies,but because they took so much
time in amassing a gigantic lead, the
Roos could simply stall until time ran
out and the match was declared a draw.

I'm sure you will agree with me that
this result was infuriating both for the
Indian fans and for the impartial ob
servers. One team was clearly superior,
yet it will never gain that recognition
because of how cricket cherishes the
tie.

So, I contend that it is impossible for
ties to be good for sport. Players and
fans alike hate them simply because
they lack any sort of decisiveness that
one would like in a result.

Indeed, one league that has effec
tively moved away from ties recently is
the NHL. As part of the new post-lock
out rules, ties have been eliminated, and
replaced with a shootout if an overtime
period produces no winner. Fans love it,
but some hockey purists have com
plained that the tie is a sacred part of the
game. I don't know about you, but I cer
tainly prefer the excitement, drama and
(most important) the actual result that
emerges from them.
Ties simply betray the nature of
sport without a real result coming
out of a match, I don't see the point in
playing it at all.
