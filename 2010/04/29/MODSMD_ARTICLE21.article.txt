# Ties allow for more intrigue
## 
### Tom Taylor 
After a scoreless game against
Duke in 1953, Navy football
coach Eddie Erdelatz said,
"A tie is like kissing your sis
ter." Now, if Jerry Springer
has taught me anything, it is that Ameri
cans are the experts in the latter, but the
former, the noble draw (British for "tie"), is
notable in its absence from any of Ameri
ca's favorite pastimes.
In the MLB, games can only be tied due
to weather or failing daylight, and even
then will be continued later to ensure there
is a winner. Basketball is similarly averse to
draws, and technically as many overtimes
as necessary will be played until one team
can leave victorious. Sudden death over
time was added to the NFL in 1974 to solve,
though not entirely prevent, the problem
of ties, and a hockey game can go to a
penalty shootout to break the dead
lock.

On the other side of the pond, the
art of tying a game is alive and well in
my cherished sport of soccer. Last Sat
urday, there were 11 draws out of 40
games played in the top four tiers of
the English league.
Now, soccer has a bad reputation
over here as being a sport of boring
0-0 draws, and I'll admit to having
paid good money to witness a few in
my lifetime, but just one of those
games last weekend finished goal
less. And a crucial point was salvaged
from these ties, a point that for sever
al clubs could well be the difference
between survival and relegation now
that we are at the business end of the
season.

However, draws in soccer are just
the tip of the iceberg. There is another
sport where ties are taken to a com
pletely different level: cricket.

A traditional international "test
match" in cricket consists of two in
nings played over five days. A strong
performance by one side in the first in
nings can often make the game effec
tively unwinnable for the other team,
even with three days still remaining.
There is then just one option left for
the losing side: to stand its ground and
play for the tie.
Hour upon hour this team will at

tempt to bat out the game, resisting
volley after volley from the bowlers
and holding its nerve from sunup to
sundown. When the dust settles and
tired fans shuffle out of the ground to
start their long journeys home, they
may well do so knowing they wit
nessed a special moment in sport. An
epic tie.

If a match ends with two teams
level on points, this single statistic
doesn't mean it was a dull and dreary
affair. And the opposite is equally
true: a win doesn't guarantee it was a
great game.

Blowouts aren't particularly
thrilling; what most people want are
exciting, close games, because live
sport is really about entertainment.
And those are exactly the sorts of
matches that naturally lead to the two
teams being tied at the end of regula
tion.

Whether it was a great game or an
awful one that ends level at full-time,
forcing the teams to continue from
this point on is never a great way out.
If you just spent 90 minutes of your life
watching the sporting equivalent of
paint drying, you will surely not be ex
cited about the prospect of extra time,
but even if it was a thrill-a-minute ride,
some essential things are lost by ex
tending the game: upsets and unpre
dictability. Statistically, the big teams
will always have an advantage the
more minutes are played that's
why they are the big teams. The blood,
sweat and tears expended by the little
guy that kept them honest will come
to nothing.

In a knockout tournament, you
need a definite winner and loser, but
when playing in a league format, it is
the number of points a team can ac
crue by season's end that matters. Au
tomatically, the idea of a tie is not just
compatible with this sort of competi
tion; it can be crucial for the minnows
in the league, the eternal underdogs.
Hoping to defeat one of the biggest
and richest teams in the world at their
own ground seems almost futile, but
sneaking away with a draw might just
be possible.

In the end though, however pas
sionate I might feel about the thrill of
a hard-fought tie, I might not be able
to win this one, at least on this side of
the Atlantic. Perhaps the draw feels as
alien to an American sports fan as the
game-ending buzzer or infinite substi
tutions do to me.

But please, when fate and the
rules still m anage to conspire to pro
duce that elusive result, before feel
ing annoyed that you spent your
hard-earned cash to watch a tie,
pause for a moment and give the
teams their dues. Maybe it was a bor
ing, terrible spectacle, or maybe, just
maybe, it was a legendary battle, the
sort of game where no one deserves to
walk away the loser.

These are the sorts of contests in
which heroes are made. When your
team, an insignificant club in the pan
theon of world sport, travels right into
the heart of the lion's den and scrapes
a tie against international superstars
through solid teamwork, good tactics
and a hefty dose of luck.
