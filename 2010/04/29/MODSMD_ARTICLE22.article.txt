## Card earns No. 2 seed for MPSFs Stanford aims to defend conference title this weekend 
### CHRIS JUHNKE DESK EDITOR 
The No. 15 Stanford women's lacrosse team
came up big last weekend, taking down Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation (MPSF) foe UC-Davis 17-
14 in its last game of the regular season. With the
win, the Cardinal claimed the No. 2 seed in the
MPSFTournament, which will be held this weekend
in Denver.

Against the Aggies, the Cardinal started out
strong, scoring seven straight goals before Davis
even got on the board. Senior Claire Flubbard had
two goals and two assists during the 7-0 run and, for
her efforts in the game, was named MPSF Player of
the Week. The Cardinal's opening dominance didn't
last, however, and the Aggies found some rhythm
toward the end of the first half, scoring five goals and
ending the period down 13-5.

In the second half, Davis turned the tables on
Stanford, scoring nine goals and getting within three
points of the Cardinal before the game finished.
Stanford goalie Annie Read played a valuable role
for the Cardinal, recording six saves in the second
half alone to preserve the win.

Senior Dana Lindsay had a team-leading four
goals in the win, while Hubbard finished with three
goals and four assists. Junior Sarah Flynn also
recorded a hat trick and redshirt junior Lauren
Schmidt tallied two goals and two assists.
With the win, the Cardinal finished the MPSF
with a 5-1 conference record with the only loss com
ing to Denver on the road and earned the No. 2 seed
for the conference tournament, which starts today.
"I am very proud of our performance this sea
son." said sophomore defender Paige Farmakis. "We
had high expectations and goals for ourselves and
accomplished a lot of them. I was especially proud of

us when we broke into the top 10."
"Unfortunately we had some tough losses on the
road, but overall I would say we are proud of what
we've accomplished in the regular season and are
geared up for the postseason," Farmakis added.
To start the tournament, Stanford will take on
No. 7 seed Fresno State, who finished the season
with a 0-6 record in the MPSF. In the only regular
season meeting between the two teams, the Cardi
nal excelled with a resounding 19-4 victory where
seven players had at least two goals. Stanford re
mains focused, however, and knows it will need to
play at its best to succeed.
"This weekend is really about us playing our
game." Farmakis said. "We've been just working on
our offensive movement and a strong team defense.
If we play as a team the whole time, I believe we will
have a great weekend."
While the Cardinal will be facing familiar foes,
this is the postseason, and the stakes are somewhat
higher now, as the winner of the MPSF Tournament
earns an automatic bid to the play-in game for the
NCAA Tournament. This is especially important to
