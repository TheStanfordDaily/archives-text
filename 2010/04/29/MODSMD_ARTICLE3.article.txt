# Palo Alto talks heavy budget cuts
## Facing strains, city's proposed budget could cut jobs, services 
### KATHLEEN CHAYKOWSKI STAFF WRITER 
The Palo Alto City Council may pass
nearly $lO million worth of budget cuts
for fiscal year 2011 in response to what
City Manager James Keene described as
unprecedented financial hardships for the
city.

"In contrast to a lot of similar recession
periods, this is deeper and longer-term
than California cities, in my view, have
ever faced," Keene said.

Palo Alto's budget crisis resulted from
rising costs, including salaries, according
to Mayor Pat Burt. Now, if cuts to the
budget are passed, they would reduce
public services citywide and result in the
loss of the equivalent of 75 full-time city
jobs.

Burt said the city expects to face point
ed reaction from community groups
"wanting to come in and argue why their
programs should be preserved." He called
the process "difficult," saying that the
"toughest" budget cut issues to decide will
be the ones with apparent community ob
jection.

Keene has been working with individ
ual city departments over the last six to
nine months to develop a list of 33 poten

tial cuts the city council will vote on this
June.

Palo Alto's deficit has been a recurring
problem. The FY2OII budget gap is pro
jected to be $8.3 million, and the city has
accumulated almost $5OO million in back
log infrastructure needs, according to Vice
Mayor Sid Espinosa.

It is hoped that implementing the $lO
million in FY2OII cuts will reduce the
budget gap for FY2012 to as low as $1 mil
lion, said Greg Scharff, council member
and member of the finance committee.

The 33 potential cuts translate to $10.3
million, an amount that deliberately ex
ceeds the projected $8.3 million FY2OII
gap in order to give council members
some choice in determining where cuts
will ultimately be made.

The budget gap can be attributed to
the city's rising cost of salaries and bene
fits in combination with a decline in tax
revenues, Burt said.

The city's sales tax collection, for ex
ample, fell to $15.9 million in 2009 from
$22.9 million in 2000, while the combined
cost of salaries and benefits rose to $91.9
million from $64.8 million, according to
Scharff.
"I think that everyone in the com
munity understands that cuts need to
be made in order to balance the
budget," he added.
The solution, however, is less ob
vious. Although the global economic
recession contributed to the deficit,
Burt said local governments around
the nation experiencing similar prob
lems will need more than a healthy
economy to rectify budgetary woes.
"The government takes longer to
recover than the private sector," Burt
said. "That is why we feel we should
n't just use a series of band-aids to get
us through this tough time, but actu
ally implement a series of structural
reforms." Scharff defined structural
reforms as changing expenditures on
a forward-going basis.

Community Effects and Reactions
The budget gap has forced local
government to prioritize critical city
services and attempt to minimize im
pact on the community.
"We have expert assessments of
where the city should make reduc
tions that would have the least im
pact on the city which would be
surprising to most people because
there are a lot of things on this list
that will raise concern in our commu
nity," Keene said.
Scharff explained that rectifying
the budget gap is fundamentally an
issue of reducing employee costs.

"The only way you do it is you
have layoffs, basically," Scharff said.
The city is currently considering
eliminating the equivalent of 75 full
time positions, through contracting
out services like landscape mainte
nance and assessing efficiency within
the police and fire departments. So
far, five full-time police officer posi
tions have been identified as a poten
tial cut, in addition to two police in
vestigative services positions.

It is estimated that proposed re
ductions within the police team and
traffic control would save the city $1
million.

Other proposed cuts include
shortening public library hours for
$215,000, requiring city residents to
privately manage sidewalk repair ex
penses, canceling Twilight, a summer
concert series, and cutting Safe
Routes to School, a school-hours
traffic control program that Burt de
scribed as one of the most effective
ways in which the city has reduced
the use of vehicles in getting children
safely to school.
Community groups and service
providers, such as the fire union, have
already begun expressing opposition
to the cuts through petitions and
feedback in public meetings.
Espinosa believes that public sat
isfaction will be close to impossible.
"At every step, there will be some
one who thinks the service is critical
and should not be cut," he said.

Stanford Hospital & Clinics
The city's budget woes may also
have affected negotiations between
the University and the City of Palo

Alto on the expansion of Stanford
Hospital & Clinics and Lucile
Packard Children's Hospital, since
the hospital expansion proposal
could increase housing, electric,
water and traffic costs for the city.
Burt said the hospital negotia
tions are "pretty much independent"
of the city's budgetary issues. Scharff,
however, said the negotiations may
reflect the city's need to minimize
costs.

"I think there is heightened sensi
tivity to the fact that Palo Alto needs
to be at least revenue-neutral,"
Scharff said, explaining why the city
is being careful to ensure that the
hospital expansion won't cost Palo
Alto in the long term through in
creased traffic or environmental im
pact.

"The good news in that the differ
ences between the city's concerns
about environmental impacts and
the hospital are much smaller than
they were four years ago," Burt said.
The city is exploring ways to im
prove the process of making budget
decisions, Burt says, by involving
more policy representatives in deci
sions that have been historically
made by the finance committee
alone.

The city has also been trying to
raise revenue through tourism.
"Palo Alto and Stanford are being
marketed a lot more," Burt said.
"And we consider that to be a real
asset of the community, to have Stan
ford here."
