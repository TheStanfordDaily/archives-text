# Palo Alto talks heavy budget cuts
## Facing strains, city's proposed budget could cut jobs, services 
### KATHLEEN CHAYKOWSKI STAFF WRITER 
The Palo Alto City Council may pass
nearly $lO million worth of budget cuts
for fiscal year 2011 in response to what
City Manager James Keene described as
unprecedented financial hardships for the
city.

"In contrast to a lot of similar recession
periods, this is deeper and longer-term
than California cities, in my view, have
ever faced," Keene said.

Palo Alto's budget crisis resulted from
rising costs, including salaries, according
to Mayor Pat Burt. Now, if cuts to the
budget are passed, they would reduce
public services citywide and result in the
loss of the equivalent of 75 full-time city
jobs.

Burt said the city expects to face point
ed reaction from community groups
"wanting to come in and argue why their
programs should be preserved." He called
the process "difficult," saying that the
"toughest" budget cut issues to decide will
be the ones with apparent community ob
jection.

Keene has been working with individ
ual city departments over the last six to
nine months to develop a list of 33 poten

tial cuts the city council will vote on this
June.

Palo Alto's deficit has been a recurring
problem. The FY2OII budget gap is pro
jected to be $8.3 million, and the city has
accumulated almost $5OO million in back
log infrastructure needs, according to Vice
Mayor Sid Espinosa.

It is hoped that implementing the $lO
million in FY2OII cuts will reduce the
budget gap for FY2012 to as low as $1 mil
lion, said Greg Scharff, council member
and member of the finance committee.

The 33 potential cuts translate to $10.3
million, an amount that deliberately ex
ceeds the projected $8.3 million FY2OII
gap in order to give council members
some choice in determining where cuts
will ultimately be made.

The budget gap can be attributed to
the city's rising cost of salaries and bene
fits in combination with a decline in tax
revenues, Burt said.

The city's sales tax collection, for ex
ample, fell to $15.9 million in 2009 from
$22.9 million in 2000, while the combined
cost of salaries and benefits rose to $91.9
million from $64.8 million, according to
Scharff.
