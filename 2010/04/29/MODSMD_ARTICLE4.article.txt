## University proposes long-term conservation 
### ELIZABETH ROSEN STAFF WRITER 
As early as mid-July, Stanford and federal
agencies could come one step closer to final
izing a 50-year habitat conservation plan for
the California tiger salamander and other
species on University property.
Federal agencies published the draft pro
posal for Stanford's Habitat Conservation
Plan (HCP), which has been in the works for
almost two decades, on April 16 in the Feder
al Register. This marks the first motion to
ward approval of a plan that Stanford be
lieves will protect animal species living on
University-owned land, such as Lake Laguni
ta and nearby foothills.
The plan, which was developed jointly with
the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Na
tional Oceanic and Atmospheric Administra
tion Fisheries Service, proposes permanent
easements on approximately 360 acres of Uni
versity-owned land along San Francisquito,
Los Trancos, Matadero and Deer Creeks.
The federal government requires
landowners to make plans outlining their mit
igation efforts for activities affecting federal
ly protected species. In return, the govern
ment issues "take" permits for landowners to
undergo such activities construction and
maintenance, for example.
"Take" permits allow landowners to harm
or destroy the habitat of a local species popu
lation as long as they make net-benefit miti
gation efforts.
If approved by the federal agencies, the
plan would cost $500,000 to $600,000 per
year.
"The long term goals are to stabilize and
ultimately increase the populations of
[threatened] species ... [and] the University's
goals include maintaining native biodiversity

on Stanford lands," wrote Catherine Palter,
the associate director of Land Use and Envi
ronmental Planning, in an e-mail to The D aily.
Five species are currently listed for specif
ic coverage by the plan: the California red
legged frog, the California tiger salamander,
the steelhead trout, the Western pond turtle
and the San Francisco garter snake.
The plan would require Stanford to active
ly intervene in several ecosystems to promote
the selected species' survival. The University
would have to remove all structures impeding
steelhead migration routes, construct "bask
ing platforms" for Western pond turtles at
Felt and Searsville reservoirs and provide a
perennial water supply to Lagunita to sup
port salamander breeding while a 315-acre
salamander reserve is established in the lower
foothills.
Philippe Cohen, the administrative direc
tor of Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve at
Stanford, said steep mitigation has been pro
posed to prevent the loss of habitat land. For
every acre of habitat land developed by the
University, three more acres must be set aside
for permanent conservation.
According to Palter, the HCP develop
ment team has estimated a one- to three-acre
loss of habitat a year for 50 years, about four
percent of total habitat land.
Palter, along with Robert Reidy, the vice
president of Land, Buildings and Real Estate,
and Alan Launer, the conservation program
manager in Land Use and Environmental
Planning, wrote in a joint e-mail to The Daily
that Stanford has a long history of conserva
tion activities. A zoology club was established
on campus more than 100 years ago and early
studies of California tiger salamanders began
here in the 19305.
Development of the conserva
tion plan began in the late 1990s with
preliminary discussions between
Stanford and federal conservation
agencies, they said, adding that the
groups involved have been in nearly
constant contact since then.
"The project is very multi
faceted it has a lot of different
heads on it," Cohen said. "Jasper
Ridge, Stanford faculty and admin
istration and government agencies
don't all have the same priorities."
Cohen believes that reconciling
the differing plans and goals of
these diverse institutions has been
one of the greatest difficulties faced
by the plan's developers.
Palter, Reidy and Launer feel
that many potential adversities in
developing the plan were mitigated
by thorough completion of the nec
essary documentation, as well as
professional interaction with feder
al agencies. They wrote that the
most frustrating aspect so far has
been how long it has taken for them
to reach this point.
The HCP is currently in the 90-day
public review period. A public com
ment meeting is scheduled for May 25
at Tresidder, and Stanford plans to
host information meetings on May 6
in Portola Valley and May 13 in Palo
Alto. The public comment ends July
15, after which the federal agencies
will begin the process of deciding
whether or not to approve the HCP.
Palter said if the plan is ap
proved, Stanford would immediate
ly begin implementing the program.
"It's been long overdue, and I'm
really glad to see it finally coming to
fruition," Cohen said.
