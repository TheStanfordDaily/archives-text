## Finance expert weighs regulatory reform 
### MARGARET RAWSON 
On Wednesday afternoon, the same day
Senate Republicans ceded to political pres
sure to allow floor deliberations over finan
cial regulatory reform, former Federal Re
serve board member H. Robert Heller out
lined his proposal for financial market re
form in the second annual Hsieh Memorial
Lecture in Green Library.
As a financial industry veteran with ex
tensive experience in both the public and
private sectors, Heller offered a unique per

spective on current financial reform efforts.
He often cited current financial reform leg
islation before the U.S. Senate, agreeing
with most of its proposals but also question
ing some of its organizational structure.
University Librarian Michael Keller in
troduced Heller, noting that financial re
form is a "topic of instant need and recogni
tion."
A former UCLA economics professor
and senior vice president and director of in
ternational economic research at Bank of
America in San Francisco, Heller was ap

pointed by President Reagan as a member
of the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve, notably serving with former chair
men Paul Volcker and Alan Greenspan. Fol
lowing his time with the Federal Reserve, he
joined VISA International as executive vice
president for finance, risk management,
audit and security and was later elected
president and CEO of VISA U.S.A.

Former Federal Reserve board member H. Robert Heller speaks about financial reform to an audience in Green Library's Bender Room
on Wednesday afternoon at the second annual Hsieh Memorial Lecture, drawing on his experience in the public and private sectors.
ty attendees came to hear Heller
speak on the current bill and his vi
sion for areas in need of reform, a
laundry list which included the struc
ture of the regulatory system, the cur
rent proposed consumer protection
agency, capital requirements, too
big-to-fail financial institutions and
resolution authority, proprietary
trading and the safety of markets for
investors.

"The regulatory system should be
simplified and overlapping jurisdic
tions of the regulatory agencies
should be eliminated," Heller said.
"The proposed legislation accom
plishes that goal to a large extent
at least compared to the current reg
ulatory jungle."
Heller began by stating two princi
ples: that reform should take place in
an internationally consistent frame
work and, reflecting on his regulatory
and private market experience, that
"neither regulators nor private mar
ket participants are infallible."

"Simply calling for more and
more supervision will not make the
banks inherently safer," Heller said.
Instead, safer regulatory infrastruc
ture is needed.
While Heller said the current bill
before the Senate is refreshing in its
attempts to bring clarity and organi
zation to the system, he expressed
concern that the bill's proposed
oversight council won't be effective,
as he fears larger commissions "at
rophy over time and become quiet
backwaters without much power."

He described the resolution au
thority debate over how to deal in
the future with "too-big-to-fail" in
stitutions requiring bailouts as a
Washington turf battle between the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corpo
ration (FDIC) and the Federal Re
serve.

He also advised against housing a
new Consumer Protection Agency in
the Federal Reserve, describing it as
a "budgetary gimmick that will not
help to foster the long-term inde
pendence of the Federal Reserve
System."

On capital requirements, he said,
"Bankers should more explicitly rec
ognize the need for operating capital

in addition to the regulatory mini
mum so that they can weather peri
ods of stress," suggesting that the IRS
could help by letting banks set aside
increased pre-tax funds.
Heller argued against the return
of the Glass-Steagall Act, which sep
arated commercial and investment
banking. Return of this separation
would be a "serious mistake," he said,
as it would reduce diversification.

The forty-five minute talk was fol
lowed by a lively question and an
swer session, during which he was
asked about financial rating agencies
such as Moody's.
"They've done a lousy job," he
commented.
While most audience members
were well-versed experts in the fi
nancial field, some attendees came to
educate themselves about what has
been a pervasive topic in recent news.
"I thought his ideas were all good,
especially raising the capital require
ments for institutions," said commu
nity member Claudia Smith. "I came
to know what's happening and why
we're in the mess we're in."
