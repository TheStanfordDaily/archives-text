## NUCLEAR FAMILY 
### DEVIN BANERJEE SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
When Washington looks for ad
vice on nuclear deterrence,
disarmament and nonprolif
eration, it knows it can look to
Stanford.
Among the crop of nuclear experts who
hold positions at the University, two munched
on popcorn with the president in the White
House movie theater earlier this month, one
co-chaired the panel that produced the De
fense Department's Quadrennial Defense
Review Report in February, one testified in
front of the Senate Foreign Relations Com
mittee in 2008 upon returning from a fifth visit
to North Korea, one serves as a founding
member of a scientific advisory board to the
government and another is a former top secu
rity adviser to the Mongolian government.
And then there are the handful who consis
tently publish, informally advise and passion
ately teach on matters of nuclear policy and
technology every year.
Together, this crop of former policymakers,
advisers and scientists constitutes what many
call one of the country's most concentrated
hubs of nuclear expertise. And with the current
administration's focus on nuclear security, this
hub is consistently being tapped, from 2,500
miles away, by the nation's powers that be.
