George Shultz's Hoover Institution office
looks as if it came straight out of one of the
three national departments he has led as sec
retary: Labor (1969-1970), Treasury (1972-
1974) and State (1982-1989). A rug like that
found in every president's Oval Office lies in
the center of a small seating area. A model of
the Air Force One on which Shultz flew with
Presidents Nixon and Reagan sits on the glass
coffee table. Books, photographs and Wash
ington mementos line the wooden shelves.
And then there is Shultz, impeccably dressed
in a starched shirt and pressed khakis, seated
at a busy yet neat desk by the corner windows.
Just above his head, framed on the wall, is a
personal note from Reagan, thanking Shultz
for his service to the nation.
Shultz, who turns 90 this year, has had had
ties to Stanford since 1968, when he became a
fellow at the Center for Advanced Study in the
Behavioral Sciences. Since rejoining the Uni
versity in 1989, he has published numerous
books, articles and essays on social security,
the economy and his years as Secretary of
State. But in the last few years, his focus has
shifted to what he now calls a lifelong passion:
the threat posed by nuclear weapons.
As a marine fighting in the Pacific theater
of World War 11, Shultz was introduced to nu
clear weapons in the same way the rest of the
world was. Bound for port in California, where

U.S. forces were to be formed into the groups
that would attack the Japanese homeland, he
heard the news.
"Hardly out of port, we heard something
called an atomic bomb had been dropped, and
there wasn't anybody on the ship who had the
vaguest idea of what that was," Shultz recalls.
"Ship sails on, then we hear another one had
been dropped. By the time we hit port in San
Diego, we heard the war was over."
It was, of course, the atomic bombs dropped
on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan, in August
1945. Shultz remembers celebrating the end of
the war, but then coming to the grave realiza
tion that has, since then, inspired him in his
campaign to reduce the threat of nuclear
weapons: "You see the pictures of Hiroshima,
and you say to yourself, what utter devasta
tion."
At Stanford, Shultz has led the organiza
tion of three major conferences centered on
the steps the United States and the rest of the
international community can take to rid the
world of nuclear weapons. The first was held at
the Hoover Institution in October 2006, on the
20th anniversary of the summit at Reykjavik
between President Reagan and Soviet Presi
dent Mikhail Gorbachev. (Shultz sat next to
Reagan there.) The second took place a year
later, and the third was held in September
2009. Hoover is already organizing the fourth,
to be focused on nuclear deterrence, which
will take place Nov. 11-12 of this year.
Today, Shultz also is a member of the
"Gang of Four," a self-proclaimed "nonparti
san" group of former statesmen who, in three
op-ed essays in The Wall Street Journal, have
tried to make the case for a world free of nu
clear weapons to a global audience. Also
members of the group are former Secretary of
State Henry Kissinger and former Senator
Sam Nunn, as well as former Secretary of De
fense William Perry '49 M.S. '5O, a professor at
Stanford's Freeman Spogli Institute for Inter
national Studies and School of Engineering.
Perry served as undersecretary of defense
for research and engineering from 1977 to
1981, under President Carter. He joined the
Stanford faculty in 1988 until, in 1993, he be
came deputy secretary of defense and, a year
later, Secretary of Defense under President
Clinton. Perry returned to Stanford after, he
said, growing frustration with a partisan Con
gress led him to resign in 1997.
Today, Perry, 82, co-teaches an autumn
quarter course called Technology and Nation
al Security and is a frequent and popular
speaker around campus, but he also remains
involved in security-related policy matters.
Defense Secretary Robert Gates chose Perry
to co-chair the Defense Department's Qua
drennial Defense Review earlier this year,
and, along with the remainder of the Gang of
Four, he met twice with President Obama to
discuss the United States' nuclear posture.The
group joined Obama earlier this month in the

White House theater to view "Nuclear Tip
ping Point," a film based on the four states
men's efforts to curb the nuclear threat.
When asked why he left the science and
technology industry to choose the policy path
he did, Perry often quotes Robert Frost: "Two
roads diverged in a wood, and I I took the
one less traveled by, and that has made all the
difference."
