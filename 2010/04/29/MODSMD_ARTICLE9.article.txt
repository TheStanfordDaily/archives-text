"I'm a scientist, not a negotiator or a politi
cian."
Sidney Drell, a theoretical physicist who
has taught at Stanford since 1960, sat behind
stacks of papers in his Hoover office, A stone's
throw from Drell's corner office is another
corner office: that of Shultz "a good
friend."
The two men have lunch together often,
and it was in late 2005, at about Christmas
time, that their discussion reached a tipping
point.
"We were both expressing growing con
cern with nuclear proliferation," Drell said,
picking up a graph that happened to be right in
front of him and tracing with his finger the
number of nuclear weapons over time.
"Knowledge about how to make these
weapons was spreading. In particular, suicidal
terrorists may not be able to build a bomb, but
if they get their hands on the material or on
one of these bombs ..." His finger trailed off
the edge of the page.
The lunch friends decided in 2006 to initi
ate a formal campaign, housed at Stanford, to
initiate steps toward a world free of nuclear
weapons. This campaign resulted in the three
conferences held at Hoover, and Drell served
as the key scientific adviser to the Gang of
Four. The only reason his byline isn't on the
three Wall Street Journal op-eds, Shultz and
Drell said, is because he isn't a former states
man whose name would catch attention.
But Drell has been intimately involved in
the policy implications of science and technol
ogy for the last 50 years. In 1960, a group of
young scientists came together under the be
lief that, according to Drell, "a new generation
of academic scientists who are at the top of
their games should work on national security,"
and he was invited to be a founding member.
Called JASON, the group today is sponsored
by the Department of Defense, the Depart
ment of Energy and U.S. intelligence agencies,
among others, and its mission is to advise the
U.S. government on matters of science and
technology.
During the Cold War, Drell's research at
JASON focused on technical intelligence,
specifically missile detection in the Soviet
Union.
"One always hoped that one could get rid
of them [Soviet and U.S. weapons], but it never
seemed a reality," he said, "and so one was fo

cusing one's efforts on trying to stabilize the
arms race.

"This was difficult because they [the
U.S.S.R.] were operating behind an iron cur
tain," he added. "That's why intelligence was
so important."

Today, Drell continues to advise friends
like Shultz and Perry, but he is, at heart, an ed
ucator. Since 1960, he has never left his Stan
ford professorship (save brief health-related
breaks), even while serving at JASON, on
presidential and other advisory committees
and on several governing boards, including
those of the Los Alamos and Livermore na
tional laboratories. On a Friday afternoon last
week, the 83-year-old could have been found
in a Hoover conference room, hunched by a
young student who was having trouble with
her physics homework.

On the influence of education on policy,
Drell likes to say, "The more you know, the
more likely you are to act intelligently."

It's a mantra that also drives the work of
Siegfried Hecker, co-director of Stanford's
Center for International Security and Cooper
ation (CISAC). From 1986 to 1997, Hecker
served as the fifth director of Los Alamos Na
tional Laboratory, which was founded during
World War II as a secret, centralized facility to
coordinate the scientific research of the Man
hattan Project. J. Robert Oppenheimer,
known as the father of the atomic bomb, was
the laboratory's first director.

A student of materials science, Hecker
never wanted to study nuclear weapons. But
he recalls his first orientation at Los Alamos
in 1968, when he was a post-doctoral fellow
as having a transformative effect on his out
look toward nuclear-related work.

"Then-Director Norris Bradbury stood up
and said, 'We don't build nuclear weapons to
kill people; we build nuclear weapons to buy
time' until the leaders around the world can
resolve the problems in other ways," Hecker
said. "The more I thought about that com
ment, the more it made me feel at ease to con
tribute to the nuclear weapons business."
And that's exactly what he has done for the
last 40 years. While director of the laboratory,
which is owned by the Department of Energy,
Hecker was in Washington every two to three
weeks to brief the Secretary of Energy and
other officials on the lab's work.

"The customer was the U.S. government,
and we were the supplier, specifically our
R&D [research and development]," Hecker
said.

This meant Hecker frequently interacted
with many branches of government, including
the Navy (on missile design), the Pentagon,
the president's science adviser and NASA.
"I wouldn't call it overwhelming," he said.
"But it's what we call a quantum jump from
technology to policy. I was thrown into the pol-
