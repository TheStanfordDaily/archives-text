Understanding (Buddhist Art:
The Thai (Buddhist TemvCe
*
The predominant religion in Thailand is Theravada
Buddhism, the orthodox "lineage of the Elders."
Theravada Buddhist temples are also the most
common form of religious architecture in Thailand,
and their most prominent patrons have traditionally
been Thai kings and nobility. In return, the
Theravada Buddhist order has supplied religious
support and legitimization to Thai kings, and served
an important political function by publicaly
demonstrating the piety of the kings.
In this Saturday seminar, lecturer John Listopad will use a royal foundation of the
mid-19th century as an example, and will explore the doctrinal and religious functions of a
Theravada Buddhist temple. The lecture will also discuss the development of the Thai
Theravada temple in context by comparing it to its counterparts in Sri Lanka, Burma, Laos,
and Cambodia, and how sectarian differences between different schools of Buddhism
affect the planning, art, and architecture of monasteries and temples.
