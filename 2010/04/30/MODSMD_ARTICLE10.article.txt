## Palo Alto bans polystyrene containers 
### ELLEN HUET DESK EDITOR 
Just as compostable serviceware has
permeated eateries on campus, students
who frequent Palo Alto restaurants will
also be seeing biodegradable alternatives
where polystyrene food containers were
once commonplace.
Last Thursday also Earth Day a
citywide ban on polystyrene food con

tainers, most often seen in their brand
form, Styrofoam, took effect in Palo Alto,
pushing restaurants, grocery stores and
other businesses to provide compostable
serviceware for one-time use needs as
part of a larger ongoing city effort to re
duce waste and provide sustainable alter
natives for everyday needs.
"The larger goal is to restrict plastics
ending up in the bay and the open ocean,"
explained Phil Bobel, Palo Alto's envi

ronmental compliance manager. "There,
they break into small pieces and don't de
compose, and animals may eat the plas
tics, resulting in death by starvation and
malnutrition."
The ordinance was adopted by the
City Council almost a year ago, in May,
but the city decided to wait a year to give
restaurants the chance to run out their
supplies of polystyrene containers
before enacting the ban. Most restau
rants, though, said they only needed
three to four months to use up their
stock, Bobel explained.
Palo Alto's effort has been greet
ed enthusiastically by students in
volved in sustainablity on campus.

Milena Gonzalez 'l2, fundraising
director of Engineers for a Sustain
able World, called the ban a "strong
move toward a more sustainable city
environment."
The ban comes "late in the sense
that we have known for years that
polystyrene is a material that does
not biodegrade, since it's a plastic,
and a material that causes great chal
lenges to recycle," Gonzalez wrote in
an e-mail to The Daily. But, she said,
perhaps more cities would take up
the same move.

"On the whole, I'm in support of
the ban," wrote Students for a Sus
tainable Stanford Outreach Officer
Leah Kuritzky 'lO in an e-mail to The
Daily. "Styrofoam makes up a rela
tively small portion of the waste
stream, particularly by mass because
it's so lightweight, but I'm glad that
the city is taking steps to remove it
completely."
Stanford's campus eateries, in
cluding Tresidder Union, Olive's and
Axe & Palm have already made the
transition to completely com

postable serviceware with accompa
nying compost bins, an ongoing effort
for campus sustainability groups.
The same challenges that faced
Stanford in implementing com
postable serviceware may also affect
Palo Alto eateries in the future.
"I think the greatest challenge
that Stanford faces is educating the
campus population about the ecolog
ical and economical benefits of recy
cling and on how to dispose of things
correctly," Gonzalez said. She also
noted that Stanford's many campus
visitors are also a challenge because
they are not used to the system, and
said that this might also be a problem
for Palo Alto, which receives a signif
icant number of tourists and visitors.
"Since the logistical shift, the
biggest challenges have been con
sumer education and engineering of
locations and signage of the bins to
help make the transition easy and
clear," Kuriztsky said. "The ban on
Styrofoam will probably be an easier
transition than a shift to composta
bles, because it requires only compli
ance by the vendors, and does not
rely on consumers."
Bobel, however, felt that the city is
ready to phase out polystyrene with
out too much trouble, pointing out
that the next steps lie in bigger goals
for sustainability.
"We're kind of done with Styro
foam food containers," he said. The
next step, he said, is arranging for
home pickup of food waste a serv
ice currently not provided by the city.
"Right now, if you take a com
postable container home, there's not
much you can do but throw it out," he
said. If residents have a regular pick
up service for food waste, they would
be able to compost food waste from
home as well as compostable con
tainers brought home from business
es.
"It's not going to come soon,
though," Bobel said. "It would really
drive up garbage costs."
Bobel said enforcement of the
ban will be worked into current
restaurant inspection workforces.
"We don't think [enforcing poly
styrene ban] will take new city
funds," Bobel said. "We already have
people doing inspections for compli
ance with other measures."
Although restaurants will be in
spected regularly, smaller food serv
ices such as motels, business cafete
rias, mobile food vendors and city
fairs might not be. Instead, enforce
ment for the rest of businesses will
work on a customer complaint basis.
"We've really been trying to pub
licize the change, and it seems like
residents are really interested,"
Bobel said, expressing confidence
that if customers know of the new
ban, they will report businesses that
do not follow the guidelines.
