## A 						Greek tragedy? 
### JOSHUA FALK 
Last week, amid financial turmoil,
Greek Prime Minister George A.
Papandreou requested an inter
national bailout to rescue his
country's faltering economy.
On Tuesday, Greece's credit was
downgraded to junk status by a leading rat
ings agency. Public sector workers who
generate 40 percent of GDP demonstrated
in Athens after the Greek parliament pro
posed pay cuts for government employees.
The crisis has also strained the relationship
between Greece and the European Union.
Yet despite Greece's economic woes,
Stanford's roughly 36 students from
Greece remain largely unaffected by the flj
crisis.
All but four of them are graduate stu
dents. Most either receive financial sup
port from the University or come from rel
atively affluent families that can afford
Stanford tuition.
Penytina Dimitropoulou, a first-year
master's student in management science and
engineering from Athens, says that her par
ents are not likely to be impacted by the crisis,
despite working in the public sector. Her
mother is an electrical engineer and her father
is a professor.
"They have high salaries for the public sec
tor, so they're not so directly influenced by the
situation," Dimitropoulou said.
But the crisis will likely have a larger im
pact on the family of George Roumpos, a
sixth-year graduate student in physics, origi
nally from the northern city of Kavala. His fa
ther, mother and sister all work in the public
sector.
"Their salaries are going to be reduced,"
Roumpos said.
Despite the fact that Roumpos' family
would be hurt by the pay cuts and the increase
in retirement age for public-sector work
ers proposed by the Greek parlia
ment, he pointed out that these

measures were necessary.
"These are the first meas
ures that they can take," he
said. "But then probably that's
not going to be enough."

Dimitropoulou agreed that salary cuts
were necessary, saying that they were "the
only way."

And despite the demonstrations that have
taken place, Dimitropoulou thought the ma
jority of Greeks supported the cost-saving
measures proposed by the Greek parliament.
Roumpos, however, emphasized that sys
temic problems with the Greek economy
were to blame for the crisis.
"So many people work for the public sec
tor, and there are not so many new companies
producing new stuff like here in the Bay
Area," Roumpos added. "It's kind of an out
dated economic model. Greece doesn't pro
duce much."

Stanford economics professor Monika Pi
azzesi added that the Greek government is
stuck in a bit of a political quagmire.
"The government has run fiscal deficits for
a long time, and the way they have done this is
that they pay high salaries to the government
employees and they have not reduced pen
sions to government employees," she said.
"Whenever the government announces some
kind of a cutback they're facing big protests
and strikes. And so they're in a somewhat
weak bargaining position with their own con
stituencies."
Piazzesi emphasized the moral hazard that
the European bailout of Greece will create.

"If the European Union is bailing out Greece,
why shouldn't they also bail out Portugal and
Ireland?" she argued. "Why should these gov
ernments have any savings plans? Why should
they do unpopular measures, measures that
are clearly unpopular with their people?"
If states come to expect a bailout, she con
tinued, there would be no reason for them to
take already unpopular steps to reduce their
deficits.
"It's bad; it's going to create all kinds of in
centive problems," she said.
Although the Greek debt crisis has yet to
impact Dimitropoulou's family directly, it has
affected her plans for next year.

"My initial plan was to go back to Greece in
September," she said. "Now I will extend my
studies until December in order to have time
to look for a job here in the fall quarter."
Roumpos says that he had decided not to
return to Greece after finishing his Ph.D. even
before the crisis.
"To be honest, I had already made the de
cision not to go back if I can find a good job
here or somewhere else," Roumpos said. "But
probably that's going to make things easier
I mean, talking to my parents. You know, I
have a better argument now."
