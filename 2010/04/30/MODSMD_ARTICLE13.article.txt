I and energy operations
Prof. Jane Woodward in
Thursday's talk entitled "Meeting the
Energy and Environmental Chal
lenge."
The presentation, put on by mem
bers of the China Energy Systems
Field Trip class CEE 276F was
an overview of the group's trip to
China to study energy systems.
Despite inhabiting a land area
comparable in size to the United
States, China's population is five times
larger, and the majority lives in an area

half the size of the U.S. Consider the
nine percent annual economic
growth, and the necessary supporting
energy, electricity, urbanization and
manpower, and one can begin to get
an idea of just how huge it is. That scale
and rapid development of
China is what makes it a pivotal play
er in the global energy system.
Over spring break, 30 Stanford
students traveled from the capital,
Beijing, to the far reaches of Inner
Mongolia, Yichang, Shanghai and
seven provinces in between. Led by
Woodward and Director of Sustain
able Energy Education Karl Knapp,
the Energy Systems Field Trip class,
offered every other winter quarter,
provides a unique opportunity for a
more "hands on" approach to energy

education.
"Students studying energy typical
ly have fewer opportunities to see en
ergy facilities for themselves, or to talk
to decision makers in person," said
Knapp and Woodward in a written
overview of the trip. "Our visit to
China is an effort to correct this unfor
tunate trend."

MAP Royalty, a private firm that
acquires and manages natural gas and
renewable energy royalties, played a
large role in funding the trip as one of
its sustainable energy education initia
tives.

The trip proved to be an unforget
table experience for all students in
volved. Whether it was the largest dam
in the world, the leading solar thermal
manufacturer or the most efficient
coal power plant, the students were
able to witness and apply the facts that
they had learned in a real physical
context all in just 12 days.
As United flight 889 descended
into the Beijing airport, an unfamiliar
sight greeted the students. Land use
zoning regulations seemed nearly
non-existent, as industrial complexes,
garbage dumps, residential areas and
sheep pastures all adjacent to one
another dotted the landscape
below.

Once they touched down, the 30
students, groggy with jetlag and armed
with foreign visitor forms, slowly filed
through customs. After Charlie Lan
nin 'fl was briefly detained by Chi
nese authorities something about a
stuffy nose the buses were loaded,
and the students traveled into the
dusty, smoggy, coal-filled country that
awaited them.
24 hours, an acrobat show, a duck
dinner complete with duck brain
—, and two Tiananmen Square and
Forbidden City tours later, the class
met with some of the energy experts
whose policies they had studied exten
sively in the winter quarter class.
In a traditional Chinese teahouse,
the group met with representatives
from the Natural Resources Defense
Council (NRDC), a U.S. environmen
talNGO with offices in Beijing. Wood
ward's relationship with the NGO is
what inspired the trip, and the meeting
began to contextualize China's expan

sive energy system.
Over the next 10 days, the class
squeezed in an exceptional amount of
visits centered on energy. One such
sight was the renowned Three Gorges
Dam. The dam disappears into the
mist as it spans the Yangtze while
housing an endless quantity of cement
and innumerable transmission lines.
"[lt's] like the Hoover Dam, ex
cept five times as long, just as high and
generating] more than 10 times the
power," Millstein said.
Another highlight was the 5 GW
coal power plant outside of Shanghai,
which pumps out enough juice to pro
vide 10 percent of California's peak
power demand. With ultra super-criti
cal (i.e. "clean") coal technology, the
Waigaoqiao Coal Power Plant is the
second largest and most efficient
coal plant in the world.
The class also toured renewable
power and manufacturing plants, pri
marily wind and solar facilities. "We
dream that all Chinese people know
and consume solar energy," read a
billboard for Himin Solar, China's
dominant solar thermal manufactur
er. In a visit to Himin's Dezhou head
quarters, the students encountered
the dream in the form of a solar valley:
a half-built city complete with high
end condos and a resort, running al
most entirely on renewable energy.

But throughout the trip, the lack
of visible sunlight in China left the
group with some questions about the
source of this energy. With the "super
efficient" coal power plants, abun
dant renewable energy resources
and government incentives for clean
power, it's easy to forget that two
new coal plants are coming online
every week in China until you go
outside.
"No sun either," Millstein ex
plained. "Just an angry, red blotch fu
tilely trying to break through the
gray-yellow mono-cloud of particu
late matter holding the world hostage
in the strong arms of haze."
12 days, seven provinces, five
power plants, two manufacturing
plants and an endless amount of par
ticulate matter exposure later, the
class boarded the plane back to San
Francisco.

Despite the dominance of coal
visible in sky and city the trip
showed how committed China cur
rently is to a renewable energy future.
Through scale, speed and low cost
themes reiterated in Thursday's pres
entation China is rapidly develop
ing an expansive renewable energy
system.

As United flight 889 descended
into the Beijing airport, an unfamiliar
sight greeted the students. Land use
zoning regulations seemed nearly
non-existent, as industrial complexes,
garbage dumps, residential areas and
sheep pastures all adjacent to one
another dotted the landscape
below.

Once they touched down, the 30
students, groggy with jetlag and armed
with foreign visitor forms, slowly filed
through customs. After Charlie Lan
nin 'fl was briefly detained by Chi
nese authorities something about a
stuffy nose the buses were loaded,
and the students traveled into the
dusty, smoggy, coal-filled country that
awaited them.
24 hours, an acrobat show, a duck
dinner complete with duck brain
—, and two Tiananmen Square and
Forbidden City tours later, the class
met with some of the energy experts
whose policies they had studied exten
sively in the winter quarter class.
In a traditional Chinese teahouse,
the group met with representatives
from the Natural Resources Defense
Council (NRDC), a U.S. environmen
talNGO with offices in Beijing. Wood
ward's relationship with the NGO is
what inspired the trip, and the meeting
began to contextualize China's expan

sive energy system.
Over the next 10 days, the class
squeezed in an exceptional amount of
visits centered on energy. One such
sight was the renowned Three Gorges
Dam. The dam disappears into the
mist as it spans the Yangtze while
housing an endless quantity of cement
and innumerable transmission lines.
"[lt's] like the Hoover Dam, ex
cept five times as long, just as high and
generating] more than 10 times the
power," Millstein said.
Another highlight was the 5 GW
coal power plant outside of Shanghai,
which pumps out enough juice to pro
vide 10 percent of California's peak
power demand. With ultra super-criti
cal (i.e. "clean") coal technology, the
Waigaoqiao Coal Power Plant is the
second largest and most efficient
coal plant in the world.
The class also toured renewable
power and manufacturing plants, pri
marily wind and solar facilities. "We
dream that all Chinese people know
and consume solar energy," read a
billboard for Himin Solar, China's
dominant solar thermal manufactur
er. In a visit to Himin's Dezhou head
quarters, the students encountered
the dream in the form of a solar valley:
a half-built city complete with high
end condos and a resort, running al
most entirely on renewable energy.

But throughout the trip, the lack
of visible sunlight in China left the
group with some questions about the
source of this energy. With the "super
efficient" coal power plants, abun
dant renewable energy resources
and government incentives for clean
power, it's easy to forget that two
new coal plants are coming online
every week in China until you go
outside.
"No sun either," Millstein ex
plained. "Just an angry, red blotch fu
tilely trying to break through the
gray-yellow mono-cloud of particu
late matter holding the world hostage
in the strong arms of haze."
12 days, seven provinces, five
power plants, two manufacturing
plants and an endless amount of par
ticulate matter exposure later, the
class boarded the plane back to San
Francisco.

Despite the dominance of coal
visible in sky and city the trip
showed how committed China cur
rently is to a renewable energy future.
Through scale, speed and low cost
themes reiterated in Thursday's pres
entation China is rapidly develop
ing an expansive renewable energy
system.

Over spring break, the 30 members of the China Energy Systems Field Trip
class traveled to China to study the country's energy infrastructure. In 12
days, the students toured and met with countless energy organizations.
