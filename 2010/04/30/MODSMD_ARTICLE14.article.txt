~w~ T buntu: lam because you are. It is a South African
# / concept based on the idea that no human being
Ly can exist in isolation. To have Übuntu is to ap
preciate human interconnectedness, to share in each
other's pains and pleasures by virtue of belonging to a
greater human family.

We see this concept in cultures the world over, even
in the cyberworld the free and open source software
Übuntu is named after it. Hinduism has the concept of
Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam, envisioning the world as a
global village. One of the dorms at Stanford, Ujamaa, is
named after the Swahili word for familyhood, empha
sizing that a person becomes a person through her peo
ple and community. John Donne, the Christian poet and
minister, proclaimed in a sermon that "no man is an is
land" and that the death of any individual diminishes all
members of mankind. Martin Luther King, Jr. once de
scribed the human condition as being caught in an "in
escapable network of mutuality."

This idea of interconnectedness can find its strong
holds in spiritual and literary traditions around the
world. But such talk is no longer reserved for moments
when we are reading poetry or discussing faith. Today, it
seems to have penetrated into the mainstream in a seri
ous way. Leaders are increasingly speaking of how our
existence is connected to the existence of others, justify
ing good works by the stake we all have in the welfare of
our fellow beings.

For example, Bill Clinton often invokes the term
Übuntu in his speeches. He will reference how scientists
sequenced the human genome during his presidency,
showing that human genetic makeup is 99.9 percent the
same. He uses this paradigm to discourage us from con
centrating on our differences, arguing that they consti
tute just one tenth of one percent. Barack Obama made
a similar point in his Nobel Peace Prize acceptance
speech. He reminded us that we are all, as humans, "ba
sically seeking the same things .. . [hoping] for the
chance to live out our lives with some measure of hap
piness and fulfillment for ourselves and our families." In
this light, he urged for the "continued expansion of our
moral imagination" and "an insistence that there's
something irreducible that we all share."
It is interesting to consider how particular these mes
sages are to our time. Bill Gates often talks about how he
was not aware of the gross inequities in the world when
he was our age, telling students that today we know more
and therefore must do more. But when he speaks of
knowledge, he is not really just talking about being in
formed that there are people born into suffering sure
ly he knew that when he was 20 years old. He is talking
about possessing an awareness of our shared identity, a
sense that the problems of people in another corner of
the world or an inner-city ghetto are our problems. He is

talking about the fact that many young people today
connect their identity to the identity of all people.
The sense of urgency that accompanies this aware
ness is all around us. A huge number of students apply
to Teach for America each year, wear FACE AIDS pins
on their shirts and backpacks, participate in public serv
ice and speak with knowledge and passion about the
world's biggest problems. Individuals whose identity is
rooted in a strong tradition of faith have long felt this ur
gency. But today the urgency is not restricted to any par
ticular sect or holy day - many young people even re
sent the suggestion that we need to belong to a spiritual
tradition in order to care.
The downside to all this energy is a feeling of helpless
ness among students. Despite how commonly students
try to make a difference, there is so much doubt about
whether we do make a difference, even whether we can.
We listen to leaders tell us of the need to solve over
whelmingly big problems such as global warming, bil
lions of people without enough to eat, high population
growth that shows little signs of abating, so many mil
lions dying from diseases that have been eradicated in
the western world and the list goes on. Much of what
we do is barely a band-aid on these big problems.
On a service-learning trip over spring break, with a
group that was a bit like a microcosm of Stanford stu
dents, many expressed feeling overwhelmed by the prob
lems we face and our slight ability to affect them. One stu
dent sought to allay all these feelings when he gathered
the group together on our last night with a message; he
said that our worth is not determined by our particular
accomplishments or grades, but rather by the feeling we
have that there are problems to tackle and that we cannot
stand idly by. This sense of urgency that exists among so
many students, the fact that Übuntu has become a power
ful concept to us, is the most exciting and hopeful attrib
ute of our generation. The biggest challenge has always
been getting people to care - we have made serious in
roads in tackling that one.
