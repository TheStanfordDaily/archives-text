# MIDNIGHT FRYER
## Bodily Seduction: War and Peace 
### Yanran Lu 
As I was sitting outside one day, I was graced by the
presence of a couple so gorgeous I felt like I was
intruding on a billboard photo campaign. I felt
dazzled by their hotness, but also incompetent compared
to their immensurable awesomeness. After I overcame
some of my starstruck-ness, I realized that the pure hot
ness I often observed at Stanford was part genetic and
part work. Anyone familiar with Arrillaga? I was perhaps
one of the very few people unfamiliar with it. Heard of
the Freshman 15? I was also one of the few people who
thought it was a myth. People apparently ate salads and
went to the gym religiously. The beautiful bodies that I
thought were just genetic lottery winners actually re
quired work on the part of their owners.
The idea that we have active control over the appear
ance of our bodies was, perhaps, a dangerous one. I was in
a blissful ignorance before. I was raised to eat three meals
a day (no snacks) and was enrolled for weekend dance
classes, one of the extracurriculars that got me into Stan
ford. So as others ate salads, I ate cookies and steaks (and
greens I do believe in a balanced diet). When others
ordered herbal tea, I ordered a latte with an indulgent
piece of cake. The realization that people actually
worked to get their bodies made me feel guilty about
what I ate and how I never went to the gym.
To challenge how much I could get by without "calo
rie counting," I sometimes ate about 3500 calories a day
between Dim Sum and Doners while studying in Berlin.
Of course, I packed on the pounds. Consequently I felt
miserable that I no longer looked as good as I had before.
So I binged to forget my misery. But knowing that I was
just going to pack on more pounds, I became more de
pressed. Then it snowballed. I stopped having a healthy
relationship with food. Instead of eating three meals a
day, I oscillated between binging and starving mis
treating my body and never being happy with how it
looked.
So I told people that I wanted to lose about 30 pounds
from 137 pounds to 110. The image of attractive Asian
girls I was bombarded with were 17 years old, 165 cm
(5'5") and at 45kg (100 pounds), they still came with
curves. Therefore, 110 lbs at 5'5" was a "realistic" goal.
Upon telling my guy friends about this, they made me feel
like I was crazy because I looked just fine. Then they
went off on how they lost so much (muscle) weight upon
coming to Berlin, how they do not have six-packs any
more or how they are not as big as before. Then I became
the person who thought they were crazy because they
looked good just as they were.
Then it hit me we are never going to be happy with
our bodies if we are not happy with them right now. My
body has done no wrong to me, yet I have been abusing
it, blaming it for not living up to an unrealistic ideal of
perfection. If I am thin, I complain that I am not as thin as
the Olsen sisters. If I am fit, I complain that I don't have
Jessica Alba's abs. If I have curves, I complain that I could
never be as curvy as Beyonce or Nicki Minaj. There are
things that I cannot have no matter how hard I work or
how much I beat my body up. Everyone has his or her
own genome that determines how he or she could look.
To my chagrin, I was never meant to look like Nicki
Minaj. I could probably get Alba-abs if I worked hard
enough, but let's be real no one is paying me the big
bucks to do that.

Therefore, I told myself that it was justifiable to com
pare my body against what it looked like before when I
was sixteen. Yet that thinking is still flawed and leaves me
unhappy. I am older, so my metabolism has slowed down.
I have stopped being as active as I was before (this is par
ticularly true for athletes who stopped doing team
sports) and I started drinking (yay, a hundred invisible
calories per shot). Therefore, my body burns fewer calo
ries in rest. I am taking in more calories (my normal diet,
snacking, and drinking); and I am using less (fewer dance
hours). Expecting myself now to look like when I was six
teen is simply unreasonable. It was not my fault. Thus,
when I learned to stop beating myself up for not looking
a particular way and embracing myself, I became a lot
happier and returned to my "happy weight." I stopped
feeling guilty for not caring about my body image be
cause who is society to tell me that I need "to lose 10
pounds in 30 days" or "look better in bed?" I do not need
the seductively packaged message that I have to feel bad
about my body in order to fit in. The only thing I have to
say when people complain about their bodies is,"Shut up,
LOVE YOUR BODY unconditionally and treat it with
respect!"
