## BREAKING THE SLIDE 
### KABIR SAWHNEY DESK EDITOR 
After a tough stretch that saw it lose seven
straight games, the Stanford Softball team start
ed to get back on track with a win over San Jose
State on Tuesday. The No. 14 Cardinal (31-12,4-
8 Pac-10) jumped out to an early lead and never
looked back, cruising to a 4-1 win.
Offensively, Stanford was led once again by
senior left fielder Alissa Haber and sophomore
second baseman Ashley Hansen. Haber went 1-
2 with two walks and two RBIs, while Hansen
went 1-4 with an RBI. Overall, Stanford's lineup

rebounded well after being dominated by
UCL As pitching staff last weekend the team
went 7-24 and drew four walks while only sur
rendering two strikeouts.
On the other side, San Jose State went with a
succession of three pitchers against the Stanford
lineup. Starter Amanda Pridmore gave up all
four runs in 3.2 innings of pitching before being
replaced by Jaclyn Imhof. Jennifer Ames fin
ished the game with 0.1 innings at the tail end.
After surrendering 27 runs as a team to the
Bruins last weekend, Stanford's pitchers des
perately needed a strong game to bounce back.
The staff has struggled since the loss of fresh

man Teagan Gerhart to injury two weeks ago.
Prior to her injury, Gerhart had been the an
chor of the team, with a 22-6 record and a 1.67
ERA.
Junior pitcher Ashley Chinn, who took the
brunt of last weekend's onslaught, pitched all
seven innings well against the Spartans. She
gave up five hits and only one run, which was
unearned, while throwing 114 pitches. Chinn
also threw five strikeouts in the game.
Second baseman Julianne Aiello led San
Jose State offensively, going 2-2 with an RBI
while drawing a walk, one of only two issued by
Chinn in the entire game.

Errors also figured prominently in the game
for both teams. The Spartans committed three
errors while the Cardinal committed two.
Control has also been one of the bigger
problems for the Stanford pitching staff of late
Chinn gave up 10 walks to the Bruins last
weekend. Her outing against San Jose State
may mark a return to form, which will be crucial
for the remainder of Stanford's schedule.
The next test for the Cardinal will come this
weekend, when it hosts No. 9 Arizona State (37-
10,6-6). The Sun Devils are coming off a 2-1 se
ries win against Oregon and are fifth in the con
ference standings, two games ahead of the sev
enth-place Cardinal. In addition, Arizona State
swept UCLA in Los Angeles three weeks ago.
On the mound, Arizona State will counter
Chinn with pitcher Hillary Bach, who won both
of the Sun Devils' games against the Ducks last
weekend and has an 18-4 record on the season.
Bach will try to contain Haber and Hansen to
get the upper hand on a Cardinal lineup that will
look to build on its performance against San
Jose State.
Meanwhile, Chinn will look to contain a Sun
Devil lineup that has played very well as of late,
scoring 20 runs in its last three games. She will
face a particular challenge with the top two bat
ters for ASU, center fielder Lesley Rogers and
designated player Taylor Haro.
The first game against Arizona State is on
Lriday at 7 p.m., with games on Saturday and
Sunday as well. All three games will be played at
Smith Family Stadium.

GAME NOTES ! After snapping its seven-game losing streak
with a win over San Jose State, the Cardinal returns to
Pac-10 competition against Arizona State. Stanford is
seventh in the conference while the Sun Devils stand at
fifth, so the Cardinal has a good chance to move up in
the standings. It will rely on junior pitcher Ashley Chinn to
shut down the powerful Arizona State offense.

Junior pitcher Ashley Chinn (above) has anchored Stanford's pitching staff since the loss of freshman Teagan Gerhart to injury two weeks ago. In
its past two conference series, the Cardinal has struggled to contain opposing offenses, giving up 27 runs in three games to UCLA last weekend.
