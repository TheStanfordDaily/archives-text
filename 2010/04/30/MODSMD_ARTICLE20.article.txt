## Women's water polo opens MPSF Tournament 
### â€“ Kabir Sawhney 
A victory over USC last weekend gave the Stanford women's
water polo team (22-1,7-0 MPSF) the regular season Mountain Pa
cific Sports Federation (MPSF) championship and allowed the
team to reclaim the No. 1 national ranking. Heading into the con
ference tournament, the Card has the top seed and will play eighth-

seeded Arizona State in the
first round.
The tournament is being
held at UCLA's Spieker
Aquatics Center in Los An
geles.
Last weekend, Stanford
faced then-No. 1 USC (20-
1,6-1) in a dramatic match
at Avery Aquatics Center.
Though it fell behind 4-1
in the second half, the
Card continued to battle.
It was able to force an
overtime period and even
tually prevailed, taking
the match 7-6.
Stanford is set to face
the No. 9 Sun Devils (16-12,
0-7 MPSF). In addition to
its winless record in confer
ence play, Arizona State is
1-12 overall against MPSF

GAME NOTES: The No. 1 Cardinal opens play
in the MPSF tournament this weekend as its
top seed, after grabbing the conference's
regular season title and the No. 1 national
ranking from USC with a win last weekend.
Arizona State should not pose much of a
challenge to Stanford; the Sun Devils have
gone a combined 1-12 against the rest of
the conference this season, including two
losses to Stanford already this season.
