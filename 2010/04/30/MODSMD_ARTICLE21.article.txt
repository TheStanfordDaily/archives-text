# Stanford's Freshman League
## 
### Danny Bett On My Mind 
Let's organize Stanford into a
campus sports league, and
let's focus on all the dorms
with freshmen in them the
Freshman League.
We have the Wilbur Conference,
made up of J-Ro, Cedro, Arroyo, fran
cos, Soto, Okada, Rinconada and Otero.
This conference would be compared to
the AL East of baseball, the NFC East of
football. It has some top talent and some
solid teams. While these teams are to
ward the far end of the country so
other teams have to travel decently far
to play them they are the hub of
young Stanford talent.
The poster child of the Wilbur Con
ference is a toss-up between Otero and
Rinconada. While a bitter rivalry exists
between them every time the teams
meet, both teams are looking for that
special recognition as "the" team of the
conference. While Cedro and J-Ro have
made some challenges to the top spot,
their efforts have largely been futile.
Watch out for Soto and Trancos, though.
Both have undergone large restructur
ings within their organizations and
teams, hoping to position themselves as
legitimate challengers to the
Rinc/Otero duopoly. Okada is quite the
enigma, but nonetheless a team to watch
out for. You would be smart to relate
Okada to any mid-major team in college
basketball sometimes unnoticed,
sometimes underrepresented, but hav
ing solid players that go on to successful
careers in the higher leagues.
We also have the Stern Conference,
featuring Twain, Burbank, Casa Zapata,
Larkin, Donner and Serra. The Stern
Conference and Wilbur Conference are
rivals themselves, kind of like the NFC
and AFC North in football, or simply the
Eastern and Western Conferences in
basketball. Stern has perhaps the top
team of them all in Donner. Donner
consistently fields outstanding pro
grams coupled with superior team man
agement. A common knock on Donner,
however, is that its players sometimes
aren't as focused on winning champi
onships as they are on socializing and
dealing with their personal lives. Many
on team Donner use the team as a step
ping-stone into the other league the
SAL League (formerly called the OSA
League) and especially into the
Greek Conference.
But besides Donner, the Stern Con
ference does have some quality teams.
Serra is a rising program, and Larkin has
been consistently solid for many years
now. In fact, some view Larkin as the top
team in the Stern Conference because it
has more focus than Donner. Burbank,
Twain and Casa Zapata are not as strong
as some others in the Stern Conference
perhaps they lack the team resources
and team following but are, nonethe
less, able to hold their own. Both Bur
bank and Twain have been able to score
some big wins over some tough com
petitors— namely Roble and Otero
just a few weeks ago but have also
suffered some tough losses to the likes of
West Lag and Naranja.
Finally, the Miscellanea Conference,
featuring Roble, West Lag, Naranja and
FroSoCo.The smallest conference in the
Freshman League definitely has a bit of
an uphill battle when faced with some
teams from the Stern and Wilbur con
ferences. In addition, the Miscellanea
Conference has been drowning in alle
gations of using illegal players. There is
an age limit in the Freshman League
and some teams who will not be
mentioned here due to privacy issues
havebeenfoundtobeusing players who
are one or two years over the age limit.
This has hindered the Miscellanea Con
ference teams from truly reaching their
potential. Because when they do get into
a groove, they almost always find them
selves bogged down in another scandal.
Additionally, it is a strain on the fi
nancial resources of the Miscellanea
Conference for its teams to travel to play
games in the Stern and Wilbur Confer
ence. It is nearly impossible for a team
like FroSoCo to travel to J-Ro and ex
pect a good result, given the time
change, the players having to adjust and,
simply, a new surrounding. However,
this distance also works to the Miscel
lanea Conference's advantage, as teams
who travel to their home sites often
struggle to adapt quickly and effectively.
Ibis is why teams in the Miscellanea
Conference have been able to come
away with some big wins and big upsets
further cementing the Miscellanea

Conference's right to stay in the Fresh
man League and not get demoted. The
biggest win in Miscellanea Conference
history and perhaps the history of
the Freshman League came in 2005
when West Lag went into the Stern

Conference and beat then-No. 1 Don
ner. West Lag was missing one of its best
players and still was able to beat the
Donner team, leaving Donner and the
whole Freshman League stunned a la
Stanford-USC, USA Hockey-USSR
and Michigan-Appalachian State, It
took at least a year for Donner to fully
recover.

Finally, we cannot forget the failed
team of the Freshman League Bran
ner. The story of Branner is truly one of

tragedy one of the most well-liked,
well-run teams with a large roster and
happy players just couldn't cut it in the
Freshman League. While some say it is
due to the arrogance of the Branner
players and staff, others point to the fact
that there was no clear leadership with
in the team everyone at Branner
thought they knew what was best for the
team and for its position in the league.
Ultimately, Branner crumbled under it
self, but its demise had been looking

pretty inevitable for a while. Former
Branner players have expressed their
dismay at Branner's disbanding, but
some have come to terms and realized
that after being removed from the team
for a while, something at Branner just
wasn't right.

19505. Give him a history lesson at

bank and Twain have been able to score
some big wins over some tough com
petitors— namely Roble and Otero
just a few weeks ago but have also
suffered some tough losses to the likes of
West Lag and Naranja.
Finally, the Miscellanea Conference,
featuring Roble, West Lag, Naranja and
FroSoCo.The smallest conference in the
Freshman League definitely has a bit of
an uphill battle when faced with some
teams from the Stern and Wilbur con
ferences. In addition, the Miscellanea
Conference has been drowning in alle
gations of using illegal players. There is
an age limit in the Freshman League
and some teams who will not be
mentioned here due to privacy issues
havebeenfoundtobeusing players who
are one or two years over the age limit.
This has hindered the Miscellanea Con
ference teams from truly reaching their
potential. Because when they do get into
a groove, they almost always find them
selves bogged down in another scandal.
Additionally, it is a strain on the fi
nancial resources of the Miscellanea
Conference for its teams to travel to play
games in the Stern and Wilbur Confer
ence. It is nearly impossible for a team
like FroSoCo to travel to J-Ro and ex
pect a good result, given the time
change, the players having to adjust and,
simply, a new surrounding. However,
this distance also works to the Miscel
lanea Conference's advantage, as teams
who travel to their home sites often
struggle to adapt quickly and effectively.
Ibis is why teams in the Miscellanea
Conference have been able to come
away with some big wins and big upsets
further cementing the Miscellanea

Conference's right to stay in the Fresh
man League and not get demoted. The
biggest win in Miscellanea Conference
history and perhaps the history of
the Freshman League came in 2005
when West Lag went into the Stern

Conference and beat then-No. 1 Don
ner. West Lag was missing one of its best
players and still was able to beat the
Donner team, leaving Donner and the
whole Freshman League stunned a la
Stanford-USC, USA Hockey-USSR
and Michigan-Appalachian State, It
took at least a year for Donner to fully
recover.

Finally, we cannot forget the failed
team of the Freshman League Bran
ner. The story of Branner is truly one of

tragedy one of the most well-liked,
well-run teams with a large roster and
happy players just couldn't cut it in the
Freshman League. While some say it is
due to the arrogance of the Branner
players and staff, others point to the fact
that there was no clear leadership with
in the team everyone at Branner
thought they knew what was best for the
team and for its position in the league.
Ultimately, Branner crumbled under it
self, but its demise had been looking

pretty inevitable for a while. Former
Branner players have expressed their
dismay at Branner's disbanding, but
some have come to terms and realized
that after being removed from the team
for a while, something at Branner just
wasn't right.

Danny Belch probably doesn't remem
ber the great Trancos dynasty of the
19505. Give him a history lesson at
dbelchl @stanford.edu.
