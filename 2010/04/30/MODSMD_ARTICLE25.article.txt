# "Oceans" Fails to Stay Afloat

One year ago, Earth Day
2009,1 excitedly ventured
to see Disney Nature's
new documentary film, "Earth,"
only to be disappointed by the
abundance of repetitive footage
extracted from the phenomenal
television series "Planet Earth."
Although I certainly did not rave
about this previous film, I have to
admit, the moment I saw the
trailer for Disney Nature's next
production, "Oceans," I was once
again stoked. I just can't resist a
good nature film. This French-
American documentary, directed
by Jacques Perrin, once again
explores the beautiful scenery of
our vast planet; however, as the
title clearly suggests, this time, we
are exposed to the life of the sea,
in an attempt to enlighten viewers
about the question, "What is the
ocean?"
Sadly, yet again, the film was
a disappointment. You'd think I'd
learn. The problem this time was
not that the footage consisted of

hand-me-down segments from
"Planet Earth" (they weren't at all,
I hadn't seen any of it before), but
instead that the film had trouble
keeping me awake at times, it
was extremely boring. This issue
arises from the somber and sub
dued tone of the film. Even dur
ing scenes with intense footage
and mysterious animals, the nar
ration (provided by Pierce
Brosnan) left me yawning and
relaxed; it lacked excitement and
vigor. Through Brosnan's descrip
tions, the movie strangely depict
ed the ocean as a calm and deli
cate environment, which might be
somewhat true, but I know it is
much more varied and complicat
ed than that.
The film was also terribly
organized, which, paired with the
incongruent narration, made it
even more difficult to maintain
my interest. Either I completely
missed it, or the documentary
really did lack a storyline or any
sort of arc. It didn't even have any

noticeable, planned arrangement,
perhaps detailing wildlife by geo
graphic location or ocean depth.
Alternately, the movie displayed
what I felt were insufficiently
short, seemingly random clips of
majestic ocean life from any place,
any depth and any season without
rhyme or reason, leaving me dizzy
and unsatisfied. I wanted to know
more about the animals, for
example the beautiful, silk-like
blanket octopus (seriously, check
it out). Basically as soon as they
appeared on screen, the movie
skipped to the next creature,
arousing more questions than
producing answers.
Although I did leave the the
ater unenthusiastic and confused
as to the trajectory of the film, I
can't deny that the footage com
prising the documentary is
beyond incredible. The process of
collecting such footage is unfath
omable. They capture everything:
breathtaking ocean scenery from
the tropics to the poles, as well as

classic animals (whales, sea lions,
jelly fish, sharks and assorted fish)
and plenty of bizarre, alien-like
creatures from the ocean depths.
While the story and descriptions
may not have conveyed the
appropriate message, fortunately,
the cinematography speaks for
itself. It's obvious that the ocean
holds a whole different, diversi
fied world beneath the surface.
The saddest part of the film
was the necessary PSA-like seg
ment that warned viewers of the
perils lying ahead for the ocean's
future. As the movie shows a sea
lion swimming in dirty, trash
infested water, examining a dis
carded shopping cart on the
ocean floor, you can't help but
feel guilty. Obviously, one ulti
mate goal of the film is to further
advance the conservation move
ment, an aim to which I am not at
all opposed. One particular shot
of a mother walrus embracing
(and literally hugging) her cub in
the Arctic Ocean was probably the

cutest and most endearing thing I
have ever seen. Unfortunately,
melting ice caps do not facilitate
walrus cuddling, a thought that
makes me shudder.
Both Disney Nature films
have been disappointing, and yet
for some unknown reason, I can
hardly wait for the franchise's
third installment, "African Cats."
It wouldn't really matter what
they did, I am a sucker for nature
films. While the thrill of the films
may be lacking, the content is not.
I was not entirely engaged, but
while I sat there watching the
film, relaxed and subdued, I wit
nessed remarkable facets of the
planet that only left me wanting
more. So, I will definitely be there,
April 22, 2011, eagerly anticipat
ing some African cat action, only
this time around, I'll have learned
my lesson my expectations will
be lower.
