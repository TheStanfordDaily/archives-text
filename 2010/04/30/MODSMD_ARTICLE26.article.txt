For those of you expecting a
high-budget, blockbuster,
"Marvel-esque" style from
superhero film "Kick-Ass," you'll
be severely disappointed.
However, those in anticipation of
daring dark comedy, biting
humor, excessive violence and
characters with real heart will find
that this movie goes above and
beyond. Adapted from the popu
lar comic book, this film, directed
by Matthew Vaughn, not only
stays true to the original story
pleasing the fans but also
opens itself up to a newer and
wider audience, as evidenced by
its place at the top of the box
office the weekend of its release.
The story follows Dave
Lizewski (Aaron Johnson), an

entirely unremarkable teenager
living in Manhattan. He loves
comic books, but isn't really a
nerd, but he's definitely not cool,
either, he says. He and his two
best friends spend their time
browsing comics and chatting
about girls specifically Katie
(Lyndsy Fonseca). Dave speculates
as to why nobody has ever actual
ly tried to be a superhero, and
despite being shot down by his
less ambitious buddies, he orders
a green scuba outfit online and
becomes "Kick-Ass." His wide
eyed good intentions capture the
audience's collective heart pretty
early on; Dave is convinced that
people don't need super powers
or Bruce Wayne's fortune to do
good things for other people.

Looking completely ridiculous,
Dave hits the Manhattan streets,
and right off the bat, tries to pre
vent grand theft auto and gets
his ass kicked by the bad guys,
who have street skills and knives.
Even after a visit to the hos
pital, Dave remains determined. It
is this tenacity that transforms
Dave's character from being a
bump on a log to incredibly
endearing. Johnson, despite being
a native Brit, adds a charming
quiver to his voice, coming off as
unsure yet eager, and putting a
spin on a character that Michael
Cera could pull off in his sleep.
The standouts of the film, howev
er, are Damon Macready (Nicolas
Cage) and his foul-mouthed
daughter Mindy (Chloe Grace

Moretz). Desperate for revenge on
an evil mob boss, Damon and
Mindy have spent their lives
training in combat, knives and
guns. The characters are intro
duced with Damon shooting

Mindy point-blank in the chest,
just to practice don't worry,
she's wearing a bulletproof vest,
and, like a good dad, he buys her
ice cream afterwards.

preparation for the Tarentino
esque fights in which Mindy
absolutely unleashes on the bad
guys parents across America
are outraged by the graphic vio
lence perpetuated by an 11 year
old girl. Appropriate or not,
Mindy (or her alter-ego, Hit Girl)
actually does kick some ass.
Killing at least 20 people in the
course of the film, Hit Girl is
well-trained, an incredible shot
and, most importantly, hilarious.
Hit Girl is not the only other
superhero that Dave finds himself
matched up with and outstripped
by Red Mist, the Bowie-esque,
marble-mouthed villain (played
by Christopher Mintz-Plasse) is
the son of the mob boss in ques
tion (Mark Strong), and will do
anything he can to protect his
father and vanquish Kick-Ass and
Hit Girl. Mintz-Plasse performs
with subtlety, hinting at angst and
danger like a gothic version of his

unforgettable McLovin' from
"Superbad."
Though "Kick-Ass" regularly
provides some level of social com
mentary, more often than not, the
movie is obsessed with shocking
the audience, by either making
them laugh or making them
squirm. The story does have a lot
of heart, but when it comes down
to it, "Kick-Ass" is buoyed by a
quirky cast, an abundance of awk
ward comedy and a whole ton of
seriously graphic violence.
