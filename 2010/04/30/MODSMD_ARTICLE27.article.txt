Your trusty Intermission
food critics were recently
lucky enough to live out
every college student's dream of
free food. Even more key, we did
so at a place where regular atten
dance isn't exactly advisable on
college budgets Mac Arthur
Park, that really, really nice restau-

rant right next to the Palo Alto
Caltrain station. Despite the
restaurant's un-college-like luxu
ry, the owners are hoping to
attract a larger Stanford customer
base and generously sat us down
to discuss the menu and restau
rant history (we even got to hang
out with the chef, a delightful
man named Faz).
Mac Arthur Park has been in
Palo Alto since 1981 old
enough that it has achieved insti
tution status for most people in

the area. When my family lived
near campus, my mom brought
all of us there for brunch or din
ner every chance she got. While
the man dressed in an Easter
Bunny suit at Mac Arthur Park's
annual Easter brunch may have
twice reduced my little brother to
tears, the restaurant still has a

special place in my family's collec
tive memory.
When a restaurant has been
around for over a quarter of a
century, certain beloved staples
are bound to emerge. Mac Arthur
Park is no exception. When we sat
down, a waiter placed on the table
a bowl of their classic, freshly
made potato chips. They were still
warm and perfectly salty a
great, simple start to the dinner to
come. The chef then brought out
a smorgasbord of Macarthur Park

favorites. First, we had a plate of
the house-made smoked salmon.
While smoked salmon can be
gummy, this was the perfect con
sistency and obviously fresh. He
also brought out a venison
Carpaccio. Despite my love of
food, I'm not very adventurous
when it comes to eating raw ani
mals related to Bambi, but every
one else at the table loved it. Next
were potato skins (pretty good for
the fried potato paradigm, but
definitely not show-stopping),
baby artichokes (amazing, espe
cially when liberally dipped in
garlic aioli) and locally grown
asparagus (grilled with olive oil,
which was simple but divine).
Next, Faz brought us
Mac Arthur Park's most notorious
dish the ribs. Ribs are in many
ways the restaurant's raison d'etre.
Faz was in fact hired from a
famous rib-house in Chicago
specifically for his prowess at this
dish. They are so amazing that I
couldn't stop eating them ... it
was embarrassing. The best
accompaniment to the ribs?
Definitely the super glamorous
disposable rib bibs that came with
the full slab (although the cole
slaw was a close second); Katie
and I both wore ours with pride.
Sadly, the ribs were finite in num
ber. Next, we had bacon-wrapped
scallops lightly topped with a
pesto-y salsa and served on a bed

of the same amazing asparagus
we'd had as an appetizer pretty
good, especially as a concept,
although the bacon was burned.
Finally, we had grilled swordfish
served in a bed of guava barbeque
sauce. This was the most disap
pointing main dish, maybe only
because I'm usually a huge sword-

fish fan. It was a little overcooked,
and the barbeque sauce was too
overpowering. Stuffed to the gills,
we could barely even contemplate
the dessert sampler Faz brought
us at the end. The berries with
clotted cream were fresh and
sweet, though we both wished we
had more room for the cheese
cake.
In conclusion, Mac Arthur
Park is a great bet for a tradition
al, nice meal out. The menu isn't
as edgy as Palo Alto's splashy new

fine dining destination, Baume, 01
as easy on the bank account as a
La Costena burrito. But for a visit
from the parents, or to satisfy an
itch for something a little nicer

than, say, Ricker Dining, you can't
go wrong. And, as the owners
pointed out, the burger only costs
$8 even if nothing else does.
