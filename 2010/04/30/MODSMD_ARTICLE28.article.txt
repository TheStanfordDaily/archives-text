With the upcoming release
of "Iron Man 2" and the
triumphant return of
Tony Stark, a new season is marked
summer. Yes, I know that we're
still taking midterms and it is inter
mittently pouring rain outside, but
summer movie season is starting,
and that's the summer that counts
for Intermission. This summer is
full of sequels, reboots and date
movies, and we've put together a
comprehensive list to make sure
that you won't miss a thing!
COMING IN MAY ...
IRON MAN 2 (MAY 7)
After the major success of the first
film, which launched the well
deserved comeback of Robert
Downey, Jr., Tony Stark is back,
defending his superhero machinery
and keeping it out of the hands of
the government. Assisting him in
his militant quest is his trusty assis
tant Pepper Potts (Gwyneth
Paltrow) and military strategist
Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson).
With the sequel comes a plethora of
new characters, like Black Widow
(Scarlett Johansson), Whiplash
(Mickey Rourke) and War Machine
(Don Cheadle). Director Jon
Favreau set the bar quite high with
the first film, and "Iron Man 2" has
a lot to live up to. Expect this to be
one of the biggest films of the sum
mer.
ROBIN HOOD (MAY 14)
Starring Russell Crowe and Cate
Blanchett, this version of Sherwood
Forest is going to be a lot more
intense than the beloved foxes in
the Disney adaptation. Directed by
Ridley Scott, "Robin Flood" is
expected to be a type of origin
story, filling in the audience on how
Robin Hood went from an archer in
the court of King Richard to the
infamous merry thief. After an
incredible collaboration between
Scott and Crowe in "Gladiator,"
hopes are high for "Robin Hood."
The combination of great actors, a
large budget and a timeless story
seems to be a recipe for success.
COMING IN JUNE ...
SPLICE (JUNE 4)
Premiering at Sundance to a ton of
buzz, "Splice" tells the story of
genetic engineers combining animal
DNA to create hybrids, and then
taking the experiment one step fur
ther and fusing human DNA into
new hybrids. Starring Adrien Brody,
this film is expected to make a
splash with audiences looking for a
thriller. The CGI is rumored to be
very impressive, and with an Oscar
touting cast, "Splice" has the poten
tial to become a sleeper hit.
TOY STORY 3 (JUNE 18)
Anticipated for years, "Toy Story 3"
will be released 15 years after the
original "Toy Story" (how OLD do
you feel?), with Andy donating his
toys to a daycare center before he
leaves for college. Not only will the

audience be reunited with their
favorite toys, but with the daycare
plot line comes a bevy of new char
acters. After the toys realize that
Andy is looking for them and wants
them back, they embark on another
sure-to-please quest. Like always,
expect Pixar to provide plenty of
laughs for children and adults
with both "Toy Story"s being
among the most highly lauded Pixar
films, expectations for the third are
incredibly high, and we have no
doubt "Toy Story 3" will delight
audiences and critics everywhere.
COMING IN JULY ...
THE LAST AIRBENDER
After a few truly terrible films, M.
Night Shyamalan is back in action
with "The Last Airbender," a live
action adaptation of the popular
animated Nickelodeon series. The
film tells the story of Aang, the 12-
year-old boy forced to realize his
destiny by learning to control all of
the elements and maintaining peace
between the tribes of the elements.
With rumors floating around
already about sequels, many expect
this to be Shyamalan's triumphant
return to the big screen.
Nonetheless, it is sure to be popular
with younger audiences familiar
with the hit television series.
SALT
Following up on her roles in
"Wanted" and "Mr. and Mrs.
Smith," Angelina Jolie is back in
action in a summer flick centered
around a spy/gun
slinger/assassin/CIA operative. In
this case, it's the latter. "Salt" is the
story of a CIA operative who is
accused of being a Russian double
agent and is thus forced to run for
her life. Causing some fuss in
Hollywood, Jolie managed to take
the role away from Tom Cruise,
who it was originally intended for.
Looking much like her other films
before this, "Salt" is chock-full of
explosions and sex appeal. With
supporting actors like Liev
Schreiber and Chiwetel Ejiofor,

"Salt" will be well-acted, and, at the
very least, exciting.

COMING IN AUGUST ...
EAT, PRAY, LOVE
Adapted from the book of the same
name, "Eat, Pray, Love" stars Julia
Roberts as Elizabeth Gilbert, a
woman looking to find herself
through traveling. Though she has
a wonderful home, a great career
and a seemingly perfect life,
Gilbert feels something is missing.
After a messy divorce,
she decides to glo
betrot, and finds
herself eating in
Italy, praying in
India and finding
love in Bali.
Coming as a
welcome
change to
the »

action and comedy prevalent this
summer, Julia Roberts will have the
chance to prove why she is consid-

ered America s Sweetheart, even
years after "Pretty Woman."
