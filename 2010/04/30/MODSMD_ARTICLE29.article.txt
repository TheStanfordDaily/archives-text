Although I basically don't even know how I'm going to pay for break
fast tomorrow, thanks to the fashion industry, I'm already calculat
ing how many organs I have to sell in order to afford style next fall.
Fall/Winter Fashion Week 2010 madness has already subsided, and now
that it's been almost two months (yeah, fashion people think way ahead)
since I've been planning my day around Milan time to catch the live
streaming of the Prada show, I think it is time everybody is brought up to
speed. You only have six months to prepare yourself— the it girls could be
wearing enormous slashed purple tutus round their torsos (a la Viktor &
Rolf S/S 2010) or, heaven forbid, the 80s could resurface ... again, and you
would be completely unprepared for potential encounters with dangerous
shoulder spikes or death by smothering of tulle. Lucky for us all, the four

major houses of fashion forged ahead with the unrelenting pace of the
industry, yet there was a definite sense of a sticking-to-your-guns, timeless
style approach that pervaded my four favorite shows of the season.

1. BURBERRY PRORSUM
Burberry Prorsum, led by the dashing British king of cool Christopher
Bailey, looked into the design house's archives of aviator jackets and created
an "it coat" as versatile as the iconographic Burberry trench. The shearling
coats, flung over filmy lace dresses and thigh high boots in various stages of
oversized and cropped proportions and lined with rows of leather buckles,
were a continuation of his menswear line that debuted just weeks before.
The versatile and classic Burberry aesthetic, in Bailey's words "strong and

sexy, masculine and feminine,"
grounds this fall trend in the vision of
the house as a whole. The Burberry
Girl of Christopher Bailey direction is,
like the face of the brand, Emma
Watson, classy and classic, yet utterly
desirable, as every boy I know can
attest to.
2. DOLCE & GABANNA
Dolce & Gabanna most literally revis
ited their line's staples of lingerie,
leopard print and polka dots that
embody their iconic Italian sex bomb
ideal by sending them all down the
runway at once. Fitted together and
playing off one another, the quintes
sential elements of Dolce & Gabanna
were redone with taste and humility.
The prelude to the show was a video
of them in the atelier, draping and fit
ting along with the multitude of
white-coated craftsmen and women,
grounding their review of their work
in the love of the art of fashion.
3. PRADA
Miuccia Prada, personal hero and
visionary, released her models into the
maze of the crowd, darting off at ran
dom moments set to a skittering free
jazz track. The classic Prada fabrics,
silhouettes and playful perversion

were re-imagined through a "Mad Men"-esque filter complete with bee
hives and 60s skirts made of Prada's signature double-faced cashmere.
While the show was one of refining her classics, Miuccia pushed the enve
lope as usual, drawing all eyes to a usually non-existent feature of her mod
els. Perfecdy placed ruffles, cut-outs and an actual external pointy bra put
unavoidable emphasis on her curvaceous models' decolletage, namely Lara
Stone, size four anomaly extraordinaire, which marked a shift towards the
"real woman" in a sartorial and subversive way.

4.LOUIS VUITTON
Louis Vuitton finished the season off, closing Paris fashion week with one
last reinforcing return to the classics. Marc Jacobs picked up where Prada

left off, whole-heartedly celebrating the woman's body by casting models
with boobs and women over 40 gasp! (Elle McPherson!) His progressive,
rebellious move was an aesthetic shift away from the anonymous teenage
skeleton and a refocusing of the house around classic beauty. The line also
used 60s silhouettes and plenty of womanly curves, but in Marc's hands
using corsets and ladylike skirts in a luxe leather so buttery, I start salivat
ing.
Fall fashion week defines the industry every year, and this year, the return
to tradition and the classic aesthetic of the giants of fashion has established
a year of timeless style.
