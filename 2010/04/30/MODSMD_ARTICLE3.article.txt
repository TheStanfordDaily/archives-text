## Financial officers unhappy Approps. Committee, FOs, discuss changes 
### BRIANNA PANG STAFF WRITER 
In a glimpse of next year's fund
ing landscape for Stanford student
groups a sometimes contentious
place this year amid tightened poli
cies Appropriations Committee
Chair Anton Zietsman 'l2 called a
meeting on Thursday for financial
officers to voice their suggestions
about the funding process.
Invitations were also extended to
newly elected members of the
ASSU Undergraduate Senate.
Beginning the meeting with an
overview of special and general fees,
Zietsman explained to the new Sen
ate members funding policy changes
that the committee instituted during
his term, claiming the previous Sen
ate did not provide his group with
"much of a transition."
Working with a budget of ap
proximately $434,000, Zietsman in
formed new Senate members that
most changes were made in food
funding cuts.
However, more changes can be
made, Zietsman said.
Of more than 600 student groups
on campus, nine organizations had
representatives at the meeting
Thursday.
The main concern of the evening
was communication. Financial offi
cers Amarachi Okoro 'lO and
Rachel Hovde 'll suggested the
committee reach out more to new fi
nancial officers.
Perhaps meetings should be "a
little less of you talking to us and
more of a conversation," Hovde
said. "FOs [financial officers] that
know you guys have a very big ad
vantage, but most FOs aren't very
plugged into campus politics at
all. They get their arms twisted
into money stuff because no one
really wants to do it. They know
their group's budget, but they
don't understand the political as
pects of it very well.
"You can informally talk with
them and make them feel like
you're on their side rather than
the adversary," she added. "That
would be very helpful."
"There is a big attitude that it
was us versus you guys," Okoro
said. "That was what the climate
was like."
The Stanford Band financial
officer, Georgia Andrews 'll, sug
gested that next year's changes be
more continuous, rather than
abrupt. Other financial officers
agreed, claiming this year's
changes seemed "arbitrary."
Cruz explained that policies
are subject to change every year.
Discussion concluded when
SPLASH and Educational Studies
Program financial officer Ben
Shank, a physics graduate student,
suggested the next appropriations
committee e-mail new changes to
all financial officers for clarity.
Zietsman acknowledged that
the time commitment for a finan
cial officer "has probably in
creased" because of the newly en
forced processes.
Workshops are currently of
fered to new financial officers, but
were sometimes "a waste of time
for us to go," Okoro said. Finan
cial officers complained the work
shop training was also too basic,
unless the officers "knew what to

listen for," according to Hovde.
Currently, the financial officer
workshop only trains students on
how to use MyGroups and ex
plains what funding is used for.
Okoro said the interview process
with the committee, one of the
more important elements, was
only a "side note."
Concern also arose about a sin
gle set of funding policies apply
ing to a diverse range of student
groups. The current process cate
gorizes organizations as either
community service and program
ming, determined by what the
group checks as they register with
Student Activities and Leader
ship.
Financial officers suggested
fragmenting the process, allowing
different guidelines for funding
performing arts groups, communi
ty service groups and other types.
"It seems really strange to
apply the same type of guidelines
to Phi Psi and SHPRC," Hovde
said, contrasting the fraternity
and the resource center.
Zietsman said that would make
the process "too complicated,"
raising the question of how to set
guidelines for each type of group.
Financial officers from Vagina
Monologues, the Asian American
Students Association, the Sexual
Health Peer Resource Center,
Stanford Black Premedical Orga
nization, Educational Studies Pro
gram, SPLASH, the Band, the Stu
dent Organizing Committee for
the Arts and Tutoring for Commu
nity were present.
Also present were some newly
elected Senate members, includ
ing Madeline Hawes 'l3, Pat
Bruny 'l3, Deepa Kannappan 'l3,
Daniel Khalessi 'l3, Michael Cruz
'l2, Khaled Alshawi 'l3, Juany
Torres 'l3 and Will Seaton 'l3,
who is a Daily writer.
