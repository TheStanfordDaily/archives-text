# Remote Nomad: Drama Surrounding Comedy

The all-familiar opening
gambit that doubles as a
disclaimer: I have seen two
episodes of "South Park" in my
life. I grew up in a household
where my mother was hesitant to
let me watch "Bring It On," let
alone the paper-animated midgets
that light up Comedy Central
with their neon-colored hoodies.
My greatest familiarity with
Comedy Central programming is
that its channel lies between
Bravo and GSN in my home
region.
Two weeks ago, "South Park"
aired its 200th episode and its
third to animate the Muslim
prophet Muhammad. All three
instances include the religious fig
ure in the "Super Best Friends,"
also featuring Buddha, Krishna
and Moses. The show parodied
the tenet of Islam that
Muhammad not be represented
pictorially, hiding him in a U-
Haul and a bear suit. From the
brief clips I've seen (the episode
has since been taken off the
Internet by Comedy Central), it
was pretty funny.
The radical website revolu
tionmuslim.com responded to the
episode and its controversial
premise with "subtle" death
threats aimed at the show's cre
ators Trey Parker and Matt Stone.
Enter drama and free speech
issues stage left.

The 201 st episode that fol
lowed continued this plotline, but
this time, Comedy Central chose
to censor visual and auditory ref
erences to the prophet.
So that's the recap. Following
these events, "The Simpsons"
began its next episode with Bart
writing on a chalkboard, '"South
Park' we'd stand behind you if
we weren't so scared." This com
mentary by the yellow people at
Fox reflects how unique "South
Park" is for that lack of fear
and its divergence from the rest of
the television community.
The show performs for a
small, late-night audience on a
basic cable channel, and yet, when
it takes a risk, the ramifications
and aftershocks are more visible
and immediate than those related
to any other medium. Clips go
viral on the Internet, chat rooms
explode and Muslim extremists
join the conversation. Television,
even more than the Internet,
sparks a passionate response
because you can't take back what
you put on TV (Janet Jackson can
relate) and because animated
actions speak louder than words.
I'm assuming that, somewhere in
the bowels of the Internet, what
happened in that episode of
"South Park" happens every hour
of every day.
If the Internet is so openly
full of hate and absurdity, why

can't that discourse exist on TV?
The articles I have read about this
incident address separately the
free speech rights of revolution
muslim.com and of Parker and
Stone. Comedy Central's action
was, presumably, in the interest of
protecting its employees, but to
what end?
This event is emblematic of
the disconnect between network
and showrunners for certain
shows such as "South Park."

Parker and Stone have created
such a personal, successful and
unique program that the regula
tion of that half hour is equally
idiosyncratic. These shows, where
the original creators stay attached
and run it independent of the
network, are often the best: "Mad
Men," "The Wire," etc. In this case,
such a show is susceptible to par
ticularly contentious, invasive and
obvious third party intervention.
I'm not sure how I feel about
representations of Muhammad in
general, but I do think that
"South Park" has a right to expose
whatever risk it dares to provoke

and to draw whatever it pleases.
One representative of revolution
muslim.com said in an interview
that," [Americans are] worried
more about missing their favorite
TV show than they are about the
world." He doesn't seem to realize
that in America, our world is

refracted through and symbiotic
with our popular culture. Boob
tube no more.
