# TITLE CHASE
## Stanford heads to MPSF final 
### JACOB JAFFE MANAGING EDITOR 
In two previous meetings with No. 4
Hawaii this year, the No. 1 Stanford men's
volleyball team came away with sweeps. Last
night, with a spot in the finals of the Moun
tain Pacific Sports Federation (MPSF) Tour
nament on the line, the Cardinal (21-6,16-6
MPSF) once again pulled off a sweep of the
Warriors (19-10,14-8), though it was by no
means a walk in the park.
The 30-24,30-28,33-31 victory puts Stan
ford into the finals, and it likely guarantees
the Cardinal a spot in the four-team NCAA
Tournament.
Both teams came out of the gate shaky,
with the 14 straight side-outs to start the first
set. Sophomore middle blocker Gus Ellis
broke this streak with a kill to give Stanford
an 8-7 lead. With Ellis serving, the Cardinal
scored four consecutive points to build a 15-
10 lead and never looked back. Senior setter
Kawika Shoji highlighted the first set with a
perfectly executed dump for a kill followed
by a block that led to a Hawaii timeout.
Hawaii outside hitter Joshua Walker whiffed
on a hitting attempt at set point to give the
first set to Stanford, 30-24.
The first set featured important contribu
tions from all four of Stanford's All-Ameri
cans. Sophomore outside hitter Brad Law
son had six kills and a dig in the first set,
while sophomore libero Erik Shoji made
several diving digs. Both were recently
named First Team All-Americans, along with
Kawika Shoji. Senior opposite Evan
Romero, who was named to the Second
Team, had six kills and three digs.
The second set proved to be much closer.
A slam-dunk kill by Lawson after digs by
both Shojis highlighted a four-point run for
Stanford as the Cardinal opened up a 6-2
lead, forcing an early Hawaii timeout. The
Warriors came back to tie Stanford at 13, led

by its two All-Americans, Walker and oppo
site Jonas Umlauft. Hawaii gained its first
lead of the set at 20-19 on an error by junior
outside hitter Spencer McLachlin. Both
teams traded blows, as the two teams tied at
21,23,24,25,26 and 28. After a Romero kill
gave Stanford a set point, junior libero Jor
dan Inafuku came in to serve. Hawaii looked
to have won the point when middle blocker
Matthew Rawson easily spiked the ball into
the middle of the court, but Rawson was

ruled to have touched the net and Stanford
won the set, 30-28.
As Hawaii players continued to complain
to the officials, the third set began with a Car
dinal run that seemed to put the game away.
Stanford jumped out to a 9-3 lead, punctuat
ed by a sprawling dig and assist by Erik Shoji
that led to a McLachlin kill. With the score
11-5, Hawaii showed fight for the first time in
the set, scoring five consecutive points to get
back in it. The run began after the referees

incorrectly determined that a Stanford at
tempt was untouched, much to the dismay of
Cardinal players and coaches.
With Stanford's players now visibly frus
trated, Hawaii took its first lead of the set at
15-14. Miscommunication between Cardinal
players led to the Warriors taking a two
point lead at 23-21. The teams traded points
after that, although not without more con
troversy. Kawika Shoji appeared to have
kept a ball alive that could have tied the set
for Stanford, but the referee ruled that it had
hit the equipment, so the Warriors were
awarded the point at 26-24. Hawaii was on
the verge of its first set victory of the season
against Stanford when it took a 29-27 lead.
The Cardinal did not give in, though.
Stanford won each of the next two points to
tie the score at 29 and force a Hawaii time
out. The Warriors had two more set points at

CAI STATE
NORTHRIDGE
(23-8,17-7 MPSF)
Maples Pavilion 7RM.

NOTES: Though all three sets were closely contested,
Stanford came away from last night's semifinal with a
sweep of Hawaii. The Cardinal now advances to the
MPSF Tournament final to take on No. 3 Cal State
Northridge, which won yesterday's first semifinal over
No. 3 BYU. The winner will earn the conference's au
tomatic berth into the four-team NCAA Tournament.
Even if Stanford loses, it is likely to earn the lone at
large tournament bid due to its strong regular season
record.


30-29 and 31-30, but the Cardinal
eked out points to tie it up. Stanford
took its first lead since 19-18 when
Walker's attempt went wide at 32-
31. On the first match point, Um
lauft's attempt hit the antenna to
give the Cardinal the win.
Stanford was once again led by
Romero and Lawson, who each tal
lied 18 kills.The player of the match,
though, was probably Kawika Shoji,
who had five kills on seven attempts,
49 assists and 13 digs. Senior middle
blocker Garrett Werner added a
match-high seven blocks.
Hawaii was led by Umlauft and
Walker, who combined for 31 kills
and 10 digs. The two also combined
for 18 errors, which was more than

Stanford had as a team. Setter Nejc
Zemljak had 47 assists, two aces and
12 digs, while outside hitter Steven
Hunt added 13 kills.

Hitting was a strength for the
Cardinal, which leads the nation in
that category. A hitting average of
.531 in the first set led Stanford to a
.374 average for the match, while
Hawaii hit .252. The Cardinal also
out-blocked the Warriors 12 to 8.5,
but Stanford owed its success to its
back-row play.
"The key to the win was passing,"
said assistant coach Chris McLach
lin. "We really passed well, and with
out passing you can't do anything."
Stanford once again benefited
from a riotous home crowd of

1,350 at Maples Pavilion. The Car
dinal will have home-court advan
tage again when it takes on No. 3
Cal State Northridge, who took
down No. 2 BYU in a five-set
thriller just before Stanford took
on Hawaii.

The winner of the final will win
the MPSF Tournament and clinch
an automatic berth in the NCAA
Tournament. Even if Stanford does
not win, the Cardinal are very likely
to secure the lone at-large berth on
the strength of its No. 1 national
ranking and No. 1 finish in the na
tion's top conference. By making
the final of the conference tourna
ment, Stanford has all but guaran
teed its spot in next week's NCAA

Tournament, which will also take
place at Maples Pavilion.
"Everyone is talking about the
'97 team [Stanford's last national
championship team] and the paral
lels between the two," said volun
teer assistant coach Daniel Rasay.'T
think we've done a good job staying
focused and maintaining our goals."
Stanford's ultimate goal of a na
tional championship is just three
wins away. The next step is Satur
day's MPSF Tournament final
against Cal State Northridge, which
will take place at Maples Pavilion at
7 p.m.
