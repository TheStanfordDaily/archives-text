## STREAKIN' INTO SEATTLE 
### DANIEL BOHM SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The No. 18 Stanford baseball team (21-14,10-
5 Pac-10) travels to Seattle, Wash, this weekend
to take on the Washington Huskies (20-18,5-7) in
a three-game Pac-10 Conference series.
This weekend begins a stretch in which the
Cardinal will play five games on consecutive
days.
The Card has lately been playing its best base
ball of the season. Stanford enters the weekend
having swept two consecutive Pac-10 series. Two
weeks ago the Cardinal traveled to Oregon State
and took all three from the Beavers before
sweeping rival California at Sunken Diamond
last weekend. The Cardinal did, however, have its
eight-game winning streak snapped on Monday
with a 9-3 loss at the hands of Santa Clara.
The Cardinal's offense has catalyzed its re
cent surge, scoring double-digit runs in four of
those eight victories. The offense has also had a
flair for the dramatic, as Stanford has won eight
games this season in its last at-bat, including two
of the wins last weekend against Cal. Both walk
off RBIs came from freshman third baseman
Kenny Diekroeger, who was named Pac-10 Play
er of the Week after his performance against the
Golden Bears.
Leading Stanford's offensive barrage has
been junior first baseman Jonathan
Kaskow. Kaskow enters the weekend
hitting .469, good for fourth in the na
tion.
This weekend is crucial for the
Cardinal's chances at winning the
Pac-10 title. Currently Stanford sits
alone in second place, one game be
hind No. 1 Arizona State, whom the
Cardinal will host in its final series of
the season. Washington, on the other
hand, is currently in a tie for seventh
in the conference.
Junior shortstop Jake Schlander
thinks that even though Washington
is below the Cardinal in the stand
ings, Stanford still needs to prepare
diligently.
"Every Pac-10 team is going to be
tough," Schlander said. "We have to
prepare for every game the same. We
beat Cal and weren't prepared for

Santa Clara. It doesn't matter who
the team is; we have to prepare the
same, play the game. Respect the
game, as [head coach Mark Mar
quess] always says."
Not only must Stanford prepare
for its road trip to Washington, but it
also must get ready for games on
Monday and Tuesday against Santa
Clara and San Jose State, respective
ly, before next week's road trip to
Long Beach State.
This is undoubtedly the most gru
eling stretch of Stanford's schedule,
but Schlander believes the team is
well-prepared for the upcoming
grind.
"Our practice schedule in the fall
and spring prepares us for stretches
like this. Intra-squad four or five
days a week, practice the other
days," Schlander said. "Road trips
are pretty fun, playing those games
are fun; so as long as we keep focused
every game and keep the same ener
gy level, we should be fine."
Another reason for Stanford's re
cent improvement has been the per
formance of its pitchers. The Cardi
nal will send sophomore Brett
Mooneyham to the mound Friday.
Mooneyham, who has been erratic
for most of the season, is coming off
one of his best starts of the season
last weekend against Cal, in which he

went 7.1 innings and gave up just one
earned run while striking out 10.
Mooneyham will square off with
Huskies' junior Geoff Brown.
On Saturday, sophomore Jordan
Pries takes the mound for Stanford
against Washington sophomore An
drew Kittredge.
Pries' start is quite an honor, as
the Cardinal and the Huskies will
play Saturday's game at Safeco
Field, home of Major League Base
ball's Seattle Mariners a privilege
the entire team is excited about.
"I am excited about playing at
Safeco it's going to be awesome,"
Schlander said. "I've never played in
a big-league ballpark. Plus, we are
playing right after the Texas-Seattle
game. It's going to be fun to see that,
then play right after them."
Although starters haven't been
officially announced for Sunday's se
ries finale, all signs point to Stanford
sending sophomore Brian Busick to
the mound.
This upcoming stretch should be
good practice for the postseason for
Stanford, as the playoffs often re
quire a team to play games multiple
days in a row. This weekend should
go a long way in showing how deep
this Cardinal team is.

teams will play the second game of the se
ries, on Saturday, at Safeco Field, home of
the Seattle Mariners.

While Stanford's offense has keyed its recent hot streak, its pitching staff has also been important. Sophomore starters
Brett Mooneyham, Jordan Pries and Brian Busick have all provided high-quality starts over the past two Pac-10 series.
