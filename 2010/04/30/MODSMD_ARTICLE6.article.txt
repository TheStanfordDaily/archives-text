# PAC-10 IMPLOSION
## CARD FALLS ON FINAL DAY DESPITE BIG LEAD 
### JACK DUANE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford men's golf hasn't won a Pac-10 Champi
onship since 1994, the same year that Tiger Woods was a
senior in high school.
After two days and three rounds inTempe, Ariz, at the
Karsten Golf Course, however, the team looked poised to
end its 16-year drought.
The Cardinal was also strong in the individual compe
tition. Senior Joseph Bramlett lurked two strokes behind
leader Jesper Kennegard of Arizona State after shooting
three consecutive five-under rounds of 66.
"No matter where you're playing," said head coach
Conrad Ray, "that's pretty impressive."
"We were firing on all cylinders," Bramlett said. "Mon
day was the best day of team golf I've had at Stanford."
The Cardinal was 35 strokes under par after two
rounds, 13 strokes ahead of second-place Arizona State.
"It was great to be back in that spot," Bramlett said. "It
was so fun for everyone to be doing that well on the same
day."
The Karsten course features a desert layout with few
trees and limited water hazards. For the first two days, the
wind was a non-factor and left the course exposed to a lot
of low scores.
"It's a course that really allows you to put the pedal to
the metal and try to make as many birdies as you can,"
Bramlett explained.

Senior Joseph Bramlett (above) was in contention for an individual Pac-10
championship heading into the final round. A score of 75 in that round
doomed him to fourth place, five strokes behind the tournament's champion.
On Wednesday, the winds picked
up and Stanford failed to repeat the
success of the first two days.
The Cardinal entered the final
round with a seven-stroke lead over
Washington, but had to settle for sec
ond place after an eight-over team
score of 363 in the final round.
The team tournament was up in
the air until the last few holes. Stan
ford freshman Andrew Yun made a
costly triple bogey on the 16th hole,
but the crippling blow came when
Washington senior Richard Lee
made a 60-foot putt on the 18th hole.
Washington won the tournament
with a final score of 1386 (-34), three
strokes better than Stanford.
Bramlett carded a 75 on Wednes
day to finish tied for fourth at an 11-
under 273, five strokes behind winner
Eric Mina of California.
"With 20 to 30 mile-per-hour
winds, you really had to have good
control of your ball," he said. "I got
off to a bad start, went in the water
twice and had a three-putt."
Junior Steve Ziegler carded a
final-round 69 to tie for 10th at 276 (-
8). Ziegler finished all four rounds
under par his first three round
scores were 66,71 and 70.
Freshman Andrew Yun also tied
for 10th with a final-round 73.
Sophomore David Chung shot his
second straight 73 to finish tied for
20th at 282 (-2).
Junior Sihwan Kim also finished
tied for 20th after closing with a 73 on
Wednesday. Kim had struggled prior
to the tournament, carding a series of
scores over 80 at the ASU Thunder
bird Invitational and the U.S. Inter
collegiate.
Freshman Andrew DeDecker
shot a final round 77 to finish 58th at
299.
Stanford will not play again until
the NCAA Regionals start on May
19. Next week, the Cardinal will find
out which regional it will be playing
in.
"I'm not going to sugarcoat it,"
Bramlett said. "It sucks that we lost
the tournament, but I think we final
ly got a taste of what were capable
of"
