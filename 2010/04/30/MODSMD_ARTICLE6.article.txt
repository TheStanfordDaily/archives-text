# PAC-10 IMPLOSION
## CARD FALLS ON FINAL DAY DESPITE BIG LEAD 
### JACK DUANE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford men's golf hasn't won a Pac-10 Champi
onship since 1994, the same year that Tiger Woods was a
senior in high school.
After two days and three rounds inTempe, Ariz, at the
Karsten Golf Course, however, the team looked poised to
end its 16-year drought.
The Cardinal was also strong in the individual compe
tition. Senior Joseph Bramlett lurked two strokes behind
leader Jesper Kennegard of Arizona State after shooting
three consecutive five-under rounds of 66.
"No matter where you're playing," said head coach
Conrad Ray, "that's pretty impressive."
"We were firing on all cylinders," Bramlett said. "Mon
day was the best day of team golf I've had at Stanford."
The Cardinal was 35 strokes under par after two
rounds, 13 strokes ahead of second-place Arizona State.
"It was great to be back in that spot," Bramlett said. "It
was so fun for everyone to be doing that well on the same
day."
The Karsten course features a desert layout with few
trees and limited water hazards. For the first two days, the
wind was a non-factor and left the course exposed to a lot
of low scores.
"It's a course that really allows you to put the pedal to
the metal and try to make as many birdies as you can,"
Bramlett explained.

championship heading into the final round. A score of 75 in that round
doomed him to fourth place, five strokes behind the tournament's champion.
