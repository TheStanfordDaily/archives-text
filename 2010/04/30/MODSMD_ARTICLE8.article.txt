## UNIVERSITY DLCL to consolidate its five departments Senate also addresses faculty age increase, retirement 
### ERIC MESSINGER SENIOR MANAGING EDITOR 
The Faculty Senate took on a diverse range of
discussions Thursday to clear its slate in advance
of the trio of important meetings that will con
clude its business for this academic year.
A full meeting of the Academic Council is set
for May 13, followed by Senate meetings with
formal presentations from Provost John
Etchemendy and President John Hennessy on
May 27 and June 10, respectively. Hennessy's ad
dress, entitled "Challenges in Higher Education,"
will close the year for the Senate.
DLCL Consolidated
Etchemendy announced that the Division of
Literatures, Cultures and Languages (DLCL), an
administrative unit that includes comparative lit
erature, French and Italian, German studies,
Iberian and Latin American cultures and Slavic
languages and literatures, will be "reconstituted"
into one department effective in the fall.
The five departments will still be called "de
partments," he said, but they will now be treated
as one entity by University administration. No
professorial titles will change.
The most significant consequence of the move
is that the budgets between the different sections
will now be shared, and control of faculty billets
will be centralized.
Etchemendy described the move as keeping
with an increasing emphasis on interdisciplinary
research, citing opportunities for "innovative" re
search and academic activity.
Ex Officio
The Senate voted to establish a firm rationale

for determining "ex officio" membership in the
body that is, membership based on holding a
particular University position, rather than due to
election by the faculty. Ex officio members, under
Senate rules, "have all perquisites of member
ship," including speaking privileges, but are not
entitled to vote under normal circumstances.
Previously, ex officio members had been se
lected on an ad hoc basis, and had typically in
cluded key campus administrators. The proposed
revision alters that arrangement to make ex offi
cio membership of the Senate simply include the
Academic Secretary and all of the members of
the Executive Cabinet, the "academic leader
ship" of the University the president, the
provost, the deans of the seven schools, the vice
provost and dean of research, the vice provost for
undergraduate education, the vice provost for
graduate education, the director of SLAC Na
tional Accelerator Laboratory and the director
of the Hoover Institution.
The Senate passed the revision by a razor-thin
margin, 16-15, prompting some laughter over a
potential recount.
The practical effect of this revision for the
2010-11 academic year assuming that no posts
see a change of administrators will be the re
moval of membership for Vice Provost for Stu
dent Affairs Greg Boardman and University Li
brarian Michael Keller, and the addition of
Hoover Institution Director John Raisian.
The Senate retained the option to invite
Boardman and Keller, among others, as "stand
ing guests" with restricted speaking privileges.
Faculty Retirements
The provost also spoke Thursday about facul
ty retirement. Owing to the combined effects of
tenure and a profession where the "incentive to
retire is unusually low," colleges and universities
have dealt for decades with the challenge of en-
suring a rate of faculty retirement
that allows for the hiring of younger
scholars emerging from their gradu
ate study. Institutions had attempted
for decades to ensure faculty mem
bers retired in their late 60s,
Etchemendy said.
The advent of legislation in the
1980s and 1990s to check age dis
crimination in the workplace, how
ever, meant universities could no
longer enforce mandatory retire
ment ages.
Etchemendy said that move con
tributed to a noticeable aging of the
academic workforce, with a greater
proportion of professors now older
than 65, and a reduced percentage
younger than 35. This has exacerbat
ed the difficulty, he added, in hiring
younger faculty members, a concern
across the entire higher education
system, which is already struggling to
make room for students earning
their doctoral degrees in a difficult
job market.
The most recent effort to encour
age retirements was the third itera
tion of the Faculty Retirement In
centive Program (FRIP), known as
"FRIP III," which concluded in Au
gust 2009. Etchemendy reported
that about 20 percent of eligible fac
ulty 83 out of 423 participated
in FRIP 111.
In total, 11 percent of Stanford's
faculty are older than 65.

Graduate Education
Vice Provost of Graduate Educa
tion Patricia Gumport also issued a
report on issues affecting graduate
students and the broader state of
graduate work at Stanford.
Stanford's graduate schools are
more decentralized than its under
graduate programs, with funding
and administration centered in indi
vidual departments. Gumport there
fore focused on universal concerns
among graduates, particularly stu
dent diversity.
Gumport pointed to 1995 as a
high-water mark for diversity among
the graduate population, and pro
vided data indicating that in recent
years both the percentage and ab
solute numbers of women and un
derrepresented minorities in the
population of doctoral students was
almost back to that point.
She also emphasized the need for
continued discussion among the
graduate community about issues af
fecting students, and an increased di
alogue between students and their
professors about issues relating to
their work and research.
Other Business
Etchemendy also noted that a
search committee to find a replace
ment for outgoing Vice Provost for
Undergraduate Education John
Bravman '79 M.S. 'Bl Ph.D. 'B5 has
been formed. Electrical engineering
professor Brad Osgood will chair the
committee.
