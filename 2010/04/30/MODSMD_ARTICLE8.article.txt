## UNIVERSITY DLCL to consolidate its five departments Senate also addresses faculty age increase, retirement 
### ERIC MESSINGER SENIOR MANAGING EDITOR 
The Faculty Senate took on a diverse range of
discussions Thursday to clear its slate in advance
of the trio of important meetings that will con
clude its business for this academic year.
A full meeting of the Academic Council is set
for May 13, followed by Senate meetings with
formal presentations from Provost John
Etchemendy and President John Hennessy on
May 27 and June 10, respectively. Hennessy's ad
dress, entitled "Challenges in Higher Education,"
will close the year for the Senate.
DLCL Consolidated
Etchemendy announced that the Division of
Literatures, Cultures and Languages (DLCL), an
administrative unit that includes comparative lit
erature, French and Italian, German studies,
Iberian and Latin American cultures and Slavic
languages and literatures, will be "reconstituted"
into one department effective in the fall.
The five departments will still be called "de
partments," he said, but they will now be treated
as one entity by University administration. No
professorial titles will change.
The most significant consequence of the move
is that the budgets between the different sections
will now be shared, and control of faculty billets
will be centralized.
Etchemendy described the move as keeping
with an increasing emphasis on interdisciplinary
research, citing opportunities for "innovative" re
search and academic activity.
Ex Officio
The Senate voted to establish a firm rationale

for determining "ex officio" membership in the
body that is, membership based on holding a
particular University position, rather than due to
election by the faculty. Ex officio members, under
Senate rules, "have all perquisites of member
ship," including speaking privileges, but are not
entitled to vote under normal circumstances.
Previously, ex officio members had been se
lected on an ad hoc basis, and had typically in
cluded key campus administrators. The proposed
revision alters that arrangement to make ex offi
cio membership of the Senate simply include the
Academic Secretary and all of the members of
the Executive Cabinet, the "academic leader
ship" of the University the president, the
provost, the deans of the seven schools, the vice
provost and dean of research, the vice provost for
undergraduate education, the vice provost for
graduate education, the director of SLAC Na
tional Accelerator Laboratory and the director
of the Hoover Institution.
The Senate passed the revision by a razor-thin
margin, 16-15, prompting some laughter over a
potential recount.
The practical effect of this revision for the
2010-11 academic year assuming that no posts
see a change of administrators will be the re
moval of membership for Vice Provost for Stu
dent Affairs Greg Boardman and University Li
brarian Michael Keller, and the addition of
Hoover Institution Director John Raisian.
The Senate retained the option to invite
Boardman and Keller, among others, as "stand
ing guests" with restricted speaking privileges.
Faculty Retirements
The provost also spoke Thursday about facul
ty retirement. Owing to the combined effects of
tenure and a profession where the "incentive to
retire is unusually low," colleges and universities
have dealt for decades with the challenge of en-
