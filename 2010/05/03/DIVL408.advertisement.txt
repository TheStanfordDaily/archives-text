The Stanford University Center for Integration of Research on Genetics and Ethics (CIRGE) and the Center
for Law and the Biosciences (CLB) invite you to:
CIRGE/CLB Conference
This whole day conference will address the potential scientific, ethical, social and policy implications of the
novel prenatal genetic testing technique known as maternal scrum cell-free fetal DNA testing. This new develop
ment allows for genetic testing very early in pregnancy without any procedures more invasive than a blood draw.
Some questions that will be addressed include: What is the science behind maternal serum cell-free fetal DNA
testing?; How may patients and providers utilize or reject this technique?; What considerations may be important
for clinical decision-making and insurance coverage involving this novel technique?; and What is the disability
rights perspective on this issue?
The Coming Revolution in Prenatal Genetic Testing?
Scientific, Ethical, Social and Policy Responses to
