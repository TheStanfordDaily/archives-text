ADVANCED TRUSTEE STRATEGIES'
invites you to a Free Educational Workshop on
The 7 BIGGEST MISTAKES•
TRUSTEES OFTEN MAKE
Sound Familiar 7 .
Congratulations! You've established your own Trust, the first step to securing
your financial future. Today, many people have created trusts as a means of
ensuring the orderly transition of their estate. A trust can serve as a sophisticated
management & investment planning vehicle in a complex world. Most persons
named as trustees do not have the required skills and knowledge demanded
by today's courts. Only a few fully understand the obligations and liabilities
associated with serving as a trustee.
The role of a trustee requires more than simply signing documents.
Family trusts often unravel due to time, circumstance, improper planning and implementation. Proper planning & education can help ensure that your desires become
reality for future generations. Sadly, most trustees fail to adequately understand the significance of their responsibilities. Learn how not to fail as a trustee. This workshop
will provide essential training for trustees & trustors of living trusts.
