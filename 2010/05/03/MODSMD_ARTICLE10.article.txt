## A 						walk on the Wild Side 
### ZOELEAVITT STAFF WRITER 
Existential questions have a
way of flowing through the
brain when you wake up at
5:30 a.m. on a moonlit Sat
urday morning. Questions
like, "What path has my life taken to
this moment?" and "Why am I biking
across campus on three hours
sleep?"
The answer? Walk The Farm.
This ambitious annual event, now
in its fourth year, takes a select group
of undergraduates, biologists, profes
sors and others on a 21-mile walk
around the perimeter of Stanford
land. Led by Jon Christensen and
David Kennedy '63, co-director and
executive director of the Bill Lane
Center for the American West, re
spectively, the route meanders from
Y2E2, around Lake Lag, past the
Dish and under route 280, through
Jasper Ridge, around SLAC, down
Sand Hill Road and finally loops
back around the Quad.
This year's walk focused on cli
mate change; at various stops
throughout the walk, Stanford scien
tists met with the group for short
talks about environmental shifts. By
exploring the outer reaches of cam
pus, Walk the Farm aims to use Stan
ford as a microcosm of the American
West to display the changes climate
change has wrought on the environ
ment.
After signing a rather intimidat
ing waiver form, the group of 43 set
off from Y2E2 shortly after 6 a.m.
The light of the day was just begin
ning to shine, and an "if these people
can do it, I certainly can do it" senti
ment seemed common among the
younger set of walkers.
After rounding Lake Lag, we en
tered the Dish by Narnia and started
up the hill, with a short introductory
talk by Christensen. With less than a
mile under our belts, spirits were

high. Past the Dish, we took a sharp
left turn off the path into the fields,
trekking through tall grasses. Talk of
butterfly biology, poison ivy versus
poison oak and species extinction
filled the air.
The first thing I learned from the
Walk Stanford supports a heck of
a lot of cows. More cows than any
university should know what to do
with. We walked past their dour
stares on our way out of the Dish
area, through a tunnel under the 280
freeway. Soon, we approached a mas
sive, ridged grass hill the dam for
Felt Reservoir, a body of water on
Stanford land. Upon our approach, a
massive hare raced in front of us and
across the entire dam. Flocks of birds
scattered. The cows relaxing around
the water's edge showed little emo
tion.

We stopped at Felt Reservoir,
where we learned about how climate
change would push snowmelt earlier
and earlier, depleting the water re
sources for later in the season. It
seems that Stanford's penchant for
palm trees apparently has a cost:
over one million gallons of water per
day are used up for irrigation around
campus. Though Stanford uses only
about one percent of the area's
water, the school is currently turning
its focus toward increased efficiency
and reuse methods.

By 8:30 a.m., a time when I'm nor
mally turning over to avoid the sun in
my eyes, we had already hiked six

■ i ippm vfippaw i -
miles and were arriving at our first
bathroom stop. The Sag wagon (Sup
plies And Gear) carted a few hikers
home at that point, before we set off
for Jasper Ridge.
The second thing I learned on the
Walk Stanford owns a heck of a
lot of land. Most students only ever
see a small fraction. Our walk to
Jasper Ridge took us through Webb
Ranch, a private farm on land that
Stanford owns but has leased out for
years. Then, of course, there's Jasper
Ridge itself. A stunning 1,189 acres of
rolling hills and waving grasses, the
Ridge is closed to visitors except on
organized tours.
However, the Ridge may not look
the same for much longer. Scott
Loarie, a post-doctoral fellow in
global ecology, described the harm
global warming inflicts on native but-

terfly populations. While areas of
Jasper Ridge were once teeming with
butterflies, as temperatures began to
rise, group after group has gone ex
tinct. One species of butterfly has
died out from Jasper Ridge entirely,
and the nearest population now re
sides near San Jose. Loarie told us to
reshape our thinking about global
warming from degrees per year into
kilometers per degree: As tempera
tures rise, how far will animal popu
lations have to migrate to reach cli
mates in which they can still survive?
The answer, often, is too far in too
short a time.
We moved on. I encountered my

first rattlesnake curled up under a
bush, we could still see the lump in its
belly from its last meal. 1 envied that
snake.
The third thing I learned com
fortable shoes may not feel so com
fortable after 12 miles through mud
and up hills. The last mile and a half
before lunch, my toes were crying
out for mercy.
Finally, 12.6 miles in, we arrived at
Jasper Ridge's Leslie Shao-ming Sun
Field Station, where bagged lunches
were waiting for us. Bill Lane himself
made an appearance, decked out in a
Navajo print jacket, bright red shirt,
cowboy hat and turquoise neckband.
At the ripe age of 91, he was quite the
personality, pulling me in to kiss me
on the cheek when I introduced my
self as a Daily reporter.
"The West is the ideal laboratory

for this kind of study because of the
diversity and geography of the 13
Western states," Lane said.
The group, from undergraduates
enrolled in Christensen's class to
Pulitzer Prize winning historians, re
ceived a first-hand illustration of
changes taking place throughout the
American West and the world
and perhaps the Walk, for some pay
ing close attention, helped encour
age a new generation to come up
with innovative climate change solu
tions.

After signing a rather intimidat
ing waiver form, the group of 43 set
off from Y2E2 shortly after 6 a.m.
The light of the day was just begin
ning to shine, and an "if these people
can do it, I certainly can do it" senti
ment seemed common among the
younger set of walkers.
After rounding Lake Lag, we en
tered the Dish by Narnia and started
up the hill, with a short introductory
talk by Christensen. With less than a
mile under our belts, spirits were

high. Past the Dish, we took a sharp
left turn off the path into the fields,
trekking through tall grasses. Talk of
butterfly biology, poison ivy versus
poison oak and species extinction
filled the air.
The first thing I learned from the
Walk Stanford supports a heck of
a lot of cows. More cows than any
university should know what to do
with. We walked past their dour
stares on our way out of the Dish
area, through a tunnel under the 280
freeway. Soon, we approached a mas
sive, ridged grass hill the dam for
Felt Reservoir, a body of water on
Stanford land. Upon our approach, a
massive hare raced in front of us and
across the entire dam. Flocks of birds
scattered. The cows relaxing around
the water's edge showed little emo
tion.

We stopped at Felt Reservoir,
where we learned about how climate
change would push snowmelt earlier
and earlier, depleting the water re
sources for later in the season. It
seems that Stanford's penchant for
palm trees apparently has a cost:
over one million gallons of water per
day are used up for irrigation around
campus. Though Stanford uses only
about one percent of the area's
water, the school is currently turning
its focus toward increased efficiency
and reuse methods.

By 8:30 a.m., a time when I'm nor
mally turning over to avoid the sun in
my eyes, we had already hiked six

■ i ippm vfippaw i -
miles and were arriving at our first
bathroom stop. The Sag wagon (Sup
plies And Gear) carted a few hikers
home at that point, before we set off
for Jasper Ridge.
The second thing I learned on the
Walk Stanford owns a heck of a
lot of land. Most students only ever
see a small fraction. Our walk to
Jasper Ridge took us through Webb
Ranch, a private farm on land that
Stanford owns but has leased out for
years. Then, of course, there's Jasper
Ridge itself. A stunning 1,189 acres of
rolling hills and waving grasses, the
Ridge is closed to visitors except on
organized tours.
However, the Ridge may not look
the same for much longer. Scott
Loarie, a post-doctoral fellow in
global ecology, described the harm
global warming inflicts on native but-

terfly populations. While areas of
Jasper Ridge were once teeming with
butterflies, as temperatures began to
rise, group after group has gone ex
tinct. One species of butterfly has
died out from Jasper Ridge entirely,
and the nearest population now re
sides near San Jose. Loarie told us to
reshape our thinking about global
warming from degrees per year into
kilometers per degree: As tempera
tures rise, how far will animal popu
lations have to migrate to reach cli
mates in which they can still survive?
The answer, often, is too far in too
short a time.
We moved on. I encountered my

first rattlesnake curled up under a
bush, we could still see the lump in its
belly from its last meal. 1 envied that
snake.
The third thing I learned com
fortable shoes may not feel so com
fortable after 12 miles through mud
and up hills. The last mile and a half
before lunch, my toes were crying
out for mercy.
Finally, 12.6 miles in, we arrived at
Jasper Ridge's Leslie Shao-ming Sun
Field Station, where bagged lunches
were waiting for us. Bill Lane himself
made an appearance, decked out in a
Navajo print jacket, bright red shirt,
cowboy hat and turquoise neckband.
At the ripe age of 91, he was quite the
personality, pulling me in to kiss me
on the cheek when I introduced my
self as a Daily reporter.
"The West is the ideal laboratory

for this kind of study because of the
diversity and geography of the 13
Western states," Lane said.
The group, from undergraduates
enrolled in Christensen's class to
Pulitzer Prize winning historians, re
ceived a first-hand illustration of
changes taking place throughout the
American West and the world
and perhaps the Walk, for some pay
ing close attention, helped encour
age a new generation to come up
with innovative climate change solu
tions.
