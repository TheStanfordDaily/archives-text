With Admit
Weekend just
concluded,
Stanford stu
dents can all re
member a time when they were
ProFros, itching to escape the
clutches of their parents and
strike out into the world on their
own, as adults, for the first time.
Yet, for a small number of
Stanford students each year, the
"as adults" part doesn't apply.
The select group that entered
Stanford before turning 18 is an
invisible minority, difficult to
identify by any conventional
means.
For Frank Liu 'l3, who came
to Stanford fall quarter at age
16, such anonymity is a good
thing, both academically and so
cially.
"Everyone here really treats

me like I'm just another 18 year
old or 19 year old," Liu said. "It's
just like I'm one of them."
According to data supplied
by the Registrar's office, Liu is
just one of 54 freshmen aged 17
or younger who entered Stan
ford this year, out of a total
freshman class of 1,692 stu
dents. These numbers indicate
that about 3 percent of incom
ing students were not legal
adults in September (though
there is no data on how many
have turned 18 since entering).
Only one upperclassman
started in the fall younger than
18, suggesting that most under
age students enter at 17 and turn
18 at some point between the
start of their freshman and
sophomore years.
Perhaps contrary to expecta
tions, official University policy
does not differ in most respects
when dealing with these stu
dents.

Shawn Abbott, the director
of admissions, wrote in an e
mail to The Daily that, while the
University does receive "sever
al" applications from students
younger than most, these appli
cations are put through the
exact same admissions process
as all other candidates, with no
differences in evaluation proce
dures.

"Their age isn't an advan
tage, nor is it a disadvantage," he
said.

While these applicants are
not given any special considera
tion in the academic evaluation
process, Abbott said that his de
partment strives to ensure that
younger applicants are mature
enough to handle living in Stan
ford's residential system along
side their older colleagues.
"We require any admitted
student who will be under 16 at
the time of entry to interview
with senior administrators, to
ensure that the student is ready
to be in a residential environ
ment with older students," he
said.

In an e-mail to The Daily,
Deborah Golder, the dean of
residential education, elaborat
ed further on why Stanford has
chosen to treat underage stu

dents as though they are legal
adults.

"We have an expectation
that every student who lives
with us in the dorms is offered
the same amount of resources
and services â€”we expect all
students to be responsible for
themselves and responsible to
others, regardless of their age,"
she said. "We will treat all of our
students, regardless of age, simi
larly there are no 'special
dorms' that are assigned. Each
student has his/her own prefer
ences or needs, and we work to
honor those."
Golder also said that Stan
ford doesn't want to play any
role in attaching a social or aca
demic "stigma" based on a stu
dent's age.
Lena Potts 'l3, who started
fall quarter at age 16, shared
Golder's outlook.

"I don't think anyone would
have known unless I had told
them," Potts said. "I don't think
anyone can really tell how old I
am.

"My friends have always
been older than me," she contin
ued. "It's not a social issue."
While Liu and Potts both
consider themselves to be no
different than their older peers,

Danny Gould 'l3, Liu's room
mate, felt that age does matter
and expressed concerns that
younger students lack a level of
social experience and maturity.
"When people find out, they
look at [Liu] differently," he
said. "16 is still child status. His
maturity level is that of a college
student, but his life experience
is not that of a college student."
However, Gould did contin
ue on to say that his roommate's
age had not caused any academ
ic difficulties and few social
ones throughout the year.
Another student, Brogan
Miller 'l3, echoed Gould's sen
timents, especially about life ex
perience.

"Obviously, they're intelli
gent enough to be here," he said.
"But I feel that, in certain social
circumstances, they're imma
ture, and it's not their fault."
Still, Miller doesn't mind too
much.

"They're amazing people
and I love them to death," he
said.
