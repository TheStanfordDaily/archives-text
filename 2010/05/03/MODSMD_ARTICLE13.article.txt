# OPINIONS
## EDITORIAL Sustainability should be added to Citizenship GER options 
### 
Whatever feelings some students
might have toward IHUM or the
University's General Education
Requirements (GER), nobody can accuse
the University of ignoring student input on
academics. From mid- and end-quarter
course evaluations to the recently-convened
Study of Undergraduate Education at Stan
ford (SUES), the administration has consis
tently demonstrated a dynamic responsive
ness to incorporating student suggestions
into the curriculum. Most recently, the Uni
versity has taken into consideration a pro
posal submitted by Students for a Sustain
able Stanford (SSS) to add a sustainability
option to the Education for Citizenship re
quirement.

The Editorial Board applauds SSS for co
ordinating this effort and urges the Universi
ty to follow through with this addition. While
the Editorial Board has commented exten
sively on the importance of sustainability in
the past, the Board also supports this propos
al because of the purposeful precision with
which it was created.

Firstly, the decision to include sustainabil
ity as an optional method of fulfilling the Cit
izenship requirement is much less intrusive
than establishing a required component of
the GER solely for sustainability students
who would rather not enroll in a course on
sustainability are free to choose from the
other options available to fulfill the Citizen
ship requirement. As one of five options in
the Citizenship category, the addition of sus
tainability to the list would be a boon for stu
dents interested in the field, while the rest of
the student body would be under no obliga
tion to choose sustainability over any of the
other options.
The authors of the proposal explicitly ad
dress related concerns, stating, "We seek to
build an intellectual tool, rather than a be
havioral or ideological prescription; this is

not an environmental literacy requirement."
The proposal goes on to aptly frame this
"tool" as a conception of inter-temporal as
pects of citizenship a counterpart to the
international and interpersonal perspectives
of the global community or gender options.
Given this objective, the submitted list of
sample courses fit nicely. Rather than solely
focusing on technical aspects of environmen
tal science or clean technologies, most of the
classes center more on integrating a wide
range of global and generational conse
quences. At a very basic level, the inclusion of
these classes just makes sense. If a course on
"The Ethics of Environmental Choices" does
not contribute to good citizenship in this day
and age, then what does?
Including these types of classes as GERs
will legitimize their value while increasing in
centive to enroll. Many students with a pass
ing interest in sustainability would benefit
from taking a sustainability course, but can
not spare the units for a course unrelated to
their major or other requirements. Increas
ing access to these classes might be the most
important thing environmentally-interested
students can accomplish. The Earth systems
majors that graduate from Stanford will
work to make a sustainable impact through
their careers in business and government.
But if the public policy majors, the engineers,
doctors, lawyers and businesspeople can in
corporate these concerns into their mindsets,
then the reach of these classes will extend
much further.

Combating climate change, resource
shortages and the global equity challenges of
the 21st century will require an environmen
tally knowledgeable citizenry, not just a mi
nority of dedicated specialists. We hope that
Stanford continues to do everything in its
power to make that need a reality, starting
with the addition of sustainability to the Ed
ucation for Citizenship requirements.
