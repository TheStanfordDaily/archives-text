# UNFASHIONABLE NONSENSE
## Vindicating Messiness 
### Emily Hulme 
A generous observer might call my
room a rat's nest. However, I think
most rats consider it beneath them to
keep a pair of avocadoes and an assortment
of books by Nietzsche in their nests.
Less generous observers might re
mind me that "cleanliness is next to godli
ness." This is an insidious lie, and hardly even
clever. Who takes in the world, looks at the
vast array of messes animal, plant, amoe
boid and proclaims, with a grand gesture,
the insight that some great God made the
world, and filled it with strife, combat, contra
diction and, above all, crazy cat ladies and
hoarders, but nonetheless, clearly deigned to
give his creation, mostly, an overwhelming
sense of organization ? Indeed, as time rolls
on, it seems the only rule is increasing en
tropy and heat leaking out of all of our me
chanical processes.
So, if God subscribes to any princi
ple, it isn't cleanliness. Frankly, he probably
has more important things to do than fuss
about the alphabetization of planet Earth.
And, moreover, if the world was developed
with divine OCD, I imagine all the elements
would be stacked in separate rows, neatly
filed away and useless for breathing, repro
ducing and generally shuffling about from
rocks to oceans to bodies. Most life relies not
just on this disorganization, but even dirti
ness and contamination. Sterility, of course,
demands the termination of life. Cleanliness,
then, earns neither the sanction of God nor
primitive life. If it is good , it is on exclusively
human terms, methinks.
This, anyways, is what I tell myself,
when surrounded by stacks of old biology
exams, semi-washed glasses and receipts for
the books I bought for IHUM. But really, the
truth of the matter is that cleaning is just not
a priority of mine. I, like everyone, have
found myself with too many opportunities
and not enough time. And, like everyone,
conscious or not, I perform the rationalizing
calculus everyday, and estimate the utility of
one option relative to another. Perhaps I can
spend my free hour between class and meet
ing reading, or spending time with friends, or
watching "The Hills." I embrace one choice,
and discard the others. I only share with a se
lect few other perpetually disgruntled com
rades, though, the opinion that there's really
no such thing as "I Don't Have Time."
"I Don't Have Time," a statement
which also goes under the alias "I'm Too
Busy," is what socially apt people say when
they determine not to spend time on various
"good" uses of time. It's also a white lie we

tell ourselves. For the socially inept, i.e. me,
the appropriate way to say this is, "I decided
not to spend time on this." In fact, like the fat
kid at recess, I straight up cut that activity
from the team, and/or put it so low on my list
of priorities that I de facto made it impossible
that I would make time for it. It's not like
God-on-high, taking a break from avoiding
organizing creation with supplies from the
Container Store, floated down and stole time
from a select few of his favorite great apes. In
fact, a little known but actually true fact is
that each person has 24 hours a day.
Everyone has the time, but makes
their own priorities. It's not that it's wrong to
rank school over relationships, or term pa
pers over reading "Infinite Jest." Indeed, I'd
say it's just prudent to put working towards
your career aspirations over spending time
feeding ducks and watching "The Daily
Show." But it's not that we don't have time
for the latter it's that we chose not to
make time for the latter. And that's why I
have old magazines, wrinkled clothes and av
ocadoes riddled across my room.

Emily does prioritize reading her inbox, even if
it's just as cluttered as the rest of her life. Join in

I, like everyone, have
found myself with too
many opportunities and
not enough time.
