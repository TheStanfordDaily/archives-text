# THE 						GAO REPORT
## Advising: An Individual's Responsibility 
### Shelley Gao 
Last week, I compared the need to ex
pand resources for students interested
in attaining advanced degrees in non
professional schools to the perpetual imper
ative for pre-maj or advising reform. After re
ceiving some responses to my column, it ap
pears that the University has adopted struc
tural improvements for the Class of 2012 and
2013.

The changes look fine. We complain
about advising all the time. But, seriously,
how much reform can the University realisti
cally implement, anyway? I argue that the
current framework is adequate. Only two
things matter: encouraging more tenure
track faculty to participate and care about
pre-major advising and making students un
derstand that advising is ultimately their re
sponsibility.

From an official source in Under
graduate Advising and Research (UAR),
three major alterations have occurred since
my freshman year. Starting with the Class of
2012, an Academic Director is assigned to
each residence. The intent is for these Acad
emic Directors to remain a resource for stu
dents until major declaration in sophomore
year. Undoubtedly, they serve a useful role in
addressing a broad spectrum of academic is
sues in the preliminary stages of one's Stan
ford career, ranging from illuminating aca
demic opportunities on campus and helping
with course sequencing to providing support
for freshmen adapting to college life.
In this academic year alone, I have
been told that 4,601 individual undergradu
ates have met with UAR advisers, which in
clude Academic Directors and staff in Sweet
Hall and the Athletic Academic Resource
Center. Clearly, these advisers play a tremen
dously useful role in undergraduate educa
tion. I have found them to be wonderfully
caring individuals, adept at strategic plan
ning. They are particularly helpful in sooth
ing my doubts and devising how to best ap
proach faculty with my plans.
Second, attention has been devoted
to enhancing academic programming for

sophomores. Activities like the Sophomore
Symposium and Majors Night are designed
to help students research different interests
or hone in to their specific interests. Third,
the University has taken steps to strengthen
the pre-major advisers system, where faculty
and staff volunteer to serve as advisers for
eight freshmen. Additional faculty members
have been recruited and any staff that serve
in that role now are required to have an ad
vanced degree. Among all these reforms, it is
pre-major advising that matters most. Al
though we have a terrific group of profes
sional staff, their primary role should be to
connect students to the faculty. Nothing can
replace interaction with actual scholars in a
field.

There is not much the University
can do in terms of encouraging faculty to
serve as pre-major advisers. After the Vice
Provost for Undergraduate Education's
(VPUE) cut in honoraria for pre-major fac
ulty advising during the budget crisis last
year, faculty will now have even less incen
tive to invest their time in freshman advising.
This will exacerbate the concern that incom
ing students receive poorly matched advis
ers.

The first interaction almost all Stan
ford students have with faculty is during a 20
minute meeting with their adviser during
New Student Orientation. I recall my nerv
ous excitement manifested in over-prepara
tion for that meeting two years ago. After re
viewing the Stanford Bulletin and going
through my major requirements, I printed
out a discussion agenda and a carefully con
structed four year plan. For some, this very

first meeting could lead to a long and fruitful
mentorship experience. For others, it did not
last beyond that day. I belonged to the latter
category. Sure, sometimes things work out
and other times they do not. Cultivating
mentorships can certainly be interpreted as a
process of experimentation.
However, the steep gradation of
satisfaction reported in pre-major advising
suggests that not all faculty approach fresh
men advising with the same degree of com
mitment. Personality fit, temperament and
worldview, in addition to intellectual inter
ests, do play a significant role in forming and
sustaining advising relationships, but it is also
the mindset of approaching these interac
tions that is instrumental. Freshmen tend to
take these interactions very seriously.
ProFros were asking me about reading lists
and syllabi for classes during Admit Week
end last week, even before they were en
rolled at Stanford.

Looking back, my path has not fol
lowed my initial four year plan at all. Perhaps
that is a good thing. An organic evolution and
sometimes even accidental discovery of our
interests may be a more rewarding journey.
For those students who are left rather disillu
sioned with their assigned adviser, there are
numerous opportunities along the Stanford
trajectory to find faculty mentors. Whether it
is through working as a research assistant or
taking seminars, the potential to cultivate ex
cellent advising relationships is definitely
possible.

Ultimately, the burden for cultivat
ing faculty advisers lies with the individual
students. The University certainly can do
more to increase tenure track faculty partici
pation. But, Stanford already offers a good
framework, and most importantly, a collec
tion of some of the world's most brilliant
scholars. It is up to the student to adopt a
proactive approach in his or her intellectual
development.
