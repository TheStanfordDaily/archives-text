Chants of "This is our house!"
filled Maples Pavilion as the No. 1
Stanford men's volleyball team put
away the final points to clinch the
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation
(MPSF) Tournament title on Satur
day.

With a win over No. 3 seed Cal
State Northridge (23-9), the Card
(22-6) won its first MPSF Tourna
ment since 1997. In addition, Stan
ford became the first MPSF team to
win both the regular season and
postseason tournament since Pep
perdine in 2005.

"It validates us as the true winner
of the toughest conference in colle
giate athletics," said senior setter
Kawika Shoji. "There are no ques
tions as to who the best MPSF team
was this year."

But the Card's final obstacle was
not an easy one the Matadors
were the only MPSF team that Stan
ford had not yet beaten this season,
falling first in January and again in
April. This time, however, proved to
be a different story.
"We were just really confident
this time, whereas last time our of
fense wasn't as smooth, and we
weren't playing very confidently,"
said junior outside hitter Spencer
McLachlin. "It also helps that we
were at home with 1,000 screaming
fans in costume."

"Not only did we just execute the
game plan more effectively," Kawika
Shoji added, "we are just overall a
much different, a much better team
now than when we played them last."
From the first point, Stanford
came out swinging. McLachlin
aided by strong blocking from soph
omore middle blocker Gus Ellis,
sophomore outside hitter Brad Law
son and senior opposite Evan
Romero went on a 10-serve run
to give the Card a 14-2 lead.
But Northridge provided a strong
response to Stanford's dominant
start. Bolstered by numerous Cardi
nal hitting errors, the Matadors went
on their own nine-point run, bringing
the score within two at 20-18. But
when the momentum appeared to be
in the Matadors' hands, powerful
swings from Lawson and Romero re

asserted Stanford's offense. A smart
ly placed Kawika Shoji serve fell un
touched in the center of the court to
win the set, 30-24.
"We never panicked," Kawika
Shoji commented on Northridge's
strong mid-game surge. "They start
ed making plays, and we just had to
settle down again. We did a good job
of being resilient."

"It was a real testament to our de
termination," McLachlin agreed.
"After losing such a big lead, most
teams would have lost that game, but
we persevered and finished strong."

The second set was the closest of
the evening, and points went back
and forth to the end. Ellis was a
major presence at the net from the
start, killing two quick sets in the
middle, followed by a deafening solo
block several plays later.
Again, Stanford struggled in the
middle of the game, with an illegal
back row attack, followed by a ball
hit wide to the right, a missed serve
and a Northridge kill on an over
passed ball. The Matadors were up
