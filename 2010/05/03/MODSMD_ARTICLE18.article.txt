## Huskies sweep Stanford in Seattle 
### DANIEL BOHM SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
No. 18 Stanford's (21-17, 10-8)
schizophrenic baseball season con
tinued this weekend with a sweep at
the hands of Washington (24-19,8-7)
in Seattle.

Coming off two consecutive
sweeps of Pac-10 Conference oppo
nents, the Cardinal looked poised to
make a bid for a conference title. But
the Huskies, who by all indications
appeared to be a lesser opponent,
sent the Cardinal home with three
losses, including a heartbreaking 15-
inning loss on Sunday.
Surprisingly, Stanford's bats,
which had been hot against OSU and
Cal the last two weeks, went ice cold
this weekend. The team only scored
six runs in the three losses.

These deficiencies in hitting
spoiled good pitching performances,
especially by sophomore Brett
Mooneyham on Friday and the trio
of junior Alex Pracher and sopho
mores Brian Busick and Scott
Snodgress on Sunday.
On Friday, Mooneyham did all he
could to keep the Cardinal in the
game, going eight innings and strik
ing out 13 Husky hitters while allow
ing just two earned runs on four hits
and a season-low two walks.

Unfortunately, the Cardinal de
fense let Mooneyham down, allow
ing two unearned runs on errors by
junior shortstop Jake Schlander and
junior first baseman Jonathan
Kaskow in the first inning. The Car
dinal had three errors in the game,
and mustered just six hits in the 4-2
loss.

Stanford's only runs came in the
top of the fifth on a two-RBI double
by freshman left fielder Stephen Pis
cotty, cutting the Husky lead to 3-2.

Freshman left fielder Stephen Piscotty's double gave the only two Card runs in Friday's disappointing
game against the Huskies. No. 18 Stanford was swept for all three games in Seattle.
