## Huskies sweep Stanford in Seattle 
### DANIEL BOHM SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
No. 18 Stanford's (21-17, 10-8)
schizophrenic baseball season con
tinued this weekend with a sweep at
the hands of Washington (24-19,8-7)
in Seattle.

Coming off two consecutive
sweeps of Pac-10 Conference oppo
nents, the Cardinal looked poised to
make a bid for a conference title. But
the Huskies, who by all indications
appeared to be a lesser opponent,
sent the Cardinal home with three
losses, including a heartbreaking 15-
inning loss on Sunday.
Surprisingly, Stanford's bats,
which had been hot against OSU and
Cal the last two weeks, went ice cold
this weekend. The team only scored
six runs in the three losses.

These deficiencies in hitting
spoiled good pitching performances,
especially by sophomore Brett
Mooneyham on Friday and the trio
of junior Alex Pracher and sopho
mores Brian Busick and Scott
Snodgress on Sunday.
On Friday, Mooneyham did all he
could to keep the Cardinal in the
game, going eight innings and strik
ing out 13 Husky hitters while allow
ing just two earned runs on four hits
and a season-low two walks.

Unfortunately, the Cardinal de
fense let Mooneyham down, allow
ing two unearned runs on errors by
junior shortstop Jake Schlander and
junior first baseman Jonathan
Kaskow in the first inning. The Car
dinal had three errors in the game,
and mustered just six hits in the 4-2
loss.

Stanford's only runs came in the
top of the fifth on a two-RBI double
by freshman left fielder Stephen Pis
cotty, cutting the Husky lead to 3-2.


BRYAN LIN/The Stanford Daily
Freshman left fielder Stephen Piscotty's double gave the only two Card runs in Friday's disappointing
game against the Huskies. No. 18 Stanford was swept for all three games in Seattle.
Later in the inning, with the bases
loaded and one out, Schlander lined
out to third, and freshman third
baseman Kenny Diekroeger
grounded out to end Stanford's only
threat.
Mooneyham (1-5) took the loss
while Washington's Forrest Snow (4-
1) went 2.2 innings of hitless relief
for the win.
Stanford appeared star-struck at
Saturday's game, playing under the
lights at Safeco Field, home of Major
League Baseball's Seattle Mariners,
and losing 9-1.
Sophomore pitcher Jordan Pries
(3-2) got hit around for the Cardinal,
while for the second consecutive
day, the Stanford defense let its
pitcher down. The Cardinal made
four errors, leading to three Flusky
runs.
Pries took the loss, going 4.1 in
nings and allowing six runs, only
three earned, on five hits.
Diekroeger was the offensive star
for Stanford with three hits.
Andrew Kittredge (6-3) got the
win for Washington, going 7.1 in
nings and allowing just one run and

striking out eight.
Sunday's game was the most ex
citing of the three, a 15-inning 4-3
Washington victory. The teams were
in their 10th consecutive inning of
scoreless baseball when pinch run
ner Sean Meehan scored on
Pracher's wild pitch with two outs in
the bottom of the 15th.
Pracher (6-3) had the longest out
ing of his career, going 7.2 in relief
and allowing just the one run on
three hits, along with five walks and
five strikeouts.
The Cardinal offense, which took
a two run lead in the top of the first
on two Washington fielding errors,
was again led by Diekroeger, who
had his third consecutive multi-hit
game, going 3-7. Despite his three
hits, however, Diekroeger had a
chance to give Stanford the lead in
the top of the 12th with runners on
first and third and one out, but he
grounded into a fielder's choice with
junior second baseman Colin Walsh
being tagged out at home.
Stanford doesn't have any time to
rest, as it plays host to Santa Clara
today and San Jose State tomorrow
at Sunken Diamond, before heading
on a nonconference road trip to
Long Beach State next weekend.
