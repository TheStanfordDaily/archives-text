## Arizona State shuts down comeback 
### KABIR SAWHNEY DESK EDITOR 
Though it snapped a seven-game losing streak in the middle
of last week against San Jose State, the Stanford softball team
continued to struggle against Pac-10 competition. Over the
weekend, it dropped two of three games to No. 7 Arizona State
(39-11,8-7 Pac-10). The No. 14 Cardinal (32-14,5-10) has now
lost its last three conference series, including sweeps at the
hands of Arizona and UCLA.
"We still have to execute a few things," said head coach John
Rittman. "We have to get a few timely hits and eliminate some
base running mistakes ... against this competition, you almost
have to play perfect."
The first game of the series was a pitcher's duel, matching
junior pitcher Ashley Chinn against ASU's Hillary Bach, the ace

"Bach's a really good pitcher," said senior left fielder Alissa

The top three hitters in ASU's lineup center fielder Les
ley Rogers, designated player Taylor Haro and shortstop Kate
lyn Boyd proved to be the toughest challenge for Chinn.The
three hitters went a combined 4-9, with Rogers scoring twice
and Boyd driving in two runs.
Senior third baseman Shannon Koplitz was the only Stan
ford batter to get a hit in the game.
Saturday's game was a stark reversal of fortune for both
teams. Stanford won the game, 8-0, in a five inning game short
ened by the run rule.
Freshman pitcher Jenna Rich handily shut down the ASU
lineup. Over five innings, she gave up just two hits and one walk
on an efficient 57 pitches.
With the Sun Devils resting Bach, the Cardinal offense took
advantage of pitchers Sam Parlich and Megan Elliott. Parlich
started the game, but only lasted 0.1 innings after giving up four
runs.
After that outburst, Stanford would not look back. Though
Elliott met with slightly more success, Stanford still managed to
get two runs in the second inning and then one each in the fourth
and fifth innings to run-rule the Sun Devils. Elliott pitched four
