## Arizona State shuts down comeback 
### KABIR SAWHNEY DESK EDITOR 
Though it snapped a seven-game losing streak in the middle
of last week against San Jose State, the Stanford softball team
continued to struggle against Pac-10 competition. Over the
weekend, it dropped two of three games to No. 7 Arizona State
(39-11,8-7 Pac-10). The No. 14 Cardinal (32-14,5-10) has now
lost its last three conference series, including sweeps at the
hands of Arizona and UCLA.
"We still have to execute a few things," said head coach John
Rittman. "We have to get a few timely hits and eliminate some
base running mistakes ... against this competition, you almost
have to play perfect."
The first game of the series was a pitcher's duel, matching
junior pitcher Ashley Chinn against ASU's Hillary Bach, the ace
of the Sun Devils' staff. Though Chinn pitched well, limiting the
Sun Devils to three runs on nine hits, Bach was the better of the
two she gave up just one hit to the Cardinal, despite control
problems that saw her walk four batters and hit three more with
pitches.
"Bach's a really good pitcher," said senior left fielder Alissa
Haber. "She does a really good job of changing planes and spot
ting the corners really well. I think we could have made adjust
ments a little bit better and a little quicker."
The top three hitters in ASU's lineup center fielder Les
ley Rogers, designated player Taylor Haro and shortstop Kate
lyn Boyd proved to be the toughest challenge for Chinn.The
three hitters went a combined 4-9, with Rogers scoring twice
and Boyd driving in two runs.
Senior third baseman Shannon Koplitz was the only Stan
ford batter to get a hit in the game.
Saturday's game was a stark reversal of fortune for both
teams. Stanford won the game, 8-0, in a five inning game short
ened by the run rule.
Freshman pitcher Jenna Rich handily shut down the ASU
lineup. Over five innings, she gave up just two hits and one walk
on an efficient 57 pitches.
With the Sun Devils resting Bach, the Cardinal offense took
advantage of pitchers Sam Parlich and Megan Elliott. Parlich
started the game, but only lasted 0.1 innings after giving up four
runs.
After that outburst, Stanford would not look back. Though
Elliott met with slightly more success, Stanford still managed to
get two runs in the second inning and then one each in the fourth
and fifth innings to run-rule the Sun Devils. Elliott pitched four
innings in total, giving up four runs
and five hits to Stanford's lineup.
Three Cardinal batters distin
guished themselves in the game
Rich, Haber and freshman designated
player Alix Van Zandt. Rich went 3-3
with four RBIs and one run, Haber
went 2-3 with a run scored and Van
Zandt went 2-3 with two RBIs.
Sunday's game was more similar to
the first game of the series. The low
scoring affair was again decided by
each team's pitchers. Despite strong
efforts from Chinn and Rich, who
combined to hold the ASU offense to
three runs, Stanford fell 3-2, losing
both the game and the series.
Bach,in the circle again for the Sun
Devils, did not pitch as strongly as on
Friday she gave up seven hits and
two runs in seven innings pitched. She
seemed to have mastered her control,
however, giving up just two walks and
hitting one batter, and the perform
ance was just good enough to give her
team the win.
Haber and Rich were once again
the top two stars for Stanford's of
fense, going a combined 4-6 with one
RBI.
Stanford is now seventh in the Pac
-10, only ahead of Oregon State. With
just two conference series remaining,
the chances that the Cardinal can
fight its way back into contention
seem slim at best.
However, Rittman's outlook re
mains squarely focused on Stanford's
next few games.
"We're really not worried about
positioning in the Pac-10," he said.
"We are literally taking it one game at
a time, trying to improve and control
the things that we can control in our
program."
"Obviously, losing two out of three

games in the weekend doesn't bode
well for the standings," Haber said.
"This is the best conference in the
country... We'll take it one game at a
time and get ready for the postsea
son."
Stanford will also benefit from the
return of freshman pitcher Teagan
Gerhart, who was the Cardinal's ace
prior to sustaining an injury three
weeks ago. Rittman said that there is
no definite timetable for her return,
and that she is "day-to-day."
Gerhart did play in this weekend's
series, entering Sunday's game as a
pinch runner.
Stanford's next game is this Tues
day at home against Santa Clara at 6
p.m. Its next conference series is this
weekend at No. 1 Washington.
