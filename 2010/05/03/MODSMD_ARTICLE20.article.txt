# NBA and NASCAR loathing

### Daniel Bohm 
If there is one thing young jour
nalists are told, it is to not let
emotions infiltrate your cover
age or writing. Today, I am break
ing the cardinal (no pun intend
ed) rule of journalism.
I am currently sitting in Denver In
ternational Airport waiting for an of
fensively delayed flight back to the
Stanford area, and I am pissed off. In
my rage, I have found inspiration for
my column: the things in sports that I
hate, and I'm not just looking at you,
Cal.
I'll start with the NBA, because it is
a very easy target.
I hate the NBA playoffs. I hate them
not because I dislike basketball or be
cause I don't think there are great play
ers on the court and drama in every se
ries. I hate the NBA playoffs because
they take FOREVER.
The NBA playoffs are a multi
faceted problem. As I've previously
written, there are too many teams
(more than half the league in fact) in
the playoffs, and every series is seven
games.
It is no coincidence that the leagues
(NFL and MLB) that have fewer teams
and fewer games in the playoffs get
higher ratings for those games. Nor is it
hard to believe that the NBA was more
popular back in the 1990s prior to the
lockout, when the first round was a five
game series, not seven.
To make things worse, the teams are
afforded far too many days off. Take the
Milwaukee Bucks-Atlanta Hawks
first-round series. Yesterday they
played Game 7,15 days after playing
Game l.That is more than two days per
game. That is more days off than NHL
players get between playoff games, and
I think you would have to really stretch
to find an argument that basketball
takes a more physical toll on the body
than hockey.
While I'm on the topic of the NBA,
how about teams run an offense for
once, or teams play actual team de
fense?
With all the athletes in the NBA, I'm
not saying that the prevalent one-on
one game isn't entertaining, because
oftentimes it is, but it isn't good basket
ball. Too often, players loaf back on de
fense, never show up on help-side de
fense and rely on teammates to beat
defenders off the dribble, NBA basket
ball, in a sense, is a shell of the game
played in college, which is full of intri
cate offenses (John Calipari-coached
teams aside) and defensive-minded
teams. Plus, there isn't a need to play
music during game play to get the
crowd involved.
Ok, enough ragging on the NBA; it
isn't all I hate.
I also hate lukewarm fans. Yes, I'm
looking at you, USC football fans. Re
member when the Coliseum was half
empty for home games before Pete
Carroll? Me too. I also remember
vividly how quickly you all cleared out
of the stadium when Stanford pounded
you 55-21 this year.
Not only are those fans of the fair
weather variety, I'm not even sure they
root for USC elsewhere. I am not from
