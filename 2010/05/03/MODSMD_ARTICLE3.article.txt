## Granada shower room locks reactivated after peeper 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Kate Abbott 
In response to a peeping torn incident
last Sunday, Student Housing "reactivat
ed" locks to the women's shower rooms
in both the Granada and Eucalipto
dorms in West Lagunita.
According to Executive Director of
Student Housing Rodger Whitney, "lock
able hardware" already existed on the
doors leading to the shower rooms and
was reactivated due to residents' request
following reports that an intruder tried to
peep under a divider while a resident was
showering.
"Residents of Granada and Eucalipto
are now the only ones able to enter these
rooms, using their room keys," Whitney
said in an e-mail to The Daily. "We do not
typically lock bathroom doors, because
students find it to be a significant incon
venience, and because the buildings
themselves are locked 24 hours a day."
Whitney said in situations like Grana
da's, it is "most effective to focus on edu
cation, reminding students and staff to be
aware of strangers in their residences
and to be careful about not allowing 'tail
gaters' to follow them into the building."
Some residents speculated, however,
that the intruder last week entered
Granada through an unlocked breeze
way on the second floor of the building.
In Lagunita dorms, the showers are
separate from the bathrooms, and ac
cording to Whitney, hardware for the
men's shower rooms will be installed as
well. There are not currently plans to lock
any other restrooms on campus.
Shower peeping incidents were re
ported in both Robinson and Branner
earlier this year.
