# Trustees to evaluate investment guidelines
## University to hear student panel recommendation in June 
### AIMEE MILES CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford's Advisory Panel on Investment
Responsibility & Licensing (APIR-L) has
approved a proposal by Stanford's Student
Anti-Genocide Coalition (STAND) that, if
supported by the board of trustees, would
lead the University to acknowledge the po
tential impact of its investments on the cur
rent crisis in the Democratic Republic of the
Congo.
On April 23, the APIR-L voted unani

support shareholder resolutions encouraging
greater transparency and more careful ac
counting from electronics companies in trac

products, according to Mark Landesmann,
who serves on the APIR-L's human rights sub
committee.

"We recommend that the University vote
in favor of well-written and reasonable share
holder resolutions that ask companies for re
ports on their policies and efforts regarding
their avoidance of conflict minerals and con
flict mineral derivatives," APIR-L's statement

"Basically, it's a very mainstream issue and
concern, and there's broad consensus that
there's a big problem here that institutional
investors such as Stanford need to address and
the companies that make products containing
conflict minerals need to address," Landes
mann said.

STAND first approached the administra
tion with its "conflict-free" initiative in Febru
ary. The group expressed its concern over a
growing body of evidence showing that con
sumers and investors indirectly fuel ongoing
violence in the Congo by purchasing electron

ics that are made from minerals sold by armed
rebel groups in the country's lawless eastern
region.

Debilitating rape has become common
place there, and an estimated 5.4 million peo
ple have been killed in the past 15 years, ac
cording to the Enough Project, an anti-geno

The Congo's "conflict minerals," which in
clude tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold, are key
ingredients in cell phones, personal comput
