# Trustees to evaluate investment guidelines
## University to hear student panel recommendation in June 
### AIMEE MILES CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford's Advisory Panel on Investment
Responsibility & Licensing (APIR-L) has
approved a proposal by Stanford's Student
Anti-Genocide Coalition (STAND) that, if
supported by the board of trustees, would
lead the University to acknowledge the po
tential impact of its investments on the cur
rent crisis in the Democratic Republic of the
Congo.
On April 23, the APIR-L voted unani
mously in favor of recommending a proxy vot

ing guideline that would compel Stanford to
support shareholder resolutions encouraging
greater transparency and more careful ac
counting from electronics companies in trac
ing the supply lines of minerals used in their
products, according to Mark Landesmann,
who serves on the APIR-L's human rights sub
committee.

"We recommend that the University vote
in favor of well-written and reasonable share
holder resolutions that ask companies for re
ports on their policies and efforts regarding
their avoidance of conflict minerals and con
flict mineral derivatives," APIR-L's statement

"Basically, it's a very mainstream issue and
concern, and there's broad consensus that
there's a big problem here that institutional
investors such as Stanford need to address and
the companies that make products containing
conflict minerals need to address," Landes
mann said.

STAND first approached the administra
tion with its "conflict-free" initiative in Febru
ary. The group expressed its concern over a
growing body of evidence showing that con
sumers and investors indirectly fuel ongoing
violence in the Congo by purchasing electron

ics that are made from minerals sold by armed
rebel groups in the country's lawless eastern
region.

Debilitating rape has become common
place there, and an estimated 5.4 million peo
ple have been killed in the past 15 years, ac
cording to the Enough Project, an anti-geno
cide advocacy group.
The Congo's "conflict minerals," which in
clude tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold, are key
ingredients in cell phones, personal comput
ers, portable music players and an array of
other appliances. The rebel groups
who control their distribution earn
an estimated $lBO million a year
from the mineral trade, the Enough
Project has said.

The APIR-L's final 7-0 vote in
favor of STAND'S proposal came de
spite initial objections from panelists
who were wary of demonstrating the
University's partiality to a specific
cause and from those who feared a
dearth of research on the subject,
Landesmann said.

The panel's support sets a new
precedent in institutional recogni
tion of conflict minerals as a viable,
pressing issue, said Mia Newman 'l2,
the advocacy director for STAND.
"This is an opportunity for a uni
versity to be at the forefront of this
issue," Newman said.
To his knowledge, Fandesmann
added, "this is the first time any
major university has taken any ac
tion about this issue. It's rare for
Stanford to act alone and break the
silence."

But even if the measure is ap
proved by the board of trustees, it
would steer several paces clear of de

manding an explicit change in prac
tice from firms that Stanford invests
in and, in keeping with University
policy, would only require Stanford
to support other shareholders' reso
lutions regarding conflict-free invest
ments, rather than draft its own, Lan
desmann explained.

"Stanford has made it clear that
it's not an activist on social issues,
other than its primary mission of ed
ucation and research," he said. On
the other hand, he added, "it has to
attend to its own social responsibility
as an investor ... that's very loudly
heard and deeply felt in Fortune 500
corporate boards."

Newman said STAND was not
asking for Stanford to push for more
intensive measures because the in
frastructure for tracing mineral sup
ply lines hasn't been fully developed
yet.

"We're not asking for anything
harsher, because there's not a capa
bility in the industry right now," she
said. "We're okay with small steps."

Members of the APIR-L will
present the resolution to a subcom
mittee of the board of trustees at the
board's meeting in June, where the
board will decide whether or not to
support the measure.
