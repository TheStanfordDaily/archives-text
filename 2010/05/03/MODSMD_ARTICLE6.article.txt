### ALEX YU 
Last Saturday, Stanford Women
in Business sponsored the confer
ence "I Don't Know to CEO: Trans
forming Passion into Action," bring
ing about 100 students to Annen
berg Auditorium.

Speakers and panelists included
representatives and leaders from
many companies, including Louis
Vuitton, Tesla and KAI Pharmaceu
ticals. They deliberated on a variety
of topics, ranging from technology in
business to marketing strategies.
Larry Chiang, the CEO of Duck 9
and author of "What They Don't
Teach You at Stanford Business
School," kicked off the conference
with his own vision for the event by
emphasizing, "I want this [confer
ence] to be on your path to becom
ing a CEO."

Anna Khan 'lO, a co-president of
SWIB, followed Chiang's remarks.
"The real meaning of CEO is the
brainchild of this conference," Khan
said. "Learn how all these speakers
zeroed in on a specific spark and
how they made it a bigger fire."
Ruth DeGolia, the keynote
speaker and CEO of Mercado Glob
al, described the dichotomy between
men and women in the business
world, exhorting women to take on
self-promoting stances in their own
lives.

"Men are more comfortable pro
moting themselves than [women]
are," DeGolia said. "I encourage all
of you to recognize that you are
worth supporting."

Conference participant Jennifer
Simons 'lO talked about the per
ceived advantage businessmen have
over businesswomen, suggesting
that women carry the burden of si
multaneously caring for their fami
lies while fostering their careers.

"It's assumed men will be more
successful," Simons said. "There's
the idea that women have to choose
between family and career."
From his experiences at the con
ference, Josh Chan 'll praised the
female speakers who have over
come the obstacles that DeGolia be
lieves businesswomen face.

"There are a lot of exceptions,"
Chan noted. "When you go to a con
ference like this, you see the females
who have broken that mold."
Luisa Russell 'l2 found the con
ference's emphasis on technology
helpful because of its relation to her
own studies in materials science and
engineering.
