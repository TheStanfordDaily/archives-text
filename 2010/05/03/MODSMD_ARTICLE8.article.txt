## Stanford reacts to Arizona immigration law MEChA members, professor voice opposition to new restrictions 
### MARIANNE LeVINE 
Some members of the Stanford community
are voicing protest against the Arizona immi
gration law, called the strictest in the United
States, signed April 23 by Governor Jan Brew
er.

On campus, the chat list of MEChA, a Chi
cano and Latino student organization, has been
active, with members promoting awareness of
the law, and sociology Prof. Tomas Jimenez
wrote an op-ed in Thursday's Los Angeles
Times in the wake of the law's passage on com
prehensive immigration reform.
Nationally, President Obama has criticized
the new law, saying it threatened "to undermine
basic notions of fairness that we cherish as

Americans, as well as the trust between police
and our communities that is so crucial to keep
ing us safe."
The law, known as S.B. 1070, requires immi
grants to carry legal documents and allows the
police to detain people suspected of being in
the United States illegally. The law is set to take
effect by August.
S.B. 1070 is causing significant backlash
around the country. Arizona is the first state to
require immigrants to present identification
papers to confirm their legal presence in the
United States if questioned by the police. Ac
cording to the law, failure to carry these papers
could lead to a misdemeanor charge.
"The forcing of people to identify them
selves begs the question, Are we truly free in
this nation?'" said Aracely Mondragon 'l3, the
co-chair of MEChA. Mondragon is also in
volved in the Stanford Immigration Rights Pro
ject.
Although Brewer said the public must trust

the Arizona law enforcement, critics of S.B.
1070 do not see how racial profiling can be
avoided.
"The Arizona law essentially says that if
someone looks like [they] might be here with
out authorization, then police are obligated to
ask for proof of legal residency ... the law is in
credibly vague," Jimenez wrote in an e-mail to
The Daily.
"Police are likely to rely on race and possibly
class cues, which are poor indicators of legal sta
tus and, more importantly, it amounts to racial
profiling," he added.
Jimenez said a belief that immigrants take
an undue share of public resources was partly
behind the law.
"There is a sense among many people that
immigrants are not only taking jobs, but also
sucking up resources that are funded with tax-
