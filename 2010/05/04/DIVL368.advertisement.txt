What is the moral significance of pressure?
How responsible are we for what we do when we must deliberate and act under duress or other
powerful social forces?
In the first lecture, "Responsibility and Duress", Rosen uses the example of the young Croatian soldier who was
tried for crimes against humanity for participating in the 1991 massacre of civilian prisoners to ask if duress is a
legal defense and if so, why?
In the second lecture, "Responsibility and Social Pressure", Rosen examines the Milgram experiments and
Zimbardo's Stanford Prison Experiment which make it clear that ordinary people can be led to do appalling things
by certain features of their circumstances. Why do we assume that they are less culpable and what does that
mean for the theory of moral responsibility?
Gideon Rosen (Ph.D. Princeton, 1992) is Stuart Professor of Philosophy and Chair of the Council of the Humanities at Princeton
