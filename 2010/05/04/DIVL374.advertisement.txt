How does the emphasis on consensus and civic friendship in contemporary political thought
relate to a nation drawn to the politics of division? Recent years have seen among political
theorists a major revival of interest in the republican tradition, especially the Roman ideas of
liberty, consensus, and civility. This lecture argues that the Romans' contribution to our
politics should be seen not in their abstract concepts but in their adversarial practices of civic
speech which make a compelling model for liberal education today.
