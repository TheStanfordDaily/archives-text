## Religious Studies History prof. combines love of teaching with research on faith in America 
### ERIC MESSINGEII SENIOR MANAGING EDITOR 
Stanford has its fair share of people who
go by "Professor," but for Jonathan Her
zog, it's more than just a title.

"My nickname growing up was 'The Profes
sor,'" said Herzog Ph.D. 'OB. "My classmates in el
ementary school called me that. It's sort of an in
sult, but I took it to be a compliment."
Herzog, a visiting assistant professor of histo
ry and a national fellow at the Hoover Institu
tion, has never strayed from his nickname. Schol
arship for Herzog has always meant teaching.
"I didn't know what it entailed to be a profes
sor," he said. "I assumed you basically just taught.
I didn't know about this giant research compo
nent a research component that at Stanford is
the name of the game."

A native of Omaha, Neb., Herzog's sense of
purpose and focus on teaching did not prove an
obstacle in adjusting to the demands of research
in fact, they've already set him off the beaten
path for studying American history.
Early in his doctoral study, Herzog led a sem
inar on sources and methods for history under
graduates, designed to give students practice in
making sense of primary documents. Addressing
his students about conservatism in California, he
presented them a pamphlet from the 1960s
called "Why a Christian can't be a communist."
Finding that his class "couldn't wrap their
head around" the underlying conceptions of the
pamphlet and their explicitly religious char
acterization of communism provided the first
clue to a change in American self-conceptions
that had been buried under decades of political
change.

"The top 100 responses to the question, 'what
is the opposite of communism?' you're going to
get things like capitalism, and freedom, and

democracy and stuff like this," Herzog said. "The
idea you would get religion today religion is
not going to be a top choice. You're going to get
one of those buzzing Xs if you answer that on
Family Feud. And students treated it this way."
Anxious to learn more about a religious un
derstanding of communism that appeared to
have been downplayed over time, Herzog un
covered more and more evidence that to write
about the Cold War without religion was to miss
the whole story.

"What I learned is that this was relatively un
explored," Herzog said. "That we all had this idea
that there were atheistic communists out there
and that we needed to do something about them,
but that nobody had really brought these pieces
together into a narrative of the early Cold War, a
narrative of the importance of religion to early
Cold War America."

That classroom discovery led him to hit the
archives, from which he emerged with a strong
argument that American leaders and politicians
reached much of their understanding of the Cold
War through a religious lens and felt a corre
sponding need to forcefully assert a religious
American identity. The end result is "The Ham
mer and the Cross," set for publication later this
fall by Oxford University Press.
Emeritus history Prof. David Kennedy '63,
Herzog's adviser when he was a graduate stu
dent at Stanford, said one crucial contribution of
Herzog's research has been to help tie together
religion, politics and foreign policy into a unified
analysis.

"Those subjects don't usually get called into
the same conversation together," Kennedy said.
"So it's the first mark of his creativity and origi
nality that he was even capable of concocting a
dissertation at that particular site."
Perhaps of equal value, however, is the way
that Herzog's contribution to rethinking Ameri
can history in the middle of the twentieth centu
ry has implications for the start of the twenty

first. Central to his analysis is the political mo
mentum produced by the reassertion of religion
for modern social conservatism and the debate it
propelled about American identity.
"It's really in the 19505, it's right after World
War 11, that these two movements, one political,
one religious, get a footing within American soci
ety. And I don't think it's an accident that they get
this crucial foothold at this exact time when
Americans are occupied with, first of all, the per
ils of communism, but more specifically occu
pied with the importance of embedding religious
conceptions into our notions of what it is what
it means to be an American."

Herzog's successful research into the shaping
of American identity, however, has not led him to
forget his own sense of himself as a teacher. After
completing his doctorate in 2008, he continued to
teach undergraduates in history while he served
for two years as fellow at the Hoover Institution,
which he said he was "lucky" to be able to do.
"I love to teach," Herzog said. "And, that's the
reason I got into this years ago. And it's the rea
son that basically still keeps me going. I love re
search, but I really, really love students. And I've
kept relationships with so many students over
the years that I still talk to."

Herzog has since brought to the classroom
the maturity of an accomplished scholar and the
enthusiasm and humility of someone only short
years removed from being a student.
"What was sort of amazing to me is, he was
just a couple of years older than me, but he
seemed a very strong presence," said Andrew
Robichaud, a doctoral student in history and a
teaching assistant for one of Herzog's courses.
"He had a natural ability to feel comfortable
in the classroom and make you feel comfortable
in the classroom," Robichaud added.
James Hohmann 'O9, a former student of Her
zog's and a former Daily editor, also noted the
young professor's attention to the members of
his classes.

"His reaction to your reaction paper would
be longer than your reaction," he said. "He's one
of those guys who wants everyone in that class
room to grow and learn."
And Herzog includes himself in that. He has
not wavered from the belief that finding the an
swers about identity, and what you can con
tribute, starts with questions and that those
are best found in the conversation of the class
room.
"Teaching students is probably the best way
to find out A, what interests people, and B, to find
out where the information isn't, because that's
really the name of research," he said.
Two years after earning his doctorate, Herzog
has made a name for himself on the campus as a
kind and empathetic teacher. After seven years
in total on the Farm, he will now take his sense of
scholarship rooted in teaching north to the Uni
versity of Oregon, where he will take up a posi
tion this summer in its history department.
After his two "lucky" years teaching, Herzog
understands that it's time to move on from the
Farm.
"Many of the friends that I have made here
over time have sort of scattered to the four winds
and moved all over the academic world," he said.
"It's going to be sad to leave," he added.
