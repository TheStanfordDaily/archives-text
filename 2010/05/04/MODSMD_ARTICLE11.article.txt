Relay, a 200-mile relay that happened last weekend. They finished in 7th
with a time of 24:30:28, beating the Facebook team after being taunted overnight. After three legs totaling around 18 miles, runners were ex
hausted but rewarded with scenes ranging from Napa vineyards to redwood
forests to the Pacific Ocean. "It's the dumbest thing I've ever done,
and the most exhilarating," said Devin Lee '10, another team member.
