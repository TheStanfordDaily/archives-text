# STUDENT LIFE
## Schools endorse energy 
### AN LE NGUYEN DESK EDITOR 
U.S. Senator Byron Dorgan (D-
N.D.) and Representative Pete Vis
closky (D-Ind.) last week received a
call to action on energy issues from
107 student body presidents of
American colleges and universities.
The presidents, in a move spear
headed by former ASSU President
David Gobaud, a coterminal student
in computer science, signed a letter
endorsing the Department of Ener
gy's "REgaining our ENERGY Sci
ence and Engineering Edge" (RE
ENERGYSE) proposal.
The letter urged Congress to sup
port the "proposal and fully meet the
FY2OII budget request for $55 mil
lion."
Junior Teryn Norris, director of
Americans for Energy Leadership,
has long been involved with the mo
bilization effort behind the proposal.
He collaborated with Gobaud on the
cross-campus letter and is taking the
quarter off to lead advocacy efforts
in Washington D.C.
Norris is a former Daily colum
nist.
"RE-ENERGYSE would be the
first federal program to focus specif
ically on developing clean energy sci
ence and engineering programs in a
comprehensive manner at the Uni
versity level, community and techni
cal college level, as well as K through
12 schools," Norris said.
Over the years, a number of feder
al programs have striven to develop
the so-called "green collar" work

force, focusing on the retrofitting of
buildings and the installation of solar
panels.

"But there hasn't been a federal
program that is really focused on the
more advanced, high-tech science
and energy jobs that will lead the in
novation front in clean energy," Nor
ris said.

Proponents of the proposal argue
that the United States is at a critical
stage of energy innovation. They
claim that clean energy competitive
ness has parallels with the space race
that ensued after the Soviet Union
launched Sputnik in 1957.
"Right now, the United States is in
a global race to develop competitive
clean industries," Norris said. "Coun
tries like China are investing massive
amounts to develop [and] dominate
the clean energy industry and grow
their market share."
"It's critical for the United States
to make sure that we're at the lead
ing front of this industry and that in
cludes a serious federal investment
and advanced energy workforce de
velopment," he added.
Gobaud similarly wanted "to see
America become the leader in clean
energy technology" and reduce its
dependence on nonrenewable ener
gy sources.

"This is something that students
across the country, as has been shown
by this letter, support and this is
something that we hope Congress
will pass this time in the budget,"
Gobaud said.

Theo Gibbs 'll, co-president of
Students for a Sustainable Stanford,

added to the chorus of support for
RE-ENERGYSE.

"I think it is an important and ex
citing initiative that links students to
policy," Gibbs said.
The proposal is a "national pro
gram with a lot of momentum" to
change the way people think about
"where climate change is going to
move," she added.
Gibbs said the proposal comes at
a crucial junction for California's en
ergy policy, amid calls for the repeal
of climate law A.B. 32. She said the
proposal has the potential to stimu
late both economic growth and sus
tainable energy development.
RE-ENERGYSE was included in
Obama administration's budget re
quest for FY2OIO, but was rejected
by Congress during the mark-up
process. It was reintroduced in the
FY2OII budget and is set to go under
review by the Appropriations Sub
committees on Energy and Water
Development in the Flouse and Sen
ate, chaired by Visclosky and Dor
gan, respectively.
