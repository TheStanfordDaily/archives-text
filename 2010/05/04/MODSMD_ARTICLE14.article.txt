## OP-ED We Choose to Invest 
### YISHAI KABAKER '10 Stanford Israel Alliance 
When I was a freshman at Stanford in
2006-2007, divestment launched on
campus in relation to the
Israeli/Palestinian conflict. At the time, it was
sudden, it was divisive, and it was damaging.
Although the bill was defeated in the ASSU
Senate, the ramifications continued for years,
dominating much of my Stanford experience.
Tensions were high on campus as many peo
ple felt alienated and disillusioned by the
process. Interfaith dialogue was deeply shak
en as religious communities found them
selves on opposite sides of a destructive de
bate.

Recently, a similar bill was proposed in
the UC Berkeley Student Senate. Following
that, one was also submitted to the UC San
Diego Student Senate. From accounts that I
have heard from friends at Berkeley, the ex
perience was equally traumatic. Although
the bill at Berkeley was also defeated, the rip
ples it has caused for their community will be
long lasting. To my dismay, there once again
seems to be the beginnings of an
Israeli/Palestinian divestment campaign
here at Stanford.

One powerful line from the hours-long
debate at Berkeley came from the Cal
Chabad Rabbi. He made the point that you
cannot fight darkness with darkness; you
must fight darkness with light. A negative
campaign against alleged abuses will only
bring more negativity and damage. And, it
will not address the issues or solve the prob
lems it will only cause further polarization
and make peace even more elusive. In my ex
perience with divestment when applied to
this conflict, damage is wrought, but nothing
positive comes of it. In the past, divestment
campaigns helped combat apartheid in South

Africa and genocide in Darfur. However, the
divestment campaign against Israel is a crass
bludgeon, which reduces an incredibly com
plex situation to euphemisms and demoniza
tions.

Therefore, the Stanford Israel Alliance
chooses to invest, and we hope you will join
us. We agree that the Israeli-Palestinian con
flict is deep, complex, and painful. We sup
port the Palestinian people in their desire for
an independent state alongside the State of
Israel. To that end, we wish to help the Pales
tinian people build up their infrastructure
and economy, which will be the basis for a fu
ture state.

In the coming weeks, Stanford Israel Al
liance will be raising awareness and support
for two NGOs that are working to improve
Palestinian and Israeli society. Lendfor
peace.org is a microfinance organization
based in the Palestinian Territories, inspiring
entrepreneurship among Palestinians. The
Peres Institute for Peace is an Israeli organi
zation that builds connections between Is
raeli and Palestinian businessmen, environ
mentalists, and civil leaders to forge common
frameworks between the two peoples.
Our goal is to move past the venomous
rhetoric that divestment inspires and attempt
to tackle the Israeli/Palestinian conflict from
a positive perspective. It is our responsibility
as Stanford students to help foster a more nu
anced understanding of the issues, and to
deal with the legitimate grievances that exist.
Stanford is a place of innovation and
change. Perhaps this is one area where we
can live up to our reputation.
