# BROADLY SPEAKING
## A 						Breath of Fresh Air

uT felt like you were my breath of fresh
I air."
That's not a compliment you get everyday.
I sat on my bed, tears streaming down my
face, staring at the friend who has not only
played a huge role in helping me to define
who I am, but what I believe. Funny thing is,
we only met seven months ago. When I met
her I didn't need her and she didn't need me
we both already had our (according to
Cosmo) "perfect number" of 5-8 best friends.
When we met, we were both content in our
own comfortable yet separate social circles.
Funnier thing is, seven months later I
don't know how I ever lived without her.

A few weeks ago, the incoming Class Pres
idents had a meeting with Leslie Winick, the
Director of Alumni & Student Class Out
reach at the Alumni Association. As Leslie
described some of her past experience sur
veying alums, one point she made really
struck a chord: "No matter how old they are,
whether they were in the Class of 1955 or the
Class of '93, the number one regret alumni
have about their time at Stanford is that they
wished they had known more people outside
of their social circle."

At the beginning, our class and our social
circle were almost synonymous. Our class
community was solidified at NSO the first
second Dean Julie yelled "OH'LEVEN!"
and every single member of the Class of 2011
responded. It was a call to action, our verbal
affirmation that cemented our membership
into the Class of 2011 for the rest of our lives,
starting at that moment and continuing past
our 65-year reunion.

But almost the nano-second after we
signed that verbal affirmation with Dean
Julie, the Darwinian ladder-climbers in all of
us were struggling to define ourselves within
a smaller subset of our class of superstars.
Our second community was as fundamental
ly basic as our geographical location: Fresh
man Dorms. The second we finished scream
ing "OH-LEVEN" our vocal chords were al
ready contracting for the next phase, scream
ing "J-RO!" even louder.The freshman dorm
was the first opportunity we had to define
ourselves within a smaller community, thus
making ourselves more distinctive in an audi
torium full of valedictorians.

But then NSO ended (thank God), real
life started, and before you knew it you were
no longer living in your freshman dorm. You
then began to define yourself by more specif
ic and thus more descriptive variables this
could have been a major, favorite branch of

the ASSU or sorority stereotype. At first
glance, membership in a community that
more accurately expresses your individual
interests is one of the greatest ways to ex
press your individuality. But almost counter
intuitively, the second you started to identify
yourself within this smaller community
based on variables more specific than geo
graphical location or class year alone, a part
of your individual identity was lost to the
larger group identity. As each year pro
gressed, these more specific communities
and social groups became more and more so
lidified, making it harder and harder for new
people to break in.

But these solidified communities also
make it even harder to break out.

Perhaps the funniest thing about my new
found friendship seven months ago is that
neither of us knew we wanted to break out
until Stanford forced our communities to
gether (the luck of the Draw placed us in the
same homestay in Spain). It's funny how
those things happen. Just like the freshman
dorm, it was once again a determinate of our
geographical location that forced us to break
out of our solidified communities and into
someone else's heart.

Your class is your very first community, as
well as your very last. As much as class unity
steadily decreases year after year, class unity
arguably increases in importance year after
year. When you sit through graduation, how
many faces are you going to actually know?
How many faces do you want to know?
That's a question only you can answer. But as
much as you think you may have already
found the best friends and the best communi
ty in the world, it is never too late to find that
new individual who actually makes you a bet
ter person.

In my case seven months ago, my breath
of fresh air was Stephanie Caro.
