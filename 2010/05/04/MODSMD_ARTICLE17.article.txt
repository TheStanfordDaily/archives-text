# JUST A THOUGHT
## Correctness can be incorrect 
### Nikola Milanovic 
If you pay attention to the thrilling world
of on-campus controversies, chances are
you have heard of the homophobic frater
nity e-mail scandal that has caught the atten
tion of so many different groups recently. If
you are a devoted Just a Thought groupie,
you may remember that I briefly touched on
it in my column a couple weeks ago. In light
of the continuing coverage and disputes re
volving around this incident, another point
needs to be made.

Political correctness is a campaign, not a
crusade. Many people don't seem to realize
that. For those ignorant of how this flash-in
the-pan controversy arose, I'll give quick
background: a fraternity member e-mailed
his house list asking people to stop using ho
mophobic slurs. Another member responded
implying that the request was a joke. There
was no violent hate crime, there was no tar
geting, there was no consensus of bigotry.

The miniscule nature of the initial offense
does not excuse it or make it more palatable.
After all, it represents the tip of an iceberg of
homophobia and politically incorrect lan
guage that pervades social life on and off
campus. But the innocuousness of the initial
e-mail does put the response into perspective.

Let's outline a few of the facts here: the
student who sent the offending e-mail is not
the face of homophobia in the Stanford com
munity, even though groups have been trying
to paint him as such. His e-mail is not the
paragon of intolerance. The Stanford com
munity at large and fraternities specifically
do not harbor and encourage bigots, racists,
hatemongers, politically backwards cavemen
or homophobes. Yet the outrage would make
a bystander believe otherwise.
On the Diaspora e-mail list, a member as
serted that this e-mail was "proof that hate
crimes still happen on this campus." It is true
acts of intolerance do happen even at
Stanford, the politically progressive arche
type of all universities anywhere (ever). It is
still sensationalist to use this e-mail as a testi
mony to the pervasiveness of'hate crimes' on
campus. Such language conjures up images of
rowdy meatheads taking baseball bats to the
unfortunate homosexual holding hands with
his or her life partner. It's not inaccurate to

call this incident a hate crime, but let's be
honest with ourselves: this is not a Matthew
Shepard situation.
Again, let me state that the scope of this
event does not excuse it. Homophobia is un
acceptable in whatever form it takes. Howev
er, the sentiments of the people who re
sponded, though well founded, were misdi
rected. A member of the QNet mailing list
noted that such backlash is a good way to
achieve progress on the issue, concluding
that "frats will respond to embarrassment."
An article on the matter in the Stanford Re
view cited the fraternity, its president and the
offending member by name. The author then
proceeded to include photos of both the frat

and the e-mail criminal. The article then went
on to discuss the political ambitions of the e
mailer's parents, citing them and their cam
paigns by name and asserting that this e-mail
could create negative backlash in Florida
elections.

To reiterate: the motive of the response is
justified. The content of the response is not.
Why stop at photos of the offender and the
names of his parents? Why not flood his
inbox with angry e-mails? Where are the can
dlelight vigils and the prayer circles express
ing a communal wish that he and all those
like him at Stanford be publicly expelled?

The truth is that this incident is neither the
first nor the last of its kind at Stanford. There
will always be people who make offensive or
potentially offensive comments, whether in
jest or in seriousness, whether innocuous or
malicious. The appropriate response is not to
over-sensationalize the event and publicize
the person(s) responsible. This is about the
offense, not the offender. And moreover, this
is about the mindset and undercurrent that
the offense represents it is not an isolated
act of intolerance floating in a vacuum of cor
rectness and acceptance. This e-mail is a tem
porary touchstone that represents a much
more serious underlying presence of homo
phobia on campus.
The reason this point has not been made
publicly is because nobody wants to look like
they are admonishing the people combating
intolerance. In saying this, it's likely that peo
ple will conclude (publicly or privately) that I
too am an intolerant bigot, the same way that
anybody can be smeared by a label if they
criticize the crusade of political correctness.
Witch hunts will not achieve progress.
They will not create lasting social change or
draw meaningful discussion to an issue that
needs it. All that sensationalism achieves is
polarization and groupthink backlash. No
tice how there are no names in this column.
Let's move past the targeting and blame to a
progressive discussion of how to address the
issue. Thank you.
