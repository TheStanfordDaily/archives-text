## New NCAA proposal is worrisome 
### Kabir Sawhney 
Last week, the NCAA Board
of Directors announced
that the NCAA Men's Bas
ketball Tournament field
would expand to 68 teams
from the current 65 for next March's
tournament, pending the approval of
the body's men's basketball commit
tee.
While the airwaves and Internet
sports blogs were abuzz with talk of the
expansion and its repercussions, an
other announcement from the Board
was buried in the media whirlwind
a recommendation to require football
players to complete nine units during
the fall semester (i.e. during the sea
son) in order to remain eligible for the
next season.
At first glance, this may seem like a
sensible proposal. As the NCAA and
its two big sports, football and men's
basketball, have become more and
more like big-money enterprises, the
idea of the "student-athlete" has fallen
by the wayside to a significant degree.
Requiring a certain amount of course
work from players can only be a good
thing, right?
That's actually wrong, as it turns
out. No matter which way you look at
it, a nine-unit requirement simply can't
say anything good about the NCAA.
Let's start with the fact that most
colleges have minimum per-semester
(or per-quarter) unit requirements
that are already higher than the pro
posed NCAA floor. As some of you
may know, Stanford students must
take at least 12 units per quarter to re
main enrolled full-time varsity ath
letic teams, including the football team
during fall quarter, are not exempt
from this requirement.
Other schools maintain similar
minimum per-semester credit require
ments. Cal requires 12 or 13 units per
quarter based on major and Notre
Dame requires 12 per semester. Even
Nebraska requires 12 units most
colleges have a floor of around 12 units
in place.
This fact makes the NCAA recom
mendation for nine credits extremely
puzzling, and all possible explanations
look pretty bad (at least in my opinion)
for the organization.
The first potential rationale is fairly
straightforward: with its academic
credibility in tatters, the NCAA needs
some way to make it seem like it still
cares about whether or not its athletes
actually learn anything while in col
lege.
A requirement that does exactly
nothing to change the status quo ac
complishes this purpose quite well.
When confronted with allegations that
it doesn't care about academics for
football players, the organization can
point to this requirement as evidence
that it is trying to promote learning as
much as possible. However, when the
proposal doesn't actually do anything,
it turns into a pure public relations
stunt that can enhance the NCAA's
reputation without meeting any resist
ance from its member schools.
While this motivation is pretty bad,
the other two explanations I can think
of are even more sinister.
The NCAA could be instituting this
requirement as away to impose out
side controls on powerful athletic de
partments that have found ways to cir
cumvent the minimum-unit require
ments of their respective universities.
At some schools, the athletic depart
ment is often one of the more influen
tial players in determining policy, and it
can use this clout to ensure that foot
ball players and other varsity athletes
are exempt from requirements to take
a certain number of units.
It is easy to see why such a policy
would be in the interest of football
programs. Their players are usually on
scholarship, which means that taking
one class in a semester doesn't result
in wasted tuition money for the player;
less time taking classes means more
time to focus on football and ensures a
better chance of success in those class
es; and programs are not required to
graduate their athletes, so taking
fewer units isn't a problem since play
ers don't plan to graduate in four years
anyway.
To its credit, such a situation would
lend merit to the NCAA's implemen
tation of a nine-unit minimum. How
ever, the existence of a systemic cir
cumvention of minimum academic re
quirements at a number of institutions

is very worrying (though, thankfully,
Stanford's programs don't engage in
any such chicanery).
The last possible explanation is, to
me, by far the worst one: the NCAA is
subtly signaling to schools that its ex
pectations for football players now
stand at very low levels.
If the NCAA only asks for nine
units, athletic departments could use
that as a weapon to get reduced units
for their players. As said already, hav
ing athletes go to class less benefits
the program in a myriad of ways with
out really hurting it at all. In this sce
nario, both schools and the NCAA
are colluding to reduce academic par
ticipation. While I'll admit that this
scenario is unlikely at best, it must be
considered given the lack of trans
parency with which the NCAA's
Board of Directors has made this rec
ommendation.

Though I'm sure some people will
disagree with me, my main contention
with this recommendation is that I see
no way in which it is academically
beneficial. Putting a minimum under
already existing ones is at best a com
pletely useless provision; at worst, it
can undercut the very system it seems
designed to enhance.
