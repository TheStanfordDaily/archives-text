# L.A. LETDOWN

The Cardinal women's water polo team had
a busy weekend in Los Angeles, resulting in a
disappointing third-place finish for Stanford.
"We were excited to play in UCLA's new
pool for our MPSF Tournament this year," said
senior driver Kelly Eaton. "We had played
UCLA just a couple weeks prior in that pool
and beat them handily, so I would say we
weren't nervous to play them again."
"Having all of the teams together for the
first time since the Irvine Tournament early in
our season was different to say the least," said
senior driver Kelsey Holshouser. "Going in to
the tournament everyone knows that only four
teams from our conference have a chance of
making it in to the NCAA Tournament, so it is
really 'do or die' for everyone when we get to
this point in the season. I think having everyone
there was exciting.

"It was good practice for the NCAA Tour
nament. In both tournaments, we have one
game a day. You have to win each game in order
to advance and there are a ton of distractions,"
Holshouser continued. "This weekend was also
the first time we haven't played at home in a
while, so we got to practice being in a new envi
ronment."

Stanford began the weekend with a match
against No. 8 Arizona State. The first period
ended with a tie at 2-2, but during the second
period the Cardinal took charge, scoring three

points while holding ASU scoreless.
The match ended with a 10-5 Cardinal victo
ry.
Freshman two-meter Annika Dries and
sophomore two-meter Melissa Seidemann
each scored two points during the game. Fresh
man driver Vee Dunlevie, Eaton, freshman
driver Jillian Garton, sophomore driver Alyssa
Lo, sophomore driver Pallavi Menon and sen
ior two-meter Jessica Steffens each skipped in a
single goal as well. Freshman goalkeeper Kate
Baldoni saved a total of nine shots.
The team played strongly as a whole to ad
vance to the next day of the tournament.
On Saturday, the Cardinal faced off against
No. 5 UCLA. Stanford had a strong start, as it
lead 3-2 by the end of the first period. Each
team scored a single point during the second
period, yet during the third period the Bruins
outscored the Cardinal 3-1.
The last period only saw a single point
scored by each team, leaving UCLA with a nar
row 7-6 victory.
"In our game versus UCLA, we could have
done many things better, including scoring
more of our six-on-five-person advantage situ
ations," Eaton said. "We had a lot of opportuni
ties to score, but the ball just couldn't find the
back of the net, and we missed all our chances
to resume the lead again, which was crucial. We
allowed UCLA to beat us even though we have
beaten them every other time we played them
this year. I'm sure we won't let that happen
again now that we have such a bitter taste in our

mouth after that embarrassing loss this week
end."
Seidemann had two goals. Holshouser, sen
ior two-meter Alex Koran, Menon and Steffens
each smashed in a single goal. Junior goalkeep
er Amber Oland saved a total of nine shots.
"I think all of the credit has to go to UCLA
for that game and the great weekend that they
had," Holshouser said. "We didn't come out
ready to attack and we paid for that. We were
outplayed in the first two games of the tourna
ment. It wasn't that we didn't have chances to
put the pressure on them and extend the lead
we had in the third quarter. We even had
chances in the final quarter to tie the game, but
we just couldn't convert."
The upset resulted in the Cardinal playing
on Sunday against California in a fight for third
place.
The Cardinal came out stronger than ever as
it demolished the Golden Bears Cal was not
able to score a single point during the first quar
ter while Stanford scored three. During the next
three periods, Cal only managed a single point
during each quarter while the Cardinal racked
up an impressive total of seven points overall.
Stanford was victorious with a score of 10-3.
"On Sunday we played our rivals, Cal, for
the bronze, and we beat them handily, proving
that we were a much better team than a third
place game," Eaton said.
Eaton and Seidemann each scored three
goals. Dries smashed in two goals. Sophomore
driver Cassie Churnside and junior driver Kim

Krueger each skipped in a single goal. Oland
saved a total of three shots while Baldoni saved
two of her own.
The Cardinal finished third in the MPSF
Tournament.
"I think [the weekend overall] was a little
disappointing," Holshouser said. "We certainly
were not expecting to be in the third place
game, but that is the position we put ourselves
in and I think we came out and played a solid
game. It wasn't a great game, but it got the job
done and it looked a lot better than our per
formance on Saturday.
"This weekend was great for us in terms of
learning how to play on the road again. When
we play at home we have a lot of support for
other students, friends, family and the commu

GAME NOTES I The No. 1 Stanford women's water polo team
finished its MPSF season by beating Cal in the third place
game of the conference tournament. A day after being
upset by UCLA, the Cardinal came out strong against the
Golden Bears and never let up, winning by a final score of
10-3. Next, No. 1 seeded Stanford will look to advance
closer to its second NCAA title when it begins NCAA tour
nament play against No. 8 seed Pomona-Pitzer.

nity in general. We had crowds of
1,000 and 1,500 for the Cal and USC
game, respectively, that really got us
excited for those games. From now
on, we are going to have to find that
spark of energy within ourselves and
get ourselves ready to play."
"We have nine practices until the
NCAA Tournament begins and we
need to get better each day," Hol
shouser observed. "We need to work
on all phases of our game and clean
up the problems that we saw this
weekend. Even in our last game
against Cal we can find a number of
different things we can do better."
In about two weeks, the Cardinal
will be heading back to Southern Cal
ifornia as it goes to San Diego to com
pete in the National Collegiate
Championship.
"After this wake-up call, there is
no way we are going to be complacent
in the NCAA Championships,"
Eaton said. "We are sick of UCLA
winning and we are going to take
them off their NCAA pedestal. USC,
UCLA, Cal we are not going to
show any mercy to those teams in the
NCAA Championship tournament.
We are there to win three games
whether or not they're pretty."

"I think as we move forward it is
going to be about taking one step at a
time," Elolshouser said. "Focus on
what we can fix over the next couple

of weeks, then concentrate on out
first opponent of the tournament and
move on from there. We need to fin
ish each game before we start think
ing about the next one. I really think
that any of the top four teams in the
tournament have a good chance at
winning the title. We are going to have
to prepare and focus for each of them
as we plan for the tournament."
Yesterday, the bracket was an
nounced and Stanford, despite its
semifinal loss to U CLA, was given the
No. 1 seed for the NCAA Tourna
ment. The Cardinal's first opponent in
the eight-team tournament will be
No. 8 seed Pomona-Pitzer at 4 p.m. on
May 14.
