## Cancer treatment approved 
### JULIA BROWNELL SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Food and Drug Administra
tion (FDA) on Thursday approved
Provenge, a new treatment for
prostate cancer that was originally de
veloped by Stanford researchers in
the 19905.

"This is extraordinarily impor
tant," said Edgar Engleman, who first
devised the immune cell therapy.
"This is the first time that an im
munotherapeutic approach has been
[moved forward]." Engleman is a pro
fessor of pathology and medicine at
the Stanford School of Medicine.

The FDA denied approval for the
approach in 2007 and requested more
data from Dendreon, the biotechnol
ogy company that produces
Provenge. After a third clinical trial,
the FDA finally gave Provenge the
go-ahead.

"The firm then filed an amend
ment to its [application] to include the
new data and the FDA has now com
pleted review of that submission,"
said the FDA's Jill Burkoff, "and
based on FDA's review, we've deter
mined that the product is safe and ef
fective." Burkoff is a consumer safety
officer at the FDA's Center for Bio
logics.

Provenge uses the body's immune
cells to recognize and fight cancer,
which cells usually do not recognize as
a foreign threat. The therapy is not
preventative like traditional measles
or tetanus vaccines; rather, it targets
existing advanced-stage cancers.
The therapy involves isolating the
dendritic cells, a type of immune cell,
from each individual cancer patient
and bringing them to a lab. In the lab,
the cells are introduced to cancer
components and manipulated to rec
ognize them as non-self. When rein
troduced to the patient, they then tar
get and fight the cancer.
"In a sense we are kind of fooling
the dendritic cells into thinking the
cancer is foreign," Engleman said.
Because the immune cell therapy
is genetically the same as the patient's
own cells, they are nontoxic and have
few side effects. Chemotherapy and
other cancer treatments are extreme
ly toxic and end up killing other cells
in the patient, often causing debilitat
ing side effects.
According to Engleman, "the den
dritic cells" approach to cancer thera
py is appealing because it "appears to
be very, very safe."
Now, after years of waiting, Den
dreon is ready to turn the drug into a
clinical reality.
