## Cancer treatment approved 
### JULIA BROWNELL SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Food and Drug Administra
tion (FDA) on Thursday approved
Provenge, a new treatment for
prostate cancer that was originally de
veloped by Stanford researchers in
the 19905.

"This is extraordinarily impor
tant," said Edgar Engleman, who first
devised the immune cell therapy.
"This is the first time that an im
munotherapeutic approach has been
[moved forward]." Engleman is a pro
fessor of pathology and medicine at
the Stanford School of Medicine.

The FDA denied approval for the
approach in 2007 and requested more
data from Dendreon, the biotechnol
ogy company that produces
Provenge. After a third clinical trial,
the FDA finally gave Provenge the
go-ahead.

"The firm then filed an amend
ment to its [application] to include the
new data and the FDA has now com
pleted review of that submission,"
said the FDA's Jill Burkoff, "and
based on FDA's review, we've deter
mined that the product is safe and ef
fective." Burkoff is a consumer safety
officer at the FDA's Center for Bio
logics.

Provenge uses the body's immune
cells to recognize and fight cancer,
which cells usually do not recognize as
a foreign threat. The therapy is not
preventative like traditional measles
or tetanus vaccines; rather, it targets
existing advanced-stage cancers.
The therapy involves isolating the
dendritic cells, a type of immune cell,
from each individual cancer patient
and bringing them to a lab. In the lab,
the cells are introduced to cancer
components and manipulated to rec
ognize them as non-self. When rein
troduced to the patient, they then tar
get and fight the cancer.
"In a sense we are kind of fooling
the dendritic cells into thinking the
cancer is foreign," Engleman said.
Because the immune cell therapy
is genetically the same as the patient's
own cells, they are nontoxic and have
few side effects. Chemotherapy and
other cancer treatments are extreme
ly toxic and end up killing other cells
in the patient, often causing debilitat
ing side effects.
According to Engleman, "the den
dritic cells" approach to cancer thera
py is appealing because it "appears to
be very, very safe."
Now, after years of waiting, Den
dreon is ready to turn the drug into a
clinical reality.
"The approval of Provenge is a
significant step towards realizing our
mission of transforming the lives of
patients with cancer, and it also
marks Dendreon's transformation
into a commercial enterprise, ready
to support the successful launch of
the first personalized treatment for
cancer," said Mitchell H. Gold, the
CEO of Dendreon, in a press release.
Engleman and his colleague
Samuel Strober, professor of medi

cine, formed Dendreon in 1992 to
bring their cell therapy through the
clinical trials process and market it
for therapeutic purposes. The firm
began clinical trials in 1998.
When Dendreon applied to the
FDA for approval in 2007, the expert
advisory panel recommended that
the FDA approve it. The FDA, how
ever, wanted to pursue further re
search.

"The agency determined that
there were deficiencies in the appli
cation that precluded approval,"
Burkoff said.

Dendreon said it will offer 2,000
patients a supply of the therapy for
2010-2011. Provenge will be provid-

Ed through 50 centers that originally
participated in the clinical trials.

Dendreon is estimated to have spent
approximately $1 billion developing
the drug. The therapy will cost ap
proximately $93,000.
"It is, by definition, a very expen
sive process," Engleman said. "In this
case, you basically have to manufac
ture your treatment for each patient
every time. I think this will be a fac
tor that limits accessibility."
Dendreon and many other compa
nies are currently employing the tech
nique to treat other types of cancer.
