# Stanford is a sports lover's dream
## 
### Jacob Jaffe Fields of Failure 
People often tell me I'm too
negative and that all I do is
complain. So just for you,
I'm writing a happy col
umn, and it's not just be
cause I'm such a warm, cheerful, posi
tive, optimistic person that would
never complain about anything.
I'm happy because I go to the best
school for a sports lover, and this week
end was just the latest example that il
lustrated that point to its fullest.
Many columns, including one or
two by yours truly, can spout the joys of
Stanford's success at winning Direc
tors' Cups, but that's a story for anoth
er day. Instead, I'm just happy to go to
a school with so many opportunities to
watch world-class athletes of all kinds.
This Saturday, I got to watch a few
races at the Payton Jordan Invitation
al, which is a pretty awesome track
meet for those of you who haven't
worn your Cardinal red since football
season.
Of course, I'm very spoiled to be
friends with some great runners, so I
had extra incentive to go, but the meet
provided a lot more than just a chance
to see my friends run.
See, what many of us probably take
for granted is just how many major
events we can see right here on cam

pus. People talk all day long about Bill
Gates or Afroman coming to Stan
ford, but there are some amazing
sporting events and athletes on our
campus at least as often.
Take this track meet, for instance.
After watching my friend Dylan Ferris
fly past his competitors to take the
1500 meters and taking a short break
for volleyball (which I'll get to later), I
came back to watch people I'd never
seen before that don't even go to Stan
ford. Why? Because they're some of
the best athletes in the world, and they
chose to come here.

And I was rewarded in a big way.
The big event of the day was the men's
10,000 meters, which included a
stacked field filled with professionals.
The headliner was Galen Rupp, who
had dominated college track as a stu
dent at Oregon before graduating to
professional running. Rupp was at
tempting to break the American
record in the 10k, and the whole audi
ence knew it. Posters of Rupp were
passed around the stands and the
cheers were overwhelmingly in his
favor, even before the race started.
Being somewhat of a track novice
(or nOOb for those of you reading the
online version), my only real knowl
edge of the field came from my runner

friends: Dylan, Chris Derrick and Ben
jamin Johnson. I remembered Rupp
from his college days, but being a Stan
ford student, I'd always rooted against
him, so it was hard to imagine rooting
for him, even though everyone loves to
see records broken. A few other com
petitors were somewhat familiar, but
eveiyone's attention was squarely on
Rupp from the start.
Apart from the pace-setters, Rupp
led for just about the entire race. For
over 9,000 meters, he looked to be in
perfect position to break the record,
leading from the get-go and staying
under American-record pace (about
27:13). It was somewhat intriguing that
he did not have much separation,
though, as three other runners, includ
ing collegian Samuel Chelanga of Lib
erty, stayed within striking distance. I
knew about Chelanga because he still
competes (and does quite well) against
Stanford runners and is somehow still
in college. Chelanga was attempting to
break his own collegiate record in the
event as well, so all eyes were on Rupp
first and him second.

Then, with just over two laps to go,
the runner in fourth, Chris Solinsky,
started to make a move into second. A
more experienced spectator probably
would have sensed something, but I

just thought he was aiming for second,
plus I honestly knew nothing about
Solinsky other than what the announc
er was saying. All of a sudden, though,
the crowd could not ignore Solinsky, as
he not only passed Rupp, but left him
in the dust.

Again, I'm no track expert, but
watching Solinsky run a 1:56 over the
final 800 meters actually gave me
goosebumps. And for the 99.9 percent
of you who didn't say "woah, 1:56!" let
me put that in perspective. Solinsky
had just run over 5.7 miles at an under
-4:30 mile pace. He then ran the final
half-mile at about a 3:53 mile pace. It
was absolutely insane to see someone
(who I found out later had never com
peted in the 10k before) fly past some
of the fastest runners in the world.
Not surprisingly, Solinsky set the
American record. What was surprising
was that he broke it by 14 seconds. He
ran the fastest time ever for a non-
African, and it was right here on Stan
ford campus. Oh, and the record he
broke? Also set at this same meet, nine
years ago. Meanwhile, Chelanga broke
his own collegiate record by about 20
seconds, and Rupp finished a measly
fourth. And still beat the previous
American record.
Needless to say, watching someone

obliterate an American record was a
unique opportunity, and that's just the
kind of thing we get to see as Stanford
students.
That same night, I had the pleasure
of watching Stanford men's volleyball
win the MPSFTournament and secure
the No. 1 seed for this weekend's
NCAA Tournament. Last week, I de
scribed how fun volleyball matches
are, so I will spare you all another in
depth play-by-play of Saturday's vol
leyball match.
Instead, I'd just like to point out
again how lucky we are to have these
viewing opportunities. As the top seed
in the MPSF, Stanford got to host the
MPSF Tournament, and, this year,
Maples Pavilion has the privilege of
hosting the four-team NCAA Tourna
ment.
I say all this primarily because I
enjoy sports, but I also want to get the
attention of all sports fans in the area.
