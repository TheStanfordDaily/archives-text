### â€”Chris Juhnke 
The Stanford women's rugby club
team finished its season Saturday
night with a loss to Penn State, who

earned its second consecutive title.
After beating Brown 43-32 on Friday
in the semifinal match at Stanford's
Steuber Rugby Stadium, the team
faced the Lady Ruggers for the cham
pionship. It was the sixth consecutive
time these two teams have faced each
other in the national championship
and, with its win, Penn State evened
the series at three titles apiece.

Against Brown, the Cardinal
trailed 27-24 but was able to pull out
the win by converting on late tries.
Stanford got two tries each from sen
ior wing Jess Watkins and sopho
more center Melanie Nacouzi, who
scored late in the game to pad Stan
ford's lead.

In the championship game, the
Penn State defense shut down the

Cardinal offense, which was score
less until sophomore flanker Frances
Wehrwein scored late in the game off
a breakaway run by Watkins. Junior
wing Deven Owsiany was the star for
Penn State, scoring two tries in the
24-7 win and earning Player of the
Match honors.
