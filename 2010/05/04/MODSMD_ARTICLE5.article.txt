# ASSU Senate to vote on transition today
## Reps set to discuss swearing-in of senator-elects 
### ELLEN HUET DESK EDITOR 
The ASSU Undergraduate Senate is set to vote
today on whether or not to dissolve the current Senate
on May 11 and swear in the senators-elect, a move that
usually happens in the fifth week of the quarter. The de
cision could be postponed another week in today's
meeting.

According to Senate Parliamentarian Alex Katz 'l2,
the current Senate has delayed dissolving because of a
need to focus on budget discussions and Senate bylaws,
which haven't been updated in four years. Katz also said
the Appropriations Committee, of which he is a mem
ber, had concerns about needing more time to handle
the transition to next year's influential committee,
"We have business that still needs work, including
continuity in Appropriations and sustainability initia
tives," said Senate Chair Varun Sivaram 'll. "But a late
transition will really set back the incoming Senate
they'll be really pressed for time."
A Senate committee was also talking as recently as
last week about ethics reforms, spearheaded largely by
Senator Shelley Gao 'll (who is also a Daily colum
nist); a green events checklist is also still in committee
talks.

Current Senator Mohammad Ali 'lO said he be
lieves the Senate is postponing dissolving to avoid dis
cussion of a potential divestment bill. Ali co-wrote the
bill to dissolve May 11.

"Senators are saying that the new Senate's not
ready," Ali said. "But from what I know, the Senate's

only postponing because they want to push a vote
about this issue [divestment] until next year."
Ali is also an organizer for Campaign Restore Hope
(CRH), a coalition of students whose mission is to raise
awareness about perceived human rights violations in
Israel and encourage divestment from some compa
nies.
On Sunday, a hard-copy petition was distributed
under the doors of some residences on campus from
CRH, asking students to write a sentence of support for
the initiative and to deliver the petition to their "dorm
representative or RA."
The petition's goals include passing "an ASSU bill
urging our University to disinvest from these compa
nies" that violate human rights.
No such bill has been introduced in the Senate.
CRH organizer Fadi Quran 'lO said the campaign in
tends to introduce a bill to the incoming Senate.
A group of students tied to the Stanford Israel Al
liance denounced the emergence of CRH's petition on
Monday.
Senate bylaws dictate that once a bill is introduced,
the Senate must wait at least one week before voting on
it. Since the Senate is not required to meet during dead
week or finals week, if the Senate postpones dissolution
until the eighth week, the incoming Senate would not
be able to pass any bills unless it chose to meet after the
ninth week.
Stanford is currently in the sixth week of spring
quarter.
