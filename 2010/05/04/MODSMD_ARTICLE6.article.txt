### JOSHUA FALK 
David Kennedy '63, professor emeritus of his
tory, was elected co-chair of the Pulitzer Prize
Board last week.
Kennedy, along with Amanda Bennett, an ex
ecutive editor for Bloomberg News, will serve a
one-year term, succeeding Anders Gyllenhaal, ex
ecutive editor of The Miami Herald.
"Not unlike a great university like Stanford,
the Pulitzer Board considers itself to be the
guardian and steward of excellence," Kennedy
said.The Pulitzer Prize is awarded annually for ex
cellence in journalism, letters, drama and music.
"I've watched other people chair the board
over the years," said Kennedy, who has been a
board member since 2002. "I've got some wonder
ful models to follow."
Kennedy won the Pulitzer Prize for history in
2000 for his book "Freedom From Fear: The
American People in Depression and War."
Of the 21 prizes the board grants, all but seven
are for journalism.
The board consists mostly of journalists, in

eluding New York Times columnist Thomas L.
Friedman and Associated Press executive editor
and senior vice president Kathleen Carroll,
among others.
"One of the things I hope to accomplish as
chair is to rebalance membership so it better mir
rors the distribution of the prizes," Kennedy said.
He emphasized that the journalists and aca
demics on the board often face challenges in
judging categories with which they are less famil
iar.
"The categories that the board always strug
gles with are music and poetry," he said. "We have
less confidence, to be frank with you, in our ex
pertise in those areas."
"For me it's been an education to be on the
board," Kennedy added. "I've learned a lot I
mean a lot about the world of journalism."
President John Hennessy praised Kennedy's
election.
"Professor Kennedy is both a distinguished
historian and a celebrated author. I think he will
be an excellent co-chair for the Pulitzer Prize
Board," Hennessy wrote in an e-mail to The Daily.

Kennedy joined the
University faculty in
1967 and currently
serves as the co-director
of the Bill Lane Center
for the American West.
His scholarship is no
table for interweaving
economic and cultural

analysis with political and social history.
His other publications include "Birth Control
in America: The Career of Margaret Sanger,"
"Over Here: The First World War and American
Society" and "The American Pageant: A History
of the Republic," an American history textbook
now in its 14th edition.

He teaches both undergraduate and graduate
courses on 20th century American history.
Kennedy received the Dean's Award for Out
standing Teaching in 1988 and the Hoagland Prize
for Excellence in Undergraduate Teaching in
2005.
