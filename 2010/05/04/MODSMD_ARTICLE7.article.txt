## BALANCING COMPETING PASSIONS Inside the lives of scholar athletes 
### ASHLEY MENZIES 
On Tuesday and Thurs
day mornings, Ash
ley Chinn Tl, a mem
ber of the softball
team, sets her alarm
for 6:50 a.m., then hits the snooze
button two or three times before
rising out of bed, rushing to get
ready and make it on time to
weights at 7:30 at the Arrillaga
Family Center.
"It's definitely hard to get out
of bed in the morning, especially
when it's still dark outside," Chinn
said.
At 8:45, after an intense session
of bench press and squats, legs
heavy and arms weak, she shifts to
a lower bike gear and heads to the
nearest dining hall to grab a quick
breakfast. Then she is off to Com
munications IB: Culture, Media,
and Society, which begins at 9:30,
but she has a difficult time concen
trating on the lecture.
"It's very hard to stay awake,"

Chinn said.
She is then immediately off to
Chinese, followed by a quick
lunch. At 1 p.m., she hurries to the
locker room to suit up and darts
onto the field for bullpen practice
where she works on pitching tech
nique for a little over an hour. She
then starts regular team practice,
which runs from 2:45 to 5:30.
"It is definitely tiring having a
'job' that requires so much physi
cal and mental energy, but I think
most athletes are used to it, or get
used to it really quickly," Chinn
said.
She is finally able to head back
to Stern to eat dinner, shower and
start her homework for the
evening around 7 p.m.
"One of the hardest things is
definitely trying to motivate your
self to do work after a long day of
practice, conditioning, and/or
weights," she added, running
through her daily schedule. "Be
cause I'm often so physically
drained, I just want to sit down and

relax or go to sleep early, but that's
not really an option when we still
have to keep up with other stu
dents."

Chinn is just one of the 200 to
225 Stanford student-athletes
that are admitted to Stanford
each year, according to Shawn
Abbott, director of undergradu

ate admission. While their intense
coursework is quite similar to
that of prestigious schools such as
Harvard or Princeton, Stanford
athletes must perform at the level
of their competitors at athletic
powerhouses like USC and the
