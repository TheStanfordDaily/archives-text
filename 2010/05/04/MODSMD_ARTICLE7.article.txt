## BALANCING COMPETING PASSIONS Inside the lives of scholar athletes 
### ASHLEY MENZIES 
On Tuesday and Thurs
day mornings, Ash
ley Chinn Tl, a mem
ber of the softball
team, sets her alarm
for 6:50 a.m., then hits the snooze
button two or three times before
rising out of bed, rushing to get
ready and make it on time to
weights at 7:30 at the Arrillaga
Family Center.
"It's definitely hard to get out
of bed in the morning, especially
when it's still dark outside," Chinn
said.
At 8:45, after an intense session
of bench press and squats, legs
heavy and arms weak, she shifts to
a lower bike gear and heads to the
nearest dining hall to grab a quick
breakfast. Then she is off to Com
munications IB: Culture, Media,
and Society, which begins at 9:30,
but she has a difficult time concen
trating on the lecture.
"It's very hard to stay awake,"

Chinn said.
She is then immediately off to
Chinese, followed by a quick
lunch. At 1 p.m., she hurries to the
locker room to suit up and darts
onto the field for bullpen practice
where she works on pitching tech
nique for a little over an hour. She
then starts regular team practice,
which runs from 2:45 to 5:30.
"It is definitely tiring having a
'job' that requires so much physi
cal and mental energy, but I think
most athletes are used to it, or get
used to it really quickly," Chinn
said.
She is finally able to head back
to Stern to eat dinner, shower and
start her homework for the
evening around 7 p.m.
"One of the hardest things is
definitely trying to motivate your
self to do work after a long day of
practice, conditioning, and/or
weights," she added, running
through her daily schedule. "Be
cause I'm often so physically
drained, I just want to sit down and

relax or go to sleep early, but that's
not really an option when we still
have to keep up with other stu
dents."

Chinn is just one of the 200 to
225 Stanford student-athletes
that are admitted to Stanford
each year, according to Shawn
Abbott, director of undergradu

ate admission. While their intense
coursework is quite similar to
that of prestigious schools such as
Harvard or Princeton, Stanford
athletes must perform at the level
of their competitors at athletic
powerhouses like USC and the

University of Oregon.
Student athletes sometimes have
difficulty balancing their competing
passions.
"It's hard when you're tired all of
the time to begin with, and if you have
a paper due in a few days but you also
have games all weekend, more often
than not the paper or assignment is
the thing that gets put off in favor of
sleeping to prepare for competition,"
said Shannon Koplitz 'lO, another
member of the Softball team. "Five
hours a day minimum devoted to
your sport can be hard to juggle with
the amount of time necessary to also
compete in the classroom."
"[Student athletes] select Stanford
because of the merger of world class
academics and world class athletics,"
said director of athletics Bob Bowlsby.
"We expect our student athletes to
excel in both areas."
The athletes do their best to live up
to these expectations and sometimes
to exceed them.
"As a student-athlete, I can be an
active member of the Stanford com
munity both on and off the field," said
Greg Hirshman 'll, a member of the
men's tennis team.
Hirshman, an economics and math
ematics major, has a list of activities that
he balances with his academics and ath
letics. He is an officer for the newly cre
ated Stanford Tea Party group, founder
and editor of The Cardinal Principle, an
official quarterly editorial newspaper

with conservative leanings, and mem
ber of the Stanford Conservative Soci
ety. He volunteers to help disabled ten
nis players improve their skills, has a
4.002 GPA and still manages to get
eight hours and 45 minutes of sleep
each night.
"Sometimes it is difficult to balance
everything that I do, but strategic plan
ning, time management and getting
enough sleep really helps me be suc
cessful in my pursuits," Hirshman said.
Most of the athletes agreed that al
though they experience a significant
amount of pressure, they feel quite
privileged to be in their positions.
They believe the rewards are greater
than the sacrifices they make as stu
dent athletes.
"Think about how many people
would die to be in our place," Hirshman
said. "Being a part of the Stanford ten
nis team is a dream come true."
"It's the only time in my life I get
such an amazing opportunity like this,"
added softball player Alissa Haber 'lO.
For Hirshman, academics are a top
priority.
"The reward is so great to be able to
succeed in the classroom," he said.
Tyrone Mcgraw 'lO, a member of the
track and field team and school record
holder in the 60 meter dash, agreed.
"During season, academics are still
first, but track and field is a very close
second," he said.
Cecelia Haig 'll plays squash, a
sport known for boasting one of the
highest team GPAs. She said that
school is more important, but she still
loves her sport.
"School is priority, but if I have a se
rious assignment due and squash prac
tice will hurt my performance on it, I'll

miss practice," she said.
But for other athletes, academics
don't necessarily make it to the top
shelf.
Chike Amajoyi 'll, a linebacker on
the football team, said that like many of
his teammates, he has professional aspi
rations to go to the NFL, so academics
are a secondary concern.
"If I want to pursue my professional
career, football is my number-one pri
ority," he said. "At this point I feel that I
have put in far too much work to let an
opportunity to play professionally slip
by. Academics is important and that's
why I came to Stanford, but I've always
seen it as a backup plan."

Haber said she sets her athletics and
academics on an equal footing, but she
believes one may have a more lasting
impact.

"Twenty years from now, I'm not
going to care what I got in [my chem
class]," she said. "I'm going to remem
ber what kind of season I had."

But while many athletes said that
they put academics and athletics on
equal par, they joked that some stu
dent-athletes must prioritize their sport
because it's the only reason they are at
Stanford. Max Bergen 'll, who plays

for the football team, definitely feels the
heat to perform well on the field be
cause he feels that his "scholarship is on
the line."
Officially, every Stanford student is
here at least in part because of academ
ics.
"The academic record is still the pri
mary focus of our evaluation for any
candidate who applies for admission,"
Abbott said. "Any student who applies
for admission must demonstrate that
they are first academically prepared
and competitive as a scholar-athlete."
The students believe it is their athlet
ic talent on top of their intense academ
ic performance that makes them
unique.
"I feel like, as an individual, I pro
vide another element to the diversity
that Stanford University was founded
on and prides itself in today," Haber
said.
