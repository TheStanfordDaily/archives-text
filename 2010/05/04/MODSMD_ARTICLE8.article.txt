## Hospitals, nurses still at impasse 
### CAROLINE CHEN STAFF WRITER 
Stanford nurses have submitted a coun
terproposal to Stanford Hospital & Clinics
and Lucile Packard Children's Hospital as
negotiations for a new contract remain
deadlocked.
The two parties' old contract expired in
March after months of negotiations failed to
satisfy the demands of the hospitals and
nurses. Two weeks ago, 2,302 out of 2,700
nurses represented by the Committee for
Recognition of Nursing Achievement
(CRONA) rejected the hospitals' "last, best
and final offer."
Though CRONA accepted the wage pro
posals from the hospitals' last offer, it finds
contention with other points; in particular,
the union's counterproposal centers on a
new professional development program
and paid time off.
Negotiations between the union and the
hospitals have soured in recent weeks, with
CRONA representatives accusing the hos
pitals of rejecting multiple requests to meet
and discuss the situation.
"It was obvious from the beginning that
the hospital had no interest in talking to us,"
said CRONA lead attorney Peter Nuss
baum.
Lucile Packard spokesperson Sarah Sta
ley stated that the hospitals are not interest
ed in further bargaining.
"The bargaining process was done in
March," Staley said. "I think it's fair to say
that what we've proposed is competitive,
generous and fair. If what the nurses pro
pose is within the parameters of our last,
best and final offer, we would certainly be
up to hearing those."
CRONA is awaiting the hospitals' re
sponse to its counterproposal, which is ex
pected this week.
According to law, both parties must con
tinue to follow their old contract until a new
contract is in place. However, negotiations
remain stalled, and the hospitals could at
tempt to declare an impasse, which would
effectively institute the hospital's latest pro
posal.
Nussbaum said if the hospitals did so, the
nurses would not rule out the option
of going on strike.
Professional Nurse Development
Program
Central to the current dispute is
the hospital's proposed Professional
Nurse Development Program.
Within the hospitals, nurses are
ranked according to a four-step hier
archy, in which employees at nurse
four status are the highest ranked.
The hospital's new development
program rewrites the requirements
that nurses must fulfill in order to
move up the ladder or retain their
current status.
CRONA representatives claim
the new point system sets unattain
able standards for nurses and down
grades years of experience in favor
of article-writing and symposium at
tendance, Under the hospital's last
proposal, nurses would not only
have to satisfy the point require
ments, but be evaluated by a panel in
order to receive promotions. Nuss
baum called the interview process
"totally subjective."
"Experience is more important
than diplomas," said CRONA presi
dent Lorie Johnson, who is also a
nurse in Stanford Hospital's Cardio
thoracic Intensive Care Unit. "A
nurse who is not able to publish and
cannot present himself or herself
flawlessly in front of a panel will not
get promoted."
CRONA's counterproposal re
quests that the hospital institute an
appeal process for nurses who fail
the interview.

Nussbaum believes that the pro
gram is a "wolf in sheep's clothing,"
designed to demote a large number
of level three and four nurses. He
claimed that under the new pro
gram, with fewer nurses able to at
tain senior status, the hospitals will
save $l5 to $2O million annually.
Responding to the claim, Staley
said accusations of financial motiva
tion are a "complete misrepresenta
tion" of the hospitals' intention.
"We feel strongly about [the pro
gram] because it advances nursing
practice," she said, "and we hold our
selves to a high level of perform
ance."
The hospitals would not say how
many nurses' statuses would be af
fected or whether the program would
have any significant financial effects.
Paid Time Off
The other key issue concerns paid
time off. The hospitals stress that al
though they would not offer employ
ees separate accounts of guaranteed
sick leave, vacations and holidays,
nurses would be able to save and
carry up to 520 hours of paid time off.
CRONA's counterproposal sug
gestions mainly deal with the way in

which paid time off is accrued and
compensated. For instance, the
union suggested that a staff nurse
who has a balance of 480 hours of
paid time off ought to have the op
tion of using the time within 90 days
or be paid for up to 80 hours.
The Stanford Packard Facts web
site lists accrual hours compared to a

number of hospitals, including the
Daughters of Charity hospitals, the
John Muir Health System and the
Sutter hospitals. The Stanford hospi
tals claim their maximum accrual
amount is the highest.
