## Hospitals, nurses still at impasse 
### CAROLINE CHEN STAFF WRITER 
Stanford nurses have submitted a coun
terproposal to Stanford Hospital & Clinics
and Lucile Packard Children's Hospital as
negotiations for a new contract remain
deadlocked.
The two parties' old contract expired in
March after months of negotiations failed to
satisfy the demands of the hospitals and
nurses. Two weeks ago, 2,302 out of 2,700
nurses represented by the Committee for
Recognition of Nursing Achievement
(CRONA) rejected the hospitals' "last, best

contention with other points; in particular,
the union's counterproposal centers on a
new professional development program
and paid time off.
Negotiations between the union and the
hospitals have soured in recent weeks, with
CRONA representatives accusing the hos
pitals of rejecting multiple requests to meet
and discuss the situation.
"It was obvious from the beginning that
the hospital had no interest in talking to us,"
said CRONA lead attorney Peter Nuss

Lucile Packard spokesperson Sarah Sta

ed in further bargaining.
"The bargaining process was done in
March," Staley said. "I think it's fair to say
that what we've proposed is competitive,
generous and fair. If what the nurses pro
pose is within the parameters of our last,
best and final offer, we would certainly be
up to hearing those."
CRONA is awaiting the hospitals' re
sponse to its counterproposal, which is ex
pected this week.
According to law, both parties must con
tinue to follow their old contract until a new
contract is in place. However, negotiations
remain stalled, and the hospitals could at
tempt to declare an impasse, which would
effectively institute the hospital's latest pro
posal.
Nussbaum said if the hospitals did so, the
