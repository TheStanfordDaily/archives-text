## GET IT RIGHT Hindsight may not be 20-20 
### Erica Morgan 
Goldman Sachs is taking the fall for Wall
Street's role in America's economic re
cession, providing proponents of fi
nancial reform with the perfect platform to
push their agendas. The logic goes something
like this: it is possible that a Goldman employ
ee is guilty of a fraudulent transaction; there
fore Goldman is an entirely corrupt institu
tion; therefore all such financial institutions
must be corrupt (corruption is, after all, en
demic to all profit-seeking establishments);
therefore the administration must step in to
protect the people from the horrors of the free
market as represented by illegal activity by
bankers on Wall Street. The timing of the
fraud accusations is extremely convenient for
rallying support for what was a dying attempt
at financial reform. As allegations of Gold
man's misdeeds whip up public outrage
against the entire financial banking system, I
am hesitant to jump on the blame bandwagon.
The specific instance of fraud for which Gold
man currently stands accused does not neces
sarily implicate the financial sector of rampant
wrongdoing. Disclaimer: I do not pretend to
be a financial attorney nor an economic ex
pert. These observations are those of a casual
student of economics trying to keep a cool
head amidst the frenzy of finger pointing.
Let's start with a synopsis of the banking
transaction in question. Goldman Sachs and
other such banks create structured securities
based on the needs/wants of their clients. The
securities in question were collateral debt ob
ligations (CDOs), which, on a simple level, we
can think of as bundles of mortgage loans. So
a homebuyer (we'll call him Joe) goes to a
mortgage originator such as Wells Fargo or
Bank of America. Banks like Goldman buy
these mortgages, and package them through
"arranging" companies professionals
whose job is to create quality CDO products.
The arranger in this case was ACA manage
ment. Arrangers look over the suggested
mortgage bundle, eliminate some securities,
add others and ultimately approve the CDO.
CDOs were ragingly popular during the
build-up of the housing bubble. As long as in
terest rates remained low and housing prices
rose, banks and their investors raked in the
dough. As we've seen, this pleasant situation
came to an abrupt end when the housing mar
ket fell apart.

Ok, on to the fraud accusations. John Paul
son, manager of a hedge fund, did independ
ent research and decided that many of the
smartest people in the financial world were
wrong. The rise in housing was unsustainable
and was going to fall apart relatively soon.
While his peers basked in the benefits of rising
prices, Paulson wagered that housing prices
were going to fall, hard. When this happened,
he speculated that mortgage borrowers like
Joe would default on their loans, and the
CDOs would become lose significant value.
He asked Goldman to create a package of
mortgages that he would then "short" (bet
that they would fall in value). As a result,

Goldman employee Fabrice Tourre met with
ACA and asked the company to arrange the
package. ACA reviewed the securities that
Paulson wanted and decided to only include
some 55 of the 123 requested. It then ap
proved the CDO.named ABASCUS.in which
German bank IKB invested $l5O million.
Thus, the transaction basically came down to a
bet between Paulson and IKB, with Goldman
acting as middleman. If the CDO had gained
in value, Paulson would have suffered heavy
losses. However, in the subsequent mortgage
crisis (which few but Paulson predicted), he
enjoyed unprecedented gains.

And where is the fraud? It seems that Fab
rice Tourre did not reveal to ACA that Paul
son intended to bet against the CDO when he
gave ACA the list of mortgages Paulson want
ed included in the package.
Well, perhaps Goldman will be found
guilty of fraudulent behavior. It would seem,
however, that it was incumbent on the ACA to
determine if the securities were of good
enough quality to be included in the CDO. All
parties involved in the trade were aware of the
components of the ABASCUS security.
Whether or not Paulson bet against the funds
that he himself selected seems largely irrele
vant. The fact remains that ACA's job was to
rate and package the securities.

What concerns me more, however, is how
the vilification of Goldman distracts from
other relevant parties. President Obama
blames the free market for the financial crisis:
"a free market was never meant to be a free li
cense to take whatever you can get, however
you can get it.That is what happened too often
in the years leading up to the crisis." This
defamation of the financial sector ignores the
role of government in the market (the market
is not and was not "free"). Many economists
suggest that government sponsored agencies
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (nationalized in
2008) incentivized risky lending practices and
that past government bailouts created moral
hazard. Can we say that government interven
tion in the market contributed less to the crisis
than a misleading negotiation by a Goldman
Sachs employee? The nuanced sequence of
events leading to the current recession in
volved many parties (including individuals
who purchased homes they could not afford).
Dumping total responsibility on the banking
industry may be convenient, but it hardly
seems logical.
