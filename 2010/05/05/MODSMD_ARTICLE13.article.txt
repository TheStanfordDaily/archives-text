# OP-ED
## Campaign Restore Hope Already Succeeding 
### FADI QURAN '10 Campaign Restore Hope 
In Tuesday's Daily, a kind, honest, and
warm friend of mine, Yishai Kabaker, sub
mitted an opinion piece ("We Choose to
Invest", May 4) in which he highlighted a new
campaign by the Stanford Israel Alliance
(SIA) to invest in rebuilding the lives of my
people the Palestinians. The moment I
read this new proposal, I knew Campaign Re
store Hope (CRH), a campaign being led by a
diverse coalition of Stanford undergraduates,
and vocally supported by many hundreds of
students on campus only a few days after its
launch, had succeeded in making its first posi
tive mark on our university. I want to person
ally thank SIA for their proposal, and offer
them the full assistance of CRH. We will in
clude their proposal with our list of 6 creative
ways to end the conflict. This list includes
plans such as arranging a trip for Stanford en
trepreneurial students and professors to work
with scientists and engineers to develop alter
native energy systems that can satisfy impov
erished populations' energy necessities.
There are a few mistakes and misconcep
tions presented in my friend Yishai's op-ed,
however, that I would like to mend.
The first misconception is that investment
in building infrastructure is a substitute for di
vestment. Investing in infrastructure without
first divesting from companies that actively
destroy it and severely violate intrinsic human
rights is akin to providing a bludgeon to a
criminal and Band-Aids to his victim doing
so ignores the root causes of the problem. Fur
thermore, although I understand why Jews
and Palestinians may want to invest in peace,
I do not expect my Bosnian, Tibetan, and
Bangladeshi friends at Stanford to do so. It
would be nice if they all did, but they are
under no ethical obligation to do so and have
other issues they care about. Contrarily, we all
have a moral obligation to make sure that we
are not lending ourselves to human rights
abuses. Our proud university clearly promises
to "take ethical factors into consideration"
and has set ethical responsibility policies.
The second misconception is assuming

that Campaign Restore Hope will be as divi
sive as other divestment campaign. This cam
paign is different, firstly because it is not only
a divestment push, but a push for educating
the student body, opening up dialogue, and
uniting the campus community around a
common cause. We are supported by a wide
range of students from diverse backgrounds.
It's about the 53,000 elementary, high school
and college students being obstructed from
getting to their schools. It's about the 3.5 mil
lion people who are prevented from access
ing water. It's about the workers who are
called monkeys, thrown on palm trees for
hours, and forced to defecate while they latch
on for their lives. It's about those who lan
guish in poverty because international aid is
being funneled by corrupt leaders. And it's
about standing up to those who spread hate
and anti-Semitism.

The restore hope campaign is guided by a
great felling of love for our common humani
ty, and that's why it's spreading so quickly.
One of the things I learned at Stanford, an
intrinsic American value, is that we should
never turn our backs to an issue because it's too
complex, difficult or divisive. Is divisiveness a
good reason to ignore human rights abuses?
Dr. King and President Lincoln didn't think so.
This country and our university were built by
those who sought to answer complex and divi
sive questions, and we need to keep this preco
cious fire burning by tackling one of the most
difficult issues of our time. The Restore Hope
Campaign is a creative way of doing just that,
and it is open source so anyone can join.
Let's work on ending injustice together. In
stead of discussing this important issue on the
Daily's editorial page, on flyers, or through
websites, let's do it face to face. Let's have a
campus wide constructive town-hall meeting
where we can all come together, discuss the
topics and objectives academically, awe the
cynics, and restore hope to millions.
