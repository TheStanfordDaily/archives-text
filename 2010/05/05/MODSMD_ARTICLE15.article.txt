# STRANGELY CHARMING
## Kill Baby Krill 
### Jack Cackler 
Two weeks have passed since poor over
sight resulted in a BP oil rig exploding
in the Gulf of Mexico, resulting in the
deaths of eleven people. More than 5,000
barrels of oil are being spilled every day into
the Gulf and onto the surrounding coasts,
which will kill wildlife, destroy ecosystems
and hinder economic growth for years to
come. The disaster comes on the heels of a
swell in momentum for offshore drilling, and
the movement's supporters are quickly
scrambling to defend the practice. Unfortu
nately for all of us, the backbone of defense
behind offshore drilling was not grounded in
reason or rational scientific inquiry, but in
rhetoric and invective. The Oil Pollution Act
of 1924 was the first major legislation affect
ing oil drilling in the United States. While the
act originally intended to protect the nation's
aquatic life, pressure from the oil industry
eroded the act to the point where it was un
enforceable, and rampant exceptions limited
its applicability. In March 1967, the Torrey
Canyon, chartered by BP, spilled over
120,000 tons of oil off Southwestern Eng
land. This was followed by the explosion of
an oil rig off the coast of Santa Barbara in
1969, and the environmental damage to both
regions was tremendous.
The disasters accelerated legislation
sponsored by Senator Edmund Muskie to
amend the Oil Pollution Act in order to
allow industry regulation to prevent future
disasters. Citing EPA research on the eco
logical effects of polluted groundwater and
runoff, and the devastating effects of the ex
plosion in Santa Barbara, the Clean Water
Act of 1972 regulated all point sources of
pollution, including land based pollution
and oil spills. But as memories of the disas
ters faded, oil and agricultural interests
slowly chipped away at regulatory authori
ty, and Congress passed more and more ex
emptions to the Clean Water Act into the
1980s. This ultimately resulted in the Water
Quality Act in 1987, which provided some

provisions to enforce the Clean Water Act,
but was loaded with exceptions, and, like the
passage of the Oil Pollution Act 50 years
prior, was difficult to enforce.

As if on cue, the Exxon Valdez ran
aground in 1989, spilling 37,000 tons of oil
into Alaskan waters and blanketing 1300
miles of coastline. The effort required to
clean up the spill was monumental, the envi
ronmental impact was catastrophic and the
region's fishing and tourism industries were
devastated. Once again, people were forced
to learn firsthand not only the effects of a ca
tastrophe on the environment, but also on
thousands of people's lives and economic
wellbeing.
And yet, two decades later, offshore
drilling not only gained traction, but gar
nered national fervor with the simple an
them "Drill, Baby, Drill" first uttered by
RNC Chairman Michael Steele at the 2008
Republican Convention. Behind the slogan
was the sentiment that the solution to Amer
ica's energy problems laid in offshore
drilling. Offshore drilling, it was thought, was
a safe way to acquire domestic oil and to de
crease reliance on foreign countries without
polluting American soil or having to wait for
untested clean energy from wind, solar or
other sources. And while that's a nice idea,
the numbers simply do not back it up.
Despite advances in technology, drilling
for and transporting oil is not getting safer by
any means, and, in fact, more accidents are
happening. There have been at least two oil

spills of 100 tons or more in every year since
2000 except 2008, and as many spills in that
period (26) as in the previous 20 years. The
benefits of drilling are miniscule; all of the
coastlines in America contain only .25 per
cent of the world's oil. While .25 percent is
more than nothing, given the disasters that
surface time and time again, drilling offshore
for oil simply is not worth the risk.
When a disaster continues to occur every
couple months for over 30 years, it is academ
ically disingenuous to call it an accident. If
you accept that it is untenable that the oil in
dustry annually spill thousands of tons of oil
into the world's waterways as part of their
business plan, and yet that this exactly re
flects recent history, there is no intellectually
honest argument for continued offshore
drilling. Thankfully, both Governor
Schwarzenegger and President Obama have
announced a moratorium on earlier plans to
expand offshore drilling in the wake of this
disaster. Given the abundance of rapidly de
veloping clean alternatives to drilling, it real
ly is time to move Beyond Petroleum.
But the main culprit that allows disastrous
ecological practices to continuously skirt
regulation is a willingness within the Ameri
can populace to overpower scientific re
search with baseless rhetoric. Slogans are
fantastic ways to galvanize a movement
around an idea, but unless they are support
ed by truth, they can be powerful tools of
subversion. Every slogan deserves intense
scrutiny, whether it be "Drill, baby, drill!"
"Yes we can!" or "Beat Cal!" And while two
of the above slogans are backed up by signif
icantly more substance than the other, in the
spirit of this column, I encourage you not to
take my word on it, but to do your own re
search to draw your own conclusions.

But the main culprit that allows disastrous
ecological practices to continuously skirt
regulation is a willingness within the Ameri

search with baseless rhetoric. Slogans are
fantastic ways to galvanize a movement

ed by truth, they can be powerful tools of
subversion. Every slogan deserves intense
scrutiny, whether it be "Drill, baby, drill!"
"Yes we can!" or "Beat Cal!" And while two

icantly more substance than the other, in the
spirit of this column, I encourage you not to
take my word on it, but to do your own re
search to draw your own conclusions.
