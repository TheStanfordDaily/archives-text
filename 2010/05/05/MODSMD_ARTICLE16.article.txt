## Finding resiliency on Farm 
### Wyndam Makowsky Between the lines 
What is resiliency? It is
the ability to bend,
but not break, only to
then bounce back.
It is to face a challenge so trying it
pushes you to your depths, only it can
not submerge you.
It is to conquer the odds in seeming
ly untenable situations.
It is the story of three Stanford
sports teams.
Let's take a gander. Men's volley
ball is a good place to start.
The Cardinal is the top seed in the
four-team NCAA Tournament, which
will take place at Maples this weekend.
But just three years ago, before Stan
ford could dispatch opponents with rel
ative ease, the program was in a hole
that appeared insurmountable.
In 2007, Stanford finished a measly
3-25 and last in the MPSF. The Cardi
nal's last NCAA appearance, in 1997,
was drifting further from memoiy and
the thought of approaching that level
of play again was even more fleeting.
So what happened? Current seniors
like Evan Romero and Kawika Shoji
powered a resurgence that has landed
the Cardinal on top of the MPSF in
short order.

This was accentuated by Saturday's
victory over Cal State Northridge on
Saturday night. Stanford won in
straight sets over a team that it had yet
to beat this season, and had only beat
en once in its past eight attempts. The
Cardinal downed a squad that had
owned Stanford, a squad that had fin
ished ranked in the top 10 in each of the
past six seasons. And in doing so, the
Cardinal achieved an NCAA berth
quicker than most anyone believed
possible.

And that was even with a heart
breaking loss along the way. A1
Roderigues, an assistant coach for 18
years, died from stomach cancer in
March. The players have sewn "Al"
onto the right arms of their jerseys; his
memory is the motivating factor for the
team.

In the span of just a few years, the
team has faced tragedy off the court
and tribulations on it, and yet it stands
two contests away from an NCAA
championship.
Resiliency.

A year ago, the women's lacrosse
team gathered in Jimmy V's Cafe to see
where it would be seeded in the NCAA
Tournament. The players watched the
selection show, and waited for their
name to be called. It never came. De
spite arguably the best season in school
history, which included its fifth straight
MPSF title, the Cardinal was left out of
the dance. Theories abounded the
largest being that of coastal bias in a
sport that has its greatest hotbeds in the
east but the disappointment was
palpable.
Instead of taking their sticks and
going home, the players pushed even
further this season. The MPSF, for the
first time, received an automatic bid to
the NCAA Tournament; the Cardinal
was determined to seize it. Sunday pre
sented that opportunity, but despite an
early lead in the MPSF championship
game, Stanford found itself trailing the
Denver Pioneers in overtime.
With less than 30 seconds left in the
extra period, the Cardinal tied the
game. The match headed to sudden
death, and with five seconds left, junior
Karen Nesbitt scored the game-winner
her third goal of the contest.
Last May, Stanford was faced with
immense disappointment; now, the
Cardinal will head to the NCAA Tour
nament, where it will face Massachu
setts in the play-in game, at home, on
Saturday.
Resiliency.

The women's rugby team was
downed in the national championship
by Penn State, but just getting there re
quired an impressive display of heart.
The Cardinal beat Brown, 43-32, in a
wild semifinal match, accentuated no
better than by an impressive stand to
keep the Bears off the board at the end
of the first half

As time expired on the stadium
clock the referee did not have the
same running time, which meant that
play continued even after the score
board read 00:00 the Bears, down
12-8, advanced to within a couple of
feet of the try line. In a contest in which
it seemed that every time a team came
close to scoring, it did, the Cardinal put
