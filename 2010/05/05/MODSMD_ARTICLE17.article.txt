# FAST TIMES ON FARM

### ANARGHYA VARDHANA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
This weekend, the Stanford track and
field team hosted the legendary Payton
Jordan Invitational. Stanford hosts this an
nual event in honor of Jordan, a former
coach, who passed away in February of
2009. In the past, the meet has been known
to attract elite track and field athletes from
all over the country, resulting in spectacular
times and marks in various events. This
year proved no different, with records
falling and several personal bests earned
for the Cardinal.
Chris Solinsky, a professional runner for
Nike and Oregon Track Club Elite, provid
ed the highlight for the meet by smashing
the American record in the 10,000 meters
with a time of 26:59.60. Interestingly
enough, Meb Keflezighi, an elite runner
who won the New York City Marathon in
2009, set a 10,000 meter record at the Pay
ton Jordan Invitational back in 2001, with a
time of 27:13.98. Solinsky's achievement
was huge, setting a record time and also
being the first non-African to run under 27
minutes.
Aside from the professional runners,
Stanford athletes had some incredible per
formances this weekend, achieving some
personal bests and moving into high rank
ings in the NCAA.
Leading the way for the Stanford men
was sophomore Amaechi Morton, who
broke his own record in the 400-meter
hurdles with a time of 50.03 seconds.
Morton's time not only retains his top
spot in the Stanford books, but also puts

him in the third-place position in the en
tire nation, an incredible feat for this
young hurdler.
"I'm definitely stoked about this sea
son, being able to run as fast as I did, with a
few technical difficulties," Morton said. "It
was a good race, but could definitely be bet
ter."

Also faring very well in the 400-meter
hurdles was senior Durell Coleman, who
ran a personal best time of 51.70 seconds to
put himself in the top 25 in the NCA A as of
Saturday.
Senior Danny Belch also fared well in
the sprints. Belch, who has been having a
great season thus far, won both the 100-
and 200-meter dashes with times of 10.71
and 21.57, respectively. His time in the 200
meters was a personal best.
On the distances side, the men domi
nated, with sophomore Dylan Ferris lead
ing the way. Ferris won the 1,500 meters
with a time of 3:40.07, moving him up to
fourth in the nation. Right behind Ferris
was junior Elliott Heath, who finished sec
ond in the meet, and fifth in the nation,
with a time of 3:41.27. Accompanying
these two men was sophomore Chris Der
rick, who usually runs longer distances, but
fared well regardless. Derrick finished
with a time of 3:42.45 in his first collegiate
1,500 meters. Derrick will most likely re
turn to his longer races, but his ability to
ran fast in these middle distances will ben
efit him in finishing strong.
Ferris was happy with both himself and
his teammates.
