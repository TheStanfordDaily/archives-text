There's a story going around that a man is
trying to sell the golf clubs from "Tiger
Slam" on eßay. When I first heard this, I
nearly did a Tiger fist pump myself. How
cool would it be to own the clubs used by
Tiger's wife to hack the windows in his Cadillac Es
calade the night he descended from Mount Olympus
and became a mere mortal?
Great conversation starter, great bar bet and prob
ably a great way to shave a few strokes off your golf
score.
But then I kept reading and realized "Tiger Slam"
was not referring to that infamous Thanksgiving Night
(see: Tigergate), but to Tiger's dominance on the golf
course from 2000-2001. Tiger held all four modern
major championships simultaneously a feat no
other golfer has accomplished, hence the term a
"Tiger Slam."
Still, my mistake got me thinking: What other odd
sports-related items would I most want to buy on
eßay?
Lawrence Taylor's 41 empty Coors Light Cans. Dur
ing an interview at the 2010 NFL Draft, LT was asked
what his fondest memory was the day he was drafted.
His response: "I don't remember too much, I had 41
Coors Lights. So I couldn't tell you." When asked if he
had his family around that day, the former Giants
linebacker simply said, "I had my drinking buddies
with me."
Tim Tebow's Eye Black. Reminding atheist fans
everywhere why he's better than you.
Happy Gilmore's Hockey Skate. The one he took off
and tried to stab someone with, earning him one of his
two league records.
Barry Bonds' Urine. Don't let your imagination run
too wild. I just want to prove that the greatest hitter of
all-time and my childhood hero never used steroids or
other performance enhancing drugs. (Hey, it's a hypo
thetical column, right?)
Paul Pierce's Wheelchair. Just to be able to annoy
Lakers fans whenever I want.
Wilt Chamberlain's Black Book. Just to see how accu
rate his claim of 10,000 girls is. And, you know, if I'm
ever lonely on Saturday night.
Michael Phelps' Bong. Giving stoners everywhere an
athletic role model to look up to.
The Taser Used by Citizen's Bank Park Security. If you
haven't seen the video now, a 17-year-old kid ran onto
the field during a Phillies-Cardinals game, juked a few
guards and then was absolutely dropped by a police
officer's Taser. Was it a completely unnecessary use of
force? Yes. Would it be awesome to own the col
lectible? Absolutely.
