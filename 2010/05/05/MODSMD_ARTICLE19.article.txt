# Card halts losing streak
## 
### DANIEL BOHM SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford baseball team (23-17,10-8)
got back to its winning ways early this week,
beating a pair of teams it is expected to beat:
Santa Clara and San Jose State.

The Cardinal entered the week on a four
game losing streak and out of the national
rankings.
A group of freshmen led the Cardinal to
victory on both Monday against Santa Clara
and Tuesday against San Jose State.
On Monday, it was a pair of freshman

pitchers Dean McArdle and Mark Appel
that paced Stanford's 8-3 victory by keep
ing the Bronco hitters at bay. McAr
dle (3-0) got the start and went four innings,
allowing just two runs on five hits. Appel
then came in and pitched the final five in
nings for his second career save. Appel was
utterly dominant in his first three innings of
work, before allowing a run in the top of the
eighth and then settling down to finish the
game.
The Cardinal offense was led by a pair of
players that have only been used part-time
this season: junior outfielder Dave Giuliani
and junior catcher Ben Clowe.
Giuliani drove a two-out 3-2 pitch deep
over the trees behind the right field fence in
the bottom of the third, extending the Stan
ford lead at the time to 7-0. The home run
was the first of Giuliani's career.
"When I get a chance, it's nice to do
something to help the team win," Giuliani
said. "Most of the time when I'm in the
game, it's as a defensive replacement and I
don't do that much, so it's nice to contribute
to the wins."
Clowe got the start behind the plate as
junior Zach Jones was given the day off,
since the Cardinal had games on five consec
utive days. Clowe took full advantage of his
opportunity by getting a pair of hits, includ
ing an RBI double down the right field line
to cap the Stanford scoring in the bottom of
the seventh.
Freshman Kenny Diekroeger who
moved over from third base to shortstop for
the games as the everyday shortstop, junior
Jake Schlander, recovers from a broken
right pinky he suffered at Washington this
weekend also continued to play well,
scoring three runs. It is unclear how long
Schlander will be out, but the injury is not
believed to be serious.
Diekroeger picked up where he left off
on Tuesday, leading the Cardinal hit parade
with three in a 10-7 victory. The star fresh
man now has a 14-game hitting streak.
Tuesday's win was littered with three
Cardinal home runs. The first was a solo shot
by Jones in the bottom of the second, ex
tending the Cardinal lead to 2-0. Freshman

GAME NOTES ! After a disappointing week last week,
baseball has bounced back strong with two home
victories in the last two days, over Santa Clara and
San Jose State, respectively. The Card (23-17) is
back in action, and back on the road, this weekend,
as it heads down the coast to play a three game se
ries against Long Beach State. The 49ers are 20-20
on the season so far.
