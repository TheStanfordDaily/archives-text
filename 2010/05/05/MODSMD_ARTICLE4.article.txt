# Early commutes â€” and perspective
## Stanford students share their ROTC experiences as faculty weigh the program's return 
### KATE ABBOTT DESK EDITOR 
At 3:15 a.m. on Tuesday mornings,
Kassandra Mangosing 'lO has to
shower, put her hair into a secured,
regulation bun and make her uniform
presentable before picking up a fel
low reserve officer training corps
(ROTC) cadet, driving to San Jose
State University and beginning her
walk-through to plan activities for the
day's training session. By 10 a.m. she
is back in her Mirrielees apartment
and ready for a nap before hitting the
gym, going to class and singing at a
capella rehearsal for Everyday Peo
ple.
Mangosing, a self-proclaimed
"military brat" her father has
served in the Air Force for 27 years
didn't always see herself joining the
ROTC program. But after signing up
in high school, and eventually receiv
ing a scholarship, she finds herself at
the end of her senior year at Stanford,
set to work as an Air Force mainte
nance officer after serving in the Air
Force ROTC program throughout
college.
Mangosing spoke Tuesday
evening at a panel discussion, "ROTC
and the Stanford Experience," pre
sented by the Truman Service Initia
tive. The panel came amid renewed
debate about whether or not to bring
the ROTC program back to Stanford.

Stanford students who participate in ROTC programs at nearby universities spoke on Tuesday. The Faculty Senate has formed a committee to study bringing
ROTC back to Stanford, where the program was ended in 1973. From left: Jimmy Ruck '11, Kirk Morrow '11, Kassandra Mangosing '10 and Akhil lyer '11.
fense William Perry '49 M.S. '5O rec
ommended in March that the Faculty
Senate investigate bringing the pro
gram back to campus. They said then
that the repeal of the federal "don't
ask, don't tell" policy should be a pre
requisite for Stanford to bring back
ROTC.
"I believe we should still think it
through, but that ["don't ask"] would
be a formidable obstacle," Kennedy
said this week.

TSI organizer Jessie Knight 'lO
said that the panel was held "mostly
because the ROTC debate is starting
to reopen."
"We don't feel it's our job to advo
cate one side or the other," Knight
said. "But we do want to make sure
there's an informed debate about it,
and take the opportunity to educate
people who are interested in learning
about it so that then, as things such as
the Faculty Senate debate continue,
the community will be able to engage
in that in an intellectual way."
The Faculty Senate is not expect
ed to report the findings of its com
mittee on ROTC's return until the
fall.

Stanford's ROTC program ended

in 1973 after a tumultuous existence
during the anti-war activities on cam
pus during the 19605.
At Tuesday's panel, five students
and one graduate described their ex
periences in the Air Force, army and
navy ROTC programs, which send
them on commutes to San Jose State,
Santa Clara and UC-Berkeley sever
al times a week.
Asked how they believe their ex
periences with ROTC would have
changed "for better or worse" if at
Stanford, their answers were mixed.
"I think there's benefits to
both," said Melissa Corley 'O4, now
an Air Force captain. "One benefit
of getting off campus is being out of
the Stanford bubble. You see a dif
ferent world and you experience
dealing with a lot of diverse back
grounds."
"There's a lot more logistics you
have to deal with," Corley added.
"On that note, it's exhausting to get
up early every morning and drive to
San Jose every day of the week and
then deal with Stanford classes and
Stanford commitments."
In an interview, Mangosing said
"personally, I wouldn't fight for it."
"I really find value in going to a
cross-town ROTC program because
of the diverse group of people that
you get to interact with and the sheer
privilege and getting to leave this
campus," Mangosing said. "It's the

best campus and you don't really ap
preciate how great it is until you go to
another one."
Mangosing did critique the cross
town program because students
don't receive academic credit and it
"severely limits" what classes a
ROTC member can take. Most have
mandatory requirements all day on
Thursdays.
"A social life, you can make
work," she said. "But academically,
you're ultimately dealing with a
schedule that isn't in your control."
Army ROTC member Oliver
Ennis 'll, who commutes to Santa
Clara, is in favor of bringing the pro
gram back to Stanford. He said
ROTC's return, for however few stu
dents, would "save a lot of time [com
muting]." Mangosing and Ennis
agreed that the University revisiting
the issue is the first step in garnering
support for the program's return.
Overall, Mangosing said partici
pating in a cross-town ROTC pro
gram did not limit her Stanford expe
rience.
"Everyone feels like they've
missed out on something here be
cause there's so much to do," Man
gosing said.
"But I've never been to a senior
pub night," she added.
