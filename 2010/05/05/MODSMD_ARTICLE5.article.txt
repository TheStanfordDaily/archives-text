# STUDENT GOV'T
## Senate fails to agree on end date 
### ZOE RICHARDS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The 11th ASSU Undergraduate
Senate will not dissolve on May 11,
leaving its transition date unclear
and some convinced that the rea
sons behind a delayed transition are
not what they seem.

That was the outcome of Tues
day's meeting, where senators also
rounded up remaining bills and dis
cussed how to effectively hand
down knowledge about Stanford's
student government to the senators
elect of the 12th incarnation of the
group, who will serve through next
spring.

Eleven senators were present at
last night's meeting. Three current
senators out of 13 reported to the
Senate's transition meeting with in
coming senators on Saturday.
According to some senators

elect eager to take their places, much
of the transition has not been as
helpful as promised.
"I personally feel that I've
learned very little in the past three
weeks," said Senator-elect Deepa
Kannappan 'l3.
Some on Tuesday remained con
cerned about the time left for in
coming senators to organize a policy
summit, as was done last spring, or at
least form committees and select
chairs before the year's end.
The dissolution bill, which would
have broken up the Senate on May
11, was defeated 7-4. The current
Senate will continue to convene
until a new dissolution date is
agreed upon.
Green Events Checklist
After seeing the Green Events
Checklist on and off the Senate's
agenda since September, the group

appears to be moving toward imple
menting a more effective pilot pro
gram to ensure that, through fund
ing controls, student events use sus
tainable materials.
Appropriations Chair Anton Zi
etsman 'l2 laid out a lengthy set of
mechanisms, including the use of
"green consultants," that could help
increase sustainability among stu
dent groups.
Senator Michael Cruz 'l2, who
coauthored the bill, will return as a
member of the 12th Senate and
could help newcomers move quick
ly on the checklist.
Questions Surround Transition
Meanwhile, after Senator Alex
Katz 'l2 time and again repeated a
host of seemingly pragmatic reasons
for a delayed transition, Senator
Mohammad Ali 'lO said Tuesday
that these reasons were mere "polit

ical theatre" to hide other motives
for a late start for the 12th Senate.

The importance of a well-in
formed transition for the incoming
Senate, and members of the Appro
priations Committee in particular,
along with a need to update the
body's bylaws, have been mainstay
justifications for Katz and other sen
ators for extending the process.
Ali said, however, that several
senators had told him they would
not support a bill he coauthored
with Senator Lee Jackson 'l2 calling
for the dissolution of the Senate
next week for fear of the incoming
Senate hearing a divestment bill be
fore the end of the quarter.
Fadi Quran 'lO, a member of
Campaign Restore Hope, appeared
on the Senate floor on Tuesday to
probe the Senate for answers about
why it is continuing to discuss the
year's long-running issues.
"I respect if you have an ideology,
Alex Katz, and I know a lot of your
friends who have very explicitly told
me you are a supporter of Israel "
Quran said before being sharply rep
rimanded by both Katz and Senate
Chair Varun Sivaram 'll for what
they called inappropriate remarks.
The campaign distributed divest
ment petitions to some dorms earlier
this week.
"For those who think the issue of
divestment will not come up if the
transition is delayed, you are wrong,"
Ali said.

Senator Zachary Warma 'll, who
called into the meeting via Skype
from Stanford in Washington, fiercely
disagreed.

"This has no place in student gov
ernment it has no place," Warma
said.

Katz and Zietsman left shortly be
fore the meeting ended.

Other Business
The Senate heard recommenda
tions from Katz before his departure
about a new "traditions fund" intend
ed to preserve traditional Stanford
events endangered by underfunding.
About $14,500 would be allotted to
the fund, with Mausoleum Party and
Full Moon on the Quad outlined as its

top priorities. An undesignated pot of
$2,500 would be set aside for addi
tional emergency expenses.
The ASSU political budget and
funding bills for the week were ap
proved.
According to the body's bylaws,
the 11th Senate must dissolve at least
14 days before the end of the quarter,
leaving its latest transition date to the
eighth week of the quarter during the
May 18 meeting.
