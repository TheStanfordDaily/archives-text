### ERIN INMAN 
Edward Perkins, former U.S. ambassador to
South Africa, spoke Tuesday on American foreign
policy and his memories of the demise of apartheid in
South Africa.
When the United States "could no longer sit on
the sidelines of the disintegration of the apartheid
system... President Reagan sent a black man to
South Africa to make a statement," Perkins said.
Reagan appointed Perkins as ambassador to South
Africa in 1986.
