## Perkins recalls '80s U.S.-South Africa relations 
### ERIN INMAN 
Edward Perkins, former U.S. ambassador to
South Africa, spoke Tuesday on American foreign
policy and his memories of the demise of apartheid in
South Africa.
When the United States "could no longer sit on
the sidelines of the disintegration of the apartheid
system... President Reagan sent a black man to
South Africa to make a statement," Perkins said.
Reagan appointed Perkins as ambassador to South
Africa in 1986.

Former U.S. ambassadorto South Africa Edward Perkins spoke on Tuesday about his overseas service
during the Reagan administration. "Foreign policy is your responsibility," Perkins told students.
His appointment was met with
controversy from all camps. President
Reagan advised him to acquire the
backing of prominent African Ameri
can leaders who saw Perkins' appoint
ment as simply a symbolic gesture by
the administration. In South Africa,
too, he was met with opposition from
the United Democratic Front.

Upon arriving in South Africa,
Perkins found a "totally segregated
society."
"Our embassy must be a giant
change agent," he said.
To announce the change in Ameri
can foreign policy toward South
Africa, Perkins attended the Delmas
treason trial; he was the first Ameri
can ambassador to appear in a South
African courtroom.
The defendants "decided what
they wanted me to do," Perkins said.
"They wanted someone from the
American embassy in the courtroom
every day" so that "South Africa
would know that the outside [world]
was watching," he said.
Exactly 11 anti-apartheid activists
were eventually convicted of treason;

their sentences were later overturned.
The U.S. Senate gave Perkins a
mandate to get Nelson Mandela out
of jail. "I don't know how they thought
I'd do that, but I set about it," Perkins
said.
Every month, Perkins attempted
to meet with Mandela in jail but was
denied permission by authorities.
Through a system of people acting as
"carrier pigeons," Perkins received
messages from Mandela, he said.
"'I know you're trying to get in to
see me,"' wrote Mandela, according to
Perkins. "'lt doesn't make any differ
ence to me whether you do or not, just
keep asking. The more you ask, the
more powerful it makes me,"'
Today, Perkins says, "the most im
portant thing is that we recognize that
we all the citizens across the world
were all prisoners along with Man
dela."
"Foreign policy is your responsibil
ity," Perkins said. "Every time you
walk the streets, oil is there, food is
there, water is there and an aspect of
conflict is there. Whatever the conflict
is, it will affect us."
For South Africa today, Perkins
cited crime, land distribution and
health-related issues as the country's
most pertinent internal conflicts.
Perkins also called diplomacy with
African countries one of the United

States' most significant challenges, cit
ing a need for diplomacy that does not
treat Africa as one entity.

Galen McNeil 'l2 attended for in
formation for her PWR class on glob
al leadership.

"I loved Perkins' statement that
America has to stop seeing Africa as a
unit and has to start seeing it has many
different countries because that's
something most people don't realize,"
McNeil said.

"We live in a multilevel world,"
Perkins said. "Management of for
eign policy is not only the responsi
bility of someone like me sitting in
Washington; it is your responsibility
and mine."
