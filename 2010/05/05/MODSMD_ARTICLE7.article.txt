## EAST to turn to ed. focus Some East Asian Studies theme alumni voice concerns 
### ELIZABETH ROSEN STAFF WRITER 
Next year, Treat House, known as
the East Asian Studies Theme
(EAST) house, will discontinue its
current academic-cultural focus and
become the Education and Society
Theme house. It has served as a hub
for focus on East Asian studies since
1982.
According to Residential Educa
tion (ResEd), the new theme will con
nect undergraduate students with vol
unteer student organizations, faculty
members and the School of Education.
In a statement announcing the
change, ResEd cited the School of Ed
ucation's new minor degree offering
as evidence of a growing interest in ed
ucation among undergraduates.
"The Education House at Stanford
envisions a living learning space that
serves students as a hub of activity
around student engagement in educa
tion," according to Res Ed.
The resident fellows in the 63-per
son house, education professors Chris
tine Min Wotipka and Anthony Lising
Antonio, echoed that interest in edu
cation has been on the rise, both aca
demically and through local tutoring,
counseling and test preparation.
"In all of that activity, we see an op
portunity to create a living-learning
space to connect these activities and
students together and foster a com
munity for deeper engagement and
opportunistic connection," the RFs
wrote in a joint e-mail to The Daily.
ResEd spokespeople were not
available for comment.
The change has been met with
some opposition by several house
alumni.
Todd Nelling 'OB, who lived in
EAST during his sophomore and sen
ior years, wrote in an e-mail to The
Daily that "surely there are other
[non-theme] dorms in less demand..
. why does it need to be EAST?"
Russell Chou 'l2, the residential
computer consultant at EAST and
the president of the anime and origa
mi clubs at Stanford, said EAST had
only three priority residents this year,
which he said may have influenced
the move to instate the education
theme.

A letter signed by 41 EAST alum
ni was nostalgic, expressing hope that
EAST will be remembered not only
as a center for debate and discussion
about East Asia, but also as a vibrant
and close-knit community that drew
students from a variety of back
grounds and disciplines.
"The language tables at dinners,
the student-led seminars, the trips to
Chinatown and Japantown, the week
long EASTfest and the other theme
related events ... created a commu
nity unified by a common interest,"
read the letter.
Zack Wood 'O7, a former academic
theme advisor in EAST, suggested a
number of alternative organizations
for current students interested in East
Asian studies, including the Asian
American Activities Center, the Cen
ter for East Asian Studies and Okada,
an ethnic theme house.
