# Banking on the future

£ £ "W" i not all crazy

% /% J Ryan Rosztoczy'l2. "It
\f \i kind of sucks to have
j everybody hate on you
every time someone asks me what I want to
do, I now have to start with a preliminary ethi
cal defense."
With the recent financial crisis and public
grilling of Goldman Sachs executives on na
tional television, investment bankers have be
come some of the most vilified people in Amer
ica.
"My friends laugh that I'm selling my soul
by going into investment banking," said
Cameron Mullen 'll. "Popular media makes it
seem like Wall Street is this terribly corrupt
place where everyone gets ridiculous bonuses."
Prospective bankers have definitely found
it increasingly difficult to defend this future
plan against the masses of social entrepre
neurs, pre-meds and environmental engineers
on campus. Has the alluring glow of Wall Street
finally faded?
"When times were flush, Stanford students
were as eager and diligent about beating down
the doors to investment banks as students any
where else," said law and business Prof. Robert
Daines. However, he feels that the enthusiasm
for Wall Street has tempered slightly, and per
haps for good reason.
"Fewer students right now are pursing these
jobs, but I think that is because jobs are scarce
and students are sensibly considering other op
tions," Daines said. "As a general rule, it's prob
ably good to have more people working in the
'real economy' making and selling stuff
than we've had in the past decade."
But for those who have found their calling
in investment banking, the ridicule, uncertain
ty and possibly reduced salaries do not serve as

deterrents. Motivations vary widely, but the
standard image of "doing it for the money"
doesn't seem to be as prevalent as many might
believe.

"I've been doing it every summer since
Stanford, and I really enjoy the fast-paced
lifestyle and getting involved in some of the
biggest transactions in the economy," Mullen
explained. "There is a lot of intellectual rigor
that goes underappreciated."
"You have to do it because you love it
the ones who think they're going to make a lot
of money, they'll last two years and leave,"
Rosztoczy agreed. "If I could do anything for
12 hours a day, it'd be finance I love it that
much."

Some have even been motivated to go into
finance by the mistakes, and subsequent possi
bilities, stemming from the crisis.
"As we've seen lately, the various profes
sions on Wall Street all wield great influence in
our economy," pointed out J.R. Riggs 'l2.
"Working there offers an opportunity to really
affect how our economic system functions,
which is an exciting possibility to me."
In fact, for current undergrads and recent
alumni, the crisis might even be beneficial in
terms of getting employment.
"Banks over-fired, so there's a staff short
age," Mullen said. "It'd be the beginning of a
new boom, with huge amounts of hiring."
Once he enters the field, Rosztoczy is also
eager to apply what he has learned while work
ing with the Blyth Fund, Stanford's undergrad
uate student-run portfolio of the University, as
well as the wide range of ethics and philosophy
courses that he has pursued at Stanford.
"How do we make things more transpar
ent?" he asked. "How can we shape public
opinion of bankers through our actions? What
can we do to prevent this from happening
again?" Such burning questions are what drive
Rosztoczy and many other Stanford students
to create change in the banking sector.

They think the first step is awareness. It
seems almost counterintuitive to be advocat
ing for people pulling six-figure incomes fresh
out of college, but those in the field are quick to
point out that there is more than meets the eye
when it comes to bankers.

"[The] current climate makes it very easy to
scapegoat investment banks for everything,"
Daines said.

"A lot of people who complain about fi
nance ... don't really understand the role of
banks and finance and how it helps the econo
my," said Alex Hoffer 'l3. "Without them, al
most all business in the U.S. would not be able
to function."

Furthermore, some seasoned interns argue
that investment bankers really don't make that
much money when you consider how much
time they put in. They say it's important to look
beyond that enormous starting salary.
"We're on call, just like doctors," Mullen
said. "Investment bankers wake up at 5 a.m.
and work till 10 p.m. We pull all-nighters and
we're always working, yet we make about
$11.25 per hour after taxes. That's less than the
hourly wage for a campus job at Stanford!"
For some, helping to improve bankers' pub
lic image is both an important and a seemingly
impossible task. The public simply does not
seem interested in understanding the complex
ities and differences in finance and the econo
my. But even if investment banking is no longer
the hottest post-collegiate career of the mo
ment, students like Riggs are undeterred.
"There is a popular stereotype out there
that the typical Wall Street banker is extreme
ly corrupt and doesn't care about anyone but
themselves," he admitted. "[But] at the end of
the day, I feel that how you carry yourself is
more important than how your profession is
perceived."
