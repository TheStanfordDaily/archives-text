## EDITORIAL A 						real living wage for Stanford workers 
### 
As students and members of the Stan
ford community, it is our responsibility
to help ensure that all members of this
community are treated with respect. Those
who work to provide us with daily basic and
essential services the custodial, dining and
maintenance workers of Stanford University
deserve our respect and appreciation for
what they contribute to our lives on campus.
As students and members of the community,
we must remain aware of and receptive to the
wage and cost-of-living issues that impact the
livelihoods of these individuals.
Since 2002, students and workers alike
have been campaigning and negotiating to
provide a living wage for all Stanford employ
ees. Much progress has since been made as a
result of student and worker efforts. However,
the current living wage policy does not cover
an overwhelming majority of campus work
ers. In 2007, the Living Wage Policy covered
less than 150 of the thousands of Stanford
workers. Currently, unionized workers remain
excluded from the policy, along with employ
ees of tenant businesses like the CoHo or Ar
buckle Caf?, as well as those who work at
SLAC and Stanford Hospital.
In 2003 and again in 2007, groups of stu
dents chose to fast in order to pressure the ad
ministration to administer a broader living
wage policy. After the demonstrations in 2003,
President Hennessy convened the Presiden
tial Committee on Labor Policies, which rec
ommended unanimously that ?if Stanford
says that it operates a ?living wage? policy, it
should do just that and not surround it with
conditions and qualifications that result in
only a few workers being covered by the poli
cy.? Students and workers organized and fast
ed in 2007 only after the committee?s recom
mendations were denied.

The current student-worker movement,
which organized a large rally at Hennessy?s

office last Friday, is gaining momentum, along
with an informational town hall series that has
engaged students from across campus on Uni
versity labor issues. A display in White Plaza
and a circulating petition are also helping to
inform more Stanford community members
of the Living Wage campaign and the issues at
hand.

We, the Editorial Board, believe that there
are changes to the current Living Wage Policy
which must be considered if the University is
serious about fulfilling the promises made to
the workers of Stanford. We believe a living
wage should be granted to all University work
ers for whom a living wage was promised. As
the campus has witnessed independent con
tractors continuing to pay University employ
ees less than living wages, it has become neces
sary to create an enforcement mechanism
which will correct any violations of Stanford?s
Living Wage Policy. As changes arise, students
and members of the Stanford community
should also be privy to any labor policy and
analysis put forth by the University.
In 2007, the Stanford Report noted that the
less than 150 workers who were covered by the
Living Wage Policy earned $12.59 an hour with
no benefits. It is hard to fathom supporting a
family in Santa Clara or San Mateo on rough
ly $25,000 a year with no health insurance or
other benefits. The Living Wage campaign is
not asking for an increase in worker wages
across the board, merely for the implementa
tion of a policy that would provide decent
wages for a majority of University workers.

The Editorial Board believes that a dia
logue regarding a more fair and inclusive Liv
ing Wage policy must be forged. Furthermore,
the dialogue must progress more rapidly and
achieve greater successes than previous nego
tiations, which after several years yielded few
improvements for the majority of Stanford
workers.
