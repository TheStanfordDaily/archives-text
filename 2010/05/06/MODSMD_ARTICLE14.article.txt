# ADVENTURES IN ACADEMIA
## Are students consumers of education? 
### Danny Crichton 
University Discounters the source for
all things higher education is a tremen
dous shopping experience for the stu
dent at heart. As you walk in, the first depart
ment, degrees, is teeming with choices. Al
though all roughly the same cost, each choice
belongs to a different food group. There are the
degrees in engineering, which are sort of like a
salad healthy and long lasting, but rather un
exciting. Then there are the degrees in the liber
al arts chocolates that taste great, but are less
filling in the long-term. Degrees in social science
are like a sandwich a happy medium.
After that department, we head on over to
the "experiences" department. Many destina
tions wait in the study abroad aisle, and there
are plenty of volunteering opportunities in the
service aisle. After this, is the extracurriculars
department, which spans multiple aisles from
sports to pre-professional clubs. Put all of these
into a nice shopping basket and go to the
cashier to check out; but warning, there are no
returns and no exchanges.
It is important to note though that cus
tomers should not expect any help in selection.
University Discounters does not provide per
sonal shopping assistants to its clientele
that would be a costly attack on the store's bot
tom line. Every person who walks into the
front door should know what they want, of
course, and the store conveniently places ex
pensive items at eye level.
While this extended metaphor was perhaps
hyperbole (and also allowed me to compare
the social sciences to sandwiches), it raises an
important question: what relationship do we,
as students attending universities in the 21st
century, hold with our institutions?
Thirty years ago, schools were clearly in con
trol of the curriculum, providing a pre-defined
experience for every student with little ability to
design programs of study. Students were for the
most part powerless, and tuition dollars were a
relatively small source of revenue, especially
considering the lower expenses of that era.
Today, the relationship has been reversed.
Tuition dollars are a critical source of revenue
for universities, which use them as unrestricted
funding to pay for administrative costs not cov
erable by endowment spending. Students now
have broad latitude over the design of their ma
jors and degree programs, even when those stu
dents are not sure what they will need someday.
Whether we like it or not, higher education
has moved closer to a consumer model, and we
need to be aware and address some of its un
derlying flaws.
First, there is an incredible pull among all
higher education institutions to connect learn
ing directly with the skills needed for the job
force. We are fortunate to be among the minor
ity of students who attend schools that have
largely ignored this trend. That is not the case
with most institutions, which are under pres
sure from career offices, alumni, students and

parents to ensure that the knowledge provided
is practical and directed toward the job a stu
dent intends to take upon graduation.
This nationwide trend creates two prob
lems: first, students often do not know where
they will be after graduation (and thus the job
training received may not be relevant) and sec
ond, whatever choice they do make is unlikely
to be the same in the long-term. Our genera
tion is fluidly moving between jobs in different
industries, and the skills needed for such flexi
bility do not come from practical programs di
rected at narrow industries.
There is a danger that American productiv
ity will be harmed if such a trend manifests it
self. Industries are constantly changing,
whether at the frenetic pace of the science and
technology industry or more slowly in con
struction. But all workers are constantly forced
to adapt to new changes in their work. To do so,
they will need the broad foundation provided
by a strong college curriculum to assist in the
transition process.
A second concern with the consumer
model is that every part of the student experi
ence must provide instant gratification. To a
certain degree, the demand for high quality
services has pushed the cost of education high
er. The funding for a gorgeous campus has to
come from somewhere.

The risk can also be seen in academics,
where there is a constant push to lower stan
dards. For instance, a professor was removed
last month from the introductory biology se
quence at Louisiana State University because
too few of her students were passing the course
requirements. The solution was to lower the
standards to ensure a healthy graduation (and
revenue) stream.
Practical training and instant gratification
did not make America the economic behe
moth it is today. The consumer model of high
er education is certainly not new, but as the de
mands on these institution increase, we risk de
stroying the very strengths that our system of
universities provide broadly educated
graduates. We cannot act as if universities are
Wal-Marts of knowledge, but instead we must
see them entirely in a different class, a breed to
be protected for eternity.
