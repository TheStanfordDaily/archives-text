# ALTERNATIVE LIVING... WITHOUT THE NAKED
## The 						Beauty In Good People

lam an unabashed aesthete, and nothing
has made this clearer than the arrival of
Spring. I indulge in blue skies, sundresses,
and my favorite patch of flowers by the cor
ner of Campus Drive and Mayfield. Last
night, climbing a fire escape, I sat on a step
and watched the giant moon rise, around it
pale clouds and a halo of light.
I am captivated by beauty, and so too, I be
lieve, is much of the world. We romanticize it,
we objectify humans and items as beautiful,
and regardless of our approach to beauty, one
thing is clear: we enjoy it.
And while we all have different prefer
ences, I also believe that we have a general
agreement as to what is beautiful. After all,
we can probably all concur that an air
brushed, photoshopped and bronzed Gisele
Bundchen is more beautiful than some regu
lar Jane in a ratty T-shirt at Walmart. And be
cause of this standard of beauty, because of
the social pressure to believe in this standard,
refraining from judging a book by its cover
becomes more difficult.

All this would just be observations if there
were no hard-hitting implications for the way
we situate ourselves relative to these judg
ments. Unfortunately, because of this high
pressured focus on aesthetics, problems arise
in how we view ourselves and how we want
others to view us physically. More often than
not, it becomes easy to aspire to these stan
dards of aesthetics, and see it as a bar to quan
tify our self-worth.
I was surprised by the emphasis on the
human aesthetic when I first came to Stan
ford. Despite my position as an aesthete, I
never found myself thinking much about how
I looked in the eyes of others. Part of this I at
tribute to being a heterosexual growing up in
a girls' school, where I was more preoccupied
with passing physics than charming girls.
Moreover, I was raised to conceptualize
beauty in a very different way, largely through
the admiration of beauty in art and literature

rather than in human beings. Granted, I did
have enduring crushes on random Irish boy
bands. Yet, translating the importance of
looks from the realm of celebrity worship to
my day-to-day living constantly escaped me.
Stanford cranked up the pressure. I was
suddenly confronted with people who
worked out obsessively, girls who spent hours
on their hair and face every day, guys that had
more hair products than my packrat of a
grandmother ... for the first time, I felt very
conscious about the way I looked.
The effect this had on me was not devas
tatingly unhealthy, but self-consciousness in
troduced pressures into my life that detracted
from other priorities. I began worrying about
how I looked partying on a Saturday night
rather than just going out and having fun. I
spent time wondering if my hair was straight
enough, if my belly was too big, or if my city
girl Oxfords were too formal for California.
Eventually, I came to the realization that
none of this was really important, at least not
important enough to merit unending worry
on my part. On my deathbed, I rationalized,
the battle between Oxfords and Uggs would
hardly matter. Likewise extrapolating this
notion to the concept of social interaction
if I hung out with my friends, I would do so be
cause I liked them as people and not as Aber
crombie models.
Yet, I could not get away from this idea of
beauty, away from the notion that some
thing mysterious and wonderful exists, giv
ing pleasure to the mind and senses. And if I
longed for it, and wanted to embody it, how

could I do so without thinking about my muf
fin-tops, dinosaur eyebags and other sup
posed faults?
Leaving freshman year behind made me
pursue all these ideas. I wanted greatly to be a
beautiful person, but in away that I felt was
worthwhile, such that I as a personality and
not as a face could embody the ideal. I began
enjoying making people happy. I stopped
having crushes on celebrities, even Irish ones.
And it has come to a point where I wake up in
the morning and I am wholly validated by the
knowledge that just by being who I am, I have
the power to make somebody just the tiniest
bit happier.
I wonder how many people feel beautiful
this way. I overhear all the time the comment
that men like dumb, hot ladies and that girls
like jacked dudes who are awful to everybody
around them. This strange notion that beauti
ful people can lack a likeable personality is
something I find hard to believe, and in the
long-run, cannot seem to hold true. While I
can occasionally be enamored by chiseled
jawlines, sun-kissed skin or dashing faces,
when I am, it lasts for about a couple of hours.
"Oh, okay," I say after the hours end, quite
like how one would expect Homer Simpson
to say, "Durrrrr."
If you think about it, what is in a body?
Fifty years and parts of us fall off, metabolism
goes down, everybody goes into an age crisis.
I believe that there needs to be a foundation
of a likeable personality to support any no
tion of beauty personalities genuine, love
ly and/or endearing, with characteristics that
endure over time. And if a once-shallow aes
thete like me can come to this conclusion, I
hope I am joining the ranks of many.

Sam points, laughs and gets bored of the cruel,
unkind and ugly... even the cruel, unkind and
ugly-shaped like Abercrombie models. Do
