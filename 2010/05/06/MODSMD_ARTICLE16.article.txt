# OP-ED: UNDERSTANDING DIVESTMENT
## 
### LINDA HESS Senior Lecturer Department of Religious Studies 
As a campaign begins at Stanford propos
ing divestment from selected companies as
sociated with military occupation and human
rights abuses in Israel-Palestine, Yishai
Kabakar of Stanford Israel Alliance seems to
be striking early to take control of the rhetor
ical ground where the debate will unfold.
In reading Mr. Kabaker's piece closely, I
will try to make two points. First, it does a dis
service to people of good will who care about
the Israeli-Palestinian conflict when it relent
lessly insists that the divestment discussion is
utterly dark, divisive, and destructive. This
view, which fills most of the article, attempts
to make the debate radioactive before it
starts, whereas I suggest that the debate can
be positive and fruitful. Second, the article
transitions to a place of common ground on
which those who want the welfare of both Is
raelis and Palestinians can meet. I commend
Mr. Kabaker and SI A for the excellent proj
ects described in the last few paragraphs.
The article begins with a cascade of neg
ative language regarding a divestment cam
paign at Stanford three years ago: "divisive
... damaging ... people ... alienated and disil
lusioned ... Interfaith dialogue ... deeply
shaken."

A recent debate on divestment in Berke
ley's ASUC Senate, we read, was "equally
traumatic," though "the bill at Berkeley was
also defeated." This seems to me an inade
quate representation of what happened at
Berkeley. The bill won a majority Senate
vote, was vetoed by the president, and fell
one vote short of the two-thirds majority
needed to override the veto. Speakers in
favor of the bill included such distinguished
Berkeley professors as Judith Butler and
Daniel Boyarin, as well as Hastings law pro
fessor George Bisharat and UN Special Rap
porteur on human rights Richard Falk. The
bill was endorsed by 100 UC faculty. Five
Nobel Peace Prize laureates - Desmond
Tutu, Shirin Ebadi, Mairead Maguire, Rigob
erta Menchu Turn, and Jody Williams - ex
pressed support in writing.

This and other evidence should make us
consider that something important and valu
able might have been taking place in that de

bate. But no, we continue to be deluged in the
language of dark catastrophe. A Chabad
rabbi paints the effort as "fight[ing] darkness
with darkness." There are dire predictions of
more negativity, damage, polarization, mak
ing "peace even more elusive" if talk of di
vestment (even on a relatively symbolic
level) continues.
Particularly interesting is this: "In the past
divestment campaigns helped combat
apartheid in Africa and genocide in Darfur.
However, the divestment campaign against
Israel is a crass bludgeon, which reduces an
incredibly complex situation to euphemisms
and demonizations."
Divestment was good for South Africa
and Darfur but it is wrong and crass for Is
rael. Why is that?
Finally, I know one of the leaders in the ef
fort to put divestment on the table in Stan
ford's Undergraduate Senate. Fadi Quran,
the only student presently at Stanford who
actually lives in the Palestinian territories,
participated in a Stanford overseas seminar
in India on Gandhi's legacy, which was led by
Prof. Clayborne Carson and me. Fadi's lan
guage and tactics are very far from being di
visive, polarizing, or negative. He is making

enormous efforts in the opposite direction,
reaching out in respectful and loving terms to
those who disagree with him, affirming the
primacy of love as defined by Gandhi and
King, linked to a total commitment to nonvi
olence, along with the courage to struggle for
justice and peace against great odds.
So who is polarizing? Where is the dark
ness coming from?
I fully agree with Yishai Kabaker's state
ment that "the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is
deep, complex, and painful," and with his
support for an independent Palestinian state
alongside the state of Israel. I deeply appre
ciate the Stanford Israel Alliance's involve
ment in positive work to build desperately
needed infrastructure and connections be
tween Israeli and Palestinian "businessmen,
environmentalists, and civil leaders to forge
common frameworks between the two peo
ples."
May peace and mutual understanding
come to the region.
