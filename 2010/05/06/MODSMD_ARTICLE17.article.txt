## My NBA cheering dilemma 
### Zach Zimmerman Dishing the Rock 
I don't know whether I should feel
proud or ashamed for waiting
this long to write a column about
the NBA Playoffs. We're now in
the middle of the second round,
and things are looking pretty good
from this guy's perspective. My Orlan
do Magic finished the first round with
a nice little sweep of the Charlotte
Bobcats, and there's not a whole lot to
complain about. The matchups are as
intriguing as ever, and the NBA's
dream matchup of Kobe vs. Leßron is
still plausible, meaning that it won't be
long until our brains are saturated
with puppets.
I promise I won't waste this space
discussing how Orlando is about to ab
solutely dismantle the Atlanta Hawks
because, well, it's just inevitable. With
Game 1 in the books a 114-71 shel
lacking in the shadows of Disney
World I'm fairly confident that my
boys will make it to the Eastern Con
ference Finals. Thus, instead of pre
dicting the outcome of the Playoffs, I
want to present you with a moral
dilemma, an issue that I currently have
no resolution for and one that you can
hopefully relate to.
If all goes well which it will, or
else Earth will be swallowed by a giant
black hole as hell simultaneously
freezes over Orlando is set to face
the winner of the Boston Celtics-
Cleveland Cavaliers series.
It's important to note that I really,
really dislike the Cavs. As much as
the majority of "basketball Ameri
ca" would disagree with me, this is an
incredibly overhyped team that is in
adequately coached, poorly built and
whose success is completely depend
ent on the performance of a single
player. Most annoyingly, there's no
such thing as a Cavs fan; Quicken
Loans Arena is filled with Leßron
fans. For all of these reasons, the Le-
Brons get the silver medal on the list
of my least favorite professional
franchises.
But Cleveland is a distant second
on this list to my least favorite team in
the world, the bane of my existence,
the Boston Celtics. There is not a sin
gle thing I have ever enjoyed about
this team, its upper management or
the city of Boston itself (from a sports
perspective keep your pants on,
Revolutionary War nerdlingers).
Offer me two tickets to Game 7 of the
NBA Finals, and in 29 out of 30 sce
narios, I would say yes without blink
ing. The exception would be if the
game were at the Boston Garden, at
which point I would shred the tickets
and choose instead to lie on a bed of
nails.
By now, you hopefully understand
my stance on this series. I want both
teams to lose in embarrassing, train
wreck fashion. But herein lies the
problem that is impossible! So here
is where the aforementioned moral
dilemma comes into play. It's Mon
day night, Game 2 of the series. After
coming from behind to snatch the first
meeting, the Cavs were sitting pretty
with a 1-0 series lead. I intended to ap
proach Game 2 as an objective basket
ball fan, but obviously failed. During
the second quarter, as the Celtics
steadily increased the lead, I caught
myself giving a little Tigeresque fist
pump when Boston point guard
Rajon Rondo dished one of his 19 as
sists to an open Garnett under the bas
ket.
No big deal, right? You bet your
sweet ass this is a big deal. A fist pump
for Rondo is equivalent to a chest
bump with Satan. It just felt dirty.
Did I understand why it hap
pened? Of course. As much as I'd love
the Magic to send Leßron home
again, I'd rather not see him in the
Conference Finals. Boston is old and
deteriorating, and although they have
given Orlando fits since I started walk
ing, the Celtics would undoubtedly be
the better matchup for the Magic.
But still, I feel like I should draw a
line somewhere. Should a Yankees fan
ever pull for the Red Sox? Would you
ever jump on the Cal bandwagon?
Would Cain ever fist pump for Abel?
It's been bothering me for days, yet
I still have no answer. My heart is
telling me, "Don't be such a wimp,
dude, the Magic will roll over either
team," while my heart says, "If we have
