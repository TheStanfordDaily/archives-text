# FINAL FOUR
## 
### CHRIS JUHNKE DESK EDITOR 
The No. 1 Stanford men's volleyball team
has already made one of the most impressive
turnarounds in collegiate volleyball history.
The Cardinal has won the MPSF merely three
years after finishing tied for last in the confer
ence and is in the four-team NCAA Tourna
ment at Maples Pavilion with the national
championship game in its sights.
First though, Stanford must contend with a
formidable opponent tonight in the Ohio
State Buckeyes, champions of the Midwestern
Intercollegiate Volleyball Association. The
Buckeyes finished the season with a 22-7 over
all record and are currently on a 12-match win
ning streak. Ohio State has the No. 4 seed in
the tournament, but provides a somewhat un
predictable matchup for the Card. Although
the two teams haven't played this season,
Stanford is doing all it can to be ready for the
Buckeyes.
"We are excited about playing Ohio State,"
said senior setter and All-American Kawika
Shoji. "They are an unfamiliar opponent, so
we are watching a lot of video in preparation.
We will have a good scouting report come
Thursday."
"Ohio State is a great team and we know
we will have to prepare as best as we can,"
echoed sophomore libero and fellow Ail-
American Erik Shoji. "We plan on watching as
much film as we can on them trying to famil
iarize ourselves with them. This is about exe
cuting a game plan and trying to play our game
as best as we can."
However, no matter how prepared the Car
dinal is, it will likely find itself in a challenging
match with a talented team. Ohio State boasts
two Second Team All-Americans, sophomore
opposite hitter Shawn Sangrey, who leads the
team with 4.75 kills per set, and junior setter
Steven Kehoe, who is averaging 13.4 assists
per set.
Fortunately, besides being the No. 1 team in

the country, Stanford has a few things in its
favor. First, the team has history on its side, as
it has never lost to Ohio State, accumulating
an 8-0 record against the Buckeyes historical
ly. Second, the Cardinal is lucky enough to be
able to play in front of its home crowd with the
Final Four being played at Maples Pavilion.
This is especially beneficial for Stanford,
whose often-costumed fans have helped the
team go 13-1 at Maples Pavilion this year.
"It is awesome to be playing in the Final
Four at home," Erik Shoji said. "It will be spe
cial to be playing in such a great environment
and even more special to be able to play in
front of the home crowd."
"We have the best home crowd in the

world," added junior outside hitter Spencer
McLachlin.

The Cardinal's final advantage lies in the
experience it has gained this season playing in
the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation
(MPSF), the toughest conference in the coun
try. The Cardinal has played and beaten
several of the top-ranked teams in the nation
and finished its excellent season by winning
the super-competitive MPSF Tournament.

"We are a mature, battle-tested team,"
Kawika Shoji said. "The MPSF Tourney is the
most difficult tournament to win in college
volleyball, so we are ready for our next chal
lenge, Plus, the tournament is at Stanford."
With all of the excitement and expectations

involved, the team is remaining calm and fo
cused on its goal. Led by four All-Americans
sophomore outside hitter Brad Lawson
and the Shoji brothers were named to the First
Team, while senior opposite Evan Romero
was named to the Second Team and MPSF
Coach of the Year John Kosty, Stanford is
looking to claim only the second NCAA
championship in the program's history. The
Cardinal's last championship was in 1997 at
Ohio State. This is Stanford's first NCAA
Tournament appearance since that season.

Sophomore outside hitter Brad Lawson and the No. 1 seed Stanford men's volleyball team look to continue their postseason success as they take
on No. 4 seed Ohio State tonight. The Cardinal is competing in the NCAA Tournament for the first time since 1997, when it won the national title.
"It always helps to have a crowd
there supporting you ... and dish
ing out some comical remarks to no
one in particular. And the fact that
we don't have to travel to the East
Coast is awesome."

The play-in game starts Saturday
at 1 p.m. If Stanford wins, it will au
tomatically advance to the NCAA
Tournament and will find out its
spot in the 16-team field during the
selection show on Sunday.
