## Kawika Shoji named National Player of the Year 
### â€” Jacob Jaffe 
Senior setter Kawika Shoji was
named Division I II National
Player of the Year by the Ameri
can Volleyball Coaches Associa
tion (AVCA) yesterday at the
NCAA Men's Volleyball Champi
onship Banquet.
"I was surprised," Shoji told
GoStanford.com. "I haven't been
too focused on individual awards.
We're just focused on Ohio State.
The whole year we've been talking
about our team goals. To be hon
est, that is all that matters. I
thought about this for 30 seconds
and it's already on to my assign
ments for Ohio State."
Shoji was a leader on the Stan
ford men's volleyball team, which
improved from a 3-25 finish in his
freshman season to the No. 1 seed
in the NCAA Tournament this
year. He averaged 13.78 assists
and 2.46 digs per set, which were
both among the nation's best. As a
setter, Shoji was instrumental in
helping the Cardinal lead the na
tion in hitting at .352 for the sea
son.
"It's a great, great honor," he
said. "I am very proud. I have to
thank my coaches and especially
my teammates. It's a team game,
and individual awards come with
team accolades. I'm just excited
they pass me the ball, and I deliver
the ball to other players. They
make plays too. Without our team,
this award would not have hap
pened."
Over his four years at Stanford,
Shoji was an All-American three
times and All-MPSF all four years.
He has totaled 4,376 assists, 796
digs, 452 kills and 104 aces in his
career so far.
Shoji was given the award by
former Stanford All-American
and 2008 Olympic gold medalist
Kevin Hansen, who is also a setter.
"He's been the leader of this
team " Hansen said "AriH tn see

"He's been the leader of this
team," Hansen said. "And to see
[the team] rise to achieve what it has
says a lot about his character. He's
obviously one of the best setters to
come out of this program. And he's
got a lot of volleyball left to play."
Shoji is the second National Play
er of the Year from Stanford and the
first since Canyon Ceman in 1993.
"It's an honor for the program,"
said head coach John Kosty. "I look at
Kawika winning as, he's the setter
and our team captain and leader, but
he also represents our team. It is a
team award. There are a lot of people
who have helped him achieve what
he's achieved."
This weekend, Shoji and his team
mates will look to capture the one
award that has eluded them thus far,
a national championship.
