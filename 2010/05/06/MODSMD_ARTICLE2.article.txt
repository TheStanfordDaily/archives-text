## New graduate council wraps funding bylaws 
### BRIANNA PANG STAFF WRITER 
The first meeting of the new Graduate
Student Council (GSC) kicked off Wednes
day evening with voting on funding commit
tee bylaw updates and the filling of more of
ficer positions.
After seeing the latest changes to fund
ing committee bylaw updates, GSC mem
bers passed the new bylaws 13-0. The 2009-
10 GSC debated bylaw changes extensively
during the past three weeks, producing the
final product that was presented and ap
proved yesterday evening.
The updates include: a classification of
fundraisers as normal events rather than
community service; new spending caps on
food per student; and a more thorough out
line of what the funding committee plans to
fund for student groups.

Academic seminars not of "broad inter
est" will not be covered by the GSC, but
redirected to academic departments.
Funding Committee Chair Krystal St.
Julien, a graduate student in biochemistry,
said the list of changes was also e-mailed to
student group financial officers and presi
dents. However, no one responded to her e
mail with questions or concerns.
"I got zero feedback," St. Julien said.
The final copy of the new bylaws
will be posted on the GSC website
for students to view.

School of Law representative
Evan Berquist, a law student, was
sworn in, filling the last voting mem
ber spot on the council.
Berquist was also considered for
the position of parliamentarian,
though deciding not to commit until
he understood the job responsibili
ties. Additionally, Xi Cheng, a first
year graduate student in mechanical
engineering, was selected as web
master for the upcoming year.
St. Julien chose Erik Lehnert, a
third-year graduate student in genet

ics, as the deputy funding committee
chair. The deputy chair traditionally
becomes the chair of the committee
in the subsequent year.
The positions of equipment mas
ter, funding committee auditor, fam
ily issues advocacy committee chair
and stipends advocacy committee
chair have yet to be filled.

Council members also debated
how best to publicize events to grad
uate students after falling 300 tickets
short for graduate formal. Seven
hundred students have signed up for
the formal, scheduled for this Satur
day.

The council considered the idea
of creating an all-graduate student e
mail list, but Adam Beberg, a doctor
al candidate in computer science,
spot down the proposal, claiming
there was already such a list in exis
tence, though it is not used for event

announcements.

The graduate events announce
ment list does not include some stu
dent group leaders, according to St.
Julien.

Council co-chair Jessica Tsai, a
medical student and graduate stu
dent in neuroscience, suggested that
the ASSU executives blast an e-mail
to the lists they controlled.

ASSU Vice President Kelsei
Wharton 'l2 explained that execu
tives could only send out e-mails to
the general student body list once
every two weeks. He would have had
to announce the graduate formal
when the last e-mail was sent ap
proximately a week ago.
Wharton also provided an ASSU
update, explaining that he and ASSU
President Angelina Cardona 'll
were still in the process of doing ex
ecutive cabinet interviews.

Members also told co-chairs Tsai
and Justin Brown, a graduate student
in geophysics, of their summer plans
whether they will be on campus,
off campus or a combination. The
time commitment will not be large.
Brown said, explaining that summer
meetings "go quickly."
"I've literally been to meetings
that lasted only seven minutes,"
Brown said.

Off-campus members plan to find
proxies for meetings they will not be
able to attend.

GSC members approved $4OO for
a Graduate Student Programming
Board (GSPB) trivia night from line
item funding. Council members also
confirmed $B5O for the Stanford
India Association.
