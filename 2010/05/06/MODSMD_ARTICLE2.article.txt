## New graduate council wraps funding bylaws 
### BRIANNA PANG STAFF WRITER 
The first meeting of the new Graduate
Student Council (GSC) kicked off Wednes
day evening with voting on funding commit
tee bylaw updates and the filling of more of
ficer positions.
After seeing the latest changes to fund
ing committee bylaw updates, GSC mem
bers passed the new bylaws 13-0. The 2009-
10 GSC debated bylaw changes extensively
during the past three weeks, producing the
final product that was presented and ap
proved yesterday evening.
The updates include: a classification of
fundraisers as normal events rather than
community service; new spending caps on
food per student; and a more thorough out
line of what the funding committee plans to
fund for student groups.

Academic seminars not of "broad inter
est" will not be covered by the GSC, but
redirected to academic departments.
Funding Committee Chair Krystal St.
Julien, a graduate student in biochemistry,
said the list of changes was also e-mailed to
student group financial officers and presi
dents. However, no one responded to her e
mail with questions or concerns.
"I got zero feedback," St. Julien said.
