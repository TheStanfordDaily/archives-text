# PLAYING IN NCAAs
## 
### CHRIS JUHNKE DESK EDITOR 
The No. 15 Stanford women's
lacrosse team had a successful week
end at the Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation (MPSF) Tournament,
beating host Denver in the title
game, and now returns back home

for the NCAA play-in game against
Massachusetts at Laird Q. Cagan
Stadium.
In Denver, the Cardinal excelled,
beating No. 7 seed Fresno State in the
first round of the MPSF Tournament
16-1. Stanford controlled the game
from the get-go, with junior midfield
er Lauren Schmidt's goal 57 seconds

into the game. The Cardinal contin
ued to dominate for the rest of the
half, scoring 12 goals in the half to
take a 12-1 lead at halftime. Senior
Dana Lindsay led the team with five
goals, and junior goalie Annie Read
made 10 saves in the win.
In the semifinals of the tourna
ment, the Cardinal faced California,
pulling out a hard-fought win over
the Bears. Stanford performed well
in the game, recording 43 shots, but
had difficulty getting past Cal goalie
Allie Shropshire, recording only nine
goals in the match. Fortunately, it was
enough, as the Cardinal won the
match 9-7, outlasting the Bears to ad
vance to the tournament final against
No. 1 seed Denver, the only team to
have defeated Stanford in confer
ence play this season.
"We knew we needed to come out
strong against Denver in the champi
onship game," said senior midfielder
Julie Christy. "We wanted to domi
nate draw controls and take smart
shots against their goalie. If we had
possession of the ball, then Denver
wouldn't be able to score so posses
sion starts right from the opening
draw control. Once we had the ball,
then it was our opportunity to score
and take the lead. We also had a lot
more confidence going into the
championship game than earlier this
month."
Stanford started out strong in the
match, outscoring Denver to take a
4-2 lead into halftime. The Pioneers
battled back, however, forcing over
time as the game ended in a tie at
nine. The Cardinal's future looked
bleak when just over halfway
through the overtime period, Denver
put in a goal to go up by one. Howev
er, Stanford refused to go away and
Schmidt scored with 28 seconds left
to force a sudden-death second over
time. This OT was even more exciting
than the first one, with junior mid
fielder Karen Nesbitt scoring the
winning goal with a mere five sec
onds left on the clock.

With the win, the Cardinal
claimed its sixth straight conference
title and advanced to the NCAA
Tournament play-in game.

"Advancing to the NCAAs is an
amazing feeling," Nesbitt said. "Not
only do we get the chance to repre
sent Stanford and the West Coast,
but we get to show the country how
bomb Stanford lacrosse is and that
we will not be denied."
"The team is so excited to have
the opportunity to compete for an
automatic bid to the NCAA Tourna
ment," said sophomore defender
Catherine Swanson. "We are trying
to make a statement that West Coast
lacrosse is strong."

Stanford will have the chance to
make such a statement this weekend
as it faces the Minutewomen of
Massachusetts with both teams' sea
sons on the line. Although Massa
chusetts advanced to the play-in
game by winning the Atlantic-10
Tournament, the Minutewomen are
not ranked and have a 10-9 record on
the season.

While past meetings cannot be
analyzed, as the two teams have
never played one another, favoring
the Cardinal is the fact that the play
in game will be played at home, this
weekend at Laird Q. Cagan Stadium.
Stanford is 8-1 at home this season,
and its victories include impressive
wins over ranked teams Ohio State
and Hofstra.
"It's an unbelievable feeling play
ing in front of our home crowd, and I
love Maloney [Field]," Nesbitt said.
