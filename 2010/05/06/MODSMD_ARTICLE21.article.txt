## 
### JENNY PETER STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford women's golf team is looking to secure
its national championship berth at the NCAA West Re
gional on the Stanford Golf Course today through Sat
urday.
The Cardinal must finish in the top eight of the 24
teams at its regional to gain passage to the NCAA Na
tional Championships, held May 18-21 in Wilmington,
N.C.The top two individuals not on an advancing team
will also proceed to the championships. The expected
top teams at the Cardinal's regional in order of seeding
are nationally ranked No. 1 UCLA, Alabama, Pac-10
champion Arizona, Ohio State and Virginia. Stanford
has the No. 6 seed and is followed by LSU and Califor
nia. Other teams joining the Cardinal at its home course
are Arkansas, Colorado State, Idaho, lowa State, Mary
land, Oral Roberts, Penn, Portland State, San Francisco,
San Jose State, Texas, Texas A&M, Texas State, UC-
Davis, UC-Irvine and UNLV.
Other teams were placed by ranking at two other re
gional sites and will also be fighting to finish in the top
eight in order to advance to the NCAA National
Championships. Duke is seeded No. 1 at the East Re
gional, which is hosted by East Carolina at the Iron
wood Country Club in Greenville, N.C. Arizona State
claimed the top seed at the Central Regional being held
at Otter Creek Gold Course in Columbus, Ind. In all,
126 out of 369 players will advance to the championship
competition after the three regional tournaments con
clude this weekend.
Participants will play 54 holes at the Stanford Golf
Course at a par of 71. The event will begin each day at 8
a.m. at holes one and 10. Stanford's tee time is 9 a.m.
from hole 10 on Thursday and 1:30 p.m. from hole one
on Friday. Saturday's tee time is yet to be determined.
"The course is in great shape," said junior Rebecca
Durham. "The greens are rolling nice, the rough is thick
and fairways are perfect. It's going to play tough, but fair."
Stanford made its last qualified appearance at
NCAA Championships in 2007, when the women fin
ished fifth in the nation at Daytona Beach,Fla.The Car
dinal fell just short of a national championship berth in
2008 when it finished tied for eighth place and lost in a
three-team playoff with UC-Davis and Ohio State. The
women finished 14th at last year's regional, making the
team even more eager to prove it is a top team at this
year's event.
"Rankings aside, we are a good team with the home
course advantage," Durham said. "We play well on the
Stanford course and are ready to go low."
Fans can expect an entertaining event with a lot of
good, highly competitive golf.
"These are some of the best teams in the country
and the competition will be intense," Durham said.
"How teams play this week determines whether their
season continues or not. Everyone wants to go to na
tionals."
The event is open to the public. Parking is available
on a first come, first served basis at the golf course and
near the Stanford stables.
