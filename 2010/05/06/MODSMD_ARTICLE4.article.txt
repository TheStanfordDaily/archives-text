# Music hall strikes new notes
## Groundbreaking date set for concert hall, a part of new arts initiative 
### KATHLEEN CHAYKOWSKI STAFF WRITER 
The groundbreaking date has been set for
the University's new Bing Concert Hall, a
building that has been in the planning stage
for more than a decade and represents part of
a larger effort at Stanford to revive the arts, an
area sometimes overshadowed by the Uni
versity's more technical and scientific focus.
"Our concert hall is really meant to be a
beacon," said University architect David
Lenox at a Wednesday evening showing of
the concert hall plans.
"It's meant to be very transparent," he
added metaphorically as he projected a visu
al rendering of what will be the glowing, glass
walled lobby of Bing Concert Hall. "We want
everyone to be welcome."

Lenox and other members of the core
planning team, including Jennifer Bilfield,
Maggie Burgett, Chris Chafe, Karen Nagy
and Stephen Sano, who represent groups such

as the Stanford Music Department and Stan
ford Lively Arts, were on hand Wednesday
for a public glimpse of the plans and construc
tion site.

According to Bilfield, the artistic and ex
ecutive director of Lively Arts, the plans are
"pretty finalized" and the planning team re
cently submitted a plan to Santa Clara Coun
ty for approval. However, Bilfield said the
structural design may be modified over the
next year and a half, as further technology
evolves on building in seismic zones.
"There haven't been any serious impasses,
because communication has been really
good," Bilfield said. "We've been meeting
every Thursday for three and a half years, and
many Wednesdays as well. So there is a cer
tain rhythm and tempo."
The 112,000-square-foot hall will be con
structed at the end of Museum Way, deliber
ately located along the same axis as the Can
tor Arts Center in what Lenox described as
the "arts district," the region in which Stan

ford's arts education and performance spaces
reside.

Full-size orchestras, chamber groups and
the most advanced electronic and computer
music from both within and outside Stanford
will use the 844-seat, vineyard-style hall, plan
ners said.

The acoustical design is meant to accom
modate both unamplified and computer
music performances. For example, the sails in
the hall will double not only as acoustical pan
els, but also as projection screens that will
complement computer music.
The state-of-the-art performance facility
is scheduled to be completed in the summer
of 2012, with its first public performances ex
pected to take place in January of 2013.
Music faculty and administrators have
been discussing the construction of a new hall
for nearly 15 years.
"For students who come here to play in or
chestra, for us to teach them what fine ensem
ble means that's really something we can't

do right now," Sano, a music professor, said.
Helen Bing and Peter Bing '55 made the
naming donation of the hall. The hall was de
signed by Polshek Parternship Architects, and
the acoustics were designed by Nagata Toy
ota, designer of the Walt Disney Concert Hall
in Los Angeles.
According to Lenox, after seeing the less
than-desirable results of failing to include a
sound system in the initial design of Disney
Hall, Toyota anticipated for more electronic
and technological needs in Stanford's per
formance space.
The design process was finely detailed. In
planning the acoustics, the core planning
team measured noise levels on the site with
an acoustician on football game days and
when a plane was flying over the site. Particu
lar thoughtfulness was devoted to the design
of the women's restroom, and the core team
visited performance venues around the na-
