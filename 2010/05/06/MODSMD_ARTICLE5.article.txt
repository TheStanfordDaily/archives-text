## Experts consider film identity Panelists discuss post-9/11 Muslim identity through Bollywood film, 'My Name is Khan' 
### MIKE DING SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Panelists from three California universities discussed
various interpretations of post-9/11 Muslim identity in a dis
cussion framed around the popular and recently released
Bollywood film "My Name is Khan."
The Abbasi Program in Islamic Studies held the panel
last night in Cubberley Auditorium to discuss the relation
ship between cinematic cultures, religious actions and iden
tity. Entitled "Naming the Muslim: Cinema and its Reli
gions," the panel featured Priya Jaikumar, associate profes
sor of cinematic arts at the University of Southern Califor
nia; Aishwary Kumar, assistant professor of modern South
Asian history at Stanford; and Saba Mahmood, associate
professor of cultural anthropology at UC-Berkeley.
"My Name is Khan," which was released this year, de
picts the travails of an autistic Muslim man named Rizwan
Khan in post-9/11 America. His family is shattered by prej
udice toward Muslims, so he decides to embark on a quest
to tell the President of the United States that his name is
Khan and he is not a terrorist.

Abbasi Program Director Shahzad Bashir prefaced the
panelists' discussion by providing a brief overview of the
film's focal point.

"The critical statement throughout this film is, 'My name
is Khan and I'm not a terrorist,'" Bashir said. "One way to

explain what happens is to take apart that statement. There
are two parts: My name is Khan, a question of Muslim iden
tity; and there's the question of action, I am not a terrorist.
This is a negation of guilt by association. That's the most ob
vious part of the film."

"But when we try to see what happens in the film, based
on the things he does, if being Muslim is not about being a
terrorist, then what is it about?" she asked.
Jaikumar said one aspect distinguishing "My Name is
Khan" from other Indian films is its departure from the use
of India as a backdrop against which discussions of religious
difference are contextualized.

"India as a primary axis against which religion is defined
disappears," she said. "The Indian nation state disappears,
but what is it replaced by? I have some suggestions. One
could argue it is replaced by a more implicit India, which is
portrayed by Khan's way of looking at the world. Looking
at the world in a new way is a thing the film insists Khan can
do for the rest of the world."

Kumar said the decision to make the protagonist of the
film autistic renders him pre-political in away, since he is
completely impervious to indoctrination by social pressures.
Kumar said this trope, combined with Khan's tendency to
inflict suffering on himself throughout the film, at first sug
gests a Gandhian interpretation of the character, though this
interpretation ultimately falls short.

"Despite the fact that Khan evokes Gandhian principles,
he balks in one very significant way," he said. "When Gand
hi was charged with sedition at the end of the World War I,
one of the things he did was to question the legitimacy of the

court. He said the British had no right
to try him. Khan is not given that
choice. He never becomes fully capa
ble of questioning the legitimacy of
the court or the imperial sovereign
power, in this case embodied by the
United States. In the end, his very self
hood as a Muslim [is] grounded in an
idea that is dictated by the sovereign
empire."

Mahmood said the decision to
make Khan autistic reminded her of
certain phenomena in films about
African Americans before the 19505.
Mahmood said such films generally
portrayed African Americans as
stammering and emotionally inept. In
the same way, "My Name is Khan"
portrays the Muslim protagonist with
a childlike innocence.

"Khan's ability to redeem himself
precisely lies in his emotional inepti
tude," she said.
"The message seems to be that no
Muslim man can really quite redeem
himself or redeem Islam unless he is
mentally and emotionally challenged,
and insofar as he is challenged he is
therefore innocent," she added.

Yet Mahmood said that there is a
political message behind the film, as
evidenced by the scene in which Khan
reports a group of Muslim men to the
FBI.

"Khan goes from pre-political to
being extremely political, in handing
over fellow Muslims, which becomes
his own story of redemption from tor
ture by the United States govern
ment," she said. "So I think I would say
that he does not secede from politics
he represents politics of a particu
lar kind."

Students at the talk found the pan
elists' discussion to be engaging, offer
ing some unexpected points of view.
Elahe Popat is a freshman in a
PWR course about the rhetoric of
India and Indian cinema. She said she
was interested in the panel because of
her own Muslim identity.
"I found most striking the com
mentary on the portrayal of a 'good
Muslim' and the comparison in the
film of'good' and 'bad' Muslims," she
said. "As this is a central theme in the
film, [one of the panelists'] interpreta
tion was unique in that it mentioned
that the film depicted it necessary for
a 'good Muslim man' to be mentally
handicapped. Although I didn't al
ways agree, it was a striking interpre
tation."

"I found most striking the com
mentary on the portrayal of a 'good
Muslim' and the comparison in the
film of'good' and 'bad' Muslims," she

tion was unique in that it mentioned
that the film depicted it necessary for
a 'good Muslim man' to be mentally
handicapped. Although I didn't al
ways agree, it was a striking interpre
tation."
