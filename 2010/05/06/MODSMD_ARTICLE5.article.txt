## Experts consider film identity Panelists discuss post-9/11 Muslim identity through Bollywood film, 'My Name is Khan' 
### MIKE DING SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Panelists from three California universities discussed
various interpretations of post-9/11 Muslim identity in a dis
cussion framed around the popular and recently released
Bollywood film "My Name is Khan."
The Abbasi Program in Islamic Studies held the panel
last night in Cubberley Auditorium to discuss the relation
ship between cinematic cultures, religious actions and iden
tity. Entitled "Naming the Muslim: Cinema and its Reli
gions," the panel featured Priya Jaikumar, associate profes
sor of cinematic arts at the University of Southern Califor
nia; Aishwary Kumar, assistant professor of modern South
Asian history at Stanford; and Saba Mahmood, associate
professor of cultural anthropology at UC-Berkeley.
"My Name is Khan," which was released this year, de
picts the travails of an autistic Muslim man named Rizwan
Khan in post-9/11 America. His family is shattered by prej
udice toward Muslims, so he decides to embark on a quest
to tell the President of the United States that his name is
Khan and he is not a terrorist.

Abbasi Program Director Shahzad Bashir prefaced the
panelists' discussion by providing a brief overview of the
film's focal point.

"The critical statement throughout this film is, 'My name
is Khan and I'm not a terrorist,'" Bashir said. "One way to

explain what happens is to take apart that statement. There
are two parts: My name is Khan, a question of Muslim iden
tity; and there's the question of action, I am not a terrorist.
This is a negation of guilt by association. That's the most ob
vious part of the film."

"But when we try to see what happens in the film, based
on the things he does, if being Muslim is not about being a
terrorist, then what is it about?" she asked.
Jaikumar said one aspect distinguishing "My Name is
Khan" from other Indian films is its departure from the use
of India as a backdrop against which discussions of religious
difference are contextualized.

"India as a primary axis against which religion is defined
disappears," she said. "The Indian nation state disappears,
but what is it replaced by? I have some suggestions. One
could argue it is replaced by a more implicit India, which is
portrayed by Khan's way of looking at the world. Looking
at the world in a new way is a thing the film insists Khan can
do for the rest of the world."

Kumar said the decision to make the protagonist of the
film autistic renders him pre-political in away, since he is
completely impervious to indoctrination by social pressures.
Kumar said this trope, combined with Khan's tendency to
inflict suffering on himself throughout the film, at first sug
gests a Gandhian interpretation of the character, though this
interpretation ultimately falls short.

"Despite the fact that Khan evokes Gandhian principles,
he balks in one very significant way," he said. "When Gand
hi was charged with sedition at the end of the World War I,
one of the things he did was to question the legitimacy of the
