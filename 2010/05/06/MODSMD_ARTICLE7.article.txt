l% iW uy rico, no?"
I / I my host moth
/ I ei Rosalia asks
I I as she stirs a
j pot of
sopa de lentejas con chorizo, lentil soup with
sausage, a traditional Madrilenian dish.
And yes, the soup is rich. Food in
Spain just seems to taste better. The
sausages are smokier, arroz con leche fla
vored ice cream is superb and I'm not
sure how I'll be able to return to Ameri
can coffee.
Meals in Spain are, for the most part,
important affairs, and snacking in be
tween meals is uncommon. Lunches start
around 2 or 3 p.m. and can last over an
hour. Between spoonfuls of soup, we
munch on Galician bread and jump ran
domly from topic to topic from the way
Christmas is celebrated in Spain to the
Flight of the Conchords.

A cheesy commercial pops up on tele
vision, and I get a chance to make some
what snide comments and practice my
Spanish slang. When I can't find the right
words, I trust in cognates and improvisa
tion. One-third of my tries work, and the
rest of the time Rosalia corrects my vo

cabulary and grammar patiently.
I look at my watch and it's nearly 4
p.m. My class on the Camino de Santia
go de Compostela a yearly Christian
pilgrimage starts at 4 p.m. I quickly
finish the remainder of my meal
(overeating is key when dinner doesn't
come until 10 p.m.), sprint down several
flights of stairs and power-walk down
Paseo del General Martinez Campos to
ward the Institute.

But it is easy to slow down and ap
preciate the ambiente of the quaint
streets of Madrid. It's a bustling city, yet
remains elegant in all its historic beau
ty. Small shops that sell particular items
heladerias, papelerias, fruterias
are situated at the bottom of yellow, or
ange and salmon-colored apartment
buildings.

Schoolboys and girls in uniform chat
excitedly in rapid Spanish far too
quickly for me to comprehend. Adults in
professional attire walk coolly, cigarettes
between their fingers. No one really rush
es except for me clearly American.

I burst into the classroom 15 minutes
late while Professor Larranaga is lectur
ing about the apocalypse. He smiles and
pulls up a chair for me. Here, it seems that
time is something that is yours part of
your personal space. Dios mio, I like this
Spanish lifestyle.
