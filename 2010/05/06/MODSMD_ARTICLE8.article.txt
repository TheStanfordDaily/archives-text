# La 						noche
## 
### 
It's almost 1 a.m. and the metro comes less
frequently, getting ready to shut down in
an hour. But when the metro system clos
es, the nightlife begins.
A flood of people exit the station at Puerta
del Sol, a major plaza in Madrid that serves as a
starting point for a whole slew of bars and dis
cotecas, or dance clubs. Young adults gather in
groups to have a botellon, or in more familiar
terms, a pre-game. People squeeze into crowded
tapas bars for cheesy, meaty and bready treats
and large drinks. Promoters chase after partiers,
offering free shots and entrances to discotecas.
Our party is headed to Joy Madrid, one of the
most popular dance clubs in the city, when a pro
moter woos us to another called Palace —we
can't resist entrada gratis and free sangria! The
lights on the dance floor flash quickly in a risk
of-seizure sort of way and bad but catchy tech
no music blares.
"Where are you from?!" scream various dance
partners in accented English against the backdrop
of loud music.
"Soy de California!" is a response that sparks a
curiosity that's reciprocated by a "Soy de
Madrid!" or " Sono da Italia!"
At one point, we dance to overplayed Ameri
can songs like Kesha's "Tik Tok" and the Black

Eyed Peas' "I Gotta Feel
ing." It feels a bit like a
college dance, except
we get twirled around and
are practically the only «
ones who know the full

lyrics. This ensues for four
hours, or more.
At 5 a.m. "Stereo Love"
plays one last time and the

lights switch on. Phone numbers are exchanged,
customary double-kisses goodbyes are given and
then we scatter. At this point, everyone's got the
munchies, so we step over broken glass and avoid
making eye contact as we head toward Chocolate
ria San Gines.
"Churros con chocolate, por favor," a friend
asks, true to tradition. "Y agua! Agua tambien."
It's hard to find a seat because, to no surprise,
this place is full as well. Shoulders slumped and
eyes half-closed, we guiris foreigners watch
as the Spaniards in the restaurant, seasoned veter
ans of the 1 to 6 a.m. nightlife, carry on as if the
night is young.
For us, conversation is at a minimum. Tomor
row we'll visit El Palacio Real, go for a run
through El Parque del Retiro and meet up for
cafe and pastries at Cafe Gijon. But right now,
we're just waiting for the metro to open at 6 a.m.
Our bodies are shocked, but we can't deny that
it's great to be a 20-something here in Madrid.
