"The Life and Art of Sumbat"
Guest: Armen Kirugehian
Iranian-Armenian watercolorist and pioneer
Neither a historian nor an art critic, Armen Der Kiureghian has ventured to publish the book The Life and Art of Sumbat (ISBN 978-0-578-03598-
7; 176 pages in hardcover) about renowned Iranian-Armenian watercolor artist, Sumbat Der Kiureghian. His credentials for publishing the book
are his intimate knowledge of Sumbat, his father, and that he is an amateur watercolorist who studied under him. The book describes Sumbat's
life and art through a series of intimate stories and anecdotes, letters, pictures, and excerpts from other writers. It includes more than 180
reproductions of Sumbat's works.
A descendant of 17th century Armenian settlers in the New Julfa district of Isfahan, Sumbat (1913-1999) embodied the artistic traditions of his
people and of his hometown. Through his art, he played the role of a mediator between East and West: He brought a European artistic style
(lucid watercolor applied in loose brushwork) to Iran and he introduced Iranian lifestyle, folk traditions and landscapes to Western audiences.
His paintings show a remarkable mastery of watercolor and gouache techniques, and loving and tender renditions of both Iranian landscapes
and the life of ordinary people in Iran.

"Women in Modern Iranian Literature"
Guest: Goli Taraghi
Visiting Lecturer, Iranian Studies Program, Stanford University
Goli Taraghi is a writer of myriad talents. Whether contemplating the place of "the mythical mother of life" in human consciousness, or writing
about the larger than life figure of her father—a real estate and publishing magnate, an Iranian Citizen Kane, in her words— whether describing
the sad and satirical absurdities of her life in Islamic Iran or in secular Europe, she brings to her subject a sobering and searing honesty, and an
acute awareness of the ironies of the human condition.
In her work, the comic and the melancholic are inseparable. Human frailty is matched by the humanism evident in many of her characters'
dispositions. In all she writes, facts of life and fictions of the mind, myths of the past and mundane realities of today cohere to create narratives
that are, in the best traditions of Persian literature, at once simple and sophisticated, easy to enjoy and difficult to emulate.
