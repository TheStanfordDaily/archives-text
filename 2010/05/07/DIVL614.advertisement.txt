I don't believe that any religion can survive which is not a religion of
the supernatural and of life after death in some form... I think that the

and its mass amusement is...simply boredom. A people without religion
will in the end find that it has nothing to live for.
(T. S. Eliot, BBC Radio interview, 1956)
