## Abbott to leave Farm for NYU 
### AN LE NGUYEN KATE ABBOTT 
The man who helped oversee the
admission of Stanford's current
freshman, sophomore and junior
classes is leaving the Farm.
Stanford Director of Admission
Shawn Abbott will step down May 14
to become assistant vice president
for undergraduate admissions at
New York University. Abbott will
start his new job at NYU on June 1.
During his time on the Farm, Ab
bott ushered in four classes of Stan

ford undergraduates, from the Class
of 2011 to the Class of 2014. This
spring he was part of the admission
cadre that admitted a record-low 7.2
percent of 32,022 Stanford appli
cants.
The Class of 2011, the first to be
admitted during Abbott's tenure,
saw 2,465 of 23,956 applicants
some 10.28 percent during regu
lar and early admission.
This year, New York University
admitted 29.2 percent of about
38,000 applicants. According to Ab
bott, NYU receives more applica

tions than any other private Ameri
can university. It currently enrolls
some 40,000 students, dispersed
among its 18 schools and colleges.
In a statement to the Stanford
News Service, Abbott said he looks
forward to serving as "a major uni
versity's chief admission officer," but
recognizes that he has "a huge chal
lenge on the horizon."
He said he decided to leave Stan
ford about a month ago.
In his four years, "we've experi
enced explosive growth in applica
tion volume," Abbott wrote in an e
mail to The Daily, noting that about
72 or 73 percent of admitted students
have accepted their offers this year
Stanford's highest yield rate ever.
Abbott has long been involved
with higher education. He was senior
director of admissions at Columbia
University before coming to Stan
ford and has worked in admissions at
Boston University and in alumni re
lations at Drexel University.
As to who will replace Abbott, he
said Dean of Admission Richard
Shaw will start a national search soon.
Meanwhile, the current admission
staff "is in great shape," Abbott said.
