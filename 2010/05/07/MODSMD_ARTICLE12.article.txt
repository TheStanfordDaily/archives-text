## Intelligent Design 
### AVANTIKA AGARWAL 
Imagine walking into your
classroom every morning not
knowing what it is going to
look like. The large blocks of
foam that functioned as
chairs yesterday are now stacked
against the walls or placed in wood
en boxes and pushed together to
create makeshift work surfaces. The
portable whiteboards that were
used for brainstorming the day be
fore are now used as walls.
This might sound uncharacteris
tic of an academic setting, but that
sense of constant change is exactly
what makes the new Design School
(d.school) building so unique.
Today is the d.school's official
opening in its Escondido Mall

home, and there will be informa
tional panels and seminars from 9
a.m. to 6 p.m. that are open to the
public.
"Our philosophy is very pur
posed towards the future," said
Banny Banerjee, the director of the
Stanford Design Program and an
assistant professor in Stanford's
mechanical engineering depart
ment. "You have no way of knowing
what's going to be appropriate to
morrow, what any situation is going
to demand. And so we need our
space to reflect that."
Walking around the new build
ing, one can see that designers Cody
Anderson Wasney (CAW) & MK
Think have tried to make every inch
reflect the school's philosophy. The
d.school has been continuously
reinventing itself, having moved
four times, starting from dou
blewide trailers, and finally ending
up in its fifth and final home in
Building 550 on Escondido Mall.
According to David Kelley, the
founder of the d.school and innova
tion and design firm IDEO,"We be
lieve you can learn anything about
an organization 30 seconds after
walking into their workspace."
"People sitting in cubicles have
cubicle shaped thoughts," Banerjee
added. "The d.school encourages
highly expansive, collaborative, in
ventive thinking, and we need
spaces that allow that, spaces that
obscure rules that inhibit creativi
ty."
The primary aim of the building,
reads the d.school's website, was
"to create innovators rather than
any particular innovation." The
building's flexible design and fluid
atmosphere are intended to foster
that environment of innovation.
The fluid and flexible spaces are
meant to cater to every circum
stance and every project's de
mands. Walls, that are usually made

of white boards are impermanent,
and can slide around to open up
spaces or divide spaces up. In gener
al, almost everything in the d.school
is on wheels.
While Stanford does have an es
tablished program in design, the
d.school itself is unaffiliated with a
particular degree-granting program
and is available to all graduate stu
dents from every major. Walk into
the d.school any day, and you will
find yourself also surrounded by
students and professors of engi

neering, medicine, education, busi
ness and humanities.

Instead of pristine spaces, beau
tiful fittings and ostentatious foun
tains, many parts of the building
have a rough, unfinished feel to
them intended to create a flexi
ble environment that removes any
idea of permanence that might im
pose constraints on creativity.

One such example is the "Jacks
and Pegs" system, which consists of
a series of unfinished two-by-two
wooden planks which have pegs

that hold light-weight, portable dry
erase boards. These boards can be
scribbled on, used as tack-boards
and can be easily removed and
transported. The entire system can
also slide on long tracks, doubling
up as a space divider.
That's a lot of philosophy to
pack into a single building, now the
permanent home of the d.school.

So far, reactions of students who
use the d.school are mixed.

Riah Forbes, a first year MS&E
coterm, is very enthusiastic about

her experience in the building.
"It's my first class in the
d.school!" she said. "I realize this is
not a big deal for you, but being in a
class where I can sit on a large foam
block, makes me quite excited."
However, the space is taking
some time to get used to.

This is the first time that the Me
chanical Engineering Design group
and the d.school are housed in the
same building. The space has also

been opened up to undergraduate
classes and sections. While this is
closer to Kelley's vision of creating
a place where people from diverse
backgrounds can come together to
collaborate, older graduate stu
dents are concerned about the loss
of community that might come with
these changes.
"I feel unwelcome," said Danika
Patrick, a second year graduate stu
dent in the design program. "I don't
run into people anymore."
Second year student Stephanie
Carter, from Stanford's graduate
design program, shares some of
Patrick's concerns.

"By combining more depart
ments to the original d.school
crowd, some intimacy is lost and
there isn't as much a sense of a
tight-knit community as there used
to be," she said.

But Carter added: "I think it is a
beautifully designed space and I
greatly appreciate the attention to
providing small work spaces for
students to use collaboratively and
spontaneously."
If there is one thing the d.school
has nailed down, it is the process of
prototyping. Looking back, Kelley
explains how the annual shifting
and reinventing, while taxing, al

lowed the founders of the school to
practice the same "design thinking"
that they teach. Each shift allowed
them to prototype experiences in
each space, to try and find the best
possible environment to encourage
innovation.

Kelley stressed that spaces are
not designed only once, and that
constant reconfiguration is needed
for improvement.

"As a school, we are very stu
dent-centered," he said. "We are
constantly changing and improving,
based on the feedback we get from
our students. And with 300 intelli
gent Stanford students, I know we

will have better ideas to implement
every day!"

(d.school) building so unique.
Today is the d.school's official
opening in its Escondido Mall

home, and there will be informa
tional panels and seminars from 9
a.m. to 6 p.m. that are open to the
public.
"Our philosophy is very pur
posed towards the future," said
Banny Banerjee, the director of the
Stanford Design Program and an
assistant professor in Stanford's
mechanical engineering depart
ment. "You have no way of knowing
what's going to be appropriate to
morrow, what any situation is going
to demand. And so we need our
space to reflect that."
Walking around the new build
ing, one can see that designers Cody
Anderson Wasney (CAW) & MK
Think have tried to make every inch
reflect the school's philosophy. The
d.school has been continuously
reinventing itself, having moved
four times, starting from dou
blewide trailers, and finally ending
up in its fifth and final home in
Building 550 on Escondido Mall.
According to David Kelley, the
founder of the d.school and innova
tion and design firm IDEO,"We be
lieve you can learn anything about
an organization 30 seconds after
walking into their workspace."
"People sitting in cubicles have
cubicle shaped thoughts," Banerjee
added. "The d.school encourages
highly expansive, collaborative, in
ventive thinking, and we need
spaces that allow that, spaces that
obscure rules that inhibit creativi
ty."
The primary aim of the building,
reads the d.school's website, was
"to create innovators rather than
any particular innovation." The
building's flexible design and fluid
atmosphere are intended to foster
that environment of innovation.
The fluid and flexible spaces are
meant to cater to every circum
stance and every project's de
mands. Walls, that are usually made

of white boards are impermanent,
and can slide around to open up
spaces or divide spaces up. In gener
al, almost everything in the d.school
is on wheels.
While Stanford does have an es
tablished program in design, the
d.school itself is unaffiliated with a
particular degree-granting program
and is available to all graduate stu
dents from every major. Walk into
the d.school any day, and you will
find yourself also surrounded by
students and professors of engi

neering, medicine, education, busi
ness and humanities.

Instead of pristine spaces, beau
tiful fittings and ostentatious foun
tains, many parts of the building
have a rough, unfinished feel to
them intended to create a flexi
ble environment that removes any
idea of permanence that might im
pose constraints on creativity.

One such example is the "Jacks
and Pegs" system, which consists of
a series of unfinished two-by-two
wooden planks which have pegs

that hold light-weight, portable dry
erase boards. These boards can be
scribbled on, used as tack-boards
and can be easily removed and
transported. The entire system can
also slide on long tracks, doubling
up as a space divider.
That's a lot of philosophy to
pack into a single building, now the
permanent home of the d.school.

So far, reactions of students who
use the d.school are mixed.

Riah Forbes, a first year MS&E
coterm, is very enthusiastic about

her experience in the building.
"It's my first class in the
d.school!" she said. "I realize this is
not a big deal for you, but being in a
class where I can sit on a large foam
block, makes me quite excited."
However, the space is taking
some time to get used to.

chanical Engineering Design group
and the d.school are housed in the
same building. The space has also

been opened up to undergraduate
classes and sections. While this is
closer to Kelley's vision of creating
a place where people from diverse
backgrounds can come together to
collaborate, older graduate stu
dents are concerned about the loss
of community that might come with
these changes.
"I feel unwelcome," said Danika
Patrick, a second year graduate stu
dent in the design program. "I don't
run into people anymore."
Second year student Stephanie
Carter, from Stanford's graduate
design program, shares some of
Patrick's concerns.

"By combining more depart
ments to the original d.school
crowd, some intimacy is lost and
there isn't as much a sense of a
tight-knit community as there used
to be," she said.

But Carter added: "I think it is a
beautifully designed space and I
greatly appreciate the attention to
providing small work spaces for
students to use collaboratively and
spontaneously."
If there is one thing the d.school
has nailed down, it is the process of
prototyping. Looking back, Kelley
explains how the annual shifting
and reinventing, while taxing, al

lowed the founders of the school to
practice the same "design thinking"
that they teach. Each shift allowed
them to prototype experiences in
each space, to try and find the best
possible environment to encourage
innovation.

Kelley stressed that spaces are
not designed only once, and that
constant reconfiguration is needed
for improvement.

"As a school, we are very stu
dent-centered," he said. "We are
constantly changing and improving,
based on the feedback we get from
our students. And with 300 intelli
gent Stanford students, I know we

will have better ideas to implement
every day!"
