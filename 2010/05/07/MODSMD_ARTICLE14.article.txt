# CLASS CONFLICT
## 
### JESS WERTHEIM STAFF WRITER 
The freshmen class gave a
whole new meaning to
youth in revolt during
Thursday's Battle of the
Classes, dominating the
sophomores, juniors and seniors by
mass alone.
The campus wide-event hosted 18
athletic events, including volleyball,
rugby, soccer and badminton, and
ended with a BBQ picnic at Roble
field. The grand finale was an all
class Tug-Of-War which bore a star
tling resemblance to the last seven
minutes of the movie 300 and the
first seven seconds of a wet t-shirt
contest: spring break edition.
Eric Stein, senior associate athlet
ic director, was one of the head cre
ative minds behind the extended
field day.
"We were trying to get an idea
that would appeal to and involve as
many different Stanford students as
possible," he said. "What we really
wanted was to create class pride, for
students to show up and create a bit
of fun and craziness in the name of
their class."
Assisting Stein were the campus
recreation staff and class officers,
who had been involved in the event's
conception since the second week of
fall quarter.
"[We wanted] to bring together
the undergraduate population here
at Stanford," said Walter Foxworth
'lO, one of the senior class presidents.
[There are] so many amazing talents
in the student body, but we have
never fully exploited that to see what
it amounts to."
From 4 to 6:30 p.m., students dis
played impressive feats of athleti
cism. Elliot Damashek 'll, for exam
ple, scored 14 out of the 17 points for
his team in a heated game of Corn
hole.
"It was great," Damaskek said. "I

had a really good time playing
against other juniors, and the game
harkened back to my Midwestern
roots."
And while some students were

reminiscing about the "good ol'
days," others enjoyed the more phys
ical options.
"TTie kickball game was intense,"
said Johnny Villarreal 'l2. "It's not
called Battle of the Classes for noth
ing."
Jose Vietez 'll agreed.
"You do it for the glory," he said,
while showing off his battle wound.
"And girls dig scars."
However, the clear crowd pleas-

"You do it for
the glory."

er was the tug-of-war game, which
took place at the end of the BBQ.
After announcing the rankings
the Junior class went wild upon
hearing that they were solidly in last
place Stein began the main tug
of-war games, which were officiated
by the Palo Alto Fire Department's
hose and a large standing assembly,
which included Dean Julie Lyth
cott-Haims 'B9.
"The freshmen are outnumber
ing everyone," she said, "But I
wouldn't count any class out 'till
they're out."

However, in keeping with the
day's tradition, Class of 2013 domi
nated, taking every other class down
to the metaphorical mat.
"It was unsatisfyingly easy," said
George Michopoulos 'l3 of the
freshmen's decisive victory over the
sophomores. "Like taking candy

from a child."
But perhaps the sweetest pseudo
victory of the day occurred during
the coed junior vs. senior match-up,
when the head of the junior side,
Max Hawes, organized a sudden
drop of the rope, sending the seniors
sprawling in the opposite direction.
The end of Battle of the Classes
saw the freshmen win the Golden
Chalice, which will soon be en
graved with their class year and
placed in Old Union for the rest of
the student body to marvel at until
the day it will inevitably be stolen.
While freshmen credited their vic
tory to their youth, flexibility and
overall muscle mass, the juniors at
tributed their stylish loss to "dedica
tion for their studies."

Regardless of the score, Battle of
the Classes was a wonderful break
from midterms, a great way to spend
a Thursday afternoon and what the
athletic department hopes to be a
tradition in the making.
