# CLASS CONFLICT

### JESS WERTHEIM STAFF WRITER 
The freshmen class gave a
whole new meaning to
youth in revolt during
Thursday's Battle of the
Classes, dominating the
sophomores, juniors and seniors by
mass alone.
The campus wide-event hosted 18
athletic events, including volleyball,
rugby, soccer and badminton, and
ended with a BBQ picnic at Roble
field. The grand finale was an all
class Tug-Of-War which bore a star
tling resemblance to the last seven
minutes of the movie 300 and the
first seven seconds of a wet t-shirt
contest: spring break edition.
Eric Stein, senior associate athlet
ic director, was one of the head cre
ative minds behind the extended
field day.
"We were trying to get an idea
that would appeal to and involve as
many different Stanford students as
possible," he said. "What we really
wanted was to create class pride, for
students to show up and create a bit
of fun and craziness in the name of
their class."
Assisting Stein were the campus
recreation staff and class officers,
who had been involved in the event's
conception since the second week of
fall quarter.
"[We wanted] to bring together
the undergraduate population here
at Stanford," said Walter Foxworth
'lO, one of the senior class presidents.
[There are] so many amazing talents
in the student body, but we have
never fully exploited that to see what
it amounts to."
From 4 to 6:30 p.m., students dis
played impressive feats of athleti
cism. Elliot Damashek 'll, for exam
ple, scored 14 out of the 17 points for
his team in a heated game of Corn
hole.
"It was great," Damaskek said. "I

had a really good time playing
against other juniors, and the game
harkened back to my Midwestern
roots."
And while some students were

reminiscing about the "good ol'
days," others enjoyed the more phys
ical options.
"TTie kickball game was intense,"
said Johnny Villarreal 'l2. "It's not
called Battle of the Classes for noth
ing."
Jose Vietez 'll agreed.
"You do it for the glory," he said,
while showing off his battle wound.
"And girls dig scars."
However, the clear crowd pleas-

"You do it for
the glory."
