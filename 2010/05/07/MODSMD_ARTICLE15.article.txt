## EDITORIAL GSC squanders budget on food and trips 
### 
In these limited economic times, the Edito
rial Board believes that ASSU student
funds should be managed more efficient
ly, though surely without compromising the
essential roles of the respective bodies. The
Undergraduate Senate clearly was not with
out fault in its past term, and the contentions
regarding funding and miscommunication
with student groups have been well reported
by The Daily. However, the Senate's parallel
body in the graduate community, the Gradu
ate Student Council (GSC), is not as closely
watched by the undergraduate community,
but still holds substantial influence over the
disbursal of student funds.
The GSC is often the more fiscally conser
vative of the two bodies when it comes to
funding student groups, public events or
other initiatives. This is mostly because the
nature of the graduate student experience is
very different from that of the undergradu
ate, and graduate students often do not feel
they should pay for services or activities that
are not used by the majority of the graduate
population. However, when it comes to fund
ing the GSC's internal structure, they are
much more generous. In the 2010 fiscal year,
the GSC total budget was $46,005.01. Of that,
$9,500 was spent on meeting food, $l,OOO for
a Food Czar to pick up their food and $6,500
for an orientation trip to Napa.
In the 2011 budget, the GSC allocated
$45,951 for its internal operations. There are,
again, $6,500 allocated for an orientation
trip, $l,OOO for the Food Czar and a slightly
less outrageous $8,500 for meeting food ex

penses. The Undergraduate Senate, on the
other hand, had a 2010 budget of $36,880 and
a budget of $36,100 for 2011. They only spend
$l,OOO for their orientation retreat and have
no meeting food or Food Czar.
This information is especially important
because the GSC has recently attempted,
rather hypocritically, to overstep its constitu
tional boundaries in trying to limit how the
ASSU Executive uses its discretionary fund
ing, trying to limit cabinet salary and heavily
speaking out against the idea of taking $5OO
out of the Executive salary to fund a Haiti re
lief fundraising czar. This is especially alarm
ing considering that they are so willing to
spend $l,OOO to pay a Food Czar to deliver
their food, while they are so deeply opposed
to paying a student a small incentive for the
very difficult effort of fundraising for the
Haiti cause.

The Editorial Board encourages the stu
dent body to demand accountability from
every representative body equally. All stu
dents undergraduate and graduate alike
should call upon the GSC to stop wasting
money on frivolous perks and free food. Fur
thermore, if they insist on dedicating their
budget to pay for snacks and vacations, then
they have no right to preach fiscal responsi
bility to the rest of the ASSU. It goes without
saying that graduate students are generally
older and have more education than under
grads. But as the budgetary policies of the
GSC clearly show, these attributes do not
make them any more fiscally responsible
than undergrads.
