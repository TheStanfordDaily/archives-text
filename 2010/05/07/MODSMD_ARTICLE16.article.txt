# SENSE AND NONSENSE
## A
						Church at Our Center 
### Aysha Bagchi 
A couple years ago, a curator at the
Cantor Arts Museum told me that the
fact that Memorial Church is in the
center of the Quad, which is in the middle of
campus, signifies how spiritual life is at the
core of a Stanford education. I remember
feeling strong resistance to her idea at the
time. When I reflect on it two years later,
however, I have a lot more sympathy for
what she said.

"Spirituality" is a strange and uncertain
concept, but it is a mistake to view it as re
stricted to religion or belief in the supernatu
ral. People who neither belong to a religion
nor believe in the supernatural can live very
spiritual lives. The best conception of a "spir
itual" person that I can think of is someone
who believes that questions about meaning
and purpose are worth asking. This does not
include all students there may be one or
two true nihilists among us for whom nothing
in life is in any sense or at any level meaning
ful. To you stalwart disbelievers, I'm afraid
we must part ways.

To the rest of you, I want to think about
why we avoid the brand of "spirituality," for
going the more reflective lives the brand
would encourage us to lead.
One big reason seems to be that "spiritu
ality" is strongly associated with being reli
gious. Many liberals and non-believers at
universities wish to avoid that association
like the plague. Despite the fact that pursuing
a spiritual life tends to lead the religious and
non-religious alike to many of the same im
portant themes friends, family, the arts,
travel, vocations, learning, morality and serv
ice all come to mind the non-religious dis
like the category.
Perhaps part of the problem is that "spiri
tuality" does not just include the religious,
but tends to highlight them as the biggest suc
cess stories, as those who believe most fer
vently in the meaningfulness of their life
course. Under this hierarchy, the non-reli
gious are more often the people with some
thing to learn. At higher institutions like
Stanford, where there is often more than a
tinge of liberal snobbishness toward religion,
this reorientation might sting.
The non-religious can point to many rea
sons why they would not want to be associat
ed with these spiritual pioneers. Many are
rightly angry to see religious arguments with
no secular appeal play such a huge role in the
American culture wars. They are frustrated
to hear school boards threaten the sanctity of
history and science in education textbooks.
They are repulsed as they should be by
the recent Catholic abuse scandal and the
meager (and un-Christian) immediate re
sponse from the Vatican.
But to point only to these aspects of reli
gion is a huge mistake, one that often reflects
an underlying and less rational antagonism.
We can see this in the wish to deny all the
good that religion does, not just in the inti
mate aspects of people's lives, but also in the
public sphere. The religious are so often the
shining models of human kindness on the
micro and macro levels.
Columnist Nick Kristof of The New York

Times has written a couple terrific articles on
this topic, talking about how America's
biggest relief organizations are faith-based
and how so many of the unsung heroes he
meets in impoverished corners of the world,
people devoting their lives to helping the
least fortunate, are individual priests or nuns.

I hear so many Stanford students echo this
message after seeing the selfless work faith
based organizations and individuals do
around the world. Even evangelicals in the
U.S. give far more than those who look down
upon them in our society. And it would be a
mistake, as Kristof points out, to assume that
faith-based relief organizations work in
order to entice converts: groups like the
Christian-based World Vision (the largest in
ternational relief organization in the U.S.)
ban the use of aid to lure anyone into reli
gious conversion.

All this awe-inspiring selflessness of many
of the faithful should, in our most honest mo
ments, humble us to the core. To some extent,
it reflects their faith that good works are es
sential to a meaningful life. This is a faith that
the non-religious community would exhibit
more often if they actively pursued more
spiritual lives. And such lives would probably
be more satisfying to boot.
A friend once told me that the tiny circle
in the middle of the quad is called the "epi
center of knowledge" a fitting paradigm
for understanding much of what Stanford is
about. Another is to think of the central role
spirituality should play throughout our lives
and particularly when we make so many cru
cial choices during our college careers. I
never fail to think of these two paradigms
when I walk in between the epicenter of
knowledge and Memorial Church they
enrich each day I have here and make my ed
ucation a more meaningful enterprise.

Think there is any meaning to it all? Given up
hope? Send Aysha your comments at
