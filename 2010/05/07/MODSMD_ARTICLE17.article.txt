# MIDNIGHT FRYER
## Life is too Short 
### Yanran Lu 
I have a soft spot for beautiful men who
also happen to be "charming." This weak
ness of mine has caused me many heart
breaks. When I finally I asked one of them,
"why do people say you are not boyfriend
material?" he replied that he didn't want to
be tied down because, as he put it, "life is too
short!"

Life is, indeed, too short. One must maxi
mize his or her pleasure. One has to sleep
with a different person every single night, just
so one can hear how skinny she looks or how
big his penis is. It is obviously not enough to
get the attention of one person one must
be surrounded by many, different beautiful
men or women to be vaguely impressive for
one's peers and feel good about oneself.
After all, it is not the quality that matters, but
the quantity. It is not the depth that matters,
but the looks. It is not enough that one is
happy, but that one appears desirable, popu
lar and "has game." Who cares if you can't
have conversations longer than five minutes?
Your friends would not know that; they only
notice how sexy your arm-candy looks or
how charming you are with people. Who
needs meaningful connections? Who even
has time for deep, soulful conversations? We
live in the fast paced technological age,
where sentimentality is drowned by the new
generations of iTouch, iPhone and iPad.
Never mind that the functionalities are basi
cally the same, and we are generating e-waste
while screaming "environmentalism." We
have to have them all so we can quantify our
status in some visible way.
The next thing you hear, of course, is that
Stanford kids don't date. I mean, why would
we, if we could hardly be satisfied with one

iGadget? Getting to know someone obvious
ly takes up way too much time, something a
Stanford student does not have. After aca
demics, extracurriculars, internships and
graduate school applications, who has time
for such abstractions as love? In addition, we
could not possibly be Mr. or Ms. Popular if we
just have one friend who knows all of our in
and outs. We have to have 100+ superficial
friends who would laugh at us if we were to
throw up on ourselves, or step on our toes to
get in front of us in line. It's called network
ing Silicon Valley entrepreneurial style.
Superficial? Sure, but can we really blame
someone for having commitment-phobia or
intimacy issues? In a world where we can
have our coffee served straight, with soy,
skim or whole milk, perhaps it is too much to
ask for someone to know if he or she likes
blond, brunette or black hair... or even no
hair at all. In a world where we aspire to be
people who can't leave their Blackberries
during their vacations, perhaps it is too much
to ask for people to enjoy each others' com
pany with tea, silence and stars instead of "ef
ficient" exchanges of banter and informa
tion. Perhaps we are too busy with work, too
dazzled by the media fantasy of speedy love
and money to get to know ourselves as we are
and figure out who and what we want. Every
thing must have a result. Dating? It is, unfor
tunately, a too low-yield game. So we should
just count our sex partners instead. Sorry col
lege ladies, this game is not for you, unless
you don't mind being called a "slut." Only
guys can be the "players."
In a society in which we unfairly value
guys for not knowing who they are and what
they want sexually or romantically, and con-

demn women for exploring their sexuality, I
am fed up with people who cling to meaning
less encounters as if these were some deep
sea treasure. There is a reason why people
call it "one night stand" for the novelty
and brevity. If one's life is filled with such
meaningless "one night stands," it is just plain
sad. We get to be "the man" at the cost of real
emotional connections.

If life really were too short, I certainly
would not want to waste my time on Mr. or
Mrs. Wrong. Yet some of us waste our time
and energy on people who barely brush us by.
We want to be in the center of the spotlight,
having people whom we don't care about
"praise" us, and feel for a brief moment less
insecure and less empty. We attribute it to the
glorious youth that we are able to "get so
much [different] ass," that we are "living the
life" and have so many friends; yet none of
these people have made a difference in our
lives nor have we in theirs. We do it so we can
avoid noticing how empty it really feels in
side how we are so numb from or afraid of
all the heartbreaks that we close ourselves so
we do not have to be vulnerable. GET REAL
AND GROW UP! Cut off the meaningless
shit so we can make time for something
meaningful something with true value.
After all, "life is too short."
