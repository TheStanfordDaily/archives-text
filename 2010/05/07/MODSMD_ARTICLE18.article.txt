Maitozo scissor-kicks from a spinning handstand
to a backflipping dismount. Coordinated to
music, the move is already a spectacle add the
cantering horse beneath him, and the result is one
of the more peculiar and obscure sports in America.
Equestrian vaulting, a combination of dance and gymnas
tics on horseback, is coming to the Stanford Red Barn this
weekend. Maitozo's Free Artists Creative Equestrians
(FACE) Vaulting team is holding a fundraising exhibition
Sunday evening to support its bid for the 2010 Alltech FEI
World Equestrian Games (WEG) in Kentucky.
"We're giving a sneak peak of what we're doing this year,"
Maitozo said. "This will be our first time performing in 2010."
The Romeo and Juliet-themed demonstration, which
jumpstarts FACE'S competition season, will showcase five of
the eight members of the FACE team.
Most popular in Western Europe, equestrian vaulting re
quires coordination between the vaulter, the horse and the
"longeur," who controls the horse's path. Individuals, pairs
and teams compete in separate categories, using mounts, dis
mounts, handstands and flips set to music. Teams, such as
FACE, will also incorporate carries, lifts and tosses of team
members as the horse canters about a circle.

The FACE team, drawing upon the theater and arts back
ground of Maitozo, who does triple duty as head coach, cho
reographer and competitor, focuses on the lyricism and ex
pression of their routines.
"I would say we're more known for the way we interpret
music and the way we use dance," Maitozo said. "Our team
tends to emphasize the artistry of the sport as opposed to the
gymnastics of the sport."
"I like to bring out the emotional experience for the audi
ence," he added.
After years of successfully competing in solo vaulting,
Maitozo founded the FACE Vaulting Club in 2000 with the
goal of sending elite teams to compete at the world champi
onship level.

Maitozo-coached teams represented the United States at
the 2002 WEG in Spain, placing fifth, and again in Germany
in 2006, placing second. The World Equestrian Games
equivalent to the Olympics of horse sports have been held
every four years since 1990.
To represent the U.S. in October, the 2010 FACE team
must earn high enough scores during the competition season
beginning May 15. The current FACE team consists of six
vaulters and two alternates from across the country, plus co
coach and team manager Anna de la Motte.
In preparation for the World Equestrian Games, FACE
vaulter Mari Inouye said she practices every Tuesday and
Thursday, while the team meets as a whole twice a month for
three-day, intensive clinics. Finessing the intricate choreogra-

phy and gravity-defying lifts requires "a lot of hours on the
barrel," Inouye said.
Most of the FACE team members have been vaulting
from a young age, and many have distinguished themselves in
individual events and on other vaulting teams. Equestrian
vaulting, still a relatively small sport within the United States,
draws people from a variety of backgrounds.
"People hear about [vaulting] from a friend, or they see
something it's a lot of kids or parents that are intrigued by
horses," Maitozo said. "Having a gymnastics or dance back
ground is helpful, but it is more likely [to be] people with a
horse background."
Inouye was originally a gymnast (she competed for the
UC-Davis gymnastics team) before a friend introduced her
to equestrian vaulting. She said the transition from tradition
al gymnastics to horseback acrobatics was not necessarily a
smooth one.

"You aren't only doing gymnastics on a static piece of
equipment; you're doing it on a living animal," she said. "The
animal is very unpredictable. You never know if it's going to
spook, so you have to be very in tune with your horse."
The horse plays an essential role in routines, and it is more
than a mere moving platform. Much like ice skating and gym
nastics, scoring is based upon semi-subjective categories like
technique, form and balance. But in equestrian vaulting, the
horse, as well as the vaulter, is judged for the final score.
The hopes of this FACE team are carried on the back
literally of Palatine, a 12-year-old chestnut Westphalian
Warmblood imported from Berlin. Palatine, on the small side
for a team horse, is currently the only horse on the roster.
For the Stanford performance, FACE will mainly show
case its freestyle work with some individual demonstrations
of vaulting moves.
"We're going to make it educational for the people who
have no idea what vaulting is," Inouye said. "[The audience]
can expect a wonderful performance, which is really based on
expression and being a performance piece,"
FACE will debut its new Romeo and Juliet routine, which
the team hopes to take all the way to the World Equestrian
Games, at the Stanford Red Barn at 5 p.m. on Sunday.
