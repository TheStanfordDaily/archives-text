# Glimmering "Crystal Castles"

With their arguably
harsh sound and
intense robotic
rhythms, I realize that the music
of Crystal Castles is somewhat of
an acquired taste, one that I have
recently learned to love. The duo,
composed of vocalist Alice Glass
and producer Ethan Kath, first
made waves in 2008 with their
first album, eponymously titled
"Crystal Castles," receiving fair
critical reviews. With the release
of their second studio album,
"Crystal Castles (II)," on May 14
(it was released digitally on April
19), the group maintains their sig
nature experimental dance style,
but adds a hint of maturity that
showcases their development as
musical artists.
I'll admit, probably like many
other novel listeners to the duo,
that I initially dismissed their
music, finding it just overbearing
and loud. However, after really
giving them a thorough listen, I
now understand that their sound
is much more than just the elec
tronic beats, and this characteris
tic is very evident on their newest
album. From song to song, and
even within a single song, their
music spans many different tones,
yet all the while staying true to
the overall aesthetic of the group.
For example, the first track on the
album, "Fainting Spells," seems
chaotic and shrill, while a later
track, "Violent Dreams," is
somber and faint. The way they
combine so many varied sounds
to produce such imaginative
songs, not to mention a thought
ful, comprehensive album, is
remarkable.
"Crystal Castles (II)" does
well to maintain the vigor of the
group's previous work, with a
sometimes-subdued flavor that
allows for more expression. Their
expressive insight is undoubtedly
the strength of the group, with
this album in particular. They
don't just create lively, electric
dance hits that would be too
easy. Instead, they manage to
inhabit the energetic dance genre
while still infusing tangible, real
emotion in their work, using both
beats and vocals (and even sam
pling Sigur Ros). Two songs that
really capture this sentiment, and
my two favorites on the album,
are "Baptism" and "Vietnam."
Both records make you feel explo

sive and profound all at once.
Although a minor detail of
the overall album when compared
to the actual music, I want to
quickly mention that I love both
the title and CD cover. The fact
that they are self-titling their
album for the second time indi
cates to me two things: they're not
bogged down by trite, meaning
less names and they are primarily
concerned with the music, and
the music alone, two implications
I can certainly respect. The album
cover is mysterious and cool a
young girl in a cemetery. It makes
me wonder.
The more I listen to the
album, the more I love it. "Crystal
Castles (II)" is effortlessly a story I
want to dance to. The songs on
the album cover a whole spec
trum of vibes, both musically and
emotionally. While their style still
remains extremely electronic, they

have honed this sound to make an
understated declaration, as if
robots wrote a music manifesto.
Some say what differentiate
robots from humans is their lack
of emotions. Apparently this idea
is one that Crystal Castles has
never heard of, or dares to prove
wrong.
