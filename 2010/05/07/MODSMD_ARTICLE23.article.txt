After appearing on the hip
hop radar with buzzed
about mixtapes, Bobby
Ray Simmons, or as he is more
commonly known, 8.0.8., is on
the tip of everybody's tongue
right now. His debut album,
"8.0.8. Presents: The Adventures
of Bobby Ray" functions as an
impressive collaborative outlet for
the rapper, with almost every
track featuring a well-respected

and popular artist (Lupe Fiasco,
T.I. and Paramore's Hayley
Williams, to name a few). On just
a few tracks, 8.0.8. stands alone,
showcasing his tremendous tal
ents. Not only are his vocal
stylings nothing to scoff at, it is
important to note that the 21-
year-old produced the majority of
r the album himself —in doing so,
he has created tracks well-suited
for each of his guests, allowing

them to shine in their respective
solos.
With the explosive popularity
of his first single, "Nothin' On
You," featuring Bruno Mars, any
body ever near a radio has gotten
at least a little listen to 8.0.8.
However catchy this song is, it
certainly is not the standout of
the album. Sampling Vampire
Weekend's "The Kids Don't Stand
a Chance," 8.0.8. and Janelle

Monae rap and sing social com
mentary on "The Kids." Also
flooding the radio waves is
"Airplanes (Part II)," featuring
Eminem and Williams both
rappers imagine how life would
differ if they had not made it in
the hip-hop industry, all while
Williams' enticing vocals hook lis
teners in again and again.
However, the shortcomings
in the album may lie embedded

within its strengths for all of
the hype surrounding Bobby Ray
Simmons as an original and indie
artist, he relies very heavily on the
work of others to carry his sound.
In fact, in many of his collabora
tive tracks, it is the guest artist
that stands out and makes the
song worth listening to. On the
aforementioned "Airplanes (Part
II)," Eminem reminds us of why
he was such a trailblazer in the
first place he sounds raw and
intense, in stark contrast to
Simmons' tame rapping. On
tracks where he stands alone,
8.0.8. doesn't sound bad, neces
sarily, he just smacks so wholly of
Kanye West that it is impossible to
get the comparison out of the lis
tener's head.
It is Simmons' inability to
hold on to a concrete identity that
is the ultimate failure in this
album. With the recurring sam
pling of popular tracks to the vast
array of guest artists, there is no
cohesive feel to "The Adventures
of Bobby Ray." Without this over
arching unity, the listener is left
wondering what really makes up
this artist what is the essence
of Bobby Ray? Potentially daring
rhymes are lost in generic riffs
and beats, and more often than
not, the rapper is overpowered by
every other element in a particu
lar song. Simmons is quoted as
saying, "I'm just born to be differ
ent. Like my genetic DNA is just
different. The 'D' in my DNA
stand for different."
It will undoubtedly reach
commercial success, but if "The
Adventures of Bobby Ray" is any
indication, this young rapper is
going to have to do a lot more to
prove that he is indeed different.
