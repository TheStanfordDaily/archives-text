# Iron Man 2: Better Than the First?

The first "Iron Man" movie
was one of the best block
buster films to have graced
the screen in recent years, albeit a
bit forgettable. It achieved the near
perfect balance between pure enter
tainment and smarts that all sum
mer movies aspire to attain, and it
was rewarded for it. The film was
extremely successful both domesti
cally and internationally, and it re
launched the career of the critically
acclaimed, but until then, not very
bankable, Robert Downey Jr.
In many ways "Iron Man 2" is a
rehash of its predecessor, but having
done away with the required char
acter introductions in the first
movie, this film feels more assured
and it is more successful because of
it. And yes, there are big explosions
as a matter of fact the film's cli
max is a 30-minute effects extrava
ganza that's bound to leave the
most insatiable action buff satisfied.
But the returning characters, and
our familiarity with them, are what
make the movie stand out from
other action fare out there.
Downey Jr. is still as charismat
ic as ever, a joy to watch as he deliv
ers one-liners with self-assuredness
and comedic timing that many
actors wish they possessed. He has
become Tony Stark, and embodies
the character as if he had been play
ing him for years. The movie's suc
cess rests on his talents to such an
extent that whenever Tony puts on
the suit, the film automatically
becomes less enjoyable.
Gwyneth Paltrow returns as
Virginia "Pepper" Pots, and I'm
delighted to report that she is as

charming as ever. Most importantly,
she's not to be outdone by Mr.
Downey Jr. Their dynamic on
screen is very enjoyable to watch
and it is Pepper who allows Tony to
become a relatable character, as
opposed to a zinger-spitting carica
ture. A plethora of characters join
the previous two, including Scarlett
Johnson as Tony's new assistant,
Don Cheadle as James "Rhodey"

Rhodes and the always-entertaining
Samuel L. Jackson as S.HJ.E.L.D.
leader Nick Fury. It is a feat by the
director, John Favreau, that the film
never feels cluttered or rushed.
As I said before, "Iron Man 2"
is very much a rehash of the origi
nal "Iron Man," and unfortunately it
inherits its most memorable blun
ders. The movie's plot is a bit of a
mess. On the one side, we are intro
duced to a new villain: Ivan Vanko
(Mickey Rourke), a Russian ex-con
vict set on avenging his father with
the help of Justin Hammer (Sam

Rockwell), a millionaire who longs
to become the next Tony Stark. Just
like in the previous film though, the
villains are so underdeveloped that
they quickly veer into cartoon terri
tory (for example, Vanko has plenty
of tattoos and a vodka-drinking
habit to prove his bad nature and
his nationality, respectively). On the
other hand, the movie also deals
with Tony's debilitating health and
his internal struggle with the legacy
of his father, and while Downey Jr.
gives it his all, the script is not as
tight as it should be, failing to pull
all of the components together into

a coherent narrative. As a result,
there are times when the movie
feels aimless and directionless.
Despite all the similarities,
"Iron Man 2" is better than its pred
ecessor. It is more fun, it is more
fleshed out and it is something the
first "Iron Man" was not entirely
memorable.
