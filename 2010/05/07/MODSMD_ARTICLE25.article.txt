# Stanford Dance Brings Style

With the multitude of
dance groups on
Stanford campus, it can
be hard to keep them all straight.
Especially for us non-dancers, many
groups seem to blur the line
between traditional forms and a
fusion of contemporary and classi
cal training. This past Sunday, one
particular group starred in and
hosted a collaborative event, and
the lucky audience got to be amazed
not only by the talent of Urban
Styles, Stanford's student-run con
temporary jazz and lyrical group,
but also guest performances from
other artists around campus.
"Elements" was a production of
ambitious proportions and consis
tently impressed everybody in
Dinkelspiel auditorium with the
amount of talent found in the stu
dent body.
Opening with a high-energy
number set to "Mercy," by Duffy,
Urban Styles came on stage drawing
a wild reaction from the crowd.
With many of the audience being
family and friends of the dancers,
this was not your typical dance

show experience. Instead of staying
hushed, with the space so silent that
you can hear a pin drop, the audi
ence was loud and raucous, yelling
dancers' names and cheering consis
tently. This was no exception for
"Detention," performed by
TapTh@t, Stanford's advanced tap
group. With four women sitting in
desks, dressed in school uniforms,
the number opened with a
"STOMP"-esque rhythm, then
building into a foot-flying frenzy
that had the audience gasping and
clapping. With no extra soundtrack,
this was dancing down to its bare
bones, and it was very evident that
the dancers had a great time with it.
The first act was filled with
performances from Urban Styles,
and an appearance from Talisman,
one of Stanford's many a cappella
groups, was one of the only
moments where the audience sat in
silence, made rapt by the spirituality
of the two numbers the group per
formed. The standout dance of the
first act, though, was set to "Ali in
the Jungle," by the Hours.
Choreographed by Annemarie

Estess 'O9, a smaller portion of
Urban Styles hit the stage with edgy
costumes and fierce dance moves.
After intermission, we were
treated with a performance from
Bent Spoon, Stanford's only mod
ern dance group. It was a quiet
number, set to "Your Ex-Lover Is
Dead" by Stars, and was a nice
break in the action before the most
crowd-pleasing number. Set to
"Bulletproof," by La Roux, the
Urban Styles senior piece was over
too quickly for most. Dressed in
colorful outfits, the six incredibly
talented senior dancers were all
smiles as they put their heart and
soul into the piece collaboratively
choreographed by each of them.
However excited they were to be on
stage, it was nothing compared to
the pride of their friends and family
watching them, and one could
hardly hear the music over the non
stop cheering.
With a performance from
Swingtime, Stanford's swing danc
ing group, the show was given a
welcome change of pace, and the
audience enjoyed a toe-tapping and

jazzy break from the other kinds of
dance thus far. Everybody in the
large group looked to have a great
time, and the audience was wowed
with flips and lifts. After Swingtime,
Alliance, one of Stanford's multiple
hip-hop groups, took the stage with
a number set to multiple top-40
hits. Adding a touch of "America's
Best Dance Crew" to the show,
Alliance was exciting to watch, and
a lot of the audience was sad to see
them exit the stage.
Concluding with a sensuous
and eye-catching piece performed
to "Stillness Is The Move" by Dirty
Projectors, Urban Styles Presents:
Elements was a fast-paced and high
energy dance production featuring
not only the talented jazz group, but
bringing in many other artists from
all over campus, as well. Look for
ward to Urban Styles' next showcase
it is dancing that you won't want
to miss.
