# 'Spelling Bee' is a G-O S-E-E

Once a year, the Scripps
National Spelling Bee airs
on TV so we can all watch
pimpled preteens nervously try to
spell words correctly. People joke
about why ESPN broadcasts the
event. But as a former contestant of
my middle school spelling bee, I can
attest that the whole thing is as
nerve-wracking and cutthroat as
any competitive sport.
Also once a year, the residents
of Roble Hall put on an annual

amateur musical in their theater
and their production of "The 25th
Annual Putnam County Spelling
Bee" is a winner. The fairly green
cast most have only had some
experience in past high school
musicals or synagogue performanc
es roll out the laughs with toe
tapping tunes, with music by
William Finn and a book by Rachel
Sheinkin. The show follows the
spelling tribulations and adolescent
awkwardness of a group of pubes
cent spellers as they compete for the
first place spot that will send them
to nationals.
While the spelling bee set up is
the show's central conceit, it's really
the quirky misfit contestants that
are the heart of the play. There's the
cocky brainiac with nasal problems
and a special bodily gift for spelling
and the stereotypical Asian over
achiever who yearns to be more
than a pile of trophies and titles.
There's also the politically active
president of her elementary school's
Gay/Straight Alliance and the Boy
Scout whose dishonorable thoughts
flare up at the most inconvenient
time. Be sure to add in the eccentric
kook who wears a homemade cape
and the sad-sack girl who longs for
her parents' attention. All together,
it could disintegrate into the cheesy
mush that afterschool specials and
Lifetime movies are made of, but it's
buoyed by Finn's catchy songs and
Sheinkin's snappy dialogue. With so
many likable, hilarious characters,

it's impossible to root for one char
acter to take home the prize.
As an amateur production,
Roble's "Spelling Bee" was not free
of some shaky vocals and less than
stellar acting. However, there were
many bright spots, including fresh
man Nitya Rajeshuni's frustrated,
overachieving Marcy Park, fresh
man Adam Rothman's sexually frus
trated Chip Tolentino (his rendition
of "My Unfortunate Erection"
might be one of the most hilarious
numbers in the show) and sopho
more Ben Shapero mucus-afflicted
William Barfee (it's Bar-FAY, get it
right).
"Spelling Bee" is also brilliant
in its use of audience participation.
Before the show, four lucky audi
ence members are selected to com
pete as spellers. It's not just a gim
mick; the participation of these four
random people is completely woven
into the script and yields some pret
ty comical moments.
Although "Spelling Bee" just
closed on the Great White Way two
years ago, its set up makes it the
perfect show for a small, low-budg

et production. Roble's simple, small
stage is unassuming and would be
unfit for fancy, complicated per
formances. However, the design of
"Spelling Bee" is rather minimal.
The spelling bee format eliminates
any complex scene changes or diffi
cult choreography, which would be
problematic on a stage of Roble's
size. "Spelling Bee" is also one of
many shows that have a brief inter
mission and less runtime.
Ultimately, the outcome of the
Putnam County Spelling Bee isn't
really important. It's about the six,
hapless oddballs who are thrown
together. And while "Spelling Bee"
isn't saying it's the coolest thing to
be a misfit, it also reassures us that
it's certainly not a bad thing either.
Catch "The 25th Annual Putnam
County Spelling Bee" on Thursday at
8 p.m. and Sunday at 2 p.m. in Roble
Theater.
