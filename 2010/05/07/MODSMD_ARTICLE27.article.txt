# Love Girl: What Gossip Girl Gets Right
##

There is evil in the world.
That shouldn't be a shock
er to any of you. According
to the world of "Gossip Girl,"

however, the world runs on such
evil. The characters on this show
and the contrived narratives they
reflect would be great examples in
Robert Sapolsky's Human
Behavioral Biology lecture. Yes,
they are that absurd.

To me, it is ironic that a show
called "Gossip Girl" fails so horri
bly to critique or even accurately
capture social norms. Perhaps this
season's shift of setting from high
school to college has scrambled

any sense of loyalty to the original
books and the title (because no
one ever gossips in college. We're
so above that, she said parentheti
cally). The community of "Gossip
Girl" is so disparate that you can't
even really divide them into cute
sie teams like "Team Big Ho" and
"Team Little J." What "Gossip

Girl" does trade in surprisingly
well are interpersonal romantic
relationships.

This struck me when I actu
ally enjoyed the recent episode,
"Dr. Estrangedlove." (How great
are those titles, by the way?) Blair
flirts with a Columbia hottie at a

Brooklyn party only to experience
a genuine emotion: a sense of loss
and wistfulness for her recently
dashed love affair with Chuck
Bass. As she declares in a refresh
ingly gentle tone, "I suddenly real
ized that the way to get over you
isn't by hooking up with some

random guy, or pretending like

we didn't happen. You and I loved
each other. And then you broke
my heart. I'm doing everything
possible not to face that fact," I
was moved by and alerted to my
attachment to the couple.
Referring back to Human
Behavioral Biology, I would say
that Chuck and Blair are like an
enzyme and its substrate: the
enzyme has a specific shape that
matches to one substrate and
allows it to fit. This is the main
tension of the show in that the

audience has an opinion of who
fits with whom. They either
pledge allegiance to the seemingly
arbitrary whims of the show's

writers or think that they know
better. This investment in the

show explains why the parental
figures are so inherently dull
because they are married and
stuck in their pairings, or because
we don't think old people are
capable of love. It's probably a lit
tle bit of both.

In the same vein, the constant
reshuffling of couples in "Gossip
Girl" frustrates viewers most

because we care about the roman
tic pairings most. "Gossip Girl"
has, arguably, cast its relationships
as products of psychology and the
past. For example, Rufus and Lily
love each other because they asso
ciate each other with happier,
simpler youths; Serena and Nate
love each other because they

popped each other's cherries;

Blair and Chuck love each other
because they both come from

broken homes. Human Behavioral
Biology can explain why Dan and
Vanessa are such a perversion of
love: pseudo-kinship, the idea that
you learn to identify those you
were raised alongside as relatives
and therefore have no desire to
mate with any of them. The disre
gard with which the writers of
this show throw couples together
in one-night-stands directly con
tradicts the protracted artifice of
courtship and trial-and-error
established in the first season.
One critique of my logic here

is the critique of '"shippers," tele
vision viewers who invest in a

show only for the inevitable
romantic relationships. The most
prominent example in recent tele
vision memory lies in the viewers
of NBC's "Chuck," computer sci
ence nerds who are convinced

that the show only fulfills their
fantasy when nerdy Chuck and
hottie Sarah get together. In
February, when the characters of
Chuck and Sarah dated other

people, these bloggers threatened
to boycott the show. The couple
reconciled within a few episodes
not because they reacted to
these drama queens, but because
they knew what they were doing.
This event represented another
failure of the serial form in an

uneducated public. To a certain
extent, "Gossip Girl" viewers have
to be 'shippers since, as we have
established, relationships and
clothes are the only good parts of

the show. We also have a right to
be 'shippers because the writers of
"Gossip Girl" are not nearly as
evolved or thoughtful as the writ
ers of "Chuck" (although both
were created by the same man,

Josh Schwartz ...).
I find it oddly comforting
that the trashiest of TV gets the
most important of human emo
tions right. The actions that cor
relate to those emotions on

"Gossip Girl" belong more tradi
tionally to soap operas than
primetime ... but I guess those
lines were blurred long ago. As
Sapolsky would say, the failures of
categorization. Or in this case, the
benefits.
