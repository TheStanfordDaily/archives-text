## Divestment debate heats up Senators discuss role of ASSU in global issues 
### ELLEN HUET DESK EDITOR 
A years-old debate is rising again re
garding student efforts to lobby the Uni
versity to divest from companies thought
to be contributing to human rights viola
tions in Israel.
Students supporting divestment and
students proposing investment in human
aid projects in the region have organized
campaigns whose public presence has
grown visibly over the last week, fueled by
a potential ASSU bill and a flyer cam
paign. The debate recalls past battles over
divestment at Stanford one decades
ago against apartheid in South Africa and
another three years ago, when the Under
graduate Senate voted on but failed to
pass a bill asking the University trustees to
reevaluate Stanford's investment choices.
Senate Dissolution Postponed
On Tuesday, the Senate voted down a
bill that would dissolve the current Sen
ate on May 11 to make way for the sena
tors-elect, effectively postponing the
transfer of office until the eighth week of
the quarter, two weeks behind schedule.
Although senators cited reasons such
as finalization of appropriations trans
fers, a green events checklist and an
ethics bills as rationales for postpon
ing the switch, Senator Mohammad
Ali 'lO called the postponement
mere "political theater" and said the
real reason for waiting was to avoid
letting the new Senate vote on a po
tential divestment bill.

As dictated by its bylaws, the
Senate is required to wait a week
before passing new legislation, and
since the Senate is not required to
meet past the ninth week of the
quarter, the postponement of disso
lution bars the incoming Senate
from passing any legislation before
the end of the academic year.
Although no divestment bill has
actually been authored, organizers
of Campaign Restore Hope (CRH),
a campaign for divestment from
four specific companies in the re
gion, have made their intentions
clear by distributing petitions to
many dorms on campus.
The petition asked students to
write a sentence of support for the
initiative and to deliver the petition
to their "dorm representative or
RA." Its listed goals included
"[passing] an ASSU bill urging our
University to disinvest from these
companies." The petition also lists
four specific companies two Is
raeli, one Egyptian and one Pales
tinian, according to Fadi Quran 'lO,
a CRH organizer.
Quran said CRH hopes to intro
duce a bill to the incoming Senate.
He characterized the senators-elect
as more likely to pass the bill than
the current Senate, calling current
senators "more isolationist," or
more likely to deal strictly with cam
pus issues.

"I think most of the incoming
senators truly care about human
rights issues, and I think they'll
probably support the bill," Quran
said.

Ali, also an organizer for CRH,
said the Senate may also want to
delay legislation until next year be
cause many of the original organiz
ers of the 2007 divestment bill will
then have graduated. He expressed
concern about the connection be
tween postponing dissolution and a
pending bill.
"Connecting a potential divest
ment bill with postponing the Sen
ate dissolution is unethical," Ali
said. "Making the incoming senators
wait to start their term denies them
experience and is putting them at a
severe disadvantage."
Two Campaigns Develop
After the Senate's decision on
Tuesday not to dissolve on May 11, it
remains unclear if CRH will contin
ue to press for a Senate bill encour
aging the University to reevaluate
its investments.
"We haven't made our final deci
sion yet," Quran said on Thursday.
"The most important thing in the
next four weeks is educating the
campus on our goals and proposed
solutions."
In the meantime, Invest for
Peace (IFP), a student coalition with
ties to Stanford Israel Alliance
(SIA), has begun a campaign to en
courage students to support on-the
ground relief in the region. IFP cre
ated a blog and a Facebook page
earlier this week. CRH has a similar
Web presence.
CRH's goals, as explained on its
website and petitions, include three
efforts: educating the University on
the issue to increase dialogue, en
suring the University is not aiding

companies that are committing
human rights violations and devel
oping "new creative ways to help
end this conflict."

In addition to distributing peti
tions to residences earlier this week,
CRH held a teach-in on Thursday
evening in Toyon Hall part of the
coalition's education-outreach ef
fort.

CRH has also expressed plans to
present a research document to
Stanford's Advisory Panel on In
vestment Responsibility (APIR), a
board that advises the University
trustees on investment choices.

On Monday, Quran said CRH
planned to present a document
sometime "in the next one or two
weeks" with research information
about companies that potentially
were violating human rights. He said
on Thursday, however, that CRH's
plans have been changing rapidly in
the past week as the situation
evolves.

CRH is also expanding the num
ber of companies it is researching
beyond the four specified in the pe
tition.

Ali said on Monday that CRH
was "more hopeful" about making
progress with APIR, and called the
possibility of a Senate bill passage a
more "symbolic" action.
IFP's goals also include educat
ing the University on the subject, as
well as channeling discussion "to
ward effective action" and inspiring
students to support on-the-ground
efforts in the area. IFP is co-spon
soring Challah for Plunger this
week, and its next goal is to raise
$l,OOO by next week for relief ef
forts.

IFP organizer Yishai Kabaker'lo
said IFP works to "guide people to
donate for the cause," characteriz
ing the campaign as "grassroots."
"We don't think we need to go
through the ASSU," he said.
IFP expressed concern with
CRH's petition, saying the research
points for some of the companies
were not properly substantiated
through the citations provided.
Kabaker said while IFP supports
CRH's efforts to increase dialogue
and awareness of the issue, "IFP is
fundamentally opposed to divest
ment, which is part of Campaign Re
store Hope's goals."
Quran, however, called any offi
cial action to disinvest from possible
human rights violations "may be
just symbolic, but still important."
"If you can give 50,000 students
hope, that's a miracle," he said. "The
only thing [CRH cares] about is
ending human rights violations."
Divestment and Universities Collide
It's not a new phenomenon for
universities to take a stance on in
ternational issues through divest
ment. In 1977, Stanford divested
from companies in South Africa in a
show of solidarity against apartheid,
and again in 2005 from companies
invested in Sudan.
In 2007, a divestment bill pushed
by Omar Shakir 'O7, then president
of Students Confronting Apartheid
in Israel (SCAI), made it to a vote
in the Senate, but failed to pass.
Five senators voted against, three
voted in favor and five abstained
from voting on a bill that encour
aged the University trustees to
reevaluate Stanford's investment
choices in Israel.
"[The 2007 divestment bill] ef
fectively dominated Senate discus

sion for four or five weeks and put
any other agenda on hold," said Sen
ate Parliamentarian Alex Katz 'l2.

In April, UC-Berkeley's student
government also voted on a bill urg
ing the school to divest from two
contractors with the Israeli military.
The debate sparked intense debate
on the campus and attracted media
attention nationwide. The student
senate voted 16-4 in favor of the
bill.

"Berkeley's [pro-divestment]
campaign had good goals in mind
but didn't consider how emotional
the subject is, which made the situa
tion worse," Quran said, noting that
CRH hopes to make discussion of
the issue more "comfortable" with
the campaign's approach.

One senator-elect, Rebecca
Sachs 'l3, said she did not think a di
vestment bill in the Undergraduate
Senate would meet support "not
after the way it met such resistance
at Berkeley."
"I'm incredibly disturbed and
scared that it's coming up again,"
she said. "It's such a divisive issue on
campus."

Current senators differ on
whether or not divestment is an
issue that the Senate should consid
er at all.

"Senate has no mandate to legis
late on this issue," said Senate Chair
Varun Sivaram 'll. "It's not a cam
pus issue, and there's no clear cam
pus sentiment. The incoming Senate
is 14 new freshman senators who
campaigned on campus issue advo
cacy. There's no significance to pass
ing the bill."
But Ali stressed that a bill's pas
sage could have symbolic signifi
cance that should not be ignored.

"This has been done before, with
South Africa and Sudan," he said.
"The students have a voice and
we're the most likely group to alter
the status quo."
Larry Diamond, a senior fellow
at the Hoover Institution, weighed
in on the issue, saying he found the
issue of divestment an "inappropri
ate" issue for student government.
"It's extremely divisive," he said.
"It's hurtful to one community ei
ther way."

He doubted the University
would take action even if a bill
passed the Senate.
"I don't think the University will
agree to divest look at what hap
pened at Cal," he said. "The Univer
sity has made it clear that divest
ment would only happen rarely and
in response to a clear impetus. It
might happen, but in this case, I
can't see that it would."
After the senators-elect were
chosen in April, Diamond took
them to dinner, during which he dis
cussed the issue of divestment and
put forth an argument that divest
ment was an inappropriate strategy
in Israel.

"I presented to them thoughts on
divestment and provided a histori
cal perspective," Diamond said. He
held a similar dinner with senators
this time last year.

"The dinner covered how divest
ment was a compelling and appro
priate strategy for apartheid in
South Africa, but I believe it should
be a rare strategy in this type of sit
uation," Diamond said. "It's certain
ly not a one-sided and uncomplicat
ed defense of Israel."
