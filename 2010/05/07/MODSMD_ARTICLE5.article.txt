# ONE MORE KILL
## Cardinal plays for NCAA title on Saturday 
### CAROLINE CASELLI DESK EDITOR 
Last night, the No. 1 Stanford
men's volleyball team swept the
No. 4 Ohio State Buckeyes (22-8)
in the NCAA semifinals, keeping
its storied season and national
championship aspirations alive.
Playing host to both the semifi
nals and the national title game,
Maples Pavilion was transformed.
Blue and red sport court tiles cov
ered the wooden floors, barriers
reading "2010 Men's Volleyball
Championship" surrounded the
court and television cameras hov
ered in the background. But amid
the glitz and glamour of the NCAA
Tournament, the Cardinal (23-6)
kept its cool.
"We looked at it as just another
game in Maples," said senior All-
American setter and American
Volleyball Coaches Association
(AVCA) National Player of the
Year Kawika Shoji. "There were
some cameras and some more peo
ple in there, but I think we all did a
really good job of focusing on the
court and not getting too distract
ed."

After a brief video welcome fea
turing several Stanford players
aired on the overhead screens, the
starting lineups were announced
and the match commenced.

The first game set the tone for
the majority of the match: toughly
served balls, dominant blocking,
all-out defense and powerful
swings from two well-matched
teams. The teams went back and
forth for the duration, with one
squad taking a one-point lead and
the other re-tying the game.

But the Card took control near
the end of the set as sophomore
outside hitter Brad Lawson served
two aces in a row, senior opposite
Evan Romero killed a ball off a
Buckeye's chest and junior outside
hitter Spencer McLachlin stepped
in to assist a Lawson kill from the
back row. To give the Card set
point, sophomore middle blocker
Gus Ellis blocked a ball, which was
then dug by Ohio State's libera be
fore Ellis put it down for the kill.
With no blockers in sight, Romero
killed a ball to the deep cross cor
ner, winning the set 30-25.

"We're excited that we were
able to step up our game late in the
first game to kind of extend the
lead," said head coach John Kosty.
"And then we played Stanford vol
leyball. We served well and we
passed well; and that's what this
team is all about."

Similar to the first set, the Buck
eyes won the first point of the sec
ond set, only to have Stanford re
turn a string of powerful plays.

Romero came alive, putting down
consecutive kills followed by two
Romero-Ellis roof blocks to bring
the score to 5-2.

Ohio State took advantage of
Stanford errors Romero had
one particularly wild serve that al
most ended up in the student sec
tion — and put up a consistently
solid block to keep the score close.

Yet Stanford could not be con
tained. After Romero slammed a
powerful kill down at 17-13, he
turned around to his team yelling,
"Let's go!" His words ignited the
team; soon after, senior middle
blocker Garrett Werner pounded a
ball against a Buckeye's shoulder
and a Lawson tip was shanked into
the stands by the Buckeyes. An
Ohio State hit landed just out, and
the Card took the second set, 30-26.
"I was a little wild my freshman
year, but the coaches had extreme
patience with me," Romero said,
reflecting on his on-court passion.
"They've helped me with different
tools to control it and be able to
bring something different. I'm glad
that I'm able to bring some fire to
the team."

The third set opened with a
sneaky Kawika Shoji dump on the
second ball, and the game re
mained in Stanford's favor for the
duration. The Card went on a run,
with a solo block from McLachlin,

a massive Ohio State net violation
and a four-person joust at the net
from which Lawson emerged victo
rious.
Ohio State had its fluke points
—an over-passed dig that went
down for the kill but Stanford's
scrappy defense and athletic play
prevailed. Sophomore libera Erik
Shoji had multiple one-handed

digs to keep the ball in play, while

his brother Kawika put up a one
handed back set for Romero to kill.
As the Stanford team got hotter
as the match persisted, Ohio State
showed signs of collapse. The
Buckeyes missed two serves late in
game three following long Stan
ford runs, and the Cardinal front
line used Ohio State's block time
