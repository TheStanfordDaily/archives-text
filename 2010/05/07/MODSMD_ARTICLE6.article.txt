## FACING THE TOP DAWGS 
### KABIR SAWHNEY DESK EDITOR 
In its last nonconference game of the reg
ular season, Stanford's softball team did not
fail to impress, beating Santa Clara for the
second time this season. The No. 15 Cardinal
(33-14,5-10 Pac-10) played strong offensive
ly and defensively, coming away with a 7-0
win.

The offense got a quick lead, scoring one
run in the bottom of the first inning, before
expanding that lead with four runs in the bot
tom of the third on home runs by freshman
shortstop Jenna Rich and freshman desig
nated player Alix Van Zandt. The Card
tacked on two more runs in the bottom of the
sixth to put the game firmly out of reach for
the Broncos.

Once again, the heart of Stanford's lineup
was called upon to provide most of its offen
sive spark. Sophomore second baseman
Ashley Hansen, junior third baseman Shan
non Koplitz, Rich and senior catcher Rosey
Neill collectively had five RBIs and went 5-
12.

Stanford's defense was also solid, with no
errors in the game. By contrast, Santa Clara
had three errors, which led to two unearned
runs.

Like their defense, Santa Clara's pitchers
struggled to contain Stanford's lineup.
Starter Kaitlyn Rauschnot gave up four
runs on five hits after two innings (in
cluding facing three batters without get
ting any outs in the third inning). Her re
placement, Ali Nash, fared slightly bet
ter — over four innings, she gave up
three hits and three runs, one earned.
While Stanford's pitchers were
strong as well, the most important de
velopment was the return of freshman
Teagan Gerhart to the circle. She
pitched two innings to close out the
game, her first action since sustaining an
injury three weeks ago. Prior to her in
jury, Gerhart had been the ace of Stan
ford's staff, with a record of 22-6 and an
ERA of 1.67.
Junior Ashley Chinn, the Card's
starting pitcher, went five innings and
gave up six hits and no runs.
The Cardinal will now turn its atten-

tion to its next Pac-10 series, a three
game set against No. 1 Washington (40-
5,12-3). The Huskies have held the top
spot in the national rankings all season,
and currently lead the Pac-10 by two
games over Arizona and UCLA.
Though Washington will surely put
up stiff competition, Stanford will
need to do well to improve its position
in the conference. It currently stands
in seventh place, a game behind Cali
fornia and three games behind fourth
place Arizona State, but still has a
chance to end the season in the middle

of the Pac-10.
"Each and every team in our confer
ence is a high caliber team," Hansen
said. "That's what makes Pac-lOs so ex
citing; every team has the opportunity
to beat the other team on any given
day."
The two teams enter the series with
big differences in momentum. Wash
ington has not lost a Pac-10 series all
year, and has won its last four games (in
cluding a sweep over Oregon State).
Meanwhile, the Cardinal has lost nine
of its last 10 games against conference
opponents since April 11, Stanford
has only won three games, two of which
were against nonconference foes Santa
Clara and San Jose State.
"Our team expectations are pitch
ing, defense and timely hits," Hansen
said. "Keeping their hitters off guard
with our pitching and making the de
fensive plays will set us up to win a close
game."
The Stanford pitching staff will
struggle to control the powerful Husky
offense, even if Gerhart returns to her
pre-injury form. Washington boasts a

lineup that is both formidable and bal
anced. Outfielder Kimi Pohlman is hit
ting .380 from the leadoff spot and has
17 stolen bases in 20 attempts. Catcher
Shawna Wright, hitting from the
cleanup spot, has provided much of the
Huskies' power, with 10 home runs and
43 RBIs. Pitcher Danielle Lawrie is also
a superb hitter, with 11 home runs and
43 RBIs as well.
While Chinn and Gerhart will be
counted on to contain this explosive
ness, the Stanford offense will look to
find any fla sws it can in Lawrie's pitch
ing. In 35 appearances this season, she
has a record of 30-2 and a miniscule
ERA of just 0.98. She has also thrown
29 complete games and is holding op
posing lineups to a .144 batting average,
with a strikeout-to-walk ratio of almost
13-to-l.
Lawrie was also named one of the
Pac-10's Players of the Week last week
after allowing just one run total over a
three-game series against Oregon
State.

"Danielle Lawrie is a dominant
pitcher," Hansen said. "The key to beat

ing her is going to be getting runners on,
moving them into scoring position and
getting [those] one or two timely hits
when we need it the most."
Stanford will play Washington in

Seattle, Wash, on May 7-9. Friday's
game will start at 6 p.m.

lineup that is both formidable and bal
anced. Outfielder Kimi Pohlman is hit
ting .380 from the leadoff spot and has
17 stolen bases in 20 attempts. Catcher
Shawna Wright, hitting from the
cleanup spot, has provided much of the
Huskies' power, with 10 home runs and
43 RBIs. Pitcher Danielle Lawrie is also
a superb hitter, with 11 home runs and
43 RBIs as well.
While Chinn and Gerhart will be
counted on to contain this explosive
ness, the Stanford offense will look to
find any fla sws it can in Lawrie's pitch
ing. In 35 appearances this season, she
has a record of 30-2 and a miniscule
ERA of just 0.98. She has also thrown
29 complete games and is holding op
posing lineups to a .144 batting average,
with a strikeout-to-walk ratio of almost
13-to-l.
Lawrie was also named one of the
Pac-10's Players of the Week last week
after allowing just one run total over a
three-game series against Oregon
State.

"Danielle Lawrie is a dominant
pitcher," Hansen said. "The key to beat

ing her is going to be getting runners on,
moving them into scoring position and
getting [those] one or two timely hits
when we need it the most."
Stanford will play Washington in

Seattle, Wash, on May 7-9. Friday's
game will start at 6 p.m.
