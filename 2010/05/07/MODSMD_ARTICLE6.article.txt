In its last nonconference game of the reg
ular season, Stanford's softball team did not
fail to impress, beating Santa Clara for the
second time this season. The No. 15 Cardinal
(33-14,5-10 Pac-10) played strong offensive
ly and defensively, coming away with a 7-0
win.

The offense got a quick lead, scoring one
run in the bottom of the first inning, before
expanding that lead with four runs in the bot
tom of the third on home runs by freshman
shortstop Jenna Rich and freshman desig
nated player Alix Van Zandt. The Card
tacked on two more runs in the bottom of the
sixth to put the game firmly out of reach for
the Broncos.

Once again, the heart of Stanford's lineup
was called upon to provide most of its offen
sive spark. Sophomore second baseman
Ashley Hansen, junior third baseman Shan
non Koplitz, Rich and senior catcher Rosey
Neill collectively had five RBIs and went 5-
12.

Stanford's defense was also solid, with no
errors in the game. By contrast, Santa Clara
had three errors, which led to two unearned
runs.
