# LONG BEACH CHALLENGE

### KABIR SAWHNEY DESK EDITOR 
After snapping its four-game losing streak
earlier in the week against Santa Clara and
San Jose State, the Stanford baseball team will
head down to Long Beach, Calif, this weekend
for a three-game series against Long Beach
State.

Despite their mediocre record, the 49ers
(20-21) should still present a significant chal
lenge to the Cardinal (23-17, 10-8 Pac-10).

Freshman leadoff hitter Tyler Gaffney (above)
will need to get on base early for Stanford's
offense to break out of its current slump.
Gaffney went 4-14 in Stanford's last series.

They have played three series against other
Pac-10 opponents they took two games
from both Oregon State and Arizona, but lost
two out of three games to Washington.
Long Beach State has also played single
games against a multitude of other Pac-10 op
ponents. It has lost games to Oregon and
USC, and has gone 1-1 against UCLA.
The 49ers are entering the weekend on a
three-game losing streak. After beating Cal
Poly in the first game of a series last weekend,
they dropped two straight games to the Mus
tangs before losing a midweek game at Pep
perdine on Wednesday.

Stanford will try to use this series as away
to regain some momentum heading into its
last three Pac-10 series against Washington
State, No. 22 Arizona and No. 2 Arizona State.
A sweep at the hands of Washington last
weekend saw the Card drop out of the nation
al rankings.

This series will not help Stanford in its
quest to climb back into contention for the
Pac-10 title, as Long Beach State is a noncon
ference opponent. The Cardinal currently sits
in fourth place in the conference standings,
tied with No. 18 Oregon and four games be
hind the Sun Devils.

For Stanford to win this series, it will need
to get much better production from its of
fense. Against Washington, the Cardinal line
up fell flat, scoring a total of six runs in the se
ries. In its previous two series, sweeps over
Oregon State and California, the offense was
the driving force behind Stanford's success
it scored 58 runs combined in those six games.
Two Cardinal hitters in particular will need
to come out of slumps this weekend fresh
man right fielder Tyler Gaffney and junior
first baseman Jonathan Kaskow. Entering this
series, Gaffney, the leadoff hitter, has a .338 av
erage with 17 RBIs. However, he was fairly in-

effective against the Huskies, going 4-14 with
no RBIs. His ability to get on base early will be
critical to improving Stanford's offensive per
formance.

Kaskow has been the bedrock for the Car
dinal all season. His .402 average, recently
from the cleanup spot, leads the team; but like
Gaffney, he struggled against Washington,
going 1-11 for the series.

Fortunately for Stanford, Long Beach
State's pitching staff has not played strongly
for much of the year. In its last four games,
49er pitchers gave up 40 runs, including 16
runs to Cal Poly last Sunday.
