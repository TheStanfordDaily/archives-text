## PEAKERS AND EVENTS Matisyahu inspires, awes with songs and stories Jewish reggae star entertains audience with unique music blend 
### ADAM COLE STAFF WRITER 
Jewish reggae hip-hop artist Matisyahu left audience
members in awe last night at Memorial Auditorium after
a two-hour program of song and discussion.
Matisyahu appeared with his long, curling peyos
tucked behind his ears and the tassels of his prayer shawl
trailing from under the hem of his plaid shirt and blue
suit jacket. Accompanied only by an amplified acoustic
guitar, he opened the show with "Estimated Profit" by
the Grateful Dead, reading the lyrics off his iPhone.
"That was the song that was playing when I ran off the
road with a friend during an acid trip," he later explained.
"I've been waiting my whole career to perform that song,
and this is the moment."

The concert, hosted by the Stanford Speakers Bu
reau, Hillel at Stanford and the Jewish Student Associa
tion, was casual, with Matisyahu and his guitarist, Adam
Weinberg, sitting on stools as if they were performing at
a dorm talent show. They joked with audience members
and picked their songs from suggestions shouted out by
the crowd. The duo soared through "Thunder,"
"Jerusalem," "On Nature" and "Youth," closing each
song with a few minutes of vigorous beatboxing.
Halfway through the set, the crowd began to settle.
Matisyahu removed his jacket and lifted the microphone
from its holster to hold it closer to his lips.
"I wasn't expecting him to be so captivating," said Ke
haunani Gunderson 'l2. "His voice was everywhere."
"He speaks through his music," explained Jonathan
Hirshon of Santa Clara, who has studied Jewish history
with Matisyahu. "When he took his jacket off, you could
tell he had become himself. His eyes were closed; he was
deep in it and that was really him."

After "Youth," Matisyahu started to tell stories as
Weinberg shook out his tired fingers. Loosely guided by
questions from the audience, he mused aloud about
recreational drug use, Jewish pirates, his newfound veg
anism and his approach to making music. He also
spoke at length about a theme that rests at the heart of
his songs his immersion in Hasidic Judaism.
"When I was in college, I was interested in finding out
who I am, and I figured I should start with my own reli
gion," he said. "I wanted to develop my relationship with
God, who I believe in in a very real way. I wanted to have
a life that was not at odds, not bouncing back and forth. I
wanted something serious. What I found was Judaism."
Matisyahu started attending synagogue and learning

from a rabbi. One day he was given a
yarmulke, also known as a kippah,
and started wearing it.
"I nearly gave my parents a heart
attack," he said. "They were like,
'First it was dreadlocks, then sandals,
now with the yarmulke.' But for the
first time I felt I was representing my
true identity. I wasn't getting lost in
the blankness."

The concert was well attended by
Stanford's Jewish community, as evi
denced by the number of yarmulkes
bobbing up and down to the beat of
Matisyahu's lightning-quick lyrics.
Rabbi Mychal Copeland of Stanford
sat in the second row and sang along
with "Jerusalem."
"He is an amazing blend of differ
ent worlds," she said after the con
cert. "He does what he does with in
credible grace."
One audience member asked how
Matisyahu found his characteristic
sound, a blend of reggae, ska, rock
and hip-hop.

"I wasn't really searching for it,"
he replied, and nodding at Weinberg,
transitioned into a second set.
The audience was quiet as they
played some of Matisyahu's most fa
mous hits, including "One Day" and
"King Without a Crown." The pair
closed the night with a 20-minute im
provised song featuring picking by
Weinberg and fluid rhymes by Ma
tisyahu.

"You wanted to scream," Gunder
son said. "But I was speechless."
