## Bookstore to rent textbooks in fall

Textbooks for rent?
That may be the case fall quarter,
when the Stanford Bookstore says it
will join more than 500 other schools
in the country participating in Fol
lett's Rent-a-Text program, which

rents textbooks to students by the
quarter.

The scheme is new to Stanford's
bookstore, but has met with positive
response from students elsewhere,
said store director Janet Ciawley. who
claimed rental costs are half the "full
retail" book price.

This could be good news for stu
dents who have bought their text
books through the Stanford book
store in the past.

"Fall quarter, I bought my text
books here, but then I realized just
how expensive it was," said Rashee
dat Zakare-Fagbamila 'l3. "I'm on fi
nancial aid, but my financial aid
doesn't cover textbooks."
Zakare-Fagbamila said she or
dered her books from Amazon.com
the following quarter, which proved
less expensive, but came with a ship
ping delay. Gawley said rentable
books will be placed alongside new
and used texts for sale before the be
ginning of the term.
But it remains to be seen how
many titles will be available for rent
next fall, as Stanford's quarter begins
a month later, in some cases, than
other universities whose bookstores
buy texts from wholesalers.
Grawley cited the need for pro
fessors to submit their book requests
early as another factor in how the
rental program will fare.

is the same as purchasing them. Stu
dents can pay for the rented text
books via cash, debit or, if they are
on financial aid, the Stanford Card
Plan. The return policy for the text
books is the same, and students may
mark up the pages.
"However," Gawley said, "if the
book were to be totally destroyed,
then you would have to return the
rental and purchase a new copy at
full price."

"Our whole mission is to get as
many rented titles in and available
to students as possible," Gawley
added.
