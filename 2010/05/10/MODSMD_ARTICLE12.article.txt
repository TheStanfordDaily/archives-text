## UNFASHIONABLE NONSENSE Hindsight and the Importance of Being Earnestly Delusional About the Past 
### Emily Hulme 
We've all been there â€”or at least
nearby, in the area code. At the end
of a, well, at the end of an "any
thing" a class, a project, a relationship, a
dirt biking tour of Lake Lag during the rainy
season when all is said and done, we tally
up the mistakes we made. Should have paid
for a map, rather than winging it and ending
up paying an extra 20 dollars in gas and 40
minutes in sweet, sweet time. Should have
drank more water. Shouldn't have eaten the
fried egg and bacon pizza all in one sitting.
Should have brought more tampons. Should
have checked if the participle is "drank" or
"drunken" before sending in to be published.
But, alas, we tell ourselves, es muss sein, for
only hindsight is 20-20.
Well, I hate clich?s, and, on top of that, I'm
calling B.S. on this one. If hindsight is 20-20,
it's only through some thick, shatterproof,
rose-colored bifocals.

Sure, we can look back and decide we
should have picked door number three
rather than door number two, or forked left
rather than barreling along straight, but that
only really makes any sense in some abstract
universe devoid of consequence. So, you
could have turned into the CD section at Tar
get rather than running into that annoying
kid from high school you only saw because
you went into the electronics section first. For
all you know, there was a starving komodo
dragon waiting for you in between the clear
ance NOW albums and Carrie Underwood's
latest. Or, less dramatically, perhaps a best
friend-turned-frenemy was lurking there.
The only reason you think your choice was
particularly bad is because you don't know
how bad those other ones could have been.
And, while it might sometimes be true that
we hate the devil we don't know more than
the one we do, this applies if and only if we
think there's a devil to be found in the first
place. We glamorize the "could have been,"
with all its potential and without any known
repercussions, over the "really was." In hind
sight, sure, we see our options, but not in their
entirety.
That's not to say you can't ever look back
and think you made the wrong choice. It's

just that you have a pretty limited set of in
formation: the same choices, and only one
path taken.
And hindsight gets worse over time.
When I think about Freshman Orientation,
for instance, I think about all the excitement
surrounding meeting new people and find
ing my way around a new place. It's hard to
not look back with a smile and think that
only now do I know how lucky I was, and
how that girl I met across the hall would be
come one of my best friends, and how sign
ing up for this class or that one changed my
whole conception of life. But I'm not look
ing at the picture very well if that's all I see
I'm missing the part where I didn't know
a damn soul and missed my family and was
beginning to suspect it was going to be a
long year of disappointment with dorm
food. It's for our own sanity that we manage
to excise past stress from our memories
the present stresses are about enough
but it's also just not true that they were
never there. It's only when some pack of
overdressed freshmen leaving Donner asks
you where "Kappa Alpha" is that you re
member that once upon a time you, too, had
to be an awkward turtle dog paddling
through a sea of unfamiliar faces.
Memory is a beautiful thing, and beautiful
things tend to have a bit of accompanying ar
tifice to boost their natural aesthetic content.
Hindsight isn't 20-20. In fact, thank God it's
not.

Emily is currently making memories to manip
ulate into a fantastic "college was the greatest
time of my life" anecdote for the grandchildren.
