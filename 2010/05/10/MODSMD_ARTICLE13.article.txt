# THE 						GAO REPORT
## Celebration of Women 
### Shelley Gao 
The past weekend was a celebration of
women. Sunday, which was Mother's
Day this year, also happened to be the
50th anniversary of the birth control pill.
The Food and Drug Administration's an
nouncement of its intention to approve the
Pill on May 9,1960 was a tremendous step
forward. Despite the complex social
changes that resulted from introduction of
the Pill, it fundamentally allowed women to
have control over their own bodies and des
tinies. But, the Pill served only as the means.
As Elaine Tyler May, author of "America
and the Pill: A History of Promise, Peril and
Liberation" argues, the "revolutionary" po
tential of the Pill was achieved only when
coupled with the opportunities that resulted
from women's activism. It was the amalga
mation of means and opportunity that en
abled women to reexamine their roles and
reconstruct their lives.

At Stanford, we are privileged to access
an elite education that opens the door to
our aspirations and to study in an environ
ment that encourages women to succeed.
On Saturday, Cap and Gown, Stanford's
105-year-old Women's Honor Society, host
ed a luncheon for its actives and alumnae to
honor women's service to the community.
Actives President Ellen Cerf 'll spoke
about the women in her life who "rock it"

her grandmother overcoming gender barri
ers, her nanny making a life for herself and
her mother as a model of service. A recipi
ent of the Cap and Gown's "Take Action"
Scholarship, Sarah Mummah TO, discussed
how her founding of Dream Catchers, a pro
gram that addresses education inequality by
helping underserved middle school stu
dents in Palo Alto, has allowed her to dis
cover meaning in her college experience.
Surrounded by so many talented female
peers, professors, researchers, administra
tors and professionals at Stanford, it is ex
pected that women can achieve anything.
However, this does not mean that we
have any less doubt about our future. Given
all these resources available to Stanford
women, what exactly should we aspire to
be? How much do conditioning, societal ex
pectations and plain biology influence our
decision-making? How do we deal with en
trenched double standards? Can we be
both feminine and intellectually aggres
sive? How do we reconcile ambition and
domesticity? What are the tensions be
tween our roles in the "public" and "pri
vate" spheres? Is it possible to rise to the
top of our fields while at the same time ful
filling traditional family responsibilities?
Books, like the recent bestseller by Lori
Gottlieb 'B9 titled "Marry Him: The Case

for Settling for Mr. Good Enough" do not
making it any easier. We are the generation
that is supposed to have it all. But is it all ac
tually possible?
Sure, there are role models who make it
seem so easy. I was fortunate to spend some
time with a friend in Philly whose mom is
the epitome of the successful modern
woman. She is an incredibly gracious and
caring individual who seamlessly merges
her identities as a radio show host, produc
er of techno music, doctor and mother to
three wonderful kids into unified coher
ence. While there are certainly examples of
inspirational women in our lives, it is diffi
cult to gauge just how much compromise
was involved in their choices.

Interestingly, questions confronted by
women 40 years ago, in the 19705, resemble
the ones being asked today. Remarkable
parallels can be detected in the uncertain
ties entertained by the contributors to
"Working it Out: 23 Women Writers,
Artists, Scientists and Scholars Talk about
their Lives and Work," edited by Sara Rud
dick and Pamela Daniels. While advances
like the Pill and transformations in the in
tellectual establishment have profoundly
altered the experiences of female scholars
today, there is at times a common sense of
anxiety, paralysis and isolation felt by the
contemporary generation of educated
women. Concerns about how to lead an in
tegrated life, incorporate autonomous cre
ative work and reconcile the conflicts and
joys of "having a room of one's own" are
still relevant today.
As Stanford women, we have the respon
sibility to grapple with these challenges as
private individuals and future global lead
ers. The privilege of our education demands
that we make compromises to achieve
greater goals on behalf of women every
where. So, here's to celebrating our achieve
ment and, more importantly, our potential.
