## Campaign Restore Hope and Invest for Peace 
### FADI QURAN '10 Campaign Restore Hope YISHAI KABAKER '10 Stanford Israel Alliance 
In recent weeks two new efforts have
launched onto the campus scene. Campaign
Restore Hope and Invest for Peace both at
tempt to address the Israeli/Palestinian con
flict from different angles. The campus dia
logue over our differing approaches has led
to misrepresentations and subsequent polar
ization among some of the supporters of both
campaigns.

As the leaders of both campaigns, we
hope to prevent divisive rhetoric from hin
dering genuine efforts to address the issues at
hand. In discussions between the leadership
of Campaign Restore Hope and Invest for
Peace, we have found that there is a lot of
common ground from which we can address
these issues openly and productively.
To avoid a shouting match between both
sides' talking points, we have chosen to shift
the discussion from the ASSU senate to a
more productive forum that's open to the
wider campus community. In doing this, we

are not trying to falsely cover up our differ
ences. Rather, we will use this forum to dis
cuss the complexity of the Israeli/ Palestinian
conflict and our distinct ways to address it on
the Stanford campus. We will not shy away
from difficult subjects or sharp disagree
ments, but will tackle them directly in a civil
and open manner that is fundamental to the
Stanford way. In doing so, we hope to educate
the broader Stanford community and pro
vide them with the tools to formulate their
own informed opinion on a conflict that is in
tegral to American foreign policy and values.
Over the next few weeks we will hold joint
events that will highlight both the human and
the policy components of this conflict. Two
will focus on introducing differing perspec
tives of the issue to the opposing sides of the
debate. This will allow both camps to under
stand the perspective of the other. The third
will be a debate of the policy and advocacy is
sues moving forward. With this, we hope to

diffuse much of the tension that has initially
built up over this issue.

We understand how difficult and emo
tional this issue can become. In light of that,
we believe that this method is in the best in
terest of both sides and the larger campus
community. We urge everyone to support this
joint effort and step back from their defen
sive positions.

Although we do not agree on how best to
approach the Israeli/Palestinian conflict, we
both agree on the necessity of genuine dis
course over standard talking points. Through
this effort, we believe that together we can
move one step closer towards ending vio
lence and human rights abuses in the region.
