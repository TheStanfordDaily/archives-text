# Honest debate and its enemies

### JOSH WEINSTEIN Graduate student in biophysics 
As a student, I felt humbled upon hearing
that the Stanford Israel Alliance (SIA) has
undertaken an Invest for Peace program. The
investment program seeks to do exactly what
SIA has always done: engage a geopolitical
conflict affecting the lives and safety of their
parents, siblings, cousins, and friends, but in a
collected manner that reaches out and en
gages the Stanford community, creating as
much of a positive difference as a group of
students possibly can. On Tuesday, May 4,
Yishai Kabaker published an Op-Ed that an
nounced his Invest-for-Peace strategy, which
has since been embraced warmly by the Stan
ford community.
Yet Mr. Kabaker made clear his appre
hension, shared by much of the Jewish com
munity, about the concurrent attempt by
Campaign Restore Hope (CRH), to launch a
divestment campaign. He did so with good
reason. CRH's predecessor, Students Con
fronting Apartheid in Israel, last engaged the
broader community by proudly hosting
Hezbollah apologists and other more "mod
erate" advocates for Israel's destruction.

Fadi Quran, who heads the current divest
ment push and saw these unfortunate events
unfold three years ago, sought to allay fears
in his Op-Ed on Wednesday, May 5. "This
campaign is different," he said. But he tem
pered this message with an avalanche of mis
leading generalizations, such as characteriz
ing the entire Palestinian Arab population as

prevented from accessing water. Mr. Quran
failed to qualify such statements with the
agent of action. While Israel moved rapidly
to either build or approve the building of new
wells for the Palestinian Water Authority, ful
filling its obligations under the Oslo 2 ac
cords in 1995, the Palestinian Authority
failed under its own obligations to provide
the requisite pipes, thereby rendering the
wells useless.

More generally, the fact that Prime Minis
ters Barak and Olmert offered full statehood
to Palestinian Arabs on more than 95% of
the land mass of the West Bank and Gaza, the
fact that these offers were not met by negoti
ations but by barrages of suicide bombings
and rocket attacks, and the fact that these at
tacks were what caused many of the restric
tions Mr. Quran laments is, to him and his
campaign, irrelevant. While Mr. Quran es
poused in his Op-Ed the ideal of not shying
from a debate on account of its complexity,
we may rest assured this is not the debate he
has engaged in.
The divestment program itself undertakes
similar subterfuge. It claims to draw from
universal values meted out with balance,
claiming on its website "to ensure that our
university is not invested in companies that
violate human rights in the region." This fails
any level of scrutiny. Four companies com
prise the roster of divestment, three of which
are not publicly traded, and for which divest

ment is therefore moot. What remains - the
only target of consequence - is the Israeli
company Elbit, whose equipment monitors a
fence that has successfully thwarted suicide
bombings against the citizens of Israel, Arab
and Jewish alike. In other words, divest
ment's target is Israel alone, with no regard
for those under the yoke of oppression by the
Saudi, Egyptian, Yemeni, Lebanese, Iranian,
Hashemite, Syrian, and other regimes of the
region whose abuses tower over Israel's.

And so while we are told that this cam
paign is about justice, it must be a concept of
justice that can retain its meaning without
apportionment. Indeed, this is because this
concept of justice isn't justice at all. This di
vestment campaign doesn't want to talk
about human rights; this divestment cam
paign just wants to talk about Israel.
The divestment campaign therefore re
calls the storied justification Harvard Presi
dent Lowell once gave in his attempt to place
an outright quota on the number of Jews ad
mitted by claiming that Jews cheat. But non-
Jews also cheat, he was told. You're changing
the subject, he replied, we're talking about
Jews.
Yes, this divestment campaign believes in
human rights, and yes, President Lowell be
lieved in academic integrity.
