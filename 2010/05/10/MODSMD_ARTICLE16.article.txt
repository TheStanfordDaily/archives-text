# CRONA's rejection of Hospital's offer
## 
### LORIE JOHNSON A nurse in Stanford Hospital's Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit, President of CRONA 
The Nurses of Stanford Hospi
tal and Lucile Packard Chil
dren's Hospital want you to
know why they overwhelming
ly rejected the hospitals "last,
best and final offer," and why
they are so disappointed with
the hospitals' refusal to negoti
ate with them.

The Committee for Recog
nition of Nursing Achievement
(CRONA) represents only
nurses who work at Stanford
and Packard, and has done so
for 40 years. We are the bedside
nurses at the two hospitals who
are with patients and their fam
ilies around the clock - includ
ing when the doctor is not there
- to care for your loved ones
when illness or injury strikes.
The hospital administrators
have properly recognized that
"our nurses are extraordinary."
As the hospitals have said in
the past, their nurses are "the
best-of-the-best," and the
"backbone of the hospitals."

Why then, after successfully ne
gotiating many contracts with
their nurses for the past 40
years, have the hospitals
walked away from the table -
refusing to work with us to re
solve our differences?

The hospitals say their "last,
best and final offer" includes
generous compensation and
benefit packages. The truth is
that although Stanford and
Packard nurses routinely treat
the sickest of the sick, their
wages and benefits are at or
below average for Bay Area
hospitals. But, the current dis
pute isn't about money. Rather,
it is about the dignity and role
of the nurses, and about pro
tecting what they already have.
What the hospital adminis
trators ignore is that their "last,
best and final offer" slashes by
half the period of time that the
hospitals pay for the medical in-
surance a nurse receives when she
becomes ill, injured or pregnant.
Their offer would force a nurse to
pay $lBOO a month for medical insur
ance for her family when she is out of
work and has no income. The irony
of cutting medical benefits for nurs
es, who provide medical care to oth
ers, would be almost laughable were
it not so potentially devastating to
our 2700 dedicated nurses and their
families.

The hospitals claim they are
merely trying to "redefine nursing
roles." While the nurses have always
been willing to discuss their roles
with the hospitals, the problem is
that the hospitals' "redefinition"
would reward nurses for publishing
papers and organizing meetings,
and demote nurses with decades of
experience caring for critically ill
patients. Redefining nursing roles
for the hospitals also means taking
away the nurses' input regarding
important issues of patient care. It's
no wonder that 90% of Stanford
and Packard nurses said "no" to the
hospitals' degrading proposal.

Sadly, it appears that the hospi
tals' proposal was conceived by ad
ministrators whose real goal is to
pay nurses less in the future. What
amount of money saved by cutting
pay could be worth the loss of
countless highly trained nurses? To
what extent are the hospitals' ad
ministrators willing to risk patient
care by demoting experienced nurs
es or forcing them out altogether?
On March 30th, the hospitals
presented the nurses with their
"take it or leave it" proposal. The
nurses soundly rejected that offer
and immediately asked the hospi
tals to come back to the table to ne
gotiate. The hospitals refused. The
nurses made a counteroffer, and
again implored the hospitals to
come back to the table. Once again
they refused.
To Stanford and Packard Hospi
tals we say, your nurses deserve bet
ter and so do your patients and
all the communities you serve.
"Take it or leave it" posturing is not
a solution to the current dispute.
Come back to the table and negoti
ate in good faith.
