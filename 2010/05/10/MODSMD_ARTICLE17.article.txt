# Understanding the last offer by the Hospitals

### PAMELA WELLS, RN, RNC, MSA, MSN Chief Nursing Officer Vice President of Patient Care at Lucile Packard Children's Hospital NANCY LEE, RN, MSN Chief Nursing Officer Vice President of Patient Care at Stanford Hospitals Clinics 
As members of the communi
ty served by Stanford Hospital &
Clinics and Lucile Packard Chil
dren's Hospital, many of you may
be following the ongoing con
tract negotiations between the
hospitals and their nurses' union,
the Committee for Recognition
of Nursing Achievement
(CRONA). As many characteri
zations of both CRONA and the
hospitals' administration have
been represented to the public,
we wanted to take the opportuni
ty to directly address the commu
nities we serve regarding these
negotiations.

Many of you who come to Lu
cile Packard Children's Hospital
and Stanford Hospital & Clinics
do so because these are world
renowned, academic institutions
where medicine is not just prac
ticed, but where it is developed,
advanced, refined and taught. It is
a source of tremendous pride to
provide care at such a hospital,
but at the same time it can be a

tremendous challenge.
From the outside, labor nego
tiations may seem to represent
nothing more than a basic tug-of
war over wages and other terms
and conditions of employment.
In fact, these current negotiations
represent the future of medicine
versus the past. The Last, Best
and Final contract offers from
Stanford and Packard Children's
hospitals to their nurses include
very generous compensation and
benefits packages; at the same
time, these contracts redefine
nursing roles according to new
and more modern standards and
criteria that have been accepted
by most other academic institu
tions. These criteria largely track
those adopted by the American
Nurses Credentialing Center.
As nurses ourselves, both of
whom have been in the industry
for more than 30 years, we be
lieve this new Professional Nurse
Development Program better re
flects and rewards continuing learn
ing, education and skills develop
ment by our nurses, and also ad
vances nursing practice at both hos
pitals to assure we are meeting or ex
ceeding expected patient outcomes.
Our nurses are extraordinary, and
we have no doubt that most of them
are not only able to qualify, but
would benefit personally and profes
sionally from doing so. Just as med
ical standards have evolved over the
years, so too must nursing standards.
Ultimately, it is the patients who
benefit most when nurses and hospi
tals share a common enthusiasm for
continuous improvement.
As industry leaders, Stanford and
Packard Children's hospitals do not
have the option to operate under
outdated standards of practice or
professional roles; doing so would
undermine everything we do, from
patient care, to research, education
and industry leadership. And, con
trary to the position that CRONA
has taken on these changes, we have
no doubt that it would be a disserv
ice to our nurses to suggest that they
should do anything but advance with
the industry much to the con
trary, our nurses must lead the indus
try. Being a nurse is extraordinarily
hard work, as those of us who have
spent our entire careers in this field

can attest. But to demand anything
less than the very best from every
member of our staff, would be a ter
rible disservice to our care teams,
our hospital, our caregivers in train
ing, and most importantly â€”to
the patients and potential patients
we serve.

The local community depends on
us for a superlative standard of care,
just as the greater community of
medicine nationally and interna
tionally looks to us to continually
advance best practices, procedures
and standards. Neither the hospitals
themselves, nor the many extraordi
nary nurses who work for us, stand to
gain by holding on to outmoded
models of practice.
We stand behind the Hospitals'
Last, Best and Final contract offers
because we stand behind the patients
we serve through our strict dedica
tion to the very highest possible stan
dards of patient care, patient safety
and caregiver performance. And we
most certainly stand behind our nurs
es, with the sincere hope that they will
recognize that the entire industry is
moving forward at a remarkable
pace, and that the hospitals' offers
promise to keep them and all the
patients we serve at the forefront.
