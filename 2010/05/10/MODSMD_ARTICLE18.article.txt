## How the Nationalization of Airport Security has Hurt America 
### Farbod Faraji 
The recent hullabaloo about the New York
"car bomber" serves as another reminder of
how plangently stupid the no-fly list is. The
individual who attempted to blow up an SUV in
the middle of time square was able to board an air
plane, even though he was on the no-fly list, be
cause airlines were only required to their update
lists every 24 hours. While the system has been
changed to require airliners to update lists every 2
hours now, there is a much more pervasive prob
lem with the status quo. It's the entire airport secu
rity system. After the nationalization of airport se
curity by Transportation Security Administration
(TSA), airport security has become less effective,
more expensive, and ultimately made American
citizens less safe.

The major mistake was made on November
19th, 2001. In the wake of the tragic and horrible
events of 9/11, there was significant pressure to
change airport security. Before the attacks airport
security was contracted out by the airlines to pri
vate screening firms who were responsible for se
curity checkpoints that passengers encountered
before boarding an aircraft. The Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA) set the standards and re
quirements that the private contractors had to ad
here to in order to provide their security service.
But in an effort standardize and introduce conti
nuity nationwide, the TSA was created and as
sumed all airport security responsibilities. Taken at
face value it all sounds logical and pragmatic, but

the evidence says the complete opposite.
A common way that security is tested is by
spontaneous weapons tests in which passenger im
personators attempt to walk through security
checkpoints with weapons and explosives. Private
screeners strove for a detection rate of 95%, their
standard falling between 80-90% detection. Now I
know what you're thinking, 'only 80% detection?
No wonder the terrorist were able to hijack those
planes.' But that is simply not true. In fact, the
weapons used to commandeer the planes were
short knives and box cutters, objects that were the
permitted given the FAA governmental regula
tions. In fact, the 9/11 commission report stated,
even if the items had been detected, they would
have been permitted and "returned to the owner."
The solution was to change the regulations, not
eradicate the system. But the bigger point is how
effective the TSA is not. A top TSA official stated
(on the condition of anonymity) that "we believe
we can get the true pass rate close to 65 percent."
The Homeland Security Inspector General's Of
fice and the Government Accountability Office
more optimistically stated that the failure rate was
25%. Regardless of which numbers are truly cor
rect, these statistics manifest how security has di
minished. The new system is less effective at catch
ing banned substances than the old.
And the most insane part of the equation is
how much more we are spending! In 2001, private
sector provided airport security was a $7OO million

a year business. The TS A's annual budget is around
$6 billion. We are paying more (MUCH MUCH
more) for less efficacious security. And this money
is vital for national security, it could instead be use
to help the FBI and CIA fight terrorism before it
reaches our airports.

Given this data, it's clear that the private firm
security system is superlative to the TSA in every
regard. And don't get me wrong, I usually love
government takeovers (I think the Axe and Palm
should be nationalized, can someone say govern
ment cheese?), but when it doesn't work it doesn't
work. Just think about it; if any firm in the private
sector failed 35% of tests, they would be out of
business. In the old system the airlines had more
incentive than anyone else to ensure that a proper
security apparatus was in place (it was their image
and business at stake), and the same incentives ex
isted for the security firms. The private system was
doing a better job. And in same way in which we
trust Raytheon and Lockheed Martin as defense
contractors to provide for our military, we can
trust private contractors for airport security, espe
cially if they are more vigilant and demand less of
taxpayers. The TSA has put in place a large bu
reaucratic system that is less accountable, less ef
fective, and has less pressure placed on it to suc
ceed. As hard as it is for me to admit this, we need
to let the free market produce the best security.
