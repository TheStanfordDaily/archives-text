# LETTER TO THE EDITOR
## 
### 
In the April 27 feature, "Unpaid in
Full," the writer describes the issues sur
rounding unpaid internships. The CDC
recognizes that there has been an in
crease in the number of questionable un
paid internships and we appreciate the
Daily helping raise student awareness
about these issues.

There are two points in the article that
I want to correct. First, the job market is
beginning to rebound and the number of
paid internships is increasing significant
ly. While there are always a few intern
ships that are extremely competitive,
many of the internships being posted are
not experiencing a high number of appli
cants. This is contrary to the image de
scribed in the article and I want to be sure
that students are not discouraged about
internship prospects for the summer.
Second, when students raise concerns
about the appropriateness of employer
activity, the CDC vigorously pursues the
students' concerns. If an employer is post
ing jobs illegally, the CDC will have the
employer remove the posting. While
staffing limitations prevent us from
screening the job postings, I would en
courage students to notify the CDC of
any concerns they have with employers
who recruit at Stanford University.

Sincerely,
LANCE CHOY
