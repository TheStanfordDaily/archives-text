## Trustees report from Yale Board retreat focused on residential colleges, arts 
### ERIC MESSINGER SENIOR MANAGING EDITOR 
Stanford's Board of Trustees report
ed Friday on their retreat to Yale Uni
versity, which Board Chair Leslie Hume
said provided a look at a "very differ
ent" institution.

Board members traveled to Yale's
campus in New Haven, Conn, to meet
with administrators and tour University
facilities and residences April 26-28.
According to Hume, the visit focused
on three aspects of Yale: its residential
college system, its support for the arts
and its efforts in global engagement.

Residential 'Safety Nets'
Yale represents a sharp contrast to
Stanford's model for undergraduate
housing and residential education. Yale
is organized along a system of 12 resi
dential colleges, and students are as
signed to a college for the duration of
their time as an undergraduate. Each
college has a master and a dean both
senior faculty members and provides
advising resources, academic program
ming and a dining hall to its members,
along with other unique facilities.
While students take courses along
with all other students on campus, they
retain their affiliation with their specific
college.

"They use those colleges to create
community cohesion and coherence in
the larger Yale community," Hume said.
"They're away of building connections
among a small group of people. They
serve in some ways as a safety net."

The board visited one residential col
lege that Hume described as typical,
containing a dance studio, pottery stu
dio, exercise room, 80-seat movie the
ater, photography darkroom and sever
al community art spaces.
Stanford, by contrast, has a more de
centralized model with a more diverse
range of housing options and a cor
responding reliance on shared Univer
sity facilities. While Hume said she and
the board "like the variety of housing
stock" at Stanford, this diversity con
strains Stanford's ability to provide
dedicated facilities or focused commu
nity building at the level of a residential
college.

"There's no way Stanford could
do anything like this," Hume said.
Hume also said that, in her view,
the residential college system provid
ed a different sense to the two cam
puses.
"If you look at these colleges, they
are walled-off, if you will, self-con
tained units," Hume said of Yale's of
ferings. "We are sort of open institu
tions people go outside, and they
go places across the campus."
A 'Proliferation' of the Arts
Hume also noted that Yale paid
particular attention to the integra
tion of the arts into residences and fa
cilities, pointing to one example of
the installation of stage lights in din
ing halls to allow them to be used as
performance spaces.
This attention to the arts, Hume
said, resulted in what one Yale stu
dent called a feeling of being "bom
barded" by the arts. She compared
this favorably to the goal of Stan
ford's arts initiative to make the arts
"inescapable" on campus.
Hume said that this "prolifera
tion" of artistic space on campus also
drew support from Yale's museums,
which are world-renowned, even for
a top university. As one example of
the integration of museums into stu
dent life and education, Hume noted
that there is an employee at Yale ded
icated to examining Yale's course of
ferings and looking for potential op
portunities to make use of museum
exhibits, holdings and collections in
classes.
"There's a multi-pronged effort at
Yale in the arts to do with space, to do
with faculty, to do with student en
gagement and to do with grant sup
port for students," Hume said.
Yale also has professional schools
of music, drama, art and architecture,
providing a level of administrative
support and dedication for these arts
that goes far beyond a single depart
ment.

To Hume, Yale's highly devel
oped and comprehensive commit-

ment to the arts was an indicator of a
difference in the highest priorities of
the two institutions, citing a similarly
strong level of commitment at Stan
ford to athletics that Yale did not
share.
Support for International Programs
On the subject of international
ization, Hume pointed to Yale's focus
on internships and grants for stu
dents, rather than dedicated overseas
programs, as a strong contrast to
Stanford's system.
Yale "is putting structures in place
that support and in some ways inte
grate what is going on on the campus
to do with international programs,"
Hume said. "And Yale has been very
intentional about doing that."
Hume pointed to some of Yale's
focuses as possible areas in which
Stanford could find itself expanding
in future years — potentially in lieu
of adding additional overseas cam
puses.
Divestment
Last, responding to a question
about whether or not the board
would take up a divestment discus
sion in the wake of recent student
campaigns on investment and divest
ment in the Middle East, Hume said
the issue, if brought to the board by
the student body, would fall under
the purview of an investment respon
sibility committee chaired by board
member Goodwin Liu '91.
The committee is "a forum for
dealing with issues exactly like this,"
Hume said.
Hume said the question was the
first time she had heard of the recent
campaigns.
Liu has been nominated by Presi

dent Barack Obama to a position in
the Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Ap
peals.
Taking Stock
The board retreat at Yale was
originally scheduled for last year, but
was postponed as Stanford attempt
ed to manage the budget crisis
brought on by the economic reces
sion. In the interim, one of the origi
nal reasons behind the trip assess
ing options for the expansion of the
size of Stanford's undergraduate
population faded as a central con
cern.
Hume said the idea of a visit, how
ever, still held appeal, as did the con
nections with top Yale administra
tors. Yale President Richard Fevin
'6B and Yale Provost Peter Salovey
'BO M.A.'BO are both Stanford alum
ni. In addition, The Yale Corporation
visited Stanford in 1999, and Hume
said the visit had focused on Stan
ford's undergraduate reforms as part
of the Campaign for Undergraduate
Education, of which she had served
as a vice chair.
"Yale, for a number of reasons,
seemed the logical place to go,"
Hume said.
Hume added that following its
visit, the board would not be provid
ing any overt direction to Stanford's
current Study for Undergraduate
Education (SUES), but that the
group would share its impressions
with the study's co-chairs, history
Prof. James Campbell 'B3 Ph.D. 'B9
and drama Prof. Harry Elam, when
they meet with them in June.
Hume said the trip was instructive
on the whole, and indicated that
Stanford's board may pursue similar
retreats in the future.
"Any time you go to a different
environment, you become much
more conscious of your own culture
and your own university environ
ment," Hume said. "You learn from
their best practices, but I think you
also learn what is particularly impor
tant and valuable about what you
have here."
"It's a very good thing to do once
in a while," Hume added.

with administrators and tour University
facilities and residences April 26-28.
According to Hume, the visit focused
on three aspects of Yale: its residential
college system, its support for the arts
and its efforts in global engagement.

Residential 'Safety Nets'
Yale represents a sharp contrast to
Stanford's model for undergraduate
housing and residential education. Yale
is organized along a system of 12 resi
dential colleges, and students are as
signed to a college for the duration of
their time as an undergraduate. Each
college has a master and a dean both
senior faculty members and provides
advising resources, academic program
ming and a dining hall to its members,
along with other unique facilities.
While students take courses along
with all other students on campus, they
retain their affiliation with their specific
college.

"They use those colleges to create
community cohesion and coherence in
the larger Yale community," Hume said.
"They're away of building connections
among a small group of people. They
serve in some ways as a safety net."

The board visited one residential col
lege that Hume described as typical,
containing a dance studio, pottery stu
dio, exercise room, 80-seat movie the
ater, photography darkroom and sever
al community art spaces.
Stanford, by contrast, has a more de
centralized model with a more diverse
range of housing options and a cor
responding reliance on shared Univer
sity facilities. While Hume said she and
the board "like the variety of housing
stock" at Stanford, this diversity con
strains Stanford's ability to provide
dedicated facilities or focused commu
nity building at the level of a residential
college.

"There's no way Stanford could
do anything like this," Hume said.
Hume also said that, in her view,
the residential college system provid
ed a different sense to the two cam
puses.
"If you look at these colleges, they
are walled-off, if you will, self-con
tained units," Hume said of Yale's of
ferings. "We are sort of open institu
tions people go outside, and they
go places across the campus."
A 'Proliferation' of the Arts
Hume also noted that Yale paid
particular attention to the integra
tion of the arts into residences and fa
cilities, pointing to one example of
the installation of stage lights in din
ing halls to allow them to be used as
performance spaces.
This attention to the arts, Hume
said, resulted in what one Yale stu
dent called a feeling of being "bom
barded" by the arts. She compared
this favorably to the goal of Stan
ford's arts initiative to make the arts
"inescapable" on campus.
Hume said that this "prolifera
tion" of artistic space on campus also
drew support from Yale's museums,
which are world-renowned, even for
a top university. As one example of
the integration of museums into stu
dent life and education, Hume noted
that there is an employee at Yale ded
icated to examining Yale's course of
ferings and looking for potential op
portunities to make use of museum
exhibits, holdings and collections in
classes.
"There's a multi-pronged effort at
Yale in the arts to do with space, to do
with faculty, to do with student en
gagement and to do with grant sup
port for students," Hume said.
Yale also has professional schools
of music, drama, art and architecture,
providing a level of administrative
support and dedication for these arts
that goes far beyond a single depart
ment.

To Hume, Yale's highly devel
oped and comprehensive commit-

ment to the arts was an indicator of a
difference in the highest priorities of
the two institutions, citing a similarly
strong level of commitment at Stan
ford to athletics that Yale did not
share.
Support for International Programs
On the subject of international
ization, Hume pointed to Yale's focus
on internships and grants for stu
dents, rather than dedicated overseas
programs, as a strong contrast to
Stanford's system.
Yale "is putting structures in place
that support and in some ways inte
grate what is going on on the campus
to do with international programs,"
Hume said. "And Yale has been very
intentional about doing that."
Hume pointed to some of Yale's
focuses as possible areas in which
Stanford could find itself expanding
in future years — potentially in lieu
of adding additional overseas cam
puses.
Divestment
Last, responding to a question
about whether or not the board
would take up a divestment discus
sion in the wake of recent student
campaigns on investment and divest
ment in the Middle East, Hume said
the issue, if brought to the board by
the student body, would fall under
the purview of an investment respon
sibility committee chaired by board
member Goodwin Liu '91.
The committee is "a forum for
dealing with issues exactly like this,"
Hume said.
Hume said the question was the
first time she had heard of the recent
campaigns.
Liu has been nominated by Presi

dent Barack Obama to a position in
the Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Ap
peals.
Taking Stock
The board retreat at Yale was
originally scheduled for last year, but
was postponed as Stanford attempt
ed to manage the budget crisis
brought on by the economic reces
sion. In the interim, one of the origi
nal reasons behind the trip assess
ing options for the expansion of the
size of Stanford's undergraduate
population faded as a central con
cern.
Hume said the idea of a visit, how
ever, still held appeal, as did the con
nections with top Yale administra
tors. Yale President Richard Fevin
'6B and Yale Provost Peter Salovey
'BO M.A.'BO are both Stanford alum
ni. In addition, The Yale Corporation
visited Stanford in 1999, and Hume
said the visit had focused on Stan
ford's undergraduate reforms as part
of the Campaign for Undergraduate
Education, of which she had served
as a vice chair.
"Yale, for a number of reasons,
seemed the logical place to go,"
Hume said.
Hume added that following its
visit, the board would not be provid
ing any overt direction to Stanford's
current Study for Undergraduate
Education (SUES), but that the
group would share its impressions
with the study's co-chairs, history
Prof. James Campbell 'B3 Ph.D. 'B9
and drama Prof. Harry Elam, when
they meet with them in June.
Hume said the trip was instructive
on the whole, and indicated that
Stanford's board may pursue similar
retreats in the future.
"Any time you go to a different
environment, you become much
more conscious of your own culture
and your own university environ
ment," Hume said. "You learn from
their best practices, but I think you
also learn what is particularly impor
tant and valuable about what you
have here."
"It's a very good thing to do once
in a while," Hume added.
