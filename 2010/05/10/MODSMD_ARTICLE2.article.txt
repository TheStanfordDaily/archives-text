## Trustees report from Yale Board retreat focused on residential colleges, arts 
### ERIC MESSINGER SENIOR MANAGING EDITOR 
Stanford's Board of Trustees report
ed Friday on their retreat to Yale Uni
versity, which Board Chair Leslie Hume
said provided a look at a "very differ
ent" institution.

Board members traveled to Yale's
campus in New Haven, Conn, to meet
with administrators and tour University
facilities and residences April 26-28.
According to Hume, the visit focused
on three aspects of Yale: its residential
college system, its support for the arts
and its efforts in global engagement.

Residential 'Safety Nets'
Yale represents a sharp contrast to
Stanford's model for undergraduate
housing and residential education. Yale
is organized along a system of 12 resi
dential colleges, and students are as
signed to a college for the duration of
their time as an undergraduate. Each
college has a master and a dean both
senior faculty members and provides
advising resources, academic program
ming and a dining hall to its members,
along with other unique facilities.
While students take courses along
with all other students on campus, they
retain their affiliation with their specific
college.

"They use those colleges to create
community cohesion and coherence in
the larger Yale community," Hume said.
"They're away of building connections
among a small group of people. They
serve in some ways as a safety net."

The board visited one residential col
lege that Hume described as typical,
containing a dance studio, pottery stu
dio, exercise room, 80-seat movie the
ater, photography darkroom and sever
al community art spaces.
Stanford, by contrast, has a more de
centralized model with a more diverse
range of housing options and a cor
responding reliance on shared Univer
sity facilities. While Hume said she and
the board "like the variety of housing
stock" at Stanford, this diversity con
strains Stanford's ability to provide
dedicated facilities or focused commu
nity building at the level of a residential
college.
