## Research projects get slice of PIE money 
### ERIN INMAN 
Stanford's Precourt Institute for
Energy (PIE) has granted $l.B mil
lion to six research projects pro
posed by faculty and students a
first for the 16 month old institute.

The Precourt Institute promotes
interdisciplinary energy research
and education, with the aim of pro
viding people with "ideas that can
transform the energy landscape for
the future," wrote Franklin Orr '69,
the institute's director and a petro
leum engineering professor, in an e
mail to The Daily.
Future energy challenges will
likely involve resources, conversion,
efficiency, markets and regulatory
structures, Orr said.
From a pool of 20 proposals, a
committee of energy faculty mem
bers chose six projects that span the
field of alternative energy, from
turning paper into supercapacitors
for grid-scale energy storage to
stimulation prediction models in en
hanced geothermal systems and de
velopment of a new high-tempera
ture proton exchange membrane
for fuel cells.

The grant for geothermal system
models supports the institute's in
terdisciplinary approach by bring
ing together the Stanford Geother
mal Program, led by earth sciences
Prof. Roland Home, and the Struc
tural Geology and Geomechanics
research group, led by earth sci
ences Prof. David Pollard Ph.D. '69.

Together, the groups will create a
new fracture, stress and flow model
ing approach that they hope "will
provide insight into the phenome
non of induced seismicity," as stated
in their grant proposal.
"Geothermal energy does have a
promising future, if it is not derailed

by the induced seismicity issue,"
Home wrote in an e-mail to The
Daily. "Geothermal (energy) is
baseload, meaning that it can run all
the time and is not subject to inter
mittency when the sun doesn't shine
or the wind doesn't blow."

A second interdisciplinary grant
was awarded to Yi Cui, professor of
material sciences and engineering,
and Zhenan Bao, professor of chem
ical engineering, who are trying to
create supercapacitor devices that
store energy by embedding nanos
tructure material in paper.
"Paper is porous; it has lots of
empty space," Cui said. "Paper sucks
up ink from pens. We're trying to do
the same with nanotechnology."
Thus far, the group has developed
a simple paper capacitor that powers
light bulbs and LEDs.
The long term goal is "to stack
paper together like a book to con
nect to an electric grid like a battery
that can store the grid's fluctuating
energy," Cui said.
If the grid storage is successful,
Cui is hopeful that paper capacitors
could even be used in portable elec
tronics.
Orr called the funding for proj
ects like Cui's and Bao's "seed fund
ing."
"They allow our creative faculty
and students to work on ideas that
might be too risky for conventional
funding sources, but have the poten
tial to have a significant impact on fu
ture energy applications," he said.
Successful projects funded by PIE
could compete for grants from the
National Science Foundation, the
Department of Energy and other
sources, according to Orr.
