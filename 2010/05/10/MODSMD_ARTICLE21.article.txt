### KABIR SAWHNEY DESK EDITOR 
Although it was playing against a
nonconference opponent, the Stan
ford baseball team still hoped to use
this weekend's series against Long
Beach State as away to regain some
momentum heading into the back end
of the Pac-10 season.

The Cardinal (25-18,10-8 Pac-10)
took the first two games from the Dirt
bags (21-23), but was denied the sweep
in the series finale.

Worryingly for Stanford, its offense
turned in mediocre performances for
the second weekend in a row. The Card
only scored 12 runs in the series, and
won its first two games largely on the
strength of its pitching and defensive
play.

The first game of the series, on Fri
day, was a low-scoring pitcher's duel.
Each starting pitcher lasted only six in
nings, but the relief squads of both
teams held the other side to no runs
and the game ended in a 3-2 Stanford
victory.

Stanford sophomore starter Brett
Mooneyham pitched well over his six
innings of work, giving up five hits and
two runs to the Dirtbags. He also struck
out nine batters. However, he threw
122 pitches in those six innings and was
pulled in favor of sophomore Brian
Busick. Mooneyham got the win, im
proving his season record to 2-5.
Busick shut down Long Beach
State for three innings, allowing just
one hit to earn his first save of the sea
son.
Long Beach State starter Andrew
Gagnon also threw for six innings, but
allowed three runs to the Cardinal. The
four pitchers out of the Dirtbag
bullpen were able to effectively con
tain Stanford for the last three innings
of the game, but the three runs off
Gagnon proved to be enough to seal
the Stanford victory.
Stanford was led offensively by
freshman first baseman Stephen Pis
cotty, who went 3-4 with a run scored.
The second game of the series was
just as close, with the pitching staffs of
both teams dueling into extra innings.
The Cardinal was able to prevail, 4-3, in
10 innings.
Once again, the focus was on each
team's starting pitcher sophomore
Jordan Pries for Stanford and Jake
Thompson for Long Beach State. Pries
went eight innings and gave up just two

runs, while Thompson went 8.2 innings
and gave up three runs.
For most of the game, both pitchers
were locked in a very tight battle. Each
team scored a run in the first inning be
fore the game settled down. Heading
into the ninth inning, Long Beach held
a slim 2-1 lead. The Card battled back,
taking a 3-2 lead on a home run by
freshman third baseman Kenny
Diekroeger.
The Dirtbags refused to give up,
scoring a run off junior reliever Alex
Pracher in the ninth to force extra in
nings.
In the 10th inning, a clutch pinch-hit
double by freshman Eric Smith scored
freshman center fielder Jake Stewart
from first base, giving Stanford a 4-3
lead. Freshman pitcher Dean McArdle
held the Dirtbags scoreless in the bot
tom half of the inning to give the Card
its second straight one-run win.
After the two pitcher's duels on Fri
day and Saturday, Sunday's game was
much more of an offensive shootout.
In the end, Stanford was unable to
match Long Beach State's firepower,
and fell 10-5.
After a scoreless first inning, the
floodgates opened on Stanford's fresh
man starting pitcher Mark Appel in
the second inning.The Dirtbags scored
five runs in the inning, knocking Appel
out of the game after just 1.2 innings in

his first start of the season.
The two pitchers sent in after
Appel, Busick and sophomore Chris
Reed, were little better at stopping the
Long Beach offense. Busick allowed
two runs while Reed allowed three,
sealing Stanford's fate.
Meanwhile, Stanford's offense was
unable to match the Dirtbags, as the
Cardinal scored five runs on eight hits
off starter Branden Pinder and could
not manage any more.
Stanford's two offensive stars,
freshman right fielder Tyler Gaffney
and junior designated hitter Jonathan
Kaskow, could not break through for
the Cardinal. Gaffney went 1-4
(though he did have two RBIs), while
Kaskow went 1-3.
The Cardinal will have little time to
recover, as it returns to the Farm to
play Santa Clara today before going on
the road to play San Jose State on
Wednesday. Its next Pac-10 series will
start on Friday against Washington
State.
Stanford will take on Santa Clara at
Sunken Diamond. First pitch is sched
uled for 5:30 p.m.
