# Card can't stop UW sweep
## No. 1 Washington allows just one run 
### KABIR SAWHNEY DESK EDITOR 
With the regular season coming
to a close, the Stanford softball team
headed to Seattle, Wash, this week
end, looking to move up in the con
ference standings. But standing in its
way was No. 1 Washington, the team
that has led both the conference and
national rankings for the entire sea
son.

The Cardinal (33-17,5-13 Pac-10)
played a tough series against the
Huskies (43-5, 15-3), but Washing
ton managed to prevail in all three
games. With its sweep, the Huskies
have clinched the regular season
conference title, while the Cardinal
remain in seventh place in the con
ference, just ahead of Oregon State.
While its pitching was quite
strong for much of the weekend,
holding the Huskies to three runs in
the last two games, the Stanford of
fense fell flat against Washington
pitcher Danielle Lawrie. The Card
managed to score just one run over
the entire series, a low point in a con
ference season marred by offensive
struggles.
The first game of the series was
undoubtedly the toughest one for
Stanford. Washington run-ruled the
Card 8-0 in five innings. The game
marks the second time all season
that Stanford has lost in five innings.
On the Washington side, Lawrie
no-hit the Cardinal in five strong in
nings, giving up just one walk and
hitting one batter.

Freshman Jenna Rich and senior
Shannon Koplitz combined to pitch
four innings for Stanford. Rich start
ed the game and pitched 3.1 innings,
giving up seven hits and seven runs
to the Huskies. Rich also had control
problems, walking four batters while
getting just two strikeouts.
Koplitz took over in the fourth

inning and got two outs while giving
up two hits and one run, while issu
ing two walks.
Neither player is a regular pitch
er Rich has started at shortstop
for much of the year, while Koplitz,
an infielder, has seen virtually no ac

tion in the circle all season.
Catcher Shawna Wright was the
offensive star for Washington. She
went 2-3 with five RBIs, including a
two-run home run in the third in
ning.
The second game of the series, on

Saturday, was a much closer contest.
Washington eventually prevailed 2-
1 thanks to another strong perform
ance from Lawrie.

The game was a scoreless pitch
er's duel through the first five in
nings. Junior pitcher Ashley Chinn
held her own against the Huskies,
giving up no runs and two hits in the
first six innings.
Stanford managed to get its first
hits of the series, with five over the
course of the game. It mounted a
short rally in the sixth inning, string
ing together a couple of hits to score
its single run.
Though Chinn had held Wash
ington in the sixth inning, she was
unable to preserve the shutout in the
seventh inning. Wright singled to
right field to open the inning, and
the next batter, Lawrie, hit a two-run
shot to right center that gave Wash
ington the walk-off win.
Sunday's game was another
tough battle between Chinn and
Lawrie. Both pitchers had shutouts
through seven innings, sending the
game into extra innings.

While Stanford's offense was un
able to make any headway in extras,
Washington eked out a run in the
bottom of the eighth to take its sec
ond straight walk-off win, this time
by a 1-0 score.
Chinn pitched 7.1 innings and
gave up five hits and the one eighth
inning run while striking out five.
Her record for the season now
stands at 8-8 after being charged for
losses on both Saturday and Sunday.
Perhaps contrary to expecta
tions, freshman pitcher Teagan Ger
hart did not return to the circle
against the Huskies. Prior to sustain
ing an injury against Arizona, Ger
hart was the ace of the Stanford
staff, and has been sorely missed
over the Card's last three confer
ence series. Gerhart pitched two in
nings last week against Santa Clara
and entered as a pinch runner twice
against Washington, but did not
pitch against the Huskies.
The Cardinal will hope Gerhart
can pitch next weekend at home
against Oregon in its last conference

series of the regular season. Stan
ford will need to play well against
the Ducks to salvage a finish close to
the middle of the conference and its
top-25 ranking.

The Cardinal (33-17,5-13 Pac-10)
played a tough series against the
Huskies (43-5, 15-3), but Washing
ton managed to prevail in all three
games. With its sweep, the Huskies
have clinched the regular season
conference title, while the Cardinal
remain in seventh place in the con
ference, just ahead of Oregon State.
While its pitching was quite
strong for much of the weekend,
holding the Huskies to three runs in
the last two games, the Stanford of
fense fell flat against Washington
pitcher Danielle Lawrie. The Card
managed to score just one run over
the entire series, a low point in a con
ference season marred by offensive
struggles.
The first game of the series was
undoubtedly the toughest one for
Stanford. Washington run-ruled the
Card 8-0 in five innings. The game
marks the second time all season
that Stanford has lost in five innings.
On the Washington side, Lawrie
no-hit the Cardinal in five strong in
nings, giving up just one walk and
hitting one batter.

Freshman Jenna Rich and senior
Shannon Koplitz combined to pitch
four innings for Stanford. Rich start
ed the game and pitched 3.1 innings,
giving up seven hits and seven runs
to the Huskies. Rich also had control
problems, walking four batters while
getting just two strikeouts.
Koplitz took over in the fourth

inning and got two outs while giving
up two hits and one run, while issu
ing two walks.
Neither player is a regular pitch
er Rich has started at shortstop
for much of the year, while Koplitz,
an infielder, has seen virtually no ac

tion in the circle all season.
Catcher Shawna Wright was the
offensive star for Washington. She
went 2-3 with five RBIs, including a
two-run home run in the third in
ning.
The second game of the series, on

Saturday, was a much closer contest.
Washington eventually prevailed 2-
1 thanks to another strong perform
ance from Lawrie.

The game was a scoreless pitch
er's duel through the first five in
nings. Junior pitcher Ashley Chinn
held her own against the Huskies,
giving up no runs and two hits in the
first six innings.
Stanford managed to get its first
hits of the series, with five over the
course of the game. It mounted a
short rally in the sixth inning, string
ing together a couple of hits to score
its single run.
Though Chinn had held Wash
ington in the sixth inning, she was
unable to preserve the shutout in the
seventh inning. Wright singled to
right field to open the inning, and
the next batter, Lawrie, hit a two-run
shot to right center that gave Wash
ington the walk-off win.
Sunday's game was another
tough battle between Chinn and
Lawrie. Both pitchers had shutouts
through seven innings, sending the
game into extra innings.

While Stanford's offense was un
able to make any headway in extras,
Washington eked out a run in the
bottom of the eighth to take its sec
ond straight walk-off win, this time
by a 1-0 score.
Chinn pitched 7.1 innings and
gave up five hits and the one eighth
inning run while striking out five.
Her record for the season now
stands at 8-8 after being charged for
losses on both Saturday and Sunday.
Perhaps contrary to expecta
tions, freshman pitcher Teagan Ger
hart did not return to the circle
against the Huskies. Prior to sustain
ing an injury against Arizona, Ger
hart was the ace of the Stanford
staff, and has been sorely missed
over the Card's last three confer
ence series. Gerhart pitched two in
nings last week against Santa Clara
and entered as a pinch runner twice
against Washington, but did not
pitch against the Huskies.
The Cardinal will hope Gerhart
can pitch next weekend at home
against Oregon in its last conference

series of the regular season. Stan
ford will need to play well against
the Ducks to salvage a finish close to
the middle of the conference and its
top-25 ranking.

The No. 1 Huskies shut down the Stanford offense, limiting the Card to just one
run for the three-game series in Seattle over the weekend. With the losses, Stanford remains in seventh place in the Pac- 10 conference, above Oregon State.

With the regular season coming
to a close, the Stanford softball team
headed to Seattle, Wash, this week
end, looking to move up in the con
ference standings. But standing in its
way was No. 1 Washington, the team
that has led both the conference and
