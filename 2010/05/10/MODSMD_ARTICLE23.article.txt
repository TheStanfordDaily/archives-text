# Stanford sports are still dominant
## 
### Mike Lazarus 
So all is right in the Stanford
Athletics universe. The No. 1
seed Stanford men's volley
ball team put on a clinic Sat
urday night over No. 3 seed
Penn State to win the NCAA title, ex
tending the athletic department's
streak to 34 consecutive years with a
championship.
Bob Bowlsby & Co. can sleep easi
ly knowing the streak is intact.
The volleyball team's performance
is astonishing. The Cardinal won its
first Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion title since 1997 to receive an auto
matic bid to the NCAA Champi
onship, which Stanford was serendipi
tously scheduled to host.
With its "Worst to First" mantra
stemming from its 3-25 season in 2007
the Cardinal was simply unstop
pable on its home court. After winning
in straight sets over Ohio State in the
semifinals, Stanford kept its foot on
the pedal in the championship.
The Cardinal's championship run
is a great story, and the players deserve
all the accolades they have and will re
ceive. Yet before the victory, the vol
leyball team was being painted as the
savior of Stanford sports the idea
being that if Stanford didn't win an
NCAA title, it would be a down year
for the Cardinal.
Was that ever true, though? If Stan
ford fell to Penn State on Saturday,
would we really look back on this year
as an athletic failure?
Doubtful.
By nearly every count, Stanford is
having one of its characteristically
dominant years.
The women's soccer team had a
perfect regular season and came with
in one goal of capturing the national
title. The men's team had its best sea
son in recent memory, earning its first
NCAA bid since 2002, advancing to
the round of 16.
Football went bowling for the first
time since 2001. Women's basketball
was one half away from winning the
championship (and a shocking upset
over undefeated UConn). The men's
water polo team was the top-ranked
team in the nation for a good chunk of
the season.
Men's swimming earned fourth
place at NCAAs, while the women
took home second place. Synchro
nized swimming finished second at na
tionals.
Men's gymnastics was the national
runner-up after losing to Michigan by
0.7 points in the final rotation. The
women's team finished the season in
fourth one spot away from the best
finish in team history.
And let's not forget baseball, soft
ball, men's and women's tennis and
rowing all still have a legitimate shot at
a national title this year, too.
Simply put, Stanford is not having a
bad year. Unsatisfying? Maybe. Bad?
Not even by our standards.
It's easy to read the season recaps
and focus on the words "almost" and
"close" and use that as an excuse to say
Stanford came up short. Soccer, bas
ketball and gymnastics all had their
chances these teams just didn't
quite get it done.
That's no way of measuring great
ness, though. Winning a national title
requires a tremendous amount of luck.
The fact that the Cardinal has won a
title 34 consecutive years is odds-defy
ing. Sooner or later, that streak will end,
and it will have nothing to do with the
strength of the athletic program.
So should we look at volleyball's
victory as a salvation of our season?
No. If anything, it should be an excla
mation point.
Really, taking volleyball's champi
onship out of context doesn't do it jus
tice. The title isn't special for what it
means to the Stanford Athletics De
partment, the alumni or the student
body. It's special for what it means to
the players.
Going from laughingstock to the
envy of the nation, from pushover to
bully, from Worst to First that's why
this title is special. What the players
had to endure, especially the seniors
who bore the brunt of the losing, was
painful.
The title is pure joy. Nothing else,
nothing more.
