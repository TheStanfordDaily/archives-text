# Draw-Ma
## 
### BRIANNA PANG STAFF WRITER 
Five freshman and a sophomore sit silently,star
ing wearily at each other in a draw group meet
ing which none of them really have time for.Ten
sion fills the room, and the current dormmates
take a vote. The verdict? An extra pair of friends
isn't allowed to join their draw group. Friendships are
tested as members question their alliances.
These freshmen aren't alone in this housing dilemma.
Despite changes to the housing system to streamline the
process of choosing housing preferences, there's one
thing the new draw system doesn't simplify: draw-ma.
Draw-ma, or the tension that inevitably results from
forming draw groups and ranking living preferences, is a
mainstay of the housing process every year.
The group of freshmen still have decisions ahead of
them where to live? Some want to draw onto the Row,
another wants to draw into GovCo. One freshman wants
to draw into Toyon, causing more debate to arise.
"Every freshman wants to draw into Toyon!" one
freshman interjects.
Everyone has a preference, but no one is willing to
compromise. "But, I want this ..." and "No, that's
dumb" bombard the conversation, and the friends argue
and argue until they finally agree on a list of 43 choices.
By the end of the meeting, the group decides to split in
half, opting to draw to opposite sides of campus.
"What if we get number 1,999?" wails another fresh
man, when the group decides to draw tier two. "That
would suck!"
With the looming deadline of May 9 at 6 p.m. quickly
approaching, the group decides to just submit its prefer
ences. Flopefully.the draw-ma isn't enough to split the co
hesion of the clique.
Every spring, most students are faced with several im
portant decisions that will affect their dorm experience
for an entire year. According to Student Housing, ap
proximately 95 percent of the undergraduate population
decides to live on campus each year. Trying to figure out
whom to draw with, what dorms to draw into and, for the
first time this year, what room type to choose is no easy
feat.
There are 86 possible housing choices and so the vast
array of choices can be overwhelming.
"Our process was pretty tedious," said Jonathan Hsieh
'l3. "We visited all the dorms that we thought about liv
ing in and just compared pros and cons of each to try and
rank them."
However, students reflecting on the application
process often said that figuring out where to live wasn't as
complicated as deciding whom to live with. Compatibili
ty of members within the draw group is key to having a
positive experience.

"You have to be able to live with them in any situa
tion," he said. "I heard that in places like Mirrielees, it's
really isolated, so you need to have a really fun draw
group so that you can still have friends ..."
According to Greg Walton, a social psychologist and
professor of psychology, sometimes the Draw has the un
fortunate result of straining friendships.
"People can sometimes make a single event seem to
be global in its meaning, and they may think that it's sym
bolic of the status of the relationship," he said. "But it's
not. It's important to understand that these things hap
pen, and everyone goes through this."
Walton pointed out that close friends don't always
make the best draw group; sometimes even close friends
think it's best not to live together.
"Sometimes you need space from people," Walton
said. "That's how friendship works. You have to have
valuable time together, but you're not together all the
time."
Students agreed that there is a difference between
friendship compatibility and rooming compatibility, but
said that finding the right roommate, however, can be
tough.
"I really just worry about the most basic things like
sleeping, studying, having friends over occasionally,"
Shah said. "I have a very haphazard sleep cycle, so I sleep
anywhere between 1 to 6 a.m., so my roommate should be
okay with that... If he's a real light sleeper, then it might
cause some issues down the line,"
"And obviously, I don't want to be sexiled either," he
added.
However, sometimes students like Esaite Lakew 'l3
decide to avoid draw-ma altogether by pre-assigning into
certain dorms. Lakew pre-assigned into Ujamaa.
"I just wanted to get a single, even with Tier 3," she
said. "Pre-assignment just seemed to be the best option."
Housing can be complicated for study-abroad stu
dents, but it can reduce pressure for students to form the
perfect draw group.
Theodore Wesley Ford 'l3 decided to study abroad in
Beijing with BOSP in fall quarter of his sophomore year.
He isn't too worried about his housing when he returns in
the winter, but hopes that his room accommodations will
not be "exceptionally bad."
"The fact that my housing options are so limited for
the fall quarter has been somewhat relieving," Ford said.
"I don't have to worry about the drama of forming a draw
group, because all of my close friends are staying for the
fall."
Ford is drawing alone, but he is optimistic about the
advantages of not drawing with a group.
"Not forming a draw group will let me meet new peo
ple and expand my group of close friends," Ford said.
