# CHAMPIONS
## VOLLEYBALL WINS FIRST NATIONAL TITLE SINCE 1997 
### CAROLINE CASELLI DESK EDITOR 
Players and students rushed the court as the
No. 1 seed Stanford men's volleyball team swept
No. 3 seed Penn State in a near-perfect perform
ance to win its first national championship since
1997.

The wooden national championship trophy
sat safely behind the court as the two teams
warmed up, and television cameras panned over
the large and boisterous crowd in Maples Pavil
ion.

"We had 6,635 people there today," said senior
opposite Evan Romero after the match. "That's
6,600 more people than we had our freshman
year. As they've come to our games, it's just re
vived us."

The stands erupted in cheers as Penn State
missed the opening serve of the match. But the
Nittany Lions would fight back to win the next
point, a back-and-forth pattern that recurred for
the majority of the first set.

Every hitting option was delivering. Junior
outside hitter Spencer McLachlin had an early
kill that deflected off Penn State's blockers, while
Romero killed a ball cross-court. Sophomore
outside hitter Brad Lawson came alive at 7-5,
killing a ball straight down the line.

The Stanford team rushes the court after sophomore outside hitter Brad Lawson's game-winning, cross-court kill that secured the match victory.
The No. 1 seed Card took out the No. 3 seed Penn State 30-25,30-20 and 30-18 in front of a packed crowd at Maples on Saturday.
Consecutive missed serves from Stan
ford in addition to Penn State kills kept
the Nittany Lions in the game, with the
set tied as late as 19-19. But four Lawson
kills in the final stretch, combined with
two from Romero and an ace after a time
out, helped the Card pull away. Romero
slammed a ball hard down the line, tip
ping off Penn State libero Dennis Del
Valle's hand, to win the set, 30-25.
The second set opened with a
McLachlin roll shot that landed un
touched at the 10-foot line. But the Nit
tany Lions gained some momentum after
a well-executed dump by setter Edgardo
Goas and multiple Stanford hitting er
rors, taking their biggest lead of the match
at 10-5.

However, despite a slow start, Stan
ford fought back with a run of its own.
Sophomore middle blocker Gus Ellis
used Penn State's block for a kill, while a
Romero hit was sent flying into the stands
by a misplaced Penn State pass. In back
to-back plays, the Nittany Lions over
passed balls, only to have Romero and
McLachlin pound them back for kills.
Sophomore libero Erik Shoji had sev
eral remarkable saves to keep difficult
balls in play. At 13-12, he had a diving dig
from middle back that senior setter
Kawika Shoji perfectly set up for a Law
son kill out of the back row. Later, Kawi
ka Shoji dug a hard-hit ball that ap
peared to be going down, leading to a
McLachlin kill.

While Stanford heated up, Penn State
unraveled. A set by Goas fell untouched
past a hitter, and then outside hitter Will
Price mishit a ball into the net. Goas was
called for a double hit to give the Card set
point, and a Lawson serve flew wildly off
Penn State outside hitter Joe Sunder for
an ace, clinching the second set victory,
30-20.
Stanford led from the first point of the
third set unsurprisingly, off another
Lawson kill and never looked back.
Romero began to take advantage of the
line, while Lawson continued to domi
nate, The crowd began to chant, "You
can't stop him!" in reference to Lawson's
stellar play.
"You talk about being in the zone,"
said head coach John Kosty. "When a
player gets in the zone, you don't talk to
him, you don't slap his hand, you don't do
anything, just let him be. Brad [was in a
zone] tonight."

The end of the set was all Stanford.
Kawika Shoji sneakily set a ball over for

the kill, and McLachlin put a ball down
off a Romero bump set. Price missed a
serve for Penn State, bringing the score to
28-17, and a Lawson-Ellis roof block gave
the Card match point. Finishing off a
heroic evening, Lawson slammed a ball
cross-court to win the set, and national
title, 30-18.
"It's the national championship,
there's nothing really like it," Lawson
said. "It was just great to have a good
night tonight."

Lawson had a phenomenal night, tal
lying 24 kills and only one error an il
legal back row attack that appeared to
have gone down for the kill to hit an
impressive .821. His success extended to
the back row as well, as he had five digs
and a team-leading four aces.
"Early in the first [set], to be honest, I
was nervous," Lawson said. "But as I
started to go through, I settled in. Kawika
[Shoji] was just delivering the ball to the
spot... and it was easy from that point."

McLachlin and Romero were also
powerful offensive forces for the Card,
with 12 and 11 kills, respectively, to aid
Stanford to .495 hitting for the match.
Kawika Shoji had 47 assists, bringing his
season total to 1,455, and both he and his
brother Erik Shoji led the Cardinal de
fense with 10 digs apiece.
For the Nittany Lions, Price tallied 15
kills and two aces. Sunder contributed 12
kills, and middle blocker Max Lipsitz
added another 10. Goas put up 38 assists,
and Del Valle led the match with 12 digs.
Following the match, the Stanford
players received national championship
shirts and hats, and fans swarmed the
court. Individual awards were distributed
to the players and coaches, and the sen
iors stepped forward to accept the cham
pionship trophy. The team posed for pho
tos and took turns cutting pieces of the
net.

The All-Tournament Team was an
nounced after the match, highlighted by
Lawson, Romero, Erik Shoji and Kawika
Shoji for Stanford.To cap off their various
accolades this season, Lawson and Kawi
ka Shoji were named co-Most Outstand
ing Players of the tournament.
Led by a class of seniors Kawika
Shoji, Romero, middle blocker Garrett
Werner, outside hitter Jason Palacios and
outside hitter-turned-team manager Ed
Howell who went 3-25 in their fresh
man season on the Farm, this win, the
grand finale of the "Worst to First" jour
ney, was particularly meaningful.
"It's been a long road for us," Kosty
said. "It's an incredible feeling to watch
this team and how they've grown over the
four years. It really shows what hard work
and dedication can do for you."
"I had hope. I dreamed," Kawika Shoji
added. "I don't know if I would say I ex
pected it, but I knew that a lot of hard
work could get this team far."
