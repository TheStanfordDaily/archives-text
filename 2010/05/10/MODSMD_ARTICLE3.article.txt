## VOLLEYBALL WINS FIRST NATIONAL TITLE SINCE 1997 
### CAROLINE CASELLI DESK EDITOR 
Players and students rushed the court as the
No. 1 seed Stanford men's volleyball team swept
No. 3 seed Penn State in a near-perfect perform
ance to win its first national championship since
1997.

The wooden national championship trophy
sat safely behind the court as the two teams
warmed up, and television cameras panned over
the large and boisterous crowd in Maples Pavil
ion.

"We had 6,635 people there today," said senior
opposite Evan Romero after the match. "That's
6,600 more people than we had our freshman
year. As they've come to our games, it's just re
vived us."

The stands erupted in cheers as Penn State
missed the opening serve of the match. But the
Nittany Lions would fight back to win the next
point, a back-and-forth pattern that recurred for
the majority of the first set.

Every hitting option was delivering. Junior
outside hitter Spencer McLachlin had an early
kill that deflected off Penn State's blockers, while
Romero killed a ball cross-court. Sophomore
outside hitter Brad Lawson came alive at 7-5,
killing a ball straight down the line.
