## HOUSING CHANGES DRAW MIXED REVIEWS 
### E. BLAIR LAING STAFF WRITER 
It's been more than a year since the Uni
versity revamped its housing policy and
the Draw system as part of the Housing
Master Plan, and after submitting their
housing preferences and living with the
implementations, students have said that
they like the simplified Draw system but still
take issue with some of the housing assign
ments.
"Student survey scores are very strong, re
quests for reassignment are down, as are
questions from students requiring assistance
to navigate the Draw system," wrote Rodger
Whitney, executive director of student hous
ing, in an e-mail to The Daily.
One of the largest changes in housing is
the "unstuffing" of dorms, or the return of
certain dorms to their originally intended ca
pacity. Mirrielees, one of the dorms affected
by this change, had in recent years housed
three students in its two-bedroom apart
ments, originally designed for just two stu
dents.
"I think it's a really good idea that they
turned Mirrielees into doubles," said Crystal

Kyaw 'lO, "because it was really cramped
when they had three people in two rooms."
Kyaw currently lives in Mirrieless and
lived there last year, before the rooms were
"unstuffed."

Another major change has been the
switch from the preferred/unpreferred sys
tem in which students only chose from two
levels of Draw numbers, with two preferred
years, to the current three-tier system. This
new system gives students one year at each
level, ensuring that each student will be guar
anteed one year of preferred housing and
one year of less desirable housing.
"The transition from preferred/unpre
ferred years to a three-tiered system has
been very positively received, and has signif
icantly cut down on the confusion about
Draw participation," Whitney said. "With the
three-tiered system, students have a more
evenly spread distribution of Draw numbers
over their career at Stanford."

"I think it's a good idea that they have
three different tiers, as opposed to the unpre
ferred/preferred system, because it gives you
more flexibility," Kyaw said.
Lauren Young Smith 'l3, new to the Draw,
likes the new system. She pre-assigned into

Chi Theta Chi for next year.
"It was really easy I just filled out the
form, and then I ended up getting in," Young-
Smith said. "I guess it worked out really well
this year, because I'm using a tier three to live
in a co-op where I want to live. I guess I'd
have a different opinion if I got screwed over,
but I think it's set up really well."
As a freshman, Young Smith is part of the
first class to arrive at Stanford with the new
all-freshman housing in Wilbur and Stern.
However, Young Smith opted for four-class
housing and currently lives in Gavilan in

Flo Mo.
"I chose four-class because I normally
have a lot of friends who are older, but then I
quickly came to realize that living in a four
class dorm isn't fun because I didn't realize
that the upperclassmen in the dorm are peo
ple that just get dropped there after going
abroad, so they don't really want to talk to us
or hang out with us," Young Smith said.
"There is less of a sense of community. I
wouldn't choose four-class again."
Young Smith's reaction, despite her initial
choice, is part of why Housing opted to offer

more all-freshman dorms, as students tend to
prefer this option.

"The addition of more all-freshman hous
es was undertaken in response to the desire
of incoming students to live in all-frosh hous
es," Whitney said. "In the past, we did not
have enough all-freshman houses to give
most people their first choice of housing
type.Tliis year, our availability was much bet
ter matched to the requests of the incoming
class, so we believe the change has been very
well received."

Some students, however, mourn the loss
of some of the old housing like the classic
freshman dorm, Branner, which is no longer
all-frosh.

"It's kind of sad that they turned it into
upperclass housing, because I had a really
good time there freshman year," Kyaw said.
Housing still does have a slight overflow
winter quarter, due to fewer students going
abroad at that time, and is forced to offer
Oak Creek and Escondido Village housing to
returning students.
"The use of a block of apartments in the
Oak Creek Apartments complex has proved

Branner is one of several undergraduate residences that was formerly all-freshmen. Under the new Housing Master Plan, the residence is
upperclass, much to the chagrin of former Branner freshmen.
a very effective model for housing
undergraduates very near to the
main campus, and is something
which we are intending to do again
this year," Whitney said.
However, this is an unpopular
move with many students, as Escon
dido Village is rather isolated from
other housing, and Oak Creek is ex
tremely isolated off campus.
"One housing change that has
been really horrible for some upper
classmen is putting people coming
back from abroad in Oak Creek and
E.V.," said Julie Smith 'll. "No one
should be forced to live there if they
don't want to. Oak Creek apart

ments are good for the right type of
people, but for me, it was incredibly
isolating, and I got extremely lonely
and depressed."

Smith has since moved back onto
campus, as she was only in Oak
Creek for one quarter, and feels that
the perks of having a real apartment
were not worth the long distance and
lack of student community.
"Basically, my opinion is that
Stanford Housing needs to be more
responsible about 'unstuffing' the
dorms, because I would much rather
have lived in a cramped on-campus
triple than lived off campus winter
quarter," Smith said.
A few of the other changes in re
cent years include the addition of
gender-neutral housing, which is
continuing, and the new require
ment during the Draw that students
apply to specific room types.

"The most significant change of
the Draw this year is allowing stu
dents to apply with building and
room type," Whitney said. "We have
not yet had much feedback on this
change, but believe it will be very
helpful in making the in-house draw
processes run smoothly."
Student Housing is working on
some new projects for the next few
years, including the addition of a
"Green Row House" and another
building in the Manzanita complex.
They are also renovating the Wilbur
bathrooms, Bob, Casa Italiana and
Storey this summer. Stanford Dining
is also building a new dining hall
near Crothers and Toyon, slated to
be finished by fall 2011.

a very effective model for housing
undergraduates very near to the
main campus, and is something
which we are intending to do again
this year," Whitney said.
However, this is an unpopular
move with many students, as Escon
dido Village is rather isolated from
other housing, and Oak Creek is ex
tremely isolated off campus.
"One housing change that has
been really horrible for some upper
classmen is putting people coming
back from abroad in Oak Creek and
E.V.," said Julie Smith 'll. "No one
should be forced to live there if they
don't want to. Oak Creek apart

ments are good for the right type of
people, but for me, it was incredibly
isolating, and I got extremely lonely
and depressed."

Smith has since moved back onto
campus, as she was only in Oak
Creek for one quarter, and feels that
the perks of having a real apartment
were not worth the long distance and
lack of student community.
"Basically, my opinion is that
Stanford Housing needs to be more
responsible about 'unstuffing' the
dorms, because I would much rather
have lived in a cramped on-campus
triple than lived off campus winter
quarter," Smith said.
A few of the other changes in re
cent years include the addition of
gender-neutral housing, which is
continuing, and the new require
ment during the Draw that students
apply to specific room types.

"The most significant change of
the Draw this year is allowing stu
dents to apply with building and
room type," Whitney said. "We have
not yet had much feedback on this
change, but believe it will be very
helpful in making the in-house draw
processes run smoothly."
Student Housing is working on
some new projects for the next few
years, including the addition of a
"Green Row House" and another
building in the Manzanita complex.
They are also renovating the Wilbur
bathrooms, Bob, Casa Italiana and
Storey this summer. Stanford Dining
is also building a new dining hall
near Crothers and Toyon, slated to
be finished by fall 2011.

It's been more than a year since the Uni
versity revamped its housing policy and
the Draw system as part of the Housing
Master Plan, and after submitting their
housing preferences and living with the
implementations, students have said that
they like the simplified Draw system but still
take issue with some of the housing assign
ments.
"Student survey scores are very strong, re
quests for reassignment are down, as are
questions from students requiring assistance
to navigate the Draw system," wrote Rodger
Whitney, executive director of student hous
ing, in an e-mail to The Daily.
One of the largest changes in housing is
the "unstuffing" of dorms, or the return of
certain dorms to their originally intended ca
pacity. Mirrielees, one of the dorms affected
by this change, had in recent years housed
three students in its two-bedroom apart
ments, originally designed for just two stu
dents.
"I think it's a really good idea that they
turned Mirrielees into doubles," said Crystal

Kyaw 'lO, "because it was really cramped
when they had three people in two rooms."
Kyaw currently lives in Mirrieless and
lived there last year, before the rooms were
"unstuffed."

Another major change has been the
switch from the preferred/unpreferred sys
tem in which students only chose from two
levels of Draw numbers, with two preferred
years, to the current three-tier system. This
new system gives students one year at each
level, ensuring that each student will be guar
anteed one year of preferred housing and
one year of less desirable housing.
"The transition from preferred/unpre
ferred years to a three-tiered system has
been very positively received, and has signif
icantly cut down on the confusion about
Draw participation," Whitney said. "With the
three-tiered system, students have a more
evenly spread distribution of Draw numbers
over their career at Stanford."

"I think it's a good idea that they have
three different tiers, as opposed to the unpre
ferred/preferred system, because it gives you
more flexibility," Kyaw said.
Lauren Young Smith 'l3, new to the Draw,
likes the new system. She pre-assigned into

Chi Theta Chi for next year.
"It was really easy I just filled out the
form, and then I ended up getting in," Young-
Smith said. "I guess it worked out really well
this year, because I'm using a tier three to live
in a co-op where I want to live. I guess I'd
have a different opinion if I got screwed over,
but I think it's set up really well."
As a freshman, Young Smith is part of the
first class to arrive at Stanford with the new
all-freshman housing in Wilbur and Stern.
However, Young Smith opted for four-class
housing and currently lives in Gavilan in

Flo Mo.
"I chose four-class because I normally
have a lot of friends who are older, but then I
quickly came to realize that living in a four
class dorm isn't fun because I didn't realize
that the upperclassmen in the dorm are peo
ple that just get dropped there after going
abroad, so they don't really want to talk to us
or hang out with us," Young Smith said.
"There is less of a sense of community. I
wouldn't choose four-class again."
Young Smith's reaction, despite her initial
choice, is part of why Housing opted to offer

more all-freshman dorms, as students tend to
prefer this option.

"The addition of more all-freshman hous
es was undertaken in response to the desire
of incoming students to live in all-frosh hous
es," Whitney said. "In the past, we did not
have enough all-freshman houses to give
most people their first choice of housing
type.Tliis year, our availability was much bet
ter matched to the requests of the incoming
class, so we believe the change has been very
well received."

Some students, however, mourn the loss
of some of the old housing like the classic
freshman dorm, Branner, which is no longer
all-frosh.

"It's kind of sad that they turned it into
upperclass housing, because I had a really
good time there freshman year," Kyaw said.
Housing still does have a slight overflow
winter quarter, due to fewer students going
abroad at that time, and is forced to offer
Oak Creek and Escondido Village housing to
returning students.
