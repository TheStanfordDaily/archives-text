# Becoming Dollie: the Band touts new picks
## 
### STEPHANIE SARA CHONG STAFF WRITER 
Last Friday at noon, the
Band officially introduced
the new Dollies to the
Stanford community
through the annual Band
tradition of Dollie Splash. This
year's Dollie Splash made waves at
the Claw, attracting a sizeable crowd
with energetic band music, clear
spring sunshine and, of course, lots
of Dollie dancing.
Curious spectators began gather
ing just before noon. Some lounged
shirtless on the Bookstore steps,
while others made last-minute ad
justments to their "I Heart Dollies"
posters. As soon as the bell tower
struck 12, all were up on their feet.
"Everyone is standing up like the
Pope is coming," an onlooker said.

The Dollies entered the arena at
the forefront of the Band, proudly
sporting bright red pom-poms,
newly monogrammed dresses and
springy Stanford hair ribbons. Their
Nike sneakers still boasted a clean,
white color but not for long.
The hour-long event passed by
quickly as the new Dollies danced
their way through 10 songs, ending
with the crowd favorite "All Right
Now." Cued by the final drumbeat,
four of the new Dollies set down
their pom-poms and carefully
stepped into the Claw fountain. The
fifth kicked and squirmed as Band
members carried her in. And then,
all five were thoroughly "splashed."
The new Dollies are Alina Pi
mentel 'l3, CC Chiu 'l3, Sarah
Chang 'l3, Melissa Schwarz 'll and
Alex Nana-Sinkam 'l3.
"We call ourselves diversity
Dollies because we're all brunette,"
said Pimentel, who lives in Dallas,
Texas, but is originally from Mexico
City. "None of us are full white. But
we can make a white person be
tween us... "
Despite their self-proclaimed di
versity, the new Dollies have formed

a tight-knit group. They just met
during tryouts earlier this year, but
they have already become accus
tomed to finishing each other's sen
tences and giggling in unison.
"I just feel really, really lucky to
get to be a Dollie with this group of

girls, because we blend really well
together, and we all get along so
well," said Chiu, the only one of the
five who aspires to be a professional
dancer. "It's like it was meant to be."
The new Dollies exude enthusi
asm as they talk about the past few

months of training and bonding.
One of the best parts of becoming a
Dollie, besides getting to know each
other, has been immersing them
selves in the world of Dollies.

"It's so funny ... you don't real
ize the culture behind the scenes

until you're in it," Nana-Sinkam
said.
Schwarz, the only non-freshman,
said that they have been learning
about Dollie tradition ever since the
