# Cups missing from dining halls
## 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€”Kate Abbott Marianne LeVine 
A campus group has allegedly
stolen cups from a campus dining
hall, leading Toyon residents to use
plastic and reusable cups this week.
Cups were also in short supply at
Wilbur and Stern dining halls this
weekend.
In an e-mail to Toyon residents
last week, Linx Dining Ambassador
Jon Helman 'l2 said "most of the
cups in the dining hall have been
stolen by a group on campus."
Helman would not return requests
for an explanation of the allegation.
