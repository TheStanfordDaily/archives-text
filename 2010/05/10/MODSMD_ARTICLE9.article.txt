# Cups missing from dining halls
## 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€”Kate Abbott Marianne LeVine 
A campus group has allegedly
stolen cups from a campus dining
hall, leading Toyon residents to use
plastic and reusable cups this week.
Cups were also in short supply at
Wilbur and Stern dining halls this
weekend.
In an e-mail to Toyon residents
last week, Linx Dining Ambassador
Jon Helman 'l2 said "most of the
cups in the dining hall have been
stolen by a group on campus."
Helman would not return requests
for an explanation of the allegation.
Wilbur general manager Chad
Paeglow and hospitality manager
Carole Miller said they could not dis
cuss the apparent shortage in that
dining hall either.
The subject of perennial nagging
by dorm staff, cup shortages are irk
ing some residents this week.
"I thought it was irritating hav
ing to use the Styrofoam and plas
tic cups," said Charlotte Green
baum 'l3, a Wilbur resident. "It's
also not very good for the environ
ment."
Another student said dorm resi
dents simply do not return cups to
the hall after taking them into the
dorms.
"Right now in West Larkin,
there's a stack of eleven cups sitting
at the lounge table, because people
like to watch television and eat at the
same time," said Stern resident Tere
sa Nguyen 'l3. "They then forget to
put back their cups."
