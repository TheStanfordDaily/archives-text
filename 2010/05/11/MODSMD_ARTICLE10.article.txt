## Putting relationship abuse front and Center 
### ERIKA ALVERO KOSKI CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
We've all seen it. You're at a party, people
are drinking and you see a couple slip off
together, probably about to hook up.
You don't really think anything of it
that's just the hookup culture, right?
What you might not immediately register is that this sit
uation has the potential to turn into a case of sexual vi
olence.

According to Nicole Baran, founder and director
of the Center for Relationship Abuse Awareness i
commonly known as "the Center" approxi- k
mately 28 percent of college students will suffer M
from violence related to dating and relation- m
ships, and Stanford is not immune to such inci
dents. In an effort to increase awareness and get
that number down, Stanford has scheduled nu- wT
merous informational events to get women and
men to join the fight to end violence and
abuse. BjJP
On May 5, the Women's Community
Center (WCC) and the Sigma Psi Zeta
pledge class scheduled a self-defense work-
shop, taught by the Stanford Martial Arts
Program.
Take Back the Night, held on April 29, was
an especially poignant vigil dedicated to raising
awareness about sexual assault. Talisman belted
out melodious streams of hope to victims and Spo
ken Word brought tears of anger to listeners' eyes
with their anecdotes of abused women and men.
The group then walked around the Quad to foster
a sense of camaraderie in the cause, as the glim- ,
mering candles shone as beacons of light to lead
the way and the silence wrapped the marchers in a
comforting and thought-provoking blanket of j
unity. 1
"Events like Take Back the Night are so power- i
ful in bringing us together," said Carole Pertofsky, i
director of Health Promotion Services at Vaden. \
"Seeing men and women walking together under
the night sky, candles lit, in the silence was so power
ful."
Health Promotion Services is one of the many organ
izations on campus that deals with sexual and relation
ship abuse. It coordinates and cooperates with other or
ganizations, including the Sexual Violence Advisory
Board and the Center.
"Our primary goal at Stanford and in the surrounding
communities is to create an effective community re
sponse to relationship abuse and sexual violence by pri
oritizing prevention and awareness," Baran said.
The purpose of the Center, founded in 2007, is to man
age and appropriate funding from a $200,000 Depart
ment of Justice grant that the Stanford Partnership to
End Violence Against Women received the same year. Its
duty on campus is to train staff in how to deal with abuse
cases and appropriately respond to victims who have re
cently suffered abuse.
"We know that the first words out of somebody's
mouth are really important to empowering someone
who's been a victim or a survivor," said Laurette Beeson,
a sexual harassment adviser in the Graduate Life Office
and co-chair of the Sexual Violence Advisory Board. "If
they fear they're going to be blamed, then they tend to
not get help, so we want to make sure that [staff mem
bers] say and do the right thing, so that people know that
it's not their fault and that there are people here on cam
pus who are here to help them."
One of the major challenges that the Center and the
other campus-wide organizations that deal with sexual
violence face is the reporting of abuse cases. According to
the Department of Justice, only 10 to 20 percent of all sex
ual violence incidents are ever reported to the police.
"Sometimes people have the misperception that Stan
ford doesn't want anybody to know that this is happen
ing," Beeson said. "Of course we don't want it happening!
And we want to support the people who are going
through it we are not concerned about the public
image of what the numbers look like."
The taboos associated with openly discussing issues of
relationship abuse are rapidly disintegrating through the
efforts of the Center and other related organizations.
Open discussions and understanding sexual abuse are
the keys to preventing violence against women, and the
organizations that deal with these sensitive issues have
worked to re-socialize the campus and allow these topics
to become acceptable talking points.
"Before the Stanford Community Partnership to End
Violence Against Women came to campus, 'relationship

abuse' was not a phrase, it was not something talked
about," said Ted Westling 'll, an intern at the Center and
president of Men Against Abuse Now (MAAN)."One of
the great aspects of my job at the center is that I get to see
students actually change their perception and under
standing of relationship abuse during panels and to see
'relationship abuse' become a part of their vocabulary."
The activism of men in the fight against sexual vio
lence is crucial to the success of the movement, Pertofsky
said. Because the number of male assailants at Stanford
is miniscule compared to the number who oppose vio
lence against women, the majority opposing the violence
can make a huge impact by speaking out or joining organ
izations like MAAN, according to Pertofsky.
Although less than 5 percent of relationship abuse
cases involve males as victims, Baran said, help is avail
able for them as well.
"All of the resources we offer and the dynamics of
abuse that we discuss are relevant to male and LGBT vic
tims," Baran said.
Bystanders also have a responsibility in these cases
and can play an enormous role in preventing sexual
abuse and violence.
"What do you do when you hear someone make a sex
ist joke?" Beeson asked. "What do you do when you see
someone texting their girlfriend 500 times and asking
where they are? How do you see it and label it?"
Pertofsky also gave students tangible advice for how
to prevent violence.
"When students see a sketchy situation developing
between two students, watch, wait and do not bystand,"
she said. "If we truly understand that each of us plays a
part of the Stanford Partnership to End Violence Against
Women, we can make a powerful difference in ending
sexual violence and relationship abuse."

ships, and Stanford is not immune to such inci
dents. In an effort to increase awareness and get
that number down, Stanford has scheduled nu- wT
merous informational events to get women and
men to join the fight to end violence and
abuse. BjJP
On May 5, the Women's Community
Center (WCC) and the Sigma Psi Zeta
pledge class scheduled a self-defense work-
shop, taught by the Stanford Martial Arts
Program.
Take Back the Night, held on April 29, was
an especially poignant vigil dedicated to raising
awareness about sexual assault. Talisman belted
out melodious streams of hope to victims and Spo
ken Word brought tears of anger to listeners' eyes
with their anecdotes of abused women and men.
The group then walked around the Quad to foster
a sense of camaraderie in the cause, as the glim- ,
mering candles shone as beacons of light to lead
the way and the silence wrapped the marchers in a
comforting and thought-provoking blanket of j
unity. 1
"Events like Take Back the Night are so power- i
ful in bringing us together," said Carole Pertofsky, i
director of Health Promotion Services at Vaden. \
"Seeing men and women walking together under
the night sky, candles lit, in the silence was so power
ful."
Health Promotion Services is one of the many organ
izations on campus that deals with sexual and relation
ship abuse. It coordinates and cooperates with other or
ganizations, including the Sexual Violence Advisory
Board and the Center.
"Our primary goal at Stanford and in the surrounding
communities is to create an effective community re
sponse to relationship abuse and sexual violence by pri
oritizing prevention and awareness," Baran said.
The purpose of the Center, founded in 2007, is to man
age and appropriate funding from a $200,000 Depart
ment of Justice grant that the Stanford Partnership to
End Violence Against Women received the same year. Its
duty on campus is to train staff in how to deal with abuse
cases and appropriately respond to victims who have re
cently suffered abuse.
"We know that the first words out of somebody's
mouth are really important to empowering someone
who's been a victim or a survivor," said Laurette Beeson,
a sexual harassment adviser in the Graduate Life Office
and co-chair of the Sexual Violence Advisory Board. "If
they fear they're going to be blamed, then they tend to
not get help, so we want to make sure that [staff mem
bers] say and do the right thing, so that people know that
it's not their fault and that there are people here on cam
pus who are here to help them."
One of the major challenges that the Center and the
other campus-wide organizations that deal with sexual
violence face is the reporting of abuse cases. According to
the Department of Justice, only 10 to 20 percent of all sex
ual violence incidents are ever reported to the police.
"Sometimes people have the misperception that Stan
ford doesn't want anybody to know that this is happen
ing," Beeson said. "Of course we don't want it happening!
And we want to support the people who are going
through it we are not concerned about the public
image of what the numbers look like."
The taboos associated with openly discussing issues of
relationship abuse are rapidly disintegrating through the
efforts of the Center and other related organizations.
Open discussions and understanding sexual abuse are
the keys to preventing violence against women, and the
organizations that deal with these sensitive issues have
worked to re-socialize the campus and allow these topics
to become acceptable talking points.
"Before the Stanford Community Partnership to End
Violence Against Women came to campus, 'relationship

abuse' was not a phrase, it was not something talked
about," said Ted Westling 'll, an intern at the Center and
president of Men Against Abuse Now (MAAN)."One of
the great aspects of my job at the center is that I get to see
students actually change their perception and under
standing of relationship abuse during panels and to see
'relationship abuse' become a part of their vocabulary."
The activism of men in the fight against sexual vio
lence is crucial to the success of the movement, Pertofsky
said. Because the number of male assailants at Stanford
is miniscule compared to the number who oppose vio
lence against women, the majority opposing the violence
can make a huge impact by speaking out or joining organ
izations like MAAN, according to Pertofsky.
Although less than 5 percent of relationship abuse
cases involve males as victims, Baran said, help is avail
able for them as well.
"All of the resources we offer and the dynamics of
abuse that we discuss are relevant to male and LGBT vic
tims," Baran said.
Bystanders also have a responsibility in these cases
and can play an enormous role in preventing sexual
abuse and violence.
"What do you do when you hear someone make a sex
ist joke?" Beeson asked. "What do you do when you see
someone texting their girlfriend 500 times and asking
where they are? How do you see it and label it?"
Pertofsky also gave students tangible advice for how
to prevent violence.
"When students see a sketchy situation developing
between two students, watch, wait and do not bystand,"
she said. "If we truly understand that each of us plays a
part of the Stanford Partnership to End Violence Against
Women, we can make a powerful difference in ending
sexual violence and relationship abuse."
