## Shining a light on brains – and injury 
### IVY NGUYEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Patients suffering from brain in
jury may have new hope thanks to a
project by Stanford and three other
universities studying how the brain
and its microcircuitry react to sudden
physiological changes. The findings
from a new Stanford-led study
are expected to shed more
light on how to encour
age recovery from in
jury.
The project, >
dubbed REPAIR N
(Reorganization and
Plasticity to Accelerate

Injury Recovery), has re
ceived $14.9 million in
federal funding. Span-

ning fields from
electrical engineer
ing to neuroscience
to machine learning,
REPAIR will be
conducted by Stan
ford researchers
alongside 10 other
researchers and
their teams from
Brown University,
UC-San Francisco
and University Col
lege London.
By genetically
engineering specific
cells in a mouse's
brain to be respon
sive to lights, scien
tists can temporarily
shut off specific
parts of the brains of
research animals

using quick bursts of light. This simu
lates injuries that enable the re
searchers to study how the brain can
work around damaged tissue, Karl
Deisseroth, a REPAIR researcher
and professor of bioengineering, told
the Stanford Report.
Although the technique, called
"optogenetics," is still far from human
applications, it allows researchers to
test brain function and cell behavior
in a living animal.
"There are many advantages to
using optogenetics instead of drugs or
lesions," Deisseroth said. "You are in
no way injuring the animals, because

as soon as you turn the light off they
are back to normal, and it is also a lot
cheaper, easier and more precise to
use."

Traditional treatments for brain
injury are limited to drugs and behav
ioral therapy, approaches that are lim
ited in their effectiveness and speci
ficity. The potential treatments that
can arise from this project, how
ever, are more efficient
because they can target
specific parts of the
brain. REPAIR re
searchers hope to
reroute brain signals
around damaged areas
of the brain, much in the

way heart bypass surgery can
correct damaged blood
vessels.

The work of RE
PAIR requires a
wide breadth of
skills that each of
these researchers
contribute through
their collaboration
—an effort aided
by e-mail commu
nication, confer
ence calls and peri
odic visits, wrote
Maneesh Sahani in
an e-mail to The
Daily. Sahani is a
University College
London reader and
has an ongoing
professorship with
the electrical engi
neering depart
ment at Stanford.
"It would, quite

simply, be impossible for any single
lab to achieve what we have set out
to do collectively," Sahani said. "It's
only by putting together all of these
different fields and talents that we
can hope to make substantial
progress on a project like this."
The federal funding comes from
the Defense Advanced Research Pro
jects Agency (DARPA), run by the
U.S. Department of Defense. Many
American troops have suffered brain
injuries during service overseas.
