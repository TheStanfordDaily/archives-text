## EDITORIAL Don't let suspected terrorists buy guns and explosives 
### 
In a triumph of law enforcement and coun
terterrorism that narrowly prevented dis
aster, the events at Times Square last
week renewed the national focus on the
threat of terrorism. With another danger
averted and nearly a decade without a do
mestic attack, the timing would seem ripe
for proponents of America's forceful an
titerrorism policies to be trumpeting their
successes. But instead, a funny thing hap
pened in Congress last week: Republicans
developed a sudden concern for the rights
of suspected terrorists.
The right in question was that of the sec
ond amendment, the right to bear arms.
When confronted by Senator Frank Lauten
berg's proposed legislation that would pre
vent those on the terrorist watch list from
buying guns and explosives, members of
Congress and advocacy groups jumped to
the defense of due process and individual
freedoms. Our identification of suspected
terrorists is not perfect, they reasoned, so
their rights should not be infringed.
But this line of reasoning flies in the face
of everything these same politicians have
spent the last decade fighting for in the
name of national security. People deemed
"suspected" terrorists have already been
wiretapped without a warrant from a real
judge, detained indefinitely without trial at
Guantanamo Bay, waterboarded and sub
jected to various other harsh torture tech
niques and denied Miranda rights. Their
fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth
amendment rights have been obliterated,
but somehow the second amendment has
remained sacred. Given the unmistakable
danger of legally handing explosives to sus
pected terrorists, we find this glaring
hypocrisy to be unconscionable.
The Editorial Board supports Senator
Lautenberg's measure and hopes that rea
sonable steps are taken to assure that sus
pected terrorists cannot legally purchase

dangerous weaponry. Laws involving con
flict between liberty and safety always in
volve drawbacks and indeed, we would op
pose many measures like the ones listed
above. But with the safety benefits of this
policy so palpable and the infringement on
freedom relatively marginal, this ought to
be an easy call.
The speed with which this change can be
enacted also holds paramount importance.
Already, 1,119 suspected terrorists in
cluding Times Square bomb suspect Faisal
Shahzad have legally purchased guns
and up to 50 pounds of military-grade ex
plosives. Every minute Congress waits on
this piece of legislation increases the possi
bility, raised by Senator Joseph Lieberman,
of heavy casualties that terrorists "with
high-powered automatic weapons could in
flict [...] in seconds."
One legitimate worry about this legisla
tion stems from the erratic accountability of
a terrorist watch list already responsible for
numerous gaffes. But if that were truly the
main concern of critics, the argument
against banning weapons for those on the
much more tightly-controlled "No-Fly List"
becomes a lot more difficult. And yet, two of
the three Republican candidates in Califor
nia's Senate primary argued that even those
on the ClA's exclusive list of about 2,500
people who are literally barred from board
ing an aircraft in the United States should
be given the freedom to buy an AK-47.
Where do these arguments come from?
Once again, the enormous political influence
of the NRA has driven politicians to support
unbridled rather than reasonable ac
cess to guns. Opponents of gun control have
painted themselves into a caricature by de
fending the lack of background checks at gun
shows, the expiration of Bill Clinton's assault
weapons ban in 2004 and now this latest
calamity. Nobody needs an AK-47 to defend
himself especially not a suspected terrorist.
