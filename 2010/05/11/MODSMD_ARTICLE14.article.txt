# OP-ED
## Scholarly analysis of divestment needed 
### Sincerely, DANIEL H JACOBS '82 
As discussion again heats up regarding
potential divestment from companies that do
business in Israel, a number of obvious points
need to be repeated. Proponents of divest
ment are not always fair-minded. For exam
ple, one of the past editions of The Stanford
Daily (2007) explicitly banned pro-Israel
opinion columns for most of the year.
The arguments for divestment from Is
rael conflate unrelated issues. Civil rights,
Gandhi and Martin Luther King are not ger
mane to the Israel-Palestine conflict as sug
gested seriously in a recent opinion piece.
The human rights issue is often misrepre
sented in a one sided fashion, with critiques
of Israel emphasized just as issues such as
lack of press and other freedoms in the
Palestinian territories are not discussed.
Never is heard a word about the enormous
moral issues of the "reverse revenge
Nakba," of the 200,000 Jewish Israelis who
will lose their homes as the Palestinian "Jew
free" West Bank state is established. The
wandering Jew will continue to wander. Nor
are the human rights of the Schalit family
discussed by the divesters. If human rights
are part of the discussion, then discuss ALL
aspects of human rights.
If the point of divestment is to force a po
litical solution, then divesters need to ac
knowledge that Israel made two separate at
tempts in the past ten years to settle the con

flict permanently with far reaching conces
sions; first at the Camp David summit with
Ehud Barak, Yasir Arafat and Bill Clinton
(and the subsequent negotiations at Taba),
and secondly with negotiations between
Ehud Olmert and Abu Abbas. Not only were
both offers rejected, but counter-offers were
not even made. The Palestinian Authority
still does not have Israel on its official maps,
and the Hamas Charter remains overtly anti-
Semitic. The Israeli concessions, then, have
merely pushed peace away onto the horizon.
Divestment would then punish the wrong
side, the one that has attempted to reach a so
lution repeatedly, rather than bring conse
quences to the Palestinian leaders who have
obstructed a settlement.
What is most bothersome about the
analogies to divestment campaigns in the
past is not their lack of a fit historically, but
the sense that those who missed the last car
nival have to attend this one. The Left may
have done well in South Africa, but did worse
in Zimbabwe and Iran. It matters not if the
Stanford community "unites" around a silly
campaign or if one or another of the organiz
ers is a genuine do-gooder. What is important
is that the scholarly analysis of the campaign
is lacking.
