## With regards to brown people killing other brown people

Dear People of Africa (ATTN: Sudan),
Re: Application for United States humani
tarian aid,
Please stop requesting humanitarian inter
vention in your civil wars, armed conflicts
and miscellaneous ethnic skirmishes.
While we empathize with your situation,
we are not currently in a position where we
feel it is appropriate to lend assistance to me
diate your internal armed conflicts. As a re
minder, please note that the United States is
not a global policeman with infinite expend
able resources that can be easily deployed to
any international theater.
The United States recognizes that, for the
most part, it is a grave misfortune to be born
African. Living in a country with scarce and
unequally distributed resources, a corrupt
government with no transparency and a
dearth of opportunities to improve your posi
tion is an admittedly unfortunate position. Re
gardless, the lottery of birth is structured in
such a manner that, given your geographic ori
gin, you do not merit the same protections and
opportunities afforded to Americans. We
hope that you can keep this in mind when de
crying the "unfairness" of an international
structure that permits armed strife to occur in
certain countries or areas.

We would also like to request that you
please refrain from classifying these events as
genocides - it is most likely that you are mis
taken. While we can appreciate that this par
ticular conflict may consist of armed militias
systematically gunning down civilians of a
given tribe or ethnic group, please understand
that it is extremely inconvenient for us when
people insist on categorizing these clashes as
"genocides."

Due to the United States' various contrac
tual obligations, we are compelled to inter
vene with military assistance when any armed
conflict is labeled as genocide. In light of this,

we hope that you can respect how problemat
ic it is for us that you insist on doing so. We'd
like to implore you to remember the moral of
the story of "The Boy Who Cried Wolf."
We would furthermore like to take this op
portunity to remind you of the ratio of Amer
ican to African lives that we traditionally ap
peal to when determining our foreign policy
decisions. Using Rwanda as an appropriate
yardstick, our current measurements indicate
that one American life is worth approximate
ly 850,000 African lives. With regards to this
metric, please refrain from contacting us to re
quest intervention unless your projections
and analysis show conclusive evidence that
over 850,000 lives will be lost. We are mildly ir
ritated at your implications that African lives
are worth as much as the lives of our citizens.
Not only do minimal deaths make it difficult
for us to incentivize Congress to approve in
tervention, you blatantly disregard the fact
that American lives have more strategic value
for us than those of your ethnic minorities.
In the event of a civil war or struggle that is
estimated to result in the deaths of the requi
site minimum 850,000 civilians, you are wel
come to resubmit your application to the
United States government for humanitarian
aid. Please be patient when waiting for a re
sponse, as it may take up to four weeks to
process the situation and weigh the potential
options for intervention. If our analysts deter
mine that it is in United States' interests to as
sist, there will likely be an administrative lag of

three to twelve months for our Congress to
approve action. While we respect that this
time lapse between your request and our re
sponse may be inconvenient while your peo
ple are being slaughtered on a daily basis, it is
a necessary feature of a carefully executed for
eign policy initiative.
In order to more effectively structure your
appeal for directed military intervention,
please include any potential benefits to the
United States of humanitarian assistance. For
instance, if your country is the fortunate pro
prietor of vast oil deposits, if your geographic
location provides a strategic position for
American military outposts or if this conflict
has the potential to spill beyond your borders
in away that may affect our strategic interests,
please be sure to include this information. We
expect that you recognize our need to be com
pensated for lending our services to mediate
your internal disputes. After all, collaboration
on humanitarian crises is a two-way street: if
you expect our attention, we would like to re
mind you that the United States requires a
self-regarding incentive in return.
Thank you again for submitting your appli
cation for humanitarian intervention to the
United States. There were, unfortunately, many
qualified applicants this year and as such it will
not be possible to aid you at the present time.
We appreciate your continued interest in our
services and hope you will keep us in mind for
future collaborations. All the best.
Sincerely,
The United States Government
P.S.: You still owe the IMF like, $3OO million.
When you are done killing each other, please
get on that.

Not even snarky commentary can change minds
or save lives. (East coast/West coast debate post
