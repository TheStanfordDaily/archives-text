# BROADLY SPEAKING
## The 						PinkFuzzyLogic of Heated Floors 
### Molly Spaeth 
The day I realized I was my mother's
daughter was the day I realized I had
voluntarily decided to spend my Satur
day morning vacuuming, disinfecting and lis
tening to Sinatra.
I looked up in the mirror mid dust-buster
sashay and saw my unkempt ponytail bounc
ing along in time to the beat of Tony Bennett
and Frank's version of "New York, New York."
I shrieked, dropped the vacuum and immedi
ately started re-evaluating my priorities.
My mom is the polar opposite of any facet
of the vehemently Type-A half of my person
ality. I once suggested to her that 90 percent
of her waking time was spent daydreaming in
one of the following five categories: kitties,
babies, cupcakes, shiny jewelry and/or any
thing pink. Interestingly enough, she didn't
disagree with me. In fact, that day she
changed her Twitter account (by the way, my
mom was one of the first people I knew who
had a Twitter) to "pinkfuzzylogic".
When I first got my acceptance to Stan
ford, I think my whole family cried (we're
real schmucks like that). But upon receiving
my financial aid letter (or should I say, "lack
of financial aid" letter), I think my whole
family cried again. I'm not going to launch
into a detailed critique of the financial aid
system at Stanford but here's the moral of
the story: my parents are divorced so we had
to report my mom, stepdad's and dad's in
come, but it wound up that my mom (who has
the lowest income of all three) had to pay the
highest percentage of all three. As a result,
the decision to send me to Stanford was a real
sacrifice for her, and she drives two hours a
day through ice-encrusted, sub-zero North
Dakotan blizzards to her job as the director
of marketing at a college in Whapeton, N.D.
(population: 4) so I can lounge about in my

California penthouse and occasionally write
a paper.
But right before my mom made the deci
sion about whether I should take a full ride
somewhere else or if Stanford was worth put
ting a serious dent in her pink, shiny jewelry
purchasing power, she sat me down for a se
rious conversation. "Molly," she said. "I want
you to be able to do this, and I don't see any
way that we can keep it from you. But I have
one request. When you graduate from Stan
ford and make tons of money, I want you to
buy your 80-year-old mother heated floors."
A couple weeks ago I got a package in the
mail from my mom. In it was a brochure for a
heated floor installation service with a big
smiley face scribbled in Sharpie across it. It
seems a strange request, but you never will
understand the true significance of what
heated floors mean to my mom until you've
spent 6 months of every year waking up at
5:00 A.M. to a -30 degree frozen tundra. In
some ways, the request for heated floors has
evolved into a running inside joke between a
mother and her daughter, between friends.
But in many other ways, it signifies some
thing that goes far deeper than underground
wiring. The woman who has given everything
for her daughter was asking her daughter to
make sure her feet are warm when she's old.

I've come a long way since that first Satur
day morning Sinatra realization. As a fresh
man in my first quarter at Stanford, I needed
to see myself and be seen as an ambitious in
tellectual, immune to any of the "pinkfuzzy
logic" my mom may have instilled in me.
Three years later, I'm perhaps only just now
realizing how important that pinkfuzzylogic
is. It may not be tangible, it may not be rigid
ly defined and it may not be subject to a
proof, but that pinkfuzzylogic that drives
every mother to comfort a crying baby, kiss a
boo-boo and to put the interests of those who
need her before her own is one of the most
powerful and fundamentally beautiful forces
of human nature.
Here's to the woman who gave up finish
ing her master's degree so she could stay
home and dress up her new, bald baby girl in
pink dresses and shiny headbands. Here's to
the woman who stayed up until two in the
morning while working a full-time job, play
ing Pretty, Pretty Princess with her sick, snag
gle-toothed seven-year-old and telling her
that she was the prettiest princess in the
whole world. And finally, here's to the
woman who drives two hours everyday
through blizzards and black ice so her 20-
year-old daughter she sees four times a year
can go to Stanford.
I haven't seen her for a few months, but
Mom, I will always be your baby girl in a pink
dress. And as soon as I can afford it (aka as
soon as the Daily starts paying their colum
nists per word) I'm buying you heated floors.

Molly is wishing ALL mothers a Happy Moth
ers Day. If you just realized you forgot that
Mother's Day was this past Sunday, e-mail
