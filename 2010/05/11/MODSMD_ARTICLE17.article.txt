## Thank you Stanford volleyball 
### Jacob Jaffe Fields of Failure 
Just in case you weren't one of the
6,635 people at Maples Pavilion,
and you weren't one of many
more who watched ESPN2, and
you aren't one who follows Stan
ford sports in any form or you were out of
the country and in a coma, the Stanford
men's volleyball team won the national
title on Saturday.
For the approximately zero of you
that fall into the aforementioned catego
ry, this news probably means as much to
you as Stan Van Gundy's opinion on who
should coach the Bulls.
For everyone else, this should be a big
deal, if not a surprise. As Mike Lazarus
wrote yesterday, Stanford did not need
this win to have a successful year. But the
Stanford men's volleyball program need
ed a win.
The "Worst to First" slogan has been
well-documented, but the exposure can
not diminish what a remarkable achieve
ment this turnaround has been. Just three
years ago, Stanford was 3-25 with a 2-18
conference record. Now Stanford is not
only on top of the collegiate volleyball
world, but it cannot even be challenged.
The Cardinal won the MPSF regular sea
son title, MPSF Tournament and NCAA
Tournament. That trio of accomplish
ments had not been done in six years.
This doesn't even scratch the surface
of the team's success, though. In what was
supposed to be its roughest stretch of the
season, the Cardinal swept its final four
opponents. In that four-match period,
which encompassed the semifinals and fi
nals of the MPSF Tournament and
NCAA Tournament, Stanford gave up
fewer than 24 points per set.The Cardinal
actually got better each game, giving up
83 total points to Hawaii, 69 to Cal State
Northridge, 68 to Ohio State and only 63
to Penn State in the title match. This sea
son would be historic even without the
enormous turnaround or the fact that
Stanford hadn't even won a single post
season match in 13 years.
What makes this season and this pro
gram even more remarkable, though, is
that this success came despite or per
haps in response to a terrible tragedy
in the death of longtime assistant coach
A1 Roderigues. Roderigues was one of
the greatest ambassadors for volleyball,
running camps for children and coaching
a number of high school and college
teams. Ffis impact was especially felt at
Stanford, where he started coaching in
1992. It was Roderigues who instilled the
"Worst to First" mentality during the
2007 season, and he was one of the
biggest reasons why the Cardinal pro
gram made this mentality a reality.
Roderigues passed away on March 19
from stomach cancer, but his impact did
not end there by any means.This could be
seen in the "AL" sewn on every player's
uniform, but even more it could be seen
in the way the players and coaches talked
about him. Only minutes after reaching
the peak of NCAA volleyball, players
and coaches were describing how much
the title would mean to Roderigues, and
the sincerity was evident in all of them.
This man did so much for Stanford vol
leyball, and the fact that the team could
achieve so much less than two months
after he died speaks volumes about the
character of this program.
With this history and tragedy against
it, Stanford's success is even more incred
ible, and not nearly enough credit has
been given to head coach John Kosty.
Kosty has been a part of Stanford volley
ball for two decades, and his first year as
head coach was that infamous 2007 sea
son. This kind of turnaround could never
happen without stellar recruiting, which
Stanford has certainly had, but it requires
even more coaching, and the many acco
lades for Stanford are a testament to
Kosty and his whole staff After the cham
pionship match, Kosty was quick to cred
it the entire staff from trainers and volun
teers to assistants, and this speaks to the
unity of the program.

And of course, the Cardinal has some
pretty good players you may have heard
of A team cannot really be in a much bet
ter position when it has the National
Player of the Year and there is some ques
tion if he is the best player on the team.
But that exact scenario happened to
Stanford this year, as sophomore outside
hitter Brad Lawson took home the
MPSF Player of the Year award while
senior setter Kawika Shoji was named
National Player of the Year. Lawson
dominated the championship match with
an absurd .821 hitting average and 24 kills
to only one fluke error. Yet it could be ar
gued that this success only happened be
cause of perfect setting from Shoji.
