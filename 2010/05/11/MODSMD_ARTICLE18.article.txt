On Saturday, the Stanford women's golf
team procured a solid 284 (10-over) at the
NCAA West Regional hosted at the Stanford
Golf Course, finishing sixth out of 24 teams
and clinching a berth to the NCAA Champi
onships in Wilmington, N.C. from May 18-21.
The top eight teams from the tournament ad
vanced, as well as the top eight teams from
the Central Regional and the East Regional.

Arizona won the tournament with a three
round score of 876, followed by UCLA's 885.
Texas and Alabama tied for third at 890, with
Virginia in fifth with an 894. Stanford finished
just one stroke back at 895, with San Jose
State at 900 and Texas A&M at 903 rounding
out the eight advancing teams.
Participants played 54 holes Thursday to
Saturday at a par 71. After shooting a 297 in
the first round on Thursday, Stanford found
itself in ninth place, six shots behind leaders
Virginia and Arizona. On Friday, the Cardinal
maintained its play during the second round
to place in ninth once again with a 304.
Leader Arizona was 16 strokes ahead. The
Cardinal golfers knew they had to step up

their game in order to finish in the top eight.
"After Friday, we decided that what we
needed to do was go out and have fun, keep
our attitudes positive and play solid golf," said
junior Rebecca Durham. "We knew mistakes
were going to happen out there and the teams
that finished well were going to be the ones
that minimized the best. Our game plan on
Saturday was to celebrate the good shots and
play solid golf and we did that."
The girls managed the added pressure well
and finished strong, producing their best
team score on the last crucial day of the tour
nament with a 284. At one point, the team was
in 13th place, and in the span of four holes
moved up to fifth after seven birdies.
On the back nine, there was loud cheering
from the fans as the Cardinal was picking up
strokes while everyone else was dropping
them. Senior Angela King ended her last
Stanford-hosted tournament with three
birdies in a row and a long par putt on the
18th green in front of a large crowd. Sopho
more Sydney Burlison had a highlight as well
when she made a 40-foot putt on the par
three for birdie.

"We laid it all out there," Durham, who
also fared well with two birdies on the last

four holes, said matter-of-factly.
Stanford made its last appearance at the
NCAA Championships in 2007 when the
women finished fifth in the nation at Daytona
Beach, Fla. The Cardinal fell just short of an
NCAA berth in 2008 when it finished tied for
eighth place at the regional and lost in a
three-team playoff with UC-Davis and Ohio
State. The women finished 14th at last year's
regional, making their finish this year even
more impressive.

"I was so proud of the way my teammates
fought," Burlison said. "From day one we
were outside the top eight, but we just kept
trying to claw our way back in. We didn't
panic we just kept moving. We were out
side the top eight, and the final day we just re
sponded. I loved how calm my team was this
entire week. We fed off each other and I think
that made a huge difference."
"The team has worked really hard all
year," Durham said. "We hung in there this
week and reached one of our goals get
ting to nationals. We've got a great group of
girls and the support and encouragement
given by everyone really made a difference
