# Why you should care about the World Cup
## 
### Tom Taylor 
Exactly a month from today the first
game of the 19th Football World Cup
Finals will kick off between Mexico
and hosts South Africa in Johannes
burg.
Even if you are not a big fan of soccer, and I
know this probably includes a lot of the Ameri
can readership of The Daily, there are too many
reasons why you should tune in and watch, why
you should care.
Forget the Olympics this is the greatest in
ternational sporting event on the calendar. Bil
lions will be glued to their TVs across the globe,
patriotism will ride high and heroes and villains
will emerge. Historical rivalries and wars will be
refought right there on the pitches of South
Africa.
But more so, this will be the first ever World
Cup played in Africa. The first time a sporting
tournament of this magnitude has ever been
held in the world's second-largest and second
most populous continent.
It is hard to exaggerate what this means.
Africa was the cradle of humanity, a place to
where we all, whatever color or creed we be
long to, can trace our roots. It is a land of fantas
tic diversity in flora, fauna, geology and culture.
But our birthplace has become a land of strife
and suffering. Nowadays it is better known for
war and famine than the successes of our
species: science, art, industry and democracy.
Just a few short years ago, it would have
been almost unthinkable that any of the conti
nent's myriad of countries could host a tourna
ment on the scale of the World Cup or the

Olympics. South Africa itself was a global pari
ah, its discriminatory system of apartheid an
unpalatable and racist concept out of line with
the world most of us lived in or aspired to live
in.
But when change finally came, the country
refused to go the way of so many failed at
tempts at democracy in Africa. There was no
civil war, and while truth commissions brought
past abuses to light, they offered forgiveness

rather than retribution. F.W. de Klerk and Nel
son Mandela etched their names in the history
books, and both became that most rare of
African political leaders: those who step down
gracefully, leaving their countrymen to decide
their own futures through fair elections.
This is not to say South Africa, or the conti
nent as a whole, is now without its problems.
Diseases such as AIDS are endemic, natural
disasters abound and war, political oppression
and corruption are crippling many of its na
tions.

When neighboring Angola hosted the
Africa Cup of Nations at the beginning of the
year, a horrific attack by gunmen on a bus car
rying Manchester City star Emmanuel Ade
bayor and the rest of the Togolese team left
three dead, bringing the reality and difficulty of
life on the continent to international attention
and raising serious security fears ahead of the
World Cup.

While the West and the East have industrial
ized and modernized, Africa has been left be
hind, and no amount of humanitarian aid can
redress this balance. Colonialism took its toll
historically, but more recently trade restric
tions, protectionism and the unbridled power of
multinationals have served to stymie growth
and exclude Africa from the global economy.
Even as FIFA brings the World Cup to the con
tinent, there are claims that small local busi
nesses are being excluded from sharing in the
potential success from the tournament for the
sake of the large, and foreign, official sponsors.
But through all of this there is hope, and that

is what this World Cup represents.
Looking purely through the eyes of a soccer
fan, the progress over the last few years is obvi
ous. Some of the very best players at the biggest
clubs in the world are now African while yet
more have strong ties to the continent through
parents and family. A total of 45 African players
took part in the English Premiership this sea
son, enough for two full squads.

"But through
all of this there
is hope, and
that is what
this World Cup
represents."

Egypt, Cameroon and Nigeria are
ranked in the top 20 by FIFA, and
Cameroon won the Olympic tourna
ment in 2000. Last year, star
Cameroonian striker Samuel Eto'o
moved to Inter Milan from Barcelona
with a pricetag of 46 million pounds
(59 million dollars), and just last
weekend, Didier Drogba from the
Ivory Coast sealed Chelsea's Premier
League title with a hat trick.
Not only has soccer become away

out of a life of poverty for those tal
ented, and lucky, enough to make the
leap from street to stadium, but these
players are acutely aware of where
they have come from.
Many, including Eto'o and Drog
ba, have set up organizations to pro
vide better healthcare and education
in their homelands. Nigerian
UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador
Nwankwo Kanu set up a foundation
to help African children born with
heart defects, and fellow Goodwill
Ambassador and 1995 FIFA Player
of the Year George Weah has pro
moted soccer as away to help heal his
war-torn home of Liberia, even run
ning for president in 2005.

Sport cannot be the answer to all
of Africa's problems, but it can offer
something elusive that all the money
and aid in the world cannot away
to forget its troubles, at least for a
short time, and celebrate its many
good sides in front of a global audi
ence, and perhaps the dream of a bet
ter future for its children.

And that is why, come June 11,
you should tune in. Not just to watch
the World Cup, but to watch Africa's
World Cup.

clubs in the world are now African while yet
more have strong ties to the continent through
parents and family. A total of 45 African players
took part in the English Premiership this sea
son, enough for two full squads.

"But through
all of this there
is hope, and
that is what
this World Cup
represents."

Egypt, Cameroon and Nigeria are
ranked in the top 20 by FIFA, and
Cameroon won the Olympic tourna
ment in 2000. Last year, star
Cameroonian striker Samuel Eto'o
moved to Inter Milan from Barcelona
with a pricetag of 46 million pounds
(59 million dollars), and just last
weekend, Didier Drogba from the
Ivory Coast sealed Chelsea's Premier
League title with a hat trick.
Not only has soccer become away

out of a life of poverty for those tal
ented, and lucky, enough to make the
leap from street to stadium, but these
players are acutely aware of where
they have come from.
Many, including Eto'o and Drog
ba, have set up organizations to pro
vide better healthcare and education
in their homelands. Nigerian
UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador
Nwankwo Kanu set up a foundation
to help African children born with
heart defects, and fellow Goodwill
Ambassador and 1995 FIFA Player
of the Year George Weah has pro
moted soccer as away to help heal his
war-torn home of Liberia, even run
ning for president in 2005.

Sport cannot be the answer to all
of Africa's problems, but it can offer
something elusive that all the money
and aid in the world cannot away
to forget its troubles, at least for a
short time, and celebrate its many
good sides in front of a global audi
ence, and perhaps the dream of a bet
ter future for its children.

And that is why, come June 11,
you should tune in. Not just to watch
the World Cup, but to watch Africa's
World Cup.

Tom Taylor plans on watching every
game of the World, Cup. Find out what
