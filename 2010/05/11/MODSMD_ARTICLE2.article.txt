## Divestment drops ASSU push CRH says it won't pursue undergraduate bill 
### ELLEN HUET DESK EDITOR 
Leaders of Campaign Restore
Hope (CRH), a campus campaign
to lobby the University to divest
from certain companies in Israel
that they say contribute to human
rights violations, have announced
they will no longer seek to urge di
vestment through an ASSU Under
graduate Senate bill.
"Going through the Senate led
to too much emotional backlash, so
we changed direction," said CRH
organizer Fadi Quran *lO, who
called the backlash the "only real
hindrance" that CRH's efforts
faced.
Senate Chair Varun Sivaram 'll
said the timing of the Senate transi
tion would also have posed an ob
stacle.

"If CRH had wanted to get a bill
introduced, it'd have to have gotten
to me by now, or else it's too late,"
Sivaram said. "Next week is transi
tion week, and I won't introduce a
bill then."

Instead, CRH will redirect some
of its efforts toward collaborative
events with Invest for Peace (IFP),
a student coalition with ties to Stan
ford Israel Alliance (SIA) whose
campaign encourages students to
support on-the-ground relief work
in the region.
"Campaign Restore Hope's
movement is still going forward,"
Quran said. "The only new differ
ence is that we are not going to pur
sue divestment through the Senate."
Quran said the Advisory Panel
on Investment Responsibility & Li
censing (APIR-L) last Thursday
confirmed to CRH that Stanford
was not invested in any of the four
companies that CRH named in a
petition circled around campus
early last week.
The two campaigns say they will
host three joint events in the next
two weeks. According to IFP organ
izer Yishai Kabaker 'lO, Quran will
speak about his perspective as a
Palestinian on May 16; an Israeli
student still to be determined will
speak on May 17. On May 24,
Quran and Kabaker will give a joint
discussion and debate on policy and
advocacy, according to Joe Get
tinger'll.
