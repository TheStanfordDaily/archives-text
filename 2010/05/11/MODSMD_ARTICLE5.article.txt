# Federal act gains steam
## Stanford supports bill for public access to research 
### AN LE NGUYEN DESK EDITOR 
In an ongoing effort to raise support for
the Federal Research Public Access Act
(FRPAA), a number of university provosts
and presidents, including Provost John
Etchemendy, have released an open letter to
higher education institutions.

The letter reads as an official endorsement
of FRPAA, currently under review by the
House of Representatives, and urges "the ac-

ademic community, individually and collec

tively, to voice support for its passage."
If passed, FRPAA would require federal
agencies whose research budgets surpass
$lOO million to provide public access to re
search findings financed by their grants or
pursued by their employees. Researchers re
ceiving this federal funding would be re
quired to submit an electronic copy of schol
arly work that has been accepted by a peer-re
viewed journal. This material would be made
available to the public for free within six
months of publication in the journal.

FRPAA would not apply to classified re

search.
Stanford and UC-Berkeley are among the
27 institutions of higher learning that voiced
support for FRPAA. In an e-mail to The
Daily, Berkeley Provost George Breslauer
wrote that the university "welcomes the in
crease in access to research on a national level
that FRPAA will bring."
KC Huang, professor of bioengineering, is
among the Stanford researchers who believe
FRPAA is a valuable development within
and beyond academia.
"I feel pretty strongly that having
access available to the research that's
done in this country for a wide audi
ence is important for establishing the
credibility of science and also en
couraging science in the U.S. and
abroad," Huang said. "I think this is
the case where we're making a transi
tion toward a new way of presenting
science to the public."
Seconding this opinion, Breslauer
said, "Authors of journal articles typ
ically want their fellow researchers to
know their findings as soon as they
are published."
Bearing this in mind, the six
month deadline for public access
"should be no problem at all in the
academy," Breslauer said.
Indeed, fulfilling the FRPAA
mandate would not seem to be a
major challenge for Stanford and
Berkeley; both institutions already
satisfy the bill's requirements.
"We already comply with that pol
icy, and since the majority of our on
campus sponsored research is funded

by the NIH, the impact won't be
major," Etchemendy wrote in an e
mail to The Daily.
"Complying with FRPAA will not
pose a significant burden on UC-
Berkeley," Breslauer added.
Like Stanford, Berkeley "has al
ready adopted measures necessary to
comply with the similar NIH man
date," Breslauer said. Though no
major modifications are anticipated,
Breslauer expects that "minimal
changes will be necessary to adapt
those measures to the FRPAA
model."

Etchemendy commended
FRPAA for increasing public access
to University research and increas
ing the dissemination of scholarly
work.

"That is a core part of the univer
sity's mission," Etchemendy said.
Breslauer emphasized that "uni
versities and institutions of higher
learning have been moving towards
the provision of online content for
more than a decade."

"FRPAA's mandate is especially
important in these times of fiscal aus
terity, where funding for closed-ac
cess content is declining at a rapid
rate," Breslauer added. "It is only
through efforts supporting broad
public access to the results of federal

ly funded research that we can en
sure that persons of varying econom
ic means have access to significant re
search, paid for by their tax dollars."
But not all parties have expressed
support for FRPAA. Publishers, in
particular, have raised objections to
the bill, claiming that it would weak
en existing copyright laws.
Etchemendy and Breslauer be
lieve such fears are off the mark,
though Etchemendy acknowledged
that FRPAA might impact publish
ers' business models.

"It does not undermine copyright
laws, it simply means that the authors
will retain some rights that currently
get signed over to journal publish
ers," Etchemendy said.

Further worries stem from the
fact that FRPAA would not provide
federal funding to cover the costs of
transitioning to online content.
Huang said the advantages of the act,
however, are "worth the cost."

"From the perspective of a re
searcher like myself, I think we at
Stanford are very lucky to be able to
put our hands on just about any piece
of research that is published in jour
nals these days," Huang said.
