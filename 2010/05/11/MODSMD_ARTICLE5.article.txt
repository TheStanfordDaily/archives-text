# Federal act gains steam
## Stanford supports bill for public access to research 
### AN LE NGUYEN DESK EDITOR 
In an ongoing effort to raise support for
the Federal Research Public Access Act
(FRPAA), a number of university provosts
and presidents, including Provost John
Etchemendy, have released an open letter to
higher education institutions.

The letter reads as an official endorsement
of FRPAA, currently under review by the
House of Representatives, and urges "the ac-

ademic community, individually and collec

tively, to voice support for its passage."
If passed, FRPAA would require federal
agencies whose research budgets surpass
$lOO million to provide public access to re
search findings financed by their grants or
pursued by their employees. Researchers re
ceiving this federal funding would be re
quired to submit an electronic copy of schol
arly work that has been accepted by a peer-re
viewed journal. This material would be made
available to the public for free within six
months of publication in the journal.

FRPAA would not apply to classified re

search.
Stanford and UC-Berkeley are among the
27 institutions of higher learning that voiced
support for FRPAA. In an e-mail to The
Daily, Berkeley Provost George Breslauer
wrote that the university "welcomes the in
crease in access to research on a national level
that FRPAA will bring."
KC Huang, professor of bioengineering, is
among the Stanford researchers who believe
FRPAA is a valuable development within
