## Speakers: Haiti earthquake was not an anomaly 
### MIKE DING SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
A group of experts motivated by the earthquake
that struck Haiti in January, killing more than2oo,ooo
people and rendering an estimated one million
Haitians homeless, gathered here on Monday to dis
cuss methods for communities to recover from and
prepare for earthquakes.

The panel consisted of Reginald Desßoches,
professor of civil and environmental engineering at
the Georgia Institute of Technology; Arrietta
Chakos, director of the Acting in Time Advance
Disaster Recovery project at the Harvard Kennedy
School of Government; and Brian Tucker, founding
president of GeoHazards International.
Desßoches traveled to Haiti nine days after the
earthquake as part of a group charged with perform
ing assessments on the structural integrity of critical
buildings such as hospitals and schools. He last saw
Haiti 25 years ago as a teenager.
"Driving from airport to where were staying, the
extent of damage was completely worse than I'd an
ticipated," Desßoches said. "Pretty much everyone
you talked to had lost a family member, pretty much
everyone in the city of Port-au-Prince. The poverty
clearly contributed to the extent to which the earth
quake impacted the city."
While some people might see Haiti as an anom
aly in terms of the damage that earthquakes cause,
Tucker cautioned that the earthquake in Haiti could
be an example of similar disasters in the future.

"Some people looking at Haiti and contemplat
ing the disaster that it caused in human and fiscal
terms tend to optimistically hope that it was a freak
event, a total outlier," he said. "But everything that
I've seen is saying that Haiti is not an outlier but just
a harbinger of what will come,"

"I think that we have so much to learn from
Haiti," Tucker added. He suggested that one of the
challenges is rapid urbanization in less-developed
countries, where the structural safeguards against
earthquakes simply are not present in the buildings
where people live and work. Tucker also said peo
ple need to become more educated about earth
quakes and their causes.

"One of the biggest surprises that I've found in
my 19 years of working in this field is that so many
people do not understand the science behind earth
quakes," he said. "Earthquakes are not meteorites
coming out of the blue, hitting who knows where,
for which there can be no preparation or expecta
tion. All of us here know, especially any of us in Cal
ifornia, that faults are where earthquakes occur and
they will reoccur."

With respect to introducing earthquake safety
standards to communities, Chakos said one of the
best places to start is with schools.

"We've seen with our work with GeoHazards In
ternational that schools become the gateway drug to
risk mitigation," she said. "After the 1989 earthquake,
people in the Bay Area were sensitized to the issue of
