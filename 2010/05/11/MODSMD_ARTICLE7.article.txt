## Fall in deaths may relate to CPOE system 
### TINA ZHENG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A new study conducted by Lucile Packard
Children's Hospital and the Stanford School of
Medicine has demonstrated that hospital-wide
mortality rates fall substantially with the introduc
tion of a computerized physician order entry sys
tem (CPOE). Published in this month's issue of
"Pediatrics," the study is the first to establish this
correlation.

CPOE allows physicians to order tests and pre
scribe treatments and medications electronically,
making their patients' information readily accessi
ble to authorized hospital staff as part of a broad
er electronic medical records (EMR) system.
CPOE was implemented in 2007 at Lucile
Packard Children's Hospital. Researchers com
pared mortality from 2001 to 2007 and then to
2009 in a perspective control study that analyzed
historical data and isolated variables using an "au
toregressive integrated moving average model,"
said Jin Hahn, the co-author of the study. Hahn, a
professor of pediatric neurology, served as co-di
rector of the LPCH clinical transformation pro
gram from 2004 to 2008, when CPOE implemen
tation took place.
Lead author Christopher Longhurst, an assis
tant clinical professor of pediatrics, and his col
leagues concluded there was a 20-percent reduc
tion in mortality rates, after controlling for the
rapid response team, seasonal variability and
other factors. Data analysis indicated two statical
ly significant decreases in mortality: one decline
after implementation of rapid response teams in
2005 and a second following the introduction of
CPOE in 2007.
Prior to the implementation of CPOE, order
ing medication electronically was somewhat prob
lematic, Now, the CPOE systems integrated at Lu
cile Packard include windows with real-time sug
gestions and notifications of possible calculation
errors on-screen.
"We were able to cut the time between critical
medication order and time of administration
something we speculate was a huge cause in mor
tality," Longhurst said.
Despite the promising results of the study, re
searchers hesitate to define a causal relationship.
"I think it's important to emphasize correla
tion," Longhurst said. "With this sort of data, we
can't guarantee any factor led to the results. On the
other hand, we saw a meaningful decrease even
after controlling for variables."
