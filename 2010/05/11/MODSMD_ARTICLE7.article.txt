## Fall in deaths may relate to CPOE system 
### TINA ZHENG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A new study conducted by Lucile Packard
Children's Hospital and the Stanford School of
Medicine has demonstrated that hospital-wide
mortality rates fall substantially with the introduc
tion of a computerized physician order entry sys
tem (CPOE). Published in this month's issue of
"Pediatrics," the study is the first to establish this
correlation.

CPOE allows physicians to order tests and pre
scribe treatments and medications electronically,
making their patients' information readily accessi
ble to authorized hospital staff as part of a broad
er electronic medical records (EMR) system.
CPOE was implemented in 2007 at Lucile
Packard Children's Hospital. Researchers com
pared mortality from 2001 to 2007 and then to
2009 in a perspective control study that analyzed
historical data and isolated variables using an "au
toregressive integrated moving average model,"
said Jin Hahn, the co-author of the study. Hahn, a
professor of pediatric neurology, served as co-di
rector of the LPCH clinical transformation pro
gram from 2004 to 2008, when CPOE implemen
tation took place.
Lead author Christopher Longhurst, an assis
tant clinical professor of pediatrics, and his col
leagues concluded there was a 20-percent reduc
tion in mortality rates, after controlling for the
rapid response team, seasonal variability and
other factors. Data analysis indicated two statical
ly significant decreases in mortality: one decline
after implementation of rapid response teams in
2005 and a second following the introduction of
CPOE in 2007.
Prior to the implementation of CPOE, order
ing medication electronically was somewhat prob
lematic, Now, the CPOE systems integrated at Lu
cile Packard include windows with real-time sug
gestions and notifications of possible calculation
errors on-screen.
"We were able to cut the time between critical
medication order and time of administration
something we speculate was a huge cause in mor
tality," Longhurst said.
Despite the promising results of the study, re
searchers hesitate to define a causal relationship.
"I think it's important to emphasize correla
tion," Longhurst said. "With this sort of data, we
can't guarantee any factor led to the results. On the
other hand, we saw a meaningful decrease even
after controlling for variables."
Previous studies have shown neu
tral or negative effects in pediatric
hospitals following implementation
of CPOE, Hahn said. Longhurst's
study is the first to show a statistically
significant evidence of a decrease in
mortality.
"A 2005 Pittsburgh study on the
effect [of a CPOE system] at a chil
dren's hospital showed a slight bump
up in mortality," Longhurst said. "This
was obviously very troubling. A fol
low-up study in Seattle showed no
change, showing systems could at
least be put in safely without hurting
children."

Longhurst found the trend toward
more widespread implementation of
CPOE systems, in conjunction with
electronic medical records, to be
promising. He cited the 2009 Health
Information Technology for Eco
nomic and Clinical Health
(HITECH) Act signed into law by
President Obama as a manifestation
of this trend. The HITECH Act allot
ted $19.2 billion to increase the use of
electronic medical records by physi
cians and hospitals.
"Currently, I would estimate only
10 to 15 percent of hospitals are using
computerized physician orders while
50 percent of children's hospitals
are," Longhurst said. "These numbers
will rise."

Still, transitioning to the new com
puterized system may be difficult for
older physicians who are accustomed
to paper environments.

"For most physicians, CPOE has
been the single biggest change,"
Longhurst said. "Good adoption of
the system is very challenging. We
never said it would be easier or faster,
but it would be safer for patients."
Hahn agreed that the steep learn
ing curve may be problematic at first

and believes that the current software
interface has much room for im
provement.

"Many other hospitals are imple
menting CPOE and EMR and it is
only a question of time when these
will be the standards of care in hospi
tals in the U. 5.," Hahn said.
Despite its growing recognition,
the study has not convinced all re
searchers. A three-year study con
ducted at Seattle's Children Hospital
found no significant change in mor
tality after CPOE was implemented

in 2003.
"The study was not a controlled
experiment that you might do in a
lab," wrote Mark Del Beccaro, chief
medical information officer at Seat
tle's Children Hospital, in an e-mail
to The Daily. "In the laboratory set
ting, the investigator sets up the ex
periment and usually manipulates
one variable at a time and measures
the effect. In a complex hospital set
ting this isn't possible with EMRs."
"A group of children's hospitals is
considering looking at pooled data

from those that have and have not im
plemented an EMR with CPOE and
seeing if the Packard data is more
generalizable to other institutions,"
Del Beccaro added.

Looking toward the future,
Longhurst said he plans to carry out a
follow-up study that investigates
which specific aspects of implemen
tation lead to the lower mortality
rates.

A recent study by Lucile Packard Children's Hospital and the Stanford School of Medicine has shown that mortality rates
decline following the implementation of a computerized physician order entry (CPOE) system. The study provides
evidence of a correlation between these two variables, though causation has not been established.
