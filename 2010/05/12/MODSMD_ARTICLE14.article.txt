## EDITORIAL California should switch to open primary elections 
### 
Proposition 14 will appear on the June
2010 ballot and offers California the
chance to adopt an open primary elec
tion system instead of the modified closed pri
mary that currently exists. Under the present
system, voters in California may only select
their own party's candidates and cannot cross
over to other parties' primaries. Unaffiliated
voters are allowed to vote in any of the pri
maries. An open primary would change the
current system in two key ways voters
could cast their ballot for any candidate, re
gardless of party, and the primary's top two
candidates, regardless of party, would advance
to the runoff election in November. This
would only apply to state and congressional
elections. The Editorial Board supports
Proposition 14, and believes that it will help
strengthen the power of the average voter and
foster a more open dialogue between the Re
publican and Democratic parties.
The "opening" of the system by allowing
voters to cast their ballot independent of
party affiliation is a crucial change. In a polit
ical climate that is increasingly polarized by
party, opening up the vote would allow voters
to see the candidates on a spectrum and
break down the "us vs. them" mentality that
pervades the current closed system. Candi
dates must be evaluated on more than just
their party identification in an open system,

promoting greater voter involvement. The
open system also empowers voters to make
more of a choice than simply picking their
party's best candidate, allowing for the voter
to better evaluate the race overall.

The runoff election in November opens
up interesting possibilities, namely having
two candidates of the same party on the same
ticket. While this may lead to accusations of
bias, it would actually strengthen the demo
cratic process by allowing the two most sup
ported candidates to face one another, rather
than just the top candidates from each party.
Once again, the voter is empowered to select
those who will appear on the ballot and the
initiative breaks down party lines in favor of
candidate qualifications.
Many may argue that parties will manipu
late the vote in an open system and it will be
too confusing for voters. While these con
cerns may be valid, the small risk these
changes pose does not outweigh the benefit
of empowering the voters of California. An
open primary system will open dialogue
across party lines and, hopefully, lead to can
didates being elected based on qualifications
rather than just party affiliations. Proposition
14, if passed, would put California alongside
fourteen other states with open primaries,
and perhaps even help reform the election
system in the state.
