# GET IT RIGHT
## If it's "All Greek" right now, it won't be for very much longer 
### Erica Morgan 
On May 5, The Wall Street Journal re
ported, "three people were killed and
four were seriously injured in a fire
bomb attack on a bank in central Athens
Wednesday as a massive protest against
Greek austerity measures turned violent and
angry youths rampaged through the capital
smashing shop windows, torching businesses
and overturning garbage bins." Though we
may be appalled at the crisis Greece faces,
and though we may shake our heads at the vi
olence and the civil unrest, most of us get on
with our lives without lending much thought
to the wider implications of Greece's plight
and its particular relevance to the future of
the United States.

Don't get me wrong: economically con
scious Americans wonder how European in
stability will impact the U.S. markets. Will ex
ports suffer? Is contagion a possibility? Was
the massive intraday market crash last Thurs
day attributable in part to fear of Greek fi
nancial default? These questions, while high
ly salient, distract from a more pressing con
sideration: is American heading in the same
direction as Greece?

The question may seem melodramatic, but
as federal spending continues to rise and the
US government continues to insert itself into
every corner of the private sector, one can't
help but notice the parallels. Former U.S.
Comptroller General David Walker (whose
job it was to ensure the fiscal and managerial
accountability of the federal government) de
clared in a CNBC interview in February,
"We're not Greece, but we could end up with
their same problems down the road if we don't
get spending under control and start dealing
with our structural deficits 500n... I think
we've got a couple of years to demonstrate
that we're going to do something meaningful."
Problem #1: Greece is out of money. "Old
news," you scoff, "Obviously Greek debt is a
huge problem.The pressing issue now is figur
ing out how to fix it/bail it out because it's too
big to fail." But why is Greece out of money?
Here I defer to Margaret Thatcher, former
Prime Minister of the U.K.: "The problem
with Socialism is that eventually you run out
of other people's money." Socialist gover
nance such as that in Greece sure sounds
great in the short run. The State foots the
healthcare bills, employs 14 percent of the
labor force and pays generous benefits to its
public sector employees. In the long run, you
get firebombs.
Problem #2: People like handouts, and be
come quite wroth when there are no more to
be had. The problem with "entitlement pro
grams" is that citizens delude themselves into
thinking that they are actually entitled to
other people's money. Which gets back to the
problem of what to do when the other people
are no longer willing/able to pay up. The
Greeks handed financial responsibility to
their government, and, now that the govern
ment is teetering on edge of bankruptcy,
they're not willing to accept the repercus
sions. As Greek protestors have conniption
fits in the streets, it behooves us to realize that

we are likewise becoming a nation of citizens
dependent on government for our basic
needs. Social Security reform? Of course we
can't reform! That would mean cutting bene
fits! Healthcare? Obviously the government
should provide healthcare! It's a basic right
after all. I wonder though, what will happen
when our own coffers run out and there is
therefore no more money for the government
to dole out?

It is rare that reading the news these days
brings much in the way of entertainment, but
the irony of a particular New York Times arti
cle was too priceless to ignore. The article de
scribes the features of the IMF's efforts to as
sist Greece. These efforts are contingent on
the Greek government's cutting of public sec
tor spending: "Another reform high on the list
is removing the state from the marketplace in
crucial sectors like health care, transportation
and energy and allowing private investment."
Economists indicate that liberalizing the
transportation and health care industries
"would help bring down prices in these
areas." So, as a financially devastated Greece
considers privatizing healthcare to save itself
from ruin, America nationalizes healthcare to
... cut... costs? Wait, what?

Socialism only operates until the govern
ment runs out of money. Income redistribu
tion only works until those being robbed are
no longer willing to create income. And at the
crucial juncture, when the state can no longer
fill the hands reaching for it, the people head
for the capital to demand that which they are
rightfully "owed." And those who dare to sug
gest austerity are condemned for implying
that human beings ought to support them
selves. It's truly terrifying.

Erica is contemplating rioting in White Plaza
for benefits to her GPA. It's only fair. Emor

Socialism only
operates until the
government runs out
of money.
