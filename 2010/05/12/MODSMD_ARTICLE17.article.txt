The title of this column is actually not an
organic compound, but rather the met
rical pattern Homer used to write the
Odyssey. While this column has focused main
ly on modern science, it's important to recog
nize an equally vibrant academic community
at Stanford that studies history, the arts and
other humanities. Stanford often plays up the
"fuzzy'T'techie" divide as one of irreconcil
able differences and cataclysmic proportions,
but the truth is, we're not so different. While
poets may not publish a new metrical foot
every month in Nature, and historians may
not create new historical events (unless your
last name is Hearst) each year, the creative
process of discovery involved in each disci
pline is identical to the curious, industrious
mind required for scientific exploration. With
that in mind, I'd like to explore modern poet

ry as if it were a scientific discipline.
Poetry, as a science, is a fairly fluid disci
pline. When executed well, poetry captures
the soul of a person or a culture as a lyrical
verse. As a result, poetry evolves as constant
ly and as fluidly as people and cultures. Some
would point to the fluidity of the field as an
indication that it requires lesser acumen than

the hard sciences. The sentiment is that there
are no wrong poems, and therefore poetry is
easy. This type of logic forgets that science,
too, is a constantly evolving field, and that
some of the most brilliant scientific discover
ies were made only by bucking convention
and prevailing wisdom. In fact, the develop
ment of modern poetry through the cen
turies has very closely mirrored the develop
ment of modern science.

Petrarch, sometimes called the "Father of
the Renaissance", was a 14th century scholar
who probably did more than any single per
son to bring Europe out of the Dark Ages and
into the modern era. He railed against igno
rance, and strove to bring order to the uni
verse. Perhaps he is best known for his son-
