# STRANGELY CHARMING
## Dactylic Hexameter 
### Jack Cackler 
The title of this column is actually not an
organic compound, but rather the met
rical pattern Homer used to write the
Odyssey. While this column has focused main
ly on modern science, it's important to recog
nize an equally vibrant academic community
at Stanford that studies history, the arts and
other humanities. Stanford often plays up the
"fuzzy'T'techie" divide as one of irreconcil
able differences and cataclysmic proportions,
but the truth is, we're not so different. While
poets may not publish a new metrical foot
every month in Nature, and historians may
not create new historical events (unless your
last name is Hearst) each year, the creative
process of discovery involved in each disci
pline is identical to the curious, industrious
mind required for scientific exploration. With
that in mind, I'd like to explore modern poet

ry as if it were a scientific discipline.
Poetry, as a science, is a fairly fluid disci
pline. When executed well, poetry captures
the soul of a person or a culture as a lyrical
verse. As a result, poetry evolves as constant
ly and as fluidly as people and cultures. Some
would point to the fluidity of the field as an
indication that it requires lesser acumen than

the hard sciences. The sentiment is that there
are no wrong poems, and therefore poetry is
easy. This type of logic forgets that science,
too, is a constantly evolving field, and that
some of the most brilliant scientific discover
ies were made only by bucking convention
and prevailing wisdom. In fact, the develop
ment of modern poetry through the cen
turies has very closely mirrored the develop
ment of modern science.

Petrarch, sometimes called the "Father of
the Renaissance", was a 14th century scholar
who probably did more than any single per
son to bring Europe out of the Dark Ages and
into the modern era. He railed against igno
rance, and strove to bring order to the uni
verse. Perhaps he is best known for his son-

nets, which have perhaps the most
rigorously defined structure of any
poetic form. His rigidly prescribed
poetry reflects his rigidly prescribed
worldview that order and discipline
were essential to warding off igno
rance and expanding human under
standing. Accomplishments of the
scientific community throughout the
Renaissance reflected this senti
ment, and were driven by the idea
that scientific inquiry could bring
order to the universe. And so Coper
nicus reimagined astronomy, Hooke
laid the foundations for biology and
Newton detailed the core of modern
physics, all of which fit in rigorously
defined models that could fit in a Pe
trarchan sonnet.

Curiously, the more scientists ex
plained, the more questions they
found to be unanswered. Poetic stan
dards loosened over the centuries.
Spenserian and Shakespearean son
nets still have a definite structure,
but are notably less rigorous then
Petrarchan sonnets. The discovery
that rigorous scientific inquiry did
not necessarily bring more order to
the universe was powerful, and
made people reexamine cultural val
ues. Skipping ahead several genera
tions, two major ideas near the end
of the nineteenth century shook sci
ence at its core: Darwinian evolution
and Planck's quantum hypothesis.
Evolution was game changing be
cause, as Copernicus had done 300
years earlier, it removed humans
from the center of the biological uni
verse, and placed them as merely an
other player in the game of life.
Quantum physics was even more
baffling in that it envisioned a uni
verse in which, to some degree, noth
ing was certain. No amount of rigid,
Petrarchan investigation could alter
this fact, and art was changed forev
er. The defined realism of Bach,
Raphael and Shakespeare morphed
into the meandering and even ab
surd fascination of Beethoven, Pi
casso and e.e. cummings. Dadaism is
probably the zenith of lawless poet
ry, a World War I era artistic move
ment that held free expression of all
kinds in the highest esteem. The
movement's epicenter was in
Zurich, the same city in which Ein
stein spent much of the early twenti
eth century becoming more and

more puzzled by the mysteries of
quantum physics. As an academic,
it's only right to point out that this
has been a cursory overview of the
last millennium of poetry and sci
ence and has only demonstrated a
strong correlation between the two.
Still, the story is telling, and it's im
possible to conclude that science and
art are unrelated.

Both modern poetry and modern
science lie somewhere between the
two extremes. Science has reached a
comfortable equilibrium where we
are well aware that there are many
things that we don't know, but we ac
tively try to achieve greater under
standing through the scientific
method. Modern poetry, too, gener
ally falls within some general struc
ture, though not nearly as stringent
as Petrarchan standards. A healthy
balance between order and adven
turous rebellion is a key component
to advancing any discipline, be it sci
entific or artistic.

The larger point is that intellectu
al investigation into "fuzzy" subjects
can be every bit as valuable and in
sightful as investigation into
"techie" subjects. And while devel
opments in modern poetry may not
come as frequently as those in com
putational biology, they can be ana
lyzed under the same lens of the cu
rious learner. Truly intellectually cu
rious individuals would be wise to
explore all disciplines with fervor
and expediency, and there is no bet
ter atmosphere than Stanford to cul
tivate the curious mind.

verse in which, to some degree, noth
ing was certain. No amount of rigid,
Petrarchan investigation could alter
this fact, and art was changed forev
er. The defined realism of Bach,
Raphael and Shakespeare morphed
into the meandering and even ab
surd fascination of Beethoven, Pi
casso and e.e. cummings. Dadaism is
probably the zenith of lawless poet
ry, a World War I era artistic move
ment that held free expression of all
kinds in the highest esteem. The
movement's epicenter was in
Zurich, the same city in which Ein
stein spent much of the early twenti
eth century becoming more and

more puzzled by the mysteries of
quantum physics. As an academic,
it's only right to point out that this
has been a cursory overview of the
last millennium of poetry and sci
ence and has only demonstrated a
strong correlation between the two.
Still, the story is telling, and it's im
possible to conclude that science and
art are unrelated.

Both modern poetry and modern
science lie somewhere between the
two extremes. Science has reached a
comfortable equilibrium where we
are well aware that there are many
things that we don't know, but we ac
tively try to achieve greater under
standing through the scientific
method. Modern poetry, too, gener
ally falls within some general struc
ture, though not nearly as stringent
as Petrarchan standards. A healthy
balance between order and adven
turous rebellion is a key component
to advancing any discipline, be it sci
entific or artistic.

The larger point is that intellectu
al investigation into "fuzzy" subjects
can be every bit as valuable and in
sightful as investigation into
"techie" subjects. And while devel
opments in modern poetry may not
come as frequently as those in com
putational biology, they can be ana
lyzed under the same lens of the cu
rious learner. Truly intellectually cu
rious individuals would be wise to
explore all disciplines with fervor
and expediency, and there is no bet
ter atmosphere than Stanford to cul
tivate the curious mind.
