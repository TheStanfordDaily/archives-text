California campuses have again become
battlefields in efforts to delegitimize Israel
under the guise of human rights. Divestment,
which has nothing to do with student govern
ment, is simply a wedge to force this agenda
into the campus dialog. Its proponents foist
all blame for the conflict on one side, using
accusations spiced by distortions and histori
cal lapses.
In particular, by lumping Israel together
with South Africa and Darfur, the May 7 op
ed by Linda Hess stepped way over the
rhetorical line. She wrote about teaching

Gandhi's legacy at a Stanford overseas pro
gram in India. But the Palestinian movement
she supports seems far Gandhian.
Palestinian mujahedin murdered Israeli
Olympic athletes. They have hijacked air
planes, an Israeli school bus, and a cruise ship
(throwing wheelchair-bound American, Leon
Klinghoffer, overboard). Suicide bombers
have blown up an Israeli pizzeria, a disco, a
university cafeteria, and a hotel dining room
during a Passover dinner. Then the perpetra
tors are called shahids (martyrs), and have
soccer tournaments, schools and squares

named in their honor. Students at the West
Bank's An-Najah University even recreated
the destroyed pizzeria, complete with fake
blood and bodies, as an "art project."
Fatah, the "moderate" party ruling the
West Bank, says in English that it wants
peace between two states. But in Arabic its
charter still states: "Armed struggle is a strat
egy and not a tactic, and the Palestinian Arab
People's armed revolution is a decisive factor
in the liberation fight and in uprooting the
Zionist existence, and this struggle
will not cease unless the Zionist
state is demolished and Palestine is
completely liberated." This is not
what Gandhi would have said.

Hamas, ruling Gaza since a coup
in which Fatah fighters were thrown
from rooftops, has a charter blaming
Jews for starting both World Wars.
Moreover, "renouncing any part of
Palestine means renouncing part of
the religion." No two-state solution
here. "Peaceful solutions and inter
national conferences, are in contra
diction to the principles of the Is
lamic Resistance Movement...There
is no solution for the Palestinian
question except through Jihad."
Their long-term plan cites a Hadith
(a saying of Muhammad): "The time
[of Resurrection] will not come until
Muslims will fight the Jews; until the
Jews hide behind rocks and trees,
which will cry: O Muslim! There is a
Jew hiding behind me, come and kill
him!" This is not "I have a dream."

Compare either charter with Is
rael's Declaration of Independence,
on May 14,1948. Israel promised to
"ensure complete equality of social
and political rights to all its inhabi
tants irrespective of religion, race or
sex; it will guarantee freedom of re
ligion, conscience, language, educa
tion and culture; it will safeguard the
Holy Places of all religions...We ex
tend our hand to all neighboring
states and their peoples in an offer
of peace and good neighborliness."
Five Arab armies invaded the next
day.
No country fully lives up to its
ideals; Israel, like America, is a work
in progress. As a small democracy
beset from day one by neighbors call
ing for its destruction, Israel has al
ways had to put an emphasis on secu
rity. But as soon as the leader of one
of those neighbors, Egypt's Anwar
Sadat, offered peace in 1977, he got
the Sinai, something he failed to
achieve with his war in 1973. If the
Palestinians had a Gandhi instead of
an Arafat, they would have had their
state years ago.
