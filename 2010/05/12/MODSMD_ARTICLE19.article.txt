## Hones loss leads to uncertainty 
### Wyndam Makowsky Between the lines 
After a weekend of
Cardinal jubilation,
Monday brought
stunning news. JJ
Hones, a women's
basketball fixture and a rising red
shirt senior, had been dismissed
from the team for a violation of its
rules; the Athletic Department of
fered no further explanation. On
Tuesday, Fanhouse reported that
Hones was arrested for a DUI on
May 2, although a direct correlation
between the incident and her dis
missal has not been fully confirmed.
On the surface, before the drunk
driving episode came to light, it was
puzzling that there was the need for
an announcement at all. Hones had a
year of eligibility left, but is an aca
demic senior and could have gradu
ated without playing her final sea
son. Plenty of players in a variety of
sports do this, including Hones's
team and classmate Michelle Harri
son, who will not exercise her fifth
year option. Given the Athletic De
partment's generally demure ap
proach to punishment, it would not
have been out of the question for
Hones to exit quietly.
That is in theory, of course, but
not in practice, because eventually,
questions would have been asked, as
Hones was expected back for anoth
er season and was seen as widely im
portant to Stanford's 2010-11 plans.
This point remains salient: Hones
was not simply a rotational player
but rather, a veteran with a serious
role to play next season.
With the graduation of Ros Gold-
Onwude, Stanford was left with a
hole in its starting lineup at the
guard position. Enter Hones, who
started 43 games in her Stanford ca
reer despite tearing her left ACL
twice. Indeed, Hones was limited
often by her injuries, but when she
played, she was frequently a force.
For example, she was seen as one of
the "x factors" of the 2008 NCAA
Tournament, as her play as the start
ing point guard helped power the
Cardinal to an Elite Eight win over
Maryland (in which she scored a ca
reer-high 23 points) and a Final Four
victory over Connecticut.
After sustaining a season-ending
injury in early 2008-09, she returned
this year as the sixth man, a three
point threat and a spot starter. Even
then, she existed as the lone true
point guard on the Cardinal's roster
Jeanette Pohlen has held down
the position since Hones's injury in
the fall of 2008, and has done an ad
mirable job of acclimating herself to
the role, but the "one" is not her nat
ural position.

This in turn meant that in 2010-
11, with Hones having a chance to
get into the lineup next to Pohlen, it
was entirely conceivable that the
Cardinal could have eased both into
more comfortable and fitting jobs. It
is worth noting that Hones would
likely not have made it back before
December, but regardless of her re
turn, the eventual option, now, is out
the window. The question becomes:
who replaces Hones?
The question is two-fold. Not
only must her play be accounted for,
but so too must her leadership. Both
Gold-Onwude and Jayne Appel
were enthusiastic, charismatic lead
ers; Hones, too, fell into this catego
ry. Suddenly, there is a void. Who will
lead the pre-game huddles and rally
the team in the midst of competi
tion? Pohlen and Kayla Pedersen
are both seniors, and Melanie Mur
phy returns for a fifth year cer
tainly, the onus will be on them to fill
that now-empty space.

The on-court issue is even more
interesting. Murphy has a knack for
big shots in big spots, but has had her
own battles with injuries throughout
her career and recently underwent
knee surgery of her own. Her quick
first step would add a nice element
to the Cardinal offense, but with an
extensive rehabilitation looming,
she likely would not be able to con
tribute immediately.
Beyond Murphy is Lindy La
Rocque, who, through her first two
seasons, has been almost exclusively
a three-point specialist and little
more, but has demonstrated some
nice passing ability when called
upon. Other than La Rocque, the

only other guards on the roster are
the little-used Hannah Donaghe
and Grace Mashore.

That means that incoming fresh
men Sara James (ESPN's No. 18 re
cruit overall and No. 3 shooting

guard) and Toni Kokenis (No. 60
overall, No. 18 point guard) may
have a large role to play early in
their careers. James in particular is
deft at both the point and shooting
guard positions, which may fit in
well with the versatile Pohlen. But
that being said, it is almost always
difficult to calibrate just how well a
high schooler's game translates to
the collegiate level it is thus hard
to set in stone any predicted contri

butions.
Stanford does have some op
tions, but each comes with questions,
and the depth is limited. TTie guard
position is now in a precarious spot.
Make no mistake: losing Hones is no
small matter.
