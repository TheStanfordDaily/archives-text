Stanford Taiko performed Tuesday at the groundbreaking for the Bing Concert Hall, set to be built on Museum Way and completed in
the summer of 2012. The 112,000-square-foot design will hold 844 seats and be located along the same axis as the Cantor Arts
Center. The first performances in the hall are expected in early 2013. "Our concert hall is really meant to be a beacon," said University
architect David Lenox during a tour of the site earlier this week. "We want everyone to be welcome." Please see page 2 for more.
