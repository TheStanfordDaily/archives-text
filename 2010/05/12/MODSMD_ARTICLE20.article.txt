						STARTING POINT
## Dunn picks up Pac- 10 point for Stanford in heptathlon 
### ANARGHYA VARDHANA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
This weekend, the Pac-10 Championships
started out with the multi-events competition
at Berkeley. Representing the Cardinal were
freshman Karynn Dunn and junior Whitney
Liehr, while the men's side did not have any
athletes participating. In her debut in the multi
events arena, Dunn had an excellent perform
ance that shows great promise for her future as
a multi-events athlete.

The women's outdoor heptathlon consists
of seven events: 100-meter hurdles, high jump,
shot put, 200-meter dash, long jump, javelin and
800-meter run. The heptathlon tests the ath
lete's versatility and ability to perform well in
various physical demands. She must be able to
sprint, throw, jump and run a slightly longer dis
tance. Typically multi-event athletes will have
one or two strengths, as each event is assigned a
certain number of points. Dunn's strengths are
the hurdles and the long jump. In addition to
strengths, each athlete will have certain weak

nesses at varying degrees. While the 800 is a
tough run, Dunn's main weakness is the javelin,
which was a problem this weekend as well.
Dunn started the competition strong, sitting
in fifth place after the first day of competition,
with four of the seven events completed. Com
peting in her first-ever collegiate heptathlon,
this was an impressive position for Dunn. In day
one, she competed in the 200 meters, the 100-
meter hurdles, shot put and high jump.
Dunn placed third overall in the 200 meters
with a time of 25.01 seconds, her top finish for
the day. Dunn scored 886 points in this event.
Although usually a strong event for a hurdler
and jumper, Dunn did not have a strong finish
in the hurdles, finishing seventh with a time of
14.52 seconds.

In the high jump, Dunn had a personal best,
leaping a height of 5-2.25, which was enough for
sixth place. In the shot put, she finished fifth
with a toss of 34-0.

In day two of the competition, Dunn had an
incredible performance in the long jump with a
leap of 18-9. Although this was not a career best
for the talented long jumper, it was enough to
be the best mark in that particular event. In the
800 meters, Dunn finished in ninth with a time
of 2:35.01. Her weakest event was the javelin, in
which she had a mark of 78-3.

"Going into the heptathlon, I was pretty
nervous because it was my first time doing it, and

I was going up against some great competitors,"
Dunn said. "However, being there with my
teammate Whitney Liehr helped to calm me
down because she just told me to have fun with
it."

This weekend gave Dunn the experience
she needed, allowing her to recognize exactly
what she needs to focus on. Many heptathletes

are simply average in all seven events. Being an
exceptional long jumper will definitely assist

Dunn in scoring big points and having a buffer
for some of her tougher events, such as the 800
and the javelin.
"In the end it was all about helping my team
get points and I'm glad that I could do that,"
Dunn added.
The other Stanford athlete who competed
this weekend was Liehr. Liehr had several no
table performances in the individual sections of
the heptathlon. For example, she ran a season
best time in the 100-meter hurdles with a time
of 13.99 seconds. What really hurt the All-
American was the fact that she had a no-height
in the high jump. Not gaining any points from
an event is very detrimental in the heptathlon,
and she wasn't able to move up because of the
lack of points. Liehr dropped out of the compe
tition after placing last in the long jump.
Overall, Dunn finished in eighth place and
was able to score a point for the Cardinal. This
point will assist the team as it competes in the
rest of the Pac-10 Championships next week
end. Dunn will compete once more in her spe
cialty events, as well as the 4x400-meter relay.
Liehr will also compete next weekend in her
best event, the triple jump. The Cardinal will
face the other Pac-10 schools at Cal on Satur
day and Sunday.
