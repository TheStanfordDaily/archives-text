# The 						ups and downs of baseball and softball
## 
### Daniel Bohm 
Baseball has always been a
maddening sport. No mat
ter how much talent a
team has, it can be beaten
on any given day.
I say it is maddening from the
perspective of a player —no one
likes to lose when they expect to win
but as a fan and a writer, the un
predictability of the game is what
makes it so exciting. Every time you
go to the ballpark, you'll probably
walk away having seen something
you had never seen before. The same
goes for Softball.
This irregularity that we fans
enjoy is also probably driving Stan
ford baseball head coach Mark Mar
quess and Stanford softball head
coach John Rittman crazy this sea
son.
As a beat writer for both teams, I
have watched them both peak and
valley this season in ways that make
even a casual observer want to tear
his hair out.
Both teams have had moments
that made them appear to be among
the best teams in the nation, and they
have also had moments that make
them look as if they don't belong
anywhere near the postseason.

The baseball team's rollercoaster
ride has been exceptionally unpre
dictable.
Beginning the season, the un
ranked Cardinal used an offensive
onslaught to sweep No. 5 Rice, only
to be swept a week later at No. 3
Texas with the offense unable to put
up a fight against the Longhorn
pitchers.
Over the course of the year, Stan
ford has gone a very impressive 10-5
against ranked opponents, but has
also gone 0-3 against the University
of the Pacific, the University of San
Francisco and Saint Mary's, three of
the weakest teams on the Stanford
schedule. Granted, those losses all
came in midweek games without
Stanford's top pitchers on the
mound, but nonetheless the Cardi
nal offense was unable to overcome
mediocre pitching to get wins. In the
loss to USF, Stanford managed just

four hits against five different Don
pitchers.

The Pac-10 Conference season
has been no different. Just when the
Cardinal looked like it was on a roll,
having won seven consecutive con
ference games including sweeps at
Oregon State and versus California,
Stanford traveled to Washington
only to be swept by one of the weak
est teams in the conference.

Over a 21-game stretch begin
ning with a loss at UCLA on April 3,
Stanford went on a five-game losing
streak, followed by an eight-game
winning streak, followed by a four
game losing streak, followed by a
four-game winning streak. If that

isn't inconsistency, I don't know
what is.

At times, Stanford has been a hit
first team, and at other times it has
been a pitch-first one. Early in the
season, sophomore lefty Brett
Mooneyham couldn't find the strike
zone with two hands and a flashlight,
and recently he has looked unhit
table. Meanwhile, sophomores Jor
dan Pries and Brian Busick were
brilliant early but have since come
back to earth.
For a while, junior shortstop Jake
Schlander was one of the team's best
hitters, then it was junior first base-

driving [the Stanford
coaches] crazy this season.

man Jonathan Kaskow and now it is
freshman infielder Kenny
Diekroeger. If only they could all hit
at once.

The softball team has been equally
inconsistent, though its failings have
been for different reasons. The young
team began surprisingly well consid
ering its reliance on freshmen, starting
30-5 before free-falling to the tune of
a seven-game losing streak. Since that
30-5 beginning, the Cardinal has gone
a ghastly 3-12.
So why has the Cardinal strug
gled? The loss of freshman pitcher
Teagan Gerhart to an arm injury. Ger
hart's injury reveals the nature of soft
ball: without one dominant pitcher,
which Gerhart had proved to be, your
team is doomed.

Stanford hasn't been losing games
1-0 since Gerhart's injury (except its
most recent loss), it has been losing
games in which both teams score a lot
of runs. Unfortunately for Stanford,
outside of Gerhart, it lacks a pitcher
that can keep most Pac-10 offenses at
bay, and has paid dearly for that.
As their regular seasons wind
down, Stanford baseball and Stanford
softball must find away to be consis
tent if they expect to win in the post
season.

For the softball team, if Gerhart
gets back, Stanford would be an aw
fully brutal draw for a team in any re
gional. Concurrently, no team would
want Stanford baseball in its regional
seeing as the Cardinal has shown that
it has the potential to beat just about
anyone.
