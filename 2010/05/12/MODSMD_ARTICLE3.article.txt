# STUDENT LIFE
## In personal branding, a search for balance 
### STEPHANIE WEBER 
Online social networks have more to offer
than access to pictures of last weekend's party
or 140 characters about what a friend ate for
breakfast; a person can also use the Internet
to create a "personal brand," a picture of their
identity that can be gleaned from their online
activity.
But as the popularity of personal branding
spreads in the workforce, the question is: how
are students using it and how should they?
According to Lance Choy, director of the
Career Development Center, "any informa
tion you have on the Internet shapes your
personal brand, whether it's on a blog, Face
book, MySpace, articles about you. It's so

easy for people to gather that information
about you by doing a search."
While the concept of personal branding
has been around at least since Tom Peters'
1997 essay "The Brand Called You," the ex
ponential growth of online social media with
in the last decade has dramatically increased
the feasibility of managing one's own brand.
The change stems from the fact that now,
"communication is cheap," said Andreas
Weigend, a professor of management science
and engineering.
Weigend teaches a spring quarter class at
Stanford called "The Social Data Revolution:
Data Mining and Electronic Business," which
carries prerequisites including "intellectual
curiosity" and a "willingness to implement in

the real world."
Whereas in the past, employers had a very
limited ability to communicate with their po
tential employees, "the great thing about the
Web is ... we have more information about
that other person," Weigend said.
"That thing in the past that you put your
resume somewhere, then some recruiters
might come by, and based on that one page of
black dots on paper, they decide to invite you
in, and then based on one other day ... they
make you a job offer what an absurd thing
of the past! The game now is interactivity," he
added.
Weigend believes more online
sharing is almost always a good thing.
Even pictures of people at parties
can make a favorable impression on
employers, assuming the activity isn't
outright illegal, because the pictures
reveal that their subjects "have a
good life-work balance," he said.
Choy was more wary about the
negative impact that Facebook pho
tos can have on students' personal
brands. He said he tells students to be
very careful about their privacy set
tings.
"If their Facebook site is open ...
they really need to be careful about
the image they are projecting there,
so wild party shots, or sometimes the
comments we make on our personal
sites, are a little wilder than an em
ployer would like to see in a potential
employee."
On the other hand, Choy ac
knowledged, there are distinct bene
fits for those students who under
stand how to create a personal brand.
One such student is David Brody
'll, a computer science major who
has a personal website and a resume
posted on Monster.com. He said his
website "has changed over time be
cause I want to make sure it shows
my skill level and what I want to
show. But it shows everything from
the work that I've done before to my
resume and stuff about me."
Not all students are as tech-savvy.
"I don't think there are a lot of
students out there creating websites
about who they are and shaping their

personal brand. This is a fairly new
concept, and not many people are
doing things like that," Choy said.
Brody said after he posted his re
sume online in high school, he would
get "maybe two, three, four phone
calls every few weeks with job of
fers." But, he feels, putting a resume
online might not make sense for
everyone.
"It's better to spend the 10 min
utes sending an e-mail to a professor
saying 'l'm interested in this, I want
to try this,' than spending the 10 min
utes posting your resume online be
cause having that connection with
that professor here is something that
most people around the world would
die to have," he said.
Natalie Sudikoff 'l2, by contrast,
is one of the few Stanford students
who does not have a Facebook pro
file.
"I prefer to interact with people
not in cyberspace," Sudikoff said.
"Going to an interview and actually
talking to somebody, I think that's so
much more telling than what kind of
pictures and what kind of interests
you can see on Facebook."
Weigend, however, argues that
online personal brands provide em
ployers with access to potential em
ployees' reputations, what he calls "a
shortcut for human decision mak
ing."

"If you want to get a job in the
Western world, I hear that you are
well advised to wear some clothes
when you show up at the interview,"
he said. "And I think if you don't,
then it's just the same thing as if you
don't have a Facebook profile."
