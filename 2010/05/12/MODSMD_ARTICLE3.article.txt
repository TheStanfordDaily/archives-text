## In personal branding, a search for balance 
### STEPHANIE WEBER 
Online social networks have more to offer
than access to pictures of last weekend's party
or 140 characters about what a friend ate for
breakfast; a person can also use the Internet
to create a "personal brand," a picture of their
identity that can be gleaned from their online
activity.
But as the popularity of personal branding
spreads in the workforce, the question is: how
are students using it and how should they?
According to Lance Choy, director of the
Career Development Center, "any informa
tion you have on the Internet shapes your
personal brand, whether it's on a blog, Face
book, MySpace, articles about you. It's so

easy for people to gather that information
about you by doing a search."
While the concept of personal branding
has been around at least since Tom Peters'
1997 essay "The Brand Called You," the ex
ponential growth of online social media with
in the last decade has dramatically increased
the feasibility of managing one's own brand.
The change stems from the fact that now,
"communication is cheap," said Andreas
Weigend, a professor of management science
and engineering.
Weigend teaches a spring quarter class at
Stanford called "The Social Data Revolution:
Data Mining and Electronic Business," which
carries prerequisites including "intellectual
curiosity" and a "willingness to implement in

the real world."
Whereas in the past, employers had a very
limited ability to communicate with their po
tential employees, "the great thing about the
Web is ... we have more information about
that other person," Weigend said.
"That thing in the past that you put your
resume somewhere, then some recruiters
might come by, and based on that one page of
black dots on paper, they decide to invite you
in, and then based on one other day ... they
make you a job offer what an absurd thing
of the past! The game now is interactivity," he
added.
