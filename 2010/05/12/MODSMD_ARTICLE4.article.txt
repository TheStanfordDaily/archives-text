# SEARCH FOR VICE PROVOST BEGINS
## Search committee, students gather to discuss hopes for Bravman's successor 
### DEVIN BANERJEE SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The search committee for candidates to
replace Vice Provost for Undergraduate Ed
ucation (VPUE) John Bravman '79 M.S. 'Bl
Ph.D. 'B5 met with a small group of students
Tuesday evening as it prepares to provide
Provost John Etchemendy Ph.D. 'B2 a short
list of candidates by Commencement, just
over a month from now.

Bravman, 52, who has served in the posi
tion since 1999, announced last month that
he will leave Stanford to become president
of Bucknell University in Lewisburg, Penn.,
in July.
Committee chair Brad Osgood, the sen
ior associate dean for student affairs in the
School of Engineering, said the purpose of
Tuesday's town hall was "to have students
talk about their views of undergraduate edu
cation." Three students attended the meet
ing, all of whom were representatives from
Students for a Sustainable Stanford (SSS);
each spoke extensively of what he or she
would like to see in the next vice provost.
"I think the next vice provost should be
interactive, very knowledgeable of social
media, someone who's willing to break the
mold and someone who really interacts with
students one-on-one," said Noemi Walze
buck'l3.

Walzebuck shared a story of meeting rep
resentatives from the Living Wage Cam
paign and hearing their frustration that Pres
ident John Hennessy had not granted them a
meeting.
"That's, I think, what we would want the
vice provost not to do," she said.
David Geeter 'll, a co-president of SSS,
stressed his belief that the next vice provost
should emphasize interdisciplinary studies.
"The planet's most pressing challenges
are ones that are interdisciplinary and multi
faceted and require holistic solutions," he
said. "Have we assessed how prepared stu
dents are to meet these challenges?"
Miguel San Pedro 'l2 said he would like
the next vice provost help incoming students
bridge their passions to their academic inter
ests.
"Many of us come here knowing that

we're so multi-faceted," he said. "But it takes
a while for us to zero in on a single field that
we're really passionate about and that we
want to stick with for four years."

Committee members also told the stu
dents the characteristics they would like to
see in the vice provost, who interfaces not
only with students but also with faculty and
fellow administrators.

"It's a position that looks in two directions
at once," said Ramon Saldivar, a professor of
humanities and sciences and the former vice
provost for undergraduate education before
Bravman. "It's very useful to know lots of fac
ulty throughout the University. This person is
going to have to be a great scholar, a good
teacher, a good administrator and a great
people person."
Andrea Lunsford, a professor of English
and the director of the Program in Writing
and Rhetoric (PWR), said the vice provost
will have to be able to persuade both people
at Stanford and Stanford affiliates, including
donors.
"The person needs to be a really, really
strong communicator who is very aware of
the different constituencies and able to speak
compellingly, gracefully and powerfully to
donors, faculty and students," she said.
"I don't think there are many people who
are good at all those things," she added.
Osgood said in the next month, the com
mittee, which is made up of eight faculty and
staff and two students, will sit down with all of
Stanford's deans and the heads of all VPUE
units, which include PWR, Introduction to
the Humanities (IHUM), the Bing Overseas
Studies Program (BOSP) and Undergradu
ate Advising and Research (UAR), among
others.
The committee has also set up an e-mail
account to solicit further input as it continues
its search. Any member of the Stanford com
munity can e-mail the committee at
deansearch@stanford.edu.
"When there's a change in leadership,"
Osgood said, "it's a good time to ask: how are
things? And what opportunities are there to
improve?"
