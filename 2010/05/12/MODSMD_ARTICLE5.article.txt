## DLCL details administrative restructuring Come fall, five literature departments will have common funding and organization 
### KATE ABBOTT DESK EDITOR 
The Division of Literatures, Cultures and Languages
(DLCL) will be reorganized into a single department
beginning in the fall. Provost John Etchemendy Ph.D.
'B2 announced the decision to the Faculty Senate last
month, saying the departments represented within the
division would remain intact and that the change is "for
administrative purposes."
The DLCL currently consists of five departments:
Comparative Literature, French and Italian, German
Studies, Iberian and Latin American Cultures and Slav
ic Languages and Literatures.
The move means the five departments will now share
a single budget, and form "focal groups" to encourage
collaboration across their areas of study.
