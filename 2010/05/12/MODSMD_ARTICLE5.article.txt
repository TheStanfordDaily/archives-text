## DLCL details administrative restructuring Come fall, five literature departments will have common funding and organization 
### KATE ABBOTT DESK EDITOR 
The Division of Literatures, Cultures and Languages
(DLCL) will be reorganized into a single department
beginning in the fall. Provost John Etchemendy Ph.D.
'B2 announced the decision to the Faculty Senate last
month, saying the departments represented within the
division would remain intact and that the change is "for
administrative purposes."
The DLCL currently consists of five departments:
Comparative Literature, French and Italian, German
Studies, Iberian and Latin American Cultures and Slav
ic Languages and Literatures.
The move means the five departments will now share
a single budget, and form "focal groups" to encourage
collaboration across their areas of study.
According to Etchemendy, the
new model will "accommodate bet
ter the kind of intellectual conditions
and interactions demanded of mod
ern literary studies."
"To a faculty member or a student
in any of these departments, nothing
will look any different," said Roland
Greene, the head of the DLCL.
"Money will end up, more or less,
where it ends up now. It's just a ques
tion of whether it starts out at the divi
sional level or at the departmental
level."

"The most important part of [the
reorganization] is the intellectual
part," Greene added. "We spent a lot
of time over the last seven years cre
ating what we used to call research
groups, and now we're going to call
them focal groups, which are com
munities with a common interest
that cut across the departments that
maybe work on things like the novel,
or poetics."
According to Greene, the DLCL
"spent a year thinking about this
particular iteration," and received
help from Richard Sailer, dean of the
School of Humanities and Sciences.
The focal groups are modeled after
the current Philosophy and Litera
ture research group of the division,
which Greene referred to as the
"vanguard" of the project.

"The idea is that one would be
able to get a B.A. in German Studies
with an emphasis in the novel or a
B.A. in Russian with an emphasis in
poetics," Greene said. "One can al
ready do that with Philosophy and

Literature."
Greene said within the national
context, this kind of program is at the
"cutting edge."
"There is a growing sense around
the country that it's becoming hard
er to maintain the old-fashioned jus
tification that literature departments
in French, Italian, Spanish, etc.,
should be completely separate from
each other, and basically have noth
ing to do with each other... we're
taking the lead in seeing what the
next chapter should be," he said.
Italian professor Robert Harri
son, the chair of French and Italian,
said he did not see any advantages to
the new system.
"The plan has been approved and
the general outline of what the new
department would look like and how
it would operate; those details have
been decided," he said. "But we don't
know who the chairman is going to
be, we don't know what the adminis
trative staff is going to look like, and
until those things are in place it's very
difficult to predict how this new de
partment is going to function."
"I continue to believe that the an
tecedent DLCL structure allowed
for the productive collaboration pos
sibilities and that we do not need a
department to enhance collabora
tion," Harrison added.
Greene said the transition to the
fall is a concern.
"What everyone wants to avoid is
the kind of situation where you sim
ply throw a lot of different former
departments into a big catch all de
partment, or you simply consolidate
in some heavy-handed fashion with
out paying attention to that balance
between specificity and collabora
tion," Greene said.
Harrison also raised concerns

about the role the newly organized
division would play in hiring new
faculty, as Etchemendy said the reor
ganization "allows very creative
kinds of new searches and allocation
of the resources."

"All members of the new depart
ment are going to have to participate
in decisions that used to be made by
nine members of the French and Ital
ian [department]," Harrison said, re
ferring to hiring specific people with
in his own department.
"I think that what contemporary
geopolitics have shown us is that
scale is important, that big is not bet
ter. After a certain size, big start
workings again administration," he
added.
Greene maintained that this is
not the case, and that staff would not
be cut either.

"For example, we will still hire
Germanists at the recommendation
of Germanists," he said.
Greene said the only difference
would be that someone from a dif
ferent area of study but with a com
mon interest would be able to also sit
on the hiring committee, as is com
mon practice in other departments.
He anticipates that the formation of
focal groups will make finding this
"outside person" much easier.

He added that the move will, he
hopes, benefit students in the end.
"It's especially exciting for grads
and undergrads because it will give
them good training, in that literary
scholars now need to be very local
and very particular in their training,
but also wide-ranging," Greene said.
"This provides a nice model on how
to do that."
