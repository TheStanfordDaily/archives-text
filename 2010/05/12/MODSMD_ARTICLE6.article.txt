Graduate student Daniel Clark of the graduate Intervarsity Christian Fellowship helped man the second annual Stanford Goat Project event in White Plaza on Tuesday.
The event brought goats, chickens, yaks and water pumps to the plaza to raise awareness of world food prices, hunger and poverty. It benefited the Village Enterprise Fund.
