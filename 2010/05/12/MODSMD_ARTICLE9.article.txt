## Senate leaves ethics bill to next year's leadership Few attend; green events checklist nears wrap-up 
### MARGARET RAWSON 
The ASSU Undergraduate Sen
ate discussed strengthening the role
of the sustainability subcommittee
and scrapped an ethics bill co-au
thored by Senators Shelley Gao 'll
and Brian Wanyoike 'l2 in favor of a
more formal report at Tuesday's
meeting, which seven of 13 senators
attended.
A sustainability sub-committee
bill introduced on Tuesday would
work toward "strengthening and
defining the role of the sustainability
committee," said Appropriations
Chair Anton Zietsman 'l2, who is
also a member of the sustainability
subgroup.
If the bill passes next week, the
sustainability sub-committee would
include representation from the Sen
ate, the ASSU executive cabinet, Stu
dents for a Sustainable Stanford and
the ASSU Green Store. The commit
tee would work with student groups
to plan green events based on a
checklist developed by the Senate, as
well as oversee an account for green
events and a pilot program for
"green consultants," or students
trained to help groups throughout
the process of running events.
The three target areas of the pilot
program would be food, marketing
and event supplies, Zietsman said.
Based on research by Students for a
Sustainable Stanford co-president
Theo Gibbs 'll, fees for sustainable
food could be as much as 40 percent
higher. The bill would reflect this
with a 40 percent increase in the
funding cap for food at events.
Zietsman described the program
as an "educational initiative" that
would provide a valuable way to "in
troduce sustainable practices," an
issue he hopes the 12th Undergradu
ate Senate will continue to push.
The Senate also discussed an
ethics bill co-authored by Gao and
Wanyoike, which outlined new roles
for the Senate Advocacy Commit
tee. Under the bill, the Advocacy
Committee would perform a month
ly review of ASSU and Senate ex
penditures, include an ombudsman
to hear complaints about ASSU offi
cials and committees and provide
recommendations for disciplinary
measures if allegations of miscon
duct by officials are substantiated.
Senator Alex Katz 'l2, the chair
of the Administration & Rules Com
mittee, expressed concerns, saying
some of the bill's goals, such as ex
penditure review and disciplinary
action, are already adequately ad
dressed through other mechanisms.
"The point of an ombudsman is to
be independent and not within the

body," he said. He suggested that
while it would be good to have a cen
tral place for complaints, the next
Senate should decide on the neces
sary infrastructure.
Zietsman said he would favor a
formal process through which
groups could complain about Ap
propriations.
The senators agreed that a formal
report should be written in place of
the bill and given to the 12th Under
graduate Senate.
It is "critical to get the new Senate
invested in this," Gao said. "They
need to feel the responsibility to
work on this."
Next week the Senate is set to
vote on a bill to edit its by-laws, in
corporating legislation from its term
and the past three years. Under the
proposed change to the by-laws,
community groups would be entitled
to $l,OOO more than programming
groups, which currently receive a
maximum of $6,000 in general fees.
Also next week, the Senate plans
to vote on the 2011 Elections Com
mission. Cotis Mitchell 'l2, current as
sistant commissioner for undergrad
uate elections, briefed the Senate on
the committee's nomination of
Jonathan Bakke, a doctoral student in
chemical engineering, for assistant
elections commissioner for graduate
elections; Jean Paul Blanchard' 12 for
assistant elections commissioner for
undergraduate elections; and
Stephen Trusheim 'l3 for elections
commissioner. Nine applicants were
considered for the positions.
All funding bills for the week
were approved.
No bill to dissolve the 11th Senate
was introduced on Tuesday, extend
ing their session to two weeks from
now and making any action by the
newly elected senators unlikely this
academic year. The Senate last week
defeated a bill that would have dis
solved the group this week.
