## Graduate council debriefs post-formal 
### BRIANNA PANG STAFF WRITER 
Discussion over an election regu
lation of the Graduate Student
Council (GSC) engineering district
spots arose during Wednesday
evening's brief council meeting.
Council members also elected new
co-equipment masters.

Coining the regulation "the sepa
rate department rule," GSC member
Addy Satija, a graduate student in
electrical engineering and energy re
sources engineering, proposed an
amendment for its repeal.
The rule, currently in effect, re
quires that the two allotted GSC en
gineering spots must be filled by stu
dents from different engineering dis
ciplines. Satija was concerned that in
certain instances, candidates could
be barred from a council position de
spite winning a qualifying number of
votes simply because of their depart
mental affiliation. For example, if a
candidate received enough district
votes to win an overall GSC position

but was beaten by someone else in
the same department, they would not
be elected unless they won enough
at-large votes.
Defending his position, Satij a pre
pared a PowerPoint presentation to
explain his stance, even though the
rule did not exclude candidates in
this year's election. Satija argued in
favor of a model similar to the cur
rent humanities and sciences district
positions, which he said works more
effectively to diversify its representa
tive voice.

"This rule doesn't actually
achieve actual better representa
tion," Satija said. "By design, fewer
engineers can qualify for the coun
cil," he added.
Council member Tao Chu, a grad
uate student in electrical engineer
ing, agreed, questioning whether or
not the average engineering student
would even mind having a represen
tative from another engineering de
partment.

"How do we know that people
don't want electrical engineering stu-

dents representing them?" Chu said.
"To me, engineering is one big, in
tegrated school," he added.
Adam Beberg, a doctoral student
in computer science, believed the
rule should remain in effect since it
allows for all engineering depart
ments to have a chance at a voice.
"There are a vast number of elec
trical engineers," he said. "[Without
the rule,] they can essentially dwarf
the other departments."
"It's a good rule, so we should leave
it alone," Beberg added. "It's hard for
the rule to actually bump someone off
the GSC anyway. We should let the
other departments in engineering
have their representation."
Satija said the rule had affected
election results at least once in the
past few years. He explained that the
rule had prevented two aeronautics
and astronautics graduate students
from being elected in 2006.
Voting on the amendment will be
pushed back for later weeks to allow
for further debate.

According to Satija, one of the

programming co-chairs, Grad For
mal this weekend was a success, with
only one transport to the emergency
room due to "excessive alcohol con
sumption." Additionally, the student
lost his jacket, he said.
"There was plenty of puking on
the bus, but we didn't get charged for
any of it, so it's okay," Satija said.

ASSU Vice President Kelsei
Wharton 'l2 reported that the execu
tive cabinet members have been an
nounced. The newly chosen chairs
will be meeting the GSC later this
month.

Two co-equipment masters were
approved on Wednesday evening: Ze
Yuan, a graduate student in electrical
engineering, and Di Wang, a gradu
ate student in international policy
studies. Council members also ap
proved $535 for the Stanford India
Association and $4lO for the Associ
ation of Chinese Students and Schol
ars at Stanford.
