## ADVENTURES IN ACADEMIA Should No Child Left Behind extend to universities? 
### Danny Crichton 
In a class as large in scope as the thirty unit
Humßio Core, there are bound to be
some concepts that students remember
better than others. For me, some elements of
proteins come back in a flash, while im
munology seems to be a just a fleeting mem
ory. Why the difference, and more important
ly, is there a pattern in the material that stu
dents remember and the material that they
do not?

This question is at the heart of an ongoing
area of controversy in higher education re
search. Student learning outcomes vary
widely across classes and even universities,
yet there are few accountability measures
taken by schools to ensure that graduates are
learning at the appropriate level. Even if such
data is collected, it is rarely distributed, pre
venting comparative research between insti
tutions that might lead to better education
programs.

As colleges across the country face in
creased scrutiny in state budgets and in front
of Congress, it is imperative that we carefully
evaluate proposals designed to increase ac
countability of academia to ensure that they
do not harm the strengths of our university
system.

One of the last major reforms proposed
came from Former Education Secretary
Margaret Spellings, who proposed a new sys
tem of accreditation of higher education to
address the student outcomes issue.

For those unfamiliar with higher educa
tion governance, accreditation is the primary
means of regulating universities in the Unit
ed States, and organizations like the Western
Association of Schools and Colleges (Stan
ford's accrediting association) perform re
views of campus academics to ensure that
universities are meeting basic standards to
offer degrees.
Unfortunately, accreditation often ig
nores student learning outcomes. In re
sponse, Spellings and her Commission on the
Future of Higher Education wanted to re
place this system with national, unified stan
dards with a testing component similar to No
Child Left Behind. Such a system would have
provided comparative data from all accredit
ed schools in the country, allowing easy com
parison between peer programs.
The plan failed spectacularly, and the
Obama Administration will almost certainly
not revive this proposal. However, the de
bate remains: how much independence
should universities have in administering
their educational programs?
Complicating this question is the recent
increased scrutiny of for-profit colleges. In a
Frontline documentary entitled "College,
Inc." released last week, the reporter targets
for-profit colleges for predatory admissions
practices and for failing to provide adequate
training to graduates. As noted on the pro
gram, the University of Phoenix - the largest
for-profit college - receives more than 80%
of its funding from the federal government in
the form of loans and grants from the GI Bill.
Many of these organizations are also accred
ited like traditional universities such as Stan
ford and the University of Michigan.
This heightened scrutiny leads back to the
Bush-era proposal of nationwide testing, and
there is presumably a strong argument to be
made for it. But just as NCLB straight-jack
eted primary and secondary schools, a similar
program for higher education would dimin
ish innovation, lower standards due to the in
tense pressure to graduate students and en
danger the quality of undergraduate pro
grams in America.
Higher education is the last place to cre

ate standardized curriculums and nationwide
exit examinations. For example, a properly
designed science curriculum allows profes
sors to bring new research into lecture with
out fear of under-preparing students for po
tential standardized tests. Further troubling
would be the erosion of unique and com
pelling interdisciplinary programs like Stan
ford's Fluman Biology and Symbolic Systems
majors due to a focus on pure disciplines.
To be fair, learning outcomes tests would
most likely focus on basic skills like reading
and freshman composition. And I under
stand that not every university in America
has the same standards as America's top
schools. If these are problems, I would direct
attention to the primary and secondary
schools as the location that needs assistance
and not higher education.
Government obviously needs to end the
predatory practices of some institutions
highlighted in the Frontline documentary.
But government also needs to stay away
from implementing rules or laws that stran
gle American higher education under even
more regulation. Universities remain one of
the most innovative and dynamic of Ameri
can enterprises, and it is the free market and
competition of higher education that ensures
that these schools continually strive for the
best standards - not the lowest common de
nominator.

Schools must do their part though to
prove to their students and to the taxpayers
that fund them (either directly or through
federal research grants) that they are provid
ing the services they are claiming. More com
parative student learning outcomes data is
not controversial, and such data should be re
leased as a commitment to accountability.
As higher education receives another
round of scrutiny in the coming years, this
country must resist attempts to damage a sys
tem that works at a fundamental level. Most
schools get it - let's not punish them with a
one-size-fits-all policy aimed at solving vari
ations in learning outcomes.
