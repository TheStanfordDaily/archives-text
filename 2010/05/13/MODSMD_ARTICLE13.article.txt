# LETTER TO THE EDITOR

### 
Dear Editor,
The Editorial Board's piece on May 6,
2010 about Stanford's living wage policy con
tained factual errors and misrepresents how
the living wage policy is applied.
Perhaps the most egregious error is the
lack of understanding about who is actually
making a living wage here on campus. Your
editorial says that "the living wage should be
granted to all university workers for whom a
living wage was promised". This has hap
pened ALL of the more than 12,000 em
ployees paid directly by Stanford plus thou
sands of temporary and casual employees
earn more than the living wage. You also ref
erence the need for an enforcement mecha
nism. We have this in place as well. The Inter
nal Audit department regularly audits con
tractors covered by the living wage policy to
ensure compliance. When we are informed of
a failure to pay the living wage, we promptly
investigate and take corrective action.
The living wage policy applies to regular
employees of contractors who provide serv
ices to the university, including services at
SLAC. There are only two exceptions to this
coverage:
I.The living wage applies to contracts that
have an aggregate value of $lOO,OOO or more.
There are hundreds of contracts put in place
each year. Some are for very small dollar
amounts or are one-time contracts with indi
viduals or small companies that last only a
short time. It would be impossible to monitor
this number of contracts.
2. The living wage does not apply in situa

tions where a contractor's employees are
represented under a collective bargaining
agreement. It would be inappropriate for
Stanford to interfere with the rights of union
ized employees to negotiate a contract with
another employer. Imposing the living wage
policy on a previously negotiated agreement
would be inconsistent with our respect for
the collective bargaining process.
These are reasonable and necessary ex
ceptions to the living wage policy. More de
tails on the policy can be found at
http://fingate.stanford.edU/staff/buypaying/p
olicy_notes/living_wage_benefit_guide.html

The editorial also criticized the Universi
ty for not imposing its living wage policy on
other companies such as the Stanford Hospi
tal, tenants like Hewlett Packard that lease
space at the research park, or companies like
Subway who are vendors on campus. These
are separate corporations from Stanford. It
would be unprecedented and legally unsup
portable for the University to unilaterally
impose its living wage policy on separate
legal entities that have a landlord tenant re
lationship with the university.
To my knowledge, we continue to be the
only large private employer in the bay area
that has a living wage policy. Stanford has
taken a leadership position in instituting this
policy, which is consistent with our long histo
ry of care and concern for all people who are
part of the university community.
