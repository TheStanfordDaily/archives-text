# ALTERNATIVE LIVING... WITHOUT THE NAKED
## Defeating Irrationality For Sustainability 
### Samantha Toh 
Humans are irrational. This is some
thing I have known and even liked
about the human condition; our irra
tionality makes life unpredictable, and there
are things about others and even ourselves
that evade logical explanation. This can be
fascinating; irrationality adds an uncertainty
to our lives that can be charming. It can, how
ever, also lead us to developing destructive
habits, where we become irrationally com
fortable doing things that hurt us - and the
habit defies the logical need to change these
destructive tendencies.

This phenomenon manifests itself in so
many ways - from people comparing them
selves unhealthily to others to people
dwelling on problems without being able to
approach them positively. While irrational
emotional responses are common all around
us, I would like to discuss today a far-reaching
irrationality that I believe is overlooked al
beit important - our irrational approach to
the environment.There is so much we do that
adds to environmental destruction, from
using red plastic cups to leaving the light on
when we leave a room. The green movement
still represents a minority viewpoint, and I
question constantly why it remains that way
when the risks are so significant.
I recently spoke with someone named
Terry, a tall, bear-like man whom I shared a
house with last year. In a game where we
took turns asking one another random ques
tions, I happened to ask, "Terry, what is your
favorite kind of pizza and do you feel respon
sible for the environment?"

Non-sequiturs aside, Terry said something
of infinite wisdom.

"The way the world is, things will not keep
working for long," Terry said, ignoring my
question about the pizza. He furrowed his
brow. Had this been a film about old sages in

the time of Jesus, Terry's bear-like look of se
riousness would have glowed to the rhythmic
strains of a lute.
"Something," Terry continued, "has to
give."
And it is true. The existence of environ
mental destruction makes me angry about
how we as consumers act irresponsibly. De
spite all rational indicators than we should
increase conservation, we cannot. Certainly,
so much of the problem is systemic. Look at
the United States, for example: the failure
that is its public transport system, the spread
out nature of cities, the built-in consumer cul
ture. From these discrete pieces of evidence,
one can understand how environmental ex
ploitation becomes a necessity, and how de
veloping environmental consciousness be
comes difficult.
Personally, I despair at these systemic
problems. They suggest that a top-down
change is necessary, and emphasize the pow
erlessness of individual impact. It causes us to
think of the short-term, insurmountable dif
ficulties of confronting the environmental
problem. In the short-run, these difficulties
are high while the costs are low. What we
lack, however, is the ability to look rationally
into the long-run, where net outcomes are
bound to be terrible for most of the world if
we do not change our current habits.
Individuals bonding together, however,
can begin to change a system. In the past few

weeks, I have talked to various people impas
sioned by the need for environmental
change, and who are working to change the
way institutions work. Students for a Sustain
able Stanford, for example, is petitioning to
widen our GER options to include one on
sustainability. Stanford Student Enterprises
is trying to collect discarded items at the end
of the year, putting them together in a rum
mage sale for next year's students. The Stan
ford Farm Project is trying to promote local
food growing on the Stanford campus and
raise awareness about food production.
What makes me feel even more hopeful is
the fact that environmental consciousness
can be mobilized into action outside these
environmental-themed organizations. Last
weekend, refreshing Facebook in a fit of
rabid procrastination, I received a message
informing me thatTheta Delt was using recy
clable cups for their Friday party. In that sec
ond, my heart swelled with pride not only
was there going to be a party named after a
fake dinosaur on campus, it was going to be a
party more ecological than most.
The few changes I witness around me
make me feel motivated to change my own
behavior patterns. I recycle more, eat less
meat and shop less. This, however, is far from
a conclusion; I am just beginning to open a
can of worms, and learning about shifting in
dividual action to a group- or system-level
change to better the environmental state.
How can one fix global myopia when it
comes to environmental action? How can we
make people act more rationally and respon
sibly? These are questions that I am just be
ginning to muddle through, and wondering if
you could answer.

Basically, Sam would love to hear your opin
ion. Email her at samtoh@stanford.edu.
