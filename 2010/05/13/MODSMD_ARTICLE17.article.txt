## Don't close the book on LeBron

With three of the four
NBA conference
semifinals decided
by a sweep, all eyes
were on the Celtics-
Cavaliers series on Tuesday night,
where the two elite clubs were set for
battle in Cleveland to break a 2-2 series
tie. At the time, the series was marred
by a collection of blowouts and under
achieving team performances. When
one side looked dominant and poised
to take a commanding lead, it would
immediately falter in the next game.
From a team basketball perspective,
the series was pretty dreadful.
However, the matchup still brought
all the intrigue and excitement as ex
pected, thanks to monster performanc
es by Cavs forward Leßron James (21
points in the first quarter of Game 3)
and Boston guard Rajon Rondo (a 29-
point, 18-rebound and 13-assist triple
double in Game 4). Hype was still pres
ent, and I knew that it was just a matter
of time before two juggernauts began
to play like two juggernauts.
With the series knotted, there was
no way that the reigning MVP and the
2008 NBA Champions would allow the
game to get out of hand in either direc
tion. Neither team was accustomed to
blowouts, and neither was known for
throwing in the towel before the final
buzzer sounded. As Game 5 the cru
cial tiebreaker rolled around Tues
day night, I was thinking the game
would come down to the final posses
sion. What did I get?
One of the worst performances of
James' career, leading to the worst
home loss in Cleveland history by a
score of 120-88.
Talk on Wednesday morning sur
rounded Leßron. James finished the
game hitting just three of his 14 at
tempts from the field while turning the
ball over three times along the way.
