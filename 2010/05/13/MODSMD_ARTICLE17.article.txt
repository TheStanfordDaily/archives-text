## Don't close the book on LeBron 
### Zach Zimmerman Dishing the Rock 
With three of the four
NBA conference
semifinals decided
by a sweep, all eyes
were on the Celtics-
Cavaliers series on Tuesday night,
where the two elite clubs were set for
battle in Cleveland to break a 2-2 series
tie. At the time, the series was marred
by a collection of blowouts and under
achieving team performances. When
one side looked dominant and poised
to take a commanding lead, it would
immediately falter in the next game.
From a team basketball perspective,
the series was pretty dreadful.
However, the matchup still brought
all the intrigue and excitement as ex
pected, thanks to monster performanc
es by Cavs forward Leßron James (21
points in the first quarter of Game 3)
and Boston guard Rajon Rondo (a 29-
point, 18-rebound and 13-assist triple
double in Game 4). Hype was still pres
ent, and I knew that it was just a matter
of time before two juggernauts began
to play like two juggernauts.
With the series knotted, there was
no way that the reigning MVP and the
2008 NBA Champions would allow the
game to get out of hand in either direc
tion. Neither team was accustomed to
blowouts, and neither was known for
throwing in the towel before the final
buzzer sounded. As Game 5 the cru
cial tiebreaker rolled around Tues
day night, I was thinking the game
would come down to the final posses
sion. What did I get?
One of the worst performances of
James' career, leading to the worst
home loss in Cleveland history by a
score of 120-88.
Talk on Wednesday morning sur
rounded Leßron. James finished the
game hitting just three of his 14 at
tempts from the field while turning the
ball over three times along the way.
Shaquille O'Neal his 38-year-old

center outshined him despite run
ning the floor like a wounded elephant.
Leßron looked sluggish and apathetic,
uncomfortable and uninvolved. His
body language was foul, and Cavs fans
ended the game by booing their 61-win
team off the floor.

National pundits instantly began
their speculation. Maybe this was his
final statement to a team that failed to
surround him with the necessary tal
ent? Maybe his elbow was giving him
fits? Maybe he's just not a winner?

I will be the first to admit that
James played far below his potential.
It's not that his numbers were partic
ularly awful; they just weren't up to
the expected Leßron standards. He
absolutely looked like a guy that felt
entitled to taking a game off and one
that just didn't care. But do you know
what he didn't look like?

A guy that would let it happen
again.

Now I'm not one to defend Le-
Bron by any means. His ego rivals his
6-8, 250-pound frame, and he didn't
take a lot of responsibility for his play
last night. In fact, he went as far as to

say, "I spoil a lot of people with my
play. When you have three bad games
in seven years, it's easy to point them
out." Good lord. There's no denying
that he believes he is "The Chosen
One," and NBA fans, including my
self, have every right to hate him for it.
But if you think he'll go 3-14 in
Game 6 tonight, you are out of your
mind. Regardless of how badly he
wants to leave Cleveland, or how
much his elbow does or doesn't hurt,
or even how much he desires to send
a message to his underperforming
teammates, James isn't one to be
made a fool. And the Boston Celtics
did just that, causing him to look like
a guy that didn't belong in the play
offs.

And more power to them. Stop
ping the best player on the planet is
not an easy task, and they managed to
frustrate him for the entire game. Un
fortunately for Celtics nation, Game
5 will, in my opinion, catalyze one of
Leßron's best playoff performances
ever. I expect him to go off for no less
than 30 points tonight while sending
the series back to Cleveland for
Game 7. Quitting is one way to send a
message, but is there a better way to
shut up your unappreciative fans and
the hypercritical media than by drop
ping 45 the night after they verbally
crucified you?

My friend echoed these state
ments yesterday morning by asking,
"is it just me, or doesn't it feel like
there is a 25-percent chance that Fri
day morning they all will be talking
about Leßron's performance as one
of the greatest in history?"
I know that we all love conspiracy
theories, especially when they sur
round those that appear immortal.
The guy had a bad game, and he de
serves criticism for it. But to come on
Sports Center to discuss his mental
fortitude and his future plans is just
silly. The bottom line is, whether you
love him or hate him, you'd want him
on your team, and these types of per
formances are few and far between.

Maybe tonight he'll prove me
wrong and tank again. But for some
one that averaged close to a triple
double over the course of an entire
NBA season, the chances of that hap
pening are fairly slim. Celtics fans
may want to delay their celebration
plans for another day, because I high
ly doubt that this series will end in six.

And if it does, than so be it. The
Bulls or Knicks may soon have a lot
more fans.

entitled to taking a game off and one
that just didn't care. But do you know
what he didn't look like?

A guy that would let it happen
again.

Now I'm not one to defend Le-
Bron by any means. His ego rivals his
6-8, 250-pound frame, and he didn't
take a lot of responsibility for his play
last night. In fact, he went as far as to

say, "I spoil a lot of people with my
play. When you have three bad games
in seven years, it's easy to point them
out." Good lord. There's no denying
that he believes he is "The Chosen
One," and NBA fans, including my
self, have every right to hate him for it.
But if you think he'll go 3-14 in
Game 6 tonight, you are out of your
mind. Regardless of how badly he
wants to leave Cleveland, or how
much his elbow does or doesn't hurt,
or even how much he desires to send
a message to his underperforming
teammates, James isn't one to be
made a fool. And the Boston Celtics
did just that, causing him to look like
a guy that didn't belong in the play
offs.

And more power to them. Stop
ping the best player on the planet is
not an easy task, and they managed to
frustrate him for the entire game. Un
fortunately for Celtics nation, Game
5 will, in my opinion, catalyze one of
Leßron's best playoff performances
ever. I expect him to go off for no less
than 30 points tonight while sending
the series back to Cleveland for
Game 7. Quitting is one way to send a
message, but is there a better way to
shut up your unappreciative fans and
the hypercritical media than by drop
ping 45 the night after they verbally
crucified you?

My friend echoed these state
ments yesterday morning by asking,
"is it just me, or doesn't it feel like
there is a 25-percent chance that Fri
day morning they all will be talking
about Leßron's performance as one
of the greatest in history?"
I know that we all love conspiracy
theories, especially when they sur
round those that appear immortal.
The guy had a bad game, and he de
serves criticism for it. But to come on
Sports Center to discuss his mental
fortitude and his future plans is just
silly. The bottom line is, whether you
love him or hate him, you'd want him
on your team, and these types of per
formances are few and far between.

Maybe tonight he'll prove me
wrong and tank again. But for some
one that averaged close to a triple
double over the course of an entire
NBA season, the chances of that hap
pening are fairly slim. Celtics fans
may want to delay their celebration
plans for another day, because I high
ly doubt that this series will end in six.

And if it does, than so be it. The
Bulls or Knicks may soon have a lot
more fans.
