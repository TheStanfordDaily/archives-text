## Women's lacrosse to compete in NCAA Tournament for second time in school history and first since 2006 
### CHRIS JUHNKE DESK EDITOR 
Redemption was sweet for the Stanford
women's lacrosse team as it advanced to the
NCAA Tournament with a win over the Uni
versity of Massachusetts at home in the
NCAA play-in game just one year after being
snubbed by the selection committee.

Last year, after a win against No. 3 Penn in its
regular season finale, the team had its hopes
dashed by being left out of the tournament,
but this year the Cardinal was able to play its
way into the tournament.

A rule change that gave the MPSF Tourna
ment champion a berth to the NCAA play-in
game allowed Stanford to control its own fate
and now, after a 15-12 win over UMass on Sat

urday at Laird Q. Cagan Stadium, the Cardinal
has made it to the NCAA Tournament. In the
first round, it will face No. 5 seed James Madi
son, champions of the Colonial Athletic Asso
ciation and one of the top teams in the nation.
The Cardinal looked liked it belonged in
just its second NCAA Tournament appear
ance all-time, the first coming in 2006 when
Stanford lost to Northwestern in the first

round. With an NCAA Tournament berth on
the line, both teams came out swinging, and
UMass was able to jump out to an early 4-2
lead in the first NCAA women's lacrosse play
off game ever played in California.
However, Stanford wasn't going to let its
chance at the NCAA Tournament slip away so

Redshirt junior Lauren Schmidt, the two-time MPSF Player of the Year, led the Stanford women's lacrosse team with three goals and an assist in the Cardinal's 15-12 victory over Massachusetts in
the NCAA play-in game. With the win, Stanford advanced to the NCAA Tournament for only the second time in school history. The Cardinal's first test will be against No. 5 seed James Madison.
easily. The Cardinal came roaring
back to take an 11-8 lead into half
time and never relinquished it. In the
second half, the teams traded goals,
with each scoring four, resulting in a
final score of 15-12 in favor of the
Cardinal.

UMass's Merritt Cosgrove had a
hat trick in the first half for the Min
utewomen, which contributed to
their early lead. However, she re
ceived two yellow cards, forcing her
to leave the game early.
Junior Sarah Flynn led Stanford
in the match, scoring five goals on
only seven shots for an impressive
shooting percentage of 71 percent.
Fellow junior and MPSF Player of
the Year Lauren Schmidt also had an
impressive outing, scoring three
goals and an assist in the winning ef
fort. In goal, Annie Read played well
for the Card, turning in a six-save
performance that supported the im
pressive offensive effort by Stan
ford.

With the win, the Cardinal ad
vanced to the NCAA Tournament
and merely had to wait until the next
day to find out who its opponent
would be. That opponent turned out
to be No. 7 James Madison, who
earned the fifth seed in the tourna
ment and drew the unseeded Cardi
nal in the first round.
The Cardinal has faced the Dukes
on two previous occasions recently,

in 2007 and 2008, with James Madi
son taking both of the hard-fought
contests by one goal. In the midst of
a great year for the program, James
Madison only has two losses all sea
son, road games to No. 13 Loyola and
No. 1 Maryland. Stanford will have
to overcome even more history, as
James Madison is 5-0 in NCAA first
round games at home.
Leading the Dukes on offense are
Kim Griffin, who leads the team with
60 points, and Mary Kate Lomady,
who has a team-high 44 goals on the

season. Monica Zabel has 31 assists
on the year for James Madison, while
goalie Kelly Morgan has a 6.78 goals
against average and has recorded
115 saves this year.
The match begins at 10 a.m. PST
on Saturday at James Madison in
Harrisonburg, Va. The winner of the
game faces the winner of the match
between Georgetown and Syracuse
in the NCAA quarterfinals.
