## Women's lacrosse to compete in NCAA Tournament for second time in school history and first since 2006 
### CHRIS JUHNKE DESK EDITOR 
Redemption was sweet for the Stanford
women's lacrosse team as it advanced to the
NCAA Tournament with a win over the Uni
versity of Massachusetts at home in the
NCAA play-in game just one year after being
snubbed by the selection committee.

Last year, after a win against No. 3 Penn in its
regular season finale, the team had its hopes
dashed by being left out of the tournament,
but this year the Cardinal was able to play its
way into the tournament.

A rule change that gave the MPSF Tourna
ment champion a berth to the NCAA play-in
game allowed Stanford to control its own fate
and now, after a 15-12 win over UMass on Sat

urday at Laird Q. Cagan Stadium, the Cardinal
has made it to the NCAA Tournament. In the
first round, it will face No. 5 seed James Madi
son, champions of the Colonial Athletic Asso
ciation and one of the top teams in the nation.
The Cardinal looked liked it belonged in
just its second NCAA Tournament appear
ance all-time, the first coming in 2006 when
Stanford lost to Northwestern in the first

round. With an NCAA Tournament berth on
the line, both teams came out swinging, and
UMass was able to jump out to an early 4-2
lead in the first NCAA women's lacrosse play
off game ever played in California.
However, Stanford wasn't going to let its
chance at the NCAA Tournament slip away so
