# FINISHING STRONG
## Softball looks to end skid in season's final series 
### KABIR SAWHNEY DESK EDITOR 
With the regular season coming to a close,
the Stanford Softball team will try to use its re
maining games to build momentum for the
postseason. The No. 17 Cardinal (33-17, 5-13
Pac-10) has one conference series left a
three-game showdown at home against Ore
gon.
After a strong start to the season, Stanford
has played poorly, going 3-12 in its last 15
games, with two of those wins coming against
weaker, nonconference opponents. Arizona,
UCLA and Washington have all swept the
Card.
The No. 1 Huskies (43-5,15-3 Pac-10) dealt
Stanford a couple of tough losses last week
end, with two of the three games decided by
slim, one-run margins.
The series victory secured the conference
title for Washington.
"We have to bounce back," said head coach
John Rittman. "We could have won two of
those games."
Stanford's last chance to improve its for
tunes will come this weekend against the No.
20 Ducks (33-16,8-10). Like Stanford, Oregon
had a hot start to its conference season but has
fizzled out somewhat since. It has lost its last
four series, against Washington, Arizona State,
UCLA and Arizona. However, the Ducks
managed to salvage a win in each one of those
series, except against the Bruins.
Oregon currently sits in fifth place in the
Pac-10, a game behind the Sun Devils. Stan
ford is seventh in the standings, out of the cel
lar by just a game over Oregon State,
"Oregon is a much improved team,"
Rittman said. "They have four good pitchers
they can go to, so it's going to be a challenge for
us. We have to bring our 'A' game to win this
weekend."

The No. 17 Stanford Softball team has struggled recently, losing 12 of its past 15 games.
The Cardinal will look to break that streak this weekend when it takes on No. 20 Oregon.
