# FINISHING STRONG
## Softball looks to end skid in season's final series 
### KABIR SAWHNEY DESK EDITOR 
With the regular season coming to a close,
the Stanford Softball team will try to use its re
maining games to build momentum for the
postseason. The No. 17 Cardinal (33-17, 5-13
Pac-10) has one conference series left a
three-game showdown at home against Ore
gon.
After a strong start to the season, Stanford
has played poorly, going 3-12 in its last 15
games, with two of those wins coming against
weaker, nonconference opponents. Arizona,
UCLA and Washington have all swept the
Card.
The No. 1 Huskies (43-5,15-3 Pac-10) dealt
Stanford a couple of tough losses last week
end, with two of the three games decided by
slim, one-run margins.
The series victory secured the conference
title for Washington.
"We have to bounce back," said head coach
John Rittman. "We could have won two of
those games."
Stanford's last chance to improve its for
tunes will come this weekend against the No.
20 Ducks (33-16,8-10). Like Stanford, Oregon
had a hot start to its conference season but has
fizzled out somewhat since. It has lost its last
four series, against Washington, Arizona State,
UCLA and Arizona. However, the Ducks
managed to salvage a win in each one of those
series, except against the Bruins.
Oregon currently sits in fifth place in the
Pac-10, a game behind the Sun Devils. Stan
ford is seventh in the standings, out of the cel
lar by just a game over Oregon State,
"Oregon is a much improved team,"
Rittman said. "They have four good pitchers
they can go to, so it's going to be a challenge for
us. We have to bring our 'A' game to win this
weekend."
The Ducks' pitching staff is one of the

The No. 17 Stanford Softball team has struggled recently, losing 12 of its past 15 games.
The Cardinal will look to break that streak this weekend when it takes on No. 20 Oregon.
team's strengths. Unlike many teams,
which rely on a single, dominant
pitcher, Oregon uses two starters in
tandem Jessica Moore and Sam
Skillingstad. Moore has an ERA of
1.64 and a 14-10 record, while
Skillingstad has posted a 2.60 ERA
and an 11-5 record.

Overall, the Oregon staff has a
team ERA of 2.22, slightly better
than Stanford's combined ERA of
2.57.

Neither Duck starter should pro
vide a similar challenge to last week
end, when the Card faced off against
Danielle Lawrie, arguably the best
college pitcher in the country.
Offensively, Oregon is led by
right fielder Sam Pappas, who is hit
ting .407 with 46 RBIs and 11 home
runs on the year. Left fielder Allie
Burger, the leadoff hitter, should
also pose a challenge to Stanford

she is hitting .400 for the season with
24 RBIs.

Stanford's pitching staff has been
the team's strength over the past few
weeks, and the Cardinal will look to
continue that success against the
Ducks. Junior pitcher Ashley Chinn,
Stanford's likely starter for all three
games this weekend, does not have
flattering stats she owns an 8-8
record and a 2.97 ERA for the sea
son. However, she has shown flashes
of brilliance in her last two series.
Chinn gave up just three runs in her

two starts against the Huskies and
combined with freshman Jenna Rich
to hold Arizona State to just six runs
in three games two weeks ago.
Also notable for Stanford's pitch
ing is the return of freshman Teagan
Gerhart, who emerged as the Card's
ace prior to an injury a month ago.
According to Rittman, Gerhart's
status is currently up in the air, with

no definite timetable for her return.
She did enter the Washington series
as a pinch runner, indicating that her
return to the circle may be immi
nent.

Rittman, though, will continue to
exercise caution.

"We'd like to have her back as
healthy as possible for the postsea
son," he said.
On the offensive side, Stanford
will have to improve on its perform
ance from last weekend in order to
have a shot at taking down Oregon.
The Cardinal lineup has performed
abysmally over the team's slump
it only scored one run in three games
against the Huskies, and it scored
only two runs in the team's two loss
es to the Sun Devils.
While senior left fielder Alissa
Haber has been performing well,
maintaining a .437 batting average,
the rest of the lineup has not fol
lowed suit. Collectively, the Cardinal
is hitting just .292.
"We're getting ourselves oppor
tunities, but we're not getting timely
hits," Rittman said. "We need to
work on continuing to hit pitches in
the zone."

Stanford will play Oregon at Smith
Family Stadium today through Satur
day. Today's game starts at 7 p.m.
