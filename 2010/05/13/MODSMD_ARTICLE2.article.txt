# Re-evaluating undergrad education
## Town hall continues discussion of non-major requirements 
### TROY YANG STAFF WRITER 
Some 50 students and faculty met at the
Bechtel International Center on Wednesday
evening to discuss a University effort to re
shape the undergraduate general education
curriculum. This meeting, arranged by com
mittee members of the Study of Undergradu
ate Education at Stanford (SUES) and mod
erated by Jim Campbell, a history professor
and co-chair of SUES, served as an opportuni
ty for faculty to listen to and assess student
perspectives regarding general education re
quirements and the greater educational goals
of the University.

Recognizing the drastic changes that Stan
ford has undergone in the last decade, the ad
ministration is making an effort to reassess the
makeup of a Stanford education, something
that has not been done comprehensively since
the 1993-1994 academic year.
Provost John Etchemendy Ph.D. 'B2 and
Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education
John Bravman '79 M.S. 'Bl Ph.D. 'B5 rolled out
the study in February.

On Wednesday, study co-chair Harry
Elam, a drama professor, said general educa
tion requirements are a focal point of SUES.
"What we're really trying to do is think
about the rationale what general educa
tion requirements are there and what general
education requirements are supposed to do,"
said Elam in his opening address to the stu
dents. "What is most important to us is your
perspective on where general education is at
Stanford."

Student responses were diverse, with some
upperclassmen saying, in retrospect, that they

were enriched by their experiences in Intro
duction to the Humanities (IHUM) and the
Program in Writing and Rhetoric (PWR).
Others pushed for making drastic changes to
the general education curriculum by either re
ducing or completely eliminating IHUM and
other general education requirements.
"The balance is between giving a little bit
of guidance and giving students freedom to
move," said Julie Kennedy, a senior lecturer in
Earth Systems and a member of the SUES
committee. "This is important and this is
something we can think about, not just broad
ly for four years, but most pressingly for fresh
man year."

There was also lively discussion about
bridging the perceived social-intellectual di
vide between "fuzzies" and "techies." The 19
members of the SUES committee, who come
from a variety of departments and intellectual
backgrounds, were especially interested in
making Stanford a more interdisciplinary and
integrated school that trained students who
could function as productive citizens.
"A lot of the key issues around interdisci
plinary studies at Stanford and what it means
to be an educated citizen were brought up
tonight and I'm glad that happened," said
Theo Gibbs 'll after the meeting had conclud
ed. "I definitely think it's time for reform. I
think there's still a culture of division [be
tween techies and fuzzies] and I don't think
that's productive."

Committee members asked students how
they felt this gap could be bridged. Several stu
dents responded by emphasizing the impor
tance of the Education for Citizenship re
quirements.

"The reason I came here tonight is because

when you do your introductory classes, you
get stuck in this rabbit hole, and you forget
why you're here at Stanford; you forget the
bigger picture," said Nishant Jacob 'l3. "I think
it's refreshing to be reminded again what I'm
truly here for."

The discussion last night was one of a series
of talks held by the SUES committee, which
has been spending winter and spring quarters
in discussion with students. Next year, SUES

will be dedicated to more sustained and fo
cused discussions about general education re
quirement details, Campbell said.
"We talked to the ASSU last quarter and
this quarter we've been seeing students every
Wednesday night at their dorms," Elam said.
"I'm guessing at the end of this quarter we'll
have talked to at least 200 students directly..
. we also have questions on the sophomore
and senior surveys directly related to our

work."
"I don't want to speculate on what we will
change or won't change because I truly don't
know," he added. "If all goes well, we will com
plete our work in the summer of 2011 and
bring a report to the Faculty Senate in the fall
of 2011, which will most likely include some
suggestions for changes."
