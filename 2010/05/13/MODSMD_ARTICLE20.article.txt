# HEAD TO HEAD:
## Bigger influence: passion or money? Money drives modern sports 
### Justin Marpole-Bird 
Forty years ago, athletes were con
sidered amateurs. For the most
part, they eschewed endorse
ment contracts from major shoe
manufacturers and other sport
ing companies. The Amateur Athletic
Union in the United States, the Amateur
Athletic Association in Great Britain and
similar organizations in other countries
watched every penny that changed hands in
a hawkish manner that would put the
NCAA's auditors to shame. Many a talent
ed and capable athlete went without mak
ing any reasonable amount of money in
sport for the dream of competing in events
that required retention of one's amateur
status, such as the Olympic Games, the
World Cup and Grand Slam Tennis Cham
pionships.

Now, more and more leagues and sports
have made the move toward professional
ism. Sports management emerged as a pro
fession in the late 1970s and early 1980s,
and major amateur championships began
to admit more and more professionals to
compete. As might be anticipated, a greater
number of sportsmen and women began to
leave the amateur ranks in an attempt to
keep up with focused, single-minded pro
fessionals. With the exception of student
athletes in the collegiate leagues such as
the NCAA and NAIA, most serious ath
letes are of the professional nature (receiv-
ing remuneration for their efforts).
With the possible exception of
these university leagues where, at
least officially, academics are the
first priority, money drives profes
sional sports and is consistently the
motivating force behind most of its
changes. Teams like the New York
Yankees in the MLB, Manchester
United and Chelsea in the English
Premier League, the Washington
Redskins of the NFL and the New
York Rangers of the NHL spend
hundreds of millions of dollars re
cruiting and paying players. Last
year, the Redskins spent over $126
million in salaries alone to resurrect
their slumping franchise.
In many cases these GMs may
even risk the franchise's longevity or
the loyalty of its fans for moves they
feel may better their own financial
standing. One need look no further
than Brett Favre's exit from Green
Bay in March of 2008 after long
standing disagreements with GM

Ted Thompson. Perhaps Thompson
was trying to unload a flickering star
in danger of extinguishing, maybe
he was trying to lighten the payroll
or maybe he just did not like Favre,
but one thing is very clear: the man
agement has no sympathy for those
who mistake sport for a friendly
business.

GMs, club owners, endorsement
agents and club presidents are not in it
for enjoyment (at least not entirely)
they are not in it to make all the
people in Packers jerseys at Lambeau
look up to Brett Favre, they are not in
terested in English soccer fans feeling
patriotic when watching Englishmen
take center stage at Old Trafford or
Highbury; they are in it to make
money.
This is how the rest of the world
works, and why should it not be ex
tended to sport? Franchises that make
decisions based on what is best for the
fans and the players are doomed to
failure. Remember the Quebec
Nordiques? Well, now they are the
Colorado Avalanche, but before that
they may have been one of the most
revered teams in sports, and certainly
had the NHL's most loyal fan base.
Everyone know Canadians love

hockey, and among Canadians,
French-Canadians are consistently
the most fanatic. Sadly though, despite
the players loving the atmosphere in
Quebec City and the people proud to
have them there, the franchise packed
up and moved across the border.
Why? Money. There simply were
not enough people coming to games
for the franchise to stay afloat.The en
tire population of Quebec could have
come to every single game and it still
might not have made a difference.
Now, those hockey fans might be the
most loyal fans any team could ask for
and the team undoubtedly did a lot of
good things for the community, but in
the end, the GM had to make the
choice to move the team.

Without money, professional
sports will fall apart, because since the
end of amateurism, sport has become
a business, and businesses revolve
around money. To see it any other way
is just naive. Athletes must continue to
look to their balance books and bank
accounts, or regardless of how much
they love their sport, they will be retir
ing early.
