# Sports are about fans and their passion
## 
### Tom Taylor 
First and foremost, sport is about
passion. It's about standing side
by-side with your fellow fans,
about singing and chanting until
your voice gives out, about living
and dying on the outcome of the game being
played out in front of you.
It's about wearing your team's colors as
you walk out to defend the honor of those
cheering you on, about how deep those col
ors run, coursing through your veins.
In the capitalist society where we live,
money seems all-powerful, but as the old
adage goes, "money can't buy happiness."
And it cannot buy passion.
Since the advent of truly professional
sports, many teams have been bewitched by
the lure of untold riches, but you do not need
to look far to find parables of the danger of
this attraction. The recent financial collapse
has again shown us that the greedy goal of
simply amassing money for the sake of
money can be an incredibly destructive
human trait.
Bankers became entirely divested from
those they were borrowing money from,
and those they were lending money to. In
stead of helping nurture growing businesses
and providing financial help to consumers
while taking a modest cut, they began to
chase nothing but their own personal ambi
tions. It was clear that making quick gains
and paying themselves ungodly bonuses
was more important than anything
else. Not the economy, not the compa
nies they worked for, and certainly not
the honest, hard-working folk who
turned to them for loans and to respon
sibly invest their savings.
The same is true in sport. When
money men spend big and risk every

thing for success and the prizes it could
bring, it is the little guy, the fan whose
life revolves around his club, who is left
out in the cold as the grandiose plans
crumble to nothing.

The real team is not the suits in the
boardroom, or the players out on the
field, it is the fans. The people who show
up come rain or shine, who don't come
for the prawn sandwiches and hospital
ity, who don't come because they are
paid to, and who will be there long after
the glory days are gone.

That owners often do not under

stand this is obvious. In football, there
are many examples of teams commit
ting the ultimate betrayal and desert
ing their fans to relocate to a new city,
the Oakland/LA Raiders being one.
Over here, this concept seems an ac
cepted business model, but back home
it drives fear into the heart of every real
fan. The thought of Americans owning
English teams is one of our greatest
fears, not because of latent xenopho
bia, but because of the concern that
they know nothing about, and care
nothing for, the teams they invest in.
Manchester United, one of the
biggest soccer teams in the world, has
for several years been owned by the
Glazer family. Somehow they were
able to buy the club by leveraging its
worth against a loan, and then this loan
was moved onto the team itself. Now
the Glazers owe nothing while the club
is in the red with phenomenal debts of
over 700 million pounds (1 billion dol
lars).
It is unthinkable that such a big club
could go bankrupt,but it is not unheard
of Smaller teams have been relegated
for financial irregularities, and others
have closed their gates for the last time,
destroying whole communities of fans.

On the other side of the scale is FC
Barcelona. This team could also put
forward a case for being the biggest
club in the world, but unlike others, it is
owned and run by the fans. It is a rich
and successful team, but it is this with
out needing to be all consumed by the
quest for money. Instead of cashing in
on lucrative shirt sponsorships, it sports
the UNICEF logo, and donates 1.5 mil
lion euros (1.9 million dollars) a year to
the charity.
While it is indisputable that money
is an integral part of a large, modern
sports team, what this highlights is that
spending huge is neither a secret to suc
cess nor a requirement. Teams need to
be run responsibly and need to know
that their greatest asset is not the mil
lions in the bank, nor the size of their
stadiums or the overhyped, overvalued
and overpaid "stars" who take the
field.

It is the passion and devotion of the
real fans.
