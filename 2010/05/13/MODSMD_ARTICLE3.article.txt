## City looks to landfills Palo Alto City Council approves new contract with landfill gas energy firm 
### ADAM COLE STAFF WRITER 
As oil companies search for untapped
reservoirs and engineers struggle to develop
cheaper renewable energy, usable natural
gas seeps daily from the world's landfills.
Now, after a heavily debated decision by the
Palo Alto City Council, landfill gas from
Bay Area facilities could power local homes.
In a 5-4 vote last Monday, the council ap
proved two contracts with Ameresco, a
company that plans to generate electricity
using gas produced during the breakdown
of refuse in landfills. Deep wells in the hills
of waste will literally vacuum up the gas and
send it to an internal combustion engine,
"It's important to use the methane be
cause otherwise it will enter the atmosphere
and contribute to global warming," said civil
and environmental engineering Prof. Craig
Criddle Ph.D. 'B9, who studies green energy.
He explained that methane acts as a
greenhouse gas 24 times more powerful
than carbon dioxide.
"This is a low-hanging fruit of climate
change mitigation," he said. "But globally, 90
percent of landfills do not capture their gas."
Landfills in the United States are re
quired by law to carefully monitor and limit
gas emissions, according to Michael Carroll,
a senior engineer at a San Joaquin landfill
where Ameresco will harvest some of its gas.
In the San Joaquin Valley, captured gas is
currently disposed of through combustion.
This process, called "flaring," reduces green
house gas impact by 90 percent and smog by
92 percent, but produces no energy.
