## City looks to landfills Palo Alto City Council approves new contract with landfill gas energy firm 
### ADAM COLE STAFF WRITER 
As oil companies search for untapped
reservoirs and engineers struggle to develop
cheaper renewable energy, usable natural
gas seeps daily from the world's landfills.
Now, after a heavily debated decision by the
Palo Alto City Council, landfill gas from
Bay Area facilities could power local homes.
In a 5-4 vote last Monday, the council ap
proved two contracts with Ameresco, a
company that plans to generate electricity
using gas produced during the breakdown
of refuse in landfills. Deep wells in the hills
of waste will literally vacuum up the gas and
send it to an internal combustion engine,
"It's important to use the methane be
cause otherwise it will enter the atmosphere
and contribute to global warming," said civil
and environmental engineering Prof. Craig
Criddle Ph.D. 'B9, who studies green energy.
He explained that methane acts as a
greenhouse gas 24 times more powerful
than carbon dioxide.
"This is a low-hanging fruit of climate
change mitigation," he said. "But globally, 90
percent of landfills do not capture their gas."
Landfills in the United States are re
quired by law to carefully monitor and limit
gas emissions, according to Michael Carroll,
a senior engineer at a San Joaquin landfill
where Ameresco will harvest some of its gas.
In the San Joaquin Valley, captured gas is
currently disposed of through combustion.
This process, called "flaring," reduces green
house gas impact by 90 percent and smog by
92 percent, but produces no energy.
"With the landfill-gas-to-energy
project, we're using a fuel that is al
ready being collected, and we're glad
it can be used as energy," Carroll
said.

Based on the amount collected
each day, he predicted the wasted gas
could consistently power around
4,000 homes.

Several council members said the
newly approved commitment posed
a financial and environmental risk to
the city. Council member Greg
Schmid worried that the council em
braced this opportunity without fully
investigating the potential indirect
environmental impacts of the
process.

"It appeared to me as a non-sci
entist that more research needed to

be done," he said.
Carroll said the electricity pro
duction does release slightly more
nitrous oxides than flaring. Nitrous
oxides are important components of
smog.

Mayor Pat Burt and council
member Karen Holman had other
trepidations.

"Environmentally, I was con
cerned that the particular landfills
involved do not have the best prac
tices," Burt said.
San Joaquin Valley landfills still
accept some recyclable and com
postable materials. Carroll said most
of these items are removed before
they even reach the landfill, but
more rigorous sorting is not econom
ically feasible.
"San Joaquin Valley waste man
agement is funded almost entirely by
our clients, so every decision is an
economic decision," Carroll said.

The landfill gas project is only possi
ble because towns like Palo Alto are

willing to pay for it, Carroll said.
According to Schmid, landfill gas
energy is currently the cheapest op
tion for expanding Palo Alto's alter
native energy portfolio.
"As a leading city we want to be
out there grabbing the best deals,"
Schmid said.
With the contribution of landfill
gas, Palo Alto is expected to receive
28 percent of its energy from "green"
sources. The city hopes to reach 33
percent by 2015. But Burt says there
are better ways to reach this goal.
"I want to see us put a greater
portion of our effort into reducing
the purchase of polluting energy as
opposed to buying more green ener
gy," Burt said. "We will always use a
combination of increased renew
ables and increased efficiency. The
question is how best to strike that
balance."
