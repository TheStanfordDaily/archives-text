## Student Wellness Fair is first of its kind on campus 
### KABIR SAWHNEY DESK EDITOR 
The BeWell program's student outreach
campaign took its next steps on Wednesday
with the first Student Wellness Fair, held in
White Plaza.

The fair's activities and games served as the
event's main draw. A dunk tank was one of the
biggest attractions, featuring several members
of the football team and ASSU President An
gelina Cardona 'll.

Another prominent fixture was a sexual ed

ucation obstacle course set up behind the Sex
ual Health Peer Resource Center (SHPRC)
table. Two participants at a time wearing
"sperm hats" raced through a kite-shaped
"vagina" made out of PVC pipe before pop
ping a condom with oil-based lube and heading
over small hurdles labeled with the names of
different contraceptives.

They then had to go through garbage cans
labeled as Fallopian tubes before throwing
beanbags into a hole to "fertilize the egg" and
win the race.

Describing the process that led to the

course's creation, Steven Crane 'll, a SHPRC
volunteer, said, "We asked ourselves, 'How are
we going to get people to engage with some
thing?'"
"It sort of emulates what happens in na
ture," he added.
"It's a creative way to let people know the
facts with sexual health," Cardona said. "There
can be large differences between students in
knowledge about sexual health."

Other activities included sumo-suit

wrestling, a bean-bag toss and free
massages next to the Claw. Jamba
Juice set up a table to hand out free
smoothie samples and coupons, and
BeWell also gave away water bottles
and t-shirts. Students who participat
ed in two or more activities were eli
gible to enter a raffle drawing.
For fair organizers and wellness
proponents on campus, the fair was
also an opportunity to combine the
efforts of various wellness organiza
tions on campus.
"A lot of groups do things on their
own; we wanted to bring them to
gether, and support students doing
what they already do," said Jennifer
Sexton, one of the BeWell cam
paign's coordinators. "We're now at a
point where we want to include stu
dents."

Sexton said the fair acted as Be-
Well's launching point for its student
passport wellness program. Similar
to the incentive program already in
place for University employees, the

passport is designed to reward those
who are already active and incen
tivize other students to become more
involved in wellness.

The passport program will be fully
implemented at the start of fall quar
ter, she said.
Donnovan Yisrael 'B9, a health ed
ucator for Health Promotion Ser
vices (HPS), said the group is looking
to promote the idea that "you can
have fun when talking about health."
"We're emphasizing balance
you can have fun and still take care of
yourself," Yisrael said. "We need to
take away the idea that health is all
hard work. If you make health fun,
people will do it."
HPS and BeWell primarily fund
ed the event, with additional support
coming from the Wellness Room,
SHPRC and Stanford Dining.

Cardona also discussed the Well
ness Room's role in the fair from her
perspective as one of the room's
founders.
"The Wellness Room is a hub and
a central point of communication on
campus," she said. "The fact that [the
room] helped sponsor the event is in
line with what I envisioned the
room's role to be."

A number of other groups with
ties to wellness such as SHPRC,
Stanford Dining, Stanford Peace of
Mind and the physical recreation de
partment had set up tables at the
fair.

While Wednesday's fair was the
first of its kind, HPS hopes to contin
ue holding similar fairs in the future.

"We want to make it an annual
thing," said Jarreau Bowen, the coor
dinator of the Peer Health Education

(PHE) program. "The PHEs have
been talking for years about a health

and wellness fair... I used to see
small groups in White Plaza. We
thought, why don't we combine ef
forts and do a big thing instead of
small events?"

Bowen said that the goals of the
fair mirror the general goals of Be-
Well: to "get active, eat well and un
wind."

"We want to celebrate ways in
which we are living well," Bowen said.
