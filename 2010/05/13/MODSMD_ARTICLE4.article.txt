## Student Wellness Fair is first of its kind on campus 
### KABIR SAWHNEY DESK EDITOR 
The BeWell program's student outreach
campaign took its next steps on Wednesday
with the first Student Wellness Fair, held in
White Plaza.

The fair's activities and games served as the
event's main draw. A dunk tank was one of the
biggest attractions, featuring several members
of the football team and ASSU President An
gelina Cardona 'll.

Another prominent fixture was a sexual ed

ucation obstacle course set up behind the Sex
ual Health Peer Resource Center (SHPRC)
table. Two participants at a time wearing
"sperm hats" raced through a kite-shaped
"vagina" made out of PVC pipe before pop
ping a condom with oil-based lube and heading
over small hurdles labeled with the names of
different contraceptives.

They then had to go through garbage cans
labeled as Fallopian tubes before throwing
beanbags into a hole to "fertilize the egg" and
win the race.

Describing the process that led to the

course's creation, Steven Crane 'll, a SHPRC
volunteer, said, "We asked ourselves, 'How are
we going to get people to engage with some
thing?'"
"It sort of emulates what happens in na
ture," he added.
"It's a creative way to let people know the
facts with sexual health," Cardona said. "There
can be large differences between students in
knowledge about sexual health."

Other activities included sumo-suit

fertilize the egg. The race was one of many activities and games at the school's first Student Wellness Fair on Wednesday afternoon.
