## Berkeley's Haas shifts curriculum 
### CASSANDRA FELICIANO STAFF WRITER 
UC-Berkeley's Haas School of
Business launched its newly re
designed MBA curriculum last
week. The overhaul, the first since
2006, has drawn from a number of
influences, including peer institu
tions such as Stanford.
According to Dean Richard
Lyons, Haas administrators looked
at Harvard's publicized overview of
similar redevelopments in business
school curricula in other institutions
over the last five years.
While examining Stanford's
MBA program, Lyons was particu
larly excited by its international ex
perience requirement, which includ
ed study-abroad, service learning
trips with non-profits and immer
sion experiences. Haas' restructur
ing worked to incorporate a similar
component in its new curriculum.
"Being good in the global ele
ment has sort of become what, in the
jargon, people call a high-speed fac
tor," he said. "It's something you've
got to do if you want to play."
Incorporating this international
component is part of Haas' vision to
produce "path-bending, innovative
leaders," through refocusing its core
curriculum on critical and analytical
thinking and building it from the
business school's culture, norms and
values. Its fruition is based on the
collaborative efforts of faculty, stu
dents and alumni of the school.
While the full impact of this tran
sition remains to be seen, as the cur
riculum has yet to be completely
rolled out, the redirection of Haas'
cultural aspirations was already
manifested in the admission process
before the May 3 curriculum an
nouncement.

"The hope, of course, is that it im
proves the match," Lyons said.
"People for whom Berkeley Haas is
not the right fit will learn much
early on. We wanted to make sure
that we got that fit correctly, that
people that should be selecting to
ward us were [doing so] and if oth
ers should select toward some other
school, that they do that as well."
He added that this change could
be responsible for the 10 percent in
crease in the number of students
who accepted their offer of admis
sion.

Although top-tier business
schools such as Haas and Stanford's
Graduate School of Business
(GSB) are often in competition by
nature of their high ranking, busi
ness schools have a history of draw
ing from each others' curriculum
changes. Haas' decision to review

the changes made at their fellow
universities is not at all uncommon,
said officials at Stanford's GSB.

"Universities are primarily inter
ested in creating the most effective
learning experience possible, and
often share ideas to build upon and
improve curricula," wrote GSB
Dean Garth Saloner MA 'Bl MS 'B2
Ph.D. 'B2 in an e-mail to The Daily.

Stanford's GSB launched its
most recent curriculum update in
2007, and while its development
process did consider some of the
same elements in place at other in
stitutions, curriculum developers at
Stanford ultimately decided to go a
different route.

"We always keep an eye on
what's happening at other schools,"
said Sunil Kumar, a professor and
the senior associate dean for aca
demic affairs at the GSB. "[But] in
the end, the task force, while it was
cognizant of what happened at
other schools, more or less went
their own way. [Curricula] come out
different because they are trying to
achieve different goals and are
being done by organizations with
different capabilities."
Implementing the larger host of
moving parts in the current curricu
lum continues to be a struggle for
the GSB. For example, according to

Mike Hochleutner, executive direc
tor of the GSB's Center for Leader
ship Development and Research,
because many students felt that the
first MBA year had a disproportion
ate amount of requirements com
pared to the second year, the total
graduation requirements were in
creased and students were afforded
more choice in their coursework.
This factor, along with smaller class
sizes, meant that more instructors
were needed.

But these challenges were will
ingly accepted by GSB officials.

"The demands on the schools' in
frastructure [have] increased,"
Kumar said. "[But] we believe we
can actually pull this off. We believe
that this is a cost worth bearing be
cause it provides a much better edu
cational experience for our stu
dents."

Although there are aspects of
the new curriculum that still need to
be settled, students and faculty are,
by and large, satisfied with the
change.
"While I wouldn't go so far as to
say that we've achieved what we in
tended to, we are definitely in the
direction going there," Kumar said.
