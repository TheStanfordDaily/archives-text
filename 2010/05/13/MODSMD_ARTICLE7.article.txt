### STEPHANIE SARA CHONG STAFF WRITER 
High school senior Eugenia
O'Kelly routinely wears her pa
jamas to class. Not because no
one cares, but because no one
can tell.

"As long as you're wearing a shirt that
looks like it could be a regular t-shirt, then
they can't really tell," O'Kelly said of partici
pating in an online classroom. "Or, you could
wear a coat over your pajamas, if they really do
look like pajamas."

O'Kelly is one of 220 students currently en
rolled in Stanford's Education Program for
Gifted Youth Online High School (EPGY
OHS). Using real-time video-conferencing,
the high school brings together gifted seventh
through 12th grade students from around the
world into a single, virtual classroom.
EPGY first started as a research project in
the 1980s, when it received a grant to develop
computer-aided instruction in calculus. By the
late 19905, EPGY had developed a full cur

riculum in computer science, physics and ex
pository writing. Among EPGY's most well
known programs are its residential summer
program and the OHS.

The OHS has expanded at great speeds
since its founding in 2006.T0 date, it offers full
time and part-time courses in a wide scope of
subjects from "fuzzy" to "techie" and at
a range of levels from high school to uni
versity.

The online component of the OHS de
pends on a software program known as Saba
Centre. As described on the OHS website, the
software "provides space for instructional
slides, a whiteboard that both instructor and
students use, application sharing capabilities
for group use of subject-appropriate software,
as well as text chat."

Saba Centre also allows students to raise
their hands, say yes or no, laugh and applaud.
To determine whether applicants are "gift
ed" enough to belong to this selective online
high school, the OHS looks at test scores and
academic records. Admissions officers also
consider students' personal attributes, such as
determination to succeed.

"We don't place too extensive an emphasis
on particular definitions or models of gifted
ness in admissions," wrote Jeffrey Scarbor
ough '99, assistant headmaster of the OHS, in
an email to The Daily. "Rather, we attend to
demonstrated abilities and potential, as well as
factors such as motivation and intellectual cu
riosity. These characteristics can be particular
ly important at the OHS, with respect to both
the online environment and to the intensity of
the program."

EPGY can be seen as something of an out
reach program for precocious students. In
using the resources of Stanford University, the
OHS provides young students a chance to
take academically challenging classes that
local high schools do not otherwise offer.
"When they take a course from us, they can
do it in away that suits their talents," explained
Rick Sommer, managing director of EPGY.
"A lot of the kids in our program are ones who
learn quickly, who in a traditional math class
might be bored. In our program, they go at a
pace that suits their abilities."
While it is not uncommon for gifted youth
to decide to enroll in college at the adolescent

age of 13 or 14, OHS provides pre-teens and
teenagers with the academic resources to live
at home until a college-appropriate age.
"What we try to do and largely succeed
at is making it so that it's not necessary for
our students to go to college before the age of
17," said Jovana Knezevic, EPGY's writing,

"It's really hard to balance a
normal social life with an online
social life."
MAYA LEWIS 'l3,
former student in EPGY's online high school

development and marketing commu
nications associate. "In our curricu
lum, they have university-level courses
in a variety of subjects, so it's unlikely
that they're going to exhaust their ed
ucational resources before it is time
for them age-wise to go to college."
The OHS's system worked for
O'Kelly, who chose to enroll in the
program after exhausting her high
school's most advanced English class
es. Looking for a challenge, she imme
diately jumped into the OHS's AP
English course. O'Kelly looks back
on the experience as both frightening
and rewarding.
"For the first three months, I
thought I was either going to die or
drop out," O'Kelly recalled. "It was
very intense. There were a lot of
nights when I was crying myself to
sleep. I thought I was going to be a
complete failure. [But] after a couple
of months, you just kind of get into
the swing of things, and suddenly
things start making sense."
"The thought of 15-page papers
isn't daunting anymore," she added.
Similar to O'Kelly, Maya Lewis's
'l3 transition to the OHS's online for
mat was a difficult one. It took her
about a year before she felt complete
ly acclimated. A native of Texas,
Lewis had only ever attended local
schools. She learned about the OHS
from her dad, who, according to
Lewis, "read about it in a local news
paper while waiting for my grandma
in a beauty salon."
Lewis eventually thrived in the
program, procuring the positions of
student body president and editor of
the newspaper all of which took
place over the Internet.
Still the lack of in-person interac
tion was the main disadvantage of the
program, Lewis said. She made
friends almost exclusively via Inter

net chat during her first two years. In
her senior year, she decided to regain
a "normal social life" and reach out to
her extracurricular music groups.
"It's really hard to balance a nor
mal social life with an online social
life," Lewis said, matter-of-factly. "I
don't think I know anybody who was
able to successfully be active both on
line and locally people either
chose one or the other."
O 'Kelly took advantage of the
OHS's intrinsic flexibility in the on
line format. Although the school
boasts a number of rigid require
ments — including a core sequence
based on Stanford's Introduction to
the Humanities (IHUM) program
O'Kelly was able to design her own
curriculum. When she submitted a 70-
page proposal to develop an educa
tional software program, the OHS
provided her with class credit and fac
ulty advisors.
Of course, not all OHS students
follow the path of O'Kelly, who won a
national competition for her project
and now has a patent pending. But
the opportunities are undoubtedly
there.
"All that the school offers you isn't
going to be handed to you," O'Kelly
admitted. "I think you can get a lot
out of the school, but you actually
have to go look for it."
O'Kelly will graduate from the
OHS in June the school holds a
formal ceremony on Stanford's cam
pus and matriculate into Stanford
in the fall. She will join the five stu
dents from the OHS's first graduating
class who currently attend Stanford.
As one of those five students,
Lewis has no regrets about attending
OHS. It certainly helped prepare her
for Stanford's academic rigor. But she
is nonetheless happy to be back in a
social atmosphere, where she has ac
cess to friends and fun.

"It's nice being around people
again."

academic records. Admissions officers also
consider students' personal attributes, such as
determination to succeed.

"We don't place too extensive an emphasis
on particular definitions or models of gifted
ness in admissions," wrote Jeffrey Scarbor
ough '99, assistant headmaster of the OHS, in
an email to The Daily. "Rather, we attend to
demonstrated abilities and potential, as well as
factors such as motivation and intellectual cu
riosity. These characteristics can be particular
ly important at the OHS, with respect to both
the online environment and to the intensity of
the program."

EPGY can be seen as something of an out
reach program for precocious students. In
using the resources of Stanford University, the
OHS provides young students a chance to
take academically challenging classes that
local high schools do not otherwise offer.
"When they take a course from us, they can
do it in away that suits their talents," explained
Rick Sommer, managing director of EPGY.
"A lot of the kids in our program are ones who
learn quickly, who in a traditional math class
might be bored. In our program, they go at a
pace that suits their abilities."
While it is not uncommon for gifted youth
to decide to enroll in college at the adolescent

age of 13 or 14, OHS provides pre-teens and
teenagers with the academic resources to live
at home until a college-appropriate age.
"What we try to do and largely succeed
at is making it so that it's not necessary for
our students to go to college before the age of
17," said Jovana Knezevic, EPGY's writing,

"It's really hard to balance a
normal social life with an online
social life."
MAYA LEWIS 'l3,
former student in EPGY's online high school

development and marketing commu
nications associate. "In our curricu
lum, they have university-level courses
in a variety of subjects, so it's unlikely
that they're going to exhaust their ed
ucational resources before it is time
for them age-wise to go to college."
The OHS's system worked for
O'Kelly, who chose to enroll in the
program after exhausting her high
school's most advanced English class
es. Looking for a challenge, she imme
diately jumped into the OHS's AP
English course. O'Kelly looks back
on the experience as both frightening
and rewarding.
"For the first three months, I
thought I was either going to die or
drop out," O'Kelly recalled. "It was
very intense. There were a lot of
nights when I was crying myself to
sleep. I thought I was going to be a
complete failure. [But] after a couple
of months, you just kind of get into
the swing of things, and suddenly
things start making sense."
"The thought of 15-page papers
isn't daunting anymore," she added.
Similar to O'Kelly, Maya Lewis's
'l3 transition to the OHS's online for
mat was a difficult one. It took her
about a year before she felt complete
ly acclimated. A native of Texas,
Lewis had only ever attended local
schools. She learned about the OHS
from her dad, who, according to
Lewis, "read about it in a local news
paper while waiting for my grandma
in a beauty salon."
Lewis eventually thrived in the
program, procuring the positions of
student body president and editor of
the newspaper all of which took
place over the Internet.
Still the lack of in-person interac
tion was the main disadvantage of the
program, Lewis said. She made
friends almost exclusively via Inter

net chat during her first two years. In
her senior year, she decided to regain
a "normal social life" and reach out to
her extracurricular music groups.
"It's really hard to balance a nor
mal social life with an online social
life," Lewis said, matter-of-factly. "I
don't think I know anybody who was
able to successfully be active both on
line and locally people either
chose one or the other."
O 'Kelly took advantage of the
OHS's intrinsic flexibility in the on
line format. Although the school
boasts a number of rigid require
ments — including a core sequence
based on Stanford's Introduction to
the Humanities (IHUM) program
O'Kelly was able to design her own
curriculum. When she submitted a 70-
page proposal to develop an educa
tional software program, the OHS
provided her with class credit and fac
ulty advisors.
Of course, not all OHS students
follow the path of O'Kelly, who won a
national competition for her project
and now has a patent pending. But
the opportunities are undoubtedly
there.
"All that the school offers you isn't
going to be handed to you," O'Kelly
admitted. "I think you can get a lot
out of the school, but you actually
have to go look for it."
O'Kelly will graduate from the
OHS in June the school holds a
formal ceremony on Stanford's cam
pus and matriculate into Stanford
in the fall. She will join the five stu
dents from the OHS's first graduating
class who currently attend Stanford.
As one of those five students,
Lewis has no regrets about attending
OHS. It certainly helped prepare her
for Stanford's academic rigor. But she
is nonetheless happy to be back in a
social atmosphere, where she has ac
cess to friends and fun.

"It's nice being around people
again."

High school senior Eugenia
O'Kelly routinely wears her pa
jamas to class. Not because no
one cares, but because no one
can tell.

"As long as you're wearing a shirt that
looks like it could be a regular t-shirt, then
they can't really tell," O'Kelly said of partici
pating in an online classroom. "Or, you could
wear a coat over your pajamas, if they really do
look like pajamas."

O'Kelly is one of 220 students currently en
rolled in Stanford's Education Program for
Gifted Youth Online High School (EPGY
OHS). Using real-time video-conferencing,
the high school brings together gifted seventh
through 12th grade students from around the
world into a single, virtual classroom.
EPGY first started as a research project in
the 1980s, when it received a grant to develop
computer-aided instruction in calculus. By the
late 19905, EPGY had developed a full cur

riculum in computer science, physics and ex
pository writing. Among EPGY's most well
known programs are its residential summer
program and the OHS.

The OHS has expanded at great speeds
since its founding in 2006.T0 date, it offers full
time and part-time courses in a wide scope of
subjects from "fuzzy" to "techie" and at
a range of levels from high school to uni
versity.

The online component of the OHS de
pends on a software program known as Saba
Centre. As described on the OHS website, the
software "provides space for instructional
slides, a whiteboard that both instructor and
students use, application sharing capabilities
for group use of subject-appropriate software,
as well as text chat."

Saba Centre also allows students to raise
their hands, say yes or no, laugh and applaud.
To determine whether applicants are "gift
ed" enough to belong to this selective online
high school, the OHS looks at test scores and
academic records. Admissions officers also
consider students' personal attributes, such as
determination to succeed.

"We don't place too extensive an emphasis
