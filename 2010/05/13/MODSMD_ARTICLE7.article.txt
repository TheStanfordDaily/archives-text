High school senior Eugenia
O'Kelly routinely wears her pa
jamas to class. Not because no
one cares, but because no one
can tell.

"As long as you're wearing a shirt that
looks like it could be a regular t-shirt, then
they can't really tell," O'Kelly said of partici
pating in an online classroom. "Or, you could
wear a coat over your pajamas, if they really do
look like pajamas."

O'Kelly is one of 220 students currently en
rolled in Stanford's Education Program for
Gifted Youth Online High School (EPGY
OHS). Using real-time video-conferencing,
the high school brings together gifted seventh
through 12th grade students from around the
world into a single, virtual classroom.
EPGY first started as a research project in
the 1980s, when it received a grant to develop
computer-aided instruction in calculus. By the
late 19905, EPGY had developed a full cur

riculum in computer science, physics and ex
pository writing. Among EPGY's most well
known programs are its residential summer
program and the OHS.

The OHS has expanded at great speeds
since its founding in 2006.T0 date, it offers full
time and part-time courses in a wide scope of
subjects from "fuzzy" to "techie" and at
a range of levels from high school to uni
versity.

The online component of the OHS de
pends on a software program known as Saba
Centre. As described on the OHS website, the
software "provides space for instructional
slides, a whiteboard that both instructor and
students use, application sharing capabilities
for group use of subject-appropriate software,
as well as text chat."

Saba Centre also allows students to raise
their hands, say yes or no, laugh and applaud.
To determine whether applicants are "gift
ed" enough to belong to this selective online
high school, the OHS looks at test scores and
academic records. Admissions officers also
consider students' personal attributes, such as
determination to succeed.

"We don't place too extensive an emphasis
on particular definitions or models of gifted
ness in admissions," wrote Jeffrey Scarbor
ough '99, assistant headmaster of the OHS, in
an email to The Daily. "Rather, we attend to
demonstrated abilities and potential, as well as
factors such as motivation and intellectual cu
riosity. These characteristics can be particular
ly important at the OHS, with respect to both
the online environment and to the intensity of
the program."

EPGY can be seen as something of an out
reach program for precocious students. In
using the resources of Stanford University, the
OHS provides young students a chance to
take academically challenging classes that
local high schools do not otherwise offer.
"When they take a course from us, they can
do it in away that suits their talents," explained
Rick Sommer, managing director of EPGY.
"A lot of the kids in our program are ones who
learn quickly, who in a traditional math class
might be bored. In our program, they go at a
pace that suits their abilities."
While it is not uncommon for gifted youth
to decide to enroll in college at the adolescent

age of 13 or 14, OHS provides pre-teens and
teenagers with the academic resources to live
at home until a college-appropriate age.
"What we try to do and largely succeed
at is making it so that it's not necessary for
our students to go to college before the age of
17," said Jovana Knezevic, EPGY's writing,

"It's really hard to balance a
normal social life with an online
social life."
