\l \j longingly to the end of the
▼ school year. But many juniors
and seniors have more than just their immedi
ate classes and summer plans to consider
they are frantically working to start or wrap up
their capstone research projects.
It's honors thesis season.
Although the honors programs vary across
departments, all share the common aspect of
being one of the most intellectually rigorous
experiences that a Stanford undergraduate
can undertake.
The path of honors is not for the indecisive.
Significant preparation and time must be in
vested prior to starting the honors process. For
most departments, particularly the natural sci
ences, students must not only clear the neces
sary GPA and coursework requirements be
fore declaring honors, but have already started
on research early.
"Students need to have a 3.0 GPA in the
major so that they qualify numerically," said
Jennifer Mason, the undergraduate student
services officer for the biology department.
"However, they also usually join labs [at the]
end of sophomore year or early junior year to
work on research projects."
While most departments are fairly rigid in

which courses honors students must take, in
terdepartmental honors programs are much
more flexible. One such program is the honors
track at the Center for International Security
and Cooperation (CISAC), which is unique in
that it is both interdisciplinary and interde
partmental, so majors ranging from manage
ment science and engineering to human biolo
gy to public policy are encouraged to apply.
"We look for diversity in our honors pro
gram at CISAC," said Stephen Stedman, a po
litical science professor and a senior fellow at
CISAC, "We love majors from engineering, bi
ology, physics, econ. First of all, what the com
mittee looks for is a real commitment to inter
nal security, which we gauge by seeing whether
or not the student has taken certain prerequi
sites in that particular area."
Planning and pacing is a critical component
even in the early stages of the honors process;
for many departments, applications are due
late winter quarter or early spring quarter.

"You'll need an advisor, recommendation
letters, a synthesis of what topic you're inter
ested in researching, a resume, all of these ma
terials," said Shannon Tori Anderson 'll, who
is majoring in political science. Anderson is
part of CISAC's honors program and her pro
posed honors thesis topic will be an evaluation
of America's airline security policies post-9/11.

Stedman and Mason both said that the
number of applications for most honors pro
grams has remained fairly constant within the
last five years. However, this doesn't necessar

ily indicate that there is no competition in the
application process. Some honors programs,
such as CISAC and international relations, are
competitive in that they have a set quota on
how many honors students they will accept
each year.
"We typically take about 12 students," said
Kathryn Stoner-Weiss, deputy director of the
Center on Democracy, Development and the
Rule of Law (CDDRL), which is a relatively
new concentration track within the IR major.
"Although our program is only about four
years old, the number of spots for honors is
usually full."
Other honors programs, like that of the bi
ology department, do not cap the number of
students accepted into the honors program.
The competition instead lies elsewhere, specif
ically the selection of faculty members that one
chooses to work with.
"It takes longer than they want to, to find a
lab," Mason said. "Some students are surprised
by how long it can take, and how many e-mails
they'll have to send. A student who wants to do
research pretty much can, but the amount of
time and effort needed to set it up can be frus
trating."
In other situations, finding and establishing
communication with a faculty advisor can be
fortuitously effortless.
"I got to know my advisor personally dur
ing my work at Sierra Camp," said Garner
Kropp TO. "So I was lucky in that I got to know
him mostly in a non-academic setting."

Writing a thesis
is intensive and ex
tensive and de
mands over a
year-long com
mitment. The tan
gible aspect of 15
months worth of
effort is a thesis
that can range from
15 pages (for natural sci
ence programs) to over 100
pages (for some ambitious humani
ties and social sciences students). To pre
pare for that process many departments offer
an honors seminar class which juniors pursuing
honors can take in winter or spring quarter.
"The juniors honors seminar really helps you
get oriented with the thesis process," said Kropp,
who is majoring in economics. His honors thesis
will investigate gender trends in a school pro
gram implemented in the 90s that helped allevi
ate poverty in Bangladesh. "The goal of that
class is to have a prospectus, so by the end of win
ter quarter of my junior year, I had an intro, a lit
erature review, a tentative methodology and a
pretty good bibliography of sources. That class
really set me on the right course."
Honors students also agree that passion in
one's research topic is critical to making the
most of the honors experience.

"You have to be in love with your topic,"
said Miriam Marks 'll, who is majoring in pub
lic policy. Her honors thesis topic will be an

analy
sis of the labor market for suicide bombers in
Palestine. "Spending a whole year on it can be
kind of scary."
Yet despite the challenge, students like
Kropp are feeling the pay-offs.
"Writing my thesis has been one of the
most useful things I've done here at Stanford,"
Kropp said. "Reading other people's research
is helpful but knowing how to write a literature
review and learning how to read a lot of mate
rial and condensing it is really helpful... these
skills will be helpful in the long run, whereas
you don't learn as much from doing problem
sets.
"It's definitely worth it," he added.
