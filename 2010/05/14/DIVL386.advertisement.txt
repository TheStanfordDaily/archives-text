Snapshot Scholar
Win a $7OOO scholarship!
We are hosting a photography contest between Stanford and Berkeley students.
Submit your favorite photos. Rally votes from fellow students, friends and
family to stay ahead of Berkeley rivals. Collaborate with high profile alumni.
The winning photo will be decided by a panel of judges.
Contest starts late May 2010.
Sign up to the mailing list today at www.snapshotscholar.com - don't miss out!
We'll let you know once the site goes live.
