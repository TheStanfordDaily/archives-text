# Key nuclear official to speak at the Farm

### DAILY NEWS STAFF Elizabeth Titus 
Gregory B. Jaczko, the chair of the U.S. Nuclear
Regulatory Commission, is set to speak at Stanford on
May 18 about the environmental and public safety
risks associated with the country's 104 nuclear power
plants.
Jaczko is the head of the U.S. agency responsible for
regulating nuclear material safety, issuing orders to
those licensed to operate nuclear plants and oversee
ing the agency's response to emergencies at licensed
plants. His talk next week is part of Stanford's spring
energy seminar series.
The United States has seen little new construction
of nuclear reactors since the 1970s until recently; now,
18 applications are before the commission for pro
posed projects in the midwest, south and northeast.
President Obama, in his State of the Union address,
called for more nuclear power plants and put $57.5 bil
lion into his budget plan for construction loans.
Jaczko, who holds a Ph.D. in physics, will discuss the
challenges of simultaneously overseeing current reac
tors, approving designs and license applications, regulat
ing safety, expanding the nuclear energy industry and
storing spent fuel, according to organizers.
The Woods Institute, the Precourt Institute for En
ergy and the Global Climate and Energy Project are
co-sponsoring the talk. It is scheduled for May 18 at
4:15 p.m. in Bldg. 420.
