## An alternative lifestyle 
### ZOELEAVITT SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
There's never enough sil
verware.lt's dinnertime at
Columbae, and the stu
dents have come together
to sling tofu, ladle rice and
drizzle fondue onto plates, Tupper
ware lids and a rapidly degenerating
succession of flat, food-holding items.
But it's not the cutlery that matters at
Columbae it's the community.
"Because Columbae is so cramped
and we do so much together, we all get
really close," said Rebecca Hsu 'lO.
"In dorms you don't need to interact
if you don't want to, but living in
Columbae compels you to do so."
Even with the intensive communi
ty life of a co-op, some students
choose to carve out an even more in
timately shared space within Univer
sity controlled housing. This quarter,
18 Columbae residents have banded
together to create two "commune
rooms," pooling their spatial re
sources to create a set-up that most
students would never consider. In
each commune group, people living
in three rooms throughout the house
have decided to designate one of
their rooms as a study room, one as a
socializing room and one as a sleep
ing room with eight people in one
sleeping room and 10 in another.
"Living with people is one of the
best ways to get to know them," said
Hsu, who in her first year in a co-op,
has lived in one Columbae commune
fall quarter and another this quarter.
"It was a really creative quarter. I was
taking fiction writing, and three other
people were also taking it; so we
could bounce stories off one another.
Everyone was into music, so we'd oc
casionally have jam sessions in our
room."
Of course, having so many people
inhabit one room comes at a cost.
"We pretty much lived in perpetu
al mess," Hsu laughed.
Plus, with nine roommates, extra
communal relations can get a little
more complicated the simple act
of sexiling could take on the form of a
hallway stampede. To protect that
basic human right, in a house where
most doors are perpetually propped
open, one room denoted by a
paper sign on the door, the "Library"
remains locked.
"It's a room unofficially designat
ed for, well, sex," Hsu said.
As unconventional as these living
arrangements may seem to the
greater campus, some people are tak
ing things a step further. Students
from Columbae, Synergy and Chi

Theta Chi are forming an off-campus
community that will provide students
the chance to eat local, organic food,
perform all household tasks on their
own and, they say, grow together as a
family.
"Dorms for me are just sterile
it's like they want every place to be
the same," said Julia Sebastian 'll.
"Stanford is a place where they hold
your hand, and there are a lot of kids
who have no idea how to live on their
own [as they do at] almost all other
colleges across the country. It's cool
to live a different lifestyle that's not
so babied."
Sebastion, along with 17 Stanford
undergraduate and graduate stu
dents, will rent out two of Palo Alto's
Dead Houses a collection of 10
houses commissioned by local Dead
head Rob Levitsky in 1982. Each
Dead House is named for a different
Grateful Dead song, and rent is
priced below market costs to help out
students. The Stanford group will
most likely take over "Uncle John's
Band" and "St. Steven's."
By living on their own outside of
University authority, the commune
members hope to take greater con
trol of their space in a more intimate
setting than what they have found on
campus.
"The co-ops on campus are a crash
course in communal living," said Se
bastian, who currently lives in Syner
gy. "The co-ops on campus are beau
tiful places and great for learning and
all that, but they're also like 50 peo
ple. That's the reason I think this is
the next step: [our commune will be]
much more intimate."
The commune's plan is strong, and
its membership has grown from 10 to
18. Several other communes current
ly lurk beyond Stanford's manicured
lawns and shapely palm trees, includ
ing Magic, a vegan community found
ed in 1972 by Stanford and Yale grad
uates. Sebastian's community, cur
rently going by the name Community
Now, will differ in that it will be large
ly populated by undergraduates.
"I didn't really have a strong sense
that I wanted to become part of a con
sensual community next year," said
Reed Matheny 'lO, a Chi Theta Chi
resident. "But their project just
seemed so sensible, so right and so
fun that I had to get involved."
The group has made a strong ef
fort to bond already this year, so by
the time they all move in together and
depend on each other for edible food
and clean bathrooms, the links of
trust and accountability will be firm.
"You can't split everything evenly
between all people at all times," said
Matheny, commenting on the divi

sion of labor that he has observed at
Chi Theta Chi. "It can seem unjust..
. This will be much less of a problem
next year since we all know each
other and we've all come into this
very devoted to living together."
By dedicating intensive time and
energy to the planning of the com
mune, the 18 members believe that
they are creating something that will
last long after they leave the area.
They hope to avoid falling into a gov
erning hierarchy and plan to shape
their space according to their needs.
And they're not above dumpster-div
ing to support their organic habits.
This lifestyle, radically different
from a daily schedule of shuffling
from a Stern one-room double to the
dining hall, is one many Stanford stu
dents have never experienced. And
it's certainly not for everyone.
"You need mental preparation to
live in a commune," Matheny ad
vised. "If you go into it not realizing
what's required, or not knowing the
people in the house .. .you might
learn something, but you'll be unhap
py"

verware.lt's dinnertime at
Columbae, and the stu
dents have come together
to sling tofu, ladle rice and
drizzle fondue onto plates, Tupper
ware lids and a rapidly degenerating
succession of flat, food-holding items.
But it's not the cutlery that matters at
Columbae it's the community.
"Because Columbae is so cramped
and we do so much together, we all get
really close," said Rebecca Hsu 'lO.
"In dorms you don't need to interact
if you don't want to, but living in
Columbae compels you to do so."
Even with the intensive communi
ty life of a co-op, some students
choose to carve out an even more in
timately shared space within Univer
sity controlled housing. This quarter,
18 Columbae residents have banded
together to create two "commune
rooms," pooling their spatial re
sources to create a set-up that most
students would never consider. In
each commune group, people living
in three rooms throughout the house
have decided to designate one of
their rooms as a study room, one as a
socializing room and one as a sleep
ing room with eight people in one
sleeping room and 10 in another.
"Living with people is one of the
best ways to get to know them," said
Hsu, who in her first year in a co-op,
has lived in one Columbae commune
fall quarter and another this quarter.
"It was a really creative quarter. I was
taking fiction writing, and three other
people were also taking it; so we
could bounce stories off one another.
Everyone was into music, so we'd oc
casionally have jam sessions in our
room."
Of course, having so many people
inhabit one room comes at a cost.
"We pretty much lived in perpetu
al mess," Hsu laughed.
Plus, with nine roommates, extra
communal relations can get a little
more complicated the simple act
of sexiling could take on the form of a
hallway stampede. To protect that
basic human right, in a house where
most doors are perpetually propped
open, one room denoted by a
paper sign on the door, the "Library"
remains locked.
"It's a room unofficially designat
ed for, well, sex," Hsu said.
As unconventional as these living
arrangements may seem to the
greater campus, some people are tak
ing things a step further. Students
from Columbae, Synergy and Chi

Theta Chi are forming an off-campus
community that will provide students
the chance to eat local, organic food,
perform all household tasks on their
own and, they say, grow together as a
family.
"Dorms for me are just sterile
it's like they want every place to be
the same," said Julia Sebastian 'll.
"Stanford is a place where they hold
your hand, and there are a lot of kids
who have no idea how to live on their
own [as they do at] almost all other
colleges across the country. It's cool
to live a different lifestyle that's not
so babied."
Sebastion, along with 17 Stanford
undergraduate and graduate stu
dents, will rent out two of Palo Alto's
Dead Houses a collection of 10
houses commissioned by local Dead
head Rob Levitsky in 1982. Each
Dead House is named for a different
Grateful Dead song, and rent is
priced below market costs to help out
students. The Stanford group will
most likely take over "Uncle John's
Band" and "St. Steven's."
By living on their own outside of
University authority, the commune
members hope to take greater con
trol of their space in a more intimate
setting than what they have found on
campus.
"The co-ops on campus are a crash
course in communal living," said Se
bastian, who currently lives in Syner
gy. "The co-ops on campus are beau
tiful places and great for learning and
all that, but they're also like 50 peo
ple. That's the reason I think this is
the next step: [our commune will be]
much more intimate."
The commune's plan is strong, and
its membership has grown from 10 to
18. Several other communes current
ly lurk beyond Stanford's manicured
lawns and shapely palm trees, includ
ing Magic, a vegan community found
ed in 1972 by Stanford and Yale grad
uates. Sebastian's community, cur
rently going by the name Community
Now, will differ in that it will be large
ly populated by undergraduates.
"I didn't really have a strong sense
that I wanted to become part of a con
sensual community next year," said
Reed Matheny 'lO, a Chi Theta Chi
resident. "But their project just
seemed so sensible, so right and so
fun that I had to get involved."
The group has made a strong ef
fort to bond already this year, so by
the time they all move in together and
depend on each other for edible food
and clean bathrooms, the links of
trust and accountability will be firm.
"You can't split everything evenly
between all people at all times," said
Matheny, commenting on the divi

sion of labor that he has observed at
Chi Theta Chi. "It can seem unjust..
. This will be much less of a problem
next year since we all know each
other and we've all come into this
very devoted to living together."
By dedicating intensive time and
energy to the planning of the com
mune, the 18 members believe that
they are creating something that will
last long after they leave the area.
They hope to avoid falling into a gov
erning hierarchy and plan to shape
their space according to their needs.
And they're not above dumpster-div
ing to support their organic habits.
This lifestyle, radically different
from a daily schedule of shuffling
from a Stern one-room double to the
dining hall, is one many Stanford stu
dents have never experienced. And
it's certainly not for everyone.
"You need mental preparation to
live in a commune," Matheny ad
vised. "If you go into it not realizing
what's required, or not knowing the
people in the house .. .you might
learn something, but you'll be unhap
py"
