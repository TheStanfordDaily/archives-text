## SENSE AND NONSENSE Taming the Demon Within 
### Aysha Bagchi 
Our political world is filled with issues
that provoke visceral reactions. Bring
up gay marriage, immigration reform,
gun control, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict,
welfare assistance, war, foreign aid, abortion
and any number of other issues and you will
trigger some of the most emotionally
charged reactions.
In observing such responses, both in my
self and in others, I am often reminded of
when King Lear muses on human nature
after his daughter Regan has betrayed him.
He asks himself: "Is there any cause in nature
that makes these hard hearts?" He imagines
"anatomizing" Regan to find out "what
breeds about her heart."
This is the father whose own cruelty led to
his downfall. Earlier, Lear's blind pride
caused him to exile the one daughter who
truly loved him. Now he is musing on the ex
istence of hard hearts! The irony of the scene
encourages us to engage in the same self-re
flection Lear is ultimately led to in the play:
Were we to "anatomize" ourselves, what
would we find breeding about our own
hearts?
Each of us has a demon within that yearns
for intolerance, pleads for absolutism, begs us
to translate our moral positions into a hatred
for those who disagree. It is a mistake to think
this demon exists only in the illiberal individ
ual, the one who seeks to restrict the freedom
to live differently.The demon exists in the lib
eral too, the individual who shows such vehe
ment intolerance for the intolerant. We can
see this in how self-indulgent it feels to ex
press our deep hatred for abhorrent opin
ions. We more often do it for self-affirmation,
not to change another's views.
But perhaps this liberal hostility is justi
fied. After all, if intolerance is unacceptable,
why not publicly treat it with the abhorrence
it deserves?
There is a case to be made for showing in
tolerance for what we regard to be deeply
prejudiced ideas. A battering ram of protest
has, previously, forced the hand of history
and ushered in progressive reforms, like with
the civil rights movement. Such instances
make the case for a vibrant level of activism.
But we should also keep in mind that at
tempts to put prejudicial views through elec
tric shock therapy do not always have the
best effects and can even further alienate
those whose views we wish to change.
In such cases, particularly in person-to
person interactions, it is the person who lis
tens to the narrative of another and shows a
genuine sympathy for where she is coming
from who has a chance to get through. Such
interactions offer a mutually sympathetic at
mosphere in which a person can express her
inner thoughts and motivations, a chance to
genuinely test those attitudes and have her
failings exposed.
This theory that I am advancing - call it
the "taming-the-demon-within prescription"
is undermined by the example of Barack
Obama's presidency. President Obama came

into office with what seemed like such an
earnest intention to bring disagreeing people
together. We saw it in his speech to the
world's Muslims in Cairo; we saw it in his
speech on abortion at the University of
Notre Dame's commencement; we saw it in
his Nobel Peace Prize speech in Oslo on the
possibilities for a just war in pursuance of
peace.
Yet how ineffective he seems to have been
thus far! His way of moderation only seems
to have isolated him from Democrats while
making next to no progress in softening the
animosity toward him from fervent Republi
cans. The problem with Barack Obama's ap
proach seems in part to be that he is attempt
ing it at the macro level, delivering a single
man's message to groups of people stewing
within their cohorts of strong views. For one
man to speak sympathetically to festering
wells of animosity in the hopes of coming to
some mutual understanding is a forlorn
quest. He cannot do it alone.
More of us need to be in this with him,
from Congress to individuals. As a society, we
have to work on listening to the narratives of
others, understanding what has led them to
their views. This applies as much to Democ
rats listening to the narratives of those who
are prejudiced against, say, gay people as to
Republicans (at least the war hawks) listen
ing to the narratives of those who are sympa
thetic to, say, terrorists. We should listen not
because these views are acceptable, but
rather because we want to understand and
improve them.
This call for a cultural shift in which we
reel in our inner demons sounds a bit idealis
tic (even to its writer!). It reminds me of
David Cameron in his opening speech as
British Prime Minister this week in which he
called for a culture of responsibility where
government initiatives taking care of the
poorest would be replaced by the support of
individuals, families and communities. It was
a heavy dose of wishful thinking.
Changing a culture is tough work. But
when we consider that the bitter disputes di
viding our society will not go away while we
maintain the status quo, we are given good
reason to be hopeful. When a wishful answer
is the only answer, it is the answer worth
striving for.
