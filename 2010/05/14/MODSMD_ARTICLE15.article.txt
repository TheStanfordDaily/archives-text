## STD 101 
### Yanran Lu 
According to the Center for Disease
Control, an STD, or sexually trans
mitted disease, is "any disease that
can be transmitted through physical intima
cy, including kissing, oral sex, or any type of
genital contact" whether by same or opposite
sex. Most people understand very little about
STDs, partly because it has to do with the
"taboo" topic of sex. What some people don't
realize is that STDs are common and many
people who get STDs never display any
symptoms. Therefore, you cannot tell if
someone has an STD just by looking at them,
or tell if you have an STD just by looking at
yourself. So it is important to understand
STDs and get tested.
The pictures of STDs we look at are
usually extremely grotesque. So, here I will
give you some STD 101 without pictures.
Remember, the Web has many great re
sources to learn about these, e.g., CDC.
There are two classes of STDs, bac
terial and viral. The bacterial infections in
clude gonorrhea, chlamydia, syphilis, etc.
These are easily tested and treated. Viral in
fections, such as herpes, HIV, or HPV
(human papillomavirus) are a bit more diffi
cult because they are not curable, but can be
managed.
Gonorrhea and Chlamydia are sim
ilar in that they both cause inflammation of
the penis or cervix (they can also be latent, or
without symptoms). They are passed through
vaginal, anal, oral sex or childbirth.
Syphilis is called "the great imita
tor" because some of its symptoms look like
those of other infections. It is transmitted
through direct contact with a syphilis sore,
which is mainly found in the external genitals
or mouth (much like the transmission of her
pes).
Herpes is caused by herpes simplex
viruses types 1 and 2. Most herpes do not dis
play symptoms; and when they do occur, they
appear as one or more blisters on genitals,
rectum or lips. The infection stays in the body
indefinitely although outbreaks tend to de
crease over the years.
HPV is generally associated with
genital warts and can lead to cancer of the
cervix, the penis, the anus, etc. It is the most
common sexually transmitted virus (through

genital contact even with condoms) and
has 40 types.
HIV causes AIDS and is transmit
ted by blood or sex (bodily fluids). The risk
for HIV increases 2-5 times with the pres
ence of another STD.
Therefore, it is important to prac
tice safe sex. Using a condom can protect
against certain types of STDs including gon
orrhea, chlamydia, HIV and trichomonas.
Condoms can't protect against diseases that
are spread outside the area that a condom
covers, such as herpes, syphilis or genital
warts. Condoms should be used in all types of
sex including anal and oral. In addition to
condoms, it is important to get tested for
STDs periodically (in fact at least every year
and/or before a new sex partner). It is also
important to be able to talk openly about sex
with your partner. It can be awkward, but it
must be done for the sake of both individu
als' health.
Some people think that they are not
at risk for STDs because they only have one
partner. However, that is not true every
one who is sexually active is at risk (some
STDs are also transmitted through sharing of
needles or by birth, so more people are at
risk). Some people choose to remain igno
rant and feel what they don't know can't hurt
them. However, sometimes what you don't
know can be deadly. For example, you can get
chlamydia and not know it; leaving it untreat
ed can make you (if you're a woman) infer
tile (the bacteria can spread to your fallopian
tubes or uterus). It is much better to know if
you have an STD and start to get treatment
for it than to ignore it all together. As previ
ously mentioned, most STDs are treatable

and/or manageable.
There is no reason not to get tested.
Particularly when Stanford offers free STD
screening at Vaden. You can choose either
confidential or anonymous testing. Each has
its own advantages, and you can try both if
you want.
The confidential testing is more
comprehensive. You can schedule an ap
pointment through Vaden and see an M.D. or
N.P.The appointment is only 20 minutes long,
during which you can discuss any concerns
you have with your doctor and determine
which STDs you want to test for. There are
three types of testing, blood, urine and pap
(women). The urine test detects gonorrhea
and chlamydia, the blood test screens for
things such as HIV, hepatitis B and syphilis
and, for women, the pap test checks for HPV.
The blood test can also be used to check for
herpes and hepatitis C, but is not commonly
performed.
You can also choose anonymous
testing with HfV-Pact. With an anonymous
name, you make two, one-hour appointments
at the same exact time for two consecutive
weeks with the same peer sexual health
counselor, who is usually a trained student.
The HIV-PACT offers blood or saliva tests
for HIV and sexual health counseling.
Get tested and use condoms, so you
can make love and stay healthy.
