## DRIVING TOWARD A TITLE 
### JUSTIN MARPOLE-BIRD CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
On Friday, the No. 1 Stanford
women's water polo team will open
the first round of the National Colle
giate Championship against No. 8
Pomona-Pitzer at San Diego State's
Aztec Aquaplex in San Diego, Calif.
Though it enters the contest as the
top seed, the Cardinal (24-2,7-0 Pac
-10) has two losses on its record this
year against teams in the tourna
ment, although Stanford has beaten
both on other occasions.
Stanford entered the Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation (MPSF)
Tournament as the top seed two
weeks ago but settled for third place,
losing in the semifinals.
Despite opening the tournament
with a 10-5 quarterfinal victory over
No. 8 seed Arizona State on April 30,
the women were upset 7-6 by UCLA,
the eventual champion.
Stanford was able to salvage two
honors though, beating California in
the bronze medal game and having
senior two-meter Jessica Steffens se
lected to the All-Tournament Team.

Like her senior teammates, Stef
fens will undoubtedly feel the pres
sure to bring a national title back to
the Farm for the first time since 2002.
However, history indicates that the
ladies will likely have a great chance
for a second championship.
Since the inception of the tourna
ment in 2001, Stanford is the only
team to have reached the tourna
ment every year and has never fin
ished lower than third. That said, tra
dition also seems to dictate that the
ladies finish in that same spot
each of the last three years, Stanford
has finished third in the NCC.
For Steffens, Kelly Eaton, Alex
Holshouser and Alex Koran, this is
their last opportunity to break that
trend. This group of seniors will bring
their 46 percent of the team's goal
scoring to bear when the ladies take
on Pomona-Pitzer. The Cardinal will
also depend on its leading individual
goal scorer, sophomore two-meter
Melissa Seidemann, and consistent
goaltending from junior Amber
Oland and freshman Kate Baldoni.
The team will also look to Steffens,
its top MPSF performer and United

States Olympian, to spearhead its de
fensive efforts.
Stanford will feel very much at
home at this tournament, as it has al
ready met five of the tournament's
eight teams. Stanford has beaten
those five teams this season, includ
ing USC and UCLA, and will look to
take the lead in their season series
with those squads en route to the
title.
First up is Pomona-Pitzer, which is
playing in its second National Colle
giate Championship in the last three
years. The Sagehens won the SCIAC
Tournament with a 12-11 overtime
title-game win over Occidental. The
top players for Pomona-Pitzer are
SCIAC Athlete of the Year Tamara
Perea, and First-Team All-SCIAC
selections Karen Bonner, Sarah
Tuggy and Sarah Woods.
Stanford will begin play in the Na
tional Collegiate Championship
today at 4 p.m. in San Diego, Calif.
Live results will be available on the
NCAA's website.
