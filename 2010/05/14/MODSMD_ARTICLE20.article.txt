What a difference ten
months can make. Less
than a year ago, The
Dead Weather released their first
album, "Horehound." Jack White's
newest supergroup found White
at the drums, leaving lead guitar
and vocal duties to Dean Fertita
and The Kills' Alison Mosshart,
respectively. While the debut
showed flashes of brilliance, it was
more interesting than exciting. It
hinted at the band's potential
more than it actually realized it.
In just ten months The Dead
Weather have bridged the gap
between possibility and reality.
With their sophomore effort, "Sea
of Cowards," The Dead Weather
settle into themselves and fulfill
the potential hinted at in
"Horehound."
The opening track demon-

strates The Dead Weather's grow
ing assurance in the band dynam
ic. "Blue Blood Blues" establishes
the self-imposed resistance by
which the album lives and dies. It
shakes with angry defiance. The
guitars punch in staccato over a
simple drum beat before falling
into an easy guitar riff, but the
music continually undercuts
itself. The song breaks down as
soon as it begins to assume a
standard form. The obvious riff
falters after one bar, outdone by a
single, defiant crunch of Dean
Fertita's guitar. The song con
stantly denies the listener's expec
tations. With The Dead Weather,
assumed harmonies dissolve. The
instruments compete with each
other. The vocals oppose the
instruments, and the two rarely
coexist harmoniously. "Check

your lips at the door woman /
Shake your hips like battleships,"
shouts White against the music.
"Blue Blood Blues" struggles
against itself in typical Jack White
fashion, providing the raw energy
upon which The Dead Weather
relies.
"Sea of Cowards" is an explo
ration of rhythm and sexuality. It
is a triumph of the instinctual
over the systematic. Charisma
replaces structure. The bass drives
heavy. The drums compel you to
swagger. Songs like "Hustle and
Cuss" trust a primal groove to
give direction. It is the most
potent realization of The Dead
Weather's exploratory mode.
"Hustle and Cuss" starts with a
simple bass riff and unconsciously
extends outward. The song fol
lows the intuition of feeling.

While the song gains energy as it
progresses, The Dead Weather are
experts in the use of silence to
contrast rhythm. The music grows
and fades with a breathing
instinct.
The Dead Weather's defining
antagonism simultaneously limits
their potential for success. "Sea of
Cowards" thrives on opposition.
The music derives its energy from
denial. Consequently, the album
lacks the order of melody that
might give The Dead Weather the
popularity enjoyed by The White
Stripes. Indeed, the album's high
light comes in "Die by the Drop,"
in which they forgo instinct for a
familiar song structure. It main
tains the volatile mood but does
away with the exploration. This

song suggests a possible new
direction for The Dead Weather.
Will their next album perfect
their exploratory instincts, or will
they use "Die by the Drop" as a
model for structured swagger?
Hopefully we will only have to
wait 10 months to find out.
