# LCD Soundsystem "This is Happening"

LCD Soundsystem's 2007
classic "Sound of Silver"
featured a one-two punch
for the ages in the tracks
"Someone Great" and "All My
Friends." Both were lengthy, liter
ary, personal songs, a monumental
step forward in the writing of
singer-producer James Murphy
and a reminder that the sensibili
ties of dance and electronic music
can connect with head and body
in equal measure. To choose a
favorite between the two was dif
ficult for any listener, chiefly
because they offered such differ
ent virtues. "Someone Great" con
tained a wrenching sadness within
the sterile repetition of a tight,
glitchy loop, Murphy delivering
each line with a hollowed out
sense of inevitability. Follow-up
"All My Friends" had no use for
such an effort to compress and
conceal within a tight frame; from
the slide of its keyboards to the
gradual layering of its guitars, the
song was all churn and forward
motion, the narrator making
sense of his thoughts on the
move.
The great strength of both
songs was their unimaginable
confidence; they were both state
ments, perceptive ones, about
fundamental areas of human
experience loss, recollection,
insecurity, regret. Murphy seemed
to take minimal solace from
either effort, but for a weary indie
sensibility in the later part of the
decade, the two songs could not
have felt more significant, more
like important statements. For the
band, they were a different kind
of statement: mini-artistic mani
festos, two separate, inarguable
indications that they could make
music that meant something.
These two songs, and the
twin courses they offer the band
for capturing significance through
a beautiful resignation and
detachment, cast a long shadow
over LCD's third album, "This is
Happening." They're a source of
credibility, a reason for giddy
anticipation and above all, a chal
lenge can Murphy throw down
another gem? Will he make a new
statement?
To this last and most pressing
question: no. There's no successor
here. The album offers nine
tracks, seven clocking in at over
six minutes, but no song makes a

play for the crown. And because
this means none of the songs are
trying to be statements, this is
very much a good thing. The
album finds Murphy bringing the
confidence of LCD away from
reserved observation to

engage in some good,
old-fashioned human
warmth, mixing it up
with the play of love
and connection.
"Dance Yrself
Clean" opens in a sweet
spot for the band, lay
ing down an irresistible
percussive line and let
ting Murphy drop some
of his finely observed
couplets. When the
song lets loose with a
ragged burst of synthe
sizers, however, it heads
somewhere grasping,
even confrontational:
"Don't you want me to
wake up?" he belts out,
before adding "then
give me just a bit of

your time." It's the first
indication that Murphy
wants out of the effort
less sweet spot he's
found, away from
detachment, even if it

means sounding less
important.
It's not that
LCD Soundsystem
has never been a fun
band, but the enjoy
ment has always had
a sharp edge, more
the happiness you
get from hearing
something clever
than the un-self
conscious joy of
something less cal
culated. Across the
album, LCD works
to fight falling back
by bringing some
thing new to its old
habits. The warm
shimmer of "You
Wanted a Hit" soft-

ens its defiance and
confidence and points to a desire
for simple connection: "We won't
be your babies 'till you take us
home," Murphy writes, declining
to simply dispense with the wit.
Even the danceable "Pow Pow,"
eight minutes of Murphy reveling
in his cleverness, overflows with

exuberance: he's less defensive
and more engaged, and the music
below his half-spoken lyrics is all
peppy mischief.
"I Can Change" goes for
something else entirely: for all its

flirtations with cynicism and its
self-deprecating melancholy, it's a
flat-out love song, and to hear
Murphy operate in that mode is a
delight. "Dance with me until I
feel alright," he says, and while he
reminds us that "love is a murder
er," it's clear that he's friends with

him anyway. This resignation to a
measure of unhappiness as a
starting point, rather than a con
clusion, shows up elsewhere on
album centerpiece "All I Want." A
hum of rough guitars almost

drowns Murphy's
voice, his words com
ing through clearly
only on the chorus,
when he pleads "All I
want is your pity ...
All I want is your pity
tears." It's mopey, even
laughable phrasing,
but to its credit, it
plays far differently
with the music, and
that's precisely the
point: no one should
be reading the song.
And when he belts out
"take me home" in the
song's closing minutes,
the sense that Murphy
is finally comfortable
with letting the walls
down is a source for

great comfort. His self
criticism and outright
longing may not be the
stuff of delight, but the
naked sincerity under
lying his words is:
Murphy is looking for
ward, not back-

ward, trying to
change the story
rather than narrate
it perfectly.
Fittingly, "This
is Happening" isn't
as neat a thesis as
I'd like it to be.
There are two cer
tified relics among
the bunch: the
catchy "One
Touch" sounds
uncannily like a
"Sound of Silver"
b-side, a glum
dance track where
Murphy retreats
back into aloof
ness. "Drunk
Girls" is another
LCD staple, the

"fun single." Yet on a record where
Murphy is reaching out much
more often, to greater effect and
with more sincerity, the loosen
things-up role the single played
on prior efforts isn't necessary.
The other tracks are happy to put
on the party this time, while

"Girls" comes off as making wise
cracks in the next room. Yet even
in these two flashbacks to an
older LCD, there are glimpses of a
longing to get down and partici
pate: on "Drunk Girls," Murphy
calls out: "I believe in waking up
together ... so that means mak
ing eyes across the room."
All the warmth and simple
goodness of what Murphy is
reaching for culminates in
"Home," the album's gorgeous
closer and perhaps its standout
offering. The track dials down the
anthemic reach, adds a warm
glow to the glitchy percussion and
settles into an almost sunny
groove. Floating above, Murphy
enters thinking he should write
another statement: "Just do it
right, make it perfect and real."
Yet he casts the project aside, con
fessing that his grasp on what
makes us all tick may be a pose to
let go of: "Under lights we're all
unsure," he admits, and when he
calls out that "no one really
knows what you're talking about,"
it's part accusation and part con
fession. He's happy to let his fine
ly-tuned narrative structures fray
and dissemble, and the band is
with him all the way, rising up to
meet him and brimming with
good feeling.
Murphy and his collaborators
have become content with con
necting more meaningfully, rather
than being more meaningful, and
the results couldn't be any
warmer or more inviting. I, for
one, hope Murphy stays here with
us for a while he's been outside
too long.
"Take me home," Murphy
asks throughout the album. "This
is Happening" comes out May 17
and you should listen to him.
