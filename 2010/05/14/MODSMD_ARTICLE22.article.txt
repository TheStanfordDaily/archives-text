# It Felt More Like Naysayer

On a lazy Monday, the last
thing the members of
Yeasayer were prepared for
was a show. Stretched out on the
couches of their makeshift camp for
the day an isolated Row house
living room they were enrap
tured by Liz Lemon's screeching on
the latest "30 Rock" and counting
down the hours until home and the
much-needed break.
As they settled themselves after
sound check, the band members
shifted their focus to a spread of
catered food and drinks a half
eaten rotisserie chicken, organic
avocados and beef jerky littered a
coffee table between bottles of sake
and Orangina. But the peace was
broken by a provision of pungent
cheese that lay untouched on the
table.
"That cheese f reeks,"
said bassist Ira Wolf Tuton. "It's f
grossing me out."
Despite the moans, the cheese
remained. No one was willing to
put in the energy or relinquish his
comfortable position to take action.
It was too much work.
At the tail end of a tour that
began in February, the members of
Yeasayer were tired. They'd been
everywhere from Coachella to
Cologne, and only one performance
a college gig at Stanford lay
between them and the promise of
home. And that's where conversa
tion fluttered toward, as they could
hardly hide the anticipation of
sleeping in their own beds for the
first time in four months. Guitarist
Anand Wilder began counting off
the shows he'd be attending while
home HAIR, Iggy Pop and a
Sleigh Bells release party. But Tuton
politely disagreed.
"F— that, I'm not going," he
said. "The last thing I want to do a
day after tour is go to a show. F—
that. F— no. That's like one of the
five days we're off. I don't want to
be in a loud venue. I just want to go
to dinner when I want to go to din
ner and chill."
"You don't really like music,
huh?," Wilder joshed.
"I don't really like music,"
Tuton replied. "I like personal
music, not collective music."

Two hours before their sched
uled appearance, Yeasayer looked
more like a bunch of college stu
dents on the brink of summer than
a band who has enjoyed a meteoric
rise up the indie ranks after releas
ing their second album, "Odd

Blood." Still, they had an obligation
to play, and after being moved
indoors because of rain, the show
seemed an easy way to kill an hour
or two before they boarded red-eyes
for the East Coast.
After the opening act, The Sea

People (which includes a few
Stanford students), Yeasayer stepped
on stage to an enthusiastic crowd
loaded into the quickly prepared
Oak Room in Tresidder Union.
Among them stood dedicated fans
with signs and those simply inter-

ested in glimpsing the $lB,OOO coup
that Stanford Concert Network
managed to pull off in attracting
the band to campus.
But Yeasayer came on, seeming
ly preoccupied by their thoughts of
home. Launching immediately into

"The Children," the autotuned
anomaly from "Odd Blood," the
band couldn't shake the lethargy
that had plagued them for much of
the afternoon. Those unfamiliar
with the song were puzzled, hoping
that the low-pitched, Gothic chant
was not the band's M.O. Luckily, it's
not, and following the sedated start,
the band kicked it up another gear
to pump out the enjoyable "Rome"
and later "Summer."
Still, crowd interaction was at a
premium, as lead singer Chris
Keating only addressed the audience
four songs in and seemed intent on
finishing the set as soon as possible.
The feeling was palpable. The
crowd, while welcoming with brief
bursts of applause, was unsure how
to react, creating an awkward
atmosphere between song transi
tions.
At that point, "2080_ was more
than welcome, and the song served
as something of a turning point for
Yeasayer's set. The apocalyptic tune
provided a kind of second wind to
both the band and the crowd, as
Keating, Wilder and Tuton alternat
ed between the song's melodic wail
ing and fast-paced chanting. It pro
vided a platform from which to
launch into the band's hits, as they
next played fan-favorite "Tightrope"
and the infectious "0.N.E."
The smiles came out soon after,
as Yeasayer found their comfort
zone more than halfway through
their performance. But with their
set fixed, the feeling only lasted for a
few songs after. Cue "Madder Red,"
an impressive display of harmonies
and Wilder's solo efforts and finally,
"Ambling Alp," which sent the
crowd into raptures and caused a
somewhat forced stage invasion.
And while Yeasayer left to chants of
"one more song," they were having
none of it. Their manager stepped
on stage to hush the crowd and
send them to the exits. Stepping off
stage, Yeasayer was homeward
bound as soon as the last synth cut
out.
