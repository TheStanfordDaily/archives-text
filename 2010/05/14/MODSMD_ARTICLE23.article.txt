# American Woman: Fashioning a National Identity

Fashion has the capricious
power to not only define us,
but also to be our own tool
for defining ourselves. The compli
cation ensues from the contention
between personal expression and
the way society catalogues it all
away and enforces the clean bound
aries. Then, just to make it really
confusing, art goes and mixes the
two together. For example, maga
zines encourage self-expression on
the same page that it reinforces the
categorizations of women.
This past Monday, all of these
forces came to a massive collision in
the fashion event that is the annual

Met Gala. The red carpets are
swarming with the beautiful people
defining their personal styles, while
moments after their pictures are
taken, they are classified and dis

the actual exhibition celebrating

introduce the artistic meddling and
the abstract cartoon-like concept of
The American Woman, branded, of

1890s to the 19405. The six cate
gories are the heiress, the Gibson
girl, the Bohemian, the suffragist,
the patriot, the flapper and the
screen siren.

The different facets of the
American woman's collective style
are all fighting for the expression of
some freedom against, although still
inherently linked to, the traditional
roles of female as confined, power
less and sexualized object.
The heiress holds some eco
nomic power, though stuck in
corsets tightened by society and
dressed in elegant ball gowns much
like a Disney princess. Her strug
gling identity is alongside the
Gibson girl, a term inspired by
Charles Dana Gibson's illustrations
of a new slim athletic figure, whose
clothes became more practical out
