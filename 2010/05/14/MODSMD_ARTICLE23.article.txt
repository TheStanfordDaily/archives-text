# American Woman: Fashioning a National Identity
##

Fashion has the capricious
power to not only define us,
but also to be our own tool
for defining ourselves. The compli
cation ensues from the contention
between personal expression and
the way society catalogues it all
away and enforces the clean bound
aries. Then, just to make it really
confusing, art goes and mixes the
two together. For example, maga
zines encourage self-expression on
the same page that it reinforces the
categorizations of women.
This past Monday, all of these
forces came to a massive collision in
the fashion event that is the annual

Met Gala. The red carpets are
swarming with the beautiful people
defining their personal styles, while
moments after their pictures are
taken, they are classified and dis
cussed on the Internet. Add that to
the actual exhibition celebrating
specific archetypes of The American
Woman, and we've managed to
introduce the artistic meddling and
the abstract cartoon-like concept of
The American Woman, branded, of
course, by its sponsors Oprah
Winfrey, Anna Wintour and The
Gap.
Everything surrounding The
Metropolitan Museum of Art

Costume Institute Gala this year is a
perfect example of the competing
trajectories of fashion and the
American woman's identity.
American Vogue did an editorial
featuring each of the galleries'
selected archetypes, providing mod
ern well-known models as fuzzy
definitions.
The exhibition itself is broken
up into six different archetypes of
the American woman from the
1890s to the 19405. The six cate
gories are the heiress, the Gibson
girl, the Bohemian, the suffragist,
the patriot, the flapper and the
screen siren.

The different facets of the
American woman's collective style
are all fighting for the expression of
some freedom against, although still
inherently linked to, the traditional
roles of female as confined, power
less and sexualized object.
The heiress holds some eco
nomic power, though stuck in
corsets tightened by society and
dressed in elegant ball gowns much
like a Disney princess. Her strug
gling identity is alongside the
Gibson girl, a term inspired by
Charles Dana Gibson's illustrations
of a new slim athletic figure, whose
clothes became more practical out

of necessity from her active lifestyle.
The curator of the exhibit, Andrew
Bolton, explains that, "the Gibson
girl came out of the domestic
sphere through sport, and the
bohemian came out of the domestic
sphere through the arts."
The Bohemian section attempts
to break from Victorian tradition by
omitting all of the corsets, and
instead seeking aesthetic inspiration
from Classicism and Orientalism.
Clearly demanding a change, suffra
gists wore specific tricolored gar
ments to signify solidarity, dressing
for a specific cause. However, they
simultaneously became immediately
recognizable to the rest of the socie
ty in their own new category. In
opposition to expression, the patri
ot section was filled with military
uniforms, the ultimate visually
defining garment.
Finally, the last two rooms of
the exhibit explored a modern
example of female independence
and definition through sexual free
dom. The flapper was an expression
of sexual freedom with drop-waist,

above the knee (scandal!) slip dress
es and short bobs. In contrast,
Bolton says, "while the flapper was
girlish and flirtatious, the screen
siren was womanly and sensuous."
The modern vehicle of cinema pro
duced the screen siren, all skin-tight
sex appeal.
Each historical incarnation of
the complex attempts to reach self
definition by style still concedes to
tradition, is an archetype and flat
tened in time. However, I'm confi
dent that the evolution of this
abstract definition of the American
woman is getting closer to freedom,
regardless of all its levels of com
plexity, just by watching some of my
favorite beautiful people make dar
ing and unique sartorial choices.
