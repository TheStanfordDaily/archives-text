On a chilly Wednesday night,
two students emerged from
the shadows of Terman
Engineering building, their bleary
eyes meeting a most curious sight.
Two figures, one clad in sus
penders and spectacles, the other
hitching up a pair of oversized
pants, wildly splashed and shrieked
their way across the serene waters of
Terman reflecting pool. Not to be
mistaken for members of a fountain
hopping expedition gone awry,
these students are members of the
Stanford Shakespeare Company.
This weekend, StanShakes presents
"The Tempest," an ambitious pro-

duction crafted by director Alex
Connolly that delivers a smart
blend of humor, romance and
drama.
Prospero, the former duke of
Milan, and his young daughter
Miranda are forced to flee their
country following a political rebel
lion staged by Antonio, his conniv
ing brother, and Alonso, the Queen
of Naples. Sent out to sea to their
deaths, they land on a mysterious
island. 12 years pass, and it is here
the play begins. Prospero, having
mastered the art of sorcery, takes
advantage of a royal sailing expedi
tion, and shipwrecks his enemies

ashore.
Within the span of two and
half hours, Prospero's machinations
unfold on the exotic island, a fan
tastical place inhabited by spirits
and supernatural forces. Despite
Shakespeare's foray into the mysti
cal, his tale remains grounded in the
very human themes of imprison
ment, vengeance and redemption.
StanShakes' staging of this clas
sic work is fresh and exciting. "The
Tempest" takes place on 17 plat
forms, built from scratch, which
stand slightly above the surface of
Terman fountain. Director
Connolly's vision of nature abstract
unfurls in the form of Rothko
inspired large wooden frames that
house the roiling waves of
Prospero's turmoil.
The breathtaking location is
used to full dramatic effect, from
the background of the open night
sky to the sloping hill upon which
the audience rests. Unfortunately
for the actors, this includes wading
barefoot through the icy cold waters
of the fountain.
"It's not the step into the water
it's the step out of the water that
gets you," laughed Mary Glen
Fredrick'l2, who, as the magical
spirit Ariel, has the difficult task of

appearing unfazed by the elements.
And the setting was not the
only inspired idea at the table for
the first time in its history,
StanShakes is using a live band.
Audiences may be surprised to hear
the music of Andrew Bird and
Beirut featured prominently
throughout the play. Music direc
tors Caroline Chen 'l2 and Chris
Winterbauer' 11 sifted through a
large handful of music before set
tling on the folk rock acts.
Winterbauer cited Beirut's gypsy
feel and haunting sense of isolation
as the reason for the final decision,
in addition to the fact that "their
music is not limited to one time
period, much like Shakespeare him
self." While the music is occasionally
distracting in its modernity, for the
most part, it enhances the fanciful,
lyrical nature of the scenes.
Questionable is the inclusion of
lines from W.H. Auden's "The Sea
and the Mirror" at a critical point in
the plot. While it is powerful from a
dramatic standpoint, highlighting
Prospero's psychological state, nei
ther the language nor the staging
translates effectively. As a whole,
however, Connolly's direction and
vision is solid.
While the production is to be

commended for its creativity, the
heart and sheer entertainment fac
tor stems from the actors' quality
performances. The play's leads are
natural with the material, although
in drastically different ways.
Michael Hammersly' 11 as Prospero
is fraught with personal demons,
although he maintains a regal pres
ence all the more accentuated by the
actor's classical Shakespearean
delivery. Mary Beth Corbett 'l2
brings a modern sentiment to the
young, naive Miranda. It is a treat
to simply watch Mary Glen
Fredrick's roving eyes a spirit
among humans, Ariel is both direc

tor and spectator to the unfolding
events. The three have a wonderful
chemistry that engages the audience
in the beginning expository scenes.
Rounding out the audience
favorites are Julia Meltzer 'lO and
Geeta Persad 'lO as Stephano and
Trinculo, respectively. As the pri
mary comic act, the duo plays off
one another exquisitely. Dan
Strawser 'lO is to be noted also for
his amusing portrayal of the opti
mistic, nature-loving, faithful
Gonzalo.
On preparing for her portrayal
of the grotesque monster Caliban,
Leigh Marshall 'l3 praises her role
as both a challenge and a means of
discovery. "Acting isn't about put
ting on these layers, it's about rip
ping your skin apart."
Oddly enough, she notes, in
accessing the rawest, most primal
emotions required of her role, she
found something that was funda
mentally human. Indeed, "The
Tempest" serves as a revealing
reminder of the cruelty and the
potential of humankind.
