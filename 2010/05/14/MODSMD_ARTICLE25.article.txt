# Remote Nomad: Bloody Hell

There are 30 days until the
return of the Grey Goose
of media vampires, "True
Blood" ("Twilight" is Svedka
because of the badvertising, and
"Vampires Diaries" is something
akin to rubbing alcohol). Despite
my excitement and alcohol
metaphors, I'm distraught by
what seems to be an HBO crack
down on illegal Internet outlets
such as Megavideo, and by my
resulting inability to relive seasons
one and two 72 minutes at a time.
Fortunately, creator Alan Ball and
the cast of "True Blood" are creat
ing six "minisodes" to hype up the
June 13 premiere. Three of the six
have aired, featuring, respectively:
Eric and Pam; Jessica and Sookie;
and Tara and Lafayette.
When HBO announced the
"minisodes," the reaction was sur
prisingly epic. The history of the
"webisode," arguably the precur
sor to or cousin of the "min
isode," proves rather lackluster
and unsuccessful. The premise, to
manipulate an audience's love for
the characters and nothing else,
violates my primary expectation
of television shows, that the nar
rative will not waste my time. For
example, "Glee" fails at this

because its episodic approach to
storytelling deprives me of any
continuity. I love characters like
Liz Lemon and Michael Scott, but
only within a familiar context
with stakes that mean something
to me. The ostensible objective of
the "True Blood" minisodes is to
bridge the gap between seasons
two and three. Fair enough.
But then I thought about
"Mad Men." Imagine if minisodes
had punctuated the wait between
seasons one and two, when the
show jumped from 1960 to 1962;
the surprise and the ambiguity
that define the show would have
been lost. "True Blood" is not
"Mad Men," but the former tradi
tionally relies on mystery and
hokey back-stories to introduce
new characters such as Maryann
from season two. In the Sookie,
Tara and Lafayette minisode, the
action of which occurs the morn
ing after Bill saves Sam and
orchestrates Maryann's death, I
couldn't bring myself to care
about Sookie and Tara's bickering,
because their conversation is so
unrelated to the cliffhangers from
season two. These more "straight"
(unintentional pun for Lafayette .
..) characters may inherently be

less fun to watch three minutes at
a time than Eric and Pam or
Jessica.
My greater objection to the
minisodes relates to tone and
oeuvre. The first minisode shows
Eric and Pam casting dancers for
Fangtasia, Eric's vampire night
club. For half of the few minutes,
the tone is completely wrong
one blogger praised it with a
comparison to "American Idol,"
but that simile embodies all that
bothered me about it. The dumb
humor of bad dancers, fat men
and ugly women is so beneath the
commentary and witticisms I
have come to expect from "True
Blood." Because Eric and Pam
reacted the way I would have to
these performers, they lost some
of their magic. Fortunately, the
scene got its groove back with the
entrance of an Eastern European
hottie whom both characters vied
for, with Eric ultimately pushing
Pam out of the way with a velour
sleeve (metaphorically, of course).
Obliquely, the minisodes hint at
the core values of the series: sexu
ality (Eric and Pam), religion
(Jessica), race and discrimination
(Sookie and Tara).
Not only was the humor uni
versally unimaginative, but the
production quality seemed
unusually low. Not every scene
can reach the heights of the "True
Blood" title sequence, which
establishes gothic themes in a
modern American South context
so brilliantly, artistically and effi
ciently. However, in these
webisodes, the lighting was flat
and harsh, the camera didn't
move and the scripts were pre
dictable. At this point, "True
Blood" doesn't have anything to
prove to anyone, yet I wish they
had tried harder, particularly with
a character as juicy as Jessica.
Television advertising tactics
never cease to fascinate me, but at
the end of the day, I'm happy that
summer is nearly upon us, and
that I can apply my newfound
academic understanding of
Gothic literature to material as
dense and rich as "True Blood."
