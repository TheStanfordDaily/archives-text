## Hennessy lays out new construction President addresses Academic Council 
### AMY JULIA HARRIS MANAGING EDITOR 
If you build it, excellence will come.
That was the theme of University
President John Hennessy's annual ad
dress to the Academic Council yesterday
entitled "Positioning Stanford for the
Future: New Places and Spaces." In the
two-part talk and walking tour, which
began in the auditorium of the newly
dedicated Stanford Institute for Eco
nomic Policy Research (SIEPR) build
ing and then moved to the newly-opened
Jen-Hsun Huang Engineering Center in
the southeast corner of the new Science
and Engineering Quadrangle, Hennessy
laid out the "big picture" of Stanford's
construction projects.
"In 1895, in an address, David Starr
Jordan was unequivocal that the Univer
sity was an investment in the future,"
Hennessy said, addressing dozens of as
sembled faculty. "The best spent money
of the present is to invest in the future.
And we're focusing on the future."
Hennessy said the main goals of the
expansion are to equip Stanford with
state-of-the-art research facilities that
meet 21st-century needs but maintain
the architectural integrity of the old cam
pus established by architect Frederick
Law Olmsted. The construction model is
based on the idea of developing "aca
demic precincts" along major roads of
campus, such as Serra Mall, to increase
access to new departments and help so
lidify community among and between
different departments and, in the
process, adhere to Olmsted's idea of cre
ating open vistas and quadrangles that
make the most of Stanford's natural en
vironment.
The major projects discussed on
Thursday were the new Graduate School
of Business, which is still under construc
tion; an arts district along Palm Drive,
which just saw the groundbreaking of the
Bing Concert Hall; changes to graduate
residences like Munger; additions to the
Law School in the form of faculty clinics;
and additions to the School of Medicine,
with the construction of the Lorry I.
Lokey Stem Cell Research Building.
"We are in the middle of a third Stone
Age," Hennessy said. "Building is the
biggest challenge we face at the
moment."
The breadth of the construction
projects which Hennessy said ri
vals the extensive construction at
Stanford's founding, termed "the
first Stone Age" by Jordan is an
attempt to keep the University on
the cutting-edge of research facili
ties and interdepartmental collabo
ration.
Jim Harris '64, an electrical engi
neering professor who was on cam
pus in the 1960s when Stanford was
then undergoing a round of con
struction projects, said the new
building plans seemed much more
thought-out than the campus addi
tions in the past.
"The building then seemed to
be haphazard, but this plan focuses
on integration," Harris said.
"Stanford has a strong campus
core," Harris continued. "Like only
a few other campuses, it is rather
isolated, so there is space to inte
grate."
John Rickford, a linguistics pro
fessor, appreciated Hennessy's ad
dress for laying out a comprehen

sive look of Stanford's building
plans.
"There was always a general
sense of building on campus, but
you don't know the larger blue
print," Rickford said.
Rickford said he liked the over
riding philosophy of the expansion
model, which is science- and engi
neering- focused, but also centered
on the arts.
"It's amazing that we're contin
uing to build at a time when things
are so bad," he said. "It's inspiring."
Hennessy closed his remarks in
the Jen-Hsun Huang Engineering
Center by re-emphasizing the role
that the new buildings would play
in Stanford's future. But he said
that ultimately, the facilities came
back to the people.
