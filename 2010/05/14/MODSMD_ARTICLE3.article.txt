### AMY JULIA HARRIS MANAGING EDITOR 
If you build it, excellence will come.
That was the theme of University
President John Hennessy's annual ad
dress to the Academic Council yesterday
entitled "Positioning Stanford for the
Future: New Places and Spaces." In the
two-part talk and walking tour, which
began in the auditorium of the newly
dedicated Stanford Institute for Eco
nomic Policy Research (SIEPR) build

Jen-Hsun Huang Engineering Center in
the southeast corner of the new Science
and Engineering Quadrangle, Hennessy
laid out the "big picture" of Stanford's

meet 21st-century needs but maintain

Law Olmsted. The construction model is
based on the idea of developing "aca
demic precincts" along major roads of
campus, such as Serra Mall, to increase
access to new departments and help so
lidify community among and between
different departments and, in the
process, adhere to Olmsted's idea of cre

make the most of Stanford's natural en

The major projects discussed on
Thursday were the new Graduate School
of Business, which is still under construc

which just saw the groundbreaking of the
Bing Concert Hall; changes to graduate
residences like Munger; additions to the
Law School in the form of faculty clinics;
and additions to the School of Medicine,
with the construction of the Lorry I.
Lokey Stem Cell Research Building.
"We are in the middle of a third Stone
Age," Hennessy said. "Building is the
