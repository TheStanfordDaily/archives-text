With two weeks of rest since the Pac
-10 Championships, the Stanford women's
tennis team appears ready and eager to
pursue postseason success, hosting the
first and second rounds of the NCAAs at
Taube Family Tennis Stadium.
With a final regular season record of
20-1 and an undefeated 8-0 in Pac-10
play the Cardinal succeeded in
achieving its main goal for the season: re
capturing the Pac-10 title.
The success of the team this season
was on full display as Pac-10 and ITA Re
gional awards were passed out. Junior
Hilary Barte was named First Team All-
Pac-10. Freshman Mallory Burdette was
named Second Team All-Pac and was
awarded Pac-10 Freshman of the Year
for her 32-5 record overall.
Highlighting the team's success was
the naming of head coach Lele Forood as
Pac-10 Coach of the Year in one of the
most competitive conferences. This is the
fourth time she has won the award dur
ing her career on the Farm she has a
253-16 record over 10 years.
Adding to Pac-10 honors, the team
reaped awards from the ITA Northwest
Regional. Out of 15 teams from several

different leagues, Mallory Burdette was
named ITA Rookie of the Year, Barte
was given the ITA Player to Watch award
and Forood took home the WilsonyiTA
Coach of the Year honor. Despite the ac
colades, Forood is still curious how her
team will handle postseason play.
"Every team is different," she said.
"It's really a different cast of people. This

team had a better finish to the regular
season [than past years]. And it's a
younger team, so we'll see what W
that means as far as how we're going
to handle it."
Looking forward to NCAAs, Stan
ford has two participants in the singles
tournament and one team in doubles.
Barte and Burdette will compete in
NCAA singles. Barte was given the No.
4 seed overall in the tournament. In /
doubles, she will team up with senior J
Lindsay Burdette as the second M

seed overall.
As a team, the .
Cardinal will face

first round. Fair- ~~

"I'm not sure what to expect from
them," Barte said. "We don't really know
anything about them, but everyone is
pretty excited to just start the tourna
ment."
"It's really important to keep in
mind that yes, this is NCAA and yes,
everyone talks about it. But at the
same time, we have to remember
that it is just another match," Barte
said. "It's important to keep that in
