# Stanford's NCAA hopes
## 
### Danny Belch On My Mind 
Spring is here, which
means that the final wave
of NCAA championships
is upon us. We already
saw men's volleyball cap
an incredible season with an NCAA
title, its first since 1997 and Stan
ford's first this year. Will the per
formance of the volleyball team in
spire other teams to bring home the
hardware too? Let's see how we
stack up in spring championship sea
son.
Baseball
In an up-and-down season, Stan
ford looks to be in the mix to make
the NCAA field of 64. The team has
looked great this year with some big
wins and big sweeps, but has not
looked so great at times with some
tough losses. The hitting and pitching
can be described as solid but spo
radic sometimes, great offensive
and defensive performances don't al
ways pair up together. Stanford has
the talent to make a run at the Col
lege World Series (CWS) but needs
to have a strong finish to get favor
able seeding for a regional.
Softball
The softball team started the sea
son strong but has faded a bit as Pac
-10 play has geared up it is just 6-13
in conference play. This Stanford
team is capable of great things, as its
28-4 non-conference record shows.
Without great performances, an
early NCAA exit looms.
Track and Field
It will be hard for the Stanford
track and field teams to make a lot of
noise at the NCAA Championships.
Sophomore hurdler Amaechi Mor
ton and a pair of distance runners,
junior Elliot Heath and sophomore
Chris Derrick, will lead the way for
the Stanford men. Sophomore pole

vaulter Katerina Stefanidi, junior
jumper Arantxa King and senior
jumpers Griffin Matthew and Whit
ney Liehr are national contenders
on the women's side.
Women's Water Polo
One of Stanford's best chances
for another team championship is
the women's water polo team. It is
the top seed in the NCAA Tourna
ment that starts today in San Diego,
Calif. The team has been solid all
year, its only losses coming against
USC and UCLA. Luckily, both the
Trojans and the Bruins are on the
opposite side of the bracket, so Stan
ford would potentially only have to
beat one of them for the title.
Golf
The men's golf team is seeded
first in the Notre Dame/Midwest
Regional this weekend. The Cardi
nal is coming off a meltdown at the
Pac-10 Championships last week
end, where Washington overcame a
seven-shot deficit on the final day to
edge out Stanford. The Cardinal
should be able to advance out of its
regional, barring any setbacks,
which would put Stanford in con
tention for the NCAA title.
In contrast to the men, the
women's team surged with seven
birdies on the final seven holes to
claim the sixth of eight spots in the
NCAA Championships from its re
gional. Stanford will be fighting an
uphill battle at the NCAAs it has
not had great showings at NCAAs
in the recent past.
Women's Lacrosse
After getting snubbed from last
year's NCAA Tournament, the Car
dinal earned its way in this year and
will be playing James Madison to
morrow in the first round. Stanford
had to play a play-in-game last Sat
urday a spot it earned by winning
the MPSF's automatic bid. The Car
dinal defeated UMass and is now
headed to Virginia to take on the
No. 5 seed Dukes.
Tennis
Both the men's and women's ten
nis teams will be hosting first and
second round NCAA matches at the
Taube Tennis Center. Both teams
are seeded eighth in their respective
tournaments and should have no
trouble advancing this weekend
(each team has been stellar at
home). The big roadblocks come
later, as the No. 1 overall seed in
both brackets looms if the Cardinal
can advance. For the men that is Vir
ginia, and for the women it is Baylor.
