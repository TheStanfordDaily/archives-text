# Stanford's NCAA hopes
## 
### Danny Belch On My Mind 
Spring is here, which
means that the final wave
of NCAA championships
is upon us. We already
saw men's volleyball cap
an incredible season with an NCAA
title, its first since 1997 and Stan
ford's first this year. Will the per
formance of the volleyball team in
spire other teams to bring home the
hardware too? Let's see how we
stack up in spring championship sea
son.
Baseball
In an up-and-down season, Stan
ford looks to be in the mix to make
the NCAA field of 64. The team has
looked great this year with some big
wins and big sweeps, but has not
looked so great at times with some
tough losses. The hitting and pitching
can be described as solid but spo
radic sometimes, great offensive
and defensive performances don't al
ways pair up together. Stanford has
the talent to make a run at the Col
lege World Series (CWS) but needs
to have a strong finish to get favor
able seeding for a regional.
Softball
The softball team started the sea
son strong but has faded a bit as Pac
-10 play has geared up it is just 6-13
in conference play. This Stanford
team is capable of great things, as its
28-4 non-conference record shows.
Without great performances, an
early NCAA exit looms.
Track and Field
It will be hard for the Stanford
track and field teams to make a lot of
noise at the NCAA Championships.
Sophomore hurdler Amaechi Mor
ton and a pair of distance runners,
junior Elliot Heath and sophomore
Chris Derrick, will lead the way for
the Stanford men. Sophomore pole
