# ATTACKING THE COUGARS
## 
### DANIEL BOHM SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
In preparation for returning to Pacific-10 Con
ference play this weekend, the No. 25 Stanford
baseball team beat San Jose State (8-3) in San Jose
on Wednesday. The Cardinal (26-18,10-8 Pac-10)
now returns home from its four-game road trip to
host Washington State in what promises to be an
extremely important Pac-10 series.
Junior outfielder Dave Giuliani led the Cardi
nal offense against the Spartans (18-30), going 4-4
with two runs scored. Giuliani has recently forced
his way into the Stanford lineup he hit a pair of
home runs last week in addition to his four hits on
Wednesday.
"It's really nice to be in the lineup," Giuliani
said. "The biggest thing is the feeling of contribut
ing to a win. I've been together with some of these
guys for three years and they are my good friends.
It's been rough sitting down watching them con
tribute and not being able to; so it's nice to be a part
of it now."
With Giuliani's emergence, the Cardinal has
shuffled its defense, with Giuliani taking over in
left, freshman Stephen Piscotty shifting to first
base and junior Jonathan Kaskow moving into the
designated hitter role.
On Wednesday, Giuliani actually played left
and right field, as the starting right fielder, fresh
man Tyler Gaffney, left the game in the fourth in
ning with a sore groin an injury that isn't expect
ed to cause him to miss any time.
The biggest hit of the game was a third inning,
bases-clearing double off the bat of junior catcher
Zach Jones to give the Cardinal a 5-1 lead that it
would not relinquish.
Freshman Dean McArdle (4-0) went 2.2
shutout innings, surrendering just two hits for the
win. Also pitching well in relief was junior Danny
Sandbrink, who went three shutout innings.
Now the Cardinal turns its attention to Wash
ington State (26-17, 9-9). The Cougars are by no
means a traditional baseball powerhouse, but they
are currently fighting for a regional bid.
"Washington State took two out of three from
[No. 3 Arizona State] and they are playing well,"
Giuliani said. "Traditionally they are not a great
team, but they can't be overlooked. We have to
come out and try and stay in second place in the
Pac-10 or gain ground on first place."
In addition to taking two of three from the Sun
Devils back in April, Washington State comes in
riding a four-game winning streak that includes a
sweep of California last weekend.
This weekend's series is incredibly crucial for

Stanford. It is currently in a tie with UCLA for sec
ond in the Pac-10, four games behind Arizona
State. However, Washington State is just a game
behind the Cardinal and Bruins, so a slip-up this
weekend could mean a big fall in the conference
standings.
Giuliani believes that the Cardinal team under
stands the series' importance.

we could very well host a regional; and
if we don't play well, we could very
well not make a regional. And I think
the guys know that," Giuliani said.

For the Cardinal to succeed this
weekend, it will need good starts
from sophomores Brett Mooney
ham and Jordan Pries, who will pitch
on Friday and Saturday, respective
ly. Sophomore Brian Busick will
likely return to the rotation on Sun
day after working out of the bullpen
last weekend. Mooneyham, who has
been brilliant in his last three out

ings, will have the task of pitching
against the Cougars' ace, redshirt
junior Chad Arnold. Arnold is 4-2
with a 3.28 ERA on the year.
Action between the Cardinal and
