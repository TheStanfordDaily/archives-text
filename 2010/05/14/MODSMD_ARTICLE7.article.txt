After eight months of practice and
23 dual matches, the Stanford men's
tennis team (18-5) is preparing for the
NCAA Tournament. The No. 7 Cardi

for the first and second rounds.
Stanford was tabbed as the No. 8

The duo has amassed a 15-3 record in
dual matches.

Stanford has dominated the doubles
courts all year, losing the doubles point
