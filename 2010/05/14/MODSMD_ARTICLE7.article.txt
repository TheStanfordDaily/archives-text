# MEN'S TENNIS
## SERVING AT HOME 
### JACK DUANE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After eight months of practice and
23 dual matches, the Stanford men's
tennis team (18-5) is preparing for the
NCAA Tournament. The No. 7 Cardi
nal has been selected as one of 16 hosts
for the first and second rounds.
Stanford was tabbed as the No. 8
overall seed in the tournament and will
play Northeast Conference Tourna
ment champion Quinnipiac (10-4) on
Saturday at 12 p.m. in the first round.
If the Cardinal advances, it will play
the winner of Friday's other first-round
match between No. 21 Pepperdine and
No. 37 Hawaii.
Stanford struggled to win big
matches early in the season, suffering
close losses to upstart California and
traditional powerhouses USC and
Baylor.
But after junior Alex Clayton won a
clinching match in the third set to beat
UCLA in Los Angeles, the Cardinal
rattled off a seven-match winning
streak to finish tied with USC for the
Pac-10 championship.
Sophomore Bradley Klahn, who has
racked up a 14-5 record in dual match
es, will lead Stanford, as he has all sea
son. Klahn has also been selected to
play in the NCAA singles champi
onships as a 9-16 seed.
Klahn and fellow sophomore Ryan
Thacher, who have held the top nation
al ranking for parts of the year, are the
No. 2 team in the NCAA doubles draw.
The duo has amassed a 15-3 record in
dual matches.
"We're trying to take it one match at
a time," Klahn said. "At this point, it's
win or go home. You have to bring it
every match."
Stanford has dominated the doubles
courts all year, losing the doubles point
only three times. Much of this success
can be attributed to the consistent play
of freshmen Denis Lin and Matt Kan
dath.
"I feel like Denis and I have really
improved as a team," Kandath said.
"We're at a point where we are
starting to anticipate the other guy's
move."
Lin is likely to start in the singles
lineup this weekend. He has gone
12-3 since being inserted into the
lineup in the middle of the season.
A consistent bright spot for the
Cardinal has been the play of junior
Greg Hirshman, who has won all
but one of his 15 matches while
playing in the sixth singles spot. If
Stanford hopes to make a deep run
in the tournament, it will need more
of the same from Hirshman.
The Quinnipiac Bobcats earned
an automatic berth to the NCAA
Tournament after beating top seeds
Fairleigh Dickinson and Sacred
Heart in the Northeast Conference
Tournament.

The Cardinal has been inactive
since April 25, but head coach John
Whitlinger isn't worried that the
layoff will affect his team.
"It's been a long time since we've
played a match, and we're ready to
play," he said.
If Stanford survives Saturday, it
will face a ranked team with an
upset in mind.
No. 37 Hawaii (12-7) is making
its third consecutive trip to the
NCAA Tournament. The Rainbow
Warriors earned an automatic berth
into this year's tournament with a 4-
3 win over Fresno State in the West
ern Athletic Conference title
match.
No. 21 Pepperdine (16-10) would
present a formidable challenge in
the second round. The Waves went
undefeated in their WCC regular
season.
Pepperdine boasts an impressive
tennis history. The Waves have won
19 consecutive WCC titles and won
the NCAA title in 2006.
"It's all about survive and ad

vance," Whitlinger said. "In my
opinion, this is one of the best tour
naments out there. These are the
matches you are going to remember
for all your life."
Stanford will look to start a long

postseason run on Saturday at 12
p.m. against Quinnipiac at the
Taube Family Tennis Stadium.
