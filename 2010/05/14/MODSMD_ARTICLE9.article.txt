## SPEAKERS & EVENTS Newsom pitches oil tax at Stanford appearance 
### ELIZABETH TITUS MANAGING EDITOR 
San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom, a hopeful
candidate for lieutenant governor, said during a
stop at Stanford on Thursday that he thinks an oil
severance tax could be the solution to the cash
strapped public education system.
Fee hikes and budget cuts at public universities
caused widespread strain this year, including at
nearby UC-Berkeley, where students marched in
protest this spring.
In line with some state Democratic leaders,
Newsom told The Daily that he thinks "there are
many alternatives that avail ourselves today to
avoid the need to increase tuition ... including,
among many others, an oil severance tax that di
rectly can be advanced." He estimated that a tax on
oil drilling in California could bring in up to $6 bil
lion, "which should substantially address the
needs" of a $l2 billion higher education system.
California voters rejected a proposed oil sever
ance tax, Proposition 87, in 2006.
During his stop on Thursday, Newsom also
spoke about states' immigration laws in the wake
of a newly passed Arizona immigration law, regard
ed as the strictest in the nation. The city he governs
has "sanctuary" ordinances offering some protec
tions to undocumented immigrants.
"What is going to happen in the absence of fed
eral action is, we're going to have a patchwork of
state laws like Arizona and you're going to see
these other states unquestionably are going to be
doing similar things in the next number of months,"
Newsom said. "That's untenable."
Newsom also spoke about same-sex marriage,
the issue that elevated him to national prominence

in2oo4.He credited President Obama's opposition
to the "don't ask, don't tell" policy, but said the pres
ident has still "fallen very short" on the gay rights
agenda.
"That is immeasurably frustrating, and I don't
believe you run the 90-yard dash on equality,"
Newsom said. "I still think that our party, the De
mocratic Party, is willing to accept that some people
can be treated differently."
Newsom was at Stanford to speak privately to
the students in Political Science 37, "Justice and the
Obama Presidency," who pitched him questions for
40 minutes on topics including immigration, same
sex marriage and term limits in state government.
Newsom, 42, last spoke at Stanford in Novem
ber 2008 as students rallied to oppose Proposition
8, the ballot measure that would go on to constitu
tionally eliminate the right of same-sex couples to
marry in California. He is married to alumna Jen
nifer Siebel Newsom '96 M.B.A. 'Ol.
The mayor entered the race in April 2009 to suc
ceed Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, but
dropped out in October in the face of low poll num
bers and fundraising though not before attract
ing the support of a group of Stanford students,
whose organization today numbers about 100
members, according to its president, mechanical
engineering graduate student David Hoffert.
Newsom reentered the race in March as a can
didate for lieutenant governor. He faces Los Ange
les City Councilwoman Janice Hahn in the Demo
cratic primary; the winner will run against either
Lieutenant Governor Abel Maldonado (R-Santa
Maria) or state Senator Sam Aanestad (R-Grass
Valley).
