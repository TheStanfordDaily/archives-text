# FOUR CHINESE MASTERS: strokes of genius
## 
### JENNY THAI CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Bright colors splash along scrolls, depicting images
of swimming shrimp, scuttling crabs, bulging frogs
and crouching roosters. Lotuses and peonies
bloom serenely in meticulously drawn cauldrons.
A rushing stream of water flows between majestic
landscapes of mountains and lush forests.
These scenic paintings are part of a special exhibition at
the Cantor Arts Center: "Tracing the Past, Drawing the Fu
ture: Master Painters in 20th Century China." Initiated and
organized by Xiaoneng Yang, the Cantor Arts Center's cura
tor of Asian Art, the exhibition features over 110 works of art
from the "Four Great Masters of Ink Painting": Wu Chang
shuo (1844-1927), Qi Baishi (1864-1957), Huang Binhong
(1865-1955) and PanTianshou (1897-1971).
The opportunity to see so many of the four master
painters' pieces within the same gallery is one of the exhib
it's key attractions.
"Most of the works are the first time to be seen in the
U. 5.," Yang wrote in an e-mail to The Daily. "Actually, you
even cannot see so many masterpieces of these artists at a
single exhibition within China."
Together, the paintings of these four artists range from
the end of the Imperial Era to the founding of the Republic
to the Cultural Revolution. The paintings have a distinctive
aura of national pride and tumult.
"These paintings reflect the political struggles and the
economic changes of the time," said Richard Vinograd, pro
fessor of Asian art, whose role in the exhibition included
writing the introduction and several lead essays to the exhi
bition's catalog, as well as leading a team of students to assist
with the translation of some of the painting titles.
"In other words, they were trying to find away to utilize
the inheritance of the past to create an art form that was suit
able to the new nation's fate and to a new society that was
looking forward to a national future," he said.
The ink masters all started painting relatively late in their
lives in their sixties. They dedicated their lives to master
ing the arts of calligraphy and seal-carving before moving
onto painting. Their paintings reflect years of meticulous
study and keen observation.
lire artists' emphasis on detail is particularly evident in
their renditions of crustaceans.
"Qi Baishi spent years studying shrimp in a bowl," said
Judy Rino, one of Cantor Center's docents. "He didn't just
study their locomotion; he looked for that which animated
the shrimp the spirit of the shrimp."
It is this "spirit" that makes the paintings so lively. The
paintings are more than ink and color on paper they are a
blend of traditional ideals, rich storytelling and artistic exper
imentation. One painting in particular by Pan Tianshou de
picts two skulking vultures on a precipice, a drastic break
from the graceful harmony that is normally associated with
traditional Chinese landscape painting.
"The upside-down precipice that the vultures are perch
ing on gives off a feeling of instability," Rino said. "The paint
ing was actually confiscated by the Red Guard, because they
said it was a treacherous painting the birds represented
spies."
Other paintings show the evolution of the painters' styles,
to produce an effect that was simultaneously faithful to tra
ditional values, but also reflected an innovative look at real
ity.
"In traditional landscape paintings, there's a clear path
that connects the foreground with the mountains in the back
ground," Rino said. "However, in this painting [Discourse on
Heaven, Earth and Man], there's no path at all. It's hidden
and mysterious."
The emerging chaos among the paintings also reflects the

darker times of political struggle and cultural upheaval.
"I like the traditional style better," one of the tour guide
group members chimed when Rino asked her which style of
painting she preferred. "I like serenity."
Despite the somber nature of the paintings, they are still
an important legacy of China.
"It is an important episode in Chinese history and helps
fill out a broader and more complete picture of Chinese cul
ture from the modern era from the 20th Century and now on
into the 21th Century," Vinograd said.
The loan exhibition will be on display at the Cantor Arts
Center until its closing on July 4. Yang said the pieces will re
turn to China and be on display at the Shanghai Exhibition
Center after they leave Stanford.
