## Students to partake in BeWell 
### MARIANNE LeVINE 
Following last week's Student
Wellness Fair and the annual Cardi
nal Walk, the Stanford BeWell pro
gram is coming to students fall quar
ter in an attempt to promote healthy
lifestyles in the Stanford community.
The student "passport" program
will extend the BeWell program cur
rently offered to Stanford faculty.
The faculty BeWell program, estab
lished two years ago, has about a 50
percent participation rate.

Similar to the employee program,
the student program will consist of
three steps. The first step involves
taking a health appraisal survey,
which will help each student assess
his or her strengths and weaknesses
and then use the results to complete
the second step, the "personal well
ness plan."
After completing the wellness
plan, students may take the third
step, which is to get credit for com
pleting seven of 12 "Wellness Trip"
activities. These activities range from
attending wellness and health pro
motion talks to signing up for a ride
along night with the Stanford police.
"The premise for the program
came from the Provost," said Jen
nifer Sexton, the coordinator of
