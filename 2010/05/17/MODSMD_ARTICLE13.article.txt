## Students to partake in BeWell 
### MARIANNE LeVINE 
Following last week's Student
Wellness Fair and the annual Cardi
nal Walk, the Stanford BeWell pro
gram is coming to students fall quar
ter in an attempt to promote healthy
lifestyles in the Stanford community.
The student "passport" program
will extend the BeWell program cur
rently offered to Stanford faculty.
The faculty BeWell program, estab
lished two years ago, has about a 50
percent participation rate.

Similar to the employee program,
the student program will consist of
three steps. The first step involves
taking a health appraisal survey,
which will help each student assess
his or her strengths and weaknesses
and then use the results to complete
the second step, the "personal well
ness plan."
After completing the wellness
plan, students may take the third
step, which is to get credit for com
pleting seven of 12 "Wellness Trip"
activities. These activities range from
attending wellness and health pro
motion talks to signing up for a ride
along night with the Stanford police.
"The premise for the program
came from the Provost," said Jen
nifer Sexton, the coordinator of


BECCA DEL MONTE/The Stanford Daily
health and wellness programs.
"Wellness programs have existed
forever, but having a university set
ting is unique," she added.
Sexton said the main health is
sues the program plans to focus on
for students include relationships,
eating habits, sleep, physical exer
cise and alcohol intake.
"We hope people become self
motivated to make a positive
change in their lifestyles," Sexton
said.
She said she often sees students
trying to do homework while at the
gym. A goal of the BeWell program,
she said, is to reframe exercise as a
de-stressor and encourage students
to use their time at the gym as a
break.
The BeWell program has
launched two main events this quar
ter to help promote awareness
the Student Wellness Fair and the
Cardinal Walk, which, for the first
time this year, was open to students.
The fair, according to Sexton, at
tracted around 400 students, as well
as numerous passers-by. The pro
gram has tried to increase aware
ness through peer health educators,
resident assistants and e-mail lists.
However, Sexton said, the program
is primarily dependent on word of
mouth to promote participation.
She said she hopes to have half of
Stanford's 6,878 undergraduates
participate in the new program.
