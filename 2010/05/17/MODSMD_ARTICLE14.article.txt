## THE
						GAO REPORT Restructuring Undergraduate Education 
### Shelley Gao 
The Study on Undergraduate Education
at Stanford (SUES) held a town hall
last Wednesday to solicit student per
spectives regarding the undergraduate cur
riculum. The last curriculum redesign oc
curred 15 years ago in 1994 through the Com
mission on Undergraduate Education.
Charged with redefining the goals for a Stan
ford education in an era of globalization and
with providing suggestions on how these ob
jectives can be reflected in the undergradu
ate requirements, SUES has the potential to
dramatically alter the future Stanford experi
ence. Although the composition of SUES,
particularly the selection of its two student
members, should have been conducted more
transparently, the taskforce appears to be
making efforts to incorporate broader input
in its decision-making process.
The driving concern of SUES should be
looking at how to prepare Stanford under
graduates to navigate an increasingly com
plex and interconnected world. Stanford is
uniquely positioned with its entrepreneurial
culture, excellence across a breadth of disci
plines and interdisciplinary approaches to
produce the next generation of global lead
ers. The purpose of General Education Re
quirements (GERs) is to help undergradu
ates early in their careers attain the founda
tion necessary for advancing to further stud
ies and research. More importantly, the ra
tionale for undergraduate requirements is
philosophical. They should aim to expose stu
dents to different modes of inquiry and help
them engage in independent thinking and
perceive the commonalities among human
experiences. The challenge lies in striking the
balance between providing some kind of
guidance while offering students the free
dom to explore resources at their disposal.
There are many core concerns that SUES
should examine. For example, the need to
continue expanding the availability and vari
ety of small size Freshman and Sophomore
seminars, expanding the number of tenure
track faculty members serving as pre-major
advisors, bridging the "divide" between hu
manities and sciences through an emphasis
on interdisciplinary opportunities and trans
lating intellectual pursuits into residential
education. Flowever, the priority should be a
radical restructuring of Area One of GERs,
namely the Introduction to Humanities
(IHUM) and Program in Writing and
Rhetoric (PWR). Although the experience
among upperclassmen varies greatly, the cur
rent structure is mostly perceived as an un
necessary constraint on disciplinary explo
ration and an undue burden on freshmen al
ready facing the difficulty of finding their in
tellectual niche.

Student advisory boards formed to facili
tate communication between stakeholders
and represent student opinion have frankly
only initiated cosmetic changes. The structur
al and substantive nature of the program re
mains unaltered. In terms of IHUM, SUES
should undertake comprehensive investiga
tions of alternative humanities educational
frameworks in our peer institutions. One ex
ample would be the "Great Books" program
at the University of Chicago. Another is the
"Core Curriculum" at Columbia University.
If Stanford is going to have a humanities re
quirement, then it should be authentic and
rigorous. The present Structured Liberal Ed
ucation (SLE) that most closely mirrors the
traditional humanities immersion is only ac
cessible to a limited number of incoming
freshmen. As the future political, economic
and cultural elite, we need to be familiar with

Western Civilization and the survey of classic
works in Western literature and philosophy
that have stood the test of time. Despite inter
nationalization, the canon of "dead white
men" is still relevant. It allows us to under
stand where we have come from, and if we
disagree, exactly what we are reacting against.
The prospect for fundamental restructur
ing and return to the Western liberal arts tra
dition is rather bleak. While some of the cri
tiques on higher education made by Allan
Bloom in "The Closing of the American
Mind" can still be applied to contemporary
academia, social and political pressures in ad
dition to institutional constraints restrict the
capacity for reform. SUES will probably en
dorse the status quo, producing a report that
outlines the advantages and disadvantages to
the current system and provides a series of
options with cost-benefit analysis attached.
The final recommendation will most likely
be to improve the existing IHUM format in
some way, whether it is to increase the course
offerings or the possibility of having multiple
faculty members teaching the same class to
cultivate more sense of shared experience in
the humanities among the freshmen. What
ever the policy recommendation may be,
SUES needs to think carefully about how to
best explain the rationale for the existence of
undergraduate requirements and convince
students of their value.

The undergraduate writing program
needs to become a more value-adding expe
rience. Revision of the mechanics of compo
sition and oral presentation on a generic
basis is rather limiting. It would be more
compelling if departments develop a more
comprehensive writing program in addition
to the current Writing in the Major (WIM)
that cater specifically to the needs of the dis
cipline.

Curriculum change is difficult. There are
many conflicting priorities, voices and inter
ests. The establishment of SUES is the first
step toward ensuring the continued evolu
tion and strength of undergraduate educa
tion at Stanford.
