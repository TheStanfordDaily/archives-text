## LATE COLLAPSE Cardinal drops final two games of series to WSU 
### DANIEL BOHM SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The No. 25 Stanford baseball team (27-20,11-
10 Pac-10) lost two of three to visiting Washing
ton State (28-18,11-10) this weekend in a topsy
turvy series that saw lots of lead changes and late
rallies.

After a come-from-behind win on Friday,
Stanford was unable to take the series over the
weekend.

The Cardinal lost the rubber game Sunday 9-
3 after leading 3-2 entering the ninth inning. The
Cougars tagged Cardinal closer Alex Pracher (6-
4), a junior, for seven runs in the inning
though only two were earned to end the roller
coaster series.

Stanford jumped out to a 3-0 lead early in the
game behind solo homers from freshman first
baseman Stephen Piscotty who was 3-4 in the
game with two runs scored and freshman
right fielder Tyler Gaffney.
The lead would not last, however, as the
Cougars got two runs in the top of the sixth off
freshman Dean McArdle, who was making the
first weekend start of his career, on senior first
baseman Michael Weber's first of two home runs
for the day. Weber would add a grand slam in the
ninth off Pracher to bust the game open for
Washington State.
McArdle was solid, going 5.2 innings and al
lowing just the two runs on three hits while strik
ing out six. He would not get the win, however, as
the Cougars strung together five hits, including
Weber's grand slam, and were aided by an error
by Stanford's junior second baseman Colin
Walsh in the seven-run ninth.

While the Cardinal blew a game on Sunday, it
stole one from the Cougars on Friday night.
Trailing 7-3 entering the bottom of the eighth,
the Cardinal rallied for five runs to take the lead.
Walks to Walsh and Piscotty put two on before
freshman third baseman Kenny Diekroeger ex
tended his hitting streak to 18 games (it is now at
20) with a two-RBI triple. Junior shortstop Jake
Schlander followed with an RBI single. Two bat
ters later, junior pinch hitter Ben Clowe singled
and was followed by another pinch hitter, Eric
Smith, who laced a line drive to left field for the
game-tying base hit. With the bases loaded,
Gaffney bounced a ball to second base, but
Washington State junior Cody Bartlett rushed
his throw and it got by Weber at first, allowing
Schlander to score and give the Cardinal the lead
for good.
Freshman Sahil Bloom (1-0), who threw just
two pitches to get a 1-6-3 double play in the top
of the eighth, earned the win.
Pracher pitched the ninth for his third save of
the season. The ninth was not without excite
ment, as WSU senior designated hitter Matt
Fanelli doubled with one out but was thrown out
at second base by Schlander after taking too big
of a turn around the base. Piscotty did a great job
of trailing the runner from first base and applied
the tag. Washington State head coach Donnie
Marbut did not agree with the call and sprinted
onto the field and got in a heated argument with
first base umpire Jeff Patterson before being
ejected.

Unfortunately for the Cardinal, Friday's mo
mentum didn't carry into Saturday, as the Cardi
nal dropped the middle game of the series 4-2. Ju
nior James Wise (2-1) stifled Stanford with eight

innings of shutout ball, striking out eight and al
lowing just four hits.
The Cardinal again made it interesting late in
the game, however. A sacrifice fly by Diekroeger
and an RBI single by Schlander pulled Stanford
to within 4-2 with just one out in the inning and

the bases loaded. However, sophomore Adam
Conley was able to get senior pinch hitter Adam
Gaylord to hit into a 4-6-3 double play to end the
threat, giving Conley his 10th save of the season.

Sophomore Brian Bussick winds up to pitch this weekend in the Cardinal's series against Washington
State. Stanford won the first game of the series, but WSU evened things up on Saturday with a 4-2 win.
In the rubber match on Sunday, the Cardinal blew a 3-2 lead in the ninth inning to lose the series.
Sophomore Jordan Pries (3-3)
got the loss for the Cardinal, going
5.2 innings and allowing four runs
(three earned) on seven hits and
five walks. The Cardinal bullpen
was brilliant, however, as three Car
dinal relievers combined to go 3.1
innings, allowing just one hit and
striking out five.
The Cardinal now sits in a three
way tie for third place in the Pac-10
Conference with two series remain
ing. Next week, the Cardinal plays at
the University of Arizona, but not
before hosting Hawaii for a single
game on Tuesday.
