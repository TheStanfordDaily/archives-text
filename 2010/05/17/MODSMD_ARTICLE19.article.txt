## Card dominates in NCAAs Stanford sweeps through first two rounds of play 
### WILL SEATON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Using home-court advantage to the fullest, the
No. 8 Stanford women's tennis team breezed
through the first two rounds of the NCAA Tour
nament by posting consecutive shutout victories
over Fairfield and No. 31 SMU at Taube Family
Tennis Stadium.
The two wins mean Stanford must now hit the
road to travel to Athens, Ga. for the round of 16.
On top of that, the win keeps Stanford's home
winning streak intact until 2011, as it will not host
another home match until then. Stanford has won
164 consecutive home matches â€”32 in the
NCAA Tournament dating back to Feb. 27,
1999.The streak spans three separate decades and
is recognized as the longest home winning streak
of any Division-I sport.
"This being my fourth year, I've never felt this
good about our matches and our team," said sen
ior Lindsay Burdette. "Not just excited about us
hitting the ball, but us emotionally, physically, as a
team. It's not a guarantee statement, but I have all
the confidence in the world going forward, and it
feels great."
Going into this tournament healthy has played

a big part in how the team is facing up to the pres
sure of post-season play.
"In years past, the biggest difference has been
that our bodies started to break down," Lindsay
Burdette said. "We had a few injuries at the end of
the seasons that made it all a little tougher to do,
but thus far, everyone seems to be healthy and
happy."
In the first round, Fairfield could muster no de
fense to Stanford's blistering offense. The Cardi
nal captured the doubles point for the 21st time in
22 matches this season. The nation's second
ranked duo of Stanford's Hilary Barte and Lind
say Burdette won 8-0 to put the Cardinal on top in
doubles. Stanford's No. 3 doubles team of Veroni
ca Li and Carolyn McVeigh followed up with an 8-
2 victory to secure the doubles point.
In singles, Fairfield couldn't win a single game
before the match was over. Li finished first at the
six spot with a 6-0, 6-0 victory over Fairfield's
Gretchen Amberg. Next, No. 4 national seed
Barte defeated Dana Postupack 6-0,6-0 in the No.
1 spot to put Stanford up 3-0. Finally, McVeigh fin
ished off the sweep with an identical 6-0,6-0 score
against Alyssa Ruiz to put Stanford into the sec
ond round.

"They were definitely one of the better first
round teams we've faced in a while, despite the
score," Lindsay Burdette said. "I remember the
first round being almost frustrating because it's so
ugly, but [Fairfield] made us put the ball away.
They weren't really giving us anything."
The second round provided another clean
sweep, but with a little more fight courtesy of
SMU. Capturing the doubles point for the 22nd

time this season, Stanford started off right with an
8-2 victory by No. 58 Mallory Burdette and Stacey
Tan. Then, the Cardinal's top team of Barte and
Lindsay Burdette closed it out with an 8-4 win.
In singles, Stanford received points from two of
the same players as last time. Li finished first again
with a quick 6-2, 6-1 victory over SMU's Sophie
Quist. Barte was next with a 6-0,6-4 polishing of
No. 28 Marta Lesniak. Finally, No. 33 Mallory Bur
dette defeated Katerina Vankova 6-4,7-5 for a sec
ond sweep in as many days.
