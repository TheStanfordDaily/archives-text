# LeBron's new home
## 
### Daniel Bohm 
very sportswriter in the
country feels compelled to
write about LeBron James
and where he will sign now
that he is a free agent. It's
kind of like the Tim Tebow effect, or the
Brett Favre saga, or the Barry Bonds did
steroids thing â€” it just feels like it needs
to be written. So here I am, like all of
those sportswriters, with very little idea
where James will end up, but still about
to put in my two cents in the form of this
700-word column.
Prior to the playoffs, I would have

said without a doubt that James was
staying in Cleveland. He had to. It was
his hometown, the Cavaliers had finally
invested in some other parts like
Antawn Jamison and Shaquille O'Neal
to supplement James and the Cavs were
likely the best team in the league. How
ever, now that James' Cavaliers (we can
still say they are his Cavaliers for now)
were bounced early by Boston, every
thing has changed.
So where could James go? There are

eight teams that have the salary cap
space to sign King James. New York,
New Jersey, Miami, Chicago, Min
nesota, Sacramento, Washington and
the Los Angeles Clippers not to
mention, of course, the Cavs. There
are also a few teams like Dallas and
Houston that could theoretically af
ford James through a sign and trade,
but that is unlikely.

No offense to Minnesota or Sacra
mento, but James isn't coming your
way. Why? Because they are Min
nesota and Sacramento.

Similarly, the Clippers can be prob
ably be ruled out because they are the
Clippers, and they are so horribly mis
managed (I'm looking at you, Donald
Sterling) and unlucky that if James did
sign there, he would probably be diag
nosed with some incurable disease
within days and never play basketball
again.

Washington and New Jersey are
probably out of the picture because
they are terrible, although if the Nets
get the first overall pick in the draft,
James surrounded by John Wall and

Brook Lopez looks pretty good. Fur
thermore, the Nets are moving to
Brooklyn in two years, which is infi
nitely cooler than North Jersey, and
they have the whole Jay-Z connection.
That said, I don't see James in one of
those tacky Nets uniforms next year.
Miami is probably out as well, as it
is focused on resigning Dwyane Wade.
So focused that the organization
launched www.wewantwade.com last
week to try and keep the star around.
Wade, however, was very frustrated
with the lack of talent around him this
year in Miami, so even if he doesn't re
sign, it is doubtful that James would
want to go to that situation.
That leaves New York, Chicago
and Cleveland.
New York should be eliminated for
the same reason as Washington and
New Jersey the Knicks are very, very
bad but I'm leaving them around
because it is New York, and James
could make an ungodly amount of
money there and be the biggest star on
the biggest stage. Furthermore, the
Knicks have enough cap space to sign
two max contract free agents, so it could
be James and Amare Stoudemire,
James and Joe Johnson or James and
Chris Bosh in orange and blue.
Then there is Chicago. All things
being equal, Chicago probably makes

the most sense. It's a big city, the Bulls
are a team that already has some good
parts like Derrick Rose and Joakim
Noah and they have a loyal fan base.
But all things aren't equal. There was
some guy named Michael Jordan who
played in Chicago, and no matter how
great James is, he will never be MJ. Le-
Bron wants to be a legend, and I don't
see him walking by the Jordan statue
outside the United Center every day
and always living in his shadow. Le-
Bron needs to be the star on his stage,
not Jordan's.
So that leaves Cleveland. I think
the Cavs still have to be seen as the fa
vorite to land James, only slightly
ahead of New York, which in turn is
slightly ahead of Chicago. As frustrat
ed as James may be with the Cavs or
ganization and head coach Mike
Brown (who will likely be fired before
next season), it is where he is from,
and he probably is closer to a title
there than he is in New York.

Now I will leave you with some ar
bitrary odds for each team signing the
King: Cleveland 2-to-l, New York 4-
to-1, Chicago 6-to-l, New Jersey 10-
to-1 and Miami 15-to-l.
