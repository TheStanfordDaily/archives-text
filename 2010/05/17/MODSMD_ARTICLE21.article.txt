## Stanford makes it to NCAA round of 16 
### MICHAEL LAZARUS STAFF WRITER 
The No. 7 Stanford men's tennis
team is looking like a championship
team.
With a 4-0 victory over No. 21 Pep
perdine on Sunday at the Taube Fami
ly Tennis Stadium, the Cardinal ad
vanced to the round of 16 in the
NCAA Tournament.

Hosting a regional for the second
straight year, Stanford made the most
of its opportunity. Freshmen Matt
Kandath and Denis Lin got the Cardi
nal off to a strong start with a dominat
ing 8-2 doubles victory.
The sophomore team of Bradley
Klahn and Ryan Thacher and the No.
2 team of junior Alex Clayton and sen
ior Richard Wire each were in a tight
battle. Tied 5-5, Klahn and Thacher
held serve to go up 6-s.The two lefties
then broke Pepperdine, and Klahn
held serve to win the clinching eighth
game to give Stanford the early dou
bles point.
On the singles side, Klahn and Wire
kept the momentum going.
Wire, playing his last home match
at Stanford, had a day to remember.
The senior, who claims he is playing his
best tennis of the year, was nearly in
fallible on the court, winning easily 6-
2,6-4 over Alex Llompart.
"It gave me extra motivation,"Wire

said. "Obviously, I wanted to finish on
a high note, but the main focus was still
the team and the NCAAs."
A few minutes after Wire closed
out his match, Klahn finished his, de
feating Bassam Beidas 6-2, 6-1. With
most of the fans centered around court
one, Klahn benefited from the crowd
noise that affected Beidas. Nearly
every side change, Beidas would say
something to the umpire about the
crowd talking to him.
"The crowd definitely helped me
out today," Klahn said.
Leading 3-0 with four singles
matches left, Stanford needed just one
more victory. Thacher, Clayton and
junior Greg Hirshman all won their
first sets, but it was Hirshman who fin
ished first to provide the clincher, 6-4,
6-4.

To advance to Sunday, Stanford
needed to defeat Quinnipiac on Satur
day in the first round of the tourna
ment. Considering most of the Cardi
nal players probably couldn't name
the state Quinnipiac is in (Connecti
cut), Stanford wasn't too worried.
The Cardinal routed the Bobcats 4-
0 in less than two hours, extending its
winning streak to eight. No Cardinal
player lost a set, and Klahn didn't even
lose a game, winning 6-0,6-0. Clayton
was close to perfection as well, win
ning 6-0,6-1. Wire provided the clinch
er in the No. 5 singles spot with a 6-2,6-
4 victory.
Next up for the Cardinal is a trip to
Athens, Ga. for the round of 16. Stan
ford will face UCLA at 9 a.m. this Fri
day. The Cardinal defeated the Bruins
4-3 on April 3 in Los Angeles, the only
