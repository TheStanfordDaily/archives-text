## English major to get 'historic' changes Major to require three-quarter core, more units 
### CAITY MONROE STAFF WRITER 
After months of faculty discussion
and student feedback, Stanford's Eng
lish department has revamped its cur
riculum for English majors.
One of the most notable features of
student responses contributed to the
creation of a new team-taught, three
quarter-long course that is expected to
provide students with a historical narra
tive of English literature since the mid
dle ages. It is the biggest requirement
change to the major.
"One thing students told us was that
they were not satisfied with the depth of
their historical knowledge . . . they
wanted a big perspective on English lit
erary history, and they weren't getting it
from the old requirements," said Jen
nifer Summit, the chair of the depart
ment.
The relevance of history to literary
study has been a subject of debate with
in the discipline for decades.
In all, the new major will require
three methodology courses, six empha
sis electives, four historical courses
three of which will be fulfilled by the
core and one senior seminar, in
which students will work closely with a
faculty member on that professor's re
search interests.
English major Katie Hanigan 'l2 is
happy with the changes, saying the type
of background knowledge afforded by
the new curriculum is conducive to
forming a greater appreciation for the
works.
"In my T.S. Eliot class, the teacher in
cludes a lot of history in her lectures, and
in a lot of ways, it makes the poetry and
novels more accessible," she said. "If
you don't know the historical back
ground of something, it can be hard to
decipher what's happening or what
the author is trying to argue," Hani
gan said.
Faculty also examined the sur
veys and transcripts of recent gradu
ates and learned that most English
majors took more than the 12 re
quired courses to complete the
major an indication that more
units could be required, said
Nicholas Jenkins, an English profes
sor who teaches "Poetry and Poet
ics," a part of the new core.
The new English major will
therefore require 14 courses. Al
though the new core will provide
more structure to the curriculum,
the expansion of the major will si
multaneously increase opportuni
ties for elective courses within the
major.

Specialist Katie Dooling said that
the department is eager to help stu
dents plan their academic path.
"I would say the core would be
ideal for a sophomore, but it really
can be taken at any time," Dooling
said. "We're going to be flexible
about it. We understand students go
abroad, and not everybody knows
what their major will be at the begin
ning of sophomore year."
The changes have generated ex
citement among faculty.
"Obviously, we're hoping that it's
exciting for the students .. that's
why we're doing it," Jenkins said.
"But it's exciting for us too. Any
time you do something new, there's
a surge of energy ... we're doing
things in the department that we've
never done before."
Summit, who said she has had in
vitations from around the country to
talk about Stanford's efforts and re
cently published an article on the
initiative, echoed the enthusiasm.
"You look across our faculty, and
these are the leaders in the disci
pline," Summit said. "We wanted to
bring the intellectual energy of what
our faculty are doing in the profes
sion to undergraduates."
