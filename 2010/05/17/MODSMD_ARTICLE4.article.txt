## Manager's death unexpected 
### ERIC DUNN JOSHUA FALK 
Kim Hess, the manager of Late Nite at Lagunita, died
suddenly at home on Saturday. He was 58 years old.
He had managed the late-night kitchen at Lagunita

Dining for seven years, from 7 p.m. to 2
a.m. Sunday through Thursday, and was
respected by his colleagues and
beloved by the students he served.
"He told me, 'The reason I come
here is the students. It begins and ends
with these kids,'" said Jose Flores, a col
league of Hess's at Late Nite, where
Flores was managing operations on
Sunday evening.

In a statement released by Stanford
Dining, Executive Director Eric Montell wrote, "Hess
was an incredible person and will be greatly missed. I am
deeply saddened by our loss." Dining announced Hess's
death in a Facebook note, where a list of condolence
messages from students grew.
According to Dining, Hess apparently died of a heart
attack.
Students in the dining hall offered their memories of
the west campus figure and were adding messages to a
public bulletin board past midnight on Monday.
"One night, I asked if I could get some chocolate chip
pancakes," recalled Erin Lence 'l3. "Not only did he say
okay, but he ran back to make them."
"I came to Kim this year with an idea to add a dish to
the Late Nite menu," said Brett Ostrander, a junior from
Edwardsville, 111. "It was a unique item from my home
town. Within a week or two, it was on the menu and has
been there since."
Not only did Hess tailor the menu to students' re

quests, but he also took an interest in the lives of diners.
"Going there was like going to your dinner table at
home," said Eliza Richartz 'l3. "He cared about the food
that he offered us."
"Food is his passion," said Julian Gropp 'll.
Gropp, a student from Germany, said he and Hess
would bond over their German heritage. Hess would
often greet Gropp in his basic German.
Hess served in the army, he told students, and learned
several recipes during his stint.
"When he went to Korea, he learned some of the
dishes," including Korean short ribs, said JooHee Ahn
' 11. "I'm Korean, so he had me try it, and I told him it was
authentic," Ahn said. "He was really proud of that. It was
authentic."
"Same for the sausage," Gropp added. "It was pretty
authentic as well."
"He was the face of Late Nite," said Dorothy Pan 'lO.
Staff on west campus echoed students' feelings.
"I think we're all in a little bit of shock," said Kate
Chesley, a resident fellow in Roble Hall. "He just
thought the world of the students here."
Chesley said Hess often watched the Food Network
to get ideas for recipes.
"He made excellence look easy," said Ujamaa Resi
dent Fellow Jan Barker-Alexander. "This wasn't just a
job for him."
Hess, a resident of San Jose, is survived by five chil
dren and 10 grandchildren, according to his daughter,
Michele Hess.
Details of a memorial service are forthcoming, ac
cording to Stanford Dining.
