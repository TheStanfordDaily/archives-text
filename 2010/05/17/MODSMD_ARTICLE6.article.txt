### CLAUDIA LOPEZ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Cardinal went to San Diego
State's Aztec Aquaplex this weekend to
compete in the NCAA Tournament with
high hopes and the No. 1 seed. However,
the weekend didn't end as planned for
Stanford, as it fell 10-9 to No. 2 USC in the
championship game last night.
Stanford began the weekend Friday af
ternoon with a blowout win over

Pomona-Pitzer. It started the first period

with an impressive 7-
0 lead, sending a
clear message that
the Card meant busi
ness, especially after
its loss to UCLA two
weeks ago.
By the end of the
second period, the

Cardinal was ahead 21-2, with the end re
sult determined before the game had
even ended.
The final score was 23-3; it was a brutal

defeat for Pomona, and several Cardinal
players shined in the win.
Freshman goalkeeper Kate Baldoni
had a total of five saves. Sophomore two
meter offense Alex Koran and sopho
more two-meter offense Melissa Seide
mann each smashed four goals into the
goal. Freshman two-meter offense Anni
ka Dries, sophomore driver Alyssa Lo,
junior driver Kim Krueger, sophomore
