# CHAMPIONSHIP WOES
## STANFORD FALLS IN NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP 
### CLAUDIA LOPEZ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Cardinal went to San Diego
State's Aztec Aquaplex this weekend to
compete in the NCAA Tournament with
high hopes and the No. 1 seed. However,
the weekend didn't end as planned for
Stanford, as it fell 10-9 to No. 2 USC in the
championship game last night.
Stanford began the weekend Friday af
ternoon with a blowout win over

Pomona-Pitzer. It started the first period

with an impressive 7-
0 lead, sending a
clear message that
the Card meant busi
ness, especially after
its loss to UCLA two
weeks ago.
By the end of the
second period, the

Cardinal was ahead 21-2, with the end re
sult determined before the game had
even ended.
The final score was 23-3; it was a brutal

defeat for Pomona, and several Cardinal
players shined in the win.

had a total of five saves. Sophomore two
meter offense Alex Koran and sopho

Senior driver Kelly Eaton fends off a Cal player in Stanford's 8-7 regular season win over the Bears. The Cardinal beat Cal again in
the semifinals of the NCAA Tournament, but came up short against USC in the national championship, despite Eaton's four goals.

Kelsey Holshouser each skipped in
two goals. Sophomore driver Cassie
Churnside, freshman driver Vee
Dunlevie and freshman driver Jil
lian Garton each scored a single
goal.
After dominating its match on
Friday, the Cardinal continued the
tournament by facing off against
rival California on Saturday.
The Cardinal led the Golden
Bears by one after the first period,
but by halftime, both teams were
tied at three.
Stanford put its foot down during
the third and fourth periods, not let
ting Cal score a single point, for a
final score of 6-3.
Junior goalkeeper Amber Oland
saved an incredible 12 shots
throughout the match. Seidemann
smashed in two goals of her own,
while Churnside, Koran, Krueger
and Menon each tacked on an addi
tional goal.
Saturday's win advanced Stan
ford to the NCAA championship
game yesterday, where it met USC, a
team that it had already triumphed
over twice this season.
Early in the season at the Stan
ford Invitational, the Cardinal was
victorious against USC with a 10-7
win. Later that month, the Cardinal
faced off with the Trojans once more
at the Irvine Invitational and lost 10-
6. In late April, the Cardinal earned
its top spot back by stealing a win
against USC with a final score of 7-6.
Now, the Cardinal and Trojans
faced off again, this time for the Na
tional Collegiate Women's Water
Polo Championship.
The Cardinal got off to a slow
start in the match, ending the second
period with only three points, while
the Trojans led with six. The next
half of the match, however, the Car
dinal stepped up its game, barely
trailing behind USC as the Cardinal
scored a total of six points during the
last two periods.
Stanford looked to be out of con
tention when the Trojans had a 10-6
lead with less than three minutes re
maining. The Cardinal responded
with three goals in 96 seconds to put
the pressure on USC.
In the final 10 seconds of the
game, Dries missed a shot in Stan
ford's last chance to tie, leaving the
score at 10-9.
Senior driver Kelly Eaton led the
Cardinal with four goals, all on
penalties. Krueger had two goals,
while Churnside, Dries and Lo each
skipped in a single goal, as well. Fur
thermore, Oland had a total of seven
saves throughout the match.
Stanford came remarkably close
to pulling even, as Seidemann had
three shots hit the post, but the Car
dinal had to settle for second. This is
the fifth time in the 10-year history
of NCAA women's water polo that
Stanford has been the national run
ner-up.
