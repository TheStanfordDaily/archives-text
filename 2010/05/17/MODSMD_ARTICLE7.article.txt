## Vaden to offer free Hep B screenings Screenings will kick off Hepatitis B Awareness Week 
### THOMAS YEH STAFF WRITER 
Vaden Health Center is offering Stanford
students free Hepatitis B screening tests start
ing Monday.
The free screenings mark the inauguration
of Hepatitis B Awareness Week, a four-day ed
ucational campaign hosted by Team HBV, an
international outreach group dedicated to rais
ing awareness of Hepatitis B and liver cancer.
Joy Zhang 'lO, the president and founder of
the newly created Stanford chapter of Team
HBV, interned at the Stanford Asian Liver
Center her sophomore year. She said her expe
rience made her realize that, like her, many po
tentially at-risk students were not fully aware
of their circumstances and were probably not
getting screened.
"A lot of people think that they are protect
ed ... when they're not," Zhang said. "The
most common way to get Hepatitis B is at birth
from mother to child, but it often doesn't pro
duce symptoms, so the spreading goes unrec
ognized."
The number of students at risk for Hepati
tis B is difficult to quantify, said Dr. RobynTep
per, the director of medical services at Vaden.
"There is no way to know how many stu
dents are affected," Tepper said. "The goal here
is to encourage those who may be at risk, to be
screened."

"The idea here is to be proactive about ed
ucating those who are at risk, who may not be
aware that the risk exists for them," Tepper
added. "This includes students who were born
in Asia, the Pacific Islands, Eastern Europe,
Africa or the Middle East, or if their
parents were born in those coun
tries."

In conjunction with Team HBV's
involvement in hosting multiple
events on campus to promote aware
ness of the disease, Dr. Stephanie
Chao 'O2 of the Stanford Asian Liver

Center initiated contact with Vaden
to develop an improved system that
determines which students fall into
high-risk groups and should be test
ed.

"I approached Vaden to see how
we could collaborate to get more stu
dents screened through Vaden,"
Chao said. "We hope that after the
awareness week, students will be mo
tivated to protect their health by get
ting tested and vaccinated for He
patitis B, if they haven't already."
Tepper helped create the new sys

tern by making use of electronic med
ical record software to build the new
screening tool. The end result was an
automated computer system that can
take Stanford students through a
step-by-step online evaluation.
"The idea is that students can go
online at their own convenience and
answer a series of questions that will
help determine if they are at high risk
for Hepatitis B," Tepper said. "If at
any point their answer puts them in a
high risk group, they will be offered
an appointment to go to the Vaden

lab for a blood test."
According to Tepper, Vaden typi
cally does not charge for such screen
ings, and the Web tool can be left up
on an ongoing basis so that students
can access it at any time.
Students who are not in the high
risk group are still offered appoint
ments for vaccination as needed.
For Chao, it is a step in the right di
rection toward educating students
about an issue that directly impacts
their own well-being.
"I was also a student at Stanford

once," Chao said. "And I remember
that as an undergrad, I was mostly
concerned with midterms, finals, ca-
D reer... it's easy to take one's health
s for granted when you're young."
"This is a disease that we can erad
icate globally," she added, "and I ap
plaud Stanford's Team HBV for
working to raise awareness among
the Stanford community to bring us
s one step closer to our goal."
