## LIFE EXOTIC Semi â€“ clad Stanford 
### STEPHANIE SARA CHONG STAFF WRITER 
For a mid-May evening, the air was unexpectedly chilly. And yet,partygo
ers were surprisingly... naked.That's the nature of Exotic Erotic: a slight
ly sexy, moderately disturbing and downright grimy excuse for public nu
dity. The theme this year was "Exotic Aquatic," adding to past themes such
as "Adam and Eve," "Rave" and "Cirque d'Exotique." Elosted by 680
Lomita (a.k.a. "680"), this infamous Stanford tradition once graced Playboy's top
-10 campus parties list.
"I think Exotic is such a popular event because it's an opportunity for students
to let loose and a party to brag to friends at other schools about," wrote Taylor Du
rand 'lO, a 680 resident and the main organizer for the event, in an e-mail to The
Daily. "Kind of like FMOTQ [Full Moon on the Quad]."
Although Exotic Erotic means letting loose for students, the flipside is an in
crease in security measures.This is because Exotic Erotic tends to attract high num
bers of non-Stanford party guests both older and younger. This year, the resi
dents of 680 spent over $lO,OOO on security alone.
Dozens of police were already in place two hours before the 10 p.m. start time.
Barricades surrounded all of 680, as well as neighboring fraternities Sigma Alpha
Epsilon andTheta Delta Chi. The barricades at the party's entrance wound around
in a labyrinth maze, akin to the long lines at airport security.
"As Dorothy said, just follow the yellow brick road," shouted an on-duty police
man to the first guests, who had been trying to jump over one barricade to the next.
At 10 p.m., the first real guests arrived right on time. Eager to show off their or
ange polka-dotted swim trunks and navy striped bikinis, they flashed their IDs and
tickets to security and gleefully pranced into the house.
Not everyone was happy to have arrived so early, especially the under-21-year
olds craving liquid courage.
"This sucks," groaned a freshman. "This is 680. There's supposed to be alcohol
everywhere."
His friend, boasting a glass-half-full perspective, said, "I'm just going to take a
bunch of these Red 8u11... because they're free."
Costumes ranged from slutty to cute to bizarre. Although swimsuits seemed to
make the most sense the only Exotic Erotic rule mandates one article of cloth
ing for guys and two for girls there were also a couple of sushi chefs, a guy
dressed like Zorro and a 680 resident acting as mayor of the lost underwater city
Atlantis.

Some took the rule literally, but stayed conservative by choosing to I
wear onesies or bathrobes.
"Are you really only wearing one article of clothing?" asked a girl
to a guy she had just met, who was wearing a long, dark red robe. V
"Want to find out?" came the smug reply.
By midnight, the dance floors had reached the point of being uncom
fortably full. Dancers grinded against not only their partners' naked tor
sos, but also with random strangers. It was impossible not to dance
even if you weren't dancing, the movement of the crowd was moving you
anyway.
Although most stuck close to their designated friend groups, some
took advantage of the boldness of the night's theme.
"That's my teacher's daughter over there against the wall. I'll give you
20 bucks to dance with her," a half-naked guy dared his wingman. "Wait,
n0... a hundred."

"Uh
"A million to hook up with
her!" /
Outside, dozens of students I
waited in line to get into the already overly
crowded house. Practically stacked on top of
one another, they huddled together so as to bet
ter bear the ever-increasing cold. Toward the en
of the night, the line to enter the party took
almost 20 minutes. D
"They're calling it the Trail of Tears,"
joked an observer.
Those lucky enough to make it inside got to
witness this one-of-a-kind party of half-naked
and a handful of fully naked peers. But at
1 a.m. sharp, Exotic Erotic came to an end. Guest:
shivered their way home from 680, leaving be
hind careless beer spills, ocean-themed wall |
decorations ... and even the occasional
left-behind garment of underwear.
