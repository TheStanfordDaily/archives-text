## C3Nano takes home $200,000 cash grant Stanford's student start-up wins M.I.T competition 
### CRISTIANA GIANNINI CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A Stanford student-run start-up,
C3Nano, last week took home a
$200,000 cash grant at M.l.T.'s annu
al Clean Energy Entrepreneurship
Competition for its development of a
new proprietary transparent elec
trode material.

Ajay Virkar, a doctoral student in
chemical engineering, is one of the
students who founded C3Nano earli
er this year. The team was also led by
Melbs LeMieux, another chemical
engineering doctoral student.
Virkar was pleased with both the
results of the competition and the ex
posure the start-up gained to poten
tial investors in Boston and the Bay
Area.

The thin-film technology devel
oped by C3Nano has the potential to
be used in a variety of applications,
including touch-screens and photo
voltaic solar cells. There are numer
ous other companies already com
peting in this technology space,
which Virkar estimated has a $5 bil
lion value.

The Stanford team is confident,
however, that its product will be a vi
able competitor. C3Nano's material
is cheaper to produce than what is
currently on the market because it
can be created at relatively low tem
peratures. At the same time, the ma
terial is more malleable and less
breakable than what is currently
used for touch-screens in products
like the iPhone.

The technology introduced by
C3Nano is also considered to be
"green." Virkar said that the "materi
als are about 10 percent more trans
parent, allowing increased efficiency
of solar cells." The film allows more
light to enter the photovoltaic cell,
lowering the predicted cost of gener
ating energy anywhere from five
cents to ten cents per watt.

Chemical engineering Prof.
Zhenan Bao, another founder of the
company, pointed out additional
ways in which the technology can be
used.

"One can also use this kind of
coding for antistatic coding or an
tifogging coding for windows in
cars," Bao said.
Antistatic coding is used to make
bags for electronic products that re
move any electrostatic charges built
up in the shipping process.
Virkar is set to finish his thesis in
the coming week, after which he and
the other cofounders "can focus on
looking into [their] options more
thoroughly and carefully," Bao said.
The group submitted its business
plan for developing the technology
to the M.I.T. competition. Thus far
the team has created a prototype,
which is about the size of an iPhone
touch-screen, and has successfully in
tegrated the technology into work
ing solar cells. Moving forward, they
will be looking to scale up produc
tion and use their material in com
mercial products.
The annual, student-run contest
at M.I.T. is designed to fund and pro
vide networking resources for clean
technology initiatives and entrepre
neurs across the country. It attracted
more than 60 teams competing in
three different rounds this year.
The competition was sponsored
by the U.S. Department of Energy;
the Boston utility company NStar
awarded the cash prize, flie competi
tion also provided opportunities to
network with interested venture cap
italists, several of whom served on
the judging panels.
C3Nano's fellow finalists includ
ed companies that make nano-engi
neered and environmentally friendly
concrete, devices used to adjust elec
trical supply for large buildings
based on need, compression technol
ogy for producing natural gas more
cost-effectively and a digital lock sys
tem for community bicycles.
