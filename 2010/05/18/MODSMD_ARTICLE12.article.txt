## EDITORIAL Pay respect to all those who touch our lives here at Stanford 
### 
Kim Hess, manager of Lagunita Late
Nite for the past seven years, died
suddenly this past Saturday of an ap
parent heart attack at his San Jose home.
From 7 p.m. to 2 a.m. Sunday through Thurs
day, Hess could be found at Lag Late Nite,
serving students with a smile, cooking up de
licious food for students and always working
on new recipes. For many students who fre
quented Late Nite, Hess was a pivotal part of
their Stanford experience. In the wake of
Kim Hess' passing, the Editorial Board
would like to remind the student body of the
integral role each University staff member
plays in helping to make our community the
place it is.
The Stanford community is in mourning
following Hess' passing. Several threads of e
mails on student lists have become away for
students to mourn, remember great conver
sations and pay their respects to Hess' fami
ly. A group of students has also organized
memorial cards posted at Late Nite, where
students can pay their respects or write down
fond memories of Hess. A Facebook post by
Lagunita Late Nite regarding Hess' unex

pected passing has received 31 responses,
with students recounting the great support
Hess provided in the late hours of the night,
how he helped students fight off homesick
ness, the pride he took in his kitchen and the
personal affection he had for all his "kids." Fi
nally, residents of Lagunita are currently tak
ing up donations for Hess' family to help
them in this difficult time.
It is truly powerful to see the Stanford
community come together to remember and
honor the life of a University employee who
touched so many students' lives. The Editori
al Board encourages students to remember
and appreciate every member of the Stan
ford community, including faculty, adminis
trators and staff like Kim Hess. In their own
ways, each of these groups helps make this
campus what it is our home. Within our
busy student lives, sometimes we take for
granted very important members of our com
munity. Our time here at Stanford is short,
but due to the simple yet powerful contribu
tions of dedicated staff like the late Kim
Hess, that short time is made all the more
meaningful.
