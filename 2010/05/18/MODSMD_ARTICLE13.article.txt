## Cuts to Education 
### JENNA QUEENAN '11 
Tom Heng, a transfer student at Santa
Ana College, is one of the many students,
workers and teachers affected by the Califor
nia budget cuts to the state's public educa
tion. As Tom said, "Classes and majors are
getting cut... Some people drop out or
make other sacrifices because of the tuition
hikes. People with busy schedules, such as
many of us who have to work as well as go to
school, will have a much harder time getting
classes they can attend." The cuts to the Cali
fornia education budget have not only result
ed in the loss of jobs, but real day-to-day ef
fects for the lives of many students, teachers
and families.

Equal access to education is a crucial com
ponent of a just, democratic society. The
state's reaction to the recent economic crisis,
however, threatens this access. In February
2009, The state of California cut $5.3 billion
from K-12 education, $BOO million from com
munity colleges and $2 billion from the Cali
fornia State University System (CSU) and
the UCs . Consequently, CSU will cut enroll
ment by 40,000 in the next two years and
community colleges by 250,000.
Cuts like these demonstrate the low prior
ity given to the education of our youth. A
comparison of education with other aspects
of the budget serves to further illustrate this.
Consider the following: In the last three
years, education spending in California has
been reduced by 42%. California's funding of
Criminal Justice (prisons and police), howev
er, has grown by 126% since 1984. Funding
for higher education has shrunk over the
same period by 12%.The state legislature cut
$9 billion from education for 2009-2010, but
the state would be $8.4 billion richer if its cor
porate tax rate were what it was in 1981. Dur
ing the most recent budget crisis, the state
legislature passed even further tax giveaways
to Californian mega-corporations at a cost of

$2.5 billion in lost tax revenue per year. This
is not an issue merely of a lack of money, but
also a policy over time that prioritizes corpo
rate profit over equal access to quality
schools, incarceration over education.

Equal access to quality public education is
prevented by two other main problems be
sides reduced spending on education. The
first is that the budget cuts in K-12 education
unequally affect poor school districts. The
use of property taxes to partially fund public
primary and secondary education has left
districts that have lower property values
much less able to cope with cuts in services
than more affluent neighborhoods. For ex
ample, 66% of principles in "high-poverty"
schools have recently reported layoffs of
teachers compared to 15% of principles in
middle-class and upper-class districts. On the
college level, another issue of concern is that
access doled out according to ability to pay is
inherently unequal access. Put simply, public
education is getting more expensive and thus
becoming less viable for a percentage of our
population. For example, CSU fees have in
creased 32% over the past year and a total of
182% since 2002. Community college fees
have increased 30% this year and UC fees
have increased 44% since Fall 2009. These
cuts will make it even harder for many low
income students to get a four-year degree.
Many students and affiliated workers and
teachers have risen in resistance to these
threats to education and many students are
now facing expulsion. As Stanford students
who value education and currently live in
California, we should do our best to, at the
very least, educate ourselves about what is
going on in this state. As current residents, we
are all implicated to a certain degree in the
state's actions.
