# JUST A THOUGHT
## With apologies to Hawaii 
### Nikola Milanovic 
Brief disclaimer: With regards to last
week's column, I'd like to offer a sin
cere apology to anyone who was of
fended by the content of my writing. I wrote
a satire column indicting the United States
for its failure to respond to genocide and for
its weak justifications for doing so. As one of
my editors adeptly pointed out, in making
such a critique, one adopts the language of
the culture/mindset they are critiquing,
bringing some readers to the erroneous con
clusion that I endorsed the viewpoints I out
lined in the column. I can understand how
people may have found such satire offensive.
On that note, please do not take offense to
this column, which compares the merits of
the east and west coasts. This column does
not represent the views of The Stanford
Daily, its editorial staff, God or the school ad
ministration. This column is not meant to de
grade, marginalize, offend or disrespect ei
ther coast, its inhabitants or anybody any
where ever. We at The Stanford Daily main
tain that all coasts and the states contained
therein are inherently equal and deserving of
equal treatment, respect and rights.
Except for Delaware. Delaware is boring.
At a school with such amazing geograph
ic diversity (50 states and over 60 nations!),
students are often encouraged to celebrate
their origins and the differences they repre
sent. One can admire the eclectic garments
worn by students from foreign lands, a testa
ment to the rich cultural tapestry that is Stan
ford. As a matter of fact, by simply walking
around campus, one is liable to hear up to 17
different accents in an hour-long period! Di
versity it's awesome.
But with the admiration for foreign cul
tures and little-known customs comes the
question: which cultures and customs are the
best? Surely there must be a winner. This col
umn provides the kind of comprehensive
analysis only available in an 800-word spurt,

which answers that very question: which is
better â€” the east coast or the west coast?

(Author's note: it is widely acknowledged
that North Dakota is the best state in the
U.S./world. After all, it has brought us famous
politicians (Molly Spaeth), prolific journal
ists (Molly Spaeth) and good-looking
women (Molly Spaeth.) As such, this ques
tion is really asking "After North Dakota,
which is best: the east or the west coast?")
Let's begin: which coast has more nation
al capitals? It seems that, while the east coast
is home to Washington, D.C., the west coast
has no national capitals! Not even one?
Come on, west coast enthusiasts, you can do
better than that. Until California becomes its
own nation (President Schwarzenegger), the
score will remain: East Coast: 1, West Coast:
0.

Moving on, which coast is home to the
team with the most World Series titles? Ana
lyzing, analyzing. It appears that the East
Coast, proud owner of the New York Yan
kees (with 27 championships) is once again
the winner! In fact, if you add up total World
Series titles, east coast teams have over 80,
whereas west coast teams have 10 (four with
out the LA Dodgers.) East Coast: 2, West
Coast: 0.

Next up: Frank Sinatra songs. Known by
many as the greatest singer/songwriter in the
history of music or sound, Sinatra coined
many songs dedicated to different parts of
the world. How do his coastal preferences

line up? Let's see! It seems he has four songs
about New York alone, whereas San Francis
co and Los Angeles each merit one song.
(Hawaii gets one, but they don't count as the
west coast. They were lucky to even get state
hood.) Another resounding win for the At
lantic conference. East Coast: 3, West Coast:
0.

What about food, ask our culinary afi
cionados? An excellent question, to be sure.
The east coast is home to the Philly cheese
steak, Brooklyn-style pizza, Maine lobsters,
crab cakes (what Maryland does, baby) and
cocaine (Miami.) By contrast, it seems the
west coast has only avocadoes, burger sliders
and the San Francisco pot brownie as its cul
tural gastronomic touchstones. East Coast: 4,
West Coast: 0.

"Bah!" cry our geriatric westerners, "You
overlook the fine weather of our fair coast, a
key feature of the west's attractiveness to the
elderly and retired!" While it is true that Cal
ifornia is known for its pansy winters and
summer beaches, these objectors are forget
ting that the west coast is also home to Ore
gon and Washington, where schools close
due to chance of sun. Let us not forget Flori
da, on the other hand, with its state motto
"Come for the Weather, Stay to Cost Gore
the 2000 Election!" It is a well-known statis
tic that nine out of 10 retired persons prefer
the weather of Florida, the shuffleboard and
naptime capital of the world. East Coast: 5,
West Coast: 0.

Hopefully this column has been a vital re
source in solving, once and for all, any quan
daries or queries regarding the merits of our
nation's coasts.
