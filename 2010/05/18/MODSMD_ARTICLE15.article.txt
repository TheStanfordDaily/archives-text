# BROADLY SPEAKING
## L'Oreal-Because You're Worth It 
### Molly Spaeth 
This column originally ran 10/13/2009
These past two summers, I worked with a
lady named Terri, a paralegal who also
used to work the makeup counter at
Estee Lauder. She told me a story about a
married couple who had walked in one day,
looking to get a makeover for the wife. As
Terri began painting the woman's eyelids, the
husband kept up a steady stream of questions.
"Why do you put that there? What does that
brush do? So, is that the right color?" As the
makeover wore on, Terri began to get a little
annoyed by the man's persistent, almost-con
trolling manner in which he was allowing the
primping process to unfold. After Terri had
finished, the man took her to the side and
apologized for being so intrusive.
"I'm sorry if I was a little too involved
while you were working. It's just that my wife
is going blind, and I want to be able to learn
how to do her makeup. Although I think
she's the most beautiful woman in the world
without makeup, I want to make sure that she
can still feel beautiful."

Commence the waterworks. (Men, take
note).

But in all seriousness, I would like to make
a point in hopes of educating all the men in
The Daily's readership on yet another per
spective of their all-too-long list of Things
Men Just Don't Understand: The Power of
Feeling Pretty.
It is important to note that, like the man at
the Estee Lauder counter noted, being pret
ty and feeling pretty are two extremely dif
ferent entities. And for those who don't easi
ly understand the nuances separating the two
(cough, all men cough), it may be very easy to
confuse the interplay between confidence,

insecurity and the power of a woman's sexu
ality.

I've seen two sides of the male argument.
A good friend of mine consistently berates
me for putting on makeup. "Why are you
doing that?! Makeup is gross, you don't need
to do that." Another, yet still very dear, friend
of mine has asked me more than once on days
I haven't have time for blush, "Hey Molly, you
feeling alright? You look a little ill."
Critics of makeup, the beauty trade and
even stilettos for that matter have argued
that the industry was created and exists sole
ly to provide men with yet another source of
masturbatory pleasure while simultaneously
resigning women to an inherently inferior
section of society. You want to please the
other half? Well, then you better paint your
face.

They wish.
When I add a little more gold eye shadow
to my arch, it's because sometimes I like to
pretend that it is fairy dust. When I wear red
lipstick, it's because it makes me feel like a
successful journalist, like Mary Tyler Moore.
And when I curl my hair, it's because some
times I like to feel like a mermaid. It may be
trivial, you may think it's stupid, and I'll
admit there probably will always be a part of

me that is an 8 year-old-girl, but I can tell you
with just as much confidence that when I put
on makeup in the morning it is for me, and
not for anyone else.
I went to a high school dance one time in
a group of friends that included a girl I didn't
really know that well. I asked her if she want
ed to come over and curl our hair and put on
makeup before the dance. She looked at me
with disdain and responded, "Oh. I don't re
ally do those kinds of things. I'd rather read a
book or watch the news than play around
with " makeup
0.K., I like mascara. But that doesn't
mean I'm dumb. On the contrary, I'll wave
my Dior wand around my lashes in the morn
ing and five minutes later we can talk about
Berlusconi's ethical dilemmas-and if you
catch me on a good day, I can do them simul
taneously. Makeup is something I enjoy
doing, it's something that makes me feel pret
ty, but it doesn't define who I am. Spending
hours pawning through the Bobbi Brown
collection in Nordstrom doesn't make me in
secure; it means I have a hobby.
Hell, feminism isn't perfect. Equal rights
in the workforce may not fully exist yet, and
there are men who still think they can tell me
what I can do with my own body, but I at least
find solace in the fact that the intrinsic confi
dence of feeling beautiful and the part of me
that will always be an 8-year-old girl playing
"Pretty, Pretty Princess" is a source that no
man can ever touch.
And as far as glass ceilings go, give me a
job in your company and in two years I'll be
smashing that ceiling to pieces with my five
inch stilettos.
