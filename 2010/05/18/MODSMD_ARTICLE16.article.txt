## CARD OVER OREGON No. 15 Stanford sweeps Ducks, looks to postseason 
### KABIR SAWHNEY DESK EDITOR 
After a sweep at the hands of Washington,
the Stanford softball team was in need of a
strong series against Oregon to salvage its con
ference season.

Fortunately, the No. 15 Cardinal (36-17,8-
13 Pac-10) made short work of the No. 20
Ducks (33-19, 8-13), sweeping a conference
opponent for the first time this season. None
of the games were closely contested Stan
ford's average margin of victory was over
four runs and the Card looks to carry the
momentum as it enters NCAA Regionals on
Friday.
With the sweep, Stanford ends its regular
season tied with Oregon for sixth in the Pac
-10, ahead of last-place Oregon State.
Stanford's pitching was one of the keys to
its success. Junior pitcher Ashley Chinn, who
hurled all 21 innings for Stanford over the
weekend, was able to bottle up an Oregon of
fense that harbored some dangerous threats.
Chinn improved her record to 11-8 on the sea
son after notching three wins.
Notably, the series did not mark the return
of freshman pitcher Teagan Gerhart, who ap
pears to still be recovering from an arm injury.
She did enter all three games as a pinch run
ner, a role she has frequently played over the
past two weeks, but Gerhart's pitching return
is still uncertain. Head coach John Rittman
did not give any indication of considering her
to be an option to pitch if Chinn began to
struggle.
The Cardinal offense, however, overshad
owed any questions of the team's pitching ros
ter. Stanford seemed to cure some of the of
fensive woes that have plagued it for much of
the season. After scoring just one run against
the Huskies, the Card exploded against Ore
gon's pitchers, tallying 21 runs over the course
of the three games.
The four pitchers used by the Ducks were
all unable to effectively contain the Stanford
offense, and the rotation found no stability

three different pitchers were charged with the
three losses.

Once again, Stanford's offense was led by
its two All-Americans senior left fielder
Alissa Haber and sophomore second baseman
Ashley Hansen. Haber went 6-12 against Ore
gon with three RBIs, while Hansen was 3-9
with six RBIs. Hansen especially epitomized
the kind of "timely hitting" that Rittman had
emphasized heading into the series.
The first game of the series, on Thursday
night, seemed to be heading in the Ducks'

favor early on. But then Stanford took over
and, in a performance that would set the tone
for the rest of the weekend, the Card bats se
cured the victory, 9-4.
In the first inning, the Ducks scored four
quick runs off Chinn, including a three-run
home run by Oregon second baseman Kaylan
Howard. Though it jumped out to that early
lead, Oregon spent the rest of the game unable
to start anything else offensively.
Meanwhile, Stanford responded resound
ingly in the second and third innings, putting
together a three-run rally in the second to
draw within one run, then adding four more in
the third to take a decisive 7-4 lead. The Card
never looked back, and added another run
each in the fifth and sixth innings.
Not one Oregon pitcher was able to play
well each of the three Duck pitchers gave
up three runs, with the loss being charged to
Mikayla Endicott, who only managed to stay
in the game for 0.2 innings.
The second game of the series saw Stanford
take control early, with a four-run first inning
being its main catalyst. With solid pitching be
hind it, the Card cruised to a 5-1 victory.
Pitching her best game of the series, Chinn
surrendered just three hits to the Ducks and
gave up just one run in the fourth inning while
striking out four batters.
For the offense, senior catcher Rosey Neill
