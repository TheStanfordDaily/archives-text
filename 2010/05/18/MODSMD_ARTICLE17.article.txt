# The 						fickle nature of sports
## 
### Jacob Jaffe Fields of Failure 
The training wheels are oft you
can pack your own lunch and
you can see PG-13 movies.
You're old enough for the
truth.
Sports are unpredictable. Yeah, I said
it.
In a world where you can bet on any
tiling from the winner of the Preakness
to the number of catches by a backup
tight end, where you can read "expert
analysis" on where an offensive lineman
from Southeastern North Dakota Tech
will go in the seventh round, where play
ers use binoculars and cameras to steal
signs, where Charles Barkley gets paid
to predict who will win the NBA Finals
(and people listen to him), where fanta
sy sports leagues are more popular than
presidential elections, we're led to be
lieve that there are people out there who
know what is going to happen.
But the truth is, unless that person is
telling you that the Stanford women's
tennis team is going to win its next home
match, or it's Biff Tannen with an early
21st-century sports almanac, there is a
chance that person will be wrong.
Of course, if you're a sports fan, you
probably enjoy trying to predict what
will happen in sporting events. It's part
of the fun to predict a hot streak for
Brian Roberts at the beginning of the
year and get rewarded on your fanta
sy team, as much as it's fun to laugh at
the guy who starts Chien-Ming Wang
(no comment on which of those two
was me).
If you're rocking a playoff beard and
your weekends revolve around your
team's playoff games, it's part of being a
fan to predict a sweep for your team and
rub it in the faces of opposing fans when
you're right (or pretend not to have said
anything when you're wrong).
And most sports fans watch some
kind of sports shows and/or read about
sports in some magazine or website.
Apart from being a great way to put off
that 10-page paper or job application,
these forms of sports media provide a

great way to leam more about the sports
you love, while also helping you whip
out that crazy tidbit at a party that shows
how knowledgeable (or horribly pa
thetic) you are.
One of the best segments on sports
TV shows is where the experts predict
things about sports, and the same goes
for sports prediction columns. Some
thing about being able to argue with for
mer players-tumed-analysts for their
wrong opinions or laud the brilliance
of the same players when they pick your
team —just gets everyone excited. Plus,
it's a lot easier to skim a column with a

nice, easy-to-read chart of predictions
than trudge through huge blocks of text
(hey, we never really outgrow our first
grade love of picture books).
The thing about these great predic
tions is that they mean about as much as
your cousin who says, "Ooh, Kobe is
cute, and I like those uniforms. Go Lak
ers!" Sure, theoretically people who
write and talk about sports for a living
have better information and can more
accurately predict what will happen. But
in reality, for every expert that correctly
predicted Canadiens vs. Flyers,there are
thousands that had the Capitals winning
the Stanley Cup, UTEP over Butler in
the first round and the Spurs sweeping
the Suns.

And how can you blame them? The
players themselves can't tell you what's
going to happen beforehand —Joe Na

math guarantees aside so how could
anyone else? The only difference be
tween the casual fan and the "expert" is
that the expert needs to form an opinion
to keep his/her job.
Case in point: I'm an Angels fan, and
I was reading an ESPN story about the
reason why the Angels swept the A's this
weekend. I was skeptical but curious at
first one reason to go from 3-10 in
their last 13 to a three-game sweep?
What could it be? The two complete
game shutouts by starting pitchers? The
two home runs and five RBIs in a game
by Kendry Morales? Nope. It was mov
ing Howie Kendrick from the bottom of
the order up to second.
I had to laugh. There's no way one
small lineup change could be "the differ
ence," especially when the key to the se
ries was clearly pitching. And the article

wasn't even bad. It made a fairly com
pelling argument, but by the end I was
only thinking one thing sportswriters
really jump to conclusions.
In reality, they have to. When it's
your job to analyze sports, you have to
come up with something that the folks
at home can't just spot easily. So last
night's win has to be the result of one
player not wanting it or a great coaching
move.There's no chance in sports analy
sis.

No one is immune to it either. Pick
your favorite play-by-play man, Sports-
Center anchor, analyst or columnist. I
can guarantee that person has spent
days discussing Leßron's elbow or
Steve Bartman or any of the millions of
other scapegoats people create to ex
plain their team's failures.
The fact is, we just don't know what's
going to happen in sports. And that's
why sports are so great.

No one is immune to it either. Pick
your favorite play-by-play man, Sports-
Center anchor, analyst or columnist. I
can guarantee that person has spent
days discussing Leßron's elbow or
Steve Bartman or any of the millions of
other scapegoats people create to ex
plain their team's failures.
The fact is, we just don't know what's
going to happen in sports. And that's
why sports are so great.

Jacob Jaffe thinks Kobe's super cute
socks indicate a Lakers win on
Wednesday. Meet up with him at Sun
splash via jwjaffe@stanford.edu to
hear more fascinating tidbits.
