in Wilmington, N.C. The first round of 18 holes be
gins today, and the tournament will conclude on
Friday. Participants will play 72 holes of golf, and
the lowest four scores from each team will count
toward each day's total score.
Stanford placed sixth at the NCAA West Re
gional held at its home course from May 6-8 to se
cure its national berth this week.
The top eight teams from each of the three re
gional tournaments, as well as two of the highest
individuals not from a selected team, advanced to
the national tournament. Of the 369 regional par
ticipants, 126 will travel to Wilmington.
Other West Regional teams joining Stanford on

Tennessee, Auburn, Duke, Vanderbilt,Tulane,Pep
perdine andTCU will be competing. Representing

Oregon and Kent State.
The Cardinal made its last qualified appear
ance at the 2007 NCAA Championships in Day
tona Beach, Flaâ€ž when the women finished fifth
overall. The Card made its highest showing at the
2000 championships with a second-place finish.
The team is prepared to make its mark this
year, as well.
"This is why we work so hard all year, so that we
can be here to play with the best," said junior Re
becca Durham. "The course is going to be tough,
but fair, and a lot of fun to play. We 're ready to play
hard and go low."
"I really love the team's attitude going into the
event," said sophomore Sydney Burlison. "I know
we all want to do well, but at the same time I think
we are just so happy to be here and enjoy the ex
perience. For four out of the five of us it's our first
time here, so we're all really excited. It's nice to
have two days of preparation as opposed to one,
and in addition being here longer has gotten us ac
customed to the time difference. We're ready."
Results and streaming of the last two rounds of
the championships will be available online at the
NCAA's website. Holes 16, 17 and 18 will be
streamed on Thursday and Friday.
