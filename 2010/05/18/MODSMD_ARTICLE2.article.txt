# Khalilzad discusses Iraq, Afghanistan
## Talk said Obama's policies weakened relations 
### DEVIN BANERJEE SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Obama administration's policies in
Iraq and Afghanistan have weakened U.S.
relations with those countries and, in some
cases, have fostered increased corruption
within their governments. At least that was
one of the messages delivered Monday af
ternoon at Stanford by Zalmay Khalilzad,
former U.S. ambassador to the United Na
tions, Iraq and Afghanistan, in a wide-rang
ing talk entitled "The Struggle for the
Broader Middle East: Where We Are and
Where We Need to Go."

Khalilzad, 59, who served under Presi
dent Bush, was born in Afghanistan and ed
ucated in Kabul, Beirut and Chicago.
He called recent exchanges between the
United States and Afghanistan a "blame
game" that has eroded the relationship be
tween the two countries. Afghan President
Hamid Karzai last month blamed the Unit
ed States and other Western powers for
election fraud, and the United States re
sponded by calling the comments troubling
and frustrating.
"I believe that the origin of the situation
was the change in the administration in the
U. 5.," Khalilzad said, later adding: "There is
now an effort underway to really strength
en the relationship, but the situation in
Afghanistan is very fragile."
Specifically, Khalilzad said, Obama's
timelines to begin withdrawing U.S. combat
troops from Iraq this summer and from

Afghanistan in July 2011 have led to in
creased corruption by giving local leaders
the perception that important resources
they now enjoy will disappear when the
Americans leave.

"People have begun to hedge against
the scenario," Khalilzad said. "People are
thinking, we better take care of oneself
when the going is good in terms of availabil
ity of resources."
In Iraq, Khalilzad said, U.S. intervention
since 2003 has propped up the construction
of important societal institutions, but the
American exit strategy threatens to derail
development of a fair and balanced Iraqi
government.

"Everyone is thinking we [the United
States] are on our way out, we are looking
to the door, we are on a short timeline,"
Khalilzad said. "The Iraqi actors are look
ing to regional players for support, and that
has produced more polarization."

The former ambassador went as far as to
say that failure in Iraq may indicate im
pending failure in Afghanistan. "What will
happen in Iraq could be a precursor to what
one might see in Afghanistan if we contin
ue down the path the president has said of
reducing forces," he said.
In all, Khalilzad said, the American rela
tionship with Iraq and Afghanistan is "a
more delicate situation than it was three or
four years ago." Khalilzad's term as ambas
sador to Iraq ended in March 2007.
On the Arab-Israeli conflict, Khalilzad
said a resolution would be an "important

shaping factor" in the Middle East. At the
same time, from his perspective, "the cir
cumstances are not ready for a settlement
in the near term."

"I think the Israeli government wants a
process without an outcome in the near fu
ture, and the Palestinians want an outcome
without a process," Khalilzad said. "And it is
unlikely, given where the parties are, that
we will get to a settlement of this issue in the
foreseeable future."

On the Middle East as a whole,
Khalilzad laid out five factors that are
shaping the region. These included the
challenge of militant Islam, which he char
acterized as a "civilizational crisis" that is
now being put to the test by modernity; re
gional disputes such as the Arab-Israeli
conflict, the Afghanistan-Pakistan territo
rial dispute and the Indian-Pakistan bor
der dispute; rivalry for hegemony in the re
gion, which encompasses the Sunni-Shia
conflict and Iran's desire to obtain nuclear
weapons; democratization efforts, which,
Khalilzad said, are growing but continually
at the mercy of internal instability; and
extra-regional factors such as Western in
tervention.

Iran, Khalilzad said in his closing re
marks, has emerged "front and center" in
the Middle East as its nuclear ambitions
continue to play out on the world stage,
"It will reshape the region for some time
to come, whether it does get away and be-
