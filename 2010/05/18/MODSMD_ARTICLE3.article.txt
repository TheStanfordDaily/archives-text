## Stanford's use of tax-exempt bonds set to continue 
### ERIC MESSINGER SENIOR MANAGING EDITOR 
Universities' use of tax-exempt bonds
to fund capital projects has come under
scrutiny from the federal government, in
troducing the possibility of increased regu
lation, but Stanford's existing practices ap
pear set to continue as normal and will face
no additional oversight at the state level
for now.

Stanford often finances capital projects
by issuing tax-exempt bonds in order to
avoid drawing large amounts from the Uni
versity's endowment payouts. Odile Disch-
Bhadkamkar, the University treasurer, said

the practice is a preferable alternative
when Stanford cannot cover the costs of
construction through donor gifts.
"We typically will issue debt for capital
projects when we cannot fundraise," Disch-
Bhadkamkar said.

The use of this practice by non-profit
colleges and universities with substantial
investment assets like Stanford, which
has the third-largest endowment of any uni
versity â€” has drawn the attention of the
Congressional Budget Office (CBO),
which is concerned with the possibility of
such institutions unfairly benefiting from
"indirect" tax arbitrage.
Tax arbitrage, which the CBO defines as

"the use of proceeds from lower-cost, tax
exempt bonds to directly finance the pur
chase of higher-yield securities," is illegal.
The CBO issued a report in April, however,
pointing to a legal practice that could merit
additional federal scrutiny, stating that "to
the extent that colleges and universities can
earn untaxed returns on investments that
are higher than the interest they pay on tax
exempt debt, they are benefiting from a
form of'indirect' tax arbitrage."

Disch-Bhadkamkar characterized this
criticism as part of a larger skepticism to
ward the size of university endowments and
investment holdings. She defended the use
of tax-exempt debt to fund capital projects,

however, as not only legal, but appropriate,
on the grounds that it would not be feasible
to take funds from Stanford's endowment
payouts to pay for construction projects.
Tapping into endowment payouts might
have a detrimental effect on the Universi
ty's ability to provide funding for expenses
unrelated to capital projects, such as nor
mal University functions of teaching and
research. Taking on taxable debt would also
strain the resources of Stanford's endow
ment payouts, she said.
In addition, if the University were forced
to rely more on gifts, Disch-Bhadkamkar
said, funding for non-"marquee" in
cremental capital improvements and
maintenance that may not attract
named donors could suffer.

Because the report does not de
scribe the practice as illegal and be
cause issuing tax-exempt debt is a
desirable option for the University,
there is no reason to expect a
change in the University's finance
practices in the near-term. That
could change if, in a political climate
encouraging financial oversight,
legislation were introduced that im
posed new regulation over practices
like "indirect tax arbitrage" a
possibility Disch-Bhadkamkar said
she recognizes.
"I think everyone is clearly very
aware of the scrutiny and the poten
tial for the review of the current leg
islation," Disch-Bhadkamkar said.

Currently, Stanford relies on the
California Educational Facilities Au

thority (CEFA) to issue tax-exempt
debt, while the University provides
credit for the repayment of the
bonds. Joe DeAnda, a spokesman
for the California state treasurer's
office, said as long as Stanford meets
the standard criteria for issuing debt,
additional scrutiny of Stanford's
practices would not occur.
"[The CEFA] exists basically
solely to provide private non-profit
educational facilities with access to
that kind of financing," DeAnda
said.
Stanford's use of funds obtained
through bonds is instead subject to
the oversight of the Internal Rev
enue Service (IRS). Disch-Bhad
kamkar said that the University
works with the IRS to ensure com
pliance with their rules.
"They look at the investments to
make sure that we've actually writ
ten, against the bonds, checks to pay
for construction," she said.
Stanford received approval to re
finance $9OO million in tax-exempt
debt in March. The funds were
linked to construction of a large
number of major capital projects, in

eluding the Business School's Knight
Management Center and the Law
School's William H. Neukom Build
ing.
The value of Stanford's endow
ment was $12.6 billion in fiscal year
2009.
