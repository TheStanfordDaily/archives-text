## Stanford's use of tax-exempt bonds set to continue 
### ERIC MESSINGER SENIOR MANAGING EDITOR 
Universities' use of tax-exempt bonds
to fund capital projects has come under
scrutiny from the federal government, in
troducing the possibility of increased regu
lation, but Stanford's existing practices ap
pear set to continue as normal and will face
no additional oversight at the state level
for now.

Stanford often finances capital projects
by issuing tax-exempt bonds in order to
avoid drawing large amounts from the Uni
versity's endowment payouts. Odile Disch-
Bhadkamkar, the University treasurer, said

the practice is a preferable alternative
when Stanford cannot cover the costs of
construction through donor gifts.
"We typically will issue debt for capital
projects when we cannot fundraise," Disch-
Bhadkamkar said.

The use of this practice by non-profit
colleges and universities with substantial
investment assets like Stanford, which
has the third-largest endowment of any uni
versity â€” has drawn the attention of the
Congressional Budget Office (CBO),
which is concerned with the possibility of
such institutions unfairly benefiting from
"indirect" tax arbitrage.
Tax arbitrage, which the CBO defines as

"the use of proceeds from lower-cost, tax
exempt bonds to directly finance the pur
chase of higher-yield securities," is illegal.
The CBO issued a report in April, however,
pointing to a legal practice that could merit
additional federal scrutiny, stating that "to
the extent that colleges and universities can
earn untaxed returns on investments that
are higher than the interest they pay on tax
exempt debt, they are benefiting from a
form of'indirect' tax arbitrage."

Disch-Bhadkamkar characterized this
criticism as part of a larger skepticism to
ward the size of university endowments and
investment holdings. She defended the use
of tax-exempt debt to fund capital projects,

however, as not only legal, but appropriate,
on the grounds that it would not be feasible
to take funds from Stanford's endowment
payouts to pay for construction projects.
Tapping into endowment payouts might
have a detrimental effect on the Universi
ty's ability to provide funding for expenses
unrelated to capital projects, such as nor
mal University functions of teaching and
research. Taking on taxable debt would also
strain the resources of Stanford's endow
ment payouts, she said.
In addition, if the University were forced
to rely more on gifts, Disch-Bhadkamkar
