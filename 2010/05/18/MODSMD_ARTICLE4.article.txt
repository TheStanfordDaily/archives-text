## Hair cells created in Stanford lab 
### JULIA BROWNELL SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford researchers recently created the first ever hair
cells in culture. Hair cells, the mechanical receptor neurons
located within the ear, pick up sound waves in air and
transmit the signals to the brain what we call hearing.
Stefan Heller, professor of otolaryngology and chief
author of the study, and his colleagues were able to pro
gram mouse-induced pluripotent stem cells into hair cells
outside of the animal. Previously, any hair cells used in re
search had to be harvested from living animals.
With this new technique, Heller and many other re
searchers can produce enough hair cells to do further re
search on hearing.
"That was the main goal creating a bucket full of
cells," Heller said.
