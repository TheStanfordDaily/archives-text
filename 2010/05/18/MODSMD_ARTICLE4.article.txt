## Hair cells created in Stanford lab 
### JULIA BROWNELL SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford researchers recently created the first ever hair
cells in culture. Hair cells, the mechanical receptor neurons
located within the ear, pick up sound waves in air and
transmit the signals to the brain what we call hearing.
Stefan Heller, professor of otolaryngology and chief
author of the study, and his colleagues were able to pro
gram mouse-induced pluripotent stem cells into hair cells
outside of the animal. Previously, any hair cells used in re
search had to be harvested from living animals.
With this new technique, Heller and many other re
searchers can produce enough hair cells to do further re
search on hearing.
"That was the main goal creating a bucket full of
cells," Heller said.
The research has been in the
works for many years, with some
stumbling stones along the way.
Heller was previously able to create
cells with all the same markers of real
hair cells, but without their function
ality. These cells, however, respond to
mechanical stimulation the same way
as undifferentiated hair cells.

"We found that if you mimic air
borne sound ... the cells respond,"
said Anthony Ricci, professor of oto
laryngology. Ricci was a co-author of
the study and did the biophysics
work, recording electrical stimula
tion from the cells.
Now that Heller's lab has found a
way to produce the cells. Heller said
he first wants to look into how indi
vidual hair cell types develop. Hair
cells in different parts of the ear have
different molecular markers and
electrical patterns. He is interested in
developmental biology and there
fore intends to pursue work on these
immature hair cells' differentiation.
Ricci said further research could
reveal more about trace proteins in

volved in the hearing process.
"This may help us to identify pro
teins specific to hair cells previously
out of our reach," Ricci said. "By
making a lot of cells, it will help us
identify novel proteins. The channel
responsible for mechanosensation
[has] yet to be identified because
there are so few [cells]."
From a clinical perspective, hair

cells are the ones lost by the deaf and
those with hearing loss. These cells
have potential significance for thera
pies in the long run, researchers say.
Heller said these stem cells could
be possibly be transplanted to re
store hearing in the ear. However,
the researchers would first need to
purify the cells and translate the
findings to human cells. The cells also
could be used to test drugs meant to
work to restore hearing in vitro.
"We can use the 'ear in a test tube'
as a kind of assay for future drug
screens," Heller said.
Though the findings published in
the journal Cell show promise, both
Heller and Ricci noted the early
stage of their work and the fact that
it currently has no clinical signifi
cance.
The findings are on the track for
long-run clinical significance, how
ever, Ricci said. In the meantime,
there are existing therapies for the
deaf, including cochlear implants,
Heller said.
"I think that's the direction,"
Ricci said, referring to the clinical
applications. "But it's a very slow, te
dious process and that's very far off."
