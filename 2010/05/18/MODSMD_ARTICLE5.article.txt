## Rhode: We can legislate against beauty bias 
### ZOE LEAVITT SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
"I can't walk in these shoes, which
is a problem, because I can't sit down
in this skirt," said the woman in the
cartoon Deborah Rhode projected
on the wall. Trapped within society's
expectations at the cost of her own
potential, this cartoon character
helped illustrate Rhode's overarch
ing message on Monday afternoon
when she spoke about her new book,
"The Beauty Bias: The Injustice of
Appearance in Life and Law."
Rhode, director of the Stanford
Center on the Legal Profession, for
mer president of the Association of
American Law Schools and author of
20 books, drew on her professional
and personal experience to discuss
what she views as the area of least im
provement in contemporary
women's lives.
"'lt hurts to be beautiful' is how

my mother always explained girdles
and high heels and a host of other
burdens that have grown over time,
but I've also learned how much it
hurts not to be beautiful," said
Rhode, alluding to the organizing
theme of her book.
"The impact is much more insidi
ous than a lot of us suppose," she
added.
Rhode said just as outcries against
race and weight discrimination have
increased public consciousness about
these issues, greater attention ought
to be directed toward beauty biases.
She said more states need to pioneer
legislation to prosecute appearance
discrimination in the workplace.

The crowd in the Robert Crown
Law Library, mostly women,
chomped on cookies and bag lunches
as they listened to Rhode elaborate
on the many ways that appearance
shapes a life. Scientific studies have
shown that attractive teachers re

ceive better course evaluations, bet
ter-looking lawyers are more likely to
be hired, promoted and paid higher
salaries and less attractive defen
dants receive harsher sentences from
juries in court cases, Rhode said.
"Beauty is only skin deep, but
that's plenty deep enough to confer a
really quite unsettling array of advan
tages," she said.
Any drugstore magazine rack can
broadcast the high standards men
and women face to reach the elite
ranks of the conventionally beautiful,
she said. But these struggles are not
to be written off as the sighs of the
five-pounds overweight or the strag
gly-haired. People in greatest need of
jobs are often the ones who can't af
ford makeup or manicures and do not
have access to healthy food or gym
equipment.
"Low-income individuals are like-
ly to live in nutritional and recre
ational deserts," Rhode said.
"There ought to be a lot of ways
to be attractive in this culture, and
[it] shouldn't depend on being
white and young and under
weight," she added.
Some listeners remained skepti
cal that the playing field could ever
be leveled. Appearance discrimina
tion can be subtle and hard to ac
cuse, and Americans hold mixed
opinions on the benefits of fighting
it by law. One student attendee on
Monday brought up the problem
that humans have evolved to value
certain physical traits above others
for fitness reasons, and questioned
whether or not the law could over
come potential evolutionary biases.
"I'm a realist," Rhode respond
ed. "You can only do so much with
legal strategies, and only so much
with consumer boycotts and
spending strategies. [The] law is a
very limited tool."
Rather than trying to complete
ly eliminate physical bias, Rhode
hopes that anti-bias laws will help
raise public awareness about the
problem even if only the very
worst cases have enough evidence
to be taken to court.

Those who believe legislation
would be ineffective, she said,
should look to the successful meth
ods through which some types of
discrimination have been fought.
"The claim always was that
these were natural deep-seated in
stincts that whites and blacks
were just not going to be able to co
exist with each other, [that] sexual
harassment was viewed as natural
expression of attraction in the
workplace," she said.
Legal solutions, however, have
arisen to combat these forms of
discrimination.
"We know that we made
progress on those issues with a fair
ly blunt instrument, so there's no
reason to think we couldn't push
the envelope slightly," Rhode said.
The talk was co-hosted by
Robert Crown Law Library and
Women of Stanford Law.
