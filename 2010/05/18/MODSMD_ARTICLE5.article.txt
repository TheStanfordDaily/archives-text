## Rhode: We can legislate against beauty bias

"I can't walk in these shoes, which
is a problem, because I can't sit down
in this skirt," said the woman in the
cartoon Deborah Rhode projected
on the wall. Trapped within society's
expectations at the cost of her own
potential, this cartoon character
helped illustrate Rhode's overarch
ing message on Monday afternoon
when she spoke about her new book,
"The Beauty Bias: The Injustice of
Appearance in Life and Law."
Rhode, director of the Stanford
Center on the Legal Profession, for
mer president of the Association of
American Law Schools and author of
20 books, drew on her professional
and personal experience to discuss
what she views as the area of least im
provement in contemporary
women's lives.
"'lt hurts to be beautiful' is how

my mother always explained girdles
and high heels and a host of other
burdens that have grown over time,
but I've also learned how much it
hurts not to be beautiful," said
Rhode, alluding to the organizing
theme of her book.
"The impact is much more insidi

added.
Rhode said just as outcries against
race and weight discrimination have
increased public consciousness about
these issues, greater attention ought
to be directed toward beauty biases.
She said more states need to pioneer
legislation to prosecute appearance
discrimination in the workplace.

The crowd in the Robert Crown
Law Library, mostly women,
chomped on cookies and bag lunches
as they listened to Rhode elaborate
on the many ways that appearance
shapes a life. Scientific studies have
shown that attractive teachers re

ceive better course evaluations, bet
ter-looking lawyers are more likely to
be hired, promoted and paid higher
salaries and less attractive defen
dants receive harsher sentences from
juries in court cases, Rhode said.
"Beauty is only skin deep, but
that's plenty deep enough to confer a
really quite unsettling array of advan
tages," she said.
Any drugstore magazine rack can
broadcast the high standards men
and women face to reach the elite
ranks of the conventionally beautiful,
she said. But these struggles are not
to be written off as the sighs of the
five-pounds overweight or the strag
gly-haired. People in greatest need of
jobs are often the ones who can't af
ford makeup or manicures and do not
have access to healthy food or gym
equipment.
"Low-income individuals are like-
