## Arizona protestors gather in White Plaza 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€”An Le Nguyen 
About 30 volunteers staged a demonstra
tion yesterday afternoon in White Plaza,
protesting against Arizona's Senate Bill 1070.
Undeterred by the rain, volunteers set up
aisles along the pathway through Braun Au
ditorium. The protestors sought to replicate
the "profiling" that suspected undocumented
immigrants may face as a byproduct of S.B.
1070.
Volunteers isolated students who did not
sport Stanford gear or red shirts; these indi
viduals were "profiled" and asked to show
their student ID cards in order to prove their
Stanford affiliation and pass through the
aisles. Those who failed to present their IDs
were subject to "interrogation" by volunteers.
AV David 'l2, one of the protestors, said
S.B. 1070 would lead to cases where minori
ties are "profiled on how they looked."
David said the possibility of such racial
profiling "would divide people" on both a
state and national level.
Though the law only has a direct legisla
tive impact on the residents within Arizona,
demonstrators said they were concerned
about wide-reaching implications on immi
gration reform.
Signed into law in late April, the bill con
ferred wide-ranging powers to state and local
police for immigration law enforcement. The
bill's text reads that the provisions of the bill
are "to discourage and deter the unlawful
entry and presence of aliens and economic ac
tivity by persons unlawfully present in the
United States."
Police are tasked with detaining and pros
ecuting suspected undocumented immi
grants.
But protestors aren't convinced.
"Racial profiling is wrong; we can't judge
anyone on their face, ethnicity or anything
else," David said.
The debate is set to continue at the "Bring
ing Home the Border" forum on Thursday in
Old Union, where students are encouraged to
talk about the effects of the Arizona law and
general immigration reform.
