## The
						Powers of Dance 
### ALYSSA WISDOM 
With Richard Powers, you really
are dancing with the star.
In his office, shelves overflow
with a mini-disk and CD col
lection ranging from 1950s
lounge and blues to movie themes and rock and
roll. Ten-year-old digital technology is juxta
posed next to by-the-minute data storage for
music, along with powdered wax used in 19th
century ballrooms to maintain floor finish.
Original dance posters from Paris, Prague, Lon
don and Venice line the walls.
These trinkets are more than just mere
adornment for Powers, an instructor in the
drama department's dance division.They repre
sent an illustrious career as a groundbreaking
dance connoisseur and a lifetime of passion for
dance.
Powers '7O became interested in historic so
cial dance while he was an undergraduate de
sign engineer at Stanford. An undersupplied
field at the time, his specialty made him a rare
expert, placing him in high demand in the world
of dance. Soon enough, he was busy teaching
for the University of Cincinnati in addition to
running national and international workshops.
In 1981, Powers coined the term "vintage
dance" and founded Flying Cloud Academy of
Vintage Dance a non-profit organization
devoted to conserving and continuing the lega
cy of historic ballroom dance. But the Farm was
calling, and Powers answered. After refusing
numerous offers to teach social dance at Stan
ford, he finally agreed to sign on to the team in
1992.
And students are lucky he did. Since 1992,
Powers' social dance class has become an im
mensely popular campus hallmark and a rite of
passage for many students. On average, Powers
instructs 1,000 students per quarter not in
cluding his nationwide and international work
shops.
"I loved the passion he had for dance, with
out the elitism that I typically associate with
professional dancers and choreographers," said
Dominique Lyew 'l2 of the social dance classes.
Powers attributes the popularity of his class
es to their "basis on the values and the needs of
Stanford students." He emphasized how his
classes mold around the school's rich diversity
and that adaptation is key.
"In social dancing you are constantly adapt
ing as opposed to following somebody else's set
of strict rules," Powers said. "This is a more alive
way of dancing to respond to the moment."
"Once the ball is snapped you don't exactly
follow the game plan," he added, comparing his
malleable dance style to the game of football.
"You improvise."
Powers stresses enjoyment in his classes
he pushes his students to explore how to have

fun, and how to let their dance partners have
more fun. He also reminds his class that "differ
ent does not mean wrong in social dance."
Adulation from his current and past stu
dents attests to the success of this teaching
method.
"He is such a creative instructor â€”he
teaches in accepting ways," said ShiYu Zhou
'l3. "Some people take it multiple times be
cause they really love it."
Jarek Lancaster 'l3 experienced Powers'
teaching in just one lesson through his Arts and
Ideas Introduction to the Humanities (IHUM)
course. He praised Powers' trial-and-error
method of teaching dance.
"He'd do a dance move, throw you into it
and tell you to do the best you can," Lancaster
said. "Then he taught the move which helped
you out because you knew what you did wrong
before and it made it easier to learn."
Powers explained that respect is built into
his technique the lead doesn't command,
and the follower doesn't obey. He reminisced
on how this cooperative style particularly af
fected one of his former students.
"All my life I've been told to pay attention in
class," he said, quoting the student. "And now
I'm paying attention to someone who is paying
attention to me."
And in some instances, Powers' class has
been truly life changing. Lyew said that Powers'
classes changed him from a shy, timid person to
an outgoing leader.
"The biggest impression he left is his seem
ing belief that anyone can learn to dance," Lyew
said. "I believe that he truly sees social dance as
fun first, and really made ballroom accessible to
beginners."
In addition to teaching, Powers has choreo
graphed multiple ballroom dances for films
such as Warner Brothers' "North and South"
and CBS's "Spring Awakenings." He special
izes in historic and contemporary social dance,
which includes ballroom, swing, tango, Latin
and waltz. His dance partners are usually An
gela Amarillas '97, Stanford's first dance minor,
and Mirage Marrou 'lO.
Power's acclaim has stretched beyond just
the Stanford bubble. As evidenced by Powers'
photo gallery on his website, he has had the
pleasure to be acquainted with celebrities
such as former President Bill Clinton, the
renowned writer also named Richard Powers,
Queen of Swing Dance Norma Miller and
American jazz singer Cab Calloway. But for
Powers, it is not always the stars that are the
most memorable.
"Often, the people who impact me more are
not the celebrities it's the students," he said.
"Things like that are more important to me
than meeting Cab Calloway. It reminds me that
I'm in the right place at the right time."
