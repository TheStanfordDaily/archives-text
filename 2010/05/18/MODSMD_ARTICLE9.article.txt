# DRUNK TAXI OR SAFETY STAPLE?
## 
### AVANTIKA AGARWAL 
After partying for several hours, a
girl who has been drinking finds
herself outside some frat, freez
ing in her short skirt. Her phone
is dead, she lost her friends a
while ago and now she's dreading the lonely
walk back to east campus.
Just when it seems too cold, too dark and
way too far to head home, a golf cart with a
flashing green light pulls up.
"Do you need a ride?" says a smiling 5-
SURE student driver. Drunken passengers
cheer as the girl gratefully jumps in.
5-SURE is Stanford's official safety es
cort service meant to provide a protected
means of transport across campus for stu
dents after dark, when they are most at risk
of assault.

SURE (Students United for Rape Elimi
nation) was born at Stanford in 1979, when a
male student, disturbed by the increase in
the number of campus rape incidents, re
cruited 30 student volunteers to bike to loca
tions across campus and walk students home
after dark. Despite criticism from the com
munity about gender stereotypes of this
chivalry guard, SURE ran smoothly for sev
eral years until it was stopped in the 'Bos.

SURE was reborn in the '9os as 5-SURE
under Student Activities and Leadership, with
a dedicated group of students determined to
make campus safer for everyone. Armed with
golf carts, two-way radios and paid drivers, 5-
SURE strived to become a reliable and trust
worthy safety service. Today, based in Old
Union, they operate seven days a week, from
10 p.m. to 2 a.m., with six small golf carts, one
bigger "limo" golf cart and one car.

"I joined because of the mission state
ment and what it did for the campus mak
ing people feel more safe on campus," said
Matthew Rivera 'll, who joined 5-SURE his
freshman year and became manager at the
beginning of last quarter.
"I like the community service aspect of
the job," added Corey Murphy 'l2, who
began driving for 5-SURE this year. "One of
the best parts of the job is that as a whole, all
of the employees are committed to provid
ing safety and improving the community."

5-SURE is not blind to this faction of
their clientele who use the service primarily
for convenience, however.
"It's not frustrating when we're not busy,"
Rivera said. "Do we call it abuse of the sys
tem? Or do we need to change our mission
statement to reflect the needs of the cam
pus?"

These questions are a subject of internal
debate, as 5-SURE staff members discuss
whether to keep their focus on safety or to
expand the official goals of the service to in
clude transporting students irrespective of
that issue.

As things stand now, higher-risk students
are given a higher priority for rides, but 5-
SURE employees never refuse service.
"One of our biggest frustrations right
now is trying to find a mission statement that
balances our community service aspect to
our taxi-service aspect," Murphy said.
Rivera added that the group is trying to
introduce new policies to focus on their orig
inal aim to provide safety to the campus. One
such policy is adding a limit to the size of
groups they would pick up, as large groups of
students traveling across campus aren't at
high risk.
Whatever their purpose, 5-SURE's serv
ices are certainly in high demand. During the
weekend. Murphy said that she's never seen
more than a 20-minute time span without a
phone call.
On a 5-SURE ride, it's common to hear
the drivers constantly talking into their ra
dios, being directed to pick-ups all across
campus. 5-SURE drivers pride themselves
on their friendly and approachable de
meanor they say this sets them apart from
similar services on other campuses.
But it isn't always easy to maintain this
pleasant demeanor. Murphy and Rivera
both spoke of the occasional unpleasantness
of dealing with drunk and angry students
and of cleaning the carts back at Old Union
after students vomit.

But they also have the chance to connect
with students who may be at their most vul
nerable.

Rivera once picked up an inebriated but
very bulky, muscular athlete who, on the drive
home, completely broke down about his rela
tionship woes. He felt pressured by his friends
to treat a recent ex-girlfriend poorly, he said,

but really he still cared about her.
"It was a very sweet, human moment,"
Rivera said with a smile.

Murphy added that student appreciation
of the service is another perk of the job.
"When people are very vocal about being
thankful, it's incredibly gratifying," Murphy
said. "It's the best part of the job."
But students using the service aren't al
ways happy.
"Our biggest complaints are about wait
time," Rivera said. "People get really angry
on the phone because of unreliable wait
times. But when people take long to come
out, it's really out of our control."
"We can't really afford to have eight peo
ple on call we do the best we can with our
funding," Murphy added. "We do not block
calls, contrary to popular belief! We have a
high volume of calls, and only one phone."
Rivera said that 5-SURE is working to in
troduce a number of changes to improve ef
ficiency and is incorporating user feedback.
They've already been given one car, which
has greatly reduced wait time, and they're
trying to get more.

Rivera said that they currently have an
intern from Santa Clara doing research
about escort services across the nation who
has found that Stanford has one of the best
and only campus door-to-door safety servic
es.

Ariana Koblitz 'l2 said she appreciated
the option of safe transportation.
"As a girl, there are times that I could
walk home alone, but knowing that I have
the choice to get a ride is comforting."

freshman year and became manager at the
beginning of last quarter.
"I like the community service aspect of
the job," added Corey Murphy 'l2, who
began driving for 5-SURE this year. "One of
the best parts of the job is that as a whole, all
of the employees are committed to provid
ing safety and improving the community."

5-SURE is not blind to this faction of
their clientele who use the service primarily
for convenience, however.
"It's not frustrating when we're not busy,"
Rivera said. "Do we call it abuse of the sys
tem? Or do we need to change our mission
statement to reflect the needs of the cam
pus?"

These questions are a subject of internal
debate, as 5-SURE staff members discuss
whether to keep their focus on safety or to
expand the official goals of the service to in
clude transporting students irrespective of
that issue.

As things stand now, higher-risk students
are given a higher priority for rides, but 5-
SURE employees never refuse service.
"One of our biggest frustrations right
now is trying to find a mission statement that
balances our community service aspect to
our taxi-service aspect," Murphy said.
Rivera added that the group is trying to
introduce new policies to focus on their orig
inal aim to provide safety to the campus. One
such policy is adding a limit to the size of
groups they would pick up, as large groups of
students traveling across campus aren't at
high risk.
Whatever their purpose, 5-SURE's serv
ices are certainly in high demand. During the
weekend. Murphy said that she's never seen
more than a 20-minute time span without a
phone call.
On a 5-SURE ride, it's common to hear
the drivers constantly talking into their ra
dios, being directed to pick-ups all across
campus. 5-SURE drivers pride themselves
on their friendly and approachable de
meanor they say this sets them apart from
similar services on other campuses.
But it isn't always easy to maintain this
pleasant demeanor. Murphy and Rivera
both spoke of the occasional unpleasantness
of dealing with drunk and angry students
and of cleaning the carts back at Old Union
after students vomit.

But they also have the chance to connect
with students who may be at their most vul
nerable.

Rivera once picked up an inebriated but
very bulky, muscular athlete who, on the drive
home, completely broke down about his rela
tionship woes. He felt pressured by his friends
to treat a recent ex-girlfriend poorly, he said,

but really he still cared about her.
"It was a very sweet, human moment,"
Rivera said with a smile.

Murphy added that student appreciation
of the service is another perk of the job.
"When people are very vocal about being
thankful, it's incredibly gratifying," Murphy
said. "It's the best part of the job."
But students using the service aren't al
ways happy.
"Our biggest complaints are about wait
time," Rivera said. "People get really angry
on the phone because of unreliable wait
times. But when people take long to come
out, it's really out of our control."
"We can't really afford to have eight peo
ple on call we do the best we can with our
funding," Murphy added. "We do not block
calls, contrary to popular belief! We have a
high volume of calls, and only one phone."
Rivera said that 5-SURE is working to in
troduce a number of changes to improve ef
ficiency and is incorporating user feedback.
They've already been given one car, which
has greatly reduced wait time, and they're
trying to get more.

Rivera said that they currently have an
intern from Santa Clara doing research
about escort services across the nation who
has found that Stanford has one of the best
and only campus door-to-door safety servic
es.

Ariana Koblitz 'l2 said she appreciated
the option of safe transportation.
"As a girl, there are times that I could
walk home alone, but knowing that I have
the choice to get a ride is comforting."
