## EDITORIAL You Cut will not solve nation's budget woes 
### 
One week ago, Eric Cantor, the Repub
lican House whip, launched the You-
Cut initiative, a program designed to
allow voters to decide via the internet which
government expenses they would like cut
from the budget. This weekly online program
is the first of its kind, and its supporters
promise that it will help eliminate runaway
government spending. This is a bold move by
Republicans in Congress to tackle over
spending and the budget deficit. Even so, the
You Cut initiative will likely fall short of its
intended goal of a meaningful reduction in
government spending.
The first spending cut chosen by the
280,000 online voters is the "New Non-Re
formed Welfare Program," as Republicans
call it. With less than 30 percent of the vote,
Republicans will move to eliminate this pro
gram aimed at providing additional funding
to low income citizens. While Cantor argues
that this decision reflects the will of the peo
ple, this is a prime example of how the You-
Cut program is fundamentally flawed. The
majority of Americans that receive direct
benefits from welfare programs cannot be
expected to vote online because these low
income families generally have less access to
the Internet. In this way, the You Cut program
disenfranchises low-income citizens from
participating in the formation of budgetary
policies.

rectly benefits or does not benefit
themselves. This is precisely why, as a repre
sentative democracy, we elect officials who
can gather the diverging interests of their
constituents and make informed decisions.
This program is a shallow attempt to create
the illusion of direct voter input under a com
pletely partisan presentation of the proposed
cuts. The only way the budget deficit is going
to be reduced is by Congress working to
make concerted, long-term changes in gov
ernment spending and revenue policies. The
You Cut program cannot be counted on to
provide any lasting solutions for our nation's
spending problems, and will probably
amount to little more than a distraction in the
long-run.
Presenting taxpayers with a list of menial
costs to cut on a weekly basis is no step to
ward fixing the country's current spending
problems. Comprehensive change is needed
and this program does not even come close to
achieving that change. By reducing our coun
try's serious budget deficit to an American
Idol-like weekly vote, Cantor is not promot
ing reduced spending, but providing small
minorities (two-tenths of one percent of the
US population voted for the welfare cut) an
opportunity to eliminate potentially vital
programs. If Representative Cantor consid
ers this spending reform, he is really thinking
small. He would be doing the American peo
ple a much greater service by dedicating his
time to working with other members of Con
gress to make significant reductions to the
federal budget.

Furthermore, the You Cut program trusts
that voters will vote with the good of the
country in mind, when in reality most voters
will make their decisions based on what di-
