# GET IT RIGHT
## Too much Information? 
### Erica Morgan 
President Obama delivered an empow
ering commencement speech to gradu
ating Hampton University students on
May 1. With the sagacity of Spiderman's
Uncle Ben, he administered the cliche "with
great power comes great responsibility"
pump-up prose and paid some lip service to
America's preeminence, the American "in
sistence on pursuing a dream" and the glory
of democracy. The irony of Obama delivering
a speech touting the glory of a free society
becomes clear when one examines his words
a little more carefully. The president man
aged to weave the following into his com
mencement address:

Meanwhile, you're coming of age in a 24/7
media environment that bombards us with all
kinds of content and exposes us to all kinds of
arguments, some of which don't rank all that
high on the truth meter. With iPods and iPads,
Xboxes and Play Stations, information be
comes a distraction, a diversion, a form of en
tertainment, rather than a tool of empower
ment. All of this is not only putting new pres
sures on you; it is putting new pressures on our
country and on our democracy.
I wonder if Stanford students feel unduly
pressured by the deluge of media informa
tion. Are we, as the president implies, divert
ed and distracted by the onslaught of news
sources? Are we incapable of isolating cru
cial arguments when bombarded by 24/7
media? Obama continued his claim:

With so many voices clamoring for atten
tion on blogs, on cable, on talk radio, it can be
difficult, at times, to sift through it all; to know
what to believe; to figure out who's telling the
truth and who's not. Let's face it, even some of
the craziest claims can quickly gain traction.
Pve had some experience with that myself.
Statements like these bring to mind a
White House blog (more irony?) post in Au
gust of 2009, which requested that the public
report "disinformation" about health insur
ance reform to the government. The blog
post reads, "These rumors often travel just
below the surface via chain emails or through
casual conversation. Since we can't keep
track of all of [the disinformation] here at the
White House, we're asking for your help. If
you get an email or see something on the web
about health insurance that seems fishy, send
it to flag@whitehouse.gov."
The message is clear: information present
ed on blogs, cable and talk radio is problem
atic and "diverting," unless of course it is an
alyzed by the Obama administration,
stripped of critical content and stamped with
presidential approval. It has been decreed
that we ought not question the ineffable wis
dom of the White House. In fact, we must re
port our fellow citizens when they dare to
contradict "the truth" disseminated by the
president. Remember, students, challenging
authority is only permitted during Republi
can presidencies.
I argue that there are few things more cen
tral to democracy than different voices clam-

oring for our attention. The forums may be
blogs, cable and talk radio, but doesn't this
allow for a greater number of viewpoints to
be heard? The freedom of the press and the
availability of varied and conflicting perspec
tives is crucial to keeping debate alive and
providing some kind of balance to political
discourse. Certainly false information sur
faces from time to time, but the perils of an
occasional inaccuracy pale in comparison to
the prospect of a state-controlled media.
Obama's comments seem out of place in a
nation that condemns China and Iran for
censoring free information transfer. Secre
tary of State Hillary Clinton suggested earli
er this year that China must answer for its be
havior with Google: "We look to the Chinese
government for an explanation."
During the summer of 2009, the U.S. State
Department asked Twitter to delay a net
work upgrade to allow Iranian protesters to
continue using the service to communicate
freely.
And yet our president claims that these
resources are not tools of empowerment, but
forms of entertainment. Which is why I am
skeptical of his closing remarks to the gradu
ates of Hampton: "And it now falls to you, the
Class of 2010, to write the next chapter in
America's story..."
The Class of 2010 may write the story, but
surely Obama will not approve unless it is
first fact-checked by the administration and
published on a government approved web
site.
