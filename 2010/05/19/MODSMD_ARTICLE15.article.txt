# STRANGELY CHARMING
## The 						Final Frontier 
### Jack Cackler 
This past weekend, I had the great pleas
ure of witnessing the Space Shuttle At
lantis ascend to the heavens one final
time before its permanent retirement. After
134 missions and thirty long and eventful
years, NASA will retire its other two shuttles.
Discovery and Endeavour, by November.
While the shuttle has been the defining
NASA program over the last few decades, its
retirement ushers in a bold new era of space
exploration.
I watched the launch on the water just off
the coast of Kennedy Space Center, and the
experience was truly awe-inspiring. While I
had seen launches on television before, see
ing shuttle pixels really only captures a small
portion of the experience. Though I was sev
eral miles away, the light of the rockets was
blinding in away Francis Scott Key could
have never imagined. While this launch was
during the day, those who have seen launch
es at night report the entire sky brightening
as if a second sun were rising. Another sur
prise was that, given the distance to the shut
tle, the thunderous sound of the engines took
several seconds to reach my ears. As a result,
the ignition itself was oddly tranquil, a silent
fireball soaring into the sky, followed by a
deafening boom and a fierce wind. The
thought that there were people inside what
was essentially a controlled explosion was
mind-blowing, and the knowledge that hu
mans could create something so wondrous
was a testament to the ingenuity and tireless
efforts of some of the world's best scientists.

But in the grand scheme of things, the
shuttle represents only the dawn of space ex
ploration. As majestic as it is, the shuttle has
rarely been farther than 500 miles from the
Earth's surface, and is usually about as far
from the Earth as Los Angeles is from Stan
ford. A cornerstone of NASA's mission is to

"pioneer the future of space exploration, sci
entific discovery, and aeronautics research."
Flying in low-earth orbit, forty years after
landing on the moon, no longer qualifies as
exploring space. Corporations like SpaceX,
Orbital Sciences and Blue Origin are rapidly
proving to the world that putting people and
equipment in orbit can now be done quickly
and effectively with private funding. By al
lowing private companies to shoulder the
burden of low earth orbit launches, NASA is
afforded the ability of returning to its mission
of advancing human understanding by ex
ploring the rest of the cosmos, and learning
more about our own planet.
It seems almost baffling that the federal
government should spend 99.5 percent of its
budget on this planet, and the slim remainder
on the rest of the universe. Kidding aside,
with the heydays of massive Apollo era
budgets gone, the decision of how best to
spend its limited resources is no easy task for
NASA. Recognizing this, a commission of
public and private leaders in the space com
munity headed by former Lockheed Martin
CEO Norm Augustine, and including Stan
ford alumna Sally Ride '7B, gathered last year
to advise the President and Congress on how
NASA should best proceed. While many op
tions were debated, the main takeaway of the
last year of talks is that NASA's overall budg

et has been marginally increased to help
allow for refocused efforts in science, and
plans for future long-term space flight. Most
excitingly, a manned mission to Mars now
has real funding for the first time.
The past year has been extremely suc
cessful for NASA, whose spacecraft verified
the existence of water on the Moon and ad
vanced human understanding of climate
change. Most recently, NASA satellites
have been instrumental in monitoring and
managing the gulf oil disaster, as well as the
recent disasters in Haiti and Chile. As in
credible as the Space Shuttle has been, ex
ploring new worlds and protecting our own
may be a far more effective use of limited
resources.

I am incredibly glad that I had the oppor
tunity to witness a shuttle launch, and I
would highly recommend watching one of
the two remaining launches to anyone who
has never seen one. The Space Shuttle has
been a powerful agent of discovery over the
past few decades, and has played a key role in
advancing human potential in the universe. I
can only hope that the brave astronauts who
gave their lives on Challenger and Columbia
are looking down with pride at how we have
recovered from tragedy, and are still advanc
ing the light of knowledge into the future.
One of the best ways to measure the impact
of lives in our brief journeys on (or off) this
world, is not in how much we accomplish, but
in what doors we open for those after us to
achieve. Under that metric, after two more
missions, the Shuttle can finally rest proudly
in the knowledge that the age of space explo
ration has only just begun.
