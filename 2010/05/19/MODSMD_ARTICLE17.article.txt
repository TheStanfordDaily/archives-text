## Caliparito NBA makes little sense 
### Wyndam Makowsky Between the lines 
With apologies to De
lonte West, the most
compelling Leßron
James story of the
past week has been
the possibility of John Calipari leaving
Kentucky and joining the King at his
next NBA location. The college game's
most notorious coach teaming up with
the world's best player to create a sup
posed dream team such ideas usual
ly exist only in our imagination.
And there they should stay: it does
n't make sense.
Let's first acknowledge, in honor of
Pete Carroll, that Calipari's first at
tempt at coaching in the NBA did not
go swimmingly. He went from Massa
chusetts to the New Jersey Nets, where
he was fired in less than two and a half
years. His overall NBA coaching
record? 72-112.
But more important are Calipari's
coaching philosophy and ability.
Calipari's attack is essentially the
dribble-drive motion offense, which fo
cuses on the talent of individual play
makers rather than the mechanisms of
the team as a whole. This works well in
college and high school, where there
are large gaps in athleticism, but in the
NBA, those disparities are lessened. As
a result, it's rare that you'll see an NBA
team use the dribble-drive motion of
fense as its predominant offensive
strategy; rather, it's an alternative to
normal sets.
As for his acumen on the sideline:
Calipari is no slouch, but he's not a ge
nius, either. His best talent has always
been for recruiting, not for actual in
game coaching prowess, and the latter
would have to be his focus in the NBA.
Let's not forget that our own Johnny
Dawkins, in just his second year as a
head coach and managing a severely
talent-deficient roster, entirely un
dressed Calipari in Cancun last year.
Fundamentally, too, Calipari's
teams are known far more for their ath
letic ability than for their mechanics.
With both his Memphis and Kentucky
teams, there was a perpetual, ominous
feeling that the wheels would come off
There's only so much you can rely on
natural talent before a sound squad ex
poses your flaws. In the 2008 National
Championship game, Memphis missed
four of five free throws down the
stretch and lost in overtime; in the 2010
Elite Eight, Kentucky hit just 55 per
cent of its free throws and 12.5 percent
of its three-point attempts in a close
loss.

So let's reexamine the Leßron
issue. For five years, hehasbeen playing
for Mike Brown, a coach whose philos
ophy can best be described as "have
four players stand around and let Le-
Bron do what he wants." The results
have been fine for Leßron's stat line,
but it hasn't brought Cleveland a cham
pionship. The problem is that one of the
core aspects of the dribble-drive mo
tion offense is to allow the ball-handler
often, Leßron to create for him
self while the other players do what
they can to get open in case he needs to
dish the rock. It's an oversimplification,
but doesn't that sound strikingly like
what he was doing before? Combine
that with, again, Calipari's less-than
amazing in-game coaching, and you
have a situation that doesn't appear en
tirely different from what has tran
spired in Cleveland over the past few
seasons.

I'd imagine that the man behind this
yet-to-be-realized partnership, NBA
power broker William Wesley, believes
that Calipari's talent as a collegiate re
cruiter can be translated to the profes
sional ranks, where he'll be able to at
tract big-name free agents to join him
and Leßron in whatever locale they
choose. Remember, a large part of the
problem in Cleveland was not just that
the coaching was mediocre, but that the
front office never built an adequate
much less above-average support
ing cast for Leßron.
But there are significant disparities
between college and the NBA, many of
which are entirely obvious on the sur
face, There is a limited amount of
money that can be spent on free agents,
and not everyone is available. Particu
larly with guaranteed contracts, the
strategy for signing players is dramati
cally different than that of inking a high
schooler to a letter of intent. Decisions
made in the present can have drastic
ramifications a decade down the road.
The point is this: strip away the

name, and what do you have? A coach
who failed in his first stint in the NBA,
and who has a talent and a style far bet
ter suited for the collegiate game than
the professional one.
The appeal escapes me.
