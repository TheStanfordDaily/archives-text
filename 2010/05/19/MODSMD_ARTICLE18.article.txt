# INDIVIDUAL SUCCESSES

### ANARGHYA VARDHANA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
This weekend, the Stanford track and field
team traveled to Berkeley for the Pac-10 Cham
pionships, facing some of the top athletes in the
country, as well as the formidable running pow
erhouse, the University of Oregon.
Day one of the meet was comprised of
mostly trials, although there were finals in a
few events. The Cardinal exhibited its depth on
Saturday, putting people on the podium in the
few events that were in the final round of com
petition.

The most impressive finish for Stanford was
the men's distance sweeping the 10k, the last
event of the day. Coming in third was junior Jake
Riley, with a time of 29:10.93. Junior Elliott
Heath was slightly in front of him, finishing with
a time 0f29:10.86. Winning the race, with his first
Pac-10 event title, was sophomore Chris Der
rick, who won the 10k with a time of 29:10.80.
Clearly a close race, the three men ran together
throughout, and very barely finished at different
times. It was a great victory for the Cardinal to
be able to score so many points in one event.
"It was awesome to sweep the 10k on Satur
day night with Jake and Chris," Heath said.
"That was something that we had talked about
a lot as a group leading up to the race. Seeing as

most of the events were prelims on Saturday, we
really wanted to get a big chunk of points in the
10k to gain some momentum for the team lead
ing into Sunday."
Another point-scoring distance event for the
men was the 3,000-meter steeplechase. Junior
JT Sullivan ran a fast race to make it to the podi
um, placing third with a time of 8:43.69. Also
scoring points was sophomore Ben Johnson,
who finished in seventh with a time of 8:59.33.
At the Pac-10 Championships, the first eight po
sitions score points for their respective teams.
On the women's side, Stanford was led by
the long jumpers. Junior Arantxa King paved
the way, finishing as Pac-10 runner-up in the
event with a mark of 20-9.75. Right behind her
in third place was senior Griffin Matthew, who
leaped a distance of 20-5.75. Finally, in fourth
place was junior Whitney Liehr, who had a
mark of 20-2.25.
The female 10k runners also scored points
for the team, with junior Stephanie Marcy fin
ishing in third with a time 0f33:41.57, and senior
Kate Niehaus finishing in sixth with a time of
33:55.33.
Another distance runner scoring points was
senior Madeleine O'Meara, who placed fifth in
the 3,000-meter steeplechase with a time of
10:24.06.
Day two of the meet brought Stanford more

event victories, with Derrick capturing his sec
ond Pac-10 Championship title. Derrick came
back on the second day to run another impres
sive run, winning the 5k with a time of 13:43.69.
Also with an impressive finish in the 10k was
Heath, who once again placed second, a few sec

onds behind Derrick, with a time of 13:45.22.
Riley also placed in the sk, finishing in fifth with
a time of 13:48.68.
Sophomore Dylan Ferris also fared well in
the distances, placing fourth in the 1,500 with a
time of 3:42.73.
The result of the 10k, 5k and 1,500 meters
proved that the Stanford men are a dominating
factor in the long distance arena, and will most
likely have a great chance to succeed at the
NCAA Outdoor Championships coming up in
a few weeks.
Sophomore Amaechi Morton had the other
big performance of the day, smashing his own
school record in the 400-meter hurdles, placing
second in the event with a time of 48.94. Morton
became the first Stanford hurdler to go under 50
seconds he not only did that, but he broke 49
seconds as well. Winning the event was Wash
ington's Jeshua Anderson, who is the two-time
defending national champion in the event. An
derson ran a time of 48.63.
"This weekend was amazing for me," Mor
ton said. "I was definitely nervous about the
race, but I pulled myself together and competed
well, and I definitely am looking forward to the
rest of the season."

Another distance runner scoring points was
senior Madeleine O'Meara, who placed fifth in
the 3,000-meter steeplechase with a time of
10:24.06.
Day two of the meet brought Stanford more

event victories, with Derrick capturing his sec
ond Pac-10 Championship title. Derrick came
back on the second day to run another impres
sive run, winning the 5k with a time of 13:43.69.
Also with an impressive finish in the 10k was
Heath, who once again placed second, a few sec

onds behind Derrick, with a time of 13:45.22.
Riley also placed in the sk, finishing in fifth with
a time of 13:48.68.
Sophomore Dylan Ferris also fared well in
the distances, placing fourth in the 1,500 with a
time of 3:42.73.
The result of the 10k, 5k and 1,500 meters
proved that the Stanford men are a dominating
factor in the long distance arena, and will most
likely have a great chance to succeed at the
NCAA Outdoor Championships coming up in
a few weeks.
Sophomore Amaechi Morton had the other
big performance of the day, smashing his own
school record in the 400-meter hurdles, placing
second in the event with a time of 48.94. Morton
became the first Stanford hurdler to go under 50
seconds he not only did that, but he broke 49
seconds as well. Winning the event was Wash
ington's Jeshua Anderson, who is the two-time
defending national champion in the event. An
derson ran a time of 48.63.

race, but I pulled myself together and competed
well, and I definitely am looking forward to the
rest of the season."

Sophomore Chris Derrick was one of multiple Cardinal runners to turn in a
strong performance at the Pac-10 championships this past weekend, leading
a Stanford sweep of the 1 Ok race with a time of 29:10.80.
This weekend, the Stanford track and field
team traveled to Berkeley for the Pac-10 Cham
pionships, facing some of the top athletes in the
country, as well as the formidable running pow
erhouse, the University of Oregon.
Day one of the meet was comprised of
mostly trials, although there were finals in a
few events. The Cardinal exhibited its depth on
Saturday, putting people on the podium in the
few events that were in the final round of com
petition.

The most impressive finish for Stanford was
the men's distance sweeping the 10k, the last
event of the day. Coming in third was junior Jake
Riley, with a time of 29:10.93. Junior Elliott
Heath was slightly in front of him, finishing with
a time 0f29:10.86. Winning the race, with his first
Pac-10 event title, was sophomore Chris Der
rick, who won the 10k with a time of 29:10.80.
Clearly a close race, the three men ran together
throughout, and very barely finished at different
times. It was a great victory for the Cardinal to
be able to score so many points in one event.
"It was awesome to sweep the 10k on Satur
day night with Jake and Chris," Heath said.
"That was something that we had talked about
a lot as a group leading up to the race. Seeing as

most of the events were prelims on Saturday, we
really wanted to get a big chunk of points in the
10k to gain some momentum for the team lead
ing into Sunday."
Another point-scoring distance event for the
men was the 3,000-meter steeplechase. Junior
JT Sullivan ran a fast race to make it to the podi
um, placing third with a time of 8:43.69. Also
scoring points was sophomore Ben Johnson,
who finished in seventh with a time of 8:59.33.
At the Pac-10 Championships, the first eight po
sitions score points for their respective teams.
On the women's side, Stanford was led by
the long jumpers. Junior Arantxa King paved
the way, finishing as Pac-10 runner-up in the
event with a mark of 20-9.75. Right behind her
in third place was senior Griffin Matthew, who
leaped a distance of 20-5.75. Finally, in fourth
place was junior Whitney Liehr, who had a
mark of 20-2.25.
The female 10k runners also scored points
for the team, with junior Stephanie Marcy fin
ishing in third with a time 0f33:41.57, and senior
Kate Niehaus finishing in sixth with a time of
33:55.33.
Another distance runner scoring points was
senior Madeleine O'Meara, who placed fifth in
the 3,000-meter steeplechase with a time of
10:24.06.
Day two of the meet brought Stanford more

event victories, with Derrick capturing his sec
ond Pac-10 Championship title. Derrick came
back on the second day to run another impres
sive run, winning the 5k with a time of 13:43.69.
Also with an impressive finish in the 10k was
