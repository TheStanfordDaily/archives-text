# Are Stanford athletes really different?
## 
### Mike Lazarus 
If you haven't heard by now,
the Washington Nationals
called up former Stanford
closer Drew Storen from its
Triple-A affiliate.
At Stanford, Storen was simply
dominant. Last year, the draft-eli
gible sophomore led the team in
both wins and saves. As a fresh
man, the lowa native anchored the
Cardinal bullpen in Stanford's run
to the College World Series, earn
ing two saves in the Super Region
al against Cal State Fullerton.
When Storen was the 10th
overall pick in last year's draft by
the Nationals, baseball experts
threw out words like "smart," "grit
ty," "knows how to win" and "self
less." After his promotion this
weekend, those words once again
resurfaced.
I'm not saying Storen isn't any
of those things, but those are the
same words I heard when Toby
Gerhart was drafted in April. And
the same words when Robin and
Brook Lopez were drafted. And
the same words when Stanford
catcher Jason Castro was drafted
two years ago.

And they'll probably be the
same words when Andrew Luck
gets drafted (hopefully in two
years, not next year cross your
fingers).
What is it with Cardinal ath
letes? Is the Stanford Athletic De
partment that good at churning
out the ultimate team player
the hard-worker, do-whatever-it
takes, keeps-the-clubhouse-loose
type player?
It could be, but it's doubtful.
What Stanford excels at is sell
ing a brand. The university sells its
students as innovators, as entre
preneurs, as the world's next lead
ers. There's a reason you came here
over other top-ranked schools.
The Athletic Department sells
its athletes as the complete pack
age — great on the field, in the
locker room, in the video room
and in the weight room. In short, a
coach's dream.
Just as when a white basketball
player steps on the court and is in

stantly pinned as the max-effort
guy, diving for loose balls and hus
tling back on defense, when an ath
lete gets the Stanford tag slapped
on him, people assume certain
traits about him.
Gerhart talks about how excit
ed he is to play a complementary
role to Adrian Peterson. Brook
Lopez refuses to place blame on
his teammates despite the Nets 12-
70 record. Luck can't stop praising
Gerhart as a "special player" when
asked to explain the team's success
last year.
Stanford athletes, former and
current, apparently are ingrained
with the ability to be the consum
mate professional.
Where these preconceived no
tions come from is unclear. It
seems just as likely that Stanford
athletes would be perceived as elit
ist, spoiled and too good for their
academically inferior teammates.
No, these people who have been
the best at what they have done
since an early age academics and
athletics suddenly transform
into Mr. Modest the instant draft
pundits start talking about them.

The question stands, does Stan
ford turn its athletes into the
dream teammate, or do the media
simply overplay the Stanford
angle?
It seems logical that Stanford
could have an effect in hammering
out the ego in the athletes. After
dominating their high schools, the
student-athletes come to Stanford
and are quickly humbled by the
high intellectual and athletic level
of their peers. They quickly realize
they are not as special as they
thought they were.
Yet for every Gerhart and Cas
tro, there is a Tiger Woods or a
John McEnroe a Cardinal ath
lete who thinks he is above the
rules. Granted, neither Woods nor
McEnroe finished his degree or
plays a team sport, but you would
be hard-pressed to say their time
at Stanford deflated their egos in
the least bit.
So which one is it?
