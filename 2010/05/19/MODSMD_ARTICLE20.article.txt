### CHRIS JUHNKE DESK EDITOR 
A thrilling season for the Stanford women's
lacrosse team came to an end on Saturday in Har
risonburg, Va. as the Cardinal (15-6) lost 9-8 in the
first round of the NCAA Tournament to No. 5 seed
James Madison (17-2).
Junior midfielder Leslie Foard led the Card with
three goals, while teammate sophomore Catherine
Swanson tallied two of her own. Junior goalie Annie
Read also recorded seven saves in the losing effort.
Stanford outshot the Dukes 26-24, but was unable
to come away with the win as a goal by JMU fresh
man attacker Casey Ancarrow gave the Dukes the
lead with 11:35 left and ended up being the game
winner.
Regardless of the outcome, the Cardinal played
well in its first NCAA appearance since 2006.
The match got off to a great start for Stanford, as
Swanson and junior attacker Sarah Flynn scored
the first two goals and helped the Card jump out to
an early lead.
After three goals by JMU and one goal by Foard,
the score was tied at three apiece with 16:05 left in
the first half. Then Stanford went on a run, which
saw it gain a three-goal advantage in under five min
utes.
First, senior attacker Dana Lindsay powered a
shot by JMU goalie Morgan Kelly, which was
promptly followed by another goal by Foard a mere
22 seconds later. Another goal by Foard, her third of
the half, put the Cardinal up 6-3 with just over 10
minutes remaining in the half.
Each team scored once more before halftime
and the Cardinal went into the locker room with a
7-4 lead.

The Stanford women's lacrosse team, ranked No. 15, saw its season come to an end on Saturday, narrowly losing to No. 5 James Madison
in the NCAA Tournament. The Card had a 7-4 lead at half time but was unable to hold off the Dukes, and ended up losing 9-8.
out really strong," said head coach
Amy Bokker at the postgame
NCAA press conference. "We were
unable to sustain that energy the
whole game."
With a great first half behind
them, the Cardinal women came out
flat in the second half and were un
able to reestablish their dominance.
The Dukes took full advantage of
this and controlled possession for the
beginning of the half on the way to
scoring three times in the opening six
minutes of the half.
The Dukes' defense continued to
stymie Stanford, and another JMU
goal with 13:36 left in the game put
them on top for the first time in the
match.

However, the game wasn't over,
as Swanson tied the game up again
with her second goal on the day, an
unassisted score just minutes after
JMU took the lead.

Unfortunately for the Card, the
score wouldn't remain tied for long as
Anacarrow, who led the Dukes with

three goals, put JMU back on top with
just over 10 minutes remaining.
The remainder of the game pro
vided some incredible action and
outstanding goalkeeping as Read de
fended the Stanford goal from four
JMU shots. Kelly, not to be outdone,
turned in her own incredible per
formance, including five saves on
shots by the Stanford offense.
The final save came on a shot by
junior midfielder Lauren Schmidt
with 2:02 left that looked like it
would effectively end the game, but
Foard intercepted a pass with 24 sec
onds left and gave Stanford a glim
mer of hope.

The Card called a timeout, and
with just 10 seconds left,Flynn fired a
shot wide and the game was over.
"I think they did a really good job,
they came out really hard," Schmidt
said at the postgame press conference
of the JMU defense. "Their goalie is
awesome. We were just having a hard
time getting around them and Swan
son came up big, but they played real
ly hard."
Kelly, the JMU goalie, notched
seven saves in the second half after
having only three in the first and
proved to be a huge factor in the win
for the Dukes.

The loss wasn't all bad for the Car
dinal, however. Stanford outplayed
one of the best teams in the nation for
the whole first half and showed great
resilience after letting its lead slip
away in the second.
Although Stanford will graduate
eight seniors this year, the seniors end
their careers in only the program's
second NCAA Tournament appear
ance.
