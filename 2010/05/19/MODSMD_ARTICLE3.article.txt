## Jaczko: U.S. energy tied to Congress Nuclear plants 'safer than eve;' says commission chief 
### ELIZABETH TITUS MANAGING EDITOR 
The growth of nuclear energy in
the United States depends on if or
how Congress will regulate carbon
emissions, said Chair of the U.S. Nu
clear Regulatory Commission Gre
gory B. Jaczko in a talk to energy stu
dents at Stanford on Tuesday.
The commission, of which Jaczko
was named chair by President
Obama last year, is charged with reg
ulating the civilian use of nuclear ma
terial. Jaczko was speaking as part of
the Stanford Energy Seminar series.
"The future of nuclear power in
this country will probably hinge
more than anything else on what
Congress decides to do about cli
mate change and about regulating
carbon," Jaczko said.
With the construction cost of one
new reactor ranging from $6 billion
to $lO billion (the U.S. Department
of Energy has $lB billion in loan
guarantees set aside for all construc
tion), few now are willing to finance
nuclear projects, Jaczko said.
"It's not the kind of money that
anybody on Wall Street is willing to
lend to a utility, and it's not the kind
of money that a lot of utilities right
now are willing to put up on their
own," he said. But Congress, to
whom the commission reports, could
change that.
"If climate legislation happens,
there'll be a price for carbon," Jaczko
said. "It will probably make nuclear
more cost-competitive and that $6 to
$lO billion may seem more palatable
to some utility executives relative to
the cost of other types of generating
sources. So fundamentally, that's
what this debate is going to come
down to."
Jaczko described today's nuclear
power landscape as "a far cry from
where we were 10 years ago" and
earlier, when accidents at Three
Mile Island in Pennsylvania in 1979
and abroad at Chernobyl in 1986
shook the public's trust in the safety
of nuclear power. Those events, and
the subsequent tightening of safety
regulations for U.S. plants, brought
the construction of new plants to a
