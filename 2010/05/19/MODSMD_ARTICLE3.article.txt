## Jaczko: U.S. energy tied to Congress Nuclear plants 'safer than eve;' says commission chief 
### ELIZABETH TITUS MANAGING EDITOR 
The growth of nuclear energy in
the United States depends on if or
how Congress will regulate carbon
emissions, said Chair of the U.S. Nu
clear Regulatory Commission Gre
gory B. Jaczko in a talk to energy stu
dents at Stanford on Tuesday.
The commission, of which Jaczko
was named chair by President
Obama last year, is charged with reg
ulating the civilian use of nuclear ma
terial. Jaczko was speaking as part of
the Stanford Energy Seminar series.
"The future of nuclear power in
this country will probably hinge
more than anything else on what
Congress decides to do about cli
mate change and about regulating
carbon," Jaczko said.
With the construction cost of one
new reactor ranging from $6 billion
to $lO billion (the U.S. Department
of Energy has $lB billion in loan
guarantees set aside for all construc
tion), few now are willing to finance
nuclear projects, Jaczko said.
"It's not the kind of money that
anybody on Wall Street is willing to
lend to a utility, and it's not the kind
of money that a lot of utilities right
now are willing to put up on their
own," he said. But Congress, to
whom the commission reports, could
change that.
"If climate legislation happens,
there'll be a price for carbon," Jaczko
said. "It will probably make nuclear
more cost-competitive and that $6 to
$lO billion may seem more palatable
to some utility executives relative to
the cost of other types of generating
sources. So fundamentally, that's
what this debate is going to come
down to."
Jaczko described today's nuclear
power landscape as "a far cry from
where we were 10 years ago" and
earlier, when accidents at Three
Mile Island in Pennsylvania in 1979
and abroad at Chernobyl in 1986
shook the public's trust in the safety
of nuclear power. Those events, and
the subsequent tightening of safety
regulations for U.S. plants, brought
the construction of new plants to a
trickle.
"This high level of safety and se
curity is not cheap," Jaczko said.
But today something of a resur
gence is underway in the United
States, where the commission is re
viewing 22 applications for new
plants to add to the 104 already oper
ating, he said.
"There's been a lot of work done
by the NRC over the last several
decades to put in place a system that
I firmly believe makes nuclear
power plants safer than they've ever
been," Jaczko said.
He also outlined the history of the
commission, which he said did not al
ways know how strictly to regulate
civilian nuclear activity. It began as
the Atomic Energy Commission in
1954, tasked with both promoting
and regulating nuclear energy. It was
in that year that the commission's
chairman, Lewis Strauss, famously
predicted that "our children will
enjoy in their homes electrical ener
gy too cheap to meter."
After coming under public attack
for insufficiently rigorous safety
guidelines, Congress in 1974 split the
commission into two parts: the U.S.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission
and another agency that would even
tually become the U.S. Department
of Energy.
The commission spent the next
several decades gaining what Jaczko
called "operational experience"
sometimes painfully, including dur
ing the 1975 accidental fire at the
Brown's Ferry,Tenn., plant, where an
employee using a candle to search
for air leaks set fire to a cable seal.
The commission also began evalu
ating public health risks posed by nu
clear reactors. Jaczko projected one
guideline on the wall of the auditori
um on Tuesday: "The risk to the pop
ulation in the area of a nuclear power
plant of cancer fatalities that might
result from nuclear power plant oper
ations should not exceed one-tenth of
the percent of the sum of cancer fatal
ity risks resulting from other causes."
Forming such guidelines, he said,
marked the "beginnings of risk-in
formed regulation." Making princi
ples like redundancy, diversity and
"defense in-depth" central to the
commission's problem-solving ex-

pectations of nuclear license applica
tions was also key, he said.
Jaczko drew parallels to U.S. oil
drilling oversight, which has drawn
scrutiny in the wake of the Gulf oil
spill that began last month. He point
ed to the U.S. Mineral Management
Service, which both regulates and
promotes oil drilling, similar to the
Atomic Energy Commission's role
in the nuclear industry 50 years ago.
"One of the things you've heard
people say immediately after the
Gulf spill was, 'We need to split those
functions,"' he said.

"A member of Congress said to
me just last week, 'We need to do a
Three Mile Island-type commission
to study what went wrong in the
Gulf,"' Jaczko added. "Those were

things that we did 30 years ago."
Returning to the prospect of
more nuclear reactor construction
on the horizon for the United States,
Jaczko said again that politics would
largely determine the industry's di
rection, but that his commission's
role would remain central.
"If we don't ensure that the cur
rent fleet of operating reactors is
safe ... then there will be no nuclear
expansion in this country," he said.
The talk was co-sponsored by the
Woods Institute for the Environ
ment, the Precourt Institute for En
ergy and the Global Climate and En
ergy Project.

Jaczko described today's nuclear
power landscape as "a far cry from
where we were 10 years ago" and
earlier, when accidents at Three
Mile Island in Pennsylvania in 1979
and abroad at Chernobyl in 1986
shook the public's trust in the safety
of nuclear power. Those events, and
the subsequent tightening of safety
regulations for U.S. plants, brought
the construction of new plants to a
trickle.
"This high level of safety and se
curity is not cheap," Jaczko said.
But today something of a resur
gence is underway in the United
States, where the commission is re
viewing 22 applications for new
plants to add to the 104 already oper
ating, he said.
"There's been a lot of work done
by the NRC over the last several
decades to put in place a system that
I firmly believe makes nuclear
power plants safer than they've ever
been," Jaczko said.
He also outlined the history of the
commission, which he said did not al
ways know how strictly to regulate
civilian nuclear activity. It began as
the Atomic Energy Commission in
1954, tasked with both promoting
and regulating nuclear energy. It was
in that year that the commission's
chairman, Lewis Strauss, famously
predicted that "our children will
enjoy in their homes electrical ener
gy too cheap to meter."
After coming under public attack
for insufficiently rigorous safety
guidelines, Congress in 1974 split the
commission into two parts: the U.S.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission
and another agency that would even
tually become the U.S. Department
of Energy.
The commission spent the next
several decades gaining what Jaczko
called "operational experience"
sometimes painfully, including dur
ing the 1975 accidental fire at the
Brown's Ferry,Tenn., plant, where an
employee using a candle to search
for air leaks set fire to a cable seal.
The commission also began evalu
ating public health risks posed by nu
clear reactors. Jaczko projected one
guideline on the wall of the auditori
um on Tuesday: "The risk to the pop
ulation in the area of a nuclear power
plant of cancer fatalities that might
result from nuclear power plant oper
ations should not exceed one-tenth of
the percent of the sum of cancer fatal
ity risks resulting from other causes."
Forming such guidelines, he said,
marked the "beginnings of risk-in
formed regulation." Making princi
ples like redundancy, diversity and
"defense in-depth" central to the
commission's problem-solving ex-

pectations of nuclear license applica
tions was also key, he said.
Jaczko drew parallels to U.S. oil
drilling oversight, which has drawn
scrutiny in the wake of the Gulf oil
spill that began last month. He point
ed to the U.S. Mineral Management
Service, which both regulates and
promotes oil drilling, similar to the
Atomic Energy Commission's role
in the nuclear industry 50 years ago.
"One of the things you've heard
people say immediately after the
Gulf spill was, 'We need to split those
functions,"' he said.

"A member of Congress said to
me just last week, 'We need to do a
Three Mile Island-type commission
to study what went wrong in the
Gulf,"' Jaczko added. "Those were

things that we did 30 years ago."
Returning to the prospect of
more nuclear reactor construction
on the horizon for the United States,
Jaczko said again that politics would
largely determine the industry's di
rection, but that his commission's
role would remain central.
"If we don't ensure that the cur
rent fleet of operating reactors is
safe ... then there will be no nuclear
expansion in this country," he said.
The talk was co-sponsored by the
Woods Institute for the Environ
ment, the Precourt Institute for En
ergy and the Global Climate and En
ergy Project.

Chair of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission Gregory B. Jaczko drew
parallels between commercial nuclear energy oversight and oil drilling regulations
on Tuesday. "If we don't ensure that the current fleet of operating reactors
is safe...then there will be no nuclear expansion in this country," he said.
