# Cruz elected Senate chair
## Hawes is deputy chair; outgoing Senate approves upped food caps for green events 
### MARGARET RAWSON 
Tuesday evening marked the changing of
the guard in the ASSU Undergraduate Senate
with back-to-back meetings of the 11th and
12th Senate groups.The outgoing senators met
briefly before the 12th Undergraduate Senate
was sworn in and set the tone for next year,
electing incumbent Senator Michael Cruz 'l2
as chair and Madeline Hawes 'l3 as deputy
chair.
In its brief final meeting, the 11th Under
graduate Senate observed a moment of si
lence to honor Kim Hess, the fondly-remem
bered manager of Late Nite at Lagunita, who
died at home on Saturday.
Before adjourning, the Senate passed three
last pieces of legislation. Voting 5-1, the Senate
passed a bill to update its by-laws and to in
crease funding caps for food for green events.
The Senate unanimously approved the
2011 elections commission: Jonathan Bakke, a
doctoral student in chemical engineering, as
assistant elections commissioner for graduate
elections; Jean Paul Blanchard 'l2 as assistant
elections commissioner for undergraduate
elections; and Stephen Trusheim 'l3 as elec
tions commissioner. All funding bills for the
week were approved.
Offering some final remarks, outgoing Sen
ate Chair Varun Sivaram 'll recognized the
work of Senate Secretary Derek Lu 'll, ASSU
Financial Manager Matt McLaughlin 'OB and
his fellow outgoing senators. To the 12th Un
dergraduate Senate, he said, "Try and stay en
gaged. If each and every one of you stays en
gaged through the end of the year next year,
you will have a fun and productive year."

Outgoing Senator Shelley Gao 'll echoed
Sivaram's message, describing the Senate as "a
tremendous opportunity for you to participate
in the shared governance movement." Wish
ing next year's senators good luck, she urged
them not to take themselves too seriously and
to care about the process as much as their ob
jectives.

"Stay young," said outgoing Senator
Zachary Johnson 'lO, telling the incoming sen
ators to remember why they joined the Senate
and not to get lost in the process.
"It's been real. It's been good. But it ain't
been real good," said Senator Adam Creas
man 'll via Skype. "Stick with the issues, for
get the petty politics, don't waste time and
you'll be fine."

During a recess, Gao said she is excited to
retire after three years of service (two as a sen
ator) and stressed the value of student input in
University decision-making and the "tremen
dous potential for what student government
can do."

In reference to the transition, Sivaram said,
"It's a bit overdue, honestly. I hope the new
Senate can get on their feet quickly."
The 12th Senate did just that after the re
cess, with a lively meeting following its mem
bers' swearing-in by ASSU Vice President
Kelsei Wharton 'l2.

The only senator remaining in office,
Michael Cruz 'l2, received the only nomina
tion for chair and was elected in an open roll
call, with 13 in favor and two abstaining. In a
prepared speech, he emphasized his experi
ence and outlined his plan to work closely with
the three branches of the ASSU and to in
crease communication with the student body

by making Senate meetings more accessible
and offering office hours for students to meet
with senators.

Cruz responded to questions from his fel
low senators on committee selections, ac
countability and improving the image of the
ASSU. When asked to choose between follow
ing what he believes in and building consen
sus, Cruz said he would follow his own beliefs,

though he also said "there will be no executive
orders from the Senate Chair next year," stat
ing that he sees the role as that of a facilitator.
Cruz suggested the Senate reach out to
freshman dorm governments and use an e
mail list to inform the student body. He also
promised full Senate oversight for all discre-
