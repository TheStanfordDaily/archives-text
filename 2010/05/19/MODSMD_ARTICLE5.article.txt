## Volcker: 'sense of urgency' should drive policy look Former Fed chair honored by Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research 
### NIKHIL JOSHI SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Economist Paul Volcker gave a sobering assess
ment of the global financial situation last night, saying
difficult fiscal and economic adjustments are necessary
to rebuild the world economy.
Volcker was at Stanford to receive the inaugural
Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research
(SIEPR) prize for contributions to economic policy.
The time we have is going short, Volcker said, and
the United States needs to adopt a sense of urgency as
its government tries to tackle the fundamental prob
lems that led to a recession.
Volcker, 82, a former chairman of the Federal Re
serve under Presidents Carter and Reagan and current
chairman of the President's Economic Recovery Advi
sory Board, has now taken a role as the wise man of the
global financial system, and was lauded as such by the
institute.
"What do we need in public life right now?" asked
George Shultz, Hoover Institution fellow, chairman of
the committee that awarded Volcker the prize and the
U.S. Secretary of the Treasury under President Nixon.
"We need Paul Volcker."
Shultz and Volcker both served under President

"To a substantial extent, it was those
'non-banks' that were at the epicenter of
the crisis."

Paul Volcker spoke on Tuesday at Stanford. "The fact is the exercise of
effective regulatory and supervisory authority is always difficult on a
national level," said Volcker, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve.
He received SIEPR'S prize for contributions to economic policy.
Reagan, Shultz as Secretary of State.

When he was chairman of the
Fed, Volcker was credited with end
ing the stagflation of the 19705. Now,
he is advocating a tough regimen of
fiscal and economic adjustments to
counter years of unrestrained con
sumption.

"In the United States savings
practically disappeared as consump
tion rose far above past relationships
to national production," Volcker
said. "That consumption was satis
fied by rapidly growing imports from
China and elsewhere in Asia at re
markable cheap prices, helping to
keep inflation well subdued."
Volcker said he knew the remedy
to this growing problem would not
be concerted policy action, but that it
would take a crisis to for real reform
to occur.
The financial industry drew sharp
criticism from Volcker, who derided
its lack of actual economic contribu
tion despite its large profits.
"There was one great growth in
dustry," Volcker said. "Private debt
relative to the GDP nearly tripled in
30 years. Credit default swaps, in
vented little more than a decade ago,
soared at their peak to a $6O trillion
market, exceeding by a factor of 10
the amount of the underlying credits
potentially hedged against default."
The ensuing financial crisis, Vol
cker said, was so deep as to merit the
reconsideration of the basic tenets of
financial theory, a reconsideration
he believes to be absolutely neces
sary.
But a reconsideration of financial
theory is difficult, and building new
regulations will be challenging, ac
cording to Volcker.
"The fact is the exercise of effec
tive regulatory and supervisory au
thority is always difficult on a na
tional level, and those difficulties are
multiplied when dozens of countries
are involved," he said.
In Washington, Volcker has said
the concept of "too big to fail" is one
of the fundamental stressors of the

financial system. He repeated this
point in his remarks on Tuesday, em
phasizing the difference between
commercial banks, which he said are
critical to the economy, and the
bloated non-commercial banks he
said are stressing the regulatory en
vironment.

The "shadow banking system"
that Volcker described was not ade
quately regulated before the crisis,
something he said needs to change.
"To a substantial extent, it was
those 'non-banks' that were at the
epicenter of the crisis," Volcker said.
"Contrary to well-established cen
tral bank practices and with active
government support, those same in
stitutions received massive assis
tance to remain viable."

When the regulatory environ
ment is overhauled, Volcker said,
these non banks should be "free to
fail." By letting the banks fail, and
denying them opportunities for
bailout, the market will discipline
them.

The final piece of financial regu
latory reform, Volcker said, is to
begin answering the serious eco
nomic questions that have not yet
been satisfactorily addressed.
This includes, in the short run, the
United States' commitment to grow
ing entitlement programs, and in the
long run, problems like global warm
ing. All of this must be done in the
context of managing a massive na
tional deficit, he said.
For Volcker, the time to act on
these issues is now.

"Restoring our fiscal position,
dealing with social security and
health care obligations in a responsi
ble way, sorting out a reasonable ap
proach toward limiting carbon emis
sions and producing domestic ener
gy without unacceptable environ
mental risks all take time," he said.
"We better get started."
