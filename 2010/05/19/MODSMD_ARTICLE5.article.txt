Economist Paul Volcker gave a sobering assess
ment of the global financial situation last night, saying
difficult fiscal and economic adjustments are necessary
to rebuild the world economy.
Volcker was at Stanford to receive the inaugural
Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research
(SIEPR) prize for contributions to economic policy.
The time we have is going short, Volcker said, and
the United States needs to adopt a sense of urgency as
its government tries to tackle the fundamental prob
lems that led to a recession.
Volcker, 82, a former chairman of the Federal Re
serve under Presidents Carter and Reagan and current
chairman of the President's Economic Recovery Advi
sory Board, has now taken a role as the wise man of the
global financial system, and was lauded as such by the
institute.
"What do we need in public life right now?" asked
George Shultz, Hoover Institution fellow, chairman of
the committee that awarded Volcker the prize and the
U.S. Secretary of the Treasury under President Nixon.
"We need Paul Volcker."
Shultz and Volcker both served under President

"To a substantial extent, it was those
'non-banks' that were at the epicenter of
the crisis."
