## Stanford court appeal draws colleges' support M.I.T., others file briefs backing Stanford in case on HIV research, patents, public funding 
### TYLER BROWN STAFF WRITER 
Stanford has filed a petition to the Supreme Court seeking to
appeal a Federal Circuit Court decision in favor of bio tech com
pany Roche Molecular Systems. The decision, made last Sep
tember, denies the University full ownership on several patents
on work by Stanford School of Medicine researchers.
The court's opinion hinged on its interpretation of the Bayh-
Dole Act, an intellectual property law passed in 1980 to regulate
the assignment of patents that result from federally funded re
search. It was designed to accelerate the "technology transfer"
from lab to market by predefining the owner of new patents
usually a university and thereby keeping taxpayer-funded tech
nologies benefiting the public by making them easier to license.
But with the court's decision, the lawsuit has grown beyond
just Roche and Stanford. Stanford's petition argues that a uni
versity that receives federal funding has the legal right to patents
even if the inventor assigns his or her patent claim to a third
party. But the court's decision makes universities' claims to full
patent ownership uncertain which could make ambiguous
the cases where patents from research receiving public funding
could be claimed by an institution.
