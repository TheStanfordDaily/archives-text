## Stanford court appeal draws colleges' support M.I.T., others file briefs backing Stanford in case on HIV research, patents, public funding 
### TYLER BROWN STAFF WRITER 
Stanford has filed a petition to the Supreme Court seeking to
appeal a Federal Circuit Court decision in favor of bio tech com
pany Roche Molecular Systems. The decision, made last Sep
tember, denies the University full ownership on several patents
on work by Stanford School of Medicine researchers.
The court's opinion hinged on its interpretation of the Bayh-
Dole Act, an intellectual property law passed in 1980 to regulate
the assignment of patents that result from federally funded re
search. It was designed to accelerate the "technology transfer"
from lab to market by predefining the owner of new patents
usually a university and thereby keeping taxpayer-funded tech
nologies benefiting the public by making them easier to license.
But with the court's decision, the lawsuit has grown beyond
just Roche and Stanford. Stanford's petition argues that a uni
versity that receives federal funding has the legal right to patents
even if the inventor assigns his or her patent claim to a third
party. But the court's decision makes universities' claims to full
patent ownership uncertain which could make ambiguous
the cases where patents from research receiving public funding
could be claimed by an institution.
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (M.1.T.), the Wis-


BRIAN HOWALD/The Stanford Daily
consin Alumni Research Foundation
and institutions represented by
groups including The American
Council on Education (ACE) and
the Association of American Univer
sities (AAU) have filed amicus curi
ae briefs supporting Stanford's peti
tion.

In its brief, the AAU argued the
Appeals Court's decision threatens
the success of the Bayh-Dole Act "by
casting in doubt the rights of univer
sities and the federal government
alike to inventions arising" from fed
erally-funded research and "allowing
rights in federally funded patents to
be disposed of in obscure private
contracts between researchers and
third parties rather than according to
Congress's dictates."

Case History
According to case files, as a

Stanford post-doc in 1989, Mark
Holodniy collaborated with re
searchers at Cetus Corporation, a
Berkeley biotechnology firm ac
quired by Roche in 1991. As part of
his work, Holodniy, now a profes
sor of medicine, used a DNA am
plification technology invented at
Cetus called polymerase chain re
actions, or PCR. At the time, he
was also required to sign a confi
dentiality agreement stating, in
part, that he waived patent rights
to Cetus for future work that relat
ed to Cetus business or resulted
from knowledge gained there.

The use of PCR led to a method
invented at Stanford that measures
HIV levels in the blood. The tech
nology is being used today in HIV
test kits developed and sold by
Roche.

Holodniy did not respond to a
request for comment.
The Appeals Court ruling holds
that the patent was assigned to
Holodniy before the University
took ownership and that, because
of the agreement Holodniy made

with Cetus while he was employed
there, Stanford and Roche hold
dual ownership of the patents.

Stanford contends that Roche's
claim on the HIV technology is
clearly invalid and that the Bayh-
Dole act indicated the patents' as
signment to the University, as op
posed to Holodniy as an individual
or to Roche.

Roche did not immediately re
turn requests for comment.
"If you're building a house, you
need a hammer to build a house,"
said Patrick Dunkley, senior coun
sel for Stanford, referring to the
role of PCR in the HIV detection
method. "It's a tool that's used."
Stanford has been locked in the
legal fight with Roche since 2005,
when it first sued Roche for patent
infringement.
As reported by M.I.T.'S student
newspaper, The Tech, Roche is set
to file an opposition brief on May
26.
