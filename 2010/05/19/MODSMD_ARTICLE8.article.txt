## E-dissertations grow popular 
### TROY YANG STAFF WRITER 
When the University announced
last November that doctoral disser
tations and masters dissertations
from some engineering disciplines
would be made available in a digital
format, it was unclear how many
graduate students would take advan
tage of this option over the tradition
al "hard-copy" submission. Now,
nearly an entire academic year later,
it is clear that some graduate stu
dents have made the transition
smoothly from paper to electronic
submission.

The change came from the regis
trar and libraries, with Google help
ing to implement the new submission
process and make the results of stu
dents' research available to the pub
lic more efficiently.
There are several advantages to
both graduate students and the Uni
versity for making the transition from
paper to digital, say those involved: it
is less expensive for students by sev
eral hundred dollars and it solves the
inefficient process of making the
original paper submissions electronic
after they are submitted.
"It's an inefficient process," said
Michael Keller, the University librar
ian. "Things like illustrations de
grade instead of improve. And things
like supplemental data files if you
wanted to provide anything from a
data set to a spreadsheet, from an an

imation to a model, you can't render
that in paper so it can't be part of the
thesis ... if you could submit your
thesis electronically, these things can
become incorporated in the actual
document."

"I can't speak for the whole acad
emy but I can say that it's not manda
tory, but students seem to have over
whelmingly gone for it," he added.
In fall of 2009, when this option
was first made available, 61 out of 85
dissertations were submitted elec
tronically. In winter quarter, 83 out of
96 submissions were digital. The
number of electronic submissions is
expected to increase in spring quar
ter and to eventually approach 100
percent, Keller said
One student, Claire Adida, de
scribed her decision to go digital.
"I decided to submit it electroni
cally because I found it to be a much
more convenient, cheaper and better
method," said Adida, a doctoral stu
dent in the political science depart
ment who recently submitted a dis
sertation titled "Immigration Exclu
sion and Insecurity in Africa."
"What it does is make your disser
tation available pretty immediately
online, at least to the Stanford com
munity," she added. "I think the easi
er it is to put your work out there and
to make it accessible, the better, the
more legitimate and more recog
nized it will be."

Other students have expressed
some concern that the electronic

submission option gives the authors
less control over who has access to
their research, according to Adida.
"Some people don't really feel
comfortable with their dissertation
being widely available and widely
read before it's significantly im
proved and published with a re
spectable university press," she said.
"There are still options for you to
limit the distribution of the disserta
tion even when you file electronical
ly," she added. "In the social sciences
I don't see any advantages in limiting
the distribution of the dissertation."

Despite the availability of the
electronic option, some students still
find themselves making a print copy
for themselves and those close to
them.
"While I have an emotional at
tachment to what happens to my dis
sertation," said Sarah Rubinfeld, a
graduate student in civil and envi
ronmental engineering, "in terms of
my career, what's important is what
happens to the information and it's
going to be out there in [electronic
form] ... because in the long run
that's the way people are going to
read it."

"As far as I know, it's a win-win all
around," Keller added. "It's better
for the student, it's better for the
scholarly world and the University is
in a position to benefit from that."
