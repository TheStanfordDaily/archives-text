Stanford University, in partnership with the U.S. Fish
and Wildlife Service (USFWS) and the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA
Fisheries), has developed a Habitat Conservation Plan
(HCP) for Stanford lands. The primary goals of the
plan are to stabilize or increase the populations of
covered species and to enhance and protect their
habitat, including riparian vegetation, creeks and
grassland, and seasonal wetlands.
The Federal Agencies' Notice of Availability of the HCP
and a Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS)
can be found at
