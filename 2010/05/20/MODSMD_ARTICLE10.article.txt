## Fellows look at political influence 
### AN LE NGUYEN SAMANTHA McGIRR 
"This place is skeptical about government so
lutions to all of society's problems," said John
Raisian, the director of the Hoover Institution,
about the 91-year-old Stanford fixture founded
by then-future President Herbert Hoover.
Recent publications by Hoover scholars have
lent support to Raisian's words and raise the
question: how much of an impact does Hoover's
scholarly work have in Washington?
According to Raisian, who has served as the
institution's Tad and Dianne Taube Director for
more than two decades, the Hoover Institution's
objective "is to attract the best core of talent."
"We're a collection of people that all have
different opinions about how they think about
things," he added. "This place is not a group of
scholars that all think alike."
Recent critiques by Hoover's independent
scholars suggest a general discontent with poli
cies put forth by the Obama administration. Just
this month. Hoover scholars produced an array
of articles and blog posts that call into question
Washington's response to the financial crisis,
health care reform and foreign affairs.
In a recent Wall Street Journal Op-Ed,
Hoover Senior Fellow and economics Prof. John
Taylor cautioned against a "bailout bill" that
would grant the federal government greater dis
cretionary power and increase the chances of
another financial predicament. Senior Fellow
Richard Epstein, professor of law at the Univer
sity of Chicago, brought to light the constitution
al problems of "ObamaCare" in another Journal
Op-Ed.
Earlier this year, three Hoover fellows
John Taylor Ph.D. '73, Ken Scott J.D. '56 and
George Shultz examined one such Washing
ton policy in "Ending Government Bailouts as
We Know Them." The book, edited by the three
scholars and featuring articles by Scott and Tay
lor, delves into the problem of the bailout mental
ity and suggests alternative legislative and regula
tory strategies for economic crises.
Scott, a professor emeritus at Stanford Law
School, argued that the "financial debacle" was
fundamentally triggered by housing policies and
subprime mortgages. He said mortgage loans
were made on the premise that things would be
fine if housing prices continued to appreciate, and
that the practice of pooling individual housing
mortgages into complicated securities made it
difficult to identify which ones were toxic when
the housing bubble burst. Then the government
stepped in.
"The problem of a bailout isn't bailing out the
institution or its shareholders," Scott said. "That
doesn't happen. The stockholders of these institu
tions end up getting wiped out."
"The moral hazard is that you are enabling the
creditors of these institutions, as they get into
trouble, not to pay serious attention to the riski
ness of the loans and credit that they are extend
ing," he added.
Like many other Hoover publications, "End
ing Government Bailouts" targets Washington
legislators who are actively building and editing
policy, Scott said. Whether or not legislators
hearken to the institution's scholarly work is a dif
ferent matter.
"That's an issue for all academics," Scott said.
"They do the research, they publish their findings
and their ideas and their recommendations if
they have any. It's another aspect of society that
decides what it is going to do with them."
Raisian believed in his early years with the
Hoover Institution that research would be well
received and readily implemented in Washing
ton.
"That was naive, honestly," Raisian said.
He said the pace of politics makes it challeng
ing for academics to dig deeply into any particu
lar issue.
"If you're lucky, 20 percent of the time you're
looking at the analysis of the situation and 80 per

cent of the time you're looking at the politics of
the situation," Raisian said. "This can be a little bit
discouraging for those of us that are scholars be
cause in the end, raw politics is going to determine
outcome."
At the same time, though, a number of Hoover
fellows have held government positions, includ
ing James C. Miller 111 and Michael McFaul 'B6
M.A. 'B6. Miller's Washington credentials are ex
tensive: he was appointed chairman of the U.S.
Federal Trade Commission by President Ronald
Reagan in 1981 and went on to become director
of the U.S. Office of Management and Budget.
Miller said his partisanship does not "impair" his
academic work.
"Scholars can have political affiliations and I
don't think that impairs their ability to do good
work, just like a person can be a businessman and
be religious," Miller said.
Fellows represent a wide spectrum of partisan
affiliations; while Miller served under a Republi
can president, McFaul currently serves as special
assistant to President Obama for national securi
ty affairs and senior director for Russian and
Eurasian affairs at the National Security Council.
"We've been a little [labeled] maybe as a
'conservative' institution in not thinking so
much conservatively when it comes to politics to

ideology, although it would be hard for me to
argue that we weren't," Raisian said. "But con
servative in the sense that any scholarly organi
zation is naturally conservative we're in a
bubble, we're used to doing it our way, we just do
it the way we know how to do it."
Miller characterized the intellectual conver
sation among the fellows as one based in acade
mia, but bearing strong policy relevance.
"The fellows are writing to communicate
amongst themselves but are also hopeful a poli
cymaker will read what they have to say," Miller
said. "Therefore, they bear a substantial respon
sibility to get the analysis right."
Raisian added that Hoover hopes to share its
work with a broad electorate, beyond the small
academic and public policy-oriented "elite" that
make up a large part of the institution's audi
ence.
Founded in 1919, the Hoover Institution orig
inated as a collection of documents on World
War I. The Institution draws 45 percent of its
funding from an endowment, 40 percent from
private donations and 15 percent from Stanford,
which is dedicated to the library and archives.

institution's Tad and Dianne Taube Director for
more than two decades, the Hoover Institution's
objective "is to attract the best core of talent."
"We're a collection of people that all have
different opinions about how they think about
things," he added. "This place is not a group of
scholars that all think alike."
Recent critiques by Hoover's independent
scholars suggest a general discontent with poli
cies put forth by the Obama administration. Just
this month. Hoover scholars produced an array
of articles and blog posts that call into question
Washington's response to the financial crisis,
health care reform and foreign affairs.
In a recent Wall Street Journal Op-Ed,
Hoover Senior Fellow and economics Prof. John
Taylor cautioned against a "bailout bill" that
would grant the federal government greater dis
cretionary power and increase the chances of
another financial predicament. Senior Fellow
Richard Epstein, professor of law at the Univer
sity of Chicago, brought to light the constitution
al problems of "ObamaCare" in another Journal
Op-Ed.
Earlier this year, three Hoover fellows
John Taylor Ph.D. '73, Ken Scott J.D. '56 and
George Shultz examined one such Washing
ton policy in "Ending Government Bailouts as
We Know Them." The book, edited by the three
scholars and featuring articles by Scott and Tay
lor, delves into the problem of the bailout mental
ity and suggests alternative legislative and regula
tory strategies for economic crises.
Scott, a professor emeritus at Stanford Law
School, argued that the "financial debacle" was
fundamentally triggered by housing policies and
subprime mortgages. He said mortgage loans
were made on the premise that things would be
fine if housing prices continued to appreciate, and
that the practice of pooling individual housing
mortgages into complicated securities made it
difficult to identify which ones were toxic when
the housing bubble burst. Then the government
stepped in.
"The problem of a bailout isn't bailing out the
institution or its shareholders," Scott said. "That
doesn't happen. The stockholders of these institu
tions end up getting wiped out."
"The moral hazard is that you are enabling the
creditors of these institutions, as they get into
trouble, not to pay serious attention to the riski
ness of the loans and credit that they are extend
ing," he added.
Like many other Hoover publications, "End
ing Government Bailouts" targets Washington
legislators who are actively building and editing
policy, Scott said. Whether or not legislators
hearken to the institution's scholarly work is a dif
ferent matter.
"That's an issue for all academics," Scott said.
"They do the research, they publish their findings
and their ideas and their recommendations if
they have any. It's another aspect of society that
decides what it is going to do with them."
Raisian believed in his early years with the
Hoover Institution that research would be well
received and readily implemented in Washing
ton.
"That was naive, honestly," Raisian said.
He said the pace of politics makes it challeng
ing for academics to dig deeply into any particu
lar issue.
"If you're lucky, 20 percent of the time you're
looking at the analysis of the situation and 80 per

cent of the time you're looking at the politics of
the situation," Raisian said. "This can be a little bit
discouraging for those of us that are scholars be
cause in the end, raw politics is going to determine
outcome."
At the same time, though, a number of Hoover
fellows have held government positions, includ
ing James C. Miller 111 and Michael McFaul 'B6
M.A. 'B6. Miller's Washington credentials are ex
tensive: he was appointed chairman of the U.S.
Federal Trade Commission by President Ronald
Reagan in 1981 and went on to become director
of the U.S. Office of Management and Budget.
Miller said his partisanship does not "impair" his
academic work.
"Scholars can have political affiliations and I
don't think that impairs their ability to do good
work, just like a person can be a businessman and
be religious," Miller said.
Fellows represent a wide spectrum of partisan
affiliations; while Miller served under a Republi
can president, McFaul currently serves as special
assistant to President Obama for national securi
ty affairs and senior director for Russian and
Eurasian affairs at the National Security Council.
"We've been a little [labeled] maybe as a
'conservative' institution in not thinking so
much conservatively when it comes to politics to

ideology, although it would be hard for me to
argue that we weren't," Raisian said. "But con
servative in the sense that any scholarly organi
zation is naturally conservative we're in a
bubble, we're used to doing it our way, we just do
it the way we know how to do it."
Miller characterized the intellectual conver
sation among the fellows as one based in acade
mia, but bearing strong policy relevance.
"The fellows are writing to communicate
amongst themselves but are also hopeful a poli
cymaker will read what they have to say," Miller
said. "Therefore, they bear a substantial respon
sibility to get the analysis right."
Raisian added that Hoover hopes to share its
work with a broad electorate, beyond the small
academic and public policy-oriented "elite" that
make up a large part of the institution's audi
ence.
Founded in 1919, the Hoover Institution orig
inated as a collection of documents on World
War I. The Institution draws 45 percent of its
funding from an endowment, 40 percent from
private donations and 15 percent from Stanford,
which is dedicated to the library and archives.
