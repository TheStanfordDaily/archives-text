## EDITORIAL FRPAA: A needed step in advancing America's intellectual progress 
### 
The Federal Research Public Access Act
(FRPAA) currently sits in the House
of Representatives, waiting to funda
mentally change the way research is shared
in our country. Stanford has recently an
nounced its support of the act in an open let
ter urging other academic institutions to do
the same. The FRPAA would mandate that
all research efforts with budgets over $lOO
million publish their results online within six
months of original publication. The minor
costs of making research publicly available
online by no means outweigh the priceless
benefits of fostering a culture of shared
knowledge within the American research
community that has been long overdue.
Concerns for copyright are what current
ly restrict widespread access to research, and
going digital would not eliminate all the
problems in this area. But it remains the pub
lishing industry that adamantly opposes such
cooperation and openness. By no means
would the act eliminate authorship or pub
lishing rights. We must realize there is not a
black market for research findings. More im
portantly, there is no market of ideas when
doors are closed on academic research.
Sharing research must become a hallmark
of American institutions and academia in the
way that this act promotes. Publications that

lie in a drawer, on a shelf or thousands of miles
away do nothing to foster the growth of new
ideas in the research community. Research is
done for the benefit of society, but if that soci
ety is not allowed to learn from that research,
it is merely text and data sets. When people are
allowed to collaborate, add on to what others
have created and expand an idea in a direction
the original author never imagined, knowl
edge progresses much more rapidly than
when individuals research and work in secret.
FRPAA would create an online forum de
signed to facilitate peer-to-peer interaction,
the sharing of ideas and collaboration. For the
research community not to take advantage of
the Internet in this way would only hinder our
nation's progress in the areas of research and
development, areas where we are currently
found lacking in a global comparison.
In a society where the power of the indi
vidual is celebrated and protected, FRPAA
moves into a new age of progressive thinking.
Protecting research must not come at the
cost of preventing further research; copy
right can be maintained while still permitting
for the open exchange of ideas among aca
demic institutions. The Editorial Board ap
plauds Stanford for openly endorsing
FRPAA and hopes that other universities
and institutions will do the same.
