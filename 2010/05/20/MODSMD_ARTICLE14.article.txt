# ADVENTURES IN ACADEMIA
## Drinking Games, Cups, Menus and Housing 
### Danny Crichton 
In this space, I generally focus my energies
on education policy, with brief forays into
mental health and personal reflection.
However, there are times when my com
plaint box overflows and I have to clear out
the backlog. Here are four everyday life is
sues I feel need to be addressed right now at
Stanford.
Issue No. 1: Banning drinking games at
Stanford
There has been a movement in recent
weeks to ban drinking games in Stanford
housing (either in just public lounges or in all
rooms in student dorms). I have been in
formed that the development of this policy
comes from the actions of a handful of resi
dents who may imbibe a wee bit much in the
early Saturday hours.That situation is a cause
for concern, but banning drinking games on
campus is a fundamentally incorrect ap
proach to solve the problem.
Stanford's current policy on alcohol can
be described as an educational model that fo
cuses on personal responsibility and social
norming. The goal is to increase the number
of moderate drinkers so that the drinking
culture on campus stays reasonably tame.
This policy has had great success compared
to the prohibition policies of other campuses.
It is deeply disappointing that a policy
that has worked reasonably well for many
years would be affected by just a handful of
irresponsible people. We are adults at this
school, with personal responsibility to handle
ourselves with dignity. Those members who
violate that trust should be punished, but
their actions should not affect those who are
responsible. As a non-drinker, I hope that we
can maintain our moderate drinking culture
by stopping this poorly conceived policy.
Issue No. 2: Stealing drinking cups
Stanford's openness also extends to our
dining halls, which allow students to take
food, trays, utensils and cups back to their
rooms as long as they are returned quickly.
Lately, however, there has been a notable
lack of cutlery and beverage-carrying objects
in our dining halls, largely a result of theft and
irresponsibility.
There have been discussions that the cups
were stolen by a small group of dedicated
rogues on campus. That might be the main
cause, but they are not the ones who are
throwing away 30 or more plates and utensils
into my floor's bathroom trash.
To my fellow students: the trays, plates
and cups that Stanford Dining provides are
the property of the University. If you can get
admitted to one of America's top schools,
you can figure out the tray return turnstile.
Bring those items back for your fellow diners.
Issue No. 3: Hiding menu items at dining
establishments
I learned upon my arrival at Stanford that
In-N-Out is the height of California cuisine.
While the food is of course delicious, the
restaurant is also famous for its Spartan
menu, behind which belies an extensive array
of options including the bizarrely named
"Animal Style."
Unfortunately, Stanford Dining has de

cided that it has to follow the lead of the
gourmet restaurant chain by keeping an ex
tensive number of items off the dining menu
at major establishments. The Dish menu ap
parently has more than just sandwiches, and
there is an entire unhealthy menu at The Axe
and Palm that is not mentioned on the color
ful menu posters.
When I am studying late into the night, I
do not want to guess at what items are on the
menu. Please put out a list with the complete
menu I will probably buy more, too.
Issue No. 4: Housing Move Out Schedules
With spring quarter coming to a rapid
close, it is time to prepare to move out of my
current residence into my new summer
home. And when I say prepare, I mean, liter
ally down to the minute, as Stanford Housing
provides students just two hours to move
their belongings across campus.
I know that moving hundreds (perhaps
even thousands) of students between dorms
is not an easy task logistically. However, ask
ing students to move in a period of 120 min
utes seems just a little Herculean. I may be on
the right tail of the normal distribution in
terms of the amount of junk I have accumu
lated, but I question just how many students
can move all of their belongings across cam
pus in such a short period of time.
It is probably too late to fix the timing this
year, but please note this protest I just
need another hour or two.

Danny Crichton believes that the heavy-drink
ing, cup-stealing, menu-erasing clock-watcher
should come forward and be recognized. If you
have any leads on this individual, please e-mail
them to dancric@stanford.edu.
