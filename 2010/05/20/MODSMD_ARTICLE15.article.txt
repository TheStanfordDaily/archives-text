# ALTERNATIVE LIVING... WITHOUT THE NAKED
## Happiness Not on a CV 
### Samantha Toh 
Until my first year at Stanford, summer
meant months of me lounging around
at home, painting, reading and mind
lessly surfing the Internet. On occasion, I
would make the arduous 15-minute trip out
to a friend's, where we might eat junk food
and watch movies. Even more rarely, there
would be an event, some lazy afternoon I
would wear crazy sunhats and explore cafes
or old antique shops. I would end in the
evening, drinking tea and eating scones,
sprawled out on cushions, Cleopatra-esque.
People here, though, seem to achieve so
much more in the limited span of three
months. Their CVs bulge with accomplish
ment. So many of my friends have back-to
back schedules, some pioneering crazy in
ventions in labs, others training to run full
marathons or climb K-2. Others are about to
embark on a multitude of programs, running
them or taking part in them. Regardless of
what we Stanford students do, our summers
all seem to result in very large, landmark
feats that pile atop one another.
I love all this activity. Personally, it means
that something interesting is always going
on; when my life is boring, there is always an
opportunity to live vicariously through
somebody else. I wonder, though, if lazy days
have really been left behind with the advent
of Stanford, and if lazy days are necessarily
any worse than hours occupied by over
achievement.

I say this with a bit of nostalgia, because
one of my laziest, most unproductive sum
mers the summer of 2009 was also one
that I loved the most. In lieu of doing anything

bombastic, I decided to languish on the Euro
pean continent on an income that I alone had
made over the previous school year. This
meant three months of living out of a suitcase
and surviving on a diet of Wonderbread, yo
gurt and giant Costco-sized boxes of granola.
I took buses from city to city, meeting up with
various people on the way, and while nothing
particularly CV-worthy happened, I came out
of it with Tolstoy-sized stories to tell.
In one particular turn of events, I ended
up on a small farm in County Donegal, a few
minutes from the northernmost point of Ire
land, with my best friend from high school.
For two weeks, we lived in a camper van with
a random Polish environmentalist and
worked on a small, two-acre farm. In the day,
we harvested everything from potatoes and
carrots to kale, rocket and tomatoes, break
ing every few hours for a cup of Irish tea. In
the evenings, I would run the dirt roads, hop
ping over mounds of cow pies and avoiding
trails where the loose dogs lurked. Some
days, I would cycle miles out to the rim of the
coast where I could see the Atlantic roaring
gorgeous and wild.
Nothing particularly eventful happened.
It felt like a high school summer simply trans

planted into a rural locale, where I learned
seemingly small and insignificant things that
nonetheless made me happy. I found out how
to identify diseased tomatoes and how to
crop a lettuce. Catering to my inner '6os child,
I rediscovered my love for hip-swinging rock
'n roll and learned to wear flowers in my hair.
During the evenings, I would visit the old
couple next door and play them my grand
repertoire of three Debussys, fingers stum
bling over 1950s piano keys.
This non-exhaustive list, however quotid
ian, represents what I consider to be some of
my greatest summer achievements. Nothing I
accomplished can be written on a CV, but I
guard these memories with the protective
ness of a mother fox, if only because I derive
a homely satisfaction from my experiences
that is difficult to articulate or even justify.
Ultimately, what this past summer did was
teach me about happiness: I realized that,
sometimes, the greatest memories we end up
with are not necessarily the greatest achieve
ments on paper. There is always a choice we
must make between planning for our future
and living in the moment. Sometimes the two
goals coincide in activities that make us
happy. In the case where a trade-off exists,
however, I have begun prioritizing happiness
in the present over a projected happiness in
the future. And perhaps I might regret it 30
years from now, but right in this moment, I
feel that I let things go easier, I plan less, and
I think I have become a happier person for it.
