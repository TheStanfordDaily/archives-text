## HAWAII, 5-1 Card dominates in second-to-last nonconference game 
### KABIR SAWHNEY DESK EDITOR 
With the regular season swiftly coming to
its conclusion, the Stanford baseball team
played its penultimate nonconference game
on Tuesday against Hawaii. The Cardinal
pitching staff severely limited the Rainbow of
fense, and Stanford (28-20, 11-10 Pac-10)
cruised to a 5-1 victory.
Though none of its regular starters pitched
in the game, the trio of pitchers used by head
coach Mark Marquess still proved to be fairly
effective. Junior Danny Sandbrink started the
game, giving up three hits and a run in 4.1 in
nings. Sandbrink also had two walks and one
strikeout.
He was replaced in the fifth inning by soph
omore Brian Busick, who recently moved
back into the bullpen after being in the start
ing rotation for part of the season. Busick
pitched 2.2 shutout innings before freshman
Mark Appel took over in the seventh inning.
Appel gave up two hits and no runs over the
final two innings.
Busick was credited with the win, improv
ing his record to 5-1 on the season.
Unlike the Cardinal, the Rainbows (26-24)
struggled to find consistency on the mound.
Hawaii used five pitchers in the game, none of
whom lasted for more than two innings. While
starter Josh Slaats found some success against
Stanford, the three pitchers that followed him
each gave up at least one run.
Harrison Kuroda had the toughest outing,
giving up three runs on three hits in his 1.1 in
nings pitched. He was charged with the loss,
his first decision of the season.
Like its pitching staff, the Hawaii lineup
struggled to put together hits or find any kind
of consistency. Despite getting six hits in the
game, its only run came on a solo home run by
catcher Kevin Fujii in the third inning.The blast
gave Hawaii a 1-0 lead, but Stanford quickly
erased it in the fourth inning.
Aside from Fujii, the top performer for the

Rainbows was leadoff hitter and second base
man Kolten Wong, who went 2-4.
Stanford's hitters did not have similar is
sues, as they scored runs in the fourth, sixth
and seventh innings, including a three-run
rally in the sixth off Kuroda.
Especially notable for the Cardinal was the
use of freshmen at the top of the batting order.
Marquess filled four out of the first five spots
in the lineup with freshmen, the sole exception
being junior second baseman Colin Walsh,
who hit in the two-spot.
With its performance in this game, this
group of players right fielder Tyler Gaffney,
first baseman Stephen Piscotty, third baseman
Kenny Diekroeger and designated hitter Eric
Smith proved that Marquess' faith in them
was well-placed. The hitters went a combined
7-16 with two RBIs. The best performances
