# Why I hate sports broadcasters
## 
### Kabir Sawhney 
As a sports fan, it is hardwired
into me to love ESPN. I don't
see how anyone could dislike
the network. It is by far the
best nationwide sports net
work there is, and its website is probably the
best online resource for sports information
as well.
Yet, as I was watching the Celtics-Magic
game on Tuesday night, I found myself
welling up with hatred at the idiotic "com
mentators" that continued to drone on
senselessly at critical junctures in the game.
Jeff Van Gundy, Mark Jackson and Mike
Breen refused to simply allow me to watch
they felt a need to constantly comment
every time the ball moved.
In fact, this is a problem endemic
throughout the world of sports media. The
former players and coaches hired to sit in
booths and talk into microphones don't
seem to understand that the game itself, not
their commentary, is the center of the sports
fan's experience.
To all you so-called commentators: I'm
not an idiot. When a free throw doesn't go
into the basket, I know that the shooter
missed the free throw (I cannot tell you how
many times Breen felt compelled to inform
me of this fact after I had seen it happen not
five seconds earlier). When a hitter swings
at a pitch and misses, I don't need to be told
that it's a swing and a miss. When I see a
quarterback throw a bomb down the mid
dle of the field, it's pretty obvious that it's "a
deep pass down the middle of the field."
The reason these people are given mi
crophones in the first place is because
they're supposed to have some kind of
knowledge or expertise that I don't. Flaving
them simply repeat what happened on
screen is an insult to sports fans every
where.
That being said, the commentators do
have a purpose for me, which they did man
age to fulfill to an extent during the Celtics-
Magic game. Their job is to tell me things
that are relevant to the game, but that I
would not have known on my own. For ex
ample, it was helpful when they updated me
on the fact that Dwight Howard was close
to fouling out and that Glen Davis was a
terrible free-throw shooter during the sea
son. There were also times when they broke
down and analyzed the strategies of each
team.

The real problem is that broadcasting
still seems to be stuck in the radio era,
where it has its roots. For radio listeners, the
voice of the reporter was the only medium
through which the sports fan experienced
the game. Broadcasting entailed repeating
all the details of the action and frequently
repeating the time remaining and the cur
rent score (which are communicated on tel
evision by scoreboard banners on the pe
riphery of the screen).
Today's commentators have not been
able to move too far beyond this style. Some
more embellishment has supplanted
straight factual broadcasting, but the un
derlying idea of the sports broadcaster as a
person who communicates the ebb and
flow of the game to viewers has not
changed. The move from the radio style to a
new focus, one that acknowledges that the
viewer is both watching and knowledge
able, is essential to rid sports media of the
clutter that plagues it today.
There is always the possibility of the op
posite excess, too commentators engag
ing in pseudo-analysis or opining on irrele
vant subjects while the damn game is hap
pening. Enough of modern sports is com
mercials, replays and people standing
around to begin with; why do ESPN's hacks
feel the need to rob me of my precious, pre
cious live action?
The worst offenders are the commenta
tors on ESPN's atrocious Monday Night
Football, who seem to think that they (not
the game) are the entertainment that the
viewer tunes in for. I cannot tell you how
many stupid "in-booth interviews" I have
sat through, silently praying that the net
work would end it and actually go back to
its primary responsibility of, you know,
showing me the game in progress.
Despite all of this, the best option is
probably to just wait for the interactive TVs
that I've heard are coming soon. They allow
you to customize your viewing experience,
from camera angles to sound. I'll finally be
able to decide how I want to watch my
sports, which will most certainly include
shutting off the inane babbling of an ESPN
talking head.

Kabir Sawhney doesn't seem to realize that
radio broadcasts still exist. Remind him that
he is a sports broadcaster himself at ksawh
