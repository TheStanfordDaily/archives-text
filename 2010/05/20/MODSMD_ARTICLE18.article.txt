# SWEET 16 DUEL
## Stanford takes on Clemson in 8-9 matchup today 
### WILL SEATON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With its home court successfully defended,
the No. 8 Stanford women's tennis team heads
out to Athens, Ga. to face No. 9 Clemson in the
next round.

The Cardinal dispatched Fairfield and No.
31 SMU with identical 4-0 sweeps in the first
and second rounds to make it to the round of
16 in this year's tournament.
"I was a little nervous, especially because
we haven't played at home in a while," said
sophomore Veronica Li. "We hadn't played a
real dual match in a bit either so I was trying to
get back into it first of all, but I was also think
ing it wasn't part of the season. It was the
NCAA definitely a strange experience."
This marks the 25th year in a row that the
team has made it this far. Unfortunately, the
players have the reminder of last year's early

defeat to Baylor in the round of 16 hanging
over their heads. That was the team's earliest
exit in 11 years, and so Stanford will surely use
that thought as motivation.
The team comes into this matchup with far
more rest than the Clemson players. The Tigers
had to battle through four hours of heat to dis
patch Georgia 4-2 in the second round.
Stanford also has the historical edge against
Clemson. The Cardinal is 9-0 in head-to-head
matchups and has knocked Clemson out of the
NCAA Tournament five times, most recently
