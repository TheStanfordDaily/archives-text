# SWEET 16 DUEL
## Stanford takes on Clemson in 8-9 matchup today 
### WILL SEATON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With its home court successfully defended,
the No. 8 Stanford women's tennis team heads
out to Athens, Ga. to face No. 9 Clemson in the
next round.

The Cardinal dispatched Fairfield and No.
31 SMU with identical 4-0 sweeps in the first
and second rounds to make it to the round of
16 in this year's tournament.
"I was a little nervous, especially because
we haven't played at home in a while," said
sophomore Veronica Li. "We hadn't played a
real dual match in a bit either so I was trying to
get back into it first of all, but I was also think
ing it wasn't part of the season. It was the
NCAA definitely a strange experience."
This marks the 25th year in a row that the
team has made it this far. Unfortunately, the
players have the reminder of last year's early

defeat to Baylor in the round of 16 hanging
over their heads. That was the team's earliest
exit in 11 years, and so Stanford will surely use
that thought as motivation.
The team comes into this matchup with far
more rest than the Clemson players. The Tigers
had to battle through four hours of heat to dis
patch Georgia 4-2 in the second round.
Stanford also has the historical edge against
Clemson. The Cardinal is 9-0 in head-to-head
matchups and has knocked Clemson out of the
NCAA Tournament five times, most recently

Stanford's top singles and doubles players, junior Hilary Barte and senior Lindsay Burdette, will lead the No. 8 seed Stanford women's tennis
team into its Sweet 16 match against No. 9 seed Clemson. The Cardinal will travel to Athens, Ga. for the remainder of the tournament.
in the Sweet 16 in 2008.
The Tigers do have many good
things going for them, however. In the
regular season, the team tied a school
record with a 13-1 home record and
defeated eight top-25 opponents. This
is the fourth consecutive season that
Clemson is into the Sweet 16, and the
program clearly has been on the up
swing recently.
While Clemson is much closer to
the site of the match than Stanford, Li
believes that the crowd will be in the
Cardinal's favor.
"We have our alumni, former ten
nis players on the team flying in, a lot
of family members are coming over,"
Li said. "[Clemson] beat Georgia, so
I'm hoping we'll have some UGA
fans come out and rally for us instead
of Clemson."

Li is one of the players that have
contributed most to Stanford's pres
ence in Georgia. She completed and
won both her matches over the week
end in straight sets; the first was a 6-0,
6-0 blowout and the second was near
ly as good, 6-2,6-1. In fact, she's been
playing this way all year, amassing a
25-7 overall record. With 20 dual
match victories, she is tied for the team
lead in wins with junior Hilary Barte
and freshman Mallory Burdette.
Despite her regular season success,
Li was hesitant coming into the post
season.
"I was injured coming back from
Ojai, just my ankle," Li said. "I hadn't
really done much and I felt a little slow
physically so that was tough. I'm final
ly getting back into it and every day
has been a little bit easier."
Stanford hopes Li can fight
through the pain as well as she did in
the first two rounds.
Another player that must be fol
lowed is senior Lindsay Burdette. She
was leading in both her matches by

one set over the weekend when play
was halted. She is a Georgia native, so
Stanford hopes she can find an extra
source of confidence in Athens. The
Cardinal will need both these players
performing at their top level to get
past Clemson, and, possibly to be pre
pared to face No. 1 Baylor in the next
round.
Baylor has had an outstanding sea
son, rising to the top seed in this year's
tournament. For Stanford, it is also a
little personal. Baylor has knocked
Stanford out of the tournament the
past three years in a row.
"The fact that we've lost to them all
three years," Mallory Burdette said,
"if that isn't motivating enough to get
there and beat them, I don't know
what is."
The Card will take on Clemson at 3
p.m. PST today. If Stanford advances,
it will take on the winner of Baylor vs.
Texas on Saturday at 2 p.m. PST.
