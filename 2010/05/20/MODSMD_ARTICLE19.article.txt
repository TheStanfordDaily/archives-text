The No. 2 Stanford men's golf
team begins its quest for a national
title today at the Warren Golf Course
at the University of Notre Dame in
one of six NCAA Regional tourna
ments. The Cardinal has been tabbed
as the top seed in the regional after a
second-place finish in the Pac-10
Championship.
The top five finishers from each
regional will advance to the NCAA
Championships to be held June 1-6
at the Honors Course in Chat
tanooga, Tenn.
The other teams in Stanford's re
gional, in order of seeding, are Flori
da, Florida State, Duke, LSU, North
Carolina State, lowa, Michigan,
Northwestern, Indiana, Virginia
Tech, Murray State, Detroit and St.
Francis.
Florida edged Stanford by two
strokes at the Isleworth Collegiate
Invitational in October.
Head coach Conrad Ray selected
the top five finishers from the Pac-10
championship to play in the NCAA
Regional. Senior Joseph Bramlett
will be joined by juniors Steve
Ziegler and Sihwan Kim, sophomore
David Chung and freshman Andrew
Yun. Bramlett led the Cardinal at the
Pac-10 Championship with an 11-
under 273 to finish tied for fourth.
The teams will play 54 holes over
the course of three days, with the
four best individual scores from each
day counting toward the team score.
The Warren Golf Course is a chal
lenging Ben Crenshaw layout with
lots of bunkers and small greens.
"It's definitely a ball striker's
course," Ray said. "I think that plays

to our guys' advantage."
Stanford last won the NCAA
Championship in 2007 in Williams
burg, Va. Bramlett played in the tourna
ment as a freshman and tied for 39th.
The forecast for the three-day
tournament in South Bend is mostly

clear with chances of rain on Friday.
Stanford tees off this morning at 5
a.m. PST with Florida and Florida
State, the other top seeds.
