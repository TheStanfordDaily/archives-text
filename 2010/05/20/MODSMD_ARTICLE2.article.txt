## Williams syndrome findings relate to autism, disorders 
### ERIN INMAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
For Williams syndrome patients, a larger fusiform
face area (FFA) of the brain has been found to translate
to increased face-to-face interaction tendencies, Stan
ford researchers said.
In a paper published in the Journal of Neuroscience
last week, Stanford researchers found that behavioral
tendencies in Williams syndrome patients correlated
with FFA size, a finding that holds wider implications
for other behavioral disorders like autism.
Those affected by Williams syndrome, a genetic dis
order that includes both cognitive deficits and
strengths, have a strong "social appetite," said lead au
thor and psychology department researcher Golijeh
Golarai.
Golarai collaborated with Kalanit Grill-Spector, as
sociate professor of psychology, and Allan Reiss, School
of Medicine psychiatrist and neuroscientist.
Reiss had previously observed pronounced deficits
in the temporal and occipital lobes of Williams syn
drome patients. His knowledge combined with the
known social nature of the disorder gave Golarai a
"hunch" that Williams syndrome patients' cortical re
gions would show a larger activation for faces.
"The logical question was, if the structure has an ab
normality, then does the function?" Golarai said.
In conjunction with Harvard Medical School, the
Salk Institute for Biological Studies and Bangor Uni
versity, the Stanford research group began running
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) on
adults with and without Williams syndrome.
The FFA, which processes identity, usually activates
when shown pictures of faces. The fMRIs allowed re
searchers to measure the size of each individual's FFA.
Those with Williams syndrome had a larger FFA consis
tent with their increased behavioral responsiveness to
faces.
However, other parts of the brain associated with fa
cial recognition showed no significant differences in
this study, suggesting that Williams syndrome has a
"specific effect in the fusiform gyrus for faces," Golarai
said.
The specificity of the FFA could suggest that it is
uniquely plastic.
Conversely, the specificity could reflect the possibil
ity that the experiment was not designed to process
other parts of the brain involved in facial recognition.
"The kinds of faces we used weren't designed to
process the STS," or superior temporal sulcus, a brain
structure that reads expression, Golarai said. "We can't
say the STS is or isn't normal."
Next, the team hopes to conduct a similar study on
children to determine whether or not Williams syn
drome patients' FFA size differs from the beginning of
life or diverges with development from the normal size.
If FFA size diverges over time it "gives more weight
to experience, but doesn't eliminate genetics," Golarai
said.
Golarai is hopeful that under
standing the interplay of genes and
experience might provide hypothe
ses for possible genetic causes of
autism.
"Autism is really an umbrella
term for a whole collection of more
specific diseases and disorders about
which we know very little," Reiss
said. "We know what causes the be
haviors that we call autism in less
than ten percent of the people that
receive that diagnosis."
Autism and Williams syndrome
represent "two sides of the same
coin," Reiss said. Social communica
tion and behavior is overdeveloped
in Williams syndrome and underde
veloped in autism.
Because Williams syndrome is a
very specific disorder with known
genetic factors, it can be used as an
"experiment of nature" to better un

derstand the subdivisions of autism,
Reiss said.
Since Williams syndrome pa
tients have larger than normal FFAs
and autistic patients have "underac
tive" or smaller than normal FFAs,
Reiss speculates that perhaps the
same gene underlies both diseases,
but different mutations account for
the behavioral differences.
Hypothetically, the gene may af
fect how infants learn the context for
facial interactions. One version
could cause excessive social drive re
sulting in behavior characteristic to
Williams syndrome, while a different
version could cause an "abnormally
decreased drive to interact with peo
ple which might serve as a basis for
how some people come to develop
autism," Reiss said.
This speculation about gene-en
vironment interactions could help
explain a few more autism diagnoses
in what Reiss believes will be a pro
gressive discovery of the science be
hind autism.
