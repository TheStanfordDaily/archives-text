## Williams syndrome findings relate to autism, disorders 
### ERIN INMAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
For Williams syndrome patients, a larger fusiform
face area (FFA) of the brain has been found to translate
to increased face-to-face interaction tendencies, Stan
ford researchers said.
In a paper published in the Journal of Neuroscience
last week, Stanford researchers found that behavioral
tendencies in Williams syndrome patients correlated
with FFA size, a finding that holds wider implications
for other behavioral disorders like autism.
Those affected by Williams syndrome, a genetic dis
order that includes both cognitive deficits and
strengths, have a strong "social appetite," said lead au
thor and psychology department researcher Golijeh
Golarai.
Golarai collaborated with Kalanit Grill-Spector, as
sociate professor of psychology, and Allan Reiss, School
of Medicine psychiatrist and neuroscientist.
Reiss had previously observed pronounced deficits
in the temporal and occipital lobes of Williams syn
drome patients. His knowledge combined with the
known social nature of the disorder gave Golarai a
"hunch" that Williams syndrome patients' cortical re
gions would show a larger activation for faces.
"The logical question was, if the structure has an ab
normality, then does the function?" Golarai said.
In conjunction with Harvard Medical School, the
Salk Institute for Biological Studies and Bangor Uni
versity, the Stanford research group began running
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) on
adults with and without Williams syndrome.
The FFA, which processes identity, usually activates
when shown pictures of faces. The fMRIs allowed re
searchers to measure the size of each individual's FFA.
Those with Williams syndrome had a larger FFA consis
tent with their increased behavioral responsiveness to
faces.
However, other parts of the brain associated with fa
cial recognition showed no significant differences in
this study, suggesting that Williams syndrome has a
"specific effect in the fusiform gyrus for faces," Golarai
said.
The specificity of the FFA could suggest that it is
uniquely plastic.
Conversely, the specificity could reflect the possibil
ity that the experiment was not designed to process
other parts of the brain involved in facial recognition.
"The kinds of faces we used weren't designed to
process the STS," or superior temporal sulcus, a brain
structure that reads expression, Golarai said. "We can't
say the STS is or isn't normal."
Next, the team hopes to conduct a similar study on
children to determine whether or not Williams syn
drome patients' FFA size differs from the beginning of
life or diverges with development from the normal size.
If FFA size diverges over time it "gives more weight
to experience, but doesn't eliminate genetics," Golarai
