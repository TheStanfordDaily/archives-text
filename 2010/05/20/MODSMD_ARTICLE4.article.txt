A van of about 20 Stanford stu
dents unloads at a San Mateo Coun
ty juvenile detention center. Some
are wearing comfortable sneakers,
while others have already put on
their soft ballet flats. As they walk
into the facility, massive metal doors
clang closed behind them. The com
mand desks in the central lobby have
been pushed over to the walls, which
can only mean one thing: it's time to
dance.
Such was the scene set by drama
professor Janice Ross M.A.'75 Ph.D.
'9B, a veteran of the Haas Center for
Public Service, who spoke on
Wednesday evening as part of the
Miriam and Peter E. Haas Centenni
al Professorship Lecture Series on
Public service.
"At first glance, the combination

of the words dance and prison might
sound like a paradox or a bad joke,"
Ross said. "We try to erase that ab
surdity."
Ross presented her course,
"Dance in Prisons: The Arts, Juvenile
Justice, and Rehabilitation in Ameri
ca," which she started at Stanford
nine years ago. The course brings 15
to 20 Stanford students to learn
dance with the incarcerated at San
Mateo and Santa Clara County juve
nile halls and nearby high schools for
juvenile offenders.
The goals of the program include
creating a positive environment in
which troubled teens, or "insiders," as
Ross described them, can engage in
artistic and emotional expression,
but also to provide a hands-on way
for Stanford students to connect with
issues of social justice outside of the
Stanford "bubble."
When the class runs, Ross said
"innkeepers" report noticeable im
provements in insiders' behavior.
