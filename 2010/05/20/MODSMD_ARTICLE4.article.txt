## Dance in Prison reflects on service years Service program for incarcerated youth faces budget restrictions

A van of about 20 Stanford stu
dents unloads at a San Mateo Coun
ty juvenile detention center. Some
are wearing comfortable sneakers,
while others have already put on
their soft ballet flats. As they walk
into the facility, massive metal doors
clang closed behind them. The com
mand desks in the central lobby have
been pushed over to the walls, which
can only mean one thing: it's time to
dance.
Such was the scene set by drama
professor Janice Ross M.A.'75 Ph.D.
'9B, a veteran of the Haas Center for
Public Service, who spoke on
Wednesday evening as part of the
Miriam and Peter E. Haas Centenni
al Professorship Lecture Series on
Public service.
"At first glance, the combination

of the words dance and prison might
sound like a paradox or a bad joke,"
Ross said. "We try to erase that ab
surdity."
Ross presented her course,
"Dance in Prisons: The Arts, Juvenile
Justice, and Rehabilitation in Ameri
ca," which she started at Stanford
nine years ago. The course brings 15
to 20 Stanford students to learn
dance with the incarcerated at San
Mateo and Santa Clara County juve
nile halls and nearby high schools for
juvenile offenders.
The goals of the program include
creating a positive environment in
which troubled teens, or "insiders," as
Ross described them, can engage in
artistic and emotional expression,
but also to provide a hands-on way
for Stanford students to connect with
issues of social justice outside of the
Stanford "bubble."
When the class runs, Ross said
"innkeepers" report noticeable im
provements in insiders' behavior.

inspired by jazz instructor Ehud
Krauss, who has been teaching dance
in prison settings for 20 years; Ross
met Krauss while writing a features
story about him for Dance Maga
zine. She recalled seeing Krauss
teaching young men in baggy shorts
with probation officers jeering as
they stood by. The room was dim and
the dance was taught on a cement
floor that smelled strongly of disin
fectant.
Ross has since offered her own
course at Stanford eight times in the
past eleven years.
According to Ross, a lack of fund
ing prevented her from offering the
course this year, but she thinks it is
highly likely that the course will be
offered next year, and is working to
get funding.
The course, which runs for three
consecutive quarters for purposes of
continuity, has traditionally been
funded by Haas. In the past, Haas has
covered the approximate $6O cost
per student to take the course, which
covers requirements for security
clearances and costs associated with
transportation and parking.
According to Ross, the fact that

the course could not be offered in the
2009-10 academic year was a reflec
tion of the larger campus budget cri
sis; after Haas communicated that its
funding was restricted, she "didn't
even put forth a request" to obtain
funding. Ross said that the drama de
partment has never participated in
funding the course for budgetary
reasons.
Ross admits that not everyone in
the scholarly community takes the
program seriously.
"I think there is a question of
whether it is really art anymore, or if
it's therapy, and that is really where
the tension is," she said. Conversa
tions with co-workers in the arts and
public service spheres have made
her believe that the program "does
n't lodge comfortably in any camp
that I live in."
Part of what makes the program
so unconventional is the way in
which it blends public service with
the study of art and social justice. The
course is co-taught by a graduate of
Stanford Law School, Christa Gan
non J.D. '97, who teaches the class
about issues of juvenile justice.
The course often shifts students
from seeing dance as merely "recre
ation or an elite practice," Ross said,
to viewing it as a medium for social
justice.
The United States has the highest
proportion of incarcerated people in

the world, at 745 inmates per 100,000
citizens. Ross added that 93,000
youth around the nation are current
ly in detention centers, and there are
significant racial discrepancies
among the incarcerated. Nation
wide, there are three times as many
African American females incarcer
ated as white females.
"The lives of people in prisons re
mains largely invisible, the stories of
these people largely ignored," Ross
said.
Krauss attended the lecture and
attested that both students and insid
ers derive positive benefits from the
program. Xandra Clark 'l2 and
Mariam Nek 'll both took the
course last year and spoke about
their experiences.
"Every week we danced with the
same partner, so we sort of built a re
lationship over time," Clark said.
"We could talk about anything ex
cept for why the inmate was in
there."
Nek, a psychology major, said the
class changed the way that she per
ceives incarcerated youth.
"I was the kind of person who be
lieved that people who were in juve
nile hall deserved it," she said. "I
came to this class and did a 180 com
pletely ... strict punishment wasn't
the way to help these kids."
Nek was impressed by the respect
insiders showed to the Stanford stu

dents.
"The boys had a respect for space
between our bodies a respect you
don't see in college boys at parties,"
she said.
Standing up from the back of the
room at the end of the talk, Krauss
explained why he values the pro
gram so highly.
"We all make a difference with
these kids' lives. They are lonely kids,
they are lost," he said. "Through
dance, we connect them to different
people. And that's a gift we all have
and I hope that we use it."

of the words dance and prison might
sound like a paradox or a bad joke,"
Ross said. "We try to erase that ab
surdity."
Ross presented her course,
"Dance in Prisons: The Arts, Juvenile
Justice, and Rehabilitation in Ameri
ca," which she started at Stanford
nine years ago. The course brings 15
to 20 Stanford students to learn
dance with the incarcerated at San
Mateo and Santa Clara County juve
nile halls and nearby high schools for
juvenile offenders.
The goals of the program include
creating a positive environment in
which troubled teens, or "insiders," as
Ross described them, can engage in
artistic and emotional expression,
but also to provide a hands-on way
for Stanford students to connect with
issues of social justice outside of the
Stanford "bubble."
When the class runs, Ross said
"innkeepers" report noticeable im
provements in insiders' behavior.

Wednesday night about her Dance in Prisons program,
which brings dance to incarcerated youth in San Mateo.
inspired by jazz instructor Ehud
Krauss, who has been teaching dance
in prison settings for 20 years; Ross
met Krauss while writing a features
story about him for Dance Maga
zine. She recalled seeing Krauss
teaching young men in baggy shorts
with probation officers jeering as
they stood by. The room was dim and
the dance was taught on a cement
floor that smelled strongly of disin
fectant.
Ross has since offered her own
course at Stanford eight times in the
past eleven years.
According to Ross, a lack of fund
ing prevented her from offering the
course this year, but she thinks it is
highly likely that the course will be
offered next year, and is working to
get funding.
The course, which runs for three
consecutive quarters for purposes of
continuity, has traditionally been
funded by Haas. In the past, Haas has
covered the approximate $6O cost
per student to take the course, which
covers requirements for security
clearances and costs associated with
transportation and parking.
According to Ross, the fact that

the course could not be offered in the
2009-10 academic year was a reflec
tion of the larger campus budget cri
sis; after Haas communicated that its
funding was restricted, she "didn't
even put forth a request" to obtain
funding. Ross said that the drama de
partment has never participated in
funding the course for budgetary
reasons.
Ross admits that not everyone in
the scholarly community takes the
program seriously.
"I think there is a question of
whether it is really art anymore, or if
it's therapy, and that is really where
the tension is," she said. Conversa
tions with co-workers in the arts and
public service spheres have made
her believe that the program "does
n't lodge comfortably in any camp
that I live in."
Part of what makes the program
so unconventional is the way in
which it blends public service with
the study of art and social justice. The
course is co-taught by a graduate of
Stanford Law School, Christa Gan
non J.D. '97, who teaches the class
about issues of juvenile justice.
The course often shifts students
from seeing dance as merely "recre
ation or an elite practice," Ross said,
to viewing it as a medium for social
justice.
The United States has the highest
proportion of incarcerated people in

the world, at 745 inmates per 100,000
citizens. Ross added that 93,000
youth around the nation are current
ly in detention centers, and there are
significant racial discrepancies
among the incarcerated. Nation
wide, there are three times as many
African American females incarcer
ated as white females.
"The lives of people in prisons re
mains largely invisible, the stories of
these people largely ignored," Ross
said.
Krauss attended the lecture and
attested that both students and insid
ers derive positive benefits from the
program. Xandra Clark 'l2 and
Mariam Nek 'll both took the
course last year and spoke about
their experiences.
"Every week we danced with the
same partner, so we sort of built a re
lationship over time," Clark said.
"We could talk about anything ex
cept for why the inmate was in
there."
Nek, a psychology major, said the
class changed the way that she per
ceives incarcerated youth.
"I was the kind of person who be
lieved that people who were in juve
nile hall deserved it," she said. "I
came to this class and did a 180 com
pletely ... strict punishment wasn't
the way to help these kids."
Nek was impressed by the respect
insiders showed to the Stanford stu

dents.
"The boys had a respect for space
between our bodies a respect you
don't see in college boys at parties,"
she said.
Standing up from the back of the
room at the end of the talk, Krauss
explained why he values the pro
gram so highly.
"We all make a difference with
these kids' lives. They are lonely kids,
they are lost," he said. "Through
dance, we connect them to different
people. And that's a gift we all have
and I hope that we use it."
