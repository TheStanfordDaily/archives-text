## Arts grants can't cover performers UAR and Arts Grant Program can fund materials, but not people 
### JOSHUA FALK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
For Stanford students seeking to complete
projects in the arts, two major grant-funding
sources provide financial support for arts proj
ects, but cannot be used to compensate per
formers. The restriction presents distinct chal
lenges for students hoping to complete projects
in music, dance, theatre and other performing
arts, which are popular ventures at the end of
spring quarter, when students present senior
recitals and other end-of-year performances.
The first funding source, Undergraduate
Advising and Research (UAR), supports a va
riety of projects in all disciplines. The second,
the Arts Grant Program, exclusively supports
projects in the arts and is run by students.
Chris Bowen 'O9, now a conducting student
at Catholic University of America, received a
UAR grant last spring for his senior music con
ducting recital. He used the grant money to rent
sheet music for his recital, but had to seek alter
nate funding from the music department to
compensate the musicians who performed in it.
"At least for musicians like conductors and
composers, they need people to realize their
music," Bowen said. "If they can only get fund
ing through the UAR ... I think it's problemat
ic for those kinds of musicians."
For English major Alexandra McKeon 'll,
finding dancers for her four-and-a-half minute
piece was not a problem. McKeon, who re
ceived a winter quarter "Art + Invention" mini
grant of $lOO from the Arts Grant Program,
used the money to purchase costumes for a
dance piece she produced, which was per
formed at this year's Art Affair. The dancers
who performed in her piece were volunteers.
"I guess as students, people are willing to
participate in new works for free, which is
lucky," McKeon said.
"We have a few really dedicated dancers in
the dance department who are looking to pur
sue a professional career," McKeon added. "I
just talked to some of those students who are
really passionate about it."
For those serious dancers, "the more experi
ence, the better," McKeon said.
The student-run Arts Grant Program, fund
ed primarily by the Stanford Organizing Com
mittee for the Arts (SOCA), awards funds twice
annually. Summer grant recipients agree to
debut their projects at Party on the Edge at
Cantor Arts Center in the fall, while winter
grant recipients must debut their works at
SOCA's Art Affair in the spring.

Arts grants fund student projects like this dance
performance by providing financial support for
materials, but it cannot pay for performers.
Like UAR, the Arts Grant Pro
gram prohibits grant recipients from
using its funds to pay performers.
"It comes down to the fact that
it's too hard to do a process of reim
bursement," said Megan Miller, Arts
in Student Life Coordinator for the
Stanford Institute for Creativity and
the Arts (SICA). SICA provides
SOCA with matching funds to sup
port the Arts Grant Program.
Miller explained that Arts Grant
Program grantees must save their re
ceipts from project purchases and
are later reimbursed by the pro
gram.
"The problem is, if you have a stu
dent performer, first, how do you
have a receipt?" Miller said. "And if
you're not doing it that way, then
how do you do it? How do you issue
a one-time payment to a person?"
Brian Thomas, associate dean for
undergraduate research opportuni
ties, said UAR's rationale for the
prohibition on compensating per
formers was more than logistical,
however.
"First, because funding for all of
our grant programs (not just in the
arts) is limited, we try to prioritize
requests that propose to accomplish
a lot with a modest budget," Thomas
wrote in an e-mail to The Daily.
"Secondly, we've seen in the past
that while some students want to
hire performers for their creative
projects, other students are in fact
looking for opportunities to gain

performance experience," Thomas
said. "We think everyone is better
served if these two populations work
together."

Josh Archibald-Seiffer 'lO was
critical of UAR's prohibition on
using grant funds to pay performers.
Archibald-Seiffer co-leads the Wet
Ink Composers Collective, a group
that premieres music written by un
dergraduate composers and often
seeks funding from the music de
partment to pay musicians who per
form new works. Archibald-Seiffer is
presenting a composition recital
next Friday, which requires musi
cians to perform the works.
"All of that burden should not
have to fall on the music department
if there are arts grants available,"
Archibald-Seiffer said.
Paying musicians who perform in
recitals can "strengthen their com
mitment to the project," he said. "I
don't see any good logical reason
why that should not be a possibility
for those grants."
Archibald-Seiffer said that it was
difficult to find musicians capable of
performing pieces by Wet Ink com
posers, which often require "avant
garde and advanced techniques."
"It's a little bit easier to come up
with student actors," he added.
Thomas also emphasized that
UAR's prohibition on using grant
money to pay performers isn't hard
and fast.
"We're willing to entertain ex
ceptions when a student's proposal
makes an especially compelling ar
gument," he said.
