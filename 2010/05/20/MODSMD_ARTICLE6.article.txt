## Arts grants can't cover performers UAR and Arts Grant Program can fund materials, but not people 
### JOSHUA FALK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
For Stanford students seeking to complete
projects in the arts, two major grant-funding
sources provide financial support for arts proj
ects, but cannot be used to compensate per
formers. The restriction presents distinct chal
lenges for students hoping to complete projects
in music, dance, theatre and other performing
arts, which are popular ventures at the end of
spring quarter, when students present senior
recitals and other end-of-year performances.
The first funding source, Undergraduate
Advising and Research (UAR), supports a va
riety of projects in all disciplines. The second,
the Arts Grant Program, exclusively supports
projects in the arts and is run by students.
Chris Bowen 'O9, now a conducting student
at Catholic University of America, received a
UAR grant last spring for his senior music con
ducting recital. He used the grant money to rent
sheet music for his recital, but had to seek alter
nate funding from the music department to
compensate the musicians who performed in it.
"At least for musicians like conductors and
composers, they need people to realize their
music," Bowen said. "If they can only get fund
ing through the UAR ... I think it's problemat
ic for those kinds of musicians."
For English major Alexandra McKeon 'll,
finding dancers for her four-and-a-half minute
piece was not a problem. McKeon, who re
ceived a winter quarter "Art + Invention" mini
grant of $lOO from the Arts Grant Program,
used the money to purchase costumes for a
dance piece she produced, which was per
formed at this year's Art Affair. The dancers
who performed in her piece were volunteers.
"I guess as students, people are willing to
participate in new works for free, which is
lucky," McKeon said.
"We have a few really dedicated dancers in
the dance department who are looking to pur
sue a professional career," McKeon added. "I
just talked to some of those students who are
really passionate about it."
For those serious dancers, "the more experi
ence, the better," McKeon said.
The student-run Arts Grant Program, fund
ed primarily by the Stanford Organizing Com
mittee for the Arts (SOCA), awards funds twice
annually. Summer grant recipients agree to
debut their projects at Party on the Edge at
Cantor Arts Center in the fall, while winter
grant recipients must debut their works at
SOCA's Art Affair in the spring.

Arts grants fund student projects like this dance
performance by providing financial support for
materials, but it cannot pay for performers.
