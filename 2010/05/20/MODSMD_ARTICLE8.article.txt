## BABY TALK 
### ZOELEAVITT SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Baby Hattie puts a bit of a banana
into her mouth and then spits it back
out. Puts it back in her mouth for a
second try, gets frustrated and then
yells "No!" The banana's back on
the floor.
Hattie isn't having it, but the whole world is
laughing in delight.
It's been a roller coaster ride for Hattie and
her family over the past several years, ever
since Susie Wise, who works at the Stanford
Institute of Design, and her husband Frazer
Bradshaw agreed to let the small French doc
umentary film "Bebes," feature their child.
"Bebes" has now morphed into the American
heart-wringer "Babies." The film follows four
children one in Namibia, one in Mongolia,
one in Tokyo and one, Wise's child, in San
Francisco across their first year of life, from
first breaths to first steps.
Wise became involved in the project before
she had ever even seen Hattie's face. In Janu
ary 2006, her husband Bradshaw, a filmmaker,
received a call asking if he'd be interested in
filming a baby in San Francisco for a movie,
and if he knew anyone expecting a baby in
April or May coincidentally, his wife was.
Susie agreed to let her husband and a French
film team document her future child for 18
months.
"I thought it seemed really interesting," she
said. "It was very clearly not going to be an
America's Home Video, it was very cinematic,
the director had a deep and historical knowl
edge of documentary films. And, Frazer was
earning income while just hanging out at
home."
"We never thought it would be this big,"
Wise laughed. "We never even thought it

would be shown in American theaters!"
However, Focus Features bought the film
and released it in the United States to over $2
million on its opening weekend.
A doctoral student in the School of Educa
tion at the time they became involved, Wise
had been naturally attracted to the idea of
comparing the lives of four babies plopped
down in extremely different lifestyles. She was
certainly not without doubts but not the
type of doubts one might expect to trouble a
parent about to show off her child to the
world.
"Because we were the American family ...
there was some fear of being pigeonholed as
super materialistic or super techno-centric, or
too overbearing," she said. "Among Ameri
cans in general we're really pretty chill, but in
comparison to families in Namibia, of course,
we look that way."
It seems Wise's fears weren't unfounded.
Reviews of the movie have floated the idea
that Hattie's family is too focused on toys and
parenting books. Bloggers have especially fo
cused on a baby yoga class in which Hattie
makes a break for the door.
Wise is accepting of the criticism, but feels
most bothered by the articles that have called
her daughter "stressed" by an over-stimulated
lifestyle.
"I have to not be defensive because I total
ly support that message [of a more relaxed
parenting style]," Wise said. And the film
helped reinforce that message both for her
and for other viewers.
"Children don't learn from fancy toys, they
learn from observing their environment, and
the film shows that message beautifully," Wise
added.
Wise also used "Babies" to promote her
own message. She recently became involved
with Embrace, a project pioneered by students

from the Entre
preneurial De
sign for Ex
treme Afford
ability class in
Stanford's
d.school. Em
brace has created
incubator devices to
help save the 20 million
premature and low-birth
weight babies born every year,
many in developing countries.
At a mere $25, compared to tra
ditional incubators at $20,000,
Wise believes that Embrace has
great potential to help babies across
the world. Since she, and the other three
babies and their families, don't receive any

proceeds from the movie, she decided to
make something good out of it by turning the
"Babies" premiere into a fundraiser for Em
brace.
So following this massive, worldwide par
enting display, what's Wise's take-away mes
sage for parents?
"There are lots of different parenting
styles," she said. "The most important thing is,
just love your kid!"
Hattie, now 4 years old, has certainly grown
up with a lot of love. Since her father did most
of the filming, following her around with a
camera one or two days per week, her early
life was not too disrupted by the making of the
movie.
Wise and her husband watched the movie
for the first time on a laptop in their living
room this past December. The viewing quelled
Susie's fears of being typecast, and she recent
ly brought Hattie to see it in the movie theater.
Seeing herself on the big screen had a
strong effect on Hattie, though her parents are

try
ing to make sure she doesn't think of her
self as a movie star. Soon after Hattie saw the
movie for the first time, says Wise, she went to
a birthday party with a Dora the Explorer
cutout.

"That's Dora, she has a movie too!" Hattie
exclaimed.
Her parents reminded her that she wasn't
the only baby the movie featured, and now,
whenever adults come up to her and tell her
she's a movie star, Hattie reportedly replies
modestly, "Well, there are three other babies."
However, the Wises have never even spo
ken to the other three families that helped
make their daughter a star. They don't share a
common language, but Susie has had dreams
of a grand reunion ever since the beginning of
the project.
"I love the idea that Hattie has this kind of
magical connection with these children," Wise
said. "What a cool gift to give to this child."

there was some fear of being pigeonholed as
super materialistic or super techno-centric, or
too overbearing," she said. "Among Ameri
cans in general we're really pretty chill, but in
comparison to families in Namibia, of course,
we look that way."
It seems Wise's fears weren't unfounded.
Reviews of the movie have floated the idea
that Hattie's family is too focused on toys and
parenting books. Bloggers have especially fo
cused on a baby yoga class in which Hattie
makes a break for the door.
Wise is accepting of the criticism, but feels
most bothered by the articles that have called
her daughter "stressed" by an over-stimulated
lifestyle.
"I have to not be defensive because I total
ly support that message [of a more relaxed
parenting style]," Wise said. And the film
helped reinforce that message both for her
and for other viewers.
"Children don't learn from fancy toys, they
learn from observing their environment, and
the film shows that message beautifully," Wise
added.
Wise also used "Babies" to promote her
own message. She recently became involved
with Embrace, a project pioneered by students

from the Entre
preneurial De
sign for Ex
treme Afford
ability class in
Stanford's
d.school. Em
brace has created
incubator devices to
help save the 20 million
premature and low-birth
weight babies born every year,
many in developing countries.
At a mere $25, compared to tra
ditional incubators at $20,000,
Wise believes that Embrace has
great potential to help babies across
the world. Since she, and the other three
babies and their families, don't receive any

proceeds from the movie, she decided to
make something good out of it by turning the
"Babies" premiere into a fundraiser for Em
brace.
So following this massive, worldwide par
enting display, what's Wise's take-away mes
sage for parents?
"There are lots of different parenting
styles," she said. "The most important thing is,
just love your kid!"
Hattie, now 4 years old, has certainly grown
up with a lot of love. Since her father did most
of the filming, following her around with a
camera one or two days per week, her early
life was not too disrupted by the making of the
movie.
Wise and her husband watched the movie
for the first time on a laptop in their living
room this past December. The viewing quelled
Susie's fears of being typecast, and she recent
ly brought Hattie to see it in the movie theater.
Seeing herself on the big screen had a
strong effect on Hattie, though her parents are

try
ing to make sure she doesn't think of her
self as a movie star. Soon after Hattie saw the
movie for the first time, says Wise, she went to
a birthday party with a Dora the Explorer
cutout.

"That's Dora, she has a movie too!" Hattie
exclaimed.
Her parents reminded her that she wasn't
the only baby the movie featured, and now,
whenever adults come up to her and tell her
she's a movie star, Hattie reportedly replies
modestly, "Well, there are three other babies."
However, the Wises have never even spo
ken to the other three families that helped
make their daughter a star. They don't share a
common language, but Susie has had dreams
of a grand reunion ever since the beginning of
the project.
"I love the idea that Hattie has this kind of
magical connection with these children," Wise
said. "What a cool gift to give to this child."
