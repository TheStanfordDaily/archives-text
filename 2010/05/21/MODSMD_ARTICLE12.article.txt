### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Elizabeth Titus 
A Stanford Law School project is
helping represent the plaintiffs in a
lawsuit against the State of California
filed on Thursday alleging the state
education finance system is unconsti
tutional because it denies all students
equal opportunities to meet academic
targets.

Stanford Law's Youth and Educa
tion Law Project, part of the Mills
Legal Clinic, is representing the plain
tiffs in Robles-Wong, et al. v. State of
California, filed in Alameda County
Superior Court, along with firm Bing
ham McCutchen and attorney
William Abrams.
The lawsuit calls attention to the
disparity in per-pupil spending be
tween California and other states a
more than $2,800 gap, the plaintiffs
said.

Sixty students and families, nine
school districts, the California School
Boards Association, the California
State PTA and the Association of Cal
ifornia School Administrators filed
the lawsuit together.
They are asking a judge to make
the state rid itself of its current educa
tion finance system, determine what
spending level would meet "the needs
of California's school children" and
create a new way to fund schools.
"California's unstable, unsound
and insufficient school finance system
is robbing our students of an educa
tion," said Frank Pugh, the chair of the
School Boards Association, in a state
ment.
"We believe this is an appropriate
role for the courts to play," said
William Koski Ph.D. 'O3, the director
of the Youth and Education Law Pro
ject, in a statement from Stanford.
"We're not asking a judge to legislate.
The resolution will come in the politi
cal arena. But forcing the legislature
to do something will break the grid
lock on these issues in Sacramento."
The Youth and Education Law
Project has Stanford law students
earn community service experience
by representing families and children
in school- and discipline-related liti
gation and by doing policy research
and advocacy.
