## CLAWING ITS WAY TO SUCCESS 
### JENNY THAI CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
from other literary maga
zines by making it a point to
complement hard-core jour
nalism with humor.
"I was brought on as the
humor guy," said Max McClure
'll, a co-editor-in-chief. "Through
out the pages, there's this sense of
weird humor, and that is what we're
aiming for. Everyone brings their
own brand of quirkiness to it."
In addition to the written portion
of the magazine. The Claw empha
sizes the visual aspect of its publica
tion, ranging from scattered doodles
to fine art.

£ £ -w- f the New Yorker and
the Atlantic had a bas
tard child, it would be
The Claw," pronounced
Mortiz Sudhof'll.
That's quite the goal, but former
editor-in-chief Sudhof hopes "The
Claw," Stanford's relatively new arts
and letters magazine, is up to the
task. Despite its recent birth the
first issue came out last year The
Claw is already carving out a niche
among Stanford's numerous print
publications and leaving a mark with
its rich literary tradition.
"We wanted to see a certain kind
of writing at Stanford that we hadn't
seen before," said Charlie Mintz 'lO,
senior editor of The Claw. "Writing
that captured others."
It all started about three years ago
when former editor-in-chief Anjali
Albuquerque 'll, along with several
other students, came up with the con
cept of a magazine that focused on
international relations. The idea fi
nally came to fruition last year the
first issue of The Claw published in
winter 2009, with a broader focus
than its original idea. The Claw is
now a social forum to showcase some
of students' best works in investiga
tive reporting,fine arts,fiction,essays
and "everything in between."
The Claw prides itself for its high
standards, and ensures that every
piece of writing undergoes a rigorous
process of numerous drafts and
multiple critiques from the staff.
"What makes us different from
other publications is that we will sit
on a piece for as long as it takes to get
polished and done," said Alice Nam
'll, one of The Claw's co-editors-in
chief. "I went through 13 drafts of an
article before it was done."
That focus on finesse and honing
articles leads to The Claw's unique
style of feature stories investiga
tive, research-heavy articles reminis
cent of newspaper feature articles.
"It's [Features], not just flat news
it's more like storytelling," Nam
said. "It's like magical realism. You
tell the story but from a journalistic
point of view."
Another section of The Claw
called "Talk of the Quad" features
editorial columns. In addition, there
are short stories and poems, a photo
essay and essays that blend investiga
tive research with liberal dabs of ec
centricity.
"It's a balance between light satir
ical pieces and heavier pieces that
deal with issues like the war tribunals
in Bosnia," Mintz said.
The Claw also sets itself apart

"It can be difficult," said Claire
Lorentzen 'lO, the senior art & de
sign editor. "Sometimes the layout
process takes over my life and other
times it's really relaxing."
But in the staffs opinion, the aes
thetic value of the print edition is
worth the effort.
"I think it's the most attractive
magazine on campus," said Justin
Calles 'l3, a senior design editor.
Another unique fixture of The
Claw is that it provides the rare
chance for non-fuzzies to have the
opportunity to indulge themselves in
the humanities.

"The fact that I've got a chance to
drive to another city to interview a
famous author, or I went down to Ti
juana to interview a music DJ just
the process of doing that feels like
real journalism," McClure said. "It's
like playacting for me. That is very re
warding because I'm a biology major
so I may never get that experience
again."

"The Claw's a great way for us to
keep in touch with our fuzzy side,"
Nam added.

The experience of being deeply
involved in something early in its his
tory has also been satisfying, particu
larly for freshmen.

"I hadn't done an interview be
fore and I didn't really know how to
design using InDesign," said Sophie
Carter-Kahn 'l3, a senior design edi
tor who has also written several arti
cles. "And now I can do it. It's also fun
to get into something that's just start
ing and to have a big role in it."
The next step for The Claw is to
reach its goal of establishing the
magazine as a long-standing, well-re
spected student publication. Submis
sions for The Claw are encouraged,
and the staff is always on the hunt for
good ideas from new writers.
"There's a quality of writing that
is latent in Stanford," Mintz said.
"And we want anyone who thinks
they have a good story to come to
us."
