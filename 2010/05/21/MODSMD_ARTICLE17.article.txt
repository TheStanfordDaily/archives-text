## SENSE AND NONSENSE The
						Hollow Stanford Student 
### Aysha Bagchi 
Iran into an old friend from my freshman
dorm a couple weeks ago. I remember her
from our freshman year as one of the
most interesting people to talk to: artistic, cu
rious about ideas and eager to engage with
her peers. When we saw each other, she com
mented on the intellectual atmosphere she
had expected to find when she came to Stan
ford, as if it would be a Mecca of students fas
cinated by ideas and eager to explore. In
stead, she found a population that was pre
dominantly concerned with grades and
strategic planning, a student body who pre
ferred to spend their free time going to par
ties, watching Youtube videos, playing Rock
Band and doing other fun but mindless activ
ities. These were broad generalizations, but
they are generally true.

This column is no indictment of "mindless
activities" letting loose once in a while is
especially important for students who are, by
default, busy and stressed. But it's true that
our student body is, by and large, risk-averse
and anti-intellectual. We fail to see where
wrestling with tough questions and big ideas
will get us in life. As New York Times colum
nist David Brooks put it in his column last
week, students at elite schools today are
"prudential rather than poetic."
As I was mulling over these thoughts,
someone sent me a beautiful commence
ment speech titled "Solitude and Leader
ship" that was given by former Yale Professor
William Deresiewicz to West Point graduates
last year. It is impossible for me to do it jus
tice in a single column, but here are some
ideas Deresiewicz lays out:
Deresiewicz argues that students at places
like Stanford are strategic hoop-jumping
multi-taskers. He says that our jam-packed
lives and the cacophony of information we
receive from Facebook, Youtube,Twitter and
even news sites leave no room for us to hear
our own voice. We have no solitude.

Solitude, according to Deresiewicz, is
about introspection, concentration, sus
tained reading and deep friendship. It is
about slowing down and making time to form
our own ideas. It is about wrestling with pow
erful ideas in a great book, ideas that broke
with contemporary habits of thought when
the book was written and still challenge us
today. It is about intimate conversation with
someone we trust where we can articulate
questions we would rather not acknowledge
having, where we can think out loud and dis
cover what we believe in the course of artic
ulating it. Solitude is how we develop self
knowledge.
Stanford students already tend to have
two kinds of pseudo self-knowledge. On the
one hand, most of us spend some time think
ing about what identity clubs we belong to,
where we fit within the categories of culture,
religion, race, gender, sexual orientation and
socio-economic status. On the other hand,

students are idealistic and extremely impas
sioned about issues in the political world. We
seem to know what is important to us. But I
do not think either of these types of self
awareness reflects the kind of self-knowl
edge Deresiewicz is talking about.
Meaningful self-knowledge involves seri
ous examination and conscious endorsement
of values. It is found after rubbing up against
powerful intellectual ideas and taking on the
strongest arguments of those around you.
Beliefs that we develop by conforming, by
being swept away in the drift of opinions that
envelop us in classrooms and dorms and on
Facebook and Twitter, are not our own. We
figure out where we stand and what is impor
tant to us by wrestling with targeted ques
tions in solitude.
Our lack of value for thinking in solitude
is not entirely our fault. We live in a system
where we have to be somewhat strategic to
get the chance to make a big difference. In
deed, a pragmatic outlook is probably more
essential than deep intellectualism to getting
into Stanford. But life is about responsibili
ties, which demand more than the ability to
get ahead. Real responsibility, where the wel
fare of others is in our hands, calls for inde
pendent thinkers with deeply considered val
ues. What we don't see in Wall Street or
Washington today are people who have
spent a lot of time alone with their thoughts
and the best thoughts of others. They are not
able to turn us in a new direction when we are
headed off cliffs.
I recently read a book by Evelyn Waugh,
"Brideshead Revisited," in which one of the
characters spends his life maneuvering and
schmoozing to rise to heights in politics and
society. A couple years into his marriage, his
wife comes to realize that he "isn't a real
person at all", just "a few faculties of a man
highly developed." He has no foundation of
values he hasn't considered what he is re
ally about. Thinking in complex ways, grap
pling with ambiguity to work out where we
stand, is how we figure out who we are. Stu
dents are increasingly eschewing this kind
of self-discovery. What we end up with are
highly impressive technocrats, star gradu
ates with several developed faculties, but no
real core.
