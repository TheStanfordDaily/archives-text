## "OMG, you are like, sooooooo manly!" 
### Yanran Lu 
I have often portrayed males as the aggres
sors, or the evil perpetrators. The more I got
to know the opposite sex, however, the more
I realized that they are just as clueless as women.
Many college men have not established their
own sexual identity, and when placed in an envi
ronment filled with other guys raging in hor
mones, they cling to the ideal of hyper-masculin
ity and adopt the culture of the "vocal minority"
as their own namely, a culture that violently
objectifies women, that is infused with homo
phobia.
Without the true identity of the self, the
stereotype asserts that a man should be
"manly." And to be "manly" is to be "strong,"
"aggressive" and "active." One must avoid
being "sissy," "submissive" or "passive." This
goes to show the nature of the connotations of
the words we associate with the male and the
female. The words we associate with "manly"
have positive connotations. It is definitely a
compliment when we say,"You are the man" or
"You've got balls." However, words that are
often associated with the female sex are often
derogatory, such as "You are such a bitch" or
"Don't be such a pussy." Since "male" and "fe
male" divide the positives and negatives, to be
"manly" must mean the shunning of the "un
manly" and even going as far as belittling them.
Therefore, I was surprised when I heard a
rumor that to pledge a certain unnamed frat,
the pledges have to sit in front of one another,
naked, holding the penis of the person in front
of them while walking in a circle. I asked, how
is that not homoerotic? How do they reconcile
that with their otherwise homophobic, hyper
masculine culture? A person replied that pre
cisely because it is homoerotic, coupled with a

sense of homophobia, the event achieves its
purpose of being "degrading." It states that
homoeroticism is not "manly" and not
being "manly" is humiliating since the "un
manly" have only negative connotations asso
ciated with them.

This type of culture makes it impossible for
(insecure) men (who feel the pressure to cling
on to their "manliness") to treat women with
respect for the fear of being called "a pussy" or
"pussy-whipped" even if they wanted to. In
certain environments, such as frats and sports
groups, giving oral sex is looked down upon
while receiving the most oral sex asserts mas
culinity. To them, being "manly" is about being
in control and asserting charge over the other
sex. Therefore, they are to be "serviced" and
will not take the initiative of lowering their lips
to, God forbid, the vagina.
A friend of mine (who also belongs to a frat)
is also puzzled at the phenomenon. For him, a
large part of the turn-on comes from knowing
his partner is really turned on and is having a
fantastic time. Therefore, it is bewildering why
some guys lack a desire to please, or enjoy sex
ual practices that degrade women. I tried to ex
plain this phenomenon by listing reasons such
as their lack of knowledge of joys of shared
pleasure and the excitement of driving a
woman to ecstasy and their clinging on to
the aforementioned idea of "masculinity."
Thus, the most confident guys I have met
are not the ones who cling to the construction
of masculinity (and who generally have more
brawn than brain). They are, instead, often
quite certain of their sexuality and thus do not
feel the pressure to prove that they, in fact, like
women. They do not feel the need to shun

Terra (or Sigma Nu for that matter) in fear of
being mistaken as gay (because of their free
dom from homophobia as well). They do not
feel that they have to belittle women to assert
their masculinity, and therefore treat women
with respect, as is due to any human being.
They also understand who they are and hence
are not afraid of their "emotional side." They
are often feminists and understand the posi
tive benefits of the feminist movement for
both genders. Therefore, they also understand
the shortcomings and the dangers of the "mas
culine" and "feminine" construction.

"Boys don't cry." "Girls are bad at math."
These limiting constructs of genders in
evitably invite sexism, violence and homopho
bia. Simply, they are hazardous to our well
being. Looking at gender construction, I real
ized that perhaps the guys are not to blame for
their disrespectful ways, but their adaptation
of a social ideal is.They are not inherently evil,
but feel the need to overcompensate with a fa
cade of hyper-masculinity to hide their insecu
rity and immaturity.They have the need to be
little others to establish their own ego. It is my
hope that these guys would grow free of the
weary "hyper-masculinity" that they feel a
need to maintain. After all, what is more at
tractive than a guy who is respectful and self
aware? Remember, gender is but a construct
and one can make up a more fitting set of rules
for behavior that is not as restrictive and
harmful one that includes respect and is fit
ting for this century.
