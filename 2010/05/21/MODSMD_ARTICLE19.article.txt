## FCC should expand scope of debate 
### SEETA PENA GANGADHARAN Doctoral candidate in the Department of Communication 
When the Federal Communica
tions Commission returns to
Dinkelspiel Auditorium today
for a workshop on media ownership
and the impact of new media on broad
casting, it will be addressing topics
well-debated on Stanford campus.
Stanford has seen its share of discus
sions about the decline of traditional
journalism and the rise of digital
media. Two weeks ago, the Center for
Internet & Society hosted, "Future of
Journalism: Unpacking the Rhetoric."
This past January, the Graduate School
of Business hosted "The Future of
Media." Last October, the Department
of Communication held its 44th Annu
al Carlos Kelly McClatchy Memorial
Symposium, "New Times: The Future
of Journalism."
But what is often missing in these
types of discussions and what will likely
be missing from the FCC's workshop at
Dinkelspiel is any serious discussion
about qualitative improvements in
media fare. What media traditional
or new are improving communities
across America, especially those afflict
ed by severe inequalities? When do
media traditional or new en
hance democracy and lead to justice?
When can we begin talking about the
decline of bad media and the future of
good media?
Surely, the FCC's Media Bureau,
which is heading the workshop, will
balk at such questions. Media owner
ship rules, they will argue, have to do
with the integration of market players.
Structure and content are separate is
sues. The FCC only regulates structure.
It is not in the business of judging the
quality of content.
But as the noteworthy First
Amendment scholar, Laurence Tribe,
once said, so-called content-neutral
regulations always imply some sort of

judgment about the type of media
content that is privileged in a society.
And if there's anything the last two it
erations of the media ownership de
bate in 2006-2007 and 2002-2003 made
clear, it's that the structure of the
media industry has a lot to do with the
quality of what we consume on screen.
During that time, community
spokespersons and ordinary individu
als made appeal after appeal to the
FCC to block media companies from
skimping on news and entertainment
that educates, exposes wrongdoing
and abuse of power, and relates to
communities' quality of life.
Though the media ownership debate
of 2010 is unfolding against a different
context than the one of 2006 or 2002,
the concerns of citizens are no less
valid. Relaxed ownership rules still
have tangible consequences for public
discourse. If the FCC relaxes ownership
rules, we might see more of mass
media's deficiencies, not only made
available through traditional distribu
tion channels, but also re-published on
line.
What would benefit an FCC-spon
sored discussion on media ownership is
not more showcasing of new services or
software, for example, that decentral
izes taste-making to users or that mon
etizes and distributes advertising rev
enue to agencies, advertisers, and ad
networks or that repackages traditional
media content for new media plat
forms. (In fact, the FCC could learn
about the impact of new media on
broadcasting by gleaning from the
plethora of public and academic forums
about this very topic.) Rather, what
would benefit a discussion on media
ownership is a consideration of when
media innovations provide witness to,
give voice to, inform, or assist commu
nities and individuals in need, and what

motivates those innovations.
In other words, Media Bureau, think
more broadly about what media inno
vation means. Often times, it's neither
the business plan nor the technological
design that propels media history but a
person, a community, a culture and
their support of a belief or idea. Fuzzy
as this may seem, the process I am de
scribing comports with basic assump
tions about why media matter to socie
ty in the first place: people are the ones
who power democracy and justice. Not
micro payments. Not new social media.
People. For the purposes of quadrenni
al review, the Media Bureau would do
well to pay attention to a history of
media innovations based around mile
stones in political, social, and cultural
change.
To get there, the Media Bureau
ought to be opening discussion among
citizens ordinary individuals as well
as community representatives about
how media serve communities' needs in
light of the claims being made by of tech
evangelists, defenders of traditional
media, proponents of deregulation, and
the hodgepodge of other anointed ex
perts. Far from being massive delibera
tions, these can be small and focused.
(Let media reform activists, public in
terest organizations, affinity groups
representing citizens, news media, uni
versities, or other interested parties
take responsibility for continuing the
conversation.)
Though the Bureau is to be com
mended for hosting a series of work
shops in advance of issuing a proposed
rule, it can and should go further
to improve the quality and scope of the
debate.
