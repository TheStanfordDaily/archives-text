# Mo' Censorship, Mo' Problems
## 
### DANNY COLLIGAN JOE FOLEY LEWIS MARSHALL Atheists, Humanists Agnostics at Stanford 
The right to free expression is the cornerstone
of a free society. Sadly, this sacred institution is
under attack, from without but also from within.
Comedy Central's decision to self-censor the de
piction of the Muslim prophet Muhammad on
"South Park" is only the most recent case. A
threatening post on a extremist Islamic website
prompted the station to bleep every mention of
the prophet's name, and even Kyle's monologue
about free speech at the end of the episode.
This is not the first time that artistic produc
tions have been significantly altered out of fear. In
deed, such censorship has permeated the highest
levels of academia, evidenced by a decision by the
Yale University Press not to publish the Danish
cartoons that infuriated some Muslims in 2005,
even in a book about those cartoons.
This capitulating mindset has even captured the
opinion of world leaders. The Obama administra
tion recently endorsed an Egyptian proposal in the
United Nations to balance free speech against re
spect for religion.
As offensive as the visual depiction of Muham
mad may be to some Muslims, the suppression of
free expression by Comedy Central and others is
even more offensive to a free society. That is why a
Seattle cartoonist declared "Everybody Draw
Muhammad Day": to serve notice that those com
mitted to the right of freedom of expression will
not be intimidated by religious extremists. Athe
ists, Humanists, and Agnostics at Stanford is partic
ipating in this protest on Thursday, May 20th be
cause we stand up for free expression, especially
when it is unpopular or dangerous. We will be
drawing images of Muhammad and we invite you
to come to our table in White Plaza from 11 a.m. to
1 p.m. if you would like to draw the prophet your
self or discuss the motives or spirit of this protest.
The intentions of "Everybody Draw Muham
mad Day" have been misunderstood by some
commentators, so let us explain what this event is
not. It is not an accusation that all censorship is
born of Muslim intransigence or general religious
hand-wringing (more on that presently). This is not
an anti-religion event, but an anti-censorship
event: what we are protesting is the notion that
threats of violence can protect ideas from criti

cism. We also don't want this event to be a one-day
hit-and-run affair, but the beginning of a continu
ing dialogue both on campus and nationwide
about how censorship, including self-censorship,
affects discourse in our world and how to prevent
it.
It is important to note that radical Muslims do
not have a monopoly on agitating for censorship,
something that is often obscured beneath the
rabid anti-Muslim prejudice in American society.
While Comedy Central was editing one of its flag
ship shows without the permission of the show's
creators, a Texas university canceled its production
of "Corpus Christi" (a play starring a gay Jesus) be
cause of threatening phone calls and emails.
In the United States, the First Amendment pro
tects us from overt censorship. However, cases of
government banning of religious expression have
begun to surface in Europe: in France, a law is
pending that will ban Muslim women from wear
ing traditional full-body covers, and the Swiss con
stitution has been amended to ban the construc
tion of minarets, the towers that adorn mosques, of
which exactly four exist in the entire country.
In fact, these non-Muslim-inspired bouts of
censorship and self-censorship are almost certain
ly more pervasive because the excuses for them
are more readily accepted in the mainstream. As
the blog Balloon Juice aptly puts it, "When it hap
pens because of right-wing American complaints,
it's called family values or patriotism. When it hap
pens because of Muslim complaints, it's called cen
sorship."
We believe in the right of free expression for
both popular and unpopular speech. That is why
we feel the need to celebrate "Everybody Draw
Muhammad Day." It is not simply to show solidar
ity with those that have felt the brunt of censorship
and even threats of violence in the past. More im
portantly, we want to emphasize that no idea, per
son or event is beyond criticism in a free society.
