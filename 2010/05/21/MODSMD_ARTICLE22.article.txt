## DUEL IN THE DESERT Card heads to Tucson for crucial series 
### DANIEL BOHM SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford baseball team (28-20,11-10)
travels to Tucson, Ariz, this weekend to play
its penultimate Pacific-10 Conference series
at Arizona (31-18,10-11).

The Cardinal fell from the national rank
ings this week after losing two of three
against Washington State last weekend, con
tinuing a pattern of inconsistent play in the
conference.

This weekend's series is crucial for the
Cardinal's postseason chances and for its
fleeting hopes of winning the Pac-10 title.
Stanford currently sits in a three-way tie for
third place in the conference, five games be
hind leader Arizona State and three games
behind UCLA. The Cardinal takes on the
Sun Devils at Sunken Diamond next week
end in its final games of the season.
Currently, Stanford is in pretty good
shape to make a regional, but a poor ending
to the season could mean a very difficult re
gional or no regional at all a fact that the
team understands.

"It's all in our hands," said junior short
stop Jake Schlander. "If we play well, we set
ourselves up well, and if we don't play up to
our abilities, we may not be in the postseason
or we may be in a tough regional.
"We hold the key to our destiny," he
added.

The Cardinal did bounce back from loss
es on Saturday and Sunday with a 5-1 win
Tuesday against Hawaii.

Stanford will try to take that momentum
to Arizona, which is always a difficult place
to play as a road team.

The Cardinal will send sophomore lefty
Brett Mooneyham to the mound today.
Mooneyham, who got off to a rocky start for
the season, has bounced back well, posting a
3.76 earned run average in his last six starts
while striking out almost a batter an inning.
Arizona is likely to counter with freshman
righty Kurt Heyer, who is having a brilliant
first season. He is 6-2 with a 2.83 ERA in 13
starts.

On Saturday, sophomore righty Jordan
Pries will start for Stanford. While Mooney
ham has gotten better as the season has gone
on, Pries has gotten more inconsistent. He
has not made it through six innings in his last
three Pac-10 starts, but still leads Cardinal
starters with a 3.53 ERA. Sophomore Kyle
Simon will likely start for Arizona.
Freshman Dean McArdle, who got the
first weekend start of his career last Sunday,
is scheduled to start Sunday as long as he

isn't needed in relief today. Redshirt junior
Daniel Workman, who has been a huge dis
appointment this season, going 2-2 with a
7.11 ERA, will probably start for the Wild
cats.

Offensively, the Cardinal continues to be
led by freshman third baseman Kenny
Diekroeger. Diekroeger comes in on a 22-
game hit streak and is hitting .370 for the sea
son.

Outside of Diekroeger, however, the Car
dinal offense has been stagnant. Schlander
blames the offense for the team's recent in
consistencies.

"We've been a bit down on the offensive
side of the ball," he said. "We've been getting
good pitching, but we haven't been scoring
we haven't been getting big hits."
For the Wildcats, sophomore outfielder
Steve Selsky leads the offense with a .400 av
erage, six home runs and 46 runs batted in.
The Cardinal currently sits a game ahead
of the Wildcats in the conference standings,
so this weekend's series is crucial in deter
mining how the Pac-10 standings will shape
up.

After returning from Tucson, Stanford
will play a midweek nonconference game
against UC-Davis before hosting the No. 3
Sun Devils to close out the season. Six or
seven losses and the Cardinal could miss the
postseason, while six or seven wins could set
it up to host a regional, ft will all start today
in Tucson, with the first pitch at 5 p.m. PST.
