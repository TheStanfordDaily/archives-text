# Sports and the Arizona migrant law
## 
### Danny Belch On My Mind 
It seems you can't go anywhere
these days without hearing or
reading something about the con
troversial Arizona immigration
law. The law, which gives police a
gray area of authority to stop people
and ask them for their papers (later
specified to only if one is pulled over for
traffic or other violations), has ignited
national uproar as implicit racial profil
ing.

Who ever thought sports would get
so involved in the heated disapproval?
From the Phoenix Suns wearing "Los
Suns" in honor of the team's Flispanic
and Latino supporters, to Major
League Baseball strongly considering
moving the 2011 All-Star Game from
the state, to thoughts of college foot
ball's BCS National Championship
Game being pulled from its scheduled
stop in Glendale, Ariz, in 2011, sports
are on the move in protest of the bill.
Why not, I guess.

In 1990, Arizona refused to honor
Martin Luther King Day, and the NFL
was quick to strike. The league voted to
remove 1993's Super Bowl slated to be
in Arizona and relocated it to the Rose
Bowl in Pasadena. Because of the huge
revenue boost the Super Bowl provides
for the city that hosts it, Arizona voters
acquiesced and acknowledged the holi
day. The NFL awarded the 1996 Super
Bowl to the city of Tempe.
What is it about sports that can make
a profound statement? Is it the magni
tude of people who watch and follow it?
Is it the money involved? The diverse
group of players the teams feature?
Even if no action is taken on the parts of
teams or leagues, the mere thought, dis
cussion or weighing of options is huge
because it is sure to make headlines and
sure to have people thinking and specu
lating.

The next big statement in the cur
rent battle would come if the Lakers re
fused to travel to Phoenix to play the
Suns in Games 3 and 4 of the Western
Conference Finals. People would talk
about it and the Arizona legislature
would take firm notice. For one, it's the
NBA Playoffs, which are widely
watched. It's also the Los Angeles Lak
ers, one of the most recognizable fran
chises and brands in the country. It's the
kind of statement that you wouldn't
stop reading about and could force Ari
zona to really examine the conse
quences of the law.
Our very own Stanford baseball
team is in Tucson right now for a three
game series with the University of Ari
zona. What if the team didn't go? What
if Athletic Director Bob Bowlsby and
President John Hennessy decided it
was in Stanford's best interest to refuse
to play in Arizona? That surely would
send an overarching statement that
Stanford does not support what Ari
zona is currently doing.
But here's where that gets tricky.
How do we separate an entire institu
tion's opposition from the individual
players' opposition? It wouldn't be fair
to the Stanford players to forfeit those
three games. If the team could not get
the games moved to be played else
where, Stanford would take three losses
at a very pivotal time in the season. Why
should the individual players be pun
ished by not having a chance to play
their games?
But they are just games, right? Just
three measly baseball games, compared
to civil rights, a stand against equality in
America and an opposition to unconsti
tutional lawmaking. Some are calling it
a 21st-century civil rights movement.
Do three baseball games measure up?
These questions are not posed be
cause I am taking a side. They are to in
cite you to think about how sports can
deal with the issue. How far should
leagues, teams and players take it?
When do they draw the line on opin
ion? Lakers head coach Phil Jackson,
after he originally seemed to support
the law, issued another statement say
ing, "I am wary of putting entire sports
organizations in the middle of political
controversies." While I personally agree
with this view, it also has been shown
that sports can have a huge impact on
political issues; at the very least, they are
an excellent vehicle for views and opin
ions to be shown and heard.
I am not getting into arguments
about whether I support the law or do
not support the law. I am writing about
the way sports can be used in this type of
instance to create headlines, visible and

media-covered support or scrutiny and,
basically, just more ado about the situa
tion. Sports can be a very effective way
of voicing out on political issues such as
this because of the coverage it receives
and the news headlines that come out
of teams and players. Many, many play
ers in professional sports leagues in the
U.S. are not white Americans, so it hits
home with them. And when it hits
home with people who are high-profile,

watch out.
I would not be surprised if more
teams and players dive into the contro
versy as it heats up. The hot button issue
is sure to stay until Arizona either re
peals the law, passes another alternate
form or debate dies down. Sports, I be
lieve, will continue to weigh in on the
issue, whether it's teams, leagues or play
ers themselves. And just like always, they
will bring a pretty heavy weight.

Danny Belch went over to the dark
side (the news section) by talking
about John Hennessy. Ask him if he'll
continue on this path at dbelchl @stan

I would not be surprised if more
teams and players dive into the contro
versy as it heats up. The hot button issue
is sure to stay until Arizona either re
peals the law, passes another alternate
form or debate dies down. Sports, I be
lieve, will continue to weigh in on the
issue, whether it's teams, leagues or play
ers themselves. And just like always, they
will bring a pretty heavy weight.

Danny Belch went over to the dark
side (the news section) by talking
about John Hennessy. Ask him if he'll
continue on this path at dbelchl @stan
ford.edu.
