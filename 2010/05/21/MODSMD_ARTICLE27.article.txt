"Survivor," Sandra of course
replied with an affirmative yes.

Although I'm not sure whether or

certainly make her arguably the
best survivor ever, an achievement
I would surely be pleased with.
Unfortunately I foresee that

cycles will have to go through that
dull phase where you have yet to
become invested in any of the
players. I admit it, I'll probably
still watch anyway, I just don't
know how long the show's relative
popularity will last. It was recently
announced that Jeff Probst's con

tract was renewed through season
22, so "Survivor" fans can rejoice;
we have, at the very least, two
more seasons! The tribe has
indeed spoken.
