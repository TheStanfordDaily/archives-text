# Get Lost

Six years ago, my friend told
me he envied me for the
happiness I had coming,
having not yet seen " Lost." He
was right minutes into the
first episode, I was hooked.
Episode One opened with
Jack Shepherd (Matthew Fox),
lying face up in the middle of a
jungle. Over the next few minutes,
we closely followed the character,
discovering with him the beach,
the carnage from the crashed
plane of which he was a passenger
(Oceanic flight 815, Sydney to
LA), and met our principles.
Among them was Jack, a doctor
with a hero complex, Sawyer
(Josh Holloway), resident rogue
and former conman or cop
(depending on which Lost time
line you are following), Kate
(Evangeline Lilly), her father's
murderer and subject to a love

triangle (and occasionally rectan
gle) most often involving Jack and
Sawyer, and Hurley (Jorge
Garcia), an overweight, light
hearted lottery winner with worse
than bad luck.
Even back in that first season,
these characters seemed mysteri
ously connected for a reason.
Discovering that reason is the
driving force behind the final sea
son of "Lost."
When mentioned sidelong,
the powerful, mysterious motives
of the characters in the show
seem plausible enough; but when
answered directly (which viewers,
myself included, demanded of the
final season), suspension of disbe
lief becomes tough even for a sci
fi savvy guy like me.
Each of the characters we've
been following throughout the
series was intentionally brought

to the island because of Jacob, a
man reared outside the influence
of human corruption so that he
could inherit the task of protect
ing the island's valuable "secret."
This secret is a glowing light akin
to lifeforce; for some reason har
nessable by humans, it is beautiful
when used properly, and, when
misused, is capable of turning the
dead into a powerful black smoke
that can possess the bodies of the
dead brought to the island from
the outside world. That evil black
smoke, currently possessing John
Locke (and formerly possessing
Jack's father) is determined to get
off the island, and its up to Jacob's
chosen one particularly his
successor, Jack to do whatever
they can to close Pandora's box.
When I think back on the
realistic fiction "Survivor"-like
show I fell in love with nearly six
years ago, I can't help but feel
some disappointment at the fan
tasy melodrama I continue to
watch. Like most other series, Lost
has suffered from "jumping the
shark," raising the stakes to a
degree where the plot must
become ridiculous to keep up.
Nevertheless, J.J. Abrams and his
crew are masters of creating rich,
captivating stories that [mostly]
tie together in the end. Pseudo
scientific electromagnetic island
properties aside, the actors and
the mysteries have drawn me
through 119 episodes so far (of
which I'd say two-thirds to three
quarters were great), and nothing
will keep me away from the final,
behemoth two-and-half hour
series finale next week.
While I will probably never
find out what the deal was with
Walt's powers or what was with
that Lupitas guy anyway, at least
I'll know if the good guys win and
which Season Six timeline to
believe we've been following
two simultaneous, contradictory
timelines throughout the season. I
don't expect a final, triumphant
return to the show's more com-

pelling roots as a character-driven
drama, organically developing by
enclosing great actors with great
character backstories in a space;
but I do expect to finally say "The
End" to the show I started back in
high school and will finish after
college.

If you've been following the
journey, join me next Tuesday
night. And if you have yet to start,

block out a summer for yourself,
gather some friends that like
intellectual puzzles and hop on
the bandwagon. I envy the happi
ness you have coming, having not
yet seen "Lost."
