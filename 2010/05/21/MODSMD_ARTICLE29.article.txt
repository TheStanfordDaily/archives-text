# 20 Seasons and Still Surviving
## 
### 
Every Thursday night, for
the past three months, my
friend and I have gathered
together in front of the TV, buffs
in hand (I'm not even kidding),
eagerly awaiting the new episode
of one of our favorite shows:
"Survivor." This past Sunday, the
CBS hit reality show ended its
20th, and arguably greatest, sea
son, in the process crowning a
winner and reuniting all of the
eliminated castaways. Ultimately,
the sole-survivor (and first and
only two-time winner) was
Sandra Diaz-Twine, a mother
from North Carolina and previ-

ous winner of "Survivor: Pearl
Islands." I know it may be a little
bit overboard to still watch after
20 seasons (and own a buff), but I
can't help it and I don't care.
In honor of its 10-year
anniversary, this season of
"Survivor" was destined to be one
of the best, as producers brought
back all of our favorite, and not
so-favorite, contestants for a sec
ond (and sometimes third)
chance to battle it out for the mil
lion-dollar grand prize. Starting
with the premise of Heroes
against Villains (two tribes: one
composed of crafty and ruthless
strategists, and the other made up
of honorable, honest competi-

tors), the season quickly got
intense as it became evident that
every returning contestant was
back with one purpose to win.
This competitive edge is what
made the season so great; right
from the start, there were no
expendable pawns and everyone
was a threat, as evidenced by the
early exits of many past all-star
players, such as Cirie Fields, Tom
Westman and Boston Rob
Mariano.
Although "Heroes Vs.
Villains" has been incredibly
dynamic and aggressive through
out every episode, the finale was

tors), the season quickly got
intense as it became evident that

just as exciting as the entire sea
son. There have been many times
where I have been disappointed
by how past seasons have con-

cluded, but this time, the show's
ending was thrilling.
By Sunday, the castaways had
been eliminated down to five
Sandra Diaz-Twine, Parvati
Shallow, Russell Hantz, Jerri
Manthey and Colby Donaldson.
The game for the final immunity,
traversing a maze while blindfold
ed, was probably the most excit
ing challenge "Survivor" has ever
seen. Russell ultimately won, but
both Parvati and Jerri were also
inches from the finish. This

intense competition had Jeff

Probst proclaim, "In all of my

time on Survivor, that is one of
the most dramatic finishes of any
challenge, let alone the final
immunity challenge." Like always,
Jeff is exactly right. I know my
"Survivor" history, and that was
as close and exciting as it gets.
The five were eventually
whittled down to three. Arguably
the best part of the finale was
watching Colby Donaldson's torch
finally get snuffed. Although orig
inally touted as the epitome of a
Hero and a lovable favorite from
Season Two, which took place in
Australia, this season's Colby was
beyond lackluster. He did nothing
the entire season, he did nothing
the final episode, and he was soon
eliminated in fifth place a
respectable finish that he certainly
did not earn. Thus, the final four
were all Villains, indicating that
perhaps playing ruthlessly is in
fact the better strategy. The next
to go was Jerri, a choice with
which I was once again extremely
pleased. The entire season, she
was nothing but a swing vote and,
in riding Russell's coattails, was
not deserving of the finals.
It's rare when all of the final
ists actually deserve their spot at
the last tribal council, but this
season got it right. Russell, Parvati
and Sandra were the top players,
each meriting, in a different way,
a chance to plead their case to the
jury for the million-dollar prize
and title. All three had made it to
the finals before (only one other
player, Amanda Kimmel, has
made it to final tribal twice) and
each knew how to address the
jury.
Russell controlled the entire
game basically from the begin
ning. He played aggressively and
used intimidation to his advan
tage, and this tactic worked
enough to easily get him to the
final. Although Sandra tried
relentlessly, never once was he
seriously on the chopping block.
On the other hand, Parvati had a
target on her back literally from
the very first vote. She played an
incredible social game, charming
everyone and teaming up with
Russell, as well as an impressive
physical game, winning numerous
individual immunity challenges.
She holds the title for most chal
lenge wins by a female and she
has spent more days playing

"Survivor" than any other con
testant with 114 under her belt.
Although both of the other
finalists played extremely well, the
jury awarded Sandra the title,
making her the only person to
win Survivor twice and proving
that she definitely knows how to
play the game. She is undeniably
terrible in the challenges, but she
makes up for her lack of athleti
cism in her great social game. She
always makes sure she knows
what's going on in the tribe, even
if she has to sneak around and
hide in a few bushes. She claims

that she is willing to vote off "any
one, as long as it ain't me," which
is a great strategy to always stay in
the majority.
Her greatest strength was that
she was not afraid of Russell,
whom the jury loathed; he
received zero votes, but regret
tably won the award chosen by
America. Multiple people on the
jury gave Sandra their vote
because she was the only player
bold enough to oppose Russell,
lury members also decided
against voting for Parvati simply
to spite Russell and because

Sandra Diaz-Twine, Parvati
Shallow, Russell Hantz, Jerri
Manthey and Colby Donaldson.
The game for the final immunity,
traversing a maze while blindfold
ed, was probably the most excit
ing challenge "Survivor" has ever
seen. Russell ultimately won, but
both Parvati and Jerri were also
inches from the finish. This

intense competition had Jeff

Probst proclaim, "In all of my

time on Survivor, that is one of
the most dramatic finishes of any
challenge, let alone the final
immunity challenge." Like always,
Jeff is exactly right. I know my
"Survivor" history, and that was
as close and exciting as it gets.
The five were eventually
whittled down to three. Arguably
the best part of the finale was
watching Colby Donaldson's torch
finally get snuffed. Although orig
inally touted as the epitome of a
Hero and a lovable favorite from
Season Two, which took place in
Australia, this season's Colby was
beyond lackluster. He did nothing
the entire season, he did nothing
the final episode, and he was soon
eliminated in fifth place a
respectable finish that he certainly
did not earn. Thus, the final four
were all Villains, indicating that
perhaps playing ruthlessly is in
fact the better strategy. The next
to go was Jerri, a choice with
which I was once again extremely
pleased. The entire season, she
was nothing but a swing vote and,
in riding Russell's coattails, was
not deserving of the finals.
It's rare when all of the final
ists actually deserve their spot at
the last tribal council, but this
season got it right. Russell, Parvati
and Sandra were the top players,
each meriting, in a different way,
a chance to plead their case to the
jury for the million-dollar prize
and title. All three had made it to
the finals before (only one other
player, Amanda Kimmel, has
made it to final tribal twice) and
each knew how to address the
jury.
Russell controlled the entire
game basically from the begin
ning. He played aggressively and
used intimidation to his advan
tage, and this tactic worked
enough to easily get him to the
final. Although Sandra tried
relentlessly, never once was he
seriously on the chopping block.
On the other hand, Parvati had a
target on her back literally from
the very first vote. She played an
incredible social game, charming
everyone and teaming up with
Russell, as well as an impressive
physical game, winning numerous
individual immunity challenges.
She holds the title for most chal
lenge wins by a female and she
has spent more days playing

"Survivor" than any other con
testant with 114 under her belt.
Although both of the other
finalists played extremely well, the
jury awarded Sandra the title,
making her the only person to
win Survivor twice and proving
that she definitely knows how to
play the game. She is undeniably
terrible in the challenges, but she
makes up for her lack of athleti
cism in her great social game. She
always makes sure she knows
what's going on in the tribe, even
if she has to sneak around and
hide in a few bushes. She claims

that she is willing to vote off "any
one, as long as it ain't me," which
is a great strategy to always stay in
the majority.
Her greatest strength was that
she was not afraid of Russell,
whom the jury loathed; he
received zero votes, but regret
tably won the award chosen by
America. Multiple people on the
jury gave Sandra their vote
because she was the only player
bold enough to oppose Russell,
lury members also decided
against voting for Parvati simply
to spite Russell and because
