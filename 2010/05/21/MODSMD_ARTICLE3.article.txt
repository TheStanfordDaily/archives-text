## GSB paves way for GRE Business schools adopt Stanford's test policy 
### CASSANDRA FELICIANO STAFF WRITER 
Admission trends show that more
than 300 business schools, including the
top M.B.A. program schools, are follow
ing Stanford's lead in giving applicants
the option of taking the GRE in place of
the GMAT, according to a recent piece in
U.S. News & World Report.

"I think other schools have similar ad
missions practices, similar admission
goals and similar admission pressures to
the ones facing Stanford," said Derrick
Bolton, dean of admission at Stanford's
Graduate School of Business (GSB)."So
it's logical that different schools would
reach the same conclusion, especially if
they've seen a school take action in an
area and been able to watch the results of
that."

The GSB, which ties for the coveted
top spot in U.S. News' rankings for busi
ness schools across the country, made the
decision to alter its testing policies in
2005 because "it just made sense,"
Bolton said. Most of the school's Ph.D.
programs have always offered that op
tion and it seemed logical that the
M.B.A. program do the same not to
mention that the GRE provided an ever
favored boost in the M.B.A. program's
accessibility.

On average, Stanford's GSB has a
higher number of joint-degree students
than any other institution, and admission
officials believed that providing that lee
way in test-taking would make the appli
cation process easier and more appeal
ing to a wider range of students.
"You've got to ask yourself if you
have a student who's looking at a pro
gram in design and a program in business
or a program in bioengineering and a
program in business, does it make more
sense for a design school to take the
GMAT or for the business school to take
the GRE?" Bolton said.

But accessibility, a concern for admis
sion officials at the GSB, also means ap
pealing to affordability as well as appli
cant interest. The GRE, which costs ap
proximately $l4O, is less expensive than
the $250 GMAT a factor that increas
es in value especially because many stu-

dents take these exams multiple times.
