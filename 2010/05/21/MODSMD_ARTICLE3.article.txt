## GSB paves way for GRE Business schools adopt Stanford's test policy 
### CASSANDRA FELICIANO STAFF WRITER 
Admission trends show that more
than 300 business schools, including the
top M.B.A. program schools, are follow
ing Stanford's lead in giving applicants
the option of taking the GRE in place of
the GMAT, according to a recent piece in
U.S. News & World Report.

"I think other schools have similar ad
missions practices, similar admission
goals and similar admission pressures to
the ones facing Stanford," said Derrick
Bolton, dean of admission at Stanford's
Graduate School of Business (GSB)."So
it's logical that different schools would
reach the same conclusion, especially if
they've seen a school take action in an
area and been able to watch the results of
that."

The GSB, which ties for the coveted
top spot in U.S. News' rankings for busi
ness schools across the country, made the
decision to alter its testing policies in
2005 because "it just made sense,"
Bolton said. Most of the school's Ph.D.
programs have always offered that op
tion and it seemed logical that the
M.B.A. program do the same not to
mention that the GRE provided an ever
favored boost in the M.B.A. program's
accessibility.

On average, Stanford's GSB has a
higher number of joint-degree students
than any other institution, and admission
officials believed that providing that lee
way in test-taking would make the appli
cation process easier and more appeal
ing to a wider range of students.
"You've got to ask yourself if you
have a student who's looking at a pro
gram in design and a program in business
or a program in bioengineering and a
program in business, does it make more
sense for a design school to take the
GMAT or for the business school to take
the GRE?" Bolton said.

But accessibility, a concern for admis
sion officials at the GSB, also means ap
pealing to affordability as well as appli
cant interest. The GRE, which costs ap
proximately $l4O, is less expensive than
the $250 GMAT a factor that increas
es in value especially because many stu-

dents take these exams multiple times.
"We have one of the largest and
the strongest applicant pools in the
world for a business school but we
are always looking for competitive
candidates," Bolton said. "If we have
a sense that we've put an unnecessary
barrier in front of some that we can
have an effect by removing barriers
then we will do that."
This change has proven to be suc
cessful beyond the three-year pilot
period it was allowed, Bolton said.
Although he declined to comment
further on the diversity of the M.B. A.
program's applicant pool, Bolton
said officials have made assessments
every year since 2005 and been
pleased with the results.
"That increase follows our accept
ance of the GRE but I can't say that it's

driven by our acceptance of the GRE,"
he added. "I think it's really driven by
our new curriculum and I think the
general view of the marketplace of
how successful that curriculum is and
how engaging it is for students."
The shift in curriculum objectives
made in 2007 focused on recognizing
the different experiences and ambi
tions that current GSB students and
applicants brought with them, and al
lowing more options in this aspect of
the admission process maintained
this standard.
That said, there are many other in
stitutions that did not pursue this path.
Business schools around the area such
as Haas at UC-Berkeley and Leavey
at Santa Clara both of whom de
clined an interview with The Daily
still accept only GMAT scores.
"Each institution is operating on
its own best interests," said Bolton,
who is hesitant to make any assump
tions on behalf of other institutions.
"The school that decides not to ac

cept the GRE certainly has a ration
ale for that. Part of it may be just fear
of how the students will perform in
the classroom or it may be lack of un
derstanding how to interpret the test.
There are fifty reasons you could list
[and] I'm not sure for any particular
school what the factors would be."
