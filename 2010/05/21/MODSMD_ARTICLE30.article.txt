Beautiful moves, dirty words
and fluorescent tutus
"The Voguette" is a show
unlike any other.
Temoc Peranda 'lO, a.k.a Devin
Lauren, has spent the past year
researching voguing for his thesis in
Comparative Studies in Race and
Ethnicity, and his work culminates
in this weekend's performance of
"The Voguette."
The show features The House

of Devin Vindiction Dance
Company, an intimate collective of
Stanford-affiliated dancers who
learned the art of voguing under
Peranda's guidance. Voguing is a
type of dance with roots in black
and Latin queer subculture. This
unique art form is primarily prac
ticed in the gay inner-city ballroom
and club scene, and it involves diva
esque posing and extravagantly
expressive body movements.

In one word, "Voguette" is wild.
A fabulous soundtrack and funky
set shimmery chandeliers and
super stilletos hang from the ceiling
serves as the ideal backdrop to
the madness that is voguing. Bodies
fly across the stage; jumping, drop
ping, and posing to the beat. It's all
about fierceness the dancers

exude a sort of positive intensity
and self-love unique to the world of
voguing. Peranda believes that the

significance of the show lies in the
dancers' performances of identity;
each dancer discovers himself or
herself through the movements of
the body. It's this sort of perspective
on the performance that leads
Peranda to call his work "academic
art" he explores the performativ
ity of voguing as well as the inter
sectionality of identities through
the creation of his art. But don't let
all that performance theory get you

down; in the end, "The Voguette" is
all about fabulous, fierce, flamboy
ant fun.
According to Peranda, this is
the third time voguing has been
performed on a stage. It has been
extracted from the inner-city club
scene and re-contextualized on the
sanitized stage of Prosser Studio for
all of Stanford to see. Thanks to the
House of Devin Vindiction, you can
enjoy the club without the club. No
sweat, no nudity and no cover
charge.
"The Voguette" is a theatrical

extravaganza that is both elegant
and electrifying. You can feel the
fierceness flowing as the dancers
strike their poses and get done up
in drag. In the words of Temoc
Peranda, "It's a show you need to
see to understand."
