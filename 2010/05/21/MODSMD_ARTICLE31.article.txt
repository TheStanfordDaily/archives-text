This week, Roble Theater will
host the premiere of
"Abraham Niu & The
Friendly Fires" Audiences will be
stunned to learn that all of it was
written and scored by one Stanford
student, Karmia Chan Cao 'll.
I arrive a little early to find the
cast sitting in a circle singing
together, and I don't mean just
rehearsing: singing. It's rare to find
such unity in a group that's only
been together for a month. But it's
probably more rare to see a
Stanford undergrad writing, scor
ing, directing, producing and per-

forming in her own original musi
cal.
From the woman who brought
us "Forgetting Tiburon" last year,
"Abraham Niu & The Friendly
Fires" journeys through a family
home in Canada to Afghanistan's
front lines to a luminal dream space
for the dying and the remembering.
Abraham (Peter Zou 'l2), the
beloved first son, sacrifices himself
in the war. As he heads for the here
after, his mother (Natalia Duong
'10) collapses into a coma, leaving
the family in misery and panic. As
their dreams and memories collide
on stage, the story opens up to dis
charged love and grievance and a
digging at secrets, hauntings and

heritage. Abraham Niu's name is a
pun that modernizes the old tale of
Abraham: father of faith, through
whom all generations were blessed.
The high caliber of writing is to
be expected from Cao by now, but
still, one doesn't expect to find such
integrity and professionalism in a
student work. Since "Forgetting
Tiburon," Cao has moved away
from spoken-word monologues and
learned to trust the chemistry
between her actors in dialogue. She
paces humor with drama and poet
ry, and her gift for character brings
us rounded, vivacious people who

swear, hate, lie and sing; the
younger brother (sweetly played by
Albert Chu '10) is the only charac
ter given short shrift. Old stage
tricks are reinvented here, like a
smug onstage narrator, an onstage
side scene's "volume" tuning down
or likewise a standing radio (Helena
Bonde '11) turned off.
The performances are shy of
perfect; but where the acting falters,
the music offers backup, and vice
versa. Unfamiliar hugs and awkward
hand-holding are overshadowed by
the pathos of the story I can crit
icize, but I still got tremendous
chills. Duong steals the show: her
acting and smoky voice bring
"Abraham Niu" all the way home.

Amanda Gelender 'lO as Gator/Lego
commands authority and outra
geous humor with unforgettable
stage presence. Zou is a shaky
Abraham, but when the tension is
taut, he pulls it off; his execution of
the play's final lines is superb. James
Xie 'lO as the father also delivers his
best game when he lets loose. Atha
Fong 'lO brings her own spunk as

the youngest daughter with heart
breaking performance and tender
song. Singing talents Shira Stites 'lO
and Ariel Mazel-Gee 'l2 raise the
bar; Hari Rai Khalsa and Brady
Fukumoto on taiko drums add a
unique dimension to the scenes.
I only saw a rough cut of the
music, but I'm enchanted. I haven't
heard musical styles blended for a

score like this since Greg
Edmonson's work on "Firefly." It's
an all-live ensemble of mostly folk,
pop and rock, but includes throat
singing from Mongolian tradition
and, if you listen closely, undertones
of Chinese influences twanging

through Western sounds; even a
Native American flute emerges. The
innovation of one scene is worth
noting, in which there is miscom
munication between Sophie and her
mother, first by talking over one
another, then by overlapping songs
with monosyllabic sounds instead
of words. Background instrumen
tals during scenes are cinematic and
well timed without excess silence
is implemented well for the sake of
story.

"Abraham Niu" is balanced
entirely. You can go for the music,
for the writing or for the acting, but
you'll be beguiled by its whole con
stellation of virtues. All parts of this
production count, flawed but inex
tricable and full of heart. If you've
seen the show flyers with the
Banksy stencil ("Rioter With
Flowers") on it, you won't be mis
led. This show is art for a change:

it's subaltern, it's international, it
speaks loudly for multiple lan
guages. This is a workshop produc
tion, which means actors will be
holding scripts, the set will be
incomplete, and following the show
will be discussion and audience

input. It's a rare privilege to partici
pate in a piece like this.
Find the show at the Roble
Dorm Theater this Thursday and
Friday night at 8 p.m. and Saturday
at 5 p.m. Come an hour earlier too
for "Wealth of Words," directed by
Heather Buckelew'lo. If "Abraham
Niu" is any measure of STAMP'S
standards of quality, both shows
will be remembered as an end-of
the-year hit. "After winds have spun
to nothing / After stars have played
their last / When all mothers call
their children / And their children
skip on back..."
