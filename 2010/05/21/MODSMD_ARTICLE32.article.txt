# It's Charity, Bitch

Andy Warhol's famous dic
tum, "Everyone will be
world-famous for 15 min
utes" was presciently accurate for 38
gorgeous Stanford students last
Saturday. A highly anticipated
annual event, Charity Fashion Show

(CFS) drew hundreds of spectators,
photographers and designers alike
to the colossal $50,000 tent erected
on Roble Field.
The show featured 25 design
ers, most of who are locally based,
as well as impressive pieces from

four high school interns and such
lionized names as Nanette Lapore
and Eva Franco. With 25 consecu
tive sets displayed by 55 models
38 of whom were college students
and hundreds of priceless gar
ments housed in a make-shift back
stage delineated by portion of lawn,
there was definite potential for

chaos. But executive director Thom

Scher' 11 and director of develop
ment Stephanie Werner 'll some
how managed to make it work
and splendidly so.
"It's completely crazy," Werner
states as she momentarily allows
herself to catch her breath. "We've
been up and running since 5:30
a.m. and we've added the diamond
at the end of the runway." I look up
from my notebook and she's van
ished.
Although it is an entirely stu
dent-run production, CFS has
recently been dubbed the largest
fashion show on the West Coast and
nearly doubled in capacity since the
previous year.
So how do hundreds of glitzy
garments, extortionate stilettos and
opulent accessories perform philan
thropy, one might ask. The "charity"
behind Charity Fashion Show is
executed via a donation to an annu
ally nominated beneficiary that the
board of directors believes befits
CFS's specific vocation. This time

around, the organization will
bestow all revenue to the non-prof
it, micro-finance organization Kiva,
which aspires to alleviate poverty by
connecting people through lending.
Kiva, launched by Stanford alumni,
enables individual lenders to grant
micro-loans to noteworthy entre
preneurs around the world. It is
Charity Fashion Show's aim to pair

up with Kiva in order to "fund
loans specifically designed for entre
preneurs in the fashion and gar
ment industry."
The opening guest perform
ance by San Francisco-based alter
native-electro group Fans of Jimmy
Century was off-putting to say the
least. Fiery redheaded vocalist Alicia
Peron was not exactly successful in
galvanizing the crowd for the ensu
ing event. But as soon as the lights
dimmed and the eloquent Scher
treaded onto the catwalk, the audi
ence was instantly animated and
became increasingly so as CFS's
promotional video flashed across
the backdrop.
The show opened with Dutch
designer Tosca Soraya's line, and
although black and white seemed to
be the colors du jour, don't desig
nate her collection gothic. On the
contrary, it had a luxe feminine feel,
with lacy eyelet trim on everything
from collars and petticoats to patent
leather sweatshirts. Soraya's fierce
collection immediately took a color
ful turn with splatter-painted leg
gings and bodysuits, and gowns
boasting watercolor-like geometric
prints. Additionally, her architectur
al garments incorporated waistlines
that were both low slung and
cinched at the ribcage, providing a

variation for every figure.
As the evening unfolded, mod
els strutted to remixes of Brit-pop
phenomenon M.I.A, as well as
mash-ups of Fiest, Santogold and
the French quartet Phoenix before
suggestively sauntering down the
catwalk to ACDC's "You Shook Me

All Night Long." In this raunchy set,
negligibly attired girls swaggered
down the runway in nothing but
pinstriped men's dress shirts and
knee-socks, accompanied by their
polka-dotted boxer-bearing con
temporaries.

Toward the end of the show,
the menswear collection Kent
Denim surprisingly garnered the
most whistles and cat calls due to
the well-sculpted torsos that graced
the runway. The collection was a
standout stockpile of modern sta
ples that were paradoxically Western

with a metropolitan appeal. Crafted
out of high-end materials like
brushed herringbone, checkered
plaid and crisply structured tweed,
the collection looked stunning
hanging from the brawny shoulders
of Stanford students.
As the evening came to a close
the tent was abuzz with swooning
fashionistas and the occasional
proud parent, all exclaiming that
the event was the best it had ever
been. Charity Fashion Show is a
must-see for next year because let's
face it, nothing tops watching your
friends conquer the catwalk
bedecked in designer duds. Besides,
as first-year model Kiyan Williams
'l3 so accurately mused, "It's chari
ty, bitch."
