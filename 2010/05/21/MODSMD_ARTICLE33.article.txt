By definition, "Upfronts"
week is when the major
networks ABC, NBC,
FOX and CBS (whose new shows
unfortunately will be announced
after my deadline) congregate
to sell advertisers on their new fall
shows with lots of four-minute
clips. One hour and lots of click
ing and scrolling later, I am here
to tell you, which shows will have
the best ads and maybe some
good content in between.

ABC
This network won the 2009-
10 season with the prize horse
they should make a Disney athlet
ic movie about, "Modern Family."
NBC even acknowledged defeat
by featuring the cast and crew on
an episode of "Top Chef Masters,"
which airs on the NBC-owned
cable channel Bravo. ABC is
tonally distinct from its main
competitors CBS and NBC in that
it prefers soap opera faire

("Grey's," "Desperate
Housewives," "Castle") to crime
procedural and intense reality
TV shows. Not much of this looks
to change for next year, so I
would venture that the network
will remain on top in the quality
bin.
Say goodbye to: "Ugly Betty,"
"Scrubs," "The Deep End," "Better
Off Ted," "Flash Forward," "Happy
Town"
Say hello! to: "Mr. Sunshine"
(which features Allison Janney!),
"Off the Map" (more Shonda
Rhimes), "Body of Proof"
(Katherine from "Desperate" gets
her own show), "My Generation,"
two shows with laugh tracks,
something with lawyers

NBC
NBC is like a girl who gets

proposed to all the time, but then
gets those engagements broken
with equal frequency. In our age
group, NBC is probably more
successful than even ABC, with
what I have termed the Quixotic
Quartet of Thursday:
"Community," "Parks and
Recreation," "The Office" and "30
Rock." The network also has "Law
and Order" on lockdown with
suffixes like SVU and now LA! I

predict that NBC will still be on
the bottom next year ... and the
year after that if Steve Carell
leaves.
Say goodbye to: "Law and Order"
(the vanilla kind), "Heroes,"
"Mercy," "Trauma"
Say hello! to: "The Event" (could
n't even tell you), "Undercovers"
(the new "Mr. and Mrs. Smith"),

two somethings with lawyers who
like to do pro bono work,
"Outsourced" (replacing "Parks
and Recreation" for the fall to sat
urate the Indian stereotype mar
ket), LOTS of awkward sex come
dies and "THE CAPE" (cop is
accused of a crime, joins a circus
to become a superhero. Yes, this is
real).

FOX
I would describe Fox as a
musical potpourri. Though my
use of the word "heinous" in its
presence never seems to abate, I
can't say no to that dirty trashy
Fox aesthetic. And America can't
either: Fox is the nation's No. 1
network. All I'm hoping for is
"More to Love" Season 2.
Say goodbye to: "24," "Dollhouse,"
"Til' Death"
Say hello! to: "Ride-Along"
(Chicago! Girl from "The L
Word!"), "Running Wilde" (Keri
Russell and Will Arnett... awk
ward), "Terra Nova" (dinosaurs)
