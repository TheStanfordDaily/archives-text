## Stanford battles rival UCLA for a berth in the NCAA quarterfinals 
### MICHAEL LAZARUS STAFF WRITER 
After sweeping Pepperdine in the
second round of the NCAA Tourna
ment, the No. 7 Stanford men's tennis
team is gearing up to face No. 9
UCLA, one of its biggest rivals during
the season. The teams will battle for a
spot in the quarterfinals in Athens,
Ga., the site of the tournament's last
four rounds.
"There's a lot of excitement when
you know this is what you've been
working toward for eight months,"
sophomore Bradley Klahn said. "This
is it. This is what everything comes
down to."

The Cardinal flew into Georgia on
Tuesday and has spent the last few
days getting acclimated to the pace
and intensity of the tournament. One
thing that has made the transition a bit
easier is the weather.

"I was expecting 80 [degrees] and
muggy," Klahn said. "It hasn't been
that bad."

That could all change today
though, as the forecast calls for scat
tered thunderstorms and high humid
ity. If it does rain, Stanford will be pre
pared for any possible delays. The
Cardinal played much of its season
under constant threat of rain, which
forced matches to start late or play
doubles first.

In fact, a Stanford-UCLA match
was cancelled on Feb. 26 due to rain.

Assuming the weather does not
impact the match significantly, the
Cardinal should expect much of the
same as the last time it faced the Bru
ins, on April 3 in Los Angeles.
That day Stanford pulled out a
nail-biting 4-3 victory to keep its Pac
-10 championship dreams alive, which
it went on to realize with a victory
against California to end the regular
season. Doubles victories by the
teams of senior Richard Wire and jun
ior Alex Clayton, and freshman Matt

Kandath and junior Greg Hirshman,
gave Stanford an early lead.
Singles victories by Klahn and Hir
shman put Stanford within one point
of the victory. With sophomore Ryan
Thacher, freshman Denis Lin and
Wire all losing, the pressure was on
Clayton. The captain pulled off a grit
ty 6-4, 2-6, 7-5 victory to seal the win
for Stanford.

"We both know each other's game
real well and we play them a lot,"
Klahn said. "We've seen their guys a
lot and they've seen us. We just have to
be ready to fight for every point."
Two keys to Stanford's success
today will be the play of Klahn and
Thacher in doubles and Clayton in
singles.

Once the top-ranked team in the
nation, the duo of Klahn and Thacher
has lost only seven matches this sea
son. Two of those losses came against
UCLA's Amit Inbar and Nick Meister
the opponents Klahn and Thacher
will face today. If the sophomores can
pull off a victory, it will give Stanford a
great shot at winning the doubles
