## Women's tennis advances to NCAA quarterfinals 
### â€”Kabir Sawhney 
In the NCAA Tournament's round of 16
last night in Athens, Ga., the Stanford
women's tennis team punched its ticket to the
quarterfinals with a sweep of No. 9 Clemson
(24-6, 9-2 ACC). The Cardinal (23-1, 8-0 Pac
-10) won the doubles point and sealed the 4-0
win with three straight-sets victories in the sin
gles lineup.
The three doubles matches went first and
saw Stanford junior Hilary Barte and senior
Lindsay Burdette locked in a close battle with
Clemson's top doubles team of Josipa Bek and
Ina Hadziselimovic. Barte and Burdette are
ranked as the No. 2 doubles team in the country.
However, their match ended locked in an
8-8 draw, as Stanford's other two doubles
teams both delivered victories to notch the
doubles point. Both matches were also closely
contested, with freshmen Mallory Burdette
and Stacey Tan pulling out a 9-7 win and jun
ior Carolyn McVeigh and sophomore Veroni
ca Li getting an 8-6 win in the third match.
While the doubles draw delivered some
close matches, the Cardinal dominated the
singles matches. Once again, the lower tiers
of Stanford's lineup proved key. Playing in
the second spot, Lindsay Burdette swept her
opponent 6-1, 6-3, while Mallory Burdette
won 6-1, 6-4 at third singles.
McVeigh rounded out the victory
with a 6-1,6-2 win from the fifth sin
gles position.
Stanford's next opponent is a fa
miliar one Baylor.The Lady Bears
have bounced the Cardinal from the
postseason the last two seasons.

ters the match as the top-seeded team
in the tournament and the No. 1 team
in the country.The Lady Bears,like the
Cardinal, have swept all three of their
opponents so far.

Saturday at 2 p.m. PST.
