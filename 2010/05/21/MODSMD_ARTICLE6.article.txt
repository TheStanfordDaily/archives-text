# TOURNAMENT ON THE FARM
## No. 21 Hawaii is top seed in regional hosted by Stanford 
### KABIR SAWHNEY DESK EDITOR 
The No. 17 Stanford Softball team's
roller coaster of a season will enter its final
stages this weekend, as the Farm plays host
to an NCAA Regional. The regional group
will pit the Cardinal (36-17, 8-13 Pac-10)
against Texas Tech (36-16), UC-Davis (26-
27) and No. 21 Hawaii (44-13), the 16th
seeded team overall.
Stanford will enter the tournament after
an inconsistent season that saw the team
start strong but fade down the stretch.
The Cardinal showed incredible prom
ise early in the season. Prior to the start of
conference play, Stanford participated in
six tournaments around the country, includ
ing two at home. It never lost more than
once in each tournament, and ended March
with an incredible record of 25-4.
However, Stanford proved incapable of
sustaining its momentum against the tough
teams of its conference. The Pac-10 is cer
tainly one of college Softball's power con-

ferences, with four teams currently in the
top 10 (including unanimous No. 1 Wash
ington, the conference champion).

Though it had a strong start to the sea

son, winning series against both California
and Oregon State, things began to unravel
in a weekend series against Arizona, which
started on April 16. Stanford was swept that
weekend, and found itself in a tailspin,
going 3-11 over the next four weeks (with
two of those wins coming against weaker
non-conference opponents).
Perhaps not coincidentally, Stanford's
slide began with the injury to freshman
pitcher Teagan Gerhart in the series against
the Wildcats. Gerhart had emerged as the
Card's ace, and her loss proved to be a blow
that Stanford's pitching staff took a while to
recover from.

Gerhart has not pitched in over a month,
but she has played in Stanford's last few se
ries as a pinch runner and her status is cur
rently reported as "day-to-day."
The Card was able to regain some mo
mentum last weekend, sweeping Oregon to
salvage its season and give itself something
positive to build on at NCAAs.

Stanford ended the season tied with the
Ducks for sixth out of eight teams in the
Pac-10. Every Pac-10 team except for Ore
gon State earned a berth to the 64-team
NCAA Tournament field, with conference
champion Washington earning the third

NOTES : After a tumultuous regular season, Stanford
will open the Stanford Regional of the NCAA Tourna
ment this weekend. Hawaii is the top-seeded team in
the region. UC-Davis rounds out the regional. Stan
ford split two games with the Rainbow Wahine and
beat the Aggies twice in the regular season.

seed overall.
For Stanford to be competitive in its region
al, its offense will have to overcome the incon
sistency problems that have plagued it for
much of the season. The lineup did manage to
regain some spark against Oregon, but had
been anemic against the rest of the confer
ence's competition.
Senior left fielder Alissa Haber, an All-
American, has been the offense's top performer
all season. Her .442 average, .644 slugging per
centage and .531 on-base percentage all lead the
team. Other offensive standouts include fresh
man shortstop Jenna Rich, who leads the Card
with 12 home runs and 46 RBIs and is second in
slugging percentage at .627, and sophomore sec
ond baseman Ashley Hansen, who is second in
RBIs with 37. On the defensive side, Stanford is
led by senior catcher Rosey Neill, who was
named Pac-10 Defensive Player of the Year for
the third consecutive season.
In the circle, Stanford only has two true
pitchers, Gerhart and junior Ashley Chinn.
Prior to her injury, Gerhart had been domi
nant, posting a record of 22-6 and a 1.65 ERA.
Chinn has a record of 11-8 and an ERA of 2.91,
but her pitching has steadily improved over the
season. She pitched three complete games
against the Ducks last weekend, getting credit
for the win in each one. Rich has also stepped
in at various times during the season, and has a
3-3 record with a 4.98 ERA.
Now, Stanford will vie with the Red
Raiders, the Aggies and the Rainbow Wahine
to advance. The four teams will compete in a
double-elimination bracket over the weekend,
with the winner earning a berth into an NCAA
Super Regional.
Stanford played both UC-Davis and
Hawaii during the regular season. The Cardi
nal dominated the Aggies, defeating them in
both meetings. Stanford and Hawaii also faced

off twice in the first tournament of the season,
the Paradise Softball Classic in Honolulu,
Hawaii. The teams split their two games, with
Stanford taking the first and the Rainbow
Wahine winning the second.
Stanford will play Texas Tech tonight at 6
p.m. at Smith Family Stadium following UC-
Davis vs. Hawaii at 3 p.m. The Red Raiders
ended the season in sixth place in the Big 12,
with a 7-11 conference record.
After Friday's game, the rest of the
matchups will be determined by each game's
results, with the other regional games taking
place on Saturday and Sunday.

For Stanford to be competitive in its region
al, its offense will have to overcome the incon
sistency problems that have plagued it for
much of the season. The lineup did manage to
regain some spark against Oregon, but had
been anemic against the rest of the confer
ence's competition.
Senior left fielder Alissa Haber, an All-
American, has been the offense's top performer
all season. Her .442 average, .644 slugging per
centage and .531 on-base percentage all lead the
team. Other offensive standouts include fresh
man shortstop Jenna Rich, who leads the Card
with 12 home runs and 46 RBIs and is second in
slugging percentage at .627, and sophomore sec
ond baseman Ashley Hansen, who is second in
RBIs with 37. On the defensive side, Stanford is
led by senior catcher Rosey Neill, who was
named Pac-10 Defensive Player of the Year for
the third consecutive season.
In the circle, Stanford only has two true
pitchers, Gerhart and junior Ashley Chinn.
Prior to her injury, Gerhart had been domi
nant, posting a record of 22-6 and a 1.65 ERA.
Chinn has a record of 11-8 and an ERA of 2.91,
but her pitching has steadily improved over the
season. She pitched three complete games
against the Ducks last weekend, getting credit
for the win in each one. Rich has also stepped
in at various times during the season, and has a
3-3 record with a 4.98 ERA.
Now, Stanford will vie with the Red
Raiders, the Aggies and the Rainbow Wahine
to advance. The four teams will compete in a
double-elimination bracket over the weekend,
with the winner earning a berth into an NCAA
Super Regional.
Stanford played both UC-Davis and
Hawaii during the regular season. The Cardi
nal dominated the Aggies, defeating them in
both meetings. Stanford and Hawaii also faced

off twice in the first tournament of the season,
the Paradise Softball Classic in Honolulu,
Hawaii. The teams split their two games, with
Stanford taking the first and the Rainbow
Wahine winning the second.
Stanford will play Texas Tech tonight at 6
p.m. at Smith Family Stadium following UC-
Davis vs. Hawaii at 3 p.m. The Red Raiders
ended the season in sixth place in the Big 12,
with a 7-11 conference record.
After Friday's game, the rest of the
matchups will be determined by each game's
results, with the other regional games taking
place on Saturday and Sunday.
