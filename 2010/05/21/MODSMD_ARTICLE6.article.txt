# TOURNAMENT ON THE FARM
## No. 21 Hawaii is top seed in regional hosted by Stanford 
### KABIR SAWHNEY DESK EDITOR 
The No. 17 Stanford Softball team's
roller coaster of a season will enter its final
stages this weekend, as the Farm plays host
to an NCAA Regional. The regional group
will pit the Cardinal (36-17, 8-13 Pac-10)
against Texas Tech (36-16), UC-Davis (26-
27) and No. 21 Hawaii (44-13), the 16th
seeded team overall.
Stanford will enter the tournament after
an inconsistent season that saw the team
start strong but fade down the stretch.
The Cardinal showed incredible prom
ise early in the season. Prior to the start of
conference play, Stanford participated in
six tournaments around the country, includ
ing two at home. It never lost more than
once in each tournament, and ended March
with an incredible record of 25-4.
However, Stanford proved incapable of
sustaining its momentum against the tough
teams of its conference. The Pac-10 is cer
tainly one of college Softball's power con-

ferences, with four teams currently in the
top 10 (including unanimous No. 1 Wash
ington, the conference champion).

Though it had a strong start to the sea

son, winning series against both California
and Oregon State, things began to unravel
in a weekend series against Arizona, which
started on April 16. Stanford was swept that
weekend, and found itself in a tailspin,
going 3-11 over the next four weeks (with
two of those wins coming against weaker
non-conference opponents).
Perhaps not coincidentally, Stanford's
slide began with the injury to freshman
pitcher Teagan Gerhart in the series against
the Wildcats. Gerhart had emerged as the
Card's ace, and her loss proved to be a blow
that Stanford's pitching staff took a while to
recover from.

Gerhart has not pitched in over a month,
but she has played in Stanford's last few se
ries as a pinch runner and her status is cur
rently reported as "day-to-day."
The Card was able to regain some mo
mentum last weekend, sweeping Oregon to
salvage its season and give itself something
positive to build on at NCAAs.

Stanford ended the season tied with the
Ducks for sixth out of eight teams in the
Pac-10. Every Pac-10 team except for Ore
gon State earned a berth to the 64-team
NCAA Tournament field, with conference
champion Washington earning the third
