## SPEAKERS & EVENTS Tenochtitlan draws crowd 
### IVY NGUYEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Beneath the second largest metro
politan area in the world sit the ruins
of the largest Spanish colonial city of
its time beneath that lies an even
older site, the city of Tenochtitlan, also
one of the largest metropolitan areas
of its time. For Leonardo Lopez
Lujan, senior researcher and profes
sor of archeology at Mexico's Nation
al Institute of Anthropology and His
tory, such a history can yield amazing
finds.
Lopez Lujan lectured last night on
his field work as part of the Archeolo
gy Center's Thursday lecture series.
"The archeology of Tenochtitlan is
unlike any other in the field of
Mesoamerican studies." Lopez Lujan
said. "It faces [the] same challenges as
archeology in Venice, Rome and
Jerusalem, whose vestiges lay be
neath a modern city."
Lopez Lujan's most recent findings
include a 13-ton statue of the Aztec
goddess Tlaltecuhtli, who was be
lieved to be the mother of life and a
deity with a voracious appetite,requir
ing frequent sacrifices of human and

animal blood and corpses. The statue
was found at Templo Mayor, one of
the main Aztec temples, located at the
center of present-day Mexico City.
Archeology Prof. John Rick, who
has major projects in South America
and did graduate work in Mexico, was
very impressed with Lopez Lujan.
"It's spectacular. I've been to this
site just shortly before the stone was
removed, the stone monolith, but this
updates my own experience in visiting
that place," Rick said. "This is a world
class talk, seeing world-class stuff
the latest discoveries with a top arche
ological intellectual who's not only
excavating, he's interpreting this stuff
with a depth of knowledge that is
world-class there's just no other
word for it."

Because Lujan must work around
the city's 20 million inhabitants, new
archeological sites are only uncov
ered during construction projects or
upgrades to the city utilities. Only 0.3
percent of the five square miles
spanned by Tenochtitlan at its height
has been uncovered.

"We frequently find the remains of
an ancient street or a pyramid or a
temple or a palace, but the problem

with excavating in a city is we can only
open small windows into the past to
look at what's below the surface,"
Lopez Lujan said. "We have only a
few pieces of a gigantic puzzle that we
know we will never be able to assem
ble completely."
Lindsay Montgomery, a first year
Ph.D. student in archeology, enjoyed
the connections Lopez Lujan's talk
had with her own work in indigenous
cultural heritage in the Southwest
United States.

"I thought it was really interesting,
especially in relationship with iconog
raphy and the gods," Montgomery
said. "In southwestern archeology
there are some similar connections in
burial rituals and god iconography, so
it's something to think about in terms
of my work."
Lopez Lujan's position as a senior
researcher of Mexico's state archeol
ogy program gives him a unique per
spective on the issues that Mexican
archeology faces. In the question-and
answer portion of the talk, Lopez
Lujan discussed issues ranging from
looting to economic pressure for the
government to permit concerts on
temple and pyramid sites, in spite of

the damage such large crowds could
inflict.

Lopez Lujan's passion for Aztec
history was instilled in him at at the
age of eight when he began working
with his mother, who was an assistant
to Mexico's top archeologist. Lopez
Lujan's father was also an Aztec his
torian, and his son works in the same

field.
Lopez Lujan said he and the peo
ple of Mexico feel strongly connected
to their indigenous roots, and these
discoveries help them strengthen
their connection.

"I am mestizo, a mixture of
Spaniard and native people, and
many of the people who are digging in

my team are native Mexicans," Lopez
Lujan said. "We are very proud of re
covering our own pasts, and it was a
very big privilege to come here to
such an important university in the
United States to share this past."
