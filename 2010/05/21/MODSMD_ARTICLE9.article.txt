the two.
"A white canister was found on a
patio," wrote Mirrielees Resident Fel
low James Cadena in an e-mail to res
idents on May 19. "It looks like an in
dustrial air freshener or some kind of
smoke detector. It has an adhesive
strip on the back which could attach
to a wall. The object was set up on a
table near the window of one of the
residents."
The Stanford Department of Pub
lic Safety responded to the incident.

able for comment.
"When they [the residents] discov
ered it and brought it in, they were
able to eject a sun disk which, when in
serted into a laptop, showed videos of
the occupants," Cadena wrote. "It
seems this device had been in and
around the patio for some weeks but
had not been poised in such an obvi
ous manner to record. The police have
this device in hand and are carrying
out an investigation."
The Stanford Department of Pub
lic Safety told The Daily on Thursday
