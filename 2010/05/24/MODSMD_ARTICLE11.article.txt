## THE
						GAO REPORT Res Ed Indoctrination? 
### Shelley Gao 
Given the announcement of the under
graduate housing draw last Friday,
residential education must have
passed through our minds once or twice in
the recent weeks. The theme of "housing at
Stanford" can be explored through various
lenses. Most of the current discussion is
based on the structural manifestation of res
idences. Undergraduate housing on the
Farm is highly decentralized. A multitude of
options is available post freshmen year. In
addition to traditional dormitories, there are
academic theme houses, ethnic theme hous
es, self-managed and cooperative residences,
apartments and suites.
Championing a distinct lifestyle, culture

and identity, each residence tends to at
tract a particular segment of the Stanford
population. The nature of housing actively
shapes the dynamics of student life. The
draw system can be perceived as the causal
link to fragmentation and a social scene that
is divided into clear and insular cliques. To
foster community building, some observers
propose that Stanford should adopt the resi
dential college system seen in our peer insti
tutions. Indeed, living in a residential college
with its own library, theatre and gym with
around 400 other students for four years
may improve broader campus cohesion.
An issue that warrants equal and perhaps
more attention should be the underlying
philosophy of residential education. Consis
tent with the current atmosphere of reform,
for instance, manifested in the Study of Un
dergraduate Education at Stanford (the first
major general curriculum review in 15
years), the Office of Student Affairs should
consider initiating an assessment of residen
tial education. This seems wonderfully ap
propriate, as "the essential conviction" of
residential education is that learning and liv
ing should be integrated. A comprehensive
action plan consisting of satisfaction surveys,
focus groups and town halls should be exe
cuted to reexamine residential education's
mission and how it is translated into practice.
Residential education tends to instill it
self most fervently in freshman dorms with
its robust, and, well, frankly overwhelming
programming. Dormitory experiences vary
significantly among students. Some form life
long friendships while others find it plainly
oppressive. At its best, residential education
enhances "students' preparation for a life of
leadership, intellectual engagement, citizen
ship and service," and at its worst, stifles in
dependent thinking, induces conformity and
indoctrinates.The challenge lies in managing
the tension between creating a sense of com
munity and allowing the freedom for indi
vidualism to flourish.
This is especially pertinent to freshman
dorms where the target of policies is a group
of 18-year-olds at one of the most emotion
ally vulnerable and socially insecure stages
of their lives. Residential education staff
must be more sensitive to the perhaps unin
tended psychological pressure and collective
coercion to participate in programming. The
staff must make sure to highlight the volun

tary nature of engagement in activities like
"crossing the line." Discussion about issues
like affirmative action, gay marriage, abor
tion and other controversial race, gender, or
sexuality concerns can certainly take place.
But, the framework must ensure that each
student is a willing participant and comfort
able with the dynamics of the discourse.
To be explicit, the danger in such pro
gramming is that on a campus dominated by
leftist ideology, conservative students may
be pressured to "adjust" their views. The
process of questioning, unseating or affirm
ing of pre-existing values is a normal part of
attending college. Intellectual broadening
through debate and introspection is expect
ed of a liberal arts education. This may occur
in and out of the classroom. The curriculum
landscape has already shifted from Western
Civilization to IHUM, diplomatic and mili
tary history to "social" history. It is only fair
to speculate that academia's liberal bias may
intrude into living spaces, silently and insidi
ously enforcing "politically correct" answers
to intrusive personal questions.
This discussion also raises the question of
what should be the balance between curric
ular and experiential education. Driven by
this "development of the rich complexity of
the whole person" rhetoric, residential edu
cation sounds perfectly beneficent. From lit
erature promising transformative personal
experiences, it seems like learning in and out
of the classroom, and really everywhere, is of
equal value. While the seamless integration
of the two spheres sounds charming, resi
dence halls should not displace the primacy
of classrooms.
Residential education must ensure that
non-discrimination toward "incorrect" be
liefs, embodied in one of its five primary
functions termed "pluralistic community"
actually manifests in practice. First, it needs
to make sure programs do not have an ideo
logical leaning. Second, it needs to incorpo
rate more "political or ideological diversity"
in its training for residential staff. Third, a
culture that respects individual autonomy
must be cultivated in the rigorously struc
tured freshman dormitory life. All these re
forms should be vigorously applied in fresh
man residences where the population is at
the greatest risk of conformity. The most im
portant principle residential education
should follow is that college is about making
our own decisions about what to do and
what to think.
