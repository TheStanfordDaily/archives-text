## Philosophical Change Needed for Stanford Residential Education 
### MOHAMMAD ALI, CLASS OF 2010 Resident Assistant, Wilbur 
The enhanced academic experi
ence, along with the personal, close
knit community fostered by residen
tial education at Stanford is truly
unique, and I cannot praise enough its
positive impact on my own personal
and intellectual development. That
being said, my experience as a Resi
dent Assistant this year has convinced
me that there needs to be a deep
philosophical change in the way Stan
ford Residential Education operates.
Since the majority of Stanford under
graduates live on campus throughout
their years as students, Stanford Res.
Ed. has the potential to greatly influ
ence our personalities, characters, and
understanding of the world.
Given the enormity of the task of
facilitating a peaceful and academic
learning environment in student dor
mitories, Resident Assistants (RA's)
the main points of connection be
tween administrators and residents
are required to attend a three-week
training session prior to the beginning
of the school year. In order to fulfill its
responsibility of "developing the poli
cies, programs, and staffing which sup
port the intellectual, educational, and
community-building activities in stu
dent residences" students are bom
barded with marginally useful semi
nars and lectures that a majority of
Resident Assistants do not attend (at
tendance is not kept). The result is a
student staff that is inadequately pre
pared to handle the countless issues
that arise university dormitories.
As a Resident Assistant, I am
deeply concerned with the policies in
place to address scenarios common in
freshmen dorms underage drink
ing, near fatal emergencies, room

mate conflicts, and sexual harass
ment. I will discuss underage drinking
as an example.
According to my understanding of
the law in the United States, individu
als under the age of 21 should not be
consuming or purchasing alcohol.
During RA training, however, this
matter is never directly addressed. In
stead, the expectation is that under
age freshmen and sophomores will
drink regardless, and that it is the
RA's job to deal with it.The illegal ac
tivity, however, is not the only prob
lem. In addition to breaking the law,
many of these students are belligerent
(I have been attacked by a resident)
and inconsiderate (I have had to step
in urine barefoot to make sure a resi
dent does not fall off his bed). When
an ambulance is called for an emer
gency, there is an unwritten expecta
tion that RA's will accompany the res
ident to the hospital for the remain
der of the night. Yet instead of tack
ling the core of the problem through
preventative measures, Res. Ed. holds
a reactive philosophy. Rather than en
couraging students not to drink ille
gally/irresponsibly, they are taught
how to deal with those that drink ille
gally/irresponsibly. The fact of the
matter is, by turning a blind-eye to un
derage drinking, we are implicitly
AND explicitly endorsing illegal and
often unethical behavior. To quote an
unheeded proposal put forth by a
Resident Fellow in Wilbur earlier this
year, "Dormitories and student
rooms [should not be] "safe havens"
from the police or other law enforce
ment authorities."

That these policies are out-of-step
and need to be updated is a given, and

is actually not the crux of the issue.
What is more fundamentally prob
lematic is the lack of transparency
and student input in formulating rules
and policies. This year, I have gone to
several Resident Deans for various is
sues, and have been consistently re
buffed with statements such as "I am
sorry you do not agree with our sys
tem" and "You have to go through a
process."This begs the question: What
is the meaning and role of the term
"Assistant" for the Resident Assis
tant? Rather than heeding our advice,
Stanford Residential Education has
operated as an independent entity
that does not really seek student input
or even consider our opinion serious
ly. The training period at the begin
ning of the year is helpful for learning
what the Resident Deans want from
Resident Assistants, but perhaps an
orientation from students to adminis
trators might be useful also.
Ultimately, I am writing this article
in an effort to help improve the sys
tem. I strongly believe Stanford Resi
dential Education has lost touch with
its original mission of helping stu
dents learn and develop by providing
them with support staff who can re
late because of their age and stage in
life. There is a reason Resident Assis
tants are students we have an oth
erwise unavailable perspective of res
idential problems. As such, it is vital
that residential administrators listen
to Resident Assistants rather than fol
low outdated procedures and proto
cols that do not take into account the
reality of the situation.
