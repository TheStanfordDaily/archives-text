# UNFASHIONABLE NONSENSE
## Black Holes and Expectations 
### Emily Hulme 
Trivial yet relevant personal informa
tion: I was once a freshman. In fact, I
was once a first quarter freshman, back
in the old days when Peet's in Tresidder was
not Fraiche and the Axe and Palm was new
and professors complained about W. in pres
ent tense. As you can surmise, times have
changed.
Now, like most freshmen, I had expecta
tions about what I would be "someday." I re
member seeing some juniors identifiable
by their world-weary smiles and the menfolk's
scruff talking about dinner plans at said
Peet's location. They talked about PA restau
rants with the confidence only old age and ex
perience brings. If you blindfolded them and
handed them a Rum and Coke, they could tell
you whether it was from Old Pro or Nola just
by the smell of it. I was sure they could.
But, now I am a junior, and not a fall quar
ter junior, but a spring quarter one, so far over
the hill I can't even remember the climb. I've
stayed here both summers and lived off-cam
pus, and while I know, in fact, my way around
Trader Joe's like Liz Lemon around a donut
shop, I sure as hell can't ramble on about PA
like those students did. Now, it might be that
students were just better educated in the past.
Maybe in IHUM they taught "Local Dining
Environs" right after the section on fighting
communism. Or maybe I just dreamed up the
sagacity of those students, and pressed my
own expectations of my future left on them. I
thought, after all, like most freshmen, that I
would become cooler when I was older. I
thought that awkward turtles evolved into
suave turtles. It turns out that their awkward
ness just becomes entrenched.
It was from another one of those patio ta
bles at Tresidder that I watched an Obama
rally in White Plaza with a friend, J. Tandler,

before the primaries. While "feminist" is a
term a lot of girls our age shy away from be
cause "people will assume I'm a bitch/I'm a
lesbian/I hate men/I agree with Title IX and
want the football stadium shuttered so we can
have a women's underwater ping-pong team
instead," Jax hasn't been known to shy away
from anything she believes in because of
other people's opinions as long as I've known
her and probably ever. She supported Hillary,
but while we were watching this rally, she ad
mitted she was having doubts. It goes without
saying that this rally featured some Black
Eyed Peas song and balloons. It seemed the
vision this rally was giving of an Obama ad
ministration was one where everyone was
happy and trees sprouted gumdrops and the
whole country would spontaneously break
into "Kumbaya." What kind of pervert would

vote against that? Who doesn't want Black
Eyed Peas songs and balloons for four years?
Well, of course, that's not exactly what
happened. Some people are happy then
again, some people will complain about the
sky being blue if you give them the chance
and I still have to buy my gumdrops. You
can't always get what you want, as the Stones
tells us.

Truth is that the cards were already dealt.
All the conflicts this administration has faced
were long-standing. The Republican party
was never going to be on board that's what
an opposition party is. Not even the Black
Eyed Peas can change that.
And I was not going to spend all my time
trolling PA so that I knew it like the back of
my hand I was never the type of person
that would have done that. In the choice be
tween loitering around here and trekking a
mile and a half there, I wasn't going to make
it. It wasn't thermodynamically favored. I did
n't have the activation energy.
It's possible that the laws of the universe
would temporarily be suspended, or the laws
of politics, or just the personal law of my own
character. But laws are laws because they sim
ply are unlikely to be broken.
Sometimes, in an act of willful self-delu
sion, we imagine a world of total freedom, and
total unpredictability. Anything can happen,
we suppose. And while it's true that anything
is possible in some formal (read: impractical)
sense, it's also more or less true that the sky
will be blue tomorrow, the Republicans will
oppose the Democrats, I will not leave the
Stanford campus for days and someone will
be complaining about the Axe and Palm.

Show Emily that you're the type of person that
would e-mail her at ehulme@stanford.edu.

Now I am a junior, and
not a fall quarter junior,
but a spring quarter one...
