## TRIUMPH IN ATHENS 
### WILL SEATON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In one of the team's biggest victories of the past sev
eral years, the No. 8 Stanford women's tennis team
upset the No. 1 Baylor Bears 4-2 on Saturday to return
to the semifinals of the NCAA Tournament for the first
time since 2007.
"It was a major win to get our program back on
track, and obviously, we need to follow it up with anoth
er one," said head coach Lele Forood. "This is a team
that has taken us out of the last two championships, and
early both times, so it was very important for us to play
them and beat them."
Stanford is now the lowest seed left in the tourna
ment, despite being the only one-loss team in the na
tion. Remaining with the Cardinal are No. 2 UNC, No. 3
Florida and No. 5 Notre Dame.
Apparently, recent history doesn't mean much to the
Cardinal. Baylor has knocked Stanford out of the
NCAA Tournament each of the past two years. In 2008,

the Bears record
ed a 4-1 victory in
the quarterfinals.
Last year, Baylor
again defeated
Stanford 4-3 in the
round of 16 to
mark Stanford's
worst finish since
1998.
So now the
team that was bur
dened with previ
ous postseason
disappointments is
competing in the
NCAA semifinals
in search of its
record 16th
NCAA champi
onship. Since 2001,
Stanford has won
five national titles,
including a three

year streak from 2004 to 2006. That level of success has
been exemplified at Athens, Ga. this year.
"This is a very comfortable place for us," Forood
said. "We've had a lot of success over the years, and I re
ally embrace going back to Athens. We like the town,
the whole atmosphere and we've had success here, so
that is in everyone's head."
Stanford dominated the same way it has all year, re
lying on its three most consistent performers to come
through for the team. For the 24th time in 25 matches,
Stanford won the doubles point to start off, despite a
strong challenge from Baylor. The third team of sopho
more Veronica Li and junior Carolyn McVeigh breezed
through an 8-3 stomping of their opponents.
Then the Bears bit back.
Baylor's No. 2 team pulled away at the bitter end to
record a 9-7 victory over Stanford's freshman duo of
Mallory Burdette and Stacey Tan after the two teams
were tied 7-7.
It then came down to the top spot. Junior Hilary
Barte and senior Lindsay Burdette came back from 4-1
down to take the lead at 6-5 before the Bears came back
to force the tiebreaker. The nation's No. 2 duo allowed
Baylor only three points in the tiebreaker, as the Card
won the match and claimed the doubles point.
With its usual 1-0 lead, Stanford turned to the singles
matches. The team kept up the early momentum by
jumping out to a 3-0 lead thanks to the play of two very
familiar names. Pac-10 Freshman of the Year and ITA
Rookie of the Year Mallory Burdette ranked 33rd
overall came off the court first after beating No. 55
Taylor Ormond. After falling behind a break 4-2, Mal
lory rallied off 10 straight games to get a second-set
bagel and the team's first singles point.
The next player off the court was Li, owner of a
straight-set 6-3, 6-4 victory over Baylor's Karolina Fil-
