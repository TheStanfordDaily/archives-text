## Card returns with Wildcat roadkill Stanford wins last series on the road 
### DANIEL BOHM SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford baseball team (30-21,
13-11 Pac-10) likely secured a postsea
son berth this weekend, taking two out
of three from Arizona (32-20,11-13) in
its last road games of the season.
The Cardinal got solid pitching per
formances from sophomore lefty Brett
Mooneyham on Friday and freshman
Dean McArdle on Sunday in its two
wins.

The Cardinal had a chance to win
Saturday too, but the bullpen blew a late
lead as the Wildcats prevailed, 9-8.
On Friday, Mooneyham (3-5) scat
tered eight hits over 7.2 innings to allow
just one run in the Cardinal's 3-1 victory.

Junior Alex Pracher pitched the last 1.1
innings for his fourth save.
Offensively, junior second baseman
Colin Walsh led the charge for Stanford,
knocking in all three runs. In the top of
the fourth, Walsh hit an opposite-field
home run to give the Cardinal a 2-1 lead.
An inning later, Walsh added an RBI
double, capping the Cardinal scoring.
On Saturday, the Cardinal blew the
lead twice, at 5-2 and 8-7, to take the loss.
Arizona sophomore outfielder Steve
Selsky hit a two-out, two-RBI double in
the bottom of the eighth off freshman
Mark Appel to give the Wildcats the lead
for good. Appel had come on to relieve
sophomore Brian Busick (5-2), who
took the eventual loss after going 3.2 in
nings and allowing three runs. Sopho
more Jordan Pries started on the
mound.

The loss spoiled a good hitting day for
freshman outfielder and first baseman
Stephen Piscotty, who went 5-5 with
three RBIs. Junior catcher Ben Clowe,
who is hitting .350 in limited playing
time this season, had three hits, includ

ing a home run and a double, in his first
start in nearly two weeks. Clowe started
behind the plate on both Saturday and
Sunday in place of junior Zach Jones,
who has been sputtering in the lineup in
recent games.
On Sunday, Clowe was in the leadoff
spot for Stanford's 8-4 victory. It is un
clear if Stanford's regular leadoff hitter,
freshman outfielder Tyler Gaffney, was

GAME NOTES: In its last series on the road, the
Stanford baseball team (30-21, 13-11) took
two of three games from Arizona (32-20, 11 -
13) to almost guarantee a postseason run. Car
dinal pitchers Sophomore Brett Mooneyham
and Freshman Dean McArdle gave strong per
formances to secure the series win. The Card
has four games left in the season, with their last
series at home against No. 3 Arizona State.

injured or just given a day off.
McArdle (5-0), who was making
the second weekend start of his ca
reer, went five innings, allowing just
three runs on six hits. He left after al
lowing a solo home run to Selsky to
lead off the sixth.
Junior Danny Sandbrink went 3.1
solid innings of relief, allowing just a
run before Pracher came on to get the

game's final two outs.
Stanford got off to a big start of
fensively, jumping out to an 8-0 on
three runs in the second inning, one in
the third and four in the fourth.
Junior shortstop Jake Schlander
got the Cardinal on the board with a
two-RBI triple down the right field
line with one out in the second. Sch
lander had three hits and scored a
pair of runs in the win.
Freshman third baseman Kenny
Diekroeger also had three hits, in
cluding a two-RBI single in the four
run fourth in the win. Unfortunately
for Diekroeger, his 23-game hit

streak was snapped in Saturday's loss.
Even with that hitless game,
Diekroeger is still leading Cardinal
hitters with a .366 average.
Stanford now has four games re
maining on the season, a single game
versus UC-Davis on Tuesday and a
three game series at home against No.
3 Arizona State to close out the regu
lar season. Although the Cardinal no
longer has a chance to catch the Sun
Devils and win the Pac-10 Confer
ence, a strong showing next weekend
could greatly increase Stanford's
chances of hosting a regional.
