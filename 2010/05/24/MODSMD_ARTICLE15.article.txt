## Card returns with Wildcat roadkill Stanford wins last series on the road 
### DANIEL BOHM SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford baseball team (30-21,
13-11 Pac-10) likely secured a postsea
son berth this weekend, taking two out
of three from Arizona (32-20,11-13) in
its last road games of the season.
The Cardinal got solid pitching per
formances from sophomore lefty Brett
Mooneyham on Friday and freshman
Dean McArdle on Sunday in its two
wins.

The Cardinal had a chance to win
Saturday too, but the bullpen blew a late
lead as the Wildcats prevailed, 9-8.
On Friday, Mooneyham (3-5) scat
tered eight hits over 7.2 innings to allow
just one run in the Cardinal's 3-1 victory.

Junior Alex Pracher pitched the last 1.1
innings for his fourth save.
Offensively, junior second baseman
Colin Walsh led the charge for Stanford,
knocking in all three runs. In the top of
the fourth, Walsh hit an opposite-field
home run to give the Cardinal a 2-1 lead.
An inning later, Walsh added an RBI
double, capping the Cardinal scoring.
On Saturday, the Cardinal blew the
lead twice, at 5-2 and 8-7, to take the loss.
Arizona sophomore outfielder Steve
Selsky hit a two-out, two-RBI double in
the bottom of the eighth off freshman
Mark Appel to give the Wildcats the lead
for good. Appel had come on to relieve
sophomore Brian Busick (5-2), who
took the eventual loss after going 3.2 in
nings and allowing three runs. Sopho
more Jordan Pries started on the
mound.

The loss spoiled a good hitting day for
freshman outfielder and first baseman
Stephen Piscotty, who went 5-5 with
three RBIs. Junior catcher Ben Clowe,
who is hitting .350 in limited playing
time this season, had three hits, includ

ing a home run and a double, in his first
start in nearly two weeks. Clowe started
behind the plate on both Saturday and
Sunday in place of junior Zach Jones,
who has been sputtering in the lineup in
recent games.
On Sunday, Clowe was in the leadoff
spot for Stanford's 8-4 victory. It is un
clear if Stanford's regular leadoff hitter,
freshman outfielder Tyler Gaffney, was
