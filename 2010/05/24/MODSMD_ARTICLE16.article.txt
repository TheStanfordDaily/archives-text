## Texas Tech ends title run early 
### KABIR SAWHNEY DESK EDITOR 
In an abrupt and somewhat unexpected way, the Stanford
Softball team was eliminated from the 64-team NCAA Tourna
ment on Saturday after back-to-back losses to Hawaii and Texas
Tech.
The Cardinal finishes the season with an overall record of 37-
19, which includes its 1-2 mark in the NCAA Tournament and a
conference record of 8-13, good for a tie for sixth place in the Pac
-10.
Stanford's losses were also surprising given that the Cardinal
had home-field advantage. Though Hawaii was the only seeded
team in the Stanford Regional, earning the tournament's final
seed at No. 16, the Cardinal was ranked higher than the Rainbow
Wahine in both major national polls.Those two factors combined
to make Stanford the favorite to win the regional and advance to
one of next weekend's Super Regionals.
However, signs of trouble emerged in the Card's first game of
the weekend on Friday night against Texas Tech. Stanford was
heavily favored to beat the Red Raiders, but was only able to eke
out a close 5-4 win.
Stanford's offensive performance was powered by two two
run home runs, one off the bat of senior left fielder Alissa Haber,
and the second from sophomore first baseman Jenna Becerra.
Haber went 1-4 with two RBIs over
all, while Becerra went 2-2 with a
walk.
While the Cardinal offense per
formed adequately, its pitching and
defense left something to be desired.
Junior starting pitcher Ashley Chinn,
who threw the whole game, allowed
four runs on seven hits. She also gave
up four walks while striking out four
batters.
More damaging for Stanford was
its defensive lapses. Sophomore sec
ond baseman Ashley Hansen and
freshman shortstop Jenna Rich both
made critical errors in the game, with
Rich's error leading to a Texas Tech
run.
Stanford's problems continued
on Saturday. It started the day
against Hawaii, which had beaten
the regional's fourth team, UC-
Davis, on Friday afternoon. Under
the format of the regional, the win
ner would move on to Sunday's
game while the loser would play an
elimination game at night.
Though neither its offense nor its
defense had poor performances, nei
ther unit was able to carry the game
for Stanford. It fell to the Rainbow
Wahine by a score of 6-3.
Chinn, starting once again for
Stanford, pitched all seven innings
and gave up 10 hits, taking the loss.
Her pitching appeared to improve as
the game went on she gave up six
runs in the first three innings, but set
tled in and shut down Hawaii for the
next four.
Unfortunately for Stanford, its of
fense continued to show the incon
sistency and lack of clutch hitting
that has plagued it all season. It left
six runners on base in the game, most
of them in the later innings. The Car
dinal especially failed to capitalize
on opportunities in the fifth and sev
enth innings. In the fifth, Stanford
had runners on second and third with
the heart of its order coming to the
plate. However, senior third base
man Shannon Koplitz and Rich both
made easy outs, letting Hawaii es
cape with no damage.
A similar situation arose in the
final innings, with runners on first
and second with one out. However, a
Hansen strikeout and a Koplitz fly
ball ended any chance the Card had
of coming back.

"We just couldn't get that final
timely hit," said Stanford head coach
John Rittman.
Haber and Becerra led the of
fense again, going a combined 5-7
with one RBI. The heart of the order
Koplitz, Rich and senior catcher
Rosey Neill was unable to gener
ate any kind of offense, going a com
bined 0-10.
Stanford's poor performance
continued in its elimination game
against Texas Tech. Despite beating
the Red Raiders just a day before,
the Card was unable to get past them
into a rematch with Hawaii. Stanford
lost 6-3 for the second time in a row
to end its NCAA run.
Chinn had an abysmal perform
ance, pitching for just one inning and
giving up four runs before being
pulled in favor of Rich. For Chinn, fa
tigue began to become a factor, as
she had pitched full games both ear
lier in the day and the night before.
After taking the loss for the game,
she ends the season with an individ
ual record of 12-10. She faced one
hitter in the second, whom she hit
with a pitch, before being removed.
Defensive miscues continued to
haunt the Card as well. Thanks to er
rors by Koplitz and Rich, a third of
Texas Tech's runs were unearned.
Offensive inconsistency also came

to the fore. Despite getting nine hits,
Stanford was held to three runs. Ko
plitz. Rich and Neill continued to
struggle, going 2-11 with an RBI.
In the regional's final game on

Sunday, Hawaii defeated Texas Tech
to move on to the NCAA Super Re
gional next weekend. The Rainbow
Wahine will play a three-game series
with No. 1 Alabama, with the winner

moving on to the Women's College
World Series.

Sophomore first baseman Jenna Becerra had a two-run home run in Stanford's Friday win against Texas Tech, 5-4. A day later,
however, the Card offense wasn't able to keep up with the Red Raiders, and Stanford was knocked out of the NCAA tournament.
