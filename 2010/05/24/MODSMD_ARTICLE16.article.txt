## Texas Tech ends title run early 
### KABIR SAWHNEY DESK EDITOR 
In an abrupt and somewhat unexpected way, the Stanford
Softball team was eliminated from the 64-team NCAA Tourna
ment on Saturday after back-to-back losses to Hawaii and Texas
Tech.
The Cardinal finishes the season with an overall record of 37-
19, which includes its 1-2 mark in the NCAA Tournament and a
conference record of 8-13, good for a tie for sixth place in the Pac
-10.
Stanford's losses were also surprising given that the Cardinal
had home-field advantage. Though Hawaii was the only seeded
team in the Stanford Regional, earning the tournament's final
seed at No. 16, the Cardinal was ranked higher than the Rainbow
Wahine in both major national polls.Those two factors combined
to make Stanford the favorite to win the regional and advance to
one of next weekend's Super Regionals.
However, signs of trouble emerged in the Card's first game of
the weekend on Friday night against Texas Tech. Stanford was
heavily favored to beat the Red Raiders, but was only able to eke
out a close 5-4 win.
Stanford's offensive performance was powered by two two
run home runs, one off the bat of senior left fielder Alissa Haber,
and the second from sophomore first baseman Jenna Becerra.
