# Stanford's memory lane

### Daniel Bohm 
This may or may not be my
last column for The Daily. I
may be writing one next
week for the Dead Week
issue, and I am co-terming
next year, so maybe I will write then,
but just in case, I'm going to write this
pseudo-farewell column recapping
my favorite sports moments at Stan
ford.
I'll start with my freshman year.
The football season was entirely for
gettable (1-11, with he-who-should
not-be-named as our coach before
Jim Harbaugh took over), so I'll start
with the basketball season. Back
then, the Sixth Man Club was actual
ly respectable, and my friends and I
would camp outside Maples Pavilion
for some of the big games.
UCLA was ranked No. 2 in the
country when it came to visit, so
about 10 of us from Larkin camped
out. The game was packed two
people standing to a row in the stu
dent section but Stanford was get
ting blown out in the first half. Then
Kenny Brown hit a three-pointer to
pull Stanford within 12 at halftime.
Later, Anthony Goods and Lawrence
Hill would put on a three-point dis
play to lead the Cardinal to victory,
ending with everyone storming the
court.
I'm no Stanford basketball schol
ar, but that was probably the most ex
citing home win since 2004, when
Stanford remained undefeated by
beating Arizona on Nick Robinson's
running three-pointer at the buzzer.
Then there was my sophomore
year. The football season saw an im
provement (4-8), but by no means did
I expect Stanford to beat USC.
Nonetheless, I road-tripped to the
game with some friends, and the rest
is history. Four second-half intercep
tions by John David Booty, Tavita
Pritchard to Mark Bradford and it
was sheer euphoria. A Big Game vic
tory a few weeks later topped it all
off.
Then there was the men's basket
ball NCAA Tournament. Second
round, Stanford versus Marquette,
Brook Lopez at the overtime buzzer.
If you don't know what I'm referring
to, You Tube it.
Later my sophomore year, Stan
ford baseball hosted No. 1 Arizona
State and its completely crazy head
coach Pat Murphy. Stanford took two
of three, including a trouncing on Sat
urday, when Murphy decided to en
gage with the crowd. It was that week
end that Stanford announced itself
on the national stage as a team that
could make the College World Series.
Lo and behold, Stanford made it
to the College World Series that year,
and I went. There is probably no bet
ter sporting event than the College
World Series. Great tailgating, nice
people, wonderful nightlife and
baseball. Stanford played the first
game of the series and score d 11 runs
in the top of the ninth to beat Florida
State 16-5.
The Cardinal didn't win the Col
lege World Series, but the experience
was amazing.
Then there was this football sea
son. I could probably put five games
on this list because this year was a
great success, but the two victories
that come to mind are the win over
Oregon and the trouncing of USC at
the Coliseum.
The packed stadium wasn't ex
pecting victory over Oregon. The
USC victory, on the other hand, was
epic. Watching those lukewarm Tro
jan fans clear out of the stadium like
the building was on fire early in the
fourth quarter was great. The only
thing better might have been the
looks on the fans' faces two years ear
lier when it was No. 1 USC losing at
home to lowly Stanford.
I'm probably missing a few things
here and there. I was out of town, but
I'm sure the men's volleyball nation
al title game a few weeks ago was ex
tremely exciting, for example. I defi
nitely missed some huge goals, walk
off homers and more, but for me
these moments were the cream of the
crop.
It's been a fun ride, and hopefully
the Stanford teams that are still play
ing this spring will provide me with
some more lasting memories.

ford sports games, if you haven't heard.
