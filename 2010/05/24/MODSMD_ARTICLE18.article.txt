# Bruins bounce Card out of NCAA Title race
## Men's tennis finishes season with 2-4 loss 
### JACK DUANE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford men's tennis team's sea
son is over after falling to UCLA 4-2 on
Friday evening in the round of 16 at the
NCAA Championships in Athens, Ga.
"This was just another great Stanford-
UCLA match," Stanford head coach John
Whitlinger told GoStanford.com. "We've
beaten them and had some luck at times,
and they've been in the same situation.
"I'm extremely proud of our guys, but
UCLA is a great team, and they are
healthy at the right time," he added.
UCLA (17-6, 4-2 Pac-10) secured a
spot in the quarterfinals for the 22nd con
secutive year, but then fell to top-seeded
Virginia 4-2 on Sunday.
In Friday's match, UCLA clinched the
doubles point to take a 1-0 lead, and then
followed up with three singles-match vic
tories to earn the victory.
Stanford's doubles teams had been vir
tually unbeatable all year, winning 23 of
26 doubles points before heading to
Georgia.
Stanford's top team of sophomores
Bradley Klahn and Ryan Thacher cruised
to an 8-3 victory over UCLA's Amit Inbar
and Nick Meister. Klahn and Thacher de
feated UCLA's best doubles team for the
first time in three tries this season.

But the Cardinal failed to capitalize on
the quick victory and squandered away
the doubles point.
Senior Richard Wire and junior Alex

Clayton fell to UCLA's second team of
Haythem Abid and Matt Brooklyn, 8-6.
All heads turned to the third court,
where Stanford's freshman duo of Matt
Kandath and Denis Lin allowed Alex
Brigham and Holden Seguso to fight back
from a 3-0 deficit and force a tiebreaker.
The Bruins' Brigham and Seguso even
tually pulled out a 7-5 victory in the
tiebreaker to clinch the doubles point and
give UCLA a 1-0 lead.
From there, the Bruins controlled the
early singles play with first-set victories on
three of the six courts.
However, a rainstorm forced a brief
delay and a move to the inside courts. The
break seemed to halt UCLA's momentum
and give the Cardinal a chance to catch its
collective breath.
"It gave us sort of a timeout, which I
thought helped a little," Whitlinger said of
the rain delay. "We just got down early in
those matches."
UCLA's No. 117 Inbar took down Lin
in straight sets, 6-3, 6-2, shortly after the
move inside to give UCLA a 2-0 lead.
Stanford's top player No. 13 Klahn
countered with his own two-set victory
over UCLA's Meister, 6-4,6-2.
In addition to playing in the doubles
tournament with Thacher, Klahn will be
playing in the NCAA singles draw as a
No. 9-16 seed.
Seguso gave the Bruins a commanding
3-1 lead with a 6-3,6-3 victory over Wire in
what proved to be Wire's final collegiate
match.
It seemed like UCLA might cruise to
an easy victory, but the fourth and final
point proved to be elusive for the Bruins,
keeping Stanford in the match.
No. 84 Thacher gave Stanford another
point with a hard-fought three-set victory
over No. 51 Abid on the second court, 7-6

(2), 4-6,6-3.
With junior Greg Hirshman leading
Maxime Tabatroung on the sixth court in
the third set, the team match and a spot in
the quarterfinals came down to the third
set between Stanford's Clayton and
UCLA's No. 58 Matt Brooklyn.
The scenario was reminiscent of Stan
ford's regular season match at UCLA on
April 3, when the Card's Clayton fought
off multiple match points to pull out a
third-set victory over Inbar to clinch the
match and catapult Stanford on a seven
match winning streak.
In that match, UCLA was missing
starters Abid and Seguso. Their presence
in the lineup this time around proved to
be the difference.
Clayton forced a third set with a victo
ry in a second-set tiebreaker.
The junior had multiple break point
opportunities in the third set, but failed to
capitalize. Clayton eventually fell 6-2,6-7
(5), 6-3.
It is hard to classify Stanford's season
as a disappointment. The team shared the
Pac-10 title with USC and made it to the
round of 16 in the NCAA Championships.
Sophomores Klahn and Thacher es
tablished themselves as one of the top
doubles teams in the country, and fresh
men Kandath and Lin gave Stanford fans
a reason to believe that the future will be
very bright.
However, for a program that has won
17 national titles, anything less than a
championship is somewhat of a disap
pointment.
The Cardinal will return ah but one
starter for next year and should once
again be a contender for a national title.
