## Admission sees yield rate increase Class of 2014 has 72 percent acceptance rate 
### ELIZABETH ROSEN STAFF WRITER 
Despite initial predictions by the Of
fice of Undergraduate Admission of a
decreased yield rate for the Class of
2014, a record-high 72 percent of 2,300
admitted students accepted their offers
of admission this year.
"It's a very respectable yield," said
Richard Shaw, dean of admission. "It's
probably one of the highest yields in the
country."
According to a survey by The New
York Times, Harvard had a yield of 76
percent, Dartmouth reported 55 per
cent, the University of Pennsylvania
held steady with a yield of 63 percent
and Cornell received acceptances from
49 percent of admits.
Stanford's 72-percent yield repre
sents approximately a one percent in
crease since last year. Shaw said the of
fice had predicted some wait list activi
ty, but that the better-than-expected
yield left room for only 26 students from
the 998-person list.
"We are an incredible place," Shaw
said. "Our greatest challenge is convinc
ing students that this has to be among
their top choices. We're competing with
a number of other excellent options."
According to Shaw, "an immense
amount of time and effort" is put into
the selection process, resulting in ap
pealing Admit Weekend programs dur
ing the response period.
Shaw said a positive impact on this
year's yield came from Stanford's subsi
dization of travel costs for students from
low-income families during Admit
Weekend.
He cited a number of other factors
that contributed to the increase in ac
cepted offers of admission, including
enhanced outreach to all 50 states and
strong financial aid.
"We weren't sure what to expect,
given the country's current economic is
sues," Shaw said. "I thought the yield
would be lower, because of the econo
my. But we also have some of the best fi
nancial aid in the country, and some stu
dents decide based on that."
Financial aid policies and amounts
for next year were finalized in February
and will not be affected by the high
er yield.
Even families who might appear
to be able to pay may be suffering a
number of challenges in an economy
where assets have decreased across
the board, Shaw said. Families with a
total income of less than $lOO,OOO a
year will continue to be responsible
for no more than about $12,000, and
families making less than $60,000

have zero expected parental contri
bution.
Student Housing's shift of 40 un
dergraduate students into the previ
ously graduate-only Rains apart
ment buildings raised the question
of whether or not the increased yield
would further impact on-campus
housing. Shaw said close work with
orientation planners and Housing
has resulted in having both housing
assignments and class sizes on target.
"We're quite pleased," Shaw said.
"We'll land this baby at 1,675."
