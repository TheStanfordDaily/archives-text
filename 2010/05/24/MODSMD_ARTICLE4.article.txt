# Draw results released early
## Row Houses draw Tier One applicants 
### LAUREN WILSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Students rushed to housing front desks on
Friday to view the Draw results for the 2010-
2011 school year, which were posted a day early.
This marks the second year of the new three
tiered Housing Master Plan.
The new system sought to "uncrowd" the res
idences and return spaces back to the numbers
they were designed to hold triples were re
verted to doubles and doubles reverted to sin

Whitney also noted the increase in populari

tier two.
"Toyon and Branner were also popular again

The new system assigned 4,005 students, or
98 percent of applicants, up approximately 1.9
percent from last year. Despite an increase in

housing applications, there has been a decrease
in the number of students with guaranteed hous

this year the lowest since 2006.
"One in three students received their first
choice in the Draw this year," Whitney said.
"This is up from last year. Of the 173 total choic

all students received one of their first 10 choic

Whitney said Housing is working toward a
