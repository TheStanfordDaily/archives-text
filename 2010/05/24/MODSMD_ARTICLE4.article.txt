# Draw results released early
## Row Houses draw Tier One applicants 
### LAUREN WILSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Students rushed to housing front desks on
Friday to view the Draw results for the 2010-
2011 school year, which were posted a day early.
This marks the second year of the new three
tiered Housing Master Plan.
The new system sought to "uncrowd" the res
idences and return spaces back to the numbers
they were designed to hold triples were re
verted to doubles and doubles reverted to sin
gles. Student Housing also expanded students'

ability to rank all residences by allowing them to
rank the type of room within each residence.
"The statistics aren't in yet, since the Draw
has just been completed," wrote Rodger Whit
ney, executive director of Housing, in an e-mail
to The Daily on Sunday. "Early indications are
that this new level of selection priority is allow
ing students to rank their housing choices based
more on where they would really like to live
than on where they think they will have a good
chance of getting a premier assignment in the in
house draw."
Cutoff numbers were posted to Housing's

website as of Sunday.
Whitney commented on the impact the rank
ing change has had on the popularity of houses.
As usual, the Row was extremely popular, and
most houses were filled with tier one applicants.
Whitney also noted the increase in populari
ty for co-ops. Most filled with either tier one or
tier two.
"Toyon and Branner were also popular again
this year," Whitney said.
The new system assigned 4,005 students, or
98 percent of applicants, up approximately 1.9
percent from last year. Despite an increase in

housing applications, there has been a decrease
in the number of students with guaranteed hous
ing who were not assigned, from 89 in 2009 to 48
this year the lowest since 2006.
"One in three students received their first
choice in the Draw this year," Whitney said.
"This is up from last year. Of the 173 total choic
es which each person could rank, 52 percent of
all students received one of their first 10 choic
es."
Whitney said Housing is working toward a
system that would allow students to
select their specific rooms online in
real time.
"We do not yet have the technical
system in place to implement this
plan, but are working toward ithe
said. "With this 'self-select model,'
students will be assigned a gate time
based on their draw number ... and
will select from available assignments
during that time slot. This will give
residents even more control, and
eliminate the need to rank housing
choices online."
"I'm very pleased with the Draw
results," said Calvin Fernandez 'l3. "I
thought the Draw was very fair, and I
think that it turned out in everybody's
best interest."
"Forming draw groups caused a lot
of drama within our dorm," said fellow
draw group member Olivia Isaac 'l3.
"I remember wishing it was random,
because I hated choosing between all
my friends. But now that it's all re

solved, I'm really happy with the re
sult, but that could be due to the fact
that I got my first-choice housing."
Still, she added, "it would have
been nice if we could just use the sort
ing hat from Harry Potter and avoid all
this."
For others, the Draw situation did
not end well.
"My draw number was 1,817, so I
feel like I kind of got screwed," said Eli
Hart 'l3. "I talk to people who drew
1,100 or lower and got their first
choice, whereas I got my 15th choice
for housing. So most of my friends are
living in Toy on or Branner, and I was
put over in Lagunita, which I'm sure is
still a nice place to live, but it's not the
location I wanted."
Others had a fairytale Draw story
come true,
"We were ecstatic," said Sherry Ho
*ll. Ho used tier one and drew num
ber 11, which secured her and her
draw group spots in Xanadu next year.
"We were all really nervous about the
Draw in the weeks leading up, but we
just got lucky."
