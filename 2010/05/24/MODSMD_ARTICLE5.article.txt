### SIDDARTH CIDAMBI 
Saturday Night Live (SNL) comedian
Seth Meyers opened his stand-up act on
Friday evening by poking fun at the
Hewlett lecture hall, joking that the room
was poorly suited for comedy because the
audience could be tempted to browse the
large periodic table of elements posted
high up on the wall if they got bored with
his act.

Ticket-holders and hopefuls on the
stand-by list lined up outside Hewlett an
hour before the show started, eagerly
awaiting Meyers' performance.The come
dian and longtime actor's introduction
and subsequent entry drew tremendous
applause.
The Stanford Speakers Bureau, which
also sponsored other prominent comedi
ans' visits to campus, including Sarah Sil
verman, Seth McFarlane and BJ Novak,

organized Meyers' performance.
The event was co-sponsored by Stan
ford's own Robber Barons comedy
troupe, which opened the act with three
sketches that drew laughs from the audi
ence.
Speakers Bureau director Peter Tu 'lO
said he was very satisfied with the collabo
ration.

Saturday Night Live comedian Seth Meyers performed in Hewlett on Friday night to a packed audience. His jokes ranged from
politics to the size of the venue. To graduating seniors he joked, "sorry about the world." The Robber Barons troupe also performed.
"In each of our events, we like to
reach out to and involve different
parts of the Stanford community," Tu
said. "This time, it was the Robber
Barons, and we thought their open
ing act prepped Seth's stand-up per
fectly."
Meyers, who has performed at
other colleges, including Northeast
ern and his alma matter, Northwest
ern, adapted his act for a predomi
nantly undergraduate audience.
He started off by consoling the
seniors in the room, saying, "Sorry
about the world."
His advice for college students
consisted of disparaging the promi
nent use of the futon due to its dis
comfort and unromantic nature, as
well as advocating against the use of
Axe body spray, which he deemed
"the futon of scent."
As the show progressed, Meyers
moved to politics, commenting on
the sex scandal involving former
New York governor Eliot Spitzer. He
also discussed his experience at SNL,

touching on the infamous Ashlee
Simpson episode from 2004, which
involved the singer being caught lip
syncing rather than singing.
Meyers also spoke about his expe
rience performing on SNL with
Sarah Palin, saying he thought the
former Alaskan governor was amaz
ing due to her sense of humor, but
wouldn't want her to be president,
vice president or a Department of
Motor Vehicles worker.
Bantering with the audience, he
asked one audience member who
said she had gone abroad to Austria
what she studied. In response to her
answer "tourism" Meyers jok
ingly asked whether or not she knew
the difference between studying
abroad and merely traveling.
Sam Clanon 'l3, a member of
Robber Barons, said the Meyers act
worked well.
"He did an excellent job of tailor
ing his material to and interacting
with the audience, and his observa
tional wit was just as sharp as some of
the guys who are more associated
with that type of comedy," Clanon
said.
