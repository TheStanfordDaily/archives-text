### SIDDARTH CIDAMBI 
Saturday Night Live (SNL) comedian
Seth Meyers opened his stand-up act on
Friday evening by poking fun at the
Hewlett lecture hall, joking that the room
was poorly suited for comedy because the
audience could be tempted to browse the
large periodic table of elements posted
high up on the wall if they got bored with
his act.

Ticket-holders and hopefuls on the
stand-by list lined up outside Hewlett an
hour before the show started, eagerly
awaiting Meyers' performance.The come
dian and longtime actor's introduction
and subsequent entry drew tremendous
applause.
The Stanford Speakers Bureau, which
also sponsored other prominent comedi
ans' visits to campus, including Sarah Sil
verman, Seth McFarlane and BJ Novak,

organized Meyers' performance.
The event was co-sponsored by Stan
ford's own Robber Barons comedy
troupe, which opened the act with three
sketches that drew laughs from the audi
ence.
Speakers Bureau director Peter Tu 'lO
said he was very satisfied with the collabo
ration.
