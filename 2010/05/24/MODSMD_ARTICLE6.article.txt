## Panel discusses action in North Korean crisis Speakers share personal stories, explore humanitarian crisis 
### DEVIN BANERJEE SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
For nine months, Guang-il Jung was confined to an
underground cell, beaten with a wooden club until his
teeth fell out, handcuffed to an iron bar to prevent him
from sleeping, hung upside down and denied a toilet and
clean clothes.
"Even if I screamed, nobody heard," he told The
Daily through a translator on Saturday. Jung's was just
one of many tales of human rights abuses discussed at a
conference held over the weekend at Stanford on "The
North Korean Crisis: Human Stories & Taking Action."
Jung was joined by David Hawk, former executive
director of Amnesty International USA, Dan Chung,
communications director of Chicago-based NGO
Crossing Borders, and Sharon Perry, a senior researcher
at Stanford School of Medicine's Division of Infectious
Diseases.
Jung, 47, relayed his harrowing story as a political
prisoner in North Korea. He was arrested in his home in
July 1999 and sent to the underground quarters of the
city's security agency, where he was charged with spying
likely because he had several business contacts in
South Korea, he said. For nine months, Jung denied the
charges, even as investigators told him he wouldn't get
out alive if he didn't confess.
"Later, I became too weak," he said. "Just to survive,
I had to make a false confession." By then, Jung's weight
of 165 pounds had dropped by half.
In April 2000, Jung was sent to the infamous Yodok
concentration camp, where he spent
the next three years performing hard
labor — and watching an estimated
200 of 400 prisoners die of starva
tion. Several prisoners attempted to
escape, Jung said, but they were ei
ther impaled by spears dug into the
ground or dragged back to the camp
by guard dogs and then publicly exe
cuted as a warning to others.
In April 2003, Jung was deemed
acceptable for release if he swore not
to tell anyone about the camp.
Twelve days later, upon finding his
former house taken away and his
family kicked out of the country,
Jung defected to China. A year later,
he entered South Korea, where he
now directs a Seoul-based NGO
called NK Gulag for Democracy.

The other speakers at Saturday's
conference spoke of the lack of food
security, the state-controlled repres
sion of market-based economics, the
prevalence of human trafficking and
the dire health conditions, including
high incidences of tuberculosis
(TB), that exist in North Korea.
Tliese conditions constitute what
Professor David Straub, who moder
ated the conference, called "one of the
very worst human rights situations in
the world." Straub, the associate direc
tor of Stanford's Korean Studies Pro
gram, accompanied former President
Bill Clinton on his August 2009 trip to
Pyongyang to secure the release of
journalists Laura Ling and Euna Lee
from North Korean captivity.
"I think it was one of the great
scandals of the second half of the
20th century that nothing was effec
tively done in the North Korean hu
manitarian crisis," he said.
Hawk called the current global
response to the crisis only a "re
sponse-to-provocation phase."
"On the ground, in the area of
human rights, nothing much has
changed," he said, noting later that
more NGOs are becoming active in
the crisis, but that their effects are
slow. "The repression grinds on."
A confluence of events that took
place 10 to 15 years ago brought

more attention to the humanitarian
crisis, Straub said. These included
the breakup of the Soviet Union,
which engaged heavily in trade with
North Korea, the global demise of
communism, the rise of Internet
based communication and the move
to full democracy by South Korea.
"The result is we've seen much
more access to the world of North
Korea and information about it,"
Straub said. "We've seen the rise of
many organizations, NGOs, around
the world, and we've seen the devel
opment of global networks of these
organizations."
The regime in North Korea,
Hawk said, may be beginning to lose
its footing for the same reasons.
Three legs normally prop up the
government übiquitous police
surveillance, punishment of coun
terrevolutionary thought and strict
control over outside information
and of those, the control over infor
mation has broken down. Hawk
said.
"As of 2004 and 2005, some
20,000 North Koreans have made it
through China and into South

Korea, and an awful lot of them re
main in contact with their friends,
family and neighbors through their
cell phones," he said. "North Kore
ans are learning that South Korea is
free, democratic, prosperous, even
rich."
Several thousand North Korean
women make it across the border to
China each year but are victims of
human trafficking, Chung said. While
trafficking has usually been done by
kidnapping women or brokering
them between North Korea and buy
ers in China by telling the women
that jobs awaited them, Chung said a
third method is now arising: match
making, or telling North Korean
women that potential husbands
await them across the border.
"It's the same thing, just dressed
up in different wrapping," Chung
said.
Perry, who returned from North
Korea earlier this year after working
with Pyongyang's Ministry of Public
Health to initiate installation of the
country's first diagnostic laboratory
for drug-resistant tuberculosis,
lamented the incidence of TB there.

"Health care indicators in DPRK
[Democratic People's Republic of
Korea, the official name of North
Korea] show that it has fallen out of
the developed world," Perry said.
"TB incidence is similar to that in
sub-Saharan Africa."

Still, Perry said the work being
done by her group and by the many
NGOs involved in the North Korean
humanitarian crisis are steps in the
right direction. Quoting from the
1919 Korean Declaration of Inde
pendence, she told the audience in
Encina Hall's Bechtel Conference
Center, "To begin is to succeed. We
only need to march in the direction
of the light."
Jung, who has traveled the world
speaking about the years of torture
and repression he spent in North
Korea, had a different idea: "Let's
talk about when Kim Jong-il is going
to die."

The conference was organized by
the Stanford Korean Students Asso
ciation.

20,000 North Koreans have made it
through China and into South

Korea, and an awful lot of them re
main in contact with their friends,
family and neighbors through their
cell phones," he said. "North Kore
ans are learning that South Korea is
free, democratic, prosperous, even
rich."
Several thousand North Korean
women make it across the border to
China each year but are victims of
human trafficking, Chung said. While
trafficking has usually been done by
kidnapping women or brokering
them between North Korea and buy
ers in China by telling the women
that jobs awaited them, Chung said a
third method is now arising: match
making, or telling North Korean
women that potential husbands
await them across the border.
"It's the same thing, just dressed
up in different wrapping," Chung
said.
Perry, who returned from North
Korea earlier this year after working
with Pyongyang's Ministry of Public
Health to initiate installation of the
country's first diagnostic laboratory
for drug-resistant tuberculosis,
lamented the incidence of TB there.

"Health care indicators in DPRK
[Democratic People's Republic of
Korea, the official name of North
Korea] show that it has fallen out of
the developed world," Perry said.
"TB incidence is similar to that in
sub-Saharan Africa."

Still, Perry said the work being
done by her group and by the many
NGOs involved in the North Korean
humanitarian crisis are steps in the
right direction. Quoting from the
1919 Korean Declaration of Inde
pendence, she told the audience in
Encina Hall's Bechtel Conference
Center, "To begin is to succeed. We
only need to march in the direction
of the light."
Jung, who has traveled the world
speaking about the years of torture
and repression he spent in North
Korea, had a different idea: "Let's
talk about when Kim Jong-il is going
to die."

The conference was organized by
the Stanford Korean Students Asso
ciation.

Former North Korean political prisoner recounted his story at the panel Saturday. "Just to survive, I had to make a false
confession," he said.The panel explored the issues fueling the humanitarian crisis within the country.
For nine months, Guang-il Jung was confined to an
underground cell, beaten with a wooden club until his
teeth fell out, handcuffed to an iron bar to prevent him
from sleeping, hung upside down and denied a toilet and
clean clothes.
"Even if I screamed, nobody heard," he told The
Daily through a translator on Saturday. Jung's was just
one of many tales of human rights abuses discussed at a
conference held over the weekend at Stanford on "The
North Korean Crisis: Human Stories & Taking Action."
Jung was joined by David Hawk, former executive
director of Amnesty International USA, Dan Chung,
communications director of Chicago-based NGO
Crossing Borders, and Sharon Perry, a senior researcher
at Stanford School of Medicine's Division of Infectious
Diseases.
Jung, 47, relayed his harrowing story as a political
prisoner in North Korea. He was arrested in his home in
July 1999 and sent to the underground quarters of the
city's security agency, where he was charged with spying
likely because he had several business contacts in
South Korea, he said. For nine months, Jung denied the
charges, even as investigators told him he wouldn't get
out alive if he didn't confess.
"Later, I became too weak," he said. "Just to survive,
I had to make a false confession." By then, Jung's weight
of 165 pounds had dropped by half.
In April 2000, Jung was sent to the infamous Yodok
concentration camp, where he spent
the next three years performing hard
labor — and watching an estimated
200 of 400 prisoners die of starva
tion. Several prisoners attempted to
escape, Jung said, but they were ei
ther impaled by spears dug into the
ground or dragged back to the camp
by guard dogs and then publicly exe
cuted as a warning to others.
In April 2003, Jung was deemed
acceptable for release if he swore not
to tell anyone about the camp.
Twelve days later, upon finding his
former house taken away and his
family kicked out of the country,
Jung defected to China. A year later,
he entered South Korea, where he
now directs a Seoul-based NGO
called NK Gulag for Democracy.

The other speakers at Saturday's
conference spoke of the lack of food
security, the state-controlled repres
sion of market-based economics, the
prevalence of human trafficking and
the dire health conditions, including
high incidences of tuberculosis
(TB), that exist in North Korea.
Tliese conditions constitute what
Professor David Straub, who moder
ated the conference, called "one of the
very worst human rights situations in
the world." Straub, the associate direc
tor of Stanford's Korean Studies Pro
gram, accompanied former President
Bill Clinton on his August 2009 trip to
Pyongyang to secure the release of
journalists Laura Ling and Euna Lee
from North Korean captivity.
"I think it was one of the great
scandals of the second half of the
20th century that nothing was effec
tively done in the North Korean hu
manitarian crisis," he said.
Hawk called the current global
response to the crisis only a "re
sponse-to-provocation phase."
"On the ground, in the area of
human rights, nothing much has
changed," he said, noting later that
more NGOs are becoming active in
the crisis, but that their effects are
slow. "The repression grinds on."
A confluence of events that took
place 10 to 15 years ago brought

more attention to the humanitarian
crisis, Straub said. These included
the breakup of the Soviet Union,
which engaged heavily in trade with
North Korea, the global demise of
communism, the rise of Internet
based communication and the move
to full democracy by South Korea.
"The result is we've seen much
more access to the world of North
Korea and information about it,"
Straub said. "We've seen the rise of
many organizations, NGOs, around
the world, and we've seen the devel
opment of global networks of these
organizations."
The regime in North Korea,
Hawk said, may be beginning to lose
its footing for the same reasons.
Three legs normally prop up the
government übiquitous police
surveillance, punishment of coun
terrevolutionary thought and strict
control over outside information
and of those, the control over infor
mation has broken down. Hawk
said.
"As of 2004 and 2005, some
20,000 North Koreans have made it
through China and into South

Korea, and an awful lot of them re
main in contact with their friends,
family and neighbors through their
