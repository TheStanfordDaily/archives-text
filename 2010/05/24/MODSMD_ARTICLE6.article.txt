For nine months, Guang-il Jung was confined to an
underground cell, beaten with a wooden club until his
teeth fell out, handcuffed to an iron bar to prevent him
from sleeping, hung upside down and denied a toilet and
clean clothes.
"Even if I screamed, nobody heard," he told The
Daily through a translator on Saturday. Jung's was just
one of many tales of human rights abuses discussed at a
conference held over the weekend at Stanford on "The
North Korean Crisis: Human Stories & Taking Action."
Jung was joined by David Hawk, former executive
director of Amnesty International USA, Dan Chung,
communications director of Chicago-based NGO
Crossing Borders, and Sharon Perry, a senior researcher
at Stanford School of Medicine's Division of Infectious
Diseases.
Jung, 47, relayed his harrowing story as a political
prisoner in North Korea. He was arrested in his home in
July 1999 and sent to the underground quarters of the
city's security agency, where he was charged with spying
likely because he had several business contacts in
South Korea, he said. For nine months, Jung denied the
charges, even as investigators told him he wouldn't get
out alive if he didn't confess.
"Later, I became too weak," he said. "Just to survive,
I had to make a false confession." By then, Jung's weight
of 165 pounds had dropped by half.
In April 2000, Jung was sent to the infamous Yodok
