Over the last four years, seniors James Do,
Greg Enenstein, Avery Half on and Sam Ju
lian â€” drummer, bassist, guitarist and vo
cals, respectively, for the rock band The Off
beats have become very familiar with
eviction notices.
"We've gotten kicked out of so many practice spaces,"
Julian recalled with a hint of pride.
During freshman year when drummer James Do 'lO
still used an electric drum kit their home base was Ju
nipero. When Do upgraded to the real deal, they moved to
the unventilated basement. Through their sophomore
year, The Offbeats serenaded their less-than-enthusiastic
" neighbors in Toyon Hall. Their brief stint in the sun
, "drenched third-floor quad in Synergy was their favorite,
until neighbor complaints forced them underground, liter
-9 ally, to Synergy's basement.
But the moves worked for them. The Offbeats' four
year history is sprinkled with episodes of brilliance: play
ing "Semi-Charmed Life" at the freshman talent show,
\ facing enthusiastic, if not inebriated, crowds at shows and
recording in a stuffed panda-lined, warehouse garage
(found online, of course). But then there have also been
the lows: the frustration of Stanford-packed schedules,
having to rehearse with earplugs in cramped basements,
angry complaints and chatlist griping from unappreciative
residents.
With graduation in sight, the veteran members of Die
Offbeats have come to accept that this just comes with the
territory when you perform at Stanford.
Each year, inspired students take up guitars and micro
phones to form bands on campus. Some of these bands will
never make it past dorm room jam sessions, while others
will be cut short when members go abroad or graduate. A
rare few will push the dream to its fullest, pursuing record
