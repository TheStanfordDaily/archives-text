## Card Rock 
### MARISA LANDICHO DESK EDITOR 
Over the last four years, seniors James Do,
Greg Enenstein, Avery Half on and Sam Ju
lian — drummer, bassist, guitarist and vo
cals, respectively, for the rock band The Off
beats have become very familiar with
eviction notices.
"We've gotten kicked out of so many practice spaces,"
Julian recalled with a hint of pride.
During freshman year when drummer James Do 'lO
still used an electric drum kit their home base was Ju
nipero. When Do upgraded to the real deal, they moved to
the unventilated basement. Through their sophomore
year, The Offbeats serenaded their less-than-enthusiastic
" neighbors in Toyon Hall. Their brief stint in the sun
, "drenched third-floor quad in Synergy was their favorite,
until neighbor complaints forced them underground, liter
-9 ally, to Synergy's basement.
But the moves worked for them. The Offbeats' four
year history is sprinkled with episodes of brilliance: play
ing "Semi-Charmed Life" at the freshman talent show,
\ facing enthusiastic, if not inebriated, crowds at shows and
recording in a stuffed panda-lined, warehouse garage
(found online, of course). But then there have also been
the lows: the frustration of Stanford-packed schedules,
having to rehearse with earplugs in cramped basements,
angry complaints and chatlist griping from unappreciative
residents.
With graduation in sight, the veteran members of Die
Offbeats have come to accept that this just comes with the
territory when you perform at Stanford.
Each year, inspired students take up guitars and micro
phones to form bands on campus. Some of these bands will
never make it past dorm room jam sessions, while others
will be cut short when members go abroad or graduate. A
rare few will push the dream to its fullest, pursuing record

deals and world tours. In any given
year, between three and six bands will
regularly perform at frat parties, stu
dent events and campus gatherings,
creating the closest thing to a music
scene at Stanford.
Breaking into the frat party circuit,
however, takes more than just ambi
tion. The bands with longevity, such as
the two four-year rock bands, The Off
beats and Ampersand, have practiced
on average once a week, with increas
es during gigging season.
"When you're running your band,
you have to be your own policeman in
terms of coming to practices," Julian
said. "Not everyone is as determined
to do it... You have to keep it fun."

Making the band
In many respects, starting a band at
Stanford is similar to what you would
expect anywhere else — finding
members, honing a unique sound,
scheduling time to practice — but the
bubble brings its own challenges to
the teenage pipe dream.
"Why would you spend time in a
band, which really Stanford doesn't
give you much of an advantage for
doing, when you can do the CS de
partment and make $100,000 upon
graduation?" said David Kettler '11,
the bassist and lone junior in the self
described "indie erotica slash socially
conscious disco" band, The Sea Peo
ple.
"So much of starting a band is
making an investment that you know
isn't going to be returned for five plus
years," Kettler added. "Every band
has to go through this phase where
they're playing most gigs for free,
mostly playing to their friends."
The investment is both financial
and personal.
No one may be better equipped
than The Sea People, started this year
by four freshmen and junior Kettler,
to understand the enormity of the
commitment. Jumping into a rigorous
practice schedule — eight hours of
practice a week, rehearsing Monday
and Wednesday and weekends —
and an equally demanding show cal
endar, The Sea People consider their
band the equivalent of a five-unit
class. One that requires field trips,
heavy lifting and disappearing acts on
friends.
They are the type of band that is

excited and slightly incredulous at the
prospect of having a week and a half
off from practicing. Following a mel
low and chilly set outside of Sigma Nu
on a Wednesday night, the band mem
bers looked ready to be college stu
dents again.
"We have nine days off. Nine
days," Kettler said, only half sarcasti
cally. "It's actually really funny how
much I've been looking forward to
this weekend."
The Sea People have played three
to four shows a week spring quarter,
anything from Late Nite to frat par
ties to off-campus gigs. In the past
month alone, the band has represent
ed Stanford at the Bay Area Battle of
the Bands, placing third, opened for
Yeasayer to the unconventional back
drop of the Tresidder Oak Room and
lent their brand of funk to a stage at
Sunsplash.
Ampersand,The Offbeats, Finding
Jupiter and The Sea People agreed
that after the first few shows, the of
fers for other gigs came readily. The
real challenge was in booking that
first show.
"From zero gigs to one gig is defi
nitely the hardest," said Ampersand's
Andrew Hung TO, likening the
process to beginning a start-up. "But I
think there are a lot of good opportu
nities on campus that are low pressure
and low barrier to entry."
Being tenacious at blind e-mails
helps. So does being well-connected.
"It gets easier as you get older, and
you know people who are social man
agers and in groups," said Offbeats
guitarist Avery Half on '10. "People
are looking for bands a lot."
Bands may receive some publicity
through the Stanford Soundtrack,
which the Student Organizing Com
mittee for the Arts (SOCA) compiles
every spring. SOCA selects tracks
that represent the Stanford music
community and then distributes 3,000
free copies of the Soundtrack to stu
dents at the festival An Art Affair.
"I think [the Soundtrack is] really
to bring more awareness and put on a
showcase of the vibrant music com
munity that people don't hear from
usually," said senior Nick Trutanic,
music director of SOCA and execu
tive producer of the Soundtrack.
But the Soundtrack, only available
in hard copy and via iTunes U, is more
exhibition than marketing tool. For

bands looking to woo record labels,
EPs and albums are a must.
That's where Stanford's Center for
Computer Research in Music and
Acoustics (CCRMA, pronounced
"karma") comes in. A multi-discipli
nary facility for computer-based tech
nology research, CCRMA, the "salva
tion of Stanford's musical soul," ac
cording to Sea People's Kettler, also
offers classes in audio recording and
technology. Not to mention its cut
ting-edge recording studio.
Recording time is free, and bands
like Ampersand, Finding Jupiter, The
Sea People and many others on the
Stanford Soundtrack have graced the
studio's halls.
The catch? You have to have taken

Music 192A and 1928, required for
the music major's Music, Science &
Technology specialization and often
booked solid, to have access. Students
may enroll in a one to two unit contin
uing class after the core, where people
end up working on their own person
al projects. Students are limited to
eight hours in the studio a week.
"The studio is only for classroom
use," said CCRMA audio engineer
Jay Kadis, who has taught the record
ing classes for over a decade. Al
though Kadis says some graduate stu
dents also use the studio, it is typically
only available to students who are en
rolled in the class.

Rocking Stanford
Outside of recordings, however,
Stanford has been a less helpful incu
bator for growing bands. Rehearsal
space and venues, such as Dinkelspiel
Auditorium and Frost Amphitheater,
are closed to student bands, and stu
dents have to pay to use practice
rooms in Braun Music Hall, which are
too small to fit more than one person
and are geared toward jazz and classi
cal music.
"The school pretty much con
demns rock," said Sea People drum
mer Dan Bardenstein 'l3. "If you use
the practice set and you're in a room
and you're playing rock music with
whatever group, people will come by
and get mad at you."
The Sea People are lucky key
boardist Beachy's parents work at the
Medical Center, and they practice at
his home but other bands must re
sort to straight-up begging for prac
tice space. Off campus, some bands
have tried renting out storage space.
"Honestly, Stanford doesn't really
have space available to groups," said
Dean Schaffer 'lO, who does lead gui
tar and vocals for year-old rock band,
Finding Jupiter. The band has rotated
through the band shack, Terra and
French House, using their residences
and connections to hunt down prac
tice space.

Storage of the instruments and
equipment presents another prob
lem. When you're trying to shove
amps in an already-cluttered one
room double, space becomes a valu
able commodity.
"I'm really good at Tetris," said

Finding Jupiter's singer Sarah Masi
more 'll. She fits the band's sound
system, drums set and guitars under
her unlofted bed, and still manages to
fit a couch and a futon.

But cramped quarters and dodgy
practice rooms are all worth it for
bands looking to "make it big." Find
ing Jupiter, which graduates seniors
Schaffer and drummer Luke Geor
gette this year, will finish their album
by the end of the quarter and look to
promote it over the summer.
"Basically, our goal right now is to
have a product, to pitch that product,"
Masimore said. "Tlie goal is to push it
as hard as we can and just do what we
love and make it something we can
live on."
The Sea People have the long
term goal of getting signed to an indie
label and possibly playing at festivals
like Coachella. Short term, they are
looking to book more gigs off campus.
In aiming for the big leagues, Find
ing Jupiter and the Sea People can
look to the last Stanford band to
break out and gain recognition:
Young the Giant, formerly The Jakes.
Then a 19-year-old Stanford soph
omore. Young the Giant's lead vocal
ist Sameer Gadhia took an academic
hiatus last December to be a musician
full-time. The band has since been
signed to Roadrunner Records and is
currently on tour opening for indie
rock band, Minus the Bear.
Masimore, who has one year left at
Stanford, was unsure if she would
make the same leap that Gadhia
made.
"If it was like, tour the world or
stay one more year..." she trailed
off.
But Schaffer had no hesitations.
"Let's f —ing tour the world," he
said.
