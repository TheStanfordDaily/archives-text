## Ali tackles educational disparity 
### AMY JULIA HARRIS MANAGING EDITOR 
In the summer of 2009, Russlynn
Ali, assistant secretary for the Office
of Civil Rights (OCR) at the U.S. De
partment of Education, had her sights
set on Beaufort, South Carolina an
area that President Obama referred
to as the "Corridor of Shame" during
the campaign. There was a new char
ter school, Riverview, slated to open
in a gated community that fall
which critics decried as a "white
flight" educational haven that
caught Ali's attention.
"The make-up of the school was 78
percent white and about 19 percent
African-American in a geographic
district that was well over 40 percent
African-American," Ali said.
The OCR, concerned that this
might be a case of modern-day segre
gation, stepped in. Using the weight of
existing federal desegregation orders,
Ali and her office worked with the

charter authorizing board, the school
district and other local bodies to di
versify the student body.
The case of Beaufort was just one
of many areas where Ali and the OCR
division of the department of educa
tion are working to close the achieve
ment gap in the United States. In yes
terday's talk at the Law School, Ali
discussed the Obama administra
tion's plan to combat educational in
equity, a challenge she perceived as
the "civil rights issue of our genera
tion."
"Forty years ago, desegregation
was our highest priority," Ali said at
the event. "And it was to ensure that
'all deliberate speed' happened after
Brown [v. Board of Education]. But
the truth is, that segregation looks dif
ferent today than it did back then."
"It's a civil rights issue, but it does
n't look like one," she later told law
students and undergrads in a ques
tion-and-answer session. "It's not at
the heart of the American conscious

ness. It's about how finding that pas
sion and knowing that makes a mas
sive difference."
Ali came to the helm of the Educa
tion Department's division of the
OCR, the 600-member team tasked
with enforcing federal civil rights laws
that prohibit discrimination in pro
grams that receive federal funding,
with a lot on her plate. The Depart
ment of Education estimated that by
the end of high school, white students
are about six times as likely to be
ready to pursue college-level biology
courses as black students. The depart
ment also gauged that the achieve
ment gap between low-income stu
dents costs the country approximate
ly $5OO billion each year.
"So I go to bed every night and
think, how can we move the dial today
because our sense of urgency couldn't
be greater?" she said. "We do what we
can. That means strategically choos
ing the right districts to launch the
compliance reviews that will have the

greatest impact across the country."
Fresh out of law school at North
western University, Ali was anxious to
prove her worth to her peers and
signed on as a corporate and civil
rights lawyer at the Los Angeles law
firm Sheppard, Mullin, Richter and
Flampton. The financial payoffs were
substantial, but Ali was unsatisfied.
"I literally came home every day
and wanted to purge the film off my
body," she said.
She decided to ditch the partner
track at the law firm and took up pro
bono civil rights cases. In 1999, she be
came co-director of The Advance
ment Project, a legal group that
worked to increase educational ac
cess for minorities, and then became
executive director of Education
Trust-West in Oakland, a nonprofit
aimed at improving educational op
portunities for low-income back
grounds.
From a non-governmental stand
point, she realized that "education
policy was not education policy, it was
politics." But she went into the thick
of the politics-policy jungle in 2009
after receiving a call from President
Obama nominating her for a spot in
the Education Department. She was
confirmed in March 2009.
During her 13-month tenure, Ali
has given the Education Depart
ment's division of the OCR a facelift,
aggressively driving the Obama ad
ministration's goals to close the
achievement gap. In early March, she
launched 38 district-specific compli
ance reviews that aim to provide a
look at whether or not federal civil
rights rules are being consistently and
effectively implemented at a local
level. A handful of colleges will also
be subject to civil rights investiga
tions.
"But at the end of the day, money
is the thing that matters," Ali said.
And the Department of Educa
tion has it. The department has a $46.7
billion budget for the 2010 fiscal year
and more discretionary funds, Ali
pointed out, than the funds of every
other education secretary combined.
Scout Sanders 'll, who worked for
Ali in the Office of Civil Rights in the
fall, was at the heart of the team help
ing prepare the compliance reviews
released this March and said that Ali
was on-point at the law school talk.
"It was very reminiscent of what
I'd heard before," Sanders said. "I
could tell that she has all these
thoughts in her head; when she gets
going on anything she can just talk for
hours with examples. I thought it was
good."
William Koski, a teaching profes
sor in the Law School and director of
the Youth and Education Law Pro
ject, who spends his day representing
children in educational equity and re
form matters, called Ali's reforms
"ambitious and inspirational."
"She's making important moves
on info disaggregation within the
OCR and nicely forming a long-term
plan while balancing the day-to-day
problems she's confronted with," he
said. "By allocating the fiscal re
sources and brain power, she's deal
ing with the most important civil
rights issue."
The talk was co-sponsored by the
American Constitution Society for
Law and Policy and the Youth and
Education Advocates.

area that President Obama referred
to as the "Corridor of Shame" during
the campaign. There was a new char
ter school, Riverview, slated to open
in a gated community that fall
which critics decried as a "white
flight" educational haven that
caught Ali's attention.
"The make-up of the school was 78
percent white and about 19 percent
African-American in a geographic
district that was well over 40 percent
African-American," Ali said.
The OCR, concerned that this
might be a case of modern-day segre
gation, stepped in. Using the weight of
existing federal desegregation orders,
Ali and her office worked with the

charter authorizing board, the school
district and other local bodies to di
versify the student body.
The case of Beaufort was just one
of many areas where Ali and the OCR
division of the department of educa
tion are working to close the achieve
ment gap in the United States. In yes
terday's talk at the Law School, Ali
discussed the Obama administra
tion's plan to combat educational in
equity, a challenge she perceived as
the "civil rights issue of our genera
tion."
"Forty years ago, desegregation
was our highest priority," Ali said at
the event. "And it was to ensure that
'all deliberate speed' happened after
Brown [v. Board of Education]. But
the truth is, that segregation looks dif
ferent today than it did back then."
"It's a civil rights issue, but it does
n't look like one," she later told law
students and undergrads in a ques
tion-and-answer session. "It's not at
the heart of the American conscious

ness. It's about how finding that pas
sion and knowing that makes a mas
sive difference."
Ali came to the helm of the Educa
tion Department's division of the
OCR, the 600-member team tasked
with enforcing federal civil rights laws
that prohibit discrimination in pro
grams that receive federal funding,
with a lot on her plate. The Depart
ment of Education estimated that by
the end of high school, white students
are about six times as likely to be
ready to pursue college-level biology
courses as black students. The depart
ment also gauged that the achieve
ment gap between low-income stu
dents costs the country approximate
ly $5OO billion each year.
"So I go to bed every night and
think, how can we move the dial today
because our sense of urgency couldn't
be greater?" she said. "We do what we
can. That means strategically choos
ing the right districts to launch the
compliance reviews that will have the

greatest impact across the country."
Fresh out of law school at North
western University, Ali was anxious to
prove her worth to her peers and
signed on as a corporate and civil
rights lawyer at the Los Angeles law
firm Sheppard, Mullin, Richter and
Flampton. The financial payoffs were
substantial, but Ali was unsatisfied.
"I literally came home every day
and wanted to purge the film off my
body," she said.
She decided to ditch the partner
track at the law firm and took up pro
bono civil rights cases. In 1999, she be
came co-director of The Advance
ment Project, a legal group that
worked to increase educational ac
cess for minorities, and then became
executive director of Education
Trust-West in Oakland, a nonprofit
aimed at improving educational op
portunities for low-income back
grounds.
From a non-governmental stand
point, she realized that "education
policy was not education policy, it was
politics." But she went into the thick
of the politics-policy jungle in 2009
after receiving a call from President
Obama nominating her for a spot in
the Education Department. She was
confirmed in March 2009.
During her 13-month tenure, Ali
has given the Education Depart
ment's division of the OCR a facelift,
aggressively driving the Obama ad
ministration's goals to close the
achievement gap. In early March, she
launched 38 district-specific compli
ance reviews that aim to provide a
look at whether or not federal civil
rights rules are being consistently and
effectively implemented at a local
level. A handful of colleges will also
be subject to civil rights investiga
tions.
"But at the end of the day, money
is the thing that matters," Ali said.
And the Department of Educa
tion has it. The department has a $46.7
billion budget for the 2010 fiscal year
and more discretionary funds, Ali
pointed out, than the funds of every
other education secretary combined.
Scout Sanders 'll, who worked for
Ali in the Office of Civil Rights in the
fall, was at the heart of the team help
ing prepare the compliance reviews
released this March and said that Ali
was on-point at the law school talk.
"It was very reminiscent of what
I'd heard before," Sanders said. "I
could tell that she has all these
thoughts in her head; when she gets
going on anything she can just talk for
hours with examples. I thought it was
good."
William Koski, a teaching profes
sor in the Law School and director of
the Youth and Education Law Pro
ject, who spends his day representing
children in educational equity and re
form matters, called Ali's reforms
"ambitious and inspirational."
"She's making important moves
on info disaggregation within the
OCR and nicely forming a long-term
plan while balancing the day-to-day
problems she's confronted with," he
said. "By allocating the fiscal re
sources and brain power, she's deal
ing with the most important civil
rights issue."
The talk was co-sponsored by the
American Constitution Society for
Law and Policy and the Youth and
Education Advocates.
