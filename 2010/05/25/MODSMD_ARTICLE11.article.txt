## Stanford scientists join NASA sun mission 
### CAROLINE CHEN STAFF WRITER 
Stanford scientists have teamed up with NASA
to design a satellite that observes the sun and its ef
fects on the earth. The Solar Dynamics Observato
ry (SDO) is part of NASA's "Living With a Star"
program and aims to understand how the sun af
fects our life and environment.
SDO is the first in a series of missions. It con
sists of three components, each of which is over
seen by a different institution. The Helioseismic
and Magnetic Imager, which examines activity
under the surface of the sun and creates vector
magnetograms, is based at Stanford. The Atmos
pheric Imaging Assembly, which images the solar
atmosphere every 10 seconds, is a project overseen
by the Lockheed Martin Solar Astrophysics Labo
ratory in nearby Palo Alto. The University of Col
orado manages the Extreme Ultraviolet Variabili
ty Experiment, which measures extreme ultravio
let irradiance.
The satellite was launched into space in Febru
ary and will orbit 22,000 miles from the earth, tak
ing high-resolution photographs of the sun every
few seconds for the next five years. The program
has been running smoothly since the satellite
began regular observations at the beginning of
May.
The challenge now is for the scientists to ana
lyze the constant influx of data that SDO is send
ing to them and to begin to build a picture of the
earth's star.
According to Todd Hoeksema, who is in charge
of the magnetic imaging component of Stanford's
project and also works as a scientist at Hansen Ex
perimental Physics Laboratory, this mission is un

precedented.
"In the past we were only able to measure the
amount of magnetic field pointed at us," he said.
"These will be the very first vector magnetic field
images that are continuous, and with full coverage,
taken every 45 seconds."
Hoeksema said the photo resolutions are
equivalent to eight times the resolution of a high
definition television.
One of the main goals of the project is to under
stand "space weather" and how the variability of
the sun affects the earth.
"This is a really big issue if you're a power com
pany, airline or a GPS company," said Professor
Philip Scherrer, a physics research professor and a
member of Stanford's Helioseismic and Magnetic
Imager team.
"Space weather can disrupt many technologi
cal systems," he added.
Coronal mass ejections billions of tons of
plasma released by the sun have the ability to
damage satellites. Up to $1 billion a year is lost on
spacecraft damage, Scherrer said.
In 1989, a geomagnetic storm caused by a coro
nal mass ejection tripped circuit breakers on the
Hydro-Quebec transmission system's power grid,
causing it to collapse and leaving six million Que
bec residents without power for hours.
The SDO mission aims to develop techniques
that would allow scientists to predict solar activity,
like the storm that impacted Quebec. While scien
tists can do little to prevent or change space weath
er, this would allow companies to take defensive
action.
For example, satellite companies could disable
interconnected sections within their satellites to
reduce the susceptibility of the entire system. Air

line companies could also reroute flights that go
over the poles in order not to lose radio communi
cations.
Another goal of the mission is to understand
the sun on a global scale. Hoeksema explained that
in the past, scientists had to pick between viewing
a specific part of the sun in high resolution and see
ing the whole star in low resolution. This meant
that if events at one point of the sun were affecting
other parts of the star, they could not examine
everything at the same time.
"So for the first time," Hoeksema said,"SDO is
going to put together the whole picture of what's
going on at the surface, in the atmosphere, all at the
same time. We can see the global picture now."
