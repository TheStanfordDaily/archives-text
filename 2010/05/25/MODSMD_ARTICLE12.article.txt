## EDITORIAL Draw system poses disadvantages for draw groups, campus diversity 
### 
The results of the Housing Draw have
been released, and across campus stu
dents are reacting to their housing as
signments for the coming academic year. In
anticipation of this year's Draw, Residential
Education (ResEd) made several key
changes to the housing selection process.
While these changes have been beneficial to
housing applicants in some areas, they have
also made the process more difficult in other
ways.

specifications and choices for housing, but at
the same time larger draw groups are having
their rooming options significantly limited.
The disadvantages of the current Draw
system are not limited to draw groups.
Changes to Housing policies and the Draw
over the last few years have had a significant
impact on the campus housing dynamic, the
most significant being the soft segregation of
campus life according to class year. The cen
tralization of the freshman student body into
Wilbur and Stern has removed a lot of four
class influence on the freshman experience.
At the same time, Row houses and co-ops
have tended to become housed exclusively
with Tier One residents, who usually tend to
be upperclassmen. With most students saving
their higher tiers for later years, the chances
of sophomores, and even juniors, making it
into Row houses or co-ops is becoming in
creasingly slim.This type of de facto class sep
aration undermines a part of the Stanford
residential experience that many students
value, as having a mixed-year population in
residences helps keep campus life vibrant
and interconnected.

ResEd has done much to make the Draw
process clearer and more specific students
now apply for specific room types in addition
to choosing housing preferences. This has al
lowed students to more clearly indicate what
type of living space they desire. Though in
house draws will still continue in the weeks
ahead, the former tradition of drawing and
selecting room types at in-house draw has
been rendered obsolete by the new system.
For draw group members, this change has
forced many to rethink their living arrange
ments and preferences in order to live with
their friends. Specifically, draw groups where
some members prefer one type of room and
other members prefer another type are sim
ply not accommodated under this system.
For instance, if a group of four students
three girls and a boy wanted to draw to
gether as two girls rooming together while
the other girl and the boy live in singles, this
arrangement is no longer feasible when each
group member must select the same type of
room preference. In this way, the new system
affords smaller groups and individuals more

While the current Draw process may af
ford clearer choices in some areas, it also cre
ates problems that ResEd should consider as
they observe the effects of this year's Draw
and how the student population is dispersed
across campus. Choice does not always equal
a better outcome, and the precision of the
current Draw system may lead to a more uni
form, less diverse living environment on
campus as time goes on.
