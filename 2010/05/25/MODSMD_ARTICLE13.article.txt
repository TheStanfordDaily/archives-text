## Regrowing the Farm

"The Trustees...shall have power, and it shall
be their duty... to maintain on the Palo Alto es
tate a farm for instruction in agriculture in all
its branches."

You might not recognize that quote, but it
comes straight from Stanford's founding
charter. And it's part of why we still refer to
our campus as "the Farm." While life on the
Farm has changed considerably since those
words were first written in 1885, we believe
the Stanfords' founding words are no less -
and perhaps even more - important now.
In 2009, the Dean of Earth Sciences and
the Stanford Farm Educator proposed the
creation of a new two-acre production farm
on campus.

The proposed farm would provide a valu
able opportunity for students to engage in
hands-on learning about food systems. As we
confront many of the environmental, social,
and economic problems facing our world, it is
increasingly apparent that our conventional
food systems are in need of significant re
form. We face growing food insecurity, a na
tional obesity epidemic, factory farms that
lead to pathogenic resistance, and marine
dead zones from fertilizer and pesticide over
use which are all signs of the large discon
nect between our farms and our plates.
But these problems are also powerful op
portunities. Each of these challenges reflects
a chance for us to transform how we connect
with the food that nourishes our bodies.

A production farm will allow us to do just
that. It will provide students with opportuni
ties to directly apply their classroom knowl
edge, conduct research, and perhaps even
find innovative ways of producing food. For
the growing number of undergraduates look
ing to pursue careers in this field, the farm
will be a valuable resource, a kind of living
laboratory for the study of sustainable food
and agriculture.
More broadly, a new farm will provide un
dergraduates with opportunities to engage in
hands-on learning. For a place called the
Farm, there are surprisingly few outlets for
students to actually learn about farming: only
a handful of gardens exist on campus, and the
current community farm is largely taken up
by graduate student, faculty, and staff plots.

Yes, there are classes on agricultural eco
nomics, farmworker healthcare, and the poli
tics of the U.S. Farm Bill, but there's just one
class on campus where students can learn
how to actually grow their own food: Earth
Systems 1808, Principles and Practices of
Sustainable Agriculture. And it's consistently
oversubscribed.

An on-campus production farm will help
meet this growing student demand and re
connect students with the source of their
food. By sourcing this campus-produced
food to dining halls and the Stanford Pro
duce Stand, we can help close the loop on our
university's food system. Not only will a new
farm provide opportunities for students, it
will provide Stanford with an opportunity to
become a leader among universities in food
system sustainability.
In support of this project, students this
year formed the Stanford Farm Project, an
initiative meant to educate and gather sup
port for this much-needed resource on cam
pus. The Stanford Farm Project is currently
circulating a petition for the Stanford com
munity to show support for the creation of
the proposed two-acre farm. We believe stu
dent involvement is necessary in the entire
process - from planning to implementation
and beyond - to create a resource that best
suits students' academic needs.

A few years ago, students succeeded in
creating a sustainable food coordinator posi
tion within Stanford Dining, resulting in
more sustainable purchasing decisions and
initiatives in our dining halls. We now ask the
administration to again respond to the re
quests of its students by providing a place for
education about an area of study as impor
tant and interdisciplinary as food and agri
culture.

125 years ago, the Stanfords recognized
the importance of hands-on agricultural edu
cation. Today, we strongly believe that educa
tion about agriculture and sustainable food
systems is essential to understanding the
challenges we now face and will continue to
face as future leaders.
