# JUST A THOUGHT
## I must just be confused... 
### Nikola Milanovic 
Watching my spouse die in the hospi
tal was pretty difficult. At least, I
imagine it was pretty difficult for his
family, who were there with him. After dedi
cating ourselves to spending our lives togeth
er, in sickness or in health, I couldn't stand by
his side in the hospital because I had no legal
right to do so. I didn't even have the right to
make medical treatment decisions for him
when he was unable to.

Being legally barred by hospital staff from
comforting my spouse in his last hours was
painful. It was especially tough because he
wasn't a legal citizen we were unable to
expedite his path to citizenship through mar
riage, a privilege granted to other, opposite
sex couples. His citizenship doesn't matter
now though even if he had become natu
ralized, I would be prevented by law from ob
taining his Social Security pension or other
government benefits.

That was the least of our concerns. Even
years after the ceremony, after living togeth
er for so long, he wasn't allowed to put our
house in my name without paying more taxes
than he could afford. We were never allowed
to transfer property tax-free or file our taxes
together no matter how much we insisted on
the legitimacy of our partnership or our life
long commitment to each other.
The provisions we were never granted
wouldn't have mattered so much if we didn't
both lose our jobs when our employers found
out we were each other's spouses, because we
had no legal guarantee of job security from
prejudice. We lost our community center
membership and were asked to leave our
church, and never had any legal protection
from discrimination. If it weren't for the con
stant vandalism and disparaging letters we
get, even that wouldn't have mattered so

much. But, as it is, we had no legal protection
against harassment.
I guess none of this would have been the
case if we were legally allowed to marry. But
we weren't.

They've told me all the reasons my spouse
and I weren't allowed to marry. And it makes
sense. They told me that marriage is just for
procreation; I guess that seems pretty rea
sonable, I'm just not sure why we don't bar
infertile couples and women past menopause
from ever marrying. My neighbors were in
their seventies when they got married to each
other I guess they'll be expecting soon.
I heard that we need to come together as
a society in order to preserve the sanctity of
marriage. That makes sense to me. Divorce
rates hover around 50 percent for all mar
riages (with 7.1 marriages and 3.5 divorces
for every 1000 people.) I guess that's not as
much of a threat to marriage as my partner
and I, though, who never contemplated leav
ing each other. I suppose people reneging on
"as long as we shall live, in sickness and in
health," isn't a threat to marriage's sanctity.
People worry about my capacity to raise a
child with my spouse. They must know some
thing I don't. I'm not sure what it is that
makes me an inherently inferior parent, but I
sure wouldn't want to raise a kid if my spouse
and I are incapable of doing so. I just wish

someone would tell me why I can't be a good
father. But if the government agrees, they
must be right.
They told me that it's necessary to pre
serve important religious institutions. I agree.
I wouldn't want to ruin anything by corrupt
ing sacred ceremonies like marriage. Or ritu
alistic sacrifice. Or public stoning as punish
ment for adultery. Or witch burning. I guess
nobody cared about preserving those reli
gious institutions though protecting them
must not have mattered as much as keeping
me from getting married.
When I was young my parents told me
that, when two adults love each other, they
make the most important vows of their lives
and pledge their commitment to each other
through marriage. I always thought that
would happen to me but there must have
been more stipulations than my parents let
on. I guess the consensual love and devotion
my spouse and I share don't matter as much
as our gender.
I feel like I'm in love â€”\p>l have an unre
lenting desire to share in the life of only one
other person for as long as I live. But this
can't be love; at least not the way love is legal
ly defined. I must just be confused.
I used to pray that I wouldn't be victim to
the feelings I had. I suppose whoever heard
my prayers must have had more pressing
matters to attend to. That's reasonable, given
that this is a lifestyle choice. I just wish it was
a choice that /got to make maybe then I
could have avoided the ostracization and
legal obstacles I've faced.
But at least the institution of marriage is
safe from me.
