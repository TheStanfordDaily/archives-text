# BROADLY SPEAKING
## The 						Success or Stagnation of Jamba Juice 
### Molly Spaeth 
A few months ago a good friend of mine
moved back to the Bay Area to start
working at one of the most powerful
companies in the world. One night, after we
spent three hours eating burritos at Chipotle
and planning what kind of themed progres
sive we could throw at IKEA, I drove him
back to the Caltrain station on the eve of his
first full day on the job. As he got out of the
car, he looked me in the eye and said, "Molly,
I'm scared. I just want to work at Jamba
Juice."
As you can expect, my jaw dropped (and
along with it my Diet Coke). John exuded
confidence. He had been extraordinarily suc
cessful at Stanford, had just spent the last few
months seeing more of the world than Car
men San Diego had and was about to jump
into an entry-level position at one of the most
successful companies in the world. And now
all of a sudden he wanted to work at Jamba
Juice?
But his comment, although uttered half
jokingly, was not completely unfounded.
John was at a juncture that every one of us
has faced and will continue to face for the
rest of our lives. He was about to jump from
the comfortable rung of wild success up and
onto the next unsteady rung of the ladder,
that step up that is inextricably linked with
the ambiguity of success or failure. His desire
to work at Jamba Juice had less to do with his
projections of a personal smoothie-success
rate and more to do with the fact that his new
"dream job" invited the possibility of the un
known it invited the possibility of failure.
A few months ago, one of my very best
friends from home became the North Dako
ta Truman Scholar. Although I was absolute
ly thrilled for him, I couldn't help but also
feel a little disheartened. I had made the leap
from the small pond of Fargo South High
School to the Pacific Ocean of Stanford Uni
versity and was nowhere near becoming a
Truman Scholar. As I was whining to a dear
friend of mine about whether or not I should
have stayed closer to the small pond where
success was a sure thing, he looked at me and
said point-blank, "You wouldn't have been

successful. You would have been stagnant."
As much as it pains me to admit it, he was
right. I would not have been happy had I
stayed in North Dakota just as John would
not have been happy working at Jamba Juice.
Although we may be absolutely petrified the
moment we take the leap into deeper waters,
we also know that the risks of missed oppor
tunity vastly outweigh the risks of potential
failure. It is far easier to say "Why not?" than
it is to say "What if?"
Five months later, John has found both his
cloud and his silver lining. Fie hates his job,

but at least he is SURE he hates his job. As he
reflected to me on what his life has meant in
the past few months he remarked, "This is the
first time I've ever seen this in myself; I
KNOW I can't do it. Somewhere deep down
there's a gear that I don't have that will keep
me from truly succeeding in this position ...
But I knew I had to try it."
John had to try it because he wouldn't
have been happy if he hadn't. As much as it
may kill us to know that there is a limit to our
potential, it kills us even more to think that
we may not be truly living up to our potential.
One of the greatest things I have come to
love and admire about my peers at Stanford
is that there is no limit for what they can
imagine. We are not going to stop dreaming
until we are broken, until we finally reach
that rung on the ladder that so vehemently
and violently shatters our egos and our self
worth that we are thrown off the very
precipice of our success, no longer wondering
"What if?" but screaming "Thank God!"
Simone de Beauvoir once said, "There are
people filled with such horror at the idea of
defeat that they keep themselves from ever
doing anything. But no one would dream of
considering this gloomy passivity as the tri
umph of freedom."
Until we reach that point of defeat we are
going to keep climbing, an act I believe is si
multaneously one of the most admirable and
terrifying characteristics I have ever discov
ered to exist in people. That refusal to be
stagnant, that blind determination that pre
vents us from settling for anything short of
our absolute maximum potential is one of the
greatest indicators of success I could ever
hope for. And although ultimately you have
to just do what you feel, I believe there is far
greater fulfillment to be found in being bro
ken but triumphant than stagnant and still
dreaming, "What if?"

Molly's life goal was achieved at age 17 (when
she got into Stanford) and she has consequent
ly spent the last three years (unsuccessfully)
searching for a new one. E-mail suggestions to
