## Bring back integrity 
### Justin Marpole-Bird 
On May 20, Floyd Landis,
thirty-four years of age, a
professional cyclist and
former winner of the
Tour de France the
sport's most prestigious honor â€”admit-
ted to using performance-enhancing
drugs for the majority of his cycling ca
reer. In addition to ensconcing the cy
cling world in one more drug scandal,
Landis also accused other top cyclists, in
cluding seven-time Tour de France win
ner and media darling Lance Arm
strong, of doping as well. Landis's stated
reason for coming clean is that the bur
den of the lie was too great to bear any
more. However, that feeling of personal
exoneration has come at a high price.
Already stripped of his 2006 Tour win
a year after winning the race, Landis now
must admit to lying to a grand jury, in ad
dition to surely falling even further in the
eyes of his peers and former followers.
However, as Landis emerges as the next
in a long succession of professional ath
letes to be found guilty of using perform
ance-enhancing drugs, one must ask if
the sporting world has any integrity left.
If sportsmen and women, from base
ball slugger Jose Canseco, to sprinter
Marion Jones, to football player Brian
Cushing and cyclist Michael Rasmussen,
are so intent on using drugs to take them
to bigger and better performances,
should we just let them? At least there
would be no false hope in their integrity,
no expectation of anything else. You
could rest assured that virtually every
good athlete on the planet was using
something that did not come naturally to
him or her. Would that not just make
everything easier?
May 12,2010 saw the passing of con
troversial sprinting coach and Stanford
alumnus Charlie Francis after a five-year
battle with cancer. Although a brilliant
athletic mind, Francis is best remem
bered for coaching infamous drug cheat
Ben Johnson to the 1987 World Champi
onship title in the 100 meters and then
the 1988 Olympic gold medal in the
same distance before Johnson tested
positive at those Olympics in Seoul,
South Korea. Though he did not deny
any allegations of supplying his athlete
with the anabolic steroid stanozolol,
Francis was banned from the sport for
life for his refusal to admit wrongdoing.
I had the fortune of knowing Charlie
Francis as a high school track athlete (un
officially of course), and he maintained
from when I knew him to the day he died
that no sprinter would ever make it onto
the world or Olympic stage without the
aid of performance-enhancing drugs.
Perhaps Charlie would rethink that in
light of Usain Bolt's recent assault on the
barriers of human performance, perhaps
not. Nevertheless, he is most certainly
not alone in that sentiment, and there is a
veiy good chance that the World Anti-
Doping Agency (WADA) and Interna
tional Olympic Committee (IOC) are
not catching half of the drug cheats in
sport. So, with increasingly more money
in developing drugs than in testing for
them, are organizations like WADA
wasting their time and money?
Although many may have lost faith in
the integrity of the sporting world, to
allow performance-enhancing drugs to
be used without opposition would be to
sacrifice the very essence of sportsman
ship.
As sport has become commercial
ized, it has been tempted by, and taken
on, many undesirable elements. When
ever there are regulations or limitations,
there will also be those who seek to push
them. In sport, such as any other com
mercial venture, breaking the rules can,
unfortunately, pay dividends. However, a
distinction does and should exist.
Purists will tell you that competing in
a sport shows you exactly who and what
you are. It illuminates you to your very
core, and for better or worse bares your
qualities; you cannot run from it and you
cannot escape it. Pitting your very
essence against that of another is what
true competition is. It is not only proving
to those around you but also proving to
yourself the strength of your own resolve
and what you are capable of
Every accomplished athlete I have
known has shared one thing: a complete
ly unwavering belief in his or her own
ability. They believe themselves capable
of beating all comers under all condi
tions, without fear or favor. Those ath
letes would not cheat, for they believe
too strongly in their own ability to resort
to that. There is honor in that; there is in
tegrity in that.There is no integrity, honor
or sense of accomplishment in a compe
tition between pharmacists.
Invariably, athletes will reach a point
in their career when improvements are
no longer forthcoming and they can as
pire to no greater honors. At that point,
rather than sinking to drug use, those
athletes should just accept that they
have taken all that they can from sport.
Having achieved all that they can, these
athletes should realize that it is time to
move on and perhaps consider giving
something back instead of stealing un
deserved and tainted glory.
