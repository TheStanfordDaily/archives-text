# CHAMPIONSHIP CHASE
## Stanford beats Notre Dame 4-1 to advance to national championship 
### WILL SEATON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
There has been no stopping this
year's Stanford women's tennis team.
After upsetting the No. 1 seed Baylor
Bears in the quarterfinals, the No. 8
Cardinal continued its run by rolling
past No. 5 Notre Dame 4-1 to make it
to its first NCAA final since 2006.
After experiencing a few years of
steadily declining results, the 2010 pro
gram has broken through to surpass
all expectations and make it all the
way to the final match of the year. Op
posite the Cardinal in the champi
onship will be an old foe, No. 3 Florida.
"We've played them in so many fi
nals over the years," said head coach
Lele Forood. "It just feels like when
you go to a Stanford-Florida final, it
kind of feels like the old days again.
They were our national rivals for so
long."
Notre Dame put up quite the chal
lenge for Stanford in the semifinals by
coming out firing on all cylinders. For
only the second time all season, Stan
ford lost the doubles point. The Fight
ing Irish won the first match of the day
when their No. 2 team upset Stanford's
freshman team of Mallory Burdette
and Stacey Tan, 8-3. The Cardinal tied
it when the No. 3 team of junior Car
olyn McVeigh and sophomore Veroni
ca Li defeated its opponents, 8-4.
With the match score at 1-1, the
doubles came down to a matchup be
tween the second- and third-best
teams in the country, Stanford's junior
Hilary Barte and senior Lindsay Bur
dette and Notre Dame's Kristy
Frilling and Kali Krisik, respectively.
Tied almost the whole way, Notre
Dame's team held on to win the last
two games to secure the 8-6 upset.The
Fighting Irish join UCLA as the only
two teams to win the doubles point
over Stanford this year.
"We didn't play great in doubles,
and Notre Dame played well,"
Forood said. "But we had to prove
that that didn't mean just because we
couldn't win the doubles point, we
couldn't win the match."
The doubles point was as far as

Notre Dame was able to get. Coming
into singles fired up, Stanford won the
first set in five out of six of its match
es, including a tiebreaker win by
Veronica Li. Li was forced to come
back from 5-1 down to eke out the
first set.
Mallory Burdette finished her
match first, recording a 6-0,6-1 victo
ry to even the overall score at 1-1.
Older sister Lindsay Burdette fin
ished next, seemingly erasing her sea
son struggles in one of her most dom
inant displays of tennis yet, winning a
6-1,6-2 decision.
"Their coach came up to Mallory
and I today," Lindsay Burdette said,
"and told us that we were monsters
out there. He said, 'you guys outdid us
from the second we walked out after
the doubles point.' Our mentality, our
positivity, that's something we've all
been talking about because a lot of
teams don't have that."
Next off the court was Stacey Tan,
playing tough tennis to stop a late
Notre Dame resurgence. Up 6-2, 5-2
and serving for the match, Tan was
broken and found herself in a much
tighter 5-4 second set. Down 0-30 in
the last game, she was able to collect
herself and reeled off four points for
the win.
"It was on my serve and I lost the
first point.Then I lost the second,"Tan
said. "I didn't understand what I was
so nervous about. I was winning the
match, playing my game, and I
thought I should go back to what
worked."
Now up 3-1, Stanford was on the
brink of a championship match berth.
Barte was struggling to maintain her
one-break lead in the second set. At 4-
3 in the second set, Barte faced two
break points before dropping her
serve to tie her match at 4-4. Calling on
her usual resolve, Stanford's No. 1
player all season long broke back for
the right to serve out her match. She
lost the first point, but reeled off four
points to clinch Stanford's victory over
Notre Dame and a long-awaited re
turn to the final.
Every player in Stanford's lineup
has earned a point in this tournament.
That only highlights the depth and
unity that this team has had all season.
"When a couple of us are strug
gling, the other people are picking up
the slack and getting the job done,"

FLORIDA (29-2)

STANFORD (251)

5/25 • ATHENS, GA. 11 A.M.COVERAGE:TVESPNU


SIMON WARBY/The Stanford Daily
Stanford senior Lindsay Burdette led the No. 8 Cardinal in a 4-1 beat down of No. 6 Notre Dame in the NCAA tournament.
Although Stanford lost the doubles point, the Card took four straight singles matches to advance to the
championship game.



Lindsay Burdette said. "That is what
we've always been talking about."
Since the incredible streak of
three national championships came
to an end in 2006, not a single player
on this year's roster has been in an
NCAA final. With totally fresh faces
meeting this new experience, Forood
is looking forward to seeing how this

team handles the pressure.
"It feels really exciting," Forood
said. "No one on this team has been in
the finals before, so it's a new experi
ence for everybody. However, we
have the right combination of experi
ence and belief and everybody has
played some great matches until this
point."
Stanford will compete in the
NCAA championship match today at
11 a.m. PST in Athens, Ga.
