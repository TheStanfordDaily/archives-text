### JENNY PETER STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford women's golf team
finished 19th at the NCAA Champi
onships in Wilmington, N.C. last week.
The Cardinal ended the tournament
with its lowest round, a two-over 290,
and had a combined score of 1199 (47-
over-par) over 72 holes.The top four out
of five individual scores from each
round were added together to deter
mine the final score.

"It was an overall great experience,"
said senior Angela King. "Despite our
finish, it was really great being able to go
back to nationals as a team my senior
year. The competition was tough, but
I'm proud to say that nobody on our
team ever gave up."
Purdue grasped its first national title
with an overall score of 1153 (one
over), though not before fighting off a
tough challenge from USC. On the last
day, Purdue was gradually losing its
comfortable lead to USC as the Trojans
carded a solid round. In fact, late in the
day, the tournament looked to be head
ed to a playoff until USC's Jennifer
Song missed a birdie attempt on the
18th hole that would have tied the score.
The Trojans' last round score of 289
wasn't enough to knock the Boilermak
ers from the top spot. USC finished sec
ond overall at 1154 (two-over),one shot
behind Purdue. Alabama (five-over),
Arizona State (nine-over) and Arizona
(14-over) placed third, fourth and fifth,
respectively.
On the opening day of the tourna
ment, Stanford tied for 19th after shoot
ing a 300 and was 18 strokes behind

leader USC. Junior Rebecca Durham
led the Cardinal in the first round with a
one-under-par 71.
After a thunder-and-lightning sus
pension on Wednesday, Stanford strug
gled, finishing the second round with a
307 and dropping to 21st in the stand
ings.
Thursday was also an uphill battle as
the team fought for a 302 and remained
in 21st place. Freshmen Sally Watson led
the team after three rounds and was tied
for 28th individually after shooting a
total 0f220 (four-over).
On Friday, Watson helped her team
with a 66 in the last round and finished
tied for ninth place overall with a 286
(two-under). Teammate and fellow
freshman Kristina Wong also fared well
for the team, carding a final round 67 to
finish the tournament tied for 27th at
293 (five-over). Caroline Hedwall from
Oklahoma State won the individual
title after carding a276 total (12-under).
Durham finished 112 th with a 311,
King finished her collegiate career 121 st
with a 318 and sophomore Sydney Burli
son ended in 124 th place with a 325.
"The highlight was standing on the
ninth hole and watching everyone
come in on the last day," Durham said.
"The freshmen played stellar. And al
though we didn't play the way we want
ed to, we still accomplished a lot this
year."
"The program is heading in the right
direction, we learned a lot, went to Na
tionals and are ready for an amazing up
coming year," Durham added.
