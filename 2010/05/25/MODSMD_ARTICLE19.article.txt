the Warren Golf Course in South Bend, Ind.

Stanford led the tournament from start to

first round 277 (three-under) on Thursday.
The Cardinal closed out the three-day tour

beat second place Florida State (six-under) by
four strokes.
Florida (two-under), Duke (one-under)
and LSU (seven-over) will also advance to the
NCAA Championships from the Central Re

"We came in with the mindset that we
wanted to win this tournament and we're excit
ed that we were able to do so," Stanford head
coach Conrad Ray told GoStanford.com. "It
was a great field and I felt it was one of the
stronger regionals out there. We had a
good vibe from the first shot we hit in
the practice round."
The Indiana skies stayed clear for
most of the weekend, except for a
brief rain delay during the second
round on Friday.
Three of Stanford's five players
finished in the top 10 individually.
Chung led the team with a three
round score of 206 (four-under),
enough for a fourth-place finish, two

son of Florida State.
Chung carded a 67 to kick off the
weekend and finished with a 70 and
a 69.
Ziegler shot a final-round 69 to fin

fifth place overall.
Kim was consistent all week, post
ing scores 0f69,69 and 70 to finish tied
for sixth at 208 (two-under).
Yun posted a four-under 66 on Sat
urday to climb up to a 19th-place tie at
even-par 210.

Pac-10 Championships, failed to go
under par, posting rounds 0f70,74 and
72 to finish tied for 39th.
Stanford is seeking its ninth na
