# IRAQ ASKS HOOVER TO RETURN RECORDS
## Institution is still doubtful about documents' security in Baghdad 
### DEVIN BANERJEE SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Iraqi National Library and Archives
has asked Stanford's Hoover Institution to re
turn Baath Party records acquired in early 2008
on a five-year loan a request Hoover is re
sisting because it doesn't deem security in
Baghdad sufficient to ensure the documents'
security.
The records consist of more than seven mil
lion documents that once belonged to Iraq's
Baath Party and security forces, which ruled the
country from 1968 until its overthrow by U.S.

and coalition forces in 2003. The documents
came to Hoover via the Iraq Memory Founda
tion (IMF), a Washington, D.C.-based group
that entered Baghdad in 2003 to protect histor
ical records.
Richard Sousa, the director of Hoover's li
brary and archives, brokered the agreement
with the foundation, which agreed to store the
Baath records in a Hoover archive until condi
tions in Baghdad are sufficient to ensure the
archive's security.
"We have documents from the Iraqi min
istry saying Hoover can hold on to these while
we [the ministry] find a safe haven for them,"

Sousa said. "Now, even though the Iraqis say
things are better, it's certainly not clear to
everyone that the situation is better."
Indeed, several scholars have, in light of the
request, lamented the security in Baghdad,
where the National Library and Archives is lo
cated.

"Circumstances are unstable in Iraq
there are different actors with a variety of mo
tives and the ability to ensure the physical in
tegrity of the documents is questionable," said
Larry Diamond '73 M.A. '7B Ph.D. 'BO, a
Hoover senior fellow and former adviser to the
Coalition Provisional Authority in Baghdad.

"If you're a Baath terrorist and you know these
records have been physically returned to Iraq
and are sitting in building X or basement Y,
that's going to be a very inviting target."
Abbas Milani, the director of Iranian stud
ies and an Iranian exile, expressed concern that
the records, if returned, could be used for polit
ical means.

"My fear is that, if the rest of the region is
any example, those in power will use these doc
uments for scoring political points against op
ponents," Milani said. "I would hope that they
would go back to a democratic Iraq that will
make them readily available to scholars, equal

ly available to scholars and safely available to
scholars."

"It doesn't take an area expert to really see
that Iraq today is not a very safe place for these
kinds of valuable documents," he added.
The director of the Iraqi National Library
and Archives, Saad Eskander, has made the re
quest not only to Hoover which he and a
delegation did in person earlier this month
but also to the National Archives in Washing
ton, which currently stores a Jewish archive,
