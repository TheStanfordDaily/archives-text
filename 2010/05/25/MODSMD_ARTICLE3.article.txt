## City council discusses hospital expansion 
### JULIA BROWNELL SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Palo Alto City Council convened last night to hold a study
session of the Environmental Impact Report (EIR), Fiscal Im
pact Analysis and Development Agreement for the proposed ex
pansion of the Stanford University Medical Center (SUMC).
The four-hour meeting initiated what will be a long review
process within the city on the expansion. SUMC includes the
Stanford Hospital & Clinics, Lucile Packard Children's Hospital
and the Hoover Pavilion administrative buildings. The $3.5 bil
lion project proposes a net 1.31 million-square-foot expansion of
the hospitals.
The main concerns raised about the project involved housing
and transportation for the 2,200 new employees at the hospital
and additional patients. In addition, much talk revolved around
fiscal impacts of the project for Palo Alto and the possibility of
revenue guarantees on Stanford's part.
The meeting began with a discussion on the timeline for the
city approval process.The policy is set to finish review by Decem
ber 2010. This ambitious date was lauded by council members,
who also raised concern about possible points of slippage.
"We're moving forward in expeditious manner but also obvi
ously a very thorough manner," said Palo Alto Mayor Patrick
Burt. "That will be a challenge for us."
Three presentations were made: one on the EIR, one on the
two fiscal analyses and one on the preliminary city proposal of a
development agreement.
Environmental Impact Review (EIR)
The EIR, presented by Rod Jeung of PBS&J Consultants,
summarized the impacts of the project on the current environ
ment. The main impacts would include increasing housing to re
duce transportation congestion to the hospital. In addition, 71
protected trees are threatened by the hospital expansion, along
with a historic stone building. The report also identified areas for
mitigation to improve outcomes.
PBS&J drafted seven different alternatives to Stanford's pro
posal. Two involved little change, save for a request that hospitals
comply with the state's seismic safety standards. Another two in
volved what Jeung termed "right-sizing," or reduced intensity in
terventions. A tree-preservation alternative proposed to elimi
nate construction on Kaplan Lawn and a historical preservation
alternative aimed to protect the stone building.
Finally, the village concept alternative looked at ways to re
duce greenhouse gases by decreasing transport through in
creased public transportation and nearby housing development.
This option sparked the most discussion within the council.
The EIR committee determined that the least-impact option
that best meets objectives was the "right-sizing" Reduced Inten-
sity Alternative A, which addresses
state mandates.
Fiscal Analysis
Next, the council was briefed on
the two different fiscal analyses of the
expansion project. One was given by
CBRE Consulting, contracted
through SUMC,the other by Applied
Development Economics (ADE),
commissioned by the city.
CBRE's report projected $7.6 mil
lion in surplus revenue to the city. The
taxes and fees generated would po
tentially offset the anticipated costs
of municipal services to the projects
over the next 30 years.
ADE on the other hand, had a
much higher estimate of costs, and
therefore found a $l.l million deficit
to the city. However, as noted in the
meeting, both analyses did not in
clude inflation. When ADE added in
inflation as higher for costs than ben
efits, they found an even larger
deficit. Debate ensued as to the role
of inflation in the analysis.
Development Agreement
Palo Alto also outlined a develop
ment agreement counter offer to
Stanford's proposal, which, if ap
proved, would supplement the Stan
ford offer rather than replace it.
Stanford's current proposal involves
re-zoning the area from a public facil
ities zone into a special hospital zone
for the project. There was concern
that this zoning change would allow
for projects in the future without the
same degree of review they go
through today. However, the council
also recognized the increased effi
ciency of this possibility.
The main issues of the develop
ment agreement were the GO Pass
initiative and revenue guarantees to
make the project cost-neutral. The
GO Pass would require Stanford to
give the transit pass to all the employ
ees to reduce vehicle traffic.
The parties should look at "very,
very aggressive trip reduction," said
Heyward Robinson, a councilman

visiting from Menlo Park.
In addition, the revenue-neutral
measure would require Stanford to
give Palo Alto a sum to offset any rev
enue losses found to accrue over
time. If the project became fiscally
negative for the city, Stanford would
offer a sum to offset the cost.
The agreement asks for increased
school fees to cover additional stu
dents in the school district. It also re
quests $3O million to fund citywide in
frastructure.
