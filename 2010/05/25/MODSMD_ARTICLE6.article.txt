## Campaigns host joint Middle East debate 
### ELLEN HUET DESK EDITOR 
After weeks in the campus spotlight,
the debate over divestment from compa
nies in the Middle East region came to a
head on Monday at a discussion jointly
sponsored by two opposing campaigns.
Fadi Quran 'lO, an organizer for Cam
paign Restore Hope (CRH), and Yishai
Kabaker 'lO, an organizer for Invest for
Peace (IFP), debated the history of con
flict in the region as well as possible solu
tions and ways for students to get in
volved.

The debate came as the final of three
events co-sponsored by the two groups.
Quran spoke last Sunday about his expe
riences growing up in the West Bank;
Chaya Gilboa, a visiting fellow at UC-
Berkeley, spoke last Monday about her
experiences in Jerusalem during the First
Intifada.

Law professor Allen Weiner moderat
ed the debate between Quran and
Kabaker, who spent the first part of the
debate considering the wider picture of
the Arab-Israeli conflict in the region,
touching upon Israeli and Palestinian pol
icy approaches to conflict resolution.
Kabaker, who advocated investment,
said that despite several compromise of
fers and United Nations resolutions,
Palestinians have not sought to establish

their own state but have instead tried to
undermine Israel.
"The Palestinians, by going through
militant institutions, rather than through
grassroots campaigns, usurp the ability of
the Palestinian people to accomplish
peaceful means," Kabaker said, empha
sizing what he called "the rejection of nu
merous Israeli peace offers."
"The Palestinian people have not
worked to build a state for themselves," he
added. "They've worked to undermine
the Jewish state."

Quran, in response, said the current
state of Israeli-Palestinian relations have
not allowed Palestinians the opportunity
to establish a peaceful state.
"Certainly, Palestinian policies do
need to be changed," he said. "But to say
that Palestinians have not built their
country and instead focused on destroy
ing Israel is false. Israel prevents Palestini
ans from building a state through the poli
cies they implement."
Kabaker, in turn, spoke in favor of a
two-state solution with "high standards"

for Palestine's actions.
"They need to learn to accept a Jewish
state as their neighbor," he said. "They
don't need to love us, but they need to tol
erate us."
On the topic of options for student in
volvement, each speaker emphasized the
basic goals of their respective campaigns.
CRH aimed to ensure that Stanford does
not invest in any companies that are aid
ing human rights violations and IFP en
couraged students to invest in non-profits
that help habitants of the region.
"Ultimately, the motivations for di
vestment is in de-legitimizing Israel,
which does nothing to benefit the Pales
tinian people," Kabaker said. He said peo
ple should instead invest and "put their
money where their mouth is" by building
up individuals.
Quran disagreed, saying the cause of
conflict needed to end before reparations
could begin.
"It doesn't make sense to me to give a
Palestinian woman $5O to open a super
market and then give a company $50,000
in American investments that might help
the Israeli military," he said.
In the question-and-answer session
that followed, CRH organizer Moham
mad Ali 'lO said he was still unsure "why
divestment and investment are mutually

At yesterday's discussion, Yishai Kabaker (left) and Fadi Quran (right) exchanged
thoughts on the history of conflict in the Middle East and the University-related
debate over divestment. The event was co-sponsored by CRH and IFP
exclusive," and asked why Kabaker
found divestment hurtful.
"The divestment tactics used here
are focused against Israel," Kabaker
said. "By bringing up this debate every
two years, you're bringing up the lan
guage of'lsrael is apartheid,' 'lsrael is
a criminal state.' You should instead
focus your message toward Israelis."
Weiner also called on Lee Ross, a
psychology professor, who spoke in
favor of increased dialogue.
"I think one of the things that
tonight illustrates is that all sides are
right," Ross said. "Both sides have a
legitimate position."
According to Chloe English 'l3,
who is in volved with IFP, this is the last
joint event that the two campaigns
will put forth this school year. She said
she was pleased with the debate's abil
ity to "get people talking" and called it
a "productive dialogue." Other stu
dents agreed with the debate's accom
plishments.
"I was impressed that [Kabaker
and Quran] managed to sit and talk to
each other," said David Sabeti 'll. "I
was frustrated that they got stuck in
the ruts of their respective talking
points, but I think that was a little un
avoidable."
