## PEACE, LOVE AND COLUMBAE 
### ANNA FRENCH STAFF WRITER 
On a beautiful weekend afternoon,
Columbae residents are relaxing
and studying in the long-awaited
spring quarter sun, sprawled on
couches and colorfully painted
picnic tables.
Inside, the lounge is in pleasant disarray
and lacks the overly sterile atmosphere of
most other campus common areas. Boxes of
books live alongside student artwork and left
over salad from yesterday's dinner. At mid
night, the smell of freshly baked bread wafts
through the house, and students can be found
sleeping on the roof on hot nights, waking to
the sunrise.
These idyllic conditions generate a cohe
sive community among residents of the veg
etable-eating, library-streaking co-operative
Row house.
"At special dinner we have a talent show
that is beautiful because we have some very
talented people and some very untalented
people, and everyone participates regardless,"
said former resident and current eating associ
ate James Bohnhoff'll. "I feel that this is only
possible because of the strong sense of com
munity."
Columbae residents seem willing to share
even the quirkier aspects of this community
with passersby. Strangers are even free to poke
around the archive of house community jour
nals which have been maintained commu

nally since the house's inception four decades
ago.The journals are stored in the "multi-pur
pose" library, which features a double bunk
bed, a string of star lights and most impor
tantly a locking door.
Columbae was founded on the ideal of
nonviolence a concept its name embodies.
"The name Columbae has its roots in three
different ideas," reads the house website,
"First, it is close to the Latin word for Dove,

tying into the peace-related theme. Second,
David Stillman, and the other founders of
Columbae, thought that Columbae sounded a
bit like 'come on by.' Finally, the name has
something to do with the Woodie Guthrie
song 'Columbia.'"

The house's location has changed many
times. Columbae used to be located in the
Cowell Cluster, and then the community
moved to a different house on the corner of

Campus Drive and Mayfield Avenue. Next,
the house was physically transported to its cur
rent location and sutured together with half of
another house.
But the house's theme "Dedication to
Social Change through Nonviolent Action"
has survived. Another founder, David
Josephson, emphasized the experimental na
ture of Columbae's founding ideals.
"[lt was] an experiment in studying, living

and practicing on a number of approaches to
nonviolence," he told an audience of Colum
bae residents in 1986, according to a transcript
on the Dynamics website. "Right from the
very beginning we had to confront that with
the University."

Stanford's oldest continuously-existing co
operative house (co-op), Columbae has had its
hand in almost every major protest on campus
since its creation. This tradition began in 1969

with the April 3rd Movement (A3M) protest
ing the Vietnam War students and locals
staged a nine-day sit-in in the Stanford Ap
plied Electronics Laboratory demanding an
end to secret military research on campus. The
principal student organizers of this movement
went on to develop the Columbae community
in 1970.

Stanford Workshops on Political and Social
Issues (SWOPSI), a 1970s equivalent of
today's Student Initiated Courses (SICs), had
a constant influence on Columbae activities in
the early years.

"Project Synergy," a 1972 SWOPSI course
on alternative lifestyles that attracted many
Columbae residents, went on to influence the
creation of Columbae's "sister" co-op, Syner
gy. The Stanford Committee for a Responsible
Investment Policy (SCRIP) was another
SWOPSI-inspired project spearheaded by
Columbae residents which documented the
University investments in 1977 and chal
lenged the University to divest from corpora
tions that allegedly bolstered the South
African apartheid.

"Columbae was the heart and soul of that
movement," said former resident Kaky Mc-
Tigue '79 of SCRIP. "The challenges we made
to the trustees the huge sit-in and mass ar
rest [294 student protestors at Old Union on
May 9,1977] happened while the Board was
meeting and [1967-1970 Provost] Dick Lyman
was nearly in tears asking us to call it off."

"It became a naked dancing-on-the
kitchen-counters water fight."
