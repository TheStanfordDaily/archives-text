## Students reflect on custom majors 
### MILES UNTERREINER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Interested in interdisciplinary ap
proaches to solving contemporary
world problems? Love approaching
a complex issue from various angles
all at once? Not sure whether you're
a "fuzzie" or a "techie?"
Then, while most Stanford seniors
look to graduation next month with a
major you've heard of before, you
may find yourself among a smaller
group of students who design their
own.
Kaitlin Halady T1 is pursuing a
major in energy and environmental
design in engineering, a course of
study that incorporates classes from
a variety of disciplines, among them
product design, civil and environ
mental engineering, earth systems
and art.
Halady, who lauded the individu
ally designed major (IDM) program
as "a really unique option that a lot of
people don't know about," is inter
ested in developing sustainable "life
cycle products" with "cradle-to-cra
dle" environmental viability.
"My goal would probably be to
work for some sort of design compa
ny or company that works with life
cycle products," said Halady. This is
an aspiration she felt would be best
realized by the IDM program, in
which she does "not to have to con
form to one department."
Like Halady, Liliana Chan 'll is in
terested in energy, but in a slightly
different way. Chan has crafted her
own major in economics and energy
engineering.
"I wanted to bring an economic
policy perspective along with the
technical side of engineering," said
Chan, who takes courses primarily in
the civil and environmental engi
neering (CEE) and economics de
partments.
With an interest in both econom
ics and engineering, Chan seized the
opportunity to "bring the two togeth
er" rather than "doing just one" con
centration.
"In the beginning, I took a lot
more econ classes," Chan said. "But I
found I really wanted a deeper un
derstanding of the technology side as
well."
With what she described as "a
strong interest in the environment,"
Chan is writing an honors thesis on
the carbon footprint of people's di
etary habits through the Goldman
Interschool Honors Program in En
vironmental Science, Technology
and Policy.
Erica Neville 'l2, who hopes to
major in International Animation,

described her prospective IDM as "a
blend between animation and Japan
ese language and culture."
Neville, who has taken courses in
subjects as diverse as art history,
computer science, film and media
studies and English as part of her
IDM, augments her Stanford course
work with online classes at San Fran
cisco's Academy of Art, which she
said helps her "build a 2-D and 3-D
animation skill set."

"It is also my personal goal to try
and bring in more animation and il-

lustration courses to Stanford,"
added Neville, who enthusiastically
welcomes "the possibility of being
able to unite both animation and
Japanese."
With an interest in food economy,
policy and biology, Julia Feinberg 'll
is majoring in food security a
major that blends economics, earth
systems, history, anthropology, soci
ology, international relations, politi
cal science, public policy and biology.
Feinberg hopes to use this hodge
podge of knowledge to address is
sues of malnutrition and food in
equity.
"I don't like studying anything in
a vacuum," Feinberg said. Though
her core focus is in economics, she
also extolled the benefits of an inter
disciplinary approach to global prob
lems.
"All these things are so intercon
nected I have to know at least a
little about every subject," said Fein
berg, who also remarked that she
"didn't want just an economic or a
geological perspective" on issues of
food security.
"I'd love to work for the State De
partment, or I'd love to do interna
tional policy" said Feinberg. "But I
don't know yet."
Which is why she tackles any
problem from multiple perspectives,
working consistently with Debra
Satz, an adviser from Stanford's Pro
gram in Ethics and Society.
Popular among upperclassmen,
the IDM idea continues to attract in
coming and current freshmen as
well. Stephanie Liou 'l3 is consider

ing an IDM in health promotion,
which she says "would basically in
volve scientific grounding via bio
core, plus some psych, communica
tions, behavioral biology, sociology
and anthropology."
According to the University Reg
istrar, Stanford administrators see
value in a multidisciplinary under
graduate program "for students who
want to pursue an area of scholarly
inquiry outside of established de
partments or programs at the Uni
versity," according to the office's

website.
The School of Engineering offers
its own version of interdisciplinary
study, Individually Designed Majors
in Engineering (IDMENs), which
aims to "provide students with an un
derstanding of engineering princi
ples and the analytical and problem
solving, design, and communication
skills necessary to be successful in
the field."
Electrical engineering professor
and Senior Associate Dean for Stu
dent Affairs Brad Osgood said Stan
ford's IDMEN program was, to his
knowledge, unique.
"Not many other schools have
this option," Osgood said. Despite
what he termed "a pretty high bar to
get one of these things approved,"
and the low number of engineering
students who end up choosing the
IDMEN program (usually between
three and five), Osgood called it "a
great option" for those looking for
flexibility.
He did, however, offer a word of
caution to students interested in an
IDMEN you'll be largely on your
own.
"If you choose an IDM, you're a
cohort of one," said Osgood, who
added that many students who ini
tially think an IDM is right for them
end up choosing a standard major in
stead.
Among Stanford's most unique
offerings, the IDM/IDMEN gradu
ates around 15 students per year.
