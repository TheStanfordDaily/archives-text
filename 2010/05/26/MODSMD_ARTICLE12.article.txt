## GET IT RIGHT Poetry Time 
### Erica Morgan 
I have written a bit of slightly hokey poetry
once per quarter and thought it fitting
that I maintain the tradition for my final
piece. To fans and foes alike: thank you for
reading, and I'm glad I made an impression.
Ode to Conservative Conjectures
Alas: the final column now for this year's
episode,
Tlie last of redneck wisdom, which upon you
I've bestowed.
How bittersweet this moment as I earnestly
compose
A farewell piece of poetry, transcending stan
dard prose.
I'd like to use the space allowed to pause and
to review
The scrutiny, antipathy, which right-wingers
accrue.
Follow for a few more lines; I hope that you'll
agree,
I don't elicit pity but decry hypocrisy.
Diversity - the rally shout of any Stanford
fan!
With winsome words we woo the world and
welcome all we can.
The liberal arts promote a sage acceptance of
all kinds,
To foster academia and openness of minds.
Such irony, I must admit, for I don't think I've
seen
A group of people more inclined to judge, de
grade, demean.
For two years I demurred and thus deferred
to liberal verve,
Until my choice to give a voice to viewpoints
underserved.
Conservatives I thank you, for your praise
and for support.
You read, you reinforce, you recommend and
you exhort.
Your criticisms help me hone and frame my
arguments.
Your feedback helps to balance out the un
kind malcontents.
Liberals I thank you as well, for all your var
ied views.

Some give cause for me to pause and change
my attitude.
Others bait and denigrate with foully flap-

pmgjaws,
And what you do is vindicate the value of my
cause.
I am in no way bitter, nor the least bit belli
cose,
I love to bandy banter, and love politics the
most.
So thanks again for reading, and if ever
you're inclined,
I'll be nearby to quick supply a right-wing
frame of mind.
Love, Erica
P.S.
As we embark on finals I've a scheme to rec
ommend.
This one will be popular for every liberal
friend.
It's generous and giving, and it fits progres
sive mold,
In fact, if you reject it, you are heartless and
you're cold.
The idea here is simple, we'll create a public
pool
Of grade points that surpass the grade point
limit set by rule.
This fund of "unfair earnings" we'll distribute
with good will
To low performing students and thus grade
point void we'll fill.
So welcome to the real world, if the liberals
have their way
The harder that you work my friends, the
more you'll have to pay.
Erica has enjoyed herself immensely in the
conservative columnist capacity. Thanks for
reading. Final thoughts? Emorganl@stan
