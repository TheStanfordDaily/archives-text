## A
						two-state solution 
### JONATHAN LASERSON PhD candidate in Computer Science, Former president of the Israeli Student Organization 
Yesterday I attended a debate between
Yishai Kabakar and Fadi Quran. Quran
wants us to divest from Israel. He accused Is
rael in preventing the Palestinians from get
ting their state. Think about this for a minute.
It doesn't make sense.

I am an Israeli Zionist. As such my goal is
to live in a state with a Jewish majority, be
cause my belief is that this is the only state
that will give security to the Jewish people. I
know that the only way to achieve this is
through a two-state solution. Therefore, an
independent Palestinian state, living side by
side with a Jewish state, is a Zionist impera
tive. Why would Israel sign its own death
warrant by refusing to accept a Palestinian
state?

Think also about this: Hamas has been
constantly firing rockets from Gaza. It start
ed firing right after Israel withdrew from
Gaza, before the blockades and the sanc
tions. What did it gain from it?
The reason these things don't make sense,
is that the paradigm that "the Palestinians
are trying to get a state while Israel is trying
to prevent it" is out-dated. In the last 20
years, the Palestinians had called our bluff.
The correct paradigm has the roles reversed.
It is Israel who desperately needs a Palestin
ian state to keep the Jewish state alive. If only
the Palestinians wait a bit longer, some of
them say, the world will force upon Israel the
one-state solution. So why hurry?
Looking at the conflict through this updat-

Ed paradigm, it suddenly all makes sense.
When former Israeli PM Olmert was about to
withdraw from most of the West-Bank in 2006
("the realignment plan", he called it), Hamas,
a Palestinian organization who publicly de
clares it wants a one-state solution, had to stop
him. That is why it launched those rockets
onto Israeli cities - to get that plan off the
table. To maintain the occupation alive. And it
succeeded. No politician would dismantle Is
raeli settlements under a rain of rockets.

If I had thought, like Quran, that Israel
did not want a Palestinian state, I would have
surely agreed with him that we should put
more pressure on Israel to change its ways.
But this is not the case. The current round is
stuck because so far Hamas has been able to
block every possible progress between Israel
and the PLO. How will Quran's divestment
plan help us overcome Hamas? It won't. To
the contrary, it provides ammo to the one
state supporters. I much prefer Kabaker's
counter proposal - an investment campaign.
If we choose to invest in a Palestinian state
building, if we make it clear to the world that
the two-state solution is the only fair and vi
able solution to this conflict, if we get the
one-state solution off the table, only then do
we resolve the conflict.
Sincerely,
