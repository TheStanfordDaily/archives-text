## Lies, Damn Lies, and Statistics 
### Jack Cackler 
Summary: Jack Cackler explores the idea, to
paraphrase Uncle Ben Parker, that with great
statistical power comes great responsibility
(and minimal Type II error).

Mark Twain, the 100 th anniversary of
whose death transpired just last
month, was never known to be soft
spoken about his opinions. He popularized
the phrase, "There are three kinds of lies: lies,
damned lies, and statistics," caustically opin
ing the view that numbers can be used to dis
semble truth. While Twain's classic snarki
ness may elicit frustrated delight from Stats
60 students everywhere, his story is only half
formed. As statistics can be a tool for ill-in
tentioned academics to perpetuate false
hoods, a society well educated in statistics is
the best defense against this kind of intellec
tual trickery.Today we'll look at a recent case
in which statistics were not used honestly,
and how to guard against them in the future.
HIV is the definitive cause of AIDS,
which kills over 3 million people every year
worldwide. This fact has been replicated by
studies over and over, and, thanks to scientif
ic research, antiretroviral treatment can now
extend life in HIV-positive patients by
decades. One of the most vocal scientists dis
agreeing with this claim has been Peter
Duesberg, who was once a bright young can
cer researcher at UC-Berkeley (I would jibe
the Golden Bear, but what follows is too
grave). Duesberg published non peer-re
viewed articles throughout the 1980s and '9os
expressing doubt that HIV caused AIDS,
and ultimately secured publication in the
Journal of Bioscience in 2003 claiming that
AIDS was a chemical problem caused by
recreational drugs, and HIV was merely a
common passenger virus. His paper has sev
eral glaring problems that can appear in
nocuous at face value. For one of his main de
fenses, he cites a handful of case studies in
which people with HIV did not develop
AIDS, and attempts to use these cases to
counterbalance the millions of cases a year in
which people do. By cherry picking a few
cases, Duesberg attempts to sow doubt by
implying that a few cases in his favor should
be valued equally to the millions of cases to
the contrary. Another dastardly maneuver
Duesberg uses is to analyze a correlation be
tween AIDS patients and drug users, and for
mulate the conclusion that drug use causes

AIDS. Presenting a causal link from simple
correlations is another trick that can be used
to imply a conclusion that simply isn't true.
While Duesberg's "research" was quickly
dismantled, he was cited by South African
President Thabo Mbeki for scientific proof
that HIV did not cause AIDS, which caused
an enormous national delay in testing for
HIV and distributing antiretrovirals. Mbeki's
successor, Kgalema Motlanthe, was largely
elected on the platform of addressing
HIV/AIDS, and while the situation is im
proving, South Africa now has more of its cit
izens die annually from AIDS than any other
country. With lives on the line, it makes no
difference whether AIDS denialists' faulty
science resulted from incompetence or mal
ice. Berkeley is currently investigating Dues
berg for academic misconduct for dissem
bling information and not disclosing conflict
of interest. It is imperative to scrutinize every
aspect of any data you are presented with:
who funded it, how big the sample size was,
whether they are analyzing all information

and if they are using valid statistical methods.
Only then should you accept it as fact, and a
strong background in statistics will greatly
help you in this pursuit.
In addition to debunking faulty research,
statistics can also do a tremendous amount of
good in the world, and Stanford has been the
global leader in statistical research for at least
the last half century. The bootstrap resam
pling method developed by Brad Efron has
allowed unprecedented predictive power and
statistical inference, particularly in the grow
ing field of biocomputation and statistical ge
netics. The Classification And Regression
Trees algorithm developed largely at Stan
ford by Breiman, Friedman, Olshen and
Stone provided a foundation for modern
computational algorithms. David Siegmund's
change-point research gave clinical re
searchers the tools to determine whether
overwhelming evidence early in a trial could
be sufficient to end the trial early, and has
thus saved many lives. The other contribu
tions from Stanford to the field of statistics
are truly too numerous to list, but rest assured
that if you are looking for a place to learn
more about the field, you're in the right place.
A century onward, perhaps Mark Twain's
adage is half correct; that statistics can be
used by ne'er-do-wells, but they are also the
last line of defense against lies and damned
lies. The sentiment that numbers can't lie is
simply misguided, and the mathematical
knowhow to distinguish when someone is
trying to lie to you with numbers is as much if
not more important as the intellectual
knowhow to distinguish when someone is
lying to you with words. Scrutinize every
number, every figure and every error bar as
closely as you would a word, a claim or a
statement. When used properly, statistical
analysis is the best resource we have to win
now truth from uncertainty through the sci
entific method. In the coming decades, each
of you will have the power to change the
world in your field, and I can only hope that
you use the power of statistics for good and
for truth. For the few of you who don't, the
rest of us will be watching.

If you still don't think you need a firm grasp on
statistics to be an informed citizen, Jack has a
fence for you to whitewash. You can send a
check for the privilege to cackler@stanford.

In the coming decades, each
of you will have the power to
change the world in your
field, and I can only hope that
you use the power of statistics
for good and truth.
