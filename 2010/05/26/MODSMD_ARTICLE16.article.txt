## NCAA must stick up for athletes 
### Mike Lazarus 
Odds are Mallory Bur
dette didn't feel any pain
as big sister Lindsay
body slammed her onto
the concrete surface at
the University of Georgia's Dan Magill
Tennis Complex.
She probably could have jumped out
of a moving car and still popped up smil
ing.
The freshman had just won a
marathon three-setter in the champi
onship match of the N CAA Tournament
to give Stanford the title. Seconds after
Florida's Marrit Boonstra's shot sailed
wide on match point, teammate and sister
Lindsay sprinted onto the court heading
straight for Mallory.
When Lindsay got there, she didn't
stop.
Like a blitzing linebacker coming
from the quarterback's blindside, Lind
say went full steam into an arms-raised
Mallory, bringing them both down to the
ground. In what will go down as one of
the more memorable dogpiles in NCAA
history (at one point seven Cardinal play
ers were stacked on one another), Lind
say's open-field tackle was the clincher.
Every NCAA promotional video
should have the clip of the Burdette
Bruising. Not simply for the comedic
value (of which there is plenty), but as an
example of what the NCAA is supposed
to represent competition, excitement,
passion.

Unfortunately, the NCAA has
demonstrated that those are not the val
ues it stands for. The NCAA's most recent
stab-in-the-back to its players was filing
an amicus brief in support of the NFL in
its antitrust case.
For those that haven't been following
the legal predicaments of the No Fun
League, here's a quick recap: American
Needle, a former producer of NFL mer
chandise, sued the NFL when the league
signed an exclusive deal with Reebok, cit
ing the arrangement as a violation of an
titrust laws.
The NFL, arguing that it is a single en
tity rather than 32 separate teams, hoped
the Supreme Court would grant it an an
titrust exemption much like the one
Major League Baseball enjoys. The
Court didn't buy it, ruling 9-0 against the
NFL.
If the Court had sided with the NFL,
the league would practically be able to set
salaries and free agency conditions in its
favor, severely harming the players. For
obvious reasons, the NBA and NHL filed
briefs in support of the NFL, hoping that
the Court might one day grant them an
titrust exemptions.
The NCAA is not the NBA or NHL.
Professional sports leagues are profit
maximizing organizations where the
owner's sole goal is to make money. Own
ers do not need to feel sympathy for their
players, and when presented with a
chance to fatten their wallets, they should
feel no shame in taking it.
The NCAA is supposed to care about
its athletes, though. Sure, it can turn a
profit, but ultimately the intent of the
NCAA is to provide the best possible en
vironment for student-athletes to play
the game they love. In short, the NCAA
should help its players.
And that 's how we end up back at the
NCAA's amicus brief. Today's collegiate
athletes will be tomorrow's professional
athletes. When they go pro, they are going
to sign a contract. The amount that con
tract is worth depends on whether that
league has an antitrust exemption or not.
The NCAA did everything it could to
make that contract as small as possible.
For what? So it can sign a deal making
Nike the exclusive apparel provider of
athletic programs across the nation? A
few more digits in its bank account? Is
that really worth sacrificing the livelihood
of the student-athletes who work for free
to earn the NCAA a little more cash?
By filing the brief the NCAA sent a
clear message: It cares more about its
profits than its players, more about riches
than responsibility. Maybe Lindsay Bur
dette could body slam a few NCAA exec
utives and knock some sense into them.
Mike Lazarus thinks a good old-fash
ioned body slam can solve any problem.
