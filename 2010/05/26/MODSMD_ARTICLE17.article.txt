# A
						guide to the 2010 FIFA World Cup

They're almost here in just a couple of
weeks all that hard work will be put to
the test. I'm talking about finals.
The 2010 FIFA World Cup Finals.
So to help you get through this difficult time, I
present my ill-thought-out, and almost certainly
biased, study guide of what is about to kick off on
June 11 in Johannesburg, South Africa.
Favorites:
A quick search of the Internet will throw up a
handful of names that will be fighting among
themselves for the big prize in July. The top two are
probably Brazil and Spain, with Argentina and
England close behind.
Given its hugely successful history, having won
the title five times and as the only team to have
qualified for every World Cup, anyone would be a
fool to bet against Brazil. Real fan favorites across
the globe, they play an exciting game with almost
everyone on the pitch seemingly attacking the
goal.
Spain, meanwhile, is the current European
champion and a few months back would probably

have been clearly at the top of the pile. Since then,
injuries have taken a serious toll on the star play
ers on the team, and it remains to be seen whether
or not they will make it back in time and if, when
they do return, they will be fully fit.
It is easy to think Argentina should be a power
ful force this summer with the current FIFA World
Player of the Year, Lionel Messi, in its ranks and
one of the best ever players, Diego Maradona, as
its coach. But Maradona is an enigma, and has a
proven record of going from hero to zero, or vice
versa, in a heartbeat. Just ask any England fan
about his two goals against us in 'B6.
That England are touted to be among the top
teams this year should probably make me happy,
and it is certainly true that under the iron-fisted
rule of our (Italian) manager, we have had some
great performances. But it is hard not to have seri
ous doubts about which side will really show up.
Time and again England have failed to relive the
glory of our single triumph in 1966, and Monday's
warm-up game against Mexico did nothing to light
any fires.
Team USA:
After a stunning victory over European cham
pions Spain in last year's Confederations Cup in
South Africa, could this be the year that Team
USA makes waves not just abroad, but at home
too?

A lack of a global superstar among its ranks,
and some serious injuries that have taken a chunk
out of the squad, mean it is incredibly unlikely it
could go all the way, but what if by some freakish
accident the USA won the World Cup this year?
To be really blunt, a lot of people, myself included,
would be absolutely horrified.
Before someone goes and throws me and my
tea into the ocean, I better make it clear that this
is no anti-American sentiment. I would love it if
the USA really took football to heart and be
came a serious force in the sport. But right now
the country just doesn't care enough. Any other
country would go crazy if they won the cup. Here,
I'm not even convinced everyone would even no
tice.
Home Sweet Home:
The host country for this World Cup might be
South Africa, but this is Africa's tournament.
Whether or not you have a home nation to sup
port, go adopt a second team from any of South
Africa, Nigeria, Algeria, Ghana, Cameroon or
Cote d'lvoire (Ivory Coast).
Home nations have traditionally had great
success, the tournament having been won six
times previously by its host, and anyone who fol
lowed South Korea's run to the semifinals as joint
hosts back in 2002 should know that, with a bit of
luck and with the whole crowd behind you, any-

thing is |
possible.
Should
any of the
African nations
walk away with the
crown, or even make a run to
the final, don't expect the party
to stop for a long, long time. So
reawaken your evolutionary

roots and grab your own slice of
what could be a wild ride.
Heroes and Villains:
French midfielder Zinedine Zidane ended his
career by headbutting his Italian counterpart,
Marco Materazzi, in the final in 2006. In a moment
of insanity he reacted to verbal insults by the Ital
ian and, however offensive Materazzi's taunts may
have been, was rightly shown a red card. The tour
nament's best player walked off as a villain and will
be forever remembered for that.
There will certainly be other contenders, but
ahead of this year's World Cup, another French
player has already staked his claim on Zidane's
crown. Thierry Flenry destroyed his own reputa
tion and made a lot of enemies in Ireland with a
blatant hand-ball that secured France their place
