## A
						row over Row housing ResEd mix-up means some staff won't actually get singles 
### CASSANDRA FELICIANO STAFF WRITER 
Some Row house staffers are out in
force this week after getting assigned to
"standard" rooms rather than the "pre
mium" singles or two-room doubles they
believed they were guaranteed when
they signed up to run the houses, kitchens
and social events of Mayfield Avenue.
As in-house draws got underway this
week, staff and residents learned that
some residents were assigned premium
rooms they thought were set aside for
staff. Executive Director of Student
Housing Rodger Whitney said the confu

issue," but rather involved Residential
Education (ResEd).
Nate Boswell, an associate dean in
ResEd, offered an explanation in an e
mail to The Daily on Tuesday.
"Residential Education is tasked with
assigning room types for its student staff
members," Boswell said. "The issue you
refer to is that some Row staff members
were incorrectly allocated standard
rooms instead of premium rooms prior to
the running of the draw. In trying to nav
igate the changes to the Draw this year
specifically assigning staff members to
room type rather than just to a residences
as in years past Residential Education
failed to catch the mistake,"
"Consequently the draw was run and
students who were placed in Row houses
received premium room assignments in
place of some staff members," Boswell
continued. "The mistake was only no
ticed after the results of the housing
Draw were made available."
He said ResEd is working "on a
house-by-house basis" to solve the mix
up.
Dean of Residential Education Debo
rah Golder and ResEd Assistant Direc

for comment.
Meanwhile, student staffers in Row
houses were vocal in their reactions on
Tuesday.
