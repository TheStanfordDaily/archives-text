## A 						row over Row housing ResEd mix-up means some staff won't actually get singles 
### CASSANDRA FELICIANO STAFF WRITER 
Some Row house staffers are out in
force this week after getting assigned to
"standard" rooms rather than the "pre
mium" singles or two-room doubles they
believed they were guaranteed when
they signed up to run the houses, kitchens
and social events of Mayfield Avenue.
As in-house draws got underway this
week, staff and residents learned that
some residents were assigned premium
rooms they thought were set aside for
staff. Executive Director of Student
Housing Rodger Whitney said the confu
sion was "not a housing assignments
issue," but rather involved Residential
Education (ResEd).
Nate Boswell, an associate dean in
ResEd, offered an explanation in an e
mail to The Daily on Tuesday.
"Residential Education is tasked with
assigning room types for its student staff
members," Boswell said. "The issue you
refer to is that some Row staff members
were incorrectly allocated standard
rooms instead of premium rooms prior to
the running of the draw. In trying to nav
igate the changes to the Draw this year
specifically assigning staff members to
room type rather than just to a residences
as in years past Residential Education
failed to catch the mistake,"
"Consequently the draw was run and
students who were placed in Row houses
received premium room assignments in
place of some staff members," Boswell
continued. "The mistake was only no
ticed after the results of the housing
Draw were made available."
He said ResEd is working "on a
house-by-house basis" to solve the mix
up.
Dean of Residential Education Debo
rah Golder and ResEd Assistant Direc
tor Zac Sargeant did not return requests
for comment.
Meanwhile, student staffers in Row
houses were vocal in their reactions on
Tuesday.
Some students, like Grove House
community manager (CM) Taylor Thi-
bodeaux 'll, assumed that although
only master key-carrying staff mem
bersâ€” residential assistants (RAs)
and CMs were guaranteed singles,
those staff who did not hold master
keys would still get priority over resi
dents in room selection.
Other incoming Row house staff
said they were surprised and disap
pointed to find there is no official
written policy that guarantees a staff
member premium room assignments.
"I'm mostly just bothered that
Housing doesn't consider staff resi
dents," Thibodeaux said. "They say
that residents have protection be
cause of the Draw, but staff mem
bers who actually work and make
money and do things for their hous
es don't have the same protection
that residents do. We don't have
room security."
Many staff members are frustrat
ed at Housing's lack of response to
their complaints. Others don't know
where to direct their grievances.
"I don't even know who the per
son to complain to is," said Maya
Perelman 'll, Grove's incoming
kitchen manager (KM), who would
not have considered staffing without
what she thought was a guaranteed
single.
Staff members in the nine Row
houses reported to be affected by the
confusion are working to alleviate the
situation in a number of ways. For in
stance, CMs received e-mails about
writing formal letters to Housing that
reflect how the confusion is affecting
the Row houses and request that they
change premium room assignments
to standard ones.
Similarly, Samuel Cohen-Tanugi
'l2, next year's academic theme as
sociate (ATA) at French House,
plans to draft a request for compen
sation via guaranteed tier one prior
ity in the Draw his senior year or an

increase in pay.
Another option is to turn to those
residents who had priority in the
housing lottery and were assigned
singles an alternative that staff
members are resorting to because
they feel their frustrations are being
ignored by administrators.
"Pretty much the only way to do it
is to ask the residents that draw into
the house if they'd be okay with not
accepting a single, which is probably
unlikely," Perelman said.
Cohen-Tanugi, who is the only one
affected in his house, as all other staff
members in French House have the
room assignments they wanted, took
a less direct approach and already
contacted the student who drew into
the house with a premium assign
ment.

Thibodeaux is worried that the
ramifications of this issue will affect
community atmosphere at Grove.
"I'm community manager and I'm
supposed to be in charge of my com
munity," she said. "But it's going to be
animosity right away. In the house
people are not getting rooms they ex
pected. It's just very upsetting and I
wish that Housing would do some
thing more than just saying 'just deal
with it.'"
Boswell added that ResEd is "ex
tremely distressed at the hardship this
error has placed on its student staff
members and can only ask for flexi
bility and understanding from its af

fected staff as we parse through solu
tions."
He noted that the ResEd office is
looking at several potential ways to
address the issue, but that those solu
tions would have to wait to be coordi
nated both through Housing and his
office before being implemented.
