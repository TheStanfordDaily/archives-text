# 2010 NCAA WOMEN'S TENNIS CHAMPIONS
## SWEET 16TH CARD BEATS FLORIDA 4-3, CLAIMS 16TH NCAA CHAMPIONSHIP 
### WILLSEATON STAFF WRITER 
A senior's long fight for her team came
to a fruitful end as Lindsay Burdette was
able to lead the No. 8 Stanford women's
tennis team to its first NCAA champi
onship in four years and the program's
16th NCAA championship with a nail
biting defeat of No. 3 Florida 4-3 in the
championship match.
"It was really scary out there," Lindsay
Burdette said. "I stayed on [sister] Mallo

ry's court and she fought so hard. I was try
ing to be that calming force for her, but it
was really tough for me to stay calm. We
came so far, we laid it out there, and I'm so
proud of what we've accomplished."
For the second time in as many days and
only the third time all year, Stanford
dropped the doubles point after spirited
play from the Gators. Mallory Burdette
and Stacey Tan were first off with a demor
alizing 8-1 defeat. Stanford was able to tie it
with strong play from its No. 1 team of Hi
lary Barte and Lindsay Burdette, recording

an 8-4 victory. On court three, Stanford's
Carolyn McVeigh and Veronica Li were
leading 5-4 before being broken. The Car
dinal dropped the final two games to give
Florida the 1-0 lead going into singles play.
"They came out very strong in doubles,"
said head coach Lele Forood. "They played
better than we did in the doubles, but in the
singles, we came out well in five spots. They
clawed their way back though and that's
what they do. They're all about battling and
staying in it and doing what it takes."
Stanford did indeed start well in the sin

gles. The Card managed to win the first set
in five out of the six matches. Tan ran away
with her match, heading out to a 3-1 lead in
the second set before closing out and earn
ing Stanford's first point 6-2,6-2. Li proved
her resiliency again by coming back from
3-0 down in the first set to win her match 6-
3,7-5.

But it proved to be the Burdette sisters
that pushed Stanford through. Senior

UNDERDOG STORY: The Stanford women's tennis team was the number eight seed in the NCAA team championships, but defeated three higher-seeded teams en route to its first
championship in four years. The Cardinal came from behind to beat No. 3 Florida yesterday in the national championships, winning four games to three.
after breaking out of a 3-3 tie to
run away with her match, 6-3,6-3.
After being forced to a third set,
Mallory Burdette started well too.
She raced out to a 2-0 lead, but
was broken right back and found
herself down 3-2. Mallory broke
again to go ahead 4-3, but her op
ponent, No. 65 Marrit Boonstra,
broke back. Mallory found her
self in a 5-4 hole and struggling to
stay in the match. She fought for
the final break and then raced out
to a 40-0 lead on her serve before
finally serving it out.
"I was beyond nervous," Mal
lory Burdette said. "The girl was
playing really well, especially
there in the middle of the third
set. The biggest thing at the end
was that I couldn't be afraid to
lose. I tried to focus on myself,
move forward and stop worrying
about losing."
After the final point, her rack
et went in the air and older sister
Lindsay was the first one there,
tackling Mallory with the rest of
the Stanford team in celebration
of an NCAA championship.
"Coming here to Stanford, I
wanted the championship more
for Lindsay than I did for myself,"
Mallory Burdette said. "She's
worked so hard, done so much for
the team, and just come up short
the past three years. She played
unbelievable today though. She
had done her part and I knew it
was time to do mine."
Forood has been there with
Lindsay through the entire ride
and was amazed at the depths to
which she was able to reach in her
final few college matches to pull
out some of the best performanc
es of her career.
"She's been such a consistent
performer for four years," Forood
said. "Her singles has had some
real ups and downs, which she'll
be the first to admit, but the point
is she played her best at the end.
And boy, doesn't everybody in
their athletic career want to make
that statement. The fact that she
was able to will herself to play her
best tennis here, it's unbelievable
to me."

So the Cardinal heads into the
singles and doubles tournament
with the NCAA team crown for
the first time in Lindsay Bur
dette's Stanford career. Her hard
work and dedication have paid
off in the most deserving way, but
a championship title isn't all she'll
take from her time with the team.

"Singing together in the lock
er room," Lindsay Burdette
said," before we even went out
there today. We were singing our
team songs, hanging out, getting
ready and getting our grips on,
our shoes on, tennis strings all
over the place. That was probably
my favorite memory. I couldn't
think of any better way to pre
pare for a national championship
match."
