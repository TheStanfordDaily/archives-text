# 2010 NCAA WOMEN'S TENNIS CHAMPIONS
## SWEET 16TH CARD BEATS FLORIDA 4-3, CLAIMS 16TH NCAA CHAMPIONSHIP 
### WILLSEATON STAFF WRITER 
A senior's long fight for her team came
to a fruitful end as Lindsay Burdette was
able to lead the No. 8 Stanford women's
tennis team to its first NCAA champi
onship in four years and the program's
16th NCAA championship with a nail
biting defeat of No. 3 Florida 4-3 in the
championship match.
"It was really scary out there," Lindsay
Burdette said. "I stayed on [sister] Mallo

ry's court and she fought so hard. I was try
ing to be that calming force for her, but it
was really tough for me to stay calm. We
came so far, we laid it out there, and I'm so
proud of what we've accomplished."
For the second time in as many days and
only the third time all year, Stanford
dropped the doubles point after spirited
play from the Gators. Mallory Burdette
and Stacey Tan were first off with a demor
alizing 8-1 defeat. Stanford was able to tie it
with strong play from its No. 1 team of Hi
lary Barte and Lindsay Burdette, recording

an 8-4 victory. On court three, Stanford's
Carolyn McVeigh and Veronica Li were
leading 5-4 before being broken. The Car
dinal dropped the final two games to give
Florida the 1-0 lead going into singles play.
"They came out very strong in doubles,"
said head coach Lele Forood. "They played
better than we did in the doubles, but in the
singles, we came out well in five spots. They
clawed their way back though and that's
what they do. They're all about battling and
staying in it and doing what it takes."
Stanford did indeed start well in the sin

gles. The Card managed to win the first set
in five out of the six matches. Tan ran away
with her match, heading out to a 3-1 lead in
the second set before closing out and earn
ing Stanford's first point 6-2,6-2. Li proved
her resiliency again by coming back from
3-0 down in the first set to win her match 6-
3,7-5.

But it proved to be the Burdette sisters
that pushed Stanford through. Senior
Lindsay Burdette was second off the court
