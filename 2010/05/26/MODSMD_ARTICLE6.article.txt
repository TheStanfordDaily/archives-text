## Habitat conservation plan meets the public 
### ADAM COLE STAFF WRITER 
The California red-legged frog, bile
brown and warty, is not an attractive crea
ture. But soon even it might be getting some
love.
On Tuesday night in Tresidder's Oak
Room, representatives from the National
Marine Fisheries Service (NWFS), the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) and
Stanford's own Department of Land Use
and Environmental Planning presented a
Habitat Conservation Plan to a group of
about 50 community members. The three
agencies believe the plan, which may be ap
proved in the coming months, will help pro
tect animal species that call Stanford land
their home.
"Our purpose is to develop a plan for the
Stanford campus that minimizes [environ
mental] impact to the greatest extent possi
ble and mitigates the impact that cannot be
avoided," said Gary Stern, a fish biologist
with NWFS.
"One of the more difficult parts was win
nowing down the list of species to focus on,"
said Charles Carter, director of Land Use
and Environmental Planning at Stanford.
"We heard about crickets and all kinds of
lizards, and we had to decide which were
most important and which were most en
dangered by Stanford's activities."
Five species made the final cut. Four of
them the California tiger salamander,
the California red-legged frog, the San Fran
cisco garter snake and the steelhead trout
are currently listed under the Endan
gered Species Act as threatened or endan
gered. The Western pond turtle is not listed,
but in recent decades its population has
dwindled.
If approved, the Habitat Conservation

Plan (HCP) would cost Stanford about half
a million dollars per year. It calls for restora
tion projects in the foothills above Stanford,
the removal of fish barriers from local
creeks and the permanent commitment of
about 360 acres to conservation.
"To me, these conservation easements
are the key," said Carter.
He believes that having the land set aside
for perpetuity will open the door to further
environmental efforts, like those his depart
ment has already tackled.
One of these conservation projects con
cerns developing breeding grounds for the
infamous California tiger salamander. The
salamander's historic breeding grounds in
Lake Lagunita are surrounded by develop
ment and across a dangerous highway from
the rest of their range. In the last decade,
University conservationists have begun to
construct alternative breeding pools for the
salamander near the Dish walking paths.
The HCP would expand this program
and continue to monitor salamander popu
lations. Much of this surveillance work falls
to Stanford conservation biologist Alan
Launer and the students who work with
him.
Alison Royer 'lO has worked with the
salamanders and Launer ever since she took
his conservation biology class.
"I'm a creek monkey," said Royer. "It's
the best job ever wading up and down the
creek, just listening for plops."
Royer attended last night's HCP public
hearing and after the presentation mingled
with the attendees, many of whom were in
strumental in its composition.
The conservation plan has been in the
works for nearly two decades, but it was only
in the past two years that the necessary En-

vironmental Impact Statements
were drafted. Complying with the
National Environmental Policy Act,
Stanford worked with agents from
the USFWS and the NWFS to evalu
ate everything from geologic haz
ards to cultural resources associated
with the proposed plan.
Catherine Palter, the associate di
rector of the Department of Land
Use and Environmental Planning,
said collaborating with federal
agents was time consuming, but ulti
mately beneficial.
"Working with them, we came up
with a better conservation pro
gram," she said.
Stanford hopes to save time in the
long run by addressing the many in
dividual projects and concerns in a
single plan.
"Project by project is not the way
to go," explained Launer. "It just
takes too long."
Many people at the hearing ex
pressed their excitement that the

HCP was moving forward, while at
the same time expressing some con
cerns about specific details.
"I would have liked to seen an
even bigger emphasis on restora
tion," said Philippe Cohen, the ad
ministrative director of Jasper Ridge
Biological Preserve at Stanford, who
served on the plan's scoping and
consulting team.
"I wish they would minimize
maintenance," added Royer. "They
mow way more than they need to. I
see foxes, rabbits, snakes up there,
but after they mow they're all gone."
Stern says the HCP's framers are
currently collecting written com
ments and concerns like these.
"If they are beneficial to the
species and within Stanford's mean,
we will work with the University to
make them happen," he said.
Ultimately, the final HCP will
represent a complex compromise
between multiple parties.
"It's a contentious process," said
Cohen. "Still, if there is no HCP,
everyone loses the species, Stan
ford, the students and staff."
