The current draft of the Habitat Conserva
tion Plan (HCP) covers many of the Universi
ty's current activities and several new activities
at Searsville Dam, but the agreement makes
no clear commitments to dealing with long
term changes to the controversial structure.
The University uses water from Searsville
Lake, too rich in tannins and organic matter to
drink, to irrigate the Stanford Golf Course and
the landscaping and athletic facilities on the
campus. Of the species covered by the HCP,
Searsville Dam most strongly affects steelhead
trout, which historically migrated to and from
to ocean to spawn in the rivers above the dam.

Among the more routine activities covered
by the HCP are continued water diversion
from the reservoir for irrigation and fire pro
tection, general dam cleaning and mainte
nance, and the continuation of all current
Jasper Ridge research activities.
As for new activities, the HCP includes a
commitment to spend $lOO,OOO in the next 10
years on a study that will look into the feasibil
ity of creating a fish passage at the dam for
steelhead trout.
The agreement also covers maintenance
dredging in Searsville Lake in order to extend
the reservoir's capacity and regain the 250
