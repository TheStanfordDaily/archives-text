# Plan proposes Searsville dredging; no removal yet
## 
### NICHOLAS WENNER 
The current draft of the Habitat Conserva
tion Plan (HCP) covers many of the Universi
ty's current activities and several new activities
at Searsville Dam, but the agreement makes
no clear commitments to dealing with long
term changes to the controversial structure.
The University uses water from Searsville
Lake, too rich in tannins and organic matter to
drink, to irrigate the Stanford Golf Course and
the landscaping and athletic facilities on the
campus. Of the species covered by the HCP,
Searsville Dam most strongly affects steelhead
trout, which historically migrated to and from
to ocean to spawn in the rivers above the dam.

Among the more routine activities covered
by the HCP are continued water diversion
from the reservoir for irrigation and fire pro
tection, general dam cleaning and mainte
nance, and the continuation of all current
Jasper Ridge research activities.
As for new activities, the HCP includes a
commitment to spend $lOO,OOO in the next 10
years on a study that will look into the feasibil
ity of creating a fish passage at the dam for
steelhead trout.
The agreement also covers maintenance
dredging in Searsville Lake in order to extend
the reservoir's capacity and regain the 250

acre-feet of storage the reservoir
provided in 2000. The reservoir's
original capacity was 1,000 acre-feet,
and its current capacity is approxi
mately 175 acre-feet.
Beyond these activities, the HCP
makes no specific proposals or plans
for dealing with large-scale changes
to Searsville in the future.

Catherine Palter, the project
manager for the plan, argues that the
question of removing or modifying
Searsville Dam is currently too un
certain and risk-laden to be ad
dressed in the HCP. In order to en
sure coverage for the maintenance
and minor activities the University
already undertakes at the dam, the
writers of the HCP "really took a sta
tus quo approach," said Palter.
Matt Stoecker, a vocal advocate
for dam removal and the director of
the non-profit group Beyond
Searsville Dam, said what is being
proposed is "basically stalling out on

addressing the dam for quite a long
time." Even with the fish passage
study, Stoecker said, Stanford's pro
posed plan is "unclear and unspecific
and doesn't seem to commit them to
much."
Stoecker would much rather see a
dam removal feasibility study in the
HCP than the fish passage study that
has been proposed, and he and his
supporters hope to put steps toward
dismantling the dam into the HCP.
Due to sediment run-off from the
naturally erosive hills above the dam,
Searsville Lake has lost nearly 90
percent of its original storage capaci
ty, and the next big erosion event
could completely fill the reservoir
with sediment.
All parties involved agree that
Stanford is going to have to do some
thing about the dam and reservoir,
and Jasper Ridge Director Philippe
Cohen noted that "the only option
not on the table is the status quo ...
even if you want to keep the way
things are, you have to do some
thing."
