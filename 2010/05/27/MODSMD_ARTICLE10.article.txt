## Ike's move-in date nears 
### BRIANNA PANG STAFF WRITER 
Watch out, Subway. A new sand
wich shop is coming to campus.
Ike's Place, currently a popular,
small eatery started in San Francisco's
Castro district, plans to open up shop
in Stanford's Science and Engineering
Quad II in mid-August.
Ike's Place was chosen along a
"high number of bidders," according
to Marina Morilla, a contract special
ist in University procurement. A com
mittee of students and administrators
ran a competitive selection process
over the course of the past year, eval
uating proposals and conducting fol
low-up interviews with potential busi
nesses.
According to Jackie Charonis, ad
ministrative services manager for the
new quad, the targeted date for the
eatery's opening is Aug. 13, but it is still
flexible until an official contract has
been signed. Most eatery leases at
Stanford last three to five years.
The sandwich shop's original loca
tion in San Francisco and second loca
tion in Redwood City are known for
lines that wrap around the corner, and
for its giant-sized sandwiches.
"This ain't your momma's sand
wich shop," Ike's website claims. The
eatery's owner, Ike Shehadeh, says
every sandwich is uniquely made.
"We don't finish baking the bread
until they order it," he said. "It's 10 to
15 minutes old, rather than a day old."
There are 183 different sandwich
choices, with creative names ranging
from the "Lizzy's Lips" to "Do You
Smell What Barack Is Cooking?" Each
sandwich is smothered with a choice of
a special "dirty sauce."

The San Francisco shop says it at
tracts up to 1,200 customers on week
end days, and its sandwiches range in
price from $8 to $l5. According to She
hadeh, the wait time for a sandwich can
range from anywhere from 20 minutes
to two hours.
"The only time we're not busy is
when we're closed," he said.
A Bay Area native, Shehadeh had
always wanted to own a business.
Flowever, the process to achieving his
goal was initially a difficult one.
He got his first taste of the business
world after dropping out of UC-Davis
to run a supermarket in San Francisco
in 1998. Leaving his college career as a
computer science and engineering
major, he made "a lot of money" by
working instead of going to school.
Unfortunately, the supermarket
went out of business in 2004. She
hadeh's finances took a toll, but he re
mained committed to his plans of own
ing a business.
"I was homeless and jobless for
awhile," he said. "When I got back to
work at the end of 2005,1 had to work
in different places."
According to Shehadeh, he had no
desire to work for others since he
wanted to save his talents for himself
rather than "making a bunch of money
for someone else."
"I didn't think the companies I
worked for had cared about their em
ployees, so I didn't want to help them
make money," he said.
Shehadeh worked for a variety of
companies, including Trader Joe's, Vic
toria's Secret and Bebe.
His decision to open Ike's Place
was a result of wanting a small business
that required less capital, he said. Self
sufficiency was an important goal, as

he wanted to make the startup himself
without worrying about hiring em
ployees.

"I didn't have much cash," She
hadeh said. "I was taking a risk and I
didn't want to spend a lot of money. I
wanted it to be minimal."

With his goal in mind, he sum
moned his knowledge of flavors and
combinations that "really worked

well" as he experimented with various
foods during his college years, and set
out to open the shop now heading to
campus.
"I love to cook," Shehadeh said. "I
love to mix new flavors and make
something tasty."
The Science and Engineering Quad
is nearing completion on west campus;
it sits on 8.2 acres adjacent to Via Orte-

ga and Hewlett and Packard. It began
as an estimated $375-million to $420-
million project in 2006 and will house,
among other spaces, the new head
quarters of the School of Engineering.
