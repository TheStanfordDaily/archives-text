# OPINIONS
## EDITORIAL Class of 2010 should consider how they can give back to Stanford 
### 
Stanford provides countless opportuni
ties and resources for anyone who is
able to call the University their own.
Academic opportunities, access to real
world opportunities and the ability to travel
abroad are just a few of the many benefits
graduating seniors will remember after
leaving campus next month. In light of the
invaluable resources and opportunities
Stanford provides, the Editorial Board
would like to take this time to suggest that
graduating members of the Class of 2010
consider what they can do to give back to
the University now that their time as under
grads is almost at an end.
After leaving campus, most members of
the Class of 2010 will experience few occa
sions outside of reunions and alumni events
when they will be able to spend time on
campus and enjoy the atmosphere of the
University. One of the ways Stanford tries to
remind our alumni of their time here is
through events like this past weekend's Bay
Area Leading Matters. Leading Matters is a
series of 19 events throughout the world
that help alumni to reconnect. As a capstone
to most of the events, the Main Quad is sim
ulated in some form and attendees are al
most literally brought back to campus.
These events, like so many of the opportuni
ties provided to alumni, are funded largely
out of what alumni themselves give back to
the University. So as soon-to-be-alumni
themselves, the Class of 2010 should consid
er how giving back to the University
even in small amounts can be of benefit
to their post-undergraduate lives.
The benefits of alumni giving, however,

are by no means limited to alumni them
selves. In order to maintain the University's
strong financial aid resources, countless stu
dent programs and vibrant student commu
nity, Stanford asks many of us to give back
each year, whether it be by writing thank you
letters, engaging with alumni during Reunion
Homecoming Weekend or by calling admit
ted students to help give them a student per
spective on the campus. Each of these ac
tions, and many more, are ways by which we
are able to help contribute something back to
the University.
More formally, The Stanford Fund
through The Senior Gift asks each graduat
ing senior to give a meaningful financial do
nation to Stanford. The Stanford Fund itself
is an annual fund that is spent down every
year on financial aid, academic programming
and student life. All seniors have benefited in
some way from one, if not all, of these focus
areas, and it makes sense for those who are
able to give something back to go ahead and
contribute.
The Editorial Board also thinks that
adopting a wider view of "giving back" or
philanthropy would be best for graduating
seniors who are able to contribute in this way.
Many seniors, for example, can serve on a col
lege panel in their city after graduation or
can work to strengthen their local alumni
chapter, just to name two of the opportuni
ties available to recent alumni. Remember
ing all that Stanford has contributed to our
individual lives and futures, it makes sense
for the newest alumni of Stanford to start
thinking early about giving back to their
alma mater.
