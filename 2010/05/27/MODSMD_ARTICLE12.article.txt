# ADVENTURES IN ACADEMIA
## Rebuilding Political Consensus â€” and America too 
### Danny Crichton 
The incredible jubilation felt by the stu
dents sitting in the CoHo on Election
Night 2008 was almost overpowering
for those of us warily watching from the
chocolate-colored sofas. There was a palpa
ble sense in the air, unwarranted, as it would
turn out, that the world had suddenly be
come brighter, that America was going to rid
itself of the damage of the Bush era and bring
back liberalism into politics.
Fast-forward to today, and those halcyon
images seem only fleeting against the back
drop of the current political environment.
President Obama's approval rating has
plummeted across the country (and among
students here as well), and it appears that the
upcoming midterm elections, regardless of
their outcome, will undermine the mandate
he has used to push his agenda.
That is unfortunate, for while Obama's
plans are certainly variable in their quality, all
of them are part of a needed big vision for
this country. As someone in the middle of the
spectrum, it pains me to see a country like
America with such a grand view of our mis
sion on Earth to be thwarted repeatedly by
special interest groups and intense partisan
politics.

Thinking big is what made America the
country it is today. Franklin Delano Roo
sevelt built the modern social safety net from
scratch, despite intense opposition in Con
gress, while also defeating some of the most
fearsome regimes in human history. Truman
initiated the Marshall Plan to rebuild an en
tire continent a plan that is still paying
dividends today. At home, Eisenhower built
the interstate highway system, which remains
the bedrock of transportation in America.
Today, we need that kind of big thinking if
America is going to position itself well for the
21st century. In "The Post American World,"
Fareed Zakaria notes that America's decline
will not be caused by the rise of China or
India but rather by ourselves. It is our inabil
ity to take leadership on our own country's
needs that endangers our position in the
world. Simply, our lack of consensus on the
big issues is hurting us deeply.
Just what are these big issues? First, there
needs to be more consensus on the intense
value of knowledge in our future economy.
We see this issue in the large budget cuts to
higher education that state governments
have handed down over the past year, and we
see it in the high levels of inequality in Amer
ican public schools. This situation fundamen
tally undermines the long-term economic
growth of this country, yet budget decisions
remain decidedly focused on the short term.
America needs better-educated citizens
across the board, and a consensus has to de
velop to make this a reality.
Another example is energy independ-

ence. There is debate about just how inde
pendent America can be in energy, and there
is continuing debate about the timing of peak
oil. Nonetheless, it is clear that America's en
ergy portfolio needs to be re-envisioned for
the energy mix arriving in the next few
decades. In these very pages,Teryn Norris ar
gued for students to help develop a new con
sensus on our future energy sources. Unfor
tunately, a consensus has not developed, hin
dering our ability to invest in the future.
Infrastructure development, especially
Internet access, will prove crucial for the eco
nomic vitality of our nation. The stimulus bill
passed last year was an important first step,
but what remains to be seen is whether a
long-term commitment can be sustained to
fund these important initiatives.
Finally, America needs to begin conceiv
ing a new plan for urban development that
places new urbanism at the center of our city
planning. America's cities are designed with
the car firmly at the center of transportation.
We now know that those choices have led to
a transit culture that increases stress and pol
lution and hinders community development.
Building green cities is necessary for our
long-term economic performance, even
though no consensus seems to have been
formed.
The common theme between these four
examples and, indeed, all the grand visions
needed today is the lack of consensus on
long-term initiatives that will greatly influ
ence America's standing in the coming cen
tury. The lack of immediate rewards allows
these issues to be easily pushed to the side in
favor of more immediate and, I would
argue, more partisan policies.
During that Election Night, I watched
warily because I did not believe that political
consensus had been formed (the election was
53 percent to 46 percent). Instead, I am left
with the hope that a new third party may rise
up in the coming years and develop the mod
erate middle into a powerful political force.
America has only a finite time to lay the
groundwork for the maintenance of our in
ternational position. The time to act has to be
now.

days are ahead. Do you agree? Share your
