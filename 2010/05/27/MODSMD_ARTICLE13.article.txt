# ALTERNATIVE LIVING...WITHOUT THE NAKED
## On Finding Direction 
### Samantha Toh 
This summer marks the end of one year
and eight months away from home. On
the brink of returning, I think a lot
about what could possibly have changed, and
I am excited to see what has evolved and
what has not. The streets will probably feel
more crowded and I know of a few new malls
that have gone up, big and brassy. In contrast,
the street stalls and night markets will still
reek of home, with the smell of barbecuing
meats, pandan leaves and herbal soups boil
ing. The food, of course, will taste the same
excellent. Of this I am sure.

More than the physical change of my
hometown, however, I think a lot about peo
ple, and the fact that many of my friends will
embody the disparate tensions of change and
continuity. A year into college, I remember
going home and being regaled with stories of
three of them drinking beer and cocktails at
a seedy club and dancing wildly to Madon
na's "Like a Virgin." Hearing these stories
felt like a listening to an unfamiliar scandal,
all at once shocking and delightful. After all,
most of us originally became friends in a con
servative environment of button-down uni
forms, pleated skirts and trousers cuffed at
the heel. It was academic, not to mention bor
ing. An increasingly liberating adult life, from
crazy college parties to tax forms, was becom
ing newly relevant for all of us. As somebody
transitioning into adulthood away from
home, however, I was taking a very different
path from many people I knew.
Putting Madonna and cocktails aside for a
moment, what strikes at the heart of the mat

ter is the idea of growing up. I think about this
question frequently. More than collegiate
partying and moments of feral independence,
I worry about how I can go about fulfilling a
grander societal purpose, post-Stanford. Un
like my friends at home, most of who are on
track to completing professional degrees that
will set them into 40- or 50-year-long law or
accounting careers, my future is an unwritten
book. I cannot envision, even nearing the con
clusion of my third year at Stanford, what I
want to do with the rest of my life.
For one, I do not think I have any long
term direction in life. My dreams of volcanol
ogy, romantic sea-faring and squid-studying
appeared in bursts of passions and then
faded, some at the age of five, some at the age
of 15. While a number of interests have stuck
with me through the years, glimmers of what
they are, are only just beginning to surface.
The idea of a professional marriage is, at best,
frightening, and at worst, suffocatingly claus
trophobic.

There are some amazing human beings
who have a fairly developed sense of direc
tion, and I will continue to have overwhelm
ing amounts of respect for them. At Stanford,
someone I know wants to improve the state
of public transportation in the United States
by studying trains in other countries, while
another wants to work with reforming educa
tion policy through minority grassroots cam
paigning. These goals boggle my mind with
their specificity and ambition. In contrast, I
plod along, fudging through questions of
what I like and want to achieve.

At the same time, I have come to realize
the normalcy of my situation. The end of
Stanford does not necessarily mark the end
of myriad options and the indecision that
comes with these options. Instead, Stanford,
while helping some to find one path, opened
up for me even more avenues of passion than
existed before. The idea that I can love so
many things and still have time to choose be
tween them is exciting. Life is just beginning.
I have also come to realize that profes
sional direction is hardly the only direction
one needs to figure out. Becoming certain of
the traits I want to embody and who I am as
a social being is just as valid a concern. In this
respect, I believe I have progressed farther
than I thought I would. I manage emotions a
lot better, I have become more sensible and,
most importantly, I have begun to really
enjoy focusing on others, which provides me
with a solid sense of emotional direction.

Almost a year ago, I realized that an un
fettered trust in people creates experiences
so valuable that even getting hurt in the
process is nothing in comparison. Suck it up
and focus on the good and the beautiful. If in
10 years I still don't know where I am going
with my career, at least I can hold onto a blos
soming sense of self.
