# LETTER TO THE EDITOR

### 
Dear Editor,
On May 13th, Stanford's Vice President of
Human Resources, Diane Peck, wrote a letter
to the editor concerning the current Living
Wage Campaign, a worker-student initiative
to ensure all Stanford workers are covered by
Stanford's Living Wage policy. Peck sought to
correct what she considered to be "factual er
rors." Shortly after this publication, several
students from the Campaign met with Peck
and David Jones, the Associate Vice President
of Employee & Management Services.
Throughout the meeting, it was clear that
Stanford takes its role as a "just employer"
very seriously. Indeed, Stanford boasts one of
the most progressive living wage policies in
the Bay Area, but if Stanford is to truly consid
er itself a "just employer," the Living Wage
Campaign, which is supported by 15 endors
ing groups, over 500 individuals who have
signed its petition, and a significant number of
workers, believes that a living wage for all
Stanford workers is necessary. Let us examine
Peck's claims in turn.

First, Peck asserts, "ALL of the more than
12,000 employees paid directly by Stanford
plus thousands of temporary and casual em
ployees earn more than the living wage." This
may be true, but she fails to mention the thou
sands of workers who are NOT paid a living

wage for example, the custodians, cooks,
and groundskeepers who enable the Univer
sity to function.
Second, Peck and Jones have insisted that
imposing a living wage would contradict the
right of employees to bargain collectively. We
agree that the right to collective bargaining is
of prime importance, but we do not see how a
living wage contradicts this. Indeed, the major
unions on campus SEIU Local 2007 and 1877
support the Living Wage Campaign. But
should a union decide, for some reason, that a
Living Wage Policy interferes with its best in
terest, we suggest that unions be given an op
tion: they do not have to adopt the Living
Wage Policy, but if they do, the University
should ensure that they are paid accordingly.
Third, Peck claims, "It would be unprece
dented and legally unsupportable for the
University to ... impose its Living Wage Pol
icy on separate legal entities that have a land
lord tenant relationship with the university."
In the meeting, Peck made clear that she is
not an attorney and thus unable to confident
ly speak to the legality of such a policy, but
that she would inquire with legal counsel.
Stanford has many stipulations to which
renters must abide if they want to do business
with the University; we are merely asking that
the Living Wage Policy be added to that list. It
may not be possible to impose such a policy in

the midst of a rental agreement, but when
agreements expire or are renegotiated, we
see no reason, other than a lack of will, that
the policy cannot be included. Stanford
makes money from hundreds to thousands of
businesses, but has no qualms about workers
possibly making poverty-level wages at these
businesses.

Finally, Peck discloses that Stanford's cur
rent policy "applies to contracts that have an
aggregate value of $lOO,OOO or more." There
are many contracts that fall below this dollar
amount, meaning that many Stanford work
ers are not guaranteed a living wage. Surely,
monitoring all such contracts is not an easy,
but we must assume these are not cash deal
ings made behind the dumpsters of Stern. The
University is not exempt from ethical busi
ness practices. Having a comprehensive Liv
ing Wage Policy for all is a standard to which
the University's monitoring must rise.
While the Living Wage Campaign appreci
ates that the administration has taken the time
to respond to our demands and to meet with us
in person, we want more than face time. We de
mand that Stanford lives up to its claims to jus
tice and its place as a leader in every respect.
