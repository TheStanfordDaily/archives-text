The Stanford track and field team finds itself
in Austin, Texas this week, competing to advance
its athletes to the NCAA Outdoor Champi
onships on June 9-12. Only the top 12 finishers in
each event at this week's preliminary round will
earn a place at nationals in Eugene, Ore.
Prior to this year, after Pac-lOs, the Stanford
track and field team would generally send a
contingent of athletes to the Regional Cham
pionships, a meet that boasts the best in the re
gion, before select athletes would head off to
the NCAA Outdoor Championships. This
year, however, the regional meet has been
eliminated and replaced with an NCAA pre
liminary.

For the rest of the week, the Card will be com
peting for the top 12 spots out of a field of 48 in
each event. Stanford has a relatively large team
at the meet, with 17 women competing in 20 in
dividual events and one relay, and 15 men com
peting in 16 individual events and two relays.
Some events will have prelims and finals,
while others, mainly the longer events, will have
just one round.The other preliminary round will
take place in North Carolina.

In the sprints, the women have strong repre
sentation in the 100-meter dash. Senior Griffin
Matthew leads the way with her ninth seed in the
event, closely followed by freshman Carissa
Levingston at 11th seed. Both Matthew and
Levingston have a strong possibility of being on
the national team.The final Cardinal in the event
is redshirt sophomore Shataya Hendricks, sitting

in the 46th position. Hendricks will need a
breakthrough performance to move into the
qualifying range, but her runs this year show that
she has the potential to do so. Despite battling
several injuries throughout her time on the
Farm, Hedricks'performance has been improv
ing over the season.

The women will also have a 4xloo relay team,
seeded 11th.

In the 1,500 meters, the two Stanford athletes
will face stiff competition to make it into the top
12. Junior Madeline Duhon sits at 17th, while
sophomore Victoria Pennings is 42nd. If Duhon
qualifies, it will be her first appearance at the
NCAA Championship meet.

Also sitting at 17th place is redshirt senior
Madeleine O'Meara in the 3,000-meter steeple
chase. O'Meara has proven to be relentless in
this event, tackling each steeple as if it were the
first. If she can continue to improve and have a
personal best in the event, she has a chance of
qualifying.

In the 5,000 meters, sole running power
house, freshman Kathy Kroeger, represents the
Cardinal in the ninth seed.

Finally, the female distance runners boast
three runners in the 10,000 meters. Sophomore
Georgia Griffin, junior Stephanie Marcy and
senior Kate Niehaus sit in ninth, 10th and 13th,
respectively.

The women also boast excellent athletes in
the field events, most notably in the long jump.
Led by Matthew in the fifth seed, five women
will compete in the long jump: junior Arantxa
King (10th), junior Brittni Dixon-Smith (14th),
junior Whitney Liehr (29th) and freshman

Karynn Dunn (43rd). King and Liehr will also
compete in the triple jump, seeded at 14th and
15th, respectively.

Two women who are most likely to make it to
the next level of competition are sophomore Ka
terina Stefanidi and redshirt senior Jaynie
Goodbody. Stefanidi, ranked ninth in the pole
vault, has consistently improved and dominated
the event all season, finishing fourth at NCAA
Indoors. Goodbody, ranked eighth, was the Pac
-10 champion in the hammer throw, and will look
to qualify for her third consecutive NCAA
Championship meet.

Also competing in the throws is junior Liz
Minoofar, ranked 40th in the javelin. Minoofar
will need a personal best to advance to nationals.
On the men's side, the distance runners are
expected to dominate the competition. Seeded
fourth in the 1,500 meters, sophomore Dylan
Ferris is poised to easily earn a ticket to nation
als. Also competing in the event is freshman An
drew Berberick, ranked 29th.
In the 5,000 meters, Stanford boasts three
runners in the top 12: junior Elliott Heath
(third), sophomore Chris Derrick (fourth) and
junior Jake Riley (10th). Riley will also be com
peting in the 10,000 meters, ranked 13th, along
with junior Brendan Gregg, ranked 16th.
In the 3,000-meter steeplechase, junior JT
Sullivan has a good chance to qualify for nation
als, sitting at ninth seed. Also competing in the
event is sophomore Ben Johnson, ranked 34th.
Representing Stanford in the 800 meters is
senior Justin Reed, ranked 18th.
In the shorter distances, the Cardinal features
one of the best runners in the country, sopho

more Amaechi Morton. Morton is ranked and
seeded second in the nation.
"My plan for regionals is to make it through
the rounds and advance to NCAAs," Morton
said. "My goal is to take control of my races from
the start, and maintain that. People will show up
ready to run, and I will be ready as well, because
only 12 advance."
Also competing in the hurdles is senior
Durell Coleman, ranked 20th after a spectacular
personal record at Pac-lOs.
Lastly, competing in the sprints for the men is
senior Danny Belch, ranked 44th in the 100 me

ters.
In the relays, the men are ranked 20th in both
the 4xloo and the 4x400.
Three Cardinal men will compete in the field
events: freshman Jules Sharpe in the high jump
(42nd), junior Casey Roche in the pole vault
(21st) and redshirt junior Carter Wells in the
hammer throw (16th).
These Stanford athletes will begin competi
tion today and conclude on Saturday.
