# Test your knowledge: The College Game

Sporcle is a destructive force.
For those of you very unlucky
souls that are unfamiliar,
Sporcle is a website filled
with trivia games that test you
on knowledge of things from the U.S.
Presidents to words that end in "ta."
Unfortunately, Sporcle is also satu
rated with sports trivia games that con
sume sports nerds like myself for hours
on end, depriving us of basic necessities
like productivity. There is very little
point in writing an essay when I have the
option of quizzing myself on NBA play
ers that have averaged 30 or more points
per game over the course of a season.
Why go to the gym when I can find out
that Loyola Chicago was one of just a

handful of teams to be named the No. 1
team in the AP Preseason Poll?
And I'm not one for unconvention
al columns, but to hell with it, I wanted
to challenge you, the reader, to a Sporc
lesque challenge.
Welcome to "The College Game."
One of my current suitemates and I
play this game on at least a tri-weekly
basis, and it doesn't get any less enter
taining. The rules are simple: I give you
the name of a fairly significant NFL or
NBA player, and you tell me what
school he went to. Sounds simple
enough, right? Give it your best shot.

Getting Started
1. Washington Redskins QB Donovan

McNabb
2. Atlanta Hawks G Joe Johnson
3. New England Patriots WR Randy
Moss
4. Charlotte Bobcats F Gerald Wallace
5. Tennessee Titans RB Chris Johnson
A little harder...
6. Oakland Raiders QB Bruce Grad
kowski
7. Utah Jazz G/F Kyle Korver
S.Seattle Seahawks WR T.J. Housh
mandzadeh
9. Phoenix Suns G Steve Nash
10. Denver Broncos QB Kyle Orton

Go time
11. Free agent WR Terrell Owens
12. Detroit Pistons C Ben Wallace
13. Arizona Cardinals CB Dominique
Rodgers-Cromartie
14.Washington Wizards G Earl
Boykins
15. Dallas Cowboys QB Tony Romo
Old School
16. Former WR Jerry Rice
17. Former G John Stockton
18. Former QB Kurt Warner
19. Former F Larry Bird
20. Former RB Marshall Faulk
Suggestions from friends
21. Atlanta Falcons RB Michael Turner
22. Utah Jazz F Paul Millsap
23. New Orleans Saints WR Marques
Colston
24. New Jersey Nets G Courtney Lee
25. Cleveland Browns QB Jake Del
homme

My personal favorites
26. San Antonio Spurs G George Hill
27. Cleveland Browns WR Mohamed
Massaquoi
28. Los Angeles Lakers F Lamar Odom
29. Washington Redskins LB London
Fletcher
30. Detroit Pistons G Rodney Stuckey
There you have it. If you can get the
majority of them, you can legitimately
hang. Feel free to cheat if you need to,
I'm sure it will be necessary. For those
of you who want an honest test, here's
a scoring guide:
0-4: F.mmitt Smith
5-9:Tedyßruschi
10-14: Jeff Van Gundy
15-19: Tom Jackson
20-24: Chris Mortensen
25-29: John Hollinger
30: Howie Schwab
In parting, I'll leave you with one
hint: London Fletcher played for the
Blue Streaks.
Zach Zimmerman knew all these with
out cheating. Try to stump him at zachz
