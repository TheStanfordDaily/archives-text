# Test your knowledge: The College Game

Sporcle is a destructive force.
For those of you very unlucky
souls that are unfamiliar,
Sporcle is a website filled
with trivia games that test you
on knowledge of things from the U.S.
Presidents to words that end in "ta."
Unfortunately, Sporcle is also satu
rated with sports trivia games that con
sume sports nerds like myself for hours
on end, depriving us of basic necessities
like productivity. There is very little
point in writing an essay when I have the
option of quizzing myself on NBA play
ers that have averaged 30 or more points
per game over the course of a season.
Why go to the gym when I can find out
that Loyola Chicago was one of just a

handful of teams to be named the No. 1
team in the AP Preseason Poll?
And I'm not one for unconvention
al columns, but to hell with it, I wanted
to challenge you, the reader, to a Sporc
lesque challenge.
Welcome to "The College Game."
One of my current suitemates and I
play this game on at least a tri-weekly
basis, and it doesn't get any less enter
taining. The rules are simple: I give you
the name of a fairly significant NFL or
NBA player, and you tell me what
school he went to. Sounds simple
enough, right? Give it your best shot.
