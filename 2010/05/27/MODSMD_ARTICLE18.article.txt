# Test your knowledge: Name the mascots

### Jacob Jaffe Fields of Failure 
As someone with little-to
no life in many ways and,
therefore, far too much
time to spend on Sporcle,
I can (all too easily) re
late to Zach's quiz column. I might
have even had a part in coming up
with some choices. In any case, trivia is
a very big part of my life (195 flags of
the world in under eight minutes
beat that).
In the quiz spirit, I decided to in
clude one of my own. I am an active
participant in "The College Game," but
that's been covered. I also think there
will be little interest in a sports column
about the periodic table, seven-letter
country names or words that begin and
end with "g," so I'll spare you some of
my other Sporcling hobbies.
Now, there are fairly limitless possi

bilities for sports quizzes. I could go
with questions like "Who has won the
most Directors' Cups?" or "Where did
John Elway, Ryan Garko, Tiger Woods,
Mike Mussina and John McEnroe go
to school? " I could ask who has won the
most women's tennis titles or the most
women's titles in all sports. I could ask
who is going to win this year's Direc
tors' Cup or the all-time award for best
tennis tackle. But wouldn't it just get a
little repetitive when every answer is
Stanford?

Instead, let's go for something even
more trivial than titles and wins, and
even more trivial than the names of col
leges. Yep, you guessed it. Here's a mas
cot quiz:
