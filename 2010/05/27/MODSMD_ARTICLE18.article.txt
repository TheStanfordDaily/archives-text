# Test your knowledge: Name the mascots
## 
### Jacob Jaffe Fields of Failure 
As someone with little-to
no life in many ways and,
therefore, far too much
time to spend on Sporcle,
I can (all too easily) re
late to Zach's quiz column. I might
have even had a part in coming up
with some choices. In any case, trivia is
a very big part of my life (195 flags of
the world in under eight minutes
beat that).
In the quiz spirit, I decided to in
clude one of my own. I am an active
participant in "The College Game," but
that's been covered. I also think there
will be little interest in a sports column
about the periodic table, seven-letter
country names or words that begin and
end with "g," so I'll spare you some of
my other Sporcling hobbies.
Now, there are fairly limitless possi

bilities for sports quizzes. I could go
with questions like "Who has won the
most Directors' Cups?" or "Where did
John Elway, Ryan Garko, Tiger Woods,
Mike Mussina and John McEnroe go
to school? " I could ask who has won the
most women's tennis titles or the most
women's titles in all sports. I could ask
who is going to win this year's Direc
tors' Cup or the all-time award for best
tennis tackle. But wouldn't it just get a
little repetitive when every answer is
Stanford?

Instead, let's go for something even
more trivial than titles and wins, and
even more trivial than the names of col
leges. Yep, you guessed it. Here's a mas
cot quiz:
Hey, I know mascots!
1. University of Arizona

2. Kansas State University
3. University of Kentucky
Creativity is our policy
4. Texas A&M University
5. Utah State University
6. New Mexico State University
7. University of California-Davis
Oh my! This isn't as hard as it 100k5...
8. Loyola Marymount University
9. Princeton University
10. Missouri State University
What IS that?
11. Georgetown University
12. Ohio State University

13. Virginia Tech University
14. Indiana University
Let's make this a little more colorful
15. University of Tulsa
16. University of North Texas
17.Tulane University

Harder, but not yet ridiculous
20. University of Massachusetts

That should keep you busy/frustrat
ed/questioning my sanity. For a scoring

guide, feel free to use the same one as
Zach's column. And if you manage to
get more than 30, let's just say I'm sorry.
You're in the rare company of people
who fill their mind with as many useless
sports facts as I do.
For everyone else, take notes.
Someday Stanford will have a mascot
name as awesome (or terrible) as some
of these.
