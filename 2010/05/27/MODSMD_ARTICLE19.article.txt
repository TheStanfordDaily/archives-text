# SAVING BEST FOR LAST
## 
### DANIEL BOHM SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford baseball team (30-21, 13-11 Pac-10)
closes out its regular season this weekend with perhaps
its toughest opponent of the season: No. 3 Arizona State
(45-7,18-6).
The Cardinal and Sun Devils will play a three-game
home series beginning today and running through Satur
day.
Although Stanford has all but secured its spot in the
NCAA Tournament field, which will be announced
Monday, a sweep at the hands of Arizona State this
weekend could make Cardinal players nervous during
the selection show. Conversely, if Stanford is able to
sweep the Sun Devils and get some help elsewhere, it
could potentially host a regional.
The Card is also in position to spoil Arizona State's
chance of winning the Pac-10 Conference. If Stanford
sweeps the Sun Devils and UCLA sweeps Washington
State, the Bruins would be the conference champions.
Stanford comes into the weekend fresh off of a huge
series win at Arizona (32-20,11-13) last weekend. The
Cardinal got a great start from sophomore lefty Brett
Mooneyham on Friday, as he went 7.2 innings while al
lowing just one run. Mooneyham will start today in a
showdown with the Sun Devils' ace, junior Seth Blair.
While Mooneyham is 3-5 with a 4.82 ERA on the year,
his stats are not indicative of his pitching the last month
and a half.
On Friday, Stanford will send sophomore Jordan
Pries, who was the Cardinal's best pitcher early in the
season but has struggled as of late, to the mound against
Arizona State junior Merrill Kelly. Kelly is 4-1 on the
year with a 3.47 ERA more impressive given that he
pitches most of his games in the thin, dry Arizona air.
In Saturday's game, freshman Dean McArdle will
likely get his third weekend start against Arizona State
sophomore Jake Borup in Stanford's final game of the
regular season.
The Sun Devils last visited the Farm in 2008, when the
Cardinal took two of three games from the then-No. 1
Arizona State. At that point, Pat Murphy was still Ari
zona State's coach. Murphy has since resigned under
cloudy circumstances, although first-year coach Tim
Esmay seems to have picked up right where Murphy left
off.
The Sun Devils as always have absolutely mashed the
baseball.
Leading that potent offense is sophomore infielder
Zack MacPhee. MacPhee is hitting .388 with eight home
runs and 56 runs batted in, not to mention 17 steals.
Stanford, on the other hand, is led offensively by

freshman third baseman Kenny Diekroeger. A highly
touted recruit out of high school, Diekroeger has quick
ly adjusted to the college game. Diekroeger leads the
team with a .366 batting average and is tied for the team
lead in RBIs with 39.
Other factors to watch in this series are the catching
situation and the return of freshman outfielder Tyler
Gaffney to the Stanford lineup. Gaffney missed last Sun
day's game for personal reasons, but is expected to take
his normal spot in right field today and hit in the lead
spot.
At catcher, junior Ben Clowe, who started the final
two games of the Arizona series last weekend, may once
again replace regular starter junior Zach Jones, who has
faltered in recent games.
Stanford begins its last series of the season against
Arizona State at 5:30 p.m. today at Sunken Diamond.
