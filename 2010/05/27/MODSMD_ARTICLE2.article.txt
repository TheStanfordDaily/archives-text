## Partial fill plays out at Suites in-house draw New assignment policy allows single choice 
### JOSHUA FALK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Tuesday night's in-house draw for
Suites residences was the first with a
"partial fill" option, which resulted in
confusion for many residents and res
idential staff during the three-and-a
half hour room assignment process.
Next year's Suites residents and
staff gathered at Bollard Dining Soci
ety in Governor's Corner for the in
house draw, which didn't go the way
many residents had expected.
"I came in with a group of six and
you assume you're all going to live to
gether," said incoming Suites resident
Jamie Bruce '12. "But we got split up."
"People got the option to partial
fill," said Katie Gardner '12, who will
be a Resident Assistant (RA) in Suites
next year. According to Gardner, the
new partial-fill option allowed stu
dents to draw into certain rooms with
in a suite without filling up the entire
suite with a group.
Last year, students were required
to form groups that completely filled a
four-, six- or eight-person suite. This
year, with partial fill, individuals were
given the option of selecting a room
wherever there was one space, as long
as it was within the category of suites
they were assigned to in the Draw.
Gardner said at Tuesday's draw
that this change made the in-house
draw process "more competitive," but
in the end, only one draw group was
separated.
"They ended up with people they
knew and people they liked," Gardner
said.
On Wednesday, though, Gardner
acknowledged that the complication
of the Draw process came as "kind of
a shock" to the incoming staff.
"Most of us weren't really aware of
how big a problem [partial fill] would
be until just before in-house draw
started," Gardner said.
Zac Sargeant, an assistant director
in Student Housing, was on hand Tues
day to assist with the in-house draw
process.
"For the most part it balanced out
okay," Sargeant said. "It took a little
more work, but that's all."
But some residents were less satis
fied with the outcome of the in-house
draw. For groups that drew into Suites
with a complete group, partially filled
suites could have forced a group to
split if no empty suites were available.
"The whole appeal of living in
Suites was living with a group of girls
we had," said Amy Decker '13, a mem
ber of Bruce's draw group. "Now
we're just taking whatever's left."
Freshman Kirsten Ornelas' draw
group, which was assigned to a four
person suite, was placed in an eight
person suite with another draw group.
"They didn't really tell us why it
happened, but it seemed like they had
just run out of four-person suites and
they couldn't accommodate every
one," Ornelas wrote in an e-mail to
The Daily. "The other group almost
seemed as lost as us and there was con
fusion even among the people who
were supposed to be in charge,"
Ornelas did not know that being
placed in an eight-person suite was a
possibility for her group.
"It was pretty chaotic there," she
said.
