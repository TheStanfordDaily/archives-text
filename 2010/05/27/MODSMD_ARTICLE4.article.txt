## GSC overspent by $26,000 Members consider ways to keep VSO funding within budget 
### BRIANNA PANG STAFF WRITER 
Graduate Student Council (GSC)
members expressed sharp disapproval of
the council's overspending on voluntary
student organization (VSO) funding in
Wednesday's GSC meeting.
With the fiscal year coming to a close,
the GSC found itself financially in the
red. Unaware of the actual budget due to
"MyGroups confusion," the 2009-10
GSC approved $189,282.75 in VSO fund
ing during the year.
The originally set budget was
$163,000. According to funding commit
tee chair Krystal St. Julien, a graduate
student in biochemistry, the GSC may be
unable to approve funding requests until
July 1, when the new fiscal year begins.
"I'm not very happy, to say the least,"
St. Julien said. "Next year, this shit's not
happening again."
St. Julien said the GSC would need to
keep a "tighter reign" on which events
get funded for the upcoming year.
