## GSC overspent by $26,000 Members consider ways to keep VSO funding within budget 
### BRIANNA PANG STAFF WRITER 
Graduate Student Council (GSC)
members expressed sharp disapproval of
the council's overspending on voluntary
student organization (VSO) funding in
Wednesday's GSC meeting.
With the fiscal year coming to a close,
the GSC found itself financially in the
red. Unaware of the actual budget due to
"MyGroups confusion," the 2009-10
GSC approved $189,282.75 in VSO fund
ing during the year.
The originally set budget was
$163,000. According to funding commit
tee chair Krystal St. Julien, a graduate
student in biochemistry, the GSC may be
unable to approve funding requests until
July 1, when the new fiscal year begins.
"I'm not very happy, to say the least,"
St. Julien said. "Next year, this shit's not
happening again."
St. Julien said the GSC would need to
keep a "tighter reign" on which events
get funded for the upcoming year.
VSOs "shouldn't just get the
money just because they're within
the rules of the Appropriations
Committee," she said. "The GSC
needs to figure out if yes, this is a
worthwhile way to spend our
money or no, this is not a worth
while way to spend our money."

The council plans to draw funds
from a "rainy day" reserve ac
count. Members unanimously ap
proved a transfer of $26,283.
GSC member Crystal Yin, a
graduate student in management
science and engineering, also
brought up the issue of regulating
the number of VSOs on campus.
Yin claimed that many groups
were formed only for the sake of
sponsoring other groups.
"We need to get inactive groups
to deactivate themselves," Yin said.

"They only do co-sponsorships to
help other groups have more fund
ing, but they're not doing anything
besides co-sponsorship. This pre
vents active groups from being reg
istered, since they have to differenti
ate themselves from existing groups
that may not be doing anything."
"'lnactivity' would be deter
mined by the SAL [Student Activ
ities and Leadership]," Yin added.
Other members agreed with
Yin's proposal. Ryan Peacock, the
former GSC financial officer, ex
plained the importance of "weed
ing out the groups."
"[These inactive groups'] only
purpose is to support these large
events on campus," Peacock said.
"It's like on their description, it
says 'a group used to suck out
more funding.' It's unbelievable.
It's like you have no shame!"
ASSU President Angelina Cor
dona 'll said she plans to work on the
issue with the executive chair for social
life, Warner Sallman 'll. The council
met Sallman and other cabinet mem
bers on Wednesday; it is set to vote on
their confirmation next week.

GSC members grilled the
chairs as they discussed ideas for
the upcoming year.
Taylor Savage 'l3 described his
idea for centralizing VSO infor
mation onto one website for more

convenient viewing.
"[The website] will be like an
information center, with all the in
formation like events and descrip
tions of groups," he said.
Adam Beberg, a doctoral stu
dent in computer science, said the
idea had already been piloted.
"The weak link isn't that we

don't have a website," Beberg said.
"The issue is that no groups use it."
Peacock, a doctoral student in
chemical engineering, is the only
graduate student in next year's cab
inet.
