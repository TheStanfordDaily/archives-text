# Interview program grows
## Admission, students reflect on pilot interview program in its third year 
### LAUREN WILSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
As Stanford's admission rate
dropped to a historically low rate this
year just 7.2 percent some appli
cants added an extra element to the
usual essays and transcript that com
prise the application: an admission in
terview.
Now, Stanford's Office of Under
graduate Admission has announced
the third year of the pilot interview
program that, if expanded, could ex
tend interviews to all applicants.
"Right now it's a pilot program,"
said Richard Shaw, dean of Under
graduate Admission. "That's exactly
what it is. It's been a pilot and it contin
ues to be one. We've not made any
final determination as to whether it
would be a larger program."
The pilot program began two
years ago and was first available to
some applicants for the Class of 2013;
it was offered again for the Class of
2014 and will be available to the in
coming applicant Class of 2015. Stan
ford alumni conduct interviews in the
applicant's area, then do a write-up of
the experience and send it to the ad
mission office.
While Harvard and Princeton
have instituted programs that offer
interviews to everyone who applies,
interviews for Stanford are currently
offered to applicants in 12 areas: At
lanta, Denver, London, Massachu
setts, Maryland, Minneapolis-St.
Paul, New York City, Philadelphia,
Portland, Virginia and Washington,
D.C.
Maryland, Virginia and Washing
ton, D.C. were just added for the appli
cants of the Class of 2015.
"They're pretty broadly distrib
uted across the nation," Shaw said of
the interview locations. "They're pri
marily metropolitan areas and very
importantly, we have strong alumni
presence in them."
Shaw emphasized that the inter
views are not required components
of the application. However, he did

note that the vast majority of appli
cants offered an interview chose to
take it.
Shaw said the admission office
would wait until its third year before
any decisions are made on whether or
not to implement the program more
broadly.
"So far we feel pretty strong suc
cess, but there's no preconceived no
tion that it will go forward," he said.
"We're still evaluating."

Stanford received more than
32,000 applications for spots in the
Class of 2014, about a 5.4 percent in
crease over the 30,348 received the
previous year.

Because of high application num
bers, Shaw is hesitant to expand the
program to cover all applicants in this
nascent stage. Undergraduate Admis
sion is still determining if it has the ca
pacity to employ this program world
wide. The concern affects Stanford's
home state in particular, where there
are currently no interview locations
due to the sheer volume of applica
tions Stanford receives from Califor
nia each year.
Shaw estimated around 2,500 ap
plicants received interviews this year.
This raises the question of whether or
not those 2,500 people received an un
fair advantage over ones who were not
interviewed.
"Really, what it does is it adds tex
ture to the application, as we get a
summary of the experience of meeting
the person in the process," Shaw said.
"In general, it isn't a make-or-break
deal. It's one piece of information
among all other pieces of information
that candidates give to us."
"I think, frankly, interviews can go
either way, but again, it's just a factor
among many," he added. "I think to
the extent that it hurts or helps a stu
dent's chances for Stanford, it's proba
bly more generally neutral than it is
one way or the other."

Shaw also asserted that the admis
sion rate among the interviewees was
in line with the overall admission rate.
Alumni who conduct the inter
views undergo training programs,
which include meetings and manu
als to ensure that interviews are as
comprehensive and consistent as
possible.
"Most don't see more than three
interviews in an area a year," Shaw
said. "Then they actually do a write
up of the interview process and get
that information to us so we get a
sense [of the applicant]." Shaw also
sees the interview process as away
to introduce Stanford programs to
individuals who may not be as fa
miliar with the University.
Christine Chung 'l3 was one stu

dent who underwent an interview
last year.

"I met with a recent graduate, I
think, because she was really young,"
Chung said. "We met at Borders and
grabbed some coffee. It was really
chill. It wasn't formal at all."

Chung discussed her interests
with her interviewer, who recom
mended on-campus activities and
groups to her should she be accepted.
However, she did not find the inter
view all that important.
"I didn't think it was a big deal,"
she said.

"I don't know how much colleges
in general benefit from the inter
views or if they mean anything ... I
guess it doesn't hurt to have more in
formation on the application,"
Chung added.
