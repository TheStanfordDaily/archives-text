# SPEAKERS & EVENTS
## COMMON SENSE 
### JOSHUA FALK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Hip-hop artist Common spoke in Memorial Auditorium on Wednesday
night, encouraging students to find their own paths and always strive for great
ness. The event was sponsored by Stanford Speakers Bureau and cosponsored
by Black Student Union.
"Find your path, believe in your path and live it," Common told students
after opening the event with a freestyle rap about the Farm.
"It's Common sense y'all/you know I understand words/I came to rock it
here right at Stanford," he began.

In a talk that focused on inspirational advice, Common recalled many form
ative experiences, including his time spent as a ball boy for the Chicago Bulls

while growing up on the city's South Side. As a ball boy, he met basketball
greats such as Magic Johnson, Larry Bird and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.

He said his sixth grade teacher had a significant influence on him
and taught him a great deal about literature and writing. As a

boy, the story of Emmett Till, an African American boy

from Chicago who was murdered while visiting the
South in 1955, had a profound impact on him.

Hip-hop artist Common encourages students to
plan ambitiously in a talk in Memorial Auditorium
on Wednesday night.
"I knew that to achieve greatness
in whatever I wanted to do, I had to
work hard," he said.
Common said he took to basket
ball as a young boy and wrote his
first rap with his cousins.
"When I wrote this rap," he said,
"I found something ... I found my
voice. When you find your voice, you
know what your voice is, and that's
your path."
"That voice allowed me to be able
to speak to you all," he continued.
"And that voice is something that I
cherish."
Common said when he dropped
out of college after a year and a half,
his mother urged him to go back.
"When I left, she said, 'You need
to hurry up and get back in school,"'
he recalled. "A couple years later she
told me, 'You need to hurry up and
write a new rap.'"
Common said he didn't begin to
believe in himself until his sixth
album, "Be," came out.
"I think I was scared of my great
ness," he said. "Why would you want
to be small when you are created to
be great?"
At a reception before the event,
Common mentioned that he grew up
listening to KRS-One and NWA,
and that Kanye West, Radiohead, Lil
Wayne and Bilal were among his in
fluences.
Audience members appreciated
Common's demeanor and his mes
sage.
"He's one of the true hip-hop
artists," said Sarah Adams 'O9 before
the event. "Common is about social
ly conscious music, which is some
thing you really don't see anymore."
"I thought he was pretty inspira
tional," said attendee Joseph
Fezadeh. "He dispelled a lot of
stereotypes one might have about a
hip-hop artist."
"He was on our level," added
AbelTeklai 'l2.
"I was happy to see that there was
a full house," said H. Samy Alim, an
education professor who teaches a
course on hip-hop. "He's been a hip
hop legend for more than a decade."
Common is known for his work as
a rapper, actor and activist.
