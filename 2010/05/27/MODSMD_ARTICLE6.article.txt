## COMMON SENSE 
### JOSHUA FALK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Hip-hop artist Common spoke in Memorial Auditorium on Wednesday
night, encouraging students to find their own paths and always strive for great
ness. The event was sponsored by Stanford Speakers Bureau and cosponsored
by Black Student Union.
"Find your path, believe in your path and live it," Common told students
after opening the event with a freestyle rap about the Farm.
"It's Common sense y'all/you know I understand words/I came to rock it
here right at Stanford," he began.

In a talk that focused on inspirational advice, Common recalled many form
ative experiences, including his time spent as a ball boy for the Chicago Bulls

while growing up on the city's South Side. As a ball boy, he met basketball
greats such as Magic Johnson, Larry Bird and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.

He said his sixth grade teacher had a significant influence on him
and taught him a great deal about literature and writing. As a

boy, the story of Emmett Till, an African American boy

from Chicago who was murdered while visiting the
South in 1955, had a profound impact on him.
