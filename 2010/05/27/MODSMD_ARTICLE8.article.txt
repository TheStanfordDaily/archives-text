## BOWTIES AND BALLADS 
### AVANTIKA AGARWAL 
It is 9 p.m. on a Sunday night inside a tiny,
deserted Braun classroom. A group of
boys with concerned looks on their faces
sits in a circle. The surrounding boys
watch in anticipation. There's a pause,
and suddenly a voice emerges.
"I feel like I have trouble connecting with
people since all my skin secretions are acidic
and I can't touch anyone without giving them
first degree burns," one boy says, followed by
raucous laughter from everyone else in the
room.

"Come on guys, let's be serious!" Sam Ju
lian 'lO interjects. But even he can't help crack
ing up as the group tries to read through the
skit about a super-hero support group.
The Stanford Fleet Street Singers are not
your run-of-the-mill all-male a cappella group.
Anyone who has been to a Fleet Street con
cert is familiar with the ridiculous skits and
videos that accompany their songs, as well as
their elaborate sets. From all of the boys burst
ing out of a massive dinosaur egg to a mechan
ic salamander crossing the Dinkelspiel stage,
Fleet Street is characterized by its creativity
and off-the-wall silliness.

"Our humor is definitely one of our biggest
selling points," said Julian Kusnadi 'll, this
year's director. "Before coming to Stanford, I
knew I wanted to join an a cappella group, but

Fleet Street wasn't what I had in mind. Flow
ever, at O Show, Fleet Street's performance re
ally stood out to me,"

But Fleet Street is not merely about tom
foolery and laughs. The members, in addition
to being complete goof balls who happen to be
strong vocalists, are also accomplished song
writers. The group prides itself on having a
large repertoire of original songs an aspect
that they feel distinguishes them from other a
cappella groups.

"As a performing group, Fleet Street isn't
just a group of singers," Kusnadi said. "We re
ally concentrate on making our group a cre
ative vehicle for all talents. We write our own
songs, spend hours designing and building
elaborate sets, design really cool posters."
"The writing process is very organic," he
added. "All members are highly encouraged to
contribute and collaborate. No song belongs
to any one member."

Fleet Street's talents have not gone unno
ticed beyond the Farm. Their most recent self
titled album, released in 2004, was hailed, "The
most important collegiate a cappella album to
be released in a decade" by Deke Sharon, the
head of Contemporary A Cappella Society of
America (CASA).

This year, Fleet Street has been hard at
work to finish a new album. Six years in the
making, "Through the Roof" features differ
ent iterations of the group and tracks written

by older members in previous years.
"It's not very typical, I know," Kusnadi said
with a laugh. "But then again, we're not very
concerned about being typical!"
The editing and mixing process has been
grueling, taking up large portions of the mem
bers' time and sometimes leaving them with
only 20 hours of sleep a week, members say.
The group recorded, edited and mixed its own
tracks at Stanford's Center for Computer Re
search in Music and Acoustics (CCRMA) be
fore sending them to an industry specialist,
Bill Hare.

Despite the huge time commitment, being
in Fleet Street does come with its share of fun
stories.

"Well, there was that one time in a hotel
room ...." Kusnadi laughed, reflecting on his
most memorable moments with the group. He
continued with tales of performing on cruise
ships to Mexico and being invited back to the
second round of America's Got Talent with an
all-expense-paid trip to New York.
For Andrew Nelson 'l2, highlights have in
cluded serenading the new dollies and Pi Phi
"littles." He also reported that some men have
called them to serenade their girlfriends while
proposing. But due to logistical reasons, this
has never actually happened.

Back in the classroom at Braun, the room is
filled with laughter and jesting. But with a
quick rap on the blackboard, a single piano

chord and a flick of Julian's hand, a certain
level of seriousness fills the room. And then, 16
voices blended into a perfect melody.
But the seriousness does not last long. The
beautiful love ballad quickly devolves into an
account of a serial killer with herpes, chlamy
dia, dementia and schizophrenia. And despite
its serious-sounding title, "Golden Rules" is
actually about bathroom etiquette for boys.
Go figure that's typical Fleet Street.
Fleet Street's new album will be released
on May 30, during the group's spring show,
"Fleet Street Makes History."
