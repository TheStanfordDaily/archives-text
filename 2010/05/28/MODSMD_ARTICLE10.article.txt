## Poetry and Pros Kay Ryan teaches this year's "The Occassions of Poetry" class 
### JOSHUA FALK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Before becoming the 16th United States Poet
Laureate in 2008, Kay Ryan established her
self as a poet outside of academia. She had
spent over 30 years living in California's
Marin County and teaching remedial Eng
lish part-time at the College of Marin. And she had
never even taken a creative writing class.
But this winter, she was teaching one at Stanford.
Each year, the Creative Writing Program's Mohr
Visiting Poet Series brings a prominent poet to cam
pus to work primarily with undergraduates. Recent
Mohr Visiting Poets include Mark Doty, Robert Pin
sky and Li-Young Lee.
"It brings a writer to campus, and after that it's ex
traordinarily open-ended," said Professor Eavan
Boland, director of the Creative Writing Program,
about the Mohr Visiting Poet Series. "You bring a per
son like that into a classroom and they bring their jour
ney with them."
Each Mohr Visiting Poet holds office hours, gives
readings and teaches an undergraduate course
"The Occasions of Poetry" which is capped at 15
students.
Lindsay Sellers 'lO, editor-in-chief of the Leland
Quarterly, took Kay Ryan's course during winter quar
ter. Sellers said that on the first day of class, Ryan made
up silly nicknames for each student in the seminar.
"It kind of set a precedent for how she interacted
with us for the rest of the class," Sellers said. "She was
just really interested in everyone."
Students in the class also got to see Ryan's ap
proach to poetry firsthand. Seller specifically remem
bered one day when Ryan brought in a collection of
poem drafts to class.
"I got a better insight into the way her brain
works," Sellers said. "She's such a technically impres
sive poet."
Nicholas Reiner 'lO, who has taken the Mohr Visit
ing Poet's course for the past three years, said that
Ryan's teaching style contrasted greatly with the
teaching styles of previous Mohr Visiting Poets Mark
Doty and Robert Bly.
"It's been staggering how different everybody's

been," Reiner said.
Although Ryan worked mostly with undergradu
ates during her time on campus, she did lead a craft
talk with the Stegner fellows in poetry, where she
"spoke about her own poetic craft," said Matthew
Siegel, a first-year Stegner Fellow in poetry.
"She's a really important voice right now," Siegel
continued. "She's really in a league of her own, doing
something very, very unique."
Ryan's poetry is known for being terse, insightful
and humorous.
"Kay Ryan's poems are as slim as runway models,
so tiny you could almost tweet them," wrote Dwight
Garner in the New York Times. "Their compact refine
ment, though, does not suggest ease or chic. Her voice
is quizzical and impertinent, funny in uncomfortable
ways, scuffed by failure and loss."
"She is a real advocate for voices that have been
maybe marginalized within the poetry world," said
John Evans, a second-year Stegner Fellow. "She's en-

gaged in a kind of poetry that is both fiercely intelli
gent, funny and kind of engaged with the imagination
in a kind of way that is really an exclusive thing in po
etry right now."
Siegel keeps Ryan's poem "Patience" displayed
next to the bathroom in his San Francisco apartment.
"She is, in away, an outsider that has been brought
into the inside," Siegel explained. "But in away that
still looks at it from afar."
Stegner Fellows have the opportunity to meet
many prominent writers who visit campus, an oppor
tunity that Siegel relishes.

"It's almost like make-believe," said Siegel. "These
people just come to you."
Next year's Mohr Visiting Poet will be Stephen
Dobyns. The following year, former U.S. Poet Laure
ate Louise Gluck will fill the appointment.
"We're lucky enough, because of this endowment,
to be able to bring these very different voices," said

Boland. "It's really astonishingly educative and inspir
ing for students."
Last week, Ryan gave her farewell reading at the
Library of Congress in Washington, D.C. for her sec
ond and final term as Poet Laureate.
