## SENSE AND NONSENSE Wittgenstein Is on My Mind 
### Aysha Bagchi 
This column originally ran on Feb. 5,2010.
At the end of a wonderful fall quarter in
Oxford, my Oxford tutor (i.e. my
teacher and mentor for the quarter)
recommended a biography to me by Ray
Monk titled "Ludwig Wittgenstein: The Duty
of Genius." Inspired by my time studying phi
losophy at such an ancient institution, I de
cided to read about the life of this Cambridge
philosopher over the break. Now, every
where I go and everything I do, Wittgenstein
is on my mind.
As I was visiting some of the more beauti
ful sights on my return to campus, a quotation
on a wall in MemChu caught my eye and, of
course, made me think of Wittgenstein. The
quote reads: "There is no narrowing so dead
ly as the narrowing of man's horizon of spiri
tual things... No widening of science, no pos
session of abstract truth can indemnify for an
enfeebled hold of the highest and central
truths of humanity. 'What shall a man give in
exchange for his soul?'"
In reading those words, I experienced a
halting feeling, as if I and the student body
more generally were being accused. The
lines were probably written with students in
mind, designed to warn against the supposed
dangerous forces within a university setting
that might stamp out the "spiritual" and nar
row us. Interestingly, I think Wittgenstein
would have echoed this warning, and as I re
flect anew on life at Stanford, I cannot help
feeling he had something to fear.
Wittgenstein is generally not regarded as
religious. A professor told me Wittgenstein
once wrote a friend an exasperated letter
when she sent him a Christmas card because
neither of them was Christian. Yet Wittgen
stein was very spiritual in the sense that he
valued human affectivity, holding a deep ap
preciation for the arts, for moral contempla
tion, and for sensitive human natures. He be
lieved the "darkness of this time" was direct
ly attributable to the worship of the "false
idol of science," and he found these modern
faults even in himself. In moments when he
felt too theoretical or "wise", he felt dead
ened, as if the spirit were being replaced by
machine.

For this reason, Wittgenstein normally ad
vised his students to leave the world of aca
demia and become doctors or manual labor
ers. Fie would say there was "no oxygen" at
Cambridge and they could not "breath" in
that setting, as if such a life in its intoler
ance for aspects of the human experience
that cannot be encapsulated by theory
would smother the human being. It was in the
arts and in moral reflection that Wittgenstein
found oxygen and felt human.
Do such reflections have bearing on our
own lives? Is the Stanford bubble oxygen
less? In many ways, Stanford is the reverse: it
is a place that enlivens students, exposing us
to an exciting environment of swarming
thoughts and ideas. But there is also a dead
ening effect inherent in our education. For
example, the undergraduate experience
leaves many students feeling like they are on
a conveyor belt in college, working because it
is what they have always done and are ex
pected to do. They see no point in it, yet they
trudge along.
Furthermore, some students show a lack

of value for the more "poetic" disciplines in
the humanities, perhaps because these fields
cannot be reduced to formulaic method. And
the specialized mindsets we develop in our
majors encourage this dismissal.
Consider, for example, Immanuel Kant's
famous reflection: "Two things fill my mind
with awe: the starry skies above and the
moral law within." A little knowledge of neu
roscience might tell us that feelings of awe
are particular chemical reactions in the brain;
evolutionary theory then reminds us that
we've developed these feelings because they
help advance the species; finally, philosophy
informs us that such statements are meaning
less in the first place. Pretty soon, Kant's feel
ing of awe becomes foreign, a language we
don't even speak. Our Stanford experience
risks distancing us from the affective, from
ourselves.
It is useful to remember that a lot of the
oxygen at Stanford comes from the outside.
In large, part, it is our study abroad and pub
lic service experiences that infuse Stanford
life with oxygen and student life with pur
pose. Students who study abroad or volun
teer often return to campus with a value for
the question of what is meaningful to them,
and they bring these emotional stirrings to
the table when they start to re-engage with
the rigors of academia.
The University generally seems to get this,
forcing humanities requirements on us early
and encouraging public service and study
abroad experiences. What it does not do is in
still in students an understanding of how
these things infuse oxygen into our educa
tion. Why is a "liberal" education important?
Alas, we may need Wittgenstein for this one.

Aysha thought about writing an ode to sleep
this week, but instead she decided to get some!
As it's her final column this volume, she wants
to say thanks to her fantastic editor, Emily, and
to everyone who sent her a note about a col
umn. She appreciates hearing your thoughts.
