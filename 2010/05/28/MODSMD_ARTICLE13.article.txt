## The 						dangers of steam tunneling 
### PHILIP PIZZO Dean, School of Medicine LAURA WILSON Chief Stanford Department of Public Safety 
It's been touted as one of the "top 100"
ways to have fun at Stanford University, but
students and the campus community need to
be aware that the unauthorized past time of
"tunneling" has caused some very real harm
and has the potential to cause more if the
practice is not discontinued.
About six weeks ago, a long-time employ
ee of the School of Medicine was out for a
lunchtime walk with a colleague along Santa
Teresa Street, enjoying the spring foliage and
birds. Without warning, she stepped into an
open manhole on a paved path. Fortunately,
she was able to catch herself before plum
meting all the way to the bottom nine feet
below. But the fall still resulted in several
bones broken in her leg and some fractured
ribs. She is still recovering and has endured
considerable pain and suffering as a result of
this totally unexpected and avoidable
injury. And it could have been even worse.
Had she not caught herself she could have
easily had a fatal fall.
After an investigation, the campus au
thorities responsible for the campus steam
tunnels and underground utility spaces de
termined that there was an unauthorized
entry into the manhole, and careless disre
gard for safety on the part of whoever left the
hole open.
There are additional reasons why an
unauthorized entry into the underground

utility spaces is unlawful and a trespassing
crime, punishable by prosecution and refer
ral to the university's Judicial Affairs system.
Dean Murray, associate director of ther
mal distribution systems for the campus,
notes that anyone entering the tunnels could
be exposed to serious safety hazards, includ
ing oxygen deficiency, toxic gases and other
dangers not easily detected by the senses.
Every year, about 100 worker fatalities in the
U.S. are linked to unsafe entry into such con
fined spaces (per the National Institute of
Occupational Safety and Health.) At Stan
ford, all personnel who enter the under
ground steam tunnel system are required to
be specifically trained and equipped to do so.
We agree with Dean Murray's assessment
that the risks of tunneling are simply not
worth it. We urge the student body to stop the
illicit and illegal practice. Each member of
the campus community should take responsi
bility to prevent friends from participating in
the dangerous tunneling activity, and recog
nize that it has unnecessarily caused great
bodily harm to a highly respected and valued
member of the university community.
