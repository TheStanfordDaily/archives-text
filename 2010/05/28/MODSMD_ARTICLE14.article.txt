# MIDNIGHT FRYER
## How to be a Woman (by American Media) 
### Yanran Lu 
As a girl who moved to the States when
she was 12 years old, I relied mostly
on the media to learn what it means
to be a woman. I have learned:
1. Shop 'till you drop. Spend! Consume!
Flaunt! To be "cool," you have to have an im
peccable wardrobe (so you can dress to im
press ... guys, that is). Blair and Serena's so
cial group from "Gossip Girl" have strict
dress codes adopted from the ever-changing
fashion runway and magazine spreads. Cher,
the protagonist in "Clueless," was blessed
with a lawyer daddy and consequently a
black card and a closet the size of my dorm
room. Whenever things go wrong, the cast of
"Sex and the City" can always rely on shoes
to lift their mood. After watching years of
American television, I finally got the mes
sage: women want shoes. When we want to
bond with other women, we go shopping.
When we feel sad, we go for retail therapy.
When we want to feel good, we splurge. As
Madonna declares, "I am a material girl...
living in a material world." Who needs politi
cal power, financial assets and other tiny de
tails, when we have the power to consume?

2. Ultimate Happiness = finding Mr. Right.
And, so what if the cast in "Sex and the City"
are successful career women in Manhattan
with all the clothes and shoes one could pos
sibly want? Their happiness still lies in find
ing Mr. Right, or in Carrie's case, securing
Mr. Big (which apparently is a continuous
struggle considering "Sex and the City 2" is
coming out). "Cougar Town" projects the
same message with the new divorcee Jules
trying to find the one while her friend Ellie is
happily married with the most understanding
husband. Let's not forget the bedtime stories
we have heard in childhood about the Prince
Charming who would come one day for our
"happily ever after." Even in the "cutting
edge" new Disney movie staring the first
black "princess," Tiana in "The Princess and
the Frog" chooses the prince out of love over
her childhood dream of owning a restaurant,

stating clearly the implication that a woman's
happiness lies with the love for a man and not
for a career.
3. Be Pro-Choice, but don't get an abortion.
Women love babies it is biological. And if
you are a woman and you don't love babies,
you are probably some deviant, cold-blood
ed workaholic who has attachment issues. A
good "proper," "well-bred" woman would
"naturally" want a family and baby as exem
plified by Charlotte in "SATC." And if by
some miracle, you get knocked up like Mi
randa, the heartbeats from the sonogram
ought to melt your heart and make you want
to keep the baby because god forbid, only
evil women can go through abortion. In fact,
no "good" woman has gone through abortion
on screen. In "Knocked Up," Alison (big sur
prise, a beautiful, skinny successful woman)
has a one-night stand with Ben (a pothead
and slacker whose appeal is at best below av
erage) and becomes pregnant because Ben
forgot to use a condom. The two decide to
keep the baby (big surprise) and eventually
fall in love following with Ben becoming
responsible (even a bigger surprise). Similar
ly in "Juno," a sixteen-year-old junior is im
pregnated, and after visiting Planned Parent
hood, decides to keep the baby (because she
is clearly not evil).
She goes through a nine-month pregnan
cy and gives the baby to an upper-class moth
er who undoubtedly will give the child a great
home. I thought the cinema was giving peo
ple high hopes in terms of finding Prince
Charming, but the picture painted for un
wanted pregnancy is even rosier; don't worry
if you accidentally get pregnant, you'll mirac
ulously fall in love with the father, or you'll
find a perfect home for the baby (even if you
don't, and the child stays with different foster
parents every month, s/he will still turn out to
be a hip and smart teenager like Lux from
"Life Unexpected"). P.S. You should still
have the right over your body but abor
tion is evil just saying.

So what does it mean to be an ideal 21st

century American woman? The media con
veys a fabulous/sexy/gorgeous woman with
an impeccable wardrobe longing for Mr.
Right and fulfilling her "duties" as a mother.
With the female voice-over, the women are
finally being heard. And the role models on
screen seem to say that all women think
about are dieting, shopping, men and babies.
Young women have the right to choose any
thing we want, though it seems like we want
nothing more than to be pretty and attract
the perfect man. Armed with retail power,
the "independent" woman still exists prima
rily to be a wife and mother. This is what
Susan Douglas calls "Enlightened Sexism"
sexism that has been repackaged to ap
pear to "empower" women through retail
power (and ironically sex appeal), while
claiming that feminism is no longer applica
ble when it clearly is.
