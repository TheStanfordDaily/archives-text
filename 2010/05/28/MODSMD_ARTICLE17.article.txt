## Appropriations gets fresh leadership Rafael Vasquez '12 elected committe chair 
### ELIZABETH TITUS MANAGING EDITOR 
The Appropriations Committee
is gearing up for one more round.
The committee, which is part of
the ASSU Undergraduate Senate
and holds some of the purse strings
of Stanford's hundreds of student
groups, is set to draft interim funding
policies for the 2010-11 school year
this week after former committee
chair Anton Zietsman 'l2 urged it on
Wednesday to move quickly.
The committee met late on Thurs
day, and is set to meet on Saturday to
hear early discretionary funding re
quests before most ASSU activity
settles for the summer, according to
Senate Chair Michael Cruz 'l2.
The guidelines, which are subject
to revision by each year's committee,
lay out what voluntary student or
ganizations (VSOs) may use general
and special fee money to do. Stu
dents groups are eligible to receive
up to $6,000 in general fees annually,
and 49 groups secured extra money
for next year more than $1.7 mil
lion in total in April's special fees
election, including The Daily.
Financial officers for student
groups must appear in front of the
Appropriations Committee before
their funding requests are put to a
vote of the entire Senate.
Funding policies were the topic of
some tension during Zietsman's
term. His committee was considered
somewhat strict in approving fund
ing requests; its policies ultimately
contributed to a lower spring quarter
refund rate and a lower project spe
cial fee charge per student next year.
Smaller procedural issues, howev
er, persisted. Up-to-date policies and
committee meeting minutes were
missing from the Senate's website for
part of the year, drawing complaints
from some financial officers. In Janu

ary, Zietsman called a special "re
view session" to revise the 2010-11
special fees funding policy and al
lowed a day of input before recom
mending the changes as final to the
Senate.
Zietsman at the time defended
that move, saying, "The policy review
process has been sort of very internal
to the Senate. It's not customary to
invite or notify all the financial offi
cers when reviewing policies year to
year."
His reminder to successors this
Wednesday showed different priori
ties, however: "GET VSO INPUT or
people will hate you," he wrote in an
e-mail to ASSU leaders.
His successors on the committee
include Senators Madeline Hawes
'l3, Ben Jensen 'l2, Stewart Macgre
gor-Dennis 'l3, Kamil Saeid 'l3, Car
olyn Simmons 'l3, Juany Torres 'l3
and Rafael Vasquez *l2, who were
named on Tuesday after ranking
their interests in the Senate's five
committees. The committee will
choose its own chairperson.
Hawes is also the deputy chair of
the Senate, where each of the com
mittee members is serving his or her
first term.
Cruz, the Senate's only second
term member, served on the Appro
priations Committee this year. Tor
res attended many committee meet
ings as a Senate associate, according
to Zietsman.
Of the interim policies the group
will draft this week, "probably they'll
be similar to the policies used last
year," Cruz said.
Adam Beberg, a doctoral student
in computer science who is involved
with the Graduate Student Council,
wished the new Senate well ahead of
the last-minute Appropriations ac
tivity: "Good luck in 2010-11 (and on
finals)," he wrote to senators. "It's
going to be a busy year for the ASSU
as the state, county, and city go broke
and that squeezes students."
