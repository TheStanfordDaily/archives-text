## FALLING BACK 
### JACOB JAFFE MANAGING EDITOR 
The Stanford baseball team fell in
the first game of its final series of the
season last night, 4-2 to No. 3 Arizona
State.
Cardinal pitchers did a fairly good
job of keeping the potent Sun Devil
offense in check, but Stanford bat

ters could not back up their pitchers.
Sophomore Stanford starter
Brett Mooneyham had a strong out
ing, going seven innings and allowing
only three runs while striking out
seven, but he received little run sup
port and picked up the loss.
The Cardinal offense got off to a
good start, scoring a run in each of
the first two innings. The first came

on a solo home run by junior second
Colin Walsh to give Stanford the
early 1-0 lead. After the Sun Devils
tied the game in the top of the second
on a pair of doubles, the Cardinal re
turned the favor. A pair of juniors,
shortstop Jake Schlander and right
fielder Dave Giuliani, began the bot
tom of the second with back-to-back
doubles to give Stanford another

one-run lead at 2-1.
Although five of the first eight
Cardinal batters reached base on
four hits and a hit-by-pitch, Stanford
could not muster much offense the
rest of the way. Sun Devil starter Seth
Blair rebounded from early struggles
to shut down the Cardinal offense.
Stanford managed only four more
hits over the next five innings against

Blair, and ASU's relievers had similar
success.

The Cardinal had no extra-base
hits after the consecutive doubles in
the second, and Stanford finished with
nine hits and just the two early runs.
The Arizona State bullpen picked
up where Blair left off, as the combi
nation of Mitchell Lambson and Jor
dan Swagerty held the Stanford of
fense down in the final three innings,
allowing only one base-runner.

Meanwhile, Arizona State could
not break through for any big innings
on offense, but the Sun Devil batters
chipped away enough to get the win.
Arizona State scored a single run
in the second, third and fourth in
nings to take a 3-2 lead, and that lead
proved to be enough. The Sun Devils
tacked on an unearned ninth-inning
run on an RBI single by center field
er Johnny Ruettiger, who was one of
five ASU batters with two hits.
Stanford's offense was spread
around, as eight of its nine regulars
had a hit. Freshman outfielder and
leadoff hitter Tyler Gaffney was the
only Cardinal batter with two hits,
while Walsh added two walks to his
home run.
For Arizona State, four different
batters knocked in a run, and four
different batters scored a run.
Junior catcher Zach Jones started
the game behind the plate, but he was
hit on the hand in a bunt attempt in
his first at-bat and was forced to
leave the game. His availability for
the rest of the series is unknown, and
he is listed as day-to-day.
Stanford has two more chances to
improve its positioning in both the
Pac-10 standings and for the NCAA
postseason. Tonight, the Cardinal
will take on the Sun Devils at 5:30
p.m. The final regular-season game
for both teams will be tomorrow at 1
p.m. Both games will take place at
Sunken Diamond.

With its loss to Arizona State, Stanford will have a tough time improving its conference record and finishing in the Pac-10's top three. The Cardinal offense
struggled against Sun Devil pitching, with starter Seth Blair shutting down the lineup after it scored two early runs. ASU's relievers were similarly effective.
