### â€“ Kabir Sawhney 
In its final award for the year, the
American Volleyball Coaches Associ
ation (AVCA) announced on
Wednesday that it has chosen to
award the men's volleyball National
Coach of the Year honor to John
Kosty, head coach of Stanford men's
volleyball team.
Kosty completed his fourth season
as Stanford's head coach this past
spring. He guided Stanford's program
to its first NCAA championship since
1997 with a straight-set win over Penn
State at Maples Pavilion in the title
match.
When he took over in 2006, Kosty
inherited a program in disarray. His
team went 3-25 in his first season and
finished last in the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation (MPSF). This sea
son, Kosty engineered a 21-win turn
around.
In making its announcement, the
AVCA said, "The taskmaster was

able to gradually build his program
each year, successfully completing a
'worst to first' journey."
In his four years at the helm, Kosty
has compiled a 62-53 overall mark.
Kosty's award is another in a long
line of honors bestowed upon the Car
dinal by the AVCA this year. Senior
setter Kawika Shoji was named the
AVCA National Player of the Year
prior to the NCAA Tournament, be
coming the second Stanford player to
earn the distinction.
Four Stanford players also earned
All-America honors from the AVCA.
Kawika Shoji, sophomore libera Erik
Shoji and sophomore outside hitter
Brad Lawson all won first-team hon
ors, while senior opposite Evan
Romero received second-team honors.
