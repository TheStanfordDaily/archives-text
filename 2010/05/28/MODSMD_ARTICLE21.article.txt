# The 						possibilities for conference changes

ith football season
just around the cor
ner, I believe now is a

W W good time to evalu
ate the proposal that
has the biggest potential to reshape the
college football world as we know it.
I'm talking, of course, about the Big
Ten's rumored plans to expand to 12,
14 or 16 teams from its current 11.

To start, let's go through the most
likely scenarios and see how expansion
would affect the five other power con
ferences and Notre Dame, as well as
the four biggest non-AQ schools
Boise State, Utah,TCU and BYU.
In what is perhaps the ideal sce
nario for the Big Ten, Notre Dame
would finally shed its status as an inde
pendent program in football and join
the conference, bringing the rest of its
athletic program from the Big East
along with it. The Fighting Irish would
(almost literally) bring pots of gold to
the conference, instantly expanding
the Big Ten's footprint and the amount
of revenue flowing to each school.
The addition of Notre Dame would
also elevate the Big Ten Network,
which brings in a large chunk of the
conference's revenue. The network
could negotiate better rates from cable
providers and could expand the num
ber of homes that it reaches, consider
ably boosting its cash intake. Notre
Dame's nationwide fan base, which
would watch pretty much any Irish-re
lated coverage on the network, would
put the BTN in an excellent bargaining
position.

However, Notre Dame athletic di
rector Jack Swarbrick has repeatedly
said that the Golden Domers are com
mitted to maintaining the football pro
gram's conference independence.
Aside from keeping its rich tradition,

Notre Dame would have to forfeit
some of its more lucrative endeavors,
like its contract with NBC to televise
all Fighting Irish home games and its
rivalry games against opponents out
side the Big Ten (like Stanford and
USC).

The most likely scenario then be
comes a three-team expansion to 14
schools, since no single school aside
from Notre Dame can bring in enough
money to justify expansion. The Big
Ten would raid the Big East and the
Big 12 to add members; so far, the
three names most often mentioned
have been Rutgers, Syracuse and Mis
souri. Rutgers and Syracuse would
bring the lucrative New York City tele
vision market with them into the con
ference, while Missouri would push the
conference further into the Midwest
region. Added revenue would come
from the network pushing into more
markets, as well as the ability to hold an
annual championship game to deter
mine the school's Rose Bowl team.

This expansion might spell the
death of the Big East as a football con
ference, as it would be reduced to a
mere six teams. It's not entirely clear
how that conference would wind up
after losing two of its programs. On the
other hand, the Big 12 would almost
certainly go after one of the four non
major conference programs most
likely TCU or Utah to fill the gap
left by Missouri.
Though indirectly, such a change

could also prompt the Pac-10 to ex
pand to 12 teams, in order to keep up
with the other power conferences and
stage a championship game. BYU,
Colorado, Utah and Boise State are all
possibilities to be added to the Pac-10,
although the ramifications of expan
sion would continue to affect other
conferences.

The only possibility left, a 16-team
superconference, is highly unlikely.
The only way I can see that happening
is if Texas is convinced to leave the Big
12, bringing Texas A&M along with it.
However, Texas has been the target of
overtures from other conferences be
fore (including the Pac-10), and there
is no indication that it is leaning toward
jumping out of the Big 12.

In the end, I believe conference ex
pansion will happen, and that it won't
be such a bad thing. Bigger confer
ences would bring the Boise States of
the world into the BCS system, so they
can play full schedules against major,
conference competition and earn
berths into the BCS National Champi
onship game without any doubts as to
their qualifications. For us at Stanford,
it would also be nice to see some new
teams every year. With nine out of 12
games on the schedule against the
same schools year after year, it gets a
little boring.
In an ideal world, we would ditch
this BCS system altogether and come
up with something better, like a playoff.
Unfortunately, that proposal isn't hap
pening anytime soon, because the BCS,
just like conference expansion, is driv
en by a single factor: money.

Kabir Sawhney considers three full
months "around the corner." Complain
