# My final reflections on sports
## 
### Danny Belch On My Mind 
This will be officially the last
column I write for The Stan
ford Daily. I started writing
columns in the fall of 2007. It
has been a wonderful three
year journey.

I have written about everything in
this space for three years, from Stanford
sports and Stanford fans to why I think
the NBA is boring to why Venus and
Serena Williams in women's tennis are
bigger than Tiger in golf, Peyton in foot
ball or Kobe/Le√üron in basketball.

I would like to let anyone who reads
this column know why I have written it.
It's because I wrote about sports. I
wrote about one of my passions in life.
Sure, I enjoy playing and watching
sports with my friends and family. I was
a three-sport varsity athlete in high
school and have spent the last four years
as a member of the Stanford track and
field team. So I have definitely put in my
time as an athlete and as a competitor.
But my passion for sports extends far
beyond the game.

The mental and emotional sides of
sports are what draw me in. The feeling
you get when in competition, in the
heat of the moment, in a situation
where you put everything on the line.
The pain of losing something you
worked so hard for the elation of
winning and the justification of all the
hours, days, months, years of practice
the feelings of "that's what it was all
for," "that's why you never quit" and
"this will pay off later.
I am not a sport-a-holic. I watch and
play a lot of sports but rarely can I quote
statistics, tell you about the players' per
sonal lives or recite the encyclopedia of
records. My interaction and experience
with sports is on a deeper level.
I have a personal mantra that I be
lieve you can tell a whole lot about a
person by 1) the people they surround
themselves with and 2) the way they
carry themselves when playing sports.
In my eyes, sports can cast a light
straight through you and illuminate
your character for the world to see.
How someone reacts to a loss or a win:
Do they make an excuse? Do they cry?
Do they rub it in someone's face? Do
they shake hands? Do they hold their
head up? How invested someone is in
what they are doing: How much prac
tice have they done? How prepared are
they for what they will face? Do they
play with intensity or are they half-ass
ing? How someone accepts something
that doesn't fall their way: Do they com
plain? Do they argue? Do they take it
and move on? Does it motivate them to
play harder? Does it deflate them?
These questions are the ones that I
constantly have asked myself and oth
ers that I see playing sports. They are
questions that, if you remove sports
and put in any other life situation, de
fine who I am and who I want to be as
a person.

I appreciate sports for what they can
do for people. How they can bring out
sides of people not normally seen. How
they can create a family-like atmos
phere. How they breed friendship, pas
sion, self-confidence and discipline. All
the teams, players, games, seasons,
drama, scandals, injuries and news are
really just the tip of the iceberg for me.
Behind all that is the relationship I can
forge between sports and my personal
character. I can use each to fuel, enlight
en and improve the other. Some of the
greatest lessons I have learned in life
have been from sports.
So I leave my column, my readers
and Stanford with one of my favorite
lessons I have learned from sports. It's
something that I try to live by. I definite
ly have moments where I forget it, but
for the most part I'm on par. Take it or
leave it, just like with everything I have
written in the past.
I would like to tell you to not make
excuses and to not complain.
Things are never always going to go
your way. Sometimes you just won't have
it. Sometimes your teammate just won't
have it. Sometimes the ref or umpire will
make a call that was bad or you don't
agree with. Sometimes you will face a
better opponent. Sometimes you'll just
have some bad luck. Sometimes you will
miss. Sometimes you will fail.
But don't complain about it. Don't
sit there and feel sorry for yourself.
Don't create a world in which you never
did anything wrong, in which you are al
ways the good guy. Don't blame others
when you may be equally at fault. Don't
refuse to admit you made a mistake.
Don't refuse to come up short.

Because that is where we shine.
How we respond to adversity, how we
bounce back from a tough time. When
you get knocked down, it's the way we
get back up. It's that hunger to get bet
ter. It's that desire to achieve more than
you achieved yesterday. It does not and
should not have to come at the price of

egoism, arrogance or selfishness. In
stead, it can come with intensity, enthu
siasm and willingness to bring a group
closer together if it means the achieve
ment of a common goal. This is not say
ing to block out any negative emotion
that you may want to feel. Go ahead
and feel it. It's good for you. Just know
that there is away to come out of it, to
come out and to thrive.
My favorite sports victory is a grind
it-out victory. Not an easy victory, a
coast, something on par with a warm
up. It's a game in which teams and indi

viduals are struggling to best one an
other. Both suffer small victories and
small setbacks within the game. It's
hard for both teams. It's painful and it's
tiring. When you watch you are on the
edge of your seat because you don't
know how they are going to respond
and react out there. The winner is the
one that doesn't give up, that accepts
losing small battles in order to win the
war. The winner is the one that knows
that a champion is not perfect, but
flawed in many ways. The winner is the
one who takes blemishes on a piece of

artwork and uses them to create a new
masterpiece.

I urge you to think about this just a
bit. You can take it anywhere you go; it
doesn't have to stick to the playing field.
My writing about sports may end
here, but my playing and believing will
continue far beyond this page. I hope
yours does too.
