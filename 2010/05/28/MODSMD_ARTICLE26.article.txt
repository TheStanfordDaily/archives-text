What would you do to
make your dreams come
true? Would you sign
over your life to the public domain?
Would you be willing to work
toward your goal while the world is
literally watching your every move?
On March 2, 2010, Hulu pre
miered "If I Can Dream." Created
by "American Idol" producer
Simon Fuller, "If I Can Dream"
(IICD) marks the first ever TV
program to be broadcast directly
and exclusively to Hulu. The show
follows the lives of five aspiring
artists who have taken their first
steps to stardom and embarked
upon a mission to fulfill their
hearts' desires. But lICD is not
just another reality show. Instead,
the show capitalizes on the possi
bilities afforded by modern tech
nology to create links between the
participants and viewers and
transform the show into a truly
interactive, hyper-reality experi
ence.
The five young hopefuls
Alex Lambert, Ben Elliott, Justin
Gaston, Giglianne Braga and Kara
Killmer left their old lives
behind them and moved into the
"Dream House," a plush residence
in the Hollywood Hills, where
they are placed under the con
stant scrutiny of the cameras that
line the walls of their bedrooms,
living room, kitchen and even the
communal car. The cameras are
meant to document the journey
of these participants, who will live
and work in the house until they
have secured a successful career
for themselves. A collection of
celebrities and other individuals
trying to make it in the entertain
ment industry including ex
"Idol" contestants Casey James
and Michael Lynch, celebrity
blogger Perez Hilton and TV per
sonality Jason Kennedy also
visit the Dream House periodical
ly to give the participants guid
ance and advice. Viewers of the
show can tune in at any time to
watch and listen to a live online
feed of the house, as the five
"Dreamers" work to accomplish
their goals. The website provides
viewers with the location of the
Dream House residents at all
times, along with several views of
each room of the house so that
the Dreamers are always in sight.
As if this set-up does not give

viewers enough of a window into
the Dreamers' lives, anyone can
also contact the Dreamers on
their respective Twitter, Facebook
and MySpace accounts, and watch
them as they respond online (par
ticularly during "Live Tweet
Sessions," which function as one
way video conferences, where the
participants respond on camera
to questions that viewers Tweet
in). This format gives the audi
ence access to the show's partici
pants 24/7 literally, you can
even watch them sleep! in what
can only be described as a sort of
real-life Sims game. In case view
ers and fans miss anything on the
live feed, an episode compiling
the highlights of the video stream
and events outside of the house is
released on Hulu every week.
So who are these "Dreamers"
and what makes them worth
watching? There's Alex Lambert,
the youngest and most famous of
the "IICD" participants. After
being eliminated from "American
Idol" just shy of making the Top
12, he's already released two
demos during his time at the
Dream House, and he appears to
be well on his way to achieving

his goal of playing throughout the
nation. Justin Gaston, possibly
most famous for his stint as Miley
Cyrus' boyfriend, also aspires to
be a singer. Although he has
already made a name for himself
by competing in "Nashville Star,"
modeling for Armani and starring
as the sultry "Romeo" in the
music video for Taylor Swift's
"Love Story," he's looking to
encounter the world more on his
own terms, and it may not be
long before he's famous in his
own right. Hailing from
Hamburg, N.Y., 23-year-old is
Ben Elliott, who dreams of one
day starring in films alongside the
likes of Johnny Depp and
Leonardo DiCaprio. Although
Ben had minimal acting training
before entering the house, the ex
model has arguably made the
most progress toward achieving
his dream during his time on the
show. He has already starred in
the music video for Orianthi's lat
est song, "Shut Up & Kiss Me,"
and honed his acting skills with
drama guru John Kirby.
The first of the two girls is
Kara Killmer, who also dreams of
being a famous actress. The 21-

year-old Texan just graduated
with a degree in Performing Arts
from Baylor University, and shows
a clear dedication to her craft.
Last but not least is 20-year-old
Giglianne Braga, whose glowing
beauty lends itself perfectly to her
dream career: modeling. Before
joining the cast of "lICD," the
Brazilian-American knockout
worked for a catering company in
New Jersey, where she lived with
her mother. While on the show,
Giglianne has already landed a gig
presenting the Young Hollywood
Awards alongside fellow Dreamer
Lambert, as well as starring oppo
site Elliott in Orianthi's "Shut Up
& Kiss Me."
Regardless of public percep

tion of the show and its partici
pants, "If I Can Dream" is unde
niably unique in its extreme inte
gration of social media and tech
nology into the narrative of the
show. The entirely Internet-based
format has exciting implications
for the future of television and
the entertainment industry as a
whole. Most importantly, it drives
home a compelling message for
the youth of today: if you can
dream it, you can do it.

own right. Hailing from
Hamburg, N.Y., 23-year-old is
Ben Elliott, who dreams of one
day starring in films alongside the
likes of Johnny Depp and
Leonardo DiCaprio. Although
Ben had minimal acting training
before entering the house, the ex
model has arguably made the
most progress toward achieving
his dream during his time on the
show. He has already starred in
the music video for Orianthi's lat
est song, "Shut Up & Kiss Me,"
and honed his acting skills with
drama guru John Kirby.
The first of the two girls is
Kara Killmer, who also dreams of
being a famous actress. The 21-

year-old Texan just graduated
with a degree in Performing Arts
from Baylor University, and shows
a clear dedication to her craft.
Last but not least is 20-year-old
Giglianne Braga, whose glowing
beauty lends itself perfectly to her
dream career: modeling. Before
joining the cast of "lICD," the
Brazilian-American knockout
worked for a catering company in
New Jersey, where she lived with
her mother. While on the show,
Giglianne has already landed a gig
presenting the Young Hollywood
Awards alongside fellow Dreamer
Lambert, as well as starring oppo
site Elliott in Orianthi's "Shut Up
& Kiss Me."
Regardless of public percep

tion of the show and its partici
pants, "If I Can Dream" is unde
niably unique in its extreme inte
gration of social media and tech
nology into the narrative of the
show. The entirely Internet-based
format has exciting implications
for the future of television and
the entertainment industry as a
whole. Most importantly, it drives
home a compelling message for
the youth of today: if you can
dream it, you can do it.
