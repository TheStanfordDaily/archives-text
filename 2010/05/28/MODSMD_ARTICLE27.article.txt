# "American Idol:" The End of an Era?

cc American Idol" it's more
than just another TV show
or a singing competition. Its
logo has been emblazoned on
countless items of merchandise,
its contestants revered and emu
lated and its opening theme song
stuck in the heads of its millions
of viewers. In short, "Idol" has
become a monumental media
icon that has been ingrained in
the nation's primetime TV sched
ule for nearly a decade.
This year marked the ninth
season of the show, and it was one
of the most memorable seasons to
date. Although this season was
not the strongest in terms of tal
ent, it was remarkable for a myri
ad of reasons. Possibly the most
evident change was the loss of
Paula Abdul as a judge on the
show, and her replacement with
talk-show guru Ellen Degeneres.
To further shake up the "Idol"
scheme of things, this season was
also Simon's last time sitting on

the panel of judges. These were
only the most obvious changes to
the framework of "American
Idol," though Ryan Seacrest's
oddly quirky behavior, Kara
DioGuardi's crush on "Idol" con
tender Casey James, the pro
longed presence of the ever-smil
ing contestant "Teflon Tim" and
the remarkably low ratings of the
show also deserve honorable
mentions.
Following one of the
strongest "Top Four" groups in
the history of the show from
Season Eight, the finalists of
Season Nine had a tough act to
follow. After the elimination of
some great talent early on, the
final two came down to rocker
Lee DeWyze and folk-singer
Crystal Bowersox. The two faced
off during a somewhat bland
finale on Tuesday, May 25, and
fought to win the title of the next
"American Idol." The two 24-year
olds had both auditioned in

Chicago in the summer of 2009,
and made the long journey to the
finale together. It seemed fitting
that these two were the last ones
standing both had remained
humble and true to their respec
tive styles throughout the compe
tition, for which they consistently
garnered the praise of the judges.
The finale, however, was
quite anticlimactic, with the two
contestants performing well but
without much flair or pizzazz.
Each contestant was given the
chance to sing three songs: the
first to be selected from their past
song choices, the second chosen
by the executive producer of the
show and the final to be the single
the contestant would release if
they won. Opening the show, Lee
DeWyze chose to sing "The
Boxer," his song from the "inspi
rational songs" week. He was met
with lukewarm comments from
the judges, with Simon summa
rizing his performance as a "kiss
on the cheek when [he] wanted a
kiss on the lips," and Kara urging
Lee to "punch harder" and add
more energy to his following two
performances. Crystal got the
judges on her side with her first
song, "Me and Bobby McGee,"
which Randy predictably deemed
"dope" and Ellen called "stun
ning."
For his second song,
"Everybody Hurts" by REM, Lee
received somewhat better feed
back from the judges, with Kara
commending him for being "emo
tionally accessible" and Simon
proclaiming the song to be a
"brilliant choice [for him]."
Crystal returned with a rendition
of "Black Velvet" that wowed the
judges, causing Randy to pro
claim, "Mama Sox is in it to win
it!" Finally, Lee rounded off his
performances with his version of
the U2 track "Beautiful Day," after
which Simon skimmed over Lee's
actual singing and instead
expressed how much he liked Lee
as a person. Crystal Bowersox
wrapped up the show with a very
heartfelt performance of a song
entitled "Up On The Mountain,"
which nearly left the judges in
tears. After Kara gave an emotion
al spiel about Crystal being "com
pletely emotionally invested in the
song," Simon gave his last ever
"Idol" critique, simply calling
Crystal's performance "outstand-

ing.
Unfortunately, the results
night of the two-part finale was
no more exciting than the per
formances had been. The entire
night was a smorgasbord of short
appearances by a very random
collection of celebrities and past
"Idol" contestants, many of whom
paid homage to Simon Cowell in
some shape or form. Highlights of
the night included a performance
by the Top 12, who emerged in
scanty school uniforms and per
formed with Alice Cooper, a
Christina Aguilera medley by the
girls of the Top 12, after which
Christina herself sang, and an
appearance by Kris Allen, who
performed his new single, "The
Truth." These acts were followed
by an extended mish-mash med
ley performed by a mix of the Top
12 contestants and other famous
singers like Michael Mac Donald
and Barry Gibbs. Before finding
out who won, viewers had to sit
through an eternity of tributes
and goodbyes to the man every
one loves to hate, Simon Cowell.
Among the most notable of these
goodbyes was a teary message
from ex-judge Paula Abdul, a

humorous farewell from Ricky
Gervais and a performance by
past "Idol" winners dedicated to
the British powerhouse. After all
possible methods of extending the
length of the show were exhaust
ed, Ryan Seacrest finally
announced the unsurprising ver
dict: Lee DeWyze is the new
American Idol.
Never fear, Crystal will no
doubt have a successful career of
her own, following the trend of
past "Idol" winners and runners
up. With Simon and Paula gone,
and the show receiving the lowest
ratings since 2002, rumor has it
that the success of "Idol" may
have finally run its course. (Then
again, critics said the same of
Madonna decades ago, and she's
still around!) Whatever the future
may hold for the franchise, there
is no doubt that "American Idol"
has been one of the most cele
brated and well-known shows of
all time. For now, until next year,
so long, "Idol," and thank you for
the music.
