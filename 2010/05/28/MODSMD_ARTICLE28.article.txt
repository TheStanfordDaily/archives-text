# 3 Quarters of Finding Synonyms for Tasty

In the world of professional food
reviewing (a world which I
emphatically don't inhabit; spo
radic word vomit about barbeque
does not Ruth Reichl make), it can
be easy to get so immersed tracking
down the perfect truffle emulsion
that the food world's elite lose sight
of the fact that eating is, above all,
an issue of social justice. And while
it's fun to watch Tom Colicchio crit
icize wannabe "Top Chefs" and then
spend $6 on yogurt at Fraiche (both
key to the Stanford foodie lifestyle),
one similarly loses sight of reality
while practicing these habits. At the
end of the day, access to nutritional,
adequate supplies of food is a cru
cial challenge of survival for the
world's poor.
My senior year of high school, I
won an essay contest and was able
to attend Slow Food Nation. The
event was a weekend-long, festival
meets-colloquium to promote

reforms in a food system character
ized by environmental destruction,
64-ounce Big Gulps, E. coli out
breaks, depreciation of local food
cultures and the dismantlement of
once sacrosanct family mealtimes.
Slow Food, an international move
ment that works against perceived
failings in modern food culture,
hosted the weekend; the movement
began in Italy in response to the
proposed opening of a McDonald's
on the steps of the Vatican. Slow
Food has since become a chief
leader of this century's burgeoning
food movement. I spent a perfect
Saturday afternoon at an impro
vised fairground overlooking the
Golden Gate Bridge. I sampled arti
san-produced foods from around
the world. I remember spending 20
minutes at a small-scale pickle
grower out of the East Bay, learning
about the horrors of industrial
pickle production and munching on

perfect cornichons. An olive oil som
melier (really, these exist) gave me a
crash-course introduction to
Northern California's finest olive
oils. One of the founders of a com
pany selling the Tibetan elixir
Kombucha urged me to try their
strange yeast-based drink, which I
embarrassingly spat out (word to
the wise: don't try Kombucha). It
was the best day ever.
But eventually I had to leave
the shiny white tents of Slow Food
Nation and return home. Going
from the event to the nearest bus
stop, I walked past a homeless man
digging through a trashcan for
food. He'd just fished out a half
eaten piece of chocolate cake still in
its Styrofoam packaging. I looked
down at the sample pack of artisan
pickles I'd managed to snag for free
(retail value $l2) and realized that
somewhere along the way, some
thing had gone terribly awry with
the food movement.
It's so trendy right now to love
food not just in a "gluttonous

fast-food guzzling" way, but also in
a "shopping at Whole Foods, know
ing the names of celebrity chefs and
blogging about the cupcakes you
make in your Cowell Cluster
kitchen" kind of way. Like so many
others in the Stanford community
and the greater Bay Area, I truly
love food as a rarefied aesthetic
experience. But it's important to
look up from your cup of freshly
brewed Blue Bottle coffee (hand
crafted in Emeryville using 19th
century roasting techniques, $lB a
pound) and remember that one in
six people on Earth are undernour
ished. Today alone, 25,000 people
will die of hunger. Rates of Type-II
diabetes and obesity have risen
stratospherically, especially among
children in less privileged American
communities.
As my final food article this
year, I sat down to write not this
long-winded diatribe, but about the
small taco counter at Mi Pueblo
Supermarket. Mi Pueblo is the first
grocery store to operate in East Palo

Alto in three decades. Before Mi
Pueblo opened this past November,
East Palo Alto residents had little to
no access to fresh produce within a
community that has long struggled
with poverty and high crime rates.
The town now has easy access to
fresh fruit, vegetables and every
thing else you could possibly want
in a grocery store, including pretty
good tacos that everyone should go
check out. It's proof that even in
Stanford's backyard, access to nutri
tious food is a critical social justice
issue. I hope my foray into restau
rant reviewing has highlighted a few
really good places to eat around
campus and maybe even sparked a
love of food in a few unsuspecting
Daily readers. It's certainly taken me
to a lot of cool new restaurants and
given me the chance to share some
old favorites. But at the end of the
day, I hope the Stanford community

understands that food is so much
more than an aesthetic pleasure.
Reforming the food system may
well be the social justice issue of our
generation.

about ending global hunger should

Supermarket is located at 1731 East

and shopping there helps support a
real asset to the East Palo Alto com
