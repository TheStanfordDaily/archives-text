# Summer Music Festivals
##

It's no secret. Palo Alto isn't the
liveliest of destinations if you're
looking for some musical invig
oration. Shoreline Amphitheatre

aside, a decent music venue is hard
to come by in college town suburbia
and Palo Alto is more of a fly-by
than anything else on bands' jour

neys to The City by the Bay.
Summer sure doesn't help
either.
For those staying on campus
from June to August, finding any
form of entertainment audio or
otherwise is a daunting task.
With the student population dwin
dled to a few clusters living in
Wilbur, Mirrielees and the odd Row
House, on-campus happenings
EPGY mixers aside are hard to
come by and Palo Alto becomes a
little more constricting. There are
only so many times you can walk
up and down University Avenue.
So if you need to scratch your
itch for good music or just get away
from the palm trees and the burbs,
here are a couple summer options.
None require the time or financial
commitment of a Bonnaroo or
Lollapalooza, and they all provide
some form of escape within an
hour's commute.
ETD POP 2010
For those unable to wait for
summer, ETD POP 2010 may pro
vide a little static sampler before
finals week. Scheduled to take place
this Saturday at Cow Palace, the
13th annual installation of the festi
val will look to turn the legendary
venue into an electronic fortress.
Organizers expect the 10,000+
capacity venue to be packed for
artists from Dim Mak golden boy
Steve Aoki, to European trance king
Armin Van Buuren. This year's festi
val, labeled "The Dream," will also

feature Benny Benassi, Stanford
favorites LA Riots and the always
entertaining Infected Mushroom.
General admission tickets are on
sale now for $7O a pop and festival
doors open at 4:00 p.m. on
Saturday.
BFD 2010
Finals are overrated anyways,
right? For those able to squeeze
some time out of their busy sched
ules during the Sunday of finals
week, BFD 2010 at Shoreline
Amphitheatre may be a worthwhile
diversion. Not only does the festival
feature the reincarnation of L.B.C.
legends Sublime, but also the latest
in indie, electronic, punk and rock.
Among the other headliners include
Deffones and Silversun Pickups,
while familiar names such as Spoon
and Against Me! fill up slots on the
de facto side stage. Also popular will
be the Subsonic Tent with acts like
Matt & Kim, Toxic Avenger and The
Limousines. Tickets are still on sale
for the one-day event.
Popscene
No, it's not just a summer
thing, but Popscene may be one of
the most underrated music scenes
in the Bay Area. Over the years, the
Bay Area venue has provided indie
enthusiasts with an intimate setting
to see up-and-coming acts for a pal
try price. Among the names on an
endless list of those who have
graced Popscene's stage include Bloc
Party, Death Cab for Cutie and

Vampire Weekend. The early sum
mer lineup at the 330 Ritch Street
fixture is just as promising with acts
for June including Delorean,
Delphic and Hot Hot Heat. Most
tickets can be purchased at the door
or online at www.popscene-sf.com.
Outside Lands Music and Arts
Festival
In its third year of operation,
Outside Lands is scaling back slight
ly. This year's festival is scheduled to
take place over two days instead of
the usual three on Aug. 14 and 15 in
Golden Gate Park. But while they've
cut the festival a day short, organiz
ers don't seem to be holding back in
booking acts. Kings of Leon have
already confirmed their appearance
while Phoenix, Arcade Fire and A1
Green are among some of the more
high-profile rumors. The full lineup
will be released on June 1, and
advance two-day tickets should be

available shortly thereafter.
Stern Grove Festival
Who said the best things in life
aren't free? Every year since 1938,
the Stern Grove Festival Association
has been providing an admission
free performing arts series featuring
some of the most diverse acts from
the Bay Area community. Located,
as always, at Sigmund Stern Grove,
the festival will take place from June
20 to Aug. 22. In a display of its
characteristic diversity, festival
organizers have booked everyone
from the San Francisco Opera on
July 4 to They Might Be Giants and
Rogue Wave in late August. A com
plete calendar of the free events can
be found online at www.stern
grove.org.
