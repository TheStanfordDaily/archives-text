## Surplus projected for budget Provost John Etchemendy presents annual report 
### JOANNA XU SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Provost John Etchemendy Ph.D. 'B2
presented Stanford's annual budget re
port for 2010-2011 on Thursday before
the Faculty Senate, saying the financial
pressures on the University resulting
from economic instability in 2008 were
showing signs of lifting.
Etchemendy summarized the endow
ment decline and anticipated loss in en
dowment payouts in excess of $2OO mil
lion, as well as the University's suspen
sion of the traditional endowment
smoothing formula. Etchemendy also
highlighted that the University chose not
to shrink financial aid programs in light of
the financial declines.

"The capital budget for next year is
projected to decrease from $649 million
to $368 million as projects are complet
ed," Etchemendy said. "However, a num
ber of projects have also been reactivat
ed, including the Bing Concert Hall,
Madera Grove and the child care center."

As for the consolidated budget for op
erations, revenues were actually up 2.6
percent averaged over the past two years.

"It doesn't cancel inflation, but it does
n't explain the turmoil we went through,"
Etchemendy said.
Income from students was up 3.9 per
cent after the tuition was hiked 3.5 per
cent in 2009. However, financial aid out
puts accounted for half of what the Uni
versity pulled in for undergraduate tu
ition. Furthermore, outputs to support
graduates accounted for another $285
million of outlays.
"Basically, we ought to get out of the
student business," Etchemendy joked.
Nonetheless, need-based financial aid
is expected to decrease in the coming
years as the economy improves and the
families of students have less need.

On the other hand, while University
research funding has been relatively
steady over the past 10 years, this is most
ly due to research funding receipts from
American Recovery and Reinvestment
Act (ARRA). Etchemendy expressed
concern that this funding was not sustain
able.

"As you can see, without ARRA our
research funding has basically been flat,
and adjusted for inflation, research fund
ing would have gone down,"
Etchemendy said.
"As for what the future holds, my
guess is the country is probably not
going to be able to support [it]," he
added. "I hope that's wrong, but that's
a big worry going forward."
The budget for general funds,
which are budgeted centrally, was pro
jected to have a $26 million-surplus in
non-formula general cuts; the biggest
priority for the general funds budget
the past two years was to support the
schools whose endowments had
dropped significantly. The general
funds helped to fill some of that gap.
However, even with general funds
used to plug up some of the monetary
holes in financial aid and endowment
mitigation, a surplus was projected
for the coming two years.

The Tier 1 buffer of the expend
able funds pool has also experienced
a significant recovery. The expend
able pools fund is the cash the Univer
sity can spend at any given moment;
the money is invested and any excess
returns go to fill the Tier 1 buffer,
which can grow up to 35 percent of
total expendable funds before the
money starts going to the Tier 2
buffer.
Investment income is projected to
be flat in the coming year.
"Our current projection is that the
payout on the individual endowment
fund will go up by inflationary
amount in 2012," Etchemendy said.
In other business, Stephen Moni
smith, civil and environmental engi
neering professor and chair of the
Committee on Research, delivered a
short presentation describing the
committee's request for the Senate to
grant a Private Investigatorship (PI)

Eligibility Exceptions Policy for a lim
ited trial period of up to four years.
The request was divided into two
parts: the first requesting PI Eligibili
ty Exceptions for SLAC National
Laboratory senior/distinguished sci
entists, and the second requesting the
same for University postdoctoral stu
dents.
The Senate voted to authorize the
Committee on Research to conduct a
"trial period" exception to Stanford's
policy on PI eligibility for senior/dis
tinguished scientists at SLAC.
Senators expressed concern at
granting this one-time exception to all
postdocs across the University and in
stead voted to have the Committee
for Research refine its proposal with
regards to the scope of applicability of
the PI eligibility exception.
