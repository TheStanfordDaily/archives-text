## Surplus projected for budget Provost John Etchemendy presents annual report 
### JOANNA XU SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Provost John Etchemendy Ph.D. 'B2
presented Stanford's annual budget re
port for 2010-2011 on Thursday before
the Faculty Senate, saying the financial
pressures on the University resulting
from economic instability in 2008 were
showing signs of lifting.
Etchemendy summarized the endow
ment decline and anticipated loss in en
dowment payouts in excess of $2OO mil
lion, as well as the University's suspen
sion of the traditional endowment
smoothing formula. Etchemendy also
highlighted that the University chose not
to shrink financial aid programs in light of
the financial declines.

"The capital budget for next year is
projected to decrease from $649 million
to $368 million as projects are complet

Madera Grove and the child care center."

As for the consolidated budget for op
erations, revenues were actually up 2.6
percent averaged over the past two years.

"It doesn't cancel inflation, but it does
n't explain the turmoil we went through,"
Etchemendy said.
Income from students was up 3.9 per
cent after the tuition was hiked 3.5 per
cent in 2009. However, financial aid out
puts accounted for half of what the Uni
versity pulled in for undergraduate tu
ition. Furthermore, outputs to support
graduates accounted for another $285
million of outlays.
"Basically, we ought to get out of the
student business," Etchemendy joked.
Nonetheless, need-based financial aid
is expected to decrease in the coming
years as the economy improves and the
families of students have less need.

On the other hand, while University
research funding has been relatively
steady over the past 10 years, this is most
ly due to research funding receipts from
American Recovery and Reinvestment
Act (ARRA). Etchemendy expressed
concern that this funding was not sustain
able.

"As you can see, without ARRA our
research funding has basically been flat,
and adjusted for inflation, research fund
ing would have gone down,"
Etchemendy said.
"As for what the future holds, my
