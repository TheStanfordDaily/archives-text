Stanford students made some
movies and, last Friday, at the
Stanford Film Society's annual
Student Film Festival, I got to judge
them. Sixteen short films competed
for prizes in five categories: best
comedy, best documentary, best
music video, best screenplay and
"audience favorite."
My co-judge, Adam Tobin, and
I awarded best comedy to Jesse
Krompier 'lO, a member of the
sketch comedy group Robber
Barons (which produced each of the
festival's five comedies), for "Flame
On," a film about a boy who cannot

snap, and then, suddenly, can
with some pretty "hot" conse
quences.
Best music video went to Chris
Sonne ('O9) for his impressively
well-rhymed and comprehensive
biology-themed rap duet "Oxidate
It or Love It," which borrows beats
from The Game and Jay-Z. And,
thanks to its subtitled You Tube
video, it has glued the lyric, "So the
energy you get from eating them
blueberries is ferried to where high
energy electrons are carried," to my
brain.
Best screenplay and audience

favorite went to Abteen Bagheri 'll
and Sam Pressman 'lO for "Cocaine
Cowboys," a prettily shot movie that
garners some Terrence Malick
charm early on in a scene involving
a Connect Four game. Its wise-guy
tolerates-idiot dynamic pays hom
age to "Of Mice and Men," but with
a pinata full of cocaine driving the
narrative, it comes closer to the
antics of a Guy Ritchie caper, espe
cially once Sammy Franco ('O9)
shows up as a cokehead on roller
skates.
Best documentary went to
MFA student Brian March for his

concise, black-and-white PTSD
exploration entitled "Michael and
His Dragon," which honored its
subject with subtlety.
Among the six other documen
taries were "Bold Strydes," about a
young woman's passion for creating
African-inspired clothing; "New
Crossroads," about the cross-cultur
al work the a cappella group
Talisman is doing in South Africa;
"Art of Yoga," which informed me
that teaching yoga to female juve
nile delinquents might be good for
them; and "Behind the Scenes of
Bad Lieutenant," which let me bask
