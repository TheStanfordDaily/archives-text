# Stanford's Own Cannes

Stanford students made some
movies and, last Friday, at the
Stanford Film Society's annual
Student Film Festival, I got to judge
them. Sixteen short films competed
for prizes in five categories: best
comedy, best documentary, best
music video, best screenplay and
"audience favorite."
My co-judge, Adam Tobin, and
I awarded best comedy to Jesse
Krompier 'lO, a member of the
sketch comedy group Robber
Barons (which produced each of the
festival's five comedies), for "Flame
On," a film about a boy who cannot

snap, and then, suddenly, can
with some pretty "hot" conse
quences.
Best music video went to Chris
Sonne ('O9) for his impressively
well-rhymed and comprehensive
biology-themed rap duet "Oxidate
It or Love It," which borrows beats
from The Game and Jay-Z. And,
thanks to its subtitled You Tube
video, it has glued the lyric, "So the
energy you get from eating them
blueberries is ferried to where high
energy electrons are carried," to my
brain.
Best screenplay and audience

favorite went to Abteen Bagheri 'll
and Sam Pressman 'lO for "Cocaine
Cowboys," a prettily shot movie that
garners some Terrence Malick
charm early on in a scene involving
a Connect Four game. Its wise-guy
tolerates-idiot dynamic pays hom
age to "Of Mice and Men," but with
a pinata full of cocaine driving the
narrative, it comes closer to the
antics of a Guy Ritchie caper, espe
cially once Sammy Franco ('O9)
shows up as a cokehead on roller
skates.
Best documentary went to
MFA student Brian March for his

concise, black-and-white PTSD
exploration entitled "Michael and
His Dragon," which honored its
subject with subtlety.
Among the six other documen
taries were "Bold Strydes," about a
young woman's passion for creating
African-inspired clothing; "New
Crossroads," about the cross-cultur
al work the a cappella group
Talisman is doing in South Africa;
"Art of Yoga," which informed me
that teaching yoga to female juve
nile delinquents might be good for
them; and "Behind the Scenes of
Bad Lieutenant," which let me bask

in film-geek awe at cinematic idol
Werner Herzog's Bavarian despair.
It was clear that effort had gone
into making these movies, but I
found myself with some critical
thoughts.
To begin, I wanted the movies
to have better stories. Instead, they

felt meandering, one scene going
into the next without a thread to
connect them. "Bold Strydes" had
chronology, which will do in a
pinch, but I would have liked seeing
that old narrative staple some
one wanting something put to
better use.
For that, you need characters,
something the movies seemed short

on. I liked "Powow Stories 2010"
best when it was interviewing a jew
elry vendor who supported himself
and his family with handcrafted
turquoise necklaces. "Oh no," I
thought, "what's he going to do?"
Maybe this sounds like schaden
freude at worst and voyeurism at

best, but I'd prefer to call it empa
thy.
Other films seemed a bit too
promotional, ignoring the more
complex sides of their subjects.
"New Crossroads," for example,
focused exclusively on the positive
interactions between Stanford stu
dents and their South African hosts.
I wondered if there were moments

of less-than-ideal rapport, or times
when the students questioned the
value of their endeavor. "Art of
Yoga," too, missed a chance to com
plicate its story with questions
about the program what fiscal
trade-offs it involved, for example,
or whether yoga actually helped the
girls lead better lives. A documen
tary needn't be antagonistic to dis
play depth, but neither should it be
credulous. My favorite stories are
ones where I don't know exactly
how to feel about what I'm seeing.
I'm holding these films to a
high standard, I know. I made a
documentary for a class once, and
the result was something I didn't
even bother to save from deletion. I
know that as students we have lim
ited time, budgets and experience
and that makes putting a great
film together really hard. But I'm
not convinced it's impossible. I
believe a really good movie is liter
ally among the best things that can
exist, so why be content with any
thing else?
