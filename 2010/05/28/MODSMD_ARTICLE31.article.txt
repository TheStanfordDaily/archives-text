# Lost and Found

Television series, especially the
best of them, thrive on offer
ing a certain, reliable appeal.
You watch a show, or choose not to,
because you know what you're get
ting. Even narrative television pro
grams thrive on the rhythmic rich
ness that can emerge from playing
within a defined mode. The viewers
of a series may find themselves
debating the relative merits of an
episode, or a season, of the medi
um's standout shows but they're
usually arguing with a set of shared
assumptions of what a show is and
what it should be trying to do.
"Lost" is "Lost" precisely
because it isn't like that and its
fans, past perhaps the first season,
could and did come to the show for
a dizzying variety of reasons. To its
credit and perhaps to its detriment,
"Lost" never broke decisively toward
pleasing one supporting camp or
another. Like the shifting alliances
and intentions of its appropriately
sprawling cast, the series never set
tled itself into a dependable, pre
dictable focus or approach. The
show has alternately focused on
characters, thrills, mystery, myth
and playful genre bending, with no
discernible overriding preference.
Through those shifts it has carried
forward, picking up new ways of
unfolding its mysteries and enrich
ing its characters new faces, new
locations, new conflicts, new story
telling structures while never
fully discarding what had come
before. Those who were along for
the ride, whether for favorite char
acters, weekly thrills, larger mythol
ogy, religious or philosophical
exploration or any number of other
reasons, never could find it wholly
satisfying or wholly worthless, even
at its highest and lowest points.
The series finale of "Lost," then,

faced a burden an order of magni
tude greater than the conclusions of
other shows. Most television mas
terpieces face the challenge of stay
ing true to what they have meant
and accomplished, providing a
meaningful resolution to a story or
a worldview while not cheating on
embodying it. "Lost," however, had
to accomplish this task while simul
taneously answering a question it
has beautifully, productively avoid
ed answering: what is "Lost," any
way?
This question, far more inter
esting and far more challenging
question than any of the other mys
teries the show had to answer in its
final two and a half hours, was the
central task the show faced in its
finale, called "The End." The
episode offered two answers.
One was that "Lost" is, well,

what it's always been: an indecisive,
lovable mix of strands and ele
ments. With that in mind, the finale
spent its first two hours and change
bringing to a close the conflicts on
the Island, the arcs of all but one of
its characters and the sense of dis-

satisfaction and unease that had
dogged the characters in the "side
ways" universe. In doing so, the
episode, directed by the immensely
capable series veteran lack Bender,
uncorked a half-dozen of the best
moments in the entire series. The
sequence of Jack, Hurley, Desmond
and the Man in Black around the
well of light found the show top
ping all its prior flirtations with
"Indiana Jones"esque modern
mythology. The fight on the cliffs
between Jack and the Man in Black,
and the wrenching separations that
took place afterwards, was as grip
ping as you could want. Sawyer and
Juliet reunited in a scene that actors
Josh Holloway and Elizabeth
Mitchell played the hell out of.
Hurley became, if anything, more

likable, as he finally took up the role
of leader. And the show's far-and
away two best actors, Michael
Emerson as Ben and Terry O'Quinn
as Locke, got one last magnificently
played scene that brought both of
their characters to a dignified, satis
factory endpoint.
The material, tangible conclu
sion of the series came off in as riv
eting and satisfying a fashion as any
fan could have reasonably expected.
"Lost" brought this all off, however,
avoiding the real question. And the
final sequence, which has drawn the
ire from a great many fans, offered
only a puzzling answer. Jack's con
versation with his dead father, and
the reunion of the characters in a
church, made the sideways universe
a lot clearer, but it's very hard to say
it had been built up to in a clear
manner.

What to make of this last
sequence depends on what you're
looking for. For viewers who take it
as "the answer," the show's thesis,
the reason for it all, I can't imagine
it working well. If you take the plu
ralism, artificial unity and reductive

explanation of the series' last few
scenes as "the point" we're all
included, it's all okay and this has
all meant one thing — it not only
didn't work, but even if it had, it
would have betrayed what had
made the show so unique and capti
vating. Any hope that you could
narrow down what "Lost" is or was
vanished with a finale that suitably
honored the diversity of reasons
viewers found the show so com
pelling, prior to the last scenes; but
the final sequence took away even
the satisfaction of the show content
to be what it was.

So if the show's creators
intended it as a thesis for the show,
or if you take it that way, then it was
reductive and underdeveloped in
equal measure. But as I pointed to

above, "Lost" fans come for differ
ent reasons. And for me, I come for
the moments. And you can take that
last sequence as just the final series
of moments for the show a beau
tifully acted, eloquently rendered
spiritual close for the show's central
character, combined with a reunion
of the tightly-knit cast of characters
the show has built up over the
years. And if it doesn't make a great
deal of sense when you think about
it, if it doesn't spring organically
from what the show had built up to,
if it threatens the significance of
some or all of what we saw took
place over six years, as a moment, it
worked and quite well. The show
closed by imbuing an admission of
its utter and total failure to be any
thing in particular the most
essential and inviolable task of any
artistic work, and none more than
television by feeling good about
itself and the flaws that inevitably
come about from its indeterminate
approach.
I submit, then, that "Lost" was
as great a success as I ever could
have wanted, and that I also under
stand why it was so profoundly dis
satisfying for so many fans. In "The
End," Lost could only be true to
itself by not defining itself. Whether
it did or not, appropriately, depends
on what you were looking for.
