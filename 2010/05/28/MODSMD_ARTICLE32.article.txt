# 2010 in TV: Reinventing the Wheel

A mere eight months ago, I
wrote 1,600 words about
fall television premieres.
From that point on, I never
looked back, trudging through the
trashiest of television for nuggets
of artistic insight. I could not
have asked for a better television
season in which to do so.
The television of the early
and mid-2000s ("The Wire," "The
Sopranos," "American Idol," even
"Grey's Anatomy") emerged vic
torious in the battle to define the

future of television as one of
artistic quality. These programs
filled the void in a time where the
standards of the late '9os were get
ting a little long in the tooth
("Friends" comes to mind for me,
but that may be just me ... ). If
the 2000s were, as Emily
Nussbaum so eloquently put it,
"When TV became art," then the
new pilots of this past fall exist in
an industry and in a society
where artistic innovation is
expected. On the cusp of this new

decade, the television landscape
needed some new blood and
not just "True Blood," though you
can never have enough "True
Blood."
While NBC responded with a
primetime spot for Jay Leno, the
triumphant victors of this season
were the irreverent comedies.
Thinking back to a time when
"Arrested Development" failed
after three seasons, I now see that
networks are fashioning their
offerings around their salient
comedies: Fox has "Glee," NBC
has Thursdays, ABC has
Wednesdays and CBS has a little
bit of everything. Where the mid
2000s resuscitated the idea of an
hour-long show, 2010 reinvented
the sitcom and the half-hour
comedy. Arguably, the winners,
critical and popular, of this season
were "Modern Family" and
"Community" on ABC and NBC,
respectively. For me, however,
these two programs only barely
edged out their time slot counter
parts, "Cougar Town" and "Parks
and Recreation." The genius of
the half-hour time slots, which
the networks seemed to have dis
covered, lies in their complemen
tary nature: if "Community"
doesn't click, the night will
bounce back with "Parks." The
brand loyalty that comedy creates
I have a meta sense of humor a
la "Community" or an immature
one a la "Cougar Town" saves
both new projects and veteran
franchises like "30 Rock."
On CBS, "The Big Bang
Theory" came into its own this
year and has begun to draw com
parisons to the comedy stalwart
of old, "Friends." Starz, the epito
me of paid cable, even threw its
hat into the ring with the inim
itable "Party Down." These
ensemble comedies emphasize
maturity and care in casting and
dialogue, as the shows took risks
in both regards for handsome
rewards. That these shows have
been built around characters
rather than situations suggests
their ability to withstand the
notorious sophomore slump.
The hour-long dramas
showed their age this year, despite
strong showings from "The Good
Wife" and "Parenthood." ABC's
reliance on "Desperate
Housewives," "Grey's Anatomy"
and "Brothers and Sisters" seems

misplaced, particularly given the
fluctuations in cast and airing this
season. All the major networks are
seeking to invest in the next
"Lost," though that show, so I
have heard, never gave us the pay
off its loyal audience deserved.
The cancellation of so many
hour-long programs from this
year, including the classic "Law
and Order," leaves networks and
audiences begging for serious
contemplation of the form. The
obligatory and schizophrenic
focus within ensemble casts and
the obvious tonal shifts accompa
nying them cannot sustain a full
hour "Desperate Housewives"
is a great example. Half-hour
comedy rewrote its vernacular
this year; full-hour still needs to
re-imagine its premises.
The summer will not fail to

fill your nights with hours around
the widescreen: paid network
favorites such as "True Blood" and
"Mad Men" will be back in top
form. I also love a good summer
reality sleeper hit ("Dating in the
Dark"? "More to Love"?) and will,
I hope, keep up a Remote Nomad
blog to sharpen my prose and
trim my use of conjunctions and
tricolons.
Thanks for humoring an
English major who believes her
writing to be humorous and elo
quent with your time and patron
age! Long live television and the
passion it inspires.
