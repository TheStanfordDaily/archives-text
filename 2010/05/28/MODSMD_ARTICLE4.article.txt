# INDIVIDUAL GLORY
## KLAHN, BARTE PLAYING FOR SINGLES TITLES 
### KABIR SAWHNEY DESK EDITOR 
With the NCAA team tournaments now con
cluded, the top players on both the Stanford
men's and women's tennis teams turned their
eyes toward the individual competition at the
NCAA Championships. On the men's side,
sophomore Bradley Klahn was the only player
to enter the tournament, while junior Hilary
Barte and freshman Mallory Burdette both en
tered the women's draw.

Klahn, who entered the tournament as one of
its top 16 seeds, breezed past his competition in
the first round, defeating Artem Baradach of
SMU 6-3,6-2.

Klahn's second round opponent, Boris Conkic
of Tennessee, proved to be a tougher challenge.
Though Conkic took the first set from Klahn, the
sophomore bounced back to win the next two sets
and the match with a final score of 4-6,6-3,6-4.

The next match for Klahn will be today at 8:30
a.m. PST, when he takes on fourth-seeded
Guillermo Gomez of Georgia Tech. Gomez has
not had an easy road to the round of 16 he had
to grind out a three-set victory over his first
round opponent, Moritz Baumann of Wisconsin,
before needing a tiebreaker victory in the second
round to advance.

On the women's side, Barte has had an easy
road into the quarterfinals. Seeded fourth, Barte
took out her opening round foe, Michaela Kissell
of Marshall, 6-3,6-1.
Second round opponent Ute Schnoy of Den
ver proved to be even less of a challenge, falling to
Barte 6-1,6-2.

Barte will play again today at 7 a.m. PST, when
she takes on Kristi Boxx of Ole Miss. The unseed
ed Boxx advanced to the round of 16 with wins
over Martina Pavelec of Wake Forest and Kristy
Frilling of Notre Dame.

Meanwhile, Burdette could not match the suc
cess of Barte and Klahn. Burdette, who was un
seeded, advanced past Alexa Guarachi of Alaba
ma 6-1,6-3 before falling in the second round to
eighth-seeded Laura Vallverclu of Miami.
In addition to the singles draw, the Cardinal
has one team entered in each doubles draw.

On the men's side, Klahn and sophomore Ryan
Thacher enter the tournament as the fourth seed.

In their first round match against Tennessee's
Conkic and Rhyne Williams, the duo delivered
an emphatic 6-2,6-2 victory. Klahn and Thacher
will now face Jason Jung and Evan King of
Michigan, who needed to win two tiebreakers in
their first round match to advance to the round
of 16. Their match will take place at 1 p.m. PST
today.
The sole women's duo, Barte and senior
Lindsay Burdette, are seeded second in the
draw. One of the top teams in the nation all sea
son, the duo took an easy first-round win over
Irina Falconi and Sasha Krupina of Georgia Tech.
Barte and Burdette swept the match 6-4,6-2.
The next match for the team is today at 12 p.m.
PST against Guarachi and Courtney McLane of
Alabama. That unseeded team advanced with a
victory over Lauren Megale and Pichittra Thong
dach of Boise State, 6-3,5-7,6-1.
