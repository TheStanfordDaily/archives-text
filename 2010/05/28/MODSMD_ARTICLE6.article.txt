## LOCAL Lockdown at Gunn high school Student arrested for allegedly bringing an Airsoft gun onto the Palo Alto campus

Stanford Department of Public Safety officers re
sponded on Thursday to a safety scare at Gunn High
School, where a student was arrested after allegedly
bringing an Airsoft gun onto the Palo Alto campus,
prompting a school-wide lockdown.
A city worker saw two men drive onto campus around
2 p.m. on Thursday, one of whom appeared to have an as
sault rifle on his lap, according to Palo Alto Police Officer
Marianna Villaescusa. The worker called Palo Alto police,
who requested mutual aid from Stanford and other local
agencies. In all, 15 to 20 officers responded, according to
Villaescusa.
Officers found the suspects' unoccupied car on campus
and, fearing the men were armed among the high school
students who had gotten out of class minutes earlier, put
the school on "code red" lockdown.
Parents arriving to pick up their children waited across
the street near Alta Mesa Cemetery. Some who were al
ready on campus had to join students and staff locking
themselves into classrooms.
Jaysen Levoy, a senior at Gunn, described hearing the
code red announcement over the loudspeaker just after
he got out of math class.
"I didn't know what code red meant," he said. "I had an
idea 'Oh, isn't that the shooter-on-campus situation?"'
"It became obvious real quick when all the teachers
were like ... 'Get away from the windows, close the
door," he added.
Levoy said he, about six other students and four teach
ers went into the math and science staff lounge, where
they waited in the dark for some 40 minutes.
"At first, like, people were ... a little bit frantic and

kind of like talking excitedly to each other and like, 'Oh
God, you have to be quiet.' Then one of the teachers was
like, 'Everybody be calm; we'll get to know each other,"'
he said.
The all-clear sounded around 2:45 p.m., though Levoy
said teachers he asked didn't know whether or not the sus
pects had a real gun.The school had done a code red prac
tice drill "two or three months ago," he said.
Meanwhile, officers received two 911 calls during the
lockdown that added to confusion: one call was reporting
gunshot sounds near the school, while another came from
the parent of a Gunn student saying her daughter was
being held at gunpoint inside the school.
The officers split up, but "kept major resources on cam
pus," Villaescusa said. The mother's 911 call turned out to
be a mix-up; her daughter had called to inform her about
the lockdown and was found to be safe.
Officers found the suspects in a classroom, took their
car keys and found an Airsoft gun in its trunk along with
other weapons including a hatchet and a knife, the San
Jose Mercury News reported.
Police detained the suspects, both students; they later
arrested one, 18-year-old Weston Healy, according to the
Mercury News.
The Palo Alto Unified School District sent an alert to
parents at 3:24 p.m. via its mass communication system. In
it, according to a copy of the statement provided to The
Daily, Assistant Principal Kimberly Cowell told parents
that "at no time were students or staff in danger."
"Students and staff did an excellent job of following
the code red procedure and the Palo Alto Police Depart
ment's response was immediate and extremely effective,"
Cowell wrote.
A spokesperson for the Stanford Department of Pub
lic Safety did not return a request for comment on Thurs
day.

It is illegal, per Palo Alto ordinance, to carry an Airsoft
gun in public.
