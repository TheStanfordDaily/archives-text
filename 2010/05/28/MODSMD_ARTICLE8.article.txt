# Stanford scientist publishes new findings on Bangladesh arsenic poisoning
## 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Kate Abbott 
Drinking water supply and public health may be threat
ened by deep water pumping in Bangladesh, says a new
study published in the journal Science and co-authored by
Scott Fendorf, a Stanford professor in environmental earth
system science.
The May 27 study follows the discovery that naturally
occurring arsenic in water becomes toxic after mixing with
bacteria in river basins in Bangladesh, causing widespread
poisoning of people via their drinking water. Fendorf and
colleagues made the discovery of the millennia-old
process in 2008 after identifying arsenic poisoning as a re
sult of people drilling into groundwater aquifers.
The threat comes from people building deep wells that
pump into drinking water that contains less arsenic. This
poses its own set of problems, as wells used by farmers for
irrigation have the potential to pull the contaminated sur
face water into the uncorrupted groundwater beneath.
In the article, the authors propose retesting wells on a
regular basis to avoid contamination. Fendorf and his team
have been working on long-term solutions to groundwater
pumping in southeast Asia.
"We need to be thinking broadly about water options
that are available and not focus on a single solution,"
Fendorf said in an interview with the Stanford Report.
According to the World Health Organization, approxi
mately 60 million people in Bangladesh are exposed to ar
senic-contaminated drinking water.
