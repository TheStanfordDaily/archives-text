## Titus to replace Dada Incoming EIC to bring in countryside lifestyle 
### SCOOP SCOOPERSTEIN 
The tables turned on what was
supposed to be a landslide editor in
chief election when I.M. Fattie was
caught illegally producing deep
fried goods in Daily Business Man
ager Jason Shen's office. The inci
dent came to light after the De
partment of Public Safety re
sponded to a call of "smoke"
emerging from the business office
windows. Elizabeth Titus 'll, pre
viously not considered a viable
candidate, came through in the
final hours last night as a result of
the scandal.

Fattie Misses Victory Narrowly
While it was the eighth straight
election with only one human can
didate, Mr. I.M. Fattie, the soft,
stuffed panda, proved a challeng
ing contender to Titus. In the end,
the final count was 33 votes to Titus
and 21 to Fattie.

A tersely worded press release
from Fattie's office shed light on
his strategy.
"Fattie had been working close
ly with national figures and learn
ing campaign strategies," it read.
"He largely used social media to
galvanize his voters and would
have clinched the election if it
weren't for those fire and building
codes. Fattie is already exploring
other areas of interest to pursue
next volume."
Titus, a Mysterious Individual
At the time of Fattie's scandal,
Titus was still a somewhat un
known character to most staffers.
Aloof and relatively new to The
Daily, Titus emerged as a front
runner following Fattie's deep-fry
ing mishap. A native of Ferndale,
California, Titus is well accus
tomed to a country lifestyle. Upon
hearing the election results, she im
mediately instituted a policy re
placing water in the water cooler
with fresh milk, and made arrange
ments to bring in her pet Holstein-
Friersian dairy cow.

However, little is known about
her time at Stanford. Daily staff
members scrambled to find FroSo-
Co, her freshman dorm, on a map
to uncover details of her Stanford
career. But quick to see the down
sides of any such investigation,
Titus used her feminine prowess to
distract them from discovering her
true background.
Sports managing editor, Jacob
Jaffe 'l2 was trying to determine
the truth behind the allegations of
Titus' inappropriate sexual actions
with cows, when she interrupted
his research with her charms.

"I was completely stunned," re
counted Jaffe. "I couldn't even re
member what I was doing before
she spoke to me."

"WOW" added features man
aging editor Amy Harris 'll.
"Just... WOW!"

Indeed, some staffers even
scrambled to find ways to get clos
er to the incoming editor and care
fully strategized their future plans.
"I think Titus has a thing for
people who laugh hysterically,"
said optimistic freshman Kabir
Sawhney. "I saw her hooking up
with someone in Shen's office. All I
need to do is become best friends
with whoever she's dating, and
then one day she might go for me."
The unconfirmed allegations
against Titus do not constitute a vi
olation of Daily policy, but staffers

were jealous that they weren't the
ones hooking up with her in Shen's
office.
When asked to comment, Titus
stated simply, "a true editor does
n't need words."
But other staffers were not in
stantly won over by her good looks
and charm alone.
Features Editor Emma Trotter
'lO explained that she voted for
Titus because she had faith in her
credentials rather than disbelief
over the actions of her competi
tion.
"After her first two mental and
emotional breakdowns I wasn't
sure, but after the third I knew that
she was definitely editor in chief
material," Trotter said.

Elizabeth Titus '11 was elected editor in chief of The Daily late Thursday
night. Titus is set to introduce a more "traditional" atmosphere in the office
and instituted a policy requiring fresh milk in the water cooler at all times.
Resident critic Eric Messinger
'lO vehemently disagreed with Trot
ter, frowned and analyzed the situa
tion in detail.

"The nature of this problem is ex
tremely complex," he said. "One
can't underestimate the long-term
ramifications these past break
downs may have on the sustainabili
ty of The Daily and its staff. I would
be incredibly cautious when dealing
with any such individual."
The few who did vote for Pen
guin expressed unhappiness with
the outcome of the election.
"I was looking forward to those
warm churros that Fattie promised
to cook up," said Sam Svoboda 'll in
exasperation. "Now where will I get
my fix?"
Dada Leaves Office Confused
Other staffers expressed sorrow
at the impending departure of Edi
tor in Chief Kamil Dada 'll and
hoped that Titus would continue
some of the positive qualities that
Dada brought to the office.
"Office life will never be the
same without that British accent,"
said Kathleen Chaykowski 'l3.
"Hopefully, in time, Ellie will change
her accent to something comparably
alluring."
"I just hope she'll continue the
tradition of decorating the office,"
said Marisa Landicho 'l2. "Dada did
a great job personalizing the EIC of
fice and making it his home."
Undeniably, The Daily served as
Dada's home for the majority of this
past year. When interviewed, Dada's
assigned roommate was unaware
they had even been paired together.
"I thought I had a single this en
tire year!" exclaimed Alex Yu 'll. "I
think it is a little unreasonable for
Housing to assign someone to move
in during the last few weeks of
school."
After election results were an
nounced, Dada 'll was seen stum
bling out of the office with a con
fused look on his face.
"Do you know where the Main
Quad is?" he asked. "I need to find
Building 160 so I can go to my
classes."
Volume 238 begins July 1.
