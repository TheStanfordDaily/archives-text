# PURSUING PEACE

### JACOB JOLIS 
Susan Rice 'B6 may laugh easily,
but one shouldn't be fooled by
her lighthearted demeanor; she is
a woman on a mission. Rice, the
first African American woman to
represent the interests of the U.S. at the
United Nations, will address graduating
seniors at her alma mater as the 2010
Commencement Speaker.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
described her in the Washington Post as
"fearless." That was in 1998, when Rice at
age 34 served as Assistant Secretary of
State for African Affairs under President
Clinton. Albright adopted Rice as her
"protege."
10 years later, Strobe Talbott, Presi
dent of the Brookings Institution, the
Washington-based think tank and Rice's
former employer, told the New York
Times, "Susan certainly is tough, and she's
tough in exactly the right way."
From Washington, D.C., the 45-year-old
U.S. ambassador to the United Nations
tackled questions in a phone interview
with The Daily regarding her marriage, re
lations with other U.N. ambassadors and

her interactions with President Obama.
As a diplomat, Rice said she is con
cerned with issues of international securi
ty and peace.
"Our security and well-being are
linked very closely to the security and
well-being of people around the world,"
she told The Daily.
The path to her current position began
when she got to know Obama early on in
his presidential campaign and came to
hold the position of foreign policy advisor
to the Obama-Biden ticket.
Regarding her opinion of the Presi
dent's policies, Rice said, "to a great ex
tent our perspectives and views on foreign
policy and national security are very, very
alike, and to the extent that my advice on
certain issues may differ, I wouldn't air it
in the press."
To "the press," Rice preferred to speak
about an interdependent world. She de
scribed her foreign policy as reliant on
global partnership as opposed to unilater
al force.

"Where there is democracy, where
there is respect for human rights, where
there is economic opportunity ... those
are the kinds of societies that are best able
and most willing to partner with the Unit-

Ed States to deal with the threats that are
posed to our national security, but also the
global threats that are transnational in na
ture," Rice said.
During her time at Stanford, Rice
headed an effort to push the University to
divest from corporations doing business
in South Africa during the darkest days of
apartheid. David Abernethy, a professor
emeritus in political science who had a
vast influence on Rice in college, remem
bered the effort in which Rice set up an
"alternative fund to which students could
contribute pending University divesting."
Having graduated with honors and
been elected to Phi Beta Kappa in 'B6, she
was named a Rhodes scholar and studied
at Oxford, where she earned a Ph.D. in in
ternational relations. The Chatham
House-British International Studies As
sociation awarded her its prize for the
U.K.'s most distinguished doctoral disser
tation on international relations.
Of course, politics for Rice haven't al
ways been seamless. A policy of inaction
resulted in harsh criticism against Rice.

tration's National Security Council, she
