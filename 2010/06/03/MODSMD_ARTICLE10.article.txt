# PURSUING PEACE

### JACOB JOLIS 
Susan Rice 'B6 may laugh easily,
but one shouldn't be fooled by
her lighthearted demeanor; she is
a woman on a mission. Rice, the
first African American woman to
represent the interests of the U.S. at the
United Nations, will address graduating
seniors at her alma mater as the 2010
Commencement Speaker.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
described her in the Washington Post as
"fearless." That was in 1998, when Rice at
age 34 served as Assistant Secretary of
State for African Affairs under President
Clinton. Albright adopted Rice as her
"protege."
10 years later, Strobe Talbott, Presi
dent of the Brookings Institution, the
Washington-based think tank and Rice's
former employer, told the New York
Times, "Susan certainly is tough, and she's
tough in exactly the right way."
From Washington, D.C., the 45-year-old
U.S. ambassador to the United Nations
tackled questions in a phone interview
with The Daily regarding her marriage, re
lations with other U.N. ambassadors and

her interactions with President Obama.
As a diplomat, Rice said she is con
cerned with issues of international securi
ty and peace.
"Our security and well-being are
linked very closely to the security and
well-being of people around the world,"
she told The Daily.
The path to her current position began
when she got to know Obama early on in
his presidential campaign and came to
hold the position of foreign policy advisor
to the Obama-Biden ticket.
Regarding her opinion of the Presi
dent's policies, Rice said, "to a great ex
tent our perspectives and views on foreign
policy and national security are very, very
alike, and to the extent that my advice on
certain issues may differ, I wouldn't air it
in the press."
To "the press," Rice preferred to speak
about an interdependent world. She de
scribed her foreign policy as reliant on
global partnership as opposed to unilater
al force.

"Where there is democracy, where
there is respect for human rights, where
there is economic opportunity ... those
are the kinds of societies that are best able
and most willing to partner with the Unit-

Ed States to deal with the threats that are
posed to our national security, but also the
global threats that are transnational in na
ture," Rice said.
During her time at Stanford, Rice
headed an effort to push the University to
divest from corporations doing business
in South Africa during the darkest days of
apartheid. David Abernethy, a professor
emeritus in political science who had a
vast influence on Rice in college, remem
bered the effort in which Rice set up an
"alternative fund to which students could
contribute pending University divesting."
Having graduated with honors and
been elected to Phi Beta Kappa in 'B6, she
was named a Rhodes scholar and studied
at Oxford, where she earned a Ph.D. in in
ternational relations. The Chatham
House-British International Studies As
sociation awarded her its prize for the
U.K.'s most distinguished doctoral disser
tation on international relations.
Of course, politics for Rice haven't al
ways been seamless. A policy of inaction
resulted in harsh criticism against Rice.
During her time on the Clinton adminis
tration's National Security Council, she

Commencement Address to seniors at Stanford Stadium on June 13.
was called upon to advise the Presi
dent on an appropriate American
response to the Rwandan genocide
in 1994.
A 2001 Atlantic Monthly article
pointed out that Rice had asked in
an interagency teleconference, "If
we use the word 'genocide' and are
seen as doing nothing, what will be
the effect on the November [con
gressional] election?" She was then
criticized for mixing domestic De
mocratic Party politics into a deci
sion regarding U.S. policy on the on
going massacre.
Regrets about past American in
action have been voiced, and when
the situation in Darfur warranted it
in Rice's eyes, she strongly advocat
ed for an international interven
tion.
"She's a realist... in tune with
the way Obama wants to direct his
foreign policy. It's not going to be a
human rights agenda like Jimmy
Carter's, but it might be more effec
tive, because it is more realist," said
Clayborne Carson, professor of his
tory and director of the Martin
Luther King, Jr., Research and Edu
cation Institute.
Carson remembered Rice from
her time at Stanford.
"She was just determined to
make the maximum use of Stanford
as an environment to grow and de
velop," he said.
He referred to her as "such a
warm and personable figure" and
recognized that while she worked in
African Affairs, "a lot of these
African leaders just had the as
sumption that they could 'roll her'
because she was a woman in a place
where, at the time, I think there
were absolutely no other women
leaders to deal with."

"If they thought that because

this person is smaller in stature and
looks younger than her age, they
could somehow take advantage of
her, they were definitely mistaken,"
Carlson added.

Looking back on her time at
Stanford, Rice voiced nothing but
affection.

"I loved Stanford," she said. "I
had a tremendous amount of fun at
Stanford. I got a tremendous educa
tion. I made wonderful lasting
friends."

As a freshman, she lived in Soto,
which was then a four-class dorm

"Is it still a dump?" she asked be
tween chuckles. There she met her
future husband, lan Cameron, a TV
producer at ABC. The seniors, of
whom Cameron was one, hosted an
ice cream social for the freshmen in
the beginning of the year. Things
clicked: the couple married in 1992,
and Rice and Cameron now have
two children.

In addition to meeting her future
husband, she saw Stanford as a
place for change, growth and self
discovery.
"Moving to the west coast and
having the perspective of a different
part of the country, and frankly a
different part of the world, was a
valuable growth experience for
me," she said. "Up until that point,
I'd lived an east coast existence in a
pretty rarified world of Washington.
It was broadening in many respects.
I don't think there's a more beauti
ful, a more fun place to go to college
than Stanford. The quality of educa
tion is extraordinary."
Ansaf Kareem, senior class co
president, said that he felt excited
about Rice's speaking at com
mencement, "especially since so
many people in our class were in
volved in the election in 'OB. At
some level, that defined our class."
Commencement will take place
on June 13 at the Stanford Stadium.
