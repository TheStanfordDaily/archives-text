# FATHERS OF INVENTION
## 
### TYLER BROWN STAFF WRITER 
In the digital world, today's hottest innova
tion can be obsolete tomorrow. But some in
ventions endure and are built upon and im
proved for so many years they're hard to
live without. Two of those inventions, creat
ed at Stanford, are FM synthesis and fluores
cence-activated cell sorting.
Can you hear me now?
John Chowning, professor emeritus of fine arts
and music, came up with the idea for the FM syn
thesizer in 1967.
"I kind of stumbled on it," he recalled.
At the time, Chowning was experimenting
with localization how to make computerized
sounds seem to come from different places in a
room. To create the illusion of a sound coming
from somewhere other than directly from a
speaker, he had to understand how we perceive
sounds at a distance, which depends on the struc
ture of the sound and how it reverberates off
walls. And with the relatively low processing
power of computers at the time, it was no easy
task.
"I began searching for this sort of complexity,"
Chowning said, by examining a sound's pitch. In
creasing vibrato the oscillation between two
pitches, like the wobbly sound of a violin note
can change the actual note you hear.
But Chowning's computer was no violin. In the
19605, PCs weren't capable of more than simple
"beeps."
"Imagine how the sound of that is simply a
tone sound," he said. "So I simply modulate that
sound with another wave that is sinusoidal [simi
lar to a sine wave] in shape."
By combining multiple tones with different
frequencies, Chowning could create unique
sounds.
"So that, basically, is frequency modulation,
and I was experimenting with the computer to
generate signals that had some internal liveliness
that helped me localize" the sounds, Chowning
said.
Chowning noticed that as he increased the vi
brato's rate and depth, he no longer heard just a
change in instantaneous pitch, but a complex tim
bre, much like the sound of a musical instrument.
"I knew enough about the world at that time to
realize that was unexpected to get such com
plex timbres by other means demanded lots and
lots of oscillators or waveforms and filters lots
of gear," Chowning said.
Fie followed with some "semi-rigorous experi
ments." Not only did it become a useful experi
mental tool "it generated lively signals, lively
sounds," Chowning said. "But then I realized a
few years later that it was probably useful to the
electronic music instrument world."
Chowning signed the patent for FM synthesis
over to the University, and Stanford's Office of
Technology Licensing (OTL) marketed the idea
to a number of organ companies that already
made basic electronic instruments. After being
turned down several times, the OTL "finally
found one who understood what I was doing,"
Chowning said.
And in 1983, the 61-note Yamaha DX-7 syn
thesizer was born.
"One of the great advantages of FM over com

peting technologies ... was that it demanded rel
atively little processing it was a simple formula
that demanded little memory," Chowning said.
Less memory meant smaller hardware. The
DX-7 was no bigger than its descendents that are
sold today. And regardless of whether or not one
is a musician, FM synthesis matters to everyone
who owns a cell phone.
"Probably its biggest application ever was
ringtones, believe it or not," Chowning said.
Getting to the FACS
Genetics professor Len Flerzenberg "used to
complain that he couldn't look down a micro
scope; he didn't like counting things in the micro
scope, it was frustrating to him," said his wife and
lifelong lab partner, Lee Herzenberg.
His solution, which built on older, less efficient
machines, was the fluorescence-activated cell
sorter (FACS), invented in the 19605. It started out
as an instrument used to measure atomic fallout
by judging the size of atmospheric particles col
lected after bomb tests. Herzenberg changed it
into a machine now present in almost every mod
ern hospital and microbiology lab.
"As most good inventions are like, he didn't
have to invent the wheel to make an automobile,"
Lee Herzenberg said. "But he took a wheel that
was known to work on a cart, and [he] improved it
to work in an automobile."
Building on the Los Alamos machine and
other technologies, Herzenberg created the
FACS.
Rather than picking through Petri dishes for
the products of chemical reactions, "we were try
ing to get subsets, subpopulations of these cells
and understand them," Lee said.
After all, "you can't study it if you can't isolate
it and recombine it with things," she added.
Fluorescence is one way to identify and sepa
rate the cells into different batches. In the original
FACS, a black light hides particular wavelengths
of visible light so that only a handful of wave
lengths chosen by the researcher shine through.
The light excites a particular molecule, marking
the outside of a cell and making it glow another
color.
More advanced versions of the machine, used
today, shine lasers.
"What FACS does is it has cells run in single
file in a stream and it shines laser light," which
is high energy, but emits a narrow set of wave
lengths "and if they have a fluorescent mole
cule that can absorb where the laser is lighting it,
they absorb and emit then at whatever their char
acteristic color is," she said.
After they're hit with the light, a detector,
which is often covered by a filter to allow in only
the desired wavelengths, checks each cell's color.
Then, they are separated based on how they glow.
And all that happens over the space of about
three inches, from where the cell passes the detec
tor to where it comes out of the nozzle.
State of the art sorters can handle many differ
ent types of cells at once.
"These days, [there are] up to seven lasers and
20 filtered detectors, and then we have electronics
that orchestrate everything," Lee said. "We may
look at a million cells in a minute or so."
The most popular proteins to "tag" cells with
are antibodies.
"The reason we use antibodies to
tag things is they have microscopic
eyes. They can detect shapes of things
sort of like a blind man recognizing
somebody's face by detecting the
configuration or the shape of it," she
said.

When the antibody recognizes a
shape that it's looking for, "it's like a
lock in a key, it finds a shape that
matches it, they stick together very
tightly," she added.
Antibodies made by the body,
combined with human cells, allow
FACS to recognize, among other
things, HIV infection and B-cell
leukemia, because different combi
nations of antibodies attach to cells
in different conditions and all of
them look different to the ma

chine's eye.
"Technology can in turn grow the
field by making it possible to see
these things and therefore opening
up new questions to be answered,"

Lee said. "So it's kind of a spiral, if you
like."
