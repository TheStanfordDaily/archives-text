# THE
						REAL DEAL ABOUT EEL
## 
### VANESSA CASTANEDA 
Next time you're craving a roll from the
Axe and Palm, think twice about choos
ing the unagi , or freshwater eel, variety.
Despite its popularity, the eel-farming process is
not sustainable each year more juveniles are re
moved from the wild, and fewer are left to grow and
one day reproduce to replenish wild stocks.
According to the Monterey Bay Aquarium's
Seafood Watch report about unagi, 90 percent of eels
are raised by "aquaculture," another name for
"farming" seafood. Unagi received a red "avoid" rat
ing from the Monterey Bay Aquarium's Seafood
Watch program for, among other things, being over
fished. Seafood is given a red rating when the fish is
"caught or farmed in ways that harm other marine
life or the environment."
Throw in habitat destruction and dammed rivers
that block eels' return to the sea, and the plight of the
freshwater eel becomes dire.

In some areas of the world, it has gotten so bad for
the eel that government agencies are forcing fisher
men to put their nets away for a season. Eel fishing
will be banned in the oceans surrounding the
Netherlands, where the European eel once thrived,
from September to November starting this year. This
was primarily done as a response to the Convention
on International Trade in Endangered Species of
Wild Fauna and Flora of 2007 placing the European
eel on the list of "species not necessarily threatened
with extinction, but in which trade must be con
trolled in order to avoid utilization incompatible
with their survival."

While Stanford Dining's Sustainable Food Pro
gram goals include prioritizing "food that is commu
nity-based, fair and ecologically sound," Matthew
Rothe, sustainable food coordinator at Stanford
Dining, was not aware of a specific sustainability pol
icy for the items in the grab-n-go sections.
"I'll need to check in with the supplier and with
our unit manager to get some clarification on the
matter and to discuss possible corrective actions,"
Rothe said.

The previous sustainable food coordinator, Erin
Gaines, said that she did not do much with unagi in
particular during her tenure. However, Gaines was
instrumental in organizing Sustainable Seafood
Week on campus in November 2008.
"For seafood purchasing, Stanford Dining fol
lows the Monterey Bay Aquarium seafood watch
card," Gaines said. "And since unagi is on the red list,
our policy was not to serve it, or at least enter the
process of phasing it out."
Lwin Maung Maung and his partner hand roll
more than 200 sushi trays daily for the Stanford stu
dents and visitors who eat at Tresidder Memorial
Union and the Axe and Palm.
Maung carves slices out of a hunk of bright pink
fish and arranges them into an aesthetically appeal
ing pattern. Preparing for the second sushi delivery
of the day, he worked calmly and with purpose, ex
pertly wielding a lime green-handled knife. Tall with
short brown hair and kind eyes, Maung, who answers
to "the sushi guy," has made sushi for the Stanford
