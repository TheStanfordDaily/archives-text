# SCHOOL IN REVIEW
## 
### CASSANDRA FELICIANO STAFF WRITER 
£ { ~w- a -7" e're closing in
% /k J 26 days."
Richard Mojarro had only been prin
cipal at East Palo Alto Academy
(EPAA) Elementary School for less
than 10 months when he began making
final preparation for the school's closing
in June,
Like everyone else, the disappoint
ment stung most when he thought about
the potential. While it was rarely said
aloud, there was a widespread expecta
tion for these students to be practically
spoon-fed their academic achievement.
After all, when EPAA opened in 2006
under a charter from the Ravenswood
School District, it looked like a sure-fire
recipe for success.
Most of the teachers were graduates
of the Stanford School of Education's
STEP programs and its star-studded ad
ministration was headed by Linda Dar
ling-Hammond, a School of Education
professor who was on Obama's short-list
for Secretary of Education.
And, really, Stanford wasn't used to
failure.
That's why administrators at the
Stanford School of Education, teachers
and families were unprepared for the
Ravenswood decision. Denied a five
year charter extension by the School
District board, EPAA instead received a
limited two-year extension. Only the
fifth-grade program of the elementary
school will remain open until 2011, and
the high school until 2012, while Stan
ford educators will begin the search for a
new "charter home."
"It was a shock to us because we had
been kind of led to believe that we were
fine and that we didn't have anything to
worry about," said Deborah Stipek, a
member of the Ravenswood board of di
rectors and dean of Stanford's School of
Education. "We didn't find out that they
weren't going to recommend not contin
uing the elementary school until the day
of the board meeting."
Plans had been made. Summer
school, reading programs with Stanford
donors and alumni and a stint with un
dergraduate and graduate students from
the Schools of Engineering and Medi
cine were all in the works.
"It cuts it short, it cuts the plans
short," Mojarro said."Change is hard for
people, so my initiatives weren't em
braced immediately because it was very
different. So it took awhile for them to
warm up to these ideas. But what hap
pens now it's all dissolved."
Mojarro had even recruited the help
of a Stanford alum, Sarah Woodward 'O9,

to design two murals and lead a school
wide event to paint it in an effort to
beautify the school.
In the end, none of it mattered.
California public schools are evaluat
ed through their Academic Performance
Index (API) scores, which are based on
standardized test results. EPAA had an
API of 606 in 2009; CA's state average
that year was 755.

But, these less-than-stellar numbers
did more than just close EPAA it
also tarnished Stanford's School of Edu
cation's academic reputation.
Mike Piscal, founder of Inner City
Education Foundation (ICEF) public
schools, charges Darling-Flammond
with trying to evade assuming responsi
bility for flaws he perceives in their edu
cational approaches.
"Are you kidding me? East Palo Alto
is like a rough neighborhood in Beverly
Hills compared to South Centro and
Oakland and Compton. It is not a diffi
cult environment to educate a kid."
His intuitions have told him that the
problem is in the institution.
"They've been teaching in the ivory
tower for so long, they don't know how
to teach kids, and they certainly don't
know how to teach the teachers how to
teach them," he said. "Flere's what was
considered one of the best schools of ed
ucation, and they can't run one school."
Piscal, a mere private school English
teacher when he started ICEF in 1991,
has proven he can outperform Stanford
in this charter-school "race to the top."
15 times.

ICEF boasts of having established
five elementary, six middle and four high
schools in South L.A., seven of which
have API scores at or above the state av
erage. The rest have populations that are
too small to provide accurate data from
which the state can calculate API.

One of its latest additions, ICEF Vista
Elementary, is in its second year of oper
ation on a campus a few blocks away
from the projects in Ingle wood, a com
mon hangout for the Bloods. ICEF Vista
has an API of 767.

But, it's more than just working to
ward a test score. Piscal thinks that he's
found a model program that solves the
charter school problems.
"To me, the tests are easy," he said. "If
you have a rigorous college prep educa
tion where the child, when they graduate
from high school, is prepared to go to
Stanford or Berkeley or UC-Davis or
Cal State San Francisco, and you're
preparing them to do college level work,
that'll take care of the test scores."

But Gary Orfield, professor of educa
tion at UCLA's Graduate School of Ed
ucation & Information Studies, said that
he firmly believed that Darling-Ham
mond and her Stanford-trained corps
could have met state standards with

more time. He attributes failing charters
to lackluster administrators, inexperi
enced teachers and an underrepresenta
tion of social factors that impede stu
dents' abilities to learn.

"Those kids have multiple prob
lems," he said. "They come from poor
families with relatively low information.
They have language issues, and they
have a lot of other issues in their lives."

Still, for Piscal, the best way to relate
this expectation to his students and as
sure that they meet the standard is not to
be afraid to ask for help.
"They have good intentions at Stan
ford," he said. "But they put their theory
that they cherish ahead of what's going
to work."

Mojarro, who had been in the public
school industry for over ten years, was
well aware that the Stanford New
Schools approach to education needed
drastic change.
"Obviously they hired me for a rea
son," he said. "It's not a mystery to any
one it's public information that the
school needed changes. It was not doing
very well academically."
Though Mojarro is hesitant to make
any assumptions about the administration
that preceded him, he says that the class
room structure may have contributed to a
stunted academic development.
Most students were grouped together
and taught in single classrooms despite
age differences first grade with sec
ond and third with fourth. As a result,
said Mojarro, faculty would often have
to teach down in order to accommodate
younger students, who may not be as up
to speed academically as their older
peers a tendency he immediately
worked to change when he arrived by
moving to separate the students by
grade level.
His changes may have benefited from
more time, however, and many pro-
EPAA lobbies felt that the judgment
came too soon. After all, although it had
been in operation for four years, the ele
mentary school had only two years
worth of test scores for only three grades
two, four and eight.
Seventy-eight percent of the 276 stu
dents enrolled in EPAA are English lan
guage learners (ELL), and though born
and raised in the U.S., did not have the
state-standard classroom capabilities in
language arts, Mojarro said.
"Four years is more than enough
time," Piscal countered. "They don't say
it's the kids, but they're saying it's the
kids."
"You don't have four years to teach a
child how to read," he added. "That's just
not acceptable. The kids can't wait that
long, they need the school to work by the
second year."

When East Palo Alto Academy Elementary School (EPAA), a charter school in the Ravenswood school
district, earned low API scores, the Stanford School of Education was taken by surprise. EPAA enlisted
teachers from Stanford's STEP program, and Stanford education faculty were involved in overseeing the
charter school.
Piscal also thought that it took
EPAA High School too long to
reach the level of achievement that
they boast of now sending over
90 percent of their students to col
lege.

"I think Ravenswood school dis
trict did the right thing," he said.
"Stanford School of Education is
running a school where kids are not
learning how to read."
"The prisons are filled with
adults who were poor kids who did
n't learn how to read that's what
the high stakes are, here," he added.
The debate about what makes
charter schools work or not, and
their efficacy in California, remains
lively, and hard-and-fast conclusions
will remain elusive for the foresee
able future. But for Stanford, the
issue is clear: educators failed to
bring the school up to state stan
dards and were denied an extension
because of it.
The worst part is, Mojarro said,
that it's the students and their fami
lies who are left to pick up the
pieces.
"They're scrambling right now,
really, trying to find a place for their
children," said Mojarro, who is ex
pected to run a tight ship to the very
end to ease the transition.
Students are, in fact, still in the
midst of completing the California
Standards Test (CST) the very
same exam responsible for the
school's low status, Mojarro said.
"And, though our school is clos
ing, we are really confident that
come August, our scores are going to
show that we've done wonderfully
this year," he added. "That is going
to be our legacy."

short," Mojarro said."Change is hard for
people, so my initiatives weren't em
braced immediately because it was very
different. So it took awhile for them to
warm up to these ideas. But what hap
pens now it's all dissolved."

of a Stanford alum, Sarah Woodward 'O9,

to design two murals and lead a school

California public schools are evaluat
ed through their Academic Performance
Index (API) scores, which are based on
standardized test results. EPAA had an
API of 606 in 2009; CA's state average
that year was 755.

But, these less-than-stellar numbers
did more than just close EPAA it
also tarnished Stanford's School of Edu
cation's academic reputation.
Mike Piscal, founder of Inner City
Education Foundation (ICEF) public
schools, charges Darling-Flammond
with trying to evade assuming responsi
bility for flaws he perceives in their edu
cational approaches.
"Are you kidding me? East Palo Alto
is like a rough neighborhood in Beverly
Hills compared to South Centro and
Oakland and Compton. It is not a diffi
cult environment to educate a kid."
His intuitions have told him that the
problem is in the institution.
"They've been teaching in the ivory
tower for so long, they don't know how
to teach kids, and they certainly don't
know how to teach the teachers how to
teach them," he said. "Flere's what was
considered one of the best schools of ed
ucation, and they can't run one school."
Piscal, a mere private school English
teacher when he started ICEF in 1991,
has proven he can outperform Stanford
in this charter-school "race to the top."
15 times.

ICEF boasts of having established
five elementary, six middle and four high
schools in South L.A., seven of which
have API scores at or above the state av
erage. The rest have populations that are
too small to provide accurate data from
which the state can calculate API.

One of its latest additions, ICEF Vista
Elementary, is in its second year of oper
ation on a campus a few blocks away
from the projects in Ingle wood, a com
mon hangout for the Bloods. ICEF Vista
has an API of 767.

But, it's more than just working to
ward a test score. Piscal thinks that he's
found a model program that solves the
charter school problems.
"To me, the tests are easy," he said. "If
you have a rigorous college prep educa
tion where the child, when they graduate
from high school, is prepared to go to
Stanford or Berkeley or UC-Davis or
Cal State San Francisco, and you're
preparing them to do college level work,
that'll take care of the test scores."

But Gary Orfield, professor of educa
tion at UCLA's Graduate School of Ed
ucation & Information Studies, said that
he firmly believed that Darling-Ham
mond and her Stanford-trained corps
could have met state standards with

more time. He attributes failing charters
to lackluster administrators, inexperi
enced teachers and an underrepresenta
tion of social factors that impede stu
dents' abilities to learn.

"Those kids have multiple prob
lems," he said. "They come from poor
families with relatively low information.
They have language issues, and they
have a lot of other issues in their lives."

Still, for Piscal, the best way to relate
this expectation to his students and as
sure that they meet the standard is not to
be afraid to ask for help.
"They have good intentions at Stan
ford," he said. "But they put their theory
that they cherish ahead of what's going
to work."

Mojarro, who had been in the public
school industry for over ten years, was
well aware that the Stanford New
Schools approach to education needed
drastic change.
"Obviously they hired me for a rea
son," he said. "It's not a mystery to any
one it's public information that the
school needed changes. It was not doing
very well academically."
Though Mojarro is hesitant to make
any assumptions about the administration
that preceded him, he says that the class
room structure may have contributed to a
stunted academic development.
Most students were grouped together
and taught in single classrooms despite
age differences first grade with sec
ond and third with fourth. As a result,
said Mojarro, faculty would often have
to teach down in order to accommodate
younger students, who may not be as up
to speed academically as their older
peers a tendency he immediately
worked to change when he arrived by
moving to separate the students by
grade level.
His changes may have benefited from
more time, however, and many pro-
EPAA lobbies felt that the judgment
came too soon. After all, although it had
been in operation for four years, the ele
mentary school had only two years
worth of test scores for only three grades
two, four and eight.
Seventy-eight percent of the 276 stu
dents enrolled in EPAA are English lan
guage learners (ELL), and though born
and raised in the U.S., did not have the
state-standard classroom capabilities in
language arts, Mojarro said.
"Four years is more than enough
time," Piscal countered. "They don't say
it's the kids, but they're saying it's the
kids."
"You don't have four years to teach a
child how to read," he added. "That's just
not acceptable. The kids can't wait that
long, they need the school to work by the
second year."

When East Palo Alto Academy Elementary School (EPAA), a charter school in the Ravenswood school
district, earned low API scores, the Stanford School of Education was taken by surprise. EPAA enlisted
teachers from Stanford's STEP program, and Stanford education faculty were involved in overseeing the
charter school.
Piscal also thought that it took
EPAA High School too long to
reach the level of achievement that
they boast of now sending over
90 percent of their students to col
lege.

"I think Ravenswood school dis
trict did the right thing," he said.
"Stanford School of Education is
running a school where kids are not
learning how to read."
"The prisons are filled with
adults who were poor kids who did
n't learn how to read that's what
the high stakes are, here," he added.
The debate about what makes
charter schools work or not, and
their efficacy in California, remains
lively, and hard-and-fast conclusions
will remain elusive for the foresee
able future. But for Stanford, the
issue is clear: educators failed to
bring the school up to state stan
dards and were denied an extension
because of it.
The worst part is, Mojarro said,
that it's the students and their fami
lies who are left to pick up the
pieces.
"They're scrambling right now,
really, trying to find a place for their
children," said Mojarro, who is ex
pected to run a tight ship to the very
end to ease the transition.
Students are, in fact, still in the
midst of completing the California
Standards Test (CST) the very
same exam responsible for the
school's low status, Mojarro said.
"And, though our school is clos
ing, we are really confident that
come August, our scores are going to
show that we've done wonderfully
this year," he added. "That is going
to be our legacy."

Richard Mojarro had only been prin
cipal at East Palo Alto Academy
(EPAA) Elementary School for less
than 10 months when he began making
final preparation for the school's closing
in June,
Like everyone else, the disappoint
ment stung most when he thought about
the potential. While it was rarely said
aloud, there was a widespread expecta
tion for these students to be practically
spoon-fed their academic achievement.
After all, when EPAA opened in 2006
under a charter from the Ravenswood
School District, it looked like a sure-fire
recipe for success.
Most of the teachers were graduates
of the Stanford School of Education's
STEP programs and its star-studded ad
ministration was headed by Linda Dar
ling-Hammond, a School of Education
professor who was on Obama's short-list
for Secretary of Education.
And, really, Stanford wasn't used to
failure.
That's why administrators at the
Stanford School of Education, teachers
and families were unprepared for the
Ravenswood decision. Denied a five
year charter extension by the School
District board, EPAA instead received a
limited two-year extension. Only the
fifth-grade program of the elementary
school will remain open until 2011, and
the high school until 2012, while Stan
ford educators will begin the search for a
new "charter home."
"It was a shock to us because we had
been kind of led to believe that we were
fine and that we didn't have anything to
worry about," said Deborah Stipek, a
member of the Ravenswood board of di
rectors and dean of Stanford's School of
Education. "We didn't find out that they
weren't going to recommend not contin
uing the elementary school until the day
of the board meeting."
Plans had been made. Summer
school, reading programs with Stanford
donors and alumni and a stint with un
dergraduate and graduate students from
the Schools of Engineering and Medi
cine were all in the works.
