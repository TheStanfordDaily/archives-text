# PIAZZZA THE HOMEWORK HELPER

It was 1:30 a.m. and Lucy Richards 'l3 was stuck on the last problem
of her Statics problem set, which was due in several hours. From her
laptop, the bright blue motto of Piazzza.com seemed to address her
directly "Stuck? Need help? Just Ask."
Piazzza yes, with three z's is an online platform that claims to pro
vide "high-quality answers for when you're stuck" by creating a place for
students and teachers to share their questions and answers. And it's avail
able 24-7.
"It is not always easy to meet people in a large lecture format," said
Peter Pham 'll, a Piazzza user and team member. "Piazzza makes it easy
to get help at those desperate times when the deadline for an assignment
is hours away even if you don't know anyone."
Pooja Nath, the founder and CEO of Piazzza and a student at the Stan
ford Graduate School of Business, created Piazzza with exactly this prob
lem in mind. Nath studied computer science at the competitive Indian In
stitute of Technology Kanpur, where she was always one of the rare hand
ful of female students in classes dominated by men. Nath recalled being
too intimidated to ask her peers for help and wishing there were some on
line forum where she could go to discuss homework problems.
Enter Piazzza.
Piazzza enables students to anonymously ask questions when they may
not know anyone else in their classes, or otherwise may be too embar
rassed to seek help bye-mailing a teaching assistant (TA) or going to of
fice hours. Piazzza is currently being tested in Richards' El 4 course as well
CS 110.
"At least in computer science classes it is very difficult to complete
problem sets on your own," said Ravi Sankar 'l2, a computer science
major and member of the 12-person Piazzza team. "Working with others
is crucial, and Piazzza makes this collaboration easier."
To use Piazzza, students simply log onto the website www.Piazzza.com,
and the classes that use Piazzza automatically appear after an initial regis
tration. Students can then post new questions, browse their classmates'
questions and contribute answers, with answers to questions provided stu
dents separated from those provided by professors or TAs.
"My only qualm is the one I reserve for all Internet communities,"
Richards said. "The easier they are to use, the less motivation we have to
actually meet face-to-face. I think there's value in that which can never be
replaced by an online forum, no matter how efficiently it provides you with
the information you need."
Nonetheless, Richards said that Piazzza has been a valuable resource.
"The extremely intuitive, easy and functional interface, and the fact that
everyone really uses it can get you answers quickly and makes it actually
very useful," she said.
Another concern is cheating, but El 4 Prof. Paul Mitiguy said that hasn't
been an issue.
"We want people to work together it's not cheating," he said. "When
midterms and finals come around, if a student has not been doing his or her
own work on the problem sets and [is] just copying, he will fail."
Compared to trying to find answers through general Internet searches,
Piazzza helps students get answers on conceptual and technical questions
that apply specifically to their class.
And according to Mitiguy, Piazzza has helped both his students and the

Ravi Sankar and Cyrus Khajvandi are two members of the Piazzza team, an online website where students can anonymously ask for homework help when they
may not know anyone in their classes. According to Sankar, Piazzza will be available in 30 classes next fall.
El 4 teaching staff Mitiguy and his staff
are committed to being available to
students, as reflected by the roughly 26
hours of office hours they hold every
week. On top of this, Mitiguy said that
he and his TAs stay in the Design
School's Pederson Hall answering stu
dent questions late into the night and,
sometimes, early morning.
But with 130 students, answering
every question at all times just isn't
feasible.
"We still can't do as much as we

would like," Mitiguy said.
Here is where Piazzza has helped.
"Piazzza not only helps us reduce
our workload, it also helps us see what
problems students are struggling with
and what needs to be addressed," said
Tarrence Fong, a TA for El 4 and a
first-year mechanical engineering
graduate student.
According to Sankar, Piazzza aims
to expand into 30 Stanford classes
next fall.

"Hopefully once students have Pi
azzza offered in one of their classes,
they will push for all their classes to be
involved," he said.
