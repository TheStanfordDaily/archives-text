Stanford is recognized internationally
as a forefront for technological ad
vancement. Stanford and the sur
rounding Silicon Valley is an exciting place
to be, especially for those studying green
tech, biotech or web ventures. With that
unique access to true technological innova
tion, students have a huge potential to in
corporate interdisciplinary projects in their
studies and extra-curricular activities. Tra
ditional disciplinary distinctions are quick
ly breaking down as the private and public
sector alike are finding immense value in
interdisciplinary innovation to solve the
world's problems.
Areas that were traditionally for engi
neers or scientists increasingly need input
from different disciplines to improve the
success of projects. With this in mind, Stan
ford students are creating exciting projects
on campus to incorporate the very different
skills and talents available across disci
plines. Dozens of organizations on campus
are involved in this trend, in areas as differ
ent as environmental sustainability, disaster
response, medical innovation, social-entre
preneurship or public service. A great many
student groups are working on this goal of
greater interdisciplinary solutions. Two
projects that stand out as very purposefully
seeking these goals, however, are BASES'
Social-E Challenge and Lotus One.
A coalition of students, faculty and staff
are collaborating on a new housing initia

tive as an incubator for innovation they call
ROW (Reinventing Our World) 2.0, begin
ning with the design and construction of a
new residence called Lotus One (1.0). This
house would be an adaptive community
that seeks creative, interdisciplinary solu
tions for functional and sustainable high
density residences. Applied student re
search would go into innovative building
systems, design and construction processes
and emerging technologies. Its aim to incor
porate students from majors as different as
Civil & Environmental engineering, Biolo
gy, Urban Studies, Earth Systems, Design,
CS or anyone else interested in the initia
tive speak to its philosophy for holistic
problem solving.
BASES' Social-E Challenge is a busi
ness plan competition for entrepreneurial
ventures whose primary goal is to effect so
cial and/or environmental change. Partici
pants ranged from for-profit businesses
with a strong sense of social responsibility,
to nonprofits with sustainable revenue
generation models. The companies seek to
create a positive impact on our society and
the environment through thought leader
ship, student engagement and community
engagement. The event provides partici
pants with $50,000 in final round prizes, as
well as the resources, mentorship and train
ing to launch their startups. Its participants
