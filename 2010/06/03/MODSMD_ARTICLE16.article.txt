# BP must pay the full cost for damages caused by Gulf oil spill
## 
### 
As cascading waves of oil-slick seawa
ter wash over America's Gulf Coast,
the shattered ecosystems and vanish
ing wildlife left behind by this disaster con
tinue to wreak havoc on the local Gulf
economies. When fishermen have no fish and
the beachside hotels have no beaches, mil
lions of people are in danger of losing their
livelihoods. But it is British Petroleum (BP),
not these vulnerable citizens, who imposed
this cost on society, and they are the ones who
should be forced to pay.
To their credit, the oil company BP has ac
knowledged this fact from the beginning,
promising to pay all "legitimate" claims
rather than hiding behind an outdated feder
al law that would limit their liability for lost
economic activity to a meager $75 million.
BP's actions have backed their words they
have issued a $7O million grant to help South
eastern states promote tourism, paid out an
additional $29 million in damages and provid
ed over $625 million so far to aid clean-up ef
forts.

But the federal government must not let
up, and Congress must ensure that BP will be
held accountable for every American dollar
lost because of this calamitous oil spill. Any
thing less would be inviting catastrophe to re
peat itself. Furthermore, reports have sur
faced that the deepwater well was capped by
a relatively cheap form of casing because BP
considered that "the best economic case."

That means someone at the company
weighed the relative cost of risking an oil spill
against the benefit of saving money and con
cluded that the riskier option was better. BP
must be made to see that the greatest eco
nomic risk they face is the continuation of oil
spilling into the Gulf. The more BP has to pay,
the less likely it will be that other companies
take similar risks in the future.

One bill introduced in Congress aims to do
this by raising the cap on BP's liability for lost
profits and wages to $lO billion. The Big Oil
Bailout Prevention Act, introduced by Sen.
Robert Menendez (D-N.J.), combines several
buzzwords and an effort to score political
points with a sound premise that BP must
take responsibility. But many experts caution
that the rush to pinpoint an arbitrary number
might be premature. With an estimated $5.4
billion in damages to the Louisiana fishing
and Florida tourism industries alone, the total
costs might rise far above this number. As
Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) rightly asked,
"Should we have a cap at all?"
A competing proposal from Senators Lisa
Murkowski (R-Alaska) and David Vitter (R-
La.) would have BP cement its promise to pay
by submitting a legal contract defining which
claims it would take responsibility for. In the
ory, it makes sense to outline a set of stan
dards instead of an arbitrary number for
