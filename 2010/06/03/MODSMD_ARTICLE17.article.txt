# Required admission interview would require costly program overhaul
## 
### 
For the past three years, the Admission
Office has been developing a pilot pro
gram that currently offers optional in
terviews to Stanford applicants. As The Daily
reported last week, interviews for Stanford
applicants are currently only offered in
twelve areas, nearly all of them in large met
ropolitan centers with extensive alumni pres
ence. As the Admission Office evaluates the
interview program and considers whether to
make it a mandatory part of the admission
application, the Editorial Board stresses that
several major concerns need to be addressed
before interviews can be required of all ap
plicants.
As it currently stands, the pilot interview
program is only used by a meager section of
the total application pool this year, only
about 2,500 of the estimated 32,000 appli
cants requested an interview, less than eight
percent of those who applied for admission.
One likely reason for the low number of par
ticipants was the limited number of interview
locations. Making an interview an applica
tion requirement expanding the number
of interviewees from 2,500 to more than ten
times that number would present untold
logistical and financial challenges to the Uni
versity. While several peer institutions are
able to maintain a wide network of alumni in
terviewers, it must be taken into account that

their alumni densities by region may be very
different compared to Stanford's, and they
have been interviewing applicants much
longer than we have.

Even if Stanford Admissions is able to en
gage the volume of alumni necessary to inter
view thousands of applicants, training must
be standardized and far-reaching while also
informative. Styles of interviews would vary
widely based on alumni's area of study, pro
fessional background and a myriad of other
factors. Ensuring standard feedback mecha
nisms and an understanding of what ques
tions interviewers will ask will require much
greater development than the standard
rubric. All told, expanding the interview pro
gram into a full application requirement
could require millions of dollars and count
less hours of organizing and outreach. Even
so, the interview program as it currently
stands is severely insufficient and possibly
even unfair to the majority of applicants.
The Editorial Board believes that giving
applicants ways to present themselves out
side of test scores, grades and recommenda
tions is a noble goal. However, our admission
process is a quite rigorous one already. When
over 30,000 applicants are reduced to a select
group of 2,300 admitted students, the process

leaves little room for error. And we
believe that the optional interview
program as it stands gives one seg
ment of the applicant pool those
with the means or proximity to at
tend an interview at one of the 12
current locations a considerable
advantage in that they are able to
provide another layer of personal
texture to their applications.
One final concern that the Edito

rial Board hopes is being addressed
concerns the socio-economic and
ethnic diversity of applicants and
alumni interviewers. Stanford alum
ni come from a myriad of socio-eco
nomic and cultural backgrounds.
However, there is no guarantee that
interviewer and applicant will have
similar cultural or socio-economic
understandings. That is to be expect
ed. But training must be substantial
enough that students from back
grounds different than their inter
viewers are not disadvantaged in the
interview process due to potential
cultural and linguistic biases.
Should the Office of Undergrad

uate Admission consider making an
interview a requirement of all under
graduate applicants, the interview
process must be significantly devel
oped beyond what is presently avail
able in the pilot program. Applicants
must be given reliable access to in
terviews within a reasonable prox
imity to their home areas, as well as
the assurance that they will be evalu
ated fairly and without prejudice.
Accomplishing this expansion of the
program, however, may require
more funds and time than the Ad
mission Office is able to invest at the
present time.
