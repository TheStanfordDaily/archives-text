## Hoop-jumpers and rigid structures 
### ELLIS REID'12 
We view life as a competition and college in
particular as a means to an end. To what end?
Well, a career of course, not to say that a career
isn't just a means to some other end-be it
money, influence or something we haven't
even had time to ponder between soccer prac
tice and cello lessons. David Brooks called us
Organization Kids. He told us that we start
and join clubs not out of the love of the idea
but out of the desire to pad our r?sum?s. Any
thing and everything we do results from one
thought too many. And what do we think of
authority? Wait, I thought the question was
what does authority think of us? As an Orga
nization Kid, I had the impulse to start a club
along with some friends that was to be called
the "Subjectivists of Stanford." Our stated
goal was simple: we wanted to create a group
for philosophical discussion on any and all
topics of interest to any member of the group.
Student Activities and Leadership, a unit of
the Office of Student Affairs, however, felt
that our stated purpose was too broad for the
group to sustain itself in the long term. We also
had to "rethink" our name. Unfortunately for
our group, the broadness of discussion and of
activity that our group aimed to encourage

and the SAL disapproved of was the very rea
son that we wanted to start a group in the first
place. Plus, we liked our name. At Stanford,
student groups must be conceived of very nar
rowly and closely structured around specific
activities like speakers or quarterly publica
tions in order to be approved. It is our position
that the very structure of the SAL, at least as it
pertains to approving student groups, is set up
to discourage creativity and self-expression
and to encourage the development of the Or
ganization Kid. We feel that the worries of the
SAL concerning our group reflect a bias to
wards hoop-jumpers and a rigid structure that
is harmful to the college experience.
The first worry that I want to talk about
has to do with our name. Many of you could
probably guess where we got the inspiration
for our name and therefore could guess the
SAL's objection to it. Guess what? You're
right. The SAL assumed that the name was a
joke intended to make fun of the similarly ti
tled "Objectivists of Stanford." And of course
it was. None of the members of the club care
for Objectivism, the philosophy of Ayn Rand,
and in fact we all happen to reject it. Howev
er, I firmly believe that the SAL shouldn't be

in the business of caring for bruised egos. Cer
tainly Stanford has an interest in protecting
its students from physical risks, but I reject the
idea that Stanford should try to protect its stu
dents from intellectual risks. In fact, Stanford
should encourage that sort of risk. Our name
is in discussion with the "Objectivists," and
shows the way that we intend on going about
philosophical discussion in away different
than they do. If you have an issue with us, you
should say something about it; this sort of di
alogue should be essential to the mission of
Stanford. Students should be encouraged to
continue to think, not to "rethink."
The second worry of the SAL about the
broadness of our club's stated purpose should
also be rejected. We were told that the broad
ness of our club and the fact that we didn't
have a specific "thing" was not suited to the
sustainability of our organization over time.
My objection to this requirement is that it sti
fles creativity and open dialogue. The SAL
shouldn't worry that our club will fizzle in a
few months or even weeks. Quite honestly, I
don't believe that they should worry whether
or not 100 new clubs flounder shortly
after their inception. Money isn't the
problem-we said we might need
some for a publication but that we
probably wouldn't need any. In fact,
feel free to deny us any funding. All
we really need is other people. That's
it. As a formal student group, we
hoped to be able to attract other sim
ilarly interested students to bounce
ideas of off and to have discussions
with. Unfortunately, the SAL doesn't
agree that that is sufficient cause to
be considered an official group. Stu
dents shouldn't have to jump
through hoops while presenting a
PowerPoint presentation on our
group's sustainability plan to SAL in

order to form a student group. We
don't believe that the University
should be encouraging Organization
Kids, trained to jump through hoops
and write resumes. Rather, it should
be encouraging discussion and pro
viding a space for real intellectual
growth.
David Brooks recognized some
thing important in today's students.
In fact, a daily columnist remarks
upon this trend in a recent piece
called "The Hollow Stanford Stu
dent" (I think the name sufficiently
explains the thrust of the authors ar
gument). Undergraduates here at
Stanford tend to be risk-averse, def
erent to faculty, and goal-oriented.
This is a bad thing. After my experi
ence with the SAL, however, I under
stand the origins of this problem bet
ter: much of the University is set up
to make students this way. Want to
start a club? Well let's talk about your

long-term viability and your plans for
expansion into new segments of the
student body. What sorts of activities
will you host? Free-form discussion?
No, that isn't conducive to sustain
ability. While students and professors
alike may lambaste the dominance of
the Organization Kid, with the parts
of the administration that are sup
posed to interact directly with stu
dents are set up as they are now, noth
ing can or will change. As for the
'"Subjectivists." however, we have no
intention of going away. In fact, I
would like to inform all of you about
a new club that's sponsored by every
one who wants something outside of
the norm. I want to invite all of you to
a club that just became official, well
not official exactly, but something
like that. I want to invite all of you to
the "Subjectivists of Stanford."

pertains to approving student groups, is set up
to discourage creativity and self-expression
and to encourage the development of the Or
ganization Kid. We feel that the worries of the
SAL concerning our group reflect a bias to
wards hoop-jumpers and a rigid structure that
is harmful to the college experience.
The first worry that I want to talk about
has to do with our name. Many of you could
probably guess where we got the inspiration
for our name and therefore could guess the
SAL's objection to it. Guess what? You're
right. The SAL assumed that the name was a
joke intended to make fun of the similarly ti
tled "Objectivists of Stanford." And of course
it was. None of the members of the club care
for Objectivism, the philosophy of Ayn Rand,
and in fact we all happen to reject it. Howev
er, I firmly believe that the SAL shouldn't be

in the business of caring for bruised egos. Cer
tainly Stanford has an interest in protecting
its students from physical risks, but I reject the
idea that Stanford should try to protect its stu
dents from intellectual risks. In fact, Stanford
should encourage that sort of risk. Our name
is in discussion with the "Objectivists," and
shows the way that we intend on going about
philosophical discussion in away different
than they do. If you have an issue with us, you
should say something about it; this sort of di
alogue should be essential to the mission of
Stanford. Students should be encouraged to
continue to think, not to "rethink."
The second worry of the SAL about the
broadness of our club's stated purpose should
also be rejected. We were told that the broad
ness of our club and the fact that we didn't
have a specific "thing" was not suited to the
sustainability of our organization over time.
My objection to this requirement is that it sti
fles creativity and open dialogue. The SAL
shouldn't worry that our club will fizzle in a
few months or even weeks. Quite honestly, I
don't believe that they should worry whether
or not 100 new clubs flounder shortly
after their inception. Money isn't the
problem-we said we might need
some for a publication but that we
probably wouldn't need any. In fact,
feel free to deny us any funding. All
we really need is other people. That's
it. As a formal student group, we
hoped to be able to attract other sim
ilarly interested students to bounce
ideas of off and to have discussions
with. Unfortunately, the SAL doesn't
agree that that is sufficient cause to
be considered an official group. Stu
dents shouldn't have to jump
through hoops while presenting a
PowerPoint presentation on our
group's sustainability plan to SAL in

order to form a student group. We
don't believe that the University
should be encouraging Organization
Kids, trained to jump through hoops
and write resumes. Rather, it should
be encouraging discussion and pro
viding a space for real intellectual
growth.
David Brooks recognized some
thing important in today's students.
In fact, a daily columnist remarks
upon this trend in a recent piece
called "The Hollow Stanford Stu
dent" (I think the name sufficiently
explains the thrust of the authors ar
gument). Undergraduates here at
Stanford tend to be risk-averse, def
erent to faculty, and goal-oriented.
This is a bad thing. After my experi
ence with the SAL, however, I under
stand the origins of this problem bet
ter: much of the University is set up
to make students this way. Want to
start a club? Well let's talk about your

long-term viability and your plans for
expansion into new segments of the
student body. What sorts of activities
will you host? Free-form discussion?
No, that isn't conducive to sustain
ability. While students and professors
alike may lambaste the dominance of
the Organization Kid, with the parts
of the administration that are sup
posed to interact directly with stu
dents are set up as they are now, noth
ing can or will change. As for the
'"Subjectivists." however, we have no
intention of going away. In fact, I
would like to inform all of you about
a new club that's sponsored by every
one who wants something outside of
the norm. I want to invite all of you to
a club that just became official, well
not official exactly, but something
like that. I want to invite all of you to
the "Subjectivists of Stanford."
