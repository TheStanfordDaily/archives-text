# ALTERNATIVE LIVING...WITHOUT THE NAKED
## All I Have Left to Say 
### Samantha Toh 
Yesterday evening, with a mug of tea in
one hand and cookies in another, I
asked my venerable friend Timmy,
"What should my last column say?"
"Everybody writes in their last column
about how it's their last column," Timmy
said, with a duh look on his face. There was a
pause, and then he turned abruptly back to
his statistics problem set, his face wrinkling in
pain.

I reflected upon Timmy's wisdom. And as
the honeyed sobs of his statistics hatred filled
the room, I pondered the effects that Vol. 237
of The Daily, weekly deadlines and hours of
writing had on my quarter.
Initially, I thought a column would be nice
only because I had too much to say and few
places to say it. As one of the most opinionat
ed, talkative people I know, expressing my
self through a new outlet and reaching out to
anonymous readers seemed like quite an ex
citing opportunity. Column-writing would

simply be a long, drawn-out process of con
versation, where I could talk in large
amounts, and those interested enough would

respond.
One would imagine that with such an un
equal amount of expression, I would be
doing little of the learning. The contrary, in
fact, was true. Sometimes I would start out
wanting to express one philosophy, only to
end a column realizing how different what I
believed in was from what I thought I be
lieved in. The act of writing clarified my
stances on relationships between people, be
tween humans and the environment and be
tween myself and the peculiar, unexplainable
knots in my life.
This made me think about the importance
of communication, and the idea that express
ing oneself does not simply translate to
greater information for one's audience. Of
tentimes, the act of expressing clarifies so
much for the person expressing it too in

occasionally cathartic and surprising ways.
I still recall, one not-so-faraway day in
May, how I was trying to explain some per
sonal choices to a friend. The situation had
been typically unimportant: I was trying to
elucidate why, contrary to the expectations of
life in college, I had chosen not to partake in
wild sexual misdemeanors with multiple
partners every weekend at parties (or some
variation of this image). In trying to articu
late my position, I had had difficulty finding
words. In my head was giant blob of emotion
that howled "NOOO!" whenever I contem
plated jumping into the wild side of sex, drugs
and rock 'n' roll.
I finally found reasons. I talked about how

sexual gratification on a physical
level was personally meaningless
without a sense of trust or purpose. I
talked about the context from which
I emerged a fairly conservative,
repressed society. I explained how
other people's expectations of col
lege did not pressure me enough to
fulfill those expectations; I was
happy finding my own flower-wear
ing-lazy-sloth-napping-all-day
route. And best of all, putting my rea
sons into words enlightened not just

my friend, but it enlightened me as
well. I had transformed an emotion
al blob of "NOOO!" into a realiza
tion of my preferences and personal
ity.
Learning from my own expres
sion was, thus, the most rewarding
part of my columnist journey. Cer
tainly, there were other perks as well,
notably fame. My pharmacist once
looked at the name on my prescrip
tion and said, surprised, "Oh, I read
your column!" Some of my friends
mention articles they particularly
enjoy each week, which always cre
ates a cliched warmth in my belly. On
one particularly hilarious occasion, I
was hit on at a party. The only rea
son? This nice acquaintance of mine

asked that I write about him in The
Daily. Well here you go, nice man.
Here you go.
All in all, what an excellent ad
venture. I may not have squid-hunt
ed and sea-fared through Vol. 237,
but I came close. Writing about
everything, from conversations and
plastic bags to falling off hammocks
on warm days, made me happy. It
also made me learn in ways I never
expected. And so, in my last column
about my last column, I only have
one thing left to say: I am glad to
have experienced a slice of alterna
tive living ... without the naked.
