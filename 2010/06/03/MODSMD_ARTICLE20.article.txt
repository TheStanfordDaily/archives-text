Yet another year draws to a close, and
with it comes the promise of new ad
ventures, new scientific discoveries
and, of course, sappy yet sentimental articles
and speeches reminiscing on the past and at
tempting to be inspiring. After five years and
two degrees, Stanford is finally kicking me
out the door, and I won't try to conceal my
own attempt at the latter.
Over the past couple of months, we've lit
erally talked about everything in the uni
verse, from finding life far beyond the galaxy,
to unlocking the secrets of the tiniest sub
atomic particles. We've talked about the in
credible benefits research can bring us, from
cancer treatments to the space shuttle, and
we've also talked about the dangers of misus
ing science and technology, from the Deep
water Horizon Leak to AIDS denialism.
We've talked about poetry, sleeping, laughter
and why Stanford is definitively the best uni
versity in the world. Perhaps to put it all in
context, it's best to look to our founders, to
see where the Stanford spirit comes from.
Anyone who has been on a Stanford tour
knows that Leland and Jane Stanford found
ed the University to honor their son Leland
Junior, who died of typhoid at the tender age
of 15. In the face of incredible tragedy, the
Stanfords chose to memorialize their son by

giving other children in the world the chance
at a successful life their son never had. Jane
Stanford admonished her first class of stu
dents that she wasn't just giving them a world
class university, but that she expected them to
use the skills they developed to help better
the world around them. In the same spirit,
Stanford's first president, David Starr Jordan,
selected the motto "The Wind of Freedom
Blows," to inspire Stanford students to use
their knowledge to spread freedom and hope
throughout the world. But again, rather than
take the advice of people who died long ago,
let's look at some recent studies in science on
the importance of altruism.
A study out of Harvard last August looked
at altruistic tendencies in both small children
and chimpanzees. The journal article in
"Trends in Cognitive Science" is one of a

small handful of works that includes both in
formative graphs and tables, and adorable
pictures of small children. The study conclud
ed that from an early age, children are born
with a desire to be helpful and generous.
While the study did not look into a mecha
nism, the researchers posited that social rein
forcement is necessary to maintain altruistic
tendencies as children mature. Perhaps it
seems trite, but there's something comforting
in knowing that science confirms that people
are naturally born with the instincts to help
each other.

Coming from an entirely different angle, a
series of studies out of the University of Not
tingham in 2008 and 2010 analyzed how altru
ism played a role in sexual selection. Several
hundred participants were analyzed both by
acting altruistically themselves, and by pref
erence for altruistic people. The correlation
between the two was a predictably high .82,
and one of the more interesting results found
was that longer lasting relationships involved
a significantly higher amount of people who
were both altruistic and desired altruistic
partners. While it doesn't take a scientist to
figure out that people that help others more
than themselves take care of their partners
