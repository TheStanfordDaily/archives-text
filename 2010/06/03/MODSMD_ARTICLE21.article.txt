# THE 						GAO REPORT
## An Open Letter to the University 
### Shelley Gao 
My weekly columns in Volumes 236
and 237 of The Daily have been un
derpinned by the concept of shared
governance, where we, the students have an
active input in shaping the University's deci
sion making. As important stakeholders in
our University's governance, we have a re
sponsibility to improve Stanford for the sake
of our own time here, but also to leave the
Farm a better place than we found it. So, as
the year ends, 1 would like to summarize what
I think are the most important issues:

Undergraduate Education
Now that the worst of the budget cuts cri
sis is over, and given the largely optimistic as
sessment offered by the provost in his annu
al budget presentation to the Faculty Senate
last week, Stanford can once more focus on
strengthening the core and distinct elements
of undergraduate education. Opportunities
like Introductory Seminars, Sophomore Col
lege, research grants, study abroad options
and Stanford in Washington are highlights of
the academic experience, helping to cultivate
faculty relationships and stimulate new intel
lectual interests and advanced scholarship.
The current framework of pre-major ad
vising is adequate. Rather than making cos
metic enhancements like "Major's Nights,"
the University needs to create incentives for
tenure track faculty to serve as advisors for
freshmen and sophomores. While profes
sional staff members can play a role, nothing
can replace direct interaction with experts in
the field. Additionally, individual depart
ments in collaboration with VPUE should
offer comprehensive non-professional
schools advising, particularly for students in
terested in pursuing MA and Ph.D. degrees
in humanities and social sciences.

In terms of General Education Require
ments (GERs), the Study on Undergraduate
Education needs to take a long and critical
look at Introduction to Humanities (IHUM)
and the Program in Writing and Rhetoric
(PWR). After years of so-called "reform,"
manifested in "Open Houses" that adds
nothing except to endorse the status quo,
these programs require serious structural
change. On a campus dominated by science
and engineering, humanities are relegated to
obscurity in classroom and campus dis
course. The curricular shift away from West
ern Civilization and the classics will frankly
produce a generation of future elites utterly

ignorant of the foundation of Western litera
ture, philosophy and politics.
Admission and Financial Aid
Stanford needs to invest in international
need-blind admissions to truly realize its role
as a global university and its internationaliza
tion agenda. Although it is a part of the Stan
ford Challenge, the University needs to
reprioritize fundraising efforts to ensure that
non-U.S. citizens or Permanent Residents
can access a Stanford education regardless of
their financial backgrounds. With an already
lower percentage of foreign undergraduates
compared to Ivy League peers (six percent
vs. 10 percent), Stanford is lagging behind our
peers. The current practice of rejecting many
compelling candidates who would be admit
ted if their ability to pay were not a consider
ation diminishes Stanford's ability to attract
the world's best talent. Furthermore, it jeop
ardizes Jane Stanford's directive that the
University serve as "an avenue whereby the
deserving and exceptional may rise through
their own efforts from the lowest to the high
est station in life."

Residential Education and Flousing

The mission of Residential
Education(ResEd) and its manifestation
needs to be thoroughly evaluated. The over
whelming programming in freshman dorms
under the guise of "community building" that
stifles individualism and enforces ideological
conformity needs to be eliminated. Despite
the progress made in housing-student rela
tions due to "unstuffing" of undergraduate
residences, the recent mishap in assignment
process that resulted in many row house
staffers next year being deprived of their sin
gle has caused the eruption of new tensions.
ResEd: seriously, get your act together. Stu
dents: stop being so helpless. Do not just sit

there and let your God-given right to
a single be stripped due to sheer in
competence of bureaucracy. Agitate,
unionize and strike!

The most significant barrier to
ensuring legitimate student partici
pation in University decision-mak
ing and the realization of the above
goals is one of our own making. Cer

tainly, there is a structural compo
nent. Instead of championing prag
matic academic and student life is
sues, vocal interest groups dominate
the student government, pushing
forward a narrow agenda that has
questionable overall benefits but is
nevertheless implicitly endorsed as
result of the oppressive culture of
political correctness on campus.
This really should be an open let
ter to my fellow peers. If the notion
of good stewardship and shared
governance do not appeal to you,
then consider the $50,000 a year you

pay in tuition and board. The value
of our money gives rise to the ex
pectation that we deserve to receive
a high level of service from Stan
ford. So, be engaged with campus
news. Be assertive when dealing
with administrators or applying for
programs and funds. Be proactive in
making Stanford the experience
you want it to be.

nist. But, she loves Stanford even
more. Contact Shelley at sxgao@stan
