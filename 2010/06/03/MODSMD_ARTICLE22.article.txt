# JUST A THOUGHT
## On Life. (Or, if you can't comprehend sarcasm, just skip the first half.)

Other people at Stanford provide amaz
ing insight to discover more about one
self. For instance, I've been fortunate
enough to follow a series of pieces in The
Daily this year that has informed me about my
own character (no, that's not a reference to
this God-given gift of a column) by virtue of
being a male.

I was fascinated to discover from another
writer that, because I am a man, I engage both
consciously and subconsciously in the subju
gation of women. It was furthermore shocking
to find out that I am a homophobe due to my
association with the Greek scene, a chauvinist
by virtue of having a Y-chromosome and a
sex-craved, hormone-driven caveman be
cause I have a penis.
If it wasn't for a specific elucidating Daily
column I followed each week, the opportunity
for this catharsis would never have come
about. I'm surprised that I wasn't aware of
how much of a stereotypical type-A sexist
meathead I am I must have been too busy
promoting negative gender stereotypes and

pursuing sex to notice. Given the weekly
epiphanies in this column that all men are in
herently oppressive and abusive, I'm sur
prised we don't all play lacrosse for the Uni
versity of Virginia.
Or maybe I was wrong to agree so quickly
with these ideas. Maybe by conceding the
points of such sexist thought thinly veiled be
hind the inviolate guise of feminism, I was al
lowing myself to be persuaded by cliched
stereotypes. Maybe it's possible to be both a
man and a proponent of gender equality
(though the enlightened reader of the afore
mentioned series would argue otherwise).

Other people are an invaluable tool to
learning more about people. One thing I've
learned from them is that people can't be bro
ken down and compartmentalized into
stereotypes.

The point of all the abstract moral philoso
phy and heavy-handed social psychology this
column has churned out for the past four
months can be summarized simply: people are
not easily reducible to cliches. They are much
more multifaceted than we are willing to give
them credit for being.

The reason we love movies is because
screenwriters develop plot lines that facilitate
simple thinking. There are heroes and villains,
and most situations can be easily approached
through a lens of "right" and "wrong" that
clearly sets apart virtue from vice. Life would
be much easier if people were so uncomplicat
ed.

Unfortunately, they're not.
Fortunately, Stanford provides people with
