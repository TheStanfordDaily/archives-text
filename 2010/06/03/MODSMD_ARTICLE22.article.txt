# JUST A THOUGHT
## On Life. (Or, if you can't comprehend sarcasm, just skip the first half.)

Other people at Stanford provide amaz
ing insight to discover more about one
self. For instance, I've been fortunate
enough to follow a series of pieces in The
Daily this year that has informed me about my
own character (no, that's not a reference to
this God-given gift of a column) by virtue of
being a male.

I was fascinated to discover from another
writer that, because I am a man, I engage both
consciously and subconsciously in the subju
gation of women. It was furthermore shocking
to find out that I am a homophobe due to my
association with the Greek scene, a chauvinist
by virtue of having a Y-chromosome and a
sex-craved, hormone-driven caveman be
cause I have a penis.
If it wasn't for a specific elucidating Daily
column I followed each week, the opportunity
for this catharsis would never have come
about. I'm surprised that I wasn't aware of
how much of a stereotypical type-A sexist
meathead I am I must have been too busy
promoting negative gender stereotypes and

pursuing sex to notice. Given the weekly
epiphanies in this column that all men are in
herently oppressive and abusive, I'm sur
prised we don't all play lacrosse for the Uni
versity of Virginia.
Or maybe I was wrong to agree so quickly
with these ideas. Maybe by conceding the
points of such sexist thought thinly veiled be
hind the inviolate guise of feminism, I was al
lowing myself to be persuaded by cliched
stereotypes. Maybe it's possible to be both a
man and a proponent of gender equality
(though the enlightened reader of the afore
mentioned series would argue otherwise).

Other people are an invaluable tool to
learning more about people. One thing I've
learned from them is that people can't be bro
ken down and compartmentalized into
stereotypes.

The point of all the abstract moral philoso
phy and heavy-handed social psychology this
column has churned out for the past four
months can be summarized simply: people are
not easily reducible to cliches. They are much
more multifaceted than we are willing to give
them credit for being.

The reason we love movies is because
screenwriters develop plot lines that facilitate
simple thinking. There are heroes and villains,
and most situations can be easily approached
through a lens of "right" and "wrong" that
clearly sets apart virtue from vice. Life would
be much easier if people were so uncomplicat
ed.

Unfortunately, they're not.
Fortunately, Stanford provides people with

the opportunity to experience the fas
cinating diversity and contradictions
that can present themselves in peo
ple, There are fraternity feminists,
pro-war vegans and humble varsity
athletes. All such people would seem
to undermine the popular stereo
types to which we find ourselves de
faulting when we want so badly to
pass judgment on an entire group.
People will always be quick to
label you yes, you. It's much easier
to use one of your relevant traits as a
heuristic to judge who you are as a
person than it is to get to know you,
especially if you undermine other
people's generalized assumptions.
Cliches are the hallmark of a lazy
mind. (That sentence is ironic.) Irri
tatingly enough, the world is full of

people more eager to pigeonhole you
than to get to know you.These people
may never realize that not only do ex
ceptions to the rule exist, but also that
oftentimes, there is no rule.

The point (yes, there is one) is:
don't fall into lazy cliches or be too
quick to judge circumstances. Four
years at Stanford give lucky under
graduates the priceless opportunity
to learn this lesson.

And that moral of the story lends
itself to yet another, more holistic les
son: don't take yourself or life too se
riously. Life is too damn short and
you'll run the risk of becoming a bor
ing person (all spit and spite, and no
delight). Breaking free of labels and
stereotypes is a healthy exercise in
awareness with the simple lesson that
people are indefinable.
Achievements, bank accounts,
CPAs, social circles, trendy fashions,
holier-than-thou attitudes, physical
prowess, pitying condescension, socie
tal status ... None of it is solely repre

sentative of a person, and nobody can
be compartmentalized to such simple,
readily available traits. If you get
caught up in such small details, you
will run the risk of taking life too seri
ously.
All this arguably supercilious ad
vice is ironic coming from a 21-year
old frat boy. But maybe those traits
don't define me or my ability to have
meaningful insights. And similarly,
your surface qualities will never have
the power to define you, regardless of
how people may try to compartmen
talize you. Beware of people so ready
to focus on the small stuff that they
miss the big picture life is too short
to take them seriously.
As Aristotle once remarked, "Hus
tle mean hard work, if you scared go to
church, man this philosophy is easy,
every thought I get I murk."
