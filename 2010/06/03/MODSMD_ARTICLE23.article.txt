# UNFASHIONABLE NONSENSE
## Saying Goodbye to Stanford 
### Emily Hulme 
No, I am not a senior. My goodbyes are
not goodbyes for good, but goodbyes
for now.

But, if I may dare to generalize the impos
sibly unique experiences of some 6,000-plus
individual undergraduates, I think it's safe to
say that we all can feel that the end of a year
whether you're a freshman or a senior is
something of a real goodbye, a tangible end to
something special.
While I was back home during our last
break, a certain insipid song by Owl City came
on the radio while I was driving with my best
friend from high school, Shelby. Neither of us
particularly likes the song. It came to one line,
"I'm weird because I hate goodbyes," and
Shelby, with a deserved dose of righteous in
dignation, replied to the singer: "No, you're
not weird because you hate goodbyes. You're
not. Everyone hates them."
And, of course, she's right.

By my lights, a goodbye is precisely the mo
ment when you look up and see what you've
made of your life and what you've missed.
A goodbye is when you take your eyes off the
road in front of you that you've set for yourself
and, let's be real here, if you're a Stanford
student, you've probably designed, built, ana
lyzed, psychoanalyzed, destroyed and rebuilt
the path you're now on at least once or twice
and realize that there were other exits you
could have taken. Some are receding far be
hind, touching the horizon; some are just in

your blind spot; and others are just about to
pass right now. Again, I'll commit the venial
sin of generalizing my eccentric and highly in
dividual peers: as a group, Stanford students
have many opportunities. The number of po
tential careers that any given Stanford fresh
man could not just pursue but rock is probably
greater than the number of licks it takes to get
to the center of a tootsie roll pop and, yes,
Mr. Owl, that's a damn lot more than three.
Perhaps I'm mistaken, but it seems to me that
college is not some direct path connecting
high school to life. This school demands of us,
and we demand of ourselves, something
greater than that. It demands that we cut our
own path, because the prefab ones just won't
do. Sometimes it's easier to keep your eyes on
the GPS, where streets are simplified and dis
tractions are minimized into a few bland

shapes, than to take the time to see
what's really going on all around you.
But when we say goodbye, we
force ourselves out of routine, be
cause the routine itself is not immor
tal. I will not be a Stanford junior for
ever; in fact, I won't even be one for
another two weeks. For fairly obvious
emotional, psychosomatic and en
tropic reasons, this can be designated
as horrifying. Everyone hates good
byes.
I could argue that goodbyes are
also the sign of the birth of something

new, etc. etc., so we should really em
brace them, but I think that misses the
point. It's just true that goodbyes are
hard, and I think it's more or less the
case that they always will be. It's not
that I don't realize moving on will
bring me better things Lord knows
that being a freshman forever would
not be a dream, but a nightmare, con
sidering that Wilbur Dining food gets
old within plus or minus 14 days for
each and every incoming freshman
class. It's that I'm unsure of the future
and justifiably disappointed because I
am losing something valuable. I am
being torn away all at once from
something familiar and actual in ex
change for something foreign and po
tential.
So, I'll be saying goodbye to Stan

ford for a while and much of the
Class of 2010 forever. My consolation
isn't that this shouldn't be upsetting,
but that it should be. It's not that all
change is good, but that some isn't
bad. What's great about Stanford,
what's great about the Stanford Class
of 2010 and what's great about each
individual here, is all due to these up
setting goodbyes giving us the free
dom to take up a paper map to chart
our course, turn "Party in the USA"
up loud and drive.

In an uncharacteristically sincere mo
ment, Emily feels compelled to say she
has absolutely loved writing a column
in The Daily. Send snide remarks and
stray observations to ehulme@stan
