# UNFASHIONABLE NONSENSE
## Saying Goodbye to Stanford 
### Emily Hulme 
No, I am not a senior. My goodbyes are
not goodbyes for good, but goodbyes
for now.

But, if I may dare to generalize the impos
sibly unique experiences of some 6,000-plus
individual undergraduates, I think it's safe to
say that we all can feel that the end of a year
whether you're a freshman or a senior is
something of a real goodbye, a tangible end to
something special.
While I was back home during our last
break, a certain insipid song by Owl City came
on the radio while I was driving with my best
friend from high school, Shelby. Neither of us
particularly likes the song. It came to one line,
"I'm weird because I hate goodbyes," and
Shelby, with a deserved dose of righteous in
dignation, replied to the singer: "No, you're
not weird because you hate goodbyes. You're
not. Everyone hates them."
And, of course, she's right.

By my lights, a goodbye is precisely the mo
ment when you look up and see what you've
made of your life and what you've missed.
A goodbye is when you take your eyes off the
road in front of you that you've set for yourself
and, let's be real here, if you're a Stanford
student, you've probably designed, built, ana
lyzed, psychoanalyzed, destroyed and rebuilt
the path you're now on at least once or twice
and realize that there were other exits you
could have taken. Some are receding far be
hind, touching the horizon; some are just in

your blind spot; and others are just about to
pass right now. Again, I'll commit the venial
sin of generalizing my eccentric and highly in
dividual peers: as a group, Stanford students
have many opportunities. The number of po
tential careers that any given Stanford fresh
man could not just pursue but rock is probably
greater than the number of licks it takes to get
to the center of a tootsie roll pop and, yes,
Mr. Owl, that's a damn lot more than three.
Perhaps I'm mistaken, but it seems to me that
college is not some direct path connecting
high school to life. This school demands of us,
and we demand of ourselves, something
greater than that. It demands that we cut our
own path, because the prefab ones just won't
do. Sometimes it's easier to keep your eyes on
the GPS, where streets are simplified and dis
tractions are minimized into a few bland
