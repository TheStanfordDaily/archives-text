## Private carriers to run Roble package center 
### KABIR SAWHNEY DESK EDITOR 
Details are emerging about the
proposal from Student Housing to
reroute students' privately shipped
mail from housing front desks to a
"package center" behind Roble Hall.
Housing Executive Director Rodger
Whitney and Dean of Residential
Education Deborah Golder an
nounced the proposal, set to go into
effect Sept. 1, last month.
Starting fall quarter, students in
campus residences will no longer be
allowed to receive packages from
private carriers, such as UPS and
FedEx, at their doors. Instead, all
packages will be directed to a new
"package center" in a former kitchen
behind Roble Hall. The site is acces
sible via the road between Roble and
Lake Lagunita.

Under the terms of an agreement
between the University and shipping
companies, the private carriers will
cover the cost of setting up and run
ning the center, and will operate it. A
second package center will be creat
ed in Escondido Village to serve the
graduate student community as well
as undergraduates living there or in
Rains apartments.

Carriers will notify package recip
ients via e-mail when their packages
are available for pickup at the center.
Meanwhile, mail sent via the U.S.
Postal Service will continue to go to
the Stanford post office, where each

student will be required to rent a box
as their permanent mailing address.
The status of package delivery to
Row houses is still unclear. Row
houses were never specifically dis
cussed, but Row residents will have
the option to have packages deliv
ered to the center, according to Imo
gen Hinds, senior associate director
in Student Housing. While the hous

es might still be able to receive pack
ages, it is possible that delivery com
panies will divert all packages to the
center for efficiency.

Whitney cited security concerns
as part of the reasoning behind the
new center in an e-mail to The Daily.
"For some time now, students
have been expressing concern about
missing packages and need for more

accurate tracking of packages,"
Whitney said. "We've also had signif
icant concerns around package de
livery staff entering residences."
"The package center ... will en
sure secure storage, complete track
ing of packages and convenient pick
up hours," he added.

A UPS truck makes a delivery at Jerry. Mail shipped privately to Row houses may be diverted to a new "package
center" behind Roble in the fall. Private mail to dorms will go to the center, to be housed in Roble's former kitchen.
