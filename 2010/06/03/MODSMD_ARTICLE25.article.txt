## Still no move between nurses, hospitals 
### AN LE NGUYEN DESK EDITOR 
A week after the Committee for
Recognition of Nursing Achieve
ment (CRONA) proposed a cooling
off period to settle the ongoing con
tract stalemate with Stanford Hospi
tal & Clinics (SHC) and Lucile
Packard Children's Hospital
(LPCH), the hospitals have not
budged on their final contract offer.
Last Thursday, CRONA urged

the hospitals to engage in a cooling
off interval for contract bargaining
from now until Dec. 31. The union is
still protesting reduced medical ben
efits and nurse demotions that would
occur under the hospitals' "last, best
and final offer."

Peter Nussbaum, the lead attor
ney for CRONA, said that under the
latest proposal, "the parties would
agree that during the next six months
... the employees will continue to
work under the old contract and

we'll continue to bargain." Wage in
creases included in the "last, best and
final offer" would not be put into ef
fect during the cool-off period.
"This would give the parties more
time to be able to sit down, work
something out, maybe enlist the as
sistance of a third party to help
them," Nussbaum added. "That's
what parties do when they cannot
reach a contract."
In May, the hospitals rejected a dif
ferent counterproposal and second
proposition to resolve the contract dis
pute through interest arbitration.
For the past two months, the hospi
tals and their nurses have been operat
ing under the prior contract, which ex
pired at the end of March. Nussbaum
indicated that this strategy "can go on
until something happens."

That "something," he said, would ei
ther be an amicable resolution if "the
parties reach a new agreement" or con
tinued tensions if "the hospitals try to
unilaterally implement their old agree
ment."

CRONA has argued that the latter
approach would be illegal; unilateral
implementation is only legitimate if the
parties have reach an impasse, after
bargaining in good faith has failed to
draw out a resolution.
"We think it's clear that the hospi
tals have not met that duty," Nussbaum
said.
The hospitals, however, have not ex

pressed any signs of intere st in the cool
ing-off proposal. In an e-mail to The
Daily, LPCH spokesman Robert Dicks
said the hospitals "have no comment"
on CRONA's latest suggestions.
"Our nurses deserve the benefits of
the proposed contracts," Dicks said, re
ferring to the "last, best and final offer."
"We stand by our offers and urge
CRONA to ratify a new contract so
that we can move forward together
and continue providing the very best
care to our patients," he said.
