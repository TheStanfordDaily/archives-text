## Still no move between nurses, hospitals 
### AN LE NGUYEN DESK EDITOR 
A week after the Committee for
Recognition of Nursing Achieve
ment (CRONA) proposed a cooling
off period to settle the ongoing con
tract stalemate with Stanford Hospi
tal & Clinics (SHC) and Lucile
Packard Children's Hospital
(LPCH), the hospitals have not
budged on their final contract offer.
Last Thursday, CRONA urged

the hospitals to engage in a cooling
off interval for contract bargaining
from now until Dec. 31. The union is
still protesting reduced medical ben
efits and nurse demotions that would
occur under the hospitals' "last, best
and final offer."

Peter Nussbaum, the lead attor
ney for CRONA, said that under the
latest proposal, "the parties would
agree that during the next six months
... the employees will continue to
work under the old contract and

we'll continue to bargain." Wage in
creases included in the "last, best and
final offer" would not be put into ef
fect during the cool-off period.
"This would give the parties more
time to be able to sit down, work
something out, maybe enlist the as
sistance of a third party to help
them," Nussbaum added. "That's
what parties do when they cannot
reach a contract."
