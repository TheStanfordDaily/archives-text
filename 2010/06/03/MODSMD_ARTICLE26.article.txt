M M very single creative spark will be
■ ® put into one massive fantastic
arena, featuring some of the
most exciting and
sought-after electronic performers. The entire
arena will be transformed into a place where
dreams can be both seen and heard." This past
weekend, at the famed Cow Palace (where the
Beatles and the Rolling Stones both played in
their heyday), over 15,000 people flocked to
one of the largest electronic music events that
the West Coast has to offer. ETD POP 2010:
The Dream was exactly what its website pro
moted an ethereal, enormous and jam
packed rave that both electronic diehards and
casual partygoers alike attended.
The Electric Techno Disco Popsicle (ETD
POP) was first held in 1997, and has steadily
grown in popularity since. Annually featuring
the world's most famous DJs and electronic
artists, it is one of many festivals on the West
Coast that ensure not only high quality music,
but also state-of-the-art light shows, an ener
getic crowd and an all-night party. Sold out
just a few days before the concert, this year's
ETD POP was titled "The Dream," with the
idea that those attending would feel trans
ported to a dream world, with excessive glit
ter, fog, lights and an incredible amount of
white. What made it truly like a dream for
most, however, was this year's musical lineup.
With trance god Armin Van Buuren and the
incredibly popular Infected Mushroom head
lining, world-renowned DJs like Boys Noize,
Steve Aoki and Benny Benassi were just icing
on the cake.

Upon parking in the massive Cow Palace
lot, it became quite evident that this was not
just an ordinary concert. Dressing in all white,
as the website encouraged, was quite conserva
tive. Most concertgoers were completely
decked out in traditional rave gear, with tutus,

furry boots, incredible amounts of beaded jew
elry (or kandi, as it is called in the rave world)
and other neon and outlandish getups. Glow
sticks were a must, and many had gone a step
further, wearing copious amounts of LED
lights on all parts of the body. After a long line
to get through the intense security process, In
termission made it inside to catch the tail end of
Stanford favorite LA Riots' set. With a giant
rotating DJ platform in the middle of the
arena, it was impossible to have a bad view. The
light shows were like candy to the eyes, and the
excitement was clearly building to a frenzy,
even as early as 5:30 p.m.
After LA Riots, Gareth Emery took the
stage. After gaining considerable popularity in
the past few years, his anticipated set consisted
of addicting trance and, as droves of people
came in from outside, the floor began to fill
with dancers. Placed on platforms throughout
the arena, hired dancers swayed and gyrated in
beautiful white costumes, glittering and flash
ing under all of the lights. After Emery left the
turntables, the hypnotic voice that was placed
between each set boomed over the audience,
"Attention dreamers," it said, sounding like a
soothing flight attendant. "Let your mind be
free and dream to ... Steve Aoki." Cheers
throughout Cow Palace went up as Aoki
dropped his now-trademark mix of music from
"The Lion King." The arena thumped as the
bass soared over thousands of dancers. The
electro house DJ was certainly a different vibe
from the one before him, but he was a wonder
ful prelude to the highlight of the night, Boys
Noize.

Hailing from Germany, Alexander Ridha
(or Boys Noize) has earned a huge following in
the world of house music, and his fans were cer
tainly not disappointed at this year's ETD POP.
His set was incredible throughout, and Fedde
le Grand, who followed, did well at keeping up.

DJ superstar Benny Benassi was next, and he
proved why he is considered one of the best
DJs in the world. With his 2007 smash hit "Sat
isfaction," Benassi is one of few house DJs that
have reached household name status, and both
hardcore ravers and electronic amateurs knew
exactly who he was. When he dropped the Red
Hot Chili Peppers' "Otherside," the audience
enjoyed a rare moment singing along together.
Taking the stage at the climax of the night was
Dutch trance DJ Armin van Buuren. Ranked
as the number one DJ in the world for the past
three years by DJ Magazine, van Buuren is the
ultimate heavy hitter in the world of trance.
Despite the audience having been on their feet
for the past six hours, nothing felt more like a
dream than van Buuren's trance set, which was
only enhanced by glitter falling from the ceiling
of the arena. In order to beat the traffic, Inter
mission left before Infected Mushroom's set,
despite the enormous popularity of the experi
mental psytrance group.
While beautifully executed and both visual

ly and audibly stunning, ETD POP 2010 was
not without conflict and tragedy. With over 65
people arrested for selling illegal substances
and copious amounts of drugs confiscated, it is
clear that Ecstasy, normally associated with
rave culture, was running rampant at the event.
Because of buying drugs laced with toxins, 11
attendees were rushed to the hospital, with one
young man from Santa Clara dying as a result.
This gruesome situation served as a reminder
to be safe in environments like ETD POP
where drugs are highly prevalent. The hospital
izations and death were nightmares in the
midst of an otherwise beautiful dream.

Featuring some of the world's most talented
electronic artists and light shows that you
would have to see to believe, ETD POP 2010:
The Dream was truly an event like no other,
and certainly one that Intermission did not
want to wake up from.
