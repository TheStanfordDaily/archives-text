# She & Him win over the crowd with retro flair

The crowd of floral-printed, funky
hairdo-ed hipsters at the She &
Him concert was no surprise.
Zooey Deschanel has been the
poster girl for this retro-hipster movement
since her breakout role in "Almost Fa
mous." However, people should think
twice before dismissing She & Him as just
another snooty indie act. Deschanel and
collaborator/producer M. Ward's sunny
ditties are pure, unabashed pop. The
charming nostalgic romance of their songs
is hard to deny. One look at the energetic
sold-out audience at the Fox Theater in
Oakland on Saturday certainly proved
that.
After a mellow opening act from the
Los Angeles-based duo, The Chapin Sis
ters, She & Him took the stage, launching
into the fun and fizzy "I Was Made for
You." Deschanel, dressed in a gorgeous
glittery halter dress, bounced up and down
like a little kid shaking her tambourine.
The band is clearly a showcase for her con
siderable musical talents Deschanel
sings and writes all her songs. Nonetheless,
M.Ward's role shouldn't be tossed aside so
easily. His wailing guitar added a much
needed kick of rock 'n' roll to Deschanel's
sugary melodies. Always the gentleman,
Ward lingered on the side, out of the spot
light, to allow his female counterpart to
shine.
However, the band is at its best when
She & Him share singing duties. Their
cover of Smokey Robinson's "You Really
Got a Hold on Me," performed by only

Deschanel and Ward on his acoustic gui
tar, was a highlight of the night. The duo
stood on either side of the stage singing
their respective parts to each other. Ward's
warm, buttery rasp anchors Deschanel's
airy voice perfectly.
Ward and Deschanel were visibly excit
ed for who they described as a "very spe
cial guest" and "one of their heroes." They
brought out A1 Anderson, the original
singer and writer of "Ridin' in my Car," a
cover that they recorded on their second
record "Volume Two." The trio traded off
verses Anderson's nasally country
drawl sounded right out of the '7os, when
the song was first released.
Deschanel dedicated the duet "Would
You Like to Take a Walk?" to her parents
who were in the audience that night. Their
quaint rendition of the pop standard, most
famously sung by Louis Armstrong and
Ella Fitzgerald, brimmed with charm, par
ticularly during the back and forth dia
logue between Deschanel and Ward.
It's not clear whether it was De
schanel's microphone or her inability to
enunciate, but it was impossible to under
stand anything she was saying to the audi
ence until halfway through the show when
someone finally yelled, "We can't hear
you! Speak up you're mumbling!"
Once the problem was remedied, it was
nice for the singer to actually build a rap
port with the audience.
Nowadays, most touring musicians plan
for encores by saving their big songs for
last, which forces the crowd to call them

out again after they have allegedly finish
their set. She & Him took a refreshing
break from that mentality by performing
pretty much their entire catalogue, includ
ing their most popular songs. Despite that,
the audience called the duo out for not just
one, but two encores. They charged back
on stage for rollicking covers of "Fools
Rush In" and Chuck Berry's "Roll Over
Beethoven." The latter was Ward's sole
solo of the night, and he tore it up with his
raw vocals and shredding guitar.
For their second encore, they tackled
Screamin' Jay Hawkins' "I Put a Spell on
You." Like most of their best moments, it
was just Deschanel and Ward with his elec
tric guitar. The moody blue lights added to
the seductive atmosphere. Any hesitations
regarding Deschanel's merit as a musician
were dispelled. The singer didn't flub a sin
gle note as she wailed and hit notes be
yond the general range of her songs. On
record, Deschanel's voice is pleasing and
easy to listen to, albeit not the strongest
one. However, there's added warmth to
her live performance. It was almost a
pleasant surprise to discover that De
schanel can, in fact, sing.
Their spectacular set left the crowd
completely satisfied as they exited the the
ater, proving that She & Him is more than
just another celebrity vanity act and right
fully deserving of its rising star.
