### MARGARET RAWSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In its last meeting before the summer recess, the
ASSU Undergraduate Senate confirmed on Tues
day the 2010-2011 ASSU executive cabinet and a
slight modification to the next academic year's ex
ecutive budget.
While the Senate confirmed the members of the
ASSU executive cabinet last week, this week's bill
included the cabinet members' salaries for next
year, in accordance with a disclosure bill passed
earlier this year. Executive Chief of Staff John
Haskell 'l2 will earn $2,500, while each chair will
earn $BOO for the year.
In addition to the chairs confirmed last week,
Sam Purtill 'l3 was added to serve as operations
manager. Purtill will oversee banking, schedule
meetings and plan events for the cabinet and the
ASSU executives, Angelina Cardona 'll and Kelsei
Wharton *l2.
Purtill will also work with Stanford Student En
terprises (SSE) to secure project reimbursements
and with the chair of technology, Taylor Savage 'l3,
on projects such as Live Screen.
"It's important that we can delegate," Wharton
said, describing Purtill's role.
