## Senate approves early funding for one group 
### MARGARET RAWSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In its last meeting before the summer recess, the
ASSU Undergraduate Senate confirmed on Tues
day the 2010-2011 ASSU executive cabinet and a
slight modification to the next academic year's ex
ecutive budget.
While the Senate confirmed the members of the
ASSU executive cabinet last week, this week's bill
included the cabinet members' salaries for next
year, in accordance with a disclosure bill passed
earlier this year. Executive Chief of Staff John
Haskell 'l2 will earn $2,500, while each chair will
earn $BOO for the year.
In addition to the chairs confirmed last week,
Sam Purtill 'l3 was added to serve as operations
manager. Purtill will oversee banking, schedule
meetings and plan events for the cabinet and the
ASSU executives, Angelina Cardona 'll and Kelsei
Wharton *l2.
Purtill will also work with Stanford Student En
terprises (SSE) to secure project reimbursements
and with the chair of technology, Taylor Savage 'l3,
on projects such as Live Screen.
"It's important that we can delegate," Wharton
said, describing Purtill's role.

Appropriations
The Senate passed all funding bills on Tuesday,
approving early discretionary funds for Leland
Quarterly and special fees budget
modifications for the Muslim Stu
dent Awareness Network and the
Stanford Concert Network.

Following the Tuesday evening
meeting, the Senate Appropriations
Committee, chaired by Rafael
Vasquez 'l2, held a town hall in Old
Union for leaders of volunteer stu
dent organizations. The committee
will hold another town hall at the be
ginning of fall quarter.

On the Senate e-mail list, former
senator and Appropriations Chair
Anton Zietsman 'l2 blasted the
committee's efforts insufficient
efforts, Vasquez admitted to pub
licize the period last week when stu
dent groups could seek early discre
tionary funding.

"A lot of financial officers are still
waiting on early discretionary fund
ing," Zietsman wrote. "It's your job
now to explain to them why they
won't be able to receive it and how
that is going to affect their program
ming during NSO and early fall
quarter."

Senate Chair Michael Cruz 'l2
said financial officers had been noti
fied of the funding period in an e
mail.

Another former senator, Mo
hammad Ali 'lO, fired back at Ziets
man, blaming the short funding peri
od on the late transition from the
11th to the 12th Senate last month.

"I warned you guys that this
would happen," Ali wrote.

Other Business
The Senate also modified the
2010-2011 executive budget, moving
$l,OOO budgeted for summer
stipends to general discretionary
funds, as Wharton will only be on
campus for part of the summer.
During the executive update,
Cardona and Wharton mentioned
two upcoming events. "Rejuvena
tion Day," a festival planned by
health and wellness chair Taylor
Winfield 'l3 and set for today, will
offer events such as yoga in White
Plaza, guided meditation in the Well
ness Room in Old Union and a com
edy night with the Stanford Impro
visers at the CoHo.

"Ditch that Dumpster," a collabo
ration of SSE and Students for a Sus
tainable Stanford, will take place on
June 9, 10 and 14. Students will be
able to discard unwanted items at
dorm stations to be sold for reuse in
the fall.

Tuesday's meeting marked the
first since the Senate named its com
mittee members. Over the past
week, each committee met to choose
leadership and discuss goals for the
year.

The communications committee,
chaired by Will Seaton 'l3 (also a
Daily writer), discussed the creation
of a technology subcommittee, an
idea brought forth by Senator Stew
art Macgregor-Dennis 'l3. The pro
posed subcommittee would have a
separate mission from the commit
tee as a whole, focusing purely on the

computer science-related responsi
bilities of the communications com
mittee, such as maintaining the Sen
ate website. The technology subcom
mittee would replace the precedent
of hiring a webmaster to maintain
the site.

The student life, housing and edu
cation committee, chaired by Deepa
Kannappan 'l3, discussed the exis
tence and membership of the sus
tainability subcommittee. When
Kannappan suggested the subcom
mittee be open to all senators, Cruz
suggested the formation of a work

ing group, a less formal body limited
to participation by seven senators to
discuss sustainability-related issues.
The Senate tabled a resolution on
Tuesday to foster a queer studies
program through the feminist stud
ies program. Senators expressed
hope that other measures, such as in
creased student surveys to demon
strate interest, would help the move
ment before they reevaluate the res
olution in the fall.
