the nine deaths that resulted from Monday's at
tack.
Geoff Browning, a minister for United Cam
pus Christian Ministry and a staff member in the
Office of Religious Life, led a prayer before Jenna
Queenan 'll, the incoming president of Students
Confronting Apartheid by Israel, asked for a few
minutes of silence while the crowd lit candles.
Queenan emphasized the importance of put
ting the attack in context, but "not necessarily a
political context."
Adam Hudson 'lO encouraged those present
to pressure the American government to change
its policy toward Israel.
"The very government that runs our country is
the biggest sponsor of Israeli military aggression,"
Hudson said. "We can choose to be apathetic, or
we can take a good look at what our government
does."
Hudson also said the conflict was about more
than religion.
"This is a conflict about humanity," he said.
