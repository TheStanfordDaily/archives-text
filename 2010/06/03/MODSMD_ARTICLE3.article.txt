# Students march, hold vigil after Gaza aid attack
## Tuesday library vigil includes interfaith prayer; Wednesday march draws pro-, anti-Israel groups 
### JOSHUA FALK STAFF WRITER 
Stanford students and community members
held a candlelight vigil on Tuesday night and a
protest on Wednesday afternoon in response to
the Israeli attack on a flotilla of activists carrying
aid to Gaza on Monday.
The vigil, which took place between Meyer
and Green libraries at 9 p.m. on Tuesday, mourned
the nine deaths that resulted from Monday's at
tack.
Geoff Browning, a minister for United Cam
pus Christian Ministry and a staff member in the
Office of Religious Life, led a prayer before Jenna
Queenan 'll, the incoming president of Students
Confronting Apartheid by Israel, asked for a few
minutes of silence while the crowd lit candles.
Queenan emphasized the importance of put
ting the attack in context, but "not necessarily a
political context."
Adam Hudson 'lO encouraged those present
to pressure the American government to change
its policy toward Israel.
"The very government that runs our country is
the biggest sponsor of Israeli military aggression,"
Hudson said. "We can choose to be apathetic, or
we can take a good look at what our government
does."
Hudson also said the conflict was about more
than religion.
"This is a conflict about humanity," he said.

ent at the vigil and noted the diversi
ty of the group.

"The range of people is quite im
pressive," he said. "We all agree that
the loss of life is condemnable,"
Former ASSU Senator Moham
mad Ali 'lO, one of the vigil organiz
ers, said the purpose of the event was
to "commemorate those who gave
their lives while delivering humani
tarian aid."

"This is an issue that really mat
ters to a lot of people, regardless of
your political beliefs," Ali said.

"It's a kind of a shame for human
ity, trying to defend what happened
over there," added Zahit Guner of
Turkey.

Students acknowledged and ap
preciated the increase in awareness.
"This needs to bring light to the
fact that there is a humanitarian cri
sis in Gaza," said Salahodeen Abdul-
Kafi 'l2. "I'm glad that people are fi
nally starting to talk about the block
ade."

Chloe English 'l3, who is in
volved with Invest for Peace, an ini
tiative associated with Stanford Is
rael Alliance, said the responsibility
of Stanford students is to "scrutinize
and question" events such as the
Gaza flotilla attack.

"This was an example of an ap
propriate response," English said of
the vigil. "Ultimately, what most
Jews want in Israel and around
the world is peace."
The somber tone of Tuesday
night's vigil contrasted sharply with

the character of Wednesday after
noon's protest.
"Freedom is never voluntarily
given by the oppressor," declared
Fadi Quran "10, an organizer of re
cent divestment movement Cam
paign Restore Hope, over a mega
phone in White Plaza. "It must be de
manded by the oppressed."
After gathering in White Plaza,
protesters marched by Tresidder
Union, Meyer Library and Coupa
Cafe. Those involved sang "We Shall
Overcome" and chanted, "End the
occupation."
Several students associated with
the Stanford Israel Alliance were
also in White Plaza handing out
fliers.
"The aim of the Gaza flotilla was
not simply to provide humanitarian
relief, it was also to provoke reaction
from Israel," read the fliers.
Jaclyn Tandler 'll, president of
the Stanford Israel Alliance, defend
ed the Israeli blockade of Gaza.
"We believe that it is a just means
to protect Israeli citizens in southern
cities," she said.
Tandler said she hoped that Mon
day's events wouldn't impede future
peace efforts in the Middle East.
After Wednesday's march, Quran
said the purpose of the rally was to
"spread awareness about the issue"
and to "remind people that there is a
blockade going on."
"I think Stanford students really
get stuck in the Stanford bubble,"
said Mai El-Sadany 'll. "It's our role
as Stanford students to get involved
with what's happening around the
world."
