## Grad council talks chat list drama 
### BRIANNA PANG STAFF WRITER 
Graduate Student Council (GSC)
members expressed concern for e-mail
spam on their mailing list at Wednesday
evening's meeting as ASSU executives
Angelina Cardona 'll and Kelsei Whar
ton 'l2 pushed for cohesion between the
Undergraduate Senate, GSC and execu
tive cabinet.
Council members discussed moderat
ing the GSC mailing list after co-chair
Justin Brown, a graduate student in geo
physics, described discussions he saw this
week on the Senate list.
"I get concerned [about] when the un
dergraduate senators get on our list, be
cause we're going to have the same types
of discussions on our listserv that they
have," Brown said.
The conversation on the ASSU Sen
ate list "is literally a conversation be
tween two people about one little thing,"
he added. "One thing that's really impor
tant about our list is that our conversa
tions need to stay focused and not about
things like/I'm so ashamed of the people
last year who did this,' or 'I can't believe
they just said this.' We don't want drama."
However, council members and exec

utives expressed sharp disapproval of the
proposal to create a new list specifically
for the 15-member council.
"It's not an issue of whether we need
a separate e-mail list," said GSC member
Krystal St. Julien, a graduate student in
biochemistry. "That's an issue of the
moderator moderating."
Cardona and Wharton said cohesion
between the legislative bodies and cabi
net was important.
"It's important that there is an outlet
of conversation between the Senate and
the GSC," Cardona said. "I think that we
can say that there will not be the same
bickering on the GSC list as the Senate
list, since the Senate this year only has
one returning member. The discussion
last night was between past senators."
The GSC ultimately decided to mod
erate discussions on the list, as well as to
establish a posting policy to be sent out to
all non-GSC members.

Cabinet members Viviana Arcia 'l3,
Tenzin Seldon 'l2 and Taylor Winfield'l3
attended the meeting to explain their
plans for the upcoming year. After
grilling the new chairs, council members
confirmed that the cabinet members
would be working on graduate issues as
well as undergraduate issues.

GSC members passed the bill to con
firm the 2010-11 cabinet with 13 mem
bers approving and one member abstain
ing.

Additionally, a bill to modify the
ASSU executive budget was passed with
an amendment to transfer $l,OOO out of
the vice president's salary into general
discretionary funds. Wharton plans to
complete an internship in New York for
10 weeks during the summer.
The GSC transportation advocacy
committee announced there would be
changes to the B line Marguerite bus
routes for the upcoming year and that an
increase in parking permit prices may be
on the horizon.

Brown was unanimously elected to
chair the stipends advocacy committee.
With five goals in mind for the year,
Brown plans to make sure graduate stu
dents are adequately funded.
"If you get a stipend, the GSC advo
cates for you," he said.
Additionally, the GSC approved $4OO
from programming discretionary funds
for the Stanford German Student Associ
ation.
