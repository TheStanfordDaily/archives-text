## MatSci Prof. Sinclair to direct BOSP 
### CAROLINE CHEN STAFF WRITER 
Robert Sinclair, a professor in materials science and en
gineering, will become the director of the Bing Overseas
Studies Program (BOSP) this September.
Sinclair, who has taught at Stanford since 1977, is enthu
siastic about taking up the position and considers the over
seas program to be "magnificent for both students and fac
ulty"
Sinclair is particularly invested in making overseas stud
ies more accessible to science and engineering students. He
acknowledged that major requirements make it difficult for
those students to go abroad and said he wants to introduce
more science and technology courses to the humanities
heavy overseas curricula.
"Science and engineering majors are unlikely to change
their major requirements, so we need to find innovative
methods," Sinclair said. "Internet-based classes could be in
corporated this is the 21st century, after all."
Another way to reach out is to increase the number of
science and engineering faculty going abroad, he said. Sin
clair himself has taught in Kyoto and Oxford and wants to
encourage his colleagues to participate. Any Stanford facul
ty member may teach abroad at BOSP centers but, like stu
dents, must apply for the position.
Sinclair is also interested in inviting foreign faculty to
teach classes in Stanford's overseas programs; he noted that
many BOSP centers are located near major academic insti
tutions.
Another of Sinclair's major goals is to encourage Stan
ford students to interact more with their local peers.
"Stanford kids tend to hang out with other Stanford
kids," he said, referring to a phenomenon he observed while
teaching in Kyoto and Oxford.
Sinclair hopes to develop more initiatives within each
overseas program that would encourage students to interact
with their foreign contemporaries, though he also believes
that Stanford students can and should be more proactive
about creating these relationships.
Citing Oxford as an example, he said, "One can invite
students from other colleges to come to us, instead of wait
ing for the busy Oxford students to invite us to events."
Finally, Sinclair wishes to see the overseas program con
tinue to expand and diversify. But with budget cuts already
suspending summer overseas seminars, it is unlikely that
new locations will be opened in the near future. Nonethe
less, Sinclair looks forward to diversifying the program when
it becomes possible.
"I do feel it's important that we plant the seeds for in
creasing the diversity of the overseas studies program into
major globally important countries and cultures in which we
don't have a presence, such as India and the Muslim coun
tries," he said. "Obviously, this would not be at the expense
of any other program."
Sinclair succeeds Norman Naimark '66 M.A. '6B Ph.D.
'72, a history professor, who just completed his five-year
term as BOSP director. Sinclair will continue to teach under
graduate courses, including Introduction to Materials Sci
ence and Japanese Companies and Japanese Society. He will
return to Oxford this fall.
The Bing Overseas Studies Program currently has 11
centers in Australia, Beijing, Berlin, Cape Town, Florence,
Kyoto, Madrid, Moscow, Oxford, Paris and Santiago. The
program sends approximately 50 percent of each graduating
class abroad.
