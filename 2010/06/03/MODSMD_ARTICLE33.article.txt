## Tibet's prime minister-in-exile visits Stanford 
### ZOE LEAVITT SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The "Free Tibet" bumper stickers may have faded
since the 19905, but for Samdhong Rinpoche, Buddhist
scholar and Tibet's prime minister-in-exile, the issue re
mains as clear as ever.

He and Rebiya Kadeer, leader of the Uighur minor
ity movement in China, spoke in Stanford's Cubberley
Auditorium on Friday about the problems their soci
eties face under Chinese sovereignty.
Clayborne Carson, history professor and director of
Stanford's Martin Luther King, Jr., Research and Edu
cation Institute, joined the panel to discuss his own ex
periences in China and the promise that nonviolent
protest holds for the future.
Wearing traditional dress, the prime minister and
Kadeer received standing ovations as they entered the
auditorium. Both in exile, both attempting to gain their
peoples' freedom from Chinese sovereignty, they de
scribed the oppression of two ancient societies.
"The Tibetans remain in exile, and inside Tibet, the
people have undergone a great deal of misery and tor
ture," said the prime minister, 70, in halting English. "We
are not seeking separation. We are not seeking inde
pendence. We are just seeking autonomy within the
PRC [People's Republic of China]."
The current Samdhong Rinpoche a Tibetan title
meaning "precious jewel" was recognized at age 5 as
the reincarnation of the fourth Rinpoche. He became
prime minister of the India-based Tibetan government
in-exile in 2001 after the Dalai Lama decided that Ti
betans should elect their own prime minister.
Beginning his talk with his explanation of the past
1,500 years of Tibetan history, the prime minister said
the Chinese government continues to limit Tibet's na
tive culture and commit human rights violations in the
area.
Kadeer, also a refugee from the Chinese govern
ment, took advantage of the panel to describe the op
pression of the Uighurs, a largely Muslim ethnic group
in northwestern China.
For the past 60 years, Kadeer said, China has im
posed a campaign of forced assimilation and harsh re
pression against the Uighurs.
"Uighurs were repeatedly promised that they would
enjoy self-rule," Kadeer said through a translator.
"However, under 61 years of communist China occupa
tion, the Uighur people never enjoyed any kind of
human rights or democracy. In fact, they have not en
joyed a single moment of peace under Chinese rule."

Furthermore, since September 11, 2001, China has
increased the imprisonment and execution of many
Uighur intellectuals, according to Kadeer.
"Using the label of 'terrorist' since 9/11, the Chinese
government was able to murder hundreds, if not thou
sands, of Uighurs," Kadeer said. "They arrest them, im
prison them and torture them to death, but so far, the
Chinese government has not been able to provide any
evidence of such Uighur terrorism. They only use it as a
lame excuse."
Not all in the audience agreed with the speakers'
take on China. During the question and answer session,
a man who introduced himself as a Chinese doctoral
student in history spoke out against what he saw as the
bias permeating the panel.
"Partial truth is not truth," he said. "Demonizing the
Chinese government won't help the situation."
The prime minister responded: "The violent people,
particularly the PRC authorities who are willfully violating
