### KABIR SAWHNEY DESK EDITOR 
With its final Pac-10 series last weekend,
the Stanford baseball team looked to move
up in the conference standings and make an
emphatic case for a high seeding in the
NCAA Tournament. Though the Cardinal
(31-23, 14-13 Pac-10) was only able to take
one game out of three from No. 3 Arizona
State (47-8, 20-7), it kept all three games
close each was decided by three runs or
less.

After Thursday's 4-2 loss, Stanford came
out on Friday trying to even the series. On the
back of an incredible pitching performance
from sophomore starter Jordan Pries, it was
able to do just that, taking a 5-2 win.
While its offense bounced back nicely
after being shut down by Arizona State pitch
ing, Pries was the true catalyst for Stanford's
victory. He pitched eight shutout innings
against an Arizona State offense that leads
the Pac-10 in almost every offensive catego
ry. He also notched six strikeouts while
throwing 129 pitches, and was only charged
with two runs in the ninth.

With the win, Pries improves his record to
4-3.

On the other side, Stanford's offense pro
vided its pitcher with some decent run sup
port against Sun Devil starter Merrill Kelly.
The Cardinal got 11 hits and five runs off
Kelly, mostly through driving balls into the
gaps in the infield and between the outfield
ers.

Stanford got big offensive performances
from freshman right fielder Tyler Gaffney,
junior catcher Ben Clowe and freshman des
ignated hitter Eric Smith. Gaffney and
Clowe both went 2-4 with two RBIs each,
while Smith went 3-4 and was the catalyst for
a couple of Cardinal rallies, scoring two runs
in the game.

Clowe's performance was especially im
pressive he got the start at catcher be
cause Stanford's regular starter, junior Zach

Jones, was unavailable due to an injury sus
tained in Thursday's game.

Defense also played a big role for both
teams. In Arizona State's case, defensive
lapses didn't help in containing Stanford. A
critical error by shortstop Drew Maggi in the
second inning led directly to two Stanford
runs, allowing the Card to jump out to an
early 2-0 lead.

Meanwhile, the Cardinal defense was stel
lar and played a huge role in shutting down a
speedy Arizona State team that had a ten
dency to steal bases. Pries made a great move
and picked off a batter at second base mid
way through the game, while Clowe threw
out two potential base stealers out of four at
tempts (one of which went uncontested).The
left side of the infield junior shortstop
Jake Schlander and freshman third baseman
Kenny Diekroeger also made a couple of
remarkable plays to make outs or keep Sun
Devil batters from taking extra bases.
In Saturday's rubber game, the pitchers'

duels that characterized the first two games
of the series gave way to more of an offensive
game. This time, Stanford's pitching staff was
unable to hold back Arizona State's offense,
leading to an 8-6 win for the Sun Devils.
For much of the game, the Card looked
like it could come away with the win. Head
ing into the seventh inning, Stanford held a
slim 5-4 lead. However, Stanford's relievers
were unable to hold back the Sun Devils over
the last three innings, as they scored four runs
to notch the win.

Stanford used seven pitchers in the game,
with freshman starter Dean McArdle lasting

five innings after giving up four runs on five
hits. Junior Danny Sandbrink, who came on
in relief of McArdle, gave up two runs (both
unearned) in his 1.2 innings and took the loss,
dropping his record to 2-2.

Arizona State starter Jake Borup did not
fare much better, going only four innings and
giving up five runs before being replaced by
Brady Rodgers. The relief staff was fairly ef
fective for ASU, with three pitchers giving up
just one run over the last five innings.
Defense proved to be a key factor again
for each team. An error by Schlander gave
the Sun Devils two unearned runs and the

late lead, while two errors by Arizona State
second baseman Zack MacPhee led to three
unearned runs in total for Stanford.
With the conference season now com
plete, Stanford finishes its season in fourth
place in the Pac-10, behind Arizona State,
UCLA and Washington State. Overall, eight
teams from the Pac-10 qualified for the
NCAA Tournament.
Next up for the Cardinal is the opening
round of the tournament. It earned the sec-

Junior catcher Ben Clowe had a big impact in a variety of ways for the Stanford baseball team this weekend. In Friday's game, Clowe had two
hits and two RBls, while also stealing a base and throwing out two opposing base stealers. Stanford won the game but lost the series to No. 3
Arizona State. Despite this loss, the Cardinal qualified for the postseason. Stanford received the No. 2 seed to the Fullerton Regional, which
also includes No. 1 seed and host Cal State Fullerton, No.3 seed New Mexico and No. 4 seed Minnesota. Action begins Friday afternoon.

Stanford used seven pitchers in the game,
with freshman starter Dean McArdle lasting

five innings after giving up four runs on five
hits. Junior Danny Sandbrink, who came on
in relief of McArdle, gave up two runs (both
unearned) in his 1.2 innings and took the loss,
dropping his record to 2-2.

Arizona State starter Jake Borup did not
fare much better, going only four innings and
giving up five runs before being replaced by
Brady Rodgers. The relief staff was fairly ef
fective for ASU, with three pitchers giving up
just one run over the last five innings.
Defense proved to be a key factor again
for each team. An error by Schlander gave
the Sun Devils two unearned runs and the

late lead, while two errors by Arizona State
second baseman Zack MacPhee led to three
unearned runs in total for Stanford.
With the conference season now com
plete, Stanford finishes its season in fourth
place in the Pac-10, behind Arizona State,
UCLA and Washington State. Overall, eight
teams from the Pac-10 qualified for the
NCAA Tournament.

Junior catcher Ben Clowe had a big impact in a variety of ways for the Stanford baseball team this weekend. In Friday's game, Clowe had two
hits and two RBls, while also stealing a base and throwing out two opposing base stealers. Stanford won the game but lost the series to No. 3
Arizona State. Despite this loss, the Cardinal qualified for the postseason. Stanford received the No. 2 seed to the Fullerton Regional, which
also includes No. 1 seed and host Cal State Fullerton, No.3 seed New Mexico and No. 4 seed Minnesota. Action begins Friday afternoon.
ond seed in the Fullerton Regional,
hosted by Big West Conference
champion Cal State Fullerton. The
four-team regional is played in a
double-elimination format, with the
winner moving on to the Super Re
gional. New Mexico and Minnesota
round out the rest of the regional's
field.

Stanford's first game pits the Car
dinal against the Lobos. New Mexico
(37-20) placed second in the Moun
tain West Conference and is making
its first appearance in the NCAA
Tournament since 1962. The two

teams did not play each other during
the regular season.
The regional's top seed, Cal State
Fullerton, would pose a formidable
challenge if the two teams end up fac
ing each other. The Titans (41-15)
won the Big West Conference with a
combination of solid offense and de
fense. As a team, Fullerton has hit
.348 for the season with 56 home
runs. It also has two pitchers Noe
Ramirez and Daniel Renken who
each won at least 10 games this sea
son, as well as a team ERA of 3.76.
Stanford will play New Mexico
on Friday in Fullerton, Calif. The
Fullerton Regional will conclude on

With its final Pac-10 series last weekend,
the Stanford baseball team looked to move
up in the conference standings and make an
emphatic case for a high seeding in the
NCAA Tournament. Though the Cardinal
(31-23, 14-13 Pac-10) was only able to take
one game out of three from No. 3 Arizona
State (47-8, 20-7), it kept all three games
close each was decided by three runs or
less.

After Thursday's 4-2 loss, Stanford came
out on Friday trying to even the series. On the
back of an incredible pitching performance
from sophomore starter Jordan Pries, it was
able to do just that, taking a 5-2 win.
While its offense bounced back nicely
after being shut down by Arizona State pitch
ing, Pries was the true catalyst for Stanford's
victory. He pitched eight shutout innings
against an Arizona State offense that leads
the Pac-10 in almost every offensive catego
ry. He also notched six strikeouts while
throwing 129 pitches, and was only charged
with two runs in the ninth.

With the win, Pries improves his record to
4-3.

On the other side, Stanford's offense pro
vided its pitcher with some decent run sup
port against Sun Devil starter Merrill Kelly.
The Cardinal got 11 hits and five runs off
Kelly, mostly through driving balls into the
gaps in the infield and between the outfield
ers.

Stanford got big offensive performances
from freshman right fielder Tyler Gaffney,
junior catcher Ben Clowe and freshman des
ignated hitter Eric Smith. Gaffney and
Clowe both went 2-4 with two RBIs each,
while Smith went 3-4 and was the catalyst for
a couple of Cardinal rallies, scoring two runs
in the game.

Clowe's performance was especially im
pressive he got the start at catcher be
cause Stanford's regular starter, junior Zach

Jones, was unavailable due to an injury sus
tained in Thursday's game.

Defense also played a big role for both
teams. In Arizona State's case, defensive
lapses didn't help in containing Stanford. A
critical error by shortstop Drew Maggi in the
second inning led directly to two Stanford
runs, allowing the Card to jump out to an
early 2-0 lead.

Meanwhile, the Cardinal defense was stel
lar and played a huge role in shutting down a
speedy Arizona State team that had a ten
dency to steal bases. Pries made a great move
and picked off a batter at second base mid
way through the game, while Clowe threw
out two potential base stealers out of four at
tempts (one of which went uncontested).The
left side of the infield junior shortstop
Jake Schlander and freshman third baseman
Kenny Diekroeger also made a couple of
remarkable plays to make outs or keep Sun
Devil batters from taking extra bases.
In Saturday's rubber game, the pitchers'

duels that characterized the first two games
of the series gave way to more of an offensive
game. This time, Stanford's pitching staff was
unable to hold back Arizona State's offense,
leading to an 8-6 win for the Sun Devils.
For much of the game, the Card looked
like it could come away with the win. Head
ing into the seventh inning, Stanford held a
slim 5-4 lead. However, Stanford's relievers
were unable to hold back the Sun Devils over
the last three innings, as they scored four runs
to notch the win.

Stanford used seven pitchers in the game,
with freshman starter Dean McArdle lasting

five innings after giving up four runs on five
hits. Junior Danny Sandbrink, who came on
in relief of McArdle, gave up two runs (both
unearned) in his 1.2 innings and took the loss,
dropping his record to 2-2.
