# RUN FOR THE TITLE
## 
### ANARGHYA VARDHANA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
As most students on
the Farm lazed away
the long weekend, a
contingent of the Stan
ford track and field
team traveled to
Austin, Texas for pre
liminary rounds of
the NCAA National
Championships. A total
of 48 athletes competed
in each event, in both
the women's and men's
sections, with only 12
moving on to nationals.
At the end of the three
day meet, 10 Stanford
women and seven Stan
ford men earned a trip
to Eugene, Ore. for the
NCAA Champi
onships, which will be

held in the second weekend of June.
In the distances, junior Stephanie Marcy qualified in
the 10,000 meters with a time of 34:36.42. Fifth-year sen
ior Madeleine O'Meara earned her first trip to NCAAs,
running a career-best time of 10:20.30 in the steeplechase.
The final female distance runner to finish in the top 12
was freshman Kathy Kroeger, who placed 11th in the
5,000 meters with a time of 16:39.80.
In the sprints, the women were led by freshman Caris
sa Levingston. On the second day of the meet, she ran a
blistering 11.51 seconds in the 100 meters for the top
NCAA qualifying time. On the final day of the meet, she
was a part of the 4xloo-meter relay team, alongside jun
ior Shataya Hendricks, junior Brittni Dixon-Smith and
senior Griffin Matthew. The team finished sixth in the
event.
In the field events, the women were led by the consis
tently stellar performance of sophomore Katerina Ste
fanidi. After not making the height on her first two jumps,
Stefanidi nailed the third jump to qualify for nationals.
Stefanidi was one of nine vaulters to clear 13-9.25. Also
qualifying in a field event was junior Arantxa King, who
finished eighth in the long jump with a leap of 20-11.75.
Matthew, who also competed in the event, sadly just
missed the mark, finishing in 13th with a leap of 20-4.25.
"I am really excited to have qualified for nationals,"
King said. "It takes a lot of the weight off my back. The
next step is really to work on some technical things and
get ready for next week. I have been jumping consistent
ly far, but in order for me to do well I have to really break
out from that consistency. I know that I am capable of
competing well, so I am excited for the outcome."
The final Stanford female to qualify in a field event
was fifth-year senior Jaynie Goodbody, who placed sixth
with a mark of 196-1. This will be Goodbody's third con
secutive NCAA Outdoor Championship appearance.
In the distances, junior Jake Riley became the first
NCAA qualifier for the Cardinal men, placing third in
the 10,000 meters with a time of 29:38.64. Riley also qual
ified in the 5,000 meters, placing 10th with a time of
14:07.48.

Also qualifying in the 5,000 meters were junior Elliott
Heath, who won his heat with a time of 14:06.27, and
sophomore Chris Derrick, finishing with a time of
14:02.16.

"I think we were pretty satisfied with the results from
regionals," Derrick said. "It would have been nice to get
the 4x400 qualified, but we have a pretty solid group
going. I'd say for me it's just more of a relief to have re
gionals behind me so I can focus all of my attention on
NCAAs."
