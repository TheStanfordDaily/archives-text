# MEN'S GOLF
## Card must move up to advance at NCAAs 
### JACK DUANE JACOB JAFFE 
The Stanford men's golf team
began its quest for a national title
on Tuesday at the NCAA Cham
pionships, held at the Honors
Course in Ooltewah, Tenn. The
Cardinal is seeking its ninth na
tional championship and its first
since 2007.
Stanford was awarded the sec
ond overall seed in the 30-team
field, behind only Oregon. Pac-10
champion Washington is seeded
fourth.

The teams play 54 holes over
three days, with the top eight
teams advancing to a single-elimi
nation match play tournament.
Last year, Stanford finished in
20th after the stroke play, failing
to advance to the match play.
Stanford sent five golfers to
the tournament senior Joseph
Bramlett, juniors Steve Ziegler
and Sihwan Kim, sophomore
David Chung and freshman An
drew Yun.

Bramlett is the only player
who was on Stanford's 2007
championship team.

The Cardinal advanced to the
national championships after win
ning the Central Regional in
South Bend, Ind. at the Warren
Golf Course.

The NCAA Championships
have not been held at the Honors
Course since 1996, when Tiger
Woods claimed the individual title
with a three-under score of 285.
The course is playing as a par
72 at 7,445 yards. For the first two
rounds, Stanford was paired with
Oregon and Oklahoma State.
The Cardinal shot a four-over
292 on Tuesday in the first round
of the tournament, which put
Stanford in a tie for 12th after day
one.
Kim led Stanford with a one
under 71 in the first round on the
strength of three birdies on the
back nine, while Ziegler was close
behind with an even-par 72. Yun,
Bramlett and Chung followed
with a two-over, four-over and six
over.

In the second round, the Cardi
nal improved on its performance,
shooting an even-par 288. After
Stanford finished its second
round, weather forced the re
mainder of the second round to be
delayed for a few hours. After a
brief restart, the nine remaining
teams on the course were forced
to leave again due to more weath
er problems, and they will finish
their second rounds today.
Among teams that finished
their second rounds, Stanford is cur
rently tied for 11th. The Cardinal
also trails Virginia by a stroke, but
the Cavaliers still have a few second
round holes to play.
Kim and Ziegler again led Stan
ford, notching one-under 71s. Yun,
Bramlett and Chung all improved on

their first rounds.
In order to advance to the week
end's match play competition, Stan
ford must finish today's third round
in the top eight. The Cardinal is cur
rently three strokes behind Washing
ton and Clemson for eighth place.
All the teams will be repaired for
the final 18 holes today, and the third
round will begin at 6 a.m. PDT.

team at the NCAA Championships in Ooltewah, Tenn. Ziegler is one-under
through two rounds and will need to play well if Stanford is going to advance.
