# What a week for Stanford tennis
## 
### Daniel Bohm 
Three national champi
onships make this one hell of
a week for Stanford tennis.
It has been a few years
since the usually dominant
Cardinal men's and women's tennis
programs have won national titles, but
it appears as if the Cardinal is back on
top yet again.
The women's team, which came
into the NCAA Tournament as the
No. 8 seed, began the championship
parade on Tuesday with a thrilling 4-3
victory over No. 3 Florida. The only
thing more exciting than freshman
Mallory Burdette's three-set victory
to clinch the championship was her
sister Lindsay Burdette's celebratory
tackle.

Now Lindsay Burdette, a senior,
can add an individual title to the team
championship as she and junior Hilary
Barte, the No. 2 doubles team in the
nation, took down No. 1 Natalie
Pluskota and Caitlin Whoriskey of
Tennessee in three sets on Monday.
Capping it off was sophomore
Bradley Klahn, the No. 13 seed in the
men's draw, charging through the tour
nament and ultimately beating Austen

Childs of Louisville 6-1, 6-2 for the
title.

To say that this was a banner year
for Cardinal tennis would be an un
derstatement. Until Klahn's victory
on Monday, no Cardinal men's singles
player had won the national champi
onship since Alex Kim in 2000. Simi
larly, Stanford women had not won
the doubles crown since 2005 when
Lindsay's older sister, Erin Burdette,
and partner Alice Barnes won the na
tional title over another Stanford pair,
Amber Liu and Anne Yelsey.
It is possible that these national ti
tles could be the end of a down streak
for Cardinal tennis. Had the women
not won the team championship, it
would have marked the first time
since 1993-96 that the Cardinal
women went four years without win
ning a title. Instead, with its first cham
pionship since 2006, the Cardinal can
continue the tradition of every four
year athlete on the women's tennis
team leaving the Farm with at least
one national championship.
Prior to the three-year national
title draught, the Stanford women had
won three straight championships
(2004-06) and five out of six in total
(2001-02,2004-06).
It will be interesting to see where
the Cardinal programs go from here.
On the men's side, Klahn has a de
cision to make. After winning the na
tional championship and reaching the
semifinals in doubles with sophomore
Ryan Thacher, does he want to turn
pro? His stock is highest now, and
Klahn definitely has had professional
aspirations since arriving at Stanford.
Furthermore, in recent history Cardi

nal players have started to fade in the
latter halves of their careers. For ex
ample, Matt Bruch won the Pacific-10
title his freshman and sophomore
years (2005-06), but proceeded to lose
effectiveness his final two years.
On the other hand, Klahn values his
studies a great deal. Add the great re
cruiting class Stanford has coming in
next year and the return of every
starter except Richard Wire, who spent
most of the year playing No. 4 singles
and No. 2 doubles with junior Alex
Clayton, maybe Klahn wants to return
and try and win a team national cham
pionship. Stanford's loss to UCLA in
the round of 16 this year has to have
left Klahn with a bitter taste in his
mouth.
My thoughts (as if they mean
much)? Stay. Win more national
championships and get the degree.
Yes, Stanford is nice in that you can al
ways return to school, but there is
nothing like a college experience as a
20 year old.
For the women, things are really
looking up. Lindsay Burdette is the
team's only senior, so a repeat team
national championship is well within
the realm of possibility. Barte, the
team's No. 1 player and fourth-ranked
player in the nation, was a semifinalist
in the women's singles draw this year,
and could easily compete for that
crown next year again.
It is funny how things work out.
This was supposed to be a down year
for Stanford tennis going into the
postseason. Neither of the teams was
expected to win a championship, and
while both had highly ranked singles
and doubles players, they were by no
means favorites. Now the season is
over and the Cardinal has three titles.
