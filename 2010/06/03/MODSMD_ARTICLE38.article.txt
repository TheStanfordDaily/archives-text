a country where
college sports are
not just big busi
ness but near professional, Stanford
could well claim to be the biggest and
best sports university on the planet.
It may not have the No. 1 football
team, or the archetypal jock school,
but having won at least one NCAA
title for the last 34 seasons, it can def
initely stake a claim to having per
formed at a consistently high level
for longer than all of its current un

dergraduate students have been
alive. Not to mention most of its
graduate students and perhaps even
a handful of its faculty.
In all this time it has been home to
countless Olympians and profes
sional athletes from all of the big
money sports. With all of this in the
back of my mind, I was recently flick
ing through a copy of the Stanford
magazine and came across an article

about Ryan Nelsen 'Ol, who will be
captaining New Zealand to their first
World Cup in 28 years.
With such a storied athletic histo
ry behind it, it seemed natural to as
sume that ex-Stanford players must
have represented their countries on
the biggest stage. Endeavoring to
write this column about these char
acters, I trawled my way through the
Internet and contacted people in the
Athletic Department to pick their
brains. Official Stanford Athletics
