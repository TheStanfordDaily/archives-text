# Stanford should embrace soccer

a country where
college sports are
not just big busi
ness but near professional, Stanford
could well claim to be the biggest and
best sports university on the planet.
It may not have the No. 1 football
team, or the archetypal jock school,
but having won at least one NCAA
title for the last 34 seasons, it can def
initely stake a claim to having per
formed at a consistently high level
for longer than all of its current un

dergraduate students have been
alive. Not to mention most of its
graduate students and perhaps even
a handful of its faculty.
In all this time it has been home to
countless Olympians and profes
sional athletes from all of the big
money sports. With all of this in the
back of my mind, I was recently flick
ing through a copy of the Stanford
magazine and came across an article

about Ryan Nelsen 'Ol, who will be
captaining New Zealand to their first
World Cup in 28 years.
With such a storied athletic histo
ry behind it, it seemed natural to as
sume that ex-Stanford players must
have represented their countries on
the biggest stage. Endeavoring to
write this column about these char
acters, I trawled my way through the
Internet and contacted people in the
Athletic Department to pick their
brains. Official Stanford Athletics
Archivist Jim Rutter was a great help,
but what quickly became apparent,
and was confirmed soon after by
David Kiefer from Media Relations,
was that Nelsen will be the first grad
uate of Stanford's men's soccer pro
gram to play in the World Cup.
Another Stanford graduate, Chad
Marshall 'O3, narrowly missed out in
joining Nelsen at this year's tourna
ment when the U.S. Men's National
Team's head coach cut his pre-tour
nament squad down from 30 to the
official 23.

Other than this, the only real link
Stanford has with the World Cup is
that it hosted six games when the
USA hosted the tournament in 1994.
As Stanford was dropped from the
short-list of possibly venues for the
U.S. World Cup bids for both 2018
and 2022, the tournament won't be
returning to the Farm any time soon.
And so the greatest sports tourna
ment on the planet and arguably the
greatest sports school in the world re
main effectively strangers.
I admit that I probably place a
greater importance on this sport than
it perhaps holds in the USA, but this
is undeniably a big statistic.
Why this is the case comes down
to a core difference between sport in
the USA and elsewhere in the world,
and though the power and wealth of
the big four American sports cannot
be ignored, it is not the principle rea
son for this divide.

Here, only a few professional ath
letes do not go to college; back home
in the U.K. it is unheard of for a seri
ous prospect in a big sport to go on to
higher education. Promising soccer
players are scooped up by the top
clubs when they are barely into their
teens, and the very best may well be
playing in the biggest games and
earning million-dollar salaries before
they are even old enough to attend
university.

As a result, college sports abroad
are distinctly amateur, and, except

perhaps in the core Olympic disci
plines, none of the universities have
the facilities to properly develop
sporting talent.
Even here, of the 23-man USA
squad heading to South Africa, eight
did not attend university, and many of
those that did left early to pursue club
careers. Big European teams have
phenomenal resources, money and
power at their disposal, and, while no
absolute guarantee of future success,
it would be a brave kid who turned
down the chance to develop at one of
their academies.

This is epitomized by the fact that
the entire men's soccer roster at Stan
ford is American. The Cardinal, with
all that it offers, is still not enough of
an attraction for the best young inter
national players.
Nelsen's achievement, though,
proves that Stanford can be a step
ping stone to soccer success. Not only
are the facilities superior to some
smaller nations, but there may be par
ticular positions on the field that
could benefit from a longer develop
ment period.
Strikers are often at their exciting
best when in their late teens or early
20s, but, at the opposite end of the
field, the top goalkeepers are usually
seasoned talent who need not just
years of experience but also the intel
ligence and leadership to command
their defensive lines with authority.
An education from one of the world's
top academic universities offers the
more cerebral players something that
will make up for the delay in starting
a professional career.
Only time will tell whether or not
more Stanford players can make the
leap from college to representing
their country, but for now get ready to
catch a little bit of Cardinal history
this summer. Set your alarm clock for
4:30 a.m. on June 15, and watch Ryan
Nelsen become the first Stanford
player to take the field in a World
Cup game as his New Zealand All
Whites square off against Slovakia.

Next issue, Tom Taylor will go trawling
for another Stanford-World Cup con
nection. E-mail him ideas at tom.tay
