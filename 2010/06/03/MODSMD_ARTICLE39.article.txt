# JUST OFF THE STAND

### TOM TAYLOR STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford women's rowing team narrowly
missed out on repeating its success from last year,
placing fourth behind Virginia, California and
Princeton in the team standings at the NCAA Row
ing Championships on Lake Natoma in Gold River,
Calif, on Sunday.
The morning started overcast, but by the time of

the Division I finals, the clouds had burnt off to
leave bright sunshine. However, a light crosswind
developed into a headwind later on and slowed the
whole field in the final races.
Defending its gold medal from last year in the
Grand Final, the varsity eights could only post a
time of 6:31:30 to come in fourth, one place behind
cross-bay rivals California and six and a half sec
onds slower than winners Yale. Stanford's team,
which included seven members of last year's win

ning team, was no match for the Bulldogs, who
wrapped up their third win in four years, the only
loss being to the Cardinal last year.
In its own Grand Final earlier in the day, Stan
ford's second varsity eights had bettered the first
team's mark with a 6:30:45, but could not outpace
the team from Brown, which steadily built its lead
from start to finish, and the Cardinal came in sec-

The Stanford women's rowing team finished just outside the medals, placing fourth at the NCAA Rowing Championships on Lake Natoma in Gold River, Calif.
The varsity eights placed fourth, while the second varsity eights placed second. Virginia won the title, followed by Cal in second and Princeton in third.
ond, this time one place ahead of the
Bears.

Though the second team was just
faster than the first, the two times
posted by the Stanford eights were
so close that, even had they switched
places, the race results would have
been identical.

The Cardinal fours, having nar
rowly been beaten to a Grand Final
place by Brown on Saturday, only
contested the Petite Final and,
though leading with 1500 meters to
go, came in second with a time of
7:22.99 behind Princeton to take sev

enth place in the standings.
A haul of 75 points from these
races was not enough to regain the
title, and the only two universities to
have teams in all three Division I
Grand Finals took the top two spots,
with Virginia winning the title over
California. It was the Cavaliers' first
ever NCAA title in women's row
ing-

While the Cardinal's second
varsity eights went one better than
last year to win NCAA silver, the
first varsity eights, and the team in
general, may be disappointed to
have slipped out of the medal posi
tions this year and be hoping for
the chance to make amends that
only a new season will bring.

Out of the 23 Cardinal women
competing on Sunday, there were

just three seniors, and, from the full
team of 38, just four will be gradu
ating this year: Adrienne Fritsch,
Cassie Kull, Alex Hasbach and
Joanna Tu. In comparison, there are
currently 15 freshmen on the
squad, and seven took part yester
day. Except for sophomore Carly
Villareal everyone in the fours was
in her first season at the Farm.

Though head coach Yasmin Fa
rooq may be sad to lose her seniors,
with so many young members of her
squad already gaining experience of
top-level competition and with an al
most identical lineup due back in the
fall, the future should be bright for
Stanford women's rowing.
