The Stanford women's rowing team narrowly
missed out on repeating its success from last year,
placing fourth behind Virginia, California and
Princeton in the team standings at the NCAA Row
ing Championships on Lake Natoma in Gold River,
Calif, on Sunday.
The morning started overcast, but by the time of

the Division I finals, the clouds had burnt off to
leave bright sunshine. However, a light crosswind
developed into a headwind later on and slowed the
whole field in the final races.
Defending its gold medal from last year in the
Grand Final, the varsity eights could only post a
time of 6:31:30 to come in fourth, one place behind
cross-bay rivals California and six and a half sec

which included seven members of last year's win

ning team, was no match for the Bulldogs, who
wrapped up their third win in four years, the only
loss being to the Cardinal last year.
In its own Grand Final earlier in the day, Stan
ford's second varsity eights had bettered the first
team's mark with a 6:30:45, but could not outpace
the team from Brown, which steadily built its lead
from start to finish, and the Cardinal came in sec-
