## Japanese PM, a Stanford alum, steps down 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF 
Stanford alumnus and Prime
Minister of Japan Yukio Hatoyama
M.5.'72 Ph. D.'76 said Wednesday he
was resigning over his broken cam
paign promise to move an American
Marine base off the southern Japan
ese island of Okinawa.

The 63-year-old prime minister
faced growing pressure from within
his own party, the Democratic

Party of Japan (DJP), to resign
ahead of July's upper house elec
tions. His approval ratings had
plummeted over his handling of the
relocation of the Marine Air Sta
tion Futenma, which led him to be
seen as an indecisive leader.
Hatoyama is the fourth Japanese
prime minister to resign in four
years. His government came to
power amid high hopes in Septem
ber 2009 after his party ended
decades of rule by the Liberal De
mocrat Party (LDP).
Hatoyama met and married his
wife, Miyuki, during his doctoral
studies in operations research at
Stanford. They married at Memorial
Chapel.
