## LSJUMB rally? Quiet â€“ this is a library Band obliges University, says pre-finals library run is off 
### ELIZABETH TITUS MANAGING EDITOR 
Libraries 1, band 0.
That's the score today after the Stanford band
agreed to back down from a traditional run
through the libraries the night before spring fi
nals begin tonight.
"The band has a dishonorable history of mis
behaving in the libraries," said library communi

cations director Andrew Herkovic, speaking on
behalf of University librarian Michael Keller on
Wednesday. "The University library wants no
part of it."

According to LSJUMB spokesman Jeremy
Cohn 'lO, band staff met with Keller last Monday
to ask for permission to rock in Green, Meyer
and the 24-hour Meyer study room tonight.
"He said he didn't think it was appropriate,"
Cohn said. "We'll respect their wishes at this
point."

Herkovic made the terms of the ban more
clear: "The University librarian has forbidden
the band from gathering as a group within the li
brary."

The purpose of the traditional romp, which in
cluded stops at the Tresidder Lair and Old
Union, is "to lighten the mood" ahead of finals,
said Cohn, speaking from the Band Shak, where
a sign taped to a computer read, "We have librar
ians?"

Planning to play two songs at each stop, he
said, the band hoped to remind students: "You're
still at Stanford. Things are still awesome."
The so-called "library rally" has taken place
since at least 2007, when Cohn was a freshman.
But it wasn't all good, Herkovic said.
