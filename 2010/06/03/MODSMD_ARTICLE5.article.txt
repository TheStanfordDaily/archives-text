## LSJUMB rally? Quiet â€“ this is a library Band obliges University, says pre-finals library run is off 
### ELIZABETH TITUS MANAGING EDITOR 
Libraries 1, band 0.
That's the score today after the Stanford band
agreed to back down from a traditional run
through the libraries the night before spring fi
nals begin tonight.
"The band has a dishonorable history of mis
behaving in the libraries," said library communi

cations director Andrew Herkovic, speaking on
behalf of University librarian Michael Keller on
Wednesday. "The University library wants no
part of it."

According to LSJUMB spokesman Jeremy
Cohn 'lO, band staff met with Keller last Monday
to ask for permission to rock in Green, Meyer
and the 24-hour Meyer study room tonight.
"He said he didn't think it was appropriate,"
Cohn said. "We'll respect their wishes at this
point."

Herkovic made the terms of the ban more
clear: "The University librarian has forbidden
the band from gathering as a group within the li
brary."

The purpose of the traditional romp, which in
cluded stops at the Tresidder Lair and Old
Union, is "to lighten the mood" ahead of finals,
said Cohn, speaking from the Band Shak, where
a sign taped to a computer read, "We have librar
ians?"

Planning to play two songs at each stop, he
said, the band hoped to remind students: "You're
still at Stanford. Things are still awesome."
The so-called "library rally" has taken place
since at least 2007, when Cohn was a freshman.
But it wasn't all good, Herkovic said.
The so-called "library rally" has

But it wasn't all good, Herkovic
said.

"There have been incidences of
vandalism associated with band vis
its, and we resent that," Herkovic
said, declining to specify what sort
of damage the band may have
caused. Cohn said he didn't know of
any.

Herkovic said individual stu

dents who are band members are
still welcome in the libraries, which
are "supposed to be the place where
you have the privilege of privacy
and quiet."

But as a group, Herkovic said,
"they are expressly instructed not
to congregate, not to aggregate and
they will be asked to leave if they
do."

"We will treat this as a significant
misbehavior," he continued. "It
ain't right, and they shouldn't do it."
He said library staffers are under
standing orders to call the police if
there is a disturbance in a library
they can't control.

Deputy A1 James of the Stanford
Department of Public Safety said

arrests or citations would be unlike
ly if the band were involved in such
a scenario. While trespassing and
disturbing the peace are both mis
demeanors, "in reality, I've never
seen anything like that happen with
the band," said James, who has been
on the job at Stanford for 18 years.
"If we get a call, we'll send police
officers out there, they'll talk to the
people," he said. "The band, they're
rowdy ... but they're not stupid."
Cohn said all festivities planned
for today are off, and that the staff
would seek permission to rally in
the library next year.
