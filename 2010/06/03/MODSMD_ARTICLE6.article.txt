## INDIVIDUAL CHAMPIONS KLAHN CRUISES TO SINGLES TITLE 
### MICHAEL LAZARUS STAFF WRITER 
Bradley Klahn must have looked a little strange
walking through security at the Atlanta Interna
tional Airport on Monday afternoon.
Earlier that day, Klahn had won the NCAA sin
gles title in Athens, Ga. Not wanting to check his
hard-earned trophy in his suitcase, the sophomore
made the only logical choice.
"I took out my schoolbooks and put the trophy
in my backpack," Klahn said.
Apparently studying for finals can wait a day for
the man who became Stanford's first NCAA singles
champion since 2000.
In the championship match, Klahn defeated
Louisville's Austen Childs 6-1, 6-2 his fourth
straight-sets victory in the tournament. The match
was never particularly close.
"When I went up two breaks at 4-1, then held
serve to go 5-1,1 thought I had it in the bag," Klahn
said. "It was nice to close it out 5-2."
When Klahn finally won on his fourth match
point, the Poway, Calif., native dropped to his
knees, screamed and raised his clenched fists to
ward the skies. Klahn was soon greeted by head
coach John Whitlinger, assistant coach Brandon
Coupe, doubles partner Ryan Thacher and lastly,
his mom.
