## ALL ABOUT ADDERALL 
### ELLEN HUET DESK EDITOR 
Some consider it the academic
equivalent of performance-en
hancing sports steroids; to others,
it's just a mental booster on par
with a large jolt of caffeine. Adder
all, legally prescribed for patients with at
tention deficit disorders, is more common
ly found on college campuses not with pre
scription holders, but with an increasing
number of healthy students who use the
medicine as a "study drug" to boost focus
and energy while studying.
Many students are fully aware that
using another person's prescription is a
crime, but apart from that, abusing cogni
tive stimulants like Adderall and Ritalin
carries little negative stigma because of
their FDA approval and their widespread
presence on campus. These qualities, in
turn, make obtaining the drugs a simple
task and make enforcing their abuse ex
tremely difficult.
At Stanford, rising rates of Adderall
abuse are beginning to raise troubling
questions: what makes a student likely to
use study drugs, and could it be considered
cheating when used as an academic en
hancer?

A Growing Concern
Surveys on study drugs in college have
failed to come to a consensus about an av
erage rate of use, with results running the
gamut from two percent to 34 percent of
students having ever used cognitive stimu
lants without a prescription. While incon
clusive, the results have certainly been con
sidered at Stanford.

A University of Kentucky study of 1600
students found that more than A-students

aiming for A-plusses, most of the users
were C-students avoiding Ds, said law Prof.
Hank Greely. To him, that means that an
academically driven school like Stanford
might be less likely to have as many users.
"To get here, you have to be smart, but
you also have to have your act together,"
Greely said. "It's not to say there isn't any
one here like that, but it's a consideration."
"We don't necessarily have a very good
handle on use at Stanford," said Ralph
Castro, director of the Substance Abuse
Prevention program at Vaden Health Cen
ter.

In 2008, Vaden's general health survey
included a question on study drugs: "Have
you ever used a stimulant medication to
enhance academic performance?" Ac
cording to Castro, only about two or three
percent of responses said yes, but he said
the return was lower than the accurate
count.

"Some students also use drugs like
Adderall just to get high, so they may not
have answered," he said. "I think the num
ber we got was a little small, but I also don't
think it's as rampant as some people fear.
It's not 20 percent, like some surveys are
reporting."
Greely, who specializes in the ethics of
enhancements, has attracted widespread
attention for his published journal articles
and other interviews in which he defends
prescribed use of cognitive enhancers
against negative social stigma.
"There's nothing inherently wrong with
cognitive enhancement through drugs or
other methods," he said. "I'm a teacher; my
job is cognitive enhancement. Caffeine is a
cognitive enhancement. I don't think
there's anything special about enhancing
with drugs that makes it morally differ
ent."

Greely does concede, however, that the
same flexibility cannot apply to illegal use
of Adderall by students without prescrip
tions. But, he said, despite the illegal nature
of Adderall abuse, rates have been growing
quickly because of high availability on
American campuses where, he says,
prescriptions of Adderall are eight or nine
times as common as prescriptions of Rital
in, and much more widely available than
other, perhaps safer, mental stimulants.
He pointed out that in the University of
Kentucky study, use was incredibly wide
spread: four percent had a prescription,
and 34 percent had used it. In juniors and
seniors, the use rate was over half; in frater
nity and sorority members, over 70 percent
of surveyed students said they'd ever used
Adderall.

"I don't think anyone is going out and
meeting dealers in dark corners," Greely
said. "It's being used because there are so
many pills on campus legally."

Student Perspectives
(All student names have been changed
to grant anonymity for a legally sensitive
subject.)
"It is about the pressure," said Jason, a
junior Earth Systems major, who uses
Adderall on a regular basis. "It's about
catching up with other students. I don't feel
like I can study as much as other Stanford
students do."
Jason said he uses about three or four
times a quarter usually to finish school
work in one block and to prepare for
midterms and finals.
"I'm sure to leave two weeks between
each time I use it because I know it can be
addictive," he said. "I know I'm walking a
thin line because I see the very real possi
bility that I can only do work while using

it."
Jason, who has been using
Adderall without a prescription
since junior year of high
school, used to find it at high
school for five dollars a pill.

Now, he says, his younger sister
has a prescription, and he takes

part of her dosage.
"When I'm planning to take
Adderall, I schedule it," he said.
"I'll wait for a Sunday when I'm

free from obligations, and set aside
12 hours and take 30 milligrams."

When he's taking it, he said, he makes
"tons of lists" and spends the first couple
hours orienting himself, then focuses for
hours on a specific project or task, al
though he can sometimes "get side
tracked."

"Mostly, it makes you love the work
the feeling of accomplishment is incredi
ble," he said, and he considers it an impor
tant part of his study schedule. "I don't
think I'd be where I am without it," he
added.

For Jessica, a sophomore English major,
Adderall was something she and her
friends experimented with in high school,
"mostly for the fun of doing something
against the rules, rather than for studying.
But [at Stanford], I know a bunch of peo
ple who take it mostly to stay up all night."
Since coming to Stanford, Jessica has
only used Adderall once, during last quar
ter's finals, but the experience was "not a
positive thing."
"I had already been up for a long time,
and I took one in the morning to stay
awake," she said. "I stayed up, but I was al
ready stressed and it backfired."
For her, the physical side effects out
weighed any kind of academic help the

drug gave her.
"I was expecting brilliance, and instead,
I wrote the worst paper I've written in a
long time," she said. "I got work done, sure,
but it was at the expense of feeling good."
While many of the students who use
Adderall do so to increase focus and atten
tion for academic purposes, the drug's
chemical similarities to speed and other
amphetamines have also led to some stu
dents using it for recreational use.
"A friend of mine from [Arizona State
University] brought some to a party on
campus, and we crushed it and snorted
some," said Peter, a senior English major.
"It was an immediate high like I could
do anything or go on a crazy adventure."


BECCA DEL MONTE/The Stanford Daily
For Peter, who has only used
Adderall for recreational purposes,
the stigma against using it for aca
demic purposes is low and he
claims use is "pretty common."
"Of the fifty or so guys in my [fra
ternity] house, I'd say the number of
users is under 10," he said. "It's a pret
ty common college thing, especially
at somewhere like Stanford where
we have a lot of work to do and the
â– mentality is pretty easygoing about
doing drugs in general."
Health Considerations
"Study drugs are very powerful
stimulants, Adderall especially," Cas
tro said. "It's an amphetamine mix,
which works similarly to cocaine and
affects the midbrain like other
methamphetamines. It has the poten
tial to be highly addictive over a peri
od of time."
Although Greely said users
should consider the risks involved
with Adderall, he didn't consider the
overall problems to be a complete
deterrent.
"One of the problems is, we have
very little research about either the
effectiveness or the safety of Adderall
in a healthy population," Greely said.
"But it doesn't appear to be enor
mously risky, and it doesn't appear to
be enormously helpful, either. It's sort
of like mega-caffeine, as far as I can

tell, not having used it myself."
Jason noted feeling significant
side effects while on Adderall, such
as cold extremities, loss of appetite
and a skewed sense of time. He was
aware of the risk of physical addic
tion and tried to space out use to
avoid dependence, but he noted that
he "could see becoming psychologi
cally dependent" a worry that
Castro also echoed.

"Once you get used to [study
drugs] aiding you in school, you're
more likely to want to use it again, re
gardless of physical dependence,"
Castro said.

Is It Cheating?
Aside from the illegal nature of
using another's prescription, academ
ic use of Adderall on school assign
ments begs the question of academic
violation within University rules. Al
though Stanford has no specific rules
regarding cognitive enhancement
drugs, Castro believes that the future
of study drug abuse enforcement may
lie with Judicial Affairs on campus.
"The way I've been framing this is:
is it ethical for someone to take a
stimulant that gives them an edge
over others doing the same assign
ment?" he said.

"I think, yes, Judicial Affairs would
look at this as cheating, just as in
sports," Castro added, saying that it
might be even more probable in disci
plines that emphasize quantity-based
work.

Greely, however, disagrees, say
ing that without a specific rule re
garding study drug use, the Universi

ty cannot try to enforce abuse as an
academic violation.

"It's only cheating if it's against
the rules," he said. "I wouldn't read
the Fundamental Standard to make
it clear that [using Adderall] is cheat
ing any more than drinking a double
espresso is cheating."
He added that if the University
wanted to consider study drug use as
cheating, they first need a clear and
effective rule, which would be chal
lenging to devise due to the difficul
ty of enforcement.
"What are you going to do
make everyone pee in a cup before
every organic chemistry test?" he
said. "How do you tell if someone's
roommate gave them Adderall when
they were studying?"
For students, even those who find
the drug to be extremely helpful in
academics, few considered the idea
that study drugs could be considered
cheating.
"Taking Adderall lets me put in
the work that I would do anyway, just
in a shorter amount of time," Jason
said. "It's not making me smarter."
While the potential future for the
drug in academic violations, as well
as its effects and repercussions, re
main uncertain, students are clear
headed about how they perceive
their own use.

"You're not suddenly Superman
when you're using Adderall," Jessica
said. "You can just stare at a comput
er screen longer."

tion and tried to space out use to
avoid dependence, but he noted that
he "could see becoming psychologi
cally dependent" a worry that
Castro also echoed.

"Once you get used to [study
drugs] aiding you in school, you're
more likely to want to use it again, re
gardless of physical dependence,"
Castro said.

Is It Cheating?
Aside from the illegal nature of
using another's prescription, academ
ic use of Adderall on school assign
ments begs the question of academic
violation within University rules. Al
though Stanford has no specific rules
regarding cognitive enhancement
drugs, Castro believes that the future
of study drug abuse enforcement may
lie with Judicial Affairs on campus.
"The way I've been framing this is:
is it ethical for someone to take a
stimulant that gives them an edge
over others doing the same assign
ment?" he said.

"I think, yes, Judicial Affairs would
look at this as cheating, just as in
sports," Castro added, saying that it
might be even more probable in disci
plines that emphasize quantity-based
work.

Greely, however, disagrees, say
ing that without a specific rule re
garding study drug use, the Universi

ty cannot try to enforce abuse as an
academic violation.

"It's only cheating if it's against
the rules," he said. "I wouldn't read
the Fundamental Standard to make
it clear that [using Adderall] is cheat
ing any more than drinking a double
espresso is cheating."
He added that if the University
wanted to consider study drug use as
cheating, they first need a clear and
effective rule, which would be chal
lenging to devise due to the difficul
ty of enforcement.
"What are you going to do
make everyone pee in a cup before
every organic chemistry test?" he
said. "How do you tell if someone's
roommate gave them Adderall when
they were studying?"
For students, even those who find
the drug to be extremely helpful in
academics, few considered the idea
that study drugs could be considered
cheating.
"Taking Adderall lets me put in
the work that I would do anyway, just
in a shorter amount of time," Jason
said. "It's not making me smarter."
While the potential future for the
drug in academic violations, as well
as its effects and repercussions, re
main uncertain, students are clear
headed about how they perceive
their own use.

"You're not suddenly Superman
when you're using Adderall," Jessica
said. "You can just stare at a comput
er screen longer."

Some consider it the academic
equivalent of performance-en
hancing sports steroids; to others,
it's just a mental booster on par
with a large jolt of caffeine. Adder
all, legally prescribed for patients with at
tention deficit disorders, is more common
ly found on college campuses not with pre
scription holders, but with an increasing
number of healthy students who use the
medicine as a "study drug" to boost focus
and energy while studying.
Many students are fully aware that
using another person's prescription is a
crime, but apart from that, abusing cogni
tive stimulants like Adderall and Ritalin
carries little negative stigma because of
their FDA approval and their widespread
presence on campus. These qualities, in
turn, make obtaining the drugs a simple
task and make enforcing their abuse ex
tremely difficult.
At Stanford, rising rates of Adderall
abuse are beginning to raise troubling
questions: what makes a student likely to
use study drugs, and could it be considered
cheating when used as an academic en
hancer?

A Growing Concern
Surveys on study drugs in college have
failed to come to a consensus about an av
erage rate of use, with results running the
gamut from two percent to 34 percent of
students having ever used cognitive stimu
lants without a prescription. While incon
clusive, the results have certainly been con
sidered at Stanford.

A University of Kentucky study of 1600
students found that more than A-students

aiming for A-plusses, most of the users
were C-students avoiding Ds, said law Prof.
Hank Greely. To him, that means that an
academically driven school like Stanford
might be less likely to have as many users.
"To get here, you have to be smart, but
you also have to have your act together,"
Greely said. "It's not to say there isn't any
one here like that, but it's a consideration."
"We don't necessarily have a very good
handle on use at Stanford," said Ralph
Castro, director of the Substance Abuse
Prevention program at Vaden Health Cen
ter.

In 2008, Vaden's general health survey
included a question on study drugs: "Have
you ever used a stimulant medication to
enhance academic performance?" Ac
cording to Castro, only about two or three
percent of responses said yes, but he said
the return was lower than the accurate
count.

"Some students also use drugs like
Adderall just to get high, so they may not
have answered," he said. "I think the num
ber we got was a little small, but I also don't
think it's as rampant as some people fear.
It's not 20 percent, like some surveys are
reporting."
Greely, who specializes in the ethics of
enhancements, has attracted widespread
attention for his published journal articles
and other interviews in which he defends
prescribed use of cognitive enhancers
against negative social stigma.
"There's nothing inherently wrong with
cognitive enhancement through drugs or
other methods," he said. "I'm a teacher; my
job is cognitive enhancement. Caffeine is a
cognitive enhancement. I don't think
there's anything special about enhancing
with drugs that makes it morally differ
ent."

Greely does concede, however, that the
same flexibility cannot apply to illegal use
of Adderall by students without prescrip
tions. But, he said, despite the illegal nature
of Adderall abuse, rates have been growing
quickly because of high availability on
American campuses where, he says,
prescriptions of Adderall are eight or nine
times as common as prescriptions of Rital
in, and much more widely available than
other, perhaps safer, mental stimulants.
He pointed out that in the University of
Kentucky study, use was incredibly wide
spread: four percent had a prescription,
and 34 percent had used it. In juniors and
seniors, the use rate was over half; in frater
nity and sorority members, over 70 percent
of surveyed students said they'd ever used
Adderall.

"I don't think anyone is going out and
meeting dealers in dark corners," Greely
said. "It's being used because there are so
many pills on campus legally."

Student Perspectives
(All student names have been changed
to grant anonymity for a legally sensitive
subject.)
"It is about the pressure," said Jason, a
junior Earth Systems major, who uses
Adderall on a regular basis. "It's about
catching up with other students. I don't feel
like I can study as much as other Stanford
students do."
Jason said he uses about three or four
times a quarter usually to finish school
work in one block and to prepare for
midterms and finals.
"I'm sure to leave two weeks between
each time I use it because I know it can be
addictive," he said. "I know I'm walking a
thin line because I see the very real possi
bility that I can only do work while using

it."
Jason, who has been using
Adderall without a prescription
since junior year of high
school, used to find it at high
school for five dollars a pill.

Now, he says, his younger sister
has a prescription, and he takes

part of her dosage.
"When I'm planning to take
Adderall, I schedule it," he said.
"I'll wait for a Sunday when I'm

free from obligations, and set aside
12 hours and take 30 milligrams."

When he's taking it, he said, he makes
"tons of lists" and spends the first couple
hours orienting himself, then focuses for
hours on a specific project or task, al
though he can sometimes "get side
tracked."

"Mostly, it makes you love the work
the feeling of accomplishment is incredi
ble," he said, and he considers it an impor
tant part of his study schedule. "I don't
think I'd be where I am without it," he
added.

For Jessica, a sophomore English major,
Adderall was something she and her
friends experimented with in high school,
"mostly for the fun of doing something
against the rules, rather than for studying.
But [at Stanford], I know a bunch of peo
ple who take it mostly to stay up all night."
Since coming to Stanford, Jessica has
only used Adderall once, during last quar
ter's finals, but the experience was "not a
positive thing."
"I had already been up for a long time,
and I took one in the morning to stay
awake," she said. "I stayed up, but I was al
ready stressed and it backfired."
For her, the physical side effects out
weighed any kind of academic help the

drug gave her.
"I was expecting brilliance, and instead,
I wrote the worst paper I've written in a
long time," she said. "I got work done, sure,
but it was at the expense of feeling good."
While many of the students who use
Adderall do so to increase focus and atten
tion for academic purposes, the drug's
chemical similarities to speed and other
amphetamines have also led to some stu
dents using it for recreational use.
"A friend of mine from [Arizona State
University] brought some to a party on
campus, and we crushed it and snorted
some," said Peter, a senior English major.
"It was an immediate high like I could
do anything or go on a crazy adventure."


BECCA DEL MONTE/The Stanford Daily
For Peter, who has only used
Adderall for recreational purposes,
the stigma against using it for aca
demic purposes is low and he
claims use is "pretty common."
"Of the fifty or so guys in my [fra
ternity] house, I'd say the number of
users is under 10," he said. "It's a pret
ty common college thing, especially
at somewhere like Stanford where
we have a lot of work to do and the
â– mentality is pretty easygoing about
doing drugs in general."
Health Considerations
"Study drugs are very powerful
stimulants, Adderall especially," Cas
tro said. "It's an amphetamine mix,
which works similarly to cocaine and
affects the midbrain like other
methamphetamines. It has the poten
tial to be highly addictive over a peri
od of time."
Although Greely said users
should consider the risks involved
with Adderall, he didn't consider the
overall problems to be a complete
deterrent.
"One of the problems is, we have
very little research about either the
effectiveness or the safety of Adderall
in a healthy population," Greely said.
"But it doesn't appear to be enor
mously risky, and it doesn't appear to
be enormously helpful, either. It's sort
of like mega-caffeine, as far as I can

tell, not having used it myself."
Jason noted feeling significant
side effects while on Adderall, such
as cold extremities, loss of appetite
and a skewed sense of time. He was
aware of the risk of physical addic
tion and tried to space out use to
avoid dependence, but he noted that
he "could see becoming psychologi
cally dependent" a worry that
Castro also echoed.

"Once you get used to [study

ter's finals, but the experience was "not a
positive thing."
"I had already been up for a long time,
and I took one in the morning to stay
awake," she said. "I stayed up, but I was al
ready stressed and it backfired."
For her, the physical side effects out
weighed any kind of academic help the

drug gave her.
"I was expecting brilliance, and instead,
I wrote the worst paper I've written in a
long time," she said. "I got work done, sure,
but it was at the expense of feeling good."
While many of the students who use
Adderall do so to increase focus and atten
tion for academic purposes, the drug's
chemical similarities to speed and other
amphetamines have also led to some stu
dents using it for recreational use.
"A friend of mine from [Arizona State
University] brought some to a party on
campus, and we crushed it and snorted
some," said Peter, a senior English major.
"It was an immediate high like I could
do anything or go on a crazy adventure."

For Peter, who has only used
Adderall for recreational purposes,
the stigma against using it for aca
demic purposes is low and he
claims use is "pretty common."
"Of the fifty or so guys in my [fra
ternity] house, I'd say the number of
users is under 10," he said. "It's a pret
ty common college thing, especially
at somewhere like Stanford where
we have a lot of work to do and the
â– mentality is pretty easygoing about
doing drugs in general."
Health Considerations
"Study drugs are very powerful
stimulants, Adderall especially," Cas
tro said. "It's an amphetamine mix,
which works similarly to cocaine and
affects the midbrain like other
methamphetamines. It has the poten
tial to be highly addictive over a peri
od of time."
Although Greely said users
should consider the risks involved
with Adderall, he didn't consider the
overall problems to be a complete
deterrent.
"One of the problems is, we have
very little research about either the
effectiveness or the safety of Adderall
in a healthy population," Greely said.
"But it doesn't appear to be enor
mously risky, and it doesn't appear to
be enormously helpful, either. It's sort
of like mega-caffeine, as far as I can

tell, not having used it myself."
Jason noted feeling significant
side effects while on Adderall, such
as cold extremities, loss of appetite
and a skewed sense of time. He was
aware of the risk of physical addic
tion and tried to space out use to
avoid dependence, but he noted that
he "could see becoming psychologi
cally dependent" a worry that
Castro also echoed.

"Once you get used to [study
drugs] aiding you in school, you're
more likely to want to use it again, re
gardless of physical dependence,"
Castro said.

Is It Cheating?
Aside from the illegal nature of
using another's prescription, academ
ic use of Adderall on school assign
ments begs the question of academic
violation within University rules. Al
though Stanford has no specific rules
regarding cognitive enhancement
drugs, Castro believes that the future
of study drug abuse enforcement may
lie with Judicial Affairs on campus.
"The way I've been framing this is:
is it ethical for someone to take a
stimulant that gives them an edge
over others doing the same assign
ment?" he said.

"I think, yes, Judicial Affairs would
look at this as cheating, just as in
sports," Castro added, saying that it
might be even more probable in disci
plines that emphasize quantity-based
work.

Greely, however, disagrees, say
ing that without a specific rule re
garding study drug use, the Universi

ty cannot try to enforce abuse as an
academic violation.

"It's only cheating if it's against
the rules," he said. "I wouldn't read
the Fundamental Standard to make
it clear that [using Adderall] is cheat
ing any more than drinking a double
espresso is cheating."
He added that if the University
wanted to consider study drug use as
cheating, they first need a clear and
effective rule, which would be chal
lenging to devise due to the difficul
ty of enforcement.
"What are you going to do
make everyone pee in a cup before
every organic chemistry test?" he
said. "How do you tell if someone's
roommate gave them Adderall when
they were studying?"
For students, even those who find
the drug to be extremely helpful in
academics, few considered the idea
that study drugs could be considered
cheating.
"Taking Adderall lets me put in
the work that I would do anyway, just
in a shorter amount of time," Jason
said. "It's not making me smarter."
While the potential future for the
drug in academic violations, as well
as its effects and repercussions, re
main uncertain, students are clear
headed about how they perceive
their own use.

"You're not suddenly Superman
when you're using Adderall," Jessica
said. "You can just stare at a comput
er screen longer."
