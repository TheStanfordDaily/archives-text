We are the Nurses
of Lucile Packard Children's Hospital and Stanford Hospital and Clinics
WE NEED YOUR HELP
The hospitals are refusing to negotiate with us.
They want to eliminate medical benefits for nurses who are pregnant, seriously ill
or injured.
They want to demote the most experienced bedside nurses who take care of you.
This is not about nurses wanting more.
It is about protecting what we have earned over many years.
It is about dignity.
Please tell the hospitals to!
* COME BACK TO THE TABLE
* TALK WITH US
* NEGOTIATE IN GOOD FAITH
