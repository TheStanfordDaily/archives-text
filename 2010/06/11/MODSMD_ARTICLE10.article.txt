## Stanford begins major undergraduate curriculum study 
### ERIC MESSINGER SENIOR MANAGING EDITOR 
Originally published on Feb. 5,2010.

A top-level effort by the University to exam
ine and likely reshape the undergraduate
curriculum is officially underway.
The Study of Undergraduate Education at
Stanford University (SUES) will attempt to
achieve two objectives: articulating the goals and
mission of undergraduate education on the Farm,
and translating that philosophy into a set of prac
tical recommendations regarding University
wide educational requirements.
These recommendations, though at least a
year and a half away, could potentially remake
the fundamental experience of Stanford under
graduates for a generation or, alternately, so
lidify its current shape for years to come.
While setting the requirements for earning a
major will remain the responsibility of individual
departments, SUES will be expected to address
the other issues that make up the undergraduate
academic experience, including but not limited to
current requirements for writing, breadth, distri
bution, citizenship and foreign language. SUES
will also assess the role of programs like freshman
and sophomore seminars, Introduction to the
Flumanities and the Program in Writing and
Rhetoric,
Stanford's last similar effort was 1994's Com
mission on Undergraduate Education (CUE),
which at the time "undertook the first compre
hensive study of Stanford's undergraduate pro
gram in 25 years." Driving the new effort of SUES
are Provost John Etchemendy and Vice Provost
for Undergraduate Education John Bravman '79,
M.S. 'Bl, Ph.D. 'B5. The formal charge for SUES,
co-written by the two, argues for the new effort as
a necessity and a responsibility for a different
world and an evolved institution.
"It is approaching 15 years since the current
curriculum was designed," the charge reads.
"During this time, our world, our students and
Stanford University have changed profoundly
so in some instances. It is time to review our cur
riculum, to reaffirm or revise our goals for an un
dergraduate education and to ensure our re
quirements reflect our stated goals."
"Much has changed in the 15 years since the

Commission," the charge continues. "The grow
ing social, political, economic and ecological in
terconnectedness of the world certainly chal
lenges us to look more broadly at what it means
to be an educated citizen."

James Campbell Ph.D. 'B9, a history professor,
and Harry Elam, drama chair and humanities
professor, will co-chair the 15-member SUES
Task Force committee.

Elam, who has been at Stanford since 1990,
has been active in issues affecting undergradu
ates since that time and has served as senior asso
ciate vice provost for undergraduate education.
Campbell studied at Stanford in graduate school
and lectured during the 1988-1989 academic year,
but departed for work at other institutions. He re
turned to the Farm as a tenured professor in 2008,
leaving Brown University, where he chaired the
university's Steering Committee on Slavery &
Justice.

The work of SUES will take at least a year and
a half, according to Etchemendy. Its proposals are
scheduled for presentation in the spring and fall
2011 to the Committee on Undergraduate Stan
dards and Policies and the Faculty Senate.
Speaking before the Senate, both Elam and
Campbell emphasized that they, and other com
mittee members, will enter the process with open
minds.

"The work on SUES is not driven by any pre
scriptive agenda or any answers, but by a series of
critical questions," Elam said.
"I think we don't do this with an agenda, or if
there is one, we haven't been informed of it,"
Campbell said. "We are simply at a moment when
the University has gone through really quite pro
found changes, and the society we live in has gone
through profound changes I think that it is time
to see where we are, see what we require of our stu
dents [and] see whether the requirements as they
currently exist are effective and coherent."
Elam added that he hopes SUES will focus on
building upon existing strengths at Stanford.
"We will also look at our peers and other ex
ternal institutions to see what sort of innovative
and exciting things are happening in terms of un
dergraduate requirements,"Elam said."But most
importantly, and significantly, we want to find
something that is the right fit for Stanford that
works here, and is true to us."
"What we do is a very good thing in terms of

undergraduate education," Elam added. "In fact,
we've been a leader in that area, and it is our hope
to continue that."
The task force committee also includes two
students: chemistry major Nayoung Woo 'l2, and
history and philosophy major Aysha Bagchi 'll,
who is also a Daily columnist. In addition to
Stephanie Kalfayan, vice provost for academic
affairs, the rest of the committee membership is
made up of 10 faculty members.
These 10 represent a range of disciplines in
volved in undergraduate education, including
two professors from the social sciences, three
from the natural sciences and two from engineer
ing. Including Elam and Campbell, five of the 15
participants are humanities scholars one-third
of the total membership.

The complete faculty are: Lanier Anderson,
philosophy; Jonathan Berger, music; Sarah
Billington, civil and environmental engineering;
Timothy Bresnahan, economics; Christopher Ed
wards, mechanical engineering; Susan Mc-
Connell, biology; Kathryn Moler, applied physics;
Rob Reich, political science; Jennifer Summit,
English; and Ravi Vakil, mathematics.
Scott Calvert, Sharon Palmer and LaCona
Woltmon from the office of the Vice Provost of
Undergraduate Education will also serve as
SUES staff. SUES was first announced by Brav
man in the fall in a presentation to the Faculty
Senate.

lenges us to look more broadly at what it means
to be an educated citizen."

James Campbell Ph.D. 'B9, a history professor,
and Harry Elam, drama chair and humanities
professor, will co-chair the 15-member SUES
Task Force committee.

Elam, who has been at Stanford since 1990,
has been active in issues affecting undergradu
ates since that time and has served as senior asso
ciate vice provost for undergraduate education.
Campbell studied at Stanford in graduate school
and lectured during the 1988-1989 academic year,
but departed for work at other institutions. He re
turned to the Farm as a tenured professor in 2008,
leaving Brown University, where he chaired the
university's Steering Committee on Slavery &
Justice.

The work of SUES will take at least a year and
a half, according to Etchemendy. Its proposals are
scheduled for presentation in the spring and fall
2011 to the Committee on Undergraduate Stan
dards and Policies and the Faculty Senate.
Speaking before the Senate, both Elam and
Campbell emphasized that they, and other com
mittee members, will enter the process with open
minds.

"The work on SUES is not driven by any pre
scriptive agenda or any answers, but by a series of
critical questions," Elam said.
"I think we don't do this with an agenda, or if
there is one, we haven't been informed of it,"
Campbell said. "We are simply at a moment when
the University has gone through really quite pro
found changes, and the society we live in has gone
through profound changes I think that it is time
to see where we are, see what we require of our stu
dents [and] see whether the requirements as they
currently exist are effective and coherent."
Elam added that he hopes SUES will focus on
building upon existing strengths at Stanford.
"We will also look at our peers and other ex
ternal institutions to see what sort of innovative
and exciting things are happening in terms of un
dergraduate requirements,"Elam said."But most
importantly, and significantly, we want to find
something that is the right fit for Stanford that
works here, and is true to us."
"What we do is a very good thing in terms of

undergraduate education," Elam added. "In fact,
we've been a leader in that area, and it is our hope
to continue that."
The task force committee also includes two
students: chemistry major Nayoung Woo 'l2, and
history and philosophy major Aysha Bagchi 'll,
who is also a Daily columnist. In addition to
Stephanie Kalfayan, vice provost for academic
affairs, the rest of the committee membership is
made up of 10 faculty members.
These 10 represent a range of disciplines in
volved in undergraduate education, including
two professors from the social sciences, three
from the natural sciences and two from engineer
ing. Including Elam and Campbell, five of the 15
participants are humanities scholars one-third
of the total membership.

The complete faculty are: Lanier Anderson,
philosophy; Jonathan Berger, music; Sarah
Billington, civil and environmental engineering;
Timothy Bresnahan, economics; Christopher Ed
wards, mechanical engineering; Susan Mc-
Connell, biology; Kathryn Moler, applied physics;
Rob Reich, political science; Jennifer Summit,
English; and Ravi Vakil, mathematics.
Scott Calvert, Sharon Palmer and LaCona
Woltmon from the office of the Vice Provost of
Undergraduate Education will also serve as
SUES staff. SUES was first announced by Brav
man in the fall in a presentation to the Faculty
Senate.
