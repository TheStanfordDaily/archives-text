## Bravman explains exit from Stanford

When the announcement came
Monday that Vice Provost for Under
graduate Education John Bravman
'79 M.S. 'Bl Ph.D. 'B5 would leave
Stanford to become the president of
Bucknell University, it was the same
day he brought home his newborn
son, Cole, from the hospital.
For Bravman, a Farm mainstay for
35 years, the chaotic day was only the
most recent convergence of family
life and Stanford. He completed his
undergraduate education at the Uni
versity, stayed on for graduate study
and moved to being a professor in the
last years pursuing his doctorate. Mar
ried to another materials science pro
fessor, Wendy Wright, residing on
campus and spending "99 percent" of
his time here, Bravman said he often
thought he would remain here forev
er.
"I never expected to leave Stan
ford," said Bravman, 52. "I expected
to spend my entire adult life here and
retire."
Speaking to The Daily after the
unexpected announcement, Bravman
laid out the reasons for his departure,
the principal values and lessons he
gained from his time here and his pri
orities for his few months left on cam
pus.
In order to leave for another insti
tution, Bravman said, he had to avoid
direct competition with Stanford by
avoiding the milieu of top-tier re
search universities.
"It had to be something in my
mind that was a special opportunity
but also had to be a different place
from Stanford," Bravman said.
The challenge of finding the Stan
ford spirit he believed in at an institu
tion operating in a different sphere,
Bravman said, narrowed the possibil
ities considerably.
"You put all those things together.

that's actually a small constellation of
opportunities," he said.
Bravman said he initially turned
down the offer from Bucknell, finding
himself content at Stanford. He was
persuaded, however, to attend dinner
in San Francisco for 30 minutes with
the chairman of Bucknell's board.
"The rest, as they say, is history, but
we really hit it off," Bravman said. "I
really found it a very compelling two
hour conversation instead of a 30-
minute conversation, and I immedi
ately resonated with him, and that
opened my eyes and my willingness to
explore a bit more,"
"And I start meeting people, and I
find this is a school in a small town in
rural Pennsylvania, and people were
just tremendous," he continued. "And
the students, the staff, the faculty, they
really believe in the school, the alum
ni, the parents... like Stanford, it's a
beloved institution by its people. And
that spoke volumes to me. It wasn't
just a place to go to school."
What he saw proved too much to
resist: on July 1, Bravman will become
Bucknell's president. He said he ex
pects to move to Pennsylvania with
his family a week beforehand.
Before he departs, most of Brav
man's top priorities will be filling key
administrative posts in the Office of
the Vice Provost for Undergraduate
Education. In addition to the appoint
ment of English professor Nicholas
Jenkins as the new director of the Pro
gram in Writing and Rhetoric (PWR),
Bravman will be finalizing the search
for a new director for the Bing Over
seas Studies Program (BOSP) to suc
ceed history professor Norman
Naimark.
The priority closest to Bravman's
heart, however, may be the Fresh
man-Sophomore College (FroSoCo),
where he has served as its first and
only dean.
"We have to find a great successor
in FroSoCo," Bravman said. "I think
of FroSoCo as very much my pro
gram. I started it, I was the only dean.
And so I want someone, and we will

find someone, who has the same kind
of passion for undergraduate educa
tion, and wants to do some of the
things that I have done and also in
vent his or her own things in the dorm
there."
Bravman added that he felt heart
ened learning that 50 percent of fresh
men in the program will return for
their sophomore year, even after his
departure.
"The announcement came out be
fore they had to sign up to stay I
would have felt bad if it was the other
way," Bravman said. "They had the
option, and they elected to stay. So I
think, and this is very important,
we've tried to create a community
that's above any of the senior staff."
The new director of FroSoCo will
also be a different person than who
ever succeeds him as vice provost,
ending the arrangement that had him
filling both posts since 1999.
Bravman, who has also been vice
provost for eleven years, said he was
proud of what had been accom

plished during his time, citing faculty
student engagement in programs
such as Sophomore College, the arts
intensive and overseas studies.
He added that he is optimistic
about the future of VPUE in upcom
ing years after a difficult time for the
University budget.
"We weathered last year's finan
cial storm," he said. "We got through
that, it was very difficult, but the
whole University took the hard path
and got it done. So we're looking at
modest growth when our peers are
still looking at shrinking budgets."
This commitment to moving for
ward and seeking improvements,
which he called "one of the hallmarks
of Stanford University," was one
Bravman said he recognized in Buck
nell.
"We can pat ourselves on the back
occasionally, but we don't do that very
often," he said. "We're always talking
about, how are we going to be better?
How are we going to do more? We do
it in physics, we do it in football, we do

it everywhere in between. The same
thing is true at Bucknell."
Bravman closed by reasserting the
admiration he had for Stanford, and
the shared values he hoped to find
across the country.
"I'm not leaving Stanford," he
said. "I'm changing careers to a great
new institution but Wendy and I love
Stanford, more than you can possibly
imagine."
"One of the things that attracted
me also about Bucknell they
weren't looking for someone who was
not happy at their institution," he
added. "They love the fact that I love
Stanford. TTiey love that. And of
course they're hoping that I develop
that loyalty to Bucknell. It was very
attractive to me that they weren't
looking for someone who was dissat
isfied. They were looking for someone
who was very hard to move. And that
was me."

gram in Writing and Rhetoric (PWR),
Bravman will be finalizing the search
for a new director for the Bing Over
seas Studies Program (BOSP) to suc
ceed history professor Norman
Naimark.
The priority closest to Bravman's
heart, however, may be the Fresh
man-Sophomore College (FroSoCo),
where he has served as its first and
only dean.
"We have to find a great successor
in FroSoCo," Bravman said. "I think
of FroSoCo as very much my pro
gram. I started it, I was the only dean.
And so I want someone, and we will

find someone, who has the same kind
of passion for undergraduate educa
tion, and wants to do some of the
things that I have done and also in
vent his or her own things in the dorm
there."
Bravman added that he felt heart
ened learning that 50 percent of fresh
men in the program will return for
their sophomore year, even after his
departure.
"The announcement came out be
fore they had to sign up to stay I
would have felt bad if it was the other
way," Bravman said. "They had the
option, and they elected to stay. So I
think, and this is very important,
we've tried to create a community
that's above any of the senior staff."
The new director of FroSoCo will
also be a different person than who
ever succeeds him as vice provost,
ending the arrangement that had him
filling both posts since 1999.
Bravman, who has also been vice
provost for eleven years, said he was
proud of what had been accom

plished during his time, citing faculty
student engagement in programs
such as Sophomore College, the arts
intensive and overseas studies.
He added that he is optimistic
about the future of VPUE in upcom
ing years after a difficult time for the
University budget.
"We weathered last year's finan
cial storm," he said. "We got through
that, it was very difficult, but the
whole University took the hard path
and got it done. So we're looking at
modest growth when our peers are
still looking at shrinking budgets."
This commitment to moving for
ward and seeking improvements,
which he called "one of the hallmarks
of Stanford University," was one
Bravman said he recognized in Buck
nell.
"We can pat ourselves on the back
occasionally, but we don't do that very
often," he said. "We're always talking
about, how are we going to be better?
How are we going to do more? We do
it in physics, we do it in football, we do

it everywhere in between. The same
thing is true at Bucknell."
Bravman closed by reasserting the
admiration he had for Stanford, and
the shared values he hoped to find
across the country.
"I'm not leaving Stanford," he
said. "I'm changing careers to a great
new institution but Wendy and I love
Stanford, more than you can possibly
imagine."
"One of the things that attracted
me also about Bucknell they
weren't looking for someone who was
not happy at their institution," he
added. "They love the fact that I love
Stanford. TTiey love that. And of
course they're hoping that I develop
that loyalty to Bucknell. It was very
attractive to me that they weren't
looking for someone who was dissat
isfied. They were looking for someone
who was very hard to move. And that
was me."

Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education John Bravman, right, a Farm mainstay for 35 years, is set to become president
of Bucknell University in Pennsylvania on July 1. At Stanford, he was a materials science professor and prolific fundraiser.
Originally published on April 15,
2010.

When the announcement came
Monday that Vice Provost for Under
graduate Education John Bravman
'79 M.S. 'Bl Ph.D. 'B5 would leave
Stanford to become the president of
Bucknell University, it was the same
day he brought home his newborn
son, Cole, from the hospital.
For Bravman, a Farm mainstay for
35 years, the chaotic day was only the
most recent convergence of family
life and Stanford. He completed his
undergraduate education at the Uni
versity, stayed on for graduate study
and moved to being a professor in the
last years pursuing his doctorate. Mar
ried to another materials science pro
fessor, Wendy Wright, residing on
campus and spending "99 percent" of
his time here, Bravman said he often
thought he would remain here forev
er.
"I never expected to leave Stan
ford," said Bravman, 52. "I expected
to spend my entire adult life here and
retire."
Speaking to The Daily after the
unexpected announcement, Bravman
laid out the reasons for his departure,
the principal values and lessons he
gained from his time here and his pri
orities for his few months left on cam
pus.
In order to leave for another insti
tution, Bravman said, he had to avoid
direct competition with Stanford by
avoiding the milieu of top-tier re
search universities.
"It had to be something in my
mind that was a special opportunity
but also had to be a different place
from Stanford," Bravman said.
The challenge of finding the Stan
ford spirit he believed in at an institu
tion operating in a different sphere,
Bravman said, narrowed the possibil
ities considerably.
"You put all those things together.

that's actually a small constellation of
opportunities," he said.
Bravman said he initially turned
down the offer from Bucknell, finding
himself content at Stanford. He was
persuaded, however, to attend dinner
in San Francisco for 30 minutes with
the chairman of Bucknell's board.
"The rest, as they say, is history, but
we really hit it off," Bravman said. "I
really found it a very compelling two
hour conversation instead of a 30-
minute conversation, and I immedi
ately resonated with him, and that
opened my eyes and my willingness to
explore a bit more,"
"And I start meeting people, and I
find this is a school in a small town in
rural Pennsylvania, and people were
just tremendous," he continued. "And
the students, the staff, the faculty, they
really believe in the school, the alum
ni, the parents... like Stanford, it's a
beloved institution by its people. And
that spoke volumes to me. It wasn't
just a place to go to school."
What he saw proved too much to
resist: on July 1, Bravman will become
Bucknell's president. He said he ex
pects to move to Pennsylvania with
his family a week beforehand.
Before he departs, most of Brav
man's top priorities will be filling key
administrative posts in the Office of
the Vice Provost for Undergraduate
Education. In addition to the appoint
ment of English professor Nicholas
Jenkins as the new director of the Pro
gram in Writing and Rhetoric (PWR),
Bravman will be finalizing the search
for a new director for the Bing Over
seas Studies Program (BOSP) to suc
ceed history professor Norman
Naimark.
The priority closest to Bravman's
heart, however, may be the Fresh

where he has served as its first and
