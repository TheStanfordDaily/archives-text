## For area homeless residents, students' outreach matters

Apart from periodic rumors of
strangers sleeping in Meyer, the issue
of homelessness largely remains de
tached from Stanford campus.
According to the 2009 Santa Clara
County Homeless Census and Survey,
178 homeless individuals live on the
streets of Palo Alto. The survey, con
ducted by the County as part of their
"10-Year Plan to End Chronic Home
lessness," counted a total of 7,086
homeless persons in Santa Clara
County.
Yet Stanford students, separated
from downtown Palo Alto by the
3,750 foot length of Palm Drive, often
are unaware that such a population
even exists.
"We are not aware of a 'local popu
lation' on the Stanford campus," wrote
Stanford Police Department Public
Information Officer Bill Larson in an
e-mail to The Daily. "However, we do
have contact with individuals who ap
pear or present themselves as home
less or transient from time to time."
Nevertheless, over the last two
decades, several student groups have
quietly reached out to the local home
less population. From food donations
to computer education classes to the
establishment of a permanent shelter,
Stanford groups have focused on pro
viding direct assistance to individuals
and disproving common misconcep
tions.
Palo Alto resident Judy Smith is
appreciative of their efforts. Homeless
for over 20 years, Judy Smith now lives
in an apartment and volunteers in the
kitchen of the local shelter with Stan
ford sophomore Marie Baylon, co
president of the student service group
Night Outreach.
"All you guys that are even con
cerned and wanting to hear our sto
ries, thank you guys so much," she said.
"I don't have to live out there; I don't
have to live like that. I feel so grateful."
'l'm a college graduate'
Palo Alto's homeless population is
one that defies categorization, accord
ing to sociology Prof. Donald Barr. In
2007, he and medicine Prof. Lars Os
terberg performed a survey of 145
homeless individuals residing in Palo
Alto, East Palo Alto and Menlo Park.
Published in the Journal of Health
Care for the Poor and Underserved,
the results showed that the local
homeless population is older and

more educated than national aver
ages.
The study found that 78 percent of
surveyed individuals have completed
high school, compared to the U.S. av
erage of 62 percent. Most strikingly,
half of the survey participants report
ed education experience greater than
high school, almost twice the national
average.
"We're a very highly educated
community," Barr said. "Every com
munity has a homeless population and
every homeless population reflects
the community they come from."
Gary Peters is part of the 15.8 per
cent of Palo Alto's homeless popula
tion that has attained a higher-level
degree. He has moved into the Oppor
tunity Center, a mixed-use facility
close to Stanford campus that Barr
helped found.
Fluent in Spanish and some Kore
an, Peters is well read and aspires to be
an author. He has never had drug or
alcohol problems, and has never been
in jail.
"I'm a college graduate," he said, "I
went on to get teaching credentials
elementary and high school and
then went on to get a masters degree."
Originally from central California,
he taught in South Korea from 1998 to
2003. But when he returned, the jobs
were scarce and he found himself in a
down period.
"When I got back here there was
really not much to do in terms of get
ting a job because all the professor
jobs, high school jobs were really all
taken up," he said. He currently coun
sels others at the Phoenix Self Help
Center in Palo Alto.
Homeless in the Bubble
"I think physical space breeds a
mental gap between us and urban is
sues," said Tommy Tobin 'lO, who
writes for The Daily's entertainment
section. "At comparative institutions
like Harvard or Berkeley, it's right
there you see the homelessness on
the streets. We lag far behind on this
awareness that this is a major issue,"
The Palo Alto homeless, however,
only barely register at Stanford.
"Some of the homeless do come to
campus," Baylon said. "They use the
Marguerite and use some of the serv
ices on campus, but none I know of
stay here."
Libraries Director of Communica
tions and Development, Andrew
Herkovic maintained that while there
have been complaints of homeless and
indigent persons in libraries, the situa
tions only occur "from time to time."

"It is certainly true that from time
to time people that don't fit the Stan
ford student profile show up in either
Green or Meyer, particularly Meyer's
24-hour study room," Herkovic said.
"They are not there to use info re
sources, but are there to either stay
warm or be entertained or whatever
else."
Library access policy allows non
students to utilize facilities in Green
for seven days in a year period. Unlim
ited access is granted to visitors of the
Jonsson Library of Government Doc
uments, Special Collections and Uni
versity Archives, and many of the re
search libraries.
Larson echoed the infrequent na
ture of complaints, and pointed out
that being homeless was not a crime
on campus.
"If we receive a report of an indi
vidual who is described as homeless or
transient, we first ask the reporting
party if the individual is violating a law,
creating a disturbance or nuisance, or
is using University facilities without
authorization," Larson wrote in an e
mail to The Daily.
Stressing Stanford's "open" cam
pus, Larson said no action is taken un
less the individual interferes with Uni
versity business or is in need of med
ical or mental health assistance.
"It is not a law or rule violation to
simply sleep or nap on a bench outside
Meyer Library or sit on the ground
outside the Post Office," he said. For
public safety, however, Larson en
courages people to report any suspi
cious persons or activities to the police
immediately.
Formerly homeless Lorin Krogh,
has lived around Palo Alto for over
ten years, takes advantage of living "a
couple blocks away from Profes
sorville" and takes frequent walks
about campus.
"When I get a little time on my
hands, I take a walk over to Stanford,"
Krogh said. "I really like all the cultur
al activities that go on over here. Un
fortunately, not many people take ad
vantage of them."
Yet some students have different
experiences with the "open" nature of
the University.
"Two years ago there was a man
living in a tree on campus and we
kicked him out," Tobin said. "Police
patrol [the Lair and Meyer] specifical
ly for homeless individuals."

ple on campus last year, as part of a
