## Ravenswood closes Stanford-run charter school; K-4 done this year

Originally published on Apri123,2010.

The Ravenswood City School Dis
trict board voted 3-1 on Thursday to
extend a Stanford-run school's charter
until 2012, when the school's Stanford
backers say they will look elsewhere
for a "charter home" for the high
school.
Operated by Stanford New
Schools in Menlo Park, the high
school will stay open for two more
years and the fifth-grade program
until 2011. The K-4 programs, whose
test scores were largely responsible
for landing the so-called East Palo
Alto Academy on the state's list of
"persistently low-achieving" schools,
will close in June.
Last week, the school board voted
to deny Stanford's school a five-year
charter extension, sending its superin
tendent, Maria de la Vega, to negotiate
a limited two-year extension with
Stanford.
Linda Darling-Hammond, a Stan
ford professor and transition advisor
on education to President Obama,
founded Stanford New Schools, the
umbrella organization for East Palo
Alto Academy.
Last month, the state labeled the
school "persistently low-achieving"
based on test scores. With a Growth
Academic Performance Index score
of 605, below the state's target of 800,
Stanford's school fell among the low
est-performing 20 percent of schools
statewide.
Stanford rushed to defend East
Palo Alto Academy, saying the nine
year-old high school's strong perform
ance was skewed by low scores at the
fledgling elementary school, which
opened in 2006.
Deborah Stipek, the dean of the
School of Education, pointed to the
high school's numbers: 86 percent of
students graduate, above the state's
rate of 80 percent; 96 percent of grad
uates go on to two- or four-year col
leges; the high school gained 180 API
points in the past seven years. And all

this in a set of schools where 80 per
cent of 550 students are non-native
English speakers, in a school district
where two other schools also landed
on the state's list for poor perform
ance.
But the elementary school's scores
were less sterling; its administrators
have appealed its latest API score to
the state, and in 2009, 18 percent of
second-graders and 11 percent of
third-graders scored as proficient in
English. In math, 22 percent of sec
ond-graders and 19 percent of third
graders scored as proficient or ad
vanced.
Now, attorneys for Stanford and
the district must write the proposal
into a revised facilities use agreement
and memorandum of understanding
for approval by the board.
The agreement also requires that
Stanford New Schools leaves its ele
mentary school facilities on Sheridan
Drive in Menlo Park and abandons a
Proposition 39 facilities request there,
instead operating its fifth grade and
high school at the current high school
site on Pope Street.
Stanford and Ravenswood must
also ensure that Ravenswood gets
"appropriate compensation" for use
of those sites.
On Thursday, district counsel Tim
Fox told the board the negotiated
agreement "appears to be the most ele
gant solution" to the disappointment
surrounding the test scores at East Palo
Alto Academy Elementary School.
The elementary school and high school
are touted on Stanford's You Tube page
as "new models for K-12 reform."
Ruben Abrica '7B, a former
Ravenswood board member, told the
board he was concerned with "this
whole high-stakes testing game."
"We live and die by it," Abrica said.
"I think Stanford got a taste of it."
Board President Sharifa Wilson,
Vice President Larry Moody and
Marcelino Lopez voted for the exten
sion. Board member Saree Mading, an
administrator at East Palo Alto Char
ter School, voted against it.
"I had to," Mading said. "Principle,
We're not a K-12 district. I don't believe

a fifth-grade class should be with a high
school."
"Stanford's been embarrassed," she
added. "I get that."
Board member John Bostic was ab
sent from the vote. Moody said voting
for the extension was "in the spirit of
the board," adding that Stanford has
"gone through their learning curve."
Stipek said Stanford would search
for a new "charter home" for the high
school at the end of the two-year exten
sion. There are no plans to seek a new
elementary school charter, she said.
"Right now, our immediate concern
is to support our elementary school
children" who must go to new schools
next year, Stipek said.
Superintendent de la Vega said the
fifth-grade program got an extra year
under the agreement because there is a
natural "break" before those students
enter junior high in sixth grade.
She would not say whether or not
the district would consider a renewal of
Stanford's high school charter two
years from now.
A scene apart from last week's
standing room-only meeting, Thurs
day's session was half-empty by the
time the board took up the Stanford
New Schools issue minutes before 11
p.m.
Rudy Rivera, a Guatemalan immi
grant with two children in Stanford
New Schools, sat at the back of the
room. His daughter, a sophomore at
East Palo Alto Academy High School,
will finish high school there, he said. His
son, a first-grader at the Stanford-run
elementary school, will go next year to
Costano Elementary School, where a
brother also goes.
"I hope Stanford is looking for
something else to continue," Rivera
said. "It's important we have the
school."
He said he preferred it for his chil
dren because of the one-on-one atten
tion they got from teachers.
"My kids' education is a priority,"
Rivera said. "It has to work."

School of Education, pointed to the
high school's numbers: 86 percent of
students graduate, above the state's
rate of 80 percent; 96 percent of grad
uates go on to two- or four-year col
leges; the high school gained 180 API
points in the past seven years. And all

this in a set of schools where 80 per
cent of 550 students are non-native
English speakers, in a school district
where two other schools also landed
on the state's list for poor perform
ance.
But the elementary school's scores
were less sterling; its administrators
have appealed its latest API score to
the state, and in 2009, 18 percent of
second-graders and 11 percent of
third-graders scored as proficient in
English. In math, 22 percent of sec
ond-graders and 19 percent of third
graders scored as proficient or ad
vanced.
Now, attorneys for Stanford and
the district must write the proposal
into a revised facilities use agreement
and memorandum of understanding
for approval by the board.
The agreement also requires that
Stanford New Schools leaves its ele
mentary school facilities on Sheridan
Drive in Menlo Park and abandons a
Proposition 39 facilities request there,
instead operating its fifth grade and
high school at the current high school
site on Pope Street.
Stanford and Ravenswood must
also ensure that Ravenswood gets
"appropriate compensation" for use
of those sites.
On Thursday, district counsel Tim
Fox told the board the negotiated
agreement "appears to be the most ele
gant solution" to the disappointment
surrounding the test scores at East Palo
Alto Academy Elementary School.
The elementary school and high school
are touted on Stanford's You Tube page
as "new models for K-12 reform."
Ruben Abrica '7B, a former
Ravenswood board member, told the
board he was concerned with "this
whole high-stakes testing game."
"We live and die by it," Abrica said.
"I think Stanford got a taste of it."
Board President Sharifa Wilson,
Vice President Larry Moody and
Marcelino Lopez voted for the exten
sion. Board member Saree Mading, an
administrator at East Palo Alto Char
ter School, voted against it.
"I had to," Mading said. "Principle,
We're not a K-12 district. I don't believe

a fifth-grade class should be with a high
school."
"Stanford's been embarrassed," she
added. "I get that."
Board member John Bostic was ab
sent from the vote. Moody said voting
for the extension was "in the spirit of
the board," adding that Stanford has
"gone through their learning curve."
Stipek said Stanford would search
for a new "charter home" for the high
school at the end of the two-year exten
sion. There are no plans to seek a new
elementary school charter, she said.
"Right now, our immediate concern
is to support our elementary school
children" who must go to new schools
next year, Stipek said.
Superintendent de la Vega said the
fifth-grade program got an extra year
under the agreement because there is a
natural "break" before those students
enter junior high in sixth grade.
She would not say whether or not
the district would consider a renewal of
Stanford's high school charter two
years from now.
A scene apart from last week's
standing room-only meeting, Thurs
day's session was half-empty by the
time the board took up the Stanford
New Schools issue minutes before 11
p.m.
Rudy Rivera, a Guatemalan immi
grant with two children in Stanford
New Schools, sat at the back of the
room. His daughter, a sophomore at
East Palo Alto Academy High School,
will finish high school there, he said. His
son, a first-grader at the Stanford-run
elementary school, will go next year to
Costano Elementary School, where a
brother also goes.
"I hope Stanford is looking for
something else to continue," Rivera
said. "It's important we have the
school."
He said he preferred it for his chil
dren because of the one-on-one atten
tion they got from teachers.
"My kids' education is a priority,"
Rivera said. "It has to work."
