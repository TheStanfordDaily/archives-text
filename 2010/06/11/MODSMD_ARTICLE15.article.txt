## MEN'S VOLLEYBALL: CHAMPS

Originally published on May 10,2010.

Players and students rushed the court as
the No. 1 seed Stanford men's volleyball
team swept No. 3 seed Penn State in a near
perfect performance to win its first national
championship since 1997.
The wooden national championship tro
phy sat safely behind the court as the two
teams warmed up, and television cameras
panned over the large and boisterous crowd
in Maples Pavilion.
"We had 6,635 people there today," said
senior opposite Evan Romero after the
match. "That's 6,600 more people than we
had our freshman year. As they've come to
our games, it's just revived us."
The stands erupted in cheers as Penn
State missed the opening serve of the match.
But the Nittany Lions would fight back to
win the next point, a back-and-forth pattern
that recurred for the majority of the first set.
Every hitting option was delivering. Ju
nior outside hitter Spencer McLachlin had
an early kill that deflected off Penn State's
blockers, while Romero killed a ball cross
court. Sophomore outside hitter Brad Law
son came alive at 7-5, killing a ball straight
down the line.
Consecutive missed serves from Stanford
in addition to Penn State kills kept the Nit
tany Lions in the game, with the set tied as
late as 19-19. But four Lawson kills in the final
stretch, combined with two from Romero and
an ace after a timeout, helped the Card pull
away. Romero slammed a ball hard down the
line, tipping off Penn State libera Dennis Del
Valle's hand, to win the set, 30-25.
The second set opened with a McLachlin
roll shot that landed untouched at the 10-
foot line. But the Nittany Lions gained some
momentum after a well-executed dump by
setter Edgardo Goas and multiple Stanford
hitting errors, taking their biggest lead of the
match at 10-5.
However, despite a slow start, Stanford
fought back with a run of its own. Sophomore
middle blocker Gus Ellis used Penn State's
block for a kill, while a Romero hit was sent
flying into the stands by a misplaced Penn
State pass. In back-to-back plays, the Nittany
Lions over-passed balls, only to have
Romero and McLachlin pound them back
for kills.
Sophomore libero Erik Shoji had several
remarkable saves to keep difficult balls in
play. At 13-12, he had a diving dig from mid
dle back that senior setter Kawika Shoji per
fectly set up for a Lawson kill out of the back
row. Later, Kawika Shoji dug a hard-hit ball
that appeared to be going down, leading to a
McLachlin kill.
While Stanford heated up, Penn State un
raveled. A set by Goas fell untouched past a
hitter, and then outside hitter Will Price
mishit a ball into the net. Goas was called for
a double hit to give the Card set point, and a
Lawson serve flew wildly off Penn State out
side hitter Joe Sunder for an ace, clinching
the second set victory, 30-20.
Stanford led from the first point of the
third set unsurprisingly, off another Law
son kill and never looked back. Romero

began to take advantage of the line, while
Lawson continued to dominate. The crowd
began to chant, "You can't stop him!" in ref
erence to Lawson's stellar play.
"You talk about being in the zone," said
head coach John Kosty. "When a player gets
in the zone, you don't talk to him, you don't
slap his hand, you don't do anything, just let
him be. Brad [was in a zone] tonight."
The end of the set was all Stanford. Kawi
ka Shoji sneakily set a ball over for the kill,
and McLachlin put a ball down off a Romero
bump set. Price missed a serve for Penn

State, bringing the score to 28-17, and a Law
son-Ellis roof block gave the Card match
point. Finishing off a heroic evening, Lawson
slammed a ball cross-court to win the set, and
national title, 30-18.
"It's the national championship, there's
nothing really like it," Lawson said. "It was
just great to have a good night tonight."
Lawson had a phenomenal night, tallying
24 kills and only one error an illegal back
row attack that appeared to have gone down
for the kill to hit an impressive .821. His
success extended to the back row as well, as

he had five digs and a team-leading four aces.
"Early in the first [set], to be honest, I was
nervous," Lawson said. "But as I started to go
through, I settled in. Kawika [Shoji] was just
delivering the ball to the spot... and it was
easy from that point."
McLachlin and Romero were also power
ful offensive forces for the Card, with 12 and
11 kills, respectively, to aid Stanford to .495
hitting for the match. Kawika Shoji had 47 as
sists, bringing his season total to 1,455, and
both he and his brother Erik Shoji led the
Cardinal defense with 10 digs apiece.

For the Nittany Lions, Price tallied 15 kills
and two aces. Sunder contributed 12 kills, and
middle blocker Max Lipsitz added another
10. Goas put up 38 assists, and Del Valle led
the match with 12 digs.
Following the match, the Stanford players
received national championship shirts and
hats, and fans swarmed the court. Individual
awards were distributed to the players and
coaches, and the seniors stepped forward to
accept the championship trophy. The team
