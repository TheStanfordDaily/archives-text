# FOOTBALL: THE FALL OF TROY

Sometimes, the sequel is just as good as the
original.
Hardly anyone thought Stanford could top
the performance it gave two years ago when it
shocked Southern California at the Los Ange
les Coliseum as a 41-point underdog, but the
Cardinal just might have done that this Satur
day with a 55-21 shellacking of the Trojans.
USC filled its stadium with more than 90,000
fans, but by the end of the game, there was only
Cardinal —no gold —to be found in the
stands.
"To do that against a storied program, a
perennial power it's the greatest feeling in
the world," said senior running back Toby Ger
hart.
"It was put-up-or-shut-up time for Stanford
football and our guys came out focused and
loose and did what we had to do to win," said
Stanford Head Coach Jim Harbaugh.
The win catapulted Stanford (7-3,6-2 Pacif
ic-10 Conference) in the national rankings, as it
now stands at No. 14 in the Associated Press
poll. USC (7-3,4-3 Pac-10) was predictably de
moted, falling all the way down to No. 22.
Like the win two years ago, Saturday's vic
tory was historic in a number of ways.
The Cardinal scored 55 points, the most a
USC football team has given up ever. It was
the Trojans' worst home loss since 1966, and
also marked USC Head Coach Pete Carroll's
first loss in the month of November in his nine
years at the school (Carroll came into the
game with a November record of 28-0). It was
only the fourth home loss for USC since 2001;
sure enough, three of the four losses have
come at the hands of the Cardinal.

"I'm not sure I have the right words to de
scribe being humbled like that in the Coliseum
after so many years and so many good things
and playing well and all that," Carroll said after
the game. "I don't really know where to put it."
Though Stanford won by 34 which was
an even bigger upset in terms of point spread
than the 2007 win the game wasn't over
until the opening moments of the fourth quar
ter, when senior cornerback Richard Sherman
stepped in front of a Matt Barkley pass and
took it 42 yards to the end zone, untouched.
The pick-six made the score 42-21, breaking
the spirit of the Trojans and their crowd.
Turnovers set the tone from the beginning,
as USC coughed up the ball on its first two
drives of the game; both turnovers led to Stan
ford touchdowns. Stanford senior linebacker
Will Powers forced a Barkley fumble when the
Trojans were already deep into Cardinal terri
tory, allowing Stanford to strike first after it
subsequently drove the ball 71 yards down the
field.
On USC's next drive, Stanford sophomore
defensive tackle Matt Masifilo tipped a
Barkley pass to himself before making a diving
interception. The play was reviewed, but the
ruling on the field stood. Redshirt freshman
quarterback Andrew Luck methodically
drove the Cardinal down the field once again,
and before many of the 90,000 in attendance
even had a chance to take their seats, Stanford
had jumped out to a 14-0 lead it would never
relinquish.
Luck did not have the biggest game of his
career, but it is difficult for a freshman quarter
back playing in a hostile environment like the
Coliseum to put on a better performance. He
threw for 144 yards and two touchdowns on
12-of-22 passing, but didn't turn the ball over

Redshirt freshman Andrew Luck led the Stanford offense in a dominating performance over USC. The quarterback ran for 61 yards in addition
to throwing for 144 yards and two touchdowns. "He played a very heady game," said Coach Jim Harbaugh of Luck's performance.
once and consistently frustrated the
Trojans with his opportunistic run
ning, finishing the game with 61 yards
and numerous successful third-down
conversions.
"He played a very heady game,"
Harbaugh said of his quarterback.
But it was Gerhart who wore away
at the Trojans with 178 yards and
three touchdowns on 29 carries. Ger
hart seemed to gain at least five yards
on every play, keeping the USC of
fense off the field which was crucial
for the Cardinal in maintaining its
lead.
Not to be outdone, Coach Har
baugh made news once again at the
end of the game after going for a two
point conversion with the Cardinal al
ready up 48-21. Freshman Stepfan

Taylor was stopped short of the end
zone, but that didn't stop a reaction
from fans and media alike. Many be
lieve that it was a competitive —if
that is the correct word gesture di
rected at Carroll.
Harbaugh assured reporters that it
was nothing personal, although it is
hard to know how true his statement
was. After all, going for two up 27
doesn't seem to be a standard con
vention in the world of college foot
ball.
"I thought it was an opportunity,
the way we were coming off the ball,
the way our players were playing
that it was the right thing to do," Har
baugh said.
Carroll was obviously not en
thused at the play call, but did not
gripe or take any shots at Harbaugh
when he was asked about it.
"I don't know what they were
thinking with that, but in that situa
tion, they get to do whatever they
want," Carroll said.

NOTES:
Stanford now has an outside
chance of qualifying for the Rose
Bowl, where it would face Big-10
Champion Ohio State. Four things
must happen for this to take place:
this weekend, Stanford has to beat
California and Arizona has to beat
Oregon. On the last weekend of the
season, Oregon State has to beat Ore
gon and USC has to beat Arizona.
Jon Wilner of the San Jose Mer
cury News has reported that Stanford
Athletic Director Bob Bowlsby is
putting the final touches on a contract
extension that would keep Harbaugh
on the Farm through 2014. "I expect
that we'll have an announcement
soon," Bowslby said after Saturday's
win. The contract will reportedly pay
Harbaugh $1.25 million a year, which
would make him the highest-paid
coach in school history.
