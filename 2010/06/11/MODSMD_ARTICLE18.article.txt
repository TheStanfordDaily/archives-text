Bradley Klahn must have looked a little
strange walking through security at the At
lanta International Airport on Monday after
noon.
Earlier that day, Klahn had won the
NCAA singles title in Athens, Ga. Not want
ing to check his hard-earned trophy in his
suitcase, the sophomore made the only logical
choice.

"l took out my schoolbooks and put the
trophy in my backpack," Klahn said.
Apparently studying for finals can wait a
day for the man who became Stanford's first
NCAA singles champion since 2000.
In the championship match, Klahn defeat
ed Louisville's Austen Childs 6-1, 6-2 his
fourth straight-sets victory in the tourna
ment. The match was never particularly close.
"When I went up two breaks at 4-1, then
held serve to go 5-1,1 thought I had it in the
bag," Klahn said. "It was nice to close it out 5-
2."
When Klahn finally won on his fourth

match point, the Poway, Calif., native
dropped to his knees, screamed and raised his
clenched fists toward the skies. Klahn was
soon greeted by head coach John Whitlinger,
assistant coach Brandon Coupe, doubles
partner Ryan Thacher and lastly, his mom.
"To be a national champion, it's a huge
deal," Klahn said. "Just to win an NCAA
championship in anything is a huge honor.
I'm so excited. I don't really know what to
say."
As one of eight No. 9-16 seeds, Klahn had
a tough road to the title match. After breez-

Sophomore Bradley Klahn overcame Iwo close matches in earlier rounds to dominate his opponents, losing only seven games in his final two matches en route to the singles title.

ing past Southern Methodist's
Artem Baradach in straight sets in
the first round, Klahn ran into trou
ble against Tennessee's Boriz Con
kic. Klahn dropped the first set 6-4,
but was able to recover, pulling out
the last two sets 6-3,6-4.
"I had two tough three-setters. I
controlled the tempo this year," he
said in reference to his first-round
lost last year at the NCAAs.
In the round of 16, Klahn found
himself matched against the tourna
ment's No. 4 seed, Guillermo Gomez
from Georiga Tech. In his first upset
of the tournament, Klahn disman
tled Gomez 6-4,6-4.
Klahn had his second three-setter
in the quarterfinals against Missis
sippi's Marcel Thiemann. After
dropping the first set 6-1, Klahn
looked dead in the water nearly
two straight weeks of tennis taking
its toll. Somehow, Klahn fought his
way back in the second set to win the

tiebreaker and held on to win the
third set 6-4 to advance.
In the semifinals, Klahn ran into
Duke's Henrique Cunha the No.
2 player in the nation and the tour
nament's No. 1 overall seed. Playing
what he described as the best tennis
of his life, Klahn rattled out two easy
6-2 victories to advance to the finals
and a date with history.
"It still hasn't fully sunk in yet,"
he said. "It's pretty unbelievable."
In addition to his singles champi
onship, Klahn and Thacher also ad
vanced to the semifinals in the dou
bles tournament. As the No. 4 seed in
the draw, the sophomore duo fell to
eventual champions Drew Courtney
and Michael Shabaz of Virginia.
For now, Klahn plans on taking
some much-deserved rest. After fi
nals are over, he will play in some
professional tournaments, hopefully
including the U.S. Open if he can
earn a wild-card spot.
In the meantime, he might get
around to digging those textbooks
out of his checked baggage.
