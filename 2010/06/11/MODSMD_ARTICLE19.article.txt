Lindsay Burdette can't be stopped this postseason, put
ting up another remarkable run to become NCAA doubles
champion with longtime partner Hilary Barte, and upset the
nation's No. 1 team from Tennessee 7-5,4-6,6-0.
"I have known deep down that Hilary and I were the best
team together," Lindsay Burdette said. "That showed me
that it was the right thing and it just made me work that
much harder so that we can be together."
The No. 2 team in the country all season, Burdette and
Barte have really proved their dominance. With an overall
record of 36-6, the team is Stanford's first NCAA doubles
champions since Alice Barnes and Erin Burdette Lind
say's older sister defeated Amber Liu and Ann Yelsey in
2005 in an all-Stanford final.
Their run to the final was a fairly routine affair. They
recorded four wins before the final match, all in straight sets.
In fact, their most dominant match came in the semifinals
over No. 4 Andrea Remynse and Yasmin Schnack of UCLA,
as they won 6-0,6-1.
The duo also defeated the No. 11 team of Csilla Borsanyi
and Lenka Broosova for the second time this postseason in
the quarterfinals by the score of 6-4,6-4. The last time they
met was when No. 8 Stanford upset No. 1 Baylor on its way
to its 16th NCAA championship. Barte/Burdette defeated
Borsanyi/Broosova in a close 9-8 (3) match that time.
"I don't really know how to put it into words, but I think
a lot of what makes [Lindsay and me] good is what we have
off the court as well as on," Barte said. "We just kind of know
what the other person is going to do. I know exactly where
Lindsay will hit the ball and that is what makes us so good."
In the finals, Stanford faced the nation's top doubles
team of Natalie Pluskota and Caitlin Whoriskey from Ten
nessee, In their past two matches, the Cardinal and Lady
Vols had split. Pluskota/Whoriskey recorded the first win 8-
4 in the second-round of the ITA All-American Champi
onships, but Stanford rebounded and won 6-4,3-6,7-6 (4) in
the championship match of the ITA National Indoor Cham
pionships.
"In the first set, they were making it tough to play our
game," Lindsay Burdette said. "We had our chances in that
first set and ended up carrying it out. Second set, they got the
upper hand in an up-and-down set, but in the third, we start
ed to tough it out and that just carried us right through the
third all the way to the end."
In their most important match to
gether, Barte said the pair entered
the zone and just played their way
through the third set to close out the
match.
"I just felt like I was seeing the
ball and it looked like it was going
really slow," Barte said. "I was al
ways one step ahead of them."
With only two entrants into the
singles tournament freshman
Mallory Burdette and Barte the
Cardinal put up quite the challenge
but couldn't get to the finals.
Ranked No. 33, Mallory made it
to the second round this year before
falling to No. 7 Laura Vallverdu of
Miami 6-4,6-0. In the first round, she
defeated No. 58 Alexa Guarachi of
Alabama 6-1, 6-3. Mallory was the
player who clinched the NCAA
team tournament for Stanford, win
ning the go-ahead match that day.
She ends her season at 38-6 overall,
tied for most wins on the team and
capping off a phenomenal freshman
season.
Barte appeared dominant in tour
nament play until running into the in
spired No. 12 Chelsey Gullickson of
Georgia, the tournament's eventual
champion. Barte posted wins over
No. 55 Michaela Kissell of Marshall,
No. 88 Ute Schnoy of Denver, No. 44
Kristi Boxx of Mississippi and No. 40
Bianca Eichkorn of Miami. Barte
won in straight sets in all those
matches before falling to Gullickson
7-6(3), 6-3. With a final record of 38-
8, Barte earned All-America honors
in both singles and doubles for the
third consecutive year.
Lindsay Burdette has now fin
ished her college career, a long and
well-fought four years on the Stan
ford women's team that ended with
the NCAA team and doubles titles.
"That was my last hurrah, and I
was fighting back tears running
around warm-up this morning,"
Lindsay Burdette said. "It takes a lot
of effort and hard work to be able to
look back and say you gave it every
thing you had. I definitely accom
plished that goal. I played through
injuries, I did my part, and at the end
of the day, I think those things count
the most."
