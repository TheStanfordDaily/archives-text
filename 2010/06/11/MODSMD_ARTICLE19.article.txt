Lindsay Burdette can't be stopped this postseason, put
ting up another remarkable run to become NCAA doubles
champion with longtime partner Hilary Barte, and upset the
nation's No. 1 team from Tennessee 7-5,4-6,6-0.
"I have known deep down that Hilary and I were the best
team together," Lindsay Burdette said. "That showed me
that it was the right thing and it just made me work that
much harder so that we can be together."
The No. 2 team in the country all season, Burdette and
Barte have really proved their dominance. With an overall
record of 36-6, the team is Stanford's first NCAA doubles
champions since Alice Barnes and Erin Burdette Lind
say's older sister defeated Amber Liu and Ann Yelsey in
2005 in an all-Stanford final.
Their run to the final was a fairly routine affair. They
recorded four wins before the final match, all in straight sets.
In fact, their most dominant match came in the semifinals
over No. 4 Andrea Remynse and Yasmin Schnack of UCLA,
as they won 6-0,6-1.
The duo also defeated the No. 11 team of Csilla Borsanyi
and Lenka Broosova for the second time this postseason in
the quarterfinals by the score of 6-4,6-4. The last time they
met was when No. 8 Stanford upset No. 1 Baylor on its way
to its 16th NCAA championship. Barte/Burdette defeated
Borsanyi/Broosova in a close 9-8 (3) match that time.
"I don't really know how to put it into words, but I think
a lot of what makes [Lindsay and me] good is what we have
off the court as well as on," Barte said. "We just kind of know
what the other person is going to do. I know exactly where
Lindsay will hit the ball and that is what makes us so good."
In the finals, Stanford faced the nation's top doubles
team of Natalie Pluskota and Caitlin Whoriskey from Ten
nessee, In their past two matches, the Cardinal and Lady
Vols had split. Pluskota/Whoriskey recorded the first win 8-
4 in the second-round of the ITA All-American Champi
onships, but Stanford rebounded and won 6-4,3-6,7-6 (4) in
the championship match of the ITA National Indoor Cham
pionships.
"In the first set, they were making it tough to play our
game," Lindsay Burdette said. "We had our chances in that
first set and ended up carrying it out. Second set, they got the
upper hand in an up-and-down set, but in the third, we start
ed to tough it out and that just carried us right through the
third all the way to the end."
