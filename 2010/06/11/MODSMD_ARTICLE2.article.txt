## Endowment is hit, drops by 27 percent 
### JOANNA XU DESK EDITOR

The Stanford Management
Company (SMC) announced last
week that the Stanford Merged Pool
(SMP), which includes most of the
University's endowment and ex
pendable funds, has experienced a
25.9 percent investment loss for the
year ending June 30,2009.
Overall, the endowment's value,
including gifts from donors and $959
million in payouts for University op
erations, fell 27 percent to approxi
mately $12.6 billion in the fiscal year
ending Aug. 31.
The largest previous loss in Stan
ford endowment was a decline of 6.2

percent in 1974.
"This was a year where almost
everything struggled," said John
Powers, president and CEO of SMC.
"There weren't many steady places.
In a year where most asset classes
were down, for us, real estate and
natural resources were hit particu
larly hard."

Investment Strategy
The drop in Stanford's endow
ment is comparable to that of Har
vard, whose endowment value de
clined 30 percent, and Yale, whose
endowment value fell 29 percent.
The similar numbers are due to
all three schools' reliance on so
called alternative assets such as com
modities, real estate and private eq
uity, which outperformed market in
dexes prior to 2007 but are less liquid
than stocks and bonds. The investment
strategy was largely pioneered by
Yale's chief investment officer, David
Swensen. Stanford still has roughly $6
to $7 billion invested across all illiquid
assets.
This strategy in the past has helped
endowments rack up double-digit gains
at times, and generally outperform var
ious market indexes. For example, over
the past 10 years, SMP received an an
nualized return of 8.9 percent while the
U.S. equity market as measured by the
S&P 500 Index declined an average 2.2
percent per year. The U.S. bond market
as measured by the Barclays Aggregate
Bond Index increased 6.0 percent per
year.
However, this year the alternative
investment strategy meant double-digit
losses. Meanwhile, endowments that in
vested in mostly stocks and bonds did
not lose as much value.
For example, the University of
Pennsylvania's endowment is expected
to decline 15.7 percent, MlT's by rough
ly 21 percent and Columbia's by 16.1
percent.
Still, Powers believes the alternative
investment strategy is viable. "We do
believe that the fundamental principle
of using alternative investments to in
crease diversification and returns
makes sense," he said.
"We just have to be careful that
whatever we implement doesn't put us
in a situation where we're uncomfort
able with the level of liquidity in the
portfolio," he added. "You have to be
really clear and have sufficient reserves
of liquidity to meet the needs of the
University and the potential claims
against the Merged Pool. You need to
plan your liquidity reserves very care
fully."
Portfolio Allocation
Despite the losses, not all of Stan
ford's investments are down.
"We had a number of strategies that
were up, but not in any broad asset
classes," Powers said. "Some individual
managers and strategies within broader
asset classes did manage to generate
some big returns."
Most of the funds in SMP are man
aged through external money man
agers who are paid on a performance
basis.
"We get reports from them regular
ly, and we talk to them regularly as well,
both via reports they send us and our
staying actively involved," Powers said.
"With respect to compensation, very

many of them are on an incentive sys
tem where they only make bonuses if
they're up. When we enter a contract
with a fund manager, they will charge
some fees but don't have the ability to
generate big bonus pools unless they
really generate awesome returns."
Powers also stressed that while it is
important to manage the risk in the en
dowment portfolio carefully, it is also
important not to overreact by becom
ing too risk-averse.
"In the past year, if you look at how
much the market's moved, the equity
markets had a once-in-80-years kind of
move," Powers said. "It'll be just as dan
gerous to overreact to a once-in-80-
years move on a five-, 10- or 20-year
basis."
Current projections from top ad
ministrators indicate more measured
expectations for growth than the years
prior to the endowment's steep decline.
University President John Hennessy
said earlier in the year at the annui
meeting of the Academic Council that
assuming a three percent inflation rate,
an eight percent annual return for the
next five years and 10 percent after that,
it may take more than 30 years for the
University endowment to reach its
peak levels of $17.2 billion.
"Certainly, we would hope to do
better than that timeframe," Powers
said. "The markets have rallied here,
but the economy's still under a severe
amount of stress."
For now, the University will be as
suming that it will take a long time to re
cover the endowment losses, but they
will be "working [their] best to expedite
that," Powers said.
Liquidity
A Wall Street Journal blog reported
last Friday that SMC has tapped Co
gent Partners, a private equity-focused
investment bank, to gauge investor in
terest for a possible secondary sale of its
alternative investment portfolio.
However, Stanford has not con
firmed this secondary sale and stressed
that it is, for the moment, adequately
buffered in liquidity.
"The University remains confident
in its ability to meet the liquidity needs
of the payout and in managing the en
dowment," Powers said.
In April, Stanford issued $ 1 billion in
taxable debt, which created liquidity in
Stanford's portfolio.
However, according to Randy Liv
ingston, Stanford's vice president for
business affairs and chief financial offi
cer, of the $1 billion that Stanford issued
in debt last spring, $2OO million was
used to refinance previously existing
debt and $BOO million was placed in
money market funds as a liquidity re
serve.
"So far, we have not had to draw on
the liquidity reserve, nor do we expect

to in the near future," Powers said.

Payouts
The University normally uses a
smoothing formula whereby endow
ment returns and losses are spread over
a long-term timeframe so that payouts
can remain relatively stable. "However,
following the extraordinary investment
downturn last year, the University
elected to suspend the smoothing for
mula for two years," Livingston said.
Instead, Stanford will accelerate the
payout reductions and budget cuts in
order to "get the pains behind us and
begin the recovery process," Livingston
said. Payouts on individual endowment
funds will decrease by 10 percent this
fiscal year and a planned 15 percent
next fiscal year.
"Had we continued using the
smoothing formula, we would have ex
pected five to six years of reductions in
endowment payouts and budget cuts,"
Livingston said.
In fiscal year 2009, investment in
come from the endowment accounted
for 29 percent of the University's budg
et; for Yale and Harvard, the numbers
were 42 percent and 33 percent, respec
tively. Nonetheless, with decreased pay
out from individual funds, the percent
age of operating budget supported by
endowment will also reduce.
"Endowment income is projected to
represent only 22 percent of consolidat
ed University revenue during the cur
rent fiscal year," Livingston said.
To accommodate accelerated pay
out reductions, the University has, for
the most part, already completed neces
sary budget cuts by imposing a Univer
sity-wide salary freeze, laying off over
400 staff members, postponing $l.l bil
lion of capital projects and consolidat
ing programs, among other reductions.
So far, the biggest concern is a finan
cial aid shortfall, as the University has
not made any reductions in student fi
nancial aid despite the fact endowment
payout supporting financial aid is de
creasing as well.
' 'The financial aid shortfall remains a
significant challenge," Livingston said.
"A major focus of the remaining two
years of the Stanford Challenge
[fundraising campaign] will be to raise
more endowment gifts for undergradu
ate financial aid."
And good news? No further staff
layoffs are expected.
"Overall, we expect headcount to
stay roughly flat," Livingston said.
"We'll likely see some hiring of staff to
support research grants that are grow
ing as a result of the federal stimulus
package, offset by modest staff reduc
tions in other areas as units fully adjust
to reduced budget levels."

suming that it will take a long time to re
cover the endowment losses, but they
will be "working [their] best to expedite
that," Powers said.
Liquidity
A Wall Street Journal blog reported
last Friday that SMC has tapped Co
gent Partners, a private equity-focused
investment bank, to gauge investor in
terest for a possible secondary sale of its
alternative investment portfolio.
However, Stanford has not con
firmed this secondary sale and stressed
that it is, for the moment, adequately
buffered in liquidity.
"The University remains confident
in its ability to meet the liquidity needs
of the payout and in managing the en
dowment," Powers said.
In April, Stanford issued $ 1 billion in
taxable debt, which created liquidity in
Stanford's portfolio.
However, according to Randy Liv
ingston, Stanford's vice president for
business affairs and chief financial offi
cer, of the $1 billion that Stanford issued
in debt last spring, $2OO million was
used to refinance previously existing
debt and $BOO million was placed in
money market funds as a liquidity re
serve.
"So far, we have not had to draw on
the liquidity reserve, nor do we expect

to in the near future," Powers said.

Payouts
The University normally uses a
smoothing formula whereby endow
ment returns and losses are spread over
a long-term timeframe so that payouts
can remain relatively stable. "However,
following the extraordinary investment
downturn last year, the University
elected to suspend the smoothing for
mula for two years," Livingston said.
Instead, Stanford will accelerate the
payout reductions and budget cuts in
order to "get the pains behind us and
begin the recovery process," Livingston
said. Payouts on individual endowment
funds will decrease by 10 percent this
fiscal year and a planned 15 percent
next fiscal year.
"Had we continued using the
smoothing formula, we would have ex
pected five to six years of reductions in
endowment payouts and budget cuts,"
Livingston said.
In fiscal year 2009, investment in
come from the endowment accounted
for 29 percent of the University's budg
et; for Yale and Harvard, the numbers
were 42 percent and 33 percent, respec
tively. Nonetheless, with decreased pay
out from individual funds, the percent
age of operating budget supported by
endowment will also reduce.
"Endowment income is projected to
represent only 22 percent of consolidat
ed University revenue during the cur
rent fiscal year," Livingston said.
To accommodate accelerated pay
out reductions, the University has, for
the most part, already completed neces
sary budget cuts by imposing a Univer
sity-wide salary freeze, laying off over
400 staff members, postponing $l.l bil
lion of capital projects and consolidat
ing programs, among other reductions.
So far, the biggest concern is a finan
cial aid shortfall, as the University has
not made any reductions in student fi
nancial aid despite the fact endowment
payout supporting financial aid is de
creasing as well.
' 'The financial aid shortfall remains a
significant challenge," Livingston said.
"A major focus of the remaining two
years of the Stanford Challenge
[fundraising campaign] will be to raise
more endowment gifts for undergradu
ate financial aid."
And good news? No further staff
layoffs are expected.
"Overall, we expect headcount to
stay roughly flat," Livingston said.
"We'll likely see some hiring of staff to
support research grants that are grow
ing as a result of the federal stimulus
package, offset by modest staff reduc
tions in other areas as units fully adjust
to reduced budget levels."

The Stanford Management
Company (SMC) announced last
week that the Stanford Merged Pool
(SMP), which includes most of the
University's endowment and ex
pendable funds, has experienced a
25.9 percent investment loss for the
year ending June 30,2009.
Overall, the endowment's value,
including gifts from donors and $959
million in payouts for University op
erations, fell 27 percent to approxi
mately $12.6 billion in the fiscal year
ending Aug. 31.
The largest previous loss in Stan
ford endowment was a decline of 6.2

percent in 1974.
"This was a year where almost
everything struggled," said John
Powers, president and CEO of SMC.
"There weren't many steady places.
In a year where most asset classes
were down, for us, real estate and
natural resources were hit particu
larly hard."

Investment Strategy
The drop in Stanford's endow
ment is comparable to that of Har
vard, whose endowment value de
clined 30 percent, and Yale, whose
endowment value fell 29 percent.
The similar numbers are due to
all three schools' reliance on so
called alternative assets such as com
modities, real estate and private eq
uity, which outperformed market in
dexes prior to 2007 but are less liquid
than stocks and bonds. The investment
strategy was largely pioneered by
Yale's chief investment officer, David
Swensen. Stanford still has roughly $6
to $7 billion invested across all illiquid
assets.
This strategy in the past has helped
endowments rack up double-digit gains
at times, and generally outperform var
ious market indexes. For example, over
the past 10 years, SMP received an an
nualized return of 8.9 percent while the
U.S. equity market as measured by the
S&P 500 Index declined an average 2.2
percent per year. The U.S. bond market
as measured by the Barclays Aggregate
Bond Index increased 6.0 percent per
year.
However, this year the alternative
investment strategy meant double-digit
losses. Meanwhile, endowments that in
vested in mostly stocks and bonds did
not lose as much value.
For example, the University of
Pennsylvania's endowment is expected
to decline 15.7 percent, MlT's by rough
ly 21 percent and Columbia's by 16.1
percent.
Still, Powers believes the alternative
investment strategy is viable. "We do
believe that the fundamental principle
of using alternative investments to in
crease diversification and returns
makes sense," he said.
"We just have to be careful that
whatever we implement doesn't put us
in a situation where we're uncomfort
able with the level of liquidity in the
portfolio," he added. "You have to be
really clear and have sufficient reserves
of liquidity to meet the needs of the
University and the potential claims
against the Merged Pool. You need to
plan your liquidity reserves very care
fully."
Portfolio Allocation
Despite the losses, not all of Stan
ford's investments are down.
"We had a number of strategies that
were up, but not in any broad asset
classes," Powers said. "Some individual
managers and strategies within broader
asset classes did manage to generate
some big returns."
Most of the funds in SMP are man
aged through external money man
agers who are paid on a performance
basis.
"We get reports from them regular
ly, and we talk to them regularly as well,
both via reports they send us and our
staying actively involved," Powers said.
"With respect to compensation, very

many of them are on an incentive sys
tem where they only make bonuses if
they're up. When we enter a contract
with a fund manager, they will charge
some fees but don't have the ability to
generate big bonus pools unless they
really generate awesome returns."
Powers also stressed that while it is
important to manage the risk in the en
dowment portfolio carefully, it is also
important not to overreact by becom
ing too risk-averse.
"In the past year, if you look at how
much the market's moved, the equity
markets had a once-in-80-years kind of
move," Powers said. "It'll be just as dan
gerous to overreact to a once-in-80-
years move on a five-, 10- or 20-year
basis."
Current projections from top ad
ministrators indicate more measured
expectations for growth than the years
prior to the endowment's steep decline.
University President John Hennessy
said earlier in the year at the annui
meeting of the Academic Council that
assuming a three percent inflation rate,
an eight percent annual return for the
next five years and 10 percent after that,
it may take more than 30 years for the
University endowment to reach its
peak levels of $17.2 billion.
"Certainly, we would hope to do
better than that timeframe," Powers
said. "The markets have rallied here,
but the economy's still under a severe
amount of stress."
For now, the University will be as
suming that it will take a long time to re
cover the endowment losses, but they
will be "working [their] best to expedite
that," Powers said.
