# Amazingly, there's still hope

Last weekend's buzzer-beater
loss to Arizona was remark
ably devastating for the
Stanford men's basketball
team and its fans. For those
who weren't able to attend and
judging by attendance at Maples
merely 10 minutes before game time,
this includes a lot of you the brief
summary of the game is we let a 5-
foot-10 faux hawk record career-highs
in points, buzzer beaters and time feel
ing like a man, as he banked home a
running 15-footer as time expired.
That isn't to say that the Cardinal
played no role in the loss. On the con
trary, key players couldn't convert free
throws in crunch time, again, and it
cost Stanford the game, again. This,
coupled with the faux hawk's ability to
repeatedly penetrate deep into the
paint, ultimately led to heartbreak.
Oh, and an egregious no-call on the
game-clinching play didn't help either.
If you see Jack Trotter in the near fu
ture, make sure you're careful not to
touch his hand I'm sure it's still
throbbing.
But I digress. Saturday marks the
Big Game when Dawkins and Co.
take on regular season Pac-10 champi
on Cal.The Cardinal will undoubtedly
be the underdog, and considering that
the Pac-10 will be ever so fortunate to
even be in the conversation of at-large
bids for the Big Dance, this game will
seem meaningless to most of you. It's
understandable it's hard to empha
size the importance of a game in
March for a team that is 13-16, coming
off a two-loss weekend at home, cur
rently sitting in eighth in a conference
of 10 and facing an opponent that it
lost to by 26 in the first meeting.
But to hell with that, this is one of
the most important games of the year
for any Stanford sport.
With a win Saturday in the final
game of the regular season, Stanford
will avoid the play-in game for the
Pac-10 Tournament. (It should be
noted that the eighth and ninth seeds
in the conference usually square off in
the play-in game, but since USC's
shenanigans finally bit the Trojans in
the ass, they will be watching from
home on a flat screen most likely pur
chased by DeMar De√üozan while he
was in school). If this happens, which is
all but certain, Stanford will then need
to win three consecutive games in
order to make it to the NCAA Tour
nament. Three.

This isn't the Big East, nor is it the
Big 12. This is the Pac-10 in its worst
year of all time. Still, it's fair if you're
shaking your skeptical little head,
muttering that there is no way that this
Stanford team, the same one that lost
four seniors and is coming off a loss in
the CBI to Oregon State just one year
ago, has no chance whatsoever of com
peting for a tourney bid. But it must be
understood just how awful the Card's
peers are, and just how possible a Pac
-10 Tourney victory is.

The No. 1 and No. 2 seeds in this
year's conference showdown? Cal and
Arizona State, respectively. Let's start
with the latter. Arizona State is cur
rently 10-6 in conference, having lost
