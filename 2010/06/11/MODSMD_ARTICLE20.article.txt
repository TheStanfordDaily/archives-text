# Amazingly, there's still hope

Last weekend's buzzer-beater
loss to Arizona was remark
ably devastating for the
Stanford men's basketball
team and its fans. For those
who weren't able to attend and
judging by attendance at Maples
merely 10 minutes before game time,
this includes a lot of you the brief
summary of the game is we let a 5-
foot-10 faux hawk record career-highs
in points, buzzer beaters and time feel
ing like a man, as he banked home a
running 15-footer as time expired.
That isn't to say that the Cardinal
played no role in the loss. On the con
trary, key players couldn't convert free
throws in crunch time, again, and it
cost Stanford the game, again. This,
coupled with the faux hawk's ability to
repeatedly penetrate deep into the
paint, ultimately led to heartbreak.
Oh, and an egregious no-call on the
game-clinching play didn't help either.
If you see Jack Trotter in the near fu
ture, make sure you're careful not to
touch his hand I'm sure it's still
throbbing.
But I digress. Saturday marks the
Big Game when Dawkins and Co.
take on regular season Pac-10 champi
on Cal.The Cardinal will undoubtedly
be the underdog, and considering that
the Pac-10 will be ever so fortunate to
even be in the conversation of at-large
bids for the Big Dance, this game will
seem meaningless to most of you. It's
understandable it's hard to empha
size the importance of a game in
March for a team that is 13-16, coming
off a two-loss weekend at home, cur
rently sitting in eighth in a conference
of 10 and facing an opponent that it
lost to by 26 in the first meeting.
But to hell with that, this is one of
the most important games of the year
for any Stanford sport.
With a win Saturday in the final
game of the regular season, Stanford
will avoid the play-in game for the
Pac-10 Tournament. (It should be
noted that the eighth and ninth seeds
in the conference usually square off in
the play-in game, but since USC's
shenanigans finally bit the Trojans in
the ass, they will be watching from
home on a flat screen most likely pur
chased by DeMar De√üozan while he
was in school). If this happens, which is
all but certain, Stanford will then need
to win three consecutive games in
order to make it to the NCAA Tour
nament. Three.

This isn't the Big East, nor is it the
Big 12. This is the Pac-10 in its worst
year of all time. Still, it's fair if you're
shaking your skeptical little head,
muttering that there is no way that this
Stanford team, the same one that lost
four seniors and is coming off a loss in
the CBI to Oregon State just one year
ago, has no chance whatsoever of com
peting for a tourney bid. But it must be
understood just how awful the Card's
peers are, and just how possible a Pac
-10 Tourney victory is.

The No. 1 and No. 2 seeds in this
year's conference showdown? Cal and
Arizona State, respectively. Let's start
with the latter. Arizona State is cur
rently 10-6 in conference, having lost

to Arizona and UCLA (two teams
that have a combined record of (27-
29). Its best non-conference win was
in the battle of the party schools, when
the Sun Devils netted a victory
against San Diego State, Cal hasn't
fared much better, losing to a dismal
Oregon State team among others
while going 12-5 in conference. The
Bears' best non-conference win?
Murray State.
I'm not making the case that Stan
ford leaves a lot to be desired, because
well, it does. But this team has been
extremely competitive with decent
competition, including many teams
that will be dancing in a few weeks. It
only seems like yesterday that the
Cardinal was just a mere free throw
away from upsetting Kentucky in
Cancun.
The key to the Cardinal's success
this weekend as well as the Pac-10
Tournament is obviously Landry
Fields. We go as he goes, and it doesn't
take a bracketologist to figure out that
if he underperforms, we're royally

screwed. However, Stanford really,
and I mean really needs Jeremy
Green to play consistently good bas
ketball. He has the potential to be the
best player on the floor every time he
is in the game; it's just a matter of
reaching that potential. We've seen
glimpses of his brilliance, and if he can
find his stroke for just four games,
Stanford is money.
The bottom line is to not abandon
this team. I don't care if you've been
called a fair weather fan for leaving
games early, or if the 35 dollars turned
you off from basketball this year. We
all forgive you. Please, for the love of
everything Cardinal, come to the
game Saturday. With enough luck and
support, Stanford could find itself
among the best in a matter of days. I
know it's a long shot, but these guys
deserve your fandom for just one
month.
Still not sold? Stanford is only 10
games away from winning a national
title. Welcome to March.

Zach Zimmerman will wear a faux
hawk if Stanford wins the NCAA
Tournament this year. If that isn't
enough of a reason to root for Stan
ford, suggest better haircuts at
