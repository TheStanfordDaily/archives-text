# UCONN: IT'S ON

It's on.The rematch that most fans of
women's college basketball were proba
bly hoping for will take place tonight
when Stanford takes on Connecticut in
the national championship game.
This isn't a David and Goliath story,
but the fact that the No. 2 team in the na
tion and No. 1 seed Cardinal (36-1,18-0
Pac-10) will be the definite underdog
going into this contest says everything
about the undefeated and undisputed
No.l UConn Huskies (38-0, 16-0 Big
East).
The all-time series between these two
teams from opposite sides of the country is
tied at 5-5, but it is the recent history that
will be in the minds of the players stepping
out onto the court. By that measure the
score is 3-1 in the Huskies' favor, and they
hold a two-game win streak over the Car
dinal.
Were it not for Connecticut, Stanford
would have had a perfect season. The sin
gle road loss in Storrs, Conn., is the only
blemish on a record-breaking season that
has given the Card both its highest num
ber of wins, 36, and longest winning streak,
27, in school history. Since Jan. 18, 2009,
the team has lost to just one school:
UConn.
The last time the Huskies dropped a
game was two years ago against Stan
ford, and it was a crucial one. If the Car
dinal had not knocked them out of the
Final Four in 2007, the Huskies could
very well be chasing their third straight
NCAA title,
Connecticut head coach Geno Au
riemma knows that his team, a group that
has blown most teams clear out of the
water at every stage this year, is seen as
the bad guys. He is not afraid to reinforce
this opinion with his words.
"Let me tell you something," he said.
"If we're still undefeated next year at the
end of December, then you know what?
I'm not going to come back afterward."
"It will be pointless," he continued.
"I will just lose all respect for every
body coaching college basketball in this
country."
Those words came in response to a
question about how his team will cope
after graduating five seniors, but they are

sure to add fuel to the media fire.
The Connecticut team certainly looks
to be a formidable opponent on paper.
Two of its players, senior center Tina
Charles and junior forward Maya Moore,
were named to the State Farm All-Amer
ica Basketball Team this week, and Moore
also became only the third player in histo
ry to win the State Farm Wade Trophy for
a second time. Charles was also awarded
the Naismith College Player of the Year.
Stanford, however, is not far behind
on accolades. The Card joined UConn as
the only other school to have two players
named to the State Farm All-America
team senior center Jayne Appel and
sophomore forward Nnemkadi Ogwu
mike. Before Moore impressed the
crowds at the Alamodome Sunday night
with 34 points and 12 rebounds, Ogwu
mike had already finished her day's
work, scoring an NCAA semifinal record
of 38 points and grabbing 16 rebounds.
The performances of all five Cardinal
starters will be a key factor in whether
head coach Tara VanDerveer's team can
stop the Huskies' domination of this
tournament. UConn had its closest game
yet in its Final Four defeat of Baylor, but
still won by 20 points.
Offensively, Stanford also needs to
execute more successfully to reach its full
potential. Ogwumike's record aside, the
Cardinal shot poorly in the semifinal win
over Oklahoma and the team cannot af
ford to repeatedly miss from good shoot
ing positions if it is to defeat the Huskies.
The Cardinal showed a glimpse back in
December that perhaps it can compete
with, and defeat, the unanimous top team
in the country. That game ended 80-68 in
UConn's favor, but Stanford held a nar
row lead at halftime and had succeeded
up to that point at keeping the Huskies in
check.

Both groups of players have played a
lot of games since, however, and these are
not the same teams that faced each other
over three months ago. If any team can
prevent the Huskies from earning their
second straight title it will be the Cardi
nal, and, if Stanford comes away victori
ous, the revenge will be very sweet.
The final game of the season will take
place at 5:30 p.m. PST from the Alamod
ome in San Antonio, Tex.
