The No. 1 ranked Stanford men's gymnas
tics team started its season with a crucial win
over No. 2 Cal in the Haas Pavilion last Fri
day in Berkeley, Calif. The Cardinal beat the
Golden Bears by over 11 points, with a com
bined team score of 352.75 to Cal's 340.10
a considerably large margin to win by in the
gymnastics realm.
"It always feels good to dominate Cal,"
said junior team captain Tim Gentry.
Stanford was down by 1.5 points after its
first rotation on pommel horse, but they did
come through with two big scores by juniors
Eric Hergenrader and Josh Dixon with a
14.25 and 14.0, respectively. Although Cal is
known for their great pommel horse and par
allel bars, Stanford was able to make up the

points on the other events.
On floor, freshmen Eddie Penev made his
debut and produced the highest score on the
event with a 15.6. Penev began his routine
with an explosive double layout with two
twists. Since the four highest scores from each
event contribute to the team score, the junior
class made its hit routines count Gentry
scored a 15.25, Josh Dixon had a 15.05 and

Alex Buscaglia had a 15.0.
The team carried its momentum to vault
and scored their highest event score of the
night. Dixon stuck his double twisting vault
and procured a 15.85 to heat things up. The
rest of the line-up followed suit with high
scores from Penev (15.75), Buscaglia (16.0)
and Gentry (16.1), who came agonizingly
close to sticking his handspring double front.

Rings was another highlight of the night
with several stuck landings and clean lines
from redshirt freshmen starter Jordan Nolff,
junior Ryan Lieberman and senior Nick
Noone. The Cardinal has a clear advantage
over any team on this event, beating Cal by
over 4 points on the rings. Gentry dominated
with a 15.65 and scored a full point more than
Noone (14.65) who placed second. Freshmen
anchor James Fosco also had an impressive
routine despite coming off a foot injury and
having to skip the dismount.
The Cardinal lost a bit of momentum on
the high bar and parallel bars and had a few
falls, though Buscaglia and Lieberman were
able to clutch first and second place on high
bar with a 14.85 and 14.7. Although Stan
ford's high bar wasn't its best, Cal did not fare
better. ITie Golden Bears were forced to
count two 12's toward their team score. How-

"It always feels good to
dominate Cal."
TIM GENTRY, junior team captain
ever, it was all Cal on parallel bars.
The Bears took down Stanford by
almost two points with the help of
Kyle Bunthuwong's 15.5. There
were a few standout routines by
Lieberman (14.35) and Dixon
(14.6).
"Fortunately, by the last event, we
had built up quite a lead and it was
n't even close." commented Gentry.
"We just need to start focusing
on detail areas and polishing our
routines. Everyone had some mis
takes and we will be hoping to fix
those as we prepare for this meet,"
said Gentry. "We will be looking for
a repeat domination win this week
end at home on Saturday."
The meet will be held in Burn
ham Pavilion at 7 p.m.
