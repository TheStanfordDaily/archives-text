At yesterday's IRA National
Championships in Cherry Hill, N.J.,
the No. 2 Stanford women's light
weight rowing team took home its
first national title.
The Lightweight Eight team, cap
tained by junior Gretchen
Stumhofer, defeated favorite Wis
consin by nearly four seconds, with
Princeton taking third place.
With a final time of 6:28.209, the
team also set a new course record by
almost a second.

The victory is the first time Stan
ford's lightweights have won an IRA
national championship. Their previ
ous best finish was third place, which
they took him in 2008 and 2009.
In its other event, the Lightweight
Four, the Cardinal rowers placed
fifth with a time of 7:44.833.
While the lightweight's victory is
not an NCAA Championship, it
marks the third national title won
overall by Stanford's teams this
spring. Last month, the men's volley
ball and women's tennis teams both
took home titles.
