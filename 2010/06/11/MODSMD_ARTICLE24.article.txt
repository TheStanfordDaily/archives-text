EAST PALO ALTO A twin
engine Cessna 310 crashed soon after
takeoff from Palo Alto Airport early
Wednesday, killing three Tesla Motors
employees on board, cutting off power
to Palo Alto and parts of Stanford for
much of the day and giving the resi
dents of a small neighborhood a fiery
awakening.
The plane took off in thick fog just
before 8 a.m., bound for Hawthorne
Municipal Airport south of Los Ange
les, according to Menlo Park Fire Chief
Harold Schapelhouman. But instead
of turning right after takeoff as is cus
tomary to comply with the airport's
noise abatement procedure, the plane
flew straight toward a residential area
of East Palo Alto, clipping three power
lines attached to a 100-foot transmis
sion tower at the eastern end of Beech
Street.
Reconstructing the crash for re
porters, Schapelhouman said one of
the plane's wings and a landing gear
unit broke off after impact with the
power lines and struck a Beech Street
home and day care center. No children
were in the day care at the time of the
crash, and seven people, including a
baby, safely escaped the burning
house.
The remaining fuselage of the air
craft continued flying for half a block
before hitting the street, spraying
burning fuel onto another house, skid
ding into a BMW, lighting two other
vehicles on fire and coming to a rest be
tween 1180 and 1188 Beech St.
National Transportation Safety
Board (NTSB) officials arrived in East
Palo Alto late Wednesday to begin
their investigation of the official cause
of the crash.
Destroyed homes and cars aside,
the residents of Beech Street may con
sider themselves lucky: no one on the
ground was seriously injured. Schapel
houman told reporters it was "either
very fortunate or intentional" that the
Cessna's pilot brought the plane down
on the street and not on houses.
Tesla Loses Three
Tesla Motors, the San Carlos-based
company that just last month signaled
its intent to go public, lost three of its

own in Wednesday's crash. In a state
ment Wednesday, CEO Elon Musk
said the company withheld the identi
ties of the plane's passengers while
their families were notified.
"Our thoughts and prayers are with
them," Musk said. "Tesla is a small,
tightly-knit company, and this is a trag
ic day for us."
According to media reports, the
Cessna was registered to a company
owned by Doug Bourn, a senior elec
trical engineer at Tesla. Bourn received
a B.S. in electrical engineering from
Stanford in 1973. Neither Tesla nor au
thorities at the scene would confirm
whether Bourn was at the controls or
even on board. [Ed. note: Bourn, 56,
was later confirmed as the pilot and one
of the three killed.]
According to a biography on the
American Society of Mechanical En
gineers Web site, Bourn played a key
role in designing and testing the power
electronic module for the Roadster,
Tesla's flagship vehicle.
Damaged Tower Zaps Power
Less than half a minute after take
off, the aircraft met its first obstacle:
power lines attached to a 100-foot Pa
cific Gas and Electric (PG&E) trans
mission tower at the eastern end of
Beech Street. The lines serve munici
pal utilities in Palo Alto, said Joe Moli
ca, a PG&E spokesperson.
Palo Alto immediately lost power,
stalling traffic signals and backing up
traffic along major roads. The outage
also stripped power from Stanford
Hospital & Clinics, which issued an
alert at 9:30 a.m. that its buildings and
the Lucile Packard Children's Hospi
tal were operating on emergency
power. The centers put non-emer
gency cases on hold, canceled clinic ap
pointments and continued operating
cases and care for women in delivery
and labor. The hospital's emergency
room was open "only for the most ur
gent situations."
Caltrain officials advised drivers in
Palo Alto to take extra caution when
driving across train tracks on Wednes
day, as the outage raised concerns at
crossing gates at two intersections.
"The traffic signals are connected
to train signals," said Christine Dunn, a
Caltrain spokesperson. "[The gates]
are coordinated so that when traffic
signals turn red, they correspond to
that."

Dunn said Caltrain officials imme
diately set up generators at Charleston
Road and Churchill Avenue to ensure
that gates were working properly. Cal
train also dispatched personnel to
monitor both intersections for safety.
Trains were "required to slow down"
to 15 miles per hour when entering
each of the two intersections, Dunn
said.
Because of the outage, trains expe
rienced delays of up to 10 minutes
throughout the day.
The outage also affected Palo Alto

schools, where students enjoyed a laid
back Wednesday playing board games
and soaking up the sunlight instead of
sitting in dark classrooms.
"We had moved our class from our
normal classroom into the library,
where the windows were bigger and it
would be easier to see," said Spencer
Schoeben, a sophomore at Palo Alto
High School. "Not much work got
done, though."
Power was restored to Palo Alto

day, as the outage raised concerns at
crossing gates at two intersections.
"The traffic signals are connected
to train signals," said Christine Dunn, a
Caltrain spokesperson. "[The gates]
are coordinated so that when traffic
signals turn red, they correspond to
that."

Dunn said Caltrain officials imme
diately set up generators at Charleston
Road and Churchill Avenue to ensure
that gates were working properly. Cal
train also dispatched personnel to
monitor both intersections for safety.
Trains were "required to slow down"
to 15 miles per hour when entering
each of the two intersections, Dunn
said.
Because of the outage, trains expe
rienced delays of up to 10 minutes
throughout the day.
The outage also affected Palo Alto

schools, where students enjoyed a laid
back Wednesday playing board games
and soaking up the sunlight instead of
sitting in dark classrooms.
"We had moved our class from our
normal classroom into the library,
where the windows were bigger and it
would be easier to see," said Spencer
Schoeben, a sophomore at Palo Alto
High School. "Not much work got
done, though."
Power was restored to Palo Alto
