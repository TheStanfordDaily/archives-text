In an incident called "profoundly
regrettable" by the vice provost for stu
dent affairs, student body president
David Gobaud learned that his run
ning mate, former vice president Jay de
la Torre, faced possible suspension for a
suspected Honor Code violation only
after he was mistakenly handed de la
Torre's case file late this summer in the
Judicial Affairs office, where he was
serving as a panelist on another case.
The claim, confirmed by top Uni
versity officials and de la Torre 'lO, has
raised questions about how the Office
of Judicial Affairs protects students'
privacy, as well as communication be
tween de la Torre and Gobaud 'OB, M.S.
'lO before and after their election, and
Gobaud's efforts as president to en
courage reform to parts of the judicial
process efforts that he says were ap
propriate even after he learned that his
vice president was in the Judicial Af
fairs process.
Gobaud offered the explanation
last Friday in response to questions
about when he learned that his vice
president was alleged to have plagia
rized code in a computer science class
last fall an Honor Code violation
whose standard penalty is a quarter
long suspension and 40 hours of com
munity service. De la Torre was found
responsible of the violation by a Judi
cial Affairs panel, received the stan
dard penalty, appealed it and was de
nied at a final hearing earlier this quar
ter. He resigned at a Nov. 11 meeting
with student leaders and President
Hennessy, and explained his suspen
sion in a public statement the next day.
"I was shocked," Gobaud said
about the day in late summer when, he
said, a Judicial Affairs staff member
mistakenly handed him the wrong case
file. He said when he opened it and saw
de la Torre's name on the paperwork,
"my jaw dropped. The person who
handed it to me, it was obviously like,
'Wait a minute.' I was like.'l don't think
I should have this.' She took it back."
Several top University officials have
responded to the mistake that appar
ently tipped Gobaud off to his vice
president's case, which, like all Judicial
Affairs cases, is promised in the Uni
versity's 1997 student judicial charter to

be kept confidential by the office.
"It is clear that multiple parties
made mistakes," said University Presi
dent John Hennessy in an e-mail to The
Daily, although he stopped short of
naming those parties.
Provost John Etchemendy called it
"a less serious mistake than if [the of
fice] lost the file, handed it to somebody
who wasn't on a panel," but said the in
cident was still "a serious mistake."
"I am aware that an extremely un
fortunate error occurred when David,
as a judicial affairs panelist, was given
the wrong file in preparation for a hear
ing during the summer," said Vice
Provost for Student Affairs Greg
Boardman in an e-mail to The Daily.
"As you know, confidentiality in the ju
dicial process is, and always has been, of
utmost importance, and this mistake,
while clearly unintentional, is pro
foundly regrettable."
Gobaud has gone to lengths to ex
plain the constraints he faced after
learning about the case, noting that
when he became a judicial affairs pan
elist last fall, he signed the standard
confidentiality agreement saying that
"information regarding any student's
disciplinary status is not to be discussed
with anyone... outside the judicial hear
ing without the written authorization
of the student."
Gobaud said that agreement meant
he could only seek advice about the in
cident from Judicial Affairs staff mem
bers and the associate vice provost who
oversees Judicial Affairs, Christine
Griffith. Griffith told The Daily that
panelists are expected to take their
concerns to office staff Gobaud said he
believed he could not take the issue to
any other administrators.
The day he saw the case file, Gob
aud said, "Jay and I talked, and he told
me about his case."
"David sat down with me because
he was suspicious something was up,
and I told him about my situation," de
la Torre said in an e-mail to The Daily.
The two said they then started planning
a transition for after de la Torre's resig
nation, which took place some two
months later.
"[Gobaud] was a good friend and
respected my privacy, so he didn't dis
cuss the situation with anyone I wasn't
comfortable sharing it with," de la
Torre said. Gobaud maintains he
