## ASSU V.P.'s cheating file falls into wrong hands 
### ELIZABETH TITUS DESK EDITOR 
Originally published on Dec. 2,2009.

In an incident called "profoundly
regrettable" by the vice provost for stu
dent affairs, student body president
David Gobaud learned that his run
ning mate, former vice president Jay de
la Torre, faced possible suspension for a
suspected Honor Code violation only
after he was mistakenly handed de la
Torre's case file late this summer in the
Judicial Affairs office, where he was
serving as a panelist on another case.
The claim, confirmed by top Uni
versity officials and de la Torre 'lO, has
raised questions about how the Office
of Judicial Affairs protects students'
privacy, as well as communication be
tween de la Torre and Gobaud 'OB, M.S.
'lO before and after their election, and
Gobaud's efforts as president to en
courage reform to parts of the judicial
process efforts that he says were ap
propriate even after he learned that his
vice president was in the Judicial Af
fairs process.
Gobaud offered the explanation
last Friday in response to questions
about when he learned that his vice
president was alleged to have plagia
rized code in a computer science class
last fall an Honor Code violation
whose standard penalty is a quarter
long suspension and 40 hours of com
munity service. De la Torre was found
responsible of the violation by a Judi
cial Affairs panel, received the stan
dard penalty, appealed it and was de
nied at a final hearing earlier this quar
ter. He resigned at a Nov. 11 meeting
with student leaders and President
Hennessy, and explained his suspen
sion in a public statement the next day.
"I was shocked," Gobaud said
about the day in late summer when, he
said, a Judicial Affairs staff member
mistakenly handed him the wrong case
file. He said when he opened it and saw
de la Torre's name on the paperwork,
"my jaw dropped. The person who
handed it to me, it was obviously like,
'Wait a minute.' I was like.'l don't think
I should have this.' She took it back."
Several top University officials have
responded to the mistake that appar
ently tipped Gobaud off to his vice
president's case, which, like all Judicial
Affairs cases, is promised in the Uni
versity's 1997 student judicial charter to

be kept confidential by the office.
"It is clear that multiple parties
made mistakes," said University Presi
dent John Hennessy in an e-mail to The
Daily, although he stopped short of
naming those parties.
Provost John Etchemendy called it
"a less serious mistake than if [the of
fice] lost the file, handed it to somebody
who wasn't on a panel," but said the in
cident was still "a serious mistake."
"I am aware that an extremely un
fortunate error occurred when David,
as a judicial affairs panelist, was given
the wrong file in preparation for a hear
ing during the summer," said Vice
Provost for Student Affairs Greg
Boardman in an e-mail to The Daily.
"As you know, confidentiality in the ju
dicial process is, and always has been, of
utmost importance, and this mistake,
while clearly unintentional, is pro
foundly regrettable."
Gobaud has gone to lengths to ex
plain the constraints he faced after
learning about the case, noting that
when he became a judicial affairs pan
elist last fall, he signed the standard
confidentiality agreement saying that
"information regarding any student's
disciplinary status is not to be discussed
with anyone... outside the judicial hear
ing without the written authorization
of the student."
Gobaud said that agreement meant
he could only seek advice about the in
cident from Judicial Affairs staff mem
bers and the associate vice provost who
oversees Judicial Affairs, Christine
Griffith. Griffith told The Daily that
panelists are expected to take their
concerns to office staff Gobaud said he
believed he could not take the issue to
any other administrators.
The day he saw the case file, Gob
aud said, "Jay and I talked, and he told
me about his case."
"David sat down with me because
he was suspicious something was up,
and I told him about my situation," de
la Torre said in an e-mail to The Daily.
The two said they then started planning
a transition for after de la Torre's resig
nation, which took place some two
months later.
"[Gobaud] was a good friend and
respected my privacy, so he didn't dis
cuss the situation with anyone I wasn't
comfortable sharing it with," de la
Torre said. Gobaud maintains he
would have faced a Fundamental Stan
dard violation charge if he told anyone
else about the case.
Confidentiality, Reexamined
Griffith sat down with The Daily
and acknowledged that the mistake has
prompted a review of confidentiality
protocol in the Office of Judicial Af
fairs.
"I think given the weight of that re
sponsibility that we feel in terms of con
fidentiality that's the highest charge
we have in the office, no question," she
said. "Given how seriously we take that
responsibility, sure, it's huge when
there's a human error."
She described the review process
prompted by this summer's incident,
the likes of which have never, to her
knowledge, happened before.
"We review what our protocols are,
we try to determine, are there ways we
can implement better protocols? And
then we just reiterate the need [to staff]
to continue to be as committed to that
part of our work as we always have
been," Griffith said.
She said there have been no major
protocol changes, but two practices
have been reemphasized. One is requir
ing panelists to sign a confidentiality
agreement, as Gobaud did.
"The fact that they agree when they
volunteer to serve in this capacity to
keep all information confidential is a
big part of what we do," Griffith said.
The second practice is the electronic
document system the office switched to
earlier this summer, which allows pan
elists to access case files on a secure
server. Griffith said the system "serves
us well." Panelists can still request hard
copies of case files, as Gobaud did for
the case file he was supposed to pick up
that day.
Jamie Pontius-Hogan, a judicial ad
viser who works in the office, explained
the protocol for picking up file in per
son.
"We provided a kind of sealed enve
lope and they [the panelist] would walk
into the front desk," she said. "The per
son sitting at the front desk would say,
you know, 'I need to see your ID,' and
they'd sign the little sign-out form and
sign out the form and take the packet."
Despite the fact that someone ap
parently gave Gobaud the wrong case
file that day, Griffith said she is confi
dent about efforts to protect students'
privacy as promised in the judicial char
ter.
"No, I don't have concerns about
students' privacy being at risk," Griffith

said. "I have all the confidence that
we're doing everything we possibly can
to ensure that we don't have a repeat."
Yetting de la Torre
Gobaud and de la Torre have both
offered descriptions of their communi
cation before and after their election,
and de la Torre has explained why de
spite facing a possible suspension be
cause of the plagiarism claim against
him, he still ran.
"At the end of the day, I just wanted
to help people," de la Torre wrote in an
e-mail to The Daily. "I always saw Stan
ford as this safe, perfect space. The sto
ries I heard about students with mental
health challenges feeling alone and sto
ries [of] girls getting raped really got to
me, and I wanted to do something
about it.
"I've sat down and thought about
whether or not running and staying de
spite everything I was going through
was the right decision," he added, "and
I'm still struggling with that."
He told The Daily three weeks ago,
"I thought if I made my case ex
pressed my remorse well enough to
the judicial affairs panel, I could miti
gate the consequences. I was very opti
mistic."
Gobaud said that when he was eval
uating de la Torre as a running mate last
year, he did not ask him if he had any
"outstanding judicial affairs." Gobaud
said he did, however, talk extensively
with de la Torre about the time commit
ment necessary for student body exec
utives, and "nothing ever came up that
caused me to have any doubt that he
would be able to fulfill his duty."
At Tuesday's ASSU Undergraduate
Senate meeting, Gobaud also pointed
to the Judicial Affairs language that in
dicated to him it was possible for de la
Torre to delay a suspension.
According to the Judicial Affairs
Penalty Code, "responding students are
responsible for providing convincing
evidence that a suspension would have
an unduly harsh impact for instance,
intense and unavoidable public atten
tion for the Panel's consideration. In
rare instances, a quarter of suspension
may be postponed for a quarter, or at
the most, two quarters."
Senator Alex Katz 'l2 asked, "Is this
the reason, the sole reason, the an
nouncement didn't happen earlier?"
"This is one of the reasons," Gobaud
said. "He might have received an alter
nate sanction."
"Did you really not advise him
against that, telling him that was proba
bly not a reasonable expectation?"
Katz asked.
"I actually did tell him I didn't think
it was possible," Gobaud said.
After an appeal this fall, de la Torre's
suspension remained set for winter

quarter.
Of the 367 cases brought to Judicial
Affairs between 2004 and 2007
most of which were heard, though some
were dropped one has ended with a
reduced penalty after an appeal, ac
cording to statistics on the office's Web
site.
Gobaud's Judicial Reform
Meanwhile, students at Tuesday's
Senate meeting pressed Gobaud on his
efforts as president to encourage re
form to parts of the judicial process, ef
forts that he says were appropriate
even after he learned that his vice pres
ident faced suspension.
Gobaud said he wasn't ready to
specify what those efforts were, but
later outlined them to The Daily.
He said he had begun talking to ad
ministrators who work in or oversee the
Office of Judicial Affairs since the
spring and continued after learning
about de la Torre's case regarding
ideas to modify the judicial process.
One, he said, is to change the current
practice of assigning the same judicial
adviser to the "complaining party"
say, a professor or T.A. and the re
sponding student, which, he said, risks
confidentiality breaches.
The other idea, he said, is creating a
resource outside of the office to help
students through the "inherently stress
ful" judicial process.
Gobaud said he sent an e-mail to
President Hennessy, Provost
Etchemendy and Vice Provost Board
man shortly after de la Torre's public
announcement, both explaining the sit
uation and discussing his ideas.
He also called a meeting in early fall
between some Senate and Graduate
Student Council (GSC) members at his
Munger apartment to discuss the
Board of Judicial Affairs nominee issue
that spurred weeks of disagreement in
student government. There, too, he said
he discussed his ideas for judicial
changes.
At Tuesday's meeting, Senator
Zachaiy Wanna 'll, who is also The
Daily's columns editor, asked Gobaud,
"You did not see how involving legisla
tive bodies in a push against the Office
of Judicial Affairs just as your number
two is being reviewed under Judicial
Affairs, how that comes off as circum
spect?"
Gobaud said the meeting was to dis
cuss the board matter, not the office.
The Senate unanimously approved
Andy Parker 'll as Gobaud's nominee
to replace de la Torre as vice president.

"I thought if I made my case ex
pressed my remorse well enough to
the judicial affairs panel, I could miti
gate the consequences. I was very opti
mistic."
Gobaud said that when he was eval
uating de la Torre as a running mate last
year, he did not ask him if he had any
"outstanding judicial affairs." Gobaud
said he did, however, talk extensively
with de la Torre about the time commit
ment necessary for student body exec
utives, and "nothing ever came up that
caused me to have any doubt that he
would be able to fulfill his duty."
At Tuesday's ASSU Undergraduate
Senate meeting, Gobaud also pointed
to the Judicial Affairs language that in
dicated to him it was possible for de la
Torre to delay a suspension.
According to the Judicial Affairs
Penalty Code, "responding students are
responsible for providing convincing
evidence that a suspension would have
an unduly harsh impact for instance,
intense and unavoidable public atten
tion for the Panel's consideration. In
rare instances, a quarter of suspension
may be postponed for a quarter, or at
the most, two quarters."
Senator Alex Katz 'l2 asked, "Is this
the reason, the sole reason, the an
nouncement didn't happen earlier?"
"This is one of the reasons," Gobaud
said. "He might have received an alter
nate sanction."
"Did you really not advise him
against that, telling him that was proba
bly not a reasonable expectation?"
Katz asked.
"I actually did tell him I didn't think
it was possible," Gobaud said.
After an appeal this fall, de la Torre's
suspension remained set for winter

quarter.
Of the 367 cases brought to Judicial
Affairs between 2004 and 2007
most of which were heard, though some
were dropped one has ended with a
reduced penalty after an appeal, ac
cording to statistics on the office's Web
site.
Gobaud's Judicial Reform
Meanwhile, students at Tuesday's
Senate meeting pressed Gobaud on his
efforts as president to encourage re
form to parts of the judicial process, ef
forts that he says were appropriate
even after he learned that his vice pres
ident faced suspension.
Gobaud said he wasn't ready to
specify what those efforts were, but
later outlined them to The Daily.
He said he had begun talking to ad
ministrators who work in or oversee the
Office of Judicial Affairs since the
spring and continued after learning
about de la Torre's case regarding
ideas to modify the judicial process.
One, he said, is to change the current
practice of assigning the same judicial
adviser to the "complaining party"
say, a professor or T.A. and the re
sponding student, which, he said, risks
confidentiality breaches.
The other idea, he said, is creating a
resource outside of the office to help
students through the "inherently stress
ful" judicial process.
Gobaud said he sent an e-mail to
President Hennessy, Provost
Etchemendy and Vice Provost Board
man shortly after de la Torre's public
announcement, both explaining the sit
uation and discussing his ideas.
He also called a meeting in early fall
between some Senate and Graduate
Student Council (GSC) members at his
Munger apartment to discuss the
Board of Judicial Affairs nominee issue
that spurred weeks of disagreement in
student government. There, too, he said
he discussed his ideas for judicial
changes.
At Tuesday's meeting, Senator
Zachaiy Wanna 'll, who is also The
Daily's columns editor, asked Gobaud,
"You did not see how involving legisla
tive bodies in a push against the Office
of Judicial Affairs just as your number
two is being reviewed under Judicial
Affairs, how that comes off as circum
spect?"
Gobaud said the meeting was to dis
cuss the board matter, not the office.
The Senate unanimously approved
Andy Parker 'll as Gobaud's nominee
to replace de la Torre as vice president.

Originally published on Dec. 2,2009.

In an incident called "profoundly
regrettable" by the vice provost for stu
dent affairs, student body president
David Gobaud learned that his run
ning mate, former vice president Jay de
la Torre, faced possible suspension for a
suspected Honor Code violation only
after he was mistakenly handed de la
Torre's case file late this summer in the
Judicial Affairs office, where he was
serving as a panelist on another case.
The claim, confirmed by top Uni
versity officials and de la Torre 'lO, has
raised questions about how the Office
of Judicial Affairs protects students'
privacy, as well as communication be
tween de la Torre and Gobaud 'OB, M.S.
'lO before and after their election, and
Gobaud's efforts as president to en
courage reform to parts of the judicial
process efforts that he says were ap
propriate even after he learned that his
vice president was in the Judicial Af
fairs process.
Gobaud offered the explanation
last Friday in response to questions
about when he learned that his vice
president was alleged to have plagia
rized code in a computer science class
last fall an Honor Code violation
whose standard penalty is a quarter
long suspension and 40 hours of com
munity service. De la Torre was found
responsible of the violation by a Judi
cial Affairs panel, received the stan
dard penalty, appealed it and was de
nied at a final hearing earlier this quar
ter. He resigned at a Nov. 11 meeting
with student leaders and President
Hennessy, and explained his suspen
sion in a public statement the next day.
"I was shocked," Gobaud said
about the day in late summer when, he
said, a Judicial Affairs staff member
mistakenly handed him the wrong case
file. He said when he opened it and saw
de la Torre's name on the paperwork,
"my jaw dropped. The person who
handed it to me, it was obviously like,
'Wait a minute.' I was like.'l don't think
I should have this.' She took it back."
Several top University officials have
responded to the mistake that appar
ently tipped Gobaud off to his vice
president's case, which, like all Judicial
Affairs cases, is promised in the Uni
versity's 1997 student judicial charter to

be kept confidential by the office.
"It is clear that multiple parties
made mistakes," said University Presi
dent John Hennessy in an e-mail to The
Daily, although he stopped short of
naming those parties.
Provost John Etchemendy called it
"a less serious mistake than if [the of
fice] lost the file, handed it to somebody
who wasn't on a panel," but said the in
cident was still "a serious mistake."
"I am aware that an extremely un
fortunate error occurred when David,
as a judicial affairs panelist, was given
the wrong file in preparation for a hear
ing during the summer," said Vice
Provost for Student Affairs Greg
Boardman in an e-mail to The Daily.
"As you know, confidentiality in the ju
dicial process is, and always has been, of
utmost importance, and this mistake,
while clearly unintentional, is pro
foundly regrettable."
Gobaud has gone to lengths to ex
plain the constraints he faced after
learning about the case, noting that
when he became a judicial affairs pan
elist last fall, he signed the standard
confidentiality agreement saying that
"information regarding any student's
disciplinary status is not to be discussed
with anyone... outside the judicial hear
ing without the written authorization
of the student."
Gobaud said that agreement meant
he could only seek advice about the in
cident from Judicial Affairs staff mem
bers and the associate vice provost who
oversees Judicial Affairs, Christine
Griffith. Griffith told The Daily that
panelists are expected to take their
concerns to office staff Gobaud said he
believed he could not take the issue to
any other administrators.
The day he saw the case file, Gob
aud said, "Jay and I talked, and he told
me about his case."
"David sat down with me because
he was suspicious something was up,
and I told him about my situation," de
la Torre said in an e-mail to The Daily.
The two said they then started planning
a transition for after de la Torre's resig
nation, which took place some two
months later.
"[Gobaud] was a good friend and
respected my privacy, so he didn't dis
cuss the situation with anyone I wasn't
comfortable sharing it with," de la
Torre said. Gobaud maintains he
would have faced a Fundamental Stan
dard violation charge if he told anyone
else about the case.
Confidentiality, Reexamined
Griffith sat down with The Daily
and acknowledged that the mistake has
prompted a review of confidentiality
protocol in the Office of Judicial Af
fairs.
"I think given the weight of that re
sponsibility that we feel in terms of con
fidentiality that's the highest charge
we have in the office, no question," she
said. "Given how seriously we take that
responsibility, sure, it's huge when
there's a human error."
She described the review process
prompted by this summer's incident,
the likes of which have never, to her
knowledge, happened before.
"We review what our protocols are,
we try to determine, are there ways we
can implement better protocols? And
then we just reiterate the need [to staff]
to continue to be as committed to that
part of our work as we always have
been," Griffith said.
She said there have been no major
protocol changes, but two practices
have been reemphasized. One is requir
ing panelists to sign a confidentiality
agreement, as Gobaud did.
"The fact that they agree when they
volunteer to serve in this capacity to
keep all information confidential is a
big part of what we do," Griffith said.
The second practice is the electronic
document system the office switched to
earlier this summer, which allows pan
elists to access case files on a secure
server. Griffith said the system "serves
us well." Panelists can still request hard
copies of case files, as Gobaud did for
the case file he was supposed to pick up
that day.
Jamie Pontius-Hogan, a judicial ad
viser who works in the office, explained
the protocol for picking up file in per
son.
"We provided a kind of sealed enve
lope and they [the panelist] would walk
into the front desk," she said. "The per
son sitting at the front desk would say,
you know, 'I need to see your ID,' and
they'd sign the little sign-out form and
sign out the form and take the packet."
Despite the fact that someone ap
parently gave Gobaud the wrong case
file that day, Griffith said she is confi
dent about efforts to protect students'
privacy as promised in the judicial char
ter.
"No, I don't have concerns about
students' privacy being at risk," Griffith

said. "I have all the confidence that
we're doing everything we possibly can
to ensure that we don't have a repeat."
Yetting de la Torre
Gobaud and de la Torre have both
offered descriptions of their communi
cation before and after their election,
and de la Torre has explained why de
spite facing a possible suspension be
cause of the plagiarism claim against
him, he still ran.
"At the end of the day, I just wanted
to help people," de la Torre wrote in an
e-mail to The Daily. "I always saw Stan
ford as this safe, perfect space. The sto
ries I heard about students with mental
health challenges feeling alone and sto
ries [of] girls getting raped really got to
me, and I wanted to do something
about it.
"I've sat down and thought about
whether or not running and staying de
spite everything I was going through
was the right decision," he added, "and
I'm still struggling with that."
He told The Daily three weeks ago,
"I thought if I made my case ex

aud said, "Jay and I talked, and he told
me about his case."
"David sat down with me because
he was suspicious something was up,
and I told him about my situation," de
la Torre said in an e-mail to The Daily.
The two said they then started planning
a transition for after de la Torre's resig
nation, which took place some two
months later.
"[Gobaud] was a good friend and
respected my privacy, so he didn't dis
cuss the situation with anyone I wasn't
comfortable sharing it with," de la
Torre said. Gobaud maintains he
would have faced a Fundamental Stan
dard violation charge if he told anyone
else about the case.
Confidentiality, Reexamined
Griffith sat down with The Daily
and acknowledged that the mistake has
prompted a review of confidentiality
protocol in the Office of Judicial Af
fairs.
"I think given the weight of that re
sponsibility that we feel in terms of con
fidentiality that's the highest charge
we have in the office, no question," she
said. "Given how seriously we take that
responsibility, sure, it's huge when
there's a human error."
She described the review process
prompted by this summer's incident,
the likes of which have never, to her
knowledge, happened before.
"We review what our protocols are,
we try to determine, are there ways we
can implement better protocols? And
then we just reiterate the need [to staff]
to continue to be as committed to that
part of our work as we always have
been," Griffith said.
She said there have been no major
protocol changes, but two practices
have been reemphasized. One is requir
ing panelists to sign a confidentiality
agreement, as Gobaud did.
"The fact that they agree when they
volunteer to serve in this capacity to
keep all information confidential is a
big part of what we do," Griffith said.
The second practice is the electronic
document system the office switched to
earlier this summer, which allows pan
elists to access case files on a secure
server. Griffith said the system "serves
us well." Panelists can still request hard
copies of case files, as Gobaud did for
the case file he was supposed to pick up
that day.
Jamie Pontius-Hogan, a judicial ad
viser who works in the office, explained
the protocol for picking up file in per
son.
"We provided a kind of sealed enve
lope and they [the panelist] would walk
into the front desk," she said. "The per
son sitting at the front desk would say,
you know, 'I need to see your ID,' and
they'd sign the little sign-out form and
sign out the form and take the packet."
Despite the fact that someone ap
parently gave Gobaud the wrong case
file that day, Griffith said she is confi
dent about efforts to protect students'
privacy as promised in the judicial char
ter.
"No, I don't have concerns about
students' privacy being at risk," Griffith

said. "I have all the confidence that
we're doing everything we possibly can
to ensure that we don't have a repeat."
Yetting de la Torre
Gobaud and de la Torre have both
offered descriptions of their communi
cation before and after their election,
and de la Torre has explained why de
spite facing a possible suspension be
cause of the plagiarism claim against
him, he still ran.
"At the end of the day, I just wanted
to help people," de la Torre wrote in an
e-mail to The Daily. "I always saw Stan
ford as this safe, perfect space. The sto
ries I heard about students with mental
health challenges feeling alone and sto
ries [of] girls getting raped really got to
me, and I wanted to do something
about it.
"I've sat down and thought about
whether or not running and staying de
spite everything I was going through
was the right decision," he added, "and
I'm still struggling with that."
He told The Daily three weeks ago,
"I thought if I made my case ex
pressed my remorse well enough to
the judicial affairs panel, I could miti
gate the consequences. I was very opti
mistic."
Gobaud said that when he was eval
uating de la Torre as a running mate last
year, he did not ask him if he had any
"outstanding judicial affairs." Gobaud
said he did, however, talk extensively
with de la Torre about the time commit
ment necessary for student body exec
utives, and "nothing ever came up that
caused me to have any doubt that he
would be able to fulfill his duty."
At Tuesday's ASSU Undergraduate
Senate meeting, Gobaud also pointed
to the Judicial Affairs language that in
dicated to him it was possible for de la
Torre to delay a suspension.
According to the Judicial Affairs
Penalty Code, "responding students are
responsible for providing convincing
evidence that a suspension would have
an unduly harsh impact for instance,
intense and unavoidable public atten
tion for the Panel's consideration. In
rare instances, a quarter of suspension
may be postponed for a quarter, or at
the most, two quarters."
Senator Alex Katz 'l2 asked, "Is this
the reason, the sole reason, the an
nouncement didn't happen earlier?"
"This is one of the reasons," Gobaud
said. "He might have received an alter
nate sanction."
"Did you really not advise him
against that, telling him that was proba
bly not a reasonable expectation?"
Katz asked.
"I actually did tell him I didn't think
it was possible," Gobaud said.
After an appeal this fall, de la Torre's
suspension remained set for winter

quarter.
Of the 367 cases brought to Judicial
Affairs between 2004 and 2007
most of which were heard, though some
were dropped one has ended with a
reduced penalty after an appeal, ac
cording to statistics on the office's Web
site.
Gobaud's Judicial Reform
Meanwhile, students at Tuesday's
Senate meeting pressed Gobaud on his
efforts as president to encourage re
form to parts of the judicial process, ef
forts that he says were appropriate
even after he learned that his vice pres
ident faced suspension.
Gobaud said he wasn't ready to
specify what those efforts were, but
later outlined them to The Daily.
He said he had begun talking to ad
ministrators who work in or oversee the
Office of Judicial Affairs since the
spring and continued after learning
about de la Torre's case regarding
ideas to modify the judicial process.
One, he said, is to change the current
practice of assigning the same judicial
adviser to the "complaining party"
say, a professor or T.A. and the re
sponding student, which, he said, risks
confidentiality breaches.
The other idea, he said, is creating a
resource outside of the office to help
students through the "inherently stress
ful" judicial process.
Gobaud said he sent an e-mail to
President Hennessy, Provost
Etchemendy and Vice Provost Board
man shortly after de la Torre's public
announcement, both explaining the sit
uation and discussing his ideas.
He also called a meeting in early fall
between some Senate and Graduate
Student Council (GSC) members at his
Munger apartment to discuss the
Board of Judicial Affairs nominee issue
that spurred weeks of disagreement in
student government. There, too, he said
he discussed his ideas for judicial
changes.
At Tuesday's meeting, Senator
Zachaiy Wanna 'll, who is also The
Daily's columns editor, asked Gobaud,
"You did not see how involving legisla
tive bodies in a push against the Office
of Judicial Affairs just as your number
two is being reviewed under Judicial
Affairs, how that comes off as circum
spect?"
Gobaud said the meeting was to dis
cuss the board matter, not the office.
The Senate unanimously approved
Andy Parker 'll as Gobaud's nominee
to replace de la Torre as vice president.
