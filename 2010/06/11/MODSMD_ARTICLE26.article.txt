## EDITORIALS Class of 2010 should consider how they can give back to Stanford

Stanford provides countless opportunities and resources for anyone who
is able to call the University their own. Academic opportunities, access
to real-world opportunities and the ability to travel abroad are just a few
of the many benefits graduating seniors will remember after leaving campus
next month. In light of the invaluable resources and opportunities Stanford
provides, the Editorial Board would like to take this time to suggest that grad
uating members of the Class of 2010 consider what they can do to give back
to the University now that their time as undergrads is almost at an end.
After leaving campus, most members of the Class of 2010 will experience
few occasions outside of reunions and alumni events when they will be able
to spend time on campus and enjoy the atmosphere of the University. One
of the ways Stanford tries to remind our alumni of their time here is through
events like this past weekend's Bay Area Leading Matters. Leading Matters
is a series of 19 events throughout the world that help alumni to reconnect.
As a capstone to most of the events, the Main Quad is simulated in some
form and attendees are almost literally brought back to campus. These
events, like so many of the opportunities provided to alumni, are funded
largely out of what alumni themselves give back to the University. So as
soon-to-be-alumni themselves, the Class of 2010 should consider how giving
back to the University even in small amounts can be of benefit to their
post-undergraduate lives.
The benefits of alumni giving, however, are by no means limited to alum
ni themselves. In order to maintain the University's strong financial aid re
sources, countless student programs and vibrant student community, Stan
ford asks many of us to give back each year, whether it be by writing thank
you letters, engaging with alumni during Reunion Homecoming Weekend or
by calling admitted students to help give them a student perspective on the
campus. Each of these actions, and many more, are ways by which we are
able to help contribute something back to the University.
More formally, The Stanford Fund through The Senior Gift asks each
graduating senior to give a meaningful financial donation to Stanford. The
Stanford Fund itself is an annual fund that is spent down every year on finan
cial aid, academic programming and student life. All seniors have benefited
in some way from one, if not all, of these focus areas, and it makes sense for
those who are able to give something back to go ahead and contribute.
The Editorial Board also thinks that adopting a wider view of "giving
back" or philanthropy would be best for graduating seniors who are able to
contribute in this way. Many seniors, for example, can serve on a college
panel in their city after graduation or can work to strengthen their local
alumni chapter, just to name two of the opportunities available to recent
alumni. Remembering all that Stanford has contributed to our individual
lives and futures, it makes sense for the newest alumni of Stanford to start
thinking early about giving back to their alma mater.
