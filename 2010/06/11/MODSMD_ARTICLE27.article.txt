# Afghanistan still elephant in the room

Exactly a year ago today, this country made a monumental statement by
electing a young junior senator from Illinois, Barack Obama, to be
President of the United States. The president captured our hearts with
promises of change and hope. What set Barack Obama apart from his De
mocratic and Republican rivals was that he was and is a charismatic leader
blessed with the gift of persuasion, and intelligent enough to tackle the mul
titude of problems that face our nation.
But today, many of us are disappointed with the president, not because of
what he has done in the past year, but because of what he has not done. Of
all of the boxes that remain unchecked on President Obama's campaign
promise checklist, perhaps the most disappointing is the task of developing
a new strategy for the war in Afghanistan. As the first year of Mr. Obama's
presidency comes to a close, the circumstances in Afghanistan would be the
same as when he entered office, notwithstanding the increase in violence.
With the deadliest month in the history of the U.S. presence in
Afghanistan concluding this past week, the Editorial Board feels the need to
stress the urgency for developing a viable strategy in Afghanistan. We under
stand that any foreign policy decisions particularly those involving mili
tary actions require a great deal of deliberation, and we do not intend to
rush the president to a decision that would endanger more American sol
diers. However, in a situation as urgent as the one in which America finds
herself, time is a luxury we cannot always afford.
The fact of the matter is simple: This country would not have elected Pres
ident Obama if we did not trust his ability to make decisions under the most
severe pressures. The president has demonstrated his very deliberate and
thoughtful decision-making process, but has chosen to postpone many key de
cisions in order to make a more informed decision. This is certainly not a bad
thing, and if time were a luxury we would be less critical of the president's in
action. But, quite to the contrary, the clock is ticking in Afghanistan, as every
day the president stalls, American troops are dying, terrorists organizations
are growing more audacious and the country is growing more impatient.
For better or worse, President George W. Bush made decisions. Although
most of the country was disapproving of the decisions he made, President
Bush was able to act based on whatever information was available. And al
though his instincts often proved to be mistaken, President Bush demon
strated what we expect of the highest leader in our country: decisiveness. In
this department, Obama still has plenty to learn. There are some issues that
face our nation that deserve our patience on the president's behalf, such as
health care and economic recovery. But the war in Afghanistan has been
going on for over eight years and has shown very little improvement for the
people there, and no greater sense of security for the United States. Quite
frankly, President Obama, our patience is wearing thin.
The Editorial Board does not expect the president to know exactly how
or when this war is going to end. Whatever strategy he pursues may change
tomorrow, and we accept that these circumstances often require an adaptive
attitude. We do not expect President Obama to have all of the answers, but
we do expect him to have a plan. He asked us a year ago to believe in the "au
dacity of hope," but, in the year since, has done little in Afghanistan that
could be considered audacious or hopeful. Every day that our troops remain
in Afghanistan's political limbo is another day they remain in great danger.
The president has the support of Congress, and for now he still maintains
high approval ratings domestically and abroad. So, while President Obama
still has a significant deal of trust and influence, it would appear that today,
not tomorrow, is the time to make a decision on Afghanistan.
