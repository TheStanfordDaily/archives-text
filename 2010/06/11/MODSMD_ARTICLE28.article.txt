# Real human connection enriches the college experience

You have midterms. You are tired. You did not get enough sleep last
night. Your PWR professor expects way too much from you. And
your statistics lecture was incredibly boring today. Yeah, we know.
We also know you are from some dorm on campus and some city in the
world. If you are passionately involved in a campus organization or got so
drunk on Friday you do not even remember it, we probably could have
guessed that, too.
But that doesn't mean we know you. And neither do most of the 200 other
people you have had that conversation with this week. Sure, it's important to
be friendly and sociable making conversation is a life skill that will serve
you well wherever you go, and Stanford students have heard enough about
the value of making "connections."
But what the Editorial Board does feel needs reiteration is what develop
ing relationships with people is really about: quality over quantity.
Unfortunately, some of the basic staples of life at Stanford seem to stand
in the way of this quest at times. For one thing, there is the usual excuse: not
enough time. Yes, developing the kinds of bonds we are talking about re
quires free time something Stanford students do not have a lot of. There
is just only so much you can talk about in the fifteen minutes a day between
your problem sets and meetings and classes. But if Stanford students find
time for everything else, surely they could carve out the occasional hour or
two for genuine human interaction. We call this an excuse because we actu
ally do not think it is the problem.
There is one thing close friendships require that Stanford students are not
so good at: failing. In a paradoxical way, our best friendships come not from
our successes, but out of our failures. Allowing ourselves to have vulnerabil
ities and to let other people in on them is the only way to develop the
sense of trust we can fall back on. But Stanford students try to present them
selves as winners, right down to the core. We embrace our vulnerabilities
about as much as we wrap ourselves around porcupines. In this select popu
lation of super-achievers, being human does not seem good enough. And so
often, we pretend we are beyond it.
In the absence of the bravery necessary to put our real selves out there,
for better or for worse, we resort to the same old conversations about the
things you are "supposed" to be stressed about. We think we are bonding
over difficult times by flaunting our struggles against the traditional badges
of worry: midterms, papers or lack of sleep. But when bigger issues like
the kinds people face in the real world come up, they seem out of place
and embarrassing. And so, students keep them hidden, sometimes even from
their close friends and roommates.
In this way the Stanford duck syndrome is not so much about pretending
we are not stressed as it is about limiting the things we reveal to others to ac
ceptable forms of anxiety. But this superficial form of relating gets us
nowhere in terms of creating real bonds with others. Only when we let our
selves fall do we give people the opportunity to lift us back on our feet. Those
are the people we call our best friends.
From the perspective of the Editorial Board, creating authentic and last
ing bonds with others is a vital yet all too often overlooked aspect of college
life, and one which students may later regret not fulfilling.
