As special fees legislation hits the headlines, the special fees refund
process -begins to rear its ugly head. Each quarter, students are al
lowed to apply for a refund from programs that they do not agree
with, do not receive a benefit from or think are ineffective. This is what the
refund program was created to do. Like many good ideas, however, the re
fund process has been corrupted by those taking advantage of the system.
The majority of those who request special fees refunds appear to do so sim
ply to get the money.
Refund rates for special fees groups range from 9.6 percent to 18.5 per
cent, the average being around 16 percent. This amounts to a total of
$115,794 for the winter quarter, up from last quarter's total of $79,604. This
quarter's total of 1,132 refund requests marks the highest number of stu
dents asking for refunds in the last three years. The number of students ask
ing for full refunds also hit a three-year high with 379 requests. With over a
third of refund-recipients refusing to support any special fees group, it ap
pears that many students simply do not feel the need to contribute to cam
pus organizations, and would rather just keep the money for themselves.
A gaping hole in the process, however, is that it is often difficult to pre
vent students who have taken refunds from utilizing the same services they
declined to support. Groups have the option of denying service to those stu
dents who requested refunds, but when only a list of SUID's of those asking
for refunds is published, there is no way for groups to know the names of stu
dents who received a refund from their budgets. Without real repercussions,
abuse of the refund process is sure to continue. It is highly improbable that
any student disagrees with every special fees group on campus, and never de
rives benefits from any such group.
The Editorial Board urges the ASSU to consider and explore other op
tions to the current special fees refund process. One simple way to curb the
refund amount is to cut the window for refund application down from three
weeks to one week. Also, the refund could be made to the party paying the
University Bill, bypassing the student's hand directly and removing the mo
tive of quick easy cash in order to make the student consider the choices
made in asking for specific group refunds. The best option would most like
ly be to make the refund payment fit a graduated scale. In this scenario, stu
dents would have to rank the special fees groups by refund request. The first
choice receiving a 100 percent refund, the second 80 percent and so on.
Whatever changes are made to the refund process, the greatest need is in
making sure that there are repercussions for taking a refund. In the current
system, the student stands to gain without the risk of loss. The special fees
groups, on the other hand, remain the perpetual loser. Let us not, as Stanford
students, forget the value of these organizations to our campus, our commu
nity and our diversity.
Stanford is a community, a marketplace of ideas and services. The idea
that students and groups work together to promote campus diversity bene
fits every student in equal yet different ways. Unless the refund process is re
formed, it will remain the source of easy cash for the cynical and thoughtless.
And the campus as a whole will pay the real price.
