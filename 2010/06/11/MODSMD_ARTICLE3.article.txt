# Petition sparks divestment debate

Originally published on May 7,2010.

A years-old debate is rising again regarding stu
dent efforts to lobby the University to divest from
companies thought to be contributing to human
rights violations in Israel.
Students supporting divestment and students
proposing investment in human aid projects in the
region have organized campaigns whose public
presence has grown visibly over the last week, fueled
by a potential ASSU bill and a flyer campaign. The
debate recalls past battles over divestment at Stan
ford one decades ago against apartheid in South
Africa and another three years ago, when the Un
dergraduate Senate voted on but failed to pass a bill
asking the University trustees to reevaluate Stan
ford's investment choices.

Senate Dissolution Postponed
On Tuesday, the Senate voted down a bill that
would dissolve the current Senate on May 11 to
make way for the senators-elect, effectively post
poning the transfer of office until the eighth week of
the quarter, two weeks behind schedule.
Although senators cited reasons such as finaliza

tion of appropriations transfers, a green events
checklist and an ethics bills as rationales for post
poning the switch, Senator Mohammad Ali 'lO
called the postponement mere "political theater"
and said the real reason for waiting was to avoid let
ting the new Senate vote on a potential divestment
bill.
As dictated by its bylaws, the Senate is required
to wait a week before passing new legislation, and
since the Senate is not required to meet past the
ninth week of the quarter, the postponement of dis
solution bars the incoming Senate from passing any
legislation before the end of the academic year.
Although no divestment bill has actually been
authored, organizers of Campaign Restore Hope
(CRH), a campaign for divestment from four specif
ic companies in the region, have made their inten
tions clear by distributing petitions to many dorms
on campus.
The petition asked students to write a sentence of
support for the initiative and to deliver the petition
to their "dorm representative or RA." Its listed goals
included "[passing] an ASSU bill urging our Univer
sity to disinvest from these companies." The petition
also lists four specific companies two Israeli, one
Egyptian and one Palestinian, according to Fadi
Quran TO, a CRH organizer.
Quran said CRH hopes to introduce a bill to the

incoming Senate. He characterized the senators
elect as more likely to pass the bill than the current
Senate, calling current senators "more isolationist,"
or more likely to deal strictly with campus issues.
"I think most of the incoming senators truly care
about human rights issues, and I think they'll proba
bly support the bill," Quran said.
Ali, also an organizer for CRH, said the Senate
may also want to delay legislation until next year be
cause many of the original organizers of the 2007 di
vestment bill will then have graduated. He ex
pressed concern about the connection between
postponing dissolution and a pending bill.
"Connecting a potential divestment bill with
postponing the Senate dissolution is unethical," Ali
said. "Making the incoming senators wait to start
their term denies them experience and is putting
them at a severe disadvantage."

Two Campaigns Develop
After the Senate's decision on Tuesday not to dis
solve on May 11, it remains unclear if CRH will con
tinue to press for a Senate bill encouraging the Uni
versity to reevaluate its investments.
"We haven't made our final decision yet," Quran
said on Thursday. "The most important thing in the
next four weeks is educating the cam
pus on our goals and proposed solu
tions."
In the meantime, Invest for Peace
(IFP), a student coalition with ties to
Stanford Israel Alliance (SIA), has
begun a campaign to encourage stu
dents to support on-the-ground relief
in the region. IFP created a blog and a
Facebook page earlier this week. CRH
has a similar Web presence.
CRH's goals, as explained on its
website and petitions, include three ef
forts: educating the University on the
issue to increase dialogue, ensuring the
University is not aiding companies that
are committing human rights violations
and developing "new creative ways to
help end this conflict."
In addition to distributing petitions
to residences earlier this week, CRH
held a teach-in on Thursday evening in
Toyon Hall part of the coalition's
education-outreach effort.
CRH has also expressed plans to
present a research document to Stan
ford's Advisory Panel on Investment
Responsibility (APIR), a board that
advises the University trustees on in
vestment choices.
On Monday, Quran said CRH
planned to present a document some
time "in the next one or two weeks"
with research information about com
panies that potentially were violating
human rights. He said on Thursday,
however, that CRH's plans have been
changing rapidly in the past week as
the situation evolves.
CRH is also expanding the number
of companies it is researching beyond
the four specified in the petition.
Ali said on Monday that CRH was
"more hopeful" about making
progress with APIR, and called the
possibility of a Senate bill passage a
more "symbolic" action.
IFP's goals also include educating
the University on the subject, as well as
channeling discussion "toward effec

tive action" and inspiring students to
support on-the-ground efforts in the
area. IFP is co-sponsoring Challah for
Hunger this week, and its next goal is to
raise $l,OOO by next week for relief ef
forts.
IFP organizer Yishai Kabaker 'lO
said IFP works to "guide people to do
nate for the cause," characterizing the
campaign as "grassroots."
"We don't think we need to go
through the ASSU," he said.
IFP expressed concern with CRH's
petition, saying the research points for
some of the companies were not prop
erly substantiated through the citations
provided.
Kabaker said while IFP supports
CRH's efforts to increase dialogue and
awareness of the issue, "IFP is funda
mentally opposed to divestment, which
is part of Campaign Restore Hope's
goals."
Quran, however, called any official
action to disinvest from possible
human rights violations "may be just
symbolic, but still important."
"If you can give 50,000 students
hope, that's a miracle," he said. "The
only thing [CRH cares] about is ending
human rights violations."
Divestment and Universities Collide
It's not a new phenomenon for uni
versities to take a stance on interna
tional issues through divestment. In
1977, Stanford divested from compa
nies in South Africa in a show of soli
darity against apartheid, and again in
2005 from companies invested in
Sudan.
In 2007, a divestment bill pushed by
Omar Shakir 'O7, then president of Stu
dents Confronting Apartheid in Israel
(SCAI), made it to a vote in the Senate,
but failed to pass. Five senators voted in
favor, three voted against and five ab
stained from voting on a bill that en
couraged the University trustees to
reevaluate Stanford's investment
choices in Israel. The bill did not pass
because it did not gain the necessary
two-thirds majority vote.
"[The 2007 divestment bill] effec
tively dominated Senate discussion for
four or five weeks and put any other
agenda on hold," said Senate Parlia
mentarian Alex Katz 'l2.
In April, UC-Berkeley's student
government also voted on a bill urging
the school to divest from two contrac
tors with the Israeli military. The de
bate sparked intense debate on the
campus and attracted media attention
nationwide. The student senate voted
16-4 in favor of the bill.

"Berkeley's [pro-divestment] cam
paign had good goals in mind but did
n't consider how emotional the subject
is, which made the situation worse,"
Quran said, noting that CRH hopes to

make discussion of the issue more
"comfortable" with the campaign's ap
proach.
One senator-elect, Rebecca Sachs
'l3, said she did not think a divestment
bill in the Undergraduate Senate
would meet support "not after the
way it met such resistance at Berke
ley."
"I'm incredibly disturbed and
scared that it's coming up again," she
said. "It's such a divisive issue on cam
pus."
Current senators differ on whether
or not divestment is an issue that the
Senate should consider at all.
"Senate has no mandate to legislate
on this issue," said Senate Chair Varun
Sivaram 'll. "It's not a campus issue, and
there's no clear campus sentiment. The
incoming Senate is 14 new freshman
senators who campaigned on campus
issue advocacy. There's no significance
to passing the bill."
But Ali stressed that a bill's passage
could have symbolic significance that
should not be ignored.
"This has been done before, with
South Africa and Sudan," he said. "The
students have a voice and we're the
most likely group to alter the status
quo."
Larry Diamond, a senior fellow at
the Hoover Institution, weighed in on
the issue, saying he found the issue of di
vestment an "inappropriate" issue for
student government.
"It's extremely divisive," he said. "It's
hurtful to one community either way."
He doubted the University would
take action even if a bill passed the Sen
ate.
"I don't think the University will
agree to divest look at what hap
pened at Cal," he said. "The University
has made it clear that divestment
would only happen rarely and in re
sponse to a clear impetus. It might hap
pen, but in this case, I can't see that it
would."
After the senators-elect were cho
sen in April, Diamond took them to
dinner, during which he discussed the
issue of divestment and put forth an ar
gument that divestment was an inap
propriate strategy in Israel.
"I presented to them thoughts on
divestment and provided a historical
perspective," Diamond said. He held a
similar dinner with senators this time
last year.
"The dinner covered how divest
ment was a compelling and appropriate
strategy for apartheid in South Africa,
but I believe it should be a rare strategy
in this type of situation," Diamond said.
"It's certainly not a one-sided and un
complicated defense of Israel."

make way for the senators-elect, effectively post
poning the transfer of office until the eighth week of
the quarter, two weeks behind schedule.
Although senators cited reasons such as finaliza

tion of appropriations transfers, a green events
checklist and an ethics bills as rationales for post
poning the switch, Senator Mohammad Ali 'lO
called the postponement mere "political theater"
and said the real reason for waiting was to avoid let
ting the new Senate vote on a potential divestment
bill.
As dictated by its bylaws, the Senate is required
to wait a week before passing new legislation, and
since the Senate is not required to meet past the
ninth week of the quarter, the postponement of dis
solution bars the incoming Senate from passing any
legislation before the end of the academic year.
Although no divestment bill has actually been
authored, organizers of Campaign Restore Hope
(CRH), a campaign for divestment from four specif
ic companies in the region, have made their inten
tions clear by distributing petitions to many dorms
on campus.
The petition asked students to write a sentence of
support for the initiative and to deliver the petition
to their "dorm representative or RA." Its listed goals
included "[passing] an ASSU bill urging our Univer
sity to disinvest from these companies." The petition
also lists four specific companies two Israeli, one
Egyptian and one Palestinian, according to Fadi
Quran TO, a CRH organizer.
Quran said CRH hopes to introduce a bill to the

incoming Senate. He characterized the senators
elect as more likely to pass the bill than the current
Senate, calling current senators "more isolationist,"
or more likely to deal strictly with campus issues.
"I think most of the incoming senators truly care
about human rights issues, and I think they'll proba
bly support the bill," Quran said.
Ali, also an organizer for CRH, said the Senate
may also want to delay legislation until next year be
cause many of the original organizers of the 2007 di
vestment bill will then have graduated. He ex
pressed concern about the connection between
postponing dissolution and a pending bill.
"Connecting a potential divestment bill with
postponing the Senate dissolution is unethical," Ali
said. "Making the incoming senators wait to start
their term denies them experience and is putting
them at a severe disadvantage."

Two Campaigns Develop
After the Senate's decision on Tuesday not to dis
solve on May 11, it remains unclear if CRH will con
tinue to press for a Senate bill encouraging the Uni
versity to reevaluate its investments.
"We haven't made our final decision yet," Quran
said on Thursday. "The most important thing in the
next four weeks is educating the cam
pus on our goals and proposed solu
tions."
In the meantime, Invest for Peace
(IFP), a student coalition with ties to
Stanford Israel Alliance (SIA), has
begun a campaign to encourage stu
dents to support on-the-ground relief
in the region. IFP created a blog and a
Facebook page earlier this week. CRH
has a similar Web presence.
CRH's goals, as explained on its
website and petitions, include three ef
forts: educating the University on the
issue to increase dialogue, ensuring the
University is not aiding companies that
are committing human rights violations
and developing "new creative ways to
help end this conflict."
In addition to distributing petitions
to residences earlier this week, CRH
held a teach-in on Thursday evening in
Toyon Hall part of the coalition's
education-outreach effort.
CRH has also expressed plans to
present a research document to Stan
ford's Advisory Panel on Investment
Responsibility (APIR), a board that
advises the University trustees on in
vestment choices.
On Monday, Quran said CRH
planned to present a document some
time "in the next one or two weeks"
with research information about com
panies that potentially were violating
human rights. He said on Thursday,
however, that CRH's plans have been
changing rapidly in the past week as
the situation evolves.
CRH is also expanding the number
of companies it is researching beyond
the four specified in the petition.
Ali said on Monday that CRH was
"more hopeful" about making
progress with APIR, and called the
possibility of a Senate bill passage a
more "symbolic" action.
IFP's goals also include educating
the University on the subject, as well as
channeling discussion "toward effec

tive action" and inspiring students to
support on-the-ground efforts in the
area. IFP is co-sponsoring Challah for
Hunger this week, and its next goal is to
raise $l,OOO by next week for relief ef
forts.
IFP organizer Yishai Kabaker 'lO
said IFP works to "guide people to do
nate for the cause," characterizing the
campaign as "grassroots."
"We don't think we need to go
through the ASSU," he said.
IFP expressed concern with CRH's
petition, saying the research points for
some of the companies were not prop
erly substantiated through the citations
provided.
Kabaker said while IFP supports
CRH's efforts to increase dialogue and
awareness of the issue, "IFP is funda
mentally opposed to divestment, which
is part of Campaign Restore Hope's
goals."
Quran, however, called any official
action to disinvest from possible
human rights violations "may be just
symbolic, but still important."
"If you can give 50,000 students
hope, that's a miracle," he said. "The
only thing [CRH cares] about is ending
human rights violations."
Divestment and Universities Collide
It's not a new phenomenon for uni
versities to take a stance on interna
tional issues through divestment. In
1977, Stanford divested from compa
nies in South Africa in a show of soli
darity against apartheid, and again in
2005 from companies invested in
Sudan.
In 2007, a divestment bill pushed by
Omar Shakir 'O7, then president of Stu
dents Confronting Apartheid in Israel
(SCAI), made it to a vote in the Senate,
but failed to pass. Five senators voted in
favor, three voted against and five ab
stained from voting on a bill that en
couraged the University trustees to
reevaluate Stanford's investment
choices in Israel. The bill did not pass
because it did not gain the necessary
two-thirds majority vote.
"[The 2007 divestment bill] effec
tively dominated Senate discussion for
four or five weeks and put any other
agenda on hold," said Senate Parlia
mentarian Alex Katz 'l2.
In April, UC-Berkeley's student
government also voted on a bill urging
the school to divest from two contrac
tors with the Israeli military. The de
bate sparked intense debate on the
campus and attracted media attention
nationwide. The student senate voted
16-4 in favor of the bill.

"Berkeley's [pro-divestment] cam
paign had good goals in mind but did
n't consider how emotional the subject
is, which made the situation worse,"
Quran said, noting that CRH hopes to

make discussion of the issue more
"comfortable" with the campaign's ap
proach.
One senator-elect, Rebecca Sachs
'l3, said she did not think a divestment
bill in the Undergraduate Senate
would meet support "not after the
way it met such resistance at Berke
ley."
"I'm incredibly disturbed and
scared that it's coming up again," she
said. "It's such a divisive issue on cam
pus."
Current senators differ on whether
or not divestment is an issue that the
Senate should consider at all.
"Senate has no mandate to legislate
on this issue," said Senate Chair Varun
Sivaram 'll. "It's not a campus issue, and
there's no clear campus sentiment. The
incoming Senate is 14 new freshman
senators who campaigned on campus
issue advocacy. There's no significance
to passing the bill."
But Ali stressed that a bill's passage
could have symbolic significance that
should not be ignored.
"This has been done before, with
South Africa and Sudan," he said. "The
students have a voice and we're the
most likely group to alter the status
quo."
Larry Diamond, a senior fellow at
the Hoover Institution, weighed in on
the issue, saying he found the issue of di
vestment an "inappropriate" issue for
student government.
"It's extremely divisive," he said. "It's
hurtful to one community either way."
He doubted the University would
take action even if a bill passed the Sen
ate.
"I don't think the University will
agree to divest look at what hap
pened at Cal," he said. "The University
has made it clear that divestment
would only happen rarely and in re
sponse to a clear impetus. It might hap
pen, but in this case, I can't see that it
would."
After the senators-elect were cho
sen in April, Diamond took them to
dinner, during which he discussed the
issue of divestment and put forth an ar
gument that divestment was an inap
propriate strategy in Israel.
"I presented to them thoughts on
divestment and provided a historical
perspective," Diamond said. He held a
similar dinner with senators this time
last year.
"The dinner covered how divest
ment was a compelling and appropriate
strategy for apartheid in South Africa,
but I believe it should be a rare strategy
in this type of situation," Diamond said.
"It's certainly not a one-sided and un
complicated defense of Israel."

A years-old debate is rising again regarding stu
dent efforts to lobby the University to divest from
companies thought to be contributing to human
rights violations in Israel.
Students supporting divestment and students
proposing investment in human aid projects in the
region have organized campaigns whose public
presence has grown visibly over the last week, fueled
by a potential ASSU bill and a flyer campaign. The
debate recalls past battles over divestment at Stan
ford one decades ago against apartheid in South
Africa and another three years ago, when the Un
dergraduate Senate voted on but failed to pass a bill
asking the University trustees to reevaluate Stan
