A years-old debate is rising again regarding stu
dent efforts to lobby the University to divest from
companies thought to be contributing to human
rights violations in Israel.
Students supporting divestment and students
proposing investment in human aid projects in the
region have organized campaigns whose public
presence has grown visibly over the last week, fueled
by a potential ASSU bill and a flyer campaign. The
debate recalls past battles over divestment at Stan
ford one decades ago against apartheid in South
Africa and another three years ago, when the Un
dergraduate Senate voted on but failed to pass a bill
asking the University trustees to reevaluate Stan
ford's investment choices.

Senate Dissolution Postponed
On Tuesday, the Senate voted down a bill that
would dissolve the current Senate on May 11 to
make way for the senators-elect, effectively post
poning the transfer of office until the eighth week of
the quarter, two weeks behind schedule.
Although senators cited reasons such as finaliza

tion of appropriations transfers, a green events
checklist and an ethics bills as rationales for post
poning the switch, Senator Mohammad Ali 'lO
called the postponement mere "political theater"
and said the real reason for waiting was to avoid let
ting the new Senate vote on a potential divestment
bill.
As dictated by its bylaws, the Senate is required
to wait a week before passing new legislation, and
since the Senate is not required to meet past the
ninth week of the quarter, the postponement of dis
solution bars the incoming Senate from passing any
legislation before the end of the academic year.
Although no divestment bill has actually been
authored, organizers of Campaign Restore Hope
(CRH), a campaign for divestment from four specif
ic companies in the region, have made their inten
tions clear by distributing petitions to many dorms
on campus.
The petition asked students to write a sentence of
support for the initiative and to deliver the petition
to their "dorm representative or RA." Its listed goals
included "[passing] an ASSU bill urging our Univer
sity to disinvest from these companies." The petition
also lists four specific companies two Israeli, one
Egyptian and one Palestinian, according to Fadi
Quran TO, a CRH organizer.
Quran said CRH hopes to introduce a bill to the

incoming Senate. He characterized the senators
elect as more likely to pass the bill than the current
Senate, calling current senators "more isolationist,"
or more likely to deal strictly with campus issues.
"I think most of the incoming senators truly care
about human rights issues, and I think they'll proba
bly support the bill," Quran said.
Ali, also an organizer for CRH, said the Senate
may also want to delay legislation until next year be
cause many of the original organizers of the 2007 di
vestment bill will then have graduated. He ex
pressed concern about the connection between
postponing dissolution and a pending bill.
"Connecting a potential divestment bill with
postponing the Senate dissolution is unethical," Ali
said. "Making the incoming senators wait to start
their term denies them experience and is putting
them at a severe disadvantage."

Two Campaigns Develop
After the Senate's decision on Tuesday not to dis
solve on May 11, it remains unclear if CRH will con
tinue to press for a Senate bill encouraging the Uni
versity to reevaluate its investments.
"We haven't made our final decision yet," Quran
said on Thursday. "The most important thing in the
