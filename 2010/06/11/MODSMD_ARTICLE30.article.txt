# Arizona immigration bill misguided and dangerous

Nearly a week ago, the governor of Arizona signed into law a contro
versial new bill that severely tightens immigration policies in an effort
to make it easier for undocumented visitors in Arizona to be identi
fied and arrested. The Editorial Board believes that this bill is dangerous not
only because it places far too much power in the hands of local police offi
cials in Arizona, but also because it contains no clear guidelines for identify
ing those without legal documentation.
The Arizona bill known as S.B. 1070 requires police in Arizona to
question anyone they suspect of being undocumented, and allows them to
detain suspected undocumented individuals who are unable to provide
proof of legal residence. The bill states that those questioned by police must
make a "reasonable attempt" to verify their immigration status when the
questioning officer feels that there is "reasonable suspicion" to warrant ask
ing them for the information. The vagueness of the bill's language is prob
lematic, and will probably lead to many disputes and law suits later on.
With regards to immigration in America, many believe that current fed
eral legislation and law enforcement does not do enough to maintain our
borders. But despite the failings of current immigration policies, SB 1070
takes things too far by giving Arizona state police officers the right to make
evaluations concerning someone's legal status in the nation, even to the
point of keeping them in detention or having them deported. Immigration
law pertains not only to undocumented immigrants but also to how Ameri
can citizens are treated. Because of the implications that our immigration
policies have on U.S. citizens as a whole whether Arizonans, Californians
or otherwise it makes sense that the federal government would have the
final say regarding immigration policy and enforcement.
It is unclear what will constitute "reasonable suspicion" for questioning a
state resident under the Arizona law, though ethnicity is forbidden to be the
sole basis for questioning. Arizona Governor Jan Brewer, however, has been
unable to define how police will go about identifying undocumented immi
grants by sight. Yet this has not stopped her from ordering training for state
police regarding the standards by which evaluations are to be made in these
incidents. No Arizona state official has publicly released these standards.
To ignore the implications of ethnicity in the framing of the bill is laugh
able. Ignoring ethnicity while conjuring a notion of who may be under "rea
sonable suspicion" is an interesting thought exercise for those who believe
"being undocumented is not a race, it is a crime." Rather than protecting cit
izens through the bill's stated strategy of attrition through enforcement,
some American citizens will find it much more difficult to live without in
creased fear and humiliation.
There is a strong likelihood that the Arizona bill will eventually be ruled
unconstitutional, and the Editorial Board believes this is rightfully so. Cur
rent law does not grant state police the sweeping authority to enforce immi
gration policy federal agents are tasked with this job. State police are not
trained to serve as immigration officials, and therefore cannot be empow
ered to act like them in any state in the U.S. Furthermore, questioning all po
tential undocumented residents with no clear standards regarding what may
arouse "reasonable suspicion" will lead to flagrant abuse of state-sanctioned
power. The possibility that the state of Arizona could have fewer undocu
mented visitors as a result of the bill does not begin to outweigh the legal and
ethical implications of enforcing it.
