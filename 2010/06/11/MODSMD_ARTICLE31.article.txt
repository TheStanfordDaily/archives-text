# Extend energy incentives to student residences

By unveiling a vast $250 million Energy and Climate Plan, Stanford has
demonstrated a firm commitment to sniffing out any way possible to
reduce its carbon footprint. The path mapped out by the Sustainabili
ty and Energy Management Department includes such complex actions as
altering the power grid and using excess heat from cooling certain buildings
to heat others simultaneously. With a 173-page plan detailing its remarkably
meticulous planning, it seems as though the University has thought of every
thing.
The Editorial Board has one more suggestion: away to incentivize ener
gy conservation in dorms. Allowing students or dorm communities to keep a
share of the money they save from reducing energy use would be a powerful
new tool to curb wasteful behaviors.
Such a program would come straight out of the existing Energy Conser
vation Incentive Program, which has given academic departments cash in
centive to monitor their energy use since 2004. The concept for the program
is simple: Academic departments are given an annual electricity budget
based on past consumption. Those departments that exceed their target
must pay the extra cost, while those that reduce their usage keep the savings.
Thus, the costs of electricity fall upon the people who use it.
Unfortunately, the same cannot currently be said of student dorms and
residences. With no individual costs connected to energy use, every student
can consume as much as they want with no consequences while the Univer
sity is faced with the bills. In economics, this situation constitutes a textbook
example of the "tragedy of the commons." The effects of this imbalance are
plainly evident all over campus lights left on in empty rooms, unused ap
pliances needlessly plugged in and various other forms of waste continue
freely and, more importantly, without notice. If students, like academic de
partments, were paid to end these habits, we have no doubt they would stop.
To keep the plan politically feasible, we recommend keeping only the
positive half of the incentives allowing students to keep some of the sav
ings from reducing energy use without making them pay for increases. With
the costs of attending Stanford already so high, we do not think it would be
a good idea to add another one. However, simply rewarding students for
their conservation efforts ought to be enough to prod them into action.
Logistically, the actions necessary to make this idea a reality might pres
ent a challenge. But if a plan to implement the program in one area has al
ready succeeded, it might be possible to extend the effort to dorms.
With the tireless stream of environmental efforts currently at work
throughout the Stanford community, the persistent apathy towards simple
conservation actions in dorms represents an incongruity that must be ad
dressed. It is sad to see the commendable work of so many students need
lessly undone by a few. Ideally, the motivation would come from within each
individual, but in the absence of universal conscientiousness, energy conser
vation incentives must be provided.
