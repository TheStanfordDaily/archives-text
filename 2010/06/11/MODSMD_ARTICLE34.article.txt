## Wittgenstein Is on My Mind

At the end of a wonderful fall quarter
in Oxford, my Oxford tutor (i.e. my
teacher and mentor for the quarter)
recommended a biography to me by Ray
Monk titled "Ludwig Wittgenstein: The
Duty of Genius." Inspired by my time study
ing philosophy at such an ancient institution,
I decided to read about the life of this Cam
bridge philosopher over the break. Now,
everywhere I go and everything I do,
Wittgenstein is on my mind.
As I was visiting some of the more beau
tiful sights on my return to campus, a quota
tion on a wall in MemChu caught my eye
and, of course, made me think of Wittgen
stein. The quote reads: "There is no narrow
ing so deadly as the narrowing of man's hori
zon of spiritual things... No widening of sci
ence, no possession of abstract truth can in
demnify for an enfeebled hold of the highest
and central truths of humanity. 'What shall a
man give in exchange for his soul?'"
In reading those words, I experienced a
halting feeling, as if I and the student
body more generally were being accused.
The lines were probably written with stu
dents in mind, designed to warn against the
supposed dangerous forces within a univer
sity setting that might stamp out the "spiritu

al" and narrow us. Interestingly, I think
Wittgenstein would have echoed this warn
ing, and as I reflect anew on life at Stanford,
I cannot help feeling he had something to
fear.
Wittgenstein is generally not regarded as
religious. A professor told me Wittgenstein
once wrote a friend an exasperated letter
when she sent him a Christmas card because
neither of them was Christian. Yet Wittgen
stein was very spiritual in the sense that he
valued human affectivity, holding a deep ap
preciation for the arts, for moral contempla
tion, and for sensitive human natures. He be
lieved the "darkness of this time" was direct
ly attributable to the worship of the "false
idol of science," and he found these modern
faults even in himself. In moments when he
felt too theoretical or "wise", he felt dead
ened, as if the spirit were being replaced by

machine.
For this reason, Wittgenstein normally
advised his students to leave the world of ac
ademia and become doctors or manual la
borers. He would say there was "no oxygen"
at Cambridge and they could not "breath" in
that setting, as if such a life in its intoler
ance for aspects of the human experience
that cannot be encapsulated by theory
would smother the human being. It was in
the arts and in moral reflection that Wittgen
stein found oxygen and felt human.
Do such reflections have bearing on our
own lives? Is the Stanford bubble oxygen
less? In many ways, Stanford is the reverse: it
is a place that enlivens students, exposing us
to an exciting environment of swarming
thoughts and ideas. But there is also a dead
ening effect inherent in our education. For
example, the undergraduate experience
leaves many students feeling like they are on
a conveyor belt in college, working because
it is what they have always done and are ex
pected to do. They see no point in it, yet they
trudge along.
Furthermore, some students show a lack
of value for the more "poetic" disciplines in
the humanities, perhaps because these fields
cannot be reduced to formulaic method.
