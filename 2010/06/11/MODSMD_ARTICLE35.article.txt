# EDITOR IN CHIEF'S COLUMN
## Editor's farewell: Entering the third wave of change in news 
### Kamil Dada 
News is a basic human desire. People
have an inherent need to know what
occurs beyond their immediate expe
rience.
We need news in order to live, protect
ourselves and form a community. Journalism
is simply the mechanism through which soci
eties produce news. That is why it is impor
tant to care about the news we receive and
the journalism process that occurred to pro
duce that content: to a certain extent, news
influences the quality of our lives, our
thoughts, and our culture.
As I noted in my welcome column at the
start of the volume, any participatory demo
cratic community benefits if its citizens en
gage in an interactive conversation with each
other and examine how the media carries out
its role in society.
Throughout my six months as editor in
chief, I tried to engage the community and
give them space in The Daily. This is an area I
feel strongly about and so made it the overall
focus of my volume, I solicited and published
as many op-eds, guest columns and letters to
the editor as possible. But that was not
enough to give the community a voice. So,
upon getting elected to office, I personally
designed, programmed and launched a new
version of our website. The previous iteration
was slow and unreliable, which was often a
source of frustration for the staff and com
munity at large. Often the news was simply
unavailable to those who wished to read it in
an online format. The new site allows for far
greater citizen participation. Readers can
send in photos and videos, vote in our online
polls and start a conversation by comment
ing on our articles. Consequently, the website
increased community engagement and
helped prepare The Daily for a digital future.
Indeed, apart from citizen interaction,
one topic of discussion that came up repeat
edly during my volume was the long-term
sustainability of the newspaper industry. Ad
vertising and overall revenues are down,
while readership and faith in the printed
media as a reliable, up-to-date source of in
formation is declining. The industry is under
attack as readers are increasingly moving to
the Internet as their sole source of informa
tion. However, perhaps this means that the
medium through which we receive news and
information is evolving. This is certainly not
the first time the system has gone through
significant change. Indeed, it has happened
every time there is a period of social, eco
nomic, or technological development. The
birth of the telegraph in 1830s, the drop in
prices of paper and the influx of immigrants
in the 1880s was perhaps the first such wave.
The invention of radio in the 1920s and the
subsequent rise of the television was another
wave. More recently, the invention of com
puters, the Internet and smartphones have
allowed us to create and receive information
at a rate that was impossible only a few
decades ago. Perhaps then, this is simply the
third wave of change.

We can look to these challenging times as
an opportunity to overhaul our entire media
and news delivery system and move toward
formats and courses of action that will serve
the informational needs of complex and di
verse communities. Much more important
than the medium through which the news is
delivered, is quality of the news, survival of
democracy-sustaining journalism.
In this transitory phase, one of the most
profound questions our democratic system
must consider is whether an independent,
printed press should survive. At Stanford,
this depends on whether student reporters
have the conviction to articulate what a
printed newspaper is able to provide, and
whether, as citizens, the rest of us continue to
believe in its value.

The Daily has come a long way since the
Stanford police rifled through the newspa
per's filing cabinet in the spring of 1971. The
incident sparked a lawsuit over law enforce
ment's right to search the newsroom that
went all the way to the Supreme Court and
led to the paper's independence in 1973.
Newly incorporated as a nonprofit corpora
tion, The Daily went through a great deal of
change and faced a number of difficulties in
its first few years. With the increasing move
to online-only content. The Daily is facing
another perhaps as significant, but subtler,
challenge that threatens to fundamentally
change the way the organization is run.
Where it will go from here is yet to be seen,
but I hope that regardless of its medium, the
organization will be continue its core mission
of providing high quality, timely news to the
community in an easily accessible manner.
Working for The Daily and serving you, the
community, has truly been a privilege and a
tremendously fulfilling experience through
which I learned a great deal. I know that to
gether, we made a number of strides this vol
ume and am looking forward to the upcoming
volume with tremendous eagerness. I sincere
ly hope you enjoyed our coverage and contin
ue to interact with The Daily.

All the best,
