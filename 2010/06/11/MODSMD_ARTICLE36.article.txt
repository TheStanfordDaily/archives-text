Sometimes, I don't know how I feel
about being an American.
Scratch that. Before you jump down my
throat, let me rephrase: Sometimes, I don't
know how I feel about being an American
abroad.
In Barcelona, Americans are infamous
for roaming about in packs and drinking
their way through the semester. Clubs
boost their weeknight business by holding
what amount to glorified frat parties with
drinks that cost ten dollars. Hotels in the
area have blacklists of certain (most)
abroad programs that may not frequent
their establishments for fear of noise com
plaints and property damage.
So, where does that leave Stanford, you
might ask? Surely our abroad offerings are
immune to such unpleasantries? I'm not so
sure.
Let's start with a place called George
Payne's. It falls into the large category of
"Irish Pubs" that dot the world over. While
other European peoples have a spat of in
stitutes named after famous authors dedi
cated to spreading their respective cultures
the Spanish Instituto Cervantes, the
Catalan Institut Ramon Llull and the
British Council all come to mind the
Irish have chosen pubs. Specifically, pubs
selling Guiness. After all, it's both delicious
and it sports the harp from the Irish coat of
arms as its logo (just backwards). As such,
Irish pubs work like embassies for the
country/brewery, and, accordingly, step
ping into such a place means entering a
space with different laws. They are special
spaces in limbo, where foreign things are
allowed to flourish. Like NFL games,
chicken wings and beer by the pitcher. Also
karaoke.
My Sunday night was full of all these
things, and by the time it was over, it felt
like I'd finally been able to find and scratch
an itch that had eluded me for weeks. You
never escape where you come from, so an
occasional reminder is always welcome
even if it comes to you in a pub with no af
filiation to your country.
But what if the reminder isn't occasion
al? What if all that your time abroad

amounts to is a constant stream of finding
ways to feel like you never left America? It
means you're wasting your time. Extending
the simile above into a metaphor, who
wants to hang out with the scabby loser
who scratched too much?
You wouldn't be alone, though.
I greatly admire the abroad offerings
that Stanford has been able to assemble
over the years, and the time and money
given by the Bings to help with the process
is remarkable. What I do wonder is
whether maybe, in our rush to make these
overseas campuses accessible and inviting,
we as a university are losing something of
the point in studying abroad.
A night or two before my stop over at
George Payne's, I went out with a group of
Stanford students visiting from Madrid. It
was nice in a lot of respects I could talk
about which dorms I'd lived in, dining halls
I'd frequented, who I hung out with at
school and people knew what I meant. I
didn't even have to spell the name of my a
cappella group for them to know to which
one I was referring (I'll admit, "Mendi
cant" is not a supremely common word, so
no surprise there). All of that hadn't hap
pened in a long while, but as much as I en
joyed it, I was worried when I looked
around me as the gleaming film of a bubble
began to form.
How much do we really gain if all we do
is trasladar our Stanford experience to an
other site, without changing anything
about how we act? Being abroad should
force us to almost drown in a new culture
before we manage to pull our heads above
water and suck in some air. The awkward,
unpleasant moments, the embarrassing
misunderstandings (yeah, you knew em
barazada meant pregnant, not embar
rassed, but did you know preservative)
means condom, not, you know, preserva
tive?), the infuriating absence of the famil
iar, it's all just the warts of a new place com
ing into view. Airbrushing them out just
makes it cheaper. Plus, it leads to an un
healthy body image for countries every-
where.
Before the hypocrite bell starts
ringing, dear reader, let me assure
you that I know I am no saint in this.
Seeing my fellow classmates in
their non-native environs just made
it all to clear what I want to avoid
what we should all want to
avoid. It isn't on the program, alfin
y al cabo , but on us.

Patrick Kozey is only embarassed by
40 percent of daily interactions now.
If he gets it down to 30 percent, he
might make himself some chicken
wings. Send recipes or threatening
letters to pkozey@stanford.edu.
