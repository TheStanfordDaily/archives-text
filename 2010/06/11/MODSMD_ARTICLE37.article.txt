## A HOUSE DIVIDED: THE STANFORD-CAL FAMILY

Given that the tree and
the bear are natural en
emies, what happens
when the two are bred
of the same blood?
As Big Game day nears, such is
the dilemma of families across the
country. Despite the irony of the sit
uation, it is not uncommon for fami
lies to boast split allegiances to Stan
ford and Cal, especially in the Bay
Area.

Charbel Farhat, professor and
chairman of Stanford's Department
of Aeronautics and Astronautics,
graduated from UC-Berkeley and
married a Cal alumna. To further
complicate matters, his daughter
Alix Farhat 'l3 is a freshman on the
Stanford cheer squad.
"As much as I speak very favor
ably of Cal, I have to say that my al
legiances are with Stanford now,"
Charbel said. "I'm a faculty here, I
work with the students here, I'll be
sitting in the Stanford section, and
now my daughter is on the cheer
leading team, so you can't expect me
to be cheering for Cal."
This year, Charbel and his wife
intend to find an alternative solution
to their family's unique schisms
designing their very own Big Game
attire.
"They're going to be making two
shirts," Alix explained. "On one of
them, it's going to say 'my money, my
education, etc.' and the other is
going to have a Stanford-Cal check
list, so it'll be like, 'I graduated from:
Cal. My husband teaches at: Stan
ford. Our money went to: Cal and
Stanford. My daughter cheers at:
Stanford.'"

The clash of the primary colors
Stanford cardinal red versus Cal
blue and yellow plays out not
only in parent-offspring relation
ships, but also between siblings.
According to sisters Tamara
Alexander 'lO and Taleen Alexan
der, who graduated from Cal in

2007, Stanford-Cal competition
hardly afflicts their relationship.
Even so, Big Game introduces
minor logistical issues.
"When it's Big Game week,
we're always like, 'Where are our
parents going to sit?'" Tamara
laughed. "Before, when Cal was bet
ter at football, [our parents] were
like, 'We're going to sit on the Cal
side,' and this year they're like,
'We're going to sit on the Stanford
side.'"
"I don't think there's much ten
sion between us," she continued.
"It's more of a joke, but I do have a
'Cal Sucks' shirt and [Taleen] gets
mad when I wear it."
The dividing line between Stan
ford and Cal is not so clear-cut in all
families. Sometimes, Big Game ri
valry extends beyond the immediate
family of parents, children and sib
lings.
Take Matt Caselli 'O7. Almost
everyone in his family belongs to ei
ther the tree or bear lineage. His
mom, sister (Features desk editor
Caroline Caselli), aunt, uncle and
several cousins attended Stanford.
His dad, uncle and two great-grand
parents graduated from Cal. His
grandmother is an alumna at both
schools.
What's more, Matt lived in
Alameda throughout his childhood,
a 15-minute drive from Berkeley.
"I more or less grew up a Cal
fan," he recalled. "I remember sort
of being confused as a kid, more at
basketball games than at football
games, because [my parents] would
dress me up, and I'd be wearing a
Stanford sweatshirt and a Cal hat.
All sorts of people would be yelling
at me, but it was a healthy competi
tion and a healthy rivalry. It never
got nasty."
Now two years out of college.
Matt looks forward to avenging
Stanford's six losses out of the past
seven Big Games.
"During my four years at Stan
ford, I never got to see us win Big
Game, so I'm glad to see the success
es right now," he said. "I can finally
