Ingrid Bergman said that a kiss
is a lovely trick designed by na
ture to stop speech when words
become superfluous. At Stan
ford, our renowned kissing fes
tival of Full Moon on the Quad
(FMOTQ) is a lovely trick designed
by seniors to welcome freshmen to
the Farm. Or, at least that's how it
started out.
According to CosmoGIRL! Mag
azine, FMOTQ is now Stanford's
"Claim to Fame." But how did the in
nocent rite of passage transform from
a sweet initiation of freshmen to the
University-sanctioned free-for-all
make-out extravaganza it has be

come?
And We'll Kiss By the Light of the
Moon
According to legend, it all started
in the late 19th century: In order to
become a true Stanford man or
woman, a freshman had to kiss a sen
ior in the Quad under the light of the
academic year's first full moon. Se
niors filed in one line, freshmen in an
other, and, as the tradition goes, the
lines would converge at the stroke of
midnight. The seniors would bestow
roses and plant kisses on the lips of
the freshmen, and with that, the
freshmen were truly initiated to the
Farm.

"To me, it was sort of in the pan
theon of these somewhat quaint
Stanford traditions that everyone
knew happened," said Mathew No

sanchuk ('B7). "It seems like the
mores have evolved. Now I've heard
it's a make-out session."
A Kiss to Build a Dream On
FMOTQ always had a place in
Stanford history, but its formality
waxed and waned over the years. It
began as one of Stanford's many un
official rituals like Primal Scream and
fountain hopping, but was nowhere
close to the headline-grabbing Octo
ber saliva fest it has become.
In 1980, there was FMOTQ on a
balmy night in spring quarter.
"I went to one Full Moon on the
Quad where we held a sit-down din
ner in the spring of my senior year,"
Angela Howell ('80) remembered.
"At this party, there were many, many
tables in the quad. We danced and in
cluded the full moon ritual kiss. I
know it was fun!"
Throughout the 1980s, propriety
and organization were thrown out
the window and FMOTQ became a
sort of fly-by-night student ritual that
existed but wasn't too well publi
cized. That is, until students of the
Class of 1989 took matters into their
own hands.
In 1988, Julie Lythcott-Haims
('B9) and Preston Hammer ('B9),
then class presidents, "classed up"
FMOTQ.
"Over the years, there was nothing
really organized about it," Hammer

remembered. "When I went for the
first time, it was a sort of awkward
quagmire of people milling about ."
Preston, an entrepreneurial un
dergraduate who started Sigma Nu's
Stanford chapter, decided to shoot
for the moon and make FMOTQ
swanky. Jay Gatsby would have been
proud. Long linen-topped tables
were placed in front of MemChu,
with balloons hovering at the ends.
Champagne flowed from six cham
pagne fountains as the Stanford or
chestra serenaded the assembled
guests.
2003: Kiss of Death for FMOTQ?
But the classy aura of 1989 fell
away as FMOTQ became more rau
cous and reported instances of sexual
assault and alcohol-related incidents
skyrocketed. It became so raunchy, in
fact, that officials began providing
mouthwash and condoms. But in 2003,
the carousing went too far and the tra
dition almost collapsed forever.
That year, four students were
rushed to the hospital for alcohol-re
lated injuries, one student was
slapped with a DUI, and another got
arrested for public drunkenness after
the annual lip-locking on the Quad.
Officials wanted to shut down the
event.
