Ingrid Bergman said that a kiss
is a lovely trick designed by na
ture to stop speech when words
become superfluous. At Stan
ford, our renowned kissing fes
tival of Full Moon on the Quad
(FMOTQ) is a lovely trick designed
by seniors to welcome freshmen to
the Farm. Or, at least that's how it
started out.
According to CosmoGIRL! Mag
azine, FMOTQ is now Stanford's
"Claim to Fame." But how did the in
nocent rite of passage transform from
a sweet initiation of freshmen to the
University-sanctioned free-for-all
make-out extravaganza it has be

come?
And We'll Kiss By the Light of the
Moon
According to legend, it all started
in the late 19th century: In order to
become a true Stanford man or
woman, a freshman had to kiss a sen
ior in the Quad under the light of the
academic year's first full moon. Se
niors filed in one line, freshmen in an
other, and, as the tradition goes, the
lines would converge at the stroke of
midnight. The seniors would bestow
roses and plant kisses on the lips of
the freshmen, and with that, the
freshmen were truly initiated to the
Farm.

"To me, it was sort of in the pan
theon of these somewhat quaint
Stanford traditions that everyone
knew happened," said Mathew No

sanchuk ('B7). "It seems like the
mores have evolved. Now I've heard
it's a make-out session."
A Kiss to Build a Dream On
FMOTQ always had a place in
Stanford history, but its formality
waxed and waned over the years. It
began as one of Stanford's many un
official rituals like Primal Scream and
fountain hopping, but was nowhere
close to the headline-grabbing Octo
ber saliva fest it has become.
In 1980, there was FMOTQ on a
balmy night in spring quarter.
"I went to one Full Moon on the
Quad where we held a sit-down din
ner in the spring of my senior year,"
Angela Howell ('80) remembered.
"At this party, there were many, many
tables in the quad. We danced and in
cluded the full moon ritual kiss. I
know it was fun!"
Throughout the 1980s, propriety
and organization were thrown out
the window and FMOTQ became a
sort of fly-by-night student ritual that
existed but wasn't too well publi
cized. That is, until students of the
Class of 1989 took matters into their
own hands.
In 1988, Julie Lythcott-Haims
('B9) and Preston Hammer ('B9),
then class presidents, "classed up"
FMOTQ.
"Over the years, there was nothing
really organized about it," Hammer

remembered. "When I went for the
first time, it was a sort of awkward
quagmire of people milling about ."
Preston, an entrepreneurial un
dergraduate who started Sigma Nu's
Stanford chapter, decided to shoot
for the moon and make FMOTQ
swanky. Jay Gatsby would have been
proud. Long linen-topped tables
were placed in front of MemChu,
with balloons hovering at the ends.
Champagne flowed from six cham
pagne fountains as the Stanford or
chestra serenaded the assembled
guests.
2003: Kiss of Death for FMOTQ?
But the classy aura of 1989 fell
away as FMOTQ became more rau
cous and reported instances of sexual
assault and alcohol-related incidents
skyrocketed. It became so raunchy, in
fact, that officials began providing
mouthwash and condoms. But in 2003,
the carousing went too far and the tra
dition almost collapsed forever.
That year, four students were
rushed to the hospital for alcohol-re
lated injuries, one student was
slapped with a DUI, and another got
arrested for public drunkenness after
the annual lip-locking on the Quad.
Officials wanted to shut down the
event.

At the time, Director of Student
Activities Nanci Howe said she had
"serious reservations about this
event happening again" and moved
to ax the pucker fest. But University
officials feared that students would
moonshine the event, so to speak,
and stage a completely unsanctioned
underground Full Moon, so they al
lowed the tradition to live on.
The saliva-swapping soiree got
more inclusive for the kissing-averse
in 2005, when Full Moon featured a
large-scale stage meant to mimic a
rock concert aura â€”it was com
plete with mounted concert lights
and projection screens showing live
performances.
But with the University curtailing
some of the spontaneous practices,
FMOTQ lost some of its luster, said
Jeremy Jacobs ('O6). At Stanford, Ja
cobs went to FMOTQ all four years;
he stressed that he was more sober
than most, so his memory is accurate.
"Freshman year, there was a lot of
making out and few restrictions, "Ja
cobs said. "Plenty of streakers, the
Band, etcetera. They cracked down
on it in the next years. Fewer people,
more police. Lots more police."
FMOTQ: Today
Now, Full Moon on the Quad has
evolved or devolved, according to
your taste into the undergrad kiss
ing orgy that is the paragon of colle
giate carousing. On the first full
moon of the quarter, painted nudists
from Columbae sprint around the
Quad, seniors check off freshmen
dorms on the Bingo-boards of resi
dences attached to their chests, and
bright-eyed freshmen play tonsil
hockey with entirely too many com
plete strangers. Quantity not quality
is the motto, and at the stroke of mid
night, all hell (and saliva) breaks
loose.

"The first time I went, I oogled in
shock at the naked hooligans, the
Band, but rushed home like a good
little freshman to finish my Math 51
p-set,"Ada Yee ('08) remembered. "I
don't think there was any entertain
ment or free mints my frosh years,
but by senior year, FMOTQ had def
initely evolved."
"When I got back here as an
admin in 1998 and heard what Full
Moon had become, I sort of had this
deer-in-the-headlights-slash-morti
fied-slash-odd type of feeling," re
counted Lythcott-Flaims, now dean
of freshmen. "I had no idea that this
thing that we had participated in
would have become what it is."
The FMOTQ of today is certainly

not the quaint tradition it was at its
inception, but even now, Dean Julie
thinks the tradition is indelibly
etched into Stanford history.
"In many ways, it feels like the

quintessential college tradition be
cause it has all the elements: It takes
place in one of our most sacred
spaces, it's at midnight, and it involves
identity exploration, which is the

hallmark of the undergrad experi
ence," she said.
