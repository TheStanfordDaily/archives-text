It's 4:23 p.m. on a dull Thursday afternoon
and I'm staring at an untouched problem set
due in less than 24 hours. Meandering into
the common room, I contemplate turning on
ESPN, the typical immediate remedy to my
procrastination, but today I can't afford to waste
away on the couch.
There's only one solution: it's time to get my
swell on.
The bike ride to the Tresidder Fitness Center

elapses like the minutes before midnight on New
Year's Eve, and unachievable workout goals are
made like ludicrous New Year's Resolutions.
As I make my grand entrance into the workout
facility, I swipe my card, give a little "what up"
head nod to the cute girl at the front desk and put
down my red bookstore bag in a Kindergarten
like cubby. Gathering my iPod and water bottle, I
go through a quick, preliminary scouting of the
gym.
The small cardio section is halfway full, occu
pied by two Kappas on the elliptical machines, a
60-something-year-old professor on a treadmill
and two freshmen in "Stanford Beirut" shirts talk
ing about the upcoming weekend's ragers while

biking next to each other.
"It's gonna be fucking sick!" one says to the
other.
He's the man.
As I walk over to the stationary bicycles on the
opposite side of the gym, I recall one of my afore
mentioned lofty goals: a solid cardio workout for
30 minutes.
Did I say 30? Let's aim for 10.
After giving a half-assed effort on the bike
while listening to Kid Cudi, I decide that it's go
time and head over to the free weight section.
