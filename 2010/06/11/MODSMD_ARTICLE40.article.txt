Go back to the first time
you ever came to Stan
ford. Maybe you were
visiting with parents or
maybe you came for the
first time before orientation week in
September.
Regardless of how or why we
came, most of us remember the same
thing: our first trip up Palm Drive.
There is a professor jogging on
the pedestrian path, pushing her
baby in a stroller. Cyclists blur past in
bright jerseys, while students
chatting excitedly in a pack head
to the Caltrain for a day in San Fran
cisco.
Then, there are the palms 166
towering jungle masses lining a stun
ningly bold alley. You sense how they
enclose you, as if to say, "You have ar
rived, and there is no turning back."
They nudge you gently along a mile
long path until you are released, and
the shining panorama of the Quad
and Memorial Church greet you
from across the oval.
Palm trees have been a significant
feature of campus since the Universi
ty first opened in 1891. From the very
start, the palms have played a nu
anced role in campus allure and cul
ture not just the 166 palms lining
the iconic Palm Drive, but also the
434 other specimens dispersed
across campus.
Fourteen genera of palms grace
the campus, the most common being
the Canary Island Date Palms and
the Mexican Fan Palms, both of
which line Palm Drive.
The Canary Palms, a short and
stout variety, comprise about 66 per

cent of the palms campus. Mexican
Fans, a taller plant, make up about 13
percent.
According to Julie Cain, land
scape historian, many of the palms
were imported from outside of the
United States and started out on
campus as seedlings.
Campus legend has it that the first
University President, David Starr
Jordan, suggested to Leland Stan
ford that palms be planted along
Palm Drive.
"The palms were definitely a Vic
torian favorite," Cain explained.
"There was a huge interest in ex
otics plants that you bring in from
an outside area. And the campus is
covered in them," she added.
She went on to explain that Fred
erick Law Olmsted did not come up
with the idea for the palms, as is com
monly believed.
More than 130 years later, palms
are the tree or scientifically
speaking, the grass that visitors
remember. Some of the palms on
campus today were planted here be
fore the University was even de
signed, and campus architects and
landscapers still choose them today
to accentuate new structures.
Clearly the palms have some kind
of intriguing power.
"I think you would be hard
pressed to find any more dramatic
entrance to a university than Palm
Drive," said Director of Admission
Shawn Abbott. "It evokes a sense of
grandeur that I don't think you find
at any other university in the U.S."
Abbott explained that the palms
attract prospective students who are
unaccustomed to Stanford's
Mediterranean climate. While the
palms are perceived as being quin
tessentially Californian, however,
they are not indigenous to the Bay
Area.
"The palm trees symbolize
warmth and provide a welcoming el
ement," Abbott said. "I think that
resonates more with students who
are not from California."
The palms are so prominent that
even design consultants working on
publications for the Office of Admis
sion have been concerned about the
impressions that the trees make on
potential students on behalf of the
University.
"When we were in the process of
developing our publications, one of
the design consultants wondered
whether the use of palm trees would
suggest that the University was too
laid back or not serious enough," Ab
bott said. "I don't think they symbol
ize a lack of intellectual rigor at all
I mean, they're a tree."
Some do see the palms, however,
as a reflection of campus culture.
"When I think of Stanford, I think
of palm trees, and hammocks and
skateboarding to class," said Elise
Geithner 'l3. "The palms show that
people are laid back and enjoy the
outdoors."
President John Hennessy said
that the palms emanate campus pos
itivity.
"They seem to reflect a sunny and
bright disposition, which I think is
part of our culture," he said. "People
tend to be happy at Stanford."
Geithner believes campus palms
induce the release of healthy endor
phins, likening the campus to a "trop
ical island."
That said, however, the palms
don't exist entirely without con
tention. Campus legend has it that
one palm tree costs as much as one
year of Stanford tuition.
"I've heard $50,000 [per tree],"
said C.J. Jameson 'lO. "Your tuition is
going to a palm tree that can be
seen as controversial."
Hennessy refuted this myth.
"Most of the palm trees that we
have obtained over the years have
been donated," Hennessy said. "And
in some cases, even the upkeep has
been donated."
"We've never spent very much

University resources on the palm
trees," he added. "People like them
enough that they're willing to give us
money for palm trees."

Max Pinedo, Stanford tree crew
supervisor, was unable to provide
figures regarding the expense of the
palm trees.
"We don't have exact figures, be
cause usually our budget includes all
of the [tree] maintenance that we
do," Pinedo said. "One thing that I
can say is that we have a tree crew of
10 people and a leader."
However, palm trees are economi
cal in the sense that they generally re
quire less maintenance than other
trees, and also consume less water.The
only maintenance palms really re
quire is frond-pruning once per year,
occasional fertilizer and irrigation.
"They're reasonably environ
mentally friendly," Hennessy said.
"If we wanted to plant a lot red
woods around, they would consume
a lot of water, particularly in areas
where they would be relatively ex
posed like Palm Drive."
Students have occasionally spot
ted fire trucks watering palms along
Palm Drive. Pinedo explained this by
saying that newly planted palms usu
ally require a large volume of water
when they are first planted in order
to become established in their new

environment.
After the first couple of years, ir
rigation is covered by a built-in sys
tem that runs along Palm Drive.
Although tree crewmembers
sometimes have to climb very tall
palms that a cherry picker can't
reach, the team tries to avoid the use
of spikes on the trees.
"They use their boots, and their
hands and ropes," Pinedo said.
"There is always a risk when you
climb trees or you climb palms, but
there are procedures for doing it."
Pinedo added that the entire tree
crew is certified by the International
Society of Horticulture, which man
dates the workers learning safe tree
climbing procedures.
In the case of the Canary Island
Date palms, abundant flowering and
fruit must be removed along with the
fronds.
"Those dates are not edible,"
Pinedo said. "We don't harvest any
fruit on campus."
But despite their quirky glorious
ness, not everyone is swept away by
the palms. Many see the palms along
Palm Drive as substantially more
artistic than the palms scattered
around campus.
"Palms by Tresidder and frat
houses have been more divisive,"
Jameson commented. "In that case, it

doesn't seem to add much."
Cain agreed that outside of Palm
Drive, she isn't particularly fond of
the fronds.
"I'm kind of like, they're tall, they
don't give you shade, they're not na
tive what is the deal with the
palms?" she said.
Although the palms were first se
lected as far back as the 1880s, recent
incorporations of exotic elements in
modern, new campus structures sug
gests that the palms will always have
a place in Stanford's aesthetics.
A new open-sky courtyard de
signed by Peter Walker in the
Schwab Center features a stunning,
small forest of California Fan Palms.
"When I saw the Peter Walker
courtyard, it completely changed
my mind about whether or not you
could do something interesting with
palms," Cain explained. "I love it.
When you go in there and you can
hear the palm fronds kind of
rustling in the wind, it's this totally
cool effect."
Geithner summed up the charm
of Stanford's giant tree.
"Palm trees there is life, and
color and they're just always there,"
she said.

figures regarding the expense of the
palm trees.
"We don't have exact figures, be
cause usually our budget includes all
of the [tree] maintenance that we
do," Pinedo said. "One thing that I
can say is that we have a tree crew of
10 people and a leader."
However, palm trees are economi
cal in the sense that they generally re
quire less maintenance than other
trees, and also consume less water.The
only maintenance palms really re
quire is frond-pruning once per year,
occasional fertilizer and irrigation.
"They're reasonably environ
mentally friendly," Hennessy said.
"If we wanted to plant a lot red
woods around, they would consume
a lot of water, particularly in areas
where they would be relatively ex
posed like Palm Drive."
Students have occasionally spot
ted fire trucks watering palms along
Palm Drive. Pinedo explained this by
saying that newly planted palms usu
ally require a large volume of water
when they are first planted in order
to become established in their new

environment.
After the first couple of years, ir
rigation is covered by a built-in sys
tem that runs along Palm Drive.
Although tree crewmembers
sometimes have to climb very tall
palms that a cherry picker can't
reach, the team tries to avoid the use
of spikes on the trees.
"They use their boots, and their
hands and ropes," Pinedo said.
"There is always a risk when you
climb trees or you climb palms, but
there are procedures for doing it."
Pinedo added that the entire tree
crew is certified by the International
Society of Horticulture, which man
dates the workers learning safe tree
climbing procedures.
In the case of the Canary Island
Date palms, abundant flowering and
fruit must be removed along with the
fronds.
"Those dates are not edible,"
Pinedo said. "We don't harvest any
fruit on campus."
But despite their quirky glorious
ness, not everyone is swept away by
the palms. Many see the palms along
Palm Drive as substantially more
artistic than the palms scattered
around campus.
"Palms by Tresidder and frat
houses have been more divisive,"
Jameson commented. "In that case, it

doesn't seem to add much."
Cain agreed that outside of Palm
Drive, she isn't particularly fond of
the fronds.
"I'm kind of like, they're tall, they
don't give you shade, they're not na
tive what is the deal with the
palms?" she said.
Although the palms were first se
lected as far back as the 1880s, recent
incorporations of exotic elements in
modern, new campus structures sug
gests that the palms will always have
a place in Stanford's aesthetics.
A new open-sky courtyard de
signed by Peter Walker in the
Schwab Center features a stunning,
small forest of California Fan Palms.
"When I saw the Peter Walker
courtyard, it completely changed
my mind about whether or not you
could do something interesting with
palms," Cain explained. "I love it.
When you go in there and you can
hear the palm fronds kind of
rustling in the wind, it's this totally
cool effect."
Geithner summed up the charm
of Stanford's giant tree.
"Palm trees there is life, and
color and they're just always there,"
she said.

Go back to the first time
you ever came to Stan
ford. Maybe you were
visiting with parents or
maybe you came for the
first time before orientation week in
September.
Regardless of how or why we
came, most of us remember the same
thing: our first trip up Palm Drive.
There is a professor jogging on
the pedestrian path, pushing her
baby in a stroller. Cyclists blur past in
bright jerseys, while students
chatting excitedly in a pack head
to the Caltrain for a day in San Fran
cisco.
Then, there are the palms 166
towering jungle masses lining a stun
ningly bold alley. You sense how they
enclose you, as if to say, "You have ar
rived, and there is no turning back."
They nudge you gently along a mile
long path until you are released, and
the shining panorama of the Quad
and Memorial Church greet you
from across the oval.
Palm trees have been a significant
feature of campus since the Universi
ty first opened in 1891. From the very
start, the palms have played a nu
anced role in campus allure and cul
ture not just the 166 palms lining
the iconic Palm Drive, but also the
434 other specimens dispersed
across campus.
Fourteen genera of palms grace
the campus, the most common being
the Canary Island Date Palms and
the Mexican Fan Palms, both of
which line Palm Drive.
The Canary Palms, a short and
stout variety, comprise about 66 per

cent of the palms campus. Mexican
Fans, a taller plant, make up about 13
percent.
According to Julie Cain, land
scape historian, many of the palms
were imported from outside of the
United States and started out on
campus as seedlings.
Campus legend has it that the first
University President, David Starr
Jordan, suggested to Leland Stan
ford that palms be planted along
Palm Drive.
"The palms were definitely a Vic
torian favorite," Cain explained.
"There was a huge interest in ex
otics plants that you bring in from
an outside area. And the campus is
covered in them," she added.
She went on to explain that Fred
erick Law Olmsted did not come up
with the idea for the palms, as is com
monly believed.
More than 130 years later, palms
are the tree or scientifically
speaking, the grass that visitors
remember. Some of the palms on
campus today were planted here be
fore the University was even de
signed, and campus architects and
landscapers still choose them today
to accentuate new structures.
Clearly the palms have some kind
of intriguing power.
"I think you would be hard
pressed to find any more dramatic
entrance to a university than Palm
Drive," said Director of Admission
Shawn Abbott. "It evokes a sense of
grandeur that I don't think you find
at any other university in the U.S."
Abbott explained that the palms
attract prospective students who are
unaccustomed to Stanford's
Mediterranean climate. While the
palms are perceived as being quin
tessentially Californian, however,
they are not indigenous to the Bay
Area.
"The palm trees symbolize
warmth and provide a welcoming el
ement," Abbott said. "I think that
resonates more with students who
are not from California."
The palms are so prominent that
even design consultants working on
publications for the Office of Admis
sion have been concerned about the
impressions that the trees make on
potential students on behalf of the
University.
"When we were in the process of
developing our publications, one of
the design consultants wondered
whether the use of palm trees would
suggest that the University was too
laid back or not serious enough," Ab
bott said. "I don't think they symbol
ize a lack of intellectual rigor at all
I mean, they're a tree."
Some do see the palms, however,
as a reflection of campus culture.
"When I think of Stanford, I think
of palm trees, and hammocks and
skateboarding to class," said Elise
Geithner 'l3. "The palms show that
people are laid back and enjoy the
outdoors."
President John Hennessy said
that the palms emanate campus pos
itivity.
"They seem to reflect a sunny and
bright disposition, which I think is
part of our culture," he said. "People
tend to be happy at Stanford."
Geithner believes campus palms
induce the release of healthy endor
phins, likening the campus to a "trop
ical island."
That said, however, the palms
don't exist entirely without con
tention. Campus legend has it that
one palm tree costs as much as one
year of Stanford tuition.
"I've heard $50,000 [per tree],"
said C.J. Jameson 'lO. "Your tuition is
going to a palm tree that can be
seen as controversial."
Hennessy refuted this myth.
"Most of the palm trees that we
have obtained over the years have
been donated," Hennessy said. "And
in some cases, even the upkeep has
been donated."
"We've never spent very much

University resources on the palm
trees," he added. "People like them
enough that they're willing to give us
money for palm trees."

Max Pinedo, Stanford tree crew
supervisor, was unable to provide
figures regarding the expense of the
palm trees.
"We don't have exact figures, be
cause usually our budget includes all
