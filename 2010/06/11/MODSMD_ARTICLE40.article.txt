Go back to the first time
you ever came to Stan
ford. Maybe you were
visiting with parents or
maybe you came for the
first time before orientation week in
September.
Regardless of how or why we
came, most of us remember the same
thing: our first trip up Palm Drive.
There is a professor jogging on
the pedestrian path, pushing her
baby in a stroller. Cyclists blur past in
bright jerseys, while students
chatting excitedly in a pack head
to the Caltrain for a day in San Fran
cisco.
Then, there are the palms 166
towering jungle masses lining a stun
ningly bold alley. You sense how they
enclose you, as if to say, "You have ar
rived, and there is no turning back."
They nudge you gently along a mile
long path until you are released, and
the shining panorama of the Quad
and Memorial Church greet you
from across the oval.
Palm trees have been a significant
feature of campus since the Universi
ty first opened in 1891. From the very
start, the palms have played a nu
anced role in campus allure and cul
ture not just the 166 palms lining
the iconic Palm Drive, but also the
434 other specimens dispersed
across campus.
Fourteen genera of palms grace
the campus, the most common being
the Canary Island Date Palms and
the Mexican Fan Palms, both of
which line Palm Drive.
The Canary Palms, a short and
stout variety, comprise about 66 per

cent of the palms campus. Mexican
Fans, a taller plant, make up about 13
percent.
According to Julie Cain, land
scape historian, many of the palms
were imported from outside of the
United States and started out on
campus as seedlings.
Campus legend has it that the first
University President, David Starr
Jordan, suggested to Leland Stan
ford that palms be planted along
Palm Drive.
"The palms were definitely a Vic
torian favorite," Cain explained.
"There was a huge interest in ex
otics plants that you bring in from
an outside area. And the campus is
covered in them," she added.
She went on to explain that Fred
erick Law Olmsted did not come up
with the idea for the palms, as is com
monly believed.
More than 130 years later, palms
are the tree or scientifically
speaking, the grass that visitors
remember. Some of the palms on
campus today were planted here be
fore the University was even de
signed, and campus architects and
landscapers still choose them today
to accentuate new structures.
Clearly the palms have some kind
of intriguing power.
"I think you would be hard
pressed to find any more dramatic
entrance to a university than Palm
Drive," said Director of Admission
Shawn Abbott. "It evokes a sense of
grandeur that I don't think you find
at any other university in the U.S."
Abbott explained that the palms
attract prospective students who are
unaccustomed to Stanford's
Mediterranean climate. While the
palms are perceived as being quin
