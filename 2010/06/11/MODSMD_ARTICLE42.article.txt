Some consider it the academic equiva
lent of performance-enhancing sports
steroids; to others, it's just a mental
booster on par with a large jolt of caf
feine. Adderall, legally prescribed for
patients with attention deficit disorders, is more
commonly found on college campuses not with
prescription holders, but with an increasing
number of healthy students who use the medi
cine as a "study drug" to boost focus and energy
while studying.
Many students are fully aware that using an
other person's prescription is a crime, but apart
from that, abusing cognitive stimulants like
Adderall and Ritalin carries little negative stig
ma because of their FDA approval and their
widespread presence on campus. These quali
ties, in turn, make obtaining the drugs a simple
task and make enforcing their abuse extremely
difficult.
At Stanford, rising rates of Adderall abuse
are beginning to raise troubling questions: what
makes a student likely to use study drugs, and
could it be considered cheating when used as an
academic enhancer?
A Growing Concern
Surveys on study drugs in college have failed
to come to a consensus about an average rate of
use, with results running the gamut from two
percent to 34 percent of students having ever
used cognitive stimulants without a prescrip
tion. While inconclusive, the results have cer
tainly been considered at Stanford.
A University of Kentucky study of 1600 stu
dents found that more than A-students aiming
for A-plusses, most of the users were C-students
avoiding Ds, said law Prof Hank Greely.To him,
that means that an academically driven school
like Stanford might be less likely to have as
many users.
"To get here, you have to be smart, but you
also have to have your act together," Greely
said. "It's not to say there isn't anyone here like
that, but it's a consideration."
"We don't necessarily have a very good han
dle on use at Stanford," said Ralph Castro, di
rector of the Substance Abuse Prevention pro
gram at Vaden Health Center.
In 2008, Vaden's general health survey in
cluded a question on study drugs: "Have you
ever used a stimulant medication to enhance ac
ademic performance?" According to Castro,
only about two or three percent of responses

said yes, but he said the return was lower than
the accurate count.
"Some students also use drugs like Adderall
just to get high, so they may not have answered,"
he said. "I think the number we got was a little
small, but I also don't think it's as rampant as
some people fear. It's not 20 percent, like some
surveys are reporting."
Greely, who specializes in the ethics of en
hancements, has attracted widespread attention
for his published journal articles and other in
terviews in which he defends prescribed use of
cognitive enhancers against negative social stig
ma.
"There's nothing inherently wrong with cog
nitive enhancement through drugs or other
methods," he said. "I'm a teacher; my job is cog
nitive enhancement. Caffeine is a cognitive en
hancement. I don't think there's anything spe
cial about enhancing with drugs that makes it
morally different."
Greely does concede, however, that the
same flexibility cannot apply to illegal use of
Adderall by students without prescriptions.
But, he said, despite the illegal nature of Adder
all abuse, rates have been growing quickly be
cause of high availability on American campus
es where, he says, prescriptions of Adderall
are eight or nine times as common as prescrip
tions of Ritalin, and much more widely avail
able than other, perhaps safer, mental stimu
lants.
He pointed out that in the University of
Kentucky study, use was incredibly widespread:
four percent had a prescription, and 34 percent
had used it. In juniors and seniors, the use rate
was over half; in fraternity and sorority mem
bers, over 70 percent of surveyed students said
they'd ever used Adderall.
"I don't think anyone is going out and meet
ing dealers in dark corners," Greely said. "It's
being used because there are so many pills on
campus legally."
Student Perspectives
(All student names have been changed to
grant anonymity for a legally sensitive subject.)
"It is about the pressure," said Jason, a junior
Earth Systems major, who uses Adderall on a
regular basis. "It's about catching up with other
students. I don't feel like I can study as much as
other Stanford students do."
Jason said he uses about three or four times
a quarter usually to finish schoolwork in one
block and to prepare for midterms and finals.
"I'm sure to leave two weeks between each
time I use it because I know it can be addictive,"
he said. "I know I'm walking a thin line because
I see the very real possibility that I can only do

work while using it."
Jason, who has been using Adderall without
a prescription since junior year of high school,
used to find it at high school for five dollars a pill.
Now, he says, his younger sister has a prescrip
tion, and he takes part of her dosage.
"When I'm planning to take Adderall, I
schedule it," he said. "I'll wait for a Sunday when
I'm free from obligations, and set aside 12 hours
and take 30 milligrams."
When he's taking it, he said, he makes "tons
of lists" and spends the first couple hours orient
ing himself, then focuses for hours on a specific
project or task, although he can sometimes "get
sidetracked."
"Mostly, it makes you love the work the
feeling of accomplishment is incredible," he
said, and he considers it an important part of his
study schedule. "I don't think I'd be where I am
without it," he added.
For Jessica, a sophomore English major,
Adderall was something she and her friends ex
perimented with in high school, "mostly for the
fun of doing something against the rules, rather
than for studying. But [at Stanford], I know a
bunch of people who take it mostly to stay up all
night."
Since coming to Stanford, Jessica has only
used Adderall once, during last quarter's finals,
but the experience was "not a positive thing."
"I had already been up for a long time, and I
took one in the morning to stay awake," she
said. "I stayed up, but I was already stressed and
it backfired."
For her, the physical side effects outweighed
any kind of academic help the drug gave her.
"I was expecting brilliance, and instead, I
wrote the worst paper I've written in a long
time," she said. "I got work done, sure, but it was
at the expense of feeling good."
While many of the students who use Adder
all do so to increase focus and attention for aca
demic purposes, the drug's chemical similarities
to speed and other amphetamines have also led
to some students using it for recreational use.
"A friend of mine from [Arizona State Uni
versity] brought some to a party on campus, and
we crushed it and snorted some," said Peter, a
senior English major. "It was an immediate high
like I could do anything or go on a crazy ad
venture."
For Peter, who has only used Adderall for
recreational purposes, the stigma against using
it for academic purposes is low and he claims
use is "pretty common."
"Of the fifty or so guys in my [fraternity]
house, I'd say the number of users is under 10,"
he said. "It's a pretty common college thing, es
pecially at somewhere like Stanford where we

have a lot of work to do and the mentality is
pretty easygoing about doing drugs in general."

Health Considerations
"Study drugs are very powerful stimulants,
Adderall especially," Castro said. "It's an am
phetamine mix, which works similarly to co
caine and affects the midbrain like other
methamphetamines. It has the potential to be
highly addictive over a period of time."
Although Greely said users should consider
the risks involved with Adderall, he didn't con
sider the overall problems to be a complete de
terrent.
"One of the problems is, we have very little
research about either the effectiveness or the
safety of Adderall in a healthy population,"
Greely said. "But it doesn't appear to be enor
mously risky, and it doesn't appear to be enor
mously helpful, either. It's sort of like mega-caf
feine, as far as I can tell, not having used it my
self."
Jason noted feeling significant side effects
while on Adderall, such as cold extremities, loss
of appetite and a skewed sense of time. He was
aware of the risk of physical addiction and tried
to space out use to avoid dependence, but he
noted that he "could see becoming psychologi
cally dependent" a worry that Castro also

echoed.
"Once you get used to [study drugs] aiding
you in school, you're more likely to want to use
it again, regardless of physical dependence,"
Castro said.
Is It Cheating?
Aside from the illegal nature of using anoth
er's prescription, academic use of Adderall on
school assignments begs the question of aca
demic violation within University rules. Al
though Stanford has no specific rules regard
ing cognitive enhancement drugs, Castro be
lieves that the future of study drug abuse en
forcement may lie with Judicial Affairs on
campus.
"The way I've been framing this is: is it eth
ical for someone to take a stimulant that gives
them an edge over others doing the same as
signment?" he said.
"I think, yes, Judicial Affairs would look at
this as cheating, just as in sports," Castro added,
saying that it might be even more probable in
disciplines that emphasize quantity-based
work.
Greely, however, disagrees, saying that with-
