Circa 5 p.m., about twenty
students dot the room,
scattered about one-per
son cubicles, large circu
lar tables and armchair
surrounded coffee tables. Silence fills
the space, interrupted by the occa
sional cough, creaking chairs and the
constant patter of fingers typing. The
bells of Hoover Tower and the voices
of children playing outside are faint
ly audible.
Accessible only by an old, slow
moving elevator and a hidden stair
case, the Bing Wing's Albert M. Ben
der Room more commonly re
ferred to simply as the Bender Room
is Green Library's tucked away,
fifth floor treasure.
Upon exiting the elevator, one is
greeted by an austere hallway and a
nondescript plaque that reads "500:
Albert M. Bender Room." Indistin
guishable outside from room 510 just
across the hall, the Bender Room is
easily bypassed by an unknowing vis
itor.
Claire Woodard 'l2, a self-pro
claimed Green Library and Bender
Room enthusiast, still recalls her first
exposure to what has become one of
her favorite paper-writing getaways.
"I was on a library tour during
New Student Orientation, and our
tour guide took us to the Bender
Room," she recounted. "She pref
aced this part of the tour by saying,
'This is one of the lesser known study
spots in the library. It's a magnificent
room.' She kind of played it off like it
was a secret."
"It was love at first sight,"
Woodard recalled. "It just seemed
like such a homey place. The couches
are lovely, the view is amazing and I
love the variety of books! Sometimes
when I'm studying there I take a
break and go browse the shelves."
One step through its heavy wood
en door and it is evident that the
Bender Room is a far cry from Old
Union, dorm lounges or any other
spot on campus.
Sunlight pours in through the
wide, diamond-patterned windows,
illuminating the room's cheerful

golden walls and smooth wooden
floorboards. The airy space is com
fortably decorated in warm browns,
with plush velvet chairs, floral-print
ed rugs and abundant tables and
lamps.
With Bender's idyllic setting and
ample workspace, the room appears
conducive to intense study sessions
but is it? Amidst the seemingly se
rious workers, many Bender Room
inhabitants are actually browsing
random Web sites, appear complete
ly lost in thought or have fallen
asleep.
"There's always people asleep on
the couches," Woodard laughed.
"Sometimes drooling. Often drool
ing, actually."
In one corner of the room, a girl is
slumped face down, her Chemical
Principles and Chemistry: Science of
Change texts unopened as she dozes
soundlessly. A boy in a green sweat
shirt sits at a cubicle by the door, an
assortment of papers and an open
laptop spread out before him. His
head nods forward and back for a
moment before he straightens up,
looks around and dejectedly glares
down at his work.
"How cute is this?" a girl sitting
on the floor whispers to her friend.
She turns her computer screen, dis
playing a black and white striped
mini dress from American Apparel
on her Macbook Air. Her friend
smiles and gives a nod of approval.
A set of wooden cupboards with
glass windows at one end of the room
display various prints, paintings,
drawings and other Stanford depic
tions and paraphernalia, some of
which dates back to the late 1800s. A
boy wearing gray Vans and a bulky
backpack stops to gaze into the dis
play cases for a few minutes on his
way out the door.
A boy wearing glasses and a
checkered shirt stands up and wan
ders toward a set of large framed
prints of impressive world libraries
on the wall. He stops beside an image
of Biblioteca Alexandria in Egypt,
then the Library of Congress in
Washington, D.C. He glances around
the room before returning to his cu
bicle.
The room's door creaks open and
