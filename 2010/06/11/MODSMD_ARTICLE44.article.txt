f ( -w- would do anything to turn the time back to
freshman year," said Eugene Nho.
What some seniors would give to rewind.
For Nho and other Stanford seniors, the final year on
the Farm is one defined by reflection on the past, an in
tensified effort to live in the present and a projection to
ward the future.
No two of Stanford's seniors experience their final
year in the same way. Some seniors eagerly anticipate
graduation, bolstered by the comfort of having secured a
future job. A few haven't made any firm post-graduation
plans. A handful are absolutely terrified. Others are just
enjoying the ride.
"They're a different breed in that they're planning for
June and beyond," explained Felicity Meu, assistant di
rector of student and young alumni development at the
Office of Development, of the current seniors. "They're
thinking about life beyond the bubble."
Nho, an economics major planning on working at a
San Francisco consulting firm after graduation, said that
the most unsettling part of leaving Stanford is precisely
that leaving Stanford.
"I'm completely afraid of graduation because no mat
ter how cool of a job you have, it's not going to be school,"
he said. "This is pretty much the best life I could ask for."
For Elizabeth Bagot, the specter of life beyond Stan
ford is taking its toll on her.
"Instead of looking forward to the future, I'm terri
fied," Bagot admitted. "I'm not yet at the point where I'm
excited to graduate."
"Right now I'm thinking, 'Why am I not doing engi
neering?'" she added.
Christie Cho, a history major, noted that although one
usually gains confidence over the course of their college
career, Stanford seniors have their own set of insecurities.
"There are moments when you see this brilliant fresh
man," Cho said, "and you think, 'They have it way more
figured out than I do.'"
But other seniors are ready to move on to the next
phase of their life.
"I kind of feel a need to breathe," said Joy Henry, a sci
ence, technology and society major. "A lot of Stanford
students have basically been going non-stop since they
were 16, so it will be nice to just be a normal human being.
As weird as it is, real life will probably be a lot less stress
ful than Stanford."
As away of seeking closure, many seniors have at

tempted to retrace their time on the Farm and get back in
touch with the eclectic communities that have shaped
their identities.
"Senior year has been different in terms of reconnect
ing with the school," said Walter Foxworth, a mechanical
engineering major and a senior class president.
The combination of the intensity of the undergradu
ate experience, the incredible friends and the attachment
one develops for life at Stanford make senior year bitter
sweet. When seniors point to the single aspect of the Stan
ford experience that they will miss most, it is almost unan
imous: the people.
"You really begin to appreciate the friends you have
made and really cherish it," said Amir Ravandoust, a
management science and engineering major.
For Ben Phillips, a big difference in the future will be
the lack of everyday conversation among friends.
"I'll definitely miss the camaraderie," Phillips said. "I
feel like there are a bunch of really great people here. You
can just have the most excellent conversations, even
about the most trivial stuff. I mean we're so nerdy I
love it."
For Ravandoust, senior year revolved around four
main tasks: fulfilling GER requirements, writing a thesis,
Pub Night and recruitment.
Cho said that her senior year has revolved around
writing her senior thesis.
"This quarter I'm taking one class," Cho said. "I'm also
writing an honors thesis. It takes up 99 percent of my
time."
However, when seniors aren't madly writing a thesis
or prepping for job interviews, they are conscientiously
trying to make the most of their remaining time.
Sonia Mendoza, a human biology major, decided to
focus on her social life this year more than she has at any
other time during her Stanford career.
"Senior year comes really fast," Mendoza explained.
"You just want to put the brakes on."
Sam Julian, who intends to teach English abroad, is
trying to use his senior year to complete some unfinished
business.
"My band wants to get together and get all of its songs
recorded before we graduate and break up," he said.
"Everything is coming to an end."
Senior year also makes students reflect upon how
much they have changed during their time at Stanford.
"You grow so much from when you're a freshman to
when you're a senior," Mendoza said. "You have no idea
how much your life is going to change by the time you
graduate."
For Ravandoust, this growth meant learning that it
was okay if the Stanford experience didn't unfold in ex
actly the way he had planned.
