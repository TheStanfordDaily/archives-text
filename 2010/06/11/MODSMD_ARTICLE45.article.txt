# ABBAS MILANI'S PATH FROM TEHRAN TO STANFORD:
## CELL BLOCK NO. 1

After last summer's anti-govern
ment protests following the dis
puted presidential election in
Iran, authorities set up show trials
of over 100 alleged opposition
leaders. One of Stanford's own came into
focus: Dr. Abbas Milani, co-director of the
Iran Democracy Project at the Hoover Insti
tution and director of Iranian Studies at
Stanford.
The statement read that Milani was even
more important to the CIA than Shah Reza
Pahlavi's son because of Milani's close con
tact with reformists and his position at "an in
stitute called Hooffer" the most important
of the American foundations behind the Vel
vet Revolution, according to the court's state
ment.
In the U.S., Milani is one of the most re
spected scholars on Iranian politics. He is the
resident Iran expert for The New Republic
magazine and has been interviewed on CNN.
In July 2009, he testified before the Commit
tee on Foreign Affairs in the House of Repre
sentatives.
His path to success, however, was all but
straight. Milani was born into a prominent
Iranian family one uncle a senator, anoth
er a minister in the cabinet. At age 15, he was
sent to study in the United States and en
rolled in Oakland Technical High School,
from which he managed to graduate only a
year later.
Milani went on to Oakland's Merritt Col
lege where, as he writes in his 1996 biography
"Tales of Two Cities," the two founders of the
Black Panther Party, Bobby Seale and Huey
Newton, "gave [him his] first taste of radical
ism," just at the emergence of the Black
Power Movement.
Having transferred to Berkeley in 1968,
Milani joined a Marxist student group oppos
ing the Pahlavi regime in power in Iran. He
remained stateside until receiving his Ph.D.
from the University of Hawaii in 1974, at
which point he was ready to return to his
homeland.
"I really wanted to go back quickly to
Iran," he recalled. "I was a radical student. I
wanted to go back and make the revolution."
In Tehran, he began teaching political sci
ence at National University. The revolution
that Milani had envisioned, however, never
came. Coating his Marxist ideas in metaphors
while lecturing, Milani failed to carry on un
noticed. After just two years back in Tehran,
he was dealt a five-year prison sentence for
opposing the regime, despite his family's ties
in government.
"In Iran at the time," he said, "and in Iran
today, I think, the one crime that connection
cannot solve is political."
However, after plea bargaining and agree
ing not to attack the regime in a media
packed courtroom, his sentence was short
ened to one year. During this time, Milani
spent six months in the notorious Evin
Prison.

"Because I was a university professor and
came from a prominent family, I was placed in
Cell Block Number One, [a division of the
prison reserved for special inmates]," he said.
But despite this, he was granted no special
treatment.
"The head of domestic intelligence told

me during one of my interrogations, 'Don't
think your family can save you. Your ass is
mine,"' he recalled.
At the time. Cell Block Number One held
some of the most influential leaders of the
revolution yet to come; among them, Grand
Ayatollah Montazeri, Ayatollah Rafsanjani

and Ayatollah Mahdavi Kani. Milani's close
contact with them turned him into a skeptic of
the flowery speeches of democracy that Aya
tollah Khomeini delivered from exile in Paris
and of the Islamic Revolution itself once it hit
the streets of Tehran in 1979.
"I spent time with these guys in prison. I
knew how intolerant they would be," he said.
"I sensed that what was coming was a form of
despotism worse than what was leaving us.
Mixing religion and democracy would not be
an option."
Upon his release, the shah's regime kept
barring Milani from the classroom because he
was considered a leftist. He believes that the
shah's fear of communism blinded him from
the foe that would eventually overthrow him.
"They thought we a group of small stu
dents were their main enemy and they al
lowed the clergy to do anything they wanted,"
he said.
The political science professor also draws
a parallel to the Cold War.
"The US made the same mistake in
Afghanistan," he said. "They thought they
could use the Islamists against the Soviet
Union and they were successful in doing it.
But they created a monster bigger than, or at
least as big as, the monster they were fight
ing."
Milani laughs as he recalls the chaos sur
rounding the hottest days of the Islamic Rev
olution in' 79. He joined a group of professors
with the endeavor of keeping Teheran Uni
versity a non-militarized zone.
"People had ransacked army depots
everybody carried a machine gun. Somebody
even brought a tank into the University," he
said, pausing with a smile as he remembered
the events that followed. "So we asked them
to take it out. And they did."
According to his students, his apparent
ease and lightheartedness are translated into
his teaching.
"[He is] one of the most laid back and per
sonable professors I've ever had at Stan
ford," said Andi Harrington 'l2, one of his
students in this quarter's Polisci 245R: Poli
tics in Modern Iran. "His class offers relief
even though the content is so dense through
his simple and concise descriptions and of
course with a little humor."
One of his advisees, Miguel Molina 'll,
said that keeping in mind his close interac
tion with Iranian politics, including imprison
ment, makes his impartial work in the class
room all the more impressive,
"His unbiased scholarship and teaching is
remarkable and commendable," he said.
"After each class session, you walk away with
the sensation of not just having learned a
great deal, but with the intellectual comfort
of having the ability of fomenting your own
educated opinions."
After the Islamic Revolution, Milani went
back to teaching, but encountered the same
types of barriers to his scholarship that he
had under the shah popularity among stu
dents intertwined with suspensions and dis
missals.
In 1986, while Milani sought a second
opinion before undergoing open-heart sur

gery, an American doctor, Dr. Childs at
UCLA, said there was nothing wrong with
his heart and instead diagnosed the scholar
with "Khomeini Syndrome." Milani under
stood the time to leave Iran had come once
again.
"I left a job at the top university in the
country and came here with no job," he re
called. "I literally had to work as a bartender
initially to make ends meet."
The university professor joined the ranks
of Spangler's Bar in Berkeley. Luckily, Notre
Dame de Namur University in Belmont,
Calif, soon appointed Dr. Milani as Chair of
the Department of History and Political Sci
ence, where he stayed for 12 years.
But his longtime comfort at Notre Dame
de Namur would soon be briskly disrupted.
Milani was again put in the spotlight of Iran
ian expatriate political life when a group of
Persian Americans raised enough money
through donations to create the Iran Democ
racy Project at Hoover.
Milani speaks lovingly and proudly of the
project. Although the Bush administration
allocated $75 million in efforts to promote
democracy in Iran and, according to Milani,
offered him one of those millions, he kindly
declined.
"We decided that we were going to be a
grassroots, non-government endeavor and
we have remained that," he explained.
Only hours prior to speaking to The Daily,
Milani went on the Voice of America and ad
dressed this issue of government funding.
"If you can find evidence that we got one
penny from the U.S. government one
penny I will never utter a word about Iran
again," he stated. He reinforced this to The
Daily: "It is absolute, utter nonsense."
Khomeini's government has been the pro
ject's most outspoken opponent, linking it to
American imperialism and the CIA. It even
named Milani an enemy of the state and now
Stanford University is along with Yale on
the regime's list of "subversive organizations."
The regime that denounced him, Milani
explained, is fractured and scared. Even Ah
madinejad's supporters are leaving what
seems to be a sinking ship.
"They know they are sitting on a seething
volcano. They know people hate them," he
said. "Any sudden move can unleash this
wrath. If they thought they could've gotten
away with killing Mousavi [the "runner-up"
in June's presidential election], they would
have killed him yesterday. Not only haven't
they killed him, they've increased his body
guards."
Even if it wanted to, the Hoover Institu
tion inspiring a democratic revolution in Iran
would be a major long shot, if not impossible.
But what about a revolution from the Iranian
people themselves?
"Unless people want a potentially bloody
civil war, you can't be looking for a revolu
tion in that sense," he said. "I think Iran will
need a transitional phase before democracy.
For that to happen, you need the will of the
people and I think we have that."
