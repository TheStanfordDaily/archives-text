# SWINE FLU STRIKES BACK

under my tongue, she had her answer.
101.5 degrees.
Rushing out of the room, she came
back with an orange Gatorade: fluid
sustenance free of charge. I was glad
to know the increased Vaden fees
come with perks.
The doctor arrived minutes later,
with the same questions. Apparently,
he didn't get the memo from the
nurse.
"So," he asked, "do you have a
cough?"
A bout of mucous-hacking and
wheezing sent him running from the
room.
He returned soon enough, howev
er, this time armed with a facemask
and carrying one for me.
"Keep this on," he advised, cau
tiously handing me the shield. "You
probably have the flu, and if you have
the flu, it's most likely HINI."
That's all that mattered. Without
performing any tests, the doctor arbi
trarily declared I had the dreaded
swine flu. Before having been on
campus for 24 hours, I had managed
to catch the one sickness that had the
administration ducking under their
covers.
I didn't listen to much of what the
doctor had to offer after that as he
parroted the instructions that I've
read in the countless warning emails
and administrative notifications: stay
home, isolate yourself, drink fluids.

There was fear etched on the
four faces in the waiting
room as I emerged from
the cracked doors. Eight
eyes darted from their cell
phones, magazines and laptop
screens, examining the latest Vaden
casualty and silently pondering their
own prognoses. But to them, my case
wasn't one for deliberation. I was a
goner.
Minutes earlier, I had been one of
them, waiting to be herded into an ex
amination room by a nurse. I arrived
30 minutes early for a 2:30 appoint
ment and had claimed my territory in
a far corner of the room, establishing
a solid five-foot radius with a deep
cough and intermittent sniffles.
"It's only a cold," I thought. "That
guy coming out has it way worse than
me. That girl definitely has whooping
cough."
At 2:35,1 was led away by a nurse
in purple Crocs and a perma-smile,
and immediately attacked with a flur
ry of questions.
"Are you coughing? Do you have a
sore throat or a fever?"
My mind raced. Yes, no, I don't
think so?
Jabbing a high-tech thermometer

sleep well. I escaped the room, forget
ting about the mask affixed to my face
and rushing out the waiting room en
trance.

I collapsed back into it. My day was
shot.
As I trekked through Saturday
and Sunday, managing to partially
unpack, I got to know my new bed
pretty well. And that was the prob
lem. With housemates filing in, I was
left confined in my room as small so
cial gatherings formed and intro
ductions were exchanged. Those
who did manage to poke their heads
through my doorframe were afford
ed a thoroughly awkward conversa
tion.
"Hi, I'm Ryan. I'd shake your hand,
but I'm sick. Sooo ..."
I had better get well fast, I thought,
or risk becoming the house's archetyp
al social pariah.

in room 211. After giving me a brief
rundown of her extensive training, she

My undiagnosed comrades stared
in shock, as they had witnessed a per
fectly normal junior male go behind
the doors and return with a facemask.
I dodged the hand sanitizer dispenser
in the middle of the room and averted
their gazes. But their stares were justi
fied. I was done.

Returning home, I lay exhausted on
an uncovered mattress for an hour and
deliberated my fate, forgetting to un
pack. What about class? What about
my empty room?
I spent Friday in bed, miserable as
my fever and general stuffiness in
creased tenfold. A brief assault on
chicken noodle soup brought by a
friend was the only respite from the
clutches of HINI. Unable to get out of
bed for more than the odd 15 minutes,

welcomed me to the house while at the
same time passive-aggressively warn
ing me to stay as isolated as possible.
"Call me if you need anything,"
she said, ten feet away from my bed as
she remained in the hallway outside
my abode.
Great.
When Monday came around, I
managed to drag myself to 9 a.m.
class, keeping a good five rows be
tween me and everyone else as I
found a seat. That first day, I counted
the times that professors mentioned
that if students were sick, they'd bet
ter stay home three.
Breaking every administrative de
sire, I declared myself the exception
and continued to attend class
throughout the week. Coughs raised
eyebrows and caused people to edge
slowly away in their seats. A blown
nose forced immediate discrimina
tion.
But I persevered. I learned the art
of the fist bump and loaded up on
Motrin and Advil to get me through
my day.
Tuesday passed, then Wednesday,
then Thursday and finally Friday. The
weekend was a welcome sight, and so
was the fact I was alive.
I never thought I'd get HINI. But
then pigs flew.

My Resident Assistant (RA) man
aged to make the rounds by Saturday,
after hearing of the monster that lived
in room 211. After giving me a brief
rundown of her extensive training, she

My undiagnosed comrades stared
in shock, as they had witnessed a per
fectly normal junior male go behind
the doors and return with a facemask.
I dodged the hand sanitizer dispenser
in the middle of the room and averted
their gazes. But their stares were justi
fied. I was done.

Returning home, I lay exhausted on
an uncovered mattress for an hour and
deliberated my fate, forgetting to un
pack. What about class? What about
my empty room?
I spent Friday in bed, miserable as
my fever and general stuffiness in
creased tenfold. A brief assault on
chicken noodle soup brought by a
friend was the only respite from the
clutches of HINI. Unable to get out of
bed for more than the odd 15 minutes,

welcomed me to the house while at the
same time passive-aggressively warn
ing me to stay as isolated as possible.
"Call me if you need anything,"
she said, ten feet away from my bed as
she remained in the hallway outside
my abode.
Great.
When Monday came around, I
managed to drag myself to 9 a.m.
class, keeping a good five rows be
tween me and everyone else as I
found a seat. That first day, I counted
the times that professors mentioned
that if students were sick, they'd bet
ter stay home three.
Breaking every administrative de
sire, I declared myself the exception
and continued to attend class
throughout the week. Coughs raised
eyebrows and caused people to edge
slowly away in their seats. A blown
nose forced immediate discrimina
tion.
But I persevered. I learned the art
of the fist bump and loaded up on
Motrin and Advil to get me through
my day.
Tuesday passed, then Wednesday,
then Thursday and finally Friday. The
weekend was a welcome sight, and so
was the fact I was alive.
I never thought I'd get HINI. But
then pigs flew.
