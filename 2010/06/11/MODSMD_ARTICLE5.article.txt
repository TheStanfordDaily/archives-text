## Foreign students fight insurance rule

The University's move last month to
require international students to purchase
Stanford-provided Cardinal Care for the
2010-2011 school year has become a light
ning rod within the international student
community, prompting a student-led peti
tion to kill the new requirement, concerns
among foreign students of University dis
crimination and administrative talks on
whether to loosen requirements of the
plan.

Under the revised policy, international
students will be obligated to purchase Car
dinal Care the University's $3,000 an
nual healthcare package in 12-month
increments. Currently, Stanford's insur
ance policy has an "opt out" mechanism
that allows students to forego Cardinal
Care if they provide proof that they have

adequate insurance coverage from anoth
er source, such as parents, a spouse or an
other insurance provider.
Domestic students remain free to
choose their own insurance provider.
Currently, seven percent of the under
graduate population, or 488 students, are
international.Thirty-two percent of gradu
ate students, 2,734 students in total, are in
ternational.
Requiring Cardinal Care solely for in
ternational students "is discriminatory be
cause it assumes that domestic students
can better evaluate whether their cover
age is adequate or not," said Fabian Sahl, a
graduate student in International Policy
Studies. Sahl has been at the forefront of
the opposition to the mandatory coverage
plan, co-authoring a petition that demands
that Stanford revoke the proposed plan
and keep the existing policy. The petition
had more than 500 signatures on Wednes
day night.
Ira Friedman, director of Vaden Health

Center and a major proponent of the Car
dinal Care plan, has seen first-hand what
happens when international students fall
through the coverage cracks.
"I see these folks drowning in the
river," Friedman said, "and I think, 'Can't
we put a fence upstream to keep them
from falling in?'"
Friedman said the issue of compulsory
Cardinal Care for internationals was rec
ommended as far back as 2008 in the Stu
dent Mental Flealth and Well-being Task
Force Report. He backs the proposal be
cause he said it provides a safety net that
will eliminate medical snafus that have
flared up several times a quarter "prob
lems that occur almost exclusively for in
ternational students."
Friedman said that about 80 percent of
international students already buy Cardi
nal Care, but the 20 percent who have
other coverage plans have run into
problems ranging from being denied
in-patient treatment for mental health
conditions to having to relocate to a
county hospital when they have a
medical emergency.
But for Sahl, Friedman's well
meant fence curtails his personal
choice.
"This is a private institution, and
the move is paternalistic," Sahl said.
"We can very well decide for ourselves
if our coverage meets the standard
that Cardinal Care does."
Sunil Sandhu, a Ph.D. student in
electrical engineering and native of
Singapore, rejects the move on princi
ple, calling it "collective punishment
rather than corrective action." Fie is
currently covered under Cardinal
Care, but is considering opting out.
"I think everyone should have their
own choices," Sandhu said, citing his
own personal care packages, which he
said are tailored to back injuries he
sustained in a recent fall. Cardinal
Care doesn't cover Sandhu's specific
physical therapy expenses, and his in
ability to tailor-make his care package
is a problem.
"Flow much mental coverage do
you really need?" Sandhu asked.
"Vaden says you need X amount for
mental health and X amount for in
juries. How can they decide that? It
varies from person to person. It makes
no sense."
In mid-February, after the pro
posed changes were announced, con
cerned members of the international
community wanted answers. Adeline
Agut, a graduate student in civil and
environmental engineering and mem
ber of the French Student Association,
along with John Pearson, director of
Bechtel International Center, organ
ized meetings with Friedman to dis
cuss steps to get the administration to
reconsider the plan.
As an alternative, students asked
the University to lay out guidelines for
what is considered minimum accept
able coverage and require students
who wish to waive Cardinal Care to
provide written statements of benefits
from their alternate provider.
"From what I've heard, Stanford is
pretty open to negotiations," Agut
said. "When they say they want the
best for us, I believe them. I don't think
they're evil."
In meetings with Friedman, stu
dents also asked that the University
extend the time frame for reviews of
the new plan in order to get more stu
dent input.
But Sandhu questioned why stu
dents specifically graduates
were blindsided by the policy shift in
the first place and left having to scram
ble for a last-minute response. He
blamed a lack of internal communica
tion between the GSC and the Vaden
Insurance Advisory Committee
(VLAC).
"The GSC just let these guys [the
VIAC] go, and there was no coordina
tion," Sandhi said. "So if, from the start,
the VIAC heard that there was this
move to get mandatory Cardinal Care
for international students, they should
have communicated with the GSC and
said that this is going to happen. If they
had, we wouldn't have been in this
mess."
Daniel Becker, an electrical engi
neering Ph.D. student from Germany,
is currently on an insurance plan of
fered by a private German company
targeted specifically toward extended
stays abroad. Becker's insurance plan
which costs around $llO per month
provides worldwide coverage, in
cludes dental, vision and prescription
drugs, and allows him to freely choose
which doctors to visit without the need
for a referral, he said. Cardinal Care
does not include dental or vision cov
erage and provides limited out-of-net
work coverage.
Becker is concerned with the high
er premiums he will have to pay under
Cardinal Care.
"My biggest concern with manda
tory enrollment in Cardinal Care is the
loss of coverage compared to my cur
rent plan," Becker said. "Most impor
tantly, Cardinal Care only reimburses
80 percent of the cost incurred at out
of-network providers. Given that seri
ous injuries or illnesses can easily lead
to immense health care bills, this puts
me at a significant financial risk any
time I travel, be it for attending a con
ference or for visiting my family back
home."
Sahl is currently insured under a
German plan that cooperates with the
Swiss provider Elvia in the United
States. He said that the cost of his in
surance policy is roughly $2,000 dollars
cheaper a year than Cardinal Care.
Friedman acknowledged that
some students, such as Becker and
Sahl, are savvy healthcare purchasers
and have chosen cost-effective alter
natives. For students like those, Fried
man is negotiating a "feasible process
for exceptions."
"We're listening very carefully to
student feedback on this," Friedman
said. "The policy is aimed at trying to
address a problem that is occurring
only exclusively in one quarter of the
student population. From a public
health viewpoint, we can and should
tiy to address it."

nal Care, but the 20 percent who have
other coverage plans have run into
problems ranging from being denied
in-patient treatment for mental health
conditions to having to relocate to a
county hospital when they have a
medical emergency.
But for Sahl, Friedman's well
meant fence curtails his personal
choice.
"This is a private institution, and
the move is paternalistic," Sahl said.
"We can very well decide for ourselves
if our coverage meets the standard
that Cardinal Care does."
Sunil Sandhu, a Ph.D. student in
electrical engineering and native of
Singapore, rejects the move on princi
ple, calling it "collective punishment
rather than corrective action." Fie is
currently covered under Cardinal
Care, but is considering opting out.
"I think everyone should have their
own choices," Sandhu said, citing his
own personal care packages, which he
said are tailored to back injuries he
sustained in a recent fall. Cardinal
Care doesn't cover Sandhu's specific
physical therapy expenses, and his in
ability to tailor-make his care package
is a problem.
"Flow much mental coverage do
you really need?" Sandhu asked.
"Vaden says you need X amount for
mental health and X amount for in
juries. How can they decide that? It
varies from person to person. It makes
no sense."
In mid-February, after the pro
posed changes were announced, con
cerned members of the international
community wanted answers. Adeline
Agut, a graduate student in civil and
environmental engineering and mem
ber of the French Student Association,
along with John Pearson, director of
Bechtel International Center, organ
ized meetings with Friedman to dis
cuss steps to get the administration to
reconsider the plan.
As an alternative, students asked
the University to lay out guidelines for
what is considered minimum accept
able coverage and require students
who wish to waive Cardinal Care to
provide written statements of benefits
from their alternate provider.
"From what I've heard, Stanford is
pretty open to negotiations," Agut
said. "When they say they want the
best for us, I believe them. I don't think
they're evil."
In meetings with Friedman, stu
dents also asked that the University
extend the time frame for reviews of
the new plan in order to get more stu
dent input.
But Sandhu questioned why stu
dents specifically graduates
were blindsided by the policy shift in
the first place and left having to scram
ble for a last-minute response. He
blamed a lack of internal communica
tion between the GSC and the Vaden
Insurance Advisory Committee
(VLAC).
"The GSC just let these guys [the
VIAC] go, and there was no coordina
tion," Sandhi said. "So if, from the start,
the VIAC heard that there was this
move to get mandatory Cardinal Care
for international students, they should
have communicated with the GSC and
said that this is going to happen. If they
had, we wouldn't have been in this
mess."
Daniel Becker, an electrical engi
neering Ph.D. student from Germany,
is currently on an insurance plan of
fered by a private German company
targeted specifically toward extended
stays abroad. Becker's insurance plan
which costs around $llO per month
provides worldwide coverage, in
cludes dental, vision and prescription
drugs, and allows him to freely choose
which doctors to visit without the need
for a referral, he said. Cardinal Care
does not include dental or vision cov
erage and provides limited out-of-net
work coverage.
Becker is concerned with the high
er premiums he will have to pay under
Cardinal Care.
"My biggest concern with manda
tory enrollment in Cardinal Care is the
loss of coverage compared to my cur
rent plan," Becker said. "Most impor
tantly, Cardinal Care only reimburses
80 percent of the cost incurred at out
of-network providers. Given that seri
ous injuries or illnesses can easily lead
to immense health care bills, this puts
me at a significant financial risk any
time I travel, be it for attending a con
ference or for visiting my family back
home."
Sahl is currently insured under a
German plan that cooperates with the
Swiss provider Elvia in the United
States. He said that the cost of his in
surance policy is roughly $2,000 dollars
cheaper a year than Cardinal Care.
Friedman acknowledged that
some students, such as Becker and
Sahl, are savvy healthcare purchasers
and have chosen cost-effective alter
natives. For students like those, Fried
man is negotiating a "feasible process
for exceptions."
"We're listening very carefully to
student feedback on this," Friedman
said. "The policy is aimed at trying to
address a problem that is occurring
only exclusively in one quarter of the
student population. From a public
health viewpoint, we can and should
tiy to address it."

The University's move last month to
require international students to purchase
Stanford-provided Cardinal Care for the
2010-2011 school year has become a light
ning rod within the international student
community, prompting a student-led peti
tion to kill the new requirement, concerns
among foreign students of University dis
crimination and administrative talks on
whether to loosen requirements of the
plan.

Under the revised policy, international
students will be obligated to purchase Car
dinal Care the University's $3,000 an
nual healthcare package in 12-month
increments. Currently, Stanford's insur
ance policy has an "opt out" mechanism
that allows students to forego Cardinal
Care if they provide proof that they have

adequate insurance coverage from anoth
er source, such as parents, a spouse or an
other insurance provider.
Domestic students remain free to
choose their own insurance provider.
Currently, seven percent of the under
graduate population, or 488 students, are
international.Thirty-two percent of gradu
ate students, 2,734 students in total, are in
ternational.
Requiring Cardinal Care solely for in
ternational students "is discriminatory be
cause it assumes that domestic students
can better evaluate whether their cover
age is adequate or not," said Fabian Sahl, a
graduate student in International Policy
Studies. Sahl has been at the forefront of
the opposition to the mandatory coverage
plan, co-authoring a petition that demands
that Stanford revoke the proposed plan
and keep the existing policy. The petition
had more than 500 signatures on Wednes
day night.
Ira Friedman, director of Vaden Health

Center and a major proponent of the Car
dinal Care plan, has seen first-hand what
happens when international students fall
through the coverage cracks.
"I see these folks drowning in the
river," Friedman said, "and I think, 'Can't
we put a fence upstream to keep them
from falling in?'"
Friedman said the issue of compulsory
Cardinal Care for internationals was rec
ommended as far back as 2008 in the Stu
dent Mental Flealth and Well-being Task
Force Report. He backs the proposal be
cause he said it provides a safety net that
will eliminate medical snafus that have
flared up several times a quarter "prob
lems that occur almost exclusively for in
ternational students."
Friedman said that about 80 percent of
international students already buy Cardi
nal Care, but the 20 percent who have
other coverage plans have run into
problems ranging from being denied
in-patient treatment for mental health
conditions to having to relocate to a
county hospital when they have a
medical emergency.
