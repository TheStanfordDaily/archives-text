The University's move last month to
require international students to purchase
Stanford-provided Cardinal Care for the
2010-2011 school year has become a light
ning rod within the international student
community, prompting a student-led peti
tion to kill the new requirement, concerns
among foreign students of University dis
crimination and administrative talks on
whether to loosen requirements of the
plan.

Under the revised policy, international
students will be obligated to purchase Car
dinal Care the University's $3,000 an
nual healthcare package in 12-month
increments. Currently, Stanford's insur
ance policy has an "opt out" mechanism
that allows students to forego Cardinal
Care if they provide proof that they have

adequate insurance coverage from anoth
er source, such as parents, a spouse or an
other insurance provider.
Domestic students remain free to
choose their own insurance provider.
Currently, seven percent of the under
graduate population, or 488 students, are
international.Thirty-two percent of gradu
ate students, 2,734 students in total, are in
ternational.
Requiring Cardinal Care solely for in
ternational students "is discriminatory be
cause it assumes that domestic students
can better evaluate whether their cover
age is adequate or not," said Fabian Sahl, a
graduate student in International Policy
Studies. Sahl has been at the forefront of
the opposition to the mandatory coverage
plan, co-authoring a petition that demands
that Stanford revoke the proposed plan
and keep the existing policy. The petition
had more than 500 signatures on Wednes
day night.
Ira Friedman, director of Vaden Health

Center and a major proponent of the Car
dinal Care plan, has seen first-hand what
happens when international students fall
through the coverage cracks.
"I see these folks drowning in the
river," Friedman said, "and I think, 'Can't
we put a fence upstream to keep them
from falling in?'"
Friedman said the issue of compulsory
Cardinal Care for internationals was rec
ommended as far back as 2008 in the Stu
dent Mental Flealth and Well-being Task
Force Report. He backs the proposal be
cause he said it provides a safety net that
will eliminate medical snafus that have
flared up several times a quarter "prob
lems that occur almost exclusively for in
ternational students."
Friedman said that about 80 percent of
international students already buy Cardi
nal Care, but the 20 percent who have
