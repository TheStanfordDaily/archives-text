# BEST OF INTERMISSION 2009-10
## SNOWCHELLA CATCHES ON 
### ANNIKA HEINLE 
due to widespread posters and Facebook ad
vertising, but things reached a climax on Sat
urday afternoon, with the professional tent,
concert flooring, and audio and visual equip
ment proving to naysayers that this was actu
ally going to be a big deal.
After a crowd had amassed and the lasers
and snow machines were fired up, Young the
Giant took the stage, playing both new mate
rial and songs that the campus sang along to,
like "Texas Tea" and the crowd favorite,
"Cough Syrup." Lead vocalist Sameer Gadhia
yelled between songs, "It's so great to be back
at Stanford!" and in traditional Cardinal
pride, the enormous-for-an-opener crowd
screamed their approval.
After Young the Giant, the guys of Sigma
Nu pulled off one of the quickest set changes
known to man, preparing the stage and the
crowd for Xaphoon Jones, the affable produc
er half of Chiddy Bang, who got the crowd on
its feet with a mix of the impossible-to-avoid

American Apparel, giant tents, sponsored
beverages, concert T-shirts and harried securi
ty guards are all critical parts to large music
festivals. In a much-anticipated campus anom
aly, Stanford found its own legitimate music
festival on Sigma Nu's front lawn. One of the
most widely attended events on campus this
year, Snowchella showcased Stanford's own
Young the Giant (most know them as the
Jakes), hipster hop duo Chiddy Bang and one
half of DJs extraordinaire Designer Drugs.
Organized by and with donations from
Stanford Concert Network, Sigma Nu and
Kappa Kappa Gamma, Snowchella was a rare
weekend night where students didn't have to
venture off campus to find a concert worth at
tending. The buzz built strongly on campus

"Party in the USA." Xaphoon's idle mixing was
the perfect prelude to Chiddy's (rapper half)
entrance. Halfway through the set, Xaphoon
declared, "My boy Chiddy is the best freestyler!
They all say that in Philly, but Chiddy will prove
it!" and to the absolute frenzy of the crowd,
Chiddy rapped about Stanford, expertly tailor
ing their performance to the campus. After per
forming the anticipated "All Things Go" (a

remix of Sufjan Steven's "Chicago") and "Kids
(The Opposite of Adults)," where Xaphoon
takes on MGMT, Chiddy Bang left the stage for
Sigma Nu to do another set change.
The highlight of the night came around mid
night, when half (Michael Vincent Patrick) of
the up-and-coming and insanely popular De
signer Drugs took the stage. Without any intro
duction or interaction with the crowd, Patrick

began spinning mixes that were impossible to
not dance to. It seemed as though the entire
campus was raving together, with enough fist
pumping that even the cast of "Jersey Shore"
would be proud. Designer Drugs' set was a non
stop party, with students dancing on stage a-la
Girl Talk, and the bass thumping so that even
Suites could feel it. Things reached their peak
with Patrick's mix of "Bad Romance," a high
light for many concertgoers that night.
While everybody on campus knew that
Snowchella was happening, many didn't know
why. The concert was thrown as a benefit for
Support for International Change (SIC), an ef
fort working toward the relief of HIV/AIDS in
Tanzania. Intermission sat down with Taylor
Ray, 'lO, who spearheaded the event, to talk
about SIC.
"SIC fights HIV/AIDS through three main

Snowchella was a rare weekend night where
students didn't have to venture off campus
to find a concert worth attending.
