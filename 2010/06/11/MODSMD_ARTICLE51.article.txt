# 'IT'S CHARITY, BITCH': STANFORD'S OWN RUNWAY

Andy Warhol's famous dictum,
"Everyone will be world-famous for 15
minutes" was presciently accurate for 38
gorgeous Stanford students last Satur
day. A highly anticipated annual event.
Charity Fashion Show (CFS) drew hun
dreds of spectators, photographers and
designers alike to the colossal $50,000
tent erected on Roble Field.

The show featured 25 designers, most
of who are locally based, as well as im
pressive pieces from four high school in
terns and such lionized names as
Nanette Lapore and Eva Franco. With 25
consecutive sets displayed by 55 models
38 of whom were college students
and hundreds of priceless garments
housed in a make-shift backstage delin
eated by portion of lawn, there was defi
nite potential for chaos. But executive
director Thorn Scher 'll and director of
development Stephanie Werner 'll

somehow managed to make it work
and splendidly so.
"It's completely crazy," Werner states
as she momentarily allows herself to
catch her breath. "We've been up and
running since 5:30 a.m. and we've added
the diamond at the end of the runway." I
look up from my notebook and she's
vanished.

Although it is an entirely student-run
production, CFS has recently been
dubbed the largest fashion show on the
West Coast and nearly doubled in capac
ity since the previous year.
So how do hundreds of glitzy gar
ments, extortionate stilettos and opulent
accessories perform philanthropy, one
might ask. The "charity" behind Charity
Fashion Show is executed via a donation
to an annually nominated beneficiary
that the board of directors believes befits
CFS's specific vocation. This time
around, the organization will bestow all
revenue to the non-profit, micro-finance
organization Kiva, which aspires to alle
viate poverty by connecting people

through lending. Kiva, launched by Stan
ford alumni, enables individual lenders
to grant micro-loans to noteworthy en
trepreneurs around the world. It is Char
ity Fashion Show's aim to pair up with
Kiva in order to "fund loans specifically
designed for entrepreneurs in the fash
ion and garment industry."
The opening guest performance by
San Francisco-based alternative-electro
group Fans of Jimmy Century was off
putting to say the least. Fiery redheaded
vocalist Alicia Peron was not exactly suc
cessful in galvanizing the crowd for the
ensuing event. But as soon as the lights
dimmed and the eloquent Scher treaded
onto the catwalk, the audience was in
stantly animated and became increas
ingly so as CFS's promotional video
flashed across the backdrop.
The show opened with Dutch design
er Tosca Soraya's line, and although
black and white seemed to be the colors
du jour, don't designate her collection
gothic. On the contrary, it had a luxe fem
inine feel, with lacy eyelet trim on every

thing from collars and petticoats to
patent leather sweatshirts. Soraya's
fierce collection immediately took a col
orful turn with splatter-painted leggings
and bodysuits, and gowns boasting wa
tercolor-like geometric prints. Addition
ally, her architectural garments incorpo
rated waistlines that were both low slung
and cinched at the ribcage, providing a
variation for every figure.
As the evening unfolded, models
strutted to remixes of Brit-pop phenom
enon M.I. A, as well as mash-ups of Fiest,
Santogold and the French quartet
Phoenix before suggestively sauntering
down the catwalk to ACDC's "You
Shook Me All Night Long." In this
raunchy set, negligibly attired girls swag
gered down the runway in nothing but
pinstriped men's dress shirts and knee
socks, accompanied by their polka-dot
ted boxer-bearing contemporaries.
Toward the end of the show, the
menswear collection Kent Denim sur
prisingly garnered the most whistles and
cat calls due to the well-sculpted torsos

that graced the runway. The collec
tion was a standout stockpile of
modern staples that were paradoxi
cally Western with a metropolitan
appeal. Crafted out of high-end ma
terials like brushed herringbone,
checkered plaid and crisply struc
tured tweed, the collection looked
stunning hanging from the brawny
shoulders of Stanford students.
As the evening came to a close
the tent was abuzz with swooning
fashionistas and the occasional
proud parent, all exclaiming that the
event was the best it had ever been.
Charity Fashion Show is a must-see
for next year because let's face it,
nothing tops watching your friends
conquer the catwalk bedecked in
designer duds. Besides, as first-year
model Kiyan Williams 'l3 so accu
rately mused, "It's charity, bitch."
