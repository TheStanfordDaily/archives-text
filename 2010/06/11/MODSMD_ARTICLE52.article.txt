# BEHIND THE GAIETIES CURTAIN

It is that time of year again, the time when
campus is plastered with the same inexplicable
posters, The Daily is flooded with offended letters
to the editor and Oski the Bear has been impaled
on the very tip of the Claw.
This year's cryptic poster advertises "Apoca
lypse Cal: Gaieties 2009" and just like every year
before it, most of the campus has virtually no idea
what is in store for them, besides the inevitable
roasting of Cal and, more importantly, the stan
dard group of naked people.
Despite the fact that Gaieties is traditionally
shrouded in secrecy, Intermission got a sneak pre
view at one of the last rehearsals for this year's
show. Practicing in the always glamorous Wilbur
Dining, many of Stanford's finest thespians were
warming up in completely ridiculous clothing

most of it highlighter neon, with the occasional
onesie and Batman suit thrown in. These aren't
their actual costumes, just like Wilbur Dining isn't
actually their venue, but they were determined to
work with what they have got to make even re
hearsal a wild experience.
After multiple ridiculous warm-ups and a uni
fying cheer of "1,2,3, Gaieties!" everybody took
the "stage," The show opens on a narrator laying
out the scene of the annual Activities Fair, which
is prime fodder for Gaieties, as it allows every stu
dent group to be made fun of, whether it be fra
ternities, robotics, Synergy or the ASSU. The writ
ers even trash talk The Daily, hounding a fresh
man with "Please write for the Daily, none of us
know how!"
Don't worry, various student groups. Gaieties
know that they aren't even they exempt from the
ridicule. One hounds the freshman with, "Can
you sing? Can you act? Can you dance?"
The freshman says, "No."

"Are you willing to show your titties onstage?
Join Gaieties!"
Throughout the show, it is clear that the writ
ers understood that the cast would not necessari
ly bring with them an arsenal of musical theater
skills. When asked if singing and dancing were
part of the audition form, one actor responded,
"I'm not sure, but they did ask what porn best rep
resents my life."
While the show is not completely reliant upon
sexual humor, the script has some of its best mo
ments steeped in dirty jokes, most too raunchy to
be printed. One of the most hysterical segments is
found in watching Chico State and Duke exem
plify their respective stereotypes by sexing up
with each other for virtually the entire show.
But it's not just Chico State, Duke and, of
course, Cal that are eviscerated throughout the
play. Perhaps the most wonderful thing about the
play is the taunting of the nation's other best
schools, all the while reiterating that Stanford has

the "happiest students in the world and is the
campus most photographed by Asian tourists!"
The show is rife with Stanford pride, going so far
as to declare in song, "Hogwarts isn't half as nice."
For those of you concerned about a wobbly
plotline, subpar singing and dancing, and general
chaos on stage, your fears are likely to be validat
ed. But for those of you looking for a great time,
you will not be disappointed. If one actor is just
not doing it for you, the beauty of this production
is that there will always be somebody on stage to
make you laugh, whether or not it's the focal
point of the show.The entire play is one big inside
joke and the audience will laugh together with re
flections on IHUM, a complete roasting of the
Greek system and most importantly, a pervading
hatred of Cal. As a girl in the show says, "Let's do
the Stanford-iest thing we can do ... go to Gai
eties!"

Throughout the show, it is clear that the writers understood that the cast would not necessarily bring with them an arsenal of musical theater skills. "But they did ask what pom best represents my life," one actor said.
