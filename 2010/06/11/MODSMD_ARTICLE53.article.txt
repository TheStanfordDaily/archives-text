# ISLAND OF TREASURE

It's an odd place for a music festival. Treasure Island.
A man-made pimple popped in the middle of the Bay,
the place is a San Franciscan eye sore of dilapidated low
income housing, broken basketball hoops and failed
foresight.
There's nothing buried there, save for the garbage
and muck buried in the landfill that the island was built
upon, and if it's adventure you're looking for, you'd be
better off in the Tenderloin. Commuters on the Bay
Bridge scoff every time they pass the unwelcoming,
sharp turn to Treasure Island. Who would want to go
there?
Yet every year, there is this musical gem, a two-day
pearl set in the confines of the broken place. On its third
reprise, this year's Treasure Island Music Festival
(TIMF) was about a month later than its previous coun
terpart, placing the event in the toehold of an awakening
winter instead of the embrace of a crisp fall.
If concert-goers were skeptical of the weather, no one
told Saturday, which featured among an eclectic specta
cle of electronica, hip hop and international music, as
warm as a day as you'll get in San Francisco. With the sun
beaming down, droves dressed in neon spandex and
smothered in face paint romped between the Bridge
(main) Stage and Tunnel (side) Stage, past makeshift
clothes boutiques and across the wet festival grass. The
island was their dance floor, and acts like Girl Talk,
MSTRKRFT and MGMT were there to guarantee it.
But as always, it was a tale of two days. The blustery
and chilled Sunday, was one for the subdued, a time to
break out the blankets and embrace of folk and indie
rock offering. The crowd, rougher and older, had come
for the brass of Beirut and the harmonies of Grizzly
Bear, braving the cold to be on the frontline of audio
bliss.
Concert-organizers Noise Pop and Another Planet
Entertainment were up to their usual micromanage
ment and hip detail application as well, employing
everything from refillable water stations to hipster
clothes bins to recycling education booths to appease
the progressive mindset. Not to mention the flushing
Porta-Potties as well. Sanitation! Making their returns
this year were interesting art exhibits and the 60-foot
Ferris Wheel that had lines stretching through the ven-

dor village.
As for the new, the festival's Bridge Stage featured a
giant screen, and backing LCD arch, controlled by video
mash-up artists Dubbo. Whether the videos provided vi
sual appeasement or seizures remains to be seen, howev
er, this year's most prominent addition showed that fes
tival organizers were open to tweaking the festival so as
to provide the perfect experience.
In terms of festivals it doesn't get much better than
this. The continued prevention of set overlap remains a
trademark of TIMF, and, along with the small details,
well justified the price of admission especially if you
could walk 100 yards to the other stage and watch Yo La
Tengo after spending an hour with The Decemberists.
Who thought you could find actual treasure on a
place like that? -RM
Passion Pit
Perhaps the most anticipated set of the entire festival,
indie electronic darlings Passion Pit took the main stage
early on Saturday afternoon to play for a massive crowd.
With not much material under their belt, Passion Pit has
enjoyed enormous amounts of success.
Their EP "Chunk of Change" and full-length album
"Manners" are sugar sweet, with falsetto melodies and
catchy synths. The show started with very high energy,

and the crowd had nothing but love for the inexperi
enced group.
They opened with "Make Light," and when Michael
Angelakos grabbed the microphone, it became quickly
apparent that he was the weak link to the performance.
All of the instrumentals were spot on, which is often sur
prising for an electronic band performing live. Ange
lakos' vocals left something to be desired, sadly. His mic
was turned down very low, and from the front of the pit
it was still difficult to make out what he was saying. Be
yond the sound issues, Angelakos simply was not com
mitted to his traditional falsetto.
Overall, the set was a wonderful start to the weekend,
setting the bar high for other acts. Even with flaws, this
concert proved that everybody really does love Passion
Pit. -AH
Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeroes
And God said, Let Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic
Zeroes from Paraguay be gathered together unto the Tun
nel Stage: and it was so.
While it's debatable if Edward Sharpe and the Mag
netic Zeroes were a godsend, there's no doubt they
played the part.

"It's kind of like Jesus," someone
in the crowd murmured.
Booked for a 2:30 set on Sunday,
Alex Ebert, known as Edward
Sharpe, pranced onto Treasure Is
land's main stage trailed by an assort
ment of vagabonds and kooks, deli
cately referred to as the Magnetic
Zeroes.
Drawing comparisons to Ken
Kesey and the Merry Pranksters, who
had roamed the city almost six
decades earlier, the cultish group
stood around for a few minutes grin
ning at each other and swaying be
fore embarking on their musical jour
ney.
And what a journey it was. While a
great deal of the crowd was at first
asking, "Where's the Kool-Aid?"
their doubts were largely erased as
soon as the band got rolling. From ac
cordions to glockenspiels, trumpets
to ukeleles, the group was an eclectic
surprise, packing a rich interpreta
tion of folk rock into their upbeat
songs, like "40 Day Dream."
Ebert cut an interesting figure,
fully bearded and dressed in a deep,
tie-dye V-neck, which he promptly
lost by the third song. He was very
much the charmer, baptizing the
crowd with a Dylan-esque voice as he
jumped and hollered across the stage.
Yet, it was his duet with vocalist
Jade Castrinos that captured the
hearts of the Treasure Island crowd
as the two shared memories of Al
abama, friendship and good times in
"Home," as they sang "Home, let me
come home, home is when I'm alone
with you."
On that island, it was love of bibli
cal proportions. -RM
Flaming Lips
The Flaming Lips are every bit as
legendary as people say they are.
Known for their famous UFO shows,
the Flaming Lips did not disappoint
as the closing act of the festival on
Sunday night.
With a bright orange set, bright or
ange roadies, and a huge bright or
ange screen, the experience was
clearly a visual overload. Opening
with NSFW graphic in the back
ground, each of the Lips emerged
from the enormous, flashing vagina
on the screen.

That is, all of the Lips except
Wayne Coyne, the frontman and vi
sionary. Instead, he rolled out in his
customary giant plastic bubble, and
proceeded to walk in it all over the
enormous crowd. After he made it
back on stage, the band launched into
"Race For the Prize," complete with
lucky fans dressed as bears dancing in
the background.

Confetti cannons and balloons
added to the already stimulating ex
perience. A man dressed in a bunny
suit began to crowd surf, and in the
process landing on a bystander, caus
ing paramedics to infiltrate the pit. It
was this uncontrollable excitement
and frenzy lasted throughout the en
tire set. Wayne suggested that the au
dience just stay and "take over Trea
sure Island." Trust me, Wayne ... if
we could, we would. -AH
Girl Talk
Arguably one of the most antici
pated and hyped performers of the
weekend, Gregg Gillis, aka Girl Talk,
brought the energy and excitement
to the Treasure Island Music Festival.
By bringing audience members (like
some Intermission staff) onstage and
getting the crowd involved through
props, such as toilet paper, popcorn,
and balloons. Girl Talk's perform
ance seemed more like a party than a
concert.
To say that being in the audience
is an "experience" would be an un
derstatement. I have never in my life
been in a crowd this rowdy, aggres
sive, and out of control. People were
stepping on me, shoving me, literally
infiltrating the space I was inhabiting,
and the only way I could react was to
do the same. Although Girl Talk
spent a lot of the time focused on his
computers to play his tracks, the time
he spent dancing and acting crazy re
flected the crowd, bringing the al
ready overwhelming enthusiasm
even higher.
While I'm not exactly sure what
his talent is, it's evident that whatever
Girl Talk is doing seems to be right.
Regardless of how crazy and fun Girl
Talk himself behaves, his songs act on
their own, presenting a dynamic
sound that resonates in the crowd,
and never cease to be catchy and re
ally damn popular. -CS
MSTRKRFT
Last year, two individuals sporting
black jackets, five o'clock stubble and
crossed forearms conquered the
Bridge Stage with a brand of power
electronic that shook the island and
its audience to the core.
So when Canadian-duo
MSTRKRFT took the stage at 7:45,
they had a hole to fill, a Justice-sized
hole that was. But it's not like they
cared. They were going to do it their
own way and, lugging a massive bot
tle of Crown Royal Whiskey, they
proved it with every swig.
It was liquid confidence and elec
tronic at its finest, as Jesse Keeler and
Al-P assaulted the crowd with charac
teristic synth blasts and heavy percus
sion of drum machines. Using their
newest album "Fist of God" as a plat
form, the duo built their set around
hits like "Bounce" and "Heartbreak
er," incorporated cuts of everything
from Daft Punk to Benny Benassi. A

full remix of Justice's
"D.A.N.C.E" was thrown in for
memory's sake as well.
For entertainment's sake,
MSTRKRFT provided everything
they were billed to do. It was sheer
electronic energy backed by dizzying
visuals, and the crowd, uninhibited by
the cold, welcomed it with raised
hands and screams for every song
they recognized.
And while the pair didn't have to
do much in terms of creativity to pla
cate the hordes, the shrewdest move
of the night came when they closed
with a remix of Queen's "Bohemian
Rhapsody," a tribute to the late DJ
A.M. who often used the song in his
own sets. It was a calculated move
and it worked to perfection as thou
sands performed their best Freddy
Mercury falsettos to the exiting duo
before rushing off to Girl Talk. -RM
Grizzly Bear
With the wind whipping at 4 p.m., a
tired looking Brooklyn quartet saun
tered on to the Bridge Stage. Looking
more prepared for winter hibernation
than a 45-minute set, the members of
Grizzly Bear lined up across the stage
and lazily surveyed a capacity crowd.
The masses had no idea how to
react. They'd read the fuss about the
band's newest album "Veckatimest."
They knew Radiohead had declared
them their new favorite band. They
heard about Jay-Z personally attend
ing one of their shows with Beyonce in
tow. But who, what, how is Grizzly
Bear?
All it took was one harmony, one
warm, layered mix of vocals to make
the crowd realize.
Opening with "Cheerleader," the
band introduced their brand of ex
perimental brand of indie rock, waft
ing it gently toward the crowd in a
combination of mellowed guitar riffs,
relaxed percussion and all the oohs
and ahs that would make a church
choir proud.
In the middle of the day, Grizzly
Bear was the calming presence be
tween the cultish energy of Edward
Sharpe and the brass of Beirut.
"Hang on, slow down," the band
seemed to explain.
So the crowd listened, transfixed
as the band went through "Southern
Point" and "The Knife." By the time
"Two Weeks" was played, judging by
the amount of interpretative dance
going on, the crowd had bought into
the band's brooding charm. And with
the sun shining from the west in its
first appearance of the day, it seemed
like Mother Nature agreed.
Add them to your growing list of
admirers, Grizzly Bear. -RM

The Limousines
The first 34 minutes of the week
end could not have been better.
Eric Victorino and Giovanni
Giusti, the Bay Area pair known as

The Limousines, were charged with
one of the most difficult music festi
val responsibilities: breaking in the
main stage on opening day. But for
those hundred or so fortunate
enough to arrive on the island early
enough, it was electrifyingly clear
The Limousines may just be the next
big in the electro-alternative scene.
With no instruments, the pair relies
on the force and, when appropriate,
the sensitivity of Victorino's voice.
And on Saturday, Victorino was spot
on, nearly identical to the pair's
recordings of "Dancing at Her Funer
al" and "New Year's Resolution."
The Limousines' single "Very Busy
People" has undoubtedly been their
ticket into the Treasure Island-cal
iber arena, and Saturday's perform
ance ensures the pair are poised to
explode onto the larger scene as soon
as they can push out an EP or full
length album. -DB
The Decemberists
The chill in the air disappeared
Sunday evening when The Decem
berists told us a love story.
A dark stage. Gold specks on the
LCD screen. These were just the be
ginnings of one of the most treasured
hours of the weekend. And as the
band lay down the first chord of their
latest album, "The Hazards of Love,"
the crowd knew they were in not for
a trick —as some believed upon
hearing that the group would be per
forming only "Hazards," from begin
ning to end but for a treat.Re
leased in March to widespread ac
claim, the album is a musical love
story unlike any other: Layered with
heavy-metal thunder, breezy
acoustics, orchestral interludes and a
children's choir, the 14-track collec
tion tells the story of get this a
maiden knocked up by an amor
phous forest beast-fiancee.
And Sunday night could not have
been a better time to perform and
to listen to the love story as told by
the five from Portland. With the for
est story playing out on the screen be
hind them, The Decemberists,
decked out in all black, were juggling
guitars, accordions and upright bass
es throughout the hour-long sere
nade. Frontman Colin Meloy's fa
mously nasal tone was spot-on, aside
from the water break he took during
"The Hazards of Love 3 (Re
venge!)," and the group maintained a
captivated audience for the entire
set, leaving the crowd wide-eyed and
still as they left the stage.
The Decemberists play this week
end in their hometown of Portland
before heading to Europe and Aus
tralia until February. -DB

sharp turn to Treasure Island. Who would want to go
there?
Yet every year, there is this musical gem, a two-day
pearl set in the confines of the broken place. On its third
reprise, this year's Treasure Island Music Festival
(TIMF) was about a month later than its previous coun
terpart, placing the event in the toehold of an awakening
winter instead of the embrace of a crisp fall.
If concert-goers were skeptical of the weather, no one
told Saturday, which featured among an eclectic specta
cle of electronica, hip hop and international music, as
warm as a day as you'll get in San Francisco. With the sun
beaming down, droves dressed in neon spandex and
smothered in face paint romped between the Bridge
(main) Stage and Tunnel (side) Stage, past makeshift
clothes boutiques and across the wet festival grass. The
island was their dance floor, and acts like Girl Talk,
MSTRKRFT and MGMT were there to guarantee it.
But as always, it was a tale of two days. The blustery
and chilled Sunday, was one for the subdued, a time to
break out the blankets and embrace of folk and indie
rock offering. The crowd, rougher and older, had come
for the brass of Beirut and the harmonies of Grizzly
Bear, braving the cold to be on the frontline of audio
bliss.
Concert-organizers Noise Pop and Another Planet
Entertainment were up to their usual micromanage
ment and hip detail application as well, employing
everything from refillable water stations to hipster
clothes bins to recycling education booths to appease
the progressive mindset. Not to mention the flushing
Porta-Potties as well. Sanitation! Making their returns

dor village.
As for the new, the festival's Bridge Stage featured a
giant screen, and backing LCD arch, controlled by video
mash-up artists Dubbo. Whether the videos provided vi
sual appeasement or seizures remains to be seen, howev
er, this year's most prominent addition showed that fes
tival organizers were open to tweaking the festival so as
to provide the perfect experience.
In terms of festivals it doesn't get much better than
this. The continued prevention of set overlap remains a
trademark of TIMF, and, along with the small details,
well justified the price of admission especially if you
could walk 100 yards to the other stage and watch Yo La
Tengo after spending an hour with The Decemberists.
Who thought you could find actual treasure on a
place like that? -RM
Passion Pit
Perhaps the most anticipated set of the entire festival,
indie electronic darlings Passion Pit took the main stage
early on Saturday afternoon to play for a massive crowd.
With not much material under their belt, Passion Pit has
enjoyed enormous amounts of success.
Their EP "Chunk of Change" and full-length album
"Manners" are sugar sweet, with falsetto melodies and
catchy synths. The show started with very high energy,

and the crowd had nothing but love for the inexperi
enced group.
They opened with "Make Light," and when Michael
Angelakos grabbed the microphone, it became quickly
apparent that he was the weak link to the performance.
All of the instrumentals were spot on, which is often sur
prising for an electronic band performing live. Ange
lakos' vocals left something to be desired, sadly. His mic
was turned down very low, and from the front of the pit
it was still difficult to make out what he was saying. Be
yond the sound issues, Angelakos simply was not com
mitted to his traditional falsetto.
Overall, the set was a wonderful start to the weekend,
setting the bar high for other acts. Even with flaws, this
concert proved that everybody really does love Passion
Pit. -AH
Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeroes
And God said, Let Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic
Zeroes from Paraguay be gathered together unto the Tun
nel Stage: and it was so.
While it's debatable if Edward Sharpe and the Mag
netic Zeroes were a godsend, there's no doubt they
played the part.

"It's kind of like Jesus," someone
in the crowd murmured.
Booked for a 2:30 set on Sunday,
Alex Ebert, known as Edward
Sharpe, pranced onto Treasure Is
land's main stage trailed by an assort
ment of vagabonds and kooks, deli
cately referred to as the Magnetic
Zeroes.
Drawing comparisons to Ken
Kesey and the Merry Pranksters, who
had roamed the city almost six
decades earlier, the cultish group
stood around for a few minutes grin
ning at each other and swaying be
fore embarking on their musical jour
ney.
And what a journey it was. While a
great deal of the crowd was at first
asking, "Where's the Kool-Aid?"
their doubts were largely erased as
soon as the band got rolling. From ac
cordions to glockenspiels, trumpets
to ukeleles, the group was an eclectic
surprise, packing a rich interpreta
tion of folk rock into their upbeat
songs, like "40 Day Dream."
Ebert cut an interesting figure,
fully bearded and dressed in a deep,
tie-dye V-neck, which he promptly
lost by the third song. He was very
much the charmer, baptizing the
crowd with a Dylan-esque voice as he
jumped and hollered across the stage.
Yet, it was his duet with vocalist
Jade Castrinos that captured the
hearts of the Treasure Island crowd
as the two shared memories of Al
abama, friendship and good times in
"Home," as they sang "Home, let me
come home, home is when I'm alone
with you."
On that island, it was love of bibli
cal proportions. -RM
Flaming Lips
The Flaming Lips are every bit as
legendary as people say they are.
Known for their famous UFO shows,
the Flaming Lips did not disappoint
as the closing act of the festival on
Sunday night.
With a bright orange set, bright or
ange roadies, and a huge bright or
ange screen, the experience was
clearly a visual overload. Opening
with NSFW graphic in the back
ground, each of the Lips emerged
from the enormous, flashing vagina
on the screen.

That is, all of the Lips except
Wayne Coyne, the frontman and vi
sionary. Instead, he rolled out in his
customary giant plastic bubble, and
proceeded to walk in it all over the
enormous crowd. After he made it
back on stage, the band launched into
"Race For the Prize," complete with
lucky fans dressed as bears dancing in
the background.

Confetti cannons and balloons
added to the already stimulating ex
perience. A man dressed in a bunny
suit began to crowd surf, and in the
process landing on a bystander, caus
ing paramedics to infiltrate the pit. It
was this uncontrollable excitement
and frenzy lasted throughout the en
tire set. Wayne suggested that the au
dience just stay and "take over Trea
sure Island." Trust me, Wayne ... if
we could, we would. -AH
Girl Talk
Arguably one of the most antici
pated and hyped performers of the
weekend, Gregg Gillis, aka Girl Talk,
brought the energy and excitement
to the Treasure Island Music Festival.
By bringing audience members (like
some Intermission staff) onstage and
getting the crowd involved through
props, such as toilet paper, popcorn,
and balloons. Girl Talk's perform
ance seemed more like a party than a
concert.
To say that being in the audience
is an "experience" would be an un
derstatement. I have never in my life
been in a crowd this rowdy, aggres
sive, and out of control. People were
stepping on me, shoving me, literally
infiltrating the space I was inhabiting,
and the only way I could react was to
do the same. Although Girl Talk
spent a lot of the time focused on his
computers to play his tracks, the time
he spent dancing and acting crazy re
flected the crowd, bringing the al
ready overwhelming enthusiasm
even higher.
While I'm not exactly sure what
his talent is, it's evident that whatever
Girl Talk is doing seems to be right.
Regardless of how crazy and fun Girl
Talk himself behaves, his songs act on
their own, presenting a dynamic
sound that resonates in the crowd,
and never cease to be catchy and re
ally damn popular. -CS
MSTRKRFT
Last year, two individuals sporting
black jackets, five o'clock stubble and
crossed forearms conquered the
Bridge Stage with a brand of power
electronic that shook the island and
its audience to the core.
So when Canadian-duo
MSTRKRFT took the stage at 7:45,
they had a hole to fill, a Justice-sized
hole that was. But it's not like they
cared. They were going to do it their
own way and, lugging a massive bot
tle of Crown Royal Whiskey, they
proved it with every swig.
It was liquid confidence and elec
tronic at its finest, as Jesse Keeler and
Al-P assaulted the crowd with charac
teristic synth blasts and heavy percus
sion of drum machines. Using their
newest album "Fist of God" as a plat
form, the duo built their set around
hits like "Bounce" and "Heartbreak
er," incorporated cuts of everything
from Daft Punk to Benny Benassi. A

full remix of Justice's
"D.A.N.C.E" was thrown in for
memory's sake as well.
For entertainment's sake,
MSTRKRFT provided everything
they were billed to do. It was sheer
electronic energy backed by dizzying
visuals, and the crowd, uninhibited by
the cold, welcomed it with raised
hands and screams for every song
they recognized.
And while the pair didn't have to
do much in terms of creativity to pla
cate the hordes, the shrewdest move
of the night came when they closed
with a remix of Queen's "Bohemian
Rhapsody," a tribute to the late DJ
A.M. who often used the song in his
own sets. It was a calculated move
and it worked to perfection as thou
sands performed their best Freddy
Mercury falsettos to the exiting duo
before rushing off to Girl Talk. -RM
Grizzly Bear
With the wind whipping at 4 p.m., a
tired looking Brooklyn quartet saun
tered on to the Bridge Stage. Looking
more prepared for winter hibernation
than a 45-minute set, the members of
Grizzly Bear lined up across the stage
and lazily surveyed a capacity crowd.
The masses had no idea how to
react. They'd read the fuss about the
band's newest album "Veckatimest."
They knew Radiohead had declared
them their new favorite band. They
heard about Jay-Z personally attend
ing one of their shows with Beyonce in
tow. But who, what, how is Grizzly
Bear?
All it took was one harmony, one
warm, layered mix of vocals to make
the crowd realize.
Opening with "Cheerleader," the
band introduced their brand of ex
perimental brand of indie rock, waft
ing it gently toward the crowd in a
combination of mellowed guitar riffs,
relaxed percussion and all the oohs
and ahs that would make a church
choir proud.
In the middle of the day, Grizzly
Bear was the calming presence be
tween the cultish energy of Edward
Sharpe and the brass of Beirut.
"Hang on, slow down," the band
seemed to explain.
So the crowd listened, transfixed
as the band went through "Southern
Point" and "The Knife." By the time
"Two Weeks" was played, judging by
the amount of interpretative dance
going on, the crowd had bought into
the band's brooding charm. And with
the sun shining from the west in its
first appearance of the day, it seemed
like Mother Nature agreed.
Add them to your growing list of
admirers, Grizzly Bear. -RM

The Limousines
The first 34 minutes of the week
end could not have been better.
Eric Victorino and Giovanni
Giusti, the Bay Area pair known as

The Limousines, were charged with
one of the most difficult music festi
val responsibilities: breaking in the
main stage on opening day. But for
those hundred or so fortunate
enough to arrive on the island early
enough, it was electrifyingly clear
The Limousines may just be the next
big in the electro-alternative scene.
With no instruments, the pair relies
on the force and, when appropriate,
the sensitivity of Victorino's voice.
And on Saturday, Victorino was spot
on, nearly identical to the pair's
recordings of "Dancing at Her Funer
al" and "New Year's Resolution."
The Limousines' single "Very Busy
People" has undoubtedly been their
ticket into the Treasure Island-cal
iber arena, and Saturday's perform
ance ensures the pair are poised to
explode onto the larger scene as soon
as they can push out an EP or full
length album. -DB
The Decemberists
The chill in the air disappeared
Sunday evening when The Decem
berists told us a love story.
A dark stage. Gold specks on the
LCD screen. These were just the be
ginnings of one of the most treasured
hours of the weekend. And as the
band lay down the first chord of their
latest album, "The Hazards of Love,"
the crowd knew they were in not for
a trick —as some believed upon
hearing that the group would be per
forming only "Hazards," from begin
ning to end but for a treat.Re
leased in March to widespread ac
claim, the album is a musical love
story unlike any other: Layered with
heavy-metal thunder, breezy
acoustics, orchestral interludes and a
children's choir, the 14-track collec
tion tells the story of get this a
maiden knocked up by an amor
phous forest beast-fiancee.
And Sunday night could not have
been a better time to perform and
to listen to the love story as told by
the five from Portland. With the for
est story playing out on the screen be
hind them, The Decemberists,
decked out in all black, were juggling
guitars, accordions and upright bass
es throughout the hour-long sere
nade. Frontman Colin Meloy's fa
mously nasal tone was spot-on, aside
from the water break he took during
"The Hazards of Love 3 (Re
venge!)," and the group maintained a
captivated audience for the entire
set, leaving the crowd wide-eyed and
still as they left the stage.
The Decemberists play this week
end in their hometown of Portland
before heading to Europe and Aus
tralia until February. -DB

As for the new, the festival's Bridge Stage featured a
giant screen, and backing LCD arch, controlled by video
mash-up artists Dubbo. Whether the videos provided vi

Who thought you could find actual treasure on a
place like that? -RM
Passion Pit
Perhaps the most anticipated set of the entire festival,
indie electronic darlings Passion Pit took the main stage
early on Saturday afternoon to play for a massive crowd.
With not much material under their belt, Passion Pit has
enjoyed enormous amounts of success.
Their EP "Chunk of Change" and full-length album
"Manners" are sugar sweet, with falsetto melodies and
catchy synths. The show started with very high energy,

and the crowd had nothing but love for the inexperi
enced group.
They opened with "Make Light," and when Michael
Angelakos grabbed the microphone, it became quickly
apparent that he was the weak link to the performance.
All of the instrumentals were spot on, which is often sur
prising for an electronic band performing live. Ange
lakos' vocals left something to be desired, sadly. His mic
was turned down very low, and from the front of the pit
it was still difficult to make out what he was saying. Be
yond the sound issues, Angelakos simply was not com
mitted to his traditional falsetto.
Overall, the set was a wonderful start to the weekend,
setting the bar high for other acts. Even with flaws, this
concert proved that everybody really does love Passion
Pit. -AH
Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeroes
And God said, Let Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic
Zeroes from Paraguay be gathered together unto the Tun
nel Stage: and it was so.
While it's debatable if Edward Sharpe and the Mag
netic Zeroes were a godsend, there's no doubt they
played the part.

"It's kind of like Jesus," someone
in the crowd murmured.
Booked for a 2:30 set on Sunday,
Alex Ebert, known as Edward
Sharpe, pranced onto Treasure Is
land's main stage trailed by an assort
ment of vagabonds and kooks, deli
cately referred to as the Magnetic
Zeroes.
Drawing comparisons to Ken
Kesey and the Merry Pranksters, who
had roamed the city almost six
decades earlier, the cultish group
stood around for a few minutes grin
ning at each other and swaying be
fore embarking on their musical jour
ney.
And what a journey it was. While a
great deal of the crowd was at first
asking, "Where's the Kool-Aid?"
their doubts were largely erased as
soon as the band got rolling. From ac
cordions to glockenspiels, trumpets
to ukeleles, the group was an eclectic
surprise, packing a rich interpreta
tion of folk rock into their upbeat
songs, like "40 Day Dream."
Ebert cut an interesting figure,
fully bearded and dressed in a deep,
tie-dye V-neck, which he promptly
lost by the third song. He was very
much the charmer, baptizing the
crowd with a Dylan-esque voice as he
jumped and hollered across the stage.
Yet, it was his duet with vocalist
Jade Castrinos that captured the
hearts of the Treasure Island crowd
as the two shared memories of Al
abama, friendship and good times in
"Home," as they sang "Home, let me
come home, home is when I'm alone
with you."
On that island, it was love of bibli
cal proportions. -RM
Flaming Lips
The Flaming Lips are every bit as
legendary as people say they are.
Known for their famous UFO shows,
the Flaming Lips did not disappoint
as the closing act of the festival on
Sunday night.
With a bright orange set, bright or
ange roadies, and a huge bright or
ange screen, the experience was
clearly a visual overload. Opening
with NSFW graphic in the back
ground, each of the Lips emerged
from the enormous, flashing vagina
on the screen.

That is, all of the Lips except
Wayne Coyne, the frontman and vi
sionary. Instead, he rolled out in his
customary giant plastic bubble, and
proceeded to walk in it all over the
enormous crowd. After he made it
back on stage, the band launched into
"Race For the Prize," complete with
lucky fans dressed as bears dancing in
the background.

Confetti cannons and balloons
added to the already stimulating ex
perience. A man dressed in a bunny
suit began to crowd surf, and in the
process landing on a bystander, caus
ing paramedics to infiltrate the pit. It
was this uncontrollable excitement
and frenzy lasted throughout the en
tire set. Wayne suggested that the au
dience just stay and "take over Trea
sure Island." Trust me, Wayne ... if
we could, we would. -AH
Girl Talk
Arguably one of the most antici
pated and hyped performers of the
weekend, Gregg Gillis, aka Girl Talk,
brought the energy and excitement
to the Treasure Island Music Festival.
By bringing audience members (like
some Intermission staff) onstage and
getting the crowd involved through
props, such as toilet paper, popcorn,
and balloons. Girl Talk's perform
ance seemed more like a party than a
concert.
To say that being in the audience
is an "experience" would be an un
derstatement. I have never in my life
been in a crowd this rowdy, aggres
sive, and out of control. People were
stepping on me, shoving me, literally
infiltrating the space I was inhabiting,
and the only way I could react was to
do the same. Although Girl Talk
spent a lot of the time focused on his
computers to play his tracks, the time
he spent dancing and acting crazy re
flected the crowd, bringing the al
ready overwhelming enthusiasm
even higher.
While I'm not exactly sure what
his talent is, it's evident that whatever
Girl Talk is doing seems to be right.
Regardless of how crazy and fun Girl
Talk himself behaves, his songs act on
their own, presenting a dynamic
sound that resonates in the crowd,
and never cease to be catchy and re
ally damn popular. -CS
MSTRKRFT
Last year, two individuals sporting
black jackets, five o'clock stubble and
crossed forearms conquered the
Bridge Stage with a brand of power
electronic that shook the island and
its audience to the core.
So when Canadian-duo
MSTRKRFT took the stage at 7:45,
they had a hole to fill, a Justice-sized
hole that was. But it's not like they
cared. They were going to do it their
own way and, lugging a massive bot
tle of Crown Royal Whiskey, they
proved it with every swig.
It was liquid confidence and elec
tronic at its finest, as Jesse Keeler and
Al-P assaulted the crowd with charac
teristic synth blasts and heavy percus
sion of drum machines. Using their
newest album "Fist of God" as a plat
form, the duo built their set around
hits like "Bounce" and "Heartbreak
er," incorporated cuts of everything
from Daft Punk to Benny Benassi. A

full remix of Justice's
"D.A.N.C.E" was thrown in for
memory's sake as well.
For entertainment's sake,
MSTRKRFT provided everything
they were billed to do. It was sheer
electronic energy backed by dizzying
visuals, and the crowd, uninhibited by
the cold, welcomed it with raised
hands and screams for every song
they recognized.
And while the pair didn't have to
do much in terms of creativity to pla
cate the hordes, the shrewdest move
of the night came when they closed
with a remix of Queen's "Bohemian
Rhapsody," a tribute to the late DJ
A.M. who often used the song in his
own sets. It was a calculated move
and it worked to perfection as thou
sands performed their best Freddy
Mercury falsettos to the exiting duo
before rushing off to Girl Talk. -RM
Grizzly Bear
With the wind whipping at 4 p.m., a
tired looking Brooklyn quartet saun
tered on to the Bridge Stage. Looking
more prepared for winter hibernation
than a 45-minute set, the members of
Grizzly Bear lined up across the stage
and lazily surveyed a capacity crowd.
The masses had no idea how to
react. They'd read the fuss about the
band's newest album "Veckatimest."
They knew Radiohead had declared
them their new favorite band. They
heard about Jay-Z personally attend
ing one of their shows with Beyonce in
tow. But who, what, how is Grizzly
Bear?
All it took was one harmony, one
warm, layered mix of vocals to make
the crowd realize.
Opening with "Cheerleader," the
band introduced their brand of ex
perimental brand of indie rock, waft
ing it gently toward the crowd in a
combination of mellowed guitar riffs,
relaxed percussion and all the oohs
and ahs that would make a church
choir proud.
In the middle of the day, Grizzly
Bear was the calming presence be
tween the cultish energy of Edward
Sharpe and the brass of Beirut.
"Hang on, slow down," the band
seemed to explain.
So the crowd listened, transfixed
as the band went through "Southern
Point" and "The Knife." By the time
"Two Weeks" was played, judging by
the amount of interpretative dance
going on, the crowd had bought into
the band's brooding charm. And with
the sun shining from the west in its
first appearance of the day, it seemed
like Mother Nature agreed.
Add them to your growing list of
admirers, Grizzly Bear. -RM

The Limousines
The first 34 minutes of the week
end could not have been better.
Eric Victorino and Giovanni
Giusti, the Bay Area pair known as

The Limousines, were charged with
one of the most difficult music festi
val responsibilities: breaking in the
main stage on opening day. But for
those hundred or so fortunate
enough to arrive on the island early
enough, it was electrifyingly clear
The Limousines may just be the next
big in the electro-alternative scene.
With no instruments, the pair relies
on the force and, when appropriate,
the sensitivity of Victorino's voice.
And on Saturday, Victorino was spot
on, nearly identical to the pair's
recordings of "Dancing at Her Funer
al" and "New Year's Resolution."
The Limousines' single "Very Busy
People" has undoubtedly been their
ticket into the Treasure Island-cal
iber arena, and Saturday's perform
ance ensures the pair are poised to
explode onto the larger scene as soon
as they can push out an EP or full
length album. -DB
The Decemberists
The chill in the air disappeared
Sunday evening when The Decem
berists told us a love story.
A dark stage. Gold specks on the
LCD screen. These were just the be
ginnings of one of the most treasured
hours of the weekend. And as the
band lay down the first chord of their
latest album, "The Hazards of Love,"
the crowd knew they were in not for
a trick —as some believed upon
hearing that the group would be per
forming only "Hazards," from begin
ning to end but for a treat.Re
leased in March to widespread ac
claim, the album is a musical love
story unlike any other: Layered with
heavy-metal thunder, breezy
acoustics, orchestral interludes and a
children's choir, the 14-track collec
tion tells the story of get this a
maiden knocked up by an amor
phous forest beast-fiancee.
And Sunday night could not have
been a better time to perform and
to listen to the love story as told by
the five from Portland. With the for
est story playing out on the screen be
hind them, The Decemberists,
decked out in all black, were juggling
guitars, accordions and upright bass
es throughout the hour-long sere
nade. Frontman Colin Meloy's fa
mously nasal tone was spot-on, aside
from the water break he took during
"The Hazards of Love 3 (Re
venge!)," and the group maintained a
captivated audience for the entire
set, leaving the crowd wide-eyed and
still as they left the stage.
The Decemberists play this week
end in their hometown of Portland
before heading to Europe and Aus
tralia until February. -DB

Originally published on Oct. 23,2009.

It's an odd place for a music festival. Treasure Island.
A man-made pimple popped in the middle of the Bay,
the place is a San Franciscan eye sore of dilapidated low
income housing, broken basketball hoops and failed
foresight.
There's nothing buried there, save for the garbage
and muck buried in the landfill that the island was built
upon, and if it's adventure you're looking for, you'd be
better off in the Tenderloin. Commuters on the Bay
Bridge scoff every time they pass the unwelcoming,
sharp turn to Treasure Island. Who would want to go
there?
Yet every year, there is this musical gem, a two-day
pearl set in the confines of the broken place. On its third
reprise, this year's Treasure Island Music Festival
(TIMF) was about a month later than its previous coun
terpart, placing the event in the toehold of an awakening
winter instead of the embrace of a crisp fall.
If concert-goers were skeptical of the weather, no one
told Saturday, which featured among an eclectic specta
cle of electronica, hip hop and international music, as
warm as a day as you'll get in San Francisco. With the sun
beaming down, droves dressed in neon spandex and
smothered in face paint romped between the Bridge
(main) Stage and Tunnel (side) Stage, past makeshift
clothes boutiques and across the wet festival grass. The
