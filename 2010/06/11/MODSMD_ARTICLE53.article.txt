It's an odd place for a music festival. Treasure Island.
A man-made pimple popped in the middle of the Bay,
the place is a San Franciscan eye sore of dilapidated low
income housing, broken basketball hoops and failed
foresight.
There's nothing buried there, save for the garbage
and muck buried in the landfill that the island was built
upon, and if it's adventure you're looking for, you'd be
better off in the Tenderloin. Commuters on the Bay
Bridge scoff every time they pass the unwelcoming,
sharp turn to Treasure Island. Who would want to go
there?
Yet every year, there is this musical gem, a two-day
pearl set in the confines of the broken place. On its third
reprise, this year's Treasure Island Music Festival
(TIMF) was about a month later than its previous coun
terpart, placing the event in the toehold of an awakening
winter instead of the embrace of a crisp fall.
If concert-goers were skeptical of the weather, no one
told Saturday, which featured among an eclectic specta
cle of electronica, hip hop and international music, as
warm as a day as you'll get in San Francisco. With the sun
beaming down, droves dressed in neon spandex and
smothered in face paint romped between the Bridge
(main) Stage and Tunnel (side) Stage, past makeshift
clothes boutiques and across the wet festival grass. The
island was their dance floor, and acts like Girl Talk,
MSTRKRFT and MGMT were there to guarantee it.
But as always, it was a tale of two days. The blustery
and chilled Sunday, was one for the subdued, a time to
break out the blankets and embrace of folk and indie
rock offering. The crowd, rougher and older, had come
for the brass of Beirut and the harmonies of Grizzly
Bear, braving the cold to be on the frontline of audio
bliss.
Concert-organizers Noise Pop and Another Planet
Entertainment were up to their usual micromanage
ment and hip detail application as well, employing
everything from refillable water stations to hipster
clothes bins to recycling education booths to appease
the progressive mindset. Not to mention the flushing
Porta-Potties as well. Sanitation! Making their returns

dor village.
As for the new, the festival's Bridge Stage featured a
giant screen, and backing LCD arch, controlled by video
mash-up artists Dubbo. Whether the videos provided vi
sual appeasement or seizures remains to be seen, howev
er, this year's most prominent addition showed that fes
tival organizers were open to tweaking the festival so as
to provide the perfect experience.
In terms of festivals it doesn't get much better than
this. The continued prevention of set overlap remains a
trademark of TIMF, and, along with the small details,
well justified the price of admission especially if you
could walk 100 yards to the other stage and watch Yo La
Tengo after spending an hour with The Decemberists.
Who thought you could find actual treasure on a
place like that? -RM
Passion Pit
Perhaps the most anticipated set of the entire festival,
indie electronic darlings Passion Pit took the main stage
early on Saturday afternoon to play for a massive crowd.
With not much material under their belt, Passion Pit has
enjoyed enormous amounts of success.
Their EP "Chunk of Change" and full-length album
"Manners" are sugar sweet, with falsetto melodies and
catchy synths. The show started with very high energy,

and the crowd had nothing but love for the inexperi
enced group.
They opened with "Make Light," and when Michael
Angelakos grabbed the microphone, it became quickly
apparent that he was the weak link to the performance.
All of the instrumentals were spot on, which is often sur
prising for an electronic band performing live. Ange
lakos' vocals left something to be desired, sadly. His mic
was turned down very low, and from the front of the pit
it was still difficult to make out what he was saying. Be
yond the sound issues, Angelakos simply was not com
mitted to his traditional falsetto.
Overall, the set was a wonderful start to the weekend,
setting the bar high for other acts. Even with flaws, this
concert proved that everybody really does love Passion
Pit. -AH
Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeroes
And God said, Let Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic
Zeroes from Paraguay be gathered together unto the Tun
nel Stage: and it was so.
While it's debatable if Edward Sharpe and the Mag
netic Zeroes were a godsend, there's no doubt they
played the part.
