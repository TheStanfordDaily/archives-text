The buzz has been heavy ever since Stanford Drama
made the announcement last fall.
It's finally here: Professor Harry Elam Jr. directs the
Tony Award-winning "RENT." The drama department's
first musical in decades plays at Roble Studio Theater
for the next two weekends.
Based off of Biacomo Puccini's opera "La Boheme,"
Jonathan Larson's musical chronicles a year in the life of
seven friends living the disappearing Bohemian lifestyle
of New York's East Village under the shadow of the
AIDS epidemic.
With the recent memory of the "RENT" national
tour in San Francisco earlier in the school year, one may
be tempted to draw unjust comparisons to Stanford's
production. However, the Stanford drama department
puts on a thoroughly enjoyable show with capable per
formances and high production quality.
The sheer popularity of "RENT," with a devoted fan
base of self-proclaimed "Rent-heads," makes it a tricky
musical to pull off. Its iconic nature speaks for itself: this
past fall quarter, director Elam and Stanford Drama re
ceived unprecedented interest, with over 100 students
auditioning for 18 parts.
The final main cast is solid overall, peppered with
several brilliant performances. Much like an opera, most
of the story of "RENT" unfolds through the use of song,
and for that, plenty of raw talent is required.
Chris Kucharczyk 'll plays Mark, the filmmaker at
the heart of the musical's narrative, with a refreshingly
natural ease. Maureen, performer and diva extraordi
naire, enters on a roaring motorcycle and Brittany
Vasquez 'll backs up her loud entrance with strong vo
cals to match. Her rendition of "Over the Moon" is
feisty, with appropriate amounts of sass and vitriol. Sur
prisingly, Ronnie Tisdale 'lO brings minor character
Benny to life, giving depth to the friend-turned-land
lord.
Sophomore Bronwyn Reed's sweet and sultry Mimi
comes alive in "Out Tonight," and her vocal abilities are
put to good use in the haunting ballad "Without You."
While senior Luke Taylor's Roger can be pitchy at times,
his portrayal of the laid back rocker with an undercur
rent of torment is spot-on. He and costar Reed endow
Roger and Mimi with a flirtatious and believable chem
istry. Cameron Drake 'lO, Jamie Cornejo 'lO and An
jarae Washington 'O9 all put in fine vocal performances
as Collins, Angel and Joanne, respectively.
While certain small numbers are lacking in dynamism,
serving as plot progression rather than showstoppers, the
