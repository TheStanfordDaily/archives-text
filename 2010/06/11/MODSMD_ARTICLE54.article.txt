The buzz has been heavy ever since Stanford Drama
made the announcement last fall.
It's finally here: Professor Harry Elam Jr. directs the
Tony Award-winning "RENT." The drama department's
first musical in decades plays at Roble Studio Theater
for the next two weekends.
Based off of Biacomo Puccini's opera "La Boheme,"
Jonathan Larson's musical chronicles a year in the life of
seven friends living the disappearing Bohemian lifestyle
of New York's East Village under the shadow of the
AIDS epidemic.
With the recent memory of the "RENT" national
tour in San Francisco earlier in the school year, one may
be tempted to draw unjust comparisons to Stanford's
production. However, the Stanford drama department
puts on a thoroughly enjoyable show with capable per
formances and high production quality.
The sheer popularity of "RENT," with a devoted fan
base of self-proclaimed "Rent-heads," makes it a tricky
musical to pull off. Its iconic nature speaks for itself: this
past fall quarter, director Elam and Stanford Drama re
ceived unprecedented interest, with over 100 students
auditioning for 18 parts.
The final main cast is solid overall, peppered with
several brilliant performances. Much like an opera, most
of the story of "RENT" unfolds through the use of song,
and for that, plenty of raw talent is required.
Chris Kucharczyk 'll plays Mark, the filmmaker at
the heart of the musical's narrative, with a refreshingly
natural ease. Maureen, performer and diva extraordi
naire, enters on a roaring motorcycle and Brittany
Vasquez 'll backs up her loud entrance with strong vo
cals to match. Her rendition of "Over the Moon" is
feisty, with appropriate amounts of sass and vitriol. Sur
prisingly, Ronnie Tisdale 'lO brings minor character
Benny to life, giving depth to the friend-turned-land
lord.
Sophomore Bronwyn Reed's sweet and sultry Mimi
comes alive in "Out Tonight," and her vocal abilities are
put to good use in the haunting ballad "Without You."
While senior Luke Taylor's Roger can be pitchy at times,
his portrayal of the laid back rocker with an undercur
rent of torment is spot-on. He and costar Reed endow
Roger and Mimi with a flirtatious and believable chem
istry. Cameron Drake 'lO, Jamie Cornejo 'lO and An
jarae Washington 'O9 all put in fine vocal performances
as Collins, Angel and Joanne, respectively.
While certain small numbers are lacking in dynamism,
serving as plot progression rather than showstoppers, the
strength of the production lies within
scenes that make use of the entire
cast. The ensemble is vocally fantastic,
and their chemistry with one another
is evident in "Santa Fe" and especially
in the groovy, anthemic "La Vie Bo
heme."The second act is marked with
the most powerful pieces, including a
brilliant staging of the church scene.
In the intimate Roble Studio Theater,
one is guaranteed an up-close experi
ence of the tensions and unfiltered
emotions swirling onstage. The or
chestra, moved from pit to the stage it
self, grants audiences full access to
Larson's powerful and thrilling rock
score.
The technical crew does a spec
tacular job with set and lighting de
sign. The graffitied walls, lone metal
staircase and small tables retain the
minimalist feel of the original
Broadway production while creating
an enclosed New York setting acces
sible to those new to the show. The
lighting, from the striking colors to
an impressive backdrop of Christ
mas lights, seamlessly enhances the
onstage drama.
The musical takes a while to find
its footing, but by the end of the first
act, the audience will be incredibly

charmed by these characters, and
emotionally invested for the darker
second act. The latter half takes off
strong and never lets up in intensity
until the last triumphant chords.
Elam successfully restages
"RENT" and makes the gritty rock
opera relatable to the Stanford stu
dent audience. "When you think of
college and Stanford, the world of
these students is filled with that
sense of temporality; so much of
being here is about what you're
going to do next," writes director
Elam. "Time flies before their eyes.
'RENT' encourages us all to think
about the day and the now."
In 1996, "RENT" opened in
Broadway theaters to buzz and con
troversy about its mature content
homosexuality, drugs and the threat
of HIV are all prominent in the lives
of the characters. While dark themes
do pervade the musical, this Stan
ford production works in away that
reminds us that Jonathan Larson's
"RENT" is, ultimately, a celebration
of life.
Tickets are sold out for all per
formances. Names may be placed on
a wait-list in line outside the theater
one hour before performances. For
