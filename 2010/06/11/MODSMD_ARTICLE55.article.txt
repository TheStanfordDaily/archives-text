# SENIOR REFLECTIONS 2010

How to capture in words four years at
the best and most beautiful
school in the world?
My first instinct is to fill up this column
with thank-yous. If there's one thing I'm tak
ing away from Stanford, it's gratitude for
what this place and its amazing people have
done for me, Thanks to my professors and ad
visors, my bosses and mentors, my fellow
staffers at The Daily, the Hume Writing Cen
ter and Roble Hall and my friends and fami
ly. I could say so much more about all of you.
My second instinct is to try to reflect on
my time here, to come to some sort of en
lightened and articulate conclusion on what
my college experience will mean for the life
ahead of me. But any good student of Histo
ry even just a minor knows that the im
plications of a particular moment or era can
not be fully realized until decades after the
fact. I'm guessing that's the case for what's
bound to be one of the most defining periods
of my life.
My third instinct is to list my memories, to
create a printed archive of what defined my
experience here. I wanted to go to Stanford
since I was old enough to know what college
is, and upon completion of my undergradu
ate term I can honestly say Stanford has been
a dream come true. From freshman year, I'll
remember 3B slumber parties and photo
shoots. Sophomore year was all about 20-
unit, five-class quarters and dark circles
under my eyes. My junior year was devoted
to The Daily recruiting a team of writers
and editors to make the Features section
headline material and, in the end, to become
some of my best friends. And when I think of
senior year, I'll recall a particular new begin
ning and the moments during my honors the
sis presentation when everything felt exactly
in place.

As I move on from Stanford, there will be
some memories that span all four years. I'll
remember the ivy and columns of Roble, my
second home. I'll think of the English classes
I took, the books I read and the discussions in
which I participated. Come Wednesday, I'm
working at a start-up in Sunnyvale doing
search engine optimization. It sounds really
technical, but in reality it involves a lot of
writing. My previous work experience has
mostly centered around journalism and writ
ing tutoring, and I know writing will always
be a core aspect of my personal and profes

sional life. That's why I majored in English,
and it's one of the few things I feel and know
with absolute certainty.
That doesn't mean the words in this col
umn are enough to truly capture my experi
ence, but I gave it a shot. Hurry up please it's
time.
