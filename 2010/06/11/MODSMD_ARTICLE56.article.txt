Kelsey Mesher, who is awesome, began
her reflections last year by describing
it as her "last assignment." And that's
a lot how this feels (though somehow I still
have another article to write.) This is only a
short piece of writing, on the one hand, and
by this point I'm used to writing a few hun
dred words. But it's intimidating to think
about writing one final take on three years at
the newspaper and four years at Stanford.
Now would be a great time to share some
hard-earned wisdom. It would also be a great
time to have some thoughts on college
what four years has meant, what it's all been
about, what I've learned. But given that most
of my hard-earned wisdom involves Austrian
writers, and college is long past the point of
becoming "The Daily" for me, I'll have to go
with a story instead.
I began writing for The Daily my sopho
more year. To this day, I can't remember why
I walked into the office at Storke, why I kept
writing past my first article, and why, at some
point, I decided "screw it" and wrote three or
four a week. Then I went to Oxford for two
quarters, where my sole contribution to The
Daily was turning in a surprisingly decent
story on President Obama's election from a
city filled with drunken, joyous American
college students.
When I came back from England, we had
a shiny new office, and I was a desk editor for
news. (My thanks to Carlee Brown, who is
awesome). From then on, in a totally uninter
rupted and relentless fashion, it's been not
stop Daily. There were tough times, there
were great times, and I probably spent a little
too much time at the office, but there wasn't
ever any doubt in my mind that I wanted to
be doing as much as I could at the paper.
It's easy to forget that it didn't have to be
this way. I didn't have to walk in to the office,
on whatever forgotten whim. I could have
chosen some other activity, or stayed focused
totally on my classes. I could have stayed a re
porter, not an editor it took some lucky

breaks and kindness that I even wound up
running the news section (My thanks to
Devin Banerjee, who is awesome).
And it's easy to forget that The Daily did
n't have to be like The Daily. The staffers
could have been boring, or mean, or clueless,
and I never would have wanted to stay. And
if I had, the experience, the good times and
bad, would never have been the way it was
weird how that works.
Now would be a good time for a big finish.
Well, if I've learned anything, it's that you
should be grateful for the people who mean
something to you along the way. That in
cludes all the incredible people I've encoun
tered working here over the last three years
my kind editors back in the day, the many,
many amazing writers (even the ones who
missed deadlines), the great group from my
time in the new office, the news team from
volume 236, the managing editors from 236
and 237, and, most of all, those among their
ranks who I've been lucky enough not only to
know but to count as my friends. My warmest
thanks to all of these people, who are awe
some. You mean the world to me.
