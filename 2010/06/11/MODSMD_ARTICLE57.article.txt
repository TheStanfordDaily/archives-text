Senior year, spring quarter, and my time
here at Stanford are all hurtling toward
their inevitable completion. Ever since
freshman year, time has only accelerated.
We're finally here. I still remember move-in
day, and the only Band Run that went to the
stadium. Four years later, what has it all
meant?
Get involved. The more involved you are,
whether it's club sports, an ethnic/cultural
group, or a publication, the more you love
Stanford. The organizations I've been a part
of have defined who I am much more than
my major, and I've probably put more time
into them as well. You can find your passions
there, and like photography for me, it might
even become a job.
Go to athletics events. Even if you're not
into sports, it's just plain fun to watch us win,
and those close games really keep you on
your feet. Once you become a diehard Cardi
nal fan, as everyone should be, you'll love
Stanford just that much more.
Talk about things. I mean really talk. It's a
bit disappointing how few deep discussions I
have had, and I know there are so many great
ideas here.

Go abroad. I was actually extremely un
sure about leaving campus for a quarter, up
until the day I left. And then I never looked
back until I returned. The change in scenery
and a break from the bubble, plus explo
ration made Kyoto my favorite quarter at
Stanford, except not at Stanford.
Have some fun. Never tried fountain hop
ping? You don't know what you're missing!
One of the greatest things about the people
here is how passionate and dedicated we are
and yet we know how to mess around. While
you're at it, be sure to participate in all the
traditions (well, you can just observe at
FMOTQ).
You don't have to like every class in your
major. You're probably not going to, and it's
fine. Choose something you like, and then
maybe do something completely different
when you graduate.
Take chances and follow your heart. So
you've been doing something, and a really cool
opportunity comes up but you don't want to
switch tracks. Sometimes you need to just take
a chance and see what happens. Great things
can come from the smallest fortuities.
Give back. Give back to the larger com
munity, give to Stanford, give to the under
classmen and ProFros and the Frosh by giv
ing them advice, SPOT has been one of the
most rewarding and fun things I've done.
They appreciate it, and you thrive on their
energy.
And when it's all said and done, thank
everyone. Your parents, friends, dorm staff,
maintenance and dining staff, professors,
Dean Julie... It's because of you all that we
are able to make the journey through the
most wonderful university in the world.
Thank you.
I will miss this place so, so much. Despite
all the all-nighters and stressful times, I can
not love this place more. But the best part is,
this isn't goodbye. I'll see you guys soon.
