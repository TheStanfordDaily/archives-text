I am not a religious man, but I know have
been blessed.
I am blessed to have attended Stanford,
one of the greatest universities in the world. I
am blessed to have met the people I have met
and for the experiences I have had here. I am
blessed to be alive, writing to you from a
study room on the second floor of Old

Union.no matter how sterile this place is sup
posed to be.
Likewise, I have been blessed to work at
The Daily. Two years ago, The Daily pretty
much defined me. If you knew me, you knew
that I worked at The Daily. I took my job of
Managing Editor of Sports rather seriously,
spending five nights a week in the office and
not giving myself too much time away from
it. It was a great experience, and I was fortu
nate enough to see our men's basketball
team make a run at the Sweet 16, our
women's team make it all the way to the title
game and the baseball team make an in
spired run to the College World Series. Not to
mention the other Stanford teams, whose su
perlative success has become the standard
for the rest of college athletics.
A full year as an editor at The Daily
wore on me, though, and I felt like I had no
choice but to significantly scale down my
involvement at the paper. I gradually be
came more of a writer than an editor, and
by the time I went abroad in the winter of
my junior year, I had pretty much removed
myself from The Daily. Still, I wrote football
and basketball this season, and I had a great
time doing so. Witnessing the rise of the
Cardinal football program under Coach
Harbaugh has truly been a pleasure, and I
know that a few years down the road the
basketball program will be just as great as it
once was. There are few coaches out there
that are a better fit for the kind of program
that Stanford wants to run than Coach
Dawkins.The guy means business.
I do not have much to say in this column
except for that I hope you all enjoyed my
writing. If my writing has improved those idle
moments where you have nothing to do
other than read The Daily then I am truly
honored. If you wanted to keep up on Stan
ford sports in general and were entertained
or informed by my writing, I am also hon
ored. If you actually looked forward to read
ing the text under my name for its smooth
prose and witty commentary (I kid, I kid)
then I am flattered.
What a long, strange four years it's been. I
thank you all who have played a role in my
Stanford experience, and I wish the best on
all those who haven't.
And, as a wise man by the name of Weezy
F. Baby once told me:
Shout-out to my friends 'cause without
them I couldn't,
Shout-out to my parents 'cause without
them I wouldn't.
