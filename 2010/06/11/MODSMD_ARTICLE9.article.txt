## Westboro counter-protest draws hundreds

In a moment that became a rallying point
for a wide swath of the Stanford community,
hundreds of people gathered Friday morning
outside Hillel House and along Mayfield Av
enue to respond to five picketers from the
Kansas-based fringe group Westboro Baptist
Church.
Police estimate that 800 to 1,000 people,
mostly Stanford-affiliated, turned out Friday
morning. The gathering, dubbed "Stanford
United" by organizers from Hillel and the Jew
ish Student Association, drowned out the
Westboro demonstrators and went largely
without incident.
Students began to gather at Hillel more
than an hour ahead of the Kansas group's 8:10
a.m. arrival time in response to a weeklong or
ganizing campaign against Westboro's visit. By
the time the five Westboro members arrived
on the corner of Campus Drive and Mayfield

Avenue, Hillel's front lawn was full and people
were standing five deep on the other side of
the road.
The church's songs targeting the Jewish
and LGBT communities and U.S. Marines
were made inaudible by a crowd rendition of
"Amazing Grace."
Westboro Baptist Church, based in Topeka,
is notorious for demonstrating with profane
anti-gay and anti-Semitic signs, including at fu
nerals of American soldiers. On Friday, five
adult members picketed the Mayfield-Cam
pus intersection for half an hour.
The student demonstration, organized by
the Jewish Student Association and Hillel at
Stanford with 22 co-sponsor groups from Stan
ford and Palo Alto, kept true to the goal it pub
licized: "to affirm our common values, regard
less of WBC's presence." Many people never
saw the church members, who remained at the
street corner with trees and shrubbery be
tween themselves and the front lawn of Hillel.

"Stanford really successfully came together
and created a message of our own," said Joe
Gettinger 'll, president of the Jewish Student

Association.
University spokesperson Lisa Lapin agreed
the event had turned a potentially ugly scene
into a positive moment for the Stanford com
munity.
"While I really abhor what the Westboro
Baptist Church stands for, it resulted in a pos
itive opportunity for the University, to have so
many students come together to support each
other and make a statement for tolerance and
against hate," Lapin said.
Three tires on the church's rental minivan
were slashed during their demonstration.
Lapin said the University offered reserved
parking and security to the group as their vehi
cles have been vandalized in the past. The
group instead parked a block from Hillel.
Lapin said the police took a report on the tire
slashing and, as of press time Sunday, had no
further details.
Gettinger disavowed the vandalism.
"That should not be associated with our
event," he said.

Hillel and the Jewish Student Association
began planning their counter-event soon after

learning, via Westboro's Web site, that the
group planned to picket outside Hillel after
making stops in San Francisco and at Gunn
High School in Palo Alto.
At first, worried about attracting attention
for the church, Gettinger said he considered
whether doing nothing might be a better idea
than a massive rally. But a strong student reac
tion following independent e-mails alerting
student chat lists to the WBC's plans con
vinced Gettinger that a simultaneous demon
stration would only do good.
"There was so much energy on campus
around this and it seemed better to channel it
into something rather than bottle it up," Get
tinger said.
Fittingly, students on Friday expressed mes
sages of tolerance and flair.
The a cappella group Talisman stood on
Hillel's front steps and sang songs, including
"Lift Every Voice." The crowd read aloud a
declaration titled "Stanford United." Halfway
