# STUDENT LIFE
## Westboro counter-protest draws hundreds

In a moment that became a rallying point
for a wide swath of the Stanford community,
hundreds of people gathered Friday morning
outside Hillel House and along Mayfield Av
enue to respond to five picketers from the
Kansas-based fringe group Westboro Baptist
Church.
Police estimate that 800 to 1,000 people,
mostly Stanford-affiliated, turned out Friday
morning. The gathering, dubbed "Stanford
United" by organizers from Hillel and the Jew
ish Student Association, drowned out the
Westboro demonstrators and went largely
without incident.
Students began to gather at Hillel more
than an hour ahead of the Kansas group's 8:10
a.m. arrival time in response to a weeklong or
ganizing campaign against Westboro's visit. By
the time the five Westboro members arrived
on the corner of Campus Drive and Mayfield

Avenue, Hillel's front lawn was full and people
were standing five deep on the other side of
the road.
The church's songs targeting the Jewish
and LGBT communities and U.S. Marines
were made inaudible by a crowd rendition of
"Amazing Grace."
Westboro Baptist Church, based in Topeka,
is notorious for demonstrating with profane
anti-gay and anti-Semitic signs, including at fu
nerals of American soldiers. On Friday, five
adult members picketed the Mayfield-Cam
pus intersection for half an hour.
The student demonstration, organized by
the Jewish Student Association and Hillel at
Stanford with 22 co-sponsor groups from Stan
ford and Palo Alto, kept true to the goal it pub
licized: "to affirm our common values, regard
less of WBC's presence." Many people never
saw the church members, who remained at the
street corner with trees and shrubbery be
tween themselves and the front lawn of Hillel.

"Stanford really successfully came together
and created a message of our own," said Joe
Gettinger 'll, president of the Jewish Student

Association.
University spokesperson Lisa Lapin agreed
the event had turned a potentially ugly scene
into a positive moment for the Stanford com
munity.
"While I really abhor what the Westboro
Baptist Church stands for, it resulted in a pos
itive opportunity for the University, to have so
many students come together to support each
other and make a statement for tolerance and
against hate," Lapin said.
Three tires on the church's rental minivan
were slashed during their demonstration.
Lapin said the University offered reserved
parking and security to the group as their vehi
cles have been vandalized in the past. The
group instead parked a block from Hillel.
Lapin said the police took a report on the tire
slashing and, as of press time Sunday, had no
further details.
Gettinger disavowed the vandalism.
"That should not be associated with our
event," he said.

Hillel and the Jewish Student Association
began planning their counter-event soon after

learning, via Westboro's Web site, that the
group planned to picket outside Hillel after
making stops in San Francisco and at Gunn
High School in Palo Alto.
At first, worried about attracting attention
for the church, Gettinger said he considered
whether doing nothing might be a better idea
than a massive rally. But a strong student reac
tion following independent e-mails alerting
student chat lists to the WBC's plans con
vinced Gettinger that a simultaneous demon
stration would only do good.
"There was so much energy on campus
around this and it seemed better to channel it
into something rather than bottle it up," Get
tinger said.
Fittingly, students on Friday expressed mes
sages of tolerance and flair.
The a cappella group Talisman stood on
Hillel's front steps and sang songs, including
"Lift Every Voice." The crowd read aloud a
declaration titled "Stanford United." Halfway
through the event, Blake Parkinson 'lO

emerged from Robert S. Moore
House playing "Amazing Grace" on
bagpipes, the crowd joining in after a
cheer.
Calling the picketers "clowns," a
juggler in a bow tie tossed beanbags
in the air on the same street corner.
Plenty of students brought signs,
too. "Gay is OK," one read. "I love
Jews," said another. One student car
ried his sign "Don't feed the
trolls" while wearing a bright pink
bunny suit.
John Machacon 'l3 and several
others carried signs reading, "Out of
many, one."
"At Mass, the priest suggested we
come out to support our fellow man,"
Machacon said. "This group is about
hating people for who they are, and
I'm not okay with that at all."
About 40 of the students in atten
dance were volunteer marshals
working with the Stanford Depart
ment of Public Safety (DPS). They
met inside the Ziff Center behind
Hillel at 7:20 a.m. for a briefing from
police Sgt. Hilary Karp on how to
make sure the gathering remained
calm.
Afterward, the volunteers
donned bright purple T-shirts and
formed a human barrier at the edge
of the Hillel lawn in case the West
boro group approached the crowd.
"We were prepared for them to
come onto the sidewalk, but things
were really calm," said George Mi
chopoulos 'l3, one of the volunteers.
Department police officers were
out in full force as well. About eight

uniformed officers kept watch on
the Hillel grounds while another
four monitored the event directly
across the street. Lapin confirmed
that plainclothes policemen were on
duty as well.
The DPS also barricaded the
lower block of Mayfield Avenue to
traffic at 8 a.m. as people streamed
toward Hillel from both directions.
Police lifted the barricade at 9 a.m.
Other than the tire slashing, the
gathering passed without incident.
The crowd began to disperse after
the Westboro protesters left at 8:45
a.m., though many stayed, as "All
You Need is Love" blared from a
speaker outside Casa Italiana and
the Stanford Band ran in to cheers.
Never ones to pass up a tongue
in-cheek joke, the set list included
Squirrel Nut Zipper's "Hell" and
Green Day's "Welcome to Par
adise."
After the Band left, the road
blocks were gone and there was lit
tle physical evidence of the gather
ing except for thousands of foot
prints on Hillel's front lawn. The
emotional evidence lasted longer.
"I thought it went really well,"
said Molly Bauer 'l2. "The bagpipes
were great."
"It was incredible to come
around the corner and see all the
people already there," said Daniel
Mattis 'l2, who worried that the
early time would keep students
from showing support. "It was just
amazing."
Jordan Knox 'lO may have put
the general feeling best.
"You gotta love the love," he
said.

In a moment that became a rallying point
for a wide swath of the Stanford community,
hundreds of people gathered Friday morning
outside Hillel House and along Mayfield Av
enue to respond to five picketers from the
Kansas-based fringe group Westboro Baptist
Church.
Police estimate that 800 to 1,000 people,
mostly Stanford-affiliated, turned out Friday
morning. The gathering, dubbed "Stanford
United" by organizers from Hillel and the Jew
ish Student Association, drowned out the
Westboro demonstrators and went largely
without incident.
Students began to gather at Hillel more
than an hour ahead of the Kansas group's 8:10
a.m. arrival time in response to a weeklong or
ganizing campaign against Westboro's visit. By
the time the five Westboro members arrived
on the corner of Campus Drive and Mayfield

Avenue, Hillel's front lawn was full and people
were standing five deep on the other side of
the road.
The church's songs targeting the Jewish
and LGBT communities and U.S. Marines
were made inaudible by a crowd rendition of
"Amazing Grace."
Westboro Baptist Church, based in Topeka,
is notorious for demonstrating with profane
anti-gay and anti-Semitic signs, including at fu
nerals of American soldiers. On Friday, five
adult members picketed the Mayfield-Cam
pus intersection for half an hour.
The student demonstration, organized by
the Jewish Student Association and Hillel at
Stanford with 22 co-sponsor groups from Stan
ford and Palo Alto, kept true to the goal it pub
licized: "to affirm our common values, regard
less of WBC's presence." Many people never
saw the church members, who remained at the
street corner with trees and shrubbery be
tween themselves and the front lawn of Hillel.

"Stanford really successfully came together
and created a message of our own," said Joe
Gettinger 'll, president of the Jewish Student

Association.
University spokesperson Lisa Lapin agreed
the event had turned a potentially ugly scene
into a positive moment for the Stanford com
munity.
"While I really abhor what the Westboro
Baptist Church stands for, it resulted in a pos
itive opportunity for the University, to have so
many students come together to support each
other and make a statement for tolerance and
against hate," Lapin said.
Three tires on the church's rental minivan
were slashed during their demonstration.
Lapin said the University offered reserved
parking and security to the group as their vehi
cles have been vandalized in the past. The
group instead parked a block from Hillel.
Lapin said the police took a report on the tire
slashing and, as of press time Sunday, had no
further details.
Gettinger disavowed the vandalism.
"That should not be associated with our
event," he said.

Hillel and the Jewish Student Association
began planning their counter-event soon after

learning, via Westboro's Web site, that the
group planned to picket outside Hillel after
making stops in San Francisco and at Gunn
High School in Palo Alto.
At first, worried about attracting attention
for the church, Gettinger said he considered
whether doing nothing might be a better idea
than a massive rally. But a strong student reac
tion following independent e-mails alerting
student chat lists to the WBC's plans con
vinced Gettinger that a simultaneous demon
stration would only do good.
"There was so much energy on campus
around this and it seemed better to channel it

tinger said.
