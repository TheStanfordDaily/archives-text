# Cardinal sports earns 16th Directors' Cup
## 
### JACOB JAFFE SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
For the 16th consecutive year,
Stanford ended its athletic cam
paign as the best sports program in
the country by winning the
Learfield Sports Directors' Cup.
The National Association of
Collegiate Directors of Athletics
(NACDA) joined with USA
Today to create the Directors' Cup
award in 1993-1994 in order to
reward the school with the best
intercollegiate athletics program.
In 2008, Learfield Sports became
the official sponsor of the award,
which has grown to give awards for
Division 11, Division 111 and
NAIA.
Points are awarded to teams
based on each team's finish in the
final tournament or standings for
the respective sport. The school's
total is calculated by summing
scores from the 10 best men's
teams and 10 best women's teams.
After finishing second to the
University of North Carolina in the
inaugural Directors' Cup stand
ings, Stanford has gone on to win
the award every year since. In
recent years, the Cardinal's wins
have been substantial. In 2007-08,
Stanford defeated second-place
UCLA by 279 points. In 2008-09,
Stanford won by 270.75 points over
North Carolina, its closest competi
tor. For a point of reference, this
gap was about the same as the gap
between second and 15th place.
"We don't really have much of a
strategy as it pertains to the
Directors' Cup," said Athletics
Director Bob Bowlsby. "It's really
sort of a sum of the parts. And
every one of our sports is trying to
compete at the highest level they
possibly can. And at the end of the
year we've been fortunate to have
it add up to Directors' Cup cham
pionships."
Following comfortable wins in
each of the past few years, this
year's Cardinal program set a new
standard. Stanford's current total
of 1508.5 is the highest total for any
Division-I program in the 17-year
history of the Directors' Cup. The
scores are not yet final because
baseball's points have yet to be
added from the College World
Series. Those final scores will be
released today. However, the order
of the top three teams will not
change in the final standings, and
no team's point total will drop. The
University of Florida came in a dis
tant second to Stanford, scoring
1237.25 points without baseball's
points. Virginia placed third with
1189.25, followed by UCLA at
1034 and Texas A&M at 1020.75.
"We score in more than the 10

men's sports and the 10 women's
sports that are tabulated in the
rankings," Bowlsby said. "And so
we have the luxury of throwing out
some of the sports that are lower
scoring or where we don't score at
all. Having a lot of sports certainly
is an advantage."
The Cardinal had another suc
cessful year across all sports, lead
ing to another runaway Directors'
Cup victory. Stanford was led by its
three national championship
teams: men's volleyball, women's
tennis and women's lightweight
rowing. However, lightweight row
ing is not an NCAA sport, so it did
not count for the Directors' Cup.
Men's volleyball and women's ten
nis helped continue Stanford's
national record of consecutive
years with an NCAA title, which
now sits at 34.
Along with these champi
onships, Stanford received great
contributions from a number of
sports. The Cardinal placed second
in five women's sports soccer,
basketball, swimming, water polo
and synchronized swimming â€”as
well as men's gymnastics.
In total, nine Stanford sports
were ranked No. 1 in the nation at
some point in the year, and 20 of
the 35 teams finished in the top 10
nationally. Florida finished second
with a school-record 14 top-10
teams.
"I think we're always faced with
discussions about quality versus
quantity," Bowlsby said. "But
we've been able to maintain high
quality with a very broad-based
program and I'd expect to do that
in the future as well."
The Cardinal's breadth of quali
ty shone on the individual side as
well. Sophomore Bradley Klahn
won the singles title in men's ten
nis, and the women's doubles
crown went to junior Hilary Barte

"We don't build a lot of our
strategy around trying to win the
Directors' Cup," Bowlsby said, "but
we certainly are glad to win it and
we want each of our sports to
achieve at a high level and ulti
mately that results in the Cup."
