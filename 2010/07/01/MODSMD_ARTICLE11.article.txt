# Broken hearts for England, new hope for U.S. Soccer
## 
### TOM TAYLOR 
It's over. A manager too stub
born to get the best from a team
of overpaid celebrities, a worthy
performance from the U.S.A.
that denied us top spot in our
group and, ultimately, a criminally bad
ruling from a linesman that stopped our
miraculous revival dead have yet again
extinguished the hopes and dreams of a
once proud nation.
The morning after England's exit
from the World Cup at the hands of a
youthfully exciting German team, most
of the flags were already gone. The few
St. George's Crosses that still hung for
lornly in the breathless morning sun
shine, too bright and cheerful for a
national day of mourning, were a bitter
reminder of what could have been.
That ultimate sign of national unity,
flying the flag, has never sat comfortably
in modern-day England. Perhaps it
speaks too strongly of an empire lost, or
simply of those who are too fervent in
their patriotism â€”those with xenopho
bic and racist political views. While mil
lions across the globe will happily paint
themselves green to celebrate St.
Patrick's Day, few in England even
know where in the calendar St.
George's Day falls. Fewer still mark its
passage.
But one thing can still bring out our
national colors and make our hearts
beat in unison: sport, and above all,
football.
Some will say, "It's only a game."
There is no phrase more offensive or
insulting that I could use in this column,
whether censored or not. Football is not
a game, it is far more important than
that.
Games are something you enjoy.
Being an English football fan is not an
enjoyable experience. We have an abu
sive relationship with the beautiful
sport. Each time it seems she could not
hurt us any worse she drags us back in
and cuts us deeper.
The shadow of 1966, the last and
only time we won the World Cup,
looms ever darker and the frustration
and pressure get worse and worse with
each passing year. I don't know if any
one, anywhere, can really empathize
with what it means to be English.
England invented football, has
arguably the best (and most popular)
league in the World and lives and
breathes the game. Our team always
includes players that are world-class for
their clubs, and our managers are gen
erally, at club-level at least, some of the
best.
I know there are big American
sports teams that have had long periods
of failure, but even their struggles pale
in comparison. Canada, maybe, can
understand more than most, having
endured 46 years of Olympic failure in
its own sport of ice hockey, but even
then it had already won the title six
times, and since 2002 has added two
more golds to that.
As a student in the USA, I often
complain of the lack of interest or
understanding by Americans of the
world's most popular game. I am back
home right now so I don't know how
the World Cup has gone down in the
States, or whether people have really
got behind their team and whether the
highs and lows of the tournament have
made national headlines.

It seems ironic now that I wrote a
column last quarter vainly trying to con
vince people that draws (aka ties) are an
important and even exciting part of
world sport.
England's draws against the U.S.
and Algeria almost sent us home, while
the Americans' similar results against us
and Slovenia launched it into a position
where passage to the next round was
within its grasp, and ultimately made
the difference that rightly secured it top
spot from group C. Though the loss
against Ghana in the next game ended
a potential run to the semifinals, this was
the first time the U.S. had ever won its
group and was an important step for
what is increasingly becoming a success
ful and consistent country at the inter
national level.
While fans in the U.S. should feel
proud of their players, in England there
is a very different mood. An inquest will
now be held, and fans are already call
ing for the head of our manager, Fabio
Capello. Entering the tournament
ranked among the favorites and in a
group that, on paper at least, was easily
winnable, we put in our worst-ever per
formance in the finals. It is actually
some consolation to have been beaten
by a giant like Germany when the min
now-like Slovenia came uncomfortably
close to knocking us out.
After all of this, it's hard not to won
der if maybe I'm wrong.
The U.S. brought more fans than
anyone else to the World Cup, put in a
solid performance, and I suspect that
those who got caught up in the excite
ment, though disappointed now, will get
over the loss far quicker than my own
countrymen.
American soccer fans can enjoy
watching their team in away English
football fans can't comprehend, and
their players can play with freedom, not

overburdened with an expectation that
inevitably crushes them flat.
Perhaps it's America that really
"gets" football.
