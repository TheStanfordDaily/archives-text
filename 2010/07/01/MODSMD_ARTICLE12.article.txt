## Alissa Haber dominates for Team USA 
### 
Stanford alumna Alissa Haber
gave the U.S. national Softball team
an enormous boost over the past
week, helping them to go undefeat
ed in pool play at the ISF XII
Women's World Softball
Championship. After last night's
opening game of the medal round,
the Newark, Calif, native is leading
her team with a .700 batting average,
14 hits and seven doubles over their
first eight games, in which they've
outscored their opponents 84-6.
In last night's 16-1 victory over
Canada, she garnered her 17th, 18th
and 19th RBIs to set the record for
most runs batted in during the
World Championships. The U.S.A.
is now 9-0 against Canada in cham
pionship play.
