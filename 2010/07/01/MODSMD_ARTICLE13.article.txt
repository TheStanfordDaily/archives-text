## CAMPUS SNOOPER Snippets overheard at Stanford 
### MARISA LANDICHO FEATURES EDITOR 
Overheard on the stadium bleach
ers:
Student 1: "Whoa. How did you get
here?"
Student 2: "I walked."
Student 1, very confused: "But...
how did you get past the gate?"
Student 2: "I said I was a student and
they waved me in."
He shows his ticket stub.
Student 1: "How'd you get that tick
et?!?"
Student 2: "VIP."

A boy's first attempt at flirting:
Boy: "I don't do drugs!"
Uninterested girl, while texting: "No
way."
Boy: "I'm a Korean, I don't do
drugs."

Girl 1: "Where's the bookstore?"
Girl 2, pointing toward Tresidder
Express: "That had books in it."
The two walk in.

A monk enjoys a Subway footlong
while completing a sudoku outside
Fraiche, 2:20 p.m.

Two girls stand perplexed before the
dining hall tray return:
Girl 1: "So, there's compost and
landfill..."
Girl 2: "Where does, like, trash go?"
Girl 3 walks up, dumps her plate and
silverware into landfill bin and walks
away.

A certain Russian President visits
Twitter's offices before speaking on
campus:
@Kremlinßussia_E "Hello every
one! I'm on Twitter, and this is my
first tweet."

A couple rides out of the Bike Shop
after renting bikes:
Woman, as she crashes into a two
foot-high stone wall outside Tresid
der: "These are hand brakes. I'm not
used to that."
Man: "That was your hands."

Resident tries the indirect approach
in an email to his RA:
Boy: "What happens if we have the
pleasure of throwing up on campus,
specifically in our dorm room? Is
there a procedure to remove the
specimen from the carpet?"
