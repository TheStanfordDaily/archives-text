### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Ellen Huet 
Harry J. Elam Jr., a drama professor and cur
rent senior associate vice provost for undergradu
ate education (VPUE), will be succeeding John
Bravman '79 M.S. 'Bl Ph.D. 'B5 as the new vice
provost for undergraduate education today.
Provost John Etchemendy announced the change
on June 15.
Elam, who has been part of the University's fac
ulty for 20 years, has won six teaching awards and
has been working in VPUE with Bravman since
2007. He is also the co-chair of the Study of Under
graduate Education at Stanford (SUES), which is
a University-wide evaluation of non-major re
quirements for undergrads, such as GERs, IHUM
and PWR the first study of its kind since 1994.
As vice provost, Elam's responsibilities will in
clude oversight of the University's 6,500 under
graduate students and various undergrad pro
grams, including implementation of new changes

put forth by SUES, something Elam considers a
priority.
"I look forward to helping VPUE become the
locus for a vibrant and exciting reexamination of
undergraduate education at Stanford," Elam told
the Stanford Report. "I am eager to explore how
we can make a liberal education even more central
to our mission as we continue to create an under
graduate experience that is distinctive to Stan
ford."
SUES' recommendations are scheduled to be
delivered in 2011.
Since 2008, when VPUE faced drastic changes
in order to reduce budgets, the Vice Provost's of
fice has greatly restructured several programs, in
cluding putting a hiatus on overseas seminars and
reorganizing staff in other departments.
The search committee to find a replacement for
Bravman solicited input from faculty, staff and stu
dents, and spent over a month before naming his
successor after Bravman announced his plans to
leave on April 12.
Elam's academic specialties lie in African-
American and Chicano theater, and he is the au
thor of six books. Before coming to Stanford in
1990, Elam received degrees from Harvard Col
lege and UC-Berkeley, and served on the faculty of
the University of Maryland-College Park. At Stan
ford, he has also chaired the drama department

and served as director of the IHUM program.
