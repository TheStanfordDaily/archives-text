### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€” Jane LePham 
This year, 24 Stanford students and alums were
awarded scholarships by the Fulbright U.S. Stu
dent Program for the 2010-11 academic year.
The Fulbright Program was originally created
in 1946 by Congress to promote a mutual under
standing between foreign countries. Sponsored
by the Department of State, the program awards
approximately 1,500 grants to American students
each year, and is designed to provide these stu
dents with the funding and opportunity to gain in
ternational experience in one of the 155 countries
where the program is offered. Each participant
will study overseas for nine months to a year, re
searching and exploring a self-designed project.

According to John Pearson, director of the
Bechtel International Center, Stanford students'
success in recent years is due to the quality of ed
ucation the University offers, the support that
Stanford faculty provide and the exceptional
quality of applications.
"When you pull all of this together, students
have all the information, they are very good at re
search and they have a very good network to draw
upon they're also getting really good support
from the faculty and their advisors," Pearson said,
adding that the opportunity for undergrads to
pursue independent studies also helped students
prepare better applications.
Stanford's 2010-11 Fulbright Scholars include
10 graduating seniors, two graduating master's
students, five doctoral candidates and seven
alumni. The Stanford students and alumni will
travel to 17 countries, including Ecuador, India,
Japan, New Zealand, Russia and South Africa.
