## CONCERT REVIEW THE WORLD NEEDS MORE ELECTRIC DAISIES

As we looked over the enormous
mass of people jumping on the
Coliseum floor, surrounded by
thousands in stadium seats with
LED lights and glow sticks flick
ering like a million fireflies, my sister said, "If
everybody knew about this, there would be
world peace."
Similar sentiments were echoed regularly
at this year's Electric Daisy Carnival, the mas
sive electronic music festival held annually in
downtown Los Angeles. Taking place over
two beautiful days in June in USC's
Exposition Park (with the main stage smack
in the center of the Coliseum), EDC is a neon
wonderland filled with glittering carnival
rides, professional dancers dressed to the
nines and over 150,000 concert-goers some
hardcore ravers and others just looking to
dance.
Upon arriving at the packed gates, it did
not seem to matter that the line was enormous
people-watching was entertaining enough.
Girls were scantily clad in little more than a

bikini, with many wearing bright, fuzzy leg
warmers standard at raves and on go-go girls.
The men looked more toned down, opting to
wear white, with the occasional gas mask or
rave goggles. Most outfits, however, had one
thing in common kandi, the childish pony
bead bracelets and necklaces traded at raves,
adorned everybody, some with a lone bracelet
around the wrist and many with rainbows of
color all the way up their arms.
Once Intermission made it inside the con
cert grounds, the five(!) stages made deciding
incredibly difficult. Looking for some shade,
we stumbled upon AutoErotique's set. They
were laying down some seriously dramatic
bass and the small crowd was loving it, moving
freely through the grass and enjoying the pre
lude to the rest of the event. Up next was a
more high-profile artist DJ wonderboy
Afrojack who has been blowing up in the
dance music world and was arguably the most
featured act that EDC had to offer. Playing
two massive sets on both Friday and Saturday,
along with spinning the after-party on Friday

night, there is no doubt that everybody wit
nessed at least some of his musical talents dur
ing the weekend. Intermission caught both,
and Afrojack didn't disappoint. Ending his
Saturday set with his mix of Imogen Heap's

"Hide and Seek," the crowd went wild as they
sung along and danced to the familiar track.
As the sun began to set on Friday night, we
found ourselves camped out at the main stage
for the massive lineup to come. Australian
house DJ Dirty South got the crowd ready for
the celebrity headliners, and his summer hit
"Phazing" was the perfect start to a beautiful
night. Power trio Swedish House Mafia was
up next on stage, and the excitement in the
massive crowd was palpable. Comprised of
Swedish DJs Steve Angello, Sebastian
Ingrosso and Axwell, their house hit "One"
has earned them millions of fans and a covet
ed residency in Ibiza. From the dramatic
introduction to the very end of the two-hour
set, the crowd did not stop moving. All the
stops were pulled out as fireworks regularly
exploded and the massive light screens daz
zled beyond belief. Dropping Daft Punk's
classic "One More Time," everybody grooved
to the beat until the now übiquitous introduc-

"If everybody knew
about this, there
would be world
peace"
