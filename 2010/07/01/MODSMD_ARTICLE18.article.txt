## Upscale Junnoon serves up fun fare 
### â€“ evie DANFORTH contact evie: edanforth@ stanford. edu 
Junnoon, an upscale Indian
restaurant in downtown Palo
Alto, recently opened a new
cocktail lounge and is con
ducting a renewed publicity
effort to get local diners hooked on a
place they may have overlooked
when it opened a few years ago, at
the peak of the recession. They invit
ed me to come have dinner, so, with
my faithful dining companion in tow,
I stopped by their hip, modern space
earlier this week.
Junnoon is one of those restau
rants that takes a cuisine most
Americans are familiar with in
greasy, take-out form and elevates it
a pretty cool concept that has
especially proliferated in Palo Alto.
(There are more fancy-schmancy
pizza places near campus than are
probably necessary.) Junnoon also
operates on the challenge of putting
a modernized, a-geographic spin on
the ancient, well-defined and highly
regional Indian cooking tradition.
So this definitely isn't your typical
Indian restaurant the menu steers
clear of curries and samosa, and the
few staple dishes available have
been reformatted as sleeker, sexier
versions of what you might expect.
It would probably be an unnerving
dining experience for the Indian
food purist, but for the average
Stanford student, it's a fun way to try
vaunted staple ingredients of
California fine dining (goat cheese,
salmon, obscure vegetables)
slathered in less-common flavors
like tamarind.
For our dinner, we had several
small plates and split an entree. First
out, we had pork and chive
dumplings, which apparently are
from Eastern India but honestly
seemed to be on the menu more as a
concession to people who can't tell
Indian and Chinese food apart. I
love dumplings, so it was kind of a
disappointment that these were,
well, pretty unexciting. But it was
nice that the filling was seasoned in
an unexpected, distinctly Indian
way, which made them stand out
slightly. We also got a peanut sprout
salad. The ingredients in the salad
(peanut sprouts, oranges, julienned
zucchini) were all obviously very

fresh and it was a nice, light dish a
lot of times American Indian restau
rants can be infuriatingly heavy, but
the salad struck us as too experi
mental. There's a reason most salads
aren't made predominately with
peanut sprouts.
Fortunately, the next two appe
tizers were really, really good. My
favorite was a unique, sort of
strange-looking plate of eggshell
thin semolina flour shells, stuffed
with chickpeas and tamarind chut
ney. I didn't know what to expect
from this dish, since it's not exactly
made from obvious ingredients, but
it was surprisingly a highlight of the
whole dinner. We also got fried
balls of spinach and chickpeas,
stuffed with warm, gooey goat
cheese and served alongside
tamarind chutney. The goat cheese
was a little too strong for my dining
companion, but I gobbled them
down. Finally, we had a really
incredible halibut dish served with
neon green coconut curry sauce. The
fish was light and perfectly cooked. I
thought the sauce might overwhelm
the halibut, but it was exactly right.
By the time our waiter brought out
cups of homemade chai and an
Indian-spiced molten chocolate cake
(yum!), we were full and satisfied.
There were some things at
Junnoon that we found lacking,
though. We sat outside, which was a
nice idea but a bit loud since the
restaurant faces University Avenue.
The food came a little more slowly
than most Stanford students are
probably accustomed to. The prices
are also steep; at about forty dollars
a person, on a college student's
miniscule budget dinner here would
probably be only for a special occa
sion or a date you really, really liked.
However, it was a really fun alterna
tive to most "nice" restaurants
around here, which can get frustrat
ingly similar. The service was great,
the atmosphere is really cool and we
ended up fighting over who got the
last bites of the molten chocolate
cake.
