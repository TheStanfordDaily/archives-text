# MEN'S GYMNASTICS
## Summer is no off-season for busy Stanford athletes 
### JESSICA YU CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
What happens to Stanford's top
athletes when the academic year
comes to a close, the off-season is
in full swing and dormmates and
friends vacate the campus for two
full months?
They become year-round stu
dents, stronger athletes and even
closer friends with the teammates
they spend 20-plus hours a week
with in the gym and on the field. A
look at the lives of some Stanford
men's gymnasts provides a glimpse
at what's happening with Cardinal
athletes this week and this sum
mer.
A redshirt senior last year, team
co-captain Greg Ter-Zakhariants
had a busy start to his summer.
After graduating in June with both
his B.A. in Economics and M.A. in
Russian, East European, and
Eurasian Studies, Ter-Zakhariants
joined his fellow college graduates
in a painstaking job search. Dozens
of applications and a handful of
interviews later, Ter-Zakhariants
recently landed a job with
Professor Kathryn Shaw at
Stanford's Graduate School of
Business, in which he will research
teacher labor markets and pay
practices across the United States.
At the same time, Ter-
Zakhariants still commits several
hours a week to his beloved sport.
While taking a break from person
ally training on his favorite events
as he heals a back injury that has
nagged him since the 2008-2009
season, Ter-Zakhariants coaches
both his fellow teammates and
aspiring young gymnasts in a club
program. But ever the diligent ath
lete, he also runs the Dish four
mornings a week to keep his body
in shape.
Ter-Zakhariants' 2009-10 co
captain and rising redshirt senior
Abhinav Ramani is having an
equally busy summer. From 9-5, he
attempts to save the world by
working as an R&D Engineer at a
medical device company called
NeoTract to redesign a product
that treats a condition known as
benign prostratic hyperplasia.
After work, he spends approxi

mately 16 hours per week learning
new skills and sequences for next
winter's gymnastics season.
And as though he ever has a
chance to miss his fellow gymnasts
with all their team training
throughout the academic year and
off-season, Ramani is rooming with
three of them this summer in
Mountain View.
One of those roommates is ris
ing senior Ryan Lieberman. The
2010 NCAA parallel bars champi
on, Lieberman is spending his sum
mer even more immersed in
NCAA life as a research assistant
for Roger Noll, an economics pro
fessor. The research project? An
exploration of NCAA Division 1
Coaching Salaries.
Like Ramani and Ter-
Zakhariants, Lieberman spends
much of his evening in the gym
four hours a day, to be exact. And
in his downtime, this national
champion likes to produce music.
Perhaps a music career is next after
gymnastics?
Two more men's gymnastics
roommates are rising senior Tim
Gentry and rising redshirt junior
Kyle Oi. Gentry, a two-time (and
current) national team member, is
spending his summer by adding to
his educational background with
CSIO6A and AAI9O. And accord
ing to him, he is spending "a lot" of
hours in the gym.
Oi, like Gentry, is taking classes
this summer. His intellectual capac
ity is filled with CSIO6A and
Physics 28/29. As he comes back
from a severe back injury, Oi also
plans on training 15 hours a week
this summer.
And while five gymnasts and
their teammates are free of work,
school, and training obligations for
each other, they try to bond outside
the gym. Oi says there will be plen
ty of barbecues and beach time
throughout July and August, while
the others speak excitedly about
the team's annual trip down to Los
Angeles for the Fish Fry a week
end of costumes, dancing, food and
drinks hosted by former Stanford
gymnast Eli Alcaraz, class of 2008.

passions, advance their studies and prepare for the season ahead.
