## SPEAKERS & EVENTS Russian president visits Stanford Medvedev seeks to learn from Silicon Valley's successes 
### JOSHUA FALK STAFF WRITER 
Russian President Dmitri
Medvedev visited the Silicon Valley
with a goal to develop an innograd, a
mecca for tech industry modeled
after the Valley, in the Moscow sub
urbs. Following visits to Twitter,
Apple and Cisco, Medvedev present
ed a 10-point plan to boost Russia's
tech industry in Dinkelspiel Audito
rium on Wednesday, June 23.
"Russia must become one of the
leaders of innovative development,"
Medvedev said.
Having met with Steve Jobs at
Apple headquarters earlier that day
in Cupertino, where he received a
yet-to-be-released iPhone 4, the
tech-savvy Russian president chose
to read his speech notes off an Apple
iPad instead of paper.
"What I managed to see yesterday
night and today is inspiring,"
Medvedev said. "It is not by chance I
came here. I wanted to see with my
own eyes the origin of success."
In his speech, Medvedev ac
knowledged the need to provide
grants for scholars and researchers.

He also stressed the need to protect
intellectual property rights and en
able all Russians to access broad
band Internet.
"We would like to make sure that
talented people get all the possibili
ties to tap their full potential," he
said.
Medvedev also acknowledged
Russia's constantly developing polit
ical system.
"We are ready to further improve
our political system," he said, "but of
course we are going to do it by our
selves, without any mentoring from
the outside world."
"My task, as the president, is to
raise the authority of the court to the
extent possible and create a reliable
and trustworthy judicial system," he
added.
Medvedev also stressed that capi
tal must reach the right people in
order for the tech industry to flourish
in Russia.
"In Russia, we have money
and, in a number of cases, big money
but we don't have Silicon Valley,"
Medvedev said.
Medvedev gave the speech in
Russian, but simultaneous English
translation was available. Many at
tendees chose to ask the president
questions in Russian.
In response to an audience mem
ber's question, Medvedev said it was
unlikely that Russia and Georgia
could repair their relations while
Georgian President Mikheil
Saakashvili remained in office.
Following Medvedev's address,
University Provost John
Etchemendy invited former Secre
taries of State George Shultz and
Condoleezza Rice to the stage,
where the secretaries presented
Medvedev with a gift from the
Hoover Archives.
"I am inspired by what I saw here
in Silicon Valley and California and
Stanford," Medvedev said.
"I am sort of jealous of all of you
here because you have an opportuni
ty to be creative, to teach, to make
money, to do something you love and
quickly see your work yielding fruit,"
Medvedev said. "What is it, if not
happiness?"
"This is a historic day for Stan
ford," said attendee Laura Walch,
who thought Medvedev was person
able, direct and approachable. "I was
very honored to be here."
Others praised the approach
Medvedev took toward fostering pri
vate industry.
"He is a great leader," said Igor
Chirashnya, originally from Uzbek
istan in the former Soviet Union.
"He knows that it's not about gov

mosphere in the country."
"It was interesting to see an open
dialogue," said Andre Samsonov, a
Russian citizen who works in IT ser
vices in Seattle. "The atmosphere
was good."
But outside the auditorium in
White Plaza, the atmosphere was
less cordial. A group of local Geor
gians numbering in the twenties held
a protest after the speech, displaying
Georgian flags and signs that read,
"Abkhazia is Georgia" and "You are
not welcome here. Nor is your wor
ship."
Following his visit to Stanford
and Silicon Valley, Medvedev flew
to Washington to meet with Presi
dent Obama before heading to
Canada for the G8 and G2O summits.
