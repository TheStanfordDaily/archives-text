## Board moves against use of conflict minerals 
### MARISA LANDICHO FEATURES EDITOR 
The Stanford Board of Trustees
moved to uphold the University's
commitment to socially conscious in
vestment at its meeting on June 9-10.
The proposal in question, which was
unanimously approved by the Advi
sory Panel on Investment Responsi
bility & Licensing (APIR-L) in April,
encourages shareholder companies to
avoid using conflict minerals and con
flict mineral derivatives.
The guidelines state that the Uni
versity will approve shareholder res
olutions that ask companies to report
the minerals used in supply chains.
The conflict minerals, such as tanta
lite, tin and tungsten, are used in
many common electronics. Armed
groups in Congo have financed their
campaigns through the sale of these
minerals.
"The proxy voting guideline is
very narrowly drawn and broadly
supportive of efforts by leading tech
nology and electronics companies to
address the problem of conflict min
erals in their supply chain," said
Leslie Hume, the chair of the Board
of Trustees.
While students have been work
ing on this move since September,
Stanford's Student Anti-Genocide

Coalition (STAND) first proposed
the initiative the first of its kind to
be passed by any major university
to the administration in February. It
was then approved by APIR-L in a 7-
0 vote on April 23 before being sent
to the Board of Trustees. Hume
would not comment on whether the
board voted unanimously.
STAND worked with APIR-L to
draft the final resolution's language,
according to outgoing STAND pres
ident Angie McPhaul 'lO.
"This is a movement that's grow
ing, and Stanford is making an early
statement," she said. "It's significant
because we're so close to Silicon Val
ley."
STAND is now working with
groups at Yale, Harvard and George
town to pass similar initiatives and
encourage more academic research
on the subject. McPhaul expects the
Stanford resolution to "come into
play" in the fall.
"It was very clear that the students
at STAND had done a lot of work on
this," Hume said, praising their "dili
gent research."
