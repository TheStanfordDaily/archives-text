## Hennessy describes long-term education challenges 
### ERIC MESSINGER SENIOR MANAGING EDITOR 
In the final Faculty Senate meet
ing of the 2009-10 academic year,
University President John Hen
nessy outlined a series of long-term
challenges for Stanford and other
research universities. He focused on
interactions with the federal govern
ment, economic pressures on fami
lies and institutions, and the process
of integrating Stanford with an in
ternationalized world.
Hennessy opened by discussing
the role of the federal government
in the funding of research, noting
how integral that support was for
Stanford's activities.
"Higher education in this coun
try has been fortunate since the end
of the Second World War to get a
great deal of support for its research
mission from the federal govern
ment," he said. "It's been a mission
that has shown a particularly en
lightened and largely bipartisan sup
port from both sides of the aisle over
the years. And obviously the U.S.
leads in many fields of research di
rectly because of this support."
If and when decreases occur in
the United States' discretionary
spending to reduce the country's
long-term deficits, Hennessy said he
believed that "there will be more
pressure on higher education than
ever" to protect and preserve re
search funding. He also warned of

wider negative effects than those
faced by institutions like Stanford.
"Should that happen, not only
would it damage the research lead
ership we have had in U.S. universi
ties, but also in the long term, it will
damage economic growth in this
country and put us into a spiral that
will be quite unfortunate."
The impact of the federal regula
tion on Stanford, Hennessy said, will
also be a vital issue. He adopted a
critical tone toward discussions of
eliminating or countering all conflict
of interest in research, stating that to
do so would rob Stanford and other
institutions of some positive bene
fits of collaboration with industry
and reduce the impact of research
on the marketplace. Hennessy said
he preferred allowing for some
"managed conflict situations."
"I am, by the way, for full and
completely open transparency,"
Hennessy added. "I am for careful
monitoring of conflicts that we
know occur."
Hennessy also displayed skepti
cism toward proposed federal regu
lations of university endowments
and accreditations, framing the
issue as both a challenge to Stanford
and the wider health of American
higher education. He noted, too,
that forcing a higher rate of endow
ment payout could backfire.
"Obviously we have had the fi
