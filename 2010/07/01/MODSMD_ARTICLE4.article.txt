## Hennessy describes long-term education challenges 
### ERIC MESSINGER SENIOR MANAGING EDITOR 
In the final Faculty Senate meet
ing of the 2009-10 academic year,
University President John Hen
nessy outlined a series of long-term
challenges for Stanford and other
research universities. He focused on
interactions with the federal govern
ment, economic pressures on fami
lies and institutions, and the process
of integrating Stanford with an in
ternationalized world.
Hennessy opened by discussing
the role of the federal government
in the funding of research, noting
how integral that support was for
Stanford's activities.
"Higher education in this coun
try has been fortunate since the end
of the Second World War to get a
great deal of support for its research
mission from the federal govern
ment," he said. "It's been a mission
that has shown a particularly en
lightened and largely bipartisan sup
port from both sides of the aisle over
the years. And obviously the U.S.
leads in many fields of research di
rectly because of this support."
If and when decreases occur in
the United States' discretionary
spending to reduce the country's
long-term deficits, Hennessy said he
believed that "there will be more
pressure on higher education than
ever" to protect and preserve re
search funding. He also warned of

wider negative effects than those
faced by institutions like Stanford.
"Should that happen, not only
would it damage the research lead
ership we have had in U.S. universi
ties, but also in the long term, it will
damage economic growth in this
country and put us into a spiral that
will be quite unfortunate."
The impact of the federal regula
tion on Stanford, Hennessy said, will
also be a vital issue. He adopted a
critical tone toward discussions of
eliminating or countering all conflict
of interest in research, stating that to
do so would rob Stanford and other
institutions of some positive bene
fits of collaboration with industry
and reduce the impact of research
on the marketplace. Hennessy said
he preferred allowing for some
"managed conflict situations."
"I am, by the way, for full and
completely open transparency,"
Hennessy added. "I am for careful
monitoring of conflicts that we
know occur."
Hennessy also displayed skepti
cism toward proposed federal regu
lations of university endowments
and accreditations, framing the
issue as both a challenge to Stanford
and the wider health of American
higher education. He noted, too,
that forcing a higher rate of endow
ment payout could backfire.
"Obviously we have had the fi
nancial tsunami here to clearly indi
cate that conservative endowment
payouts probably are a good thing,"
Hennessy said.
The costs of providing higher ed
ucation to students, Hennessy said,
will also prove a greater challenge in
upcoming years. Turning first to the
problems of families seeking to pay
for a college education, Hennessy
argued that current trends of rising
tuition costs were in many cases not
sustainable.
"For an institution like Stanford
that has such a large number of ap
plicants and an aggressive financial
aid program, for us it's more about
the public perception, but the public
perception could come back to
haunt us in lots of difficult ways,"
Hennessy said. "We've managed to
maintain affordability by increasing
financial aid, but that is not a solu
tion that all institutions can
achieve."
Economic pressures will also
come to bear on public universities
in upcoming years through cuts to
many state budgets, and Hennessy
said that negative effects on institu
tions like UC-Berkeley will have
wide detrimental effects.
"The U.S. will be poorer, Cali
fornia will be poorer, the Bay Area
will be poorer, institutions like
Stanford will be poorer if the long
term health of a great public system
like the UC system continues to be
assailed and the quality of that insti
tution goes down," Hennessy said.
"It will hurt all of us in the long
term."
While he noted that Stanford
had a limited ability to alter the sit
uation beyond spreading aware
ness, he added that "it's critical to
remember that the vast majority of
people who get a college degree in
this country get it in a public institu
tion, and we need to ensure that
they remain as vibrant and as great
as they are."
Returning to a theme that he em
phasized in discussions with mem

bers of the House of Representa
tives in January, Hennessy also ar
gued for the benefits of educating
international students and collabo
rating with international re
searchers, and the benefits he saw in
the United States adopting a coop
erative and welcoming attitude.
"I think we should still continue,
for as long as we can, to attract the
best and brightest," he said. "I'm in
the Tom Friedman school, which
says you staple a green card to their
diploma. But not everybody in the
United States is ready to take that
radical a position."
"After all, we have only invested
$lOO,OOO, $200,000 in this Ph.D.
who's graduating, and we should
send them out of the country quick
ly? This seems silly to me," he
added.
Hennessy also noted a potential
avenue for increasing the size of the
population educated by Stanford in
the long term. While discussions of
class size expansion at Stanford
stalled with the onset of the Univer
sity's budget crisis, he pointed to in
ternational opportunities to achieve
similar results through cooperation
or the introduction of a branch cam
pus, perhaps in the Pacific Rim.
"Stanford has had a long rela
tionship with parts of the world
where it has actually helped build
educational infrastructure, in Tai
wan, in Korea and other places," he
said. "So there are a variety of differ
ent roles we can think about playing
in that, going even so far as thinking
about, would you someday consider
a branch campus somewhere?"
Hennessy added that he would
strongly resist any model where
such a campus was only a "store
front" with the Stanford name, say
ing "there is nobody who can pay
me nearly enough money for me to
think about doing that."
The June 10 meeting was the last
of the 42nd Faculty Senate, chaired

Andrea Goldsmith. Medical profes
sor David Spiegel will chair the 43rd

nessy outlined a series of long-term
challenges for Stanford and other
research universities. He focused on
interactions with the federal govern
ment, economic pressures on fami
lies and institutions, and the process
of integrating Stanford with an in
ternationalized world.
Hennessy opened by discussing
the role of the federal government
in the funding of research, noting
how integral that support was for
Stanford's activities.
"Higher education in this coun
try has been fortunate since the end
of the Second World War to get a
great deal of support for its research
mission from the federal govern
ment," he said. "It's been a mission
that has shown a particularly en
lightened and largely bipartisan sup
port from both sides of the aisle over
the years. And obviously the U.S.
leads in many fields of research di
rectly because of this support."
If and when decreases occur in
the United States' discretionary
spending to reduce the country's
long-term deficits, Hennessy said he
believed that "there will be more
pressure on higher education than
ever" to protect and preserve re
search funding. He also warned of

wider negative effects than those
faced by institutions like Stanford.
"Should that happen, not only
would it damage the research lead
ership we have had in U.S. universi
ties, but also in the long term, it will
damage economic growth in this
country and put us into a spiral that
will be quite unfortunate."
The impact of the federal regula
tion on Stanford, Hennessy said, will
also be a vital issue. He adopted a
critical tone toward discussions of
eliminating or countering all conflict
of interest in research, stating that to
do so would rob Stanford and other
institutions of some positive bene
fits of collaboration with industry
and reduce the impact of research
on the marketplace. Hennessy said
he preferred allowing for some
"managed conflict situations."
"I am, by the way, for full and
completely open transparency,"
Hennessy added. "I am for careful
monitoring of conflicts that we
know occur."
Hennessy also displayed skepti
cism toward proposed federal regu
lations of university endowments
and accreditations, framing the
issue as both a challenge to Stanford
and the wider health of American
higher education. He noted, too,
that forcing a higher rate of endow
ment payout could backfire.
"Obviously we have had the fi
nancial tsunami here to clearly indi
cate that conservative endowment
payouts probably are a good thing,"
Hennessy said.
The costs of providing higher ed
ucation to students, Hennessy said,
will also prove a greater challenge in
upcoming years. Turning first to the
problems of families seeking to pay
for a college education, Hennessy
argued that current trends of rising
tuition costs were in many cases not
sustainable.
"For an institution like Stanford
that has such a large number of ap
plicants and an aggressive financial
aid program, for us it's more about
the public perception, but the public
perception could come back to
haunt us in lots of difficult ways,"
Hennessy said. "We've managed to
maintain affordability by increasing
financial aid, but that is not a solu
tion that all institutions can
achieve."
Economic pressures will also
come to bear on public universities
in upcoming years through cuts to
many state budgets, and Hennessy
said that negative effects on institu
tions like UC-Berkeley will have
wide detrimental effects.
"The U.S. will be poorer, Cali
fornia will be poorer, the Bay Area
will be poorer, institutions like
Stanford will be poorer if the long
term health of a great public system
like the UC system continues to be
assailed and the quality of that insti
tution goes down," Hennessy said.
"It will hurt all of us in the long
term."
While he noted that Stanford
had a limited ability to alter the sit
uation beyond spreading aware
ness, he added that "it's critical to
remember that the vast majority of
people who get a college degree in
this country get it in a public institu
tion, and we need to ensure that
they remain as vibrant and as great
as they are."
Returning to a theme that he em
phasized in discussions with mem

bers of the House of Representa
tives in January, Hennessy also ar
gued for the benefits of educating
international students and collabo
rating with international re
searchers, and the benefits he saw in
the United States adopting a coop
erative and welcoming attitude.
"I think we should still continue,
for as long as we can, to attract the
best and brightest," he said. "I'm in
the Tom Friedman school, which
says you staple a green card to their
diploma. But not everybody in the
United States is ready to take that
radical a position."
"After all, we have only invested
$lOO,OOO, $200,000 in this Ph.D.
who's graduating, and we should
send them out of the country quick
ly? This seems silly to me," he
added.
Hennessy also noted a potential
avenue for increasing the size of the
population educated by Stanford in
the long term. While discussions of
class size expansion at Stanford
stalled with the onset of the Univer
sity's budget crisis, he pointed to in
ternational opportunities to achieve
similar results through cooperation
or the introduction of a branch cam
pus, perhaps in the Pacific Rim.
"Stanford has had a long rela
tionship with parts of the world
where it has actually helped build
educational infrastructure, in Tai
wan, in Korea and other places," he
said. "So there are a variety of differ
ent roles we can think about playing
in that, going even so far as thinking
about, would you someday consider
a branch campus somewhere?"
Hennessy added that he would
strongly resist any model where
such a campus was only a "store
front" with the Stanford name, say
ing "there is nobody who can pay
me nearly enough money for me to
think about doing that."
The June 10 meeting was the last
of the 42nd Faculty Senate, chaired
by electrical engineering professor
Andrea Goldsmith. Medical profes
sor David Spiegel will chair the 43rd
Senate, whose first meeting is set
tentatively for Oct. 7.
