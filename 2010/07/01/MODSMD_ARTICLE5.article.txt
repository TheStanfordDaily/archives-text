## Rice recalls Stanford years, calls for students to serve Highlights global poverty as a moral issue and national security challenge 
### JOSHUA FALK STAFF WRITER 
U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice 'B6
recalled her time as a Stanford student and urged gradu
ates to take an active role in bettering the world during her
address at the 119 th Commencement on Sunday, June 13
at Stanford Stadium.
"Susan Rice has been breaking boundaries and surpris
ing people her entire life," said University President John
Hennessy in his introduction.
"Stanford has had an enormous impact on my life," Rice
said, stating that the Farm taught her focus and discipline.
"Once you've learned to study on the grass with mus
cled men throwing a Frisbee over your head, you can ac
complish almost anything," she said.
"Hold onto this jubilant moment and cherish your
memories of this extraordinary place," she added. "The
warmth and security of Stanford can sustain you ... as you
enter a world changing at a furious pace."
Rice surveyed many of the global changes that have
taken place since she graduated from Stanford 24 years ago.
"In 1986, only 0.2 percent of the United States popula

tion had a cell phone," Rice said. "Twenty-four hour news
was in its infancy."
"The face of America has changed too," she added.
Rice urged graduates to take an active role in effecting
positive change.
"Things get better because we make them better, and
things go wrong when we get too comfortable," she said.
"If you want change, you have to make it. If we want
progress, we have to drive it."
Rice said that global poverty was "not only one of the
great moral challenges of all time, but also one of the great
est national security challenges of our time."
She also focused on one memory of giving an old base
ball cap to an impoverished boy in Angola.
"That little boy's future is tied to ours," she said. "We
must shape the world that he deserves."
Rice urged students to better their world by joining the
Peace Corps and Teach for America, and to work to end
child labor, forced marriages and human trafficking.
"Graduating from Stanford is great, but it's just the be
ginning," she said.
Rice said that as a senior at Stanford, her goal was to be
come a U.S. senator.
"I've not followed a preordained path," she said.
"Rather, I've tried to push myself, stretch myself."
Family and rewards beyond financial success were also,

for Rice, a vital part of life.
"Comfort and economic security
are good, but they're not enough,"
she said. "As you're changing the
world, never neglect family. There's
usually someone else who can do
your job, but there's no one else who
can be a loving child or a devoted
parent."
Attendees found Rice's speech
both touching and motivational.
"I thought overall it was good,"
said Adam Grossman, who received
his Ph.D. in bioengineering. "She laid
out a good challenge for everyone."
"This speech just blew me away,"
said Tunji Munabi 'O9.
"This is a day of celebration, and
you have certainly earned it," Hen
nessy told graduates following Rice's
address.
He also echoed Rice's call to service.

"We believe a Stanford education
brings with it a responsibility to
make use of your knowledge and
make the world a better place for fu
ture generations," Hennessy said.
The University expected to award
1,727 bachelor's degrees, 2,109 mas
ter's degrees and 1,016 doctoral de
grees on Sunday, June 13, according
to a statement released before the
ceremony.
Rice holds a bachelor's degree in
history from Stanford. She was a
Truman scholar and graduated with
Phi Beta Kappa honors before earn
ing master's and doctorate degrees in
international relations from Oxford
on a Rhodes scholarship.
