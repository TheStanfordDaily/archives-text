## THIS COLUMN SENT FROM MY IPHONE Stanford: Now an Actual Summer Camp 
### Peter McDonald 
With the intersession period officially
over for almost two weeks now,
Stanford has decreed that summer
has officially started (the solstice and the start
of the quarter happened to fall on the same
day this year), and it don't take long to notice
that summer@Stanford looks a little bit differ
ent than the academic year. In an oddly fitting
twist of fate, the World's Perpetual Summer
Camp goes literal; Stanford transmogrifies
into an actual summer camp all season long,
and it never gets boring to watch that happen.
Even after three years of RF kids and punk
14-year-old skaters wiping out on the steps of
Old Union, it's still weird to see children on
this campus, much less large groups of them.
Children on this campus always seem like
they're walking around in oversize grown-up
clothes, which is ironic considering how this
place is built for the bicycle. No matter though,
busloads of 'em keep coming week in and
week out. They all carry that delightfully
teenage blend of smugness and confusion,
crystallized in the contemptuous yelling of
"Cool scooter! Can I ride it?" in my direction
as I zip by them, all while in the process of
being escorted to yet another organized activ
ity. Their internal issues are all on display.
They become the opposite of the Stanford
duck, which I guess would be a hummingbird.
Not that I'm not somewhat jealous of them

though. As a teenager I would have loved to
have gone to Stanford for camp. The closest I
ever approached a university setting was
Shawnee State University in Portsmouth,
Ohio, where we stayed in cabins that had the
setup of a Motel 6 and listened to the same
Toby Keith album on repeat (it was already in
the player and nobody had brought any other
music). Instead, these ungrateful snots get to
hole up in our beautiful old row houses, filled
with history that they know nothing about
because Housing scrubs away any trace of stu
dent presence. Even in their faux-pristine state
though, places like Kairos and Phi Psi are way
cooler buildings than any that I've ever seen at
camp.
Yessiree, they might not realize it, but these
campers are living pretty high off the hog, or
large clump of tofu shaped into a hog depend
ing on your dietary preferences, because
Stanford Dining is far more accommodating
than any mess hall. The sports camp kids are
getting tips from all those Director's Cup-win
ning athletes in some of the best facilities in
the world. The nerd camp kids get to learn
about video game design in the computer sci
ence Mecca, and my friends that are EPGY
counselors are some of the brightest people I
know. There's significantly less urine in Avery
than there is in the average swimmin' hole,
and Tres Ex and Jamba Juice beat the pants

off of anything my canteens could ever come
up with. Just imagine the woodworking possi
bilities given the resources of the product
design lab. One stay at almost any of these
camps would assuredly have provided me with
three scrapbooks of Memories That Will Last
a Lifetime and reason to actually tear up upon
hearing "Good Riddance."
Of course, Memories That Will Last a
Lifetime don't come for free, and that's never
truer than it is here. A sojourn to some of
these camp websites left me with a sticker
shock I hadn't felt in three years. Camp is
always expensive, but most don't cost $4,700
for three weeks. I'm pretty sure that's more
than the camp I went to where Bruce Willis
sent all three of his kids. It's not just money
that turns camp into a transaction: camps are
also another form of college app resume
building. All their websites sell the skills you
will learn at their camp as much as, if not
more, than the experiences, which makes
sense because "I'm not just spending $4700 on
a three week long babysitter; I'm investing it in
my children's future," or some other authori
tative parental reason like that. At these
camps, kids are supposed be learning about
global issues, professional-level computer pro
grams, and sound basketball fundamentals,
and sometimes they even get graded. Best not
to mention all this to the campers though.

After all, camp's supposed to fun, and when
they're not yelling at me on my scooter, they
usually look like they're having it.

Similarly nostalgic? Commiserate at petermc@

Of course, Memories That
Will Last a Lifetime don't
come for free, and that's
never truer than it is here.
