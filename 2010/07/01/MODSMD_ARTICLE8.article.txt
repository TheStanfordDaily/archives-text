# OH! SWEET NUTHIN'
## Selling Your Soul 
### Roseann Cima 
It's becoming increasingly obvious that run
ning a political campaign in this country is
essentially the same as running an advertis
ing agency. For those of you who don't watch
"Mad Men," advertising is all about branding.
You don't sell your product directly you
use a brand to imply the things you can use to
sell it: respect, glamour, love. While advertis
ers have to worry about the veracity of their
explicit promises, it's comparably easy to just
slap a brand, symbolizing whatever they want,
onto their product. Or their grassroots move
ment. If it's successful enough, there's not
much stopping them from sticking it to other
things. Brand Obama has sold more t-shirts,
novelty beers and commemorative mint tins
than Alf sold pogs.
So it's not surprising that the National
Marriage Boycott (NMB) fliers in bathroom
stalls across campus look strikingly like
American Apparel ads: color portraits on a
white background, black text at the bottom
and a staggered, all-caps logo along the side,
adjusted to fit. And it's all in Helvetica, the
font so hip they made a movie about it.
In some ways, this makes a lot of sense. It's
a youth movement, and what do kids like more
than American Apparel? The stereotypical
AA customer is disaffected enough to excuse

his lack of political action on Prop 8 by claim
ing not to care about marriage. To him,
inequality is just another strike against an
institution that was already too bourgeois to
bother with. For this person, the NMB should
be a challenge to turn that indifference into a
political statement. If he doesn't boycott mar
riage, he must care about it. He intends some
day to get married, presumably to the person
of his choice. And why shouldn't everyone
have that freedom? People like him might be
an ochre v-neck-wearing silent majority.
Targeting hipsters in an attempt to corner
them out of their fashionable apathy, (not
unlike AA itself did when it gave out free
"Legalize Gay" shirts last year), seems like a
smart move on NMB's part.
But why did an improbable number of
these NMB fliers end up crumpled and foot
printed on my co-op's bathroom floor? I high
ly doubt that the good hippies of Synergy
House were offended by marriage equality.
This is a community that celebrates the com
ing of spring with a big, naked, beet juice-cov
ered dance around a Maypole. I think those
fliers were taken down because of what the
brand implied, which has disturbing implica
tions for the movement if it doesn't revise its
campaign.

American Apparel ads pull off their Ã¼ber
minimalist style by relying on provocative con
tent. The photos are of pretty young men and
women in flashy colors, pin-up poses and
revealing clothing. The text, while sparse, is
chock-full of brand names and buzzwords. It's
catchy, it's smart and it's all very attention
grabbing. Brand AA sells on sex and wit, and
their ads have more than enough of both to fill
a billboard without the bells and whistles of a
serifated font.
The National Marriage Boycott is trying to
use the same formula for sincerity instead of
sex. No wonder they're coming off vapid. The
photos are of young people in poses that I can
only assume are supposed to look profound. A
young man on a flat background with a firm
mouth, soft eyes and a hand clasped before his
chest. Two glossy lovers in front of the
Conservatory of Flowers, glaring into the sun
set. The text is quotations: "Why I boycott," in
the form of sweeping statements about "love,"
"equality" and "struggle." There is no chal
lenge here, and nothing surprising. Just
teenagers with expensive cameras taking
themselves very seriously. Boys without girl
friends, who eat ramen for breakfast and
spend their weekdays playing Call of Duty, are
boycotting marriage in a heroic act of sacrifice?

It's enough to make me gag.
It's not just because they're young.
Imagine if there were similar posters in the
1960s with photos of middle-aged white
Americans, faces stone-like, fists raised and
quoted about their painful decision not to
play on segregated tennis courts. The gravity
of a boycott isn't held by the boycotters. The
whole point is that the sacrifice is negligible
when compared to the severity of the real
struggle, and what stands to be gained. If
enough straight couples opt for civil unions
over marriages that this becomes the norm,
then, culturally, NMB will have the equality
it's fighting for. It's more likely that the trend
itself would be enough to push legislation for
ward. But for this to happen the brand needs
to come across as not just another way to pad
resumes and coddle consciences. The only
way to gain legitimacy is to demonstrate per
spective. To consciously affect progress, they
need to know where they stand.
