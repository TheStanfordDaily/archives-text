## Utah and Colorado join Pac-10 Historic changes take place in Cardinal's athletic conference 
### CLAUDIA PRECIADO STAFF WRITER 
After the original consideration of
expanding the Pac-10 to 16 teams, the
conference will officially expand to 12
with the addition of Utah and
Colorado.
The original expansion was
rumored to include Texas, Texas
A&M, Texas Tech, Oklahoma,
Oklahoma State and Colorado; howev
er, with the realignment of Missouri to
the Big 10 and Colorado to the Pac-10,
the remaining 10 schools will stay with
the Big 12, at least for this year.
Senior Athletic Assistant Director
Jim Young said the University "fully
supports the inclusion of Colorado and
Utah into the Pac-10 Conference," cit
ing the move's strengthening of the
conference.
On June 10, Colorado accepted the
Pac-10's invitation, becoming the first
team since 1978 to join the organiza
tion.
Larry Scott, the Pac-10 commission
er, commented on the decision to invite
Colorado during a media teleconfer
ence.
"We have been looking at Colorado
for quite some time," he said. "We have
been through a pretty exhaustive and
deliberate process and it was clear to us
that in any scenario we were going to
consider for expansion Colorado was a
great fit."
On June 17, Utah became the 12th
and final member to join the confer
ence. Utah joins the Pac-10 from the
Mountain West Conference.
The most pressing matter for finaliz
ing the Pac-10 expansion, and perhaps
its main motivation, involved media
contracts. In 2011, new media contracts
will be drawn between the conference
and its various entertainment networks.
"Almost all conference expansion is
driven by television and media in gen
eral and the ability to turn those align
ments into dollars for the member insti
tutions," said Bob Bowlsby, Stanford's
director of athletics. "And so I'd say
that this one was driven as much by that
as any other factor."
According to Bowlsby, the Pac-10
has two options in regards to media
contracts: They can sell their rights to
networks such as ESPN, or the Pac-10
can create a conference network. Both
are viable options, which are projected
to increase funding by about two- or
three-fold, according to Bowlsby.
For Stanford, the significantly
increased funding should create budget
relief and offset concern that the
endowment support to the athletics

department would drop and affect
scholarships.
"Most of our endowment is dedicat
ed endowment, that is, was put in place
specifically for a football scholarship or
a field hockey scholarship or a women's
basketball scholarship, and so those
proceeds are going to continue to come
in," Bowlsby said.
"I think it's a fair question to ask
whether or not people will look at that
as a good place to put their money, but
our fans and alumni are terrific sup
porters and I think they're going to help
in any way they can," he continued.
The next item on the conference's
agenda is to decide on the scheduling
and division of the Pac-12. The division
of the 12 schools has yet to be deter
mined. Some have speculated about a
north-south split with Stanford,
California, Oregon, Oregon State,
Washington and Washington State
forming the "Pac-12 North" and USC,
UCLA, Arizona, Arizona State, Utah
and Colorado forming the "Pac-12
South."
As of now, officials say they have
not determined the specifics of the divi
sion. The alignment of the split, howev
er, could entirely change the nature of
the conference and the traditional rival
ries among particular schools.
" I think we'd probably both be
excited if Cal and Stanford were play
ing for the conference championship,
[and] we'd probably be okay with it
regardless of how often we played
them. It's highly likely that Stanford
and Cal would end up being in the same
division if we went to divisions, but
those are things you have to work
through," Bowlsby said.
Though next year's schedules do
demonstrate some matchups between
original Pac-10 schools and the newly
added members, "the intention is that
[the integration] would start in 2012, for
all sports at the same time," Scott said.
However, recent information from the
Pac-10 suggests a possibility for integra
tion to begin in 2011 for Utah and 2012
for Colorado.
Colorado joins the conference with
11 varsity teams: basketball (men and
women), cross-country (women), foot
ball, golf (men and women), skiing
(men), soccer (women), tennis
(women), track and field (women) and

volleyball (women).
While most Pac-10 schools have a
minimum of 15 varsity teams (Stanford
having the most with 35), Colorado will
not be expected to add any varsity
teams in order to compete in the con
ference.
"In the Pac-10, schools are known
for a broad-based sports, with some
even playing in the Mountain Pacific
Sports Conference, so undoubtedly, it
would be a sport-by-sport scenario,"
Scott said about the future of particular
sports that do not exactly match up with
the current infrastructure of the confer
ence.
Utah joins with 18 varsity sports. For
the men, the Utes play baseball, basket
ball, football, golf, skiing, swimming &
diving and tennis. Women's sports
include basketball, cross country, gym
nastics, skiing, soccer, Softball, swim
ming & diving, tennis, track & field and
volleyball.
While many of Stanford's teams will
not be facing Colorado and Utah solely
because not all the schools have the
appropriate sports programs, the
University's major sports will be affect
ed by the new additions.
"I think it challenges basketball
scheduling a little bit," Bowlsby said.
"We're pretty unlikely to play twenty
two league games in basketball. We've
had a long history in men's and
women's basketball of playing a full
double round robin, and I don't know
that that's reasonable at this point."
"Colorado is a relatively small pro
gram in terms of the number of sports,
and so that doesn't change too much for
us," Bowlsby added. "In the case of
Utah they have a relatively broad pro
gram and have had some success in a
wide variety of areas, so I think it helps
us in some sports."
The expansion has undoubtedly
increased the conference's options in
negotiating media contracts and possi
bly in determining conference champi
onships, yet planning and consultation
in regard to financing and scheduling
remains underway.

[and] we'd probably be okay with it
regardless of how often we played
them. It's highly likely that Stanford
and Cal would end up being in the same
division if we went to divisions, but
those are things you have to work
through," Bowlsby said.
Though next year's schedules do
demonstrate some matchups between
original Pac-10 schools and the newly
added members, "the intention is that
[the integration] would start in 2012, for
all sports at the same time," Scott said.
However, recent information from the
Pac-10 suggests a possibility for integra
tion to begin in 2011 for Utah and 2012
for Colorado.
Colorado joins the conference with
11 varsity teams: basketball (men and
women), cross-country (women), foot
ball, golf (men and women), skiing
(men), soccer (women), tennis
(women), track and field (women) and

volleyball (women).
While most Pac-10 schools have a
minimum of 15 varsity teams (Stanford
having the most with 35), Colorado will
not be expected to add any varsity
teams in order to compete in the con
ference.
"In the Pac-10, schools are known
for a broad-based sports, with some
even playing in the Mountain Pacific
Sports Conference, so undoubtedly, it
would be a sport-by-sport scenario,"
Scott said about the future of particular
sports that do not exactly match up with
the current infrastructure of the confer
ence.
Utah joins with 18 varsity sports. For
the men, the Utes play baseball, basket
ball, football, golf, skiing, swimming &
diving and tennis. Women's sports
include basketball, cross country, gym
nastics, skiing, soccer, Softball, swim
ming & diving, tennis, track & field and
volleyball.
While many of Stanford's teams will
not be facing Colorado and Utah solely
because not all the schools have the
appropriate sports programs, the
University's major sports will be affect
ed by the new additions.
"I think it challenges basketball
scheduling a little bit," Bowlsby said.
"We're pretty unlikely to play twenty
two league games in basketball. We've
had a long history in men's and
women's basketball of playing a full
double round robin, and I don't know
that that's reasonable at this point."
"Colorado is a relatively small pro
gram in terms of the number of sports,
and so that doesn't change too much for
us," Bowlsby added. "In the case of
Utah they have a relatively broad pro
gram and have had some success in a
wide variety of areas, so I think it helps
us in some sports."
The expansion has undoubtedly
increased the conference's options in
negotiating media contracts and possi
bly in determining conference champi
onships, yet planning and consultation
in regard to financing and scheduling
remains underway.

While the Pac-10 conference has yet to announce an official change to its
name, it may be that Stanford's top athletes will soon be hoisting a different
banner - "Pac-North," "Pac-12" or another name entirely.
After the original consideration of
expanding the Pac-10 to 16 teams, the
conference will officially expand to 12
with the addition of Utah and
Colorado.
The original expansion was
rumored to include Texas, Texas
A&M, Texas Tech, Oklahoma,
Oklahoma State and Colorado; howev
er, with the realignment of Missouri to
the Big 10 and Colorado to the Pac-10,
the remaining 10 schools will stay with
the Big 12, at least for this year.
Senior Athletic Assistant Director
Jim Young said the University "fully
supports the inclusion of Colorado and
Utah into the Pac-10 Conference," cit
ing the move's strengthening of the
conference.
On June 10, Colorado accepted the
Pac-10's invitation, becoming the first
team since 1978 to join the organiza
tion.
Larry Scott, the Pac-10 commission
er, commented on the decision to invite
Colorado during a media teleconfer
ence.
"We have been looking at Colorado
for quite some time," he said. "We have
been through a pretty exhaustive and
deliberate process and it was clear to us
that in any scenario we were going to
consider for expansion Colorado was a
great fit."
On June 17, Utah became the 12th
and final member to join the confer
ence. Utah joins the Pac-10 from the
Mountain West Conference.
The most pressing matter for finaliz
ing the Pac-10 expansion, and perhaps
its main motivation, involved media
contracts. In 2011, new media contracts
will be drawn between the conference
and its various entertainment networks.
"Almost all conference expansion is
driven by television and media in gen
eral and the ability to turn those align
ments into dollars for the member insti
tutions," said Bob Bowlsby, Stanford's
director of athletics. "And so I'd say
that this one was driven as much by that
as any other factor."
According to Bowlsby, the Pac-10
has two options in regards to media
contracts: They can sell their rights to
networks such as ESPN, or the Pac-10
can create a conference network. Both
are viable options, which are projected
to increase funding by about two- or
three-fold, according to Bowlsby.
For Stanford, the significantly
increased funding should create budget
relief and offset concern that the
endowment support to the athletics

department would drop and affect
scholarships.
"Most of our endowment is dedicat
ed endowment, that is, was put in place
specifically for a football scholarship or
a field hockey scholarship or a women's
basketball scholarship, and so those
proceeds are going to continue to come
in," Bowlsby said.
"I think it's a fair question to ask
whether or not people will look at that
as a good place to put their money, but
our fans and alumni are terrific sup
porters and I think they're going to help
in any way they can," he continued.
The next item on the conference's
agenda is to decide on the scheduling
and division of the Pac-12. The division
of the 12 schools has yet to be deter
mined. Some have speculated about a
north-south split with Stanford,
California, Oregon, Oregon State,
Washington and Washington State
forming the "Pac-12 North" and USC,
UCLA, Arizona, Arizona State, Utah
and Colorado forming the "Pac-12
South."
As of now, officials say they have
not determined the specifics of the divi
sion. The alignment of the split, howev
er, could entirely change the nature of
the conference and the traditional rival
ries among particular schools.
" I think we'd probably both be
excited if Cal and Stanford were play
ing for the conference championship,
[and] we'd probably be okay with it
regardless of how often we played
them. It's highly likely that Stanford
and Cal would end up being in the same
division if we went to divisions, but
those are things you have to work
through," Bowlsby said.
