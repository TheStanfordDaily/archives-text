# OPINIONS
## THIS COLUMN SENT FROM MY IPHONE GOOOOOOAAAAALLL!!-Oriented Diplomacy 
### Peter McDonald 
Dateline: Minute 70. Uruguay vs.
Netherlands. Thanks to the wonders of
modern cable packages and DVR, I am
in the midst of what USC IR majors might call
"a moment of true global community."
Announcers are calling Wesley Sneijder's
crooked-looking goal in five different lan
guages, and I get to hear all of them. A crucial
score on the highest stage for the world's most
beautiful game. The entire planet, billions of
people, all undergoing the same emotional
roller coaster/bobsled/tuk-tuk ride. This syn
chronicity is beamed to my television; I am one
with the world, courtesy of AT&T. Übuntu,
they call it. It's why they put the World Cup in
South Africa. Flummoxing expectations, the
Portuguese were the most enthusiastic, while
the Japanese showed the most restraint.
All ironic distance aside though, I will admit
that I felt in those moments a tinge of that
fuzzy worldly interconnected feeling übiqui
tous in Cisco commercials and organic food
packaging. After all, how many times a decade
do ABC's and Al-Jazeera's programming
directly overlap? Even so, masses, I beseech
you: Stay your apotheosis of the World Cup for
just a moment. For with only one game left I
come to bury this international football tour

nament, not to praise it. Well, maybe to praise
it a little.
I'll readily admit, I'm a bit of a noob when it
comes to the World Cup: I didn't even know its
frequency until the 2006 edition, but upon the
first taste I could understand why it's causing
people to wake up at 4:30 in the morning to
watch soccer. The World Cup is unique in its
status as a sporting event and as an interna
tional affair. The rules of the World Cup seem
to be the only international accord that every
country can actually agree on, and it's most
definitely the quadrennial jingoistic jousting
match of the future.
For starters, it delivers on all the lofty promis
es of the Olympics, which looks increasingly anti
quated, but still as obsessed with its own great
ness. The World Cup is only about one sport, a
sport whose rules everyone understands, and
simplicity is key in fostering global understand
ing and community. Even more refreshingly, the
World Cup came out of a pure desire to prove
which country was the best at soccer, which is to
say that it's not a product of a bunch of bored,
rich hellenophiles trying to add more gravitas to
their gentlemen's' games. The World Cup is
right at home in Thomas Friedman's newly flat
tened world, while the Olympics feel more as

though they belong in the day of when people
believed the world was actually flat.
For players in the rotation but coming off
the bench, the World Cup carries just a little bit
more jubilation than its five-ringed counter
part. It's really the global version of the World
Series, or the NBA Finals. The Olympics were
always about something else: imperialism, fas
cism, the Cold War, and now, thinly disguised
Yellow Peril, turning the games into a literal
arms race. Meanwhile in the World Cup, the
big bad powers are Brazil and Argentina, coun
tries most famous for Carnaval (or Carnival, in
Argentina's case), gorgeous supermodels and
dictators that break into song, and who have
kept their megalomaniacal tendencies in
check. People view Brazil the same way they
view the Lakers, which allows for a delightful
level of historically driven trash talking. What's
more, I can ask people, "Why are you against
America?" without irony and actually wave
flags without looking like an extremist. There
weren't even as many distressing stories about
South Africa not being ready for the World
Cup in time because they get to spread out the
events around the entire country, instead of
having to treat a city's infrastructure the way
Joey Chestnut treats his digestive tract.

Even so, world, we would all do well to
remember that even though it's a pretty awe
some gaming event, it's still just a game. The
people that benefit most from trumpeting the
World Cup's unifying and transcendent quali
ties through their vuvuzelas are the ones selling
you the World Cup, like Adidas, Nike and
ESPN. An American victory would have done
nothing to fix unemployment, nor the oil leak.
And to all you humanitarian-minded liberals
out there, rooting for Uganda and Ghana did
not help to lift those countries' spirits. For war
torn and poverty-stricken countries, the World
Cup is as much a distraction as it is a cause for
rallying. And though it might be one of the
most well-run transnational organizations on
the planet, FIFA is still a long way off from
having a real effect on the course of geopolitics.
Though considering how much everyone loves
the World Cup, maybe the U.N. ought to
reconsider that position.

E-mail the bets you think the leaders of the
Netherlands and Spain should make (a la Super
Bowl mayors) to petermc@stanford.edu.
