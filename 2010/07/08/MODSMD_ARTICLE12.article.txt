# OH! SWEET NUTHIN'
## Peep Psychology 
### Roseann Cima 
There's an old psych study colloquially
referred to as "the Marshmallow
Experiment." It was originated by
Stanford's Walter Mischel in the sixties and has
since been repeated many times over. In the
test, a four-year-old is seated in a room with a
marshmallow in front of him. He is told he'll be
left alone for fifteen minutes. He can eat the
marshmallow now, but if he waits until the
experimenter comes back, he can have another
marshmallow in addition to this one. The
experimenter leaves, and the child is video
taped battling his will. Adorableness ensues.
Something like 70 percent of kids succeed at
waiting. Almost all the rest struggle and fail,
succumbing to fluffy temptation. The results of
the test are correlated, unscientifically speak
ing, with overall performance in life: SAT
scores, level of education, income and so on.
The patient child has already learned to sup
press his impulse for immediate gratification,
opening up many doors for him later in life.
The impatient child's will, on the other hand, is
like the marshmallow he has such trouble
resisting: soft, yielding, insubstantial. His will
be a life of indulging now and suffering the
consequences later.
Robert Sapolsky, a Stanford neurology pro
fessor, would likely say the predictive power of
the marshmallow marker is a clear demonstra
tion of the biological basis of personality.
Marshmallow-now children are more likely to
fall into substance addiction or lives of crime.
And Sapolsky's all about showing that we pun
ish people for things they're ultimately not
responsible for (example: burning schizo
phrenics at the stake for witchcraft). But the
armchair biologist in me is more interested in

the evolution of the temptation than its under
lying anatomy. Why is it so darn hard (because
even for the successful kids, it is hard: their legs
swinging like little pendula, their eyes fixed
ceiling-ward, counting tiles and fiercely avoid
ing the plate in front of them) to resist that
marshmallow? Once we've decided it's better
to defer our gratification, why are we battling
our bodies at every turn until the matter is out
of our hands? How could twisting ourselves
into these knots ever be adaptive?
The answer I've reached is pretty straight
forward. Before I spell it out, let me attempt a
convoluted illustration of my point: a new vari
ation on the Marshmallow Experiment. A
child is left in the room with the marshmallow
and the same instructions as before. She is left
to hang there for a good ten minutes, tugging at
her braids, fighting her impulses. Then a man
in a gorilla suit bursts through the door, gob
bles up the marshmallow and runs out.
(Caveat: this will likely make many children
cry.)

I don't expect this to yield any valuable pre
dictive measures, and I wouldn't even know
how to start quantifying reactions, beyond
maybe timing the ensuing tantrums. (I do, how
ever, think that this is fertile ground for hilari
ous You Tube videos. The scripted sketch-com
edy version might be even better. The
researcher could return and act very upset that
the marshmallow is gone, then threaten some
silly British penalty as his gorilla-suited min
ions seize the subject to carry him away. Just a
thought.) What this version does do is provide
us with a context in which the marshmallow
now phenotype wins. The body beats the will,
and it turns out better for everyone in the end.

Our bodies are adapted to an uncertain
world, one in which it is much more likely that
food will be snatched from under our noses
than it is that we'll be awarded more for mere
ly waiting to eat it. I think that almost all of the
children believe that the experimenter is pre
pared to uphold his side of the deal. But here
our bodies seem to know what our minds so
often forget: you can't logically predict the
future. There's no guarantee that the first
marshmallow will still be here fifteen minutes
from now, nor that the experimenter will ever
return, nor that the building won't collapse
(and you'd definitely be glad for the extra ener
gy in the immediate aftermath of an earth
quake-induced apocalypse). Your body wants
to force you to take the sure thing now rather
than gamble on induction a hard-coded
impulse to live for the present.
As Stanford students, chances are we were
in the marshmallows-later category. And
Stanford is, in many ways, one big series of
marshmallow experiments. This is why our
bodies rebel when we spend a Friday night cod
ing instead of going out it recognizes that
we're investing in a future that just might not
be. If we're going to win, we can never forget
the reality of that risk, and we should always
know just what it is that we're waiting for.
Some marshmallows are sweeter or surer than
others.
