Dear Editor,
Although I did not receive financial aid to
attend the EPGY summer program as many
of my peers here have, and paid the $4,700 to
attend $4,700 my family saved from not
using an air conditioner or heater for the past
year or buying entertainment devices such as
the Wii or Xbox my peers and I did not
come to Stanford to be called "ungrateful
snots" by Mr. Peter McDonald, editorial
writer for The Stanford Daily ("Stanford
Becomes an Actual Summer Camp," July 1).
Mr. McDonald appeared to have made his
assumption based on the cost of the EPGY
program and a couple of children he encoun
tered while riding his scooter. I fail to see how
the cost of the program and a small sampling
of our summer camp population mean that we
are all "children ... walking around in over
size grown-up clothes."
I have not seen these individuals Mr.
McDonald depicts. Who I have met are a wide
variety of children and young adults partici
pating in programs from sports camps to
EPGY courses that are impossible to over
generalize. While a few may be ungrateful,
many more are not, enough of us not to garner
the title "ungrateful snots." Anyways, though
Mr. McDonald is "somewhat jealous of [us],"
he is in the enviable position. He is already in
Stanford. He has four years at Stanford while
his university will not accept most of us partic
ipating in EPGY. We have three weeks to
have a taste of what he experiences nine
months out of the year. In these three weeks,
many of us are here to improve ourselves, and
such an effort should not be mocked.
