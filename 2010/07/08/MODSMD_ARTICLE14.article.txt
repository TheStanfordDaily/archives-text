## Football: Recruiting the future Building a successful team means finding the right talent 
### JOSEPH BEYDA DAILY INTERN 
Before building the 2010 team at football
camp in August, Stanford's coaches have anoth
er challenge to take care of building the 2011
team. A good part of the offseason is devoted to
recruiting those who will not step into Stanford
Stadium in cardinal and white for more than a
year's time the rising high school seniors who
exemplify what the program is all about.
"We're looking for a young man who does a
great job in the classroom, a person that's an ex
ceptional football player and an elite athlete,"
said assistant coach Tim Drevno.
The demanding task may begin years in ad
vance, as the Stanford staff develops a close re
lationship with high school coaches, requests the

transcripts of potential recruits early on and
counsels them on what they have to do academ
ically to get into Stanford.
Assuming all the scholastic requirements are
met, attracting a recruit to Stanford becomes
easier.

"This is the only school in America where
you can get an Ivy League education and win the
BCS National Championship," Drevno said.
"Stanford really sells itself."
And in recent years, that sales pitch has been
enough to give Stanford some of the top recruit
ing classes in the nation. As of July 6, Stanford
has more commitments from the class of 2011
than any other Pac-10 school; while Stanford has
20 players committed, the University of Wash
ington (with 14) is the only other school in the
conference to have more than 11 commitments,
according to Scouts, Inc.
Not all of the focus is on numbers, however.
"We've really made a big emphasis on trying,
from top to bottom, to have a real quality class
where every recruit we bring in is a legitimate
BCS-level football player," said assistant coach
and recruiting coordinator Lance Anderson.
Drevno attributes Stanford's high number of
recruits to the program's growing reputation as
a football power, which he traces to a number of
factors, including the fame of star players such as
Toby Gerhart and Andrew Luck and wins on
national television against strong opponents
such as Notre Dame. Another critical difference
has been Head Coach Jim Harbaugh's success
ful turnaround of the program: after winning just
one game in 2006, Stanford has improved its

record for three consecutive years, playing in its
first bowl game since 2001 last season.
Some of the program's most striking recruit
ing successes have come from the East Coast.
Recently-committed Devon Cajuste is one of
only a handful of Stanford recruits from New
York City in the last few decades. Anderson
claims that the strong contingent of East Coast
recruits is partly a result of chance.
"It just seems like every year it's a little bit dif
ferent in terms of where we find those guys who
are a good fit both academically and athletical
ly," he said.
According to Drevno, nationwide recruiting
at Stanford has always been necessary.
"You have to scout all 50 states at Stanford
because there's such an academic standard for
student athletes here," he said.
The coaches have a standard of their own to
meet a moral one. A host of NCAA regula
tions dictate what coaches can and cannot do
during the recruiting process, often to ensure
that student-athletes don't receive special re
wards or payments.
The consequences of wrongdoing can be dra
matic. Recently, an NCAA investigation re
vealed that USC had committed recruiting vio-

lations and given improper benefits to
Heisman Trophy winner Reggie Bush
and basketball star O.J. Mayo. USC
was penalized with the forfeiture of
monetary winnings, postseason bans
of one and two years for basketball
and football, respectively, and schol
arship reductions, among other sanc
tions.
Though Stanford hasn't had seri
ous problems of its own with recruit
ing violations, the punishment hand
ed down to USC serves as a stern re
minder of the impact that recruiting
violations can have.
"It's so detrimental to your foot
ball team. It can really hurt your pro
gram for years to come," Drevno said.
"We've all got to lay our head
down on the pillow every night know
ing we've done the right thing for this
institution, for this football program,
and for our team," he added.
And according to Anderson, doing
so comes as second-nature.
"What [the university] stands for
academic integrity and the honor
code carries over into the athletic
program," he said. "And the football
program as well."
