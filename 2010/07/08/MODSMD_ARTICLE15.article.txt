# New World (Cup) Order in 2010
## 
### TOM TAYLOR 
In its 80 years the World Cup has only ever
been won by a handful of countries in Eu
rope and South America, and only four
tournaments have been hosted outside
those two continents.
So with just two countries now remaining in
the first World Cup to ever be held in Africa, it's
time to ask if anything has changed.
No European team has ever won a World Cup
played outside of Europe, and until the quarterfi
nals nothing really suggested this might change.
Both the reigning world champions (Italy) and
last tournament's runners-up (France) had al
ready crashed out in the group stage, coming
dead last in their respective pools. Just three of
the original 13 European teams remained, in
comparison to four of the five South American
nations.
But then the tournament suddenly came to
life, and after four quarterfinal games that quick
ly made up for a lack of action in earlier stages
both Brazil and Argentina were gone. On Tues
day it became official, when Holland defeated
Uruguay: the two finalists would be European.
The second semifinal yesterday, when Spain
knocked out Germany, ensured a new country
would win the World Cup for the first time in
twelve years.
The quarterfinals also broke the hearts of a
billion Africans, and elevated
Uruguayan striker Luis Suarez to
super-villain status. With all the
other African teams failing to go be
yond the group stage, the prayers for
an African miracle were invested
solely in Ghana. Tied at the end of
extra time, the game was heading to
penalties when Stephen Appiah
headed the ball toward the goal.
Had it gone in, Ghana would have
become the first ever African team to
reach the semifinals of the World
Cup, but Suarez blatantly handed the
ball on the line to deny the goal.
Though he was sent off and Ghana
was given a spot-kick to rightfully
win, Asamoah Gyan hit the crossbar,
and in the penalty shoot-out that fol
lowed Uruguay prevailed. Suarez
may have become a hero to 3.4 mil
lion of his countrymen, but he
robbed the hopes and dreams of an
entire continent.
On the face of it, this was a World
Cup of big upsets. Not only did so
many major European teams strug

gle, but the biggest stars of the foot
ball world also came up short.
The three players who have been
FIFA World Player of the Year in
the last three seasons Argentina's
Lionel Messi, Portugal's Christiano
Ronaldo and Brazil's Kaka
scored just one goal between them
and failed to set the tournament on
fire. Germany, by comparison, with a
team of lesser-known young players,
has broken the traditional mould of
German football and was clearly the
most exciting and explosive team in
South Africa.
Apart from Suarez's handball, the
other big negative story from the
World Cup centered on a couple of
shockingly bad refereeing decisions.
Disallowed goals by England and the
USA, Kaka being sent off for noth
ing, an off-side goal by Argentina
and several other incidents will in
crease the clamor for bringing tech
nology into the game. It seems im
possible that FIFA won't listen, but
many commentators suspect we will
still be having this argument in four
years' time.
Whatever the history books will
write about this tournament, at the
very least TV audiences across the
globe have learnt two Zulu words:

Jabulani and Vuvuzela.
The former, meaning "rejoice,"
apparently the roundest ball ever
created, has frustrated both goal
keepers and strikers and been
blamed for a lack of goals. Retailing
at around $l5O, it also highlights the
chasm between the prosperous and
the poor. The World Cup may be
being held in their continent, but it is
unlikely that most of the children of
Africa will ever be able to play with
"their" ball.
The latter is completely the oppo
site. The sound of cheap plastic horns
made and sold for pennies have
echoed the sounds of Africa around
the world. Commentators, viewers
and players have complained about
the drone that drowns out both fans
chanting and communication on the
pitch, but this is to miss the point.
Everything about this World Cup
was planned with ruthless precision
by FIFA and its partners. To satisfy
the demands of sponsors, local busi
nesses have been denied the chance
to make an honest living from the in
flux of tourists to their country, and
it's unclear how much of the money
earned will really stay in the conti
nent. Through all of this, though, no
one fully anticipated and no one

can seemingly silence the sound
of the vuvuzela.
Germany and Uruguay now have
to play perhaps the least desirable
game in football, the third place play
off on Saturday, when they would
probably rather already be on their
way home. The final on Sunday,
however, should be an intriguing
matchup. Spain and Holland have

both carried the heavy tag of being
known as the best countries never to
have won the World Cup for a long
time. One of them will now walk
away champion, the other will shoul
der the burden alone.

Despite America being eliminated several weeks ago, interest in the World Cup
remains high. Above, visiting students gather at Mirlo Lounge in Florence
Moore Hall to catch yesterday's game between Germany and Spain.
