# Catching up with Landry Fields
## 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
After carrying Cardinal basketball on his
back for the 2009-10 season, Landry Fields
was rewarded on draft night, when he was se
lected by the New York Knicks in the second
round. The Daily caught up with the recent
Stanford graduate to talk about his prepara-

tion for the next level, applicable skill set and
what the future holds. What follows is an
edited transcript of the interview.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): Can you de
scribe the mood on draft night? Had you had
interest from the Knicks before? Was this
something you had expected?
Landry Fields (LF): It wasn't really ex
pected. It was a place that I knew I could be
drafted at. I had spoken with my agent, and I
knew that they had liked me, but nothing
was official until then. It was a pleasure to
hear my name called. It was definitely excit
ing. The mood was great afterward. The
family was all screaming and stuff it was a
good feeling.
TSD: Going into draft night, were you ex
pecting to hear your name called, or were
you bracing for the possibility of going un
drafted?
LF: It was kind of neutral. I didn't really
know what to expect out of it. Of course, I
wanted to remain confident, since I did have
a chance to get drafted. But at the same time,
realistically, it might not have happened, so I
tried to maintain a neutral mindset going in.
TSD: Can you talk a little bit about your
preparation before the draft? What was your
routine?

LF: A lot of workouts. There was early
morning lifting four days a week, then after
ward, some further training, then I'd head to
lunch, come back and shoot around in the af
ternoon. That was all before the NBA work
outs started. Once the NBA workouts start-

Ed, you tried to get it in whenever you were
home. I actually had to go to 15 different
team workouts, so it was really busy
throughout May and June. That was all lead
ing up to the draft. You want to do as well as
possible in those workouts, and I think be
cause of them, I got drafted.
TSD: Where do you see yourself fitting in
with the Knicks? Mike D'Antoni is known
for that fast-paced offense. Is that something
that you could see yourself fitting in well
with?
LF: Definitely. With that kind of offense,
given the player I am, with my versatility and
all-around game, I think I could fit in real
well.
TSD: Not a whole lot of people on the na
tional stage, and certainly not locally in New
York, seem to really know that much about
your game. How would you scout yourself?
Where do you think that you're already set
for the pro game, and where do you think
you need to improve in order to make an im
mediate contribution?
LF: Going into the workouts, my focus
was on my jumper. I wanted to knock down
a consistent shot. In terms of scouting my
self, I'd say that I play with a high basketball
IQ, and I'm very versatile. I have a good feel
for the game. I'm not one-dimensional.
There's a lot of things that I can do out there.
TSD: So the jumper has been the focus?
Have you seen steady improvement in the
off-season workouts and during your work
outs for teams?
LF: Yeah, there was a big improvement
when I was working out for teams. I shot the

ball really well everywhere that I went. It was
one of the things that kept me going through
out these workouts. I came out of a lot of
workouts and people were calling me a shoot
er. Once that happened, I knew that the hard
work I had put into my jumper had been pay
ing off.
TSD: Going along with this theme: you're
a bit of an unknown commodity. Do you like
that idea, that you essentially have a blank
slate on which you can write?
LF: Yeah, definitely. It helps going in and
being able to show people what you can do.
But on the flip side, it is nice to have that con
fidence, and to have some people back you
based on what you've done already. It is a bit
less pressure going in. I can just go in and
show people what I can do, as opposed to

going in and having all these high expecta
tions of myself and [from] people of me.
TSD: How do you feel that college pre
pared you for the pro game? Particularly last
season, when you were Stanford's focal
point. Were there areas in particular that
prepared you for what you're about to expe
rience?
LF: Being the focal point of the team, each
team we faced would come in trying to shut
me down. Me being able to put up the num
bers that I did, even with that defense night in
and night out, definitely prepared me well for
this whole draft process and now for where
I'm going. In the NBA you can't just settle on
one particular thing. Well, some guys can, but
most can't. You can't settle on one aspect of
your game. So this year, when people were
taking away one thing, then I'd go to the next,
then the next, then the next, and that pre
pared me really well.
TSD: Have you spoken to any other Stan
ford guys in the league? You were in the same
recruiting class as Brook and Robin Lopez,

and Brook is just across the Hudson River
with the New Jersey Nets. Have you spoken
with those guys?
LF: A little bit, but it was mainly for con
gratulations. When I was in New York I was
trying to hook up with Brook, but I was work
ing out so much and had a busy schedule out
there. Before the draft, when I was working
out in Phoenix, I knew Robin was out there,
pushing hard for me with the coaches, which
was nice. I still keep in contact with those
guys, and I can always turn to them if I have
any questions about the next level.
TSD: Five years from now, where do you
think you are? Are you starting in the NBA?
Solid rotational guy? Still in the league?
LF: (laughter) Well, in five years, hopeful
ly I'm still there. However it works for me, I
just see myself being someone involved in the
rotation, but right now, it's all about being
there.
