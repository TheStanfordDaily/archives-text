# Card players boost USA on world stage
## 
### KEVIN ZHANG DAILY INTERN 
Although school is out and the spring colle
giate season has ended, the competition hasn't
stopped for some Stanford athletes and alumni.
During the 12th ISF Women's World Softball
Championships in Caracas, Venezuela, running
from June 23 to July 3, Stanford University was
well represented. Four Cardinal athletes in
cluding current star Ashley Hansen and former
standouts Alissa Haber, Jessica Mendoza and
Lauren Lappin helped the United States
team win the world championship, marking the
seventh consecutive title for the Americans.
Another prominent former Cardinal playing
in the tournament was recent graduate and top
tier pitcher Missy Penna, who lent her efforts to
the Dominican Republic.
Cardinal players made major contributions
to the U.S. national team, including in the cham
pionship game against Japan. Hansen recorded
the first United States hit in the game with a dou
ble and Haber drove in the team's first run, Men
doza, with a single. After Haber's RBI, the Red,
White and Blue strung together six more hits in
the fourth inning to take a commanding 5-0 lead,
with former Cardinal Lappin scoring the final
run of the inning.
The United States went on to win the world
championship, 7-0.
With Stanford's latest and greatest lending a
hand, the United States team dominated the
tournament, going undefeated in ten games and
outscoring their opponents 95-6. A recent grad
uate, Haber had a historic tournament, breaking
teammate Jessica Mendoza's record of 16 RBI
in the 2006 World Championships tournament
by knocking in 21 runs of her own.
"I take pride in my pre-game batting practice.
I get the opportunity to hit every type of pitch
that helps me get ready to face all types of pitch
ers. My mindset is to no matter what make con
tact," Haber told GoStanford.com. "I try to
scout the pitchers and weaknesses then put a
plan together that meshes their strengths and
weaknesses and my own. Then of course I al
ways try to relax and have fun!"
The United States opened the tournament
with two victories, defeating China 1-0 and New
Zealand 12-2. The Cardinal came up big as
Hansen scored the only run of the game against
the Chinese. In the same game, Lappin, a catch

er, made a great defensive play, catching a Chi
nese player stuck between second and third
base. In the second game, recent graduate and
outfielder Haber went two-for-three with a dou
ble, two runs and two RBI.
Contributions from the Cardinal continued
as Lappin went three-for-three in the fourth
game against Botswana, recording three RBI
and two runs in the third inning alone as the
United States team cruised to a 20-0 victory.
In a crucial game against Australia, the Unit
ed States' most storied opponent, Haber helped
the United States capture a 9-2 victory by lead
ing the team on the day, going three-for-three
with four RBI and one run.
"I was seeing the ball really well so I was very
relaxed at the plate," Haber said, again speaking
to GoStanford.com. "I thought I would be more
nervous playing but I really wasn't. I think it has
to do with the amount of talent on our team."
"There are great hitters in front of you and
great hitters behind you," she added. "It's nice
knowing that if you can't come through, some
one else will. We all have each other's backs and
that really helps with my confidence at the
plate."
In the second-to-last game before the medal
rounds, the United States defeated the Domini
can Republic 10-1, where they faced former
Stanford pitcher Penna. Haber continued her
hot streak, going 2-3.
In the last game of the medal round, the Unit
ed States continued to play fantastic Softball, eas
ily defeating the Czech Republic, 9-0. After that
game the last before the medal rounds
Haber led the team in batting average (.750), hits
(12), doubles (6) and RBI (16, tying Mendoza's
tournament record).
The United States cruised against Canada in
the first game of the medal round, winning 16-1
before beating Japan twice (once in the semi
final and then again in the final) to win the cham
pionship.
Haber and Hansen provided a big one-two
punch in the batting lineup for the Cardinal dur
ing the 2010 season and were also ranked one
and two in batting average on the team, respec
tively. Haber finished the season at .446 and
Hansen at .337. This appearance doesn't mark
the first time they have appeared with the na
tional team, as both Haber and Hansen became
members of the U.S. squad in 2009.
Mendoza graduated from Stanford in 2002

(in 2003 Mendoza graduated with a master's de
gree) and was a four-time NFCA First-team All
American and a four-time member of both the
Pac-10 and All-Pacific Region First-teams. She
was a three-time Stanford athlete of the year as
well. Mendoza is a veteran on the international
scene, first competing for the USA in 2001.
Lappin played at Stanford from 2003 to 2006
and began competing internationally in 2003,
leading the USA Softball Elite team and twice
being named the Pac-10 Defensive Player of the
Year. Lappin has been a defensive cornerstone
as a third baseman and catcher and also demon
strated her prowess with the bat, hitting .556 at
the 2009 World Cup.
These four Stanford athletes will be back in

action soon, as the United States National team
will compete in the KFC's World Cup of Softball
at Hall of Fame Stadium in Oklahoma City from
July 22-26.

teammate Jessica Mendoza's record of 16 RBI
in the 2006 World Championships tournament
by knocking in 21 runs of her own.
"I take pride in my pre-game batting practice.
I get the opportunity to hit every type of pitch
that helps me get ready to face all types of pitch
ers. My mindset is to no matter what make con
tact," Haber told GoStanford.com. "I try to
scout the pitchers and weaknesses then put a
plan together that meshes their strengths and
weaknesses and my own. Then of course I al
ways try to relax and have fun!"
The United States opened the tournament
with two victories, defeating China 1-0 and New
Zealand 12-2. The Cardinal came up big as
Hansen scored the only run of the game against
the Chinese. In the same game, Lappin, a catch

er, made a great defensive play, catching a Chi
nese player stuck between second and third
base. In the second game, recent graduate and
outfielder Haber went two-for-three with a dou
ble, two runs and two RBI.
Contributions from the Cardinal continued
as Lappin went three-for-three in the fourth
game against Botswana, recording three RBI
and two runs in the third inning alone as the
United States team cruised to a 20-0 victory.
In a crucial game against Australia, the Unit
ed States' most storied opponent, Haber helped
the United States capture a 9-2 victory by lead
ing the team on the day, going three-for-three
with four RBI and one run.
"I was seeing the ball really well so I was very
relaxed at the plate," Haber said, again speaking
to GoStanford.com. "I thought I would be more
nervous playing but I really wasn't. I think it has
to do with the amount of talent on our team."
"There are great hitters in front of you and
great hitters behind you," she added. "It's nice
knowing that if you can't come through, some
one else will. We all have each other's backs and
that really helps with my confidence at the
plate."
In the second-to-last game before the medal
rounds, the United States defeated the Domini
can Republic 10-1, where they faced former
Stanford pitcher Penna. Haber continued her
hot streak, going 2-3.
In the last game of the medal round, the Unit
ed States continued to play fantastic Softball, eas
ily defeating the Czech Republic, 9-0. After that
game the last before the medal rounds
Haber led the team in batting average (.750), hits
(12), doubles (6) and RBI (16, tying Mendoza's
tournament record).
The United States cruised against Canada in
the first game of the medal round, winning 16-1
before beating Japan twice (once in the semi
final and then again in the final) to win the cham
pionship.
Haber and Hansen provided a big one-two
punch in the batting lineup for the Cardinal dur
ing the 2010 season and were also ranked one
and two in batting average on the team, respec
tively. Haber finished the season at .446 and
Hansen at .337. This appearance doesn't mark
the first time they have appeared with the na
tional team, as both Haber and Hansen became
members of the U.S. squad in 2009.
Mendoza graduated from Stanford in 2002

(in 2003 Mendoza graduated with a master's de
gree) and was a four-time NFCA First-team All
American and a four-time member of both the
Pac-10 and All-Pacific Region First-teams. She
was a three-time Stanford athlete of the year as
well. Mendoza is a veteran on the international
scene, first competing for the USA in 2001.
Lappin played at Stanford from 2003 to 2006
and began competing internationally in 2003,
leading the USA Softball Elite team and twice
being named the Pac-10 Defensive Player of the
Year. Lappin has been a defensive cornerstone
as a third baseman and catcher and also demon
strated her prowess with the bat, hitting .556 at
the 2009 World Cup.
These four Stanford athletes will be back in

action soon, as the United States National team
will compete in the KFC's World Cup of Softball
at Hall of Fame Stadium in Oklahoma City from
July 22-26.
