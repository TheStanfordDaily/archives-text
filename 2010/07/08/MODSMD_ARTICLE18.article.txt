# Time for us to rethink sports safety

### KEVIN ZHANG 
As Americans, we love toughness. We
love it when football players tackle
each other, colliding with over 1500
lbs of force. We love it when a hock
ey player knocks teeth out of anoth
er hockey player. We love it when we can idolize
performances of toughness such as Kirk Gibson
hitting a crucial home run on two bad legs or Curt
Schilling pitching with a bloody sock. Most impor
tantly, as athletes, we love being admired for our
toughness.
This universal idea of toughness has been so in
doctrinated into the minds of young athletes that it
has begun to jeopardize the long-term well-being
of young athletes. Long-term health issues have
arisen with athletes in high-contact sports, which
value aggressiveness and overall toughness. The
causes of these issues have not been pinpointed,
but there have been strong correlations between
long-term health problems and concussions.
Most recently, the autopsy results of Chris
Henry showed chronic traumatic encephalopathy
(C.T.E), more commonly known as dementia
pugilistica. Henry died in December 2009 after hit
ting his head after falling out of the back of a pick
up truck. C.T.E. is an insidious condition: it can
only be discovered by an autopsy, and players can
have this condition without even knowing it. This
is particularly alarming because Henry had previ
ously suffered several concussions during his foot
ball career and this brain injury may have aug
mented the effects of his accident in December,
making fatal what would otherwise have been a
survivable concussion.
Although there is not much information avail
able on C.T.E, the possibility of a correlation be
tween C.T.E. and major long-term behavioral or
health issues is definitely likely, according to sev
eral experts. In fact, Henry had a plethora of off
the-field issues for a while in his career, including
five arrests in 28 months.
Furthermore, former NFL players have report
ed memory loss, depression and mood swings.
Andre Waters, a former NFL player, committed
suicide at age 44 and autopsies showed signs of se
vere damage to his brain.
Although the evidence is inconclusive as it is
difficult to account for the external factors, in a
study of 2,500 former NFL players done several
years ago by the Center for the Study of Retired
Athletes, there was a direct correlation between
Alzheimer's-like symptoms and the number of
concussions a player suffered.
With these sources and suggestions considered,
the question now is, how do we balance toughness
and safety in order to prevent these terrible health
issues? Although this question has not been clear
ly answered and there are many abstract findings,
several policies need to be implemented.
Firstly, the idea that it is "cool" to not wear hel
mets needs to be abandoned. There are way too
many adolescents and teenagers who think that
riding a skateboard or a bike without a helmet is
badass. The World Health Organization pro
claimed that wearing a helmet is the single most ef
fective way of reducing head injuries and fatalities,
decreasing the likelihood of death by almost 40
percent.
Secondly, social norms in youth sports need
some reform. Far too often young athletes are
overextending themselves and risking their future
wellbeing, especially with concussions which
can be easily fixed in the short-term with a few as
pirin, but have been linked to severe effects in the
long term. Coaches of all sports need to encourage
athletes to take it easy when they have concussion
