## Campus jazzes up Annual festival emphasizes music education and appreciation 
### EMILY ZHENG DAILY INTERN 
As Stanford Jazz Festival founder
Jim Nadel strutted onto the stage
on Saturday morning, Dinkelspiel
Auditorium fell silent or as
silent as a room of rowdy children
can be.
"Is everyone here?" he asked playfully as
the bass and drums rhythmically hummed in
the background. "Raise your hand ... if
you're not here!" The mostly five-year-old
crowd laughed, and Nadel, the artistic and ex
ecutive director of the Festival, began the
Early Bird Jazz for Kids program, introducing
the different instruments and jazz styles to the
young audience.
The music education event was just one of
many that make up the annual Stanford Jazz
Festival, put on by the nonprofit Stanford Jazz
Workshop. Kicking off its 39th season on June
25 with Grammy Award-winning vocalist Lu
ciana Souza, this year's Festival follows with
six weeks of events featuring world-class jazz
musicians. In total, 100 artists will perform at
32 events over the summer.
"Every year is better than before," said
Nadel, a lecturer in the music department.
"There's always a new and exciting combina
tion of faculty and musicians. It makes the
event very unique."
'Excitement in the building'
The campus festival is unique in its empha
sis on jazz education and appreciation, as well
as performance. The Workshop hosts summer
jazz camps where musicians teach participat
ing students workshop-style by day, then gath
er to perform by night.

"We take really great care of the musicians
that come to Stanford," Nadel said. "There's
that excitement in the building; the students
are thrilled to learn from them. So after a week
of being in this atmosphere at beautiful Stan
ford with a great community, we often get
peak performances from these musicians."
Some of the resident musicians, such as
New York City saxophonist Patrick Wolff, ac
tually attended the Workshop as teenagers.
"I grew up where there weren't a whole lot
of opportunities to see or play jazz," Wolff
said. "So when I came to the Jazz Workshop in
1993, it was the first time in my life I was able
to be surrounded by so many jazz musicians. It
basically got the ball rolling for me and got me
excited about jazz."
Wolff, in addition to helping with adminis
tration, will be teaching mainly woodwind
classes, master classes, private lessons and
coaching small ensembles at the Workshop.
He has taught there for 10 years.
"The growing number of resources and
books out there, in away, is almost distracting
people away from the way jazz was originally
taught, which was through oral tradition,"
Wolff said. "There aren't that many places
that have this focus anymore. But for us, tradi
tional jazz education is essentially at the heart
of our educational model."
The one-week summer jazz camp is de
signed for participants ages 12-17, and accom
modates students at any level of playing abili
ty. Additional programs include the Jazz Res
idency, designed for adult musicians of all lev
els, and the Evening Summer Program, for
musicians ages 12 and up.
"Regardless of what level you're at, when
you enter the Workshop, the focus is using
your ears," Wolff said. "It makes the most

sense if you're talking about jazz as being the
musical language that it is."
Continuing in its emphasis on jazz educa
tion, the Festival has dedicated key events to
young children, including two "Early Bird Jazz
for Kids" events.
"I think the study of music teaches kids, and
adults, some life skills," Nadel said. "It shows
the value of perseverance, it shows that results
come from dedicated practices, it teaches
them about teamwork, supporting others, lis
tening, patience and how to communicate with
others."
Jazz evolution
Behind the activity is a team of musically
talented staff, who join to make the programs
the enduring events they have become.
The summer he graduated from Stanford in

1972, Nadel started the Workshop, which at
the time was a small, student-based organiza
tion. Its activities consisted of jam sessions at
the old CoHo on Monday nights and Tuesday
night discussion groups.
"The jam sessions had already been going
on for some time, so the main difference, what
truly made it the Stanford Jazz Workshop,
were the discussion groups that we had,"
Nadel said. "We got people who had heard us
on Monday night jam sessions to join us the
next day if they were interested in learning
more about the music that we played, and
that's how it all grew."
In 1982, American jazz saxophonist Stan
Getz got involved with the Workshop, a news-

Playing on his birthday, Dr. Lonnie Smith and accompanying guitar player Jonathan Kreisberg
expressed their passion for jazz music to a packed Dinkelspiel Auditorium. Saturday's event was
one of 32 performances scheduled over the summer for the 39th annual Stanford Jazz Festival.
