## ADMINISTRATION Elam outlines goals as new VPUE Emphasizes 'developing an overall vision' for undergraduate education 
### ERIC MESSINGER SUMMER MANAGING EDITOR 
After months spent assessing Stanford's
teaching efforts in preparation for a reform of its
undergraduate requirements, Vice Provost for
Undergraduate Education (VPUE) Harry
Elam Jr. will now be in a position to implement
them from his new office in a year's time.
Elam, also a drama professor, took over as
VPUE on July 1. Earlier in the year, he began
chairing the Study for Undergraduate Educa
tion (SUES) with history Prof. James Campbell
Ph.D. 'B9. SUES will evaluate non-major re
quirements for undergraduates, including
GERs and programs like the Program in Writ
ing and Rhetoric (PWR) and Introduction to
the Humanities (IHUM). Elam had previously
served for years in campus administration.
Elam said that his new office will now be his
top priority, and that he will be discussing with
the Provost whether he will continue to co-chair
SUES.
"It may be best for me to step back from that
and think about ways that I can inform the
process going forward," Elam said, emphasizing
the implementation of the recommendations
SUES will deliver in 2011.
"The role that becomes more important...
is developing an overall vision for undergradu
ate education that SUES is a part of," he added.
Elam takes office after an 11-year tenure in
the position by Bucknell University President
John Bravman '79 M.S. 'Bl Ph.D. 'B5. In keeping
with a big-picture focus that he has adopted in
discussions of SUES, Elam described the posi
tion as an opportunity to make an impact at "a
really interesting time for undergraduate educa
tion at Stanford."
"It's a chance, because it's been under John's
leadership for 11 years, really to take us in some
new directions, not to foreclose all the things
that have happened before, to appreciate that,
but to think about where else we can go," Elam
said.
One challenge that he cited for his office, and
for SUES' ongoing work, is the project of edu
cating "global citizens" in a changing world.
Closer to home, change and upheaval has also
had an impact on undergraduate education: no
University department saw more turmoil or re
structuring in the wake of Stanford's two-year
budget crisis than the VPUE, which shuffled
many units and eliminated staff members in
order to implement budget cuts.
Elam takes over now, as the office is enjoying
a period of relative calm. The brief lull will last
until Fall 2011, when SUES expects to deliver its
recommendations to the Faculty Senate. Ac
cording to the University's 2010-11 Budget
Plan, signed by the Provost and written prior to
Elam assuming his position, the VPUE is com
mitted to making no significant cuts or restruc
turings, in anticipation of SUES' recommenda
tions necessitating further changes.
" VPUE's strong reserve position negates the
need for dramatic reductions to the non-man
dated programs that so enhance the undergrad
uate educational experience," the plan reads.
"Furthermore, the recommendations from
SUES are reasonably expected to substantially
affect VPUE programs. These factors lead

professor, he also moderated the Three Books disci
VPUE to conclude that changes to undergradu
ate programming are currently unwarranted."
Among the VPUE's most prominent units is
the Bing Overseas Studies Program, which has
completed a period of opening new campuses in
the 2000s while also facing a growing set of fi
nancial pressures in the world economy, leading
to the suspension of overseas seminars. In look
ing at the program, Elam said the VPUE's prior
ities were clear.
"The goal will be: how do we get more stu
dents abroad," Elam said.
"If we're saying that this is really something
that is special at Stanford and something that we
want students to do, then we need to make it ac
cessible," pointing specifically to finding ways to
allow for athletes or engineers to attend over
seas campuses.

vided some hints about what the study and its
participants had learned after months of cam
pus discussions, saying, for one, that he did not
envision Stanford adopting an overly prescribed
set of undergraduate requirements.
"Stanford can never be a place where one
size fits all," Elam said. "By that I mean, yeah,
there are going to be requirements across the
board, but one of the things that makes Stanford
so unique is the incredible students that we
have, that may be driven in one way."
Elam also said that in evaluating the fresh
man-year IHUM and PWR programs, he and
his colleagues had found the justification for
and the understanding of the latter program no
ticeably more present after many discussions
with students.

"What we've understood from all
that, is that, whatever we were going
to require, the rationale for that re
quirement has got to be really clear,
both from the faculty point and the
students," he said.
"The students who spoke back
to us about IHUM were not articu
lating clearly what the rationale
was. That was eye-opening," he
added, noting that students need to
be able to answer, "I know why I'm
taking this, I know where this is
going to take me" when engaging
with required course work.
Elam also repeatedly empha
sized research as an avenue that
had opportunities for enriching stu
dents' education at Stanford, citing
it as an ongoing priority and
challenge for his office.
"At an institution like Stanford
that is a research institution, that
credits itself on being the, and cer
tainly is, the best place where re
search is done potentially in the

world how do we also make it
the best place for undergraduate
education, and see those things as
mutually informative, and not in
any way antithetical? That those
practices, and how they come to
gether, is one of the things that
makes Stanford unique and spe
cial?" Elam asked.
He also noted that he saw the
missions of research and teaching at
Stanford as in line with his concep
tion of the University's responsibil
ities to its students.
"If the mission of Stanford and
the VPUE, more specifically, is to
build students as global citizens for
the new millennium, the fact is that
students have changed, in terms of
what technical skills, knowledge,
what they come to school with, their
abilities that they have how they
learn has changed."
"One of the challenges is," he
continued, "how do we think differ
ently about education to impact
where students are coming from,
and make Stanford a little more ef
fective in doing that?"

After months spent assessing Stanford's
teaching efforts in preparation for a reform of its
undergraduate requirements, Vice Provost for
Undergraduate Education (VPUE) Harry
Elam Jr. will now be in a position to implement
them from his new office in a year's time.
Elam, also a drama professor, took over as
VPUE on July 1. Earlier in the year, he began
chairing the Study for Undergraduate Educa
tion (SUES) with history Prof. James Campbell
Ph.D. 'B9. SUES will evaluate non-major re
quirements for undergraduates, including
GERs and programs like the Program in Writ
ing and Rhetoric (PWR) and Introduction to
the Humanities (IHUM). Elam had previously
served for years in campus administration.
Elam said that his new office will now be his
top priority, and that he will be discussing with
the Provost whether he will continue to co-chair
SUES.
"It may be best for me to step back from that
and think about ways that I can inform the
process going forward," Elam said, emphasizing
the implementation of the recommendations
SUES will deliver in 2011.
"The role that becomes more important...
is developing an overall vision for undergradu
ate education that SUES is a part of," he added.
Elam takes office after an 11-year tenure in
the position by Bucknell University President
John Bravman '79 M.S. 'Bl Ph.D. 'B5. In keeping
with a big-picture focus that he has adopted in
discussions of SUES, Elam described the posi
tion as an opportunity to make an impact at "a
really interesting time for undergraduate educa
tion at Stanford."
"It's a chance, because it's been under John's
leadership for 11 years, really to take us in some
new directions, not to foreclose all the things
that have happened before, to appreciate that,
but to think about where else we can go," Elam
said.
One challenge that he cited for his office, and
for SUES' ongoing work, is the project of edu
cating "global citizens" in a changing world.
Closer to home, change and upheaval has also
had an impact on undergraduate education: no
University department saw more turmoil or re
structuring in the wake of Stanford's two-year
budget crisis than the VPUE, which shuffled
many units and eliminated staff members in
order to implement budget cuts.
Elam takes over now, as the office is enjoying
a period of relative calm. The brief lull will last
until Fall 2011, when SUES expects to deliver its
recommendations to the Faculty Senate. Ac
cording to the University's 2010-11 Budget
Plan, signed by the Provost and written prior to
Elam assuming his position, the VPUE is com
mitted to making no significant cuts or restruc
turings, in anticipation of SUES' recommenda
tions necessitating further changes.
" VPUE's strong reserve position negates the
need for dramatic reductions to the non-man
dated programs that so enhance the undergrad
uate educational experience," the plan reads.
"Furthermore, the recommendations from
SUES are reasonably expected to substantially
affect VPUE programs. These factors lead

professor, he also moderated the Three Books disci
VPUE to conclude that changes to undergradu
ate programming are currently unwarranted."
Among the VPUE's most prominent units is
the Bing Overseas Studies Program, which has
completed a period of opening new campuses in
the 2000s while also facing a growing set of fi
nancial pressures in the world economy, leading
to the suspension of overseas seminars. In look
ing at the program, Elam said the VPUE's prior
ities were clear.
"The goal will be: how do we get more stu
dents abroad," Elam said.
"If we're saying that this is really something
that is special at Stanford and something that we
want students to do, then we need to make it ac
cessible," pointing specifically to finding ways to
allow for athletes or engineers to attend over
seas campuses.

participants had learned after months of cam
