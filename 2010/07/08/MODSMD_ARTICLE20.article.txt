# Janitor's tale gains Hollywood notice
## 'Dreams Awake' documentary wins Student Academy Award 
### DANIEL BUI STAFF WRITER 
While Stanford University is
recognized as home to some
of the brightest minds in the
world, some of the school's
most inspiring intellectual
gems can often remain tragically unseen. In
some cases, they might even be hidden just be
hind a paper towel and a half-filled bottle of
multi-purpose cleaner.
Doroteo Garcia is a janitor at the Cantor
Arts Center at Stanford. To first-year M.F.A.
students Kevin Gordon and Rebekah Mered
ith, however, Garcia is far more than his occu
pation; he is a poet, a historian and an activist.
And also the focus of their critically acclaimed
documentary, "Dreams Awake," which earned
Gordon and Meredith a bronze medal in the
2010 Student Academy Awards last month.
"[Garcia is] a very humble person," Mered

ith said. "He's very involved in the community.
He's had us over to his house several times for
dinner or just to have some coffee."
Throughout winter quarter, Gordon and
Meredith filmed and edited the documentary,
following the janitor through his workday and
after hours in an attempt to showcase his voice
and poetry.
"At heart, it's a film about really seeing peo
ple who are often unnoticed ... and have sto
ries that are yet to be heard," Meredith said.
Dreams Awaken
The project first emerged out of Film Prod
402, a winter quarter course for M.F.A. docu
mentary students where those enrolled pair up
to produce films.
"In this case, Kevin and Rebekah co-direct
ed and shared the shooting, sound recording
and editing," said art and art history Professor

Jan Krawitz, instructor of the course and also
the director of the M.F.A. program in docu
mentary film.
Aside from a length requirement, students
were allowed to choose whatever topic inter
ested them upon approval by course faculty.
Gordon and Meredith's initial research in
volved hours of sifting through articles, bounc
ing topics off of one another and making lists of
potential ideas.
"We both had an idea of doing an observa
tional film," Gordon said. "We spent several
weeks shopping different ideas, and a friend
forwarded us an article about Doroteo in The
New York Times. We were captivated by his
poetry, as well as the space of the art museum."
Because the article was printed in 2005,
both were thrilled to discover that Garcia still
worked at Cantor. When they presented their

idea for a documentary, the janitor's initial
skepticism soon grew into enthusiasm.
"We had to communicate our vision of what
we wanted to do with the film, and he was ex
cited that his poetry would be in the film and
get some exposure," Meredith recalled.
"He was totally game for a movie," Gordon
added.
The filmmakers spent the next few weeks
storyboarding their idea before recording the
seven-minute documentary in four shoots last
ing a few hours each.
"Dreams Awaken" ultimately paints a re
flective, emotional portrait of Garcia by focus
ing on controlled, stylized scenes of the janitor
working at the Cantor Arts Center, leading a
union activist meeting for Hispanic workers.
and learning English with Habla el
Dia at Stanford's El Centro Chicano.
Gordon and Meredith enlivened
each scene with voiceovers from Gar
cia himself, using segments from an
interview and stanzas read from his
original poetry.
"Rebekah and Kevin had to figure
out away to represent Doro's poetry,
and they decided to allow his words
to complement the scenes from his
life that play out in the film," Krawitz
said. "The voice of his poetry ampli
fies the more traditional voiceover
that provides some of the backstory
and exposition of the film."
When their hours of work finally
came to an end, Gordon and Mered
ith felt the choice for their first view
er was obvious.
"We showed [Garcia] the film be
fore we showed anybody else,"
Meredith said. "He saw the film, and
he's had fun with it."
Lasseter, Lee, Parker... Gordon
and Meredith?
While pleased about the final
product, both filmmakers were excit
ed and humbled when they were cho
sen as third-place winners of the 2010
Student Academy Award in the doc
umentary category.
"We knew it was a good movie,"
Gordon admitted. "We just thought
it was worth a shot. I mean, you just
have to put these movies out there
and see what happens."
"I definitely was not expecting it
to do as well as it did," he added.
The student competition of the
Academy Awards judges films each
year in four categories: animation,
documentary, narrative and alterna
tive. Submitted films have to pass
various rounds of the competition,
with the regional finalists going on to
compete for three winning slots in
each category.
Because of the multiple rounds,
Gordon remembers the initial confu
sion upon receiving the notification.
"When I first got the letter, I
thought it was just repeating some
thing that we knew before," he said.
"Then I was like, 'Oh my god, we ac
tually [won]."'
Since its inception in 1973, the
Stanford Graduate Program in Doc
umentary Film and Video has had 21
films honored at the awards.
Past winners at the awards include
John Lasseter from Pixar's "Toy
Story" series, noted director Spike
Lee and Trey Parker of "South Park"
fame. However, Gordon and Mered
ith are hesitant to line themselves up
in that marquee of names just yet.

"It's kind of funny," Meredith said
with a hint of embarrassment. "I
wouldn't compare myself to them at
this point, but this is the beginning,
and the hope is that we will go on to
be recognized that way."
"It's a great encouragement to get
early in your career to know that
you're on the right path and doing
something that people like and ap
preciate," Gordon said.
Both are now focused on working
on their individual theses while eye

ing the dream of creating a feature
length documentary in the future.
When asked if they would consider
working with one another again, the
budding filmmakers responded very
positively.
"I plan on working and collaborat
ing with [my classmates] for the rest
of my life," Gordon said emphatical
ly. Meredith agreed.

Stanford M.F.A. students Kevin Gordon (left) and Rebekah Meredith (right)
won a bronze medal at the 2010 Student Academy Awards for their documentary,
"Dreams Awake," a film portrait of a Cantor Arts Center janitor.
While Stanford University is
recognized as home to some
of the brightest minds in the
world, some of the school's
most inspiring intellectual
gems can often remain tragically unseen. In
some cases, they might even be hidden just be
hind a paper towel and a half-filled bottle of
multi-purpose cleaner.
Doroteo Garcia is a janitor at the Cantor
Arts Center at Stanford. To first-year M.F.A.
students Kevin Gordon and Rebekah Mered
ith, however, Garcia is far more than his occu
pation; he is a poet, a historian and an activist.
And also the focus of their critically acclaimed
documentary, "Dreams Awake," which earned
Gordon and Meredith a bronze medal in the
2010 Student Academy Awards last month.
"[Garcia is] a very humble person," Mered

ith said. "He's very involved in the community.
He's had us over to his house several times for
dinner or just to have some coffee."
Throughout winter quarter, Gordon and
Meredith filmed and edited the documentary,
following the janitor through his workday and
after hours in an attempt to showcase his voice
and poetry.
"At heart, it's a film about really seeing peo
ple who are often unnoticed ... and have sto
ries that are yet to be heard," Meredith said.
Dreams Awaken
The project first emerged out of Film Prod
402, a winter quarter course for M.F.A. docu
mentary students where those enrolled pair up
to produce films.
"In this case, Kevin and Rebekah co-direct
ed and shared the shooting, sound recording
and editing," said art and art history Professor

Jan Krawitz, instructor of the course and also
the director of the M.F.A. program in docu
mentary film.
Aside from a length requirement, students
were allowed to choose whatever topic inter
ested them upon approval by course faculty.
Gordon and Meredith's initial research in
volved hours of sifting through articles, bounc
ing topics off of one another and making lists of
potential ideas.
"We both had an idea of doing an observa
tional film," Gordon said. "We spent several
weeks shopping different ideas, and a friend
forwarded us an article about Doroteo in The
New York Times. We were captivated by his
poetry, as well as the space of the art museum."
Because the article was printed in 2005,
both were thrilled to discover that Garcia still
worked at Cantor. When they presented their

idea for a documentary, the janitor's initial
skepticism soon grew into enthusiasm.
"We had to communicate our vision of what
we wanted to do with the film, and he was ex
cited that his poetry would be in the film and
get some exposure," Meredith recalled.
"He was totally game for a movie," Gordon
added.
The filmmakers spent the next few weeks
storyboarding their idea before recording the
seven-minute documentary in four shoots last
ing a few hours each.
"Dreams Awaken" ultimately paints a re
flective, emotional portrait of Garcia by focus
ing on controlled, stylized scenes of the janitor
working at the Cantor Arts Center, leading a
union activist meeting for Hispanic workers.
and learning English with Habla el
Dia at Stanford's El Centro Chicano.
Gordon and Meredith enlivened
each scene with voiceovers from Gar
cia himself, using segments from an
interview and stanzas read from his
original poetry.
"Rebekah and Kevin had to figure
out away to represent Doro's poetry,
and they decided to allow his words
to complement the scenes from his
life that play out in the film," Krawitz
said. "The voice of his poetry ampli
fies the more traditional voiceover
that provides some of the backstory
and exposition of the film."
When their hours of work finally
came to an end, Gordon and Mered
ith felt the choice for their first view
er was obvious.
"We showed [Garcia] the film be
fore we showed anybody else,"
Meredith said. "He saw the film, and
he's had fun with it."
Lasseter, Lee, Parker... Gordon
and Meredith?
While pleased about the final
product, both filmmakers were excit
ed and humbled when they were cho
sen as third-place winners of the 2010
Student Academy Award in the doc
umentary category.
"We knew it was a good movie,"
Gordon admitted. "We just thought
it was worth a shot. I mean, you just
have to put these movies out there
and see what happens."
"I definitely was not expecting it
to do as well as it did," he added.
The student competition of the
Academy Awards judges films each
year in four categories: animation,
documentary, narrative and alterna
tive. Submitted films have to pass
various rounds of the competition,
with the regional finalists going on to
compete for three winning slots in
each category.
Because of the multiple rounds,
Gordon remembers the initial confu
sion upon receiving the notification.
"When I first got the letter, I
thought it was just repeating some
thing that we knew before," he said.
"Then I was like, 'Oh my god, we ac
tually [won]."'
Since its inception in 1973, the
Stanford Graduate Program in Doc
umentary Film and Video has had 21
films honored at the awards.
Past winners at the awards include
John Lasseter from Pixar's "Toy
Story" series, noted director Spike
Lee and Trey Parker of "South Park"
fame. However, Gordon and Mered
ith are hesitant to line themselves up
