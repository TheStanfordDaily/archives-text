# Janitor's tale gains Hollywood notice
## 'Dreams Awake' documentary wins Student Academy Award 
### DANIEL BUI STAFF WRITER 
While Stanford University is
recognized as home to some
of the brightest minds in the
world, some of the school's
most inspiring intellectual
gems can often remain tragically unseen. In
some cases, they might even be hidden just be
hind a paper towel and a half-filled bottle of
multi-purpose cleaner.
Doroteo Garcia is a janitor at the Cantor
Arts Center at Stanford. To first-year M.F.A.
students Kevin Gordon and Rebekah Mered
ith, however, Garcia is far more than his occu
pation; he is a poet, a historian and an activist.
And also the focus of their critically acclaimed
documentary, "Dreams Awake," which earned
Gordon and Meredith a bronze medal in the
2010 Student Academy Awards last month.
"[Garcia is] a very humble person," Mered

ith said. "He's very involved in the community.
He's had us over to his house several times for
dinner or just to have some coffee."
Throughout winter quarter, Gordon and
Meredith filmed and edited the documentary,
following the janitor through his workday and
after hours in an attempt to showcase his voice
and poetry.
"At heart, it's a film about really seeing peo
ple who are often unnoticed ... and have sto
ries that are yet to be heard," Meredith said.
Dreams Awaken
The project first emerged out of Film Prod
402, a winter quarter course for M.F.A. docu
mentary students where those enrolled pair up
to produce films.
"In this case, Kevin and Rebekah co-direct
ed and shared the shooting, sound recording
and editing," said art and art history Professor

Jan Krawitz, instructor of the course and also
the director of the M.F.A. program in docu
mentary film.
Aside from a length requirement, students
were allowed to choose whatever topic inter
ested them upon approval by course faculty.
Gordon and Meredith's initial research in
volved hours of sifting through articles, bounc
ing topics off of one another and making lists of
potential ideas.
"We both had an idea of doing an observa
tional film," Gordon said. "We spent several
weeks shopping different ideas, and a friend
forwarded us an article about Doroteo in The
New York Times. We were captivated by his
poetry, as well as the space of the art museum."
Because the article was printed in 2005,
both were thrilled to discover that Garcia still
worked at Cantor. When they presented their

idea for a documentary, the janitor's initial
skepticism soon grew into enthusiasm.
"We had to communicate our vision of what
we wanted to do with the film, and he was ex
cited that his poetry would be in the film and
get some exposure," Meredith recalled.
"He was totally game for a movie," Gordon
added.
The filmmakers spent the next few weeks
storyboarding their idea before recording the
seven-minute documentary in four shoots last
ing a few hours each.
"Dreams Awaken" ultimately paints a re
flective, emotional portrait of Garcia by focus
ing on controlled, stylized scenes of the janitor
working at the Cantor Arts Center, leading a
union activist meeting for Hispanic workers.
