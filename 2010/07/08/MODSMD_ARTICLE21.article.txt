## MOVIE REVIEW "DESPICABLE ME" ...NOT AS DESPICABLE AS I EXPECTED 
### – annika HEINLE contact annika: anheinle@stanford. edu 
Some of the most popular films so far
this year have been 3-D animated
kids movies. Flicks like "How To
Train Your Dragon," "Shrek: The Final
Chapter" and "Toy Story 3" have all dom
inated in the box office, with families turn
ing out in droves for original and light
humor. Universal's latest foray into this
genre certainly does not disappoint.
Conceived by a Spanish animator and cre
ated in a French animation house, this
Hollywood blockbuster has hints of
European flair that set it apart from all of
the rest.
"Despicable Me" tells the story of the
nefarious Russian villain Gru (Steve
Carell) who has a laughably thick accent
and a very distinct, hooked nose. After a
neglected childhood, Gru has grown into
one of the world's most formidable vil
lains. With a crotchety mad scientist assis

tant, Dr. Nefario (Russell Brand), and
thousands of little yellow minions (some
what reminiscent of the alien toys from the
"Toy Story" series), Gru has positioned
himself to commit the dastardliest crime in
villain history to steal the moon.
His plans are quickly thwarted and
hijacked by the new villain in town, Vector
(Jason Segel). Dressed in a hilarious
orange tracksuit, with a fanny pack slung
around his hips, Vector is the definition of
"nerd," wielding sleek guns that shoot
squid and piranhas. However, thanks to
the support of the Bank of Evil (formerly
the Lehman Brothers), Vector has every
thing he needs to become the most leg
endary villain of all time.
In order to defy all odds and regain his
reputation, Gru adopts three little girls to
infiltrate Vector's fortress. It is here when
the movie deviates from slightly stale, dark

humor to a movie with heart. Gru is
steadily softened by his daughters his
Grinch-like exterior is stripped away as he
takes them to an amusement park, helps
them prepare for their ballet recital and
teaches them how to drink tea. It quickly
becomes apparent that Gru's priorities
may have started to change would he
rather steal the moon and become the
greatest villain of all time or instead strive
for being the best clad of all time?
With a musical score that toes the line
between hip-hop and James Bond (com
posed by Pharrell Williams), an original
screenplay and a bevy of A-list character
actors, it is easy to see why "Despicable
Me" will be a hit both with the critics and
in the box office. However, that doesn't
mean that the movie is perfect. At many
points, "Despicable Me" fails where Pixar
thrives. Regularly, the humor is directed

at a much younger audience, which falls
flat with the many adults present. The
movie was also made with a much smaller
budget than its Pixar/Dreamworks coun
terparts, and this shows. However, that is
not necessarily a bad thing, with the
campy animation lending a fresh take to
the 3-D element and giving the whole
movie a comic book feel.
"Despicable Me" achieves what it
should —it makes the audience laugh,
crafts an original storyline, showcases act
ing talents and at many times warms your
heart. However, it's no game changer, like
most Pixar flicks. In the end, Gru is still
playing second fiddle.
