## Xanh ... More Like Yawn!

What's better than Vietnamese food? Vietnamese
food with a gorgeous wait staff in a place
decked with sleek, modern decor. Walking into
the Vietnamese-fusion Xanh, the flash of the restaurant
is overwhelming. You get what you pay for here: you're
paying for that chalice of a soda, and you're paying for
the chic restaurant to cater to some of the most "discern
ing and sophisticated" guests in Northern California.
Their website is replete with phrases like the ones noting
the "wide-eyed patrons" who are "bathed in soft illumi
nation" in the "dramatic 12,500 square feet" of Xanh!
For fine diners, Xanh is an excellent opportunity to
impress your eating companion with the size of your wal
let and the visual display. The restaurant is truly striking
to the eye. The acid test for working at Xanh must be a
modeling contract, as the visual appeal of the restaurant
seemed to have mapped on to the staff.
Understanding that Xanh is beautiful, with its blue,
almost aqueous decorations, I was confused by the

restaurant's apparent focus. To me, Xanh cared more
about flash than flavor, more presentation than content.
Our dining party, operating on a college student's bud
get, stayed away from the entrees, which can easily run
approximately $2O-25 per dish.
Our first dish, glass noodles and Dungeness crab, was
a tasty vermicelli plate that had a full crab flavor. The
lemongrass chicken, however, was a true disappoint
ment. Not only was the portion miniscule, but the mouth
feel of the chicken was almost grotesque, tasting like an
ill-formed meatball. My favorite dish was the Mellow
Yellow Noodles, with chicken, shrimp and mushrooms
in a reasonable sauce with scallions galore. Xanh's take
on pho, "Pho You, Pho Me," was a bit hard to eat, over
spiced with jalapenos and far from aesthetically pleasing.
The sirloin was colorful, but felt out of place submerged
in the so-called "fragrant" broth.
Compounding my dining experience was our waiter,
who spent the meal hovering over our table, overhear

ing our conversations and consistently keeping watch.
I left the table unsatisfied, feeling that I had overspent
for an underwhelming portion. Yelpers rave about
Xanh's $l2 lunch buffet, but for a dinner the restaurant
packed more pizzazz than punch.
