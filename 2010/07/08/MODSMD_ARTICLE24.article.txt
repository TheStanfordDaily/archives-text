Like college students around the country, Stanford students
love pizza. Options abound for the hungry student in Palo
Alto, ranging from the quick-and-dirty chain cardboard
pie to the multiple-hour dinner experience. Considering this
panoply of pizza possibilities, Howie's Artisan Pizza in Town &
Country Shopping Center stands out as a unique environment
to enjoy the 'za in a casual, yet elegant environment.
Proprietor & Chef Howard Bulka has created a pizza place
that hums with sophistication. For the Stanford student, Bulka's
eatery presents two questions is it worth the wait, and is it

worth the money?
When I went to
Howie's, I had a thirty
five minute wait. Of
course, Town &
Country Shopping
Center has a lot to see,
but thirty-five minutes
to wait while you're
already in town could
be problematic
though it did add to
the ambiance. Wine
bottle containers for
customer's water com-

pound the cosmopolitan dining experience. The bar, wine list
and waiter service also adds to the upper-crust feel of the pizza
place. That said, the splat-blot menu theme and family-friendly
space attempts to decrease the pretentiousness sometimes associ
ated with the "artisan" label.
Eschewing the traditional size choices and delivery services of
a typical pizza joint, Howie's prides itself on taking the time to
cook eacb pizza from scratch using organic and local ingredi
ents when possible. Pizzas only come in one size, whicb was
enough for two people at my table. My dining companion loved
his Chicken Chipotle Melt, especially the blend of sweet peppers
and chipotle mayo.
In sum, Howie's works as a restaurant, but may cater to a dif
ferent crowd. The place is family friendly, with prices and por
tions reasonable for a family's night out. To the college student
looking for a pizza fix, Howie's is worth a try but is unlikely to
become a regular haunt for Stanford students, especially con
sidering the convenience of delivery or the availability of cheap
er options in similar proximity to campus.
