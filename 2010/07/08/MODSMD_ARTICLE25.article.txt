## Octopus predicts German soccer results 
### 
In news that has nothing to do
with Stanford but is of world-histori
cal significance, an unlikely entity
has been predicting Germany's re
sults in the 2010 World Cup in South
Africa. Paul, an octopus residing in
Germany but born in England, has
accurately predicted all of the Ger
man matches so far with a stunning
6-0 record.
His acumen has roused the inter
ests of European betting firms as well
as soccer fans worldwide. Paul most
recently picked Spain to defeat Ger
many, and Germany subsequently
lost 1-0.
For each match, Paul's handlers
lower two containers containing a
tasty mussel into his tank one with
the German flag and the other with
the flag of their opponent. Paul's first
choice is deemed to be his prediction.
Paul is expected to have one more
say in the current World Cup, weigh
ing in on the upcoming third place
match between Germany and
Uruguay â€”while possibly avoiding
the Germany-less final game be
tween Spain and Netherlands.
