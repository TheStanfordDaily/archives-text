# Stanford pitcher honored for summer success in Northeast
## 
### 
The New England Collegiate
Baseball League named Stanford
pitcher Mark Appel co-Pitcher of the
Week for his efforts with the Newport
Gulls.
Appel's seven-inning, two-hit out
ing on June 29 included a no-hitter
through five and two-thirds innings,
and he led the Gulls to a 6-0 victory
over the Keene Swamp Bats. The win
was Appel's third of the season; he
would go on to earn his fourth in four
decisions on July 6 against the Lowell
All-Americans.
So far, Appel has posted an ERA
of 1.78 and held his opponents to just

seven hits in his last 15-and-one-third
innings pitched.
Appel's teammate with the Gulls,
Stanford infielder Kenny Diekroeger,
was named the NECBL's co-Player of
the Week last week and is currently
second in the league with a .380 bat
ting average.
