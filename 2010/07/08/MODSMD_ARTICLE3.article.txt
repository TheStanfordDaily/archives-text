## Stanford doctor named 2010 White House Fellow 
### JANE LEPHAM NEWS EDITOR 
Dr. Pat Basu, a Stanford Universi
ty Medical Center radiologist, has
been named by President Obama as
one of 13 White House Fellows for
the 2010-11 year, and will spend the
next year serving as a full-time assis
tant to a high-level government offi
cial in the administration, to be de
cided later this month.
Basu will meet with First Lady
Michelle Obama, Cabinet secretaries
and other political dignitaries in
Washington, D.C., later this month
to discuss his assignment for the next
year. While fellows' responsibilities
range from chairing interagency
meetings and designing federal poli
cies to drafting speeches for cabinet
secretaries, they will also participate
in an education program consisting
of roundtable discussions with
renowned leaders from the private
and public sectors, and trips to study
U.S. policy in action both domestical
ly and internationally, according to
the White House website.
"I expect this to be very different
from my job as a physician, and quite
frankly I anticipate a once-in-a-life
time opportunity to serve and learn
in the highest levels of federal gov
ernment," Basu said.
Although he said that he is pro
hibited from discussing the details of
his position due to the top-secret se
curity clearance granted with his job,
Basu indicated that he hopes to em
body the ideals that President Lyn
don Johnson envisioned when he
founded the program in 1964: "to
bring fresh ideas and perspective this
year and, more importantly, to devel
op the skills that will help me serve
my country in a better way after this

year."
In addition to working as a radiol
ogist at the Stanford Medical Center
and the VA Palo Alto Health Care
System, Basu is the University course
director for health policy, finance
and economics, and lectures nation
ally and internationally on these top
ics. He serves as a business consul-

tant to medical centers, Fortune 500
companies and venture capital firms,
and co-founded "ExtendMD," a
Web portal designed to enhance out
patient care. He also founded
STARS Luncheon, a non-profit de
signed to support lower socioeco
nomic children for future college and
career success.
For the next year, however, Basu
indicated that he would focus entire
ly on his fellowship, which includes
taking a leave of absence from the
Stanford faculty.
"For the next year, I will be entire
ly focused on serving my country and
developing further skills to continue
to do so in the future," Basu said. "I
envision that as I return to being a
physician, an educator and a business
advisor, this experience working in
the highest levels of the federal gov
ernment will add great perspective."
"As a physician, I have the privi
lege of helping one patient at a time
and, through teaching, I can help one
student at a time both of these are
vitally important," he added. "How
ever, in the long run, I hope to apply
the experience and skills I've learned
to try and improve the health and ed
ucation of hundreds or perhaps even
thousands of Americans someday."
"This year's White House Fellows
are comprised of some of the best
and brightest leaders in our country,"
