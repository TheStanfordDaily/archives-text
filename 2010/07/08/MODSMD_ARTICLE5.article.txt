## Tenant, trustee strike agreement 
### JOSHUA FALK STAFF WRITER 
Angie Cicero has lived in the
same rental house in Union City for
25 years. But since the home's owner
died several years ago and left the
house to Stanford, Cicero has faced
the prospect of eviction.
The Union City homeowner's will
mandates that the house be sold and
the money from the sale donated to
Stanford to fund medical research,
said Lisa Lapin, assistant vice presi
dent for University Communica
tions.
Cicero, 77, suffers from Stage IV
breast cancer that has spread to
other areas of her body. She is a low
income retiree and has no immediate
relatives.
Under the recent settlement
reached by the attorneys of Cicero
and Cathleen Sterling, the will's
trustee, Cicero will move out of her
long-time rental house in exchange
for the payment of her housing costs
for the next five to 10 years, said Ci
cero's attorney Brenda Star Adams.
Cicero must vacate the home by
Aug. 31.
Adams said that her client had
not authorized her to disclose the
amount that she will receive in the
settlement.
"She did agree to vacate the prop
erty in exchange for payment of her
housing expenses at a new location,"
said Adams, who speculated that Ci
cero's housing expenses would be
drawn from the funds that result
from the sale of the rental house,
thus diminishing the donation to
Stanford. Adams estimated that the
house is worth $450,000.
The settlement "should be
enough to provide for her housing
needs for the next five to 10 years,"
Adams said. "She'll be well taken
care of."
Gillian Ross, the trustee's attor
ney, declined to comment on the set
tlement.

"We're still in the middle of final
izing the settlement and seeing
through all of the arrangements, so it

is not appropriate for Ms. Ross or
Ms. Sterling to comment at this
time," read an e-mail from Gillian
Ross's office.
Lapin said that Stanford played
no role in the settlement.
"Ms. Sterling was trying to exe
cute the will, which would leave this
man's estate to Stanford," she said.
"Until this estate is completed, that
house never belonged to Stanford."
"I know that that outcome will
mean that less money comes to Stan
ford," Lapin added, "but that wasn't
up to Stanford. It was up to the
trustee. It was altering the intent of
the man's will."
Lapin lamented Cicero's position,
calling the situation "unfortunate,"
but emphasized that it made no dif
ference that the house had been left
to Stanford.
"It wouldn't matter if he had left
the house to the SPCA, or a museum
or a charity," Lapin said. "Ms. Cicero
would have faced the same situa
tion."
Stanford attempted to connect
Cicero with resources more than
year ago that could have helped her
relocate, but Cicero was not recep
tive to Stanford's assistance, accord
ing to Lapin.
"We offered to help her by
putting her in touch with people who
could help her move and relocate,"
Lapin said. "She refused help from
the county and from adult protective
services."
Cicero's attorney, however, con
tended that Stanford could have op
posed Cicero's eviction.
"Stanford, by not objecting to the
eviction of Ms. Cicero, was allowing
it to take place," Adams argued. "If
Stanford wanted to object, they
could have."
