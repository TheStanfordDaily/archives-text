## Skype plans to move offices to Stanford Research Park 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Uttara Sivaram 
Skype, the popular application that allows users to
make phone calls, send instant messages and communicate
face-to-face over the Internet, is moving its operations to
Palo Alto. The company plans to completely relo
cate from its current offices in San Jose and Brisbane by
Fall 2010, according to CEO Josh Silverman's blog. Effec
tive as early as October 2010, its 80 Bay Area employees
will join the concentration of high-tech companies and
firms in the area by working at the Stanford Research Park.
Owned by the University and located close to campus,
Stanford Research Park is home to Hewlett-Packard's
headquarters and a number of other technology companies
and law and venture capital firms. Both Facebook and Tesla
have relocated to the industrial park in recent months.
Founded in Luxembourg, Skype is similarly stretching
its limbs into the Silicon Valley in the hopes that the change
of location will attract engineers characteristic of the tech
nologically savvy Stanford and Palo Alto community
especially "engineers who are skilled at building ultra-scal
able infrastructure," Silverman said.
"Making this move is an exciting step for us," Silverman
wrote in his blog. "We hope to attract some of the best and
brightest talent in the valley."
Skype's new office will be located at 3210 Porter Drive.
