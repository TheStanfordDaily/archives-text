### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ David Ballantine 
Citing positive results since its 2006 inception, Stanford
administrators announced that they will be renewing their
use of the AlcoholEdu program for four more years.
The University approved more funding for the program
after finding it to be effective training for incoming fresh
men. Ralph Castro, manager of the substance abuse pre
vention program in Health Promotion Services at Vaden
Health Center, presented survey results from four classes
of Stanford students.
The survey indicated that 71 percent found the program
somewhat effective, 77 percent acknowledged they learned
something and nearly 50 percent said the material better
prepared them to deal with alcohol at Stanford. Results like
this imply a reduction in alcohol use and abuse among col
lege students because of AlcoholEdu, Castro said.
The University's cost-analysis of the program's annual

cost of $lB,OOO evaluated factors such as emergency room
trips for alcohol poisoning, police response to emergen
cies, Residence Deans' involvement and the cost of missed
classes.
