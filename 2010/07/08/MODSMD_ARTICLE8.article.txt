### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€” Jessica Lieberman 
San Francisco's famed Bay to Breakers Race will be al
cohol-free for its centennial race next May 15.
Due to numerous complaints by residents along the
7.46-mile route and the hospitalization of 30 intoxicated
participants this year, race organizers have decided to pro
hibit all alcoholic beverages during the race.
This decision also comes on the heels of an announce
ment that insurance company ING will be pulling out as
the race's chief corporate sponsor after five years. Race or
ganizers believe that, although their decision was not pro
voked by the departure of ING, making the race safer by
banning alcohol will make finding a new sponsor easier.
Race Executive Director Angela Fang said that keg
floats will be banned and violators will be arrested, cited
and fined, according to a report by the San Jose Mercury
News.
The 99-year-old, 12-km footrace, held annually in San
Francisco, Calif., is one of the world's largest and oldest
races. The course leads thousands of contestants from the
northeast end of the downtown area, near The Embar
cadero, to the west end of the city and Ocean Beach. In ad
dition to its featured world-class athletes, the race has also
become famous for participants wearing crazy costumes,
or even no costumes at all.
