# High-speed rail ridership projections questioned
## 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Joseph Beyda 
Palo Alto and four other cities have called on the Cali
fornia High-Speed Rail Authority to review allegedly un
reasonable ridership projections for the proposed line.
The cities of Palo Alto, Menlo Park, Atherton,
Burlingame and Belmont, which comprise the Peninsula
Cities Consortium, claim that the estimates were made
hurriedly in an attempt to begin construction on the San
Francisco-to-San Jose line by September 2012. Meeting
this deadline could qualify the high-speed rail project for
up to $l7 billion in federal stimulus grants, though only
$2.25 billion has been committed.
If the current ridership model is used for decision-mak-
ing, the consortium argues, the sys
tem put in place will be a broken one.
Though federal funding, if granted,
will help complete the $43 billion
project, the cities are calling for bet
ter planning to ensure the system's vi
ability.
"The project is suffering from an
enormous credibility problem, due to
its widely criticized business plan,
faulty ridership numbers and the ab
sence of funding to carry out the pro
ject statewide," said Rich Cline, chair
of the consortium and mayor of
Menlo Park, to Palo Alto Online.

The consortium's outcry was
prompted by a report produced by
the Institute of Transportation Stud
ies at UC-Berkeley. It claimed that
the projections, which asserted that
the project would be financially self
sustaining, were flawed.
Earlier this year, similar claims
were made by watchdog group Cali
fornians Advocating Responsible
Rail Design, based in Palo Alto.
The line in question will run from
San Francisco to San Jose, with a
Redwood City/Palo Alto station a
few miles from Stanford. With Propo
sition 1A in 2008, California ap
proved $9.95 billion for the line and
similar projects, but much of the fund
ing has yet to be received.
