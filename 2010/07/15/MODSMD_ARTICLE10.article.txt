## Lokey stem cell lab set to open in late September 
### BUYAN PAN DAILY INTERN 
Construction activities for the
Lorry I. Lokey Stem Cell Research
Building are essentially complete, ac
cording to Stephen Pond, the build
ing's project manager on behalf of the
University's Land Buildings and Real
Estate organization. The new labora
tory, dedicated to facilitating stem cell
research, is set to open its doors at the
heart of the School of Medicine in late
September.
The 200,000-square-foot building
will house the Stanford Institute for
Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative
Medicine, and will bring together re
searchers of various fields, including
cardiovascular medicine, cancer and
immunology, to search for applica
tions of innovations in stem cell re
search to medical treatments.
Over the next few months, equip
ment and furniture will be installed
and building systems will be tested.
The final inspection and signoff of the
building are projected to take place in
mid-September, and the first staff
members plan to move in at the end of
that month.
One of the building's major fea
tures is a basement level dedicated to
housing approximately 26,000 mice
that will be used for research, resting
below the three floors of labs and sup
port spaces for their human re
searchers.
"We believe this facility will be the
largest single structure in the world
dedicated solely to stem cell research,
as well as having one of the largest
mice vivariums in the United States,"
Pond said, explaining that the vivari
um is a "barrier" facility in which the
health of the mice is carefully protect
ed against disease.
The mice are tested for infections
before they join the vivarium, and staff
members who take care of them han
dle them in special ways to ensure that
the population will not be contaminat
ed by outside infections.
Pond believed that the new re
search facility would represent oppor
tunities for developments in stem cell
research that will have long-term posi
tive impacts.
"The hope and aspiration of the re

search programs that will be contained
in the building are to translate the re
search into cures for many significant
diseases and genetic disorders that af
fect the human population throughout
the world," he said.

Sarah Heilshorn, a professor in
Materials Science and Engineering,
believed that having a building facility
dedicated entirely to stem cell re
search would facilitate collaboration
between researchers.
"Previously, much of the work was
being performed at satellite locations
away from campus, which made it dif
ficult to meet with collaborators and
share reagents, cells and data between
the laboratories on campus and those
off campus," Heilshorn said. "The new
stem cell building will serve as a great
initiation point to seed future interdis
ciplinary research projects in stem cell
biology and regenerative medicine."
"It is very exciting to have a physi
cal and intellectual home for the stem
cell research community on the Stan
ford campus," she added.
The building, which cost approxi
mately $2OO million, received private
donations and University contribu
tions, including a $75 million donation
from its namesake, as well as a grant of
$43 million from the California Insti
tute of Regenerative Medicine
(CIRM). It includes nearly 500,000
pounds of sheet metal ductwork for air
conditioners, 9,000 electrical circuits
and 70,000 linear feet of copper water
piping.
