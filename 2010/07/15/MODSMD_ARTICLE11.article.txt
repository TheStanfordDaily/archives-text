## Study suggests upcoming rise in heat waves by 2039 
### NICOLA PARK DAILY INTERN 
While skeptics brush off global
warming as a distant catastrophe, a
new Stanford study suggests that heat
waves and extremely high tempera
tures could become commonplace in
the United States by 2039.
After nearly two years of research
analyzing computerized climate mod
eling, Noah Diffenbaugh, a professor
of environmental Earth system science
and a center fellow at the Woods Insti
tute for the Environment, and former
postdoctoral fellow Moetasim Ashfaq
found that the number of heat waves

per decade within the United States
could rise within the next few decades.
"We were trying to see the potential
danger of climate change within the
envelope that global leaders decided
was the threshold," Diffenbaugh said.
In the 2009 Copenhagen Accord,
global leaders agreed to consider ac
tion that would hold off the rise in glob
al temperature to below 2 degrees Cel
sius. Despite this policy to limit global
warming, the study indicates that even
the two-degree limit on temperature
increase does not avoid temporal ex
tremes and heat intensification.
"We should have an aggressive tar
get," said Ashfaq, now a researcher at

Oak Ridge Climate Change Science
Institute. "Two degrees centigrade is
not enough. If [we] keep it as a proto
col issue and do not reach any agree
ment, and if we do not have a cap on
those emissions, then there's going to
be a very drastic effect and severe con
sequences."
The study also found data that sup
ports an increase in exceedences
periods of warm weather hotter and
longer than usual throughout the
next three decades. The study's find
ings indicate that there will be three to
four exceedences per decade over a
large portion of the United States. The
heat waves will also intensify, with up

to eight exceedences per decade in the
western United States and four per
decade for the eastern United States
from 2020 to 2029, according to the
study.
Heat waves will hit the country
across the board, but the western re
gion of the United States will have to
bear with the severest effects. Diffen
baugh and Ashfaq conducted their
study based on data from the last 50
years.
"We did a high-resolution climate
model experiment that's not available
for other regions of the globe with this
