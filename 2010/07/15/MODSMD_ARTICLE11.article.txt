## Study suggests upcoming rise in heat waves by 2039 
### NICOLA PARK DAILY INTERN 
While skeptics brush off global
warming as a distant catastrophe, a
new Stanford study suggests that heat
waves and extremely high tempera
tures could become commonplace in
the United States by 2039.
After nearly two years of research
analyzing computerized climate mod
eling, Noah Diffenbaugh, a professor
of environmental Earth system science
and a center fellow at the Woods Insti
tute for the Environment, and former
postdoctoral fellow Moetasim Ashfaq
found that the number of heat waves

per decade within the United States
could rise within the next few decades.
"We were trying to see the potential
danger of climate change within the
envelope that global leaders decided
was the threshold," Diffenbaugh said.
In the 2009 Copenhagen Accord,
global leaders agreed to consider ac
tion that would hold off the rise in glob
al temperature to below 2 degrees Cel
sius. Despite this policy to limit global
warming, the study indicates that even
the two-degree limit on temperature
increase does not avoid temporal ex
tremes and heat intensification.
"We should have an aggressive tar
get," said Ashfaq, now a researcher at

Oak Ridge Climate Change Science
Institute. "Two degrees centigrade is
not enough. If [we] keep it as a proto
col issue and do not reach any agree
ment, and if we do not have a cap on
those emissions, then there's going to
be a very drastic effect and severe con
sequences."
The study also found data that sup
ports an increase in exceedences
periods of warm weather hotter and
longer than usual throughout the
next three decades. The study's find
ings indicate that there will be three to
four exceedences per decade over a
large portion of the United States. The
heat waves will also intensify, with up

to eight exceedences per decade in the
western United States and four per
decade for the eastern United States
from 2020 to 2029, according to the
study.
Heat waves will hit the country
across the board, but the western re
gion of the United States will have to
bear with the severest effects. Diffen
baugh and Ashfaq conducted their
study based on data from the last 50
years.
"We did a high-resolution climate
model experiment that's not available
for other regions of the globe with this
kind of detail," Diffenbaugh said, ex
plaining why the study focused exclu
sively on the United States.
An important aspect of their work,
according to Ashfaq, was the predic
tion of changes that would happen in
the short term.
"What may happen in terms of
temperatures and extremes is more
important than what may happen by
the end of the century," he said, em
phasizing the importance of answers
to immediate events.
The study's findings surprised Dif
fenbaugh and Ashfaq.
"I was surprised to see extreme hot
events increase as much as they do so
soon," Diffenbaugh said.
"If you're looking 100 years from
now it's not a big surprise," Ashfaq
said. "We are showing that it is going
to happen in the near future, and this
was a big surprise for us because we
were not expecting an increasing
number in the next few decades."
Ashfaq added that the rise in heat
waves could lead to what he calls "ex
treme" weather, which is "anything
above normal, such as below or above
normal temperature and a consistent
anomaly for a long period [of time],"
he said. "Extreme temperature is as
sociated with extreme weather; any
thing beyond normal is going to have
adverse effects on natural and human
systems."
A rise in the number of heat waves

has an impact on human health and
gives rise to more widespread heat-re
lated illness.
"Severe temperatures and heat
waves can cause excess mortality [as
well as] many other effects," Diffen
baugh said.
In 2003, a heat wave in Europe
killed at least 35,000 people, according
to the New Scientist journal.
Other effects could also have a
drastic impact on the economy, in
cluding agriculture.
"Heat waves usually occur when
you have less precipitation, [and a]
rise in heat waves indirectly means a
decrease in rainfall," Ashfaq said. "It
puts direct pressure on the economy
because heat waves use more energy
people would turn toward using
energy in terms of cooling equipment.
This is going to put a lot of pressure on
the existing setup."
The recently published study was
one that focused on heat waves and
temperature, but is only one of a series
of studies on global warming.
"Right now we're doing a couple
more," Ashfaq said. "One is focused
on the western United States' snow
cover and another is on precipita
tion."
The duo is also studying potential
changes to stream flow over the next
30 or 40 years.
According to Diffenbaugh, the
team is also "continuing to try to un
derstand the reliability of predictions
on these regional and local scales over
the next few decades."
