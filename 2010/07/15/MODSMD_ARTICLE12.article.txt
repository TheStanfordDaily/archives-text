## THIS COLUMN SENT FROM MY IPHONE The 						Kids are All Right, Dammit 
### Peter McDonald 
A scant two weeks ago, my debut col
umn brought me a surprising number
of editorial responses, particularly
from EPGY campers who were angry at the
insulting tone of my stance toward them.
Admittedly, I was taken aback at their com
plaints of my calling them "lazy," "spoiled"
and "shiftless" (or whatever they said) and
other sundry pejoratives I never actually
used. But it makes sense, their outrage. It
turns out, I'm not just some English major
writing a column to ward off summer bore
dom; I'm officially a member of the news
media now, and even though I swore I'd
always stick up for them, I had continued the
shameful news media tradition of treating
teenagers as though they were an alien
species a lazy, spoiled, stupid, self
obsessed, possibly drug-addled, back-talking,
irrational alien species with a poor work
ethic, worse impulse control and no account
ability. Those campers should be thankful I
didn't trot out neuroscience professors to talk
about how it's all because the smart part of
the brain hasn't fully developed yet, always
with quotes that sound ten times more intelli
gent than the ones they elicit from those
damn kids.
Thank God I'm a grown-up responsible col

lege student who reads the sources of all cul
tural knowledge, the New York Times and
Los Angeles Times, which just ran articles say
ing that Le√üron James's evisceration of the
city of Cleveland's heart "simply puts him in
step with others of his generation" and that the
"American Dream is elusive for [the] new gen
eration" because some dude in suburban
Boston turned down a $40,000-a-year job and
lives at home. Oh.
Readers: I have about 500 words left to pro
vide some much-needed perspective to the
news media, which has just worked itself into
another foam about the direction of the "so
called Millennials," with their reluctance to
embrace corporate culture and their unmiti
gated gall to have this attitude in the midst of
a recession.
Requisite disclaimer: I know the old people
news media is not a monolith, and that there
are plenty o' journalists out there writing trend
pieces about young people that are under
standing instead of presumptive, but if your
top papers are going to keep assuming that all
18-30 year olds act and think the same, espe
cially when you just focus on my white, mid
dle-class cohorts, then I'm going to feel some
what justified in returning the favor.
First, let's get something straight, geezers.

We are not Generation Y, Generation Next or
the Baby Boom Echo. Every other generation
in the history of cultural trend pieces has had
its own name, but you just can't be bothered to
think of something unique for us? Please,
we're the Millennials. Remember the name.
Second, I understand the whole need for us
to have financial independence, but why do
you feel it so imperative to, as the New
American put it, "remind" us "adult children
of the realities of life"? After all, wasn't it you
guys that created "Dilbert" and "Office
Space" to expose the soul-crushing drudgery
of corporate office life? And it was you guys
that turned "Oh, The Places You'll Go!" into
one of the most popular graduation gifts of all
time. You guys raged against the rat race men
tality of the 1950s and turned "follow your
dreams" into a "Brave New World"-esque
mantra. Now you're going to hold it against us
that we've still internalized those messages?
I'm trying to learn from my elders as well as
minimize my mid-life crisis (a phenomenon
that you created, btdubs) so that it doesn't
destroy my marriage and auto insurance pre
miums. Isn't it possible that delaying my
career until I'm sure it's one I actually want
might help with that?
But all borderline-emo ranting aside, news

media, I really don't understand why it always
has to be a generation thing with you guys,
man. I came across a book called "Managing
the Millennial Generation," and most of the
tips in there seemed useful for managing all
people, not just the "unmanageable" whipper
snappers. While I no longer have to deal with
the media ascribing a total lack of agency to all
of my actions, their tendency to interpret ran
dom individuals' actions as reflective of my
entire generation's actions can still approach
maddening. If you keep running trend pieces
with this type of angle, then the dreaded neu
roimaging-laced news segments this time
about how the brain chemistry of a recent col
lege graduate has changed over the years and
how the 21-year old brain is still developing
the parts where it learns some goddamn
responsibility are poised to pull a Brett
Favre, who belongs to your generation, by the
way.

those confounded kids riding their skateboards
all over to petermc@stanford.edu.
