# OH! SWEET NUTHIN'

As I look at him across the sea on my
computer screen, displayed in so many
pixels, Alex Rich looks a lot like he
does in his Facebook photos. He's a nice look
ing: 20-something Caucasian, with long dark
hair, full lips and a bit of stubble. A face you
might've seen around campus these past few
years. Compare this to pictures on his fan
page, MySpace and personal website. In them,
half-dressed and high-contrast, he looks like a
perfume ad, specifically a scratch-'n'-sniff in a
Chinese fashion magazine. He looks like the
Asian pop-star the white Asian pop star
he's aspiring to be.
"I've got you kind of perched here," Rich
says with an easy smile, "On this like, tower of
things. It's the only way I could get the light,
the reception, everything to work." Within
seconds the call is dropped and I'm scrambling
with Skype for another peek at the Beijing
skyline. "Bright, bright blue," he tells me,
winking at the glaring white overcast.
Rich majored in Chinese at Stanford, tak
ing two years of courses and the intensive sum
mer Mandarin program. That's when he first
went to China. He didn't return until this
spring when he was flown out by "Super Boy,"
a televised Chinese singing contest inspired by
the "Pop Idol" series. Rich lost the contest but
has since started talks with national record
labels. If he makes it big, he believes he'll be
the first white singer ever to do so in China.
When I talk with him, he is practicing to record
his first demo. I ask what it's like for him to
write songs in Mandarin. He laughs. "It's basi
cally impossible." He's in a highly improbable

situation for a non-native speaker. For any
one, for that matter.
He never would have even heard of the
contest if a friend hadn't, in passing, asked him
to be an extra in a video shoot. When he found
out that the video being filmed was for a
Chinese singing contest, Rich knew he had to
compete. He has been singing since childhood,
and by the time he graduated, in winter of
2010, had decided to pursue music as his "one
and only career plan." If he ever thought
about being a professional musician in China,
it never once seemed like a real possibility.
That all changed with the show. The producers
liked his audition enough to move him along
the competition, and when he was named
among the top five in North America out of
seventy finalists, the idea started to look a lit
tle less crazy.
At home, news of Rich's endeavor receives
a mixed reaction. Some are critical. Two
Chinese-American girls, watching videos of
him online, balk. "His Chinese isn't good
enough to write songs," one says. "Its just
because he's white!" But they're glued to their
laptop. On the screen, Rich is against a back
ground of Chinese script, crooning a Mandarin
ballad into a microphone, and surrounded by
bubbles. "I've definitely seen him around,
though," one mutters. The other says she has
too. A third student watches over their shoul
ders for some time before finally saying, stone
faced, "He was after my ex-girlfriend for a
while, while we were dating."

I share their fascination. While I interview
him, I keep getting tripped up on these details:

we have 40 Facebook friends in common, he
was in Everyday People, that's Theta Delt in
the background of one of his early promotion
al videos. But in his headshots, in his aspira
tions, he's become an image, an icon not a
person. At least with a Western celebrity we
have a hard-sought sense of their lives, either
through their art, or through tabloids and real
ity television shows. But I can little more per
sonify the celebrity models in Chinese adver
tisements than I can the miniature household
appliances they're holding. A Chinese pop
star? That's so strange! So foreign! So far
away!

And yet, there it is. There he is, I should
say. And thus, there we are. The roads out of
the Stanford bubble lead not only to start-ups,
laboratories, professorial seats and political
office: some forge deep into places we haven't
even thought to fathom. Alex Rich is scouting
out new territory in an evolving world. Before
he blips off the screen one last time, he tells me
about how he spent hours one afternoon in the
teashop across the street. He serenaded the
shop-keep, who he asked to critique his
Mandarin lyrics, then he stayed to discuss
America, music and then the tea trade with the
curious throng that gathered. So this is what a
Stanford student does when he graduates.
Even Alex sounds a little incredulous.
