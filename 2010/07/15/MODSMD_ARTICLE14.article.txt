Dear editor,
It is regrettable that PBS allowed its repu
tation to be marred and compromised by air
ing the documentary "Turmoil and Triumph,"
an uncritical, distorted, flattering history of
the Reagan era. Secretary of State George
Shultz was gushingly self-aggrandizing.
Glaringly omitted from the film was the illegal
funding of the Contras leading to the Iran-
Contra scandal, which should have resulted in
the impeachment of Ronald Reagan.
Predictably, Shultz tiptoed around the issue.
According to The New York Times
undisclosed by PBS the documentary was
partially sponsored by corporations directly
linked to Shultz's career, most prominently
the Bechtel Corporation. Another noted
omission was Shultz's role in supporting the
disastrous invasion of Iraq. Coincidentally,
Bechtel won huge construction contracts dur
ing Shultz's tenure as director. Granting the
"no-bid exclusive" contracts to Bechtel was
severely castigated by the special inspector
general for Iraq reconstruction.
PBS has unwittingly been used for political
gain. The company that produced the film,
Free to Choose Media, has received funding
from the conservative Bradley Foundation,
which is part of the Palmer R. Chitester Fund.
"Turmoil and Triumph" falls far short of
PBS's general guidelines insisting that producers
adhere to the highest professional standards
including "real or perceived conflicts of inter
est." I urge concerned readers to write to PBS
ombudsman Michael Getler and ask him to
investigate the relationship between George
Shultz et al. and the corporate sponsors of
"Turmoil and Triumph" (ombudsman@pbs.org,
703- 739-5290).
