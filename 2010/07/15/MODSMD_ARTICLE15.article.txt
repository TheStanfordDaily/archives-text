## Green dorm blossoms as 'LotusOne' 
### TYLER BROWN STAFF WRITER 
Stanford's interdisciplinary studies so far have
extended mostly to classes and research programs. But if
David Geeter 'll has his way, they will be part of a
building a green dorm, branded "Lotus One," pro
posed for construction behind Bob, La Casa Italiana and
Xanadu on the Row.
The long-awaited Lotus One, which according to its
website seeks to be "the most desirable housing on cam
pus" and a "living laboratory," pack "measurable envi
ronmental performance" and achieve "economic sus
tainability," has been under development off and on for
the last seven years. And if Geeter and co-author
Alexander Luisi 'l2 sufficiently convince President John
Hennessy to sign onto their proposal, Lotus One may be
ready for students by the end of 2011.
The green dorm idea began in 2003 with a faculty
committee from the department of civil and environ
mental engineering (CEE). The Green Dorm Faculty
Committee, working with students and professionals,
conceptualized the project and had it reviewed by
Student Housing and Land, Buildings & Real Estate.
Over the years, students who have wanted to get
involved in the project have enrolled in the Sustainable
Development Studio course (CEE 124), where students
complete projects that support the green dorm's devel
opment. Recent classes have used a class blog, where
students posted research on building materials, energy
use and water consumption, along with less technical
aspects such as whether the building should be a dorm or
a self-operated house.
The project made more concrete progress in 2005
when organizers commissioned a feasibility study from
EHDD Architecture, a San Francisco-based firm. The
study was completed in 2006.
That same year, the project received a $75,000 grant

from the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency. According to
Geeter and Luisi, shortly thereafter the
University offered to cover half the pro
ject's $lO million upfront cost.
With money flowing and optimism high, it
was predicted the dorm would open its doors in
2009.
"When I was a freshman I was under the impression
the building would be built by the time I graduated,"
Geeter said.
But it was not to be.
The intervening financial crisis and subsequent bud
get cuts led the University to cancel funding for con
struction not already underway. That meant the
Lotus One lacked the cash it needed to get off the
ground. The green dorm idea "lost momentum," Geeter
said, and up until about a year and a half ago, the project
was in limbo within the CEE department.
Last year, to revive the project, Geeter and Luisi
approached the faculty committee about expanding its
scope to include students in the social sciences as well,
potentially increasing students' direct involvement in
development and execution.
Geeter and Luisi solicited input from professors out
side the School of Engineering and put together a focus S
group of student leaders "basically that represented the "
general interest of students on campus," Geeter said
a move that Geeter and Luisi hoped would gather per
spectives on what one should consider in building a
dorm.
"I think the biggest pull from Lotus One is that stu
dents have more ownership over the operation of the
campus," Geeter said.
As a sustainable building, the green dorm is designed
to generate a surplus of energy and reduce its water con
sumption to roughly half that of other dorms. But as a
living lab, little about the building is completely fixed.

Students *
would be encouraged to
research modifications that make
the dorm more efficient economically,
socially and environmentally.
It's all about "coming up with a new way of
educating students and making sure students are as
actively involved in the process as possible," said
Vincent Chen 'l2, who designed the Lotus One propos
al. "Before it is built, and after it is built if it's built
there are multiple ways to get students involved."
Recently, the ASSU has shown support for the pro
ject as well. ASSU President Angelina Cardona 'll and
Vice President Kelsei Wharton 'l2 supported the pro
ject during their campaign and were "involved in the
brainstorming process to reframe and rename"
Lotus One, according to Cardona.
The bulk of their involvement, she said, was building
student support with a mass email sent to the student
body on June 23.
That support, to Geeter, has to embody a deep com
mitment. Typically, Geeter believes, "green" and "envi
ronmentally friendly" are associated with "kind of shal
low objectives. That doesn't attack the problem deep
enough and it doesn't bring up the interconnectivity of
all these issues," he said.
So what is attacking the problem deep enough? For
Geeter and Luisi, of course, that would be an interdisci
plinary lab like Lotus One.
"We're going to make this happen and this is going to
shape the future development of Stanford campus and
make sure that we students have the ability to enact real
change in the world," Luisi said.
Cardona and Geeter said the proposal has been sent
to the faculty committee and Hennessy for approval,
and the students have not yet learned how their propos
als will proceed.

planners hope will serve as both a student residence and a building systems laboratory to further explore sustainable living.
