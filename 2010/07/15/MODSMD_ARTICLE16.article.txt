# Student leads excavation of Canadian POW camp
## Digging up World War II 
### CAITY MONROE STAFF WRITER 
World War II evokes images of
Hitler, Hiroshima and Auschwitz
thousands of German prisoners of
war (POWs) working in a Canadian
logging camp figure less prominent
ly in the popular imagination.
The history of these prisoners
and one such POW camp is current
ly being uncovered by a team of
researchers, led by Stanford Ph.D.
student and archeologist Adrian
Myers. Myers, researching for his
dissertation, has returned to
Manitoba's Riding Mountain
National Park this summer to exam
ine and understand the lives of cap
tured German soldiers sentenced to
camps in rural Canada.
Between 1943 and 1945, the
Whitewater Lake POW camp
housed an estimated 400 soldiers
from Germany's Afrika Korps, the
German expeditionary force that
was defeated by the Allies in the
Second Battle of El-Alamein in
Egypt. The Allies' victory in late
Oct. 1942 resulted in the transporta
tion of approximately 30,000
German POWs to Canada
including the 400 workers selected
and transferred to the camp's loca
tion in Riding Mountain National
Park.
In stark contrast to the more
notorious internment camps of the
Second World War, the conditions
at the Whitewater POW camp were
decent, according to Myers. The
captured soldiers worked on logging
projects that helped supply
Canadian homes with wood fuel,

and unlike most camps, they actual
ly volunteered to work at the
Manitoba site.
"In general, Canada was pretty
good. They treated the prisoners of
war pretty well," Myers said. "These
prisoners of war actually volun
teered to go to this camp where they
would be working, so they knew
what to expect: better conditions,
better food ... but they would be
working."
Today, little evidence of the life
that existed there 70 years ago is dis
cernible to an untrained eye. Much
of the site's contents were auctioned
off after the war in an effort to
obtain some much-needed money.
"When we got to the site in 2009,
what's left is not much if you don't
know what to look for," Myers said.
The most apparent remnants at
the camp are the concrete founda
tions for various buildings. Myers
and his team are using topographic
mapping to help them come up with
a more detailed picture of the camp
when it was in use in the 19405.
"When you're on the site walking
around, you see humps and bumps
but it's hard to make it out with a
naked eye," Myers said. "But with
the mapping we're using, we end up
with a 3-D layer of the topography
of the site."
In addition to the building foun
dations, the team of researches has
found smaller items, including bot
tles, jars, ceramics, tin cans and even
canoes, which were carved by the
prisoners in their spare time and
were meant to be used on one of the
nearby lakes.
The project has generated signif

icant attention from a variety of
sources, with press coverage in both
Archaeology Magazine and
National Geographic.
"[Myers] is one of the leaders in
what is called contemporary arche
ology" said Myers' Ph.D. advisor,
anthropology Professor Barbara
Voss. "He's really breaking new
ground in thinking about how arche
ology can contribute to events that
are still in living memory."
Simon Fraser University under
graduate Jerram Ritchie helped
Myers with the initial fieldwork in
2009 and returns as a field techni
cian with the expanded research
team this summer.
"You read about World War 11,
you don't really think about
German POWs being in national
parks doing lumber work in Canada,
so it seemed like a pretty unique
thing," Ritchie said. "When I was
given the opportunity, I didn't feel
like I had a choice."

This unique nature of the camp as
well as the historical importance of

that time period helps cultivate the
interest surrounding Myers' work.
Myers believes that there is more to
learn from the devastating war.
"The Second World War is one
of the single most significant events
in recent memory," he said. "The
outcome of the Second World War
has affected geopolitics around the
world."
Voss agreed that in addition to
World War IPs temporal immedia
cy, its ongoing relevance and moral
saliency provide compelling reasons
for the importance of this project.
"The phenomenon of Nazism
still strikes deep emotional currents,
and the specter of genocide has not
disappeared," she said. "I think
[Myers] is bringing attention to
aspects of World War II that many
people myself included were
not aware of. It gives us a more com
plex picture of what the home front
of the U.S. and Canada was like."
