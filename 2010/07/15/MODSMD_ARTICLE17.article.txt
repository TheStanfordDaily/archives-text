## Cardinal lures top recruit Vaunted linebacker Vaughters picks Stanford 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Jim Harbaugh's recruiting ethos can
be summarized in one phrase: the Forty-
Year Decision. The message is clear: in
stead of choosing a school solely for its
football program, pick your college based
also on the strength of the education (and
the degree) it provides. If high school ath
letes adhere to that mentality, then there
are few universities that can compete with
Stanford's total package.
That mantra has sparked a resurgence
in the Cardinal's recruiting prowess, and
it has landed perhaps Harbaugh's biggest
whale yet: linebacker James Vaughters
of Tucker High School in Tucker, Ga.
Vaughters, who committed to Stanford
on June 17, is a Rivals.com and
Scout.com four-star recruit who is
ranked as the No. 5 and No. 7 inside line
backer, respectively, in the Class of 2011.
Vaughters' offer list included nearly
every relevant football program of the
past decade according to analysis per
formed by Andy Drukarev of The Boot
leg, the last Cardinal player who received
comparable interest was Ekom Udofia in
2005.
But Vaughers ended his recruitment
relatively early in the process and com
mitted to Stanford, in large part because
of what he found when he looked beyond
the football field.

"One thing I realized is that Stanford,
out of all of the schools I was looking at,
has the great academic opportunities. I
feel like the people that are there are like
me," he said.
"When I talk about Stanford now, it's
harder for me to think about things as far
as football goes, as opposed to getting ex
cited about the lifestyle of the school," he
continued. "Which isn't to say that the
football program isn't something to be ex
cited about it is, I can't wait to play
there but there are so many things be
sides football that are going on out there.
I knew that if I got hurt, I'd want to be at
Stanford, and that's when I knew."
Vaughters reports a 4.0 GPA and
what is described as an "Ivy League-cal
iber SAT score." In other words, he's a
lock for admission the coaching staff
has told him as much although he's
constantly reworking his application es
says and may retake the SAT because he
"want[s] to make sure that it's right."
For such an academically inclined ath
lete he wants to major in architectural
design, a time-intensive program it
would be reasonable to assume that Stan
ford was always on his radar. But that was
hardly the case with Vaughters. Growing
up in the University of Georgia's back
yard and in the heart of SEC football
country, where the sport is akin to reli
gion, he initially had his eyes focused on
Florida and Alabama, the last two BCS
champions. It was not until his father,
Jonathan, encouraged him to look west
that he first considered the Cardinal. He
took one unofficial visit, then another. He
was hooked.
"Surprisingly, I loved it," he said.

"Once I got out there, it was a great expe
rience."
The trip changed his mindset, too.
"When you begin the process, you see
who is winning the championships every
year," he said. "You wonder why you
wouldn't want to go to a school that wins
championships consistently. But I want to
be part of something special. I want to be
part of a team that wins a national cham
pionship. I don't want to file in and be part
of a school that does that all the time."
It is safe to say, then, that it wasn't just
academics that drew him in ultimately,
the juxtaposition of a rising football pro
gram with the Division I Football Bowl
Subdivision's top academic program was
enough to woo Vaughters away from the
perennial powers. He is excited about de
fensive coordinator Vic Fangio's switch
to a 3-4 defense, which could allow
Vaughters, who currently plays inside, to
move to the outside.
"I want to play the outside linebacker
spot in the 3-4 defense so I can both drop
back against the pass and rush the quar
terback," he said. "Since I started playing
football, one of the things I've always
dreamed about is the ability to rush the
passer."
At nearly 6'3" and over 230 pounds,
Vaughters prides himself on his combina
tion of speed and strength. Scout.com's
Chad Simmons states that "he reads and
reacts quickly, he uses his hands well and
he plays a very smart game of football."

At 6'3" and over 230 pounds, Vaughters, above, could contribute
immensely to the Cardinal defense. The Tucker, Ga. native is
considered to be one of the top 10 linebackers in his class.
