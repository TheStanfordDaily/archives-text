# Summer is no time for rest
## 
### KEVIN ZHANG DAILY INTERN 
After finishing the 2009-10 Season
with a school record 36 wins and an
other Pac-10 Championship, one
might think the Cardinal women
could rest easy over the offseason.
After all, Stanford hasn't exactly had
trouble succeeding recently: under
current head coach Tara VanDerveer,
the team has reached the Final Four
nine times and competed in the na
tional title game four times, most re
cently coming just one win short of a
national championship before falling
to Connecticut.
Even though the season is still four
months away, however, the Cardinal
team isn't about to rest on its laurels.
Even though the team isn't re
quired to train on campus during the
summer, nine out of the 14 members
are, including forward Kayla Peder

sen, who will be a senior this year and
an instrumental leader of the team.
She's looking to build on a fantastic ju
nior season in which she averaged 15.8
points and 9.5 rebounds per game
(both second on the team).
"We have a great commitment
level and the amount of players here
really shows that," Pedersen said.
For those that remain on campus,
there's plenty of work to be done.
There are five morning practices a
week from 7:00-8:30. These early ses
sions mainly consist of lifting and
shooting with "the gun" (a machine
that sends balls to athletes to shoot).
When morning practices are complet
ed, the team members take classes and
then have pickup games at 5:30.
The team is looking to reload this
year after the departure of three se
niors: Jayne Appel, Rosalyn Gold-

Onwude and Michelle Harrison. The 12 re
turning members of the Cardinal, along with
their new additions, have many objectives dur
ing the offseason and see the summer as a
prime opportunity to develop the tools that will
help them succeed next season.
"During the summer we want to have the
dedication and commitment necessary to suc
ceed," Pedersen said. "We want to increase our
strength and quickness and get a higher verti
cal. Overall, we seek to have the physical edge
over our opponents."
The Cardinal, who needed just one more
half of solid play to slide past the champion
Huskies last season, is looking to make the final
push.
"We realize that we are so close and we just
need a little more to win [a national title]," Ped

ersen said.
The team also welcomes the addition of
three freshmen: Sara James, Toni Kokenis and
Gatorade Player of the Year Chiney Ogwu
mike. A native of Cypress, Texas, Ogwumike
was rated the nation's top recruit in the Class of
2010. Ogwumike has accomplished extraordi
nary feats already this summer, leading the
United States Under-18 National Team to a
gold medal and a 5-0 record at the 2010 FIBA
Americas UlB Championship.
Although rookie hazing is common in many
institutions, the Cardinal veterans try to ensure
a warm welcome for their new additions.
"We treat the freshmen like normal, inviting
them to our team activities. There's no awk
wardness," Pedersen said.
Looking forward to the 2010-2011 season,
the prospects for the Cardinal are encouraging.
The only team that defeated the Cardinal last
season, the UConn Huskies, will be losing two
significant players in guard Kalana Greene and
center Tina Charles. In addition, the Cardinal
will now feature the "Sister Show" in freshmen

Chiney Ogwumike and her sister Nnemkadi, a
junior. Nnemkadi, one of the premier forwards
in the nation, looks to continue her role as a
strong presence down low after averaging a
team-high 18.5 points and 9.9 rebounds per
game.
Although the loss of Appel, Gold-Onwude
and Harrison two of whom were starters
will be tough, the team still boasts many
promising players. Out of the 12 returning play
ers, the Cardinal will have a strong backcourt
presence to complement a dominant offense.
Some players to watch for include senior guard
Jeanette Pohlen, who averaged nearly 10
points per game, led the team by averaging 4.5
assists per game and will contribute with her
ability to lead and to protect the ball. Pohlen
will be accompanied by promising young star
Joslyn Tinkle, who as a freshman already has a
few starts under her belt and averaged 4.6
points per game.
