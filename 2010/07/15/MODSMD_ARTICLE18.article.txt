# Summer is no time for rest
## 
### KEVIN ZHANG DAILY INTERN 
After finishing the 2009-10 Season
with a school record 36 wins and an
other Pac-10 Championship, one
might think the Cardinal women
could rest easy over the offseason.
After all, Stanford hasn't exactly had
trouble succeeding recently: under
current head coach Tara VanDerveer,
the team has reached the Final Four
nine times and competed in the na
tional title game four times, most re
cently coming just one win short of a
national championship before falling
to Connecticut.
Even though the season is still four
months away, however, the Cardinal
team isn't about to rest on its laurels.
Even though the team isn't re
quired to train on campus during the
summer, nine out of the 14 members
are, including forward Kayla Peder

sen, who will be a senior this year and
an instrumental leader of the team.
She's looking to build on a fantastic ju
nior season in which she averaged 15.8
points and 9.5 rebounds per game
(both second on the team).
"We have a great commitment
level and the amount of players here
really shows that," Pedersen said.
For those that remain on campus,
there's plenty of work to be done.
There are five morning practices a
week from 7:00-8:30. These early ses
sions mainly consist of lifting and
shooting with "the gun" (a machine
that sends balls to athletes to shoot).
When morning practices are complet
ed, the team members take classes and
then have pickup games at 5:30.
The team is looking to reload this
year after the departure of three se
niors: Jayne Appel, Rosalyn Gold-

As a senior next year, Kayla Pedersen, above, looks to continue her solid offensive contributions in hopes of leading the
Cardinal to a badly desired national title. The power forward is on campus this summer to train for next season.
