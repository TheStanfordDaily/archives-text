# Cup reflections: Spain, sealife, surprises
## 
### TOM TAYLOR 
With a single goal in extra time,
Spain defeated the Nether
lands to lift the World Cup and
become only the eighth coun
try to do so in the eponymous
tournament's 80-year history.
Deserving winners? Yes, unquestionably.
Spain may have been the lowest-scoring team
ever to win the tournament, but at times showed
immense ability. Against Germany their tiki
taka style of quick but accurate passing allowed
them to dominate possession and neutralize the
most dangerous offense in South Africa. The
final might not have lived up to expectations,
with Spain failing to show the same sort of pass
ing fluency, but this can be explained by the ag
gressive approach of the Dutch.
Referee Howard Webb set a record when he
handed out nine yellow cards to the Netherlands
and five to Spain, but it could and probably
should have been many more. Several tackles
by the Dutch will have left the Spanish players
feeling more than a little bruised the morning
after, and it was hollow justice when Johnny
Heitinga was eventually sent off in extra time.
Mark van Bommel should have been given a
second yellow card for several bad tackles in the
first half, and Nigel de Jong's studs-up karate
style kick into the chest of Xabi Alonso deserved
nothing less than a straight red card. Whether or
not de Jong had malicious intent in his "high
tackle," it was an extraordinarily dangerous and
stupid thing to do. He could well have broken
Alonso's ribs and left his own team a man short
for the bulk of the game.
Just surviving the Dutch assault is reason
enough for Spain to feel proud. But even with
such talent, the eventual winners emerged with a
far from untarnished record.
Spain became the first team to lose its open
ing game but still win the tournament. Though I
doubt many on the streets of Madrid and
Barcelona even care right now, just a month ago
serious doubts were being raised that the Span
ish would even reach the knockout round after
Switzerland's shocking 1-0 victory.
There are, however, two entities that finished
this tournament with their reputations un
scathed: one sea creature and one small island
nation.
Paul the Psychic Octopus became a world
wide celebrity by predicting the results of Ger
many's matches (and the final) from his tank in
Oberhausen. Before each game he would be of
fered two boxes, each containing a mussel or an
oyster for him to eat and marked with the flags of
the two opposing teams. He would choose the
winning side by opening the appropriate box and
eating the food inside.
It's not the first time Paul has been called in to
offer his thoughts on the German team he
was consulted for the Euro 2008 tournament
but the first time he got the results 100 percent
right.
In a World Cup that seemed to defy predic
tion, eight correct results in eight games seems a
pretty impressive feat. After Germany de
stroyed Australia in the first game, few apart
from one brave invertebrate predicted a loss
to Serbia.
But the odds of picking just a handful of re
sults correctly aren't exactly staggering: 1/256.
Though I'd love to imagine ire has some kind of
psychic powers or even the ability to influence
the results, the cold-hearted scientist in me just
doesn't buy it. After all, Paul would never have
wanted Germany to do so well; he
was hatched in Weymouth he's
English.
In comparison to predicting the
outcome of a few games. New
Zealand had a lot more stacked
against it. The land of the long white
cloud is not known for its football,
with its cricket and especially rugby
teams making the biggest waves on
the international stage.
Its much larger neighbor, Aus
tralia, was the biggest fish in the
Oceania Football Confederation
(OFC) until it jumped ship in 2006 to
seek the challenge of playing in Asia.
This opened a path for the Kiwis, and
victory over fifth-place Asian team
Bahrain qualified them for only their
second-ever World Cup.
Only hosts South Africa and the
Democratic People's Republic of
Korea were ranked lower than No. 78
New Zealand, and while Group F
might not have been a typical "Group
of Death," it did include then-reign
ing champion Italy. No one expected

the All Whites to get out of the group
stage, and they didn't.
But at the same time, no one expect
ed the Kiwis to finish ahead of Italy,
yet they did.
A team with nine players from
clubs in New Zealand and two with
out clubs entirely left its mark by
scoring first against a team picked
from the ranks of the Italian super
powers. It entered the final group
game with a realistic chance of quali
fying for the knockout stage, and
while that ultimately did not happen,
the Kiwis probably found a few new
fans along the way.
They may not have dazzled us
with skill, but they stayed together
and never gave up in a performance
made all the more admirable by the
antics of global superstars like the
French, who petulantly imploded as
the world's media watched on.
And Stanford can be proud of this.
Proud that its first ever representation
at a World Cup, All Whites players
Simon Elliot '99 and Ryan Nelsen 'Ol,
left with heads held high, undefeated.
