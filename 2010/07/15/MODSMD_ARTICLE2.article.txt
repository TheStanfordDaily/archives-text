## Chris Chan M.S. '08 dies Friends, family and academic advisers recount memories of doctored student 
### ERIC MESSINGER SUMMER MANAGING EDITOR 
Christina "Chris" Chan M.S. 'OB, a doctoral stu
dent in political science at Stanford, died in a climb
ing accident at Yosemite National Park on Friday.
She was 33.
The accident occurred while Chan was undertak
ing a free-solo climb, nearby Jim Castelaz 'OB, who
witnessed her fall several hundred feet. Chan, Caste
laz and two other students had intended to climb
Mount Russell on Saturday.
In e-mails to The Daily, friends, family and acade
mic advisers mourning Chan's death described her as
a young woman of modesty and humanity who also
possessed an uncommon drive and dedication in pur
suit of new endeavors.
"I mostly saw the academic side," said her adviser
Jean Oi, a professor of Chinese politics, "but her con
cern and generosity toward others always came
through. She always had a great smile and was a per
son who put others first. She was also modest, some
times overly so, about her many talents."
Those talents were prodigious, befitting her status,
as Oi put it, of a "rising academic talent." Prior to her
death, Chan had spent a decade and a half pursuing a
variety of interests in higher education, unified by her
willingness to try new things and a consistent ability
to succeed at any new venture.
Chan attended Harvard University as an under
graduate, finishing in three years, cum laude, with a
degree in biochemical sciences. She worked in invest
ment banking after graduation before moving to San
Diego in 2002. There, she took up a course of study in
international relations at UC-San Diego, earning a
master's in 2005. She subsequently traveled to Stan
ford, where she earned a master's in civil and environ
mental engineering in 2008 and went on to pursue
doctoral work in political science. She also spent time
working in the environmental policy sector.
By June, Chan had completed an intensive Chi
nese language program in Beijing, capping off her lat
est academic pursuit. According to Oi, Chan had fin
ished all of her course work, and was ready to begin
her dissertation, with the subject of "Enterprise Own

ership and the Adoption of Environmental Tech
nologies in China." Oi said that the project required a
rare mix of abilities.
"This is a difficult subject that required not only
deep knowledge about China's political economy,
but also substantial technical background," Oi said.
"Chris was the ideal student to take on this challenge
she is one of the few who had the science and tech
nical knowledge."
"Chris had tremendous academic talent and I
think she would have done an outstanding disserta
tion," she added.
Chan also brought a similar dedication outside the
classroom, including in her athletic pursuits. Accord
ing to her brother Peter, Chan developed her passion
for climbing around the time she moved to San
Diego.
While at Stanford, Castelaz said Chan was a "pro
lific climber," and she twice served as the president of
the Stanford Alpine Club. Both Peter Chan and
Castelaz ascribed part of her motivation for continu
ing to study at Stanford to a desire to stay close to Cal
ifornia climbing destinations.
"I think one reason she wanted to go to graduate
school was to have the summers off to climb," Caste
laz said.

Chan had pursued climbing with
her characteristic intensity.
"She probably did more climbs
in her time than most climbers do in
their lifetime," Castelaz said.
Castelaz was adamant that Chan
pursued climbing with full knowl
edge of its inherent risks.
"Climbing is always dangerous
any time you do that you're tak
ing a risk," he said. "Chris knew
those dangers as well as anyone."
"Chris would not apologize for
climbing, even now. She knew the
risks, like all other climbers," he
added.
Castelaz felt that Chan's death
came while doing what she was pas
sionate about, and had loved to do.
"The first half of the day was re
ally special, and I'm happy for
that," he said.
Peter Chan said that his sister's
interest in climbing was in keeping
with her personality.
"Christina was always fearless,
never afraid to try new things," he
said. "She always pushed herself
and held herself to a very high stan
dard, insisting on and succeed
ing in, more than she gave herself
credit for excelling in everything
she did. She was also extremely
humble, never resting on her lau
rels and always trying to figure out
how to do things better."
Barbara Walter, Chan's advisor

and mentor while she was a mas
ter's student at UC-San Diego, kept
in touch with Chan after she left the
university, and said that her drive to
pursue new interests had remained
with her until the end.
"I knew her interest was shifting
away from political science â€”to
what I'm not 100 percent sure,"
Walter said. "I also knew that she
was becoming increasingly involved
and passionate about climbing, al
though I did not know to what ex
tent. In retrospect, I don't think she
was going to make her career in po
litical science, and that was fine with
me. Whatever made her happy."
Chan's brother Peter also felt
that she contributed in many ways.
"She was honest and very direct,
never afraid to let you know what
she thought," he said. "Most of all,
she was an incredibly kind and gen
erous person, always willing to help
others, to share her experience or
belongings and to try to make the
world a better place."
One modest measure of the im
pact Chan had on those who knew
her is reflected in a memorial Face
book page, with almost 600 mem
bers. Friends and family have gath
ered there to post their remem
brances of Chan. A full memorial
service for Chan is scheduled for
Sunday, July 18 at 1 p.m. at Memo
rial Church, according to the page's
organizers.
