## Chris Chan M.S. '08 dies Friends, family and academic advisers recount memories of doctored student 
### ERIC MESSINGER SUMMER MANAGING EDITOR 
Christina "Chris" Chan M.S. 'OB, a doctoral stu
dent in political science at Stanford, died in a climb
ing accident at Yosemite National Park on Friday.
She was 33.
The accident occurred while Chan was undertak
ing a free-solo climb, nearby Jim Castelaz 'OB, who
witnessed her fall several hundred feet. Chan, Caste
laz and two other students had intended to climb
Mount Russell on Saturday.
In e-mails to The Daily, friends, family and acade
mic advisers mourning Chan's death described her as
a young woman of modesty and humanity who also
possessed an uncommon drive and dedication in pur
suit of new endeavors.
"I mostly saw the academic side," said her adviser
Jean Oi, a professor of Chinese politics, "but her con
cern and generosity toward others always came
through. She always had a great smile and was a per
son who put others first. She was also modest, some
times overly so, about her many talents."
Those talents were prodigious, befitting her status,
as Oi put it, of a "rising academic talent." Prior to her
death, Chan had spent a decade and a half pursuing a
variety of interests in higher education, unified by her
willingness to try new things and a consistent ability
to succeed at any new venture.
Chan attended Harvard University as an under
graduate, finishing in three years, cum laude, with a
degree in biochemical sciences. She worked in invest
ment banking after graduation before moving to San
Diego in 2002. There, she took up a course of study in
international relations at UC-San Diego, earning a
master's in 2005. She subsequently traveled to Stan
ford, where she earned a master's in civil and environ
mental engineering in 2008 and went on to pursue
doctoral work in political science. She also spent time
working in the environmental policy sector.
By June, Chan had completed an intensive Chi
nese language program in Beijing, capping off her lat
est academic pursuit. According to Oi, Chan had fin
ished all of her course work, and was ready to begin
her dissertation, with the subject of "Enterprise Own

ership and the Adoption of Environmental Tech
nologies in China." Oi said that the project required a
rare mix of abilities.
"This is a difficult subject that required not only
deep knowledge about China's political economy,
but also substantial technical background," Oi said.
"Chris was the ideal student to take on this challenge
she is one of the few who had the science and tech
nical knowledge."
"Chris had tremendous academic talent and I
think she would have done an outstanding disserta
tion," she added.
Chan also brought a similar dedication outside the
classroom, including in her athletic pursuits. Accord
ing to her brother Peter, Chan developed her passion
for climbing around the time she moved to San
Diego.
While at Stanford, Castelaz said Chan was a "pro
lific climber," and she twice served as the president of
the Stanford Alpine Club. Both Peter Chan and
Castelaz ascribed part of her motivation for continu
ing to study at Stanford to a desire to stay close to Cal
ifornia climbing destinations.
"I think one reason she wanted to go to graduate
school was to have the summers off to climb," Caste
laz said.
