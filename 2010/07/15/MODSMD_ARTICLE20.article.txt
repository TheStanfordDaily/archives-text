## Luck wants to earn degree before entering draft 
### 
Last week, the worst fears of many a
Stanford football fan were eased, as quar
terback Andrew Luck told Bay Area radio
station KNBR that he'd like to complete
his college degree before moving on to the
NFL.
"I still consider myself a pretty young
guy," the redshirt sophomore said on
KNBR. "I need to get a degree in college
before I start thinking about that stuff. I
will probably stay in school for sure."
Many had been expecting Luck, one of
the top prospects in college football, to de
clare for the 2011 NFL Draft after the
coming season. Luck still has the choice of
entering the 2012 NFL Draft, after he re
ceives his undergraduate degree, or stay
ing for his fourth year of eligibility and en
tering the draft in 2013.
In 2009, Luck started all 12 regular-sea
son games for the Cardinal, throwing for
2,575 yards and 13 touchdowns while post
ing a completion percentage of 56.2 and
rushing for 354 yards. He missed the Sun
Bowl after breaking a finger in the final
game of the regular season against Notre
Dame.
Expectations are high for Luck going
into the 2010 season. On July 13, Luck was
the first player to be named to the Man
ning Award Watch List. The award is
given annually to the nation's top college
quarterback; last year's winner was Colt
McCoy from the University of Texas. The
list includes 30 of the nation's top quarter
backs and will be released over the course
of the coming month.
This past weekend, Luck attended the
Manning Passing Academy at Nicholls
State in Louisiana. The camp, run by
Archie, Peyton, Eli and Cooper Manning,
features some of the nation's top high
school and college quarterbacks each year.
"Andrew can make all the throws nec
essary to be a really top-flight quarterback
in college and in the pros," Archie Man
ning said to sports columnist Mike Detilli
er. "I was extremely impressed with him.
Andrew came here to the camp as a high
school quarterback about four or five
years ago and you can see he is much
stronger, and he has a chance to be a real
special football player."
"I fully understand at this level that you
are constantly learning and trying to get
better at your craft," Luck told Detillier. "I
have worked hard all offseason in improv
ing my footwork and follow through. It's
the mechanical work of the game, but it is
so important."
