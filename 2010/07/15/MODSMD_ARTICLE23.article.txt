# Recent Lebron James hype is just too much
## 
### JOSEPH BEYDA 
Only a king could stir up as much
publicity as Leßron James has in
the past few weeks. The possibility
of "King James" leaving his home
town Cleveland Cavaliers to join
another basketball team created a swarm of crit
icisms, analyses and predictions. For the first
time, the term "Salary Cap Analyst" became a
household one, as sports shows pulled in experts
to play the daily guessing game as to where Le-
Bron would end up. The entire country seemed
to be engrossed in a mess that really only in
volved five or six teams. And according to The
Nielson Company, Leßron's own hour-long "de
cision special" on ESPN drew the attention of
9.95 million people.
That's over a third of the people that watched
Game 7 of the NBA finals. That's one in 30 Amer
icans. That's enough to fill Miami's American Air
lines Arena, where Lebron will be playing next
year, 500 times over.
It's disturbing that the sporting world has
bought into this free agency hype so heavily. The
morning of Lebron's decision, ESPN's Sports-
Center spent the bulk of the show discussing bas
ketball that was three months away, skipping cov
erage of tight MLB pennant races and barely
mentioning the approaching World Cup final.
There were no highlights to be found of the San
Francisco Giants' notable 15-2 rout of the Mil
waukee Brewers the day before; instead, more
predictions, more guesses all about Leßron.
Since when have contract negotiations been
made into hot-button issues, with actual sports
moved to the back burner?
It could be due to the role that social media,
such as Twitter and texting, have begun to play.
Simple updates by players can blow up into some
thing much more; a casual remark about why one
team would be a good fit can be misinterpreted by
the sporting world to be a decisive statement. And
when there are new tweets and texts every day,
there's always something for Sports Center to talk
about.
Regardless of why there's so much focus on
free agency, one thing's for sure: the whole deba
cle has serious consequences. For one, when a
number of teams are interested in a high-profile
free agent, there will be more people left disap
pointed than satisfied. That's unavoidable, but
bring fans and irresponsible hype into the mix
