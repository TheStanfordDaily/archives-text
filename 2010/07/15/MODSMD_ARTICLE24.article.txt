## REMOTE NOMAD: SUMMER TV SUMMARY 
### â€” liz STARK 
Remember the days of summer reading? I can't. My
ability to plow through hundreds of pages of
Dickens has been displaced, temporarily I hope, by
the spell of Netflix instant streaming. Though Hulu
has finally implemented its "members only" club for
$lO a month, I have succeeded in filling my summer with enough
television to qualify me as a statistic in an obesity study. So, thank
you for taking some time away from moving pictures for my own

written words, even if my words steer you straight back to the
television.
The summer television season is still young and ripe "Mad
Men" returns July 25, "Weeds" August 16 and "Dexter" has techni
cally become a fall show with its September 26 premiere date. The
current offerings have been largely underwhelming. All I can say is,
I never thought I'd appreciate sports this much. Here's a breakdown
of the shows I've been watching, for better or worse:

"True Blood"
(HBO, Sundays at 9)
Previously, "True Blood" had showcased
all the best parts about paid cable: artistic
nudity and gore, high quality production,
stellar acting and a quality akin to crack.
Unfortunately, the third season has con
firmed that too much of anything is a bad
thing, even in the world of paid cable bud
gets. There are too many plot lines, too
many important characters and too many
scenes per episode. I find myself wondering
when it will end (the lack of commercials
makes it difficult to pace). The only charac
ters who can still sustain my interest are
Lafayette, Eric and Jessica; if you watched
season two, that combination might sound
reasonable, but this season their screen time
has dwindled in favor of werewolves and
vampire monarchy. It's unclear whether I'll
be able to stay loyal for the entire season.

"Top Chef: DC" (Bravo,
Wednesdays at 9)
It's still early in the game over at Bravo's
reality competition jewel, "Top Chef." The
creative team behind the challenges has
indulged in every DC stereotype possible,
but I suppose I shouldn't fault them for that
since DC is hardly a restaurant town a la
New York or Los Angeles. The contestants
are still in the pack mentality and have
failed to distinguish themselves, though the
show is playing up the ethnic diversity this
season. The ethics of casting Angelo, who

runs a Michelin-star restaurant, are dubious
at best, so I look forward to the episodes
with fewer contestants and more interper
sonal drama. The proudly-touted addition
of Eric Ripert to the judges' table has yet to
register its full impact on the show, as Ripert
has only judged two challenges thus far.

"The Hard Times of RJ
Berger"
(MTV, Mondays at 10)

MTV ventures
into the world of
scripted television
and finds success in
30-minute comedy.
This brainchild of
David Katzenberg
(Nicky Hilton's boy
friend) reinvents the
often cliched genre
of high school televi
sion with not only
the protagonist's
large penis but also
refreshing interpre
tations of familiar
setups, such as the
school musical and a
cougar employer.

"Hung"
(HBO, Sundays at 10:30)
In this show's premiere season, I found
myself waiting to be rewarded for my invest
ment in the half-hour comedy about a
Detroit gym teacher turned male prostitute.
Two episodes into the second season, I'm
still waiting. The soapy seductive potential
of prostitution is drowned out by the writ
ers' preoccupation with family life and the
economic fall of Detroit. This concept was
certainly timely last year, but, as the market
rebounds, the ambivalence of Ray, the pros
titute in question, toward his clients, his
morality and his money has begun to bore
me.

"Pretty Little Liars"
(ABC Family, Tuesdays at 8)
THIS is the breakout hit of the summer.
ABC Family is like "Sesame Street": it
knows its target market (young teens for the
former, toddlers for the latter) but always
winks at its older audience (see also "The
Secret Life of the American Teenager").

Based off of trashy young adult novels by
Sara Shepard, the series investigates the
murder of the high school queen bee, whose
four best friends are left to hide what they
know. This plot is nowhere near as interest
ing as the idiosyncrasies of these four girls:
Aria is "dating" her English teacher; Hanna
has eating, shoplifting and parent issues,
plus her boyfriend is the preacher's son;
Spencer comes from a family of overachiev
ers, with a cruelly perfect older sister whose
fiance Spencer kissed; and Emily is dabbling
in lesbianism. This level of brilliance surely
can't be sustained forever, so I'm taking it in
while I still can.

That's all for now! Unclear when you'll
hear from me next, unless you're my neigh
bor and you hear me chastising my friends
to shut the heck up during the "Mad Men"
premiere or the "Pretty Little Liars" theme
song.
