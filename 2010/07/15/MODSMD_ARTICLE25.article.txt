transformed SLAC from a single-pur
pose particle research station to a
multi-faceted laboratory that excelled
in photon science, particle physics, as
trophysics and accelerator science. He
also strengthened SLAC's association
with the University, developing joint
SLAC-Stanford institutes.
Dorfan said that he would use his
experiences at SLAC to help him at
OIST, where part of his job descrip

I was responsible for a laboratory that
is home to researchers from more than

25 nations worldwide."
Along with these tasks, Dorfan will
also focus on recruiting additional fac

riculum and broadening research
horizons. Despite the rigor of his new
job, Dorfan stated that he was excited
and optimistic about his new job.
"I look forward to the opportunity
to be part of establishing a new inter
national research university that will
combine outstanding talent [from]
around the world in an environment
that is optimized for unrestricted, cu
riosity-driven research," he said.
President John Hennessy praised
Dorfan in a press release.
"Jonathan Dorfan is an excellent
choice to lead the new Okinawa Insti
tute of Science and Technology Grad
uate University," Hennessy said. "As
a physicist and as SLAC's third direc
tor, he demonstrated leadership and
vision, attracting great scientists and
inspiring them to work collaboratively
to advance our knowledge in this new
century. Beyond Stanford's borders,
he has been an outstanding statesman
for science."
