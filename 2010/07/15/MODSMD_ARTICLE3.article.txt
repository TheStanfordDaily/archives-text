## Board of Trustees elects new members for five-year terms 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Joseph Beyda 
Five people were added to the Uni
versity's Board of Trustees this month to
replace six outgoing members.
Trustees are elected to serve a five
year term and can be reelected for a sec
ond term, though they must wait one
year before running again for a third. The
board meets five times a year to deal with
funds, the University budget and Univer
sity policies.
The new crop of trustees is as presti
gious as it is diverse. Two CEOs will join
the board: Frank Lee Ph.D. '77, CEO of
biotech corporation Dragonfly Sciences,
and Paul Ormond '7l, M.B.A. '73, presi
dent and CEO of medical rehabilitation
provider HRC Manor Care. The group
also includes entrepreneur Kavitark
Shriram, founder of the venture capital
firm Sherpalo Ventures LLC, Armando
Garza-Sada M.B.A. 'Bl, chairman of the
Mexican company Alfa, and Deborah
Zoullas M.B.A. '7B, a private investor.
The board will, for the most part, re
tain its prior composition despite these
changes; trustees involved in business,
health care and investment were present
in both the incoming and outgoing
groups. Notable, however, is the depar
ture of two lawyers; although none of the
new trustees practice law, UC-Berkeley
law professor and associate dean Good
win Liu '9l will remain on the board.
Prominent returning members in
clude University President John Hen
nessy and Yahoo! founder Jerry Yang
'9O, M.S. '9O. With more outgoing
trustees than incoming members this
year, the board will shrink from 31 mem
bers to 30.
Leslie Hume, chairwoman of the
Board of Trustees, could not be reached
for comment.
