# STUDENT LIFE
## Student proposes streetcar plan 
### JANE LEPHAM NEWS EDITOR 
A downtown streetcar line could be the key
to getting the city of Oakland back on its feet,
says Daniel Jacobson 'l2, a Stanford undergrad
who authored a study to revitalize the city's
struggling economy.
Jacobson, an East Bay native, spent his
sophomore year conducting independent re
search in urban studies, and has produced a de
tailed plan to breathe life back into downtown
Oakland. His proposal entails building a 2.5-
mile streetcar line that runs through the heart of
the city, connecting Piedmont and Upper
Broadway to Jack London Square an initia
tive that could add over 20,000 new residents
and create 20,000 new jobs in the downtown

area.
"This would translate to as much as $BOO mil
lion in annual sales, bringing $5 million in annu
al sales tax revenue all of this is just within
three blocks of the line," Jacobson said.
While the proposal links the newly redevel
oped areas of uptown Oakland to the city's wa
terfront, Jacobson indicates that the real hub of
the project lies in the downtown area, where the
two BART stations are located.
"They're really trying to revitalize the area,
which is soon going to be the home of the Jack
London market," he said, adding that the addi
tion of a "dining and entertainment area" and
the potential relocation of the Oakland A's sta
dium to the area could provide a boost to one of

the most economically depressed re
gions of the city.
While his proposal has received
public support from many quarters
since its publication last month, Jacob
son was quick to note that his project
sought to improve on a similar study
done by the city of Oakland from 2003
to 2005.
"The 2003-2005 study was based on
a similar concept, but it had a number of
shortcomings and didn't really hit on
the number of points to best utilize
street cars to boost economic develop
ment," he said, explaining that the study
looked at streetcars solely as a mode of
transportation.
Jacobson conducted his research on
a $987 grant from the Vice Provost for
Undergraduate Education. According
to Fred Stout, a professor in urban stud
ies, Jacobson's project distinguished it
self through its focus.
"What makes Daniel's project dif
ferent was that he really did his research
and really studied Oakland's core is
sues," Stout said.
Chris Miley, administrative director
for Oakland at-large Councilwoman
Rebecca Kaplan's office, emphasized
that Jacobson's study laid the ground
work for a potential streetcar system
and improved upon past studies by
"looking at the whole picture."
"Daniel took a good approach at
looking at streetcars in not only a trans
portation perspective, but from the eco
nomic impact it could have," Miley said.
"He proposes something that has a
transportation function, but can also

help spur economic development in the
Broadway Corridor it hits into a lot
of the issues Oakland is dealing with."
Jacobson explained that his inspira
tion for this independent study arose
last summer, when controversy unfold
ed over the proposal for an Oakland air
port connector, which would have
linked the BART station to the Oak
land Airport.
Citing the $6 cost per fare of the pro
posed connector, low potential for eco
nomic development and uneven so
cioeconomic benefits, Jacobson said
that he began to think about a project
that could benefit Oakland as a whole
including what the city could do to
reduce its emissions and increase its
economic development.
"The more and more I thought
about it I grew up around Oakland
and have a lot of experience with the
area the idea of using street cars as a
transportation method just made
sense," Jacobson said.
"In the climate of last summer, I fig
ured that going to Stanford, I had a net
work to build off of to give the city the
kind of study it should have had in the
first place," he added. "And things
slowly started to come together."
At a cost of $B7 to $92 million, Jacob
son's plan would, in theory, create ap
proximately 37,000 construction jobs
over a 15-year period and reduce CO2
emissions by roughly 100,000 tons per
year, which translates to a reduction of
4.9 to 5.7 million gallons of gasoline
saved annually. The study based its cal
culations off of similar streetcar projects
in Portland, Ore. and Seattle.
Citing the Bay Area's congested in
frastructure and issues like the state's
water crisis, health care, gasoline depen
dency and climate change, Jacobson ar
gued that a streetcar system and migra
tion out of the Central Valley could cre
ate a more sustainable Bay Area.
"If you compare a suburban sprawl
home in the Central Valley to a nice
apartment or condo in the
Oakland/SF/Berkeley area, the oil con
sumption and CO2 emissions would be
half about what they would be in the
suburbs," he said. "The best thing we
can do is to have a more sustainable Bay
Area, and this is a right step."
The next step in creating a streetcar
line for Oakland involves a series of fea
sibility studies.
"Daniel did his project almost as a
gift to the city," Miley said, "and where
the city is, is we're moving forward to try
to line up the funding to do a lot of stud
ies that need to happen. There's an en
vironmental study and an alternative
analysis that needs to be done before we
get to the point where we can put a

shovel in the ground... We also need
funding, whether it's a private fund or a
federal grant, and we're several years
away from that now."
This summer, however, the city of
Oakland plans to run a new, free shuttle
that follows the same alignment out
lined in Jacobson's proposal. The
Broadway Shuttle will link Jack Lon
don Square to 21st and Broadway, and
provide much of the numberical data
needed for the feasibility study, accord
ing to Miley.
"I think if Oakland takes this on and
gets some strong leadership, there's
nothing stopping them from having a
streetcar system in around 15 years," Ja
cobson said. "The momentum, the in
terest and the need is there, and it's a
matter of the city's officials really push
ing for it."
One of the new features about this
project is that the construction for this
project spans two blocks in two weeks,
runs in fixed traffic and will not con
sume too many parking spaces, accord
ing to Jacobson, who has also devised
means to fund the project.
"The design is fairly simple, and the
next part is the funding section con
struction and operations where we
ask, what different funding sources can
be put together without breaking Oak
land's budget?" Jacobson said.
"There's also an interest in federal
funding for this project, but the funding
scenarios I've come up with are mostly
privately driven, and when people ask if
Oakland can fund it, the answer is very
much yes."
The impact of this proposal could be
huge for the city of Oakland, according
to Stout.
"Urban planning bureaucracies
tend to be very heavily laden and im
penetrable, so [having student projects
picked up] hardly ever happens," Stout
said. "But the importance of it being a
Stanford student and a citizen in gener
al is essential to our democracy. It
shows that there are people out there
who are willing to come up with ideas to
be considered."
"At Stanford, we have a great tradi
tion of community service , and this is an
example of community service at its
highest form," he added. "It's outstand
ing."

A downtown streetcar line could be the key
to getting the city of Oakland back on its feet,
says Daniel Jacobson 'l2, a Stanford undergrad
who authored a study to revitalize the city's
struggling economy.
Jacobson, an East Bay native, spent his
sophomore year conducting independent re
search in urban studies, and has produced a de
tailed plan to breathe life back into downtown
Oakland. His proposal entails building a 2.5-
mile streetcar line that runs through the heart of
the city, connecting Piedmont and Upper
Broadway to Jack London Square an initia
tive that could add over 20,000 new residents
and create 20,000 new jobs in the downtown

area.
"This would translate to as much as $BOO mil
lion in annual sales, bringing $5 million in annu
al sales tax revenue all of this is just within
three blocks of the line," Jacobson said.
While the proposal links the newly redevel
oped areas of uptown Oakland to the city's wa
terfront, Jacobson indicates that the real hub of
the project lies in the downtown area, where the
two BART stations are located.
"They're really trying to revitalize the area,
which is soon going to be the home of the Jack
London market," he said, adding that the addi
tion of a "dining and entertainment area" and
the potential relocation of the Oakland A's sta
dium to the area could provide a boost to one of

the most economically depressed re
gions of the city.
While his proposal has received
public support from many quarters
since its publication last month, Jacob
son was quick to note that his project
sought to improve on a similar study
done by the city of Oakland from 2003
to 2005.
"The 2003-2005 study was based on
a similar concept, but it had a number of
shortcomings and didn't really hit on
the number of points to best utilize
street cars to boost economic develop
ment," he said, explaining that the study
looked at streetcars solely as a mode of
transportation.
Jacobson conducted his research on
a $987 grant from the Vice Provost for
Undergraduate Education. According
to Fred Stout, a professor in urban stud
ies, Jacobson's project distinguished it
self through its focus.
"What makes Daniel's project dif
ferent was that he really did his research
and really studied Oakland's core is
sues," Stout said.
Chris Miley, administrative director
for Oakland at-large Councilwoman
Rebecca Kaplan's office, emphasized
that Jacobson's study laid the ground
work for a potential streetcar system
and improved upon past studies by
"looking at the whole picture."
"Daniel took a good approach at
looking at streetcars in not only a trans
portation perspective, but from the eco
nomic impact it could have," Miley said.
"He proposes something that has a
transportation function, but can also

help spur economic development in the
Broadway Corridor it hits into a lot
of the issues Oakland is dealing with."
Jacobson explained that his inspira
tion for this independent study arose
last summer, when controversy unfold
ed over the proposal for an Oakland air
port connector, which would have
linked the BART station to the Oak
land Airport.
Citing the $6 cost per fare of the pro
posed connector, low potential for eco
nomic development and uneven so
cioeconomic benefits, Jacobson said
that he began to think about a project
that could benefit Oakland as a whole
including what the city could do to
reduce its emissions and increase its
economic development.
"The more and more I thought
about it I grew up around Oakland
and have a lot of experience with the
area the idea of using street cars as a
transportation method just made
sense," Jacobson said.
"In the climate of last summer, I fig
ured that going to Stanford, I had a net
work to build off of to give the city the
kind of study it should have had in the
first place," he added. "And things
slowly started to come together."
At a cost of $B7 to $92 million, Jacob
son's plan would, in theory, create ap
proximately 37,000 construction jobs
over a 15-year period and reduce CO2
emissions by roughly 100,000 tons per
year, which translates to a reduction of
4.9 to 5.7 million gallons of gasoline
saved annually. The study based its cal
culations off of similar streetcar projects
in Portland, Ore. and Seattle.
Citing the Bay Area's congested in
frastructure and issues like the state's
water crisis, health care, gasoline depen
dency and climate change, Jacobson ar
gued that a streetcar system and migra
tion out of the Central Valley could cre
ate a more sustainable Bay Area.
"If you compare a suburban sprawl
home in the Central Valley to a nice
apartment or condo in the
Oakland/SF/Berkeley area, the oil con
sumption and CO2 emissions would be
half about what they would be in the
suburbs," he said. "The best thing we
can do is to have a more sustainable Bay
Area, and this is a right step."
The next step in creating a streetcar
line for Oakland involves a series of fea
sibility studies.
"Daniel did his project almost as a
gift to the city," Miley said, "and where
the city is, is we're moving forward to try
to line up the funding to do a lot of stud
ies that need to happen. There's an en
vironmental study and an alternative
analysis that needs to be done before we
get to the point where we can put a

shovel in the ground... We also need
funding, whether it's a private fund or a
federal grant, and we're several years
away from that now."
This summer, however, the city of
Oakland plans to run a new, free shuttle
that follows the same alignment out
lined in Jacobson's proposal. The
Broadway Shuttle will link Jack Lon
don Square to 21st and Broadway, and
provide much of the numberical data
needed for the feasibility study, accord
ing to Miley.
"I think if Oakland takes this on and
gets some strong leadership, there's
nothing stopping them from having a
streetcar system in around 15 years," Ja
cobson said. "The momentum, the in
terest and the need is there, and it's a
matter of the city's officials really push
ing for it."
One of the new features about this
project is that the construction for this
project spans two blocks in two weeks,
runs in fixed traffic and will not con
sume too many parking spaces, accord
ing to Jacobson, who has also devised
means to fund the project.
"The design is fairly simple, and the
next part is the funding section con
struction and operations where we
ask, what different funding sources can
be put together without breaking Oak
land's budget?" Jacobson said.
"There's also an interest in federal
funding for this project, but the funding
scenarios I've come up with are mostly
privately driven, and when people ask if
Oakland can fund it, the answer is very
much yes."
The impact of this proposal could be
huge for the city of Oakland, according
to Stout.
"Urban planning bureaucracies
tend to be very heavily laden and im
penetrable, so [having student projects
picked up] hardly ever happens," Stout
said. "But the importance of it being a
Stanford student and a citizen in gener
al is essential to our democracy. It
shows that there are people out there
who are willing to come up with ideas to
be considered."
"At Stanford, we have a great tradi
tion of community service , and this is an
example of community service at its
highest form," he added. "It's outstand
