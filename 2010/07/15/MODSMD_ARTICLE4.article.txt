## Student proposes streetcar plan

A downtown streetcar line could be the key
to getting the city of Oakland back on its feet,
says Daniel Jacobson 'l2, a Stanford undergrad
who authored a study to revitalize the city's

sophomore year conducting independent re
search in urban studies, and has produced a de
tailed plan to breathe life back into downtown
Oakland. His proposal entails building a 2.5-
mile streetcar line that runs through the heart of
the city, connecting Piedmont and Upper
Broadway to Jack London Square an initia
tive that could add over 20,000 new residents
and create 20,000 new jobs in the downtown

area.
"This would translate to as much as $BOO mil
lion in annual sales, bringing $5 million in annu
al sales tax revenue all of this is just within
three blocks of the line," Jacobson said.
While the proposal links the newly redevel
oped areas of uptown Oakland to the city's wa
terfront, Jacobson indicates that the real hub of
the project lies in the downtown area, where the
two BART stations are located.
"They're really trying to revitalize the area,
which is soon going to be the home of the Jack
London market," he said, adding that the addi

the potential relocation of the Oakland A's sta
