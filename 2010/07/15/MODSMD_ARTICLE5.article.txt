## Nadeem J.Z. Hussain to become new dean of FroSoCo 
### ERIC MESSINGER SUMMER MANAGING EDITOR 
The Freshman-Sophomore College (FroSo-
Co) has a new dean, only the program's second
since its founding in 1999.
Nadeem J.Z. Hussain '9O, a professor of phi
losophy, has been tapped to lead the residential
program, which houses freshmen and sopho
mores on West campus. Hussain previously
served as a residential fellow (RF), and has
taught at Stanford since 2000.
Hussain, who majored in symbolic systems
when he was a Stanford undergraduate, said that
his experience as a student at the Farm motivat-

Ed his decision to take
on the appointment.
"When I was a
freshman at Trancos
in Wilbur Hall long
ago, the RF had us
over for dinner with
John Perry, a philoso
phy professor," Hus
sain wrote in an e-mail

to The Daily. "After a fascinating conversation,
he said, 'Why don't you become a philoso
pher?'"
"I kept taking my physics major courses for
a while, but that conversation eventually led to

my becoming a philosopher," Hussain contin
ued. "FroSoCo is aimed at creating enhanced
opportunities for just those kinds of conversa
tions and now I have the chance to help make
that happen."
He also noted that joining a "lively and
close-knit community" was especially appeal
ing.
"It's a great program that students like a lot.
The thought of being part of that was really ex
citing," he said.
Prior to Hussain, FroSoCo has had only one
dean, its founder John Bravman '79 M.S. 'Bl
Ph.D. 'B5. Bravman had earned a reputation
among students of the college for his dedication

and approachability. Provost John
Etchemendy Ph.D. 'B2 said that in selecting the
new dean, Hussain's profile of Stanford con
nections made a crucial difference.
With those ties in mind, one of Hussain's top
priorities is to build and strengthen connections
between FroSoCo students and Stanford facul
ty and staff.
"I want to work closely with Undergraduate
Advising and Research to figure out which fac
ulty and other staff... would be crucial to have
our students get to know," he said, pointing

specifically to examining which cours
es appealed most to students or could
benefit from greater exposure, and
the importance of finding faculty who
can serve as mentors.

The FroSoCo program itself is in
no danger of being scaled back in the
wake of Bravman's departure, ac
cording to administrators. Instead,
according to Etchemendy, the Uni
versity is looking into initiating more
programs similar to FroSoCo in up
coming years.
"We think that the FroSoCo has
been quite successful," Etchemendy
said. "One of the things we've been in

terested in has been duplicating
FroSoCo."
He added that the cost of the pro
gramming for the activity-driven col
lege was higher than that of an aver
age dorm, and that achieving some of
its effects with "less money" would
be vital for any new implementation
of a similar model.
For his part, Hussain believes that
FroSoCo serves a crucial need for the

Stanford community.
"To respond to all the different
interests and backgrounds students
have, Stanford needs to have differ
ent kinds of residences and has to
keep experimenting within those res
idences," Hussain said. "FroSoCo is
one of these ongoing experiments."
