### UTTARA SIVARAM DAILY INTERN 
Effective as early as October, Skype
will be moving its San Jose and Brisbane
offices to 3210 Porter Drive, located in
the Stanford Research Park. This move,
mirroring social network Facebook and
Tesla Motors' recent relocations, af
firms the importance of the park to the
Silicon Valley's high-tech community.
Founded in 1951, the Stanford Re
search Park boasts acclaim as the
world's first technology-focused office
park. The park is predominantly home
to scientific, electronics and research
oriented companies, and is often credit
ed with having a significant role in the
creation and de velopment of several Sil
icon Valley technology firms. Following
Hewlett-Packard's start in the park and
subsequent success in the electronics in
dustry, interest in Palo Alto and in the
Stanford community has only height

"We are thrilled that Skype decided
to create an office here at the Stanford
Research Park," said Tiffany Griego,
the associate director of Stanford Real
Estate Operations. "[Skype] is a solid
company with a lot of growth potential.
This move will really create jobs it'll
especially bring attention to the park."
Skype, which enables its users to

communicate through voice or face-to
face over the Internet, has enjoyed in
creasing popularity since its Luxem
bourg-based creation in 2003. In 2009,
Skype was purchased from eßay by an
investor group led by Silver Lake; this
transaction has given the software com
pany more room to expand, as Silver
Lake has reached a settlement agree
ment with Skype's sister company Joltid
Ltd., founded by Skype creators Niklas
Zennstrom and Janus Friis.
"Skype will be well positioned to
move forward under new owners with
ownership and control over its core
technology," said eßay president and
CEO John Donahoe in a Skype press re
lease.
Skype's decision to move away from
San Jose, the location of eßay's head
quarters, to the Stanford Research Park,
may benefit both the company and the
University. The research park, a covet

brightest technical minds in the Unit

"Skype moving near Stanford
should be a plus for campus j ob oppor
tunities," said Cyrus Navabi 'll.
"Having young companies like Face
book and Skype around is part of what
makes Stanford such an innovative
and exciting place."
"We hope to attract some of the
best and brightest talent in the Valley,
especially engineers who are skilled at
building ultra-scalable infrastruc
ture," said Skype CEO Josh Silver
man in a press release.

entails a considerable 90,000 square
feet of land set aside for regional mar
keting and business development. It
will join locations in Estonia, Prague
and Stockholm offices dedicated to
the constant maintenance and ad

popular company to Stanford's back
yard might also help those students
seeking real-life application of their
classroom studies.
"Skype's products are really well
known and exciting," said Chris An
derson 'lf. "It'd be pretty cool to talk
to your mom on a product you worked
on."
