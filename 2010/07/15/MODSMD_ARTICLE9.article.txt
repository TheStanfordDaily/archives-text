## Vaden physical therapy unit closed until Sept. 
### JESSICA UIEBERMAN DAILY INTERN 
Due to budget cuts, the Vaden physical therapy
unit will temporarily close its doors, beginning today,
and will reopen in the fall under the control of an out
side company. This decision has sparked negative re
actions among some of Vaden's patients, who are now
forced to seek treatment elsewhere until the unit re
opens.
At the height of the University's financial crisis last
year, Vaden, in addition to other departments on
campus, was asked to look for ways to reduce its ex
penses, said Ira Friedman, the director of Vaden
Health Center. Administrators decided that because
the campus health service fee did not cover the physi
cal therapy unit, the University would no longer finan
cially support it.
"It was a very serious and deliberative process,"
Friedman wrote in an e-mail to The Daily. "We
looked for savings in all of the units at Vaden. In phys
ical therapy, we needed to end the University's finan
cial support and rely entirely on insurance billing."
"We decided, after a lot of study, that to have the
physical therapy unit be self-sustaining, we needed to
bring in an outside company to manage it," he added.
In order to easily transition control of the unit into
outside hands, Vaden, which services 700 students a
year, made the decision to close its doors temporarily,
effective today.
"We are actively working to select the new compa
ny as quickly as possible," Friedman said, adding that
the firm has not yet been chosen and that the decision
would be announced as soon as it is made. "The tran
sition will take place over the remaining summer
months."
The decision to shut the unit down until fall quar
ter has also forced its four employees to find work
elsewhere for the time being.
"We are very concerned about our current staff,"
Friedman said. "They have been encouraged to apply
for positions with the new physical therapy company,
when it is chosen."
Tim Bowman, Vaden's chief physical therapist and
a 26-year employee, could not be reached for com
ment.
Friedman added that he is concerned for the stu
dents who use the physical therapy unit and that
Vaden is trying to make the transition for them as easy
as possible,
"There are a number of highly regarded physical
therapy offices located in the nearby community,"
Friedman said. "Vaden's Insurance and Referral Of
fice is helping our current patients transfer their care
while the physical therapy unit is temporarily closed."
"When the unit reopens in the fall, students will
continue to have the same high quality and conve-
nient access to physical therapy ser
vices inside the Vaden facility," he
added.
For one of those transitioning stu
dents, law student Emma Channing,
the closure is an extreme inconve
nience that couldn't have come at a
worse time.
"Currently, I'm studying for the
bar exam, which leaves me very little
time to leave campus and go to some
where like Palo Alto for treatment,"
she said.
Channing, who has been treated at
Vaden for bike-related injuries, also
said that she was given little advance
notice about the closure.
"When I was sent to the physical
therapists at Vaden, they warned me
they would only be open for two
more weeks, yet they haven't helped
me find anywhere else to go," she
said. "It's completely arbitrary and
insane."
Although Channing feels that
Vaden has not made this transition
easy for its patients, she belie ves they
have helped her a lot during her time
as a patient there.
"I don't think I will get the same
standard of care as I've received at
Vaden at another clinic," she said.
"The two physical therapists in the
unit have been wonderful. They use
heat and compression, which has
been amazing, and I don't know if I
can find that anywhere else."
