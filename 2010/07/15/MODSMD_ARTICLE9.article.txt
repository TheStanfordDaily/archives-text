## Vaden physical therapy unit closed until Sept. 
### JESSICA UIEBERMAN DAILY INTERN 
Due to budget cuts, the Vaden physical therapy
unit will temporarily close its doors, beginning today,
and will reopen in the fall under the control of an out
side company. This decision has sparked negative re
actions among some of Vaden's patients, who are now
forced to seek treatment elsewhere until the unit re
opens.
At the height of the University's financial crisis last
year, Vaden, in addition to other departments on
campus, was asked to look for ways to reduce its ex
penses, said Ira Friedman, the director of Vaden
Health Center. Administrators decided that because
the campus health service fee did not cover the physi
cal therapy unit, the University would no longer finan
cially support it.
"It was a very serious and deliberative process,"
Friedman wrote in an e-mail to The Daily. "We
looked for savings in all of the units at Vaden. In phys
ical therapy, we needed to end the University's finan
cial support and rely entirely on insurance billing."
"We decided, after a lot of study, that to have the
physical therapy unit be self-sustaining, we needed to
bring in an outside company to manage it," he added.
In order to easily transition control of the unit into
outside hands, Vaden, which services 700 students a
year, made the decision to close its doors temporarily,
effective today.
"We are actively working to select the new compa
ny as quickly as possible," Friedman said, adding that
the firm has not yet been chosen and that the decision
would be announced as soon as it is made. "The tran
sition will take place over the remaining summer
months."
The decision to shut the unit down until fall quar
ter has also forced its four employees to find work
elsewhere for the time being.
"We are very concerned about our current staff,"
Friedman said. "They have been encouraged to apply
for positions with the new physical therapy company,
when it is chosen."
Tim Bowman, Vaden's chief physical therapist and
a 26-year employee, could not be reached for com
ment.
Friedman added that he is concerned for the stu
dents who use the physical therapy unit and that
Vaden is trying to make the transition for them as easy
as possible,
"There are a number of highly regarded physical
therapy offices located in the nearby community,"
Friedman said. "Vaden's Insurance and Referral Of
fice is helping our current patients transfer their care
while the physical therapy unit is temporarily closed."
"When the unit reopens in the fall, students will
continue to have the same high quality and conve-
