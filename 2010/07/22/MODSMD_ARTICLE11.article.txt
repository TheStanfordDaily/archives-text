# SPEAKERS & EVENTS
## Car start-ups talk technology 
### AARON BRODER DAILY INTERN 
Representatives from six local automotive
companies and development teams came to
gether at the Center for Automotive Re
search at Stanford (CARS) last Thursday to
show off their prototype vehicles at the annu
al Vehicle Concept Showcase. In a question
and-answer session led by CARS director
Sven Beiker, a lecturer in mechanical engi
neering, the teams discussed the innovative
technology that makes their cars unique and
said they hope to inspire major car manufac
turers to take notice.
The center invited four teams in its extend
ed network, as well as two of its own student
run projects, to speak in the hope of giving vis
ibility to alternative vehicles that might other
wise go unnoticed. The five vehicles that made
an appearance at the showcase demonstrated
technology ranging from the standard combus
tion engine to fully electric and solar-powered
systems.
Silicon Valley may not call to mind the same
images of car manufacturing that Detroit does,
but according to the teams that have made their
home here, the valley has benefits that Motown
does not offer. As the industry moves further
away from gasoline-powered vehicles and to

ward electric cars, it is more useful for them to
be closer to the manufacturers of the chips that
gave the valley its name.
"The Silicon Valley has a lot to offer in
terms of innovation and self-starters and just a
can-do attitude," said Christopher Heiser, the
co-founder of a local automotive start-up. "But
there's a lot to learn, and this is really an oppor
tunity for all of us to really work together and
innovate."

The move to Silicon Valley has also helped
these businesses reach out to Stanford students
and alumni. Stanford students contributed not
only to the two all-student teams, but to other
projects at the showcase, too. Dante Zeviar, the
chief technology officer of KleenSpeed, whose
racecar placed first this year at the Refresh race
for electric vehicles, said that having students
on the team is one of their priorities.
"[We] are about knowledge and learning, so
in that spirit, I like to bring in interns and peo
ple from universities," Zeviar said. "My objec
tive in life is to bring in young people, the next
generation. The world is full of young people,
and I'm starting to get a little old. So the pur
pose is to bring in very smart individuals and
get them involved."
Although some of those who presented
hope to commercialize their products within
the next year, others, such as KleenSpeed and

Optimotive, hope to use the data they've col
lected and the new techniques they've pro
duced as a springboard for the future. Kleen-
Speed even hopes to take what it has learned
from race cars and apply it to a more familiar
car, the Mazda Miata, so the company can fur
ther its knowledge of how electric vehicles
might function in different scenarios.
One goal of the event is for such knowledge

to filter back to Motor City, where the big car
manufacturers would be able ensure much
more widespread use.
"We want to reach out to the start-ups in the
area to give them visibility they won't get oth
erwise, but we also want to get the incumbents
inspired," Beiker said.

Apogee, the latest model of the Stanford Solar Car, was exhibited at the annual Concept Car
Showcase on campus last Thursday. The team recently won the American Solar Car Challenge.
