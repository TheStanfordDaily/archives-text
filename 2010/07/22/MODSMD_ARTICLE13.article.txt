## THIS COLUMN SENT FROM MY IPHONE Listen, Summer, You Ain't So Big 
### Peter McDonald 
Though everyone will claim to have their
personal preferences, it's pretty much
unanimous consent that summer, out of
all the seasons, is top dog. Sure winter may
have Christmas, and spring may have its tradi
tion of assassinations, but summer wins pre
cisely because it never loses. Baseball, the best
sport, has its season during the summer. 100
out of 100 schoolchildren agree that summer is
like really the best vacation EVER! Summer
hits are the catchiest; summer movies are the
most enjoyable. Summer romances only
involve unfairly hot girls and are completely
drama-free. Shakespeare's most famous play
is "A Midsummer Night's Dream," and the
most interesting female character's name in
"The 0.C." was Summer. Seasonal affective
disorder only goes one way. Yeah, no one
works and no one has any problems. Why
can't it just be summer all year?
Oh, that's right. If we had summer the
whole year, then the entire country would turn
into the Greater Los Angeles Area (*audible
shudder*), and if I understand climate change
science correctly, then that might actually hap
pen. And since I am most definitely NOT try
ing to have the next version of "The Hills" set

in Columbus, Ohio, I think it might be time to
work out our issues with summer.

First, summer, you need to stop talking
about how easy you make living, when you can
be just as extreme as winter when it comes to
weather. Music industry, you largely take the
blame for this one. Ever since Gershwin's
opera "Porgy and Bess," summertime, you've
been tooting your own horn about how "the
livin's easy" and repeatedly exhorting a scared
child not to cry as a result. Your pernicious
reach even caused the most emo band I lis
tened to throughout all of high school,
Lostprophets, to construct an "Ode to
Summer" where they declare that "the last
good times of summer / are the last few min
utes of warmth." Jesus, summer. Cognitive dis
sonance much?

After all, the original idea for summer
break and you can thank the Midwest for
this one came from schools needing to shut
down for some months so that the chillun'
could help out with the farm. Nowadays, since
there is far less tilling and hoeing to do in the
average American household, we just sit
around and watch news reports about how
freakin' hot it is outside. Hey Gershwin, why

don't you ask all the heat stroke victims in
New York if they agree that summertime is so
goddamn easy? These stories happen every
year, and yet they always surprise the news
media. Maybe if you and your musical cohorts
would write more songs about how boring and
drippy summer is, then maybe society could
not be so flabbergasted when it turns out that
summertime living can actually be hard.
Movies and TV, you're not off the hook for
propagating this rose-colored Ray-Bans view
of summer, either. Hey Hollywood, last time I
checked summer takes up one fourth of the
year, and throughout the course of a year most
people tend to have at least four problems.
Why you guys got to dump all your problem
stories into Oscar season and sweeps?
Summer is only for superficial enjoyment. Just
once can't we have a funeral or a break-up or
a lesson about the importance of family hap
pen on a beautiful day in July? Even worse is
your constant ignoring, with the exception of
Spike Lee's masterful "Do the Right Thing,"
of the summer heat wave, even though Very
Reliable Sociology Studies indicate that sharp
increases in temperature, like ones that take
place during the summer, are correlated with

increases in crime. Why isn't the Freedom
Summer as well documented as the Summer of
Love? It's quite possible that if you guys
stressed that narrative as much as the carefree
summer one, people might remember to chill
out in an effort to help them chill out more fre
quently.
Vapidity, undocumented crime, disregard
for other people's problems these are as
much the legacy of summer as fried food,
habitual weed smoking, acoustic guitar circles
and feel-good hits are. Dear God, summer
really is Greater Los Angeles for a season.
Who can we turn to for hope then? Just like
always, leave it to the brave visionaries of
"South Park" to say what nobody else will, but
every one suspects might be true. Chiefly, it
just might be possible that "Summer Sucks"
(episode 208, easily locatable online), you
know, as least as much as winter does.
