Chances are you, being the literate per
son you are, have probably read some
science fiction in your life. Or, less prob
ably, a geometry text book. So you understand
that the zeroth dimension is a point, the first a
line, the second a plane, the third space, and
(through whatever exciting imagery) the
fourth is space-time. And you know what it
means when I say a group of points, or the
entities they represent, (the pyramids at Giza,
the price of a good versus the supply, the
descending quality of M. Night Shyamalan's
movies), is linear. They lie on a line.
But what about when I say thoughts are lin
ear? Linear thinking is a progression from one
thought (the conjunct of your premises), to its
logical consequence, then to its logical conse
quence, and so on. A train of thought. This is the
skeleton of mathematical proof and any good
expository writing (hopefully your PWR paper).
The creation of documents representing linear
thought processes is both easy and useful. A lin
ear argument, from a single point of view, is the
easiest to communicate. But linearity can also
be restricting. Imagine an ant walking along a
taut string as if he could only travel along that
line. Now imagine a multi-dimensional being
folding the string, bringing the two ends togeth
er. All of a sudden the ant has teleported from
one point on the line to another.
It is a familiar story, I know. Personally, I'm
indebted to Madeleine L'Engle, and I'm sure
we're both ultimately indebted to E. A.
Abbott. But until recently I hadn't thought of
how these illustrations of spatial linearity
related to linearity of reasoning. Every step is
necessary when traveling in only one dimen

sion, even when traveling between thoughts.
Without height as a dimension, there's no way
to leap. Conversation is one place we might
look for instances of multi- dimensional ideas.
Consider two distinct linear arguments togeth
er and you've outlined something that has to
exist on a plane. You've added a dimension.
This is one appeal of the dialogue as an argu
ment structure.

It also seems like a lot of literature is dedi
cated to transcending linearity. Through
metaphor you can run multiple trains of
thought on the same fuel. And by writing
down your thoughts, documenting your data
points, you lessen the cognitive load of keep
ing track of them. This allows you to look back
and draw new lines, in different directions, on
what you've already created.
This is the premise of the game
"Sentences," developed by George Hokkanen
'l2. Recommended for 2-3 players. Requires
pencil or pen, paper or whiteboard. The con
cept is simple: start with a sentence, any sen
tence, and think about it. A lot. Strip it down
so far it would make Derrida blush. Define
words, define their definitions, define how
they relate to one another, to the reader, to
you. Take notes. Notation is important.
Explore your concepts in this way until you
reach another sentence: another point you'd
like to plot. Build outward from that. Aim for
new sentences to tie into the existing sentences
in as many ways as possible. Stray from these
rules to taste. In the end, you should have a
structurally interesting thought-object.
Sound dull? It's not. Because if you like to
think (and I'd like to think most of you do like

to think), this is a fun way to do it. Even if a
certain sentence isn't particularly potent by
itself, the game invigorates it, at least for the
players. This is a thinking game more than a
writing game: a systematized way to sculpt
ideas about anything. Philosophy. Operating
systems. Language. Psychology. I'd love to see
history or chemistry majors set loose on this.
The first time I played, things took a turn to
metacommentary. I saw the ultimate object of

the game as to represent everything. Which is
the tenth dimension, of course, according to a
You Tube video I'd seen earlier that day.
Hokkanen remarked that this might be a good
guiding force and wrote on our note page: We
are going to everything.
But we needed a first sentence. Someone
suggested a boat. We liked the imagery.
Sentence (1): We are on a boat getting to a
place.
(2) Stock the yar vessel with fuel * and guid
ance*. (3) Buoyed up on the sea of understand
ing, pull up the anchor of convention. (4) Let
the wind* fill the sails*, and we're on our way
into the unknown.
Our fuel was language, our guidance, struc
ture. We were mapping the sea as we went, so
far as we could perceive from the bow. The
winds were ideas, our minds the sails. How
you get to everything:
(5) A rogue wind blows demanding whence
and whither. Whence? What's land?
(6) We come from ignorance, a dry place...
Whither? "If we're going to everything,
we're mapping bounds of the ocean, right?
We're seeking our limits," I offer.
"Our limits, hm?" Hokkanen says, and squints
at me. "I wonder if we'd ever think to look
up."
Sentence (6 (b)) ... we are going to the end of
the page.

It seems like a lot
of literature is dedicated to
transcending linearity.
Through metaphor
you can run multiple
trains of thought on the
same fuel.
