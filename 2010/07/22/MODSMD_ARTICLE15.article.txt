## CHRIS CHAN 'FRIEND AND DREAMER' 
### HONG VAN PHAM 
Sunday afternoon in the Main Quad was a famil
iar scene. Tourists went through their usual
motions, moving in small groups that buzzed of
English, Chinese, Russian and other foreign
tongues. Their necks were outstretched, fascinat
ed by the grand sights of Memorial Church and the repet
itive arches that encircle the Main Quad. With cameras in
their hands, the tourists clicked away this fleeting
moment.
But the moment lingered for a man and a woman sit
ting 10 feet away, separated from this whole scene. They
wore black, and their solemn composures were held
together by their entangled fingers. The woman tipped
her head upward to reveal her swollen, red eyes. The
two, like many more, had come for the July 18 memorial
service of Christina "Chris" Chan M.S. 'OB.
Just outside the steps of Memorial Church rested a
black-and-white photograph of Chan that captured her
radiant, soulful smile. She is the reason so many have
traveled across the nation to express their tribute to her
life and their condolences to her loved ones.
Her friends and family trickled inside the church
before the service, filling up rows of wooden pews. A
curly-haired girl clutching her Winnie-the-Pooh bear
stumbled down the aisle. As she passed, the child
watched the adults through the lens of her round, brown
eyes, vaguely aware of the weight in the atmosphere.

Nearby, two friends rose from their seats and reached
out to hug one another, only to end up in tears. The
woman's cries were muffled into the man's shoulders. As
he handed her a crumbled tissue, they both let out a bro
ken laugh.
Then the service began.
Chan's friend Paul Csonka, a Stanford doctoral stu
dent in robotics, delivered the first reflection.
"Dear Chris," he softly began to a stilled audience, "I
am humbled when remembering you."
"'You missed a spectacular storm on Saturday,' you
wrote to me in an e-mail last summer,'" he said. 'You
could see the falls starting up on the captain and middle
cathedral, the thunder was echoing against the granite
walls, and the mist quickly floated up from the ground,
like clouds hovering over the valley floor.'"
His heartfelt words then illuminated the rich layers of
Chris's personality.
"What an incredible mix you are of poet, scholar and
athlete and comedian, and best of all for us, professional
friend and dreamer," he said.
He moved on to recount the time they first met at
Stanford Alpine Club with a fond and nostalgic smile.
"She plopped down in a free seat, and just began enthu
siastically talking with all of us total strangers. It was
obvious, literally on that day, that Chris was out of the
ordinary."
