## CHRIS CHAN 'FRIEND AND DREAMER' 
### HONG VAN PHAM 
Sunday afternoon in the Main Quad was a famil
iar scene. Tourists went through their usual
motions, moving in small groups that buzzed of
English, Chinese, Russian and other foreign
tongues. Their necks were outstretched, fascinat
ed by the grand sights of Memorial Church and the repet
itive arches that encircle the Main Quad. With cameras in
their hands, the tourists clicked away this fleeting
moment.
But the moment lingered for a man and a woman sit
ting 10 feet away, separated from this whole scene. They
wore black, and their solemn composures were held
together by their entangled fingers. The woman tipped
her head upward to reveal her swollen, red eyes. The
two, like many more, had come for the July 18 memorial
service of Christina "Chris" Chan M.S. 'OB.
Just outside the steps of Memorial Church rested a
black-and-white photograph of Chan that captured her
radiant, soulful smile. She is the reason so many have
traveled across the nation to express their tribute to her
life and their condolences to her loved ones.
Her friends and family trickled inside the church
before the service, filling up rows of wooden pews. A
curly-haired girl clutching her Winnie-the-Pooh bear
stumbled down the aisle. As she passed, the child
watched the adults through the lens of her round, brown
eyes, vaguely aware of the weight in the atmosphere.

Nearby, two friends rose from their seats and reached
out to hug one another, only to end up in tears. The
woman's cries were muffled into the man's shoulders. As
he handed her a crumbled tissue, they both let out a bro
ken laugh.
Then the service began.
Chan's friend Paul Csonka, a Stanford doctoral stu
dent in robotics, delivered the first reflection.
"Dear Chris," he softly began to a stilled audience, "I
am humbled when remembering you."
"'You missed a spectacular storm on Saturday,' you
wrote to me in an e-mail last summer,'" he said. 'You
could see the falls starting up on the captain and middle
cathedral, the thunder was echoing against the granite
walls, and the mist quickly floated up from the ground,
like clouds hovering over the valley floor.'"
His heartfelt words then illuminated the rich layers of
Chris's personality.
"What an incredible mix you are of poet, scholar and
athlete and comedian, and best of all for us, professional
friend and dreamer," he said.
He moved on to recount the time they first met at
Stanford Alpine Club with a fond and nostalgic smile.
"She plopped down in a free seat, and just began enthu
siastically talking with all of us total strangers. It was
obvious, literally on that day, that Chris was out of the
ordinary."

Stanford doctoral student in political science Christina "Chris" Chan M.S. '08, 31
years old, died in a climbing accident two weeks ago. Friends and family paid their
respects at the memorial service on Sunday at Memorial Church.
"By far, climbing wasn't her
greatest strength. Friendship was
her greatest strength," Csonka told
the audience."l learned from Chris
that we should live our own ways, in
away that's fitting to ourselves, no
matter how unusual it looks to oth
ers. Chris, you never ceased to show
us to be honest with ourselves."

"From you I learn to live as
though all my friends and every
thing that was happening were a
dream come true," he continued.
His voice became softer, the loss
surfacing in the subtle droop of his
smile.

"My heart is sad when I think of
how I won't ever see your trade
mark smile anymore, or hear your
grand laugh or feel happy just being
in your company," he said.

Chan's friend from her under
graduate years at Harvard
University, Jeremy Gaw, echoed
the same sentiments felt by many in

the room.
"Chris was different. She was a
breath of fresh air," Gaw said.
"For Chris, college was a time to
explore, to discover ... and most
importantly, to develop lifelong
friendships," Gaw added.
Chan's friend shared some of
their memories together, revealing
more facets and layers of Chan's
life.
"When we weren't playing
Frisbee, we were running around
the Charles River ... We also had
many bike trips, rain or shine of
course rain or shine for Chris to
Walden Pond," Gaw said.
"Chris, wherever you are, we
miss you and we love you," Gaw's

voice broke, struggling to contain
tears. "When I am running or biking
or trying something new, I know
you'll still be with me, cheering me
on."

Angie Heo, Chan's roommate
from her freshman year at Harvard,
described Chan as a visionary.
"She had a strong sense that she
wanted her life to count, and want
ed to do it with ours," Heo said.

A musical interlude follows with
"Amazing Grace," performed by
Stephen Henderson on the guitar.
Up front, a young man in a mili
tary uniform sat with his head low
ered in deep contemplation. To the
left of him, a man wrapped his arms
around a woman's shoulders in gen
tle comfort. A bright glow seeped
through the church's oculus, casting
a light on the lowered heads and
stilled eyes and bodies of those
immersed in their own thoughts.
For this moment, time graciously
stayed put in remembrance of Chris
Chan.

The reflections resumed with
Stanford graduate student in energy
resources engineering Sarah
Inwood, Chan's friend. She
described Chan's enthusiastic
appreciation for life.
"She saw beauty in every
moment, in every person, in every
thing ... Some people can live a
long life and not live to the extent
that Chris did," she said.
"Those of you who know Chris,
you know she suffers from a syn
drome known as 'overly generous,"'
Inwood continued. The audience let
out a light laugh.
"Everything about her was infec
tious," Inwood said. "Now that
she's gone, I just see a gaping hole."
Peter Chan, Chan's older broth
er, gave the final reflection at the
service. He slowly made his way to
the podium and began, "For the

past week I've struggled to figure
out how to express tribute to an
amazing person I've known my
entire life."
Peter Chan moved on to remi
nisce of his sister's fearless nature
that had surfaced at an early age.
"She would swim out to the
ocean so far that the lifeguards
would frantically wave for her to
come back to shore," he said.
He described Chris Chan as "the
true trailblazer through life," high
lighting her gift "to inspire you to
do things you never thought you
could, to climb higher and farther
than you thought you could, to feel
like you're at the top of the world."
In his closing remarks, Peter
Chan left these fond words for his
sister: "Chris, you've climbed high
er than all of us ... thank you for
being the best of friend, sister and
inspiration."
As Chris Chan herself had so
eloquently described her climbing
experience on her Stanford website,
"To climb upward into the starry
night and finally reach the top of the
climb under a moonless sky was a
beautiful experience. It reminded
me of the end of Dante's Inferno:
My guide and I came on that hidden
road/ to make our way back into the
bright world; / and with no care for
any rest, we climbed / he first, I fol
lowing until I saw, /through a round
opening, some of those things / of
beauty Heaven bears. It was from
there / that we emerged, to see once
more the stars.
Chris Chan, daughter, sister,
friend and inspiration a bundle
of life that will continue to resonate
with the lives of those she's
touched.
