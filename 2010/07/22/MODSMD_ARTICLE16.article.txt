# Vegging Out
## Exploring the vegetarian lifestyle 
### JESSICA LIEBERMAN DAILY INTERN 
Someone once said that it's a rite of
passage to become a vegetarian while
in college. But for some Stanford stu
dents, this switch doesn't last only for
a couple of years it becomes a
lifestyle change with long-lasting effects on
their health and beliefs.
While many students decide to become
vegetarians during college, there are also
some that have been practicing some level of
vegetarianism for years. According to Vivian
Crisman, a nutritionist with Health
Promotion Services at Vaden Health Center,
some students decide to completely eliminate
meat when they come to school.
"National data seem to indicate about 10-
20 percent of college age students report
being vegetarian," she wrote in an e-mail to
the Daily. "When away from home and dining
at Stanford, students find it easier to adopt a
vegetarian lifestyle. So they might have been
'partial' vegetarians when at home in high
school and now have gone completely vege
tarian at Stanford."
Because of this, Stanford dining halls have
been providing students with more vegetarian
food options.
"For the most part, I think Stanford Dining
does a very good job accommodating vegetar
ians," Hannah Belitz 'l3 wrote in an e-mail to
The Daily. "I do think certain dining halls are
better than others, though. A lot of the dining
halls tend to just offer tofu as a meat alterna
tive, which gets really tiring, but Wilbur,
where I ate most of my meals last year, also
had a lot of bean and lentil dishes, as well as a
great selection of whole grains, fresh fruits
and vegetables."
Students choose to eliminate meat for a
variety of reasons.
"Most commonly, students tell me the dri

ving force is ecology and animal welfare rea
sons," Crisman said. "My concern is when I
counsel students who choose to be vegetarian
for ecology reasons but still have a lousy diet
having a lousy diet before means their diets
could be even worse as a vegetarian."
But for other students, a vegetarian diet
has been a part of their lifestyle for as long as
they can remember. For those like Belitz,
making smart food choices comes naturally.
"I've been eating this way for most of my
life, so I don't really feel like it's affected my

lifestyle," Belitz said. "This is simply the
lifestyle I've always had. However, I do think
I eat healthier and I'm more aware of what I
eat as a result."
Ethics also play a major role in the decision
to adopt a vegetarian or vegan lifestyle. After
researching the cruel treatment of animals,
Janani Balasubramanian 'l2, decided to com
pletely eliminate animal products from her
diet.
"I used to think, quite simply, that vegans
were extreme and that vegetarianism itself

was enough," Balasubramanian said. "But
this thought prompted me to do further
research. I looked into factory farming meth
ods, not only for animals that were raised for
slaughter, but also for animals raised for milk,
eggs, wool, etc. It was heartbreaking."
"I decided then that since I had the
resources, willpower and compassion to
become vegan, I should do so," she added.

To meet the needs of vegetarian and vegan students, Stanford dining halls provide meat-free options at each meal time, including tofu, bean and
lentil dishes. But Stanford Health Promotion Sen/ices nutritionist Vivian Crisman warns that going vegetarian will not necessarily fix a poor diet.
