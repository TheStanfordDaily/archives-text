# LOST? LOOK NO FURTHER
## Learning the campus sign language Stanford street signage evolves to meet community and visitor needs 
### DAVID BALLANTINE 
In a typical jaunt down the
postcard-famous Palm Drive,
it is easy to get lost in the
serene quality of an endless
row of palm trees. Less notice
able, however, are the small direc
tional signs that might point to, say,
the Stanford Visitor Center.

A real journey begins for the
ambitious traveler trying to locate
the bookstore, one of the most pop
ular destinations for campus visitors.
It can be mind-numbing to navigate
your way across the largest universi
ty campus in the United States by
contiguous area, so I embarked on
such an adventure.

Warning: the following escapade
is not for the faint of heart, and my
hunt one evening for textbooks was
a stressful and frustrating quest.
Putting myself in the shoes of a
tourist, I enter the campus driving
south on Palm Drive.
At the intersection of Palm Drive
and Campus Drive, a sign points left
for the bookstore my first clue.
But then finding the next sign is
an odyssey.
Approaching the intersection at
Galvez, I find no signs for the book
store, so I just keep going straight.
Next intersection at Serra Street and
still nothing.
