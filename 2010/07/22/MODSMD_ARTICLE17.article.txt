# LOST? LOOK NO FURTHER
## Learning the campus sign language Stanford street signage evolves to meet community and visitor needs 
### DAVID BALLANTINE 
In a typical jaunt down the
postcard-famous Palm Drive,
it is easy to get lost in the
serene quality of an endless
row of palm trees. Less notice
able, however, are the small direc
tional signs that might point to, say,
the Stanford Visitor Center.

A real journey begins for the
ambitious traveler trying to locate
the bookstore, one of the most pop
ular destinations for campus visitors.
It can be mind-numbing to navigate
your way across the largest universi
ty campus in the United States by
contiguous area, so I embarked on
such an adventure.

Warning: the following escapade
is not for the faint of heart, and my
hunt one evening for textbooks was
a stressful and frustrating quest.
Putting myself in the shoes of a
tourist, I enter the campus driving
south on Palm Drive.
At the intersection of Palm Drive
and Campus Drive, a sign points left
for the bookstore my first clue.
But then finding the next sign is
an odyssey.
Approaching the intersection at
Galvez, I find no signs for the book
store, so I just keep going straight.
Next intersection at Serra Street and
still nothing.
I don't find another sign for the
bookstore until Lane A, 1.3 miles
later. Two signs in quick succession
and mission accomplished, I'm
parking in Tresidder.
It can be easy to take for granted
the maintenance of street and
pedestrian signs on campus, but it is
a very complex job that involves
architects and planners. All the sig
nage at Stanford is overseen by
University Architect/Campus
Planning Design (UA/CPD), which
is tasked with both designing signs
and also keeping maps and directo
ries up to date.
"In the last five years we've start
ed to evolve to a different system,"
said Cathy Blake, the associate
director of UA/CPD. Colors are
being used to distinguish between
different types of signs, such as for
campus parking.
More parking garages are spring
ing up or down if it's under
ground and traditional surface
parking lots are becoming less com
mon, said Blake. In the new system,
there are more green signs which
indicate where the nearest parking
garages are located.
One of UA/CPD's goals is to give
more identity to streets such as
Campus Drive for them "to become

as memorable and clear as Palm
Drive," Blake said.

But Blake added that this isn't a
total revamping of the signs on cam
pus. "It's evolving, it's not a redo,"
she said.
Blake also described a new cam
pus entries project, which aims to
analyze and improve the entrances
to the campus, and better define the
entrances themselves, using both
signs and landscapes. And UA/CPD
say they're engaging with the public
byway of focus groups.
"We're asking the community to
give us input," Blake said.
In recent years there have been
improvements. The pedestrian sign
system didn't even exist five years
ago and is being developed on a by
need basis, according to Blake.
Updating signage for massive
building projects is one of UA/CPD's
most important tasks. Strolling
around campus, a casual observer
will find construction everywhere,
with projects like the Knight
Management Center southeast of
Hoover Tower and a new extension
to the Stanford Law School.

Signs for new buildings and struc
tures will be updated right before
they open to avoid as much confu
sion as possible, Blake said.
For now, if someone from Cal
asks for directions, point them
toward Kresge.
