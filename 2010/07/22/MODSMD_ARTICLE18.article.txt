## Card alumni step into MLB Taking the game from a passion to a career 
### JOSEPH BEYDA DAILY INTERN 
The success of Stanford's baseball program
has carried over to the pros, where several re
cently graduated Cardinal players are starting
to make their mark. Pitcher Drew Storen,
catcher Jason Castro and infielders Colin
Walsh and Adam Gaylord are among the no
table Stanford players making the transition to
professional baseball this season.
Storen and Castro have earned widespread
acclaim playing in the MLB for the Washington
Nationals and Houston Astros, respectively.
They've done well to this point; Storen has

posted a 2-1 record and a 2.28 ERA in 25 ap
pearances, while Castro got a hit in his first
major league at-bat and has recorded two
home runs in 19 games. For him, the biggest dif
ference between playing professionally and at
Stanford has been the travel.

"Playing on the road every week or so in dif
ferent cities has been challenging, as well as the
amount of games played consecutively," Cas
tro wrote in an e-mail to the Daily.
Walsh, playing Single-A ball with the St.
Louis Cardinals subsidiary Batavia Muckdogs,
agrees that the professional schedule was hard
to get used to.
"You play every day here, no breaks, no prac
tices," Walsh said. "Even five days a week [at
Stanford] is real different than seven days a
week, every week, so that's the hardest transi
tion to make."

Walsh, who grew up in San Diego before
coming to The Farm, had to adjust to the cli

mate and size of his new setting as well.
"I'm used to California weather and cities,"
he said. "Now, we're in small towns in upstate
New York, so the atmosphere's a little differ
ent."
So far, the Cardinal's former second base
man has been able to adjust fairly well. He's
batting .320 through 12 appearances.
Also playing on the East Coast is Gaylord,
with the Baltimore Orioles affiliate Aberdeen
Iron√üirds at the Single-A level. He has played
in 31 games, batting .309 and knocking in 13
runs.
Gaylord points out that players moving to
the pros have to master a new technical aspect
of the game as well, as they begin playing with
a wooden bat for the first time.
"Wooden bats are a little bit more top
heavy," he wrote in an e-mail to the Daily. "So
you have to alter your hand path through your
swing a bit to keep the barrel of the bat from

dragging under the ball and inducing a pop fly."
"You have to spend more time stretching
and treating possible injuries proactively so
that you can stay healthy," Gaylord added.
"Besides that, it's the same game that I've been
playing since I could walk."
These adjustments have to be made while
advancing through the farm system with the ul
timate goal of reaching the MLB, a journey that
took Castro two years and on which Walsh and
Gaylord have only just embarked.
Walsh claims that Stanford has prepared
him well for the road ahead.
"Playing in a conference like the Pac-10, and
playing some of the best teams in the nation
year in and year out facing the best players that
college baseball has to offer [...] consistently
makes you a better player," he said.
