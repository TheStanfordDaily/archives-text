# Sexual orientation gossip has no place in sports journalism
## 
### TOM TAYLOR 
In the aftermath of the World Cup, one controversial news
story in particular caught my eye. Michael Becker, the agent
of Michael Ballack (the German captain, who was notably
absent from the tournament after breaking his leg in a warm
up game), allegedly gave an interview to the magazine Der
Spiegel in which he claimed several members of the German World
Cup squad were gay.
Now the question I have to ask is: Is this really newsworthy? Is
this something sports fans, and real sports journalists, should really
be interested in?
No, and yes.
No, because this has absolutely nothing to do with sports. Some
one's sexual orientation has nothing to do with their skills and ath
letic ability on the field. Trying to turn this into news simply turns
news into gossip.
As a real fan, I don't care what race or religion those who play for
my club are, so why should I mind if they are gay? I will support the
team regardless of who it is made up of.
If pushed to set any requirements, first and foremost I want them
to be great players who can work together and win lots and lots of
trophies. Second to that I'd rather they weren't doing anything ille
gal (either breaking the rules of the game or the laws of the land) and
were reasonably friendly and down to earth. Thirdly, I would like
them to entertain me a little and at least look like they're enjoying
themselves while doing a job that millions of us would kill for.
Sexual orientation has nothing to do with a person's physiology
and won't make them a worse (or better) athlete. It also doesn't
make you a cheat or a criminal, or in fact make you any different in
any other way. But, ironically, that is exactly why this sort of story
matters.
It is a particularly difficult statistic to measure, but the proportion
of people who identify with being gay, lesbian or bisexual seems to be
around 4 percent. Using this we can estimate how many players in dif
ferent sports are likely to have one of these sexual orientations. For
example, in the NFL there are up to 100 players in each team and 32
professional teams. We might therefore expect around 100 current
players to be gay, but the reality seems very different. A basic search
throws up just three people, none of whom are current players.
And this is not just a quirk of American football. There seem to
be only about a hundred professional athletes who admit to belong
ing to one of these groups out of the tens of thousands of sportsmen
and sportswomen around the globe. Of these, many came out only
after retirement.
When Lewis Hamilton became the first black driver in the histo
ry of Fl, there was nowhere to hide. Even before driving a single lap
in anger there was phenomenal media attention on him, enough
pressure to make many people crumble. Pioneering black athletes,
people like Lewis and Tiger Woods before him, never had any
where to hide the color of their skin is there for all to see. They
simply had to overcome any prejudices, and in doing so have cleared
the way for others to follow.
The situation is different for gay players, partly because they can
actually hide this part of their identity. Faced with the possibility of
career threatening prejudices from within and the inevitable media
feeding frenzy from outside, any athlete to become one of the first
to openly admit they are gay from a big team in a major sport would
need nerves of steel. When anyone's personal life is dragged
through the press, it must be tough for them to stay focused on work.
For an athlete it is doubly difficult, because this creates a feedback
loop where a drop in form due to this distraction only serves to in
tensify the media pressure.
People's prejudices come to the fore when things are going
badly, not because they are valid, but because in these situations it is
always easier to find a scapegoat than to solve the real problems.
Any bigoted opinions of the existence of a gay player in a team could
become a self-fulfilling prophecy. As the player, and thus the team,
struggle under the weight of the attention, it would suddenly seem
that they are a divisive and destructive presence.
Unfortunately there doesn't seem to be an easy solution. Some
players are probably going to have to take it upon their shoulders to
endure all this and lead the way to inspire others that they are
free to be honest and to overcome prejudices so that this career path
is open to absolutely anyone with the right skills and athletic ability.
And hopefully then we can finally stop talking about people's
private lives, and get back to what really matters: the sport.
