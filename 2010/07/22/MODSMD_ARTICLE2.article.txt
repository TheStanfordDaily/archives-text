## Passing of a legend 
### ELLEN HUET JANE LEPHAM 
At a high-caliber research uni
versity such as Stanford, professors
are often valued as much for their
scholarship as they are for their
teaching talents and personal rela
tionships with students and other
faculty. In Stephen H. Schneider,
however, the University had a
member whose contributions to the
University spanned both, combin
ing a shared passion for a cause
with highly respected scientific re
search and influence.

Schneider, a biology professor,
Woods Institute senior fellow and
one of the world's leading climatol
ogists, died on Monday at 65 from a
heart attack while flying from
Stockholm to London.

Over his full and prominent ca
reer, Schneider pioneered tirelessly

for recognition and swift action to
address climate change, pushing re
search as well as public awareness
and leading many other scientists to
explore the issue.

Schneider, who came to Stan
ford in 1992, had an influence that
reached far beyond the walls of the
Farm. His 40-year career included
advising the Nixon, Carter, Rea
gan, Clinton, both Bush and
Obama administrations, as well as
Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger.
He also played a pivotal role in the
2007 Nobel Peace Prize as lead sci
entist on the United Nations Inter
national Panel on Climate Change,
which shared the prize with A1
Gore.

As a researcher, Schneider was
well known for his vocal and wide
spread approach to climate change.
Aside from more than 450 scientif
ic articles and more than 200 book

reviews, editorials and other works,
he was a frequent contributor to
popular media such as "Nova" and
"The Today Show."

But however prestigious his in
volvement outside of the Universi
ty, Schneider will be best remem
bered at Stanford as approachable,
passionate and knowledgeable, and
as an invaluable mentor.
"Professor Steve Schneider was
a legend on campus," wrote
William Anderegg, one of his grad
uate students, in an e-mail to The
Daily.

"A brilliant, funny and indefati
gable scientist, Steve was never
afraid to stand up for his beliefs, to
communicate science, and to en
gage the media about the risks of
climate change," Anderegg added.
"But more than that, Steve was a
great person unflinchingly hon
est, caring, passionate."

Although climate science has
made vast advances in recent
decades, Schneider was among early
advocates and pushed for the cause
long before it began to gain popular
momentum. In these efforts, stu
dents and professors credit his
tenacity and dedication to a goal.

"What I remember most is his
incredible passion and dedication
to the cause of trying to change the
world and making it a better place,"
said Woods Institute director Jeff
Koseff. "He was untiring, and com
pletely and utterly dedicated to the
cause."

"I think more than anything, he
was a great catalyst and lightning
rod, whether you agreed with him
or not, to get us to confront the real
possibility of climate change, get
ting us to focus on the issue and de-

bate the issue," Koseff added

"There were a lot of people who
disagreed with him, but now 75 per
cent or more of Americans think
climate change a huge issue, and I
think people like Stephen Schnei
der had a great role in influencing
their opinion and educating them."
"His outgoing personality,
seemingly superhuman energy and
incredible intelligence made me
scared to have a conversation with
him," wrote Lee Anderegg 'll in
an e-mail to the Sustainability e
mail list. "But Steve was not just
well spoken, funny and smart. He
was dedicated to shaping a better
world, to education and science
and a sustainable future, on a level
that I can only hope to emulate."

Sarah Chadwick, Schneider's as
sistant, wrote to The Daily on be
half of his wife, biology professor
Terry Root, expressing a similar
take on his drive.

"Steve was relentless in fighting
misinformation and explaining the
need for policy action on numerous
fronts," Chadwick said. "He was
determined to communicate mes
sages that would inform the public
about the real risks that are in
volved with a business-as-usual po
sition and suggest concrete steps to
reverse the more ominous trends."

Schneider's dedication was par
ticularly highlighted during a seri
ous battle with mantle cell lym
phoma, a rare cancer, which he
chronicled in a 2005 book titled,
"The Patient from Hell." He con
sistently fought for involvement in
medical decisions about his health
during the saga, which ended in his
successful victory over the disease.
"Steve dealt with his cancer bat
tle as he did most issues in life as
a climate scientist and was his
own most diligent researcher,"
Chadwick said. "He was deter
mined to get the best treatment
possible and bring awareness to the
current flaws within the system. He
continued to be his own best advo
cate into his final days."
Schneider himself saw the
lessons he drew from climate sci
ence as applicable to other parts of
life, specifically his cancer struggle.
"Am I going to apply to my own
treatment the principles that I'm
advising government and indus
tries to apply to deal with climate
change uncertainties?" he asked in
a 2005 interview with the National
Academy of Sciences, of which he
was a member. "Hell, yes."
In both climate change and his
cancer struggle, Chadwick said,
Schneider knew where to draw the
line between scientific expertise
and personal value judgment, con
stantly assessing risks along the
way of an uncertain route.
Aside from personal health
struggles, Schneider's work in cli
mate change was not always greet
ed with open arms, even in recent
years. In the wake of the Universi
ty of East Anglia leaked e-mails
controversy in November 2009 and
in conjunction with the Copen
hagen conference, Schneider and
other climatologists came under
fire, which included receiving hate
mail and threats.
"The effect on me has been

tremendous," Schneider told The
Guardian earlier this month.

"Some of these people are mental
ly imbalanced. They are invariably
gun-toting right-wingers. What do I
do? Learn to shoot a Magnum?
Wear a bullet-proof jacket? I have
now had extra alarms fitted at my
home and my address is unlisted. I
get scared that we're now in a new
Weimar Republic where people
are prepared to listen to what
amounts to Hitlerian lies about cli
mate scientists."

Schneider's long-held desire to in
crease climate awareness for all peo
ple, not just academics, can be seen in
his many contributions to popular
media and his outspoken qualities.
But his ability and eagerness to share
knowledge was best manifested in in
teractions with students.

"In spite of his global renown
and accomplishment, he was will
ing to explain, and re-explain, the
most minute details of climate
change to [even the] most unin
formed students," wrote Students
for a Sustainable Stanford co-pres
ident Siddhartha Oza 'll in an e
mail to the Sustainable e-mail list.

"His fight for climate change was,
and remains, an inspiration for all
of us."

"He was an unbelievably good
communicator," Koseff added.

"He had the ability to put such
complicated concepts into lay
man's terms and help people un
derstand them."

And apart from his scientific
ventures, Koseff recalled, Schnei
der was "a New Yorker through
and through."
"He played on the Columbia
football team, back when they had a
football team for people who
weighed less than 150 pounds I
think he called it the 150-under
football team," Koseff said. "He
loved football and was so proud to
have played on the football team at
Columbia."

Although his scientific accom
plishments speak volumes for
themselves, it is the final words of
the students he worked with that
do the best to sum up Schneider's
lasting impact at the University.
"[Taking a class from Schnei
der] was like having a living text
book, except with better stories
and a whole lot more personality,"
wrote Brady Hamed 'l2 in an e
mail to The Daily.

"Professor Schneider inspired
me and so many others to follow
our passion for protecting the envi
ronment," Oza said. "His impact on
SSS was, and remains, undeniably
rewarding. Indeed, if there was one
thing that he taught us by example
it was this: don't back down from a
campaign you believe in."
"He was fantastic mentor, and
an inspiration to his students, his
colleagues and the global commu
nity," Anderegg added. "He was a
leading light in the science of cli
mate change and in communicating
the risks of climate change to the
media and the public. His legacy
will live on through those that he
taught, spoke with and inspired, as
we try to carry on his great work of
protecting our planet's climate."
He is survived by his wife Terry,
two children, Adam and Becca, and
one grandchild.

bate the issue," Koseff added

"There were a lot of people who
disagreed with him, but now 75 per
cent or more of Americans think
climate change a huge issue, and I
think people like Stephen Schnei
der had a great role in influencing
their opinion and educating them."
"His outgoing personality,
seemingly superhuman energy and
incredible intelligence made me
scared to have a conversation with
him," wrote Lee Anderegg 'll in
an e-mail to the Sustainability e
mail list. "But Steve was not just
well spoken, funny and smart. He
was dedicated to shaping a better
world, to education and science
and a sustainable future, on a level
that I can only hope to emulate."

Sarah Chadwick, Schneider's as
sistant, wrote to The Daily on be
half of his wife, biology professor
Terry Root, expressing a similar
take on his drive.

"Steve was relentless in fighting
misinformation and explaining the
need for policy action on numerous
fronts," Chadwick said. "He was
determined to communicate mes
sages that would inform the public
about the real risks that are in
volved with a business-as-usual po
sition and suggest concrete steps to
reverse the more ominous trends."

Schneider's dedication was par
ticularly highlighted during a seri
ous battle with mantle cell lym
phoma, a rare cancer, which he
chronicled in a 2005 book titled,
"The Patient from Hell." He con
sistently fought for involvement in
medical decisions about his health
during the saga, which ended in his
successful victory over the disease.
"Steve dealt with his cancer bat
tle as he did most issues in life as
a climate scientist and was his
own most diligent researcher,"
Chadwick said. "He was deter
mined to get the best treatment
possible and bring awareness to the
current flaws within the system. He
continued to be his own best advo
cate into his final days."
Schneider himself saw the
lessons he drew from climate sci
ence as applicable to other parts of
life, specifically his cancer struggle.
"Am I going to apply to my own
treatment the principles that I'm
advising government and indus
tries to apply to deal with climate
change uncertainties?" he asked in
a 2005 interview with the National
Academy of Sciences, of which he
was a member. "Hell, yes."
In both climate change and his
cancer struggle, Chadwick said,
Schneider knew where to draw the
line between scientific expertise
and personal value judgment, con
stantly assessing risks along the
way of an uncertain route.
Aside from personal health
struggles, Schneider's work in cli
mate change was not always greet
ed with open arms, even in recent
years. In the wake of the Universi
ty of East Anglia leaked e-mails
controversy in November 2009 and
in conjunction with the Copen
hagen conference, Schneider and
other climatologists came under
fire, which included receiving hate
mail and threats.
"The effect on me has been

tremendous," Schneider told The
Guardian earlier this month.

"Some of these people are mental
ly imbalanced. They are invariably
gun-toting right-wingers. What do I
do? Learn to shoot a Magnum?
Wear a bullet-proof jacket? I have
now had extra alarms fitted at my
home and my address is unlisted. I
get scared that we're now in a new
Weimar Republic where people
are prepared to listen to what
amounts to Hitlerian lies about cli
mate scientists."

Schneider's long-held desire to in
crease climate awareness for all peo
ple, not just academics, can be seen in
his many contributions to popular
media and his outspoken qualities.
But his ability and eagerness to share
knowledge was best manifested in in
teractions with students.

"In spite of his global renown
and accomplishment, he was will
ing to explain, and re-explain, the
most minute details of climate
change to [even the] most unin
formed students," wrote Students
for a Sustainable Stanford co-pres
ident Siddhartha Oza 'll in an e
mail to the Sustainable e-mail list.

"His fight for climate change was,
and remains, an inspiration for all
of us."

"He was an unbelievably good
communicator," Koseff added.

"He had the ability to put such
complicated concepts into lay
man's terms and help people un
derstand them."

And apart from his scientific
ventures, Koseff recalled, Schnei
der was "a New Yorker through
and through."
"He played on the Columbia
football team, back when they had a
football team for people who
weighed less than 150 pounds I
think he called it the 150-under
football team," Koseff said. "He
loved football and was so proud to
have played on the football team at
Columbia."

Although his scientific accom
plishments speak volumes for
themselves, it is the final words of
the students he worked with that
do the best to sum up Schneider's
lasting impact at the University.
"[Taking a class from Schnei
der] was like having a living text
book, except with better stories
and a whole lot more personality,"
wrote Brady Hamed 'l2 in an e
mail to The Daily.

"Professor Schneider inspired
me and so many others to follow
our passion for protecting the envi
ronment," Oza said. "His impact on
SSS was, and remains, undeniably
rewarding. Indeed, if there was one
thing that he taught us by example
it was this: don't back down from a
campaign you believe in."
"He was fantastic mentor, and
an inspiration to his students, his
colleagues and the global commu
nity," Anderegg added. "He was a
leading light in the science of cli
mate change and in communicating
the risks of climate change to the
media and the public. His legacy
will live on through those that he
taught, spoke with and inspired, as
we try to carry on his great work of
protecting our planet's climate."
He is survived by his wife Terry,
two children, Adam and Becca, and
one grandchild.

At a high-caliber research uni
versity such as Stanford, professors
are often valued as much for their
scholarship as they are for their
teaching talents and personal rela
tionships with students and other
faculty. In Stephen H. Schneider,
however, the University had a
member whose contributions to the
University spanned both, combin
ing a shared passion for a cause
with highly respected scientific re
search and influence.

Schneider, a biology professor,
Woods Institute senior fellow and
one of the world's leading climatol
ogists, died on Monday at 65 from a
heart attack while flying from
Stockholm to London.

Over his full and prominent ca
reer, Schneider pioneered tirelessly

for recognition and swift action to
address climate change, pushing re
search as well as public awareness
and leading many other scientists to
explore the issue.

Schneider, who came to Stan
ford in 1992, had an influence that
reached far beyond the walls of the
Farm. His 40-year career included
advising the Nixon, Carter, Rea
gan, Clinton, both Bush and
Obama administrations, as well as
Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger.
He also played a pivotal role in the
2007 Nobel Peace Prize as lead sci
entist on the United Nations Inter
national Panel on Climate Change,
which shared the prize with A1
Gore.

As a researcher, Schneider was
well known for his vocal and wide
spread approach to climate change.
Aside from more than 450 scientif
ic articles and more than 200 book

reviews, editorials and other works,
he was a frequent contributor to
popular media such as "Nova" and
"The Today Show."

But however prestigious his in
volvement outside of the Universi
ty, Schneider will be best remem
bered at Stanford as approachable,
passionate and knowledgeable, and
as an invaluable mentor.
"Professor Steve Schneider was
a legend on campus," wrote
William Anderegg, one of his grad
uate students, in an e-mail to The
Daily.

"A brilliant, funny and indefati
gable scientist, Steve was never
afraid to stand up for his beliefs, to
communicate science, and to en
gage the media about the risks of
climate change," Anderegg added.
"But more than that, Steve was a
great person unflinchingly hon
est, caring, passionate."

Although climate science has
made vast advances in recent
decades, Schneider was among early
advocates and pushed for the cause
long before it began to gain popular
momentum. In these efforts, stu
dents and professors credit his
tenacity and dedication to a goal.

"What I remember most is his
incredible passion and dedication
to the cause of trying to change the
world and making it a better place,"
said Woods Institute director Jeff
Koseff. "He was untiring, and com
pletely and utterly dedicated to the
cause."

"I think more than anything, he
was a great catalyst and lightning
rod, whether you agreed with him
or not, to get us to confront the real
possibility of climate change, get
ting us to focus on the issue and de-
