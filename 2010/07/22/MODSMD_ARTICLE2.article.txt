## Passing of a legend 
### ELLEN HUET JANE LEPHAM 
At a high-caliber research uni
versity such as Stanford, professors
are often valued as much for their
scholarship as they are for their
teaching talents and personal rela
tionships with students and other
faculty. In Stephen H. Schneider,
however, the University had a
member whose contributions to the
University spanned both, combin
ing a shared passion for a cause
with highly respected scientific re
search and influence.

Schneider, a biology professor,
Woods Institute senior fellow and
one of the world's leading climatol
ogists, died on Monday at 65 from a
heart attack while flying from
Stockholm to London.

Over his full and prominent ca
reer, Schneider pioneered tirelessly

for recognition and swift action to
address climate change, pushing re
search as well as public awareness
and leading many other scientists to
explore the issue.

Schneider, who came to Stan
ford in 1992, had an influence that
reached far beyond the walls of the
Farm. His 40-year career included
advising the Nixon, Carter, Rea
gan, Clinton, both Bush and
Obama administrations, as well as
Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger.
He also played a pivotal role in the
2007 Nobel Peace Prize as lead sci
entist on the United Nations Inter
national Panel on Climate Change,
which shared the prize with A1
Gore.

As a researcher, Schneider was
well known for his vocal and wide
spread approach to climate change.
Aside from more than 450 scientif
ic articles and more than 200 book

reviews, editorials and other works,
he was a frequent contributor to
popular media such as "Nova" and
"The Today Show."

But however prestigious his in
volvement outside of the Universi
ty, Schneider will be best remem
bered at Stanford as approachable,
passionate and knowledgeable, and
as an invaluable mentor.
"Professor Steve Schneider was
a legend on campus," wrote
William Anderegg, one of his grad
uate students, in an e-mail to The
Daily.

"A brilliant, funny and indefati
gable scientist, Steve was never
afraid to stand up for his beliefs, to
communicate science, and to en
gage the media about the risks of
climate change," Anderegg added.
"But more than that, Steve was a
great person unflinchingly hon
est, caring, passionate."

Although climate science has
made vast advances in recent
decades, Schneider was among early
advocates and pushed for the cause
long before it began to gain popular
momentum. In these efforts, stu
dents and professors credit his
tenacity and dedication to a goal.

"What I remember most is his
incredible passion and dedication
to the cause of trying to change the
world and making it a better place,"
said Woods Institute director Jeff
Koseff. "He was untiring, and com
pletely and utterly dedicated to the
cause."

"I think more than anything, he
was a great catalyst and lightning
rod, whether you agreed with him
or not, to get us to confront the real
possibility of climate change, get
ting us to focus on the issue and de-
