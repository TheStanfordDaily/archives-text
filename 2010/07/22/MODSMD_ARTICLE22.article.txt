# Competitive cheer can stand on its own
## 
### KEVIN ZHANG 
Each year during football season, it is the cheerlead
ers not the players themselves who are
putting themselves in more danger. According to a
2008 report by the National Center for Cata
strophic Sport Injury Research, cheerleading
made up 65.1 percent of all catastrophic sports injuries among
high school females over the past 25 years.
I find the current status of cheerleading, particularly high
school cheerleading, in serious need of improvement. Why
are diligent, athletic girls risking their future well-being only
to be relegated to the sidelines of a bigger show? Why are
these potential stars sacrificing so much only to be left off the
field when society has fought so hard to bring them onto it?
There is no doubt cheerleaders can be amazing athletes.
But with the current status of cheerleading, these guys and
girls are not reaching their potential.

Cheerleaders go through classic routines with the same
arm movements and cliched cheers each year. They put Vase
line on their teeth in order to plant smiles on their faces, even
when the team they are cheering for is down 49-0. They look
at the crowd with these fake smiles, when the crowd isn't even
looking at them.

Why do cheerleaders with giant egos work so hard to try to
be on the squad, constantly in fear of losing a spot or making
a mistake in front of a crowd? Why are these young girls wear
ing skirts in freezing weather and wearing no protective gear
when they are participating in gravity-defying stunts?
The underlying point is that the current goal of cheerlead
ing to raise the spirits of the crowd and try to help the foot
ball team win —is misguided. Cheerleading, especially in
high school, does not focus enough on competitions. It defi
nitely has great potential to be an amazing activity for young
girls and boys, but today cheerleading is not where it should
be.

Instead, today's high school cheerleading is an activity of
athletic girls and some guys, showcasing the same old routines
and yelling the same cheers, which ultimately accomplishes as
much for the football team as the vendors selling hot dogs in
the crowd.

Cheerleading was put in place to get girls involved when
girls weren't active in sports and enable them to excite audi

ences in order to help teams win. Nowadays, we don't just
have women competing for teams. We have women owning
teams. Nowadays, we don't just have women surviving in
sports. We have women thriving in sports. Nowadays, we
don't just have women athletes. We have genuine heroines.
Despite the great social progress that women's sports have
made in recent years, however, controversy remains. Just yes
terday, U.S. District Judge Stefan Underhill ruled that com
petitive cheerleading is not a college sport because of the un
derdevelopment of cheerleading.

The ruling was in response to a case brought by Quinnipi
ac University volleyball players and a coach because the uni
versity replaced volleyball with competitive cheerleading. Ac
cording to the university, the switch is in compliance with Title
IX, a 1972 federal law that mandates equal educational and
athletic opportunities for students of both genders.
Underhill, however, rejected Quinnipiac's reorganization
on the basis that competitive cheer isn't yet a proper sport in
the same way as volleyball.

I agree with one part of his statement and disagree with the
other. I disagree that competitive cheerleading is not a sport
and believe that it is a sport one of the most difficult sports,
at that. It is truly amazing to see a team of athletes perform
giant acrobatic stunts. However, I couldn't agree more with
Underbill's assertion that cheerleading is undeveloped and
needs improvements.

There is no doubt that improvements have been made to
the sport of cheerleading. With the addition of men providing
solid foundations for pyramids, cheerleading has become
safer. The adoption of certain requirements, such as a certain
GPA and community service hours, has encouraged cheer
leaders to be active in their school or community as leaders,
not just followers. It is fantastic that competitive cheerleading
has gained popularity and that it has become significantly
more co-ed. Also, many cheerleaders have become extreme
ly influential leaders in society.

However, there are just too many cheerleaders, especially
in high school, who are not accomplishing what they can and
should. Advancements could help cheerleading to be seen as
a legitimate activity of its own whether it's a "sport" or not
and less of sideshow for something else.

Kevin Zhang wants you to help him make a human pyramid.
