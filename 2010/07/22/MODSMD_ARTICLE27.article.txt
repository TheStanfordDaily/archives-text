## MOVIE REVIEW Inception brings summer thrills 
### â€“ laura MALKIEWICH contact laura: Imalkiew @stanford. edu 
Summer is a time when mediocre,
action-packed blockbusters, so
worn out that plot lines and char
acters get to feeling repetitive and
drab, fill the screen. However,
Christopher Nolan's latest film,
"Inception," promises and delivers a
summer thriller that will both enter
tain you and have you thinking like it's
fall quarter finals.
The key to the uncontested success
of "Inception" is the utter depth of the
film. It starts with an all-star lineup
including Leonardo DiCaprio
("Shutter Island"), Ellen Page ("Juno"),
Joseph Gordon-Levitt ("(500) Days of
Summer"), Marion Cotillard ("La Vie
en Rose") and Gillian Murphy

("Batman Begins"), who more than do
their part living up to their previously
acquired acclaim. Then add in great
action sequences where the audience is
on the edge of its seat, praying for the
lives of brilliant characters that make
you smirk from the minute they walk
on screen. Finally, sprinkle on a good,
complicated love story to satisfy all the
romantics in the audience and you
have a killer film. What really makes
"Inception" stand out, though, is its
ability to go beyond great plot, charac
ters and cast. This film will literally
blow you mind and change the way
you think about your life.
