## MOVIE REVIEW Inception brings summer thrills 
### â€“ laura MALKIEWICH contact laura: Imalkiew @stanford. edu 
Summer is a time when mediocre,
action-packed blockbusters, so
worn out that plot lines and char
acters get to feeling repetitive and
drab, fill the screen. However,
Christopher Nolan's latest film,
"Inception," promises and delivers a
summer thriller that will both enter
tain you and have you thinking like it's
fall quarter finals.
The key to the uncontested success
of "Inception" is the utter depth of the
film. It starts with an all-star lineup
including Leonardo DiCaprio
("Shutter Island"), Ellen Page ("Juno"),
Joseph Gordon-Levitt ("(500) Days of
Summer"), Marion Cotillard ("La Vie
en Rose") and Gillian Murphy

("Batman Begins"), who more than do
their part living up to their previously
acquired acclaim. Then add in great
action sequences where the audience is
on the edge of its seat, praying for the
lives of brilliant characters that make
you smirk from the minute they walk
on screen. Finally, sprinkle on a good,
complicated love story to satisfy all the
romantics in the audience and you
have a killer film. What really makes
"Inception" stand out, though, is its
ability to go beyond great plot, charac
ters and cast. This film will literally
blow you mind and change the way
you think about your life.

Leonardo DiCaprio and Ellen Page star in Christopher Nolan's thriller about the inner workings of the human
mind. In the film, DiCaprio's Cobb leads Page's Ariadne and an expert team into a target's subconscious.
Without giving away too much
of the plot, I will say that
"Inception" is one of those defin
ing movies that deals with theories
of perception, dreams, and the
mind in such away that everybody
walking out of the theater is
secretly asking themselves if they
really exist. Much like "Vanilla
Sky" or "The Matrix," "Inception"
uses science fiction to make the
audience think deeply about living
in the "real world" and what
morality really means. It even
ends with one of those great ambi
guities where everyone has their

own little interpretation of what
happens. I would even suggest
looking at back-to-back showings
so you can see it twice in a row.

So what makes "Inception"
stand out from the other great,
similarly themed movies that have
come before it? Well first of all,
unlike "The Matrix," the romantic
aspect of "Inception" adds to,
rather than weighs down, the rest
of the movie. The pacing is also
well done. There's enough intrigue
to keep you riveted yet not so much
mystery that you get frustrated, or
confused ... or need a sequel.
Even though it runs 142 minutes,
the movie does not feel long at all.
There is not a dull moment of dia
logue in the film.
So if you haven't seen

"Inception," get on it fast. You're
better off getting the most out of
the film knowing nothing about
the plot going into it. And consid
ering the fact that you're going to
want to see it a second or third
time anyway, there is no point in
wanting to know anything before
hand in order to "understand
what's going on." Most of all, all
your friends will be talking about
this movie all summer and you're
not going to be part of the conver
sation until September or until
you go see it for yourself. So put
down this paper, take a breath and
go get incepted.
