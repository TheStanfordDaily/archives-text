## A 						guide to summer food

It's summer. If you're at
Stanford, you're probably
reveling in the lack of home
work, the beautiful weather (no
more rain!) and the unbelievably
awkward on-campus parties.
Unfortunately, odds are that
you're also still reveling in Stern
Dining. Or perhaps more terri
fyingly, you've ended up some
where with your own kitchen,
thrown into the dangerous
experiment of cooking for your
self for the first time ever.
Bummer. On the flip side, this is
definitely the best season for eat
ing in Northern California. So
many things are in season and

the weather's perfect for picnick
ing, grilling and endless outdoor
dinners. So here's a guide to my
favorite easy-to-find summer
foods around Stanford:

Draeger's Potato Salad: Potato
salad is the quintessential sum
mer food fluffy, light, impos
sible to hate. My favorite is the
potato salad sold at Draeger's, a
super yuppy grocery store in
downtown Menlo Park. This
stuff might not be the smartest
thing to eat during bikini season,
but it's too good to pass up.
Draeger's also has awesome
chocolate chip cookies (but
maybe steer clear of the gro
ceries themselves they make
Whole Foods look bargain base
ment).

Sprinkles key lime cupcakes: I'm
not always super partial to
Sprinkles cupcakes; I think the
frosting can be way too sweet
and tar-like, but their seasonal
flavor right now is key lime and
it's addictive. These cupcakes are
light, slightly tart and perfect for
summer afternoons in the office.
Plus, flexible summer schedules
are totally conducive to
Sprinkles' amazing daily give
aways. If you "like" the Sprinkles
Facebook page, you get access to
"secret words" posted each clay,
which you can whisper at any
location for a free cupcake (but
hurry they usually sell out of
freebies early in the day!).

Shaved ice from L'Amour: A lot
of people associate shaved ice
with run-down carnivals; I defi
nitely did before I tried this.
Sweetened with condensed milk
and topped with fresh fruit,
L'Amour soaks its ice with more
sophisticated flavored syrups

than you'd find at the county
fair. Perfect for when the tem
perature reaches triple digits.

"Fred Steak" from Schaub's
Meats: This is an institution in
my family, tri-tip steak coated in
a top-secret marinade named for
the market's founder, Fred.
Fred Steak has been around for
fifty years (Fred himself is sadly
no longer with us, though his
image lives on in Schaub's "Fred
Steak" t-shirts and aprons), and
the exact ingredients are still a
mystery I think it might be
some mix of brown sugar, pome
granate and soy sauce but we'll
probably never know. Anyway,
it's unbelievably yummy. Added
bonus: Schaub's Meats is just
around the corner from
Sprinkles Cupcakes at the
Stanford Shopping Center (now
if only they also gave away free
steak everyday via secret words
on Facebook . . . ).

Anything from a local farmers'
market: Summer is go time for
farmers' markets. So much
amazing produce is in season
and it's perfect weather to walk
from booth to booth sampling
everything. Three pretty great
farmers' markets operate near
campus: California Ave. in Palo
Alto (Sundays, 9 a.m.-l p.m.),
downtown Menlo Park
(Saturdays, 9 a.m.-l p.m.) and
East Palo Alto (Saturdays, 2
p.m.-5 p.m. this one is small
er, but going here supports a
really critical community asset).
Right now, mission figs, cherries,
peaches, heirloom tomatoes and
strawberries are all in season.
