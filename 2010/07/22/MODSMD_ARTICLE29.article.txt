## A
						Bar-Be-Question — What's the Best BBQ Around? 
### – tommy TOBIN contact tommy: ttobin@ stanford. edu 
As a Southerner, I take
my barbeque seriously.
Coming to California for
college, I didn't know what to
expect —no sweet tea, a
dearth of chicken & dumplin's
and no Cracker Barrel for
hundreds of miles.
Fortunately, I've survived,
thanks in no small part to San
Jose's barbeque scene.
What follows is a decidedly
personal account of one man
and three barbeque places, a
story of adventure, generous
portions and numerous sets of
ribs for my pleasure. It's a tale
of intrigue and personal dis
covery.

Blue Rock BBQ — 3001
Meridian Ave.
7.5/10, $
The Blue Rock BBQ brings
me back. Similar to a barbeque
joint I enjoyed in Auburn,
Alabama, the Blue Rock has
diners order at a counter,
greatly raising the levels of
anticipation. You can see into
the kitchen. You know your
food is coming. Should you
wait and watch no, the wait
is too much.
The decor of the place feels
a little industrial. The propri

etors have attempted to add a
Southern flair to the eatery,
but it falls flat, too new to feel
homey. The ceilings are too
high and the facility too new to
really feel like a "down-home"
restaurant. The strip mall
parking, however, is plentiful.
Rated the best BBQ in
Silicon Valley by the Metro, an
area weekly, several times over
the past few years, Blue Rock's
BBQ food is indeed delicious.
My pulled pork was succulent
and scrumptious and the mac
aroni & cheese was thick,
gooey goodness. Menu choice
is somewhat limited, but you
should stick to the pulled pork
or ribs. I really liked the baked
beans, the best part of the
meal.
All in all, Blue Rock is a
solid choice for a BBQ
evening.
Sam's BBQ — 1110 S. Bascom
Ave.
1/10, $-$$
Sam's tries too hard to be
Southern. My brother and I
were excited by the restau
rant's "country" flair, com
