## A 						Bar-Be-Question — What's the Best BBQ Around? 
### – tommy TOBIN contact tommy: ttobin@ stanford. edu 
As a Southerner, I take
my barbeque seriously.
Coming to California for
college, I didn't know what to
expect —no sweet tea, a
dearth of chicken & dumplin's
and no Cracker Barrel for
hundreds of miles.
Fortunately, I've survived,
thanks in no small part to San
Jose's barbeque scene.
What follows is a decidedly
personal account of one man
and three barbeque places, a
story of adventure, generous
portions and numerous sets of
ribs for my pleasure. It's a tale
of intrigue and personal dis
covery.

Blue Rock BBQ — 3001
Meridian Ave.
7.5/10, $
The Blue Rock BBQ brings
me back. Similar to a barbeque
joint I enjoyed in Auburn,
Alabama, the Blue Rock has
diners order at a counter,
greatly raising the levels of
anticipation. You can see into
the kitchen. You know your
food is coming. Should you
wait and watch no, the wait
is too much.
The decor of the place feels
a little industrial. The propri

etors have attempted to add a
Southern flair to the eatery,
but it falls flat, too new to feel
homey. The ceilings are too
high and the facility too new to
really feel like a "down-home"
restaurant. The strip mall
parking, however, is plentiful.
Rated the best BBQ in
Silicon Valley by the Metro, an
area weekly, several times over
the past few years, Blue Rock's
BBQ food is indeed delicious.
My pulled pork was succulent
and scrumptious and the mac
aroni & cheese was thick,
gooey goodness. Menu choice
is somewhat limited, but you
should stick to the pulled pork
or ribs. I really liked the baked
beans, the best part of the
meal.
All in all, Blue Rock is a
solid choice for a BBQ
evening.
Sam's BBQ — 1110 S. Bascom
Ave.
1/10, $-$$
Sam's tries too hard to be
Southern. My brother and I
were excited by the restau
rant's "country" flair, com


TIM LEE/MCT
plete with a toy train running
throughout the eatery's trim of
the ceiling. They had sweet tea,
plain chairs and tables, and a
solid ranking in the Metro's
"best of BBQ" section.
Disappointment enveloped
our excitement for the accou
trements as the waitress at the
counter was positively rude.
When asked if we could substi
tute onion rings as a side for our
rib combo meal, she not only
said no and stared at us as if we
idiots but also blurted, "Onion
rings come in their own basket!"
We thought she was joking, a lit
tle Southern-style sarcasm, but
the silence for the next 20 sec
onds confirmed that she was
serious.

In short, don't waste your
money or time at Sam's BBQ. I
simply cannot fathom why Metro
ranked them so high. Of course,
I may be an idiot I didn't
know that onion rings required
their own sovereign basket.
The food was gross. The tea
was oversweet. The barbeque
sauce tasted like Burger King
Bronco sauce from years ago.
There were two types of baked
beans that we had inadvertently

ordered, both by saying "the
baked beans, please." One type
was virtually inedible and the
other was decent, not good.
Our waitress at the counter
style restaurant hovered over us
the entire meal, staring and
cleaning in our vicinity. This
made us not only feel unwel
come but nervous, especially as
we did not like any of the food
presented.
Henry's Hi-Life 301 W St
John St.
9/10, sss
Profiled on the Travel
Channel's "Man v. Food,"
Henry's Hi-Life is a rib-lover's
dream. Tucked behind the HP
Pavilion, Henry's is a great place
to grab a drink and watch the
Sharks. Their front area has a
loud, homey sports-bar. But it's
also more than that —it has
become a place for my brother
and me to relish in our love of
BBQ.

You walk in, take a number
and order from the host. The
menu is written on a wooden
board at the entrance to the sit
down portion of the restaurant.
This is not the kind of place to
order fettuccini alfredo it's an
unbridled meat-lover's paradise.
You wait as they prepare your
food, then you get ushered into
the back and presented with an

over-dressed salad. This is a very
casual restaurant, no need to
over-dress.
Henry's ribs are simply
incredible, served wet to whet
your appetite and prepared with
brown sugar. The bones come
clean out of the rib, leaving you
with a heaping helping of rib
meat to chow on. The half-slab
should fit most people's
appetites, about 6-8 inches of rib.
For the adventurous, the full
slab is gargantuan, about 12
inches of ribs. Each order is
pared with garlic bread and a
baked potato.
Henry's BBQ sauce will keep
you coming back for more. Not
only is it a good clip for the gar
lic bread, but it is fascinating to
determine its component parts.
My guess is that it is a ketchup
based sauce.

True, the place is on the
pricey side, approximately $2O
- but it's worth it for both the
challenge of eating so many ribs
and the melt-in-the-mouth fla-

vor-packed punch of the meat.
Henry's Hi-Life allows me to
reconnect with my Southern
BBQ heritage out here in
California. The ribs have kept
me coming back for more at
least fifteen times!
