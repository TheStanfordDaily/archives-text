## Test can predict success of IVF 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Buyan Pan 
Obstetrics and gynecology Profes
sor Mylene Yao and her team of re
searchers at the School of Medicine
have developed a formula to predict
whether fertility treatments will be
successful on couples, more accurate
ly than through looking at age alone.
The test indicates whether a couple
would be successful in going through
in vitro fertilization (IVF).
In the past, doctors have had diffi
culty accurately assessing success
rates using traditional tests, which
have evaluated patients based on age
alone, Flowever, the new test involves
evaluating several factors, such as the
woman's age, her hormonal response
to the IVF process, and the implanta
tion and growth rate of the fetus.
The research team looked at past
data from more than 5,000 IVF cycles
performed at Stanford Hospital from
2003 to 2008, and compared how suc
cessful each treatment was. According
to the team, collecting a vast amount of
data from one IVF attempt leaves use
ful reference for future cycles.
In an interview with Reuters, Yao
said that two percent of all infertile
couples are treated with IVF, and that
the market is growing, with one per
cent of newborns in the United States
born through the treatment.
To make the new test widely avail

able, Yao's group has founded a new
company called Univfy to commer
cialize the test. The University has li
censed the model test, and the team is
awaiting approval from the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration to market
the test by this fall.
