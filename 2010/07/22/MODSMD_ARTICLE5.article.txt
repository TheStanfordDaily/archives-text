# Study shows racial bias among online buyers
## 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Joseph Beyda 
According to a recent Stanford
study, online shoppers are more will
ing to buy goods from a white seller
than a black one, and will tend to pay
white sellers more money.
Researchers Jennifer Doleac and
Luke Stein, doctoral candidates in
economics, posted ads on classified
advertising websites to conduct the
yearlong study. Some of the ads fea
tured a light hand holding an iPod
nano, while others featured a dark
hand holding the same product.
The ads with a black hand were 13
percent less likely to receive responses
and were offered from two to four per
cent less than the ads with a white hand.
The study also found that the gap
depended on the geographic location
of the ad. While black sellers got 32
percent less offers than whites in the
Northeast, there was little discrepan
cy in the West. Other factors, such as
crime rates and racial separations in
the given area, had an effect on the
amount of money offered to each of
the hands.
"The fact that we found this much
evidence of racial discrimination in this
population of people is striking,"
Doleac told the Stanford News Service.

Doleac also expressed concern
that the effect is smaller with the well
educated, young group of people that
would be likely to stumble upon the
Internet ads, and that the disparities
would be greater in the general popu
lation.
