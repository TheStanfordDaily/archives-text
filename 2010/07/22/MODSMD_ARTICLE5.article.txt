### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Joseph Beyda 
According to a recent Stanford
study, online shoppers are more will
ing to buy goods from a white seller
than a black one, and will tend to pay
white sellers more money.
Researchers Jennifer Doleac and
Luke Stein, doctoral candidates in
economics, posted ads on classified
advertising websites to conduct the
yearlong study. Some of the ads fea
tured a light hand holding an iPod
nano, while others featured a dark
hand holding the same product.
The ads with a black hand were 13
percent less likely to receive responses
and were offered from two to four per
cent less than the ads with a white hand.
The study also found that the gap
depended on the geographic location
