## Random student audits a possibility, says dean of Undergraduate Admission 
### AN LE NGUYEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
This fall the Office of Undergrad
uate Admission is expected to main
tain the status quo save for two
main changes. The office will bring
on board a newly revamped admis
sions staff after losing seven admis
sions officers this year, and will de
cide whether or not to put a random
auditing system in place.
The latter change likely stems
from Stanford's admission of Adam
B. Wheeler, the ousted Harvard stu
dent who falsified his college appli
cations and nabbed more than
$45,000 in scholarships and financial
aid. Stanford has since rescinded
Wheeler's acceptance.
Richard Shaw, dean of Under
graduate Admission, declined to
comment on Adam Wheeler's con
nection to Stanford, citing guidelines
that prevent the disclosure of an in
dividual applicant's personal infor
mation. However, the Huffington
Post last month reported that Shaw
confirmed Wheeler's admission to a
Harvard detective.

Shaw was more open about the
means by which Stanford plans to
prevent similar incidents from oc
curring in the future.
"We are actually engaged in the
consideration of audits of our under

graduate student body," Shaw said
of the Office of Undergraduate Ad
mission.

"The issue of dishonesty and
forgery on the national level is of
concern," he added. "I don't think
it's widespread, but it certainly
brings our attention to the need to
implement [or] think about imple
menting procedures that would re
sult in random audits."
Shaw said that his office is exam
ining the merit of random audits this
summer and might "over the next
period of time implement something
like that even through next year."
The introduction of such precau
tions, however, may prove to be a
double-edged sword. For Shaw, it's a
balancing act between two princi
ples: trust and vigilance.
The admissions office lives by the
tenet that most students tell "the
whole truth and nothing but the
truth" when they sign off on their ap
plications, Shaw said. However, he
acknowledged that young people are
dishonest from time to time, and that
his office is cautious about stamping
out such behaviors.
"It's an awesome task to hold ac
countable 32,000 applicants," Shaw
said.

Aside from the possibility of a
new auditing system, the Office of
Undergraduate Admission will also

welcome several new faces to its staff
this fall, following the departure of
seven admissions officers during the
2009-10 academic year.
The most publicized departures
were those of former Director of
Admission Shawn Abbott and for
mer Assistant Dean of Admission
Dan Warner. Abbott left to serve as
the new assistant vice president for
undergraduate admissions at New
York University. Warner opted to
become the new director of admis
sion at Rice University.
Of the remaining departures,
three elected to attend graduate
school, one chose to become a de
partment chair at a secondary school
and one will serve on the administra
tive staff of Semester at Sea.

Although losing seven staff mem
bers is a higher-than-usual turnover
rate, Shaw noted that departures
are, in general, normal. Younger
staff members commit to a minimum
of two years with the Office of Un
dergraduate Admission, oftentimes
to "determine whether they want to
go to graduate school or try some
thing else," Shaw said.
"I had a wonderful experience at
Stanford and enjoyed every aspect
of my life on the Farm," Abbott
wrote in an e-mail to The Daily, sup
porting Shaw's claim. "My move to
NYU was only inspired by my desire
to take on a more significant leader
ship role within a university that isn't

already at the top."
Shaw said that losing seven of 25
admissions officers would not pose
any difficulties this upcoming school
year.
"With 18 onboard who can pro
vide continuity, I think we'll be just
fine," Shaw said. "We've hired a
spectacular new group ... who are
extremely intelligent and capable. I

think they'll all hit the ground run
ning."
The admissions office, however,
still is looking for Abbott's replace
ment. The search for a director of
admission, Shaw said, is a longer
one.
