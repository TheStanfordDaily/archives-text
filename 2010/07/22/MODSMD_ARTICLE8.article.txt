## Univ. water use eyed for improvement Stanford ramps up efforts to conserve more water, be eco-friendly 
### UTTARA SIVARAM DAILY INTERN 
Building on a history of sustainable lead
ership, and in the wake of recent Bay Area
droughts, Stanford is ramping up efforts to
conserve water and adopt eco-friendly prac
tices around campus.
Stanford, looking to be a role model for
the community, has set for itself a number of
key goals to preserve the valuable resource.
The University meets the restrictions of both
the General Use Permit (GUP) under Santa
Clara County and also the San Francisco
Public Utilities Commission (SFPUC), which
allocates 3.033 million gallons per day to the
campus.
Currently, Stanford receives potable
water from the SFPUC, which in turn collects
water from the Hetch Fletchy Reservoir in
the Sierra Nevada and other local water
sheds.

Stanford's history of water consumption is
notable, as the University has made a marked
effort to decrease the water usage in individ-
ual, day-to-day functions. Due to
Stanford's constantly expanding
campus, it has implemented more
stringent guidelines for its new
buildings.
In new residential and public
bathroom faucets, for example,
Stanford aims to decrease its con
sumption from 2.2 gpm (gallons per
minute) to 0.5 gpm with its newly en
gineered water-efficient equipment.
The standard 1.6 gpf (gallons per
flush) of public toilets are expected
to reduce to 1.28 gpf with these con
servational practices.
Stanford has additionally spon
sored environmentally conscious
student-run organizations around
campus, notably Students for a Sus
tainable Stanford (SSS). As both co
president of SSS and head of the SSS
"Water Group," Siddhartha Oza 'll
has closely observed the Universi
ty's public water system and has
been impressed with its efforts to
conserve water around campus.
"The University has provided
funding in the past for student initia
tives seeking to save water," Oza
said. "As a result, Students for a Sus
tainable Stanford was able to install
a rainwater catchment system for a
house on the Row, saving gallons of
usable water that would otherwise
have flowed into drains."

In addition to student-run organi
zations, Stanford has provided for a
24-hour maintenance hotline allow
ing students to immediately contact
help about broken sprinkler heads
or unnecessary water waste that they
have noticed. Oza's own experience
with the hotline was positive. He
said that a semi-leaky faucet in his
dorm was fixed within a day of his
call.

"Stanford is remarkably efficient
with its water supplies," Oza said.
"[Stanford's] water conservation

program has reduced usage by 15
percent of the past eight years, and
that statistic is certainly believable."
Oza also explained that Stanford
has implemented low-flow shower
heads in dorms, trayless dining halls,
dual-flush toilets and no-flush uri
nals in restrooms, high-efficiency
clothes washing machines and sprin
kler systems set to water plants at
night to limit evaporation.
Yashraj Narang 'll has also no
ticed Stanford's environmentally
conscious practices, including that
there were no water fountains in his
dorm, Crothers Hall.

"Crothers was renovated before
last year; I believe they had water
fountains before then," Narang said.
"When last year began, Stanford
Housing told all of us that we should
get water from the sinks instead, and
they gave us free water bottles to
make it easier to do so."

But these changes were not uni
versally popular.
"Both the trayless policy and the
lack of water fountains met resis
tance when students first found out
about them," Narang said.
The inconvenience of constantly
having to buy or fill water bottles
irked many students, but Narang
said he was not fazed.

"l don't see [it] as being a major
setback in my daily life," he said.
"Honestly, if Stanford is saving
thousands of gallons of water by im
plementing these changes, I think
they're a good idea."
By targeting individual depart
ments and constructing realistic
guidelines that will still satisfy the
needs of particular buildings, Stan
ford has earned awards such as the
Clean Bay Award and the 2009 Sili
con Valley Water Conservation
Award in the Large Organization
category.
However, Stanford has not al
ways been successful in its attempts
to make the campus more eco
friendly the Y2E2 building, also
known as the Jerry Yang & Akiko
Yamazaki Environment and Energy

Building, was hailed as a major step
forward in recognizing and resolving
today's ecological problems, but met
with criticism after a report stated
that the energy consumption initial

ly projected by the building's cre
ators was much lower than the actu
al energy consumption.
In Oza's words, "Much has been
accomplished, but there are still op

portunities for the University to
shrink its freshwater footprint."
