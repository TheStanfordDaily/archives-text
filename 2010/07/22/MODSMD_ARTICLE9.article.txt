## Alumni flock to see professors at Stanford's eDay 
### JOSEPH BEYDA DAILY INTERN 
For Marissa Mayer '97, M.S. '99,
one of the most important things
about a job is working with intelligent
people.

"When you work with the smartest
people you can find," she said, "it re
ally challenges you to push yourself."
And there was no shortage of
bright minds at the School of Engi
neering's 11th annual eDay, which
brought over 500 alumni and family
members back to campus on July 17 to
take classes on this year's theme of
"Techxtravaganza."
A number of Stanford professors
and Mayer, the keynote speaker and
vice president of Search Products and
User Experience at Google, taught
the "Techxtravaganza" classes, which
drew upon this year's focus on electri
cal engineering and computer science.
Tickets for eDay sold out two days
before the event started, which Nancy
Peterson, the school's director of
communications and alumni rela
tions, attributed to the amount of in
terest from former Stanford students.
"People want to be lifelong learn
ers," she said. "They want to be famil
iar with what's going on with research,
and they're interested in knowing
who the faculty [members] are."
Some of those faculty members of
fered groundbreaking ideas with the
potential for worldwide impact. Bala
ji Prabhakar, professor of electrical
engineering and computer science,
explained the success that a lottery
like system could have with waste re
duction in a "Societal Network" such
as transportation or healthcare. Dan
Boneh, also a professor of electrical
engineering and computer science,
presented ways in which the technolo
gy involved in social networking secu
rity could be improved to reveal less
information to third parties.

Other classes, geared primarily to
ward the nearly 250 children at the
event, gave a basic introduction to en
gineering and programming. Com
puter science professor Mehran Saha
mi taught simple programming skills
using a robot named Karel, while elec
trical engineering professor Brad Os
good used clips from "Lord of the
Rings," as well as the sound produced
by his trombone, to help children un
derstand the ways in which communi
cation could work.
In her keynote address, Mayer en
couraged the youth in attendance to
pursue a career in engineering.
"The amazing thing for me about
computer science," she told the audi
ence, "was that there was a new prob
lem every day."
Although children might not be
able to experience that sense of ex
citement and discovery every day,
their parents hope that they will in the
future. Peterson said that a large part
of the event's appeal each year is its in
clusion of children.
"Those who have children are in
terested in exposing them to the ex
citement of engineering, and that re
inforces the parents' interest in en
couraging the kids to study science
and math," she said.

Stanford students presented the
products of such studies in the form of
demos during the event's lunch break.
One stand allowed participants to
control robots using an Android
phone, while another featured a hap
tic device, which works like a 3D
mouse for entertainment and medical
purposes.
Each year, the School of Engineer
ing tries to find a theme that will in
volve more than one of its nine depart
ments, so as to include as many profes
sors as possible in eDay. Last year's
event, themed "Planet Green," com
bined the disciplines of materials sci
ence, chemical engineering, civil engi

neering and environmental engineer
ing. Although the idea of sustainability
was the primary focus last year, it still
had an influence on eDay 2010, as even
the silverware, cups and plates were re
placed by compostable equivalents.
The caliber of the presenting pro

fessors, many of them industry lead
ers, also draws alumni back to the
event. Although professors may not
initially know about eDay, they enjoy
the event once they have been asked
to speak, according to Peterson.
"If they've not participated, it's

hard for them to know what the expe
rience is to be on campus on a Satur
day with 500 people," she said. "And
they tend to find it really enjoyable."
