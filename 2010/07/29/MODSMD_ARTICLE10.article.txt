### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€” Nicola Park 
Stephen Kosslyn, currently Har
vard's dean of social science, will take
over as director of the Center for Ad
vanced Study in Behavioral Sciences
(CASBS) at Stanford on Jan. 1, 2011.
Kosslyn succeeds Iris Litt, current di
rector of CASBS and professor emeri
tus of pediatrics.
"It's an exciting opportunity," Koss
lyn wrote in an e-mail to The Daily.
"Not only can I help to strengthen one
of the world's most distinguished and
venerable institutions in the behavioral
sciences, but I also can help it grow in
new ways."
Kosslyn, also a psychology profes
sor, has been a pioneer in the field of
cognitive neuroscience and has exten
sively explored the nature of mental
imagery and visual perception and
communication. He has published
more than 300 scientific papers, written
or edited multiple books on the subject
of neuroscience and received numer

ous honors as a result of his research.
He received his B.A. degree in psychol
ogy from UCLA and Ph.D. in the same
subject from Stanford.
According to Kosslyn, his experi
ence stretches beyond psychology and
cognitive neuroscience.
"I've had experience working with
many types of scholars and researchers,
and have also had a fair amount of con
tact with the tech world," Kosslyn said.
"I've also had experience with fi
nances, which will no doubt be impor
tant for ensuring that the Center con
tinues to flourish."
Kosslyn sees a bright future for the
center.
"I think CASBS is poised to make
even greater contributions to society,
particularly at the interface of behav
ioral science and technology," he said.
CASBS, founded in 1954, has a stat
ed aim of sharing knowledge of human
behavior and providing a refuge for sci
entists and scholars to think and be ex
posed to a diverse array of ideas.
