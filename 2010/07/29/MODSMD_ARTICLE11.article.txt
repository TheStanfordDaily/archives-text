# Sewage research makes space for rocket science

### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€” Uttara Sivaram 
Anyone who thinks that sewage
treatment isn't rocket science may
have to think again.
University researchers have created
a new method of treating wastewater
that they say would have a positive en
vironmental impact and drastically
lower the cost of the expensive and in
efficient process. With the support of a
Woods Institute Environmental Ven
ture Projects grant, researchers Craig
Criddle and Brian Cantwell led the
venture.
Criddle is a civil and environmental
engineering professor and an expert in
wastewater management; Cantwell is
an aeronautics and astronautics profes
sor with interests ranging from fluid
mechanics to propulsion. While these
fields seem to hold little in common,
the researchers brought new meaning
to the word "interdisciplinary" by ap
plying rocket technology to sewage
treatment, aiming to make the process
energy-neutral and emissions-free.
"If the energy savings we envision
work out, then anyone designing a new
wastewater plant will have to seriously
consider our approach," Criddle said.
"In this case, the impact could be enor
mous."
The method uses anaerobic bacte
ria to convert sewage into two green
house gases, nitrous oxide and
methane gas. Aerobic bacteria re
quire oxygen through a process called
"aeration," in which air is pumped
into wastewater sludge, enabling the
bacteria to colonize and decompose
the waste. By using anaerobic, or oxy
gen-independent, bacteria, however,
the amount of air that must be
pumped decreases along with costs.
The resultant nitrous oxide and
methane complete the cyclic process,
as methane powers the treatment
plant while the nitrous oxide fuels a
rocket thruster. Intact, the nitrous
oxide is harmful, but after fueling the
thruster, it is converted into harmless

nitrogen and oxygen gas.
Ultimately, these gases are released
into the atmosphere, replenishing the
nitrogen supply that human activity has
depleted in processes such as the man
ufacture of agricultural fertilizer.
While the concept for this process
has generated significant buzz, the re
searchers haven't yet determined the
technology required for its execution.
"The application to nitrogenous
waste treatment could turn out to be
the most important result of our re
search," Cantwell said. "But there is
still much to learn about the underlying
physics of the decomposition process."
"I expect there will still be space ap
plications we have not envisioned yet,"
Griddle said.
