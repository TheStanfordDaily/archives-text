### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€” Marisa Landicho 
Currently on a larger tour of the
Bay Area and Silicon Valley, Basque
President Patxi Lopez visited campus
on Wednesday.
Lopez, who was elected the leader
of Spain's autonomous northern com
munity in May 2009, toured SLAC
National Accelerator Laboratory, the
main campus and the Center for Au
tomotive Research at Stanford
(CARS), and also met with Stanford
Provost John Etchemendy.
The visitors particularly enjoyed
seeing the solar car project and the
autonomous vehicle at the CARS fa
cility, according to Etchemendy. The
Basque delegation was interested in
discussing relations between Stan
ford and industry during the tour, and
the group also spoke with former
Provost William Miller and Luis
Mejia from the Office of Technology
Licensing.
Etchemendy's heritage and previ
ous statements on Basque politics
added nuance to his meeting with
Lopez, who is the first president to
openly oppose Basque independence
in thirty years.
Etchemendy, of Basque heritage,
has a history of promoting Basque
culture and awareness. He sponsored
the formation of an introductory
Basque studies course in 2006. He
also signed the March 2010 "Brussels
Declaration," which called for the ter
rorist and nationalist Euskadi Ta
Askatasuna (ETA) group to cease vi
olence permanently and also for reci
procation on the side of the Spanish
government.
Lopez's party, the Spanish Social
ist Party (PSOE) is against an inde
pendent Basque and has spoken out
against the Brussels Declaration.
"The declaration endorses the ini
tiation in the Basque country of a
peaceful process patterned on that
used to solve the conflict in Northern
Ireland," Etchemendy wrote in an e
mail to The Daily. He said his signa
ture was a personal endorsement.
"The desired outcome is to bring
to an end the use of violence as a
means to promote independence of
the Basque provinces from Spain," he
added.
