## Sights and smells of New Delhi Hitting the pavement in a 'tuk-tuk'

Navigating city streets with the
wind in your hair may come in the
form of a Mustang in Los
Angeles, a Porsche in Berlin or a
Ferrari in Rome. But in India, the
convertible is replaced by a half-size, three
wheeled taxi that many say offers a fuller trav
el experience than any roof-down car: the
auto-rickshaw.
"The auto is open all around no win
dows, no doors," touted Gopal Singh, the
owner of three auto-rickshaws that he man
ages at a taxi stand outside a New Delhi shop
ping center. "See everything, hear everything.
Better than a car."
Since its introduction in New Delhi in the
19705, the auto-rickshaw's apple-green car
riage and lemon-yellow roof have become
trademarks of urban transportation in India.
In the capital, the noisy, three-wheeled taxis
buzz like bees around every corner and at
every hour of the day. They are so abundant
that a spokesman for New Delhi's transport
department said he didn't think anyone in his
office had ever really tallied the "tens of thou
sands" of rickshaw permits filed in the city.
"Always find [an] auto," Singh said, leaning
on one of his own. "They are everywhere."
There's good reason for their omnipres
ence in urban India. A new auto-rickshaw
costs about $3,000, said Singh, an amount that
would seem high for a taxi operator were it not
for the vehicle's low maintenance cost and

long life. And the auto-rickshaw dominates
among urban taxis because of its small size,
allowing it to adeptly navigate city traffic.
"It's the way to go if you need to get some
where quick," said Arjun Hari, a New Delhi
banker who often has to be at lunch meetings
out of his office. "My work is just two kilome
ters away, but it takes forever if I'm not in an
auto. Plus, it's cheaper."
Though fare meters are built into most
auto-rickshaws, drivers rarely turn them on,
instead accepting whatever fare their passen
gers are willing to shell out. Locals say an easy
formula to follow is halving a normal taxi's
fare for the same distance.
"Really, you could give any fare," Hari
said. "If you don't know a normal taxi's fare to
split in half, you could just ballpark it. That's
the beauty of it."
For others, the beauty of the auto-rickshaw
is its versatility.
"I take it to work, I take it to lunch, I take
it to the market and then I take it home," said
Sheena Shah, an office assistant. "And when
[my friends and I] go out, we all squeeze into
one. There are no seatbelts or anything."
Indeed, the layout of the auto-rickshaw's
"interior" is as simple as they come. A bench
like seat for the driver, which can also fit a pas
senger, faces a pair of motorcycle handlebars
instead of a steering wheel. Behind, a passen
ger row can seat about four.
"And then we can sit on each other's laps,"
Shah laughed. "So really, it can probably fit
like eight people if you really wanted to pack
it in."
For tourists, who tend to visit the Indian
capital in fall and spring when the weather is
temperate, the auto-rickshaw is the preferred

mode of sightseeing, admitted Bhupinder
Singh, a four-door taxi driver in south New
Delhi.
"They like to see out, feel the wind, smell
the smells," Singh said.
And hear the noises. In fact, a nickname
often given to the auto-rickshaw is "tuk-tuk,"
for the noise emitted by its small motorcycle
engine.
"The sound is part of [the experience],"
said Ariel Tandler, an Australian tourist who
has mostly traveled by auto-rickshaw during
the week she's spent in New Delhi. "If one
really wants to absorb the culture and the

scenery, one must be exposed to it all."
That includes being exposed to the reality
that in the morning and early evening, flag
ging down a vacant auto-rickshaw may not be
easy.
"I think there's actually a skill to it. You
can position yourself ahead of the others on
the street, or some people actually stand a few
meters into the road so that they can jump into
the first one that drives up," Hari said.
"Really, it's all just part of the auto culture in
India."

An auto-rickshaw waits outside the World Trade Centre in New Delhi for a lunchtime
passenger. Nicknamed "tuk-tuk" for the noise of its engine, the three-wheeled auto-rickshaw
is the vehicle of choice for commuters and tourists wishing to weave through India's streets.
