## Financial forecast improving Cardinal Athletics says all programs safe, looks to improve broadcast deal 
### MARISA LANDICHO FEATURES EDITOR 
Stanford Athletics has regained its
financial footing at last, projecting a
balanced budget for the upcoming
2010-11 year its first balanced bud
get since the economic crisis in 2008.
To achieve this bottom line, however,
the Athletics Department will keep in
place the operating cuts from the past
two years.
"In order to balance the budget for
FYII, we have primarily maintained
previous budget saving measures and
have not undertaken many new, in
cremental cuts," wrote Stanford Ath
letics Chief Financial Officer Brian
Talbott in an e-mail to The Daily.
When the endowment dropped 27
percent in fiscal year 2009, the Ath
letics Department was faced with a $5
million shortfall.
Stanford Athletics responded by
eliminating 25 staff positions, freez
ing salaries and slashing travel and fa
cilities budgets, according to the

2010-11 budget. After cutting $1.6
million in FYO9 and an additional
$3.5 million in FYIO, the department
still operated at a loss of $1.51 million
in FYO9 and a projected $156,000 loss
forFYIO.
The cuts, however, were enough
to stave off eliminating any of Stan
ford's 35 varsity sports, although the
fencing program had to self-fundraise
its $250,000 operating cost in FYO9 to
keep varsity status.
For now, all the Cardinal sports
programs are safe.
"Given our current forecast, we
believe we will be able to balance our
budget and meet our financial obliga
tions without discontinuing any sport
programs," Talbott said.
At $85.7 million, the 2010-11
budget for Athletics operations and
financial aid makes up 9 percent of
the University's billion-dollar ad
ministrative and auxiliary unit ex
penses. Stanford Athletics is an aux
iliary unit of the University, mean
ing it is a self-contained entity that

runs on the revenues it generates.
According to Vice Provost for Bud
get and Auxiliaries Management
Tim Warner, all the revenues that
Stanford Athletics collects go
straight toward paying its own ex
penses.
"The basic idea is that [Athletics]
covers its costs, particularly the Inter
collegiate Program, with the rev
enues it raises through ticket sales,
TV revenue, fundraising, et cetera,"
Warner said.
Physical education and recreation
programs for the entire student body,
on the other hand, are supported by
the University's general fund.
Hopes of bolstering the depart
ment's budget now rest on the rene
gotiation of the broadcast deal once
the University's television contract
expires.
The addition of Colorado and
Utah to the Pac-10 is expected to help
Stanford work out a better television
deal. Earlier this month. Director of
Athletics Bob Bowlsy told The Daily

that the renegotiation of the media
contract is projected to increase fund
ing two- or three-fold.
But this won't occur for at least an
other year, according to Talbott.
"ft is unclear what impact the addi
tion of Colorado and Utah to the Pac
-10 will have on the conference's
broadcast revenue," he said. "Howev
er, we fully expect that when a new
deal goes into effect for FY 13 that we
will see a significant increase in broad
cast revenue over the current deal."
In the meantime, the drop in the

Athletics endowment will be most
critical for the athletic scholarship
budget, which is typically funded
through endowment payouts.
"Athletic scholarships are paid
through restricted endowments, so in
other words people will give a gift to
the endowment for a particular ath
letic scholarship as opposed to a gen
eral need-based scholarship," Warn
er said.
These endowments actually over


MARISA LANDICHO/The Stanford Daily
funded athletic scholarships in FYO9
and FYIO.
In FYII, however, $2.5 million
must be transferred from the operat
ing budget to the financial aid budget
to pay for the $19.6 million in schol
arships for varsity athletes. Athletic
scholarships have increased from
$18.9 million last year in accordance
with the tuition increase.
In the next few years, Talbott
said, the department will make a
fundraising push to bridge the finan
cial aid gap.
"We have a plan to raise $25 mil
lion in new scholarship endow
ments which, combined with mod
est increases in endowment pay
outs, will allow us to again fully
fund athletic scholarships through
endowment payouts within a few
years," he said.
