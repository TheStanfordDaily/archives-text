# Local star returns for chance in NBA

Jeremy Lin's basketball ca
reer began just a few miles away
from Stanford in a Palo Alto
YMCA gym. Now Lin's star is
rising as a new signee to the
Golden State Warriors but he
hasn't made it yet, he says.
Lin's story began as a standout
youngster. He took his talents to
Palo Alto High School, where, as
a senior in 2006, Lin led the squad
to a state championship over
powerhouse Mater Dei. Despite
averaging 15 points, seven assists,
six boards and five steals per
game, Lin did not earn a Division
I basketball scholarship. He was
accepted to Harvard on academ
ic merits and joined its squad.
The early years left an impres
sion on Palo Altans.
"I've known Jeremy for a long
time through church and he has
always been a great leader of my
youth group," said longtime
friend Elaine Liu, who attended
the Chinese Church in Christ
with Lin in Mountain View. "He
has always been a great listener
and inspiration at church."
Lin also inspired other former

Paly students, such as Patrick
Liu.
"It's amazing to have seen
such an amazing player develop
in such a short period of time,"
Liu said. "He's like a little home
town hero."
At Harvard, Lin began to gain
national attention. Playing main
ly as a point guard in his senior
season, Lin averaged 16.4 points,
4.5 assists, 4.4 rebounds and 2.4
steals and was unanimously se
lected for the All-Ivy League
First Team. After Lin's 30-point
performance against 12th-ranked
Connecticut, coach Jim Calhoun
said, "I've seen a lot of teams
come through here, and he could
play for any of them."
After four years at Harvard,
including three as a starter, Lin
graduated as the college's all
time leader in games played (115)
and fifth in points (1483).
Although Lin enjoyed a stellar
senior season at Harvard, he was
disappointed on draft day when
he wasn't selected in either
round. Donnie Nelson, the presi

As a guard at Harvard, Jeremy Lin, no. 4 above, made waves as one
of the school's best-ever players. The Paly alumnus will stay close to
home as he moves into the pros with the Golden State Warriors.
