# Cheating is a part of sports
## 
### TOM TAYLOR 
It's the last few seconds of the quarterfinal of
the World Cup. Tied 1-1 after regulation, the
opposing teams have already played through
most of the 30 minutes of additional time, and
the game looks certain to go to penalties.
As the clock ticks to zero, your team has one last
corner to defend and the opposition scrambles to
score the winner. The ball heads toward the net and
you find yourself standing on the goal line, the last
line of defense. What do you do?
Would you take the high road, desperately flailing
with your head and body as you attempt to save it
legally? Or would you realize this would only lead to
you watching the ball hit the back of the net and take
a more drastic move, punching it clear with your
hands? In short, would you cheat to keep your team
alive?
Luis Suarez faced exactly that situation in South
Africa, and his actions earned him a red card for a
clear breach of the rules, but also kept Uruguay in the
tournament at the expense of Ghana. The play was
shown over and over again on TV, and many lam
basted him for this clear case of gamesmanship. Few,
outside of his home country, accepted the notion that
he really had no choice.
So what would you have done? Is it ever OK to
cheat?
As Stanford students we are bound to abide by
both the Honor Code and the Fundamental Stan
dard in our time on the Farm. The former concen
trates solely on academic matters, and, I roughly
paraphrase, it says that students should not cheat or
knowingly allow others to cheat. The
latter sets a broader code of conduct
for students and stresses "respect for
order, morality, personal honor and
the rights of others."
In the extreme, breaking either of
these could lead to expulsion from the
University.

Most all Stanford students are
here for academics first, but for many
the athletic department is also a huge
part of their life. The demands of var
sity sports are no different than those
of professional sports, and so is the
pressure. Many student-athletes
across the country are quite literally
playing for their futures, and a bad
performance, or a string of them,
could lead to them losing their schol
arship, losing their education and los
ing everything they have worked and
trained so hard for.
A rare few succumb to this pres
sure and cheat in extreme ways: taking
steroids and illegal drugs that could di
rectly threaten their health, cynically
lashing out at their opposition when
the refs aren't looking, even taking
bribes to lose games. Most have been
involved in some form of gamesman
ship; all have turned a blind eye when
the referee has surprisingly given a
wrong call in their favor.
The exam hall is, though, no less
competitive than the sports field. Like
it or not, you are competing with every
one else in that room, hoping to be
graded ahead of the curve. Intimidat
ing other students, seeking to deceive
the examiners and gain an unfair ad
vantage or bringing in banned equip
ment would all be considered a breach
of the Honor Code and dealt with as
such. Knowing that someone else has
done any of these, but doing nothing,
would be viewed in a similar light.

Regardless of the setting, these
also break the spirit of the Fundamen
tal Standard, even if that setting is the
football field, baseball diamond or
basketball court. Staying silent when a
referee makes a mistake might be one
thing, knowing that one of your team
mates engineered that error through
deception or intimidation but still
keeping quiet is altogether more seri
ous. And before you view this as a rant
against athletes, I include all of you in
the stands, too.
Every fan has berated or at least
criticized a referee for a bad call that
has hurt their team. Few have done
the same when getting a lucky call.
Maybe they'll admit later, with some
embarrassment, that the referee got it
wrong, but they'll more than happily
reap the benefits from that mistake.
While blatant acts like Suarez's
"save" are comparatively rare, this
form of subtle dishonesty is deeply in
grained in all sports. The Flonor Code
and Fundamental Standard might
scream in protest, but the upside of
this is that the cheating is so wide
spread that the playing field remains
surprisingly level.
It's difficult to say it is alright to
cheat in sports, but trying to hold play
ers and fans to the same high stan
dards we supposedly set ourselves
away from the field seems an almost
impossible task. Perhaps Stanford's
code of conduct needs a get-out
clause, something to distinguish the
sports arena not just from the exam
hall but from the real world, too.
At the very least, we should re
member not to feel too wronged when
we are caught for some infringement
and not to be so outraged when our
opponents aren't.
Cheating might not be okay, but
it's a fact of (sporting) life.
