# MLB's integrity demands expanded use of replay
## 
### JOSEPH BEYDA 
Baseball is a game of mis
takes. Mistakes made by
pitchers lead to most
home runs in the major
leagues; mistakes made
by fielders (such as Bill Buckner's in
famous gaffe in Game 6 of the 1986
World Series) can give new life to
whoever's at the plate.
But the worst of all are mistakes
made by umpires.
Sports are built around the ideal
of fair competition, but when an of
ficial calls a play incorrectly, the
game doesn't meet this standard.
Luckily, most sports now use in
stant replay to ensure that officials
have made the right call. These
sports responsibly recognize that
referees are only human, employing
a backup plan to account for that in
important situations.
The list of such sports goes on
and on both the NFL and the US
Tennis Association use challenge
systems; NBA refs can check
whether shots got off in time, or
whether a shooter's foot is on the
three-point line; the NHL even has a
war-room set up in Toronto where
every goal scored in the league is re
viewed.
But that list has one conspicuous
absence baseball.
Though the MLB allows for in
stant replay on home-run calls, clos
er plays in the infield are left entire
ly up to the umpires.
And they don't always get it
right, either. Detroit Tigers pitcher
Armando Galarraga lost his perfect
game with two outs in the ninth on
June 2 when umpire Jim Joyce made
a bad call at first, while the San Fran
cisco Giants lost on July 18 after um
pire Phil Cuzzi missed a call on a
play at the plate.
Does it make any sense to reward
the team that should lose when there
are viable instant replay systems out
there, just waiting to be used?
The MLB did take a positive step
forward by instituting home run re
view in 2008. Instant replay was used
on home run calls six times in just the
first month and a half under the rule.
Yet instant replay in baseball still
doesn't extend far enough. While
the difference between a home run
and a double (in the case of fan in

terference) is significant, the differ
ence between scoring and being
thrown out at the plate is just as im
portant.
Opponents of instant replay in
baseball fear that it will make games
longer and more drawn out than
they already are. If we've learned
anything from home run reviews,
however, it's this: the painless, five
minute sacrifices for these relatively
rare occurrences are well worth it.
Although close plays in the in
field are much more common than
controversial home runs, they
shouldn't take much time to review,
either. These plays will be even
quicker to verify with instant replay,
as camera angles near the outfield
fences are much poorer than those
in the infield.
In the end, instant replay could
even save time in many cases, as it
would prevent managers from
throwing a 10-minute tirade every
time a crucial call went the other
way. (With Lou Piniella retiring after
this season, though, the time im
provement might not be noticeable.)
Despite the ease of a single infield
review, the time that multiple stop
pages take could add up in a game.
This means that the best way to con
duct reviews in baseball would be a
challenge system similar to that used
for football. In the NFL, each team is
given two challenges, and a some
times a conditional third one if both
of the other challenges are won,
while any controversial calls in the
final two minutes of a half are auto
matically reviewed by the officials.
In baseball, this system would set
a reasonable limit on managers, pre
venting games from going long while
ensuring justice in the all-important
ninth inning. Some adjustments
would have to be made a manag
er with an extra review could use it
to delay while a new pitcher warms
up but a feasible framework for
instant replay is already in the hands
of MLB Commissioner Bud Selig.
Whatever impact instant replay
may have on the length of games, at
its core the issue is one of fairness.
And if the MLB doesn't want to
make baseball fair, there's only one
other way the sport can be.
Foul.
