## Grad student rockets to victory at the San Francisco Marathon 
### 
Stanford astrophysics student Keith Bechtol won this
year's San Francisco Marathon on Sunday with a time of
2:23:28.
Bechtol has been running for 11 years, and after taking
a three-year break from the sport's competitive side as an
undergraduate student at William and Mary, he hoped to
use the marathon to see where he stood.
Bechtol would eventually stand at the finish line almost
two minutes before the arrival of the next competitor,
Michael Wardian from Arlington, Virg., even though the
25-year-old had to balance his training with a NASA satel
lite project.
After preparing for only six weeks, Bechtol knew he
could run at a six-minute mile pace, enough to give him a
shot at doing well.
"I knew that 5:30 pace per mile would have been com
petitive in previous years of the San Francisco Marathon,"
he wrote in an e-mail to the Daily, "So I wasn't afraid to go
out with the leaders and use their experience to my advan
tage."
"I went into the day without any particular goal time in
mind, but instead with a sense for how my body should feel
at different stages in the race," he added.
