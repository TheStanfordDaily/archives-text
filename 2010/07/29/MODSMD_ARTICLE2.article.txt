## UNIVERSITY Redwood City campus still undeveloped Park currently houses medical outpatient center, tech firms 
### JOSHUA FALK STAFF WRITER 
In September 2005, Stanford purchased a
35-acre portion of land at MidPoint Technolo
gy Park in Redwood City, intending to use the
MidPoint facilities for administrative offices
that did not need to be housed on the Palo Alto
campus.
But five years later, the Redwood City cam
pus remains undeveloped.
Since the Stanford University General Use
Permit limits building and development on the
main University campus, the Redwood City
campus was intended to provide the Universi
ty with additional space, "thus reserving core
campus space for Stanford's highest academic
priorities and objectives," read the Stanford
University 2007-08 budget.
Phase 1 of the proposed development was
also included in the 2008-09 Capital Plan, with
a projected cost of $379 million, according to
Randy Livingston, vice president for business
affairs and CFO.
"However, as the financial crisis unfolded
during that year, this was one of the projects
that was suspended," wrote Livingston in an e
mail to The Daily. "This project remains on the
suspended list today."
No groundbreaking date is set, but the Uni
versity has submitted an application to the city
of Redwood City requesting approval to rede
velop the property, said Lucy Wicks, assistant
director of community relations.
"We're in the process now of putting to
gether a proposal into the city," Wicks said.
"We're looking to draft environmental impact
reports that will come out later this fall."
However, the economic crisis has left the
University with decreased demand for admin
istrative office space, according to Livingston.
"While we hope to build out the campus at
some point after the entitlements are complet
ed, the University faces less pressure to do so
than was the case a few years ago," Livingston
said. "In the aftermath of the financial down
turn, many administrative positions were elim
inated, and future staff growth is anticipated to
be slower than in the years leading to the
downturn."
The 48-acre MidPoint park, formerly an
Ampex research and manufacturing site, also
houses the eight-acre Stanford Medicine Out
patient Center, part of Stanford Hospital &
Clinics.
The Outpatient Center hosts all outpatient
services for orthopaedic surgery and sports
medicine, dermatology, sleep medicine and
pain management.
Currently, 65 percent of the property pur
chased by the University in September 2005 is
being leased. Tenants include the social net-
work services company Rock You,
energy efficiency firm Silverspring
Networks, Big Band Networks, a
multinational digital video and data
processing platforms and services
provider, and MokaFive, a software
firm founded by Stanford computer
science Professor Monica Lam and
several of her Ph.D. students.
Some buildings are vacant, while
others are being used by the Uni
versity for storage, according to
Wicks and Steven Elliott, managing
director of real estate development.
Stanford's cash flow from the
properties is positive and operation
costs are paid by the tenants, they
added.
The University purchased its 35-
acre portion of MidPoint Technolo
gy Park for $78.5 million in Septem
ber 2005.
