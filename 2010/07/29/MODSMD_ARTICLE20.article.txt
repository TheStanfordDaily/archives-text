The national champion Cardinal men's volleyball team
has added another accolade to its historic season.
After winning the school's second national title on May
6, Stanford made history again as the 13th team in the his
tory of the AVCA Team Academic Award to win both a
national championship and the academic award. The team
had a GPA of 3.54 and is one of two NCAA Division I
teams (along with Harvard) to win the award, which is
given to volleyball teams that maintain at least a 3.30 cu
mulative team grade-point average.
In addition to this team honor, individual Cardinal ath
letes were also recognized. A total of nine players from the
championship squad were named to the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation (MPSF) All-Academic team. The nine
included all four Cardinal Ail-Americans: Brad Lawson,
Evan Romero, Erik Shoji and national player of the year
Kawika Shoji.
Moreover, starting middle block Garrett Werner
earned the Elite 88 Award, which is for the player with the
highest GPA in the NCAA Tournament.
