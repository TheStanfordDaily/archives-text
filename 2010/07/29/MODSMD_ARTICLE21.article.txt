## OH! SWEET NUTHIN' Cory Doctorow 
### Roseann Cima 
Anew website has gone viral. It's called
"I write like," and you can find it at
http://iwl.me. Enter any text and it tells
you which, of the works of 50 famous authors,
the writing is most similar to. The software was
developed by a Russian computer program
mer, living in Montenegro, who claims it uses
a simple Bayesian algorithm (like a spam fil
ter!) to determine likeness. Among the fea
tures considered are: vocabulary, sentence
length and the frequency of commas or peri
ods. It is an excellent toy.
I discovered I write my column like
Margaret Atwood and was flattered. "Good
job!" the HTML badge said. I thought so too.
Then, I read that someone found that Mel
Gibson drunkenly rants like Margaret
Atwood. Who, in turn, is supposed to write
like Stephen King (she tweeted this result her
self). I discovered that Madonna's preteen
daughter has been proven to blog like
Vonnegut, which made me choke a little, and
finally, I discovered I write my emails like
David Foster Wallace and was flattered. Good
job, Rosie. Good job.
With the exception of the "Dan Brown"
result, which has inspired the indignation of
many a netizen, the website is vacuously vali
dating. The creator said he wanted to encour
age people to write more, and he's probably

succeeded in this. But he also seems to want
people to write better: your result comes with
a link to "On Writing," by Stephen King. I'm
sure many find this confusing. I've just been
patted on the back for writing like James
Joyce, why would I bother with pointers from
a pop novelist?
First I thought that the application could be
made much more valuable very easily, without
altering the algorithm. Similarity is subjective,
and the software is certainly picking out some
thing. If we extended the database to include a
few classes of writing other than The Best, the
majority of text might gravitate to the more
ordinary genres. If we included Lourdes' fash
ion blog, for example, my best friends' 9th
grade Xanga entries would likely be much
more "like" it than the writing of J. D.
Salinger. There could even be an option to add
your writing to the database whenever you
analyze it, filling out a short survey on the
work when was it written, is it published,
the age of the author, that kind of thing. Sure
it'd probably be less popular, but under these
conditions, if your writing turned up as "David
Foster Wallace" and not "67 percent of emails
between friends aged 18-30," that might mean
something. And many people who considered
themselves excellent writers, but were ana
lyzed to be ordinary, would rise to the chal-

lenge and work to "beat" the program.
I thought for a while about how satisfying it
would be to have that badge, which you could
tack onto your C.V. along with your SAT and
IQ scores. Take that. New Yorker, I'd say.
Reject the fiction I submitted in high school
will you? Well, I wrote that story like Proust,
and some statistics, somewhere, say so! It has

similar words, punctuation and sentence
length. So ...
So style just isn't an indicator of real quali
ty. The best writers are also great thinkers.
And style is only valuable so far as it serves the
author's message. "I write like" has no way of
knowing whether my subplots, metaphors or
motifs constructively interact with my overall
concept. I'm not saying it's impossible, but this
definitely looks like the wrong tree to me. If
Holden Caulfield was real, if he had written
"Catcher in the Rye" as an account of his
experience, it wouldn't be a great work of lit
erature. It would be the journal of a relatively
ordinary, troubled youth. A different message,
but, to "I write like," an identical style. As it is,
"Catcher" is a forceful exploration of authen
ticity and identity. The first-person voice con
fronts the issue of perspective. It adopts a con
versational, introspective tone, because that
feels authentic while consciously being an arti
fice. And the narrator is the way he is because
the people most actively reflective about these
issues are self-obsessed, obnoxious teenagers.
If I, instead of Lourdes, had written, "so
I'm gonna bring my camera to East London
and take pictures of cool looking people and
come off as weird cuz I'm gonna ask people to
like stand still so I can take pics of them ..."
in an epistolary novel, it might come close to
qualifying as a work truly in the style of
Salinger. But "I write like" wouldn't know it.

Write like Rosie? Let her know at rcima@
stanford.edu.

"I write like" has no way of
knowing whether my
subplots, metaphors or
motifs constructively
interact with my overall
concept.
