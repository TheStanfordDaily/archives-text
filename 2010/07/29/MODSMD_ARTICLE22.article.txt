# THIS COLUMN SENT FROM MY IPHONE
## For A New Generation, Life Begins with "Inception" 
### Peter McDonald 
Of all the complaints old people level at
newfangled technology and its impend
ing destruction of society, one that
seems actually based in reality is the complaint
that the Internet, DVDs and iPods have
ruined the communal aspect of entertainment,
of the entire country sharing a cultural experi
ence. Precious then, is the movie that truly suc
ceeds at captivating the public's attention, like
"Inception" has done in the past two weeks.
Just search "Inception" in the "Posts By
Friends" tab on Facebook and you'll see what
I mean. And though I'm quite sure that
"Inception 2: The Undreaming" is only a few
years away, for now we can actually sit back
and appreciate a movie-going experience that
doesn't involve titles with colons nor the name
Spielberg or Cameron. Debates about the
meaning of "Inception" have sprung up all
over the Interwebs, even though most critics
seem dedicated to keeping it in summer block
buster territory. Flowever, considering how lit
tle that we actually know about each other,
endless analysis of summer Hollywood block
busters is a necessary intellectual exercise
because at least we can all agree on having
seen the same movie. Warning: intertextuality
approaching.
Released right at the crystallization of the
Digital Revolution, and also right at the
moment to be a lot our generation's first R
rated movie, "The Matrix" was the first film
my friends and I would talk about for hours
just for the sake of understanding. Ten years

later, it has come to define how my generation
views technology and its relation to reality.
The popularity of a movie dedicated to the
danger of machines knowing too much about
our personal lives undoubtedly feeds into our
current paranoia about social media. Also, for
a generation raised on D.A.R.E. and
metaphorical frying eggs, the framing of true
discovery through the taking of a pill provided
a strong counterpoint to all those gratuitously
fear-inducing anti-drug PSAs. The interpola
tion of existential questions between kick-ass
CGI action (or the other way around) has let
these ideas marinate into the chicken breast
that is our cultural subconscious to the point
that if you ask anyone our age to peel off the
skin of our superficial understandings of the
world and take a bite, the subtle tang of the
Wachowski brothers is unmistakable.

Chris Nolan stands on the verge of accom
plishing the same feat with "Inception," leav
ing a whole bevy of nuggets for this cultural
prognosticator to explore. I guess what follows
next is the obligatory spoiler alert, though
since I'm not a film critic I won't be devoting
three paragraphs solely to plot summary. Even
so, be forewarned. "Inception" stands to do to
neuroscience just what "The Matrix" did to
electronic connectivity. Dreams are perhaps
the last part of the human experience out of
the reach of technology, but with biochemistry
researchers exploring the rabbit hole that is
the "cognitive neuroscience of dreams"
(thanks Wikipedia) with increasing fervor, it's

only a matter of time until the development
potential of dreams manifests itself in the pri
vate sector or the Department of Defense. In
fact, Leo's character learned all he knew "bout
dreams from Professor Michael Caine. The
Army probably already has a Delta Force:
Somno Division, and you can bet Mark
Zuckerberg is already looking into how we can
upload our dreams to Facebook. Dreams
stand to get so much coverage in the next
decade that Neil Gaiman may end up on the
editorial board of the New York Times.
And with this all in mind, Chris Nolan actu
ally finds a narrative function for the line
"What if your world isn't real?" as well as the
legitimate use of action movie slow-mo and
Siberian fortress set pieces. It speaks to his
craftsmanship that most of the debate about
this movie is happening only on the ideological
level, and this debate will continue in some
form or another for the rest of the decade.
That's because everyone likes having reali
ty questioned, trumped only by having reality
questioned and then answered as plot device
in an action movie. Movies like "The Matrix"
and "Inception" provide fun little diversions
into the world of uncertain perceptions but
still leave you with a happy ending (that top
was about to fall, dammit). They won't really
alter your thinking for life, or make you recon
sider the world in any meaningful way. Most of
the dialogue, if someone were to actually say it
to you, sounds like a person tripping on mush
rooms, which, by the way, made people ques-

tion reality in much more profound ways thou
sands of years before "The Matrix" came out.
Even so, in the right context, "Inception"
could leave a huge mark on the psyche of our
nation's adolescents. After all, it would be way
weird if we were dreaming this whole time,
wouldn't it?

Is "Inception" really worth this much talk?
