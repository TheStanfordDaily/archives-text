## TELEVISION REVIEW It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World 
### â€” liz STARK contact liz: estark12@stanford. edu 
If there had been VHS in 1964, I
can say with confidence that Peggy
Olson from "Mad Men" would have
owned a copy of the 1963 film the title
alludes to. Alas, the Video Home
System didn't rock the worlds of secret
ly promiscuous homebodies until 1976,
so the season premiere of the fourth
season of "Mad Men" presents us with a
1964 Thanksgiving, sans VHS.
Somehow it managed just fine.
I spent the week leading up to
"Public Relations" poring over thinly
veiled promotional journalism about
Matt Weiner's universe of 1960s adver
tising titans in Manhattan. Even though
that research led me to descriptions of
the first words of the new season, "Who
is Don Draper?", those five syllables still
sent chills up and down my spine.
AMC's greatest triumph (who needs
American movies anyway?) began with
surprisingly dramatic and farcical tones
this past Sunday. Nearly a year has
passed in the world of the Draper
divorce and the new Sterling-Cooper-
Draper-Pryce. As a result, we the loyal
viewers of the show find ourselves ask
ing the same question as the reporter at

the outset of the episode, "Who is Don
Draper," simply because the premiere
unveiled many new aspects to the char
acter, navigated artfully by Jon Hamm.
For Don, his home and work lives
have been reversed: the loner of Sterling
Cooper has become the Alex Rodriguez
of SCDP; the Draper patriarch has
become Don the bachelor. These rever
sals are clearly wearing on Don, who in
the course of the episode commits
uncharacteristic missteps of failing to
bed a Mount Holyoke graduate and
bombing a magazine interview. Just as
Don never fits comfortably into his new
roles, the audience is never fully com
fortable with Don's lack of control. When
we see Don waiting late at night on the
couch of his former family home for
Betty to return, the magnitude of the
upheaval is glaringly apparent. Don
returns to form, by which I mean he art
fully assumes a form, by the end of the
episode, when he gives a second inter
view to a Wall Street Journal writer with
all the bravado of a man who could have
been Paris Hilton's great-godparent
(refer to season three for said reference).
To be honest, this episode put me on
edge even more than the caper-style sea
son three finale, simply because the sta
tus quo had changed so much. Matt
Weiner is not afraid to drop us in medias
res with not only plot but even character
development. The Peggy Olson of sea
son four has a new haircut and new
power at the firm: the command she
exerts over both the new art director

Matt Weiner is
not afraid to drop
us in medias res
with not only plot
but even character
development.

At the start of the fourth season of "Mad Men," the AMC series about an advertising agency in the middle of the 20th century, Don Draper (Jon
Hamm) experiences a number of challenges. How he rises to meet them relates the core themes of the show to this season's very altered status quo.
(yes, Sal is gone for good) and
Pete creates an illusion of control,
until their promotional hunt for
hams requires Don to bail her
out. Even when Don familiarly
calls her into the office, Peggy is
not afraid to say what the others
are thinking, namely that Don is
the king and the others merely
jesters. I'll be interested to see
where Peggy goes this season
not only the beds she sleeps in
but the corporate ladders she is
brave enough to climb.
And then there's Betty
Draper, more repugnant than
ever as January Jones presents
an uncanny portrait of bad par
enting in the role. Betty was
afforded some of the best
moments of the episode in action
and symbol: her force-feeding

Sally Draper on Thanksgiving,
the mother and daughter match
ing pink pajamas, and the moth
er and stepdaughter matching
red outfits at Thanksgiving din
ner. Betty, now married to
Henry Francis, wants to have
her cake and eat it too, or, more
appropriately, have her divorce
and milk it too. I can't wait to see
further interactions between an
even more entitled Betty and an
even less tolerant Don.
Weiner withholds informa
tion about Joan, underlining the
fact that the show's creator
knows what the audience wants
better than the audience does.
In true "Mad Men" fashion,
"Public Relations" raised more
questions than it answered, and
I'll be here to bemoan my igno
rance along the way.
