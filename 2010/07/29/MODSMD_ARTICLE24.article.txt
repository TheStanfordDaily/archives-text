# THEATER REVIEW
## The 						hero with five feces Odyssey adapted at Stanford Summer Theater 
### — sam JULIAN contact sam: ssjulian@stanford. edu 
The sheer scope of the
"Odyssey" would seem to
preclude theatrical adapta
tion. The story leaps from island
to island with a multitude of char
acters. Its narrative tropes, too, are
anything but performance-friend
ly. Third-person narration is ellip
tical and verbose, frequently
employing paragraph-long "epic
similes" that are pretty much
exactly what they sound like.
To perform this tale in away
that is not only comprehensible
but also entertaining seems next to
impossible, but Rush Rehm and
Stanford Summer Theater have
managed to do both.
The production follows the first
12 books of Homer's "The
Odyssey," abridged and adapted
for the stage. It begins, as the
books do, with Odysseus trapped
on an island, the consort of a god
dess but pining for home. He is set
free by the Olympians and washes
ashore at the court of the seafaring
Phaeacians, where he recounts the
many adventures that led to his
arrival.
The performance is intimate,
featuring a cast of only 10, each
sharing portions of the narration
and assuming roles as needed.
This technique is used to great
advantage. Each actor's perfor
mances emphasize particular
moods and draw parallels between
characters. For example,
Courtney Walsh plays both the
goddess Calypso and the fearful
Cyclops. Though physically and
emotionally opposite, they both
demonstrate misapplications of
hospitality when they prevent

Odysseus from leaving their
islands.
Odysseus himself is played by
five different cast members
throughout, changing actors in a
way that highlights the talents of
each. When Odysseus is adventur
ing on the high seas, Alex
Übokudom takes the reins with a
wry wink. Paul Baird demon
strates the hero's skill with diplo
macy. And when the epic power of
a storyteller must be invoked, the
booming presence of L. Peter
Callendar steps into the charac
ter's shoes. While at times the
transitions from actor to actor can
be jarring, the switches are justi
fied and well chosen. Odysseus
himself is slippery and clever, a
trickster hero in the vein of Anansi
or Brer Rabbit, and the technique
effectively emulates that.
Whoever isn't playing a char
acter serves as a dynamic Greek
chorus, adding commentary and
color as the plot moves forward.
The choreography is deftly exe
cuted, and movement is lively
and varied. The actors climb
through rafters and swing on
ropes, inventing and creating a
new space on the stage. The min
imalist approach to props is par
ticularly innovative. Cloth, wood
and rope are used in so many dif
ferent manners you wonder why
one would bother with anything
more elaborate. The show asks
audience members to use their
imaginations. Ordinary objects,
such as a blue scarf, are imbued
with complex symbolism through
repeated use.
The intimacy and sparseness of

the production give the show a
sense of interconnectedness and
naturalism. We are presented with
a story told more than 2,700 years
ago, and it remains resonant
today. "The Wanderings of
Odysseus" is alternately exciting,
funny, moving and majestic, whol
ly unique in a time when story
telling is dominated by exploita
tion and spectacle.
"The Wanderings of Odysseus"
plays through Aug. 15. Tickets are
$2O, $lO for students. More infor
mation and show times are at sum
