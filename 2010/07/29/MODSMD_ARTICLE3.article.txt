## City Council concludes expansion discussions 
### BUYAN PAN DAILY INTERN 
Lengthy discussions of a key component of
the Stanford hospital expansion have conclud
ed, marking a crucial milestone for the project.
The Palo Alto City Council held a meeting
on Monday, July 26 for final discussion of the
Draft Environmental Impact Report (DEIR)
concerning the University's Medical Center Fa
cilities Renewal and Replacement Project. The
City Council's Planning and Transportation
Commission has been holding meetings to dis
cuss different chapters of the report over the
past two months, and Monday's meeting was the
last in the series, focused on a review of the re
port's Alternative Chapter and Mitigation Mea
sures.
The DEIR is a report written by PBSJ, an en
vironmental, architecture and program man

agement company that Palo Alto had selected
to be its consultant for the University's Medical
Center project. PBSJ had been producing the
report since August 2007.
California requires submission of these re
ports in order to oversee how major construc
tion projects would affect their environment.
The Medical Center's construction project
involves a $3.5-billion plan to be implemented
over the next 20 years. It would expand the Lu
cile Packard Children's Hospital and recon
struct the main Stanford Hospital at 300 Pasteur
Drive, the School of Medicine, as well as two
buildings of office space for community practi
tioners. Along with the buildings, the facilities
will be renovated to meet seismic safety stan
dards.
Overall, 1.3 million square feet will be added

to the Medical Center, which is sur
rounded by Sand Hill Road, Vineyard
Lane, Quarry Road and Pasteur
Drive, and which includes Welch
Road and Blake Wilbur Drive.
The chapters of the DEIR dis
cussed in the City Council's meeting
identified the impacts of the project
and proposed mitigation measures
through seven alternative plans.
Among the issues addressed were

traffic, air quality, preservation of his
toric buildings and meeting the crite
ria of the California Environmental
Quality Act (CEQA) in renewing the
Medical Center.
With regards to traffic, the DEIR as
serted that expanding the Medical Cen
ter would have more employees and
clients as daily commuters, leading to an
increase in traffic in the area. After
studying various routes, street segments
and intersections, PBSJ foresaw that
congestions could also affect neighbor
ing cities such as Menlo Park. Emissions
would also increase, damaging the air
quality, and noise levels would affect
surrounding neighborhoods.

In response, PBSJ proposed in the
DEIR a "Village Concept Alterna
tive," suggesting that housing be pro
vided in the vicinity for new employees
to reduce traffic.
Another possible alternative to the
original project was the preservation
of a historic building, the Stone Build
ing Complex. The complex, construct
ed in 1959, was where Norman
Shumway performed the first heart
transplant in the United States. In the
University's plan, the complex would
be taken down for the expansion of
the Medical Center. The alternative
plan in the DEIR, termed the "His
toric Preservation Alternative,"

hoped to keep the Stone Building
Complex intact.
The main concern of the DEIR re
garding the environment was the
preservation of the "aesthetically and
biologically significant protected trees
at Kaplan Lawn, the FIMI Grove and
along Welch Road." The University
was in favor of the alternative that
aimed to preserve the trees, as the
plans were very similar to the original
ones. This "Tree Preservation Alter
native" proposed relocating some
trees and avoiding the construction of
hospital module on Kaplan Lawn.
In addition to discussing the Alter
natives Chapter and Mitigation Mea

sure of the DEIR, the council meeting
disclosed public comments on the ex
pansion project and its alternatives,
with arguments typically centering on
the relative importance of specific cri
teria, such as traffic or historical
preservation.
The period for the City Council to
accept public comments on the project
ended on Tuesday, July 27. After dis
cussing the DEIR, Palo Alto will now
put together a final Environmental Im
pact Report that will be brought back
to the Council in late fall.
