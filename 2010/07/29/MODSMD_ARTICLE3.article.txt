## City Council concludes expansion discussions 
### BUYAN PAN DAILY INTERN 
Lengthy discussions of a key component of
the Stanford hospital expansion have conclud
ed, marking a crucial milestone for the project.
The Palo Alto City Council held a meeting
on Monday, July 26 for final discussion of the
Draft Environmental Impact Report (DEIR)
concerning the University's Medical Center Fa
cilities Renewal and Replacement Project. The
City Council's Planning and Transportation
Commission has been holding meetings to dis
cuss different chapters of the report over the
past two months, and Monday's meeting was the
last in the series, focused on a review of the re
port's Alternative Chapter and Mitigation Mea
sures.
The DEIR is a report written by PBSJ, an en
vironmental, architecture and program man

agement company that Palo Alto had selected
to be its consultant for the University's Medical
Center project. PBSJ had been producing the
report since August 2007.
California requires submission of these re
ports in order to oversee how major construc
tion projects would affect their environment.
The Medical Center's construction project
involves a $3.5-billion plan to be implemented
over the next 20 years. It would expand the Lu
cile Packard Children's Hospital and recon
struct the main Stanford Hospital at 300 Pasteur
Drive, the School of Medicine, as well as two
buildings of office space for community practi
tioners. Along with the buildings, the facilities
will be renovated to meet seismic safety stan
dards.
Overall, 1.3 million square feet will be added
