## Financial aid undergoes shifts 
### KABIR SAWHNEY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
With concerns abounding about the fiscal viabil
ity of the University's significant financial aid com
mitments, Stanford announced new changes in its
2010-11 budget designed to ensure that the pro
gram can continue to meet the "demonstrated fi
nancial needs" of all admitted undergraduates.
Projections for next year forecast a drop in the
overall amount spent on undergraduate financial
aid to $124.3 million, the first decrease in well over
a decade.
According to Karen Cooper, the director of fi

nancial aid, the Office of Financial Aid is "essential
ly using the same formula" to calculate a family's
expected contribution to the cost of a student's ed
ucation. However, the budget did outline several
changes to the financial aid strategy. These include
increases in expected student contributions and in
the contributions from families with annual in
comes above $200,000. According to the budget,
these changes will save $2.5 million in scholarship
funds next year.
As of next year, the expected contribution for
both new and returning students is set to rise by
$250 per year, to a total of $4,750, that
must be contributed before students
can be considered for scholarship eli
gibility. Students meet this require
ment through summer and academic
year earnings.
In addition. Cooper said that the
Office of Financial Aid has increased
the campus minimum wage by two
percent, to about $l2 per hour.
"We think students will be able to
handle that $250 increase without any
major impact," she added.
Families making above $200,000
can also expect to see a bigger bill
from the University in the fall.
"In some situations, at those upper
income levels, our formulas were per
haps more generous than would be
equitable for families," Cooper said.
"There are some cases at the highest
income levels of eligibility, where
there is more than one family mem
ber in college, a new applicant might
see a higher expectation."
While Cooper said that the formu
las were not changing, financial aid
officers, who have been generous in
the past when making allowances for
family assets and obligations, would
be stricter in awarding aid to families
at higher income levels.
Adjustments are not being made
to the financial aid program for inter
national students, which is distinct
from the program for U.S. citizens
and residents. While domestic admis
sions are need-blind, admission deci
sions for international students do
factor in financial needs, and the Uni
versity only admits a "limited num
ber" of international students who
qualify for financial aid.
These changes are certainly signif
icant to students currently receiving
financial aid; however, the projected
savings are not enough to cover the
budgetary shortfall from reduced en
dowment payouts. At its peak in the
2008-09 academic year, as the global
recession was beginning to take its
toll, the endowment contributed
$80.4 million to financial aid, repre
senting 69 percent of the total aid
budget. Projections for the upcoming
year put the endowment's contribu
tion at $66.3 million, making up 53

percent of the overall budget.
To overcome this shortfall, the Uni
versity is dipping into the General
Fund, with $lO million pledged to fi
nancial aid next year. It will mark the
first time these funds are being used
for aid since the 2006-07 year. Stanford
is also making use of money from the
Stanford Fund and the Tier II Buffer,
collectively known as President's
funds, to contribute $32.7 million, well
above pre-recessionary levels.
"We're hoping to be able to [use
these funds] until the endowment re
bounds," Cooper said.

Stanford's Capital Campaign has
also increased its expected contribu
tion to financial aid.
Lastly, the budget predicts a three
percent drop in the number of stu
dents requiring need-based financial
aid, from 3,350 students to 3,250 in the
upcoming academic year. The Uni
versity is therefore expecting that, as
the economy recovers, family fi
nances will rebound and students will
need less support in paying the full
cost of tuition, room and board.
The recession hit financial aid hard
in two ways last year just as the
value of the endowment plummeted,
the number of students requiring fi
nancial aid increased as their families
also lost income due to the crisis.
However, Cooper said the Office
of Financial Aid is prepared in case
the planned decrease fails to material
ize.
"The University will give the fi
nancial aid office more money,"
Cooper said. "We monitor how much
we need for the financial aid program,
and if we need more, they find more."
