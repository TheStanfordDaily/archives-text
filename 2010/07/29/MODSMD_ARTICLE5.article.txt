## DSA awaits new labor contract, DPS runs "lean operation" 
### AN LE NGUYEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford University and the
Deputy Sheriffs' Association (DSA)
are putting the finishing touches on a
new labor agreement that will be re
vealed and put to vote the first week
of August.
The DSA represents 26 of the 65
employees working at the Depart
ment of Public Safety (DPS). The ex
isting Stanford-DSA contract
which governs work conditions,
wages and labor stipulations is
valid through July 31,2010.
In an e-mail to The Daily, Chief of
Police Laura Wilson said that the
University and DSA "recently
reached a tentative agreement on a
contract."
"Given the reductions, layoffs and
furlough days that many government
agencies are experiencing, I am
pleased that the University was able
to reach an agreement with the DSA
that includes reasonable salary in
creases for DSA members without
asking them for reductions," Wilson
said.
Still, the DSA membership must
ratify the contract before it becomes
official. At present, members have
only seen the agreement's highlights,
presented in a joint memorandum by
Stanford University and the DSA.
"We're going to expose it to our
membership on [the] first week of
August," DSA vice president Ken
Bates said of the full agreement. "I
think we should have a vote to ratifi
cation soon after."
Bates, however, declined to com
ment on the intricacies of the new
contract. He noted that the DSA is
"not really in a position to talk about
the differences between this tenta
tive agreement" and the preceding
one until its membership has "full
awareness of what's going on" and
places a vote.
"It's still a work in progress," he
said.
Bates also did not say whether last
year's budget cuts influenced the
drafting process.
But these cuts clearly played a
role elsewhere, as DPS took a sizable
reduction to its budget last year. DPS

eliminated unfilled, non-sworn posi
tions, and reduced equipment and
maintenance expenditures to absorb
the effects of the budget cuts.
Wilson noted that her department
was able to meet this cutback "with
out reducing the number of sworn
personnel who patrol the campus."
"We run a lean operation, which
means employees have their sched
ules adjusted on a regular basis in
order to meet the demands placed
upon the department," Wilson said.
"This includes schedule adjustments
to work events, participate in train
ing and simply cover patrol."
DPS officers are also often asked

to change their schedules to deal with
football games, weekends and digni
tary visits.
"Stanford can be a demanding
community to serve from the stand
point that people expect exceptional
service and are not hesitant to let it
be known when they are displeased,"
Wilson said. "Some might consider
this to be a negative aspect of work
ing here, but I think the high expecta
tions force us to be the best we can
possibly be and not to become com
placent."
