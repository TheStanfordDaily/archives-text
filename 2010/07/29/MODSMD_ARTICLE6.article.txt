has existed since 1995 and has qualified for nationals al

most every year since, according to player Alex Lovejoy, a
graduate student in biochemistry. It won the national
championship in 1995,2003 and 2009.
This year, four members represented the team at the
championship: Lovejoy, C.J. Jameson 'lO, Zizhuo Wang, a
graduate student in materials science and engineering, and
Miu Wong, who just graduated with a master's degree in
materials science and engineering.
