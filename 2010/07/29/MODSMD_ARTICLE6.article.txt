## Stanford bridge team earns fourth place at collegiate championships 
### AARON BRODER DAILY INTERN 
A Stanford bridge team advanced to the semifinals in
last weekend's North American Collegiate Bridge Cham
pionship in New Orleans, beating out four other teams and
finishing the tournament in fourth place.
The team is an informal group of people who play every
Tuesday during the school year at Old Union. The team
has existed since 1995 and has qualified for nationals al

most every year since, according to player Alex Lovejoy, a
graduate student in biochemistry. It won the national
championship in 1995,2003 and 2009.
This year, four members represented the team at the
championship: Lovejoy, C.J. Jameson 'lO, Zizhuo Wang, a
graduate student in materials science and engineering, and
Miu Wong, who just graduated with a master's degree in
materials science and engineering.
The group qualified for the colle
giate national championship through
an online tournament in February
against 27 other teams, including one
other from Stanford. Once it had
qualified, the team spent the next five
months practicing and working out
the partnerships, both of which were
new.
"We knew we weren't as good as
last year's team," Lovejoy said, "but
we still expected to make it through
qualifying. I certainly wanted to make
at least the semifinals, and we did
that."

Bridge is a partnership game, sim
ilar to Spades, in which players work
with their partners to try to earn
"tricks," or sets of cards. During each
hand, one pair is on the "offense" and
tries to collect a number of tricks that
the team agreed to earlier, while the
other is on "defense" and attempts to
keep the opposing team from making
its goal. Each hand normally takes
less than 10 minutes to complete.
Tournament bridge has an extra
twist on the rules known as "duplicate
bridge," which is intended to level the
playing field and eliminate the luck
common in card games. Once a hand
is completed between two opposing
pairs, the cards are passed to the next
table, where two other pairs from
each team have to play with the cards
their opponents were dealt earlier.

On Saturday, the team made it
through round-robin eliminations in
third place, advancing to the semifi
nals. They were defeated on Sunday
afternoon by Yale, which had placed
first in the round robin. Stanford later
lost its third-place match to Flarvard.
"It's sort of a downer to lose twice
in one day," Jameson said. "But mak
ing it out of the round robin was pret
ty exciting. There was some pressure
to repeat [last year's victory], but the
teams change every year so you never
know who's favored."
"There were a few things we could
have done better in the Yale match,"
Lovejoy added, but "the whole expe
rience was fun, as it always is."
