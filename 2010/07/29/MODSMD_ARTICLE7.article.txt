# STUDENT LIFE
## Students anticipate fall midterm elections 
### ASHLEY MENZIES 
Nearly two years ago, an outbreak of
Obama-fever swept across Stanford's campus,
permeating lecture halls, dorm rooms, dining
halls and even bathrooms. Many students
found out about the latest Obama rally or
phone-banking event by reading the flyer on
the bathroom stall.
"Barack the Vote" T-shirts, blue signs
boasting the word "Change" and Obama-
Biden 'OB pins often attached to backpacks
flooded campus. Several rallies were held, with
students chanting campaign slogans such as
"O-bama, O-eight." Stanford Students for
Barack Obama and the Stanford Democrats
were the cool kids that ran the school. And al
most every weekend, students squeezed into
cramped vans and made the long trek to the
swing state of Nevada to canvas in either Reno
or Las Vegas.
Now that the 2010 midterm elections are
right around the corner and Obama-fever has
subsided, students are trying to maintain a high
level of political activity at Stanford this fall.
"I think Stanford student activists and polit
ical types are definitely still in action and will
make a strong effort in the fall," said Sarahi
Constantine 'll, a student leader in the Obama
campaign in 2008.
Constantine described herself as personally
invested in a number of electoral contests, in
cluding California's races for attorney general,
governor, and United States senator. She is
also, through her work with Stanford Democ
rats and other national projects, following
races in other states for congressional seats.
"There are definitely hardcore political ac
tivists on campus, myself included, who will be
working hard this fall," said Zev Karlin-Neu
mann 'll, another active Obama supporter, an
officer for the Stanford Democrats and mem
ber of Organizing for America.
"That said, in an off-year election, and with
out a candidate like President Obama on the
ticket, it does become harder to mobilize busy
Stanford students," he added.
Political science professor Gary Segura
does not find the challenge to mobilize voters
during a midterm election surprising.
"Without presidential candidates, the elec
tion lacks the focal points that people tend to
rally around," Segura said. "I don't think this
year is any different."
However, Greg Hirshman 'll, vice presi
dent of the new Stanford Tea Party, predicts
that this year will be different because of
strong activism among conservatives.
"Now the liberals are a lot more disillu
sioned with Obama, and conservatives are
ready to take back power," Hirshman said.
He believes that the Stanford Tea Party will
resonate with students because it focuses on
fiscally conservative principles. Although most
students hold liberal stances on social issues

such as gay marriage and abortion, Hirshman
believes many also hold fiscally conservative
views. He hopes this appeal sets them apart
from other conservative groups on campus,
and will help them mobilize students in the up
coming election.
Hirshman's focus on fiscal issues as op
posed to social issues could be a winning strat
egy for promoting action if he can attract stu
dents like Jimmy Threatt 'll.
Threatt, a registered Republican, said he is
not involved in any conservative student

groups on campus because although he largely
subscribes to a theory of small government,
which is strongly tied to the Republican Party,
Republicans do not adhere to a theory of small
government when it comes to social issues.
"The conservatives try to advocate small
government concerning fiscal issues and then
turn around and try to legislate morality,"
Threatt said. "I guess I'm libertarian more
than anything else."
Threatt predicts that conservatives will be
more active in 2010 than in 2008 because, sim

ilar to how the discontent with the Bush ad
ministration fueled enthusiasm for the Obama
campaign, Republicans are now dissatisfied
with Obama's first two years in office.
"It is a referendum on Obama," said Hirsh
man about the midterm elections.
Whether that is the case or not, energy lev
els could see a marked contrast in the fall. A
spring poll conducted by Harvard's Institute of
Politics, a nonpartisan group, one of the most

Democrats and more inclined to
vote in this fall's elections. Forty
one percent of young Republicans
said they plan to vote in November,
compared with 35 percent of De
mocrats and 13 percent of Indepen
dents.
Although conservatives are en
ergized and ready to vote their can
didates into office, most students
acknowledge that Stanford's politi
cal activity will simply not live up to
the excitement of the 2008 election
and its eventual victor.
"Fie was one of the youngest and
most vibrant candidates since JFK,"
said Hirshman about President
Obama.
"Many students were attracted
to the campaign because it was the
cool thing to do," said Karlin-Neu
mann and he's hoping students
still think it's "cool" to support
Obama's party in the fall.
