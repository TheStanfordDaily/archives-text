## OH! SWEET NUTHIN' Claustrophobia 
### Roseann Cima 
Three stories, intended to provoke awe:
The first is borrowed. One Lucas
Hoewner comes to Stanford from
Germany during winter quarter to visit
friends. He stays for more than a month, ends
up bonding fairly well with quite a few people
and has a small farewell party before going
home. Bill Rowan 'll, one of Hoewner's new
friends, leaves for Stanford in Berlin weeks
later, and reports back, via Skype, that he's
run into Hoewner there.
The second is mine. I spent a month in
Mexico the summer before my freshman year.
I stayed at a relatively remote bed and break
fast in a college town that I hadn't heard of
before planning the trip. There are about eight
boarders, and we and the family formed a kind
of clique for my brief stay in town. We friend
on Facebook, and I lose contact. Two years
later, I make a new Stanford friend. He plays
slide guitar, he took a gap year and kept bees in
Hawaii. Of the six Facebook friends we share,
one of them, one of his closest friends from
high school, lived with me in Guanajuato.
The third is the best and was downright
stolen. Sebastian Anctil 'lO (not his real name)
Eurotrips the summer before his senior year.
He starts in Barcelona and at some point in
time ends up couchsurfing in Germany. It is
there, in a co-op, that he first hears of the
Drunken American that has been taking
advantage of cooperative communities across
the German countryside. Eventually, Anctil

meets him. Or rather, he bursts into a co-op
that had thrown him out, picks Anctil out as an
American, and, in a dry, raspy voice, demands
to know where Anctil is from and what he
does. Anctil says he's a student. He is asked
where and forced to drop the Stanford bomb.
First the response sounds like unusual,
though not unheard-of posturing. "Stanford,
huh? I went to Stanford." Then the Drunken
American smirks and asks, "Do you know Chi
Theta Chi?"
I no longer walk away from this kind of
story thinking there must be kind of cosmic
plan to it all. But I do usually laugh, shout,
"What?! No!" and wonder at the odds. No
matter what, I'm impressed. What follows is
an explanation of why I shouldn't be. At least,
not as much as I am.
Starting with the easiest: the Stanford
friends Hoewner was visiting he had met, orig
inally, through the Sprach Partner program
when they were studying in Berlin. Stanford
students are paired with German undergradu
ates to practice oral conversation in German
and in English. Rowan encountered Hoewner
his first day of school, when they were both
milling about looking for their new Sprach
Partners. It would've been more remarkable if
they hadn't seen one another.
Mine can also be explained, though not
quite so easily. The housemate was from Ann
Arbor, the daughter of a professor, and it
made a lot of sense that she'd have at least one

close friend going to Stanford. That I'd even
tually meet him was also pretty predictable,
too. Guanajuato's a city where the cutest boys
have dreadlocks and the bar of choice is deco
rated with art made out of trash. Our bed and
breakfast was advertised as "vegetarian
friendly." Of course her Bay-Area-bound high
school friend was a co-op-er, just like me. And
when you think about it, the world of academ
ic world-traveling American West hippies is
relatively small.
Finally, I'll attempt Anctil's. There are only
so many ways to get through Germany on lit
tle to no money. But dropouts, particularly

former Theta Chis, are likely to want to travel.
They are also likely to have little to no money
to spend. Germany, known for beer and elec
tronica, is probably a pretty popular destina
tion. Anctil was interested in cooperative com
munities and had been staying in a lot of these
places. That he eventually came crashing into
one of the less-savory satellites somewhere in
Europe was almost inevitable. They probably
saw the same post on couchsurfing.org.
These are all cases of abroad being much
narrower than it seems and home being much
bigger. Your social network might feel like a
small village, in the scope of the world, but if
you've met about 700 people (my number of
Facebook friends), and on average each of
them has met 500 unique individuals, there
will, of course, be some overlap the number
of people who know people you know is about
350,000. That's no village. That's Anaheim,
Calif. If you extend this to include people who
know the institutions you consider yourself a
part of, the number grows even more. If
Stanford is a village, it's one that rotates in
thousands of new residents every year.
There are also only so many things these
people do. Only so many professions, so many
travel destinations. They watch the same
You Tube videos, read the same articles, visit
the same websites. We live in a world in which
connections are easier to establish and to
maintain at a distance, and for better or worse
it's becoming harder and harder to find what a
person from your "village" might consider vir
gin territory. The world really is getting small
er. At least, it is for us.

small village, in the scope of the world, but if
you've met about 700 people (my number of
Facebook friends), and on average each of
them has met 500 unique individuals, there
will, of course, be some overlap the number
of people who know people you know is about
350,000. That's no village. That's Anaheim,
Calif. If you extend this to include people who
know the institutions you consider yourself a
part of, the number grows even more. If
Stanford is a village, it's one that rotates in
thousands of new residents every year.
There are also only so many things these
people do. Only so many professions, so many
travel destinations. They watch the same
You Tube videos, read the same articles, visit
the same websites. We live in a world in which
connections are easier to establish and to
maintain at a distance, and for better or worse
it's becoming harder and harder to find what a
person from your "village" might consider vir
gin territory. The world really is getting small
er. At least, it is for us.

These are all cases of
abroad being much
narrower than
it seems and home
being much bigger.
