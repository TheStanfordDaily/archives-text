## The 						794 Words You Can Never Say In Real Life

It held on for me to finish last week's col
umn and three episodes of "The
Boondocks," but when summoned upon to
provide the soundtrack for two rounds of
shots (one guess as to what the song would
have been) my faithful Toshiba Satellite final
ly relented to my flagrant disregard for
McAfee Site Advisor and started booting up
for eternity on a fateful Tuesday night. Three
years under the benevolent overlords at
ResComp and surrounded by CS majors
means that I know how to defibrillate it with
relative ease, but a broken computer is such a
convenient excuse for so many things.
Nevertheless, having a childhood in the 90s
means that I still needed to fulfill my daily
quotient of staring at a screen, so Quick

Collection!
Occupying my fancy for the past week has
been "The Larry Sanders Show," and let me
just say I needed HBO in my life a lot sooner.
Considering that it aired in a decade when the
Farrelly Brothers and Carrot Top defined
comedy, this show truly had to be ground
breaking television.
One of the more annoying byproducts of
the current incarnation of hipsterism is the
need to classify every social interaction into
moments, especially epic ones. Evidence
Example A: Textsfromlastnight. Every con
versation is a scene in The Most Original
Television Show, a.k.a. their life. When the

dialogue is not up to snuff, in comes the awk
ward turtle. Admittedly, this tendency is less
pronounced among the demographics of peo
ple whose characters never have any interior
ity. Still, with its greater reliance on low-bud
get stories and its long-format episodic struc
ture, TV is perhaps the form of entertainment
closest to real life.
My favorite character on "The Larry
Sanders Show" is the producer Arty, expertly
played by Rip Torn. The oldest character in
the show, he gets to drop fatty loads of knowl
edge on everyone else, and since I had just
resolved within myself to no longer avoid con
flict like the songs on my iTunes I only down
loaded for show, I was taking notes.
Scene: outside, walking toward a group of
people engaged in a glorious bit of day drink
ing on a beautiful Sunday afternoon with the
intention of joining them. The character sees
the maddeningly popular girl that has been on
his mind far more than he is happy about.
They have not spoken in person for over a
month. The last time that happened, her first
line of dialogue in their next scene together
was "Can you get my friend some cocaine?" It
is a question that had absolutely no grounding
in the rest of the show. The character is not a
drug trafficker. He had been meaning to tell
her how hurt and offended he was that she
would greet someone she had gone on a date
with, such a rarity at Stanford, in such a cal
lous and presumptuous matter, but the char

acter previously was meek and non-con
frontational. Now, armed with a willingness to
move on with his life, Arty's war-worn wis
dom and society's greatest emotional crutch,
alcohol, he was going to have his catharsis.
She approaches him with a cordial greeting.
Cut to: An hour later. She does not appre
ciate the character's joke about her aging
grandmother.
Cut to: another hour later. The character is
walking quite steadily back from one of the
more unglamorous trips to the bathroom in
his life. She shoots him a look of mild disgust
and asks with beautiful condescension "Are
you alright?" He replies with as much con
tempt as he can find "Yeah, I'm fine." As she
exits she says "OK then, I'll see you next
week," a statement both characters know is
not true.
Oh goddamn it. Can we reshoot that one?
I guess it turns out people only want to model
their lives after trendy sitcoms and not awk
ward teen dramas, and that television as
escapist entertainment goes beyond the joy
we get from watching attractive people solve
all their problems in 45 minutes. The real
allure of television, of dialogue, of engaging
characters, is the ability to see people say the
things we always wish we had the smarts,
power, or courage to say. We want them to
deliver on the spot the beautiful one liner we
came up with 45 minutes too late, the line that
will save that friendship, get us that job or win

over our crush. No one told me that part of
growing up is learning that there will be some
words that you want to say, need to say, but
just can't. Shit. Do people always get this emo
without Gawker and Sporcle to distract them?
I really need to reformat my computer.
Freeze frame. Roll credits.

Unnamed girl, please send your justifiably angry
response to petermc@stanford.edu.

Having a childhood in
the 90s means that I still
needed to fulfill my
daily quotient of staring
at a screen.
