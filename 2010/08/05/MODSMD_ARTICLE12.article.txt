## The
						story behind the Hoover Institutions web and television series 'Uncommon Knowledge' 
### NICOLA PARK DAILY INTERN 
In recent years, the Hoover Institution has
been known for its policy research and the
fame of its fellows outside the Farm. But the
think tank has also tried its hand at entertain
ment: Hoover has been producing its own
show, entitled "Uncommon Knowledge," for over a
decade.
The series, hosted by Hoover research fellow
Peter Robinson M.B.A. '9O, is an outlet for political
leaders, scholars and journalists to share their views
with the world. While the show has been in the form
of webcasts since 2006, it ran as a television series
from 1997 to 2005.
Its guests have included a host of famous figures,
including Paul Krugman, Newt Gingrich,
Christopher Hitchens, Henry Kissinger, John
McCain and Rupert Murdoch, along with Hoover
fellows such as Condoleeza Rice and George Shultz.
According to executive producer William Free,
Stanford was an ideal place for the show to ground
itself.
"The Hoover Institution was looking for ways to
expand dialogue about important policy issues and
this was one way to do it," he said. "Stanford is a cen
ter for ideas and people coming together to discuss
those ideas."
'"Uncommon Knowledge' takes fascinating,
accomplished guests, then sits them down with me to
talk about the issues of the day," Robinson wrote in
an e-mail to The Daily. "Unhurried, civil, thoughtful
and informed conversation that's what we pro
duce. And there isn't ah that much of it around these
days."
Robinson himself has authored three books and
spent six years in the White House, from 1982 to
1983 as chief speechwriter to then Vice President
George H.W. Bush and from 1983 to 1988 as special
assistant and speechwriter to then President Ronald
Reagan. Robinson also spent a year with Fox
Television and another with the Securities and
Exchange Commission in Washington, D.C.
Aside from host Robinson, the show's staff con
sists of Free, assistant producer and research assis
tant Diane Ellis and Robinson's assistant Nicole
Reed. According to Robinson, the show shoots near
ly all of its episodes on campus in the studio across
from Escondido Village.
"We're constantly thinking about Hoover fellows
and Stanford faculty who would be able to comment
on public policy issues that are in the news,"
Robinson said. "We also pay a lot of attention to vis
iting authors, speakers and political figures. This uni
versity is a lot like Manhattan sooner or later
more or less every person of note in the country is
bound to turn up."
"Uncommon Knowledge" sprouted from the
minds of Hoover Institution Director John Raisian
and current series producer Free, and Robinson
became the face of the show. The producers made
the switch from TV to webcast in 2006 to take advan
tage of Internet media, according to Robinson.
"Viewers could watch it when and as they want
ed," Robinson said. "Different websites could link to
different shows all kinds of legal blogs linked to
my interview with Justice Scalia, for example, where
as cultural websites linked to the show with Tom
Wolfe."
