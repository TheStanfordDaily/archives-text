# technology + education
## 
### AARON BRODER DAILY INTERN 
A round 300 people crowded around
the display tables set up in
Wallenberg Hall last Friday, all of
them eager to try out the latest
gadgets from Stanford students in
the Learning, Design & Technology (LDT)
program. But although the image calls to mind
children in a toy store, most of the people at
LDT EXPO 2010 were in fact adults, looking
at what might be the future of education.
LDT, a master's program, is a graduate
program in the School of Education that
focuses on innovating education using state
of-the-art technology and entrepreneurship.
Students coming from all fields may enter the
program to take classes on business, technol
ogy and education, in order to combine the
different fields to create a new way to learn.
"Students design a technology-enhanced
learning experience, conceived and devel
oped on their own initiative," wrote LDT
Program Advisor Jesse Foster in e-mail to
The Daily. "They spend an average of 300

hours and complete projects with modest
assistance from faculty and others."
Nearly a year's worth of design, develop
ment and testing culminates in a product that
can embody education and technology in any
number of ways. This year at the EXPO there
was everything from a social networking
application to help connect city officials and
their voters, to a curriculum designed to help
educators teach their students about the
Internet, and, most popular of all, education
al video games for children.
One of these video games, Equatia, is a
math-based role-playing game, where players
have to solve addition and multiplication
problems in order to save the princess at the
end of a maze.
Kris Elattori, a student in the USC film
school who worked with LDT graduate stu
dent Brady Fukumoto on Equatia, believes
that technology not only makes the learning
process more fun for the student, it also
makes it easier on the teacher as well.
"The idea is, teachers are great for teach
ing," Hattori said. "But when it comes to the
practice, computers are really good at making
something mundane compelling. The comput

er can tell you what kids get right and what
kids get wrong. You can learn their weakness
es and help them overcome them."
When Gabriel Adauto, another LDT stu
dent, tested his fraction-teaching iPhone
game called Motion Math with third graders,
he learned the same thing.
"Playing the game," Adauto said, "[stu
dents] gain a much more intuitive under
standing of fractions than when they're just
being taught."
While technology has been proven to be
effective in the classroom, some educators
still aren't ready to welcome it with open
arms.
"There's understandably some skepti
cism," said Jacob Klein, who worked with
Adauto on Motion Math. "There are funding
concerns, there are privacy concerns, there
are theft concerns. But mostly, people are
looking for a technological, quick solution to
problems.
"A while back, there was a big push for get
ting laptops into schools, but there wasn't
enough training for students and teachers, so it
didn't work out," he continued. "Naturally peo
ple are a bit worried."

Although the program has ended for this
group of students, the projects aren't over for
all of them.
The Equatia team is working with Rocket
Education, a network of charter elementary
schools, to bring their game to more students.
Motion Math is planning on releasing an entire
suite of math-related iPhone apps on the
iTunes App Store, all the way from fractions to
calculus. SaySo, a social language-learning
game, is going to offer its game to users of
English Cafe, a website that enables English
teachers and English learners to find each other
online.
But even though not all the projects will
move onto the commercial landscape, it's clear
from the faces on both the adults and the chil
dren at the EXPO that this kind of learning
experience will soon form the future of educa
tion.
"People get very excited about new technol
ogy," Klein said. "There's something inherent
ly motivating and delightful about using these
new devices. So why wouldn't we use them to
educate?"

2010 on Friday. McDaniel and fellow LDT student Tanya Flores spent a year designing, developing and testing the application, which promotes the consumption of locally grown foods.
