## Stanford graced by top women in tennis Azarenka tops Sharapova for singles title in the Farm's annual showcase of the sport 
### JOSEPH BEYDA DAILY INTERN 
Birthday girl Victoria Azarenka got two pre
sents at the Bank of the West Classic at Stan
ford's Taube Family Tennis Stadium this past
weekend. One was a mis-hit tennis ball in the
rear end from doubles partner Maria Kirilenko,
part of a dismal semifinal performance on Sat
urday that knocked the pair out of the tourna
ment.
The other was a check for $107,000, her prize
for winning the singles final a day later.
The 21-year-old Belarusian's 6-4,6-1 victory
over Maria Sharapova put her name alongside
numerous tennis legends who have won the
tournament greats including Venus
Williams, Chris Evert and Billie Jean King, one
of the event's founders.
"This was the first tournament of the year in
1971, which was the first year we really had a se
ries of tournaments for women in professional
tennis," King said at a pre-match ceremony.
At first, promoting the event was difficult
even legends such as King had to sell tickets and
stop cars on the street but the founders had a
clear goal.
"We wanted any little girl who wanted to in
the world, if she had the ability, to be able to
make a living as a professional athlete and an
entertainer to take tennis to people around the
globe," she said.
The Bank of the West Classic has exempli

fied that dream: with 40 years of tennis under its
belt, it is the longest-running women's profes
sional tennis tournament in existence, and the
first of 10 stops on the Sony Ericsson WTA
Tour before the U.S. Open.
Stanford has hosted the Bank of the West
Classic since 1997, and the tournament has a
distinct Cardinal presence in the form of leg
endary coach and tennis director Dick Gould,
who participated in the pre-match and award
ceremonies. Some fans showed up to back Car
dinal players Hilary Barte and Nicole Gibbs
early on, but Gibbs fell in qualifying and Barte
lost in the first round.
After their departures, Sharapova became
the fan favorite in the singles competition, yet
she fell short in the final after failing to match
Azarenka's consistent return game and serve.
A fourth career singles title and a giant stuffed
bear presented with the trophy were not
enough to satisfy Azarenka's birthday wishes,
however.
"I want a cake, I want some ice cream, some
thing besides salmon," she said.
Even though her birthday diet had been lim
ited to health food, Azarenka considered the
tournament a very positive experience, coming
back from injury as an eighth seed and beating
fifth-seeded Sharapova. Azarenka noted that
the venue was well prepared.
"They do this tournament on a college cam
pus," she said. "It's just amazing to see how well
they organize it."

Despite the fact that Taube hosts champi
ons on a regular basis Stanford's women's
tennis teams have won 17 national titles in the
years since 1978 the tournament brought
prestigious players of a different order, in
cluding former World No. 1 player Lindsay
Davenport.
Davenport came out of a two-year retire
ment to play doubles in the tournament along
side Liezel Huber as wild cards, and the pair
went on to win the title 7-5, 6-7 (8), [lO-8] over
Yung-Jan Chan and Jie Zheng on Sunday. The
victory gave Davenport a record sixth doubles
title (and ninth title overall) at the event.
"I'm so excited and so happy that I came
here," she said. "This is always one of my fa
vorite tournaments."
"It's in its 40th year, it's outrageous. It's been
such a great tournament," she added.
Many in the audience seemed to share that
sentiment, not just because of the high quality
professional tennis that the Bank of the West
Classic brought to Stanford but also for the fam
ily-friendly environment it created. Players
were routinely available for autographs, and
the tournament's bear mascot roamed around
the court after matches. When Davenport and
Huber's semifinal opponents retired, the pair
rallied with two young girls, who used their ten
nis abilities to entertain the crowd.
Just as Billie Jean King had hoped for.
