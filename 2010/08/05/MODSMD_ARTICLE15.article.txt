# NCAA needs to discipline more consistendy
## 
### ZACH ZIMMERMAN 
Let's roleplay for a minute.
You're a big shot at the NCAA.
It is your job to ensure that all
things run swimmingly, and
that one of the most powerful
amateur athletic organizations in the world
maintains a respectable image by practicing
what it preaches integrity and sports
manship, both on and off the field.
And let's say that included in this job is
the role of disciplinarian. You are the one
that determines when, how and to whom
punishment is administered. You've al
ready disallowed Oklahoma State star re
ceiver Dez Bryant from participating last
season for "failing to fully disclose" his in
teractions with former NFL star Deion
Sanders. Now I present you with another
player, this time a star quarterback, who
was not only charged with the theft from a
fraternity house, but also arrested on drug
and traffic charges.
Any person with a trace of common
sense in your position wouldn't even hesi
tate when making this decision, right? I
mean, if Bryant gets the hammer for talking
to a guy affiliated with the NFL, then some
one who violates the law three times on
some pretty serious charges should, at the
very least, miss some games.
Oh, you want to let him start for an SEC
school instead?
The case at hand is of former Oregon QB
Jeremiah Masoli. Those of you too elated
by Stanford's 51-42 victory over the Ducks
on November 7, 2009 probably forgot all
about Masoli's performance that day 334
yards passing, 55 rushing and four total
touchdowns. Needless to say, the dude is
pretty good at what he does.
Unfortunately for both Jeremiah and the
town of Eugene, Masoli eventually suc
cumbed to the evil spirits that seemed to
consume the entire Ducks football program
last season. After his first offense, burglariz
ing the Oregon chapter of Sigma Alpha Ep
silon, Masoli was banned by new coach
Chip Kelly for the entire 2010 season. How
ever, after being arrested just months later
for driving with a suspended license and for
possession of marijuana, he was dismissed
from the team altogether.
The guy was given a second chance after
his first slipup. Masoli could have taken the
route of teammate LeGarrette Blount,
whose famous punch in Boise on opening
night earned him nearly a full season on the
pine. The difference is that Blount miracu
lously kept his nose out of trouble during his
time in the doghouse. Masoli did not.
After these events I was inclined to think
that his college football playing days were
done, along with any real hope of playing at
the next level. Yet Masoli was given an al
most hysterical option to avoid terminating
his career. If he finished his undergraduate
degree (sociology) and was accepted to a
graduate program not offered at Oregon, he
would be allowed to walk on at his
new school.
And he did just that. Rumors
turned into reality, and if everything
pans out, Jeremiah Masoli will be the
frontrunner for the starting quarter
back position at Ole Miss. If you
were like me, you were more
intrigued with the exclusive graduate
program he would be enrolled in at
Mississippi than where he would be
playing football. Considering his edu
cational background, I was inclined
to think he'd harness his writing and
thinking skills, possibly delving into a
particular branch of social psycholo

gy or philosophy.
Masoli did not disappoint, choos
ing the most obvious master's pro
gram available: Parks and
Recreation Management.
Fair enough. I guess I see it as a
good fit; Masoli has demonstrated an
excellent understanding of greenery
and foliage—just ask the cop from
the second arrest. His quarterback
skills give him plenty of experience in
management, and from the incident
at SAE, he's clearly determined to
succeed even under a tight budget.
All jokes aside, the NCAA is out
of its mind.
The message being sent here is
not one of integrity and sportsman
ship, of being a role model both on
and off the field. All that is being
delivered is the idea that if you're
good enough at your sport, you'll get

another chance, regardless of how
many times you screw up. You want
to send a positive message? Get the
kid some help. Try to help him
understand the foundation of his
reckless behavior. If he really is con
cerned with the direction he is head
ed, he would be receptive to this
assistance. At the very least, make
him sit out a year to think things over
and demonstrate that he can get back
on track.
But he's not missing any time, and
come late August he will be compet
ing among many of the nation's best
teams for an SEC Title, The Rebels
have no chance in the perennially
stacked conference, but this is simply
about the principle. If the NCAA
truly wants to distinguish itself as a
respectable and dignified amateur
organization, then it needs to devel

op an ounce of disciplinary consisten
cy. Until then, it will continue to sim
ply look like the NFL's minor league.
And I do feel a little bad for pick
ing on one guy. Jeremiah is not the
sole example of questionable punish
ment. In fact, how can I hate on a guy
for wanting to pursue graduate edu
cation? However if you are like me,
and you probably are, you see this
more as a yearlong NFL tryout than
a genuine pursuit of a master's
degree.
Call me crazy, but if the NCAA is
doing the right thing, then Jeremiah
Masoli is the next Ranger Rick.

Zach Zimmerman is glad to see that
the NCAA is helping to put our
national parks in the right hands.

playing football. Considering his edu
cational background, I was inclined
to think he'd harness his writing and
thinking skills, possibly delving into a
particular branch of social psycholo

gy or philosophy.
Masoli did not disappoint, choos
ing the most obvious master's pro
gram available: Parks and
Recreation Management.
Fair enough. I guess I see it as a
good fit; Masoli has demonstrated an
excellent understanding of greenery
and foliage—just ask the cop from
the second arrest. His quarterback
skills give him plenty of experience in
management, and from the incident
at SAE, he's clearly determined to
succeed even under a tight budget.
All jokes aside, the NCAA is out
of its mind.
The message being sent here is
not one of integrity and sportsman
ship, of being a role model both on
and off the field. All that is being
delivered is the idea that if you're
good enough at your sport, you'll get

another chance, regardless of how
many times you screw up. You want
to send a positive message? Get the
kid some help. Try to help him
understand the foundation of his
reckless behavior. If he really is con
cerned with the direction he is head
ed, he would be receptive to this
assistance. At the very least, make
him sit out a year to think things over
and demonstrate that he can get back
on track.
But he's not missing any time, and
come late August he will be compet
ing among many of the nation's best
teams for an SEC Title, The Rebels
have no chance in the perennially
stacked conference, but this is simply
about the principle. If the NCAA
truly wants to distinguish itself as a
respectable and dignified amateur
organization, then it needs to devel

op an ounce of disciplinary consisten
cy. Until then, it will continue to sim
ply look like the NFL's minor league.
And I do feel a little bad for pick
ing on one guy. Jeremiah is not the
sole example of questionable punish
ment. In fact, how can I hate on a guy
for wanting to pursue graduate edu
cation? However if you are like me,
and you probably are, you see this
more as a yearlong NFL tryout than
a genuine pursuit of a master's
degree.
Call me crazy, but if the NCAA is
doing the right thing, then Jeremiah
Masoli is the next Ranger Rick.

Zach Zimmerman is glad to see that
the NCAA is helping to put our
national parks in the right hands.
