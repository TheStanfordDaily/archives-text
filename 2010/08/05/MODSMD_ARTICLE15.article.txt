# NCAA needs to discipline more consistendy

Let's roleplay for a minute.
You're a big shot at the NCAA.
It is your job to ensure that all
things run swimmingly, and
that one of the most powerful
amateur athletic organizations in the world
maintains a respectable image by practicing
what it preaches integrity and sports
manship, both on and off the field.
And let's say that included in this job is
the role of disciplinarian. You are the one
that determines when, how and to whom
punishment is administered. You've al
ready disallowed Oklahoma State star re
ceiver Dez Bryant from participating last
season for "failing to fully disclose" his in
teractions with former NFL star Deion
Sanders. Now I present you with another
player, this time a star quarterback, who
was not only charged with the theft from a
fraternity house, but also arrested on drug
and traffic charges.
Any person with a trace of common
sense in your position wouldn't even hesi
tate when making this decision, right? I
mean, if Bryant gets the hammer for talking
to a guy affiliated with the NFL, then some
one who violates the law three times on
some pretty serious charges should, at the
very least, miss some games.
Oh, you want to let him start for an SEC
school instead?
The case at hand is of former Oregon QB
Jeremiah Masoli. Those of you too elated
by Stanford's 51-42 victory over the Ducks
on November 7, 2009 probably forgot all
about Masoli's performance that day 334
yards passing, 55 rushing and four total
touchdowns. Needless to say, the dude is
pretty good at what he does.
Unfortunately for both Jeremiah and the
town of Eugene, Masoli eventually suc
cumbed to the evil spirits that seemed to
consume the entire Ducks football program
last season. After his first offense, burglariz
ing the Oregon chapter of Sigma Alpha Ep
silon, Masoli was banned by new coach
Chip Kelly for the entire 2010 season. How
ever, after being arrested just months later
for driving with a suspended license and for
possession of marijuana, he was dismissed
from the team altogether.
The guy was given a second chance after
his first slipup. Masoli could have taken the
route of teammate LeGarrette Blount,
whose famous punch in Boise on opening
night earned him nearly a full season on the
pine. The difference is that Blount miracu
lously kept his nose out of trouble during his
time in the doghouse. Masoli did not.
After these events I was inclined to think
that his college football playing days were
done, along with any real hope of playing at
the next level. Yet Masoli was given an al
most hysterical option to avoid terminating
his career. If he finished his undergraduate
degree (sociology) and was accepted to a
graduate program not offered at Oregon, he
