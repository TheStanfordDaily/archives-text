### â€” Joseph Beyda 
Stanford players Nnemkadi Og
wumike and Kayla Pedersen were
named to the "Wade Watch" list
Wednesday for the so-called "Heis
man of Women's Basketball," the
State Farm Wade Trophy Division I
Player of the Year award.
The list includes 25 players from
across the country, only three of
which compete for a school on the
West Coast. Ogwumike and Peder
sen are the only selections from the
Pac-10.
Ogwumike's second season at
Stanford last year was marked by a
school single-season record of 376
rebounds as well as her perfor
mance against Oregon on Jan. 23, in
which she recorded a record 23
boards. She led the Pac-10 with 18.5
points a game and a 60.9 shooting
percentage, earning her State Farm
Coaches Ail-American honors for
the first time.
Pedersen has been named to the
"Wade Watch" list after each of her
three seasons on the Farm, and last
year averaged 15.8 points a game.
She has recorded 1,501 points and
986 rebounds so far, and she has the
opportunity to be just the fourth
player in Stanford history to con
tribute 2,000 points and 1,000
rebounds over a career.
