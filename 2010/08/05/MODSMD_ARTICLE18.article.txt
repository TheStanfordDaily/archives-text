# For Bechtol, running is nothing new
## The 						story behind the surprise winner of the San Francisco Marathon 
### KEVIN ZHANG DAILY INTERN 
It seemed highly unlikely that a Stanford grad
uate student and first-time marathoner could win
the San Francisco Marathon on July 25, but Keith
Bechtol, a 25-year-old astrophysics student on the
Farm, didn't just win the marathon he beat the
26.2 mile course record by two minutes.
Although this is only his first marathon, Bech
tol has significant experience in competitive run
ning. He ran track and cross country at the Col
lege of William and Mary and was 14th in the 2007
NCAA 10K Championships. Even with his time
commitments, Bechtol had an intense six weeks
of training.
"I trained fairly hard for four weeks and went
lighter the last two weeks," Bechtol said. "I aimed
for a 20 mile-long run each of the hard weeks and
practiced running at a goal race pace on the track
to build confidence and get a sense for the speed I
needed to maintain over the full distance."
After his training, Bechtol had a unique mind
set going into the marathon by not setting certain
time or placement objectives.
"San Francisco was my first attempt at the
marathon, so I did not set any specific goals,"
Bechtol said. "I had experience at longer and
shorter distances, but it had been a couple years
since I had trained or raced competitively. After a
while, you learn to listen to your body and so
mostly, I was going for a specific effort rather than
a particular time or place."
Listening to his body, Bechtol finished the
course with a time of two hours 23 minutes and 28
seconds, two minutes ahead of the second-place
finisher Michael Wardian, a 36-year-old from Ar
lington, Va.
"I am still pleasantly surprised with how
smoothly the day went," Bechtol said. "I certain
ly have strong days and also days when I really
struggle during training. You never know exactly
how you will feel on the day that counts, but it is
always satisfying when you feel like you reached
your potential for that given day. Mostly it gives
me motivation to see how much I can improve
from here."
When Bechtol finished the race, his wife, Ellen
was there to greet him. Ellen, who Bechtol met
running track and cross country at the College of

William and Mary, is part of Bechtol's new sup
port system here at Stanford, which has helped
him manage the transition to the Farm.
"When I first arrived at Stanford, I felt very
alone, having just moved across the country and
my running felt unfocused and disconnected,"
Bechtol said. "College also felt like a time of in-

tense personal development and now I feel much
more responsibility in many aspects of my life."
He has gradually found his place on the cam
pus, however, and running, including with his
training partner, computer science graduate stu
dent Spence Green, has played a big role.
"Over time, I have felt more and more com
fortable here and have been able to share my
sports enthusiasm with others and draw off their
energy and support," he said.
Within this newly positive atmosphere, Bech
tol has found ways to balance his numerous activ
ities: life as a student, work at NASA and family
commitments.
"I try to run every day and use basically any
time that is available," he said. "I often wish I had
a more predictable schedule and have found that
extremely difficult while balancing my academic
goals and the general day-to-day life. My priori
ties go in the order family, school and running and
so it is a delicate balance, although not in a con
flicting way at all."
As Bechtol celebrates his victory and enjoys
the enthusiastic support from his peers in the
physics department and at SLAC National Accel
erator Laboratory, he is just beginning what
seems to be a string of marathons across the na
tion.
"I hope to enter more marathons over the
coming year. Right now I am looking at Chicago
[in October] and Boston [in April], but it will all
depend on my academic schedule and staying
healthy."

It may have been the first-ever marathon for Keith
Bechtol, above, but the astrophysics graduate
student and former NCAA cross-country athlete
has a background in competitive running.
