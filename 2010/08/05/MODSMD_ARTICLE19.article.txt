# For all sports fans, hope springs as the season looms
## 
### TOM TAYLOR 
At last, the long wait is almost over.
This weekend, after a drought of 13
weeks, the new football season kicks
off in England.
Regular readers of this column might be be
mused about my timekeeping, given that the
World Cup finished less than a month ago, but in
ternational and domestic football are practically
different sports. Allegiances are entirely different
(players can be loved in one and hated in the
other), the scale and commitment are different
(supporting a team in the World Cup requires
paying attention only a few weeks in four years,
while doing the same for a domestic side is a full
time job) and the quality is different (I don't think
a single one of my domestic team's players even
had a run-out in South Africa).
What matters now is the stretch of 576 games
in the English Football League Championship
that will hold my undivided attention for the next
nine months an odyssey of highs and lows that

begins in just a few days.
Every fan, of every sport, surely has a similar
annual experience. At season's end, the weeks
seem to stretch out ahead. In the first few days ju
bilant fans, still drunk on the glory of a tri
umphant year, reminisce over what has passed
while their counterparts those whose teams
were merely average or decidedly awful do
their best to forget.
Soon, however, both successes and failures
are put aside, and as supporters find their week
ends suddenly empty, the boredom sets in. Some
dabble in other sports, hobbies or home im
provement projects, while others use the time as
an excuse to head off on vacation. But as distract
ing as these might be, they can never quite fill the
gap-
The clock is steadily ticking down throughout
all of this, and having satiated other interests, the
fans slowly start turning their thoughts back to
the approaching season. Here and there, real
news starts creeping back into the sports pages:
gossip and rumors about player transfers and fan
ciful predictions of the twists and turns in the ac
tion ahead.

And so begins the most exciting time of the

year. Like a second Christmas, fans dare to hope
that Santa has brought them that league-winning
team they asked for. Teams rebuilt from both
new and old players lie untested like well
wrapped presents. Journalists and supporters
alike can perhaps rattle the box a little, with in
terviews and analyses of performances in pre
season friendlies, to try and discover what lies be
neath the paper, but until that first game no one
really knows what they've got.
Across the country it is the one time when
every fan has reason to be hopeful. Despair and
misery have not yet had a chance to gain a
foothold and even recent history becomes mean
ingless. A championship-winning team could win
again, or fall to pieces as egos clash, and, with a
healthy dose of luck, a minnow could reverse its
star-crossed fortunes and become a real con
tender. The league table is a pristine field of ze
roes that has every team tied for first, and dead
equal for last.
My hometown team, Reading FC, should
start this season hopeful of a shot at promotion
back into one of the biggest leagues in the World,
the English Premiership. Out of the 24 teams in
the Championship, three will ascend upward and

three will be relegated downward. Barely six
months ago the latter looked like it would be
Reading's fate, with an awful first half of the year
putting a pre-season favorite all the way down to
second from last. But a change of manager turned
everything around, and it went all the way to the
sixth round (quarter-finals) of the FA cup and
finished comfortably above mid-table in the
league. The only regret to the miracle was that
had this reinvention happened just a few games
earlier, Reading might now be preparing for a re
turn to the top-flight.
There have been inevitable transfers in and
out over the off-season, but the core of the team
is ostensibly the same one that was drawing ad
mirers only a few weeks back. But nothing is ever
easy or pre-ordained in sports, and in a league
often described as the most competitive in the
world, it seems almost inevitable that there will
be suffering to come.
At least for now, though, I can dream along
side everyone else.
