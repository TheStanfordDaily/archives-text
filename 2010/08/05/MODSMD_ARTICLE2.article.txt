## LOCAL Federal court repeals same-sex marriage ban 
### AMY JULIA HARRIS JANE LEPHAM 
In a long-awaited victory for gay
rights advocates, a federal judge in
San Francisco struck down Proposi
tion 8 yesterday, overturning the
2008 voter initiative banning same
sex marriage in California.
The decision from federal judge
Vaughn Walker, J.D. '7O was lauded
by gay-rights luminaries as a major
win for civil rights, while lambasted
by traditional marriage groups, who
have said that they will appeal the
ruling to the United States Court of
Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. While
Walker's ruling overturns Prop. 8,
the decision will not immediately
lead to any new same-sex marriages
in the state of California.
This decision was the news that
Aidan Dunn 'll had been waiting
for since he came out at age 15. He
was one of the thousands of citizens
in San Francisco who celebrated
Walker's ruling on the San Francis
co courthouse steps yesterday after
noon.
"Today is a great day," Dunn
said. "For me personally, it means
that someday I might be able to
marry the person that I love. What I
hope it means for the community is
that we start fighting for more queer
and social justice issues."
Dunn, now 26, has been an ac

tivist for gay rights for 11 years, and
has traveled the globe as a queer am
bassador pressing for equality. He
worked on the "No on Prop. 8" cam
paign at Stanford in the fall of 2008,
and celebrated via Facebook with
the scores of other Stanford students

who had raised their voices on the
issue.
If the ruling is upheld, California
would join Connecticut, lowa,
Massachusetts, New Hampshire,
Vermont and Washington, D.C. in
allowing gay marriage.

Also celebrating the news was
Kenzie Seal 'l2, co-founder of the
National Marriage Boycott (NMB)
and NMB's current chief financial
officer, who started the youth-led
movement to swear off marriage
until homosexual couples are grant
ed full federal marriage equality.
He attended a rally yesterday af
ternoon in San Francisco, along with
throngs of other supporters, to ap
plaud Walker's decision.
"For the first time in the history
of Prop. 8, this will be a celebration,"
Seal said. "This one will have a lot
more energy than what we've seen
in the past. We fell into a sort of los
ing streak, but it's great to see equal
ity finally come out on top."
Stanford students overwhelming
agreed with Seal back in 2008, with
87 percent voting against Prop. 8, ac
cording to a 147-person exit poll
conducted by The Daily at the Grad
uate Community Center on Elec
tion Day. Californians, however, did
not feel the same way, with voters
approving the ban on gay marriage
by a 52-percent margin, six months
after the California Supreme Court
had ruled than the state constitution
allowed same-sex marriage. The
state high court later upheld Prop. 8
as a legitimate revision to the state
Constitution.

Aidan Dunn '11 celebrates in front of the Courthouse in San Francisco, as
Judge Vaughn Walker announced his decision to overturn Proposition 8
yesterday. Dunn is a longtime activist for gay rights and praised the ruling.
Judge Walker viewed the case as
an equality issue as well, striking
down arguments from the prosecu
tion on the grounds of due process
and equal protection.
"Proposition 8 singles out gays
and lesbians and legitimates their un
equal treatment," he wrote in his
136-page decision. "Proposition 8
perpetuates the stereotype that gays
and lesbians are incapable of form
ing long-term loving relationships
and that gays and lesbians are not
good parents."
Protect Marriage, the network of
conservative groups that sponsored
the ban, was not pleased with the rul
ing and said it would immediately ap
peal to the United States Court of
Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. The
case could eventually make its way to
the United States Supreme Court,
where the justices would finally con
front the question of whether same
sex couples have the right to marry.
But don't call the ruling a land
mark just yet, said Michael Wald, an
emeritus professor at the law school.
"I think it's an important ruling,"

Wald said. "It's the first federal
court, as opposed to a state court,
that has ruled that prohibitions on
same-sex marriage are unconstitu
tional. The state supreme courts in
Massachusetts, Connecticut and Cal
ifornia, for example, have all ruled
this based on state constitutions. In
this sense, I think today's decision is
a very important ruling, but it's not
anything that hasn't been done be
fore."
Gary Segura, a political science
professor who also testified on the
civil rights implications at the Prop. 8
trial, agreed.
"I believe that this has the poten
tial to be landmark case, but again,
we're just not sure because this has to
go through the appellate process," he
said. "Ultimately, if the Supreme
Court upholds Walker's decision,
this could be the most important case
for gay rights. And if the Supreme
Court doesn't uphold this decision,
this would be a step in the right direc
tion, but it would be another case
that was unsuccessful. We just won't
know for another year or more."
Still, moving the issue up the legal
pipeline is progress, Dunn said. In his
years working on the issue, he says
this victory may be the most signifi
cant.
Jeff Gerson 'l2, who currently in

terns at The Advocate, a gay news
magazine and website based in Los
Angeles, says this may be a victory,
but it's a long time in coming. He said
that he felt more vindication than
surprise at Walker's ruling.
Gerson threw himself into the gay
rights cause as a freshman, manning
phone banks and picketing at rallies
around campus. He was emotionally
stricken when Prop. 8 passed.
"It was a devastating blow
everyone was dressed in black," he
remembered. "To be honest, it wore
a lot of us out."
"I think this is really good because
it gives advocates a huge boost and
brings us back into the picture," he
added.
But Seal doesn't think the fight is
over by any means. Judge Walker's
decision won't go into effect until the
appeal is processed, due to a hold
that the judge himself put on the rul
ing. And if it goes to the Supreme
Court, Seal says, "it's not going to be
an easy victory."
"We're not done yet," Dunn
agreed. "But it's nice to take some
time to celebrate because really, this
is a big deal."

sex couples have the right to marry.
But don't call the ruling a land
mark just yet, said Michael Wald, an
emeritus professor at the law school.
"I think it's an important ruling,"

Wald said. "It's the first federal
court, as opposed to a state court,
that has ruled that prohibitions on
same-sex marriage are unconstitu
tional. The state supreme courts in
Massachusetts, Connecticut and Cal
ifornia, for example, have all ruled
this based on state constitutions. In
this sense, I think today's decision is
a very important ruling, but it's not
anything that hasn't been done be
fore."
Gary Segura, a political science
professor who also testified on the
civil rights implications at the Prop. 8
trial, agreed.
"I believe that this has the poten
tial to be landmark case, but again,
we're just not sure because this has to
go through the appellate process," he
said. "Ultimately, if the Supreme
Court upholds Walker's decision,
this could be the most important case
for gay rights. And if the Supreme
Court doesn't uphold this decision,
this would be a step in the right direc
tion, but it would be another case
that was unsuccessful. We just won't
know for another year or more."
Still, moving the issue up the legal
pipeline is progress, Dunn said. In his
years working on the issue, he says
this victory may be the most signifi
cant.
Jeff Gerson 'l2, who currently in

terns at The Advocate, a gay news
magazine and website based in Los
Angeles, says this may be a victory,
but it's a long time in coming. He said
that he felt more vindication than
surprise at Walker's ruling.
Gerson threw himself into the gay
rights cause as a freshman, manning
phone banks and picketing at rallies
around campus. He was emotionally
stricken when Prop. 8 passed.
"It was a devastating blow
everyone was dressed in black," he
remembered. "To be honest, it wore
a lot of us out."
"I think this is really good because
it gives advocates a huge boost and
brings us back into the picture," he
added.
But Seal doesn't think the fight is
over by any means. Judge Walker's
decision won't go into effect until the
appeal is processed, due to a hold
that the judge himself put on the rul
ing. And if it goes to the Supreme
Court, Seal says, "it's not going to be
an easy victory."
"We're not done yet," Dunn
agreed. "But it's nice to take some
time to celebrate because really, this
is a big deal."

In a long-awaited victory for gay
rights advocates, a federal judge in
San Francisco struck down Proposi
tion 8 yesterday, overturning the
2008 voter initiative banning same
sex marriage in California.
The decision from federal judge
Vaughn Walker, J.D. '7O was lauded
by gay-rights luminaries as a major
win for civil rights, while lambasted
by traditional marriage groups, who
have said that they will appeal the
ruling to the United States Court of
Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. While
Walker's ruling overturns Prop. 8,
the decision will not immediately
lead to any new same-sex marriages
in the state of California.
This decision was the news that
Aidan Dunn 'll had been waiting
for since he came out at age 15. He
was one of the thousands of citizens
in San Francisco who celebrated
Walker's ruling on the San Francis
co courthouse steps yesterday after
noon.
"Today is a great day," Dunn
said. "For me personally, it means
that someday I might be able to
marry the person that I love. What I
hope it means for the community is
that we start fighting for more queer
and social justice issues."
Dunn, now 26, has been an ac

tivist for gay rights for 11 years, and
has traveled the globe as a queer am
bassador pressing for equality. He
worked on the "No on Prop. 8" cam
paign at Stanford in the fall of 2008,
and celebrated via Facebook with
the scores of other Stanford students

who had raised their voices on the
issue.
If the ruling is upheld, California
would join Connecticut, lowa,
Massachusetts, New Hampshire,
Vermont and Washington, D.C. in
allowing gay marriage.

Also celebrating the news was
Kenzie Seal 'l2, co-founder of the
National Marriage Boycott (NMB)
and NMB's current chief financial
officer, who started the youth-led
movement to swear off marriage
until homosexual couples are grant
ed full federal marriage equality.
He attended a rally yesterday af
ternoon in San Francisco, along with
throngs of other supporters, to ap
plaud Walker's decision.
"For the first time in the history
of Prop. 8, this will be a celebration,"
Seal said. "This one will have a lot
more energy than what we've seen
in the past. We fell into a sort of los
ing streak, but it's great to see equal
ity finally come out on top."
Stanford students overwhelming
agreed with Seal back in 2008, with
87 percent voting against Prop. 8, ac
cording to a 147-person exit poll
conducted by The Daily at the Grad
uate Community Center on Elec
tion Day. Californians, however, did
not feel the same way, with voters
approving the ban on gay marriage
by a 52-percent margin, six months
after the California Supreme Court
had ruled than the state constitution
allowed same-sex marriage. The
state high court later upheld Prop. 8
as a legitimate revision to the state
Constitution.

Aidan Dunn '11 celebrates in front of the Courthouse in San Francisco, as
Judge Vaughn Walker announced his decision to overturn Proposition 8
yesterday. Dunn is a longtime activist for gay rights and praised the ruling.
Judge Walker viewed the case as
an equality issue as well, striking
down arguments from the prosecu
tion on the grounds of due process
and equal protection.
"Proposition 8 singles out gays
and lesbians and legitimates their un
equal treatment," he wrote in his
136-page decision. "Proposition 8
perpetuates the stereotype that gays
and lesbians are incapable of form
ing long-term loving relationships
and that gays and lesbians are not
good parents."
Protect Marriage, the network of
conservative groups that sponsored
the ban, was not pleased with the rul
ing and said it would immediately ap
peal to the United States Court of
Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. The
case could eventually make its way to
the United States Supreme Court,
where the justices would finally con
front the question of whether same
sex couples have the right to marry.
But don't call the ruling a land
mark just yet, said Michael Wald, an
emeritus professor at the law school.
