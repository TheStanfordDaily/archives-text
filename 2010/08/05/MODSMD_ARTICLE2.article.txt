## LOCAL Federal court repeals same-sex marriage ban 
### AMY JULIA HARRIS JANE LEPHAM 
In a long-awaited victory for gay
rights advocates, a federal judge in
San Francisco struck down Proposi
tion 8 yesterday, overturning the
2008 voter initiative banning same
sex marriage in California.
The decision from federal judge
Vaughn Walker, J.D. '7O was lauded
by gay-rights luminaries as a major
win for civil rights, while lambasted
by traditional marriage groups, who
have said that they will appeal the
ruling to the United States Court of
Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. While
Walker's ruling overturns Prop. 8,
the decision will not immediately
lead to any new same-sex marriages
in the state of California.
This decision was the news that
Aidan Dunn 'll had been waiting
for since he came out at age 15. He
was one of the thousands of citizens
in San Francisco who celebrated
Walker's ruling on the San Francis
co courthouse steps yesterday after
noon.
"Today is a great day," Dunn
said. "For me personally, it means
that someday I might be able to
marry the person that I love. What I
hope it means for the community is
that we start fighting for more queer
and social justice issues."
Dunn, now 26, has been an ac

tivist for gay rights for 11 years, and
has traveled the globe as a queer am
bassador pressing for equality. He
worked on the "No on Prop. 8" cam
paign at Stanford in the fall of 2008,
and celebrated via Facebook with
the scores of other Stanford students

who had raised their voices on the
issue.
If the ruling is upheld, California
would join Connecticut, lowa,
Massachusetts, New Hampshire,
Vermont and Washington, D.C. in
allowing gay marriage.

Also celebrating the news was
Kenzie Seal 'l2, co-founder of the
National Marriage Boycott (NMB)
and NMB's current chief financial
officer, who started the youth-led
movement to swear off marriage
until homosexual couples are grant
ed full federal marriage equality.
He attended a rally yesterday af
ternoon in San Francisco, along with
throngs of other supporters, to ap
plaud Walker's decision.
"For the first time in the history
of Prop. 8, this will be a celebration,"
Seal said. "This one will have a lot
more energy than what we've seen
in the past. We fell into a sort of los
ing streak, but it's great to see equal
ity finally come out on top."
Stanford students overwhelming
agreed with Seal back in 2008, with
87 percent voting against Prop. 8, ac
cording to a 147-person exit poll
conducted by The Daily at the Grad
uate Community Center on Elec
tion Day. Californians, however, did
not feel the same way, with voters
approving the ban on gay marriage
by a 52-percent margin, six months
after the California Supreme Court
had ruled than the state constitution
allowed same-sex marriage. The
state high court later upheld Prop. 8
as a legitimate revision to the state
Constitution.
