## MUSIC REVIEW Wandering "The Orchard" with Ra Ra Riot Sophomore album relies on reflection 
### — ryan MAC contact ryan: rbmac@stanford. edu 
It all came too fast for Ra Ra Riot.
Too, too, too fast. Formed in 2006 in
Syracuse, the band was primed to be
the next indie blog sweethearts. And for
all intents and purposes, they were.
There were the glowing reviews and the
opening tours: Editors and later, Tokyo
Police Club. There were the Daytrotter
sessions and the smashing South by
Southwest appearances.
But there was also death.
The loss of drummer John Pike before
the band had released their first full
album put Ra Ra Riot at a crossroads, one
that came much too soon for their, or
anyone's, liking. Where do we go from
here? Where can we go from here?
Yet, they picked themselves back up,
channeling their emotions into "The
Rhumb Line," a 10-track arrangement of
strings, nostalgia and a renewed sense of
being. And much as Pike was a force in
actual creation he co-wrote most of the
songs with frontman Wes Miles —he
seemed an even bigger presence as an
inspiration, allowing the band to focus on
a single cause in the memory of a friend.
Try getting over the sophomore hump
with that void to fill.
"The Orchard" represents the band's
second bite at the cherry, but it also rep
resents the traversing of another cross
road. With little time to breathe since
their first release in 2008 and a subse
quent whirlwind of tours, the band used
the time they had to create their second
album for a little reflection. Heading to
an orchard in upstate New York, they
found peace, and peaches, isolating
themselves in a world that mixed farm
equipment with recording equipment.
It's isolation that's bred introspection.
As much as "The Rhumb Line" was
extroverted sharing very raw emotions
and memories in a collection of upbeat
percussion and energy "The Orchard"
is introverted. The title track saunters in
at a slower pace than anything we've
heard before, carried by "Eleanor Rigby"-
esque string arrangement and moping
bass-line, which pops up throughout the
10-tracker, via Mathieu Santos. It's dark
er than anything we've seen before, with
Miles wailing, "All my life, you were
important, and your father too, wander
ing the orchard." Even more symbolic is
the absence on the track of the band's new
drummer, Gabriel Duquette, serving as a
subtle transition away from the influence
of Pike.

The transition is an important one too.
As Miles said in an earlier interview,
many of the other band members provid
ed input during the songwriting process,
as well as vocal contributions. Cellist
Alexandra Lawn takes over the mic for
"You and I Know," doing her best Nancy
Sinatra impression on the gentle lullaby,
before the song takes off in a flurry of
edgy guitar. "Massachusetts" is just as
light, as the band directs the influence of
pals, Vampire Weekend, toward its own
little "Cape Cod Kwassa Kwassa." The
only anomaly on the album seems to be
the fun "Boy," the single, which is a
reversion to older tendencies and an
energy pinnacle that isn't matched any
where else on "The Orchard."

As much as the album is one for long
summer days ruminating under a weath
ered fruit tree, it also serves as the band's
commitment to orchestral strings. The
violin and cello are not accessories, but
rather a means for structuring, layering
and maturing songs, as seen from San
Diego shout-out "Kansai" to the lovely
"Shadowcasting." The latter, punctuated

by the warmest of cello contributions,
highlights the power of an instrument
unfamiliar to the genre and unheralded
outside the likes of one omnipotent virtu
oso that no one actually listens to, but fre
quently namedrops: Yo-Yo Ma. "Too
Dramatic," an early live-performance

favorite, is cast in the same mold and
feels like a subtle jab at anyone who ever
criticized the band for expressing them
selves after the loss of their close friend.
And despite the occasional muddying
when Miles' high-pitched contributions
get caught up with the violins, the com
mitment is one that provides ample
reward in the development of the band's
sound.

In this sense "Foolish" is pay dirt, as
Miles plops himself behind a piano for a
ballad that pushes the band's instrumen
tal limits and the lead singer's windpipes.
He sings: "I don't know myself, but I
know you. How can you be so callous?
How can you be so callous?" framed by a
crescendo of strings, and one haphazard,
but innocent guitar repetition.
If that wasn't enough for thought, the
album ends with "Keep It Quiet," cleaned
up from the 10-fi version featured on the
"Boy" single. Sounding as if the band
locked itself in a church with an organ,
the dirge asks for nothing more than

calm, some time for recollection
and the closest of friends to
enjoy it with. The band harmo
nizes, "Keep it quiet, keep it
quiet, oh my heartbeat keep it
quiet. Through the doorway,
keep it quiet. Yes I'm tired, keep
it quiet." It's a simple request,
but for Ra Ra Riot, it's a much
needed one. They're just look
ing for some peace.
