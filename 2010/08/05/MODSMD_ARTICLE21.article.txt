## Villa 8: not a great place for dinner 
### â€” tommy TOBIN contact tommy: ttobin@stanford. edu 
I had high hopes about Villa 8 in
Mountain View.
Unfortunately, I was soon dis
appointed.
I have wanted to try its pan-
Asian cuisine since the place
opened. The large buffet, replete
with staples such as a sushi bar, a
soup selection and chicken skew
ers, is reminiscent of the smorgas
bord at my favorite restaurant in
high school. The gigantic build
ing at the corner of Villa Street in
downtown Mountain View is
quite the location, especially as it's
near the wondrous Verde Tea.
But I was wrong.
Walking into Villa 8, I heard a
disembodied voice. There was no

hostess. Instead, the faceless
sound of a woman's voice greeted
our party upon entrance to the
dining area. I watched my party
parse the variety of options at
Villa 8, ranging from hot and sour
soup to dim sum to raw oysters.
For the 90 minutes or so that
we dined at Villa 8, I saw just one
dish refreshed on the buffet,
apart from the sushi. When I saw
an employee bring out a dish of
dim sum at minute 75, I had two
thoughts. First, dim sum here was
not that great. Second, was this
the only dish being refilled? It
was unsettling to think that the
food had been sitting out for an
extended period.

Also, at one point it appeared
the sushi chef had hurt himself.
My dining partner immediately
lost his color when he saw what
could have been dirt or blood on
the sushi chefs shirt as the chef
conversed with the servers and
pointed at his arm.
To add insult to this apparent
injury, the main waiter was drink
ing some beer with his dinner and
served us. He smelled of alcohol
as he took our orders and served
our food.
The food was sub-par. The
shark fin soup was gelatinous,
thick and flavorless. The chicken
skewers had too much gristle. The
pot stickers were all right, but the

honey chicken was appalling. The
crab legs were briny and I would
not dare trust their raw oysters.
Villa 8 is an eat-at-your-own
risk type of buffet. Perhaps my
hopes were set too high or I
caught them a bad time, but I was
sorely disappointed by dinner.
Some improvement, however,
came with dessert: the soft-serve
was good, the sesame balls were
decent and one member of my
party adored the egg tarts.
