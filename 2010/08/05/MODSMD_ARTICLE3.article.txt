## HP's Frier will be CIO in September 
### AN LE NGUYEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Kenneth Frier, M.B.A. 'B4 has been named Stan
ford Management Company's (SMC) chief invest
ment officer (CIO), a position he currently holds at the
Hewlett-Packard Company. Frier is primed to man
age the nation's third-richest college endowment, a
charge he will share with SMC president and chief ex
ecutive officer John Powers, M.B.A. 'B3.
Frier's induction to the SMC team at the start of
September will mark the end of a decade-long career
at Hewlett-Packard. His recent appointment is the re
sult of an extensive search led by David Barrett Part
ners.
"We looked at a lot of candidates because we have
very high standards," Powers said of the CIO search.
"We were looking for someone who we thought was a
great investor with, ideally, a complementary set of
skills to what others at the Management Company
bring to the table. We thought Ken had very comple
mentary skills."
According to Powers, what set
Frier apart from other candidates
was his strong background in risk
management, an area where the new
CIO is expected to play an active
role.
"I hope to enhance the ability of
SMC to accurately quantify the risk
that the endowment portfolios are
facing and, having quantified those
risks, make good decisions with re
spect to which risks we should dimin
ish and which risks are worth taking,"
Frier said.
Frier will also be tasked with port
folio construction and manager selec
tion. In brief, this entails determining
how much money should be allocat
ed to different asset classes and find
ing capable investment managers to
run them.
Powers said that SMC, as a whole,
aims to generate strong risk-adjusted
gains in the new fiscal year. This will
stand in stark contrast to fiscal year
2009, when the University endow
ment reportedly declined by 27 per
cent a number well above the
18.7-percent national average.
Looking to the future, Frier listed
three top priorities for his tenure as
CIO. The first, he said, is to get a firm
grasp on SMC's strategic review of
the University endowment.
"One of our most interesting chal
lenges is ... analyzing opportunities
to improve on the endowment
model," Frier said. "My understand
ing is that there's been an endow
ment strategic review underway since
last year, with just this purpose in
mind."
This comes at a time when mount
ing skepticism has been raised about
the prevailing endowment model,
whereby universities employ low liq
uidity investment options to enhance
returns.
Frier indicated that risk manage
ment would be a second priority and
enhancing information flow a third.
Of the latter, he underscored the im
portance of capitalizing on Stanford's
"unparalleled access" to expert in
vestment managers namely, the
SMC team, alums and the Stanford
community at large.

In that vein, Frier has his sights set
on developing an active interchange
between SMC and the Graduate
School of Business (GSB).
"I think that it's going to be great
when SMC is in the business school
complex on campus," Frier stated.
"That'll be a great opportunity for us
to interact with the students at the
business school and the faculty, and
have a mutually beneficial relation
ship."
He believes that such collabora
tion will enable Stanford Manage
ment Company to be attuned to
scholarly work done by GSB faculty,
especially work that goes beyond re
hashing modern portfolio theory and
accounts for actual market behav
iors.
Frier also sees the opportunity for
SMC to gain some fresh talent; he
pondered the idea of taking on cur
rent GSB students as summer interns
and hiring graduates to the endow
ment staff. He said that SMC experts
could, in turn, provide guest lectures
to business school classes.
"Given the thinking that we'll be
doing with regard to how to manage
investment portfolios, our insights
and conclusions could be of benefit to
the students," he added.
Overall, these musings highlight
the ClO's close attachment to the
Farm.
"I went to Stanford Business
School, I made a lot of friends there,
I got married at Stanford Memorial
Church, I'm a Stanford sports fan,"
Frier said. "I have a lot of personal
connections with Stanford."
But while Frier and Powers re
ceived their M.B.A.'s only one year
apart, neither recalls meeting the
other during their time at the GSB.
"I never ever recall meeting lohn
on campus," Frier said, quickly
adding, "His spouse is one of my
classmates."
Frier emphasized, however, that his
many ties to the University are only
part of the appeal of his new job a
compatible philosophy is another.
"The mission that Stanford has is
quite valuable and the work that we'll
be doing will help deserving students
get an education, will help with re
search and will help generally with
the challenges of the future," he said.
