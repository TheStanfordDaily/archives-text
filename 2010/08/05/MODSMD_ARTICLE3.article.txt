## HP's Frier will be CIO in September 
### AN LE NGUYEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Kenneth Frier, M.B.A. 'B4 has been named Stan
ford Management Company's (SMC) chief invest
ment officer (CIO), a position he currently holds at the
Hewlett-Packard Company. Frier is primed to man
age the nation's third-richest college endowment, a
charge he will share with SMC president and chief ex
ecutive officer John Powers, M.B.A. 'B3.
Frier's induction to the SMC team at the start of
September will mark the end of a decade-long career
at Hewlett-Packard. His recent appointment is the re
sult of an extensive search led by David Barrett Part
ners.
"We looked at a lot of candidates because we have
very high standards," Powers said of the CIO search.
"We were looking for someone who we thought was a
great investor with, ideally, a complementary set of
skills to what others at the Management Company
bring to the table. We thought Ken had very comple
mentary skills."
