## Thai Café set to reopen in Sept. Project delayed since spring quarter due to permitting

The Thai Cafe is set to reopen
Sept. 20, two doors down from its
original location in the basement of
Jordan Hall. The cafe was scheduled
to open by the start of the spring
quarter, but was delayed until the be
ginning of the fall quarter.
"This took longer than I thought
and it's not easy for me since I've
been out of work for a year now, but
I'm looking forward to opening in
September," said Maykhanh
Bahlman, owner of the Thai Cafe. "I
miss my customers."
The construction gave the cafe a
fully upgraded kitchen to meet the
current health codes and require
ments, and consolidates the kitchen
and serving areas. This new setup will
allow Bahlman to serve food through
a window in the mass courtyard.
"It gets all the serving out of the
hallway and into a more accessible
area," said Shannon Silva, facilities
planner for the H&S Dean's Office.
"Students and faculty can now order
food through the window and take it
back to wherever they need to be. It's
much more convenient."
Though there are certain advan
tages for the new setup, Bahlman is
worried about the effects of some key
differences.
"It's a lot smaller and there isn't as
much space as there used to be," she
said. "It might be a little bit slower,
but I am thinking of ways to speed
things up so it the wait won't be too
long. It's very different for us, but
we'll manage."
The menu and culture of the
restaurant will remain unchanged, ac
cording to Bahlman.
"There's no inside seating as
usual, but there are about a dozen pic
nic tables outside just like there used
to be," she said.
The cafe was asked to relocate and
find a new home due to the formation

of an academic research project,
called the Cognitive Neurobiological
Imaging Center.
"We spoke with the owner, had a
few meetings and explained the re
search needs to her," Silva said. "She
was very flexible with us to work for
the greater good of the academics.
She's been really great."
Bahlman has been meeting with
contractors and project managers at
the Dean's office every two weeks
since last June to follow the process of
her cafe construction.
"Everything is going smoothly,"
she said. "Everything should be okay
and ready by the middle-end of Au
gust, and I will have time to prepare
for all the students coming back to
school for the fall quarter."
She is still currently negotiating a
contract for the cafe and waiting on
the Dean's office for the specifics of
the document.
"I don't have anything solid right
now," she said. "They're working on
it, and I don't know any of the details
about it yet."
The original reopening date of the

cafe was scheduled for the start of
spring quarter, but was pushed back
due to delays in retrieving a building
permit from the county.
As of now, construction is on
schedule and expected to be complet
ed in the last week of August, Silva
said.
"The owner will have time to get
her permit, and to get everything up
and running just in time for the first
day of school," she said.
All that's left to do is complete the
construction, attain business and
health permits from the county health
department, and other logistics and
planning for the cafe including in
spection by the Santa Clara Health
Department, which requires all the
foods to be examined before sales.
"We're very excited that the Thai
Cafe will be reopening, and the
owner is excited as well," Silva said.
"We hope it will have a great turnout
in its reopening during the first week
of school."
