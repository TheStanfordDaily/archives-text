# STUDENT LIFE
## Med students to receive new iPads 
### NICOLA PARK DAILY INTERN 
The School of Medicine has pur
chased nearly 100 iPads to distribute
to this fall's incoming class as soon
as it starts school this month.
According to Charles Prober, the
senior associate dean for medical
student education and professor of
pediatrics, microbiology and im
munology, the iPads will help the
medical students enjoy a more com
fortable and portable learning expe
rience.
"It's like a telephone book in
stead of memorizing all your con
tacts, you can easily refer to them
within a device," Prober said.
Students will receive instruction
on how to optimally use the iPads,

according to Prober, and course
work material previously distrib
uted to students in hard copies will
be loaded onto the iPad.

Recent admits were initially sur
prised by this development, accord
ing to Hong-An Nguyen 'lO, an in
coming medical student this fall.
"We were all very shocked," she
said. "We definitely weren't expect
ing this to happen, and we're gener
ally really excited about it."
The implementation originated
from discussions within the depart
ment and student suggestions.
Prober emphasized the device's
portability, and believes that its abil
ity to hold a large amount of infor
mation will improve students' quali
ty of education and life.
"Students can carry information

not only in their brains, but also with
them within the iPad," Prober said.
"When students get into clinical
experiences and have a vague recol
lection of something they heard dur
ing class, it will be easy for them to
go back and remind themselves
what that was, and [they] can recall
prior knowledge instead of going
home searching through their syl
labi," he added.
In addition, the transition is a
step toward being more environ
mentally friendly, moving from hard
copies to electronic ones.
"The number of pages that get
printed are astronomical, so we will
be able to save trees," Prober said.
Other advantages of the device
include electronic annotation de
vices, advanced computer imaging
and access to information gleaned
from external sites on the Internet.
"Because a lot of the medical
school teaching is becoming in
more of a digital format, having an
iPad will help facilitate it," Nguyen
said. "I think it's really exciting.
There might be some glitches here
and there, but we're all pretty ex

cited to use the iPad."
Prober also outlined some pos
sible detrimental effects of the
move.
"The potential con would be if
students are not skilled with tech
nological devices, and if they're
not familiar with computer usage
and other electronic devices, but I
can't imagine too many students
like that," Prober said. "It may be
less effective for students who
would prefer to do stuff with pencil
and paper in hand."
The School of Medicine is
nonetheless placing its faith in a
generation known for being famil

iar and comfortable with the elec
tronic medium.
"Many if not most of the current
student population are very com
fortable in using these modern in
formation technologies," he said.
Students will receive their iPads
during orientation from Aug. 18 to
Aug. 20. According to Prober, the
administration "will be evaluating
the experience with this incoming
class" and see if the school should
continue providing iPads to future
medical students.
