## Recent car thefts concern police Motorists advised to remove valuables from vehicles 
### DAVID BALLANTINE 
Nine car burglaries have oc
curred in Parking Structure 6 (PS6),
located beneath Wilbur Field, since
early June, including three break
ins that have occurred in the last
two weeks. The method of entry has
been smashing windows, and items
stolen were primarily GPS devices,
according to William Larson,
spokesperson for the Department
of Public Safety (DPS).
Because of the high frequency
and short time frame, the burglar
ies at PS6 are of special concern to
the police.
"At this time, it is unknown if
these burglaries are being commit
ted by one or even more perpetra
tors under a more coordinated ef
fort," Larson wrote in an e-mail to
The Daily.
To help mitigate the occurrence

of the break-ins, DPS has posted a
sign at the entrance of PS6, as well
as flyers on all levels to inform mo
torists of recommended precau
tions. The flyers advise those using
PS6 to remove all valuable items
from vehicles, including GPS units,
and to lock doors, roll up windows,
turn on alarm systems, be alert to
surroundings and report suspicious
activity immediately by calling 911
or using a blue emergency phone.
DPS also asked Student Hous
ing and building managers to send
out alerts for those who park in PS6
and elsewhere on campus.
According to Larson, deputies
regularly carry out patrol checks of
campus 24 hours a day, and they
have increased their monitoring of
PS6 in light of the recent crimes. In
addition, parking enforcement and
campus security keep an eye on the
parking structure.
"In that regard, we would like to
send the message that the public im
mediately call 911 if they observe
any suspicious persons or activities,
not only in the structure but all

areas of the campus," Larson said.
Located underground, PS6 is a
more attractive target for car
thieves, but it is well lit with white
walls and white ceilings. Observa
tion of the lot Monday evening
showed that more cars were parked
in the upper levels, with more
empty parking spaces descending
further down.

"Parking Structure 6 is a typical
underground structure which lends
itself to no visibility from surface traf
fic and activity," Larson said. "This is
why we advise motorists to take extra
precautions to reduce the potential
for theft and other crimes."
