## Dining commits to trayless program 
### CAITY MONROE STAFF WRITER 
The trayless dining program imple
mented at two dorms this past academ
ic year has made it to the summer
showing signs of promise, but uncer
tainty still lingers about the program's
feasibility and relative effectiveness.
Both Wilbur and Stern dining halls
have stopped making trays readily
available to diners, but students can
still ask for a tray if they want to use
one. While many students expressed
sympathy for the goals of the program
and its logic in the late months of the
academic year, the question of its rela
tive usefulness remains unanswered
for many students.
For its part, Dining remains fully
committed to the program, saying that
even though it has no hard data on its
effects, it believes the trayless initia
tive is significantly reducing water use.
Mary Lee, student manager at Stern
Dining, emphasized how much each
tray adds up in a dining hall as large as
Stern.
"We serve an average of three
meals per day, and each meal has
around 800 students," Lee said. "If 800
students use trays . . . that takes a
lot of water to wash them off."
"Approximately 30 percent of
the food produced for human con
sumption in the United States is
thrown out as waste," added Eric
Montell, executive director of Stan
ford Dining, in an e-mail to The
Daily. "In addition, trayless dining
conserves water and energy that
would be spent on cleaning trays."
Unfortunately, because neither
Wilbur nor Stern has individual
water meters, Montell was unable
to provide exact statistics on water
saved, though he did cite consider
able savings from similar programs
at other universities.
"We have heard from other uni
versities that a trayless program can
save as much as 1/3 of a gallon to
wash," he said.
Siddhartha Oza 'll, who was be
hind the implementation of the
trayless campaign, also said he is
happy with the program so far.
"Although I can't speak to any
actual statistics, the trayless initia
tive appears to be running very
well," he said.
Montell also said that the tray
less program fit with the broader
environmental values that have
motivated the "Love Food, Hate
Waste" campaign in the dining
halls.
During the school year, the pres
ence of trays in the Wilbur and
Stern dining areas diminished, al
though they did not disappear en
tirely, as students begin to respond
to efforts discouraging the use of
trays.
"I don't need one," said Bailey
Farrell 'l3. "And at the beginning
of the year, I read somewhere that
each tray takes something like half
a gallon of water to wash each time.
It also makes me waste less food be
cause I don't take as much food."
Farrell was one of five freshmen
sitting at her table in Wilbur dining
in late May, and all five agreed that
the tray was unnecessary given the
amount of food and number of
plates they usually brought back to
the table.
Tatum Sohlberg 'l3 said that the
efforts to promote more environ
mentally friendly dining habits
have played a role in her choice to
"go trayless."
"I don't want to be wasteful un
necessarily," Sohlberg said.
Yet the trayless campaign only
discourages rather than pro
hibits tray usage, and many stu
dents still choose to request one.
This exception has ensured that the
black plastic trays have maintained
a noticeable, yet diminished pres
ence in the dining halls. And while
some students find them unneces
sary, others claim the tray helps jug
gle otherwise cumbersome multi
plate meals.
"I think it's a compelling reason,
I just don't think it's always feasi
ble," said Anne Warner 'l2.
That feasibility has been further
challenged this summer, with a host
of non-Stanford students flooding
into the dining halls. The tenuous
balance between convenience and
conservation seems to have tipped
toward the former for the summer

months, as diners can now find trays
available without requesting
them at some meals at Stern.
"As we have several non-Stan
ford conferences and many interna
tional students this year a differ
ent demographic from that during
the academic year the demand
for trays has been quite high," Mon
tell said. "In the interest of provid
ing great customer service in pre
venting a backup at the cashier, we
have placed trays in the dining hall
for some meals."
Many of these students bring
with them different perspectives on
this particular method of sustain
ability, as well as differences in en
vironmental efforts as a whole.
"Here, you divide between land
fill and compost," said visiting stu
dent Santiago Velasco. "Back in
Mexico we don't do that. The cam
paign about going trayless is really
useful."
"But," he said as he motioned to
the trays on surrounding tables,
"not everyone does it."
Andres Akle, also from Mexico,
was also supportive of the trayless
program, though he pointed out
that food waste is not as much of a
problem at his school back home.
"In my school, we do have trays,
we do use them, but the portions
are not American portions," he
said. "They're much smaller . . .
and you're only served once."
Other students were less enthu
siastic about the trayless campaign
and more skeptical about its effec
tiveness given other less-environ
mentally friendly habits found
around campus and the country.
"I think it's ridiculous because
here you are, making people feel
guilty because you're using trays . .
. and at the same time every night at
midnight you've got water spraying
everywhere on the lawn," said
Julien Nakache, who is visiting
from France.
"And buses go every one minute
with no one on them," he added.
Over time, however, the mixed
range of impressions at the novelty
of trayless dining may become a
more familiar part of campus life, as
Stern Dining Ambassador Alex Li
'l3 hopes. He said that the effec
tiveness of the trayless campaign
would likely grow as new students
come in and older students start to
adapt.
"Freshmen who came in didn't
know that there were trays, so they
don't say anything .. . but it's the
upperclassmen when they come
who always wonder, 'Where are the
trays?"'
