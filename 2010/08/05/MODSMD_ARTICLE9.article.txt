## Economy links Palo Alto, Univ. Relationship with city sends money in both directions 
### KEVIN ZHANG DAILY INTERN 
There is no doubt that Palo Alto
is rich, or as Palo Alto teens might
say, hella rich. The city was ranked
third by CNNMoney.com in a re
port published last month of the
top-earning cities in the United
States. With a population of slight
ly more than 60,000, the median
family annual income is more than
$153,000 and the median home
price is a whopping $l.lB million,
according to the same report.
The affluence of Stanford's
next-neighbor highlights the ways,
both major and minor, in which the
University maintains economic ties
to surrounding cities and the region
as a whole. Along with providing
students career and housing op
tions, Stanford's relationship to its
surroundings rests in many ways on
numbers local gifts to the Uni
versity, employment and spending
by Stanford.
Take gifts, for example. Stan
ford receives some gifts and be
quests funds that are not ex
pendable in the current year and
not counted into the income
from the community. In 2006, $22
million in gifts and bequests came
from Palo Alto, of $869 million
total, according to an economic im
pact study published in 2008.
Students, for their part, send a

large total back into the city, with a
third of their $156 million spending
in 2006 going to Palo Alto, accord
ing to the same report. Yet many
students encounter high prices,
both for shopping and housing,
when venturing off-campus.
"With the affluence in Palo
Alto, students are much more insu
lar," said Abra Jeffers, a doctoral
student in management science and
engineering. "There is little inter
action between Palo Alto citizens
and students. When there is inter
action, it is usually regarding busi
ness."
Graduate students seeking
housing off-campus especially en
counter this reality.
"Palo Alto's high property val
ues mean that rental costs are high
as well," said Jean McCown, Stan
ford's director of community rela
tions. "This means that Stanford
graduate students who might wish
to rent off-campus will definitely
encounter higher rental costs than
in some other nearby communi
ties."
In total, Stanford and its stu
dents, visitors and employees
spend locally by the billions, not
just in apartment rent. Through
SLAC National Accelerator Labo
ratory, Lucile Packard Children's
Hospital and Stanford Hospital &
Clinics, $2.1 billion in local expen
ditures went to Santa Clara and San
Mateo Counties in 2006 according
to the study, compared to $1.6 bil
lion heading outside of those two
counties. ($1.2 billion came from

spending by employees, visitors,
students and other entities on Stan
ford lands.)
Palo Alto alone was on the re
ceiving end of $621 million of direct
Stanford expenditures.
Stanford also provides a hiring
engine for the region: in 2006, Stan
ford was the largest employer in the
Silicon Valley, employing more
than 20,000 people that year, 4,000
more than the second-largest Sili
con Valley employer, Cisco Sys
tems, Inc.
Some say the area returns the
favor, boasting highly educated res
idents and attractive job options. In
a recently published study by the
Brookings Institute ranking metro
politan areas on educational attain
ment, the San Jose-Sunnyvale-
Santa Clara area, which includes
Palo Alto, was ranked third in the
nation, with 43.8 percent of its
adults age 25 and older having a
bachelor's degree.
That could be part of the appeal
for some job-seeking students.
"The high educational attain
ment draws more intelligence and it
is self-attracting," Jeffers said. "For
me, I came to Stanford University
because I knew that I would be able
to interact with all kinds of intelli
gent people on campus. On other
campuses, I would be a lot more in
dependent and wouldn't have the
same resources around me."
"With the high affluence or Palo
Alto and the Silicon Valley in gen

eral, we definitely are surrounded by
a pretty exciting job market," added
Lance Choy, director of Stanford's
Career Development Center.
"Local employers like local stu
dents. We definitely have opportu
nities that aren't present on other
campuses."
