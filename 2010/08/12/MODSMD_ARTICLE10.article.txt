Many non-Western cultures practice
some form of sand "painting." The
paintings can take hours to make and
can be large, intricate and beautiful. In
Tibetan society, the practice is mostly reserved
for monks, who ritualistically destroy paintings
upon their completion. But in India, where the
practice is known as rangoli (note: the
Wikipedia page is sub-par), many ordinary
people engage in it daily. I've seen whole
albums' worth of travel photos of decorated
doorsteps.
Western art isn't completely devoid of tran
sitory or temporary media. But artists have
been known to spend days on end wrapped in
felt, fur and lard, locked in a room with a coy
ote. And monks are supposed to be capable of
sitting still so long their appendages fall off.
These are people whose actions are strongly
tied to a message. These are people to whom
others will possibly pay attention. But ordi
nary folk? Housewives?
I used to think the American spirit must be
severely deficient in the ability to sand paint. I

could find no widespread devotion to some
thing so small-reaching, short-lived and mate
rially fruitless. Most people I know wouldn't
touch art of any kind with a ten-foot pole.
Ordinary Americans, if they create at all, build
gazebos, advertise their blog or post videos of
their amateur rap on You Tube, They try to
make a mark on their environment. And they
work in what they consider to be relatively
lasting media. Nobody expects digital files or
architectural structures to just disappear. The
modern Ozymandias is on MySpace. Even
gamers, probably the American demographic
with the shortest attention span (which is say
ing something), tend to prefer playing online,
where their accomplishments can be wit
nessed, their statistics recorded and broadcast.
Then I remembered food: bread that takes
an hour to knead and has to rise overnight.
Salmon in a piccata sauce. Apple goddamned
pie. The medium of every American house
wife, and others. I might go through an entire
day without singing a note, writing a word,
sketching a line, without listening or looking

or smelling the roses because, my God, there
just isn't time for it!
But I've got to eat.
Breakfast, even when I roll out of bed half
an hour late and have to scramble to work, is a
fried egg on toast with homemade plum pre
serves. Every time I put in the hour to fry the
onions and cumin seeds, cook the vegetables,
boil the lentils and spice the soup, only to sit
somewhere quiet and eat it the moment it's
barely cool enough, I am sand painting and
destroying. This is the only American medium
whose appreciation requires its destruction.
And even in an era of individually wrapped,
pre-made microwave meals, with the foodie
fad comes a whole new generation defending
the art.
Sure, on one level, food culture is just
another form of conspicuous consumption in

the pursuit of authenticity. But it is consump
tion without clutter. You're not watching, col
lecting, analyzing. You're eating. Recipes
might be handed down cast iron pans, too
but the food itself is in the moment, best
right out of the oven. Not to be kept for pos
terity. Like igniting a fleet of gasoline-soaked
paper boats in a kiddie pool with a WD-40-can
blowtorch.
You can take a picture of your plate of
penne puttanesca, but good luck photograph
ing its fire.
