## Maybe You Should Repair Your Soles First 
### Peter McDonald 
If there is one thing that exasperates me
more than self-righteous old people, it's
psych studies that claim to justify said self
righteousness. The latest offending work
comes from the University of Michigan. It
finds that college students these days "are not
as empathetic as college students of the 1980s
and '9os." That's right, fellow Millennials:
even though "Walk Two Moons" was on
every elementary school reading list, and
lessons in conflict resolution were mandatory
in seventh-grade social studies, we don't care
about anyone else. Researchers blame
Facebook, violent video games and reality
shows for this phenomenon, since skate
boarding, that damn hippity-hop and reefers
were already taken.
First of all, let me just say, as a self-respect
ing Ohioan, that Michigan sucks.
Furthermore, I can't understand how any
researcher can worry about this generation's
apathy when the crotchetiest old man of
"Watchmen," Rorschach, was complaining
about the bystander effect in 1986. Then again,
poking holes in psych studies is like calling out
white liberals for showing their privilege: it's
just too easy. And if I'm gonna be real, I have
a few unnerving stories myself that support
this study.
Take, for example, the saga of my best
friend from high school (let's call him Frank)
and his roommate, Bob. I always considered
Frank a compassionate guy. Bob somehow
determined erroneously that Frank was sleep
ing with his girlfriend and accused Frank sev

eral times of doing so, each time with more
conviction. Eventually he became so sure that
this cuckoldry was taking place that he broke
into Frank's room searching for evidence,
destroyed some electronics, then told Frank
via text message that he had done so. Frank
was justifiably enraged and promptly moved
out. Yet only four hours after the incriminat
ing text, Bob sent a follow-up text apologizing
for his behavior and confessing that he had
been diagnosed with schizophrenia and
depression. Bob is currently living alone with
his schizophrenic self, but when asked about
Bob's well-being, Frank said that he didn't
know or care about his status, even though
this guy clearly needs help.
Another friend recently lost multiple rela
tives and has been spending most of his days in
a cannabis-induced haze, even though he's one
of the more driven people I know. It wasn't
until I was on the flight back out here that I
even thought to put two and two together,
much less ask if he was all right.
And what about at perfect oF Stanford?
Even though the duck syndrome is well docu
mented, none of my best friends ever asked
me about my mental health unless I desper
ately broached the subject first. I am equally
guilty.
That said, like privilege-showing liberals, I
just can't lay off. I have serious issues with this
study and its blind broadcast throughout the
news media. Because honestly, Michigan,
aren't these traits of apathy and solipsism
more just typical post-adolescence than they

are anything generational? I mean,
researchers' statements, such as, "Many peo
ple see the current group of college students
sometimes called 'Generation Me' —as
one of the most self-centered, narcissistic,
competitive, confident and individualistic in
recent history," are empty and unverifiable,
and only serve to reinforce existing kids
these-days mentalities. Researchers: maybe
you should check your own textbooks about a
little confirmation bias. What's more, don't
you think that maybe a generation raised on
marriage counseling and introspection might
be more up front about their narcissistic ten
dencies instead of hiding behind the socially
desirable veil of altruism?
All I know is that I would take care before
asserting that everyone within two years of my
age cares only about themselves, but then
again, you probably assumed that we were all
too busy tweeting and replicating "Jersey
Shore" to read the news.

With regard to possible causes for this so
called apathy, let me just say that my afore
mentioned best friend rarely used Facebook,
chose "Madden" as his favorite game and
never watched reality TV. These things rank
among the most-abused bugaboos by intellec
tuals nationwide for explaining negative
trends. And by the way, are we not the most
socially active and tolerant generation the
generation that elected Obama "in recent
history," as you care to phrase it? Michigan, if
this study is how you feel about your student
body, then I don't want to know what your

convocation speech sounds like. Though per
haps I shouldn't be surprised. After all,
Michigan sucks.

It's been a great run. Please send any hate mail
languishing in your drafts folder to petermc@
