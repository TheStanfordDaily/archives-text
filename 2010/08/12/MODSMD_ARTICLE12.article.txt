## DIVIDE M CONFERENCE The
						future of the Pac-12 
### JACOB JAFFE SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
After the confusion of June's conference ex
pansion bonanza, the Pac-10 will now officially
become the Pac-12 when Colorado and Utah
join the league, which is expected to be in 2011.
This much is known. What remains to be seen is
how this new conference will function, particu
larly with respect to the most popular and lucra
tive college sport football.
Among the 11 current FBS conferences, five
of them the ACC, Big 12, Conference USA,
MAC and SEC have at least 12 teams. Per
NCAA guidelines, all five of these conferences
have been split up into two divisions, allowing
these conferences to hold a conference champi
onship game. When the Pac-12 and Big Ten join
this list (while the Big 12 leaves it), both will also
split into two divisions. Like nearly everything
surrounding conference realignment, this move
is rooted in monetary interests, because a con
ference championship game is estimated to
bring the conference around $lO million in rev
enue.
The issue is now how to split the conference
into its two divisions. Pac-10 athletic directors
have met in the past few days to discuss possible
solutions, but a final decision is not expected
until October. For now, any proposed divisions
are merely speculation, although several ideas
have been championed by different coaches
and media members.
Four of the five aforementioned conferences
are split geographically into either North and
South Divisions or East and West Divisions,
with only the ACC's Atlantic and Coastal Divi
sions representing a non-geographical split. An
east-west split would not work in the coastally
dominated Pac-12, but a north-south split seems
at first glance seems feasible although it is
not without its issues.
One problem with a north-south split is
where to draw the dividing line. The Washing
ton schools and the Oregon schools would
clearly be in the North Division, while the Ari
zona schools and the Los Angeles schools
would be in the South Division. The Bay Area
schools could conceivably play in either divi
sion, leaving the two new members to fill in the
remaining slots.
However, either choice of split would leave
six teams in a North Division, and by all indica
tions no team wants to be part of a North Divi
sion. The northern schools would not get to play
UCLA or USC every year, so they would only
travel to Los Angeles every few years, while
South Division teams would go there every sea
son. The Los Angeles area is the most impor
tant recruiting region for all the teams in the
Pac-12, so exposure there is crucial for building
a successful program.
Numerous coaches have spoken out against

a divisional split that would isolate northern
schools from the benefits of playing in southern
California, so Pac-12 officials are looking at
other options.
The most popular alternative being consid
ered is the "zipper" format, named because the
split would bisect the pairs of schools like a zip
per. This would give both divisions equal expo
sure because each division would have one of
the new schools and a team each from Wash
ington, Oregon, the Bay Area, Los Angeles and
Arizona.
While this strategy solves one problem, it
creates more. The most pressing is that long
time rivals would be split into different divi
sions. The schools would never agree to forgo
the rivalry games, so they would be forced to
add the game as an annual non-divisional game.
While being fairly simple for scheduling pur
poses, this could lead to a rivalry game being re
peated a week later in the conference champi
onship game which could lessen the champi
onship game, though Stanford Athletic Direc
tor Bob Bowlsby has downplayed the issue.
Schools might instead move the rivalry game to
earlier in the year, which in turn might down
play its significance.
Another potential issue with the zipper is fig
uring out how to split the teams. There are many

more possible combinations for making the two
divisions in a zipper format, and any choice is
completely arbitrary. Therefore, the Pac-12
would have to be very careful to make the divi
sions relatively equal talent-wise in order to
avoid stacking one division at the expense of the
other.
Both scenarios have flaws, and not everyone
will be content with the outcome. For instance,
Stanford has played Cal, USC and UCLA every
year since 1936 (other than during World War
II), but few scenarios would allow that tradition
to continue. Problems like this have made hy
brid divisions (splitting up some rivals while
keeping the rest geographical) a third idea, but
those create as many dilemmas as they solve.
Stanford will likely end up playing some, but
not all, of its current rivals in the new Pac-12,
and while Big Game with Cal will undoubtedly
continue, it could lose some of its flair when di
visional supremacy comes to the fore.

The Pac-12's final decision, however, like the
conference realignment that has made deliber
ations necessary, will in all probability come
down to money.
A major component of the revenue for col
lege football comes from television contracts,
and the Pac-12 will have to negotiate a new con
tract before the 2012 season. This contract will
be vital for the conference because a lucrative
contract means more exposure as well as more
revenue for its member programs.
The Pac-10 currently has contracts with
ESPN and Fox Sports Net totaling $44.4 million
per year. This puts the conference at a signifi
cant disadvantage compared to the other major
conferences. The Big Ten is due over $2OO mil
lion per year through 2016, the SEC will receive
over $2OO million per year through 2023, the
ACC is signed for over $l5O million per year
through 2022 and even the almost-collapsed Big
12 is set to make at least $6O million per year
through 2015.
This deficit has spurred new Pac-10 Com
missioner Larry Scott into furious action.
Along with the additions of Colorado and
Utah, Scott has worked to increase nationwide
exposure of the Pac-10. Fie sent Pac-10 coaches
and players to New York for a highly publicized
press conference in Times Square and a tour of
ESPN before heading back to the Rose Bowl.
Scott even unveiled a new Pac-10 logo and web
site.

All the press is aimed at making the Pac-10 a
presence around the country, which Scott hopes
will lead to a better television contract. The Pac
-10 hopes to at least match the ACC, which more
than doubled its previous contract with ESPN
just last month.
A more profitable television contract would
mean more money for all the schools in the con
ference, and athletic departments rely on foot
ball to pay for many of their other sports. Unlike
most conferences, however, the Pac-10 does not
split its television money equally. Instead, the
teams that play on television receive 55 percent
of the money, making televised games even
more important for each school.
For Stanford, an improved television con
tract, more conference exposure and a football
program on the rise could coincide to bring Car
dinal football to the next level. Until then, the
television contract and the future of the Pac-12
remain unclear.

Stanford's Andrew Luck waits for the snap at Big Game 2009, which Stanford lost 34-28 to its rival
Cal. Among the potential complications of the "zipper plan" for dividing the Pac-12 is
separating traditional rivals, whose matches are presently part of the annual conference schedule.
