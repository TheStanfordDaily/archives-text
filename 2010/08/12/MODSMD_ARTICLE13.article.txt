# Dear spurned SF sports fans: place hope on Giants
## 
### JOSEPH BEYDA 
If you're a San Francisco sports fan having wait
ed since 2003 to see a professional team make it
to the playoffs, you may be in for a Giant sur
prise this fall.
After a 20-8 month of July, the Giants are in the
midst of close division and wild card races with a chance
of reaching the playoffs for the first time in seven years.
Though making the playoffs is far from certain
San Francisco remains one game behind division leader
San Diego and is tied for the wild card lead the Gi
ants have a better shot at playing in October than the
49ers do in January. The Orange and Black's depth,
though often criticized, is not too shabby, despite a
range of challenges: last year's hitting core has for the
most part been traded away, fan-favorite Pablo San
doval has experienced a 70-point drop in batting aver
age down to .264, and the starting rotation has become
much less dominant. Even with that, the streaky Giants
are still in the mix late in the season.
San Francisco's success is thanks to the contribu
tions of 3-4-5 hitters Aubrey Huff, Buster Posey and
Pat Burrell, additions this year that are all hitting better
than .280. The team's spectacular July was sparked per
haps most of all by Posey, who went .417 in the month
and had hits in 21 consecutive games.
As Posey has cooled off somewhat since the end of
his hitting streak, gracing us mere mortals with his pres
ence by hitting under .400, the question becomes: Can
the Giants hold on to their slim wild card lead, or have
they peaked too early?
Indications are that San Francisco has a good shot at
making the playoffs. Despite strong wild card competi
tion from Cincinnati, St. Louis and Philadelphia, the
Giants have solid hitters lying dormant in Sandoval,
Aaron Rowand, Freddy Sanchez, Juan Uribe and
Edgar Renteria. If a couple of those players can get hot,
San Francisco's lineup will be strong enough to carry it
into the postseason.
Easing first-half woes by filling some gaps in the
bullpen, the Giants acquired relievers Javier Lopez and
Ramon Ramirez at the trade deadline, making their
playoff stock much stronger. On Wednesday, infielder
Mike Fontenot joined San Francisco, building a deep
lineup with room for injuries (such as Renteria's cur
rent bicep strain). And with a strong coaching staff, ex
emplified when manager Bruce Bochy bought the team
a game after noticing a tiny ninth-inning gaffe by
Dodgers hitting coach Don Mattingly on July 20, the
Giants might have what it takes to make it further into
the playoffs than expected.
Regardless of how long a 2010 playoff run would last
(if it happens at all), it would surely be a welcome ex
perience for fans, who have seen just one team make it
past the first series since 1989. That 2002 World Series
appearance came to a disappointing end after the Gi
ants tossed away the championship with an eighth-in
ning error in Game Six, and San Francisco's playoff run
the following season was cut short in the first series.
Fans have been waiting seven years for the Giants to
get that far again. The San Francisco faithful already
seem to appreciate the strides that the Giants have
made, as home attendance is up nearly 2,000 per game
this year. It's harder to find tickets nowadays, but that's
just the way it should be to watch the exciting team that
the Giants have become.
Though success by the 49ers whose last playoff
appearance also came in 2003 would also be wel
comed, opportunity in 2010 will be knocking on the
gates of AT&T Park, not Candlestick.
And San Francisco needs the Giants to answer that
knock.

Even as the winter sports approach, Joseph Bey da and the
Giants are keeping baseball on the brain. Debate potential
September call-ups with him at josephbeyda@comcast.
