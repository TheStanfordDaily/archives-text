# Sports camps invade campus
## 
### DANNY RUBIN DAILY INTERN 
"Great!" "Really, really good." "I like
everything about it."
Such was the praise Stanford's All-
Sports Camp won this week its eighth
and final of the summer from a handful
of its 6- to 12-year-old campers.
"I really like it," said a 9-year-old girl
from San Jose who has come to camp for
several years. "We get to play games and do
stuff like rock climbing and gymnastics."
If you've been around campus this sum
mer, odds are you've seen the camp in ac
tion. But what exactly have the kids been
up to?
The better question is where, said Pam
Mahlow, camp director. The tiny athletes
have roamed from the climbing wall to
Manzanita Field, from Roble Field to the

west campus tennis courts, Mahlow said.
Traditional sports are a big component
of the camp. Counselors teach a variety of
sports, including baseball, basketball, vol
leyball, soccer, tennis, track and field,
wrestling and gymnastics. On top of this,
they also squeezes in rock climbing, slip-n
-slide and, of course, Doctor and Spy, a
unique variant of dodge ball that is the
camp's most popular activity.
Counselors are the key to the the camp's
success, organizers say.
"Pretty much, our main job is to play
with the kids, making sure they are having
fun and staying safe," said Emily Brown, a
second-year counselor and local high
school student. "It's awesome to be able to
hang out and play summer games as part of
your job."
"We do a little skill training, but mostly,
we just let them have fun," said Alyssa

Brown 'l2, a counselor and Stanford gym
nast. "If they want to learn more, they come
to us."
Dan Hernandez, head counselor, says
counseling is a sought-after job. He said
about half of this year's 23 counselors are
Stanford athletes.
"It's very difficult to become a counselor
here," said Emily. "It's a summer job that
everyone wants, and being a Stanford
camp, we have the opportunity to hire the
best of the best."
But it pays off, said Alyssa.
"It's a great way for us Stanford athletes
to give back during the summer. And it's
great for the kids too," Alyssa said. "I have
been athletic my whole life, and it's fun to
show them what I can do."

Stanford's All-Sports Camps provide local children with an opportunity for low-key, healthy fun and exposure to various activities. In one
session earlier this week, a group of campers, above, play a game of "Medic," a fusion of dodgeball and freezetag that rewards agility.
"Great!" "Really, really good." "I like
everything about it."
