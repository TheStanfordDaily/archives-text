## Cardinal cracks top 25 in SI Preview 
### â€” Joseph Beyda 
Stanford was ranked 24th in Sports ll
lustrated's college football preview, re
leased Wednesday.
The Cardinal's offense will be powered
this year by redshirt sophomore quarter
back Andrew Luck, who will take the place
of Minnesota Vikings draftee Toby Ger

hart as the offense's focus. Luck threw for
2,575 yards and 13 touchdowns with only
four interceptions during the 2009 season,
helping the team to an 8-5 record.
Also returning are strong receivers in
Ryan Whalen and Chris Owusu, along with
a rushing trifecta in Stepfan Taylor, Jeremy
Stewart and Tyler Gaffney. A maturing
secondary will help prevent defensive gaps
that led to 3,024 pass yards against last sea
son, one of the worst in the Football Bowl

Subdivision.
