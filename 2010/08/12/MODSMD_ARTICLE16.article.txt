## Meet the Stanford Summer Chorus Summer shines in song 
### NICOLA PARK DAILY INTERN 
Hanging from the high ceiling, the chandeliers
cast a dim light onto the packed Memorial
Church Friday evening. As I climbed to the
upper levels of the church, white program in my
hand, my attention was drawn to the illuminat
ed stage, where the black-clad Stanford Summer Chorus and
Junge Kammerphilharmonie Freiburg, a semi-professional
orchestra from Freiburg, Germany, stood poised.
The air was expectant.
But then with a flick of conductor Andreas Winnen's
hand, a soft minor note rang through the church. Slowly it
swelled and transitioned into an ethereal melody as the voic
es broke off from each other, creating a perfect harmony.
The Stanford Summer Chorus, directed by Amy Stuart
Hunn B.A. '95 M.A. 'OO, and the Junge
Kammerphilharmonie Freiburg, collaborated this summer to
produce two performances: Giuseppe Verdi's "Messa da

Requiem" on Friday, Aug. 6 and Beethoven's masterpiece,
"Symphony No. 9 in D minor, Op. 125, 'Choral'" on Saturday,
Aug. 7.
I attended the ensemble's rendering of Verdi's
"Requiem," which was dedicated to "loved ones lost in 2010,"
according to the performance program. Although Latin and I
met and parted in my sixth grade language class, I've always
thought of the language as beautiful and noble. Blearing the
words from the chorus was soothing, as they floated gently
away from the singers' vocal cords, each syllable carefully
pronounced.
After the first song ended, I was scribbling on my notepad
when the next song started with a "BANG!" and I nearly
jumped in my seat. Throughout the next movement I could
feel the drum vibrations reach my bench, even on the church's
second level. The performance ebbed and flowed between
loud, powerful and dynamic measures to gentle, fragile and
graceful ones, for a delightful variety. The seventh and last
movement, "Libera Me" closed the performance solemnly
and gracefully.
I especially admired the quartet at the forefront: the

sonorous bass Adam Lau, the dynamic tenor J. Raymond
Meyers, the sweet vibrato of alto Lisa Van der Ploeg and the
high-reaching yet graceful soprano Mary Linduska.
Their performance earned a deserved standing ovation,
one that was nearly three minutes long.
First-time summer chorus member and high school stu
dent Andjelija Janicijevic was impressed with the perfor
mance as well.
"It exceeded anything that I expected; it was powerful and
I didn't expect [the church] to be so full," she said. "It was
incredible, I never experienced anything like it."
"I take choir back home and I love choir and I sing," said
the high school junior from Belgrade, Serbia. But she saw the
Summer Chorus as a refreshing change from what she was
familiar with.
"Our school choir songs are not very advanced, but here
we sing some of the most amazing, the most beautiful, pieces
of all time," she said. "The German orchestra was so amazing.
Even outside rehearsals I saw them everywhere. They were
