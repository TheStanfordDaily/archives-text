## Meet the Stanford Summer Chorus Summer shines in song 
### NICOLA PARK DAILY INTERN 
Hanging from the high ceiling, the chandeliers
cast a dim light onto the packed Memorial
Church Friday evening. As I climbed to the
upper levels of the church, white program in my
hand, my attention was drawn to the illuminat
ed stage, where the black-clad Stanford Summer Chorus and
Junge Kammerphilharmonie Freiburg, a semi-professional
orchestra from Freiburg, Germany, stood poised.
The air was expectant.
But then with a flick of conductor Andreas Winnen's
hand, a soft minor note rang through the church. Slowly it
swelled and transitioned into an ethereal melody as the voic
es broke off from each other, creating a perfect harmony.
The Stanford Summer Chorus, directed by Amy Stuart
Hunn B.A. '95 M.A. 'OO, and the Junge
Kammerphilharmonie Freiburg, collaborated this summer to
produce two performances: Giuseppe Verdi's "Messa da

Requiem" on Friday, Aug. 6 and Beethoven's masterpiece,
"Symphony No. 9 in D minor, Op. 125, 'Choral'" on Saturday,
Aug. 7.
I attended the ensemble's rendering of Verdi's
"Requiem," which was dedicated to "loved ones lost in 2010,"
according to the performance program. Although Latin and I
met and parted in my sixth grade language class, I've always
thought of the language as beautiful and noble. Blearing the
words from the chorus was soothing, as they floated gently
away from the singers' vocal cords, each syllable carefully
pronounced.
After the first song ended, I was scribbling on my notepad
when the next song started with a "BANG!" and I nearly
jumped in my seat. Throughout the next movement I could
feel the drum vibrations reach my bench, even on the church's
second level. The performance ebbed and flowed between
loud, powerful and dynamic measures to gentle, fragile and
graceful ones, for a delightful variety. The seventh and last
movement, "Libera Me" closed the performance solemnly
and gracefully.
I especially admired the quartet at the forefront: the

sonorous bass Adam Lau, the dynamic tenor J. Raymond
Meyers, the sweet vibrato of alto Lisa Van der Ploeg and the
high-reaching yet graceful soprano Mary Linduska.
Their performance earned a deserved standing ovation,
one that was nearly three minutes long.
First-time summer chorus member and high school stu
dent Andjelija Janicijevic was impressed with the perfor
mance as well.
"It exceeded anything that I expected; it was powerful and
I didn't expect [the church] to be so full," she said. "It was
incredible, I never experienced anything like it."
"I take choir back home and I love choir and I sing," said
the high school junior from Belgrade, Serbia. But she saw the
Summer Chorus as a refreshing change from what she was
familiar with.
"Our school choir songs are not very advanced, but here
we sing some of the most amazing, the most beautiful, pieces
of all time," she said. "The German orchestra was so amazing.
Even outside rehearsals I saw them everywhere. They were

such a positive influence on cam
pus."
Many of the singers, like scientif
ic programmer at SLAC and alto
Joanne Bogart, have been partici
pating in the choir for years.
Bogart's first performance with the
summer chorus was about a decade
ago, and she has participated in it
for the majority of the past decade,
including this summer. She also has
been a member of the year-round
Stanford Symphonic Chorus for
over 20 years.
"Singing choral music is quite a
wonderful experience," she said.
"There's the sense of community
and building something beautiful
together which you can't possibly do
independently. Everybody's impor
tant."
The participants in the chorus are
Stanford faculty, staff and students,
of varying ages and singing abilities.
The chorus is non-auditioned and
sponsored by Stanford's music
department.
This non-auditioned aspect of
the chorus appealed to Carol
Charlton, a Stanford Hospital Life
Science research assistant.
"I had never even heard the
Verdi before, although I've heard
Beethoven," she said. "It seems like
a tremendous amount to learn in
eight weeks. We're a lot of people
and 50 percent of the people knew
about the pieces before. It was a lot
of work, but at the end of the day,
when I started to learn the songs, it
became more fun."
The members praised Hunn and
Winnen, the two directors.

"Amy [Hunn] was sweet and
amazing and she considered all age
groups," Janicijevic said. "There
were people who were younger and
people who were decades older, so
she knew that some people are not
as advanced as others."
"[Winnen is] a very fine conduc
tor and was a joy to follow," Bogart
added.
The chorus met weekly through
out the summer, with rehearsals two
and a half hours long, turning to
daily practices as the performance
dates approached.
"When we first started rehears
ing, it was a bit rocky. It was a lot of
music to learn in a short time,"
Bogart said. "By the time we got to
the dress rehearsals I knew that
these were going to be very fine per
formances."
For Bogart, the rehearsals were a
refreshing change from her day-to
day life.
"It's the kind of experience dif
ferent than what I do in my working
life, so it creates a nice balance," she
said.
The choir became more than just
a hobby for Charlton.
"I didn't feel confident a week
before the performance, then I sat
down and practiced for half a day,"
she recounted. "It really started
coming then by the time I did
decide to perform it, it just became
really part of me. I'm still singing
those songs."
And for the young Janicijevic,
the Stanford Summer Chorus may
be more of a draw than the
University's famed academics.
"I told [Hunn] that if I come back
next summer, it'll only be because of
the choir," Janicijevic said.
