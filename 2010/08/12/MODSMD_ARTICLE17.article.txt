# Tracing the nuances of learning vocabulary
## Are children colorblind or color confused? 
### DANIEL RUBIN DAILY INTERN 
A series of color swatches
are laid in front of you
each swatch a differ
ent color. A researcher
asks you which one is
red, and you pick the one you
believe is red. You then repeat the
name game for every color present.
This was the initial test adminis
tered by psychology Prof. Michael
Ramscar and his staff to 34 subjects
in his study on how children learn
color words. Sounds easy, right? Not
quite. While the test would have
been easy for anyone with even a
basic knowledge of color, the vast
majority of the kids failed.
"Is my child colorblind?" worried
the concerned parents.
Not necessarily, said Ramscar.
He attributed the high percentage of
failures to the quirkiness of the
English language, not the subjects'
personal ability to distinguish colors.
His hypothesis, published last
month in Scientific American, was
that English-speaking children do
not learn color words as well as chil
dren who speak other languages
because in English, color identifiers
are said before the noun.
Ramscar's hypothesis was based
upon a unique view on how lan
guage works.
"Basically, you're predicting
what I'm going to say as I'm speak
ing," he said. "In the gap between
what you're expecting and what I'm
actually saying, you are predicting

the probability of what I'm going to
say based on signals I give you."
But why does this make learning
colors so difficult? According to
research assistant Melody Dye 'O7,
children still learning colors in any
language may have difficulty isolat
ing which hue is being indicated by
specific color words.
In most languages, this is not as
prominent a problem because nouns
are generally said first. For example,
in Spanish, if you wanted to refer to
a blue chair, you would say "la silla
azul." When directly translating to
English, "silla" means chair, while
"azul" means blue. The color comes
after the noun, meaning that a child
learning colors will fix his attention
on the noun and will thus be able to
see how the color word describes the
hue of the object.
Unfortunately for English speak
ers, English is relatively unique in
the fact that the noun is said after
the adjective.
"There is a 70-30 probability that
we would say 'the red ball' rather
than something like 'the ball that's
red,"' Dye said. "[The more com
mon phrasing] is really informative
if you know colors, but if you don't
know what red is, then you get no
signal from the word."
This phenomenon is also why it is
difficult for a child to learn quantity
and size words, Ramscar said.
However, Ramscar explained that
those three types of adjectives
color, quantity and size are the
only ones where this problem
occurs.
"Kids have no problem learning

most adjectives, such as 'wet' and
'broken,'" he said. "If you look at
statistics, we are more likely to say
'the chair is broken' or 'the dog is
wet.' You wouldn't say 'the broken
chair' until you have both estab
lished that the chair is broken."
Ramscar tested his theory by giv
ing all the children from the original
color test a crash course in color
training. For one group, the training
was done as conventional English
dictates: "the yellow house." For the
other group, the noun went before
the adjective: "the house that's yel
low." After this, the children admin
istered the swatch test again. The
results matched the hypothesis; the
first group barely improved, while
the second group improved signifi
cantly.
The findings point toward poten
tial alternatives to early language
education.
"One reaction we often got from
parents is 'Flow should we train our
kids? Should we put them in cram
mers [cram school]?"' Ramscar
said.
"But it isn't really about that," he
added. "To train more efficiently,
just think about how you talk to
kids. You could say 'the red ball,'
but you will get much better results
if you say 'the ball that's red."'
For many children, this minor
vocabulary switch could mean the
difference between passing and fail
ing a test crucial to diagnosing color
blindness.
