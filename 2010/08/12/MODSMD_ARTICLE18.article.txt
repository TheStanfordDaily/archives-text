■M . ing, infectious music and instant
personal connections, this past summer has
been relatively tumultuous and macabre for
the rave scene across the globe. Over
Memorial Day weekend at ETD POP, the
rave held at the local Cow Palace, three con
certgoers died from apparent ecstasy over
doses, while a month later at the much larg
er Electric Daisy Carnival in Los Angeles,
an underage girl also died from too much of
the popular rave drug. This caused city and
state officials to begin to rethink and
restructure everything from security to loca
tion at future electronic concerts. However,
both tragic incidents are minimal in compar-

ison to the disaster
at Germany's Love
Parade, where the
death toll has risen
to 21 after poor
planning led to a
fatal stampede in
the festival's only
tunnel entrance.
While not billed
as a "rave" and
attracting an
arguably different
crowd, this past
weekend's Hard
Summer festival in
downtown Los
Angeles was placed
under a lot of scruti
ny as the biggest
L.A. dance festival

since the widely publicized death at EDC.
Effective security was of the utmost impor
tance, and it became increasingly hard to
ignore the fact that last year's Hard Summer
was shut down after riots ensued. However,
this year's festival, featuring major dance
and electro acts like Erol Alkan, Major
Lazer and Crystal Castles, seemingly went
off without a hitch, not only because of the
minimal arrests and speedy, yet thorough,
security line, but because of the consistently
incredible musical performances and the
collective great time had by the 10,000 peo
ple attending.
When Intermission arrived at the Los
Angeles State Historical Park in the after
noon, we immediately headed to the Hard
Stage, while many opted for the other stage,
appropriately named Harder those with
a palette for dubstep and heavy electro got
their fix at the smaller and more intense
option. The first act that we caught was
Theophilus London, an urban pop artist
straight out of Brooklyn. Accompanied by
famed producer Skeet Skeet, Theophilus
charmed his way into our hearts with slick

dance moves, even slicker hip hop and a
charisma perfect for warming up the crowd.
The day really started to pick up when he
called for all of the ladies out in the audi
ence and announced, "It's time to make this
a ravel" while Skeet Skeet mixed dance
beats into Whitney Houston's "I Will
Always Love You."
From then on out, the crowd was dancing
into the night. Sets from Breakbot and The
Twelves heavily favored disco elements, and
aside from a minor technical glitch at the
beginning of Breakbot's set, all three DJs
proved to be up-and-coming talents with
infectious sounds. Smoothly transitioning
from the Twelves' set of disco and hit pop
tunes was seasoned DJ Green Velvet.
Dressed in a casual all-white suit, wearing
perhaps the biggest grim of anybody attend
ing, Green Velvet dropped "My House," the
Rhythm Controll classic that proclaims,

preacher-style,
"And in my house,
there is only house
music" to wild
cheers. He contin
ued to spin electron
ic and house music
that kept the crowd
not just dancing, but
smiling.
As the sun began
to set on the amaz
ing talent that is
Erol Alkan who
took the stage after
Green Velvet
Thomas Pentz, bet
ter known as Diplo,
took the stage for
an even larger
audience. After
gaining consider-

able popularity by producing many of
M.l.A.'s best songs (not to mention dating
her), as well as working with many other
major artists, Diplo is enjoying the peak of
his career and his set at Hard Summer
did not disappoint. After an hour of dancing
to his electro house set, the audience eager
ly awaited his return as half of the wildly
popular Major Lazer. Once back on stage
with Switch and the rest of the gang for
Major Lazer, Intermission was glad to see
that this outrageous show lived up to the
high bar previously set at this year's
Coachella.
Headliners Crystal Castles opened with
eerie chords from Ethan Kath on the syn
thesizer, surrounded by swirls of fog and
hazy lasers. Frontwoman Alice Glass
appeared on the drum set, swaying and
singing in a seemingly drug-induced trance.
With music sounding like a perfect mix of
hypnotic tones, thumping drums, video
game synths and screeching vocals, the live

haunting and captivating as their
recorded work. With Ethan
hunched over his equipment in the
back of the stage, a hoodie thrown
almost completely over his head, we
were enraptured with Alice, throw
ing herself into the crowd from
every side, moaning and screeching
with seemingly no direction as the
security guards made sure that she
made it out from the crowd surfing
somewhat safely. Their set seemed
to go by in the blink of an eye, leav
ing the crowd with not just goose
bumps and awe, but also the senti
ment of "what in the hell just hap
pened?"
Closing out the night was
Belgian electro-rock band Soulwax.
Dressed in their standard blue
leisure suits, the four-person band
took the stage with little to no fan
fare, playing many new tracks that
left audience dancing with their
mouths wide open, in shock that a
rock group could be so intense and
non-stop at such a high energy.
When the clock struck midnight, the
set was abruptly over, and the music
stopped for good. Concertgoers
trickled out of the park, disappoint
ed at the night's end, but thrilled
with memories of the events prior.
Despite all of the danger, death and
sadness of this summer's rave scene,
Hard managed to pull together not
only a safe and well-run event, but
one with music that reminded
everybody why dance festivals are

at Germany's Love
Parade, where the
death toll has risen
to 21 after poor
planning led to a
fatal stampede in
the festival's only
tunnel entrance.
While not billed
as a "rave" and
attracting an
arguably different
crowd, this past
weekend's Hard
Summer festival in
downtown Los
Angeles was placed
under a lot of scruti
ny as the biggest
L.A. dance festival

since the widely publicized death at EDC.
Effective security was of the utmost impor
tance, and it became increasingly hard to
ignore the fact that last year's Hard Summer
was shut down after riots ensued. However,
this year's festival, featuring major dance
and electro acts like Erol Alkan, Major
Lazer and Crystal Castles, seemingly went
off without a hitch, not only because of the
minimal arrests and speedy, yet thorough,
security line, but because of the consistently
incredible musical performances and the
collective great time had by the 10,000 peo
ple attending.
When Intermission arrived at the Los
Angeles State Historical Park in the after
noon, we immediately headed to the Hard
Stage, while many opted for the other stage,
appropriately named Harder those with
a palette for dubstep and heavy electro got
their fix at the smaller and more intense
option. The first act that we caught was
Theophilus London, an urban pop artist
straight out of Brooklyn. Accompanied by
famed producer Skeet Skeet, Theophilus
charmed his way into our hearts with slick

dance moves, even slicker hip hop and a
charisma perfect for warming up the crowd.
The day really started to pick up when he
called for all of the ladies out in the audi
ence and announced, "It's time to make this
a ravel" while Skeet Skeet mixed dance
beats into Whitney Houston's "I Will
Always Love You."
From then on out, the crowd was dancing
into the night. Sets from Breakbot and The
Twelves heavily favored disco elements, and
aside from a minor technical glitch at the
beginning of Breakbot's set, all three DJs
proved to be up-and-coming talents with
infectious sounds. Smoothly transitioning
from the Twelves' set of disco and hit pop
tunes was seasoned DJ Green Velvet.
Dressed in a casual all-white suit, wearing
perhaps the biggest grim of anybody attend
ing, Green Velvet dropped "My House," the
Rhythm Controll classic that proclaims,

preacher-style,
"And in my house,
there is only house
music" to wild
cheers. He contin
ued to spin electron
ic and house music
that kept the crowd
not just dancing, but
smiling.
As the sun began
to set on the amaz
ing talent that is
Erol Alkan who
took the stage after
Green Velvet
Thomas Pentz, bet
ter known as Diplo,
took the stage for
an even larger
audience. After
gaining consider-

able popularity by producing many of
M.l.A.'s best songs (not to mention dating
her), as well as working with many other
major artists, Diplo is enjoying the peak of
his career and his set at Hard Summer
did not disappoint. After an hour of dancing
to his electro house set, the audience eager
ly awaited his return as half of the wildly
popular Major Lazer. Once back on stage
with Switch and the rest of the gang for
Major Lazer, Intermission was glad to see
that this outrageous show lived up to the
high bar previously set at this year's
Coachella.
Headliners Crystal Castles opened with
eerie chords from Ethan Kath on the syn
thesizer, surrounded by swirls of fog and
hazy lasers. Frontwoman Alice Glass
appeared on the drum set, swaying and
singing in a seemingly drug-induced trance.
With music sounding like a perfect mix of
hypnotic tones, thumping drums, video
game synths and screeching vocals, the live

deaths at three events: ETD Pop, the Electric Daisy
Carnival, and Germany's Love Parade.
show is every bit as confusing,
haunting and captivating as their
recorded work. With Ethan
hunched over his equipment in the
back of the stage, a hoodie thrown
almost completely over his head, we
were enraptured with Alice, throw
ing herself into the crowd from
every side, moaning and screeching
with seemingly no direction as the
security guards made sure that she
made it out from the crowd surfing
somewhat safely. Their set seemed
to go by in the blink of an eye, leav
ing the crowd with not just goose
bumps and awe, but also the senti
ment of "what in the hell just hap
pened?"
Closing out the night was
Belgian electro-rock band Soulwax.
Dressed in their standard blue
leisure suits, the four-person band
took the stage with little to no fan
fare, playing many new tracks that
left audience dancing with their
mouths wide open, in shock that a
rock group could be so intense and
non-stop at such a high energy.
When the clock struck midnight, the
set was abruptly over, and the music
stopped for good. Concertgoers
trickled out of the park, disappoint
ed at the night's end, but thrilled
with memories of the events prior.
Despite all of the danger, death and
sadness of this summer's rave scene,
Hard managed to pull together not
only a safe and well-run event, but
one with music that reminded
everybody why dance festivals are
so amazing in the first place.
