## OUTSIDE LANDS PREVIEW 2010

Armed with a concentrated line
up of modern rock heroes and
70s throwbacks, Outside Lands
Music and Arts Festival is looking to survive
its gawky adolescent stage this weekend. As
Grateful Dead devotees and cardigan-wear
ing teenagers spill out of the BART, the
scaled-down festival, entering its third year in
San Francisco's Golden Gate Park, will still
be figuring out its niche in the otherwise well
established Bay Area music scene. Think of
this Saturday and Sunday as the fest's soul
searching period: all the bands and elements

of success are there, but whether they all gel
after this weekend is another story.
How eco-friendly Outside Lands fits into
the summer concert calendar is a work in
progress. If Indio's Coachella is a sunburned
attention hog and the maturing Treasure
Island is a soggy but lovable eccentric, then
Outside Lands 2010, held in the heart of
urban wilderness, is the newly-minted vegan
sandwiched in between. It's the type of festi
val that bills its headliners, wine menu and
bike parking at the same height.
Surprisingly, up until 2007, music-rich San
Francisco was still without a music festival to

call its own. Noise Pop and Another
Planet Entertainment whetted
appetites with the creation of
Treasure Island Music Festival in
September of 2007, but floating off
the Bay Bridge, TIMF never man
aged to inspire any homegrown pride.
As beloved as TIMF has become, it
hasn't been the defining music event
for the City by the Bay.

Cut to the other side of the
Peninsula in August 2008. Another
Planet Entertainment struck again,
dropping big-name acts such as
Radiohead, Ben Harper and Jack
Johnson into the iconic park for the
first Outside Lands, which drew in
around 100,000 music and nature
lovers. Though the event garnered a
smaller attendance in its sophomore
year, its sturdy lineup of Pearl Jam
and Dave Matthews Band assured
Outside Lands of its "annual" status.
For 2010, the festival has moved
past survival to self-reflection and
improvement. Unable to lock in an
anchor act for Friday, organizers
shaved off the third day early on, con
densing the music and arts fest into
Saturday and Sunday. The ahough
the identity of this year's Outside
Lands seems to be split between scen
ester indulgence and hippie-chic.
On Saturday, ennui-effusing indie
rock vets The Strokes are juxtaposed
against Grateful Dead successor
Furthur, featuring original Dead
members Phil Lesh and Bob Weir.
It'll be an interesting mix of jaded and
free spirits expect to see hippies'
bare feet sharing turf with trendily
aged European leather shoes a fit
ting combination for a city famous for
both its Summer of Love roots and its
Whole Foods-consuming yuppies.
Nevertheless, the central attrac

tion of the festival, the music, promis
es to deliver on the sonic end. Furthur
has the advantage of an excited, if a
bit aged, hometown audience. And
with a will-they-won't-they fourth
album in the works, the Strokes still
enjoy superstar status, even after
spawning multiple (and questionable)
side projects in their three-year hia
tus. Louisville rock natives My
Morning Jacket, currently between
albums, and now-sober belter Chan
Marshall of Cat Power round out the
rest of Saturday's lineup.
They are followed up by Kings of
Leon on Sunday, who are looking to
finally escape all those pigeon refer
ences (unlikely, considered the arbo
real nature of the park). The rock
outfit may have broken into the main

stream, but fans of both early "Youth
and Young Manhood" and commer
cial "Only by the Night" will roll out
for their headlining performance.
Festival mainstays Phoenix, Social
Distortion and Edward Sharpe & the
Magnetic Zeros ensure that this
year's sound system will go out with a
bang. A smattering of newcomers
such as Freelance Whales, The
Temper Trap and the Soft Pack have
also been thrown in to satisfy the
Bay's indie tastes.
Equally committed to the arts end
of Outside Lands, organizers this year
have placed almost as much market
ing weight on the wine and food
offerings as the festival soundtrack.
Attendees will have their pick of 33
restaurants and 26 vineyards to get a

sampling taste of the Bay Area.
The vision for Outside Lands 2010
may be the experience of sipping
local merlot out of a compostable
wine glass on Speedway Meadow,
with Phoenix strumming in the back
ground. And there's nothing wrong
with that.
Tickets, which are "affordable" in
this age of jacked up ticket monopolies,
are still available. Proceeds go to the
San Francisco Recreation and Park
Department, which will have the joy of
clearing out all those reusable bottles
and ... once everyone clears out of
Golden Gate Park on Sunday night.
