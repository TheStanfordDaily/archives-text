Grateful Dead devotees and cardigan-wear

scaled-down festival, entering its third year in
San Francisco's Golden Gate Park, will still
be figuring out its niche in the otherwise well
established Bay Area music scene. Think of
this Saturday and Sunday as the fest's soul
searching period: all the bands and elements

of success are there, but whether they all gel
after this weekend is another story.
How eco-friendly Outside Lands fits into
the summer concert calendar is a work in
progress. If Indio's Coachella is a sunburned
attention hog and the maturing Treasure
Island is a soggy but lovable eccentric, then
Outside Lands 2010, held in the heart of
urban wilderness, is the newly-minted vegan
sandwiched in between. It's the type of festi
val that bills its headliners, wine menu and
bike parking at the same height.
