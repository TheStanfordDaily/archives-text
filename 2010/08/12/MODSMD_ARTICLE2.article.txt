## UNIVERSITY Diversity remains ongoing struggle Stanford students overall more financially well off than rest of U.S. 
### ERIC MESSINGER SUMMER MANAGING EDITOR 
The composite picture of socioeconomic diver
sity at Stanford is a patchwork, both in the data
available and the efforts made to achieve it.
The first class of students at Stanford, in 1891,
famously required no tuition. Among the ranks of
the Farm's "pioneer class" was a young man born
in an lowa village, the son of a blacksmith and a
minister, who at the time of his admission was or
phaned and living in Oregon.
Herbert Hoover's enrollment at Stanford has
served for more than a century as the University's
archetypal story of success and meritocratic inclu
sion. Ensuring a diversity of class and background
at Stanford, however, has only grown more compli
cated since the days of Leland Stanford's recruiting
trips across the American West.
Competition is extremely high to enter Stan
ford, with an admit rate of 7.2 percent. And those
who make it in are, as a group, financially better off
than the rest of the American population. Accord
ing to Director of Financial Aid Karen Cooper, the
median family income at Stanford is approximate
ly $125,000; by contrast, the median family income
in the United States in 2008, the last year for which
data are available, is $61,521.
Beyond establishing a rough baseline, however,
determining the actual economic diversity of Stan
ford's students becomes a far more complex ques
tion.
Stanford's financial aid office only has reliable
information for the half of the student population it
provides aid to, and the Office of Undergraduate
Admission does not assess financial details during
its need-blind admission process. No University of
fice looks at the total economic composition of the
incoming freshman class, nor does any office actu
ally carry out demographic breakdowns by levels of
income.
At the lowest levels of income, 14 percent of the
undergraduate population received Pell Grants for
the 2008-09 academic year, typically rewarded to
families that make under $40,000 a year.
More broadly, 46 percent of Stanford students
receive need-based scholarships. While only ap
proximately 50 percent of the Stanford undergrad
uate population receives need-based financial aid,
an additional group of slightly over 30 percent re
ceives some other form of assistance, such as out
side or athletic scholarships, while 20 percent at
tend Stanford without any aid at all.
Of those families receiving need-based aid, only
about 15 to 20 percent earn more than $150,000 a
year, according to Cooper, and roughly 60 percent
make less than $lOO,OOO.
"What I have heard students say, both white and
black, is that, 'I didn't know I was low income until
I came to Stanford," said Sally Dickson, associate
vice provost and dean of educational resource cen
ters.
While the Office of Undergraduate Admission
strives to ensure the representation of minority
racial and ethnic groups in each class, Stanford does
not obtain a complete picture of a student's family
income until the student applies for financial aid.
As a result, the process of seeking economic diver
sity is not what Cooper would call an exact science.

"You really can't make any assumptions on
someone's income based on race or ethnicity or
even where they come from," Cooper said.
Stanford's administration emphasizes the diver
sity of background and life experience in its student
body, but specific data are not made public by the
Office of Undergraduate Admission beyond broad
indicators, such as the percent of students admitted
from California and the number of states and coun
tries represented.
Still, across the University, steps are being made
toward helping students feel more included on
campus. Dickson said the most pressing priority for
her office is meeting the needs of first-generation
college students, who make up an "increasing num
ber" of incoming students.
Dickson is seeking to fill a full-time staff posi

tion dedicated to addressing that community, a
post that was only quarter-time position during the
2009-10 academic year. Her office also sends spe
cial invitations to students who are first generation
or of "low income" from a household under
$lOO,OOO during New Student Orientation.
"I think what is important is that our overall cli
mate here at Stanford is welcoming and greeting,
and that all students feel they are a contributor to
the life of the campus," Dickson said.
"I do think that for students who come from
under-resourced high schools, or areas that are low
income, their adjustment and transition may be dif
ferent," she added.
Then there are incoming freshmen from rural

The full economic picture of Stanford's undergraduate population is, given available data, impossible to
determine precisely. There are indicators that Stanford's student body is less diverse in geographic and
socioeconomic background than in other common measures of diversity, such as race and ethnicity.
areas or states, a relatively small yet
substantial segment of the student
body. While they don't have a dedi
cated community center and aren't
greeted as a group during New Stu
dent Orientation, the challenges they
can face at Stanford are often similar.
Jon Christensen 'Bl, the executive
director of the Bill Lane Center for
the American West, said students
from rural areas have to navigate in
grained attitudes or prejudices to
ward their background.
"There's a part of the whole mod
ern project and the Western intellec
tual tradition, that in some ways posi
tions itself toward urban life and
away from rural experience," Chris
tensen said.
"There are students who come
from rural America who feel that
they still study under that burden,
and that their experience is not as
valid and that it is not recognized," he
added.
Bea Gordon 'lO, who majored in
English and environmental history

and grew up on a cattle ranch in
Wyoming, also said relating to her
classmates could be a challenge.
"You can't really talk about dri
ving a truck when you were seven
when you're with a bunch of people,"
she said.
But both Gordon and Christensen
said the classroom could provide a
means for students to feel more com
fortable, and that through academic
study rural students could connect
their experience with higher educa
tion to their life before Stanford.
"For me that was really nice, be
cause I got to learn more about my
home," Gordon said.
She emphasized that to view rural
students as one group would be to
oversimplify their experience a
problem that Christensen points to as
an additional challenge in reaching
out to students with diverse back
grounds.
"Everyone has a different rural
background," Gordon said. "I'm not
really going to be sympathetic with
someone who grew up on a corn farm
in Nebraska."
Christensen, who attended Stan
ford in the late 19705, was upbeat in
his assessment of the culture of inclu
sion on campus.

"I think there is more room for en
couraging and understanding and re
specting rural experience," he said.
"There is still some of that bias, but I
think there is more understanding
now, and that students feel more
comfortable and confident with
bringing that experience here to
Stanford."
In assessing diversity at Stanford,
one thing is clear: the picture is
murky, and in upcoming years it
won't become any more easier for
Stanford to match its practices to its
stated commitments.
"The world is becoming more di
verse, as we know, as well as the real
ization that there are students with
multiple identities," Dickson said.
But the role of diversity in provid
ing a crucial aspect of education at
Stanford seems to be an area of broad
agreement so long as the Univer
sity can allow a shared place at the
table for what Christensen calls the
"richer conversation" provided by
someone with a distinct background.
"It's about making space for that
kind of experience," Christensen
said.
