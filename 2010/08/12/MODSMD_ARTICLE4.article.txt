## PETE could improve solar tech 
### UTTARA SIVARAM DAILY INTERN 
Stanford engineers have found a new method for converting sun
light into electricity, which could significantly improve existing pho
tovoltaic and solar thermal technologies.
This new method, called photon enhanced thermionic emission
(PETE), was discovered by a University research group headed by
materials science and engineering Prof. Nick Melosh. Melosh went
public with the research on Aug. 1, publishing a paper on the subject
in Nature Materials.
"Despite some of the outrageous claims on the Internet," Melosh
said, "this is not a panacea, but is a unique method that can capture
both heat and light, and may one day be a valuable part of the ener
gy solution."
Photovoltaic solar technology currently relies on semiconduc
tors, which use photons from the sun to excite electrons, ultimately
generating an electrical current. This mechanism, however, becomes
less efficient with high temperatures, precluding the possibility of
using the waste heat to fuel a secondary generator. As a result, pho
tovoltaic and thermal energy conversion are mutually exclusive
processes, and current scientific efforts have focused on optimizing
one of the two.
Melosh's new approach, if successful, would solve this dilemma
by making high temperatures favorable to semiconductor-mediated
energy conversion. By using the semiconductor gallium nitrate,
coated with cesium, the researchers constructed a parallel plate
thermionic emission device, in which higher temperatures will excite
more electrons from the semiconductor cathode and generate cur
rent.
When photons strike the cathode, they increase the population of
electrons that can participate in the thermionic emission process,

which Melosh and his team dubbed "photon enhancement."
Since higher temperatures increase the efficiency of this process,
the researchers envision solar concentrators, which can multiply the
sun's intensity by 500 times, focusing light on a PETE device and si
phoning unused heat to drive other thermal conversion systems.
While current monocrystalline solar panels boast an efficiency of
around 26 percent, Melosh expects this new process to increase effi
ciency to 50-60 percent.
And since PETE's optimal temperature point is achieved well
after 200 degrees Celsius, it can function in areas such as the Mojave
Desert, whereas today's solar technology usually fails in tempera
tures above 100 degrees. However, this new technology is not limit
ed to such high-temperature climates, if large parabolic dishes are
used to concentrate the direct sunlight.
"It will actually work a little better in cold but sunny climes,"
Melosh said, "but mostly as long as there is direct sun, it should be
able to work."
"This needs solar concentrations of at least a few hundred times,
thus is most likely to be used for large scale utilities, though could
also be used for remote areas as well," he added.
While the cost of these dishes, in addition to the semiconductor
material and cesium, is not inexpensive, the output of this process
has the potential to rival that of fossil fuel combustion.
At the moment, tests have been run using gallium nitride, a com
mon material for household electronics. While the research team
has demonstrated the PETE process, stability and cost-effectiveness
remain obstacles for the technology.
"We have currently only shown the proof of principle experimen
tally, and shown theoretically that it could be quite efficient,"
Melosh said.
