## Students find new ways to study abroad Hold on BOSP 's overseas seminars forces undergrads to explore different options 
### JESSICA LIEBERMAN DAILY INTERN 
Due to financial problems, the University an
nounced last year that it would be placing its three-week
undergraduate overseas seminars on hold for 2010 a
decision that has caused students to look to other
sources and programs in order to travel abroad.
Former Bing Overseas Study Program (BOSP) di
rector and history Prof. Norman Naimark said that after
looking at different options carefully, the decision to cut
the seminar program made the most sense.
"The basic problem was financial," Naimark wrote in
an e-mail to The Daily. "As part of BOSP's need to cut
costs, the suspension of the seminar program turned out
to be the easiest and most viable way to meet budget."
BOSP, which at its height supported 10 seminars
with 150 students, has not helped students pursue their
own trips abroad during this period.
"Generally, BOSP does not get involved in individ
ual student opportunities, unless they are directly relat
ed to the students' study at one of our centers," Naimark
said. "In those cases, we do support individual research,
internships, and other student activities."
The cuts to this summer's overseas seminars have
forced students to search for other means to travel
abroad. Student in Government (SIG) offers overseas
fellowships for students during the summer, but
whether the hold on the seminars will largely affect SIG
remains unseen, according to SIG chair Valentin Bolot
nyy 'll.
"I can say with confidence that the high demand
we've seen specifically for our international fellowships
is a very good indicator of the popularity of internation
al experiences in general among Stanford students,"
Bolotnyy said. "It's hard to say whether or not SIG has
been affected or will be affected by cuts to overseas sem
inars."
" SIG fellowships and the overseas seminars are not
exactly perfect substitutes because the students that
apply to our fellowships look for a full summer work ex
perience in public service rather than the shorter and
more academic experience that the overseas seminars
used to offer," he added.
But even if students did look to SIG to support their
trip abroad, Bolotnyy said that, due to financial con
straints, SIG and other student groups would not be able
to support them all.
"We would simply not have the resources to soak up
the excess demand for international fellowship opportu
nities that the overseas seminar cuts have left in their
wake, even if we wanted to," he said.
The lack of overseas seminars this summer has com
pelled students to find new means to study abroad
and some have found that the new opportunities
they've pursued fit their needs better than the short
summer trip.
"While I would have immensely enjoyed attending
an overseas seminar, I have decided to pursue a quar
ter-long program instead," said Jessica Pih 'l2. "I think
that a quarter abroad is much more enriching than sim
ply three weeks abroad for a seminar."
But a short overseas trip can be just as gratifying as
a more long-term study abroad program, and other
Stanford offerings allow some students this experience.
"I would imagine those three weeks would resemble
a glorified, educational vacation rather than a cultural
ly edifying experience," Pih said. "I had the opportuni
ty to do so though Bill Durham's Sophomore College
class to the Galapagos, so I know that two-week semi
nars can truly make a difference in one's intellectual de
velopment."
"It is a great opportunity to meet
people who have similar academic in
terests and to truly get to know a
Stanford professor outside of the tra
ditional classroom environment on
campus," she added.
Some students, like Annie
Kramer 'l2, however, have not been
as affected by the hold as others, opt

ing to design their own study-abroad
plans.
"Since I am not participating in
any Bing programs, the hold will not
directly affect me," wrote Kramer,
who is taking a leave of absence for
2010-11 to travel, in an e-mail to The
Daily.
"I won't be 'studying' abroad in the
traditional sense," she added. "In
stead, I'm hoping to immerse myself in
other environments by working and
volunteering so that I can have some
'real world' interaction with local pop
ulations and other travelers."

Yet while students are finding new
ways to travel abroad, they still hope
BOSP and Stanford will resume the
seminars.
"Without the overseas seminars,
the University misses an opportunity
to educate its pupils beyond its walls
and to bring them to the teacher that
is the larger world," said Kip Hustace
'll. "I trust that, when the time is
right, the University will reinstitute
the overseas seminars."
