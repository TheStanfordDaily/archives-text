## Patterson to become new director of Admission 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€” Elizabeth Titus 
Stanford has hired Bob Patterson, currently the deputy
director of undergraduate admission at UC-Berkeley, as
the Farm's new director of Admission. Patterson begins
his new post on Sept. 13, according to Judith McCoy, a
spokeswoman for the Office of Undergraduate Admis
sion.
As the director of Admission, Patterson will have broad
influence over the increasingly competitive Stanford ad
mission process. Stanford's admission rate dropped to a
record-low 7.2 percent for the 32,022 applicants to the
Class of 2014. The rate for the Class of 2011, at the start of
former director Shawn Abbott's tenure, was 10.28 percent.
Patterson will also directly affect the makeup of fresh
man and transfer classes and affect the University's longer
term admission strategy, including international and ath
letic admission. He will report to Dean of Admission
Richard Shaw and oversee four assistant deans, who each
manage a set of admission officers.
Patterson, 34, has worked in Berkeley admissions since
Spring 2009, where he oversees a staff of 30. Berkeley had
50,312 applicants for Fall 2010 and admitted 25.6 percent,
according to its website.
From 2005 to 2009, Patterson was the associate director
of undergraduate admissions at the University of North
Carolina-Chapel Hill, according to an office newsletter an
nouncing his arrival to Berkeley. Prior to that, he spent
seven years as an admission and financial aid counselor at
the University of Pittsburgh, from which he earned his
bachelor's degree. He also holds a master's degree in high
er education.
"It is a honor and privilege to represent such world class
university," Patterson said in an e-mail to The Daily. "I am
anxiously awaiting my start at Stanford."
McCoy said the University opened its search for a new
admission director in May and finished last week. She said
Shaw, who was on vacation Wednesday, involved senior
administrators and admission staff in the hiring decision
one she called a "very intensive and long" process.
Patterson was one of four finalists invited to Stanford to
interview after a national search, McCoy said. He replaces
Abbott, whom Stanford hired in 2006. Abbott left in May
to become assistant vice president for undergraduate ad
missions at New York University.
