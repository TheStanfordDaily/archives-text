### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€” Buyan Pan 
The University signed a new lease with the Department
of Energy (DOE) on Aug. 4, extending a contract original
ly signed in 1962. The signatory parties agreed that the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) National Ac
celerator Laboratory will continue to function on Univer
sity land for another 33 years.
Leslie Hume, chair of Stanford's Board of Trustees,
said that she believed the extended contract between the
University and the DOE would continue to foster the co

operation that has brought on pioneering breakthroughs.
Hume and Paul Golan, the DOE site manager at SLAC,
signed the lease.
At a time when the results of the first user experiments
at the Linac Coherent Light Source, operated by the Uni
versity for the DOE, are being published, and proposals
are being made for multi-purpose experimental research
facilities at SLAC, officials say that the lease was signed at
a significant moment.
"SLAC is a tremendous resource for Stanford, and
over the next 33 years I anticipate that the research facili
tated by SLAC will have a transformative impact on our
society," Hume said in an interview with the Stanford Re
port.
Representatives from both the University and the De
partment of Energy expressed favorable opinions toward
the extended contract.
