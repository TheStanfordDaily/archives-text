# Stanford prof, working to find "stress vaccine"

### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€” Buyan Pan 
Some anxious Stanford students in future years may
have a new weapon in fighting stress about midterms, ca
reers and how to tell their parents they've changed their
major.
After 30 years of research into cures for stress, neuro
science Prof. Robert Sapolsky has discovered a possible
vaccine-like treatment for chronic stress, devising a genet
ically engineered formula to influence the chemistry of the
brain to counteract hormones that cause stress in the
human body.
Sapolsky had been conducting research on chronic
stress treatment for 30 years. After graduating from Har
vard in 1978 with a degree in biological anthropology, he
went to Kenya to study the influence of baboons' social
standings on their health. Through studies such as deter
mining the level of cholesterol and stress hormones in ba
boons' blood, Sapolsky saw chronic stress as a dangerous
condition linked to many serious health issues, including
Alzheimer's, depressive disorder and heart attacks.
He also found that in humans, hormones called fluco
corticoids, released when undergoing stress, were pro
duced in more levels than necessary and lingered after a re
sponse to a momentary alert. He therefore applied gene
therapy to tackling flucocorticoid levels, using the herpes
simplex virus as a carrier of the stress-counteracting genes.
The virus, already being used for other gene therapies,
could pass through blood-brain barriers, capillaries that
prevented excess materials in the blood from entering the
brain.
By replacing the dangerous genes in the herpes virus
with neuroprotective ones that would neutralize stress
hormones, Sapolsky thus created a vaccine-like injection
to counteract stress.
When given to rodents, an injection of the modified
virus triggered the release of neuroprotective proteins that
slowed cell death and limited damages to the brain. While
the vaccine-like treatment for stress is not yet available for
clinical trials on humans, Sapolsky's team has proved that
it is a possible means to tackle stress response,
Sapolsky was unavailable for comment at press time.
