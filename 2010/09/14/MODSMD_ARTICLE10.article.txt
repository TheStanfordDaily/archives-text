# Stanford unranked in WSJ list
## 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Ivy Nguyen 
Despite its usual placement at or
near the top of college rankings, Stan
ford University does not produce the
best graduates, according to a new
rankings list by The Wall Street Jour
nal that debuted Monday
The list ranks 25 top schools in the
nation by their success in producing
the best graduates according to aca
demic strength and communication
and leadership skills, measured by re
cent graduates' hiring experiences.
Pennsylvania State University tops
the list, followed by Texas A&M at

number two and the University of Illi
nois at Urbana-Champaign at num
ber three. Stanford's cross-bay rival,
UC-Berkeley, ranks at number 15,
while Stanford's perennial U.S. News
& World Report ranking rivals Har
vard, Yale and Princeton also do not
appear on the list.
To formulate this list, The Journal
interviewed 500 recruiters whose
companies hired 43,000 recent col
lege graduates in the past year and
asked them to choose from more than
100 top colleges and universities they
felt produced the best graduates. The
survey also features recruiter's picks
according to majors such as engineer
ing, accounting, computer science and
more.

Nineteen of the 25 ranked schools
were public, indicating, according to
The Journal, that recruiters preferred
to recruit from state schools rather
than Ivy League or private schools.
According to the same survey, intern
ships are the top way to increase the
likelihood of finding a job after grad
uation: more than a quarter of the
companies who took this survey re
ported that more than half of their
new college graduates had interned
with their firm in the past.
