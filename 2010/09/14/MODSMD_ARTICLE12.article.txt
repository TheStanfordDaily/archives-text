## EDITORIAL During four short years, think twice about Stanford 
### 
To those of you who are reading The
Daily for the very first time: congratu
lations. You have taken the first of
many steps in what will undoubtedly be an
amazing four years of your life here at Stan
ford. While a dizzying array of new faces and
opportunities whirl by, you took the time to
sit down and read a few lines about the go
ings on of this crazy place. This seemingly in
nocuous act of relaxation is actually some
thing much greater. What you are doing is in
vesting in your budding stay on the Farm.
What you are doing is giving a damn.
As you will no doubt come to discover, if
you haven't already, there are limitless things
to do on campus, with four years rightly feel
ing too short to fit even half of it all in. With
all this raging about you, it is easy to get
caught up in your student group, your sorori
ty, your major or your sports team. It is easy
to not pay attention to student government,
changes in housing policies or the status of
alumni fundraising. It is very easy to pass by
demonstrators in White Plaza without once
thinking about the issues for which they
stand. And it takes literally no effort to walk
by the table with the stack of Daily issues and
not think twice.

You, however, did. And for the rest of
your time on the Farm, we hope you will con
tinue to pick up The Daily and take the time
to think and talk about the events that are
shaping the school because this effort on
your part helps ensure the vibrancy that
makes Stanford one of the world's premier
institutions of higher learning. A public dia
logue, even at times rancorous and emotion
al, is the very foundation of the academy. By
keeping up to date on Stanford sports and

news, you are able to participate in and shape
that dialogue.
It is not difficult to argue that many of the
issues covered in these pages simply do not
matter, that changes in dining or Residential
Education do not impact your life in the
slightest. Particularly when the sun is shining
on the palms dotting the Quad, or when that
20-pager is rapidly coming due, it's difficult to
disagree. Leaving boring meetings and dense
readings to others feels like a pretty solid de
cision to make. And with good people in the
ASSU, admission, the office of the vice
provost for undergraduate education, and
departmental front desks, why worry?
There are many well-intentioned students
and staffers on this campus whose interests lie
with improving Stanford for you and every
one else. But odds are sometime in the next
four years, they will make a decision or take a
stand with which you would disagree. But
when you do not keep reading and thinking
about Stanford, it doesn't really matter what
you think. For good or ill, you are putting your
college experience in the hands of folks you
do not know, whom you will not meet and
who never may have the chance to hear out
your concerns. You become a passive player
in four of the more absurd years of your life.
So give a damn. Take the time to try and
understand how this place works, to get to
know the candidates for student govern
ment, to ask your RA and the dining hall
manager about their positions and their in
terests. Read The Daily. It matters less
whether or not you agree with what has been
written. It matters more that you are paying
attention.
Oh, and go Cardinal Football.
