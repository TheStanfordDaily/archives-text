# Failure is not just an option; it's inevitable
## 
### Peter McDonald 
If New Student Orientation is about one
thing, it's about hearing speeches. Most of
them are self-congratulatory, recounting
that percent-admitted statistic that just keeps
getting smaller or the veritable Model U.N.
that makes up the international-students
subsection. My year, at the Discover Stan
ford assembly, Etch first went into great de
tail about the kid who had already been pub
lished for his research in robots, then talked
about six more people before he mentioned
Michelle Wie. It's a good little ego stroke or
insecurity provoker, but mostly it's a setup
for where he goes next: an exhortation of the
entire freshmen class to fail, because failure
promotes learning.
It's a jarring piece of advice in the middle
of an otherwise inspiring speech, partially be
cause of the arrogance it betrays: that we as
Stanford students really have succeeded at
everything in our lives, to the point that we
need to intentionally fail in order to be prop
er human beings.Thank God there aren't any
undercover Kal fans in the audience. It's a pi
quant suggestion, though, because even
though Etch mostly just means, "Take hard
classes so we can look good," he's kind of got
a point, though you won't really need to try in
order to fail. Even if you make it out of here
without a dreaded "NP," or even an "RP," on
your transcript, you will fail at something,
and you will fail someone.
How do I know this will happen? It turns
out college is not just four years of learning
or "self-discovery," but also four years of
growing up, which you can't do without mak
ing mistakes, sometimes huge ones. Remem
ber the last four years of your life you just
spent in high school. I have serious questions
about your character if you're not thorough
ly disgusted with your 14-year-old self and
his/her/per conduct.
What's more, you're finally on your own
and riding high on that wave of vindication
that's been lasting ever since you loaded up
your application Web page at 6:00:00 PM
EST on March 31. After all, you had already
spotted the cognitive dissonance from a mile
away. They keep trying to parent you while
they're in and out of therapy or in the middle
of a divorce proceeding. Eventually you
learn to tune most of it out and just recognize
that all their advice about how to treat other
people is really just about how to treat them,
since they're the only people you know in
side and out at this point in your life anyway,
and they're your parents. That letter of ac
ceptance is proof that throughout it all, you
knew what you were doing, so you're going to
trust your instincts from now on.
But the failure will come, rest assured, and
soon enough you'll be back longing for the
days when lying to your parents about going
to the library was the greatest moral compro
mise you ever made. You'll be on the receiv
ing end first, probably from your dorm mates,
who never knew anything but Stern Love. If
you're lucky, it'll be followed by a "Sorry,
man," but chances are that person will con
tinue on like nothing ever happened, most
likely because he/she/ze's got a huge
midterm coming up. And then, soon enough,
you'll pay it forward.
You'll become the Person Who Booted

All Over the Hallway and Didn't Clean It Up
or the Person Who Mooches Way Too Much
Weed but Gets Self-Righteous When Con
fronted About It. Or maybe the Person Who
Flakes Out after Over-Committing Himself,
Leaving Everyone Else in the Group Hold
ing the Bag. Or the Person Whose Excessive
Criticism is Driving Your Close Friend Deep
er into a State of Depression. Or the Sober
Guy Who Kept Going Even Though She Was
Far Too Drunk to Respond to Anything,
Much Less Consent. In some way, you will do
something that will reveal that the thread
count of moral fibers in the oh-so-unique
tapestry of you is far closer to 150 than to the
1,500 you were so sure it was during ethics
class.
And you'll probably get away with it.
You'll also move on from it, as will the
main target from your damage, and you'll
both go on to realize all that brilliant poten
tial that you carry. With any luck, you'll use it
to solve all the other problems you see
around you, the ones everyone else is too ab
sorbed in to notice.
Don't get too down on yourself just yet,
because you're not a bad person, I don't
think. You just have some growing up to do.
Eventually you'll learn to despise your 18-
year-old self just as much as you despise your
14-year-old one, and that's all Etch was real
ly asking of you in the first place.

Even if you make it out
of here without a
dreaded "NET or even
an"RK' on your
transcript, you will fail
at something, and you
will fail someone.
