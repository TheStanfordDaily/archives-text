# Breaking the bubble

### Aaditya Shidham 
If you listen to any of Roy Zimmerman's
brilliant political satire (You Tube him),
you'll have heard of this lyric: "America is
a Japanese fiddler / in Branson, Missouri /
doing Louie Armstrong."
That one line says a lot to me about this
campus. It is more than a description of our
diversity. It is a description of the ridiculous
juxtapositions present in daily Stanford life.
The examples go on and on: the ugly roaring
head of Meyer is located next to the elegant
Quad. Our police enforce local bike laws but
often turn a blind eye to drinking laws, except
if we bike while intoxicated. Condoleezza
Rice and the rest of the Hoover Institution
are members of our otherwise liberal faculty.
We use Axess, yet we invented Google. We
are diverse, but not when it comes to our
computer science majors' genders or the
Kappa Sig chat list. Premeds seem to always
cut each other's throats. Bike thefts and the
honor code coexist (we don't cheat, but we
won't give up stealing?). A church defines the
center of our decidedly secular campus.
Many of us have sunny dispositions despite
difficult issues of depression and procrastina
tion.
Could we be weirder? That is to say, could
we be more American?
When I went home from campus for the
first time, I was under the opposite impres
sion, still under the trance of the all-impor
tant Stanford bubble created in my first quar
ter here. So, just to show everyone how just

how entitled and privileged I was as a college
student, I made sure that I carried at least one
Stanford article everywhere I went in my lit
tle Ohio suburb. At the airport, my Stanford
sweatshirt was on top of a Red Zone t-shirt,
complete with bright red Stanford sweat
pants. Whenever it was raining, I flashed my
Stanford umbrella from the car for the world
to see. I looked like a Cardinal logo every
where I went. I realize only now, as I write
this, how irritating I must have been to my
friends and family.
Although not all of you have gone to my
lengths to emphasize your Stanford-ness to
an apathetic populace, I have brushed up
against this psychological concept of entitle
ment in my peers here. So, readers, let us pop
the bubble for a second. Let us realize that all
of us convert ADP to ATP and then back. All
of us put our pants on one foot at a time. In

summary, everybody poops.
It is better for us to assume that our places
as Stanford students are really like the places
of every other college student. Although this
assumption may not be totally true, it em
powers us to let go of the opposite: an ill-con
ceived isolation from the world around us.
Realizing that our future is inextricably
linked with that of our peers forces us to
work and think on larger spheres of political
and social action, making a real difference
beyond the Stanford community.
We may be the cream of the crop, but still,
we are mostly made of high-fructose corn
syrup like every other American college stu
dent. We are all hapless individuals, just with
a few more Olympic- and Nobel-worthy aspi
rations, continually confused by the whole
question of what it means to be a real man or
woman in today's society. Our place and fate,
like the rest of America, is to fail and succeed
over and over again until, as Kipling so fa
mously wrote, we can treat both those im
posters just the same.
So, fellow readers, I implore you: look
around, further than the walls of the Quad.
Do work in your time here that has direct im
pact on a society larger than your school.
Make an effort to embrace the high-fructose
corn syrup similarities within all of us and
let go of the rest.
