# Welcome, behind the scenes
## 
### Cris Bautista 
These past couple years, I worked for
The Stanford Daily behind the scenes
as a graphics editor. I remember while
I waited for graphics requests, I read the
columns a good deal of them during my
run there. I always wanted to write a column
of my own, but I never knew what I had to
offer.

Now, here goes: my experience as a queer,
trans-identified person at Stanford.
It has been a positive one. I came into
Stanford as lesbian and didn't come out as
trans until winter quarter sophomore year.
Despite a couple bumps here and there with
the pronoun change, Stanford has accepted
me for me. When I consulted the registrar's
office, they changed my preferred name to
Cristopher Marc within the week. My profes
sors who knew me before my transition ad
dressed me by my preferred name and pro
noun without a second thought. I was al
lowed to study overseas at Oxford as a guy.
And as if I couldn't love my university more,
Cardinal Care announced its coverage of
transgender surgery beginning in the 2010-11
school year. Stanford is a mighty fine place to
be trans.
But Stanford isn't the real world. My
name on Stanford Who is Cristopher Marc,
but that's only my preferred name. The regis
trar allows me to use it in some instances, but
not in others. My preferred name shows up
on class rosters, but my legal name, Cristina
Marie, is still printed on official documents,
such as my transcript, ID and housing forms.
The registrar's office said it wouldn't be able
to make my names consistent until I legally
change my name a process in California
that costs hundreds of dollars. We're not even
getting started on changing the gender mark
er on my birth certificate.
There also are the rather uncomfortable
explanations at interviews about why the
name on my transcript doesn't match the one
on my resume. Or, at the supermarket when
I'm carded buying beer, the cashier stares
puzzlingly from my face back to my name

and picture on the ID, then back to my face
again, until he finally laughs awkwardly and
tells me he thought I was a dude. That one
time when I was in a club in London, a couple
drunk girls kept asking me if I was a boy or a
girl and even went as far as trying to touch me
and "check."
The real world is out there, and the real
world isn't going to be fun. Once I'm looking

for jobs or applying to grad school, a simple
mention of, "Oh, I'm trans," might not fly, es
pecially in a world where an English major
like me might not be able to find a job here,
and would have to look for work in places
that might not dig the whole queer thing.
This year is going to be a big one for me.
Not only am I a senior writing an honors the
sis and being an RA a frosh dorm (Serra
love), but I'm also looking at a couple big
steps in my transition. I need my transcript to
match my preferred name in time for gradu
ate school applications, so I'm going to court
to change my legal name. I'm also about to
start the process of hormone therapy so I can
finally treat my "testosterone deficiency," as
I like to affectionately call it.
The goal of this column is to document
this journey. I want this to get people won
dering, to get them talking. I want people to
understand. I'm not saying that my experi
ence is the definitive transgender experi
ence. My story is simply one of many.
Perhaps, a couple years down the line, a
young transgender Stanford student who
has just come out will look for some re
sources. They will type "Stanford transgen
der" into Google, grasping for straws and
this column will pop up in the Daily archives.
Yeah, it's only a small handful of articles, full
of weird little anecdotes and observations
from this small Filipino transboy who gradu
ated years and years ago. But it's at least
something. I remember when I was first com
ing out, I was desperate for at least some
thing, because something was better than
nothing.
So if you're reading this, Stanford student
from the future: this is for you, and I hope
reading these words will make your transi
tion a little bit easier.
Stanford, I offer you my experiences in
the form of this column. Sit back and enjoy
my journey into manhood.
