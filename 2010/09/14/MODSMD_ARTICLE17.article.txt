## HELICOPER PARENTS HAVING A HARD TIME LETTING GO IS OK. HOVERING, NOT SO MUCH. 
### CAROLINE CASELLI DESK EDITOR 
After a whirlwind day of hauling belongings,
tracking new faces and darting from infor
mation sessions to the opening convocation
ceremony on the Quad, new Stanford stu
dents and their parents return to the resi
dences for an event simply entitled "Welcome Home"
on the New Student Orientation (NSO) schedule.The
description of the event is understated, yet clear: "The
conclusion of this event is the typical time for you to say
goodbye to your student."
But for some parents, the concept of "goodbye" is
open to wider interpretation. While their children may
now reside somewhere else, some parents common
ly referred to as "helicopter parents" for their tenden
cy to hover overhead go to great lengths to remain
heavily involved in their college students' lives.
"In my experience, helicopter parents are those
who want to do the heavy lifting for their student re
mind them of deadlines, fix things for them, find an
swers for them and be a constant presence in their
lives," said Dean of Freshmen and Undergraduate Ad
vising Julie Lythcott-Haims 'B9.
Lythcott-Haims, commonly referred to by students
as Dean Julie, wrote in the Chicago Tribune on the

f topic
of heli
copter par-

ents in 2005.

She explained
that colleges and
universities began

to notice this phe
nomenon of increas-

ingly involved parents
who were "staying beyond

drop-off to ask questions, meet with advisers and ques
tion the fairness of policies and processes" in the early
part of the decade. Since then, this group of parents has
only continued to grow, even following children into
graduate school and the workplace.
"We know that their actions are rooted in love and
they do it to be helpful," Lythcott-Haims said. "But if
they stopped to think about it for a minute, I think they
would see that they are undermining their ultimate
goal, which is to raise a human from childhood to self
sufficient adulthood."
"Their behavior also sends quite a discouraging
message," she added, "which is, 'I don't trust you to be
able to handle this on your own.'"
Many Stanford students felt their parents' pres
ences in college, especially during the initial adjust
ment months away from home, but few felt that Mom
and Dad's actions were overbearing or oppressive.
"My parents literally flew from Texas like every
weekend my first fall at Stanford," remembered Kit
Garton TO, a Human Biology major from Dallas.
"They claimed it was to go to the football games, but
that was back in the day when the football team was
awful."

However, Garton didn't mind her
parents' periodic visits and even cited
several benefits that stemmed from them.
"When they came, they always offered to take me
and my new friends out to eat, which was always appre
ciated," she said. "It was nice because now all my col
lege friends know my parents and my family. And they
never hung around the dorm or anything."
Others, like Karen Nesbitt 'll, a senior lacrosse
player, felt that having an older sibling who had already
been through the "off-to-college" routine eased the
farewell for both her and her mother.
"My mom came out with me to move-in I'm
from Ohio," said Nesbitt. "I think I was too wrapped up
in the excitement of moving in and being on my own to
really be sad that I was moving across the U.S. My mom
had done the same thing two years before with my
older sister, so we kind of had the drill down, I think."
Without being physically present, Nesbitt's mother
sent" lots of packages" to Karen through the mail as a
friendly reminder of love from home.
"I'm a senior now and she still does," Nesbitt said.
"Christmas lights, Halloween decorations, Easter bas
kets, finals 'study-break' materials [like] trashy maga
zines, food, all the good stuff. She even includes things
for my roommates."
But not all parents are so benignly involved. Calling
and e-mailing multiple times a day or contacting pro
fessors with grade complaints on behalf of their chil
dren, for example, may be more debilitating than help
ful in this transition to independence.
Both Lythcott-Haims and Greg Boardman, the vice
provost for student affairs, emphasize that parents still
have an important role in their children's develop
ment, albeit probably different than the role they held
for the previous 18 years.
"We often say that our primary relationship is with
students, and we view parents as our partners in pro
moting students' success," Boardman said. "We want
parents to know that we appreciate their involvement,
and at the same time we expect students to develop and
grow as individuals during their undergraduate ca
reers."

Lythcott-Haims mentioned outreach efforts by the
University to parents that are intended to "convey
both our respect for the important role they still play in
the lives of their adult children and our philosophy of
treating the student as an adult."
These outreach efforts include an annual letter
from President Hennessy, a quarterly newsletter, a Par
ent Guide, a parent tab on the University website, a
"helpline" for routine questions
(mykidis@stanford.edu) and a set of events on the first
day of NSO designed to answer frequently asked ques
tions.

Boardman feels that an open dialogue may help
parents and students reach a comfortable middle
ground and alleviate some of the tension and anxiety
both parties can feel.

"I suggest that parents and students have a conver
sation about this separation and what each person is
feeling," he said. "It may be possible to agree on a reg
ular check-in session by text, e-mail or phone so par
ents feel involved and students don't feel their new
lives are being unexpectedly interrupted."
As freshmen finish moving in and the goodbye ap-

wanted to go to the
football games..."

proaches, Lythcott-Haims and
Boardman say they hope to provide
empathy and reassurance for the
parents of the Class of 2014.
"Parents of Stanford students
have worked hard to help their stu
dent get to this point, and although
they may feel great pride and satis
faction there is also a great deal of
wistfulness," Lythcott-Haims said.
"My advice is simply that parents

allow themselves to experience both
the joy and pain of this separation.
These feelings are real and the Uni
versity is quite empathetic about it
all, so there is no need to hide these
feelings on move-in day."
"It's understandable that parents
want to feel connected to their sons
and daughters whom they've worked
hard to raise," Boardman added. "I
encourage them to have faith in their
children and trust that their children
will make good choices as they con
tinue to grow and mature."

"We often say that our primary relationship is with
students, and we view parents as our partners in pro
moting students' success," Boardman said. "We want
parents to know that we appreciate their involvement,
and at the same time we expect students to develop and
grow as individuals during their undergraduate ca
reers."

Lythcott-Haims mentioned outreach efforts by the
University to parents that are intended to "convey
both our respect for the important role they still play in
the lives of their adult children and our philosophy of
treating the student as an adult."
These outreach efforts include an annual letter
from President Hennessy, a quarterly newsletter, a Par
ent Guide, a parent tab on the University website, a
"helpline" for routine questions
(mykidis@stanford.edu) and a set of events on the first
day of NSO designed to answer frequently asked ques
tions.

Boardman feels that an open dialogue may help
parents and students reach a comfortable middle
ground and alleviate some of the tension and anxiety
both parties can feel.

"I suggest that parents and students have a conver
sation about this separation and what each person is
feeling," he said. "It may be possible to agree on a reg
ular check-in session by text, e-mail or phone so par
ents feel involved and students don't feel their new
lives are being unexpectedly interrupted."

proaches, Lythcott-Haims and
Boardman say they hope to provide
empathy and reassurance for the
parents of the Class of 2014.
"Parents of Stanford students
have worked hard to help their stu
dent get to this point, and although
they may feel great pride and satis
faction there is also a great deal of
wistfulness," Lythcott-Haims said.
"My advice is simply that parents

allow themselves to experience both
the joy and pain of this separation.
These feelings are real and the Uni
versity is quite empathetic about it
all, so there is no need to hide these
feelings on move-in day."
"It's understandable that parents
want to feel connected to their sons
and daughters whom they've worked
hard to raise," Boardman added. "I
encourage them to have faith in their
children and trust that their children
will make good choices as they con
tinue to grow and mature."

After a whirlwind day of hauling belongings,
tracking new faces and darting from infor
mation sessions to the opening convocation
ceremony on the Quad, new Stanford stu
dents and their parents return to the resi
dences for an event simply entitled "Welcome Home"
on the New Student Orientation (NSO) schedule.The
description of the event is understated, yet clear: "The
conclusion of this event is the typical time for you to say
goodbye to your student."
But for some parents, the concept of "goodbye" is
open to wider interpretation. While their children may
now reside somewhere else, some parents common
ly referred to as "helicopter parents" for their tenden
cy to hover overhead go to great lengths to remain
heavily involved in their college students' lives.
"In my experience, helicopter parents are those
who want to do the heavy lifting for their student re
mind them of deadlines, fix things for them, find an
swers for them and be a constant presence in their
lives," said Dean of Freshmen and Undergraduate Ad
vising Julie Lythcott-Haims 'B9.
Lythcott-Haims, commonly referred to by students
as Dean Julie, wrote in the Chicago Tribune on the

f topic
of heli
copter par-

ents in 2005.

She explained
that colleges and
universities began

to notice this phe
nomenon of increas-

ingly involved parents
who were "staying beyond

drop-off to ask questions, meet with advisers and ques
tion the fairness of policies and processes" in the early
part of the decade. Since then, this group of parents has
only continued to grow, even following children into
graduate school and the workplace.
"We know that their actions are rooted in love and
they do it to be helpful," Lythcott-Haims said. "But if
they stopped to think about it for a minute, I think they
would see that they are undermining their ultimate
goal, which is to raise a human from childhood to self
sufficient adulthood."
"Their behavior also sends quite a discouraging
message," she added, "which is, 'I don't trust you to be
able to handle this on your own.'"
Many Stanford students felt their parents' pres
ences in college, especially during the initial adjust
ment months away from home, but few felt that Mom
and Dad's actions were overbearing or oppressive.
"My parents literally flew from Texas like every
weekend my first fall at Stanford," remembered Kit
Garton TO, a Human Biology major from Dallas.
"They claimed it was to go to the football games, but
that was back in the day when the football team was
awful."

However, Garton didn't mind her
parents' periodic visits and even cited
several benefits that stemmed from them.
"When they came, they always offered to take me
and my new friends out to eat, which was always appre
ciated," she said. "It was nice because now all my col
lege friends know my parents and my family. And they
never hung around the dorm or anything."
Others, like Karen Nesbitt 'll, a senior lacrosse
player, felt that having an older sibling who had already
been through the "off-to-college" routine eased the
farewell for both her and her mother.
"My mom came out with me to move-in I'm
from Ohio," said Nesbitt. "I think I was too wrapped up
in the excitement of moving in and being on my own to
really be sad that I was moving across the U.S. My mom
had done the same thing two years before with my
older sister, so we kind of had the drill down, I think."
Without being physically present, Nesbitt's mother
sent" lots of packages" to Karen through the mail as a
friendly reminder of love from home.
"I'm a senior now and she still does," Nesbitt said.
"Christmas lights, Halloween decorations, Easter bas
kets, finals 'study-break' materials [like] trashy maga
zines, food, all the good stuff. She even includes things
for my roommates."
But not all parents are so benignly involved. Calling
and e-mailing multiple times a day or contacting pro
fessors with grade complaints on behalf of their chil
dren, for example, may be more debilitating than help
ful in this transition to independence.
Both Lythcott-Haims and Greg Boardman, the vice
provost for student affairs, emphasize that parents still
have an important role in their children's develop
ment, albeit probably different than the role they held
for the previous 18 years.
"We often say that our primary relationship is with
students, and we view parents as our partners in pro
moting students' success," Boardman said. "We want
parents to know that we appreciate their involvement,
and at the same time we expect students to develop and
grow as individuals during their undergraduate ca
reers."
