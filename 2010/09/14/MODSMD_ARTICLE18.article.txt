# THROUGH FRESH EYES
## 
### HELENA VILLALOBOS 
It's that time of the year V
again. The signs abound, V
from terrified newbies try- V
ing to navigate their bikes S
around the Circle of Death
to a campus recharged with enthusi
asm and adventure. The freshmen are

here.
I can feel their excitement radiating in
waves all the way from Middle-of-Nowhere,
Texas, and I cannot help but think of my first

day on the Farm the year before. Sometimes
when I look back on that day, 1 try to forget the cringe

worthy moments. But most of the time, I remember the
experience with fondness.
Most people look forward to move-in day at Stanford.
While I was indeed thrilled about moving in and finally
counting myself among the Stanford student body, you could
say f was a bit apprehensive.
And by that, I mean my palms were sweating and heart
was beating out of my chest.
I had spent the better part of the past nine months excited
about the adventures I would encounter at Stanford. Ever
since 1 received that glorious letter of acceptance, 1 often pic
tured move-in day. In my head it went like this: arrive at Stan
ford, meet super-awesome roommate, unpack bags, send par
ents back to Texas, study hard and party on.
It went nothing like that.
For starters, I couldn't sleep the night before. I knew that
the next day, there would be no going back.
I was quiet the whole car ride to Stanford. My dad looked
at me nervously through the rearview mirror. "Hey, cheer up,
mija," he said. "It feels like we're dropping you off at juvie,not
Stanford."
As we pulled up to Roble Hall, there were students holding
signs and blowing horns, just like the pictures in the Stanford
information pamphlet. My jitters slowly started to dissipate.
Even before getting a chance to get my keys, there were
people coming at me from all directions. Some offered to help
with my luggage and one wanted to know my name so the DJ
could shout it over the intercom alongside "Party in the
USA."
A redhead walked over and introduced himself. "Hey, you
must be Helena," he said. "I'm Red, your RA. Quack."
No lie. He quacked. I immediately felt a bond of kinship
because, much to the chagrin of my family, my ringtone was a
quacking duck.
Red would later prove to be one of the quirkiest and most
creative people I have met at Stanford, as well as the best RA
any lost freshman could ask for. He explained how he built
Versailles inside his dorm room. He even let us play with liq-

uid

nitro
gen during
hall meetings.
If the extensive
decorations didn't convey

how serious Roble was about
the Willy Wonka theme, the man
made chocolate waterfall situated in the
main entrance did the trick. I was shocked at

how many superlatives I had used to describe Stanford even
before reaching my room.
My mom and I walked through the maze that is Roble Hall
pretending to know where we were going. A friendly Asian
man looking like a true Stanford tourist and proud parent,
complete with a video camera around his neck, approached
me like we were old buddies. I did what any other decent per
son would do: wave and act like I know him.
"Are you Helena?" he asked.
I hesitated, skeptical about who he was and how he knew
me. Turns out he was my roommate's dad, and he was just as
lost as we were. After two rides up and down the elevator and
another two trips via the stairs, we found my room.
The first thing that came to view was stuff four girls'
worth of stuff. The beds were everywhere, the desks were
everywhere, the clothes were everywhere and there was a Lil'
Wayne poster staring me directly in the eye.
Even though expectations had so far been completely off
target, I was spot-on about one thing: I had the best room
mates. Soon after the traditionally awkward first meeting, we
started talking like we had known each other forever. Out
wardly we were different, but we meshed well. Our cultural
diversity prompted Anne, Jen, Alyssa and me to joke that our
room looked like an advertisement for the United Nations.
Meeting my roommates put me at ease, but the pit of the
day was saying goodbye to my parents on the Roble lawn. My
family is kind of like the Mexican version of "My Big Fat Greek
Wedding," so goodbyes are never easy. Not even the sight of my
