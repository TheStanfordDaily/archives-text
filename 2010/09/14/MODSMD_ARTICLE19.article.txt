# FINDING A SECOND HOME, WITH TIME
## Newly minted sophomore reflects on last year's journey 
### JENNY THAI CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
I don't have a photographic memory,
but I don't need one to remember
move-in day, the first step along my
college journey: the ring of shocked
eardrums, the personalized greet
ings, the surprised cries of delight upon
meeting roommates.
It was one of the busiest weeks I had
ever gone through. Socializing was not
only rapid, but rampant. Everyone
seemed to want to make friends with
everyone else. Every freshman was quick
to take advantage of the dining halls' all
you-can-eat meals. If that weren't
enough, every minute of NSO was filled
with assemblies, workshops, social mix
ers, you name it.
Overwhelming? It was just the begin
ning.
At first, classes seemed easy. Instead
of the old high school 8-a.m.-to-2-p.m.
routine with seven to eight classes, there
were four classes dispersed throughout
the week. But many students, including
me, quickly found the sentiment of ease
was only an illusion. Maybe Chem3lX
lecture met for 50 minutes three times a
week, but those "free" hours in the after
noon, when we might rather be playing
video games or hanging out with friends,
came with a hefty price. There were sim
ply not enough hours in the day to get
everything done. Sleep deprivation be
came a chronic ailment.
Too much excitement can be danger
ous. I wanted to take 19 units and four
classes. I signed up for 15 clubs. I even
planned time in my schedule to indulge in
my fantasy-books fetish. In short, it was a
year-long ban on proper sleep.
Then, the third week of fall quarter, I
got a generous dose of swine flu.
Some called it misfortune. Others
called it a failure to wash hands with run
ning water for at least 20 seconds. I called
it bullheaded, "I-should-have-seen-this
coming" stupidity.
It was the worst week I had at Stan
ford. I couldn't go to classes. (Heaven
knows I tried to get to chem lecture, but

the ground spun wildly on my feet, pre
venting me from leaving the building.)
My throat stabbed with hot miniature
sabers, those aching chills and that
stuffed-up nose the whole nine yards.
During those agonizing hours, the
same delirious thoughts kept repeating
themselves in disjointed, abrupt jolts: "I
don't want to be here. 1 want to go
home."
I couldn't go home. Instead, Stanford
ended up bringing home to me.
My roommate helped out with er
rands, running the risk of illness by being
in the same room. The RAs checked on
me regularly to ask if I was ok.
These were small gestures, but they
meant so much to me. It was then that I
realized I was not alone. There were
helping hands every step of the way.
As the weeks flew by, I slowly began
to learn not only the names of everyone
in Alondra, but about their pasts, their in
terests and their families. Gradually, I
crept out from my shell, like a waking
tortoise as it tentatively tests the air,
inching out to see what all the commo
tion is about. The dorm had become a
second home.
I did things I never dared to do before.
Band run was painfully wild, and was the
first time I had stayed up past midnight.
Secret Snowflake was a polarizing expe
rience; in some of the dares, I have
learned more about my fellow Alondrans
than I had originally cared to know. Best
of all, doors were always open. People
ambled around the hallways, their heads
poking into rooms for no other reason
other than to just hang out.
My dorm mates agreed with what I
came to feel. "I couldn't have asked for a
more awesome group of people to share
freshman year with," said Maria Dogero
'l3.
"I am positive that my summers will
be spent reminiscing on the days when I
was watching epic movies [and] getting to
know some truly amazing people," Scott
Thao 'l3 wrote in an e-mail to the Alon
dra chat list that year.
"The Alondra that we made will al
ways be in my mind and heart," said Do
minique Dabija 'l3
As summer draws to a close, the real
fun begins. But as I learned, activities
alone don't complete the Stanford expe
rience. It's the accompanying bubbly sen
sation in the stomach, the anticipation of
seeing those familiar faces.
