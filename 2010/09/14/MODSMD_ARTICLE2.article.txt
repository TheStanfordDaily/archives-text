# Row projects delay staff move-in, set-up
## Storey smells of fresh paint; staffers await kitchen inspections and landscaping 
### KATE ABBOTT DESK EDITOR 
The staffs of three Row houses moved in
just last Friday after improvement projects
awaited completion and county inspections,
sending the staffs to other houses during
training this month and delaying set-up and
decorating.
While other row staffs moved into their
residences at the beginning of last week, the
resident assistants (RAs) for the three af
fected dorms Bob, La Casa Italiana and
Storey were housed in Xanadu. Student
Housing placed managers in Alondra. The
construction prevented the staffs from en
tering their houses until last Friday. As a re
sult, all aspects of house openings were
pushed back, from the practical, such as
kitchen checks, to the more light-hearted,
such as theme decorations.
"There was a minimal effect on training,
but getting the house prepared for move-in
was kind of a hassle," said Casa RA Blake
Miller 'll. "A lot of the stuff that used to be
in the house is in storage containers, and we
haven't been able to unload those yet...
but that's not a huge inconvenience."
RAs arrived on campus Aug. 27, with
other staff members moving in early Sep
tember. Some freshman RAs also were dis
placed while waiting for renovations in
Trancos and Soto.
According to Rodger Whitney, executive
director of Student Housing, the Row hous
es were slated for renovation over the next
three years as part of the Capital Improve
ment Program (CIP). Though each project
was estimated to need six months for com
pletion, all were finished this summer in just
three. The houses got seismic improve
ments, life-safety upgrades, new restrooms,
water-conserving appliances and "signifi

cant" aesthetic improvements, he said.
"We believe the students assigned to
these residences will be very pleased with
the significant improvements made to their
living space over the past three months,"
Whitney wrote in an e-mail to The Daily.
As of last Friday, all the houses were cer
tified "livable" by county inspectors, but are
not without issues.
"As they approached the deadline, the
construction workers were everywhere, and
we saw them coming in and out like ants,"
Miller said.
"They set up a CIP hotline because there
were a lot of issues coming up because it was
so hasty toward the end of renovations,"
said Andy Hiller 'll, the RA in Storey.
Hiller said that over the weekend, there
was no running cold water. Wireless Inter
net was not installed until Monday evening,
and no one can enter the kitchen until it
passes a county health inspection this
Wednesday.
Although residents will not begin mov
ing into their freshly painted rooms until
this Thursday, the renovations had an im
pact on more intangible things, like staff
bonding.
"It's been a bit odd," said Hiller, who has
worked as a summer RA for the past three
years. "I sort of had expectations of what
staff training would be like, and for me,
that's staff bonding. The renovations made
it difficult, because we've been a little bit
scattered. We were in Xanadu long past
when other RAs moved out, and it felt very
temporary. We didn't really have a home."
"There were some obstacles to actually
being with my staff and getting to know
them," he added. "We didn't get working to
theme or decorations until Friday."

The interior phase of capital improvement projects at Bob, Casa Italiana and Storey on Mayfield
Avenue is nearly finished, but residents arrive this week to continuing exterior work.
When asked about the potential ef
fects of construction on staffers, Row
Associate Dean Nate Boswell de
clined to comment.
Miller said that permits were re
quired before houses could be inhabit
ed, thus delaying staffers' move-in
dates.
"There was not much [Housing]
could do; they needed to get permits to
move everyone into the house," he
said."'lt's pretty cool that they could get
everyone in at the time that they did."
Hiller agreed, saying, "It was obvi
ous that [Storey] needed to be reno
vated."
Whitney said now that interior
work is done, landscaping can come
next. In the meantime, fences surround
the perimeters of the three Row hous
es, but the houses are still accessible.

"Hie new landscaping plan, once it
is fully implemented, will make for a
wonderful outdoor living space
around and between the houses,"
Whitney said. "Bob and La Casa Ital
iana are now directly connected with
walkways. The area between the hous
es will become a park-like shared
courtyard, with trees, benches, a bas
ketball court and grass volleyball
area."
Hiller said his staff would address
issues as they arise when residents
begin moving in on Thursday, but
overall was happy with the improve
ments.
"We're making it work, and we're
optimistic that we'll have everything
ready to go on our end by the time the
residents move in on Thursday," he
said, although his theme suggestion of
"freshest house on campus" Storey
still smells of fresh paint was nixed
by his staffers immediately.
