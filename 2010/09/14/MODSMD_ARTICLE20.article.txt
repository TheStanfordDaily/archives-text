## REMOTE NOMAD: TV 2010

Whether you like it or not, whether
you remember how to write or not,
whether you got enough GTL this
summer or not (there had to be a TV refer
ence in there somewhere), the time has come
to return to the sandstone arcades of Stan
ford University. To my returning readers, I
hope you enjoyed a summer of intern days
and Katy Perry nights. To incoming fresh
men, put down this paper right now and go
make friends! Or better yet, take it over to a
friend and discuss the merits of my passion
ately held opinions about the defining art
form of our generation: television.
Just last week, A.O. Scott, the illustrious
and orgasmically gifted New York Times film
critic, asked, "Are Films Bad, or Is TV Just
Better?" He invokes "Mad Men," "Lost,"
"The Wire," "Modern Family" and even
"Glee" in his exploration of how television is
surpassing feature film in originality, pop
ularity and diversity. In my two years at Stan
ford, TV shows have proven much more of a
common denominator than movies, as young
viewers have overcome the medium's seem
ing incompatibility with the college lifestyle
and flocked to cable's technological alterna

tives.
I believe that the current crop of TV
shows is vastly superior to any movie in re
cent memory (save "Toy Story 3," perhaps).
Even Hollywood seems to recognize this, as
more and more film production companies
seek to add television programs to their cred
its. This fall, the augmentation of television's
reputation for excellence and profitability
has mixed implications. This fall's new offer
ings are nowhere near as strong as last year's,
but they'll whet your appetite and work in
favor of new cable shows slated for later in
the year.
Based on my research, the following rep
resent both the best and most emblematic
shows for the fall season. Ditch your first
week homework and tune into as many new
shows as you can television shows, more
than any other popular art form, have a ten
dency to surprise you.
FX and the CW rolled out their fall line
ups last week, with critics lavishing the for
mer and PR the latter. The return of Emmy
snub "Sons of Anarchy" segued into the se
ries premiere of "Terriers" (FX, Wednesdays
at 10), an unconventional and irreverent

buddy cop show (puppies are, unfortunately,
not a central focus). It features the ever-hilar
ious Donal Logue in a well-matched pairing
of unlicensed private eyes. If the show is over
all a little low budget and simple, I don't
mind, because it defies gender in its humor.
The CW is serving up its traditional teen
fare. Nothing as subversive and shocking as
the early "Gossip Girl" seasons or even the
latter half of "Vampire Diaries," but how can
you not enjoy the pubescent bodies on dis
play in "Hellcats" or the even greater
achievement of 31-year-old Maggie Q's body
in "Nikita?" "Hellcats" (Wednesdays at 9)
seems more likely to work its way into my ro
tation, as my Thursday night dance card is al
ready booked. The show, featuring Disney
castoffs Aly Michalka and Ashley Tisdale, is
reminiscent of "Greek" and a thorn-less
"Bring It On." Just as "Glee" integrated
music into scripted television, I will be in
trigued to see if "Hellcats" can incorporate
choreography in a similar fashion.
But the heavy-hitters of the 2010-2011 tel
evision season will come from cable, specifi-

Texas gets soapy with Fox's "Lone Star," about a con
man balancing a double life (Mondays at 9, premier
Sept. 20).
