## REMOTE NOMAD: TV 2010 
### – liz STARK contact liz: estark12@stanford. edu 
Whether you like it or not, whether
you remember how to write or not,
whether you got enough GTL this
summer or not (there had to be a TV refer
ence in there somewhere), the time has come
to return to the sandstone arcades of Stan
ford University. To my returning readers, I
hope you enjoyed a summer of intern days
and Katy Perry nights. To incoming fresh
men, put down this paper right now and go
make friends! Or better yet, take it over to a
friend and discuss the merits of my passion
ately held opinions about the defining art
form of our generation: television.
Just last week, A.O. Scott, the illustrious
and orgasmically gifted New York Times film
critic, asked, "Are Films Bad, or Is TV Just
Better?" He invokes "Mad Men," "Lost,"
"The Wire," "Modern Family" and even
"Glee" in his exploration of how television is
surpassing feature film in originality, pop
ularity and diversity. In my two years at Stan
ford, TV shows have proven much more of a
common denominator than movies, as young
viewers have overcome the medium's seem
ing incompatibility with the college lifestyle
and flocked to cable's technological alterna

tives.
I believe that the current crop of TV
shows is vastly superior to any movie in re
cent memory (save "Toy Story 3," perhaps).
Even Hollywood seems to recognize this, as
more and more film production companies
seek to add television programs to their cred
its. This fall, the augmentation of television's
reputation for excellence and profitability
has mixed implications. This fall's new offer
ings are nowhere near as strong as last year's,
but they'll whet your appetite and work in
favor of new cable shows slated for later in
the year.
Based on my research, the following rep
resent both the best and most emblematic
shows for the fall season. Ditch your first
week homework and tune into as many new
shows as you can television shows, more
than any other popular art form, have a ten
dency to surprise you.
FX and the CW rolled out their fall line
ups last week, with critics lavishing the for
mer and PR the latter. The return of Emmy
snub "Sons of Anarchy" segued into the se
ries premiere of "Terriers" (FX, Wednesdays
at 10), an unconventional and irreverent

buddy cop show (puppies are, unfortunately,
not a central focus). It features the ever-hilar
ious Donal Logue in a well-matched pairing
of unlicensed private eyes. If the show is over
all a little low budget and simple, I don't
mind, because it defies gender in its humor.
The CW is serving up its traditional teen
fare. Nothing as subversive and shocking as
the early "Gossip Girl" seasons or even the
latter half of "Vampire Diaries," but how can
you not enjoy the pubescent bodies on dis
play in "Hellcats" or the even greater
achievement of 31-year-old Maggie Q's body
in "Nikita?" "Hellcats" (Wednesdays at 9)
seems more likely to work its way into my ro
tation, as my Thursday night dance card is al
ready booked. The show, featuring Disney
castoffs Aly Michalka and Ashley Tisdale, is
reminiscent of "Greek" and a thorn-less
"Bring It On." Just as "Glee" integrated
music into scripted television, I will be in
trigued to see if "Hellcats" can incorporate
choreography in a similar fashion.
But the heavy-hitters of the 2010-2011 tel
evision season will come from cable, specifi-

cally HBO as it tries to reclaim the
title of best drama from three-time
award winner "Mad Men." "Board
walk Empire" (HBO, Sundays at 9,
premiere September 19) not only
marks the return of Terence Winter,
David Simon's protege on "The So
pranos," but also highlights the hy
bridization of television and film with
Martin Scorsese's role as producer
and director. The boardwalk in ques
tion is Prohibition Era Atlantic City,
and the empire reaches all the way to
Chicago and historical figures such as
A1 Capone. Steve Buscemi of
"Fargo" fame anchors an ensemble
cast as gangster Nucky Thompson,
who presides over the usual HBO de
bauchery: sex, violence and moon
shine. Though the series has been
kept tightly under wraps, those who
have seen the first few episodes re
port that, even though Scorsese di
rects the pilot only, subsequent direc
tors emulate his style. The pilot
episode cost a whopping $lB million,
but I'm confident viewers will get the
bang for HBO's buck. (It's worth not
ing that HBO has some particularly
exciting new projects on the horizon
"Luck" with Dustin Hoffman,
"Tilda" with Diane Keaton, a female
comedy with Lizzy Caplan, a show
about a Broadway family, among
others. Mom, you know what I want
for Christmas now).

Where season three of "True
Blood" seemingly reached the limits
of the vampire genre and 1 IBO's tol
erance, AMC will try to reclaim the
paranormal genre this fall with
"Walking Dead" (AMC, Sundays at
10, premiere October 31). The series
centers on a southern town following
a blood-thirsty zombie apocalypse (I
doubt there will be any fraternization
with the enemy). The preview sug
gests that its style will be simultane
ously muted and allegoric a la
"Breaking Bad," while more conven
tionally grotesque and artistic. I'll be
intrigued to see how the plot unfolds,
but those who like pretty TV will

surely be pleased.
Meanwhile, the networks have in
vested in addictive dramas to succeed
"Lost." NBC is the most flagrant in
this effort with "The Event" (Mon
days at 9, premiere September 20),
whose pilot was well received at
Comic-Con in July. The show inter
weaves many likable characters, in
cluding the congenial Blair Under
wood as President of the United
States, around a secret government
detainment program. The structure
of the pilot is strong, but it remains to
be seen if the mythology is fully de
veloped.
Fox is heavily promoting "Lone
Star" (Mondays at 9, premiere Sep
tember 20), a soapy drama about a
Texas con man, artfully portrayed by
James Wolk. The con relies on the
character's double life as the son-in
law of a Texas oil magnate in Hous
ton and a salesman (with a different
girlfriend) who sells bad investments
to constituents in the Midland. The
show's creator, Kyle Killen, wrote the
script for "The Beaver," which was
named as one of the best feature
scripts of 2008, so the writing for the
pilot is strong as expected. I question
the ability of the sudsy premise to
support the show beyond its fresh
man season (remember "The OC?").
The new arrival I'm most looking
forward to is "My Generation"
(ABC,Thursdays at 8, premiere Sep
tember 23), which does justice to the
now übiquitous single-camera style
as it fictionalizes a documentary
about the high school class of 2000. In
present day 2010, the students return
to their Texas hometown and must
confront how they have surpassed or
failed to live up to their high school
reputations.The themes and relation
ships established in the pilot resonat
ed with me as a child of the new mil
lennium; I hope the series will be able
to redefine high school stereotypes in
a similar way.
Comedy is the weakest genre of
the bunch, especially in comparison
to last year's convention-defying
"Modern Family," "Community,"
"Cougar Town" and "Glee." William
Shatner returns to television as the
star of "s#*! My Dad Says" (CBS,
Thursdays at 8:30, premiere Septem

ber 23), but the quippiness of the
eponymous Twitter feed feels too
self-conscious and sitcom-punchline
esque, even in the previews. The pilot
has been reshot since May upfronts,
but I sense the buzz has worn off and
the final product will underwhelm.
The wildcard of the comedy sea
son will surely be "Outsourced"
(NBC, Thursdays at 9:30, premiere
September 23). I'm biased against it,
as it pushed back the third season
premiere of the outstanding "Parks
and Recreation" and Ron EFFING
Swanson,but my friends assure me to
give this show a chance after its re
tooling. The white male lead, a total
newbie in Ben Rappaport, works at a
call center in India and navigates the

cultural differences it will be up to
audiences to determine if the show
handles them humorously or offen
sively. The previews seem mostly
harmless, though certainly unworthy
of unseating Amy Poehler.
It's going to be an interesting fall.
The new arrivals have a lot to prove,
especially when they have to com
pete against the buzz of the returners.
Regardless, you can find me pushing
the limits of Stanford's bandwith as I
try to download all the pilots simulta
neously; nothing comes between me
and my TV.

Sept. 20).
cally HBO as it tries to reclaim the
title of best drama from three-time
award winner "Mad Men." "Board
walk Empire" (HBO, Sundays at 9,
premiere September 19) not only
marks the return of Terence Winter,
David Simon's protege on "The So
pranos," but also highlights the hy
bridization of television and film with
Martin Scorsese's role as producer
and director. The boardwalk in ques
tion is Prohibition Era Atlantic City,
and the empire reaches all the way to
Chicago and historical figures such as
A1 Capone. Steve Buscemi of
"Fargo" fame anchors an ensemble
cast as gangster Nucky Thompson,
who presides over the usual HBO de
bauchery: sex, violence and moon
shine. Though the series has been
kept tightly under wraps, those who
have seen the first few episodes re
port that, even though Scorsese di
rects the pilot only, subsequent direc
tors emulate his style. The pilot
episode cost a whopping $lB million,
but I'm confident viewers will get the
bang for HBO's buck. (It's worth not
ing that HBO has some particularly
exciting new projects on the horizon
"Luck" with Dustin Hoffman,
"Tilda" with Diane Keaton, a female
comedy with Lizzy Caplan, a show
about a Broadway family, among
others. Mom, you know what I want
for Christmas now).

Where season three of "True
Blood" seemingly reached the limits
of the vampire genre and 1 IBO's tol
erance, AMC will try to reclaim the
paranormal genre this fall with
"Walking Dead" (AMC, Sundays at
10, premiere October 31). The series
centers on a southern town following
a blood-thirsty zombie apocalypse (I
doubt there will be any fraternization
with the enemy). The preview sug
gests that its style will be simultane
ously muted and allegoric a la
"Breaking Bad," while more conven
tionally grotesque and artistic. I'll be
intrigued to see how the plot unfolds,
but those who like pretty TV will

surely be pleased.
Meanwhile, the networks have in
vested in addictive dramas to succeed
"Lost." NBC is the most flagrant in
this effort with "The Event" (Mon
days at 9, premiere September 20),
whose pilot was well received at
Comic-Con in July. The show inter
weaves many likable characters, in
cluding the congenial Blair Under
wood as President of the United
States, around a secret government
detainment program. The structure
of the pilot is strong, but it remains to
be seen if the mythology is fully de
veloped.
Fox is heavily promoting "Lone
Star" (Mondays at 9, premiere Sep
tember 20), a soapy drama about a
Texas con man, artfully portrayed by
James Wolk. The con relies on the
character's double life as the son-in
law of a Texas oil magnate in Hous
ton and a salesman (with a different
girlfriend) who sells bad investments
to constituents in the Midland. The
show's creator, Kyle Killen, wrote the
script for "The Beaver," which was
named as one of the best feature
scripts of 2008, so the writing for the
pilot is strong as expected. I question
the ability of the sudsy premise to
support the show beyond its fresh
man season (remember "The OC?").
The new arrival I'm most looking
forward to is "My Generation"
(ABC,Thursdays at 8, premiere Sep
tember 23), which does justice to the
now übiquitous single-camera style
as it fictionalizes a documentary
about the high school class of 2000. In
present day 2010, the students return
to their Texas hometown and must
confront how they have surpassed or
failed to live up to their high school
reputations.The themes and relation
ships established in the pilot resonat
ed with me as a child of the new mil
lennium; I hope the series will be able
to redefine high school stereotypes in
a similar way.
Comedy is the weakest genre of
the bunch, especially in comparison
to last year's convention-defying
"Modern Family," "Community,"
"Cougar Town" and "Glee." William
Shatner returns to television as the
star of "s#*! My Dad Says" (CBS,
Thursdays at 8:30, premiere Septem

ber 23), but the quippiness of the
eponymous Twitter feed feels too
self-conscious and sitcom-punchline
esque, even in the previews. The pilot
has been reshot since May upfronts,
but I sense the buzz has worn off and
the final product will underwhelm.
The wildcard of the comedy sea
son will surely be "Outsourced"
(NBC, Thursdays at 9:30, premiere
September 23). I'm biased against it,
as it pushed back the third season
premiere of the outstanding "Parks
and Recreation" and Ron EFFING
Swanson,but my friends assure me to
give this show a chance after its re
tooling. The white male lead, a total
newbie in Ben Rappaport, works at a
call center in India and navigates the

cultural differences it will be up to
audiences to determine if the show
handles them humorously or offen
sively. The previews seem mostly
harmless, though certainly unworthy
of unseating Amy Poehler.
It's going to be an interesting fall.
The new arrivals have a lot to prove,
especially when they have to com
pete against the buzz of the returners.
Regardless, you can find me pushing
the limits of Stanford's bandwith as I
try to download all the pilots simulta
neously; nothing comes between me
and my TV.
Whether you like it or not, whether
you remember how to write or not,
whether you got enough GTL this
summer or not (there had to be a TV refer
ence in there somewhere), the time has come
to return to the sandstone arcades of Stan
ford University. To my returning readers, I
hope you enjoyed a summer of intern days
and Katy Perry nights. To incoming fresh
men, put down this paper right now and go
make friends! Or better yet, take it over to a
friend and discuss the merits of my passion
ately held opinions about the defining art
form of our generation: television.
Just last week, A.O. Scott, the illustrious
and orgasmically gifted New York Times film
critic, asked, "Are Films Bad, or Is TV Just
Better?" He invokes "Mad Men," "Lost,"
"The Wire," "Modern Family" and even
"Glee" in his exploration of how television is
surpassing feature film in originality, pop
ularity and diversity. In my two years at Stan
ford, TV shows have proven much more of a
common denominator than movies, as young
viewers have overcome the medium's seem
ing incompatibility with the college lifestyle
and flocked to cable's technological alterna

tives.
I believe that the current crop of TV
shows is vastly superior to any movie in re
cent memory (save "Toy Story 3," perhaps).
Even Hollywood seems to recognize this, as
more and more film production companies
seek to add television programs to their cred
its. This fall, the augmentation of television's
reputation for excellence and profitability
has mixed implications. This fall's new offer
ings are nowhere near as strong as last year's,
but they'll whet your appetite and work in
favor of new cable shows slated for later in
the year.
Based on my research, the following rep
resent both the best and most emblematic
shows for the fall season. Ditch your first
week homework and tune into as many new
shows as you can television shows, more
than any other popular art form, have a ten
dency to surprise you.
FX and the CW rolled out their fall line
ups last week, with critics lavishing the for
mer and PR the latter. The return of Emmy
snub "Sons of Anarchy" segued into the se
ries premiere of "Terriers" (FX, Wednesdays
at 10), an unconventional and irreverent

buddy cop show (puppies are, unfortunately,
not a central focus). It features the ever-hilar
ious Donal Logue in a well-matched pairing
of unlicensed private eyes. If the show is over
all a little low budget and simple, I don't
mind, because it defies gender in its humor.
The CW is serving up its traditional teen
fare. Nothing as subversive and shocking as
the early "Gossip Girl" seasons or even the
latter half of "Vampire Diaries," but how can
you not enjoy the pubescent bodies on dis
play in "Hellcats" or the even greater
achievement of 31-year-old Maggie Q's body
in "Nikita?" "Hellcats" (Wednesdays at 9)
seems more likely to work its way into my ro
tation, as my Thursday night dance card is al
ready booked. The show, featuring Disney
castoffs Aly Michalka and Ashley Tisdale, is
reminiscent of "Greek" and a thorn-less
"Bring It On." Just as "Glee" integrated
music into scripted television, I will be in
trigued to see if "Hellcats" can incorporate
choreography in a similar fashion.
But the heavy-hitters of the 2010-2011 tel
evision season will come from cable, specifi-
