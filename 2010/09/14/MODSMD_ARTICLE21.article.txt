At this point, you are pretty much guar
anteed some form of outrageous scan
dal at MTV's Video Music Awards.
Just look at some events from the past: Diana
Ross grabbing Lil' Kim's boob, Madonna and
Britney's girl-on-girl smooch and, of course,
last year's Kanye-gate. With that in mind,
2010's edition was a tedious letdown. The
MTV gods ought to be glad for Kanye West
because their bland production had little
more to run on than the fumes of last year
through its three-hour-plus runtime.
The preshow was fairly entertaining, if only
because we learned Kesha's mini dress was
self-made out of garbage bags which, com
bined with her ratty Rapunzel braid and what
appeared to be some sort of dead creature
wrapped around her neck, reassured her spot
as the reigning mess of all things drunk and
trashy. Lady Gaga brought class to the white
carpet flanked with four discharged members
of U.S. Armed Forces to speak out against
"Don't Ask, Don't Tell" policies, reminding
audiences that "No one person is more valu
able than another person."
Eminem kicked off the night with "Not
Afraid" which segued into "Love the Way You
Lie." The latter featured a surprise perform
ance from Rihanna who seemed to be chan
neling Carrie from "Sex and the City" in a long
white tutu and bedazzled headband. Howev
er, the hands down best showing of the night
was from English alternative artist Florence
and the Machine with a rendition of "Dog
Days Are Over."The performance was majes
tic in every sense of the word, from the trippy,
Hindi-inspired blue women writhing on the
floor to Florence Welch's impeccable vocals.
Unfortunately, the high from her perform
ance was quickly extinguished by an uncom
fortable, out-of-place transition to Travie
McCoy with "Billionaire."
But what everyone was really waiting for
was the musical showdown between Taylor
Swift and Kanye West. Swift, dolled up with a
new Grace Kelly 'do, went first, debuting a
melodramatic ditty she had previously written
on the whole debacle. Unless you paid close
attention, the vague lyrics made it hard to tell
whether or not Swift was really forgiving West.
However, key phrases like "32, still growing up
now" and "today is never too late to be brand
new" indicate that she probably has absolved
him of his past transgression. As the much-bal
lyhooed closer of the show. West similarly in
troduced a new song "Runaway." Where Swift
lyrically beat around the bush, West cut right
to the point, exposing his vulnerability and re
gret while throwing in choice words like
"scumbag" and "jerk-off" While he may have
fallen from grace last year, West has miracu
lously secured his big comeback check the
loud "Kanye!" chants at the end of his per
formance.

A couple of side notes "Modern Fami
ly's" Sofia Vergara has got to be one of the
most likable people on the planet. Even
though it was hard to understand her through
the thick Colombian accent, she still got
laughs with her sassy charm. Also, props to
Jane Lynch for channeling both Sue Sylvester
and her inner glamazon with that floor-length
track jacket. And way to go MTV for making
Twitter more irritating than it already is with
those constant "look what's trending!" bits
scattered throughout the telecast.
The plodding telecast wasn't helped by the
disappointment that was host Chelsea Han
dler, the comedienne of E! 's "Chelsea Lately."
