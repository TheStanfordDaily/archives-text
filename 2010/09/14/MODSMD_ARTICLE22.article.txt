## Nostalgic Bumbershoot impresses again 
### â€“ marisa LANDICHO 
Entering its 40th year, Seattle's Bumber
shoot music festival trotted out nostal
gia-inducing heavy-hitters to draw in the
crowds over Labor Day Weekend. It was a
move that worked: bullfrog Bob Dylan sold
out the main stage before the festival even
started, and to gawkers' delight, Courtney
Love the rock star, not Courtney Love the
zombie-drug-marionette, showed up for the
'Shoot not to mention a Weezer spectacle
that will go down in festival lore.
Yes, old and new problems still dogged the
festival, from a will call pick-up system de
signed by FEMA, which had crowds antsy
even before the first guitar was strummed, to a
pervasive rain haze on Monday. And it seems
four decades isn't long enough for engineers
to rig up a consistent sound system for the
Memorial Stadium Mainstage (perhaps they
were all busy at the neighboring Penny Ar
cade Expo this weekend).
But on the festival's last night, the wind
breaker-sporting crowds still boogied down to
put Gene Kelly to shame. Overall, Bumber
shoot's 40th iteration had its bizarre highs, and
we'll definitely be there for 41.
Saturday
The dusky chops of Americana Star Anna

& the Laughing Dogs were an alt-country
blast in the early afternoon. Blistering through
heartache, Star Anna had the older crowd
nodding, then getting their dance on, as her full
voice cracked over the notes. The highlight,
though, came when Pearl Jam's guitarist Mike
McCready, a longtime supporter of the band,
shredded across the stage in a not-so-secret
guest appearance. Rock on.
Longtime folk-pop heroes The Decem
berists drew a sizable crowd in their own right
for one of their rare shows this summer, play
ing the same main stage they've rocked be
fore. But the band that has sparked thousands
of soul-gazing imitators was off that day, de
spite the familiar outfit's comfortable stage
presence.The band gave their best live render
ings of upbeat "The Engine Driver" and "16
Military Wives," but the mood was premature
ly killed by an instrumental bass monster that
was the first victim to the dirge-like acoustics.
An exodus before the show's end must've
thrown off the band, who cut the set short by
15 minutes with no calls for an encore.
For those with the less-snazzy Economy
Ticket, Texan Bob Schneider threw a funk
folk dance-a-thon like no other at the Star
bucks Stage. The bluegrass veteran command-

Ed the stage with his aviator cool and scraggly
vocals, but it was keyboardist-guitarist Oliver
Steck that dazzled on stage with both musical
talent and some suave spazzing.
With the most impressive pipes of the
night, redheaded Neko Case, the voice behind
The New Pornographers, gave the couples
something to cuddle over back on the Main
stage. Befittingly, as the sun set, her sensual,
throaty melodies off "Middle Cyclone" rico
cheted off the upper rafters as a warm blanket
of romance, further heightened by some
raunchy between-song banter.
For people wondering where all the crowds
were on Saturday, they had to look no further
than the stockyard-packed Broad Street Stage
for Edward Sharpe & the Magnetic Zeroes.
Even the stage looked crowded for the cara
van of performers that make up the L. A. band,
and their spectacle of a performance showed
that singer Alex Ebert and crew were robbed
of a headlining spot.
And then there was Bob Dylan. Pushing
70, he sounded like an anti-nicotine commer
cial, his tenor register was blown out by his
backing band and the stadium could have used
some video screens. But he's still the Bob
Dylan, one of the greatest songwriters (if not

the greatest) of all time, and the crowds duly
sung along to "Just Like A Woman," the older
members off remembering previous shows
and the younger set glued to their digital cam
era video setting. Dylan, busting out his trusty
harmonica, transported the stadium to earlier
times. We'll let the old man sing.
Sunday
People streamed toward the Broad Street
Stage early for Seattle seven-piece orchestral
pop group Hey Marseilles. Favoring a waltz
beat, breaking into joyous handclaps and play
ing hot potato with their quirky collection of
instruments, the band moved the crowd with
their lush layers and grinning sincerity. The al
ready Quidditch team-sized band then added
four more members to the stage for closing fa
vorite "Rio," getting the whole crowd clapping
and shouting as they held aloft two marching
band bass drums to beat out the last hits of the
whimsical single.
Bringing a tougher energy to the new Cen
ter Square Stage, guitarless rock band Crash
Kings almost tore the Space Needle down
with their pulsating performance. Launching
the most crowd-surfing set of the day, the L. A.

trio rocked some serious stadium
ready anthems, anchored by the sweet
keyboard melodies by fedora-ed
singer Tony Beliveau.
The photogenic indie-darlings Ra
Ra Riot brought the strings back to
the Broad Street Stage with a rousing
set that combined material from both
their debut "The Rhumb Line" and
their new album "The Orchard," re
leased in August. From opener "St.
Peter's Day Festival" to bouncing fin
ish "Dying is Fine," the band was on
point with their string arrangements
and harmonies, only disturbed by the
bass drum pedal breaking during "Oh,
La."

The most danceable performance
of the day, however, belongs to Ra Ra
Riot follow-up Delorean, straight off
the plane after playing L.A.'s FYFest
the day before. While the crowd was
surprisingly thin for the techno-root
ed Barcelona band (they were up
against the hometown charmer
Courtney Love), Ekhi Lopetegi et al.
kept their stomping energy up
through the knob-turning, electronic
delirium that was heightened by the
well-executed instrumental. The first
crowd-surfers went up at the machine
gun start of "Warmer Places" and did

n't let up for the rest of the hour, all
destined to end up in the arms of the
grinning security guard.
Sunday night, high-schoolers
headed to Fisher Green for a shot,
shot, shot, shot, shot of hip-hop duo
LMFAO. The sparkly rapper pair
took to the stage late due to "crowd
problems" and enjoyed a highly ex
pectant (and just plain high) packed
in audience, who ate up the aptly-ti
tled entrance "Get Crazy."The set just
went downhill, though, as LMFAO
covered the Black Eyed Peas' "Boom
Boom Pow," and it became clear the
crowd wasn't old enough to get some
more Coronas.

We learned a few things from the
show-stopping closeout show by
Weezer: 1) Rivers Cuomo is one spry,
speed-walking champ, 2) Lady Gaga
has truly infiltrated everything and 3)
a full head of hair is unnecessary to
rock the hell out. It was the 30-minute
encore, however, that shot the set into
the Bumbershoot stratosphere,
though it's hard to pinpoint exactly
when the crowd's "Oh my god"s went
viral possibly when Weezer erupt
ed into a cover of MGMT's "Kids,"
segueing into "Poker Face" as Cuomo
donned a blond wig a la Lady Gaga.
Or maybe when Cuomo was star
jumping on stage and dry-humping a
giant beach ball, as the band shredded
through classic "Buddy Holly." All
that's certain is that by the time the en
tire band jumped onto the drumkit for

the finale, the collective hive mind was
blown.

Monday
Attendees escaped the afternoon
sprinkles for Seattle charmer BOAT'S
bass-ringing set inside the EMP's Sky
Church. Joking about the inadequacy
of the free mini-sodas and the light
show behind them, the BOAT dudes
doubled as stand-up comics. "God,
they're really not going to have us
back next year... shit," said guitarist
J. Goodman before they launched into
a song about lobsters and snakes. But
their irreverent rock showed the fun
nymen earned their placement at this
year's 'Shoot, particularly on "Prince
of Tacoma" and cymbal-tapping
"Lately."
Indie-loving Seattleites couldn't
resist the Jenny & Johnny lovechild,
rain be darned. The pair quaintly
brought their sugarcoated "I'm Hav
ing Fun Now" to life, but their hour
long goo-goo eyes at each other made
me crave some genuine Rilo Kiley
angst. Particularly since Rilo Kiley vet
Jenny Lewis carried the set with riot
grrrlish coos and growls, making real
life boyfriend Jonathan Rice a bit ir
relevant.
Rapper-singer Drake was Bum
bershoot's attempt at being trendy
and the demographic (read: teenage
girls) loved his headlining show, if the
high-pitched screams were anything
to go by. While the crowd engaged in a
karaoke playback of literally every

song on the set list, Drake kept to rap
ping, letting his backing vocals sing the
chorus. It's a shame that the echoing
drums fuzzed him out, since the boy is
equipped with one smooth voice.
Florida's Surfer Blood had to con
tend with cold sideways rain-mist dur
ing their evening slot, pushing beach
washed rock in the last place you
would ever describe as summery. The
young band was frazzled by the break
ing of their drum pedal early on, which
they negotiated with less aplomb than
Ra Ra Riot the day before, ironically
on the exact same stage. But the band
recovered and baby-faced frontman
J.P. Pitts was proudly strutting the
stage edge by undeniable anthem
"Swim" at show's end.
The dedicated waited out the wors
ening rains for Portland's The Ther
mals, whose punk intensity and singa
long choruses gave one last chance to
jubilantly mosh the tension away be
fore real life resumed. The insistent
bass of Kathy Foster best met Hutch
Harris' clarion cries in oldies "We
Were Sick" and "Returning to the
Fold," while the new fodder off album
"Personal Life" kept the pit surging.
Foster also had the most rockstar f
you of the weekend: after the requisite
dick in the audience called for "Free
bird," Foster nonchalantly held up her
middle finger with a droll, "Here's
your free bird right here."Touche.
