## Nostalgic Bumbershoot impresses again 
### â€“ marisa LANDICHO 
Entering its 40th year, Seattle's Bumber
shoot music festival trotted out nostal
gia-inducing heavy-hitters to draw in the
crowds over Labor Day Weekend. It was a
move that worked: bullfrog Bob Dylan sold
out the main stage before the festival even
started, and to gawkers' delight, Courtney
Love the rock star, not Courtney Love the
zombie-drug-marionette, showed up for the
'Shoot not to mention a Weezer spectacle
that will go down in festival lore.
Yes, old and new problems still dogged the
festival, from a will call pick-up system de
signed by FEMA, which had crowds antsy
even before the first guitar was strummed, to a
pervasive rain haze on Monday. And it seems
four decades isn't long enough for engineers
to rig up a consistent sound system for the
Memorial Stadium Mainstage (perhaps they
were all busy at the neighboring Penny Ar
cade Expo this weekend).
But on the festival's last night, the wind
breaker-sporting crowds still boogied down to
put Gene Kelly to shame. Overall, Bumber
shoot's 40th iteration had its bizarre highs, and
we'll definitely be there for 41.
Saturday
The dusky chops of Americana Star Anna

& the Laughing Dogs were an alt-country
blast in the early afternoon. Blistering through
heartache, Star Anna had the older crowd
nodding, then getting their dance on, as her full
voice cracked over the notes. The highlight,
though, came when Pearl Jam's guitarist Mike
McCready, a longtime supporter of the band,
shredded across the stage in a not-so-secret
guest appearance. Rock on.
Longtime folk-pop heroes The Decem
berists drew a sizable crowd in their own right
for one of their rare shows this summer, play
ing the same main stage they've rocked be
fore. But the band that has sparked thousands
of soul-gazing imitators was off that day, de
spite the familiar outfit's comfortable stage
presence.The band gave their best live render
ings of upbeat "The Engine Driver" and "16
Military Wives," but the mood was premature
ly killed by an instrumental bass monster that
was the first victim to the dirge-like acoustics.
An exodus before the show's end must've
thrown off the band, who cut the set short by
15 minutes with no calls for an encore.
For those with the less-snazzy Economy
Ticket, Texan Bob Schneider threw a funk
folk dance-a-thon like no other at the Star
bucks Stage. The bluegrass veteran command-

Ed the stage with his aviator cool and scraggly
vocals, but it was keyboardist-guitarist Oliver
Steck that dazzled on stage with both musical
talent and some suave spazzing.
With the most impressive pipes of the
night, redheaded Neko Case, the voice behind
The New Pornographers, gave the couples
something to cuddle over back on the Main
stage. Befittingly, as the sun set, her sensual,
throaty melodies off "Middle Cyclone" rico
cheted off the upper rafters as a warm blanket
of romance, further heightened by some
raunchy between-song banter.
For people wondering where all the crowds
were on Saturday, they had to look no further
than the stockyard-packed Broad Street Stage
for Edward Sharpe & the Magnetic Zeroes.
Even the stage looked crowded for the cara
van of performers that make up the L. A. band,
and their spectacle of a performance showed
that singer Alex Ebert and crew were robbed
of a headlining spot.
And then there was Bob Dylan. Pushing
70, he sounded like an anti-nicotine commer
cial, his tenor register was blown out by his
backing band and the stadium could have used
some video screens. But he's still the Bob
Dylan, one of the greatest songwriters (if not

the greatest) of all time, and the crowds duly
sung along to "Just Like A Woman," the older
members off remembering previous shows
and the younger set glued to their digital cam
era video setting. Dylan, busting out his trusty
harmonica, transported the stadium to earlier
times. We'll let the old man sing.
Sunday
People streamed toward the Broad Street
Stage early for Seattle seven-piece orchestral
pop group Hey Marseilles. Favoring a waltz
beat, breaking into joyous handclaps and play
ing hot potato with their quirky collection of
instruments, the band moved the crowd with
their lush layers and grinning sincerity. The al
ready Quidditch team-sized band then added
four more members to the stage for closing fa
vorite "Rio," getting the whole crowd clapping
and shouting as they held aloft two marching
band bass drums to beat out the last hits of the
whimsical single.
Bringing a tougher energy to the new Cen
ter Square Stage, guitarless rock band Crash
Kings almost tore the Space Needle down
with their pulsating performance. Launching
the most crowd-surfing set of the day, the L. A.
