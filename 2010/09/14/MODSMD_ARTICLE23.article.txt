# TOP FIVE SUMMER MOVIES
## 
### 
For those who were broke, comatose or stranded in a
yurt the last three months, here are Intermission's top
five movies from the past summer.

(1) Toy Story 3
The third installment of the beloved series is yet
another flawless combination of humor, adventure
and touching poignancy. Pixar breathed more human
ity into these inanimate objects than any other movie
studio could do with regular actors. Nobody but the
Grinch (or Jane Lynch as Sue Sylvester) could have
left the theater without tearing up a little.

(2) Inception
In a sea of brainless, flashy blockbusters, Christo
pher Nolan does his part to bring well-crafted, bril
liant pieces of film to the masses. His dreamy, mind
bending thriller is no exception. Chalk it up with "Me
mento," "The Prestige" and the new Batman movies
this guy is on a serious streak.
(3) Scott Pilgrim vs. the World
Videogames generally do not transfer to the big
screen very well (see 1993's god-awful "Super Mario
Bros."). So leave it to a film adaptation of a graphic
novel to perfectly incorporate the zany aesthetics of a

videogame from its hyperkinetic "Mortal Kombat"
fight scenes to the pee bar that appears when the titu
lar hero uses the restroom. While the film's box office
receipts left much to be desired, the quirky, surreal
film is destined for cult status.
(4) Salt

After Tom Cruise dropped out of the movie, Co
lumbia Pictures caused waves by changing the lead
character from Edwin Salt to Evelyn Salt and re
cruiting Angelina Jolie to headline the spy thriller.
It's a good thing they did. Jolie's sexy, rogue agent
and the movie's twists and turns made "Salt" the

kind of fun, big-action blockbuster that summer is
all about.
(5) Going the Distance
Sure it's your standard rom-com boy meets
girl, boy almost loses girl but decides to enter a long
distance relationship, hijinks ensue but it's a darn
entertaining one. The movie unapologetically earns
its R rating again and again with hilarious dialogue
and, at times, crude physical comedy. Drew Barry
more, likable as always, carries the film as Erin, an as
piring journalist who leaves New York to attend grad
school at Stanford (!).
