## BRUINS GET BASHED Defense shines, earns road shutout of UCLA 
### KABIR SAWHNEY MANAGING EDITOR 
In a manner befitting a contender for the
Pac-10 title, the No. 19 Stanford football team
pummeled UCLA (0-2,0-1 Pac-10) on Satur
day night, scoring at will in a 35-0 blowout.
While the Cardinal (2-0,1-0) headed to the
Rose Bowl in Pasadena, Calif, with expecta
tions of victory, few expected it to dominate
the Bruins in such a thorough manner.
The first quarter saw the game get off to a
slow start, with three-and-outs from both of
fenses. On Stanford's second drive of the
game, redshirt sophomore quarterback An
drew Luck took over, overwhelming the
UCLA defense with a combination of strong
passes and 10-yard scrambles. He hit senior
receiver Ryan Whalen with a 16-yard touch
down pass to cap the drive, putting Stanford
up 7-0.

After another UCLA three-and-out,
Stanford took the ball and marched down the
field, getting all the way inside the 10-yard
line before incompletions on second and
third down forced the Card to settle for a
Nate Whitaker field goal. The Cardinal offen
sive line lived up to its billing as one of the
best units in the country, opening big holes for
Stanford's running backs and giving Luck
plenty of time to make throws.
After halftime, the two teams came back
onto the field with Stanford holding on to a
13-0 lead. UCLA took the ball to start the half
and appeared ready to make the game a close
contest; its running backs started to find holes
in the Cardinal front seven, and quarterback
Kevin Prince made some key completions to
push the Bruin offense forward. However,
the drive eventually stalled, and a field goal
attempt by Lou Groza Award winner Kai
Forbath sailed wide right.
Stanford took over after the Forbath miss
and again began an efficient drive, dominat
ing the UCLA defense and putting the mo
mentum on the Stanford side for good. Luck
scrambled several times, including for a first
down on third-and-10 early in the possession,
and the Cardinal running back rotation
shredded the Bruin front seven. The clock
eating possession ate up nine minutes and 30
seconds, and ended with senior fullback
Owen Marecic bulldozing his way into the

Stanford's defense came out in force Saturday night against UCLA. Junior linebacker Max Bergen (right, No. 57), playing for the injured Shayne Skov, had three tackles on the night.
end zone for a touchdown. The subsequent
two-point conversion gave Stanford a 21-0
lead, and the Card never looked back.
Stanford's offense built on its perform
ance last week against Sacramento State, es
tablishing itself as a force in the Pac-10. Luck
had a strong game, leading the offense with
11-24 passing and 151 yards through the air,
including two touchdown passes. He also car
ried the ball seven times for 63 yards.
Luck was also able to limit the impact of
Rahim Moore, UCLA's All-America safety
and projected NFL draft pick. Moore made
seven tackles but only deflected one pass.
Luck also stayed error-free, throwing no in
terceptions.
After the game, Luck still saw room for
improvement.
"I did not play my best game by any
means," he said. "I think UCLA had a good
defense. But a win is a win, so we're happy."
Sophomore Stepfan Taylor led the Stan
ford rushing attack with 20 carries for 81
yards. While head coach Jim Harbaugh has
been employing a "running back by commit
tee" approach to replace the production of
graduated senior Toby Gerhart, Taylor has
emerged as the offense's feature back. The
other three backs in use by the Card soph
omore Tyler Gaffney and freshmen Usua
Amanam and Anthony Wilkerson com
bined for 49 yards on 14 carries.
Stanford's offense is also poised to get
even better, as two of its biggest playmakers,
junior wide receiver Chris Owusu and senior
running back Jeremy Stewart, are currently
out due to injury. Stewart sustained an ankle
injury last week against Sacramento State,
while Owusu was listed as questionable with

an undisclosed injury. Both are slated to
make returns in the coming weeks, giving
Luck even more weapons with which to
shred opposing defenses.

The Cardinal defense also answered
many of the questions swirling around it. Last
season, the defense was a weak point, and it
was given an overhaul in the offseason (com
plete with new coordinator Vic Fangio).
In its first test against Pac-10 competi
tion, the unit performed admirably, limiting
UCLA head coach Rick Neuheisel's vaunt
ed "Pistol" offense to just 81 passing yards
and 233 total yards. Quarterback Kevin
Prince was often hurried and frustrated by
the front seven, while the secondary kept a
tight hold on his receivers. Stanford defend
ers also picked up two interceptions and
forced five fumbles, two of which were re
covered.
The star of the defense was junior defen
sive back Michael Thomas. Aside from hav
ing five tackles, Thomas forced two fumbles,
including the highlight of the game when
Thomas ripped the ball from Prince's hands
in the third quarter, running it back 21 yards
for a touchdown. The play came on UCLA's
first snap after the Cardinal's 20-play, 9:30
drive in the third quarter, and effectively
erased any remaining hope for a UCLA vic
tory. After that play, Prince was replaced by
his backup, Richard Brehaut, for the remain
der of the game.
Overall, both the front seven and the sec
ondary had excellent games. The team
notched three sacks, while the team's leading
tackier was junior cornerback Johnson
Bademosi with six.
Unfortunately for Stanford, sophomore

linebacker Shayne Skov did not return to the
field for this game. Like Owusu, Skov was
listed as questionable with an undisclosed in
jury, and is also expected to return in the com
ing weeks. His replacement, junior Max
Bergen, performed well for the second
straight week, making three solo tackles.
Stanford's next game is at home against
Wake Forest on Saturday. The Card will be a
heavy favorite, but the Demon Deacons do
enter the game with a 2-0 record, including a
54-48 win over ACC rival Duke this weekend.
At 53.5 points per game, they also have the
third-best scoring offense in the country
heading into Week 3, which will provide an
other solid test for the new-look Cardinal de
fense.

However, the Wake Forest defense is
highly suspect, giving up 30.5 points per game
up to this point in the season. Stanford's of
fense should be able to put up big numbers
against the Deacons, especially if Owusu and
Stewart are back on the field.

Last season, the two teams met in the sec
ond week of the season on Wake Forest's
campus in Winston-Salem, N.C. Despite an
early Stanford lead, the Deacons came back
to win the game on a touchdown with two
seconds remaining. It was the first meeting
ever between the two schools, and a much
improved Stanford squad will be looking to
exact some revenge this weekend.
The Cardinal will kick off against Wake
Forest on Saturday at 8:15 p.m. The game will
be held at Stanford Stadium and will be tele
vised on ESPN2.
