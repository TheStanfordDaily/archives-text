## BRUINS GET BASHED Defense shines, earns road shutout of UCLA 
### KABIR SAWHNEY MANAGING EDITOR 
In a manner befitting a contender for the
Pac-10 title, the No. 19 Stanford football team
pummeled UCLA (0-2,0-1 Pac-10) on Satur
day night, scoring at will in a 35-0 blowout.
While the Cardinal (2-0,1-0) headed to the
Rose Bowl in Pasadena, Calif, with expecta
tions of victory, few expected it to dominate
the Bruins in such a thorough manner.
The first quarter saw the game get off to a
slow start, with three-and-outs from both of
fenses. On Stanford's second drive of the
game, redshirt sophomore quarterback An
drew Luck took over, overwhelming the
UCLA defense with a combination of strong
passes and 10-yard scrambles. He hit senior
receiver Ryan Whalen with a 16-yard touch
down pass to cap the drive, putting Stanford
up 7-0.

After another UCLA three-and-out,
Stanford took the ball and marched down the
field, getting all the way inside the 10-yard
line before incompletions on second and
third down forced the Card to settle for a
Nate Whitaker field goal. The Cardinal offen
sive line lived up to its billing as one of the
best units in the country, opening big holes for
Stanford's running backs and giving Luck
plenty of time to make throws.
After halftime, the two teams came back
onto the field with Stanford holding on to a
13-0 lead. UCLA took the ball to start the half
and appeared ready to make the game a close
contest; its running backs started to find holes
in the Cardinal front seven, and quarterback
Kevin Prince made some key completions to
push the Bruin offense forward. However,
the drive eventually stalled, and a field goal
attempt by Lou Groza Award winner Kai
Forbath sailed wide right.
Stanford took over after the Forbath miss
and again began an efficient drive, dominat
ing the UCLA defense and putting the mo
mentum on the Stanford side for good. Luck
scrambled several times, including for a first
down on third-and-10 early in the possession,
and the Cardinal running back rotation
shredded the Bruin front seven. The clock
eating possession ate up nine minutes and 30
seconds, and ended with senior fullback
Owen Marecic bulldozing his way into the
