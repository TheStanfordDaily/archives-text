# WOMEN'S SOCCER
## Card wins Nike Invitational, holds No. 2 rank 
### NATE ADAMS DESK EDITOR 
After opening the season with a four-game
road trip against some tough teams on the
East Coast, the No. 2 Stanford women's soccer
team had yet to defeat any opponent by more
than a single goal and had tied two of its
matches in double-overtime. That changed last
weekend in the Cardinal's first homestand, as
Stanford (4-0-2) was both host and victor of
the annual Stanford Nike Invitational. On its
way to victory, last year's national runner-up
defeated No. 23 Georgia 2-1 in overtime on
Friday, then routed Pacific 4-0 two days later.
Friday's win over Georgia (4-2-1) was any
thing but smooth, as the Cardinal fell behind

early and struggled to find an offensive
rhythm. Senior forward Christen Press would
eventually play hero for the Cardinal, scoring
the tying goal and sealing the win in overtime,
but not without a game-long struggle to find
the right rhythm on offense.
After Georgia forward Marah Falle put the
Card down 1-0 in just the 15th minute, Stan
ford head coach Paul Ratcliffe made a lot of
adjustments, eventually using eight players at
forward. Freshman Taylor McCann made her
first start there, but was replaced in the 24th
minute by classmate Sydney Payne,
The Cardinal did manage a respectable 23
shots in the match, but not many of them had
a chance of getting past Georgia goalkeeper
Ashley Baker, who had 11 saves. Ratcliffe

even tried putting starting defenders Court
ney Verloo and Camille Levin at forward to
shake things up. The Stanford coach made
changes on the other side of the ball as well, re
placing senior goalkeeper Kira Maker with
freshman Emily Oliver at halftime.
It took until the 79th minute for Stanford to
beat Baker and tie the game, and even then,
the goal came from an established force on the
Cardinal, Christen Press, and not from one of
the offensive substitutes.
Despite the team's earlier struggles, the
tying goal was a thing of beauty. Press got a
pass from Levin just outside the box, and arced
it just under the crossbar in the far corner of
the goal.
In the 10th minute of overtime, Press took

things into her own hands again to seal the
win. This time, though, the goal felt a bit more
like good luck. The senior forward knocked a
header in front of the goal that hit a Georgia
defender and careened into the net.
"Heading is not my strength," Press said.
"Coaches have been telling me to jump in the
air and get some strength behind it. So, I
jumped up and tried to head it back this way,
and I didn't get enough power, so it went that
way.
"But, you know, I'll take it."
After three weekends of play, the Cardinal
had started a series with a win for the first time.
All three of those games (against Boston Col-
