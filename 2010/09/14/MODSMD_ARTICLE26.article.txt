# SOCCER STARTS WITH BIG SLIDE
## 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH 
The Stanford men's soccer team opened
the season hoping to justify a No. 14 ranking
from the National Soccer Coaches Associa
tion. Four games into the season, the Cardi
nal has already tumbled out of the rankings
with four straight defeats. Of the four
games, just one was against a ranked oppo
nent No. 10 Harvard.
In the home opener on Saturday at Laird
Q. Cagan Stadium, the Cardinal fell 2-1 to a
surprising UNLV squad in overtime. In the
second game of the weekend's Cal Legacy
Classic on Sunday, Sacramento State scored
a game-winning goal with 18 seconds re
maining. This has been a trend for the Card,
as all four losses have come by one goal.
After graduating just four starters, and
with a large incoming class bringing plenty
of new talent to the Farm, the Cardinal was
picked to finish second behind UCLA in
the Pac-10. Senior defender/midfielder
Bobby Warshaw, arguably the team's
strongest player, has been named to almost
every preseason All-America team as well
as the preseason watch list for the MAC
Hermann Trophy, given to the best colle
giate player in the country.
With 19 returning players, the Cardinal
appears to be very talented, but the team

has not been able to break through.
Throughout the game against UNLV,
Stanford seemed confused and unaware.
The Card seemed more skillful on the ball
than its opponents, but was consistently
done in by turnovers at inopportune mo
ments. The initial 1-0 deficit was the result of
a Stanford corner kick that was cleared
away in the 35th minute, and which led to a
quick UNLV counterattack. With the de
fenders on their heels, UNLV strung a few
short passes together, and redshirt fresh
man goalie Jason Dodson was helpless at
close range.
An equalizing goal from junior Taylor
Amman off a shot from junior Garrett Gun
ther gave life to the home team and several
hundred fans in the stands, but another ef
fective UNLV counterattack eight minutes
into overtime left several players lying de
jectedly on their backs in the afternoon sun.
Warshaw, for one, proved to be every bit
the captain that head coach Bret Simon
hoped he would be, barking out commands
and consistently winning and distributing
the ball. The organization among the de
fending quartet of seniors Cameron Lam
ming, Ryan Thomas and Warshaw alongside
junior Tommy Ryan was also generally
