# SOCCER STARTS WITH BIG SLIDE
## 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH 
The Stanford men's soccer team opened
the season hoping to justify a No. 14 ranking
from the National Soccer Coaches Associa
tion. Four games into the season, the Cardi
nal has already tumbled out of the rankings
with four straight defeats. Of the four
games, just one was against a ranked oppo
nent No. 10 Harvard.
In the home opener on Saturday at Laird
Q. Cagan Stadium, the Cardinal fell 2-1 to a
surprising UNLV squad in overtime. In the
second game of the weekend's Cal Legacy
Classic on Sunday, Sacramento State scored
a game-winning goal with 18 seconds re
maining. This has been a trend for the Card,
as all four losses have come by one goal.
After graduating just four starters, and
with a large incoming class bringing plenty
of new talent to the Farm, the Cardinal was
picked to finish second behind UCLA in
the Pac-10. Senior defender/midfielder
Bobby Warshaw, arguably the team's
strongest player, has been named to almost
every preseason All-America team as well
as the preseason watch list for the MAC
Hermann Trophy, given to the best colle
giate player in the country.
With 19 returning players, the Cardinal
appears to be very talented, but the team

has not been able to break through.
Throughout the game against UNLV,
Stanford seemed confused and unaware.
The Card seemed more skillful on the ball
than its opponents, but was consistently
done in by turnovers at inopportune mo
ments. The initial 1-0 deficit was the result of
a Stanford corner kick that was cleared
away in the 35th minute, and which led to a
quick UNLV counterattack. With the de
fenders on their heels, UNLV strung a few
short passes together, and redshirt fresh
man goalie Jason Dodson was helpless at
close range.
An equalizing goal from junior Taylor
Amman off a shot from junior Garrett Gun
ther gave life to the home team and several
hundred fans in the stands, but another ef
fective UNLV counterattack eight minutes
into overtime left several players lying de
jectedly on their backs in the afternoon sun.
Warshaw, for one, proved to be every bit
the captain that head coach Bret Simon
hoped he would be, barking out commands
and consistently winning and distributing
the ball. The organization among the de
fending quartet of seniors Cameron Lam
ming, Ryan Thomas and Warshaw alongside
junior Tommy Ryan was also generally

sound.
But there was an evident and crit
ical lack of fluidity between the full
backs and the attack. Stanford for
wards were often left standing flat
footed when they didn't have the
ball.
In the Sunday nightcap against
Sacramento State, both teams
picked up the tempo, and it appeared
as though Stanford would break

through several times, including a
driven shot from Warshaw just out
side the 18-yard box that was tipped
away at the last second.
The second half brought more of
the same energy, as the Cardinal
continued to play with a confidence
and poise that was often lacking
against UNLV. The team forced 10
corner kicks overall, and the game
seemed again destined for overtime
when Sacramento State played a
quick through ball which forward
Chris Bettencourt hammered past a
sprawling Dodson with 18 seconds
to go.
The most recent loss brought

back memories of the season opener
at Vermont, when a 1-0 lead evapo
rated in the second half and a golden
goal six minutes into overtime
proved the dagger. Against Harvard
and surrounded by a raucous crowd
of over 3,000, the Cardinal actually
battled back from an early goal to
outplay its opponents, only to see a
quick strike in the 80th minute again
dash the team's hopes.
Perhaps lost amidst the team's
heartbreaking finishes have been
the excellent contributions from
several key players. Sophomores
Adam Jahn and Dersu Abolfathi
have both showed why they came to

the Farm as two of the top recruits in
the country. Jahn is tied with War
shaw for the team lead in goals, and
Abolfathi has started in three of the
four matches at midfield, showing
great creativity and creating numer
ous scoring chances. Freshman JJ
Koval has also featured heavily,
starting in the midfield for all four
matches.
Stanford's next match is on
Thursday at San Francisco. The Card
will return home to face Santa Clara
on Sunday.
