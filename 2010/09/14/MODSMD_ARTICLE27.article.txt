# Football coaches are paid to win

As scandals over improper
benefits played themselves
out like TV dramas across
the college football land
scape this summer, the
media and coaches at various programs
came out strongly against the agents who
paid college football players huge sums
of money, and criticized the players for
violating NCAA rules against "student"
athletes taking money during their colle

Saban, who called agents "pimps"),pun
ishment was meted out and the sport has
collectively moved on from the issue to
focus on the season currently underway.
The role of one critical group was
overlooked, however, and I think it's
time we addressed the place of the col

scape. How did coaches fail to notice the
fact that college kids from less-than
wealthy backgrounds were suddenly
rolling into practice in brand-new
SUVs? Or, why did they see it and ignore
it?
The answer is really quite simple. Col
lege football coaches are not teachers,
professors or anything of the sort. They
are not paid to encourage graduation, ac
ademic achievement or even NCAA
compliance.
College football coaches are paid to
do one thing and one thing only: win
football games. It is this singular metric
upon which they are evaluated, and at
the end of the day, it is winning, not aca
demics, that college football coaches will
promote above all else.
To put it in other terms, coaches are
not in the business of making sure play
ers take tough academic courses and stay
away from agents and boosters. It might
even be to their advantage to encourage
