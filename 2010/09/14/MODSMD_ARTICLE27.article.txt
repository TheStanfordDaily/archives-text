# Football coaches are paid to win

As scandals over improper
benefits played themselves
out like TV dramas across
the college football land
scape this summer, the
media and coaches at various programs
came out strongly against the agents who
paid college football players huge sums
of money, and criticized the players for
violating NCAA rules against "student"
athletes taking money during their colle
giate careers. Blame was cast (most fa
mously by Alabama head coach Nick
Saban, who called agents "pimps"),pun
ishment was meted out and the sport has
collectively moved on from the issue to
focus on the season currently underway.
The role of one critical group was
overlooked, however, and I think it's
time we addressed the place of the col
lege football coach in this entire land
scape. How did coaches fail to notice the
fact that college kids from less-than
wealthy backgrounds were suddenly
rolling into practice in brand-new
SUVs? Or, why did they see it and ignore
it?
The answer is really quite simple. Col
lege football coaches are not teachers,
professors or anything of the sort. They
are not paid to encourage graduation, ac
ademic achievement or even NCAA
compliance.
College football coaches are paid to
do one thing and one thing only: win
football games. It is this singular metric
upon which they are evaluated, and at
the end of the day, it is winning, not aca
demics, that college football coaches will
promote above all else.
To put it in other terms, coaches are
not in the business of making sure play
ers take tough academic courses and stay
away from agents and boosters. It might
even be to their advantage to encourage

the opposite. Players with light academic loads can
devote more time to football (increasing their
chances of playing well), while money from out
side sources can serve as an extra inducement to
play and practice as hard as possible.
There is virtually no incentive for a college
football coach to actually mold his players into
smart, responsible citizens â€”if they turn in a 13-0
record and then leave college with no other skills
besides playing football, it works out quite nicely
for the head coach in question.
Several examples across the college football
world serve to illustrate this trend quite well. To
start with, let's look at Notre Dame, where head
coach Charlie Weis was recently fired for failing to
win enough games during his tenure at the school.
Over a four-year period, Weiss teams scored a 978
on the NCAA's Academic Progress Rating, a
measure of how well universities' athletic teams
are performing in meeting academic benchmarks.
Notre Dame's score came in near the top of foot
ball programs nationwide, scoring between the
90th and 100 th percentile. However, Weis was not
evaluated based on how well his players did on
tests; he was evaluated on whether or not his play
ers went out and won gamcs.'lhev didn't win,so he
got fired.
This same dynamic prevails across the entire

college football landscape. Even at Stanford, sup
posedly more academically motivated than most
other football programs, coaches are hired, paid
and fired based on their on-field performance and
nothing else.
To look at another illustration of this idea, just
head over to Chapel Hill, N.C., where North Car
olina head coach Butch Davis is currently under
investigation for hiring a tutor (with his own
money) to give academic assistance to some of his
players. While I certainly disagree with Davis's ac
tions, it's not hard to see why he took them.The Tar
Heels enter this season with some of the highest
expectations in recent memory, and if Davis didn't
meet those expectations, he would be at risk of los
ing his job. When faced with the possibility that
some of his players might be ruled academically
ineligible for this season, Davis did the logical (but
irresponsible) thing: he did what he could to save
his job. Unfortunately for him, NCAA probes un
covered these violations, putting UNC's hopes for
an ACC title into extreme doubt.
Of course, coaches can choose to take the
moral high road and emphasize things like re
sponsibility and accountability over just winning a
few football games. Until they are incentivized to
do so, however, we will continue to see coaches
who prioritize their own well-being far above that
of their players
