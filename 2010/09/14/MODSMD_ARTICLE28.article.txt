# SNAPPING THE LIONS' STREAK
## 
### CAROLINE CASELLI DESK EDITOR 
Competing for the championship title
in the elite Nike Big Four Volleyball Clas
sic last Saturday in Gainesville, Fla., the
No. 2 Stanford women's volleyball team
took down No. 1 Penn State (7-1) in a
three-set sweep. With the victory, the Car
dinal (7-0) handed the Nittany Lions their
first loss since Sept. 15, 2007, snapping
Penn State's 109-match, NCAA-record
winning streak.
Penn State started the match well,
jumping out to a 7-1 lead early in the first
set. The Cardinal continued to trail until
two Penn State hitting errors followed by
a string of two Stanford kills, a block and
an ace tied the game at 16-16. The set re
mained close, with each team battling
back and forth for points, but a kill from
senior outside hitter Alix Klineman and
an attacking error from the Nittany Lions
secured the set for the Card, 28-26.
Carrying momentum from its narrow
first-set victory, Stanford completely dom
inated the second set. Kills from sopho
more opposite Flayley Spelman, junior
middle blocker Stephanie Browne and
senior setter/opposite Cassidy Lichtman
propelled the Card to a strong 10-5 start.
Strong blocking from Spelman and fresh
man middle blocker Carly Wopat, com
bined with the unstoppable attacking of

Klineman and Lichtman and consistent
defensive play from the back row, eased
the Card to a 25-12 set-two thrashing.
Just one set away from victory, the
Card could not be stopped. Klineman,
Browne and Lichtman continued to
power down kills put up perfectly by soph
omore setter Karissa Cook. A Penn State
hitting error followed by an ace from
Wopat extended Stanford's lead to eight
points its largest of the set at 23-15.
The Nittany Lions held off the Card for
several more plays, but a Lichtman kill se
cured the set and match at 25-18.
Klineman led the Cardinal with 16 kills,
10 digs and two aces. Lichtman contributed
22 assists, 12 kills and seven digs. Senior
libero Gabi Ailes took control of the de
fense with 14 digs, and the team combined
for 47 kills and 0.389 hitting for the match.
The Nittany Lions were led by senior
middle/opposite Blair Brown, who tallied
11 kills and five digs. Freshman outside
hitter Deja McClendon added five kills,
two aces and six digs, and sophomore set
ter Kristin Carpenter had 16 assists.
Penn State is a familiar foe for the Car
dinal it defeated Stanford in the na
tional title game in both 2007 and 2008.
Stanford was also the last team to beat the
Nittany Lions before their record streak.
