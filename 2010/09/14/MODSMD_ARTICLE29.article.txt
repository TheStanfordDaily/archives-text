# The 						Taylor composite football rankings
## 
### Tom Taylor 
Forget last year's national
champion Alabama, Texas,
USC, Florida or any of the
other big schools: the Farm
is where it's at. If you're a
football-fanatic freshman, you made
the right choice to come here.
Now that I have your attention, I'd
better explain myself.There are really
a huge number meanings for "foot
ball," with the biggest of these includ
ing American (what most of you just
call football), Australian (Aussie)
rules, Gaelic, rugby (union and
league) and, of course, association
(aka soccer or, to us foreigners, foot
ball). Most aren't widely played at
American universities, and I am not
going to attempt to research the com
parative strengths of schools based on
all of them, so let's just pick Ameri
can, rugby union and soccer. Almost
exclusively, American football is only
played by men, whereas the other two
are played by both men and women at
the college level. Though rugby union
is not generally an NCAA sport, it is
still widely played at the club level,
and Big Game was even a rugby
match between 1904 and 1914; surely
that's reason enough to include it.
Stanford's final (top-25) season
rankings in these from last year were:
football (21, BCS), men's soccer (14)
and women's soccer (2, NSCAA),
men's rugby (unranked) and
women's rugby (2,
RUGBYMag.com).
An aggregate "football" ranking
can be worked out by simply assign
ing points to the school for each sport
(25 points for No. 1 down to zero for
unranked). And yes, you guessed it,
Stanford comes in first with 65 points.
UCLA, absent from the BCS rank
ings, is narrowly second with 64,
ahead of North Carolina (59), while
Cal sits at 11th. None of the top 10
BCS schools is in the top 10 for "com
bined football." Perhaps quite pre
dictably, the highest-ranked schools
are those represented in at least three

or four of these sports.
Stanford's position last year owes
a lot to both the much-improved per
formance of its men's teams (football
and soccer) and the high achieving
women's teams. Interestingly, the
women alone would have sealed sev
enth place on this list.
Those with eyes only for the grid
iron will probably find holes to pick in
my hastily drawn-up statistics, but it is
no mean feat that the Cardinal comes
out on top. These are all very different
sports and even to be ranked in the
top 25 requires a committed and pro
fessional approach by both coaches
and players. That Stanford is one of
the few schools to be represented at
this level across four out of five of
these further underlines, if that was
ever needed, its Directors' Cup domi
nance and 34-year NCAA title streak.
Stanford's hopes of retaining this
title in the coming year rest on the
women repeating, or even bettering,
the successes of recent seasons, and
on whether the men's teams can con
tinue to improve.
Unfortunately for Cardinal men's
rugby, the best 32 programs across the
nation have left the existing setup to
create their own Collegiate Premier
League. With these changes in place, it
may now be effectively impossible for
Stanford to rise to the same level as,
and be ranked alongside, the top 25.
Even excluding this one sport though,
the Cardinal still hosts some very
strong football programs within its
8,000 acres.
Preseason polls (including last sea
son's final ranking for women's rugby,
because a more recent poll was un
available) dropped the Cardinal to
fourth, though notably the football
program was then unranked. Follow
ing the most recent available rank
ings, Stanford (55) is down one place
to fifth after football's return to the
top 25 (now at No. 19 on both the AP
Top 25 and USA Today Poll), the
positive effect of which was essen
tially cancelled out by the men's soc
cer team dropping off the list.
North Carolina and BYU now sit
tied with 59 points at the top of this
combined football table, and Penn
State is one point adrift in third.
Stanford's cross-Bay rivals, the
Golden Bears, are just one place and
two points behind the Card, in sixth.
However good Stanford football
(that's American football now) turns
out to be this year, no one is ever
going to give it a shot at a national
championship; however, it could
climb higher up in the top 25, and the
Rose Bowl is not out of the question.

Meanwhile, the two women's teams
could well bring home their own
NCAA titles, and some will view
anything but as a disappointment.
The ability of men's soccer to re
bound from a losing start will proba
bly be the clincher, though: if it were
still at its preseason ranking of No.
13, the Card would be clear of the
pack by a massive nine points.
But the season is barely a few
games old and already the preseason
rankings count for nothing. There
will be enough highs and lows,
shocks and surprises between now
and its end to keep any sports fan
happy.
So get ready for some football.

Preseason polls (including last sea
son's final ranking for women's rugby,
because a more recent poll was un
available) dropped the Cardinal to
fourth, though notably the football
program was then unranked. Follow
ing the most recent available rank
ings, Stanford (55) is down one place
to fifth after football's return to the
top 25 (now at No. 19 on both the AP
Top 25 and USA Today Poll), the
positive effect of which was essen
tially cancelled out by the men's soc
cer team dropping off the list.
North Carolina and BYU now sit
tied with 59 points at the top of this
combined football table, and Penn
State is one point adrift in third.
Stanford's cross-Bay rivals, the
Golden Bears, are just one place and
two points behind the Card, in sixth.
However good Stanford football
(that's American football now) turns
out to be this year, no one is ever
going to give it a shot at a national
championship; however, it could
climb higher up in the top 25, and the
Rose Bowl is not out of the question.

Meanwhile, the two women's teams
could well bring home their own
NCAA titles, and some will view
anything but as a disappointment.
The ability of men's soccer to re
bound from a losing start will proba
bly be the clincher, though: if it were
still at its preseason ranking of No.
13, the Card would be clear of the
pack by a massive nine points.
But the season is barely a few
games old and already the preseason
rankings count for nothing. There
will be enough highs and lows,
shocks and surprises between now
and its end to keep any sports fan
happy.
So get ready for some football.

Tom Taylor just wanted to prove to
himself that he could use Excel 2010
to draw up these statistics. School
him on spreadsheets at torn, taylor
