## TEN TIPS FOR FALL QUARTER ON THE FARM 
### ANNE PIPATHSOUK 
Upperclassmen offer 10 tips for survival
on the Farm.
1. Remember to lock your bike. Alex Neil
'll suggests "locking yours to a bike rack, not
just to itself. Mischievous people have been
known to put free standing bikes in trees, es
pecially if they're near a doorway on a Friday
or Saturday night." A bike in a tree may be hi
larious until you have to get it out. In the
meantime, develop other good habits: go to
office hours, work out, check your e-mails, get
off campus once in awhile, do laundry and re
turn dining hall dishes.
2. Dress up and participate in Stanford tra
ditions. Band Run. Fountain hopping. Gai
eties. Scavenger Hunt. Full Moon on the
Quad. Mausoleum Party. Frat parties. Hiking
the Dish. Sports events. Big Game. (We're
probably one of the few schools that can go to
football games for free.)
3. Do not complain about IHUM too
much. Instead, try taking a random class to
balance it out. Ask upperclassmen, professors
or advisors for suggestions and advice. Use
and abuse Courseßank. It will be worthwhile
make for interesting conversation.
4. Try out all the dining halls and
campus eateries. "My freshman hall
would have what affectionately be
came known as 'Ricker dinner' once a
week where we'd ditch our normal
dining hall in favor of Ricker Dining,"
Erin Inman 'l3 said. "Although we
may have thought we were getting
better food, in actuality we were just
taking the time to slow down and
truly enjoy our meal and our friends."
If you're still not satisfied, there are
plenty of fruit trees around campus.
5. Blow the bubble as big as you
can... by noticing the little things that

Stanford has to offer, such as Green
Library and its media collection, 5-
SURE, speaker events, the Mar
guerite, FLiCKS, Career Fair (grab
some free stuff!), Cantor, sunshine
and many patches of grass.
6. Find a good study place. Try dif
ferent niches at Green and lounges
in department buildings. "It's a good
idea to take advantage of the abun
dance of California sunshine during
the beginning of the school year be
fore winter rolls around," said Lilly
Sath *l2. "It's always great to kill two
birds with one stone when you can
study outside on a field and soak up
some sun at the same time." Hint:
once it turns into a good nap spot, it's
time to find a new one.
7. Take pictures. Do not be mis
taken as a tourist.
8. Get involved. In absolutely

anything that you want. No rush if
you haven't found your thing right
away. Try a broad range, but be care
ful not to over-commit. Your room
mate and dorm mates will hate you
less when they are not woken up at 7
a.m. by the perpetual pounding and
shouting that accompany roll-outs.
9. Make friends. Really, you have
no excuses. "Really [put] yourself
out there and [get] to know the peo
ple who will surround you for the
next four years of your life," Brittany
Ueno 'l2 said. "I wouldn't say to try
and befriend everyone everywhere,
but having a close-knit group of
dorm friends or just someone to talk

to you when school gets rough is es
sential during the first year away
from home." And hang onto your
frosh Faceßook. You never know
when it will come in handy!
10. Remember that Stanford ac
cepted you. And that you chose
Stanford. Take care of yourself, be
appreciative of others, and take ab
solutely nothing for granted. Try
walking to your classes for at least a
whole day to slow things down. You
are just beginning your part in one of
the greatest legacies. No pressure.
