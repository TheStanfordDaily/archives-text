## TEN TIPS FOR FALL QUARTER ON THE FARM 
### ANNE PIPATHSOUK 
Upperclassmen offer 10 tips for survival
on the Farm.
1. Remember to lock your bike. Alex Neil
'll suggests "locking yours to a bike rack, not
just to itself. Mischievous people have been
known to put free standing bikes in trees, es
pecially if they're near a doorway on a Friday
or Saturday night." A bike in a tree may be hi
larious until you have to get it out. In the
meantime, develop other good habits: go to
office hours, work out, check your e-mails, get
off campus once in awhile, do laundry and re
turn dining hall dishes.
2. Dress up and participate in Stanford tra
ditions. Band Run. Fountain hopping. Gai
eties. Scavenger Hunt. Full Moon on the
Quad. Mausoleum Party. Frat parties. Hiking
the Dish. Sports events. Big Game. (We're
probably one of the few schools that can go to
football games for free.)
3. Do not complain about IHUM too
much. Instead, try taking a random class to
balance it out. Ask upperclassmen, professors
or advisors for suggestions and advice. Use
and abuse Course√üank. It will be worthwhile
