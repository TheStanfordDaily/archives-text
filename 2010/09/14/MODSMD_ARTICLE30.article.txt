# Give Michael Vick another chance
## 
### Zach Zimmerman Dishing the Rock 
The first NFL jersey 1 ever
purchased was a black No. 7
Atlanta Falcons jersey. As a
short and geeky seventh
grader, I wore this jersey
with pride, enduring stains from cafete
ria pizza and questioning faces from my
friends in my attempts to remain con
nected with the name on the back: Vick.
As for why 1 was watching Virginia
Tech football at age nine, that's beyond
me. What 1 do know is that watching
then-redshirt freshman quarterback
Michael Vick obliterate the NCAA
over the course of the 1999 season was
the most electrifying individual per
formance that I have ever seen. I was
blown away by Vick's unique ability to
avoid pressure and scramble out of the
pocket for 50-yard scores. And while
most remember his Barry Sanders
esque running style, Vick also pos
sessed the ability to sling the rock 75
yards in the air, making him the most
dangerous player in college football.
When he was drafted first by the
Falcons in the 2001, there was no doubt
that 1 was going to follow the guy for
the duration of his career. That was, if
he had a full career at all.

Fast forward to Sunday, the 2010
NFL season opener for the Philadel
phia Eagles. After shipping out fran
chise quarterback Donovan McNabb
to the division rival Redskins, Philly
was about to begin the Kevin Kolb era
(eeeek) with a visit from the Super
Bowl-caliber Green Bay Packers.
In true Philly heartbreak, Kolb suf
fered a concussion in the first half and
would not return to the game. Just min
utes into their season, Eagles fans were
already dreading the offseason deal.
Now without McNabb and Kolb, the
Eagles, down by 10 at the half, were
forced to turn to last year's third
stringer for the daunting comeback at
tempt.

Miraculously, the backup came in
and led a valiant effort, registering 175
yards and a touchdown through the air
and rushing for 103 yards on just 11 car
ries. Looking like a reincarnation of a
slim and trim, 23-year-old McNabb, he
was able to successfully manage an Ea
gles team that looked destined for a
blowout. Despite falling seven points
short, a statement had been made, and

Philly fans, the most brutal in the world,
saw a glimmer of hope.
The Eagles' backup on Sunday?
Michael Vick.
1 am the first one to agree that Vick's
off-the-field trouble was immoral, un
professional and punishable by law.
And although 1 may disagree with the
price he had to pay Donte Stall
worth received just 30 days in prison for
drunkenly running over and killing a
pedestrian he paid it nonetheless.
We can choose to dwell on his mistakes
and continue ridiculing one of the most
revolutionary quarterbacks in football
history, or we can embrace his on-the
field talent for what it is and marvel at
his ability.
His poise on the field Sunday was
entirely unexpected. This was the first
time since 2006 that he had received

significant playing time, and he took
advantage of it. And I'm not a religious
guy, but sometimes when the stars align
and these moments happen in sports, I
can only feel that another shot at great
ness is deserved.

As terrible as I feel for Kolb and
I do feel terrible; he had an entire luxu
ry box for family and friends at the
game Philadelphia needs Vick, and
Vick needs Philadelphia. He clearly has
the skill left, and although he's 30, his
body and athleticism have not deterio
rated in the slightest. Sunday's second
half was brilliant, and Vick's one-of-a
kind style of play was sorely missed.
Head coach Andy Reid has a big de
cision to make in the upcoming week. If
Kolb is cleared to play it's a big "if'
as the NFL continues to evaluate its
treatment of concussions then he

should be favored to regain his posi
tion. In all fairness, he wasn't really
given a chance to show his stuff But
there will undoubtedly be advocates
for Vick, pressing for his return as
Philly's field general.

I will be among that group hoping
for another chance. I can't evaluate
Michael Vick's character, but I can
evaluate his entertainment value. And
that, for the NFL and its fans, is sky
high.

Zach Zimmerman is probably just de
fending a purchase he made more than
10 years ago. Give him some buyer's
remorse at zachz@stanford.edu.
