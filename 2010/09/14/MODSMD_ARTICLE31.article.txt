# CROSS COUNTRY
## Running the numbers 
### ZACH ZIMMERMAN DESK EDITOR 
For the men and women of Stan
ford cross country, the 2009 season
was a year to forget. After disap
pointing finishes of 10th and 16th at
the NCAA Championships respec
tively, both components of the Car
dinal's historic program faced seri
ous questions. But after a valuable
learning process, Stanford is back,
looking to reclaim its throne atop
the collegiate distance running elite.

The Cardinal men enter the sea
son ranked as the No. 1 team in the
nation. In a sport where team rank
ings matter very little as evi
denced by Stanford's performance
at nationals a veteran men's team
understands that the expectations
for the squad are not to be taken for
granted.
"I think that last year's national
finish taught us in a very cruel way
the need to maintain a healthy fear
[and] respect for failure going into
the biggest race of the year," said
Ail-American junior Chris Derrick.
"Accepting that will help us face the
obstacles that we will inevitably face
this year."
Last year's finish, though unsatis
factory for the team, cannot over
shadow the returning talent that
Stanford brings into the 2010 season.
Joining Derrick is fellow All-Ameri
can senior Elliott Heath, as well as
redshirt junior Jake Riley and red
shirt senior J.T. Sullivan, both of
whom excelled in their respective
distance track events in the spring.
With relatively few new contribu
tors, Cardinal fans should be familiar
with the faces on the men's team.
However, the Stanford men believe
that there is a noticeable difference
in this season's group.
"Ironically, perhaps, I think that
there is a more secure confidence as
sociated with this team than last
year's," Derrick said. "Last year at
this time we wondered if we could
win NCAAs and spent part of the
season trying to prove that fact to
ourselves. This year, we know that
we can win if we perform to our abil
ities.
"That confidence is coupled with

greater respect for the challenges
that we will face and a more realistic
idea for just how difficult it is to win
a national championship," he contin
ued. "I think that those two things
combine to form a more mature out
look for this season."
On the women's side, preseason
rankings do matter, in the form of
team motivation. The Cardinal en
ters the season at No. 12, a ranking
the women believe undervalues
their potential.
"When I look at preseason polls I
think our team is vastly underrated,"
said senior Alex Gits. "We have
some real talent on this team that no
doubt will be successful individually,
but contribute to team scoring."
The women are led by junior Steph
Marcy, who nearly earned All-Ameri

can honors last year with a 53rd-place
finish at nationals. Sophomores Alex
Dunne and Kathy Kroeger and junior
Georgia Griffin also return for Stan
ford, this time with valuable big-race
experience after joining Marcy and
Gits at nationals.
Like the men's team, the loss of
just a few seniors is expected to help
give the women a valuable edge.
"As far as personnel, our team is
very similar compared to last year
because we didn't lose many sen
iors," Gits said. "However, our re
turners have come to training camp
already very focused, fit and goal
oriented, which I believe is going to
contribute to a very successful year
ahead."
The cross country season official
ly began on Sept. 4 as Stanford, rac

ing with limited runners, swept the
Jim Vanden Heuvel Twilight meet in
Reno, Nev. Leading the way for the
women was Alex Gits, who finished
the 4,000-meter course in first over
all with a time of 14:54. J.T. Sullivan
followed suit, finishing in second
with a team-best time of 20:04 in the
men's 6,000-meter race.
Up next for the Cardinal is the
Stanford Invitational, a home meet
that is guaranteed to see action from
many of the nation's best. Stanford is
expected to bring its full squads to
the race.
The Stanford Invitational takes
place on Sept. 25 and is an all-day
event.

teams last year, a new season provides hope for better results at nationals. The
men enter with a No. 1 national ranking, while the women come in at No. 12.
