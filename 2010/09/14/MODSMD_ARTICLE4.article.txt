## Castro discusses alcohol survey, county 
### ELIZABETH ROSEN STAFF WRITER 
The University this summer announced
it would fund AlcoholEdu for four more
years, citing survey results about the pro
gram "that suggest it works at Stanford."
Now, administrators are explaining the
methodology behind their survey, whose
results are part of a package Stanford pres
ents to the county to keep its exemption
from a local alcohol ordinance.
Stanford's decision to continue funding
for AlcoholEdu came after reporting in
July that 71 percent of students surveyed
rated AlcoholEdu as "somewhat to very ef-

fective" in educating them about col
lege alcohol issues and 77 percent
said they learned something useful
about alcohol from the program. Al
coholEdu is the online-based alcohol
education program introduced in
2006 and required of all incoming
freshmen at Stanford.
The Substance Abuse Prevention
and Policy Office constructed the sur
vey, said manager Ralph Castro. Psy
chiatry faculty and Undergraduate
Advising and Research staff "vetted"
the survey, he said.
Stanford sent the survey to each
class during the spring of the academ
ic year the class completed AlcoholE
du, Castro said. In four years, 1,685
students completed the survey, a re
sponse rate of approximately 27 to 33
percent.
The University had a material
stake in the outcome. In January, the
University cited the success of Alco
holEdu and other education meas
ures when it gained exemption from
Santa Clara County's "social host"
drinking ordinance. The rule allows
the county to fine property owners
and those responsible for hosting un
derage drinking gatherings up to
$7OO. Stanford's exemption came
under the stipulation that it continue
its historically intensive efforts to pre
vent unsafe and underage drinking
and regularly report the results to the
county.
Castro said the county is aware
that Stanford uses AlcoholEdu, but
that the program is only one piece of
much larger alcohol education and
safety efforts on campus. "We contin
ue to strive to have a cutting edge, em
pirically based alcohol and drug edu
cation and early intervention pro
gram at Stanford," Castro wrote in an
e-mail to The Daily. "Our main goal is
to educate students to think critically
and make healthy, responsible and
safe decisions."
Meanwhile, students' responses to
the survey were mixed. According to
Castro, only 22 percent of responding
students reported having a construc
tive conversation about the program,
while 63 percent reported engaging in
a negative conversation about the
program, a finding Castro called "sur
prising." He said he hopes to chal

lenge students' negative perceptions
of the program and encourage them
to discuss its merits as well as its neg
ative aspects.

Esther Vigil 'l4, who is currently
participating in AlcoholEdu's online
tutorial, said she thinks the program
will have a minimal effect on students'
partying and drinking habits. Vigil val
ues AlcoholEdu as away of opening
discussions about partying safely, but
thinks the program doesn't create val
ues, only reinforces them.

"Depending on how much atten
tion we paid to the presentation, we're
all better informed," Vigil wrote in an
e-mail to The Daily. "When it comes to
how we drink, however, our decisions
are influenced by the atmosphere
we're in and the experience we've had
with alcohol and partying in the past
immensely more than by the two
hours we spent trying to multi-task
while the computer showed us animat
ed figures in different states of inebri
ation."
Matt Wong 'll, who took Alco
holEdu before his freshman year at
Stanford and was a staff member in
freshman dorm Larkin last year, says
students who come to college with
varying experiences with alcohol will
experiment and find their own limits,
regardless of any structured alcohol
education.
"Having honest role models in a
dorm can provide a more honest and
useful view of alcohol use on cam
pus," Wong said. "With that said, addi
tional information about alcohol
safety can't ever hurt."
