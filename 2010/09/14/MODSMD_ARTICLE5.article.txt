## New book rule rolls into place Some professors still lag on turning in textbook info 
### ELLEN HUET MANAGING EDITOR 
As a result of a newly enacted federal
mandate, textbook prices and the
sticker shock that often accompanies
them will be available to all students
as soon as registration opens, ideally al
lowing for students to make financially
informed decisions about textbook pur
chases before the bookstore even stocks
its shelves.
Stanford and all other American uni
versities are now required to provide rel
evant textbook information especial
ly book prices, editions and International
Standard Book Numbers (ISBNs) for
courses at the time of registration, in ac
cordance with the Higher Education Op
portunity Act, a law that took effect on
July 1.

To comply, the University registrar
teamed up with the Stanford Bookstore
to collect textbook information from
professors and provide students with
open access to the information by Aug. 1,
the registration opening date for fall
quarter. As recently as Friday, however,
not all courses had textbook information
available.

"We had about 62 percent of the
adoptions [textbook information] on
Aug. 1, which is very comparable to last
year," said bookstore director Janet
Gawley.'As of [Friday], we have approx
imately 91 percent of all adoptions."
Gawley said that although the book
store tried to collect information before
professors finished spring quarter, many
professors are hard to reach during sum
mer quarter, accounting for the low rate
of information on Aug. 1. She added that
while getting the rest of the textbook in
formation for students is "a daily battle at
this point," August gets "a lot of activity"
and information flows in faster as the
school year approaches.
The textbook information is available
online to students via Axess. When
searching for courses, students can click
on the "Stanford Bookstore" link in the
course listing and be directed to a win
dow with textbook information for the
course.
Although Axess is the medium
through which students ultimately regis
ter for courses, other means of exploring
courses do not provide the same help.
Comparably comprehensive textbook
information is not accessible through the
Stanford Bookstore's commercial web
site, Stanford's Explore Courses or the
online bulletin. Assistant University
Registrar Steven Shirreffs added in an e
mail to The Daily that there are "no plans
at this point to add syllabus informa-

tion to Explore Courses."
"The Registrar's Office created an
interface between Axess and the
Stanford Bookstore (eFollett),"
Shirreffs said. "We asked depart
ments and faculty to submit textbook
information by May 24th in order to

facilitate passing this information to
the bookstore and to assist the book
store to obtain best possible pricing
on textbooks."
The only expense to Stanford was
the cost of creating the interface, he
said.
Gawley said that an early deadline
for textbook information from pro
fessors allows the bookstore to get
the best possible prices on used text
books for students.
For students, the new textbook in
formation location is a convenience

that, while helpful, hasn't been well
advertised.
"I hadn't heard about the new
mandate," said Yashraj Narang 'll,
who said he usually buys his textbooks
online for a better price by finding the
information from sources like
www.syllabus.stanford.edu. "If I knew
this information was [on Axess], that'd
probably be a lot easier."
Although the mandate's goal is to
provide students with information so
they can make textbook purchases
from any provider, Gawley doesn't
think the mandate will affect book
store sales.
"Students are pretty savvy," she
said. "If they wanted the book infor-

mation, they'd seek it out and find it.
We don't look at it as a loss of money."
The bookstore traditionally is the
organization that collects textbook
information from professors, but, as
Gawley said, the law places the re
sponsibility for compliance with the
new mandate on the University regis
trar. In the end, though, both the
bookstore and the registrar agree that
the professors are the ones who have
control over the information.
"This all works on what we obtain
from the instructors," Gawley said.
"Although we strongly encour
aged faculty to submit textbook infor
mation in a timely fashion using the
new resources, the responsibility to
comply in the end rests with them,"
Shirreffs said.
The Higher Education Opportu
nity Act stipulates other cost-cutting
requirements, such as selling bundled
textbooks as separate items, and em
phasizing transparency between pub
lishers and professors when dis
cussing textbook prices.
