## New book rule rolls into place Some professors still lag on turning in textbook info 
### ELLEN HUET MANAGING EDITOR 
As a result of a newly enacted federal
mandate, textbook prices and the
sticker shock that often accompanies
them will be available to all students
as soon as registration opens, ideally al
lowing for students to make financially
informed decisions about textbook pur
chases before the bookstore even stocks
its shelves.
Stanford and all other American uni
versities are now required to provide rel
evant textbook information especial
ly book prices, editions and International
Standard Book Numbers (ISBNs) for
courses at the time of registration, in ac
cordance with the Higher Education Op
portunity Act, a law that took effect on
July 1.

To comply, the University registrar
teamed up with the Stanford Bookstore
to collect textbook information from
professors and provide students with
open access to the information by Aug. 1,
the registration opening date for fall
quarter. As recently as Friday, however,
not all courses had textbook information
available.

"We had about 62 percent of the
adoptions [textbook information] on
Aug. 1, which is very comparable to last
year," said bookstore director Janet
Gawley.'As of [Friday], we have approx
imately 91 percent of all adoptions."
Gawley said that although the book
store tried to collect information before
professors finished spring quarter, many
professors are hard to reach during sum
mer quarter, accounting for the low rate
of information on Aug. 1. She added that
while getting the rest of the textbook in
formation for students is "a daily battle at
this point," August gets "a lot of activity"
and information flows in faster as the
school year approaches.
The textbook information is available
online to students via Axess. When
searching for courses, students can click
on the "Stanford Bookstore" link in the
course listing and be directed to a win
dow with textbook information for the
course.
Although Axess is the medium
through which students ultimately regis
ter for courses, other means of exploring
courses do not provide the same help.
Comparably comprehensive textbook
information is not accessible through the
Stanford Bookstore's commercial web
site, Stanford's Explore Courses or the
online bulletin. Assistant University
Registrar Steven Shirreffs added in an e
mail to The Daily that there are "no plans
