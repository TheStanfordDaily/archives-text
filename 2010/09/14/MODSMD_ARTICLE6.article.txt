## Stanford Store preps for long-recommended move Student-run store will move to former ticket office spot 
### SAMANTHA MCGIRR DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford Store is known for offer
ing some of the lowest prices on University
apparel that is, for the students who can
find it. Now, the store is planning on mov
ing this quarter from its current location

behind Tresidder Union in an attempt to
increase visibility.
Low foot traffic is the impetus for the
store's pending move from its present site
to the former location of the Stanford Tick
et Office, said store manager Olivia Witter
'l3. The move comes at the behest of many
in Stanford Student Enterprises (SSE), of
which the store is a division.
"People involved in SSE, including
managers and CEOs, suggested year after
year that the store move," said Witter. "Not
many people know how to get there, and
it's confusing to try to direct people."

The store is a student-run business
whose revenue goes to ASSU. The Stan
ford Department of Project Management
is overseeing the move, which was ap
proved at the end of May.

Manager Kathleen Baldwin said the move
of the store constitutes a separate project
from the bathroom renovations currently
underway in the walkway between the for
mer ticket office and Jamba Juice.

"The maintenance fund is covering the
renovation of the bathrooms, while the
ASSU is funding the Student Store move,"

Baldwin said.
The department designed the layout of
the new store site and is currently working
with contractors to obtain Santa Clara
County building permits. It estimates the
cost of the move will be around $297,000.
According to Project Manager Kelly
Rohlfs, the plans are the result of a close
collaboration with SSE.
"SSE has been involved in every step of
the design, from the big picture layout of
the space to choosing the finishing details,"
