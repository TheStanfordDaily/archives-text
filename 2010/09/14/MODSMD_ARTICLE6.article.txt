## Stanford Store preps for long-recommended move Student-run store will move to former ticket office spot 
### SAMANTHA MCGIRR DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford Store is known for offer
ing some of the lowest prices on University
apparel that is, for the students who can
find it. Now, the store is planning on mov
ing this quarter from its current location

behind Tresidder Union in an attempt to
increase visibility.
Low foot traffic is the impetus for the
store's pending move from its present site
to the former location of the Stanford Tick
et Office, said store manager Olivia Witter
'l3. The move comes at the behest of many
in Stanford Student Enterprises (SSE), of
which the store is a division.
"People involved in SSE, including
managers and CEOs, suggested year after
year that the store move," said Witter. "Not
many people know how to get there, and
it's confusing to try to direct people."

The store is a student-run business
whose revenue goes to ASSU. The Stan
ford Department of Project Management
is overseeing the move, which was ap
proved at the end of May.
Building and Grounds Maintenance
Manager Kathleen Baldwin said the move
of the store constitutes a separate project
from the bathroom renovations currently
underway in the walkway between the for
mer ticket office and Jamba Juice.

"The maintenance fund is covering the
renovation of the bathrooms, while the
ASSU is funding the Student Store move,"

Baldwin said.
The department designed the layout of
the new store site and is currently working
with contractors to obtain Santa Clara
County building permits. It estimates the
cost of the move will be around $297,000.
According to Project Manager Kelly
Rohlfs, the plans are the result of a close
collaboration with SSE.
"SSE has been involved in every step of
the design, from the big picture layout of
the space to choosing the finishing details,"
Rohlfs wrote in an e-mail to The
Daily. "They have even suggested
adding a new door between the
store and the back patio of Tresid
der, which will increase access and
exposure of the store."
Construction on the new site is
set to begin in October and be com
pleted before winter break. The cur
rent store will remain open in the in
terim. The student management
team plans to move the merchan
dise during break. Raj Bhandari
M.S. 'lO, the CEO of SSE, said stu
dents can expect a whole new look
when the store reopens its doors.
"The store gives us an opportuni
ty to rethink what we offer and how
we offer it," Bhandari said. "It will
feature pivoting shelves and in
creased space for merchandise."
Witter echoed Bhandari's enthu
siasm for the proposed modern aes
thetic, noting that the focus will be
on the clothes themselves.
"It'll be a very whitewash store,
the way the Gap looks," Witter said.
"We want to make the clothes pop
against the white background."
Students can view floor plans for
the store in the SSE offices on the
first floor of Old Union.
The store will continue its tradi
tional 10 percent discount for stu
dents, as well as its ongoing hiring
program for sales associates and stu
dent managers, Bhandari and Witter
said.
