# STUDENT LIFE
## Bookstore goes Alta Gracia 
### ANNA SCHUESSLER 
Maritza Vargas, a factory worker
in the Dominican Republic, just
bought her family a computer, re
cently moved to a larger house and is
able to provide her children with
what she calls "proper nutrition."
Vargas can do this because she is paid
a wage she says she can actually live
on.
"For the first time, I can save up

money, so if there is an emergency, I
am prepared," she said in a phone
interview from the Dominican Re
public. Vargas, who has spent 22
years of her life working at a cloth
ing factory, is a contributing mem
ber of the Alta Gracia factory, an
operating facility owned by Knights
Apparel. The clothing she and other
factory workers make will be sold at
universities around the United
States, including at the Stanford

Bookstore.
The brainchild of Knights CEO
Joe Bozich, the factory pays all its
workers a "living wage," which is ap
proximately three times the mini
mum wage paid to the average fac
tory worker in the Dominican Re
public. This means that workers like
Vargas, a single mother of five, can
hope to provide for their families
