# STUDENT LIFE
## Bookstore goes Alta Gracia 
### ANNA SCHUESSLER 
Maritza Vargas, a factory worker
in the Dominican Republic, just
bought her family a computer, re
cently moved to a larger house and is
able to provide her children with
what she calls "proper nutrition."
Vargas can do this because she is paid
a wage she says she can actually live
on.
"For the first time, I can save up

money, so if there is an emergency, I
am prepared," she said in a phone
interview from the Dominican Re
public. Vargas, who has spent 22
years of her life working at a cloth
ing factory, is a contributing mem
ber of the Alta Gracia factory, an
operating facility owned by Knights
Apparel. The clothing she and other
factory workers make will be sold at
universities around the United
States, including at the Stanford

Bookstore.
The brainchild of Knights CEO
Joe Bozich, the factory pays all its
workers a "living wage," which is ap
proximately three times the mini
mum wage paid to the average fac
tory worker in the Dominican Re
public. This means that workers like
Vargas, a single mother of five, can
hope to provide for their families
beyond the day-to-day trajectory.
The business strategy faces skep
tics who say the higher wages paid to
Alta Gracia workers will drive the
factory's product out of the market
for such items as custom t-shirts and
sweatshirts, some of Knights Appar
el's biggest sellers. But Bozich, a sea
soned businessman in the sportswear
trade, said he hopes the company's
commitment to providing sustainable
wages for the workers at Alta Gracia

will elicit an enthusiastic response
from college campus bookstores.
So far, it seems to have done so.
Some 400 university bookstores
have already made arrangements
with Knights Apparel to carry cloth
ing items made at the Alta Gracia
factory. The Stanford Bookstore is
one of them and plans to display
some of the factory's styles in time
for fall quarter.
Janet Gawley, the store director,
sees the sale of Alta Gracia clothing
as a promising addition to the ap
parel the store already stocks. Since
the Stanford Bookstore is operated
by the Follett Higher Education
Group, the decision to carry certain

items made by the factory was not
Gawley's to make. Still, she sees this
as a move in the right direction.
"Follett saw an opportunity to
bring in a line of clothing that bene
fits individuals who are working in
that factory," Gawley said. "I know
that we will continue to seek out this
sort of product." But, she said, "I
don't know if we can ever realisti
cally replace everything in the store,
clothing-wise, with that."
Alta Gracia long-sleeve shirts
produced at the factory will be sold
at the bookstore for $22, compared
to $lB to $26 for shirts from other
brands. Hooded sweatshirts from
the factory are priced comparably

to other brands.
For now, the bookstore and the
Alta Gracia clothing it will carry
seem to impress its most immediate
clothing competitor, the Stanford
Store. As members of an entirely
student-operated business, the
store's staff pays close attention to
the sourcing of its merchandise, en
suring that all its products are sup
plied from within the United States.
"It's very cool that they're doing
that," Stanford Store manager
Olivia Witter 'l3 said of the book
store.
While consumers and store man
agers weigh price differences, the
changes in Vargas' work environ

ment are quite certain. "I'm work
ing in a factory that I feel is really
mine, because I feel respected in the
community," she said.
At her previous workplace, she
said, managers of the factories
would use commands and obsceni
ties to coerce their workers to work
harder. Now, she has even seen em
ployed professionals abandon their
jobs to work at Alta Gracia, she
said.
"Not only do I get a better life,"
she said, "but I get to see other peo
ple in the factory have better lives."
