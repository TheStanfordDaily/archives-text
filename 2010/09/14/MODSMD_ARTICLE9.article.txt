Orientation (NSO).
Farm fledglings can look forward
to the classic highlights, including de
partmental open houses, socials, con
vocation, The Real World, a Friday
night show with legendary bassist
Victor Wooten and a taste of Stan
ford a cappella at the O Show. The
traditional "Three Books" lecture
and discussion feature Strength in
What Remains by Tracy Kidder, The
Spirit Catches You and You Fall
Down by Anne Fadiman and Joyce
Carol Oates' 1996 short story "The
Undesirable Table," all works that

conscious.
