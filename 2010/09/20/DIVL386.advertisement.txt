The New English Core
The Stanford English Department announces a new curriculum for the English major. It features a team-taught, three
quarter core sequence that will provide a broad perspective on the history of literature in English (English literature,
American literature and Anglophone literature) from the Middle Ages to the present. The historical core sequence is
not a survey but rather a narrative investigation of key literary themes, movements and innovations across a broad
sweep. Designed to give the English major more structure and (through an increased number of electives) more
freedom, the new curriculum also features three broad methodological requirements in Poetry, Narrative and
Methodology. The major will culminate for seniors with a Senior Seminar, a capstone course focused on close
interaction with the faculty on cutting edge research topics. The new curriculum marks an exciting moment tor the
English Department, faculty and students alike. As the curriculum comes into effect, Stanford English majors will
engage in new, absorbing and meaningful ways with both the extraordinary local detail and the stunning big picture
of literature in English. Be a part of it!
Historical core sequence
English 100A Literary History I
Autumn: TTh 11-12:30
This quarter traces the development of English literature in its first centuries, focusing on several intersecting themes: changing
technologies of writing and their transformation of texts, writers, and readers; the adaptation of ancient genres into the vernacular; the
collision of cultures as travel, exploration, and trade expand the boundaries of the known world and the human imagination; the turn
within as religious change reshapes the private self and the languages with which it expresses itself; and the emergence of new voices
as literature becomes available to new social classes, to women, and to distinctively modern world-views.
English 1008 Literary History II
Winter: TTh 11-12:30
This quarter charts the creation of a trans-Atlantic republic of letters-and eventually the forging of a distinctive American literature.
Puritanism emerges as a major force of social change and literary value, yet it cedes its vitality to an ethic of sociability and finally
(with Romanticism) to a philosophy of nature. This course will trace changes in the way writers and readers conceived of the process of
producing, consuming, and judging literature.
English 100 C Literary History 111
Spring: TTh 11-12:30
The quarter focuses on how literary texts engage with forces of modernization, industrialization, and colonialism in the nineteenth, and
with urbanization, world wars, the resistance to Western political domination and the emergence of global networks in the twentieth
and twenty-first centuries. Narrative and poetry creatively encounter other expressive media such as film, television, pop music, and
digital culture. In the process, they redefine the roles of authors, narrators, lyrical voices, characters, and ultimately readers themselves.
Methodology courses
English 160 Poetry and Poetics
Autumn: TTh 2:15-3:45, Winter: MTWTh 10-10:50, Spring: MWF 11-11:50

English 161 Narrative and Narrative Theory
Autumn: MW 2:15-3:45, Winter:TTh 2:15-3:45, Spring: MW 11-12:30
An introduction to stories and storytelling-that is, to narrative. What is narrative? When is narrative fictional and when non-fictional?
How is it done, word by word, sentence by sentence? Must it be in prose? Can it be in pictures? How has storytelling changed over
time? Focus on various forms, genres, structures, and characteristics of narrative.
English 162 Critical Methods
Autumn: TTh 2:15-3:45, Winter: MW 3:15-4:45, Spring: TTh 1:15-2:45
