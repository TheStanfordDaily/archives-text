The Bita Daryabari Endowment for Persian Literature
at Stanford University at the Iranian Studies Program
is proud to offer a course titled, "A survey of Iranian
Cinema: Past and Present, A film maker's perspective,'
through the Comp Lit Department. The course will be
taught by Mr. Bahram Beyzaie, Visiting Lecturer for the
Iranian Studies Program.
COURSE TITLE:
A SURVEY OF IRANIAN CINEMA:
PAST AND PRESENT, A FILM MAKER'S PERSPECTIVE
COURSE DESCRIPTION:
While a historical survey will constitute part of our attention, strictly
speaking the survey of Iranian cinema will reflect a personal view rather
than a purely historical analysis.
Special attention will be paid to the development of Iranian film art and
industry in terms of origins, style, genres, and issues of indigenous and
national identity; however, the substance of the lectures will not follow a
comprehensive historical method but will be tailored to a reading closer
to film practice rather than theory.
