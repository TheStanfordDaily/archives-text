## EDITORIAL Stanford in the changing world 
### 
Today marks the beginning of classes for
the 2010-2011 academic year. Today is
the formal intellectual dawn for a brand
new crop of Cardinal faithful, as well as the
start of what will be the final hurrah for an en
livened and vivacious senior class.

But the whir of wheels, the anxious ex
citement punctuating the Quad and the
wafting strains of cheap Bookstore coffee
are not the only signs of movement around
the Farm. The mountains of dirt encircling
Casa Italiana, Bob and Storey reflect the
near-constant tumult of Row refurbishment.
Rising from a formerly cavernous pit of dirt,
the new Science and Engineering Quad glis
tens in anticipation of actual use and absorp
tion into the Stanford world. And the yet-un
finished Knight Management Center looms
heavy over Campus Drive. The Stanford that
the Class of 2011 entered three years ago will
not be the place the Class of 2014 departs
four years from now. The University is
changing.
Yet the eager frosh and giant cranes do not
hold the monopoly on motion. The events and
decisions to come this year already promise
to surprise this seemingly tranquil campus.
Holding the title of the 16th best team in the
country, Jim Harbaugh's football squad looks
poised to threaten Oregon for the Pac-10
title, though the potential departures of our

beloved coach (to Michigan?) and quarter
back Andrew Luck (NFL?) could render this
year either the full revival of Cardinal foot
ball or the second coming of Buddy Teevens.
(Pray this does not happen.)
On the topic of dollars and sense, or lack
thereof, will the University's financial fore
cast finally relieve the hiring freezes institut
ed in 2009? Long a labyrinthine concept, the
University's budget will perhaps be brought
to the forefront of campus discussions, given
the installation of a new director of admis
sion. Is this the year a vibrant discussion of in
ternational financial aid actually plays out
across campus? Almost two years removed
from the fiscal blow that both Stanford and
the nation endured, choices about where to
put our dollars will be telling.
But just as renovations and modifications
are made within the campus loop, so too do
we endure losses. This summer the school en
dured the loss of two Stanford institutions.
One was Bill Lane '42, the former Sunset
magazine publisher whose generous support
gave the Farm the Bill Lane Center for the
American West and the renovated History
Corner. The other was Steve Schneider, biol
ogy professor and one of the nation's fiercest
advocates for fighting global warming.
So as this year unfolds, keep paying atten
tion. You have no idea what you might miss.
