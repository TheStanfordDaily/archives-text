# THE
						TRANSITIVE PROPERTY
## An Unconventional Tutorial: Lessons from Oxford 
### Cristopher Bautista 
Last Thursday miraculously offered me a
brief two-hour window that I could use
to escape NSO and drive over to
Mountain View. I intended to see a gender
specialist for my prescription for testos
terone and to start hormone replacement
therapy. I was so nervous the nurse had to
check my blood pressure three times.
It's a decision that took me a long time to
make. When I was at Stanford, I was thrown
into an emotional turmoil that left me ex
hausted at the end of sophomore year. I de
cided to study abroad in my junior year to
clear my head and finally decide what I want
ed to do. I regard Oxford as a very important
period in my life and a crucial piece in my de
cision to take T.

When I was at Oxford, it was the first time
I was Cristopher Marc right from the start.
(The administrators of the BOSP program
made sure to use my preferred name and
pronoun from the beginning, and I'm grate
ful to them.) My Oxford ID was the first ID
that had my real name, not my legal name.
(Not even my Stanford ID has my preferred
name.) I remember once I was randomly
playing Jenga with some Oxford students,
and one of them called me a "he" no ex
planation needed. It was a moment that
shocked me, since at Stanford I always had to
awkwardly correct people when they re
ferred to me with the incorrect pronoun. But
here, I was Cris â€”just Oris. To those at Ox
ford, I wasn't Cris the trans guy, I was Cris the
American who spelled and pronounced
things funny (it's "color," not "colour"). And
for the first time, I got to take my pronoun for
granted (and believe me, taking that sort of
thing for granted does a lot for one's emo
tional well-being). For once, I could forget
about whether or not I passed, and I could
focus more on my own manhood.
When I wasn't spending my time wasting
away in the libraries writing tutorial papers, I
explored my role as a young man. I wanted to
be a guy people could trust, the sort of guy
someone could feel safe with. I explored the
way I interacted with people, the way I
talked, the way I acted. By the time I finished
winter quarter (I decided to stay one quarter
longer than I intended), I came to terms with
myself. I discovered that being a man isn't
about looking or acting a certain way or
drinking certain things. A man keeps his
word and respects all around him. A man is
someone who respects women. A man is
someone who loves himself and does not feel
the need to prove himself to other men. And
a man is someone who responds to terrifying
situations with unwavering courage, even
when he's scared to death inside. The people
I met, the places I visited and the experiences
I had at Oxford shaped my identity as a
young man and were a huge factor in my de
cision to take this next step in my transition.
Why do I want to take T? Is it really nec
essary to become a man? To be truthful, no
there are some trans guys that feel like
they don't need it. For me, having a 21-year
old mind in what looks like a 15-year-old
guy's body feels a bit dissonant at times, and
finally gaining the physical characteristics
that make my body congruent to my mind

will help me feel more comfortable in my
own body. I will be able to function more eas
ily in a social sphere to make friends, to
further my career and perhaps, to find some
one to spend the rest of my life with.
I suppose compared to most guys, I re
versed the whole chronological order of
growing up while the typical way of grow
ing up is puberty and then coming to terms
with one's manhood, I had to come to terms
with my role as a man long before my voice
broke. And yeah, the fact that I am willing to
go through puberty a second time is a bit
ridiculous. (The first time was stressful
enough.) But it's something I need to do be
fore I graduate, before I start that new chap
ter in my life. (And for my Serra residents, for
a couple weeks, I'll sound like a raspy awk
ward 13-year-old, so be prepared.)
Thursday's doctor's appointment went a
lot easier than I thought I answered a cou
ple questions, signed some release forms and
got my therapist to write a letter of recom
mendation for me. By the time I walked out of
that office, the doctor had ordered the testos
terone from the pharmacy, and by the time the
first week of class wraps up, I'll have had my
first shot of testosterone, I'm so excited to fi
nally look older than a young teenager.
Next week, I plan on turning in my name
change forms to the county court office. Wish
me luck.

For once, I could
forget about
whether or not I
passed, and I could
focus more on my
own manhood.
