# STETHOSCOPES, COMPILERS AND HEMINGWAY
## My Experiment 
### Aaditya Shidham 
As I write these words, I have a deep
seated desire to minimize the Mi
crosoft Word document that they re
side in, open up Chrome and explore the wide
world of the Internet. I view the web as a
giddy child in a candy store a passive con
sumer that finds all sorts of fascinating and
bizarre products there. I doubt I'm addicted
but isn't this what every addict says?
This passion (read: borderline addiction)
has hurt my ability lately to focus deeply on a
task/issue/idea at hand arguably one of the
most important touchstones of a thriving in
tellectual life.The übiquity of an Internet con
nection allows me to look for the shiny and
new before the important. Experiences I once
derived meaning from now are distracted by
what may lie in the virtual world. Perhaps the
most vicious personal consequence of the
Web is its ability to suck the boredom or the
pressure from a moment in time and deny me
the simple and scary pleasure of just being
with my living, breathing self.
Due to these concerns, I tried an experi
ment for a short portion of this summer: I did
n't allow myself access to any electronic com
munication for 23 hours of the day, every day,
for 2 weeks. At a time in the summer when I
wasn't surrounded by friends, parties and ac
ademic events or bombarded by texts and
e-mails about them I found this a reason
able goal. I left my laptop and iPhone with a
trusted friend in Mirrielees and biked back
from Crothers to check on it only after about
11 p.m. every night. In this last hour of the day,
I checked my e-mail/Facebook/Twitter, re
turned missed calls and did the interrupting,
usually insignificant work of digital commu
nication that ripped apart my attention span
throughout the day.
By the end of "the first day at this enter
prise, I remember feeling vague symptoms of
withdrawal. I remember reaching for my

backpack to pull my laptop out in my dorm
room and finding nothing. I would halfway
reach into my pocket for my iPhone, and my
hand would grasp for open space. Suddenly,
the distance between me and other people
mattered, and there existed a concrete barri
er to communicating with them. I found my
self having to plan my phone calls and e-mails
ahead of time.

Yet there was something deeply liberating
about being with a book or a person or an
idea and knowing with definite certainty that
nothing in the world would bother this inter
action. My days became simpler, filled with
reading, writing, running and working. For the
first time in perhaps a decade, I wrote out

things with my hand. Not just sentences, but
whole pages of a story flew out of a lead pen
cil! My penmanship got better, and I could
suddenly read my own handwriting with ease.

Those two weeks were some of the most
serene of my adult life. In some ways, I re
turned to my life as a 10-year-old: a person
that looked up at the night sky more often,
whose world had shrunk to his immediate
surroundings. I read more vivaciously and
thought more intently. My head lost the ring
ing necessity to check what was new with the
world.

Eventually, after I regained possession of
my laptop, my old habits came flooding back.
I now no longer wrote things by hand. I slow
ly have regained that ringing, somewhat su
perficial curiosity for world events if not
for the nobler goal of engagement, then at
least for the pure adrenaline rush of learning
of something new that happened in the world.
As we emphasize our outer lives and our
community on this start of the academic cal
endar, we must not forget what makes the so
cial life of community so worthwhile. The very
reason we subscribe to societies all around
campus is because individuals in them have
developed a rich and fascinating inner life of
integrity and passion. These kinds of leaders
are rare, even at this university of universities.
I invite you to be one of these intellectual
leaders. The next time you feel like burning a
few hours with a You Tube session, write to
your senator. Pick up Mein Kampf and start
reading. Look in the library archives for Stein
beck's letters home as a Stanford college stu
dent.This CS major invites you to try his exper
iment of limited electronic communication
and write to him (no really snail mail it!).

last e-mail at ashidham@stanford.edu. This
way, he will know to check his P.O. Box.
