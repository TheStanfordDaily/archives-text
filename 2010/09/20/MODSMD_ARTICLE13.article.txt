# LETTER FROM THE EDITOR

Proud to call home

"It's all about us."
So goes the motto of The Ferndale Enter
prise, the 131-year-old weekly newspaper
my parents run in tiny Ferndale, Calif. They
bought the paper when I was 10. Then, I
thought "us" meant the newspaper staff
the copy editor, Linnie Blattner '59, the edi
torial cartoonist, Jack Mays, the columnist,
Wendy Lestina, my siblings, schlepping bun
dles of papers up and down Main Street in a
red wagon, and my mom, the editor.
Wrong. "Us," my mom began to write in
an annual letter to subscribers, meant "the
community we live and work in and are
proud to call home." I came to appreciate
her definition. It included all 1,500 readers,
some in Ferndale and some in far-flung
places, all of whom cared about the city and
its stories.

For us all of us things were not al
ways easy. In a close-knit community, it can
be difficult to see your name in the paper or
to be held accountable as a public official.
Regardless, my mom packed the paper with
local names and called out the city and school
board on open-meeting laws.
It can be difficult to jump into a public de
bate or to welcome scrutiny, but all the same,
she ran letter after letter, including ones crit
ical of The Enterprise.
It can be difficult to confront bigotry or
suspicion in your backyard, but Ferndale did

after my mom covered the city's once-dis
criminatory business-permitting practices
and investigated the fraud-tainted downfall
of Humboldt Creamery, a locally run eco
nomic powerhouse.
Why all the discomfort?
Because a vibrant newspaper improves its
community â€”to showcase the best and
shine a light on what it can do better. Week by
week for 10 years, The Enterprise has done
that. When it has succeeded when meet
ings are opened, when policy debates air,
when we chronicle difficult stories my dad
likes to say, "Everything else is diminished."
Stanford and The Daily are not so differ
ent.

In this close-knit community, you may
face discomfort in The Daily's pages. You
may disagree with an opinions piece, read a
story you prefer didn't appear or feel a nag
ging call to engage with Stanford more
deeply than you want to.
We hope, however, you will also see Stan
ford's best in these pages. You will see our
sports wins, our community's most interest
ing characters and debates about our
school's policies. If you choose, you will see
your own voice in our letters. You will see
corrections when we make mistakes. And
you will see, on every page on every weekday,
names, photos and stories that are uniquely
Stanford.

Since 1892, The Daily has pursued its mis
sion: to inform the Stanford community and

educate young journalists. In 1973, it became
independent of the University, negating the
mandate on the sign that now hangs on the
wall of the editor in chief's office: "Distribu
tion of printed material without prior written
consent of Stanford University management
is prohibited."
This fall, 40 editors and scores more writ
ers returned to continue covering Stanford.
Eighteen of those staff interned in news
rooms around the world this summer, many
of them bringing back rich journalism expe
rience to their Daily jobs. They and the rest of
the staff chronicle Stanford with a commit
ment not to any common political ideology
or social niche, but simply to tell great stories,
fairly and accurately.
But it's not just about the staff. It's about
you, whether you join, subscribe, write in or
speak out. Your opportunities are coming up:
every student is welcome to join The Daily at
101 X on Monday, Sept. 27 at 7 p.m. You can
subscribe on our website, stanforddaily.com,
to get our headlines every morning in your
inbox. You can pen a letter or op-ed by e
mailing eic@stanforddaily.com. And you can
get the ear of our editors anytime by check
ing out the staff box on page four.
It may be difficult, but the payoff of your
participation in Stanford life will diminish
the rest. Here in The Daily, for the rest of Vol
ume 238, it's all about us.

- Elizabeth Titus, editor in chief
