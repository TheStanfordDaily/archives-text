## Senate calls three meetings on short notice 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€” Elizabeth Titus 
The ASSU Undergraduate Senate has tried three times
this month to hold a meeting or committee meeting with
out the advance notice required by the group's bylaws or
the ASSU constitution.
The ASSU constitution's freedom-of-information sec
tion says meeting locations, times and agendas "must be
made available at least 24 hours before the meeting is to
be held."The Senate bylaws indicate 72-hours notice is re
quired for meetings: "All rules that apply to actual meet
ings should apply to online meetings, such as giving 72
hours public notice and providing previous notice for all
bills." Senate Chair Michael Cruz 'l2 says 72 hours' notice
is only required for online meetings.
The latest two incidents of short notice came Sunday,
when members of two committees sought to call meetings
for later that day. Senator Robin Perani 'l3 sent an e-mail
to the advocacy committee on Sunday morning calling a
meeting for that day at 4 p.m. She said if committee mem

bers were not available then, the group would meet Mon
day afternoon; that time would have met the 24-hour re
quirement. After The Daily contacted Perani and Cruz
asking if the committee would abide by the 72-hour rule,
Perani told the committee "we can't do the meeting right
now because of 72 hour meeting notice" and said the
meeting time would be changed to later.
On Sunday afternoon, Senator Deepa Kannappan 'l3
asked the Student Life, Housing and Education commit
tee members if they could have an "informal," 30-minute
meeting at Stern Late Nite that evening. After The Daily
inquired about advanced-notice rules, Cruz said Sunday
evening the meeting did not happen.
On Sept. 1, Cruz called an online, "unofficial" meeting
of the Senate for the next day at 6 p.m. After The Daily
asked Cruz and Deputy Chair Madeline Hawes 'l3
whether or not they would go ahead with the meeting,
Cruz announced the meeting would move to Sept. 6. The
reason, he wrote: "Seems like a lot of people are back at
Stanford already for SoCo [Sophomore College]. We'll
move the unofficial meet-up ... so everybody can make
it."
The first regular Senate meeting is set for Tuesday at 7
p.m. at the Nitery.
