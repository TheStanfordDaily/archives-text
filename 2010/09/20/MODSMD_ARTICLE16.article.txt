## POWER PRESS Forward Christen Press leads Card to victory in Santa Clara Classic 
### NATE ADAMS DESK EDITOR 
It's still early, but after opening the season against a gauntlet
of tough East Coast teams, the Cardinal is on cruise control.
Stanford, playing in the Bay Area again after hosting and win
ning the Nike Invitational a week ago, put on a pair of impres
sive performances in the Santa Clara Classic Tournament. Se
nior forward Christen Press scored a total of five goals as she led
the Cardinal (6-0-2) in a 6-1 rout of Utah on Friday and a 2-0
shutout against No. 15 Georgetown two days later. With the pair
of victories, Stanford is riding a five-game winning streak.
Stanford opened the tournament against Utah on Friday
evening, and the Cardi

nal offense went straight
to work, building up a 4-
0 lead inside the first 32
minutes. It took Press
only that much time to
earn a hat trick, the first
of her career, by notch
ing goals in the ninth,
18th and 31st minutes,
all off crosses. Junior
midfielder Teresa Noy
ola supplied the other
goal in that span, with a
close-range finish in the
12th minute.

Utah pulled one
back just after Press'
third goal via a Lauren
Porter header, but Stan
ford put the game away
for good in the final 15

minutes. Sophomore forward Marjani Hing-Glover and fresh
man forward Shelby Payne scored their first goals of the season,
in the 78th and 80th minutes, respectively. The goals widened
the margin to 6-1, and that is how the match would end.
When the Cardinal opened its match against Georgetown on
Sunday, its momentum had not slowed much. In just the third
minute, forward Camille Levin swung in a cross from the right,
and Press controlled it just outside the box before blasting a left
footed drive past Georgetown keeper Jackie Desjardin and into
the net.
Press nearly doubled her tally four minutes later when she
showed breathtaking speed and burst past two Hoya defenders,
only to see her chip fall just outside the far post.
Stanford continued to control the flow of the game in the
first half, with freshman keeper Emily Oliver stopping the few
Georgetown opportunities that came her way and doing her
part to punch the ball forward to the Cardinal offense. The
Hoyas, who led the nation in offense entering Sunday's match,
had their better chances in the early part of the match when
Camille Trujillo charged into the box on Oliver's right side in the
15th minute, but lost the ball thanks to a well-executed slide
tackle from sophomore Courtney Verloo.
Oliver, who recently took over the starting position from
senior Kira Maker, earned the first shutout of her career. It cer-

to remain undefeated when it takes on the
Warriors of Hawaii on Thursday. This will be
the team's first home game of Autumn Quar

tainly helped that her defense held
the Hoyas to just four shots against
Stanford's 22.

Press continued to push hard on
offense and capitalized on a penalty
kick that she drew in the 23rd
minute after attempting to dribble
past two defenders in the left side of
the box. Stanford's top scorer
looked at ease as she sent her 10th
goal past a diving Desjardin and into
the left corner.

With that goal, Press moves high
er in the national rankings and clos
er to some of Stanford's most sacred
milestones. The Palos Verdes, Calif,
native is now tied with recent gradu
ate Kelley O'Hara on Stanford's all
time scoring list and is nearing
school records with her goals (55),
assists (36) and total points (146). To
cement her place in Cardinal lore,
she would need 59, 40 and 148, re
spectively.
"Christen's an amazing player,"
said Stanford head coach Paul Rat
cliffe. "She scored five goals this
weekend, which speaks volumes.
She's deadly in front of the goal and
a great leader on this team, and she's
really emerging as one the best play
ers in the entire country."

When asked if she believes her
self to be at the top of her game,
Press said she thinks there is still
room to improve.

"I think it's more game to game,"
she said. "This was a great weekend
in terms of finishing, but I think I still
have a lot of things I need to improve
on, and I need to keep more posses
sion and work on getting around the
backs and get crosses in. I wouldn't
say it was the best soccer [of my life].
I plan on playing better soccer than I
am right now."

After his team showed it could
control the lead Press provided deep
into the half, Ratcliffe opted to
switch out some of his players. He
started with Press, who was replaced
by Hing-Glover in the 36th minute,
and put subs for all four of Stanford's
forwards by the end of the half.

Back in action after halftime,
Press had several opportunities to
complete her second hat trick in as
many games. Ratcliffe decided to
take her out of the game in the 27th
minute, but he put her back in with
seven and a half minutes remaining.
Both teams ended up scoreless in the
period.
"I'm just trying to make [the

team] mentally stronger," Ratcliffe
said about his substitutions. "We
have a lot of good depth on this
team, and if people are getting a little
tired, they need to come out to let
somebody else get there and make
an impact. We could've put a few
chances in there in the end, and we
didn't, so it could have been better,

but on Friday night, we were able to
do that."

Despite the relative lull in offense
during the second half, Stanford was
able to control the ball with consis
tency. The Cardinal posted 14 shots
in the period and stopped the Hoyas
from making any.
The Cardinal will return home

this weekend, playing Hawaii on
Thursday and No. 3 Portland on Sat
urday.

ate Kelley O'Hara on Stanford's all
time scoring list and is nearing
school records with her goals (55),
assists (36) and total points (146). To
cement her place in Cardinal lore,
she would need 59, 40 and 148, re
spectively.
"Christen's an amazing player,"
said Stanford head coach Paul Rat
cliffe. "She scored five goals this
weekend, which speaks volumes.
She's deadly in front of the goal and
a great leader on this team, and she's
really emerging as one the best play
ers in the entire country."

When asked if she believes her
self to be at the top of her game,
Press said she thinks there is still
room to improve.

"I think it's more game to game,"
she said. "This was a great weekend
in terms of finishing, but I think I still
have a lot of things I need to improve
on, and I need to keep more posses
sion and work on getting around the
backs and get crosses in. I wouldn't
say it was the best soccer [of my life].
I plan on playing better soccer than I
am right now."

After his team showed it could
control the lead Press provided deep
into the half, Ratcliffe opted to
switch out some of his players. He
started with Press, who was replaced
by Hing-Glover in the 36th minute,
and put subs for all four of Stanford's
forwards by the end of the half.

Back in action after halftime,
Press had several opportunities to
complete her second hat trick in as
many games. Ratcliffe decided to
take her out of the game in the 27th
minute, but he put her back in with
seven and a half minutes remaining.
Both teams ended up scoreless in the
period.
"I'm just trying to make [the

team] mentally stronger," Ratcliffe
said about his substitutions. "We
have a lot of good depth on this
team, and if people are getting a little
tired, they need to come out to let
somebody else get there and make
an impact. We could've put a few
chances in there in the end, and we
didn't, so it could have been better,

but on Friday night, we were able to
do that."

Despite the relative lull in offense
during the second half, Stanford was
able to control the ball with consis
tency. The Cardinal posted 14 shots
in the period and stopped the Hoyas
from making any.
The Cardinal will return home

this weekend, playing Hawaii on
Thursday and No. 3 Portland on Sat
urday.

It's still early, but after opening the season against a gauntlet
of tough East Coast teams, the Cardinal is on cruise control.
Stanford, playing in the Bay Area again after hosting and win
ning the Nike Invitational a week ago, put on a pair of impres
sive performances in the Santa Clara Classic Tournament. Se
nior forward Christen Press scored a total of five goals as she led
the Cardinal (6-0-2) in a 6-1 rout of Utah on Friday and a 2-0
shutout against No. 15 Georgetown two days later. With the pair
of victories, Stanford is riding a five-game winning streak.
Stanford opened the tournament against Utah on Friday
evening, and the Cardi

nal offense went straight
to work, building up a 4-
0 lead inside the first 32
minutes. It took Press
only that much time to
earn a hat trick, the first
of her career, by notch
ing goals in the ninth,
18th and 31st minutes,
all off crosses. Junior
midfielder Teresa Noy
ola supplied the other
goal in that span, with a
close-range finish in the
12th minute.

Utah pulled one
back just after Press'
third goal via a Lauren
Porter header, but Stan
ford put the game away
for good in the final 15

minutes. Sophomore forward Marjani Hing-Glover and fresh
man forward Shelby Payne scored their first goals of the season,
in the 78th and 80th minutes, respectively. The goals widened
the margin to 6-1, and that is how the match would end.
When the Cardinal opened its match against Georgetown on
Sunday, its momentum had not slowed much. In just the third
minute, forward Camille Levin swung in a cross from the right,
and Press controlled it just outside the box before blasting a left
footed drive past Georgetown keeper Jackie Desjardin and into
the net.
Press nearly doubled her tally four minutes later when she
showed breathtaking speed and burst past two Hoya defenders,
only to see her chip fall just outside the far post.
Stanford continued to control the flow of the game in the
first half, with freshman keeper Emily Oliver stopping the few
Georgetown opportunities that came her way and doing her
part to punch the ball forward to the Cardinal offense. The
Hoyas, who led the nation in offense entering Sunday's match,
had their better chances in the early part of the match when
Camille Trujillo charged into the box on Oliver's right side in the
15th minute, but lost the ball thanks to a well-executed slide
tackle from sophomore Courtney Verloo.
Oliver, who recently took over the starting position from
senior Kira Maker, earned the first shutout of her career. It cer-

tainly helped that her defense held
the Hoyas to just four shots against
Stanford's 22.

Press continued to push hard on
offense and capitalized on a penalty
kick that she drew in the 23rd
minute after attempting to dribble
past two defenders in the left side of
the box. Stanford's top scorer
looked at ease as she sent her 10th
goal past a diving Desjardin and into
the left corner.

With that goal, Press moves high

er to some of Stanford's most sacred
milestones. The Palos Verdes, Calif,
