## POWER PRESS Forward Christen Press leads Card to victory in Santa Clara Classic 
### NATE ADAMS DESK EDITOR 
It's still early, but after opening the season against a gauntlet
of tough East Coast teams, the Cardinal is on cruise control.
Stanford, playing in the Bay Area again after hosting and win
ning the Nike Invitational a week ago, put on a pair of impres
sive performances in the Santa Clara Classic Tournament. Se
nior forward Christen Press scored a total of five goals as she led
the Cardinal (6-0-2) in a 6-1 rout of Utah on Friday and a 2-0
shutout against No. 15 Georgetown two days later. With the pair
of victories, Stanford is riding a five-game winning streak.
Stanford opened the tournament against Utah on Friday
evening, and the Cardi

nal offense went straight
to work, building up a 4-
0 lead inside the first 32
minutes. It took Press
only that much time to
earn a hat trick, the first
of her career, by notch
ing goals in the ninth,
18th and 31st minutes,
all off crosses. Junior
midfielder Teresa Noy
ola supplied the other
goal in that span, with a
close-range finish in the
12th minute.

Utah pulled one
back just after Press'
third goal via a Lauren
Porter header, but Stan
ford put the game away
for good in the final 15

minutes. Sophomore forward Marjani Hing-Glover and fresh
man forward Shelby Payne scored their first goals of the season,
in the 78th and 80th minutes, respectively. The goals widened
the margin to 6-1, and that is how the match would end.
When the Cardinal opened its match against Georgetown on
Sunday, its momentum had not slowed much. In just the third
minute, forward Camille Levin swung in a cross from the right,
and Press controlled it just outside the box before blasting a left
footed drive past Georgetown keeper Jackie Desjardin and into
the net.
Press nearly doubled her tally four minutes later when she
showed breathtaking speed and burst past two Hoya defenders,
only to see her chip fall just outside the far post.
Stanford continued to control the flow of the game in the
first half, with freshman keeper Emily Oliver stopping the few
Georgetown opportunities that came her way and doing her
part to punch the ball forward to the Cardinal offense. The
Hoyas, who led the nation in offense entering Sunday's match,
had their better chances in the early part of the match when
Camille Trujillo charged into the box on Oliver's right side in the
15th minute, but lost the ball thanks to a well-executed slide
tackle from sophomore Courtney Verloo.
Oliver, who recently took over the starting position from
senior Kira Maker, earned the first shutout of her career. It cer-
