# PERFECTION ON THE ROAD
## 
### KATHERINE KNOX 
With back-to-back wins over local ri
vals St. Mary's and San Francisco this
past weekend, the No. 1 Stanford
women's volleyball team ended its non
conference slate with a perfect record.
The last meeting between Stanford
(9-0) and St. Mary's (7-4) saw the end of
the Gaels' 2009 NCAA Tournament
hopes when they fell to the Cardinal in
a five-set battle at Maples Pavilion.
Despite the success of the Stanford
front line in limiting the offensive suc
cess of St. Mary's from the start of the
match, the Cardinal barely escaped
with a 25-23 win in the first set. Consec
utive blocks by redshirt sophomore Jes
sica Walker got the Cardinal its first two
points to start out the second set, and
the team pulled out a crisp 25-15 win
going into the break.

However, breakdowns in the Cardi
nal serve-receive in the third set severe
ly limited offensive opportunities, yield
ing both the lowest hitting percentage
of the weekend (.152) and the only
game in which Stanford's hitting per
centage was lower than that of its oppo
nent. As a consequence, the Gaels man
aged to take the third set.

The Cardinal came back to shut
them out in the fourth set with domi
nant offense from its outside hitters
freshman Rachel Williams and senior
Alix Klineman both of whom hit
over .400 on the match.
Stanford left McKeon Pavilion with
a four-set victory (25-23, 25-15, 20-25,
25-21) over its rival and headed to San
Francisco to face USF (1-10) the next
night.

The Card jumped out to an early lead
over the Dons as Williams served 11
consecutive points. A series of kills by
Klineman and sophomore right side hit
ter Hayley Spelman and a pair of blocks
by freshman middle blocker Carly
Wopat enabled Stanford to close out the
first set at a decisive score of 25-12.

While the Dons battled with the
Cardinal throughout the second set, a
six-point serving streak by senior setter
Cassidy Lichtman brought the team
from a one-point deficit to a five-point
lead that would ultimately position
Stanford for its 25-17 victory for the set.
Standout offensive performances
by Spelman, Klineman and redshirt
freshman Charlotte Brown were inte
gral to the dominance of the Stanford
front line the team hit a cumulative
.373 across three sets, bringing the
match to an anti-climatic finish at 25-20
in the third set. The final score showed
an easy sweep, as Stanford took the
match 25-12,25-17,25-20.

The Cardinal will begin Pac-10
competition this week as it hits the
road to take on Arizona State and Ari
zona. It will visit the Sun Devils in
Tempe, Ariz, on Friday before taking
on the Wildcats in Tucson, Ariz, on
Sunday.
