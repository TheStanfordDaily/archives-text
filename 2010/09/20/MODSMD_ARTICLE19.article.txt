# Harbaugh isn't so bad after all
## 
### Daniel Bohm 
I won't go that far already, but the
reputation I received last year,
deserved or not, of being Mr.
Negativity in my weekly
columns, is going to be absent
at least for this week. I don't want to
scare away the freshmen just yet.
So instead of trying to suck every
shortcoming out of Stanford's 68-24
drubbing of Wake Forest on Saturday,
I'm going to look on the bright side of
things.
I have never hesitated to criticize
Jim Harbaugh in the past. Case and
point was my cynical Oct. 19 column
last year, after Stanford's loss at Ari
zona, where I questioned some of the
decisions made in the game (i.e. why
Stanford threw the ball on fourth-and
one).
That said, the man knows how to
coach a team up especially an of
fense, The year before Harbaugh ar
rived on the Farm —my freshman
year Stanford went 1-11 under He
Who Shall Not Be Named (Walt Har
ris), and the offense was so pathetic,
despite being led by the current Buffa
lo Bills' starting quarterback Trent Ed
wards, that it often made the dozen or
so fans that actually stuck around to
watch the game liable to lose their
lunch in their seats.

In his first year, 2007, Harbaugh led
the Cardinal to a 4-8 record, followed by
a 5-7 campaign and then last year's 8-5
season, culminating with a loss to Okla
homa in the Sun Bowl.
Now, the Cardinal is 3-0, and this
may be the best coaching job Harbaugh
has done yet.
Last year, when the going got tough,
Harbaugh could always tell his redshirt
freshman quarterback to hand the ball
to the 240-pound, should-be-Heisman-
Trophy-winning bull of a running back
Toby Gerhart.
Even when the stellar offensive line
in front of him had breakdowns, Ger
hart used his power to muscle out two
or three yards. And his reliability was
unmatched he had 18 more carries
than any running back in the nation.
Stanford ran one play "Power"
so many times last year that opposing
defenders literally begged out of games.
Unlike some coaches, which might have
felt the need to show off their bags of
tricks, Harbaugh had no problem with
that strategy.
Sometimes he would trot out seven
or eight offensive lineman, putting
2,400 pounds of blockers in front of
Gerhart. It was a blue-collar, "stop us if
you can" attitude, and it worked.
This year, it isn't so simple. Gone is
the team's security blanket, and in his
place is a cavalcade of other backs vying
for carries.
Yet without Gerhart, the Stanford
offense hasn't missed a beat, and what's
even scarier for opposing defenses is
that it may be a better offense this year.
There were times on Saturday when it
looked like Stanford could score 100
points if it wanted to. The first team of
fense played eight series and scored
eight touchdowns. For the game, Stan
ford only had one possession that didn't
end in a touchdown. Not only that, but
Stanford was not even challenged it
only faced eight third downs all game!
And this wasn't Directional State
University the Cardinal was playing. It
was Wake Forest, a team that broke the
Cardinal's heart last year in Winston-
Salem, N.C. with a second-half come
back (thanks in large part to a mysteri
ously abysmal clipping call on Chris
Marinelli don't think Stanford didn't
remember that) and plays in the At
lantic Coast Conference. Sure, Duke
did drop 48 on the Demon Deacons the
previous week, but Stanford's offensive
output was impressive no less.
Breaking it down a little bit, Har
baugh does not try to be cute. He simply
puts his players in positions in which
they can succeed. When he wants to run
the ball, he will often bring in a sixth of

fensive lineman, sixth-year senior
James McGillicuddy, as a wing to help
the already potent line open holes. He
gives the extraordinarily gifted redshirt
sophomore quarterback Andrew Luck
a lot of short, quick throws early in the
game to get his confidence up.
Harbaugh uses quite an array of
players and formations, not to be gim-

Micky like some coaches, but instead to
maximize the skill sets of the players on
the field. Sure, you can often tell the
Cardinal will be running the ball on a
given play from who is on the field pre
snap, but Harbaugh's mindset seems to
be that he doesn't care what a defense
knows, because his team will execute
—he will keep doing it until it gets
stopped. So far, so good this year.

Dan Bohm is hoping to get on Har
baugh's good side to finally get that
autograph. Ask him about his chances
