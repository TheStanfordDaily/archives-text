# STUDENT LIFE
## NSO concludes with Three Books event 
### MARGARET RAWSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
New Student Orientation (NSO) came to
a close Sunday evening with the annual Three
Books program featuring authors Anne Fadi
man, Tracy Kidder and Joyce Carol Oates.
The three texts were chosen by Debra Satz, a
philosophy professor, and mailed to the Class
of 2014 over the summer. Satz moderated the

discussion held in Memorial Auditorium,
with a simulcast next door in Pigott Theater.
In her opening remarks, Satz said she
chose this year's texts because of the funda
mental moral questions they raise.
"It is both a challenge and imperative to
understand other people," she said.
She also raised another common theme
from the books: the question of which moral
obligations humans have to one another.

Each text, Satz added, carries a sense of
hope within tragedy. Fadiman's "The Spirit
Catches You and You Fall Down" tells the
story of a Hmong girl with epilepsy and the
miscommunication between her family and
well-meaning doctors in Merced, Calif.
Oates described her work, "The Undesir
able Table," as an experimental story dealing
with the human desire to be loved
coupled with a fear of loneliness. It
also deals with the denial of class in
America without particularly
"casting aspersions on America," she
said, since the surreal story could
take place anywhere.
In "Strength in What Remains,"
Kidder tells the true story of a
refugee from Burundi who, after
fleeing to New York and living
homeless in Central Park while
working to deliver groceries, eventu
ally endured to find his way to med
ical school and to return to open a
clinic in Burundi.
The three authors each discussed
the accidental origins of their works,
their roles as storytellers and their
feelings of obligation to tell the sto
ries of the disenfranchised, whether
through journalistic writing or fic
tion.
Both Fadiman's and Kidder's
works offer glimpses of different cul
tures, while Oates' short story chal
lenges the reader to consider the
human predicament through a tragic
twist.
"The books were very education
al in a world-view sense," said Kemar
England 'l4. "To get that insight was
very beautiful."
After a series of questions from
Satz, freshmen asked the the authors
their own questions and explored the
common themes among the works.
"I thought the authors all shared
a common ground and could relate
to one another, which made the dis
cussion more meaningful," said Vic
toria Virasingh 'l4.The event "wasn't
as shocking or impactful as Faces or
Discover Stanford," she said. "How
ever, the themes in these books re
minded us why we're here and what
we hope to accomplish."
Some freshmen, including Katie
Sandling and Kristy Henrich, were
left with a desire to read the rest of
Oates' collection, "Will You Always
Love Me?"
Others appreciated hearing how
each author approaches the art of
writing.
"I enjoyed the insights into the
actual writing process," said Robin
Woodby 'l4.
Vanessa Gallegos 'l4 and Ellen
Encisco 'l4 were simply grateful to

have such close proximity to the au
thors. "It's cool that we can come
here and be in the same room," said
Encisco.
The annual Three Books discus
sion offered each member of the

Class of 2014, as Dean of Freshmen
and Undergraduate Advising Julie
Lythcott-Haims 'B9 said in her clos
ing remarks, a chance "to open your
mouth [and] ask your own question."
Lythcott-Haims encouraged fresh

men to continue this process at Stan
ford and "wring every drop out of
what we offer you."
