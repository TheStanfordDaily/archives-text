# New admission director lands
## Former Cal admission chief starts at Farm, emphasizes "the Stanford message" 
### TROY YANG STAFF WRITER 
Robert Patterson, former deputy direc
tor of undergraduate admission at UC-
Berkeley, began his new job as Stanford di
rector of admission last week following the
departure of former Director Shawn Ab
bott in May.

Prior to his post at UC-Berkeley, Patter
son worked with admission staff at the
University of Pittsburgh and the Universi
ty of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. At
Berkeley, he oversaw the review of more
than 50,000 freshman applications and
15,000 transfer applications.
'Although I'm relatively young in this
profession, I've had a lot of good experi
ences and mentors that have helped guide
me to what I wanted to be," said Patterson,
34.

His career in the field of admission
began at the University of Pittsburgh,
where he started as an admission and fi
nancial aid counselor responsible for re
cruiting and reading applications from
New Jersey.

Patterson stayed with the University of
Pittsburgh admission office for seven
years. During that time, he also earned a
master's degree in education. He is cur
rently conducting research for his Ph.D. on
alumni volunteering and involvement in
the admission process.

After Pittsburgh, Patterson left to serve
as associate director for recruitment at
Chapel Hill, where he stayed for a year and
a half before moving on to his post at
Berkeley in 2009. That was his last stop be

fore coming to Stanford to replace Abbott,
who left to become assistant vice president
of admission at New York University.
As the new director of admission, Pat
terson is responsible for directing the daily
operations of the undergraduate admis
sion and financial aid office. He will play an
important role in shaping the direction of
the University's admission initiatives and
programs, such as the burgeoning alumni
interview program and the recent financial
aid initiatives.

"That's one of the things I want to do
here," he said. "The staff here is extremely
talented, extremely diverse, very well edu
cated, and I want to get them to do similar
types of things that I was able to do in the
career and pursue those opportunities to
become the gold standard for admission
offices."

Patterson also expressed interest in un
derstanding the experiences of undergrad
uate students, something that he empha
sized was essential to his job as the direc
tor. He said it involves speaking with
Housing and various student groups.
"We are looking at ways to get involved
with the student community through ad
mission associates, who are current stu
dents," he said. "We are trying to engage
our staff in cultural and athletic events, for
example, so we can understand what stu
dents are doing."
It's important "because we are the face
of the University," he said. "We are the
ones going out giving the Stanford mes
sage, and we need to know the student sto-
