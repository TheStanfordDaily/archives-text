# DEACON BLACKOUT
## Cardinal hangs 68 points on Wake Forest 
### KABIR SAWHNEY MANAGING EDITOR â€“ Lizzy Collins contributed to this report 
In yet another show of force, the
No. 16 Stanford football team man
handled visiting Wake Forest on Sat
urday night. The Cardinal (3-0, 1-0
Pac-10) was an unstoppable force,
completely overwhelming the
Demon Deacons (2-1, 1-0 ACC) on
every front. The game ended in a 68-
24 victory for Stanford, the Cardinal's
highest point total in 42 years.
For the second straight week, the
Card was able to significantly exceed
expectations against a respected op
ponent from a BCS conference. Last
week, Stanford traveled to UCLA
and handed the Bruins a 35-0 loss,
and while the Cardinal was an 18-
point favorite against the Deacons,
the way it methodically dominated
the game suggests that its Pac-10 title
prospects look very rosy.
"We were very motivated, espe
cially after last year," said redshirt
sophomore quarterback Andrew
Luck. "We knew Wake Forest was a
great team that could put up a lot of
points, and we knew we really had to
light the scoreboard up if we wanted
to beat them."
While the Cardinal did blow out
Wake Forest, it took a little while for

the team to fully find its rhythm. Stan
ford's defense forced the Deacon of
fense, led by freshman quarterback
Tanner Price, into an early three-and
out, giving its offense a chance to gain
an early edge.
Luck seized that chance, driving

GAME NOTES: Stanford is coming off three
straight wins, all by 35 points or more. Notre
Dame won its first game of the season, but fell
in its last two contests to Michigan and Michi
gan State. The game will be Stanford's only
game away from the West Coast this season.

Redshirt sophomore quarterback Andrew Luck scampers 52 yards for a
touchdown in the second quarter. Luck tied his career high with four passing touchdowns.
down the field and hitting junior re
ceiver Chris Owusu in the end zone
to give the Card an early 7-0 lead.
Owusu said he was feeling "close
to 100 percent" recovered from the
injury that kept him out of Stanford's
first two contests.
"Our training staff did a great job
with me," he said. "They never pres
sured me to come back early."
However, the Demon Deacon of
fense took the ball on its next posses
sion and appeared ready to match
Luck and his unit point for point.
Running a spread-option attack,
Price used a number of successful
fake handoffs to open up holes in the
Stanford defense (which wasn't
helped by penalties and mistakes),
and the drive culminated in a 22-yard
reverse touchdown run by wideout
Chris Givens to tie the score at seven
apiece.
Unfortunately for Wake Forest,
that score would mark the last time it
was at all competitive in the game.
On the ensuing kickoff, redshirt
freshman running back Usua
Amanam took the ball back 60 yards
to the Wake 38-yard line. The return
set up a lightning-quick scoring
strike from Luck, who hit Owusu in
the end zone on the second play from
scrimmage. Stanford went up 14-7
and never looked back.

The next two drives, one for Wake
and one for Stanford, firmly cement
ed the Cardinal's superiority for the
remainder of the game. After the
Owusu touchdown catch, Price and
his offense returned to the field but
were quickly shut down by the Stan
ford defense. The Cardinal's front
seven swarmed the offensive line,
putting pressure on Price and effec
tively neutralizing the Wake Forest
running game. A crucial sack by red
shirt sophomore linebacker Chase
Thomas on third down forced the
Deacons into a punt, giving Stanford
the ball back near the end of the first
quarter.

On the ensuing drive, Stanford's
offense showed that it was not entire
ly reliant on Luck and the passing
game to move the ball against Wake
Forest. Sophomore running back
Tyler Gaffney was featured on the
drive and went for some punishing
runs against the Deacon defense,
eventually punching the ball into the
end zone for a touchdown (the first
of two on the night for him).
The remainder of the game saw
the Cardinal continue to pound the
Deacons, both on the ground and

through the air. Gaffney's touch
down was the first of four straight
touchdowns in the second quarter,
only answered by a long Deacon
field goal as time expired at the end
of the half. The Cardinal entered the
locker room with an insurmountable
41-10 lead, hastening the exodus of
fans from Stanford Stadium.
After two more touchdowns in
the first four minutes of the third
quarter, Stanford head coach Jim
Harbaugh pulled his starters from
the game on both sides of the ball
at that point, the Cardinal command
ed a 55-10 lead over the Demon Dea
cons after scoring eight touchdowns
(with one missed extra point). Wake
Forest did manage two more touch
downs in the third quarter, but it was
too little and too late. Stanford ended
up scoring twice more in the fourth
quarter, ending the game with 10
touchdowns to three and a field goal
for the Deacons.

Throughout the game, Stanford's
offense answered all remaining
doubts about its ability to put up
points on its opponents. The rushing
attack, which has been doubted be
cause of its "running back by com
mittee" approach, bulldozed over
the Wake Forest defense, notching
303 yards on 38 carries. Notably, no
player had more than eight carries,
indicating that Harbaugh will contin
ue using this approach for the fore
seeable future, rather than selecting
a single back to feature in the of
fense.

"The running backs had a heck of
a game," Harbaugh said. "We did a
great job up front."
Luck was also very impressive, re
inforcing his Heisman candidacy and
dispelling all doubts about his lead
ership abilities. Statistically, Luck
went 17-23 for 207 yards passing and
four touchdowns, and added 69 rush
ing yards (including a 52-yard scram
ble for a touchdown).
Afterward, Harbaugh had noth
ing but praise for his quarterback.
"Luck played a flawless game," he
said.

Similar to the running attack.
Luck has not yet found a single "go
to" receiver: no receiver had more
than three catches, and 11 players
had at least one catch over the course
of the game. Senior receiver Ryan
Whalen, who has been Luck's top re
ceiver to date, was injured in the first
quarter however, early reports in
dicate that Whalen suffered a hyper
extended elbow, a relatively minor

injury, and should return to the depth
chart soon.

While the offense ran up the
score, Stanford's defense turned in
another stellar performance. Before
the starters were taken out, the de
fense only surrendered 10 points to a
Deacon offense that entered the
game ranked in the top five national
ly in points scored and yards gained.
Wake quarterback Tanner Price was
effectively bottled up, limited to 8-18
passing for 76 yards. The running at
tack was also limited though it
gained 207 yards, it was on 53 carries,
for a low 3.9 yards per carry. Price
himself took 16 carries for just 65
yards and was the Deacons' leading
rusher.

"Our defense did a great job of
holding their offense," Luck said. "It
was a good team effort, and the chips
fell our way tonight."
Beyond the stat sheet, both the
front seven and the secondary
played impressively throughout the
night. Junior defensive back Michael
Thomas emerged as a star for the
second consecutive game, notching
seven solo tackles through the game.
Linemen and linebackers were also
constantly in the backfield, pressur
ing Price into making poor decisions
and throws, one of which led to an
Austin Yancy interception. The de
fensive linemen junior Max Masi
filo, senior Sione Fua and senior
Brian Bulcke were especially ef
fective, winning the battle on the line
of scrimmage and exposing an over
matched Demon Deacon offensive
line.

Sophomore linebacker Shayne
Skov, who missed Stanford's first two
games due to an infection in his knee,
returned to the field against the
Demon Deacons. While he was a key
to the defensive effort, he still ap
pears to be somewhat limited and has
not fully returned to his pre-injury
form.

Stanford's next game will be its
last nonconference contest, on the
road at Notre Dame. The Fighting
Irish are 1-2 in the first season for new
head coach Brian Kelly, including a
close 34-31 loss against Michigan
State in overtime on Saturday. The
game is scheduled for 12:30 p.m. PST,
and will be televised on NBC.
