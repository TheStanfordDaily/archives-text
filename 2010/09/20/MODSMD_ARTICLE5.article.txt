# DEACON BLACKOUT
## Cardinal hangs 68 points on Wake Forest 
### KABIR SAWHNEY MANAGING EDITOR â€“ Lizzy Collins contributed to this report 
In yet another show of force, the
No. 16 Stanford football team man
handled visiting Wake Forest on Sat
urday night. The Cardinal (3-0, 1-0
Pac-10) was an unstoppable force,
completely overwhelming the
Demon Deacons (2-1, 1-0 ACC) on
every front. The game ended in a 68-
24 victory for Stanford, the Cardinal's
highest point total in 42 years.
For the second straight week, the
Card was able to significantly exceed
expectations against a respected op
ponent from a BCS conference. Last
week, Stanford traveled to UCLA
and handed the Bruins a 35-0 loss,
and while the Cardinal was an 18-
point favorite against the Deacons,
the way it methodically dominated
the game suggests that its Pac-10 title
prospects look very rosy.
"We were very motivated, espe
cially after last year," said redshirt
sophomore quarterback Andrew
Luck. "We knew Wake Forest was a
great team that could put up a lot of
points, and we knew we really had to
light the scoreboard up if we wanted
to beat them."
While the Cardinal did blow out
Wake Forest, it took a little while for

the team to fully find its rhythm. Stan
ford's defense forced the Deacon of
fense, led by freshman quarterback
Tanner Price, into an early three-and
out, giving its offense a chance to gain
an early edge.
Luck seized that chance, driving
