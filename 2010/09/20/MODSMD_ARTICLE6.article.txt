## Stanford can bet on grades New website allows for "grade gambling"; University officials "appalled" by practice 
### ELIZABETH ROSEN STAFF WRITER 
Think you can get an A in IHUM? Want to make a bet?
That's what New York-based website Ultrinsic.com lets stu
dents do. The grade-gambling service offers up to $2,000 on grad
uation day to a student who wagers $2O at the beginning of fresh
man year that he or she will finish college with a 4.0 GPA and fol
lows through.
But that's the longest shot (and biggest payout) available on
the website, Ultrinsic, founded by Queens College graduates
Steven Wolf and Jeremy Gelbart, is a Web-based college plat
form that provides incentives to students for academic achieve
ment with wagers beginning at $lO per course.
The site serves 36 schools in the United States, including Stan
ford. The student must go to the site, upload his or her course
schedule and give the site permission to look into his or her
school records. Students are not required to provide their aca
demic login information and have the option to manually enter
courses into the system.
At term's end, the student mails in his or her official transcript
as proof of grades earned, and Ultrinsic credits that student's ac
count accordingly.
For example, a student hoping to get an A- or higher in a class
can bet $lOO that he or she will do so. The company will con
tribute another $lOO. If the student gets the wagered grade or
higher, he or she receives $200; if the student doesn't get the
grade, the company keeps the student's $lOO.
Students are responsible for any discrepancies between their
academic history and class schedule as displayed on Ultrinsic and
those on official record at their school. Ultrinsic may charge a $5
fee per discrepancy. Additionally, Ultrinsic's policies include
sending an IRS Form 1099 to anyone who earns more than $6OO
on the site in any given year.
Still, the legality of wagering
money on grades is ambiguous.
Debra Zumwalt, vice president and
general counsel for Stanford Univer
sity, wrote in an e-mail to The Daily
that although Stanford has not yet
looked into the legality of the web

site, she hopes "students are smart
enough that they would not use it."
Most states have outlawed betting
on "unlicensed games of chance " but
Ultrinsic's founders argue that be
cause the outcome depends on the
skill and effort of the bettor, the web
site does not qualify as a game of
chance and therefore does not consti
tute gambling.
A site spokesperson last week did
not return The Daily's request for
comment.
Ultrinsic is earning consternation

of university officials across the Unit
ed States, some of whom emphasize
that their schools, regardless of their
presence on the site's list of partici
pating universities, are not affiliated
with the site.

Lisa Lapin, assistant vice presi
dent for Stanford University commu
nications, told the Wall Street Journal
that Stanford officials were "ap
palled" by Ultrinsic's motivational
methods and that she feels the entire
concept of betting on grades is "con
trary to academic development."

When he first heard about Ultrin
sic. Dean Richard Sailer of the
School of the Humanities and Sci
ences said although he didn't think it
should be immediately suppressed,
he does not think it is a good idea.
"It adds pressure to grade infla
tion, [and] it will make grades in
creasingly meaningless," Sailer said
in an e-mail to The Daily.
University Registrar Tom Black
said in a written statement that he
would compare Ultrinsic to betting
on athletic events and, by extension,

the site is comparable to athletes bet
ting on their own performances on
the field.
Black added that the short-term
financial gains offered by the site are
"corrupting to one's development,
purposes and spirit" and are not in
line with the University's core val
ues.

Officials at Pennsylvania State
University denounced Ultrinsic as
"dangerous gambling" and have
threatened the site with legal action if
it attempts to access students' per

sonal information.
Last year, Ultrinsic facilitated wa
gers by 600 students from two col
leges. Since the website's expansion
in August, more than 1,000 new stu
dents have registered. Although it is
currently only available to under
graduates in the United States, Ul
trinsic has plans to expand interna
tionally and to graduate students in
the future.
