## Stanford can bet on grades New website allows for "grade gambling"; University officials "appalled" by practice 
### ELIZABETH ROSEN STAFF WRITER 
Think you can get an A in IHUM? Want to make a bet?
That's what New York-based website Ultrinsic.com lets stu
dents do. The grade-gambling service offers up to $2,000 on grad
uation day to a student who wagers $2O at the beginning of fresh
man year that he or she will finish college with a 4.0 GPA and fol
lows through.
But that's the longest shot (and biggest payout) available on
the website, Ultrinsic, founded by Queens College graduates
Steven Wolf and Jeremy Gelbart, is a Web-based college plat
form that provides incentives to students for academic achieve
ment with wagers beginning at $lO per course.
The site serves 36 schools in the United States, including Stan
ford. The student must go to the site, upload his or her course
schedule and give the site permission to look into his or her
school records. Students are not required to provide their aca
demic login information and have the option to manually enter
courses into the system.
At term's end, the student mails in his or her official transcript
as proof of grades earned, and Ultrinsic credits that student's ac
count accordingly.
For example, a student hoping to get an A- or higher in a class
can bet $lOO that he or she will do so. The company will con
tribute another $lOO. If the student gets the wagered grade or
higher, he or she receives $200; if the student doesn't get the
grade, the company keeps the student's $lOO.
Students are responsible for any discrepancies between their
academic history and class schedule as displayed on Ultrinsic and
those on official record at their school. Ultrinsic may charge a $5
fee per discrepancy. Additionally, Ultrinsic's policies include
sending an IRS Form 1099 to anyone who earns more than $6OO
