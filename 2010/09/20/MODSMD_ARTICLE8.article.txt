## Junior creates YouTube Instant Following quick site launch, YouTube CEO tweets job offer 
### IVY NGUYEN DESK EDITOR 
Feross Aboukhadijeh 'l2 made
headlines last week after creating
You Tube Instant, modeled after the
new Google Instant, which allows
search results to pop up with each
new letter typed by the user.
On Thursday, Sept. 9, Aboukhadi
jeh worked on his site for only a few
hours before posting it on his Face
book page. The next morning, he
awoke to a media frenzy, including in
terview requests from The Washington
Post but even more surprising, he
discovered a job offer from You Tube
CEO Chad Hurley on Twitter.
The Daily sat down with
Aboukhadijeh shortly after his job
offer went viral.
Stanford Daily (SD): Where did
the idea for You Tube Instant come
from?
Feross Aboukhadijeh (FA): I
watched the announcement of
Google Instant about a week ago.
After they announced it, I thought to
myself, "Wouldn't it be cool if you
could do the same thing with videos?"
It just started out as a random idea.
SD: So how did you create
You Tube Instant so quickly?
FA: The reason why I was able to

do it so quickly was because I've done
other websites in the past, and
You Tube has this easy-to-use, really
powerful API application pro
gramming interface. It's pretty easy to
take some of their functionality and
build upon it and do really cool things
with it. My work was actually just the
glue that fits in between all the
You Tube videos and the user who's
visiting my site.
SD: What did you think when
You Tube CEO Chad Hurley offered
you a job?
FA: I thought, "Is this for real?" I
mean, who would offer me a job for
something like this, especially over
Twitter? Was this some kind of joke?
But he e-mailed me, and we set up a
meeting for last Monday. We met over
lunch, and we talked for a couple of
hours about what he thought about
the site. He's really excited about the
idea of potentially adding it to
You Tube.com so that people would
be able to search instantly, but it's
pretty complicated, and probably
won't be easy to do.
SD: What's the plan now, and have
you received any other offers since?
FA: I have a couple more days to
decide what I want to do, but I think
I'll finish up my internship at Face
book over the next month, then I'll
work at You Tube part-time during
the school year try to take classes at
the same time. As for job offers, I've
been getting e-mails from people with
startups who are looking for pro
grammers, but nothing as interesting

as the You Tube offer.
SD: What kind of feedback is
You Tube Instant getting?
FA: I've been getting mostly posi
tive feedback, and honestly, it's sur
prised me a lot because before this, I
thought people on the Internet were
generally mean people, I mean, if you
look at the comments on any news
site, people are just really nasty to
each other. They've been saying that
they really like it, that they really feel
like it helps them browse You Tube
faster. I didn't think that people were
going to use it that much, but I guess I
was wrong.
SD: What kind of audience did you
have in mind when you created this
site?
FA: I think if you're in a particular
mode where you have time to kill and
you're looking to be entertained, my
site works perfectly for that. That au
dience might have a general idea of
what they want to watch, and they'll
start typing in whatever they might
want to watch, but they'll be distract
ed with what they type, because
they'll be shown a different video with
each letter that they type. It all unites
these interesting videos and distrac
tions on their way to their destination,
and if you're in the mode of discovery
rather than searching for an exact
video that you want to watch, then my
site's perfect for that.
