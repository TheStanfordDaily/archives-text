## New e-Skin could match human skin 
### KATHLEEN CHAYKOWSKI DESK EDITOR 
Soon, robots may be able to feel
not emotion, but touch-related senso
ry information they capture through
an "e-Skin" Stanford researchers
have developed using an electronic
sensor that rivals the sensitivity of
human skin.
The e-Skin could be used in a vast
array of future applications, includ
ing prosthetic limbs, burn victims'
treatment, touch-screen displays
such as iPhones and iPads, and med
ical instruments that need to make
controlled incisions. The skin is sen
sitive enough to detect the landing
of a butterfly or small insect, and re
searchers say it could give robots
"feeling."
Furthermore, bandages could be
equipped with the sensors to ensure
they are applied with the proper
tightness. Sensors could also be incor
porated into steering wheels to detect
when a drunk or fatigued driver loses
his or her grip on the wheel, trigger
ing an alarm to alert the driver or au
tomatically slow down the vehicle,
said Benjamin Tee, co-author and
graduate student in electrical engi
neering.
Zhenan Bao, associate professor
of chemical engineering, has led the
research since the summer of 2005.
She has worked on the development
of flexible electronics for many years,
and the e-Skin project came out of
the intention to apply her group's
electronic expertise to robotics.
Tier team has patented the tech
nology and their work was published
on Sept. 12 in "Nature Materials."
The e-Skin is composed of a thin,
highly flexible layer of rubber sand
wiched between two electrically con
ducting layers. The researchers call
their rubber "micro-structured" be
cause it is molded into a grid of tiny
pyramids that number between sev
eral hundred thousand and 25 mil
lion.The grid's pores fill with polymer
when the rubber is compressed, fluc
tuating the rubber's ability to hold
electrical charge.
The rubber stores electrical charge,
and a change in pressure on the rubber
changes the capacitance of the rubber,
or the amount of electric charge the

rubber can hold. When the rubber is
compressed, the capacitance increas
es, and when the rubber expands, the
capacitance decreases. The change in
capacitance is detected by the elec
trodes, measuring the pressure on the
surface. The total thickness of the e-
Skin can be 100 microns or fewer.
Stefan Mannsfeld, co-author and
former postdoctoral researcher in
chemical engineering, said that by
using micro-structured rubber films,
the team was able to make the rubber
layer behave more like an ideal
spring.
The largest sheet of skin produced
so far is about seven square centime
ters, and the sheet has the ability to
wrap "like a sticker" around sharp
angles and curves, Mannsfeld said.
Other research teams, including
one at the UC-Berkeley, also have
been working on the advancement of
electronic sensors. However, while
the team at Berkeley essentially lam
inates a transistor with a pressure
sensitive surface, the Stanford team's
skin makes the transistor itself pres
sure-sensitive. The Stanford team's e-
Skin is more sensitive because of the
micro-structured rubber, which can
quickly rebound to its original shape.
"We started with transistor device
and said, 'Can we put something in
them to turn them into a pressure
sensor?"' Mannsfeld said.
Although the main components of
the e-Skin are biocompatible the
rubber is used in breast implants
Bao said the team will need to use
more biocompatible polymers and
surface molecules before the skin can
reach its full biomedical potential.
"In the future, we would like to
make these devices more skin-like,"
Bao said.
"Currently we make these devices
on plastic substrates, but the substrates
we are using right now aren't elastic
enough to enable them to behave like
what real skin is like ... We want to
demonstrate some of the biomedical
applications that these sensors will en
able in the future," she said.
The research was funded in part by
the National Science Foundation and
the Office of Naval Research.

The e-Skin uses sensors to detect pressure changes, mimicking human skin. Each of the pyramids in the
sensors, shown here under a microsope, is six microns, or about a tenth of the human hair diameter by
comparison.
