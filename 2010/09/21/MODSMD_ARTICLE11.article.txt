## GIRL YOU KNOW IT'S TRUE How to Get Admitted to Stanford 
### Jordan Carr 
Hello, freshmen! It is very possible that
this modern campus frightens and
confuses you, and for the most part,
you're going to have to figure those issues
out on your own. Sorry, but I've got my own
problems.
But there is one question I can answer for
you: how did that guy get admitted?
In some cases it is obvious: basketball re
cruits, straight-up geniuses and so on. But in
some cases you may encounter a fellow stu
dent who seems as if he couldn't find his way
out of a wet paper bag and can't dunk. How
did these kids get here? In fact, how did you
get here? Are you even supposed to be read
ing this?
Let's see. Anyone whose admission is a
mystery will generally fall into one of these
eight categories.
The Legacy
This guy may try to under-emphasize his
ties to the University, but considering his
grandfather was the bastard child of Herbert
Hoover and Jane Stanford, he was going to
get in.
The Richie Richington
If someone in your dorm has the same last
name as that dorm, it is rarely a coincidence.
So if you meet a Carey Arrillaga, Mabel
Maples or Donald Theclaw, that campus
landmark is probably named after him or
her.
The Athlete In an Obscure Sport
Though many sports do not offer scholar
ships, it's not uncommon for some kid to have
spent their childhood honing their talents in
fencing so that they could someday win the
privilege of eating at Wilbur or, colloquial
ly, Wilbo. (This will catch on.) While it may be
tempting to ask the Obscure Athlete about
his sport, just remember that you have made
it this far through life without ever deciding to
learn about synchronized swimming, and
there is probably a good reason for that.
The Kid Who Crushed the SAT
Stereotypically, this kid is supposed to be
a moody, withdrawn genius with poor social
skills, but she is just as likely to be a bubbly
blonde girl. It's very confusing for those of us
who would rather our stereotypes remain un
challenged.
The Person From a Weird Place
Wondering who that yokel is dancing to
"Cotton Eyed Joe" while wearing sus
penders and chewing a piece of hay? That's
the Class of 2014's West Virginia delegation
to be fair, I just told you I love stereotypes.
Stanford admission officers live for the fact
they can say students came from all 50 states.
Literally nothing nothing means more
to them. If that leads to ill-advisedly admit
ting a few Bristol Palins and Hannahs from
Montana, so be it.

The Person Who Already Accomplished
Something
These come in two types, usually. First, the
internationals. Perhaps she was a star in
Canadian soap operas, or a professional
Turkish cricket player. Now, having exhaust
ed the possibilities in their native land, it's
time to prove that the skills that led to win
ning "Ukraine's Got Talent" or whatever can
transfer to success in America.
Second, the olds. They have done some
thing so worthwhile with their lives that you
will never, ever be interesting to them. They
tend to say stuff like, "So there I was, a single
mother, and all of a sudden I had the number
one song in the country" and "I'll never for
get the time I accidentally wandered into the
DMZ. Who would have thought I'd be mak
ing love on a jet home with Bill Clinton two
weeks later?" They will one-up you no matter
what. Don't even try to compete.
The Progeny of a Famous Person
Generally, this is the type of famous per
son who you are more impressed with than
legitimately interested in. If meeting the
daughter of the secretary of agriculture or
son of the president of Latvia sounds appeal
ing, then you're in luck. If you want to meet
one of Madonna or Angelina Jolie's Malaw
ian adoptees, try elsewhere.
The Kid with Pointless Musical Talent
For reasons that remain unclear, an
alarming number of students here have a
musical talent. Rumor has it that when pre
vious Director of Admission Shawn Abbott
left, all the musically inclined but otherwise
unexceptional students gathered in Maples
and surprised him by playing his symphony
as he wept upon realizing he had an impact
on their lives after all. Or maybe that was
the end of "Mr. Holland's Opus." It's hard to
say.
Though these few explanations may not
cover every admission mystery (but it should
double check the first two if you still are
confused), you will meet every single one of
these people during your time at Stanford.
And if you want to find the money and
knowledge to produce a musical that re
volves around polo players in Idaho, every
thing you need is right here.
