## One More Year 
### Jade Wang 
Yesterday started in the same fashion
that a weekday has for years. My
alarm's insistent buzzing prompted
me to wonder why I, again, somehow lacked
the foresight to avoid morning classes. I woke
up groggily and stumbled around my room,
trying to get dressed quickly and quietly. I
completed my morning routine with one eye
closed and paused, standing on one leg like a
flamingo, to answer a silly e-mail on my
phone from an old friend. I slowly typed with
awkward thumbs and switched feet before I
remembered: being just "a few minutes late"
is no longer an easy and forgivable indiscre
tion for me.
Now, I ride the Marguerite to campus, and
if I miss my bus, the next one doesn't arrive
for half an hour, surely pushing my tardiness
into the "unacceptable" category.
Trying to catch my breath at the Mar
guerite stop reminded me again of how much
has changed. No longer did I see familiar
faces on my stroll down the Lower Row, but
instead tried to discreetly wipe off my fore
head sweat as I guessed the role of my fellow
Marguerite passengers: Med School staff
member? Engineering Ph.D. student? Defi
nite GSB student. I absolutely adore this
game, and my strife at having nearly missed
the bus melted away, along with my baffled
indignation that my 13-minute commute to
the Quad has become a 30-minute journey
with multiple legs.
I am a graduate student. I am a graduate
student. It is taking a little bit of time to get
used to.
To be specific, I am a co-term, and after
four years of living happily, intensely, gleeful
ly on campus, I have embarked on an adven
ture to branch out, grow up and move off
campus. As such, my life has become a study
in unexpected similarities and differences.
My days usually flit between feeling just like

normal one more year of the same won
derful Stanford and being completely jar
ring and disorienting a year spent in the
same geographic location, but completely
foreign in its happenings.
When I set up my laptop at a quiet-look
ing table to attempt to and get some work
done, the resulting fruitless search for an

outlet and inevitable Gchat bonanza com
pletely overshadows any productivity. It
feels exactly like the past four years. Staying
up too late with my longtime roommate
looking at cute things on the Internet is de
lightfully the same. Though we are suppos
edly bordering on real adulthood, vacuum
ing regularly is still not a desire that seems
to have set root in either of our hearts, un
fortunately.
While my hip friends are trying out life as
young professionals, I remain entrenched in
student life. Though we no longer complain
about classes together, and I have trouble
participating in the inaugural griping about
mundane office life, I still fall back into the
old habits and inside jokes. Even our beat-up
furniture that accompanied us through the
first four years of Stanford remains, lending
our new locales a sense of familiarity. It
would be eerie, except my insistence on per
sonifying all objects has made the coffee
table and faithful futon seem like old friends
who have been with me through a lot.
It's interesting to find myself in this in-be
tween place, when I thought I had so careful
ly engineered my life to allow me to avoid the
distracting nostalgia for my first four years at
Stanford. Initially, I lived in a state of minor
fear that some deja vu would launch me into
a sentimental sobbing fit, but increasingly, I
appreciate these echoes of my older life. It's
unexpected, and while I run for the bus and
learn to adjust to one more tier in adulthood,
I am also learning again about handling and
even embracing the unexpected. Unexpect
edness is difficult for people like me, people
with color-coded calendars, but I am begin
ning to understand that there is a lot for me
to learn outside of the plan.

My life as a co-term
has become a study
in unexpected
similarities and
differences.
