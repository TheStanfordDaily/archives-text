						SOLID START 
### â€” Daniel Bohm 
The No. 16 Stanford field hockey team
got off to a strong start this season, posting a
5-2 record before classes even began.
After decisive victories over Pacific and
UC-Davis (6-0 and 3-1, respectively) in its
first two contests of the year, the Cardinal
dropped a heartbreaker to No. 7 Michigan
State, 3-2. The Spartans traveled to the Farm
as heavy favorites, but were given quite a
game by the underdog Cardinal. Stanford
twice trailed by a goal, but got equalizers
from freshman forward Hope Burke and
sophomore forward Kelsey Lloyd.
With the game tied 2-2 with just over a
minute left, Michigan State got the decisive
goal from Kristen Henn to win it.
Stanford quickly rebounded from the loss
with three consecutive victories over Kent
State, lowa and Robert Morris, all in contests
played in Kent, Ohio. The lowa contest was
the most hard-fought of the wins, coming 2-1
in overtime. Junior forward Stephanie Byrne

knocked in the game winner to seal the win
for the Card.
The winning streak came to an end this
past Sunday with a 2-1 loss to NorPac rival
California. The Golden Bears squeaked by
the Cardinal with a goal in the 66th minute.
Stanford will have another shot at Cal this
season, though not until the final game of the
regular season on Oct. 29.
Through the first seven games of the year,
Byrne and sophomore defender Becky Dru
lead the Cardinal with three goals and seven
points apiece. In goal, junior Alessandra
Moss has started all but one game, and is 4-2
with a 1.33 goals against average.
The Cardinal now heads east for a two
game road trip. On Sunday, it will face North
Carolina in Chapel Hill, N.C., and will square
off against Wake Forest in Winston-Salem,
N.C., on Monday.
