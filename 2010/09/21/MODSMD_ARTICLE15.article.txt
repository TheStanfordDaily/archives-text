# Capital One Cup is bad for Stanford
## 
### Jacob Jaffe Fields of Failure 
During your first week at Stanford,
you learn a lot about the place
the names of the freshman dorms,
the amazing research opportuni
ties, the craziness of LSJUMB (and
what LSJUMB stands for), the Nobel laureate
professors, the extracurricular activities offered
on campus and the mind-blowing things your fel
low classmates have already done while you
were just struggling through AP tests.
What you might not learn unless you are a) an
athlete, b) an avid college sports fan or c) a loyal
reader of The Stanford Daily, is the unprecedent
ed success of Stanford sports. While other articles
can delve more deeply into the specific triumphs
of Stanford athletic teams (such as the 34 consec
utive years with an NCAA championship), I want
to focus on a particular award: the Directors' Cup.
The Directors' Cup is an award somewhat un
known to most people outside the Bay Area, and
that is not surprising considering how long it has
been owned by Stanford. The purpose of the Di
rectors' Cup, which is given annually by the Na
tional Association of Collegiate Directors of
Athletics (NACDA), is to honor the school with
the best overall athletic department in the coun
try. If this seems like a big award, it should. The
best overall athletic department in the country
should be a fairly important title.
Unfortunately, the award does not get close to
the recognition it deserves, and much of that can
be attributed to Stanford's dominance. The Di
rectors' Cup, which was originally called the
Sears Cup, was first awarded in the 1993-94 sea
son. Stanford finished second in the nation that
year, losing only to the University of North Car
olina. That performance was an all-time low for
the Cardinal, though, as Stanford has won the
award all 16 years since. Just think about that for
a moment: every year for over a decade and a half
(almost as long as this year's freshmen have been
alive), Stanford has had the best athletic depart
ment in the country, and for the last few years it
has not even been close.
Because the Cardinal has been so dominant
in the Directors' Cup standings, other schools try
to find ways to make their athletic programs look
superior. They talk about who wins the so-called
"big sports," which is code for football, and claim
that Stanford would trade all of its Directors'
Cups for one BCS title. While this argument is un
true to begin with (Stanford prides itself on hav
ing a broad-based athletics program), it has also
lost much of its impact as the Cardinal football
team has gotten better and better (see the 10-
touchdown performance against Wake Forest).
With few remaining options for knocking off
Stanford as the best athletics program in the
country, the NCAA took a drastic step â€”it
made a new award. The Capital One Cup will
debut this school year, and its website states that
it "annually awards the best men's and the best
women's Division I athletics programs." Sounds
familiar, doesn't it?
So if this award is so similar to the Directors'
Cup, how will it avoid the same dominance by
Stanford? Well, while the purpose might seem
similar, the Capital One Cup made some subtle
changes that seem engineered to keep Stanford
from winning every year. One clear difference is

that the Capital One Cup has separate awards for
men's sports and women's sports, while the Di
rectors' Cup combines the two. Stanford has a
very strong women's program (its 39 national
championships are the most in the country), and
it has sometimes carried the men's program in
the Directors' Cup standings.
The main way the Capital One Cup directly
hinders Stanford's success is by its tiering system.
The Cardinal traditionally does the best in sports
such as tennis (35 national titles between men
and women) and water sports (29 total in swim
ming, diving and water polo). Every sport counts
equally in the Directors' Cup, so Stanford's depth
gives it an advantage, but the Capital One Cup
rewards certain sports more than others. The tier
ing is done very nebulously; the website claims
that the tiers are "based on fan interest, school
participation and other factors." This essentially
means they were created arbitrarily, and there is
no doubt that the tiers hurt Stanford's chances.
Tier 3 sports count the least in the Capital One
Cup formula, and they include many that Stan
ford is a traditional or current power in, such as
tennis, goll) cross country and rowing. Mean
while, Tier 1 and Tier 2 sports include football,
men's basketball and lacrosse, which are all
sports that are unlikely to give Stanford many
points. Tier 1 sports count for three times as much
as Tier 3 sports, and Tier 2 sports count for twice
as much as Tier 3 sports, making a baseball or
football title count triple.
With this formula, Stanford still has a great
chance at the women's award, because the Tier 1
sports of softball, volleyball and basketball are all
successful Cardinal teams. However, there does
not seem to be much of a chance for Stanford to
overcome poor showings in the top men's sports,
even if it wins multiple national titles in lower
tiered sports.
While there is no way of knowing how much
Stanford's 16 straight Directors' Cups influenced
the decision to create a new award, the Capital
One Cup undoubtedly puts Stanford at a disad
vantage, particularly for the men's award. And al
though the Directors' Cup was a great achieve
ment for Stanford, it only consists of a trophy,
whereas the new Capital One Cup will give
$200,000 to both winning schools. Moreover, the
Capital One Cup has already received more pub
licity than the Directors' Cup ever has, and it will
be awarded on national television at the ESPY
awards.
An optimist might say that a new award like
this will only bring more publicity to schools with
great depth in their athletic departments. The
cynic in me sees an award whose board is made
up of people from schools like USC, Alabama
and Ohio State, which are traditionally very good
at the high-profile sports (that happen to be
worth triple in the Capital One Cup) and less so
at the lower-profile sports.
The Stanford fan in me only sees an award de
signed, as board member Lisa Leslie said, to "see
some other schools getting in there."

Jacob is looking over his shoulder, making sure
the big, bad people at Capital One aren't coming
to get him too. Tell him he'll be ok (or to watch
out) at jwjaffe@stanford.edu.
