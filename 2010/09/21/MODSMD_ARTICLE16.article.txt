## Card settles for fourth in NorCal Invitational 
### KABIR SAWHNEY MANAGING EDITOR 
Last weekend, the No. 4 Stanford men's water polo team
entered its second tournament of the year, the NorCal Invi
tational. The Cardinal (4-2) was highly successful on Satur
day, winning both of its matches over ranked oppositions to
advance to the semifinals. However, the squad couldn't
keep its momentum through Sunday, falling in two consec
utive matches.
Saturday's competition in Pleasant Hill, Calif., pitted the
Cardinal against two ranked opponents No. 15 UC-
Davis and No. 6 UC-Santa Barbara.
The Cardinal's first match of the day came against UC-
Davis, whom Stanford easily dispatched, 13-5. Nine Stan
ford players scored in the match, including a hat trick from
sophomore Travis Noll and two goals each from junior
Jacob Smith and senior Sage Wright. Stanford's defense was
also solid, with junior Brian Pingree making nine stops in
the cage.

GAME NOTES: The Cardinal will try to get
back to its winning ways in the SoCal Invi
tational which pits it against some of its
chief rivals: California, USC and UCLA.
Stanford hopes to stop a rare two-game
losing streak.
The second game of the afternoon
was much closer, but the Card even
tually prevailed 7-6 over the Gau
chos. The match was a tight, back
and-forth affair. Stanford seized the
upper hand early in the match, hold
ing a 3-1 lead after the opening
frame, but UCSB came back to tie it
at 3-3 heading into the break.
With eight minutes remaining in
the match, it was still tied, this time at
5-5. Stanford was able to pull away in
the final minutes to secure its 7-6 win.
Smith and Wright were critical again
to the Card, scoring three and two
goals respectively.
Sunday's action saw Stanford
move to the Spieker Aquatics Center
in Berkeley, where it faced No. 2
UCLA in the tournament semifinals.
Though it battled well against the
Bruins, the Card was on the wrong
side of the one-goal margin in this
contest, falling 10-9.
While Stanford's offense per
formed strongly against UCLA, with
a hat trick from junior Peter Sefton
capping the day, its defense was un
able to adequately contain a surging
Bruin attack. Pingree was only able
to make four saves throughout the
game, while his UCLA counterpart
stopped eight Stanford shots.
Tlie Cardinal's struggles contin
ued in the third-place game, when it
faced tournament host and current
No. 1 California. Its defense once
again failed to rise to the occasion,
and Stanford fell to the Golden
Bears, 11-8.

Stanford got behind early â€”it
was down 6-4 at halftime and was
never able to mount a credible come
back. Despite another solid offensive
performance from Wright, who had
two goals, the defense and Pingree
couldn't keep the Cardinal competi
tive. While Pingree managed eight
saves, Cal made 12 on the match,

more than enough to secure the win.
The Golden Bears ended the tourna
ment in third place, while Stanford
settled for fourth.
In the tournament's champi
onship game, No. 3 USC held off
UCLA, 11-10, to secure first place.
Stanford will now take two weeks
off before heading to the SoCal Invi
tational in Los Angeles on Oct. 2 and
3. The tournament is hosted by
UCLA and will feature some famil
iar foes, including the Bruins, Trojans
and Golden Bears.

Stanford's offensive attack has been plenty potent early on in the season. Nonetheless, the Cardinal still dropped close games to UCLA and Cal last weekend,
and will look to get back to its winning ways when it travels to Southern California for the SoCal Invitational in early October.
