## Card settles for fourth in NorCal Invitational 
### KABIR SAWHNEY MANAGING EDITOR 
Last weekend, the No. 4 Stanford men's water polo team
entered its second tournament of the year, the NorCal Invi
tational. The Cardinal (4-2) was highly successful on Satur
day, winning both of its matches over ranked oppositions to
advance to the semifinals. However, the squad couldn't
keep its momentum through Sunday, falling in two consec
utive matches.
Saturday's competition in Pleasant Hill, Calif., pitted the
Cardinal against two ranked opponents No. 15 UC-
Davis and No. 6 UC-Santa Barbara.
The Cardinal's first match of the day came against UC-
Davis, whom Stanford easily dispatched, 13-5. Nine Stan
ford players scored in the match, including a hat trick from
sophomore Travis Noll and two goals each from junior
Jacob Smith and senior Sage Wright. Stanford's defense was
also solid, with junior Brian Pingree making nine stops in
the cage.
