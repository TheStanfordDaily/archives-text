## Booting themselves into the win column 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH 
After falling from the national rankings
with four straight one-goal losses to open
the season, the Stanford men's soccer team
(2-4) finally got the monkey off its back with
a hard-fought road victory Friday night over
San Francisco (1-1-3). It returned to the
Farm on Sunday night with renewed confi

after a 4-1 triumph over Santa Clara (2-4) at
Laird Q. Cagan stadium.

defender Bobby Warshaw said it was "the

perfect kind of night to roll up your sleeves
and really go at it."

saw Stanford outshot by the Dons, but still
holding control over possession. In the 86th
minute, a giveaway by USF put Stanford on
the attack and a firmly-struck cross from
junior Alexander Binnie found senior Do
minique Yahyavi's right foot. Yahyavi slot
ted the ball past the keeper in the fog and
the defense locked down for Stanford's first

win of the year.
Redshirt freshman goalkeeper Jason
Dodson was kept busy all night by the Dons'
relentless aerial attack.
"Every guy [on USF] was huge," he said.
"They must have had four or five guys who
were at least 6'3" and their game plan was to
get the ball wide and cross it into the box.
The coaches told me before the game that I
