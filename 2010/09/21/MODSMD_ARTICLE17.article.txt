# MEN'S SOCCER
## Booting themselves into the win column 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH 
After falling from the national rankings
with four straight one-goal losses to open
the season, the Stanford men's soccer team
(2-4) finally got the monkey off its back with
a hard-fought road victory Friday night over
San Francisco (1-1-3). It returned to the
Farm on Sunday night with renewed confi
dence and emerged from the weekend as co
champions of the Bay Area Soccer Classic

after a 4-1 triumph over Santa Clara (2-4) at
Laird Q. Cagan stadium.
"Success breeds confidence," said head
coach Bret Simon after the win. "We are in a
much better situation psychologically as a
team."
A thick fog accompanied by light rain for
the game against USF turned the game into
a slugfest rough play from both sides re
sulted in 30 fouls and six yellow cards. Senior
defender Bobby Warshaw said it was "the

perfect kind of night to roll up your sleeves
and really go at it."
Eighty-five minutes of scoreless soccer
saw Stanford outshot by the Dons, but still
holding control over possession. In the 86th
minute, a giveaway by USF put Stanford on
the attack and a firmly-struck cross from
junior Alexander Binnie found senior Do
minique Yahyavi's right foot. Yahyavi slot
ted the ball past the keeper in the fog and
the defense locked down for Stanford's first

win of the year.
Redshirt freshman goalkeeper Jason
Dodson was kept busy all night by the Dons'
relentless aerial attack.
"Every guy [on USF] was huge," he said.
"They must have had four or five guys who
were at least 6'3" and their game plan was to
get the ball wide and cross it into the box.
The coaches told me before the game that I

would have to be very proactive in
order to be dominant in the air and I
couldn't afford to sit back on my
line."
Dodson finished the game with
his first career win and shutout.
Stanford kept its momentum
going on Sunday night, turning in an
other strong offensive performance.
Three different attackers scored to
propel the Card to its second victory
of the weekend.
A crowd of over a thousand came
to support Stanford and was quickly
rewarded as Yahyavi opened the
scoring early in the 12th minute with
a nifty breakaway off of a lobbed
through ball by sophomore Dersu
Abolfathi. Warshaw tallied his sec
ond goal of the year soon after with a
header from a Ryan Thomas set
piece, and the Cardinal was off and
running.
A spectacular Santa Clara free
kick found its way past Dodson be
fore halftime, and it looked like the
match was going to be close.
However, Stanford began to
widen the gap after the break. Abol
fathi opened his season's scoring ac
count after winning the ball from a
defender deep in the attacking half.
Yahyavi tacked on his third goal of
the weekend in the 83rd minute as
Stanford matched its highest offen
sive output in two years.
According to Warshaw, the team
never panicked after suffering heart
breaking losses early, which was im
portant for the team's psyche.
"We always knew we were there,
but we needed something to go right,
something to fall into place," he said.
"Early in the season we were trying
to find our personality as a team. It's
one thing to think about what kind of
team we wanted to be, but it's still an
other to find what kind of team will
win you games."
Simon is confident that the team
is getting closer to where it needs to
be in order to start winning consis
tently.
"We have good players, but that

doesn't mean we can just play the
way we want to and expect to win,"
he said. "We're good, but we're not
that good.
"We have to revamp our identity
so that we win the ball and defend to
attack," he added. "Our defending
has been terrific recently and that
has led to a lot of great opportunities,
but our mentality still has to be that

we are going to shut down oppo
nents. That will lead to our scoring
chances."
The Cardinal will have its first
chance to build on its recent success
when St. Mary's visits on Thursday at
7 p.m. at Laird Q. Cagan Stadium.
