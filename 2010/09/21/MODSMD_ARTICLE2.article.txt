## Tiews fills new arts position New role will seek to unify campus arts in itiatives 
### ANNA SCHUESSLER 
Stanford students who feel the Universi
ty's commitment to the arts is lacking have
new reason to be hopeful. Even though the
campus already enjoys programs put on by
the Stanford Lively Arts, the Stanford Arts
Initiative (SiCa) and the Cantor Arts Cen
ter, the sheer size and diversity of the stu
dent body present challenges to arts-orient
ed organizations working to foster an envi
ronment enthusiastic about the arts.
In fewer than two weeks, however, these
groups might be able to breathe a little easi
er with the appointment of Matthew Tiews
as executive director of the arts programs
for the School of Humanities and Sciences
on Oct. 1.
Tiews, who currently serves as the Hu
manities Center's associate director, will fill
and innovate the role of Karen Nagy, assis
tant vice president for the arts. Nagy's posi
tion was devoted to orchestrating the efforts
of the many groups dedicated to bringing
the arts in conversation with the Stanford
campus, among other responsibilities.Tiews'
appointment will ensure that the arts also
have a place in cross-disciplinary discus
sions as well as in the residences. The posi
tion's situation within the School of Human
ities and Sciences, in conjunction with its
physical office location in Wallenberg Hall,
signals a heightened interest in integrating
the arts into the average student's experi
ence.
"The idea really was to bring all of [the]
facets of the arts on campus together, and to
make connections between the teaching, the
research projects and the arts activities that
are happening on campus," Tiews said.
He sees his new position as an opportuni-
ty to find "points of connection and
collaboration" among the existing
programs. Having spent his under
graduate years at Yale,, Tiews has
memories of a slightly different col
lege experience of the arts.
"When I was an undergrad, prac
tically everyone no matter what
department had some hand in
art," he said. "It was like this 'let's put
on a show' mentality, which is some
thing that I really want to foster."
Tiews is well aware that the insti
tutional disparities between the two
schools make them practically in
comparable, though he does not find
the artistic impulses among Stanford
students to be lacking. He wants to
make engagement with the arts a no
brainer for students who are pas
sionate about studio art, perform
ance art, music and more. In his years
as associate director, Tiews has had
the opportunity to survey students
about their relationships with the
arts on campus, remembering that
their most emphatic desire was for
spaces in which they could create.
"Not only did we get responses
that indicated that students wanted
to be able to engage with artists, but
we would also get responses that

said, 'We want to have spaces where
we can do art,"'Tiews said.
The University and the office of
the vice provost for undergraduate
education have already expressed
new-found interest in investing in
the arts, especially in the residences.
Kimball Hall, under the guidance of
Jonathan Berger, has spearheaded
these efforts with the creation of
new performance spaces.
Students and arts groups alike
will benefit from the renewed sense
of energy the current associate di
rector will bring to the table.
"I see Matthew's role as a really
visionary step within the Universi
ty," said Jenny Bilfield, artistic and
executive director of Lively Arts.
"[He's] looking across all of these
unique entities and finding the
points of connection that we can't
necessarily see ourselves."
Bilfield, who sees Lively Arts'
role as bringing both the campus and
its surrounding community together
in the arts, considers the creation of
Tiews' new position an exciting step
in the right direction. As for Tiews,
his policy of encouraging student
input is as robust as it was at his pre
vious position.
"I'm still interested in input to see
what people have to say," he said. "I
hope my door will always be open."
