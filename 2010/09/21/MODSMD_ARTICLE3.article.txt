## PG&E top 100 list includes Junipero Serra pipeline segment 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Caity Monroe 
Following the Sept. 9 San Bruno pipeline
explosion, utility company PG&E released
on Monday a list of the 100 top pipeline seg
ments that "warrant further evaluation,
monitoring or other further action." One of
those top projects includes four sections of
pipeline along Junipero Serra Boulevard,
which runs through campus.
A Stanford spokesperson told locals not
to be alarmed, but said the University has
questions PG&E needs to answer.
PG&E "adjusted" the cathodic system
in the Stanford-area pipelines preventing
pipeline corrosion and said in 2009 the sys
tem "showed marked improvement." It still
appears on the list because of the threat of
potential corrosion and its status is listed as
"monitoring."
Die company says in the report it does
not plan "further action" at Stanford, but
spokesman Denny Boyles said at least one
more follow-up on the pipeline segments
would be conducted within a year.
Boyles on Monday discussed the list and
its implications, calling the list "a long
range forecast for engineers. The areas are
not in need of immediate help, but engi
neers will continue to survey and monitor
the segments found on the list, Boyles said.
He said the segments near Stanford's
campus were on the list "probably because
of the location of that line, especially its
population density and proximity to the
campus."
