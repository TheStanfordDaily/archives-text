## PG&E top 100 list includes Junipero Serra pipeline segment 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Caity Monroe 
Following the Sept. 9 San Bruno pipeline
explosion, utility company PG&E released
on Monday a list of the 100 top pipeline seg
ments that "warrant further evaluation,
monitoring or other further action." One of
those top projects includes four sections of
pipeline along Junipero Serra Boulevard,
which runs through campus.
A Stanford spokesperson told locals not
to be alarmed, but said the University has
questions PG&E needs to answer.
PG&E "adjusted" the cathodic system
in the Stanford-area pipelines preventing
pipeline corrosion and said in 2009 the sys
tem "showed marked improvement." It still
appears on the list because of the threat of
potential corrosion and its status is listed as
"monitoring."
Die company says in the report it does
not plan "further action" at Stanford, but
spokesman Denny Boyles said at least one
more follow-up on the pipeline segments
would be conducted within a year.
Boyles on Monday discussed the list and
its implications, calling the list "a long
range forecast for engineers. The areas are
not in need of immediate help, but engi
neers will continue to survey and monitor
the segments found on the list, Boyles said.
He said the segments near Stanford's
campus were on the list "probably because
of the location of that line, especially its
population density and proximity to the
campus."
The report says pipeline seg
ments are evaluated by potential
for third-party damage, potential
for corrosion, potential for ground
movement, physical design or a
combination of those factors. Stan
ford's four listed pipeline segments
are ranked at #56,60,61 and 62.
Stanford University spokes
women Lisa Lapin called the infor
mation released Monday "sketchy"
and said Stanford utility officials
have asked PG&E to have a follow
up meeting "very soon." The Uni
versity does not know the nature of
the pipelines' problems, how
PG&E improved them, why Stan
ford remains on the list or what the
concern is now, Lapin said.
"We're grateful that PG&E has
identified it and shared this infor
mation," Lapin added. "We don't
want anybody to be alarmed."

Concern following the San
Bruno pipeline explosion has led to
various efforts on the part of
PG&E to better implement and
communicate pipeline safety ef
forts. A request from the California
Public Utilities Commission led to
the publication of Monday's re
port. In addition, a hotline has been
set up for residents to call with in
quiries about their proximity to
pipelines. Its number is 1-888-743-
7431.
