# Facebook film hits campus
## "The Social Network" screening and Q&A address film's portrayal of Web protagonists 
### LAUREN WILSON DESK EDITOR 
Promoters for "The Social Network" are
hammering home Facebook's college con
nection, bringing the film back to campuses
that provided the inspiration and the first
users for the social networking site. The film
was screened at Aquarius Theater in Palo
Alto for a packed crowd of Stanford students
on Sunday night, followed by a question
and-answer session Monday with screen
writer Aaron Sorkin and actors Jesse Eisen
berg, Andrew Garfield and Armie Hammer
in Roble Theater.
"The Social Network" tells the story of
how Facebook founders Mark Zuckerberg
(Jesse Eisenberg), now the youngest billion
aire in the world, and his business partner,
Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield), creat
ed the world's most popular social network
ing website. Directed by "Fight Club" auteur

David Fincher, "Network" connected with
the enthusiastic audience, garnering laughs
with its surprisingly frequent dark comedy
and extremely loud whooping whenever the
film referenced Stanford either through
the characters or with details like Zucker
berg's Coupa Cafe cup in the deposition
room. The movie isn't afraid to delve into the
more unsavory bits of Facebook's origins,
which include sex, drugs and alcohol: the
Stanford University logo's first appearance
is on the backside of a half-naked coed's un
derpants.
"I thought it was pretty interesting," said
Carl Kelm 'O9. "I think the way they framed
it was unique but also it added to the story
telling ... we kind of know the story so it's
more about the relationships Mark Zucker
berg forms and, in some cases, destroys."
"I thought it was pretty cool," said Omar
Diab 'l4. "I don't know how much of ad-bag
Zuckerberg is but I though was pretty

harsh."
The three stars and Sorkin took part in
the question-and-answer session Monday
morning in front of a full Roble Theater au
dience, where Eisenberg channeled his char
acter in Zuckerberg's trademark hoodie.
Film and media studies lecturer Adam Tobin
moderated the event, beginning with a
thank-you to the cast for making Stanford
look good with the film's "unbelievably sexy
Stanford party."
Actors discussed the film's unique posi
tion of portraying real people in recent histo
ry but creating the film without the involve
ment of Facebook's creators.
"I've played real people before but
they've always been involved with a movie,"
said Eisenberg on portraying Zuckerberg.
"In this case, we were discouraged from
doing impressions of our characters so there
was no need to find and mimic Mark Zucker
berg ... Aaron's script invented this charac

ter. It didn't require much else."
"I just wonder how they'll feel about it, if
they'll watch it," said Garfield. "I hope he
[Saverin] thinks I'm ok or whatever."
They also discussed working with Justin
Timberlake, who plays Napster entrepre
neur Sean Parker in the movie, mentioning
going to the MTV Video Music Awards with
him in particular.
"It's like going to Disneyland with Mickey,"
quipped Eisenberg.
Sorkin, who arrived late, addressed accu
sations of sacrificing truth for Hollywood
glamour. He confessed that he was drawn to
the tale because of its Shakespearean themes
of friends, enemies and power.
"We were pretty serious about accuracy,"
Sorkin said, explaining that they even re
searched the kind of beer Zuckerberg was
drinking when he made Facemash.

"I don't think any of us...want [ourselves as] 19 years old made into a movie."

"Nothing was invented for sensa
tionalizing, for the sake of making it
sexy, for the sake of advancing a per
sonal agenda," he said. "If you saw it
in the movie, it's because someone
very credible or more than one
someone said it was credible."
Sorkin also claimed he doesn't
understand why people complain
that his screenplay portrays Zucker
berg as sex-crazed.
"I don't know what they're refer
ring to," he said. "There is less sex in
this movie than the first two minutes
of' Gossip Girl.'"
However, he does have some
compassion for the Facebook
founder. "I don't think any of us
would want the things we did when
we were 19 years old made into a
movie," he said.
