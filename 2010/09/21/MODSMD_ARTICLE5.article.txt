## Crothers plans for new global-citizenship theme 
### CAROLINE CHEN STAFF WRITER 
Crothers Memorial Hall joins the ranks of
themed dorms this year as a "global citizen
ship "-focused dorm. It aims to foster a com
munity of students interested in global issues
and, according to its website, help its residents
"reflect upon, and engage with, key chal
lenges of globalization and interdependence."
The idea for the theme started last January,
when Director of the Freeman Spogli Insti
tute for International Studies (FSI) Coit
Blacker started discussing the idea of a dorm
focused on global issues. Crothers Resident

Fellows Stephen Stedman '79 M.A. 'B5 Ph.D.
'BB and his wife, Corinne Thomas, successfully
applied for Crothers to take on that theme.
Stedman is a senior fellow at the Center for
International Security and Cooperation and
FSI. Thomas advises Stanford in Govern
ment.
The dorm will be formally tied to FSI, which
will work with Crothers to create opportuni
ties where students can meet and learn from
faculty, experts and visitors to campus. Some
of the speakers this fall will include John Pren
dergast, a prominent anti-genocide figure and
co-founder of the Enough Project, and Carlos
Pascual 'BO, the current U.S. ambassador to

Mexico.
Besides talks by professors and other
guests, students also can work closely with fac
ulty through the Crothers Fellow Program.
There are 14 fellows, including Larry Dia
mond '73 M.A. '7B Ph.D. 'BO, director of the
Center on Democracy, Development, and the
Rule of Law; law professor Tino Cuellar M.A.
'96 Ph.D. 'OO, who has served in the Obama
and Clinton Administrations; and history pro
fessor David Kennedy '63. The fellows will at
tend special faculty-student dinners hosted by
the RFs and interact closely with Crothers
theme residents.
In addition to the star-studded cast of fel

lows, students are encouraged to initiate pro
gramming, such as student-led courses, de
bates on international policy issues or interna
tional film screenings. Resident Stephanie
Liou 'l3, who pre-assigned to Crothers, said
that was something that attracted her to the
dorm.
"It's the first year, so we can essentially
make it what it is, so that was appealing," she
said.
Indeed, Stedman believes these student
led programs and student participation will be
key to the residents' experience in the dorm.
