## Crothers plans for new global-citizenship theme 
### CAROLINE CHEN STAFF WRITER 
Crothers Memorial Hall joins the ranks of
themed dorms this year as a "global citizen
ship "-focused dorm. It aims to foster a com
munity of students interested in global issues
and, according to its website, help its residents
"reflect upon, and engage with, key chal
lenges of globalization and interdependence."
The idea for the theme started last January,
when Director of the Freeman Spogli Insti
tute for International Studies (FSI) Coit
Blacker started discussing the idea of a dorm
focused on global issues. Crothers Resident

Fellows Stephen Stedman '79 M.A. 'B5 Ph.D.
'BB and his wife, Corinne Thomas, successfully
applied for Crothers to take on that theme.
Stedman is a senior fellow at the Center for
International Security and Cooperation and
FSI. Thomas advises Stanford in Govern
ment.
The dorm will be formally tied to FSI, which
will work with Crothers to create opportuni
ties where students can meet and learn from
faculty, experts and visitors to campus. Some
of the speakers this fall will include John Pren
dergast, a prominent anti-genocide figure and
co-founder of the Enough Project, and Carlos
Pascual 'BO, the current U.S. ambassador to

Mexico.
Besides talks by professors and other
guests, students also can work closely with fac
ulty through the Crothers Fellow Program.
There are 14 fellows, including Larry Dia
mond '73 M.A. '7B Ph.D. 'BO, director of the
Center on Democracy, Development, and the
Rule of Law; law professor Tino Cuellar M.A.
'96 Ph.D. 'OO, who has served in the Obama
and Clinton Administrations; and history pro
fessor David Kennedy '63. The fellows will at
tend special faculty-student dinners hosted by
the RFs and interact closely with Crothers
theme residents.
In addition to the star-studded cast of fel

lows, students are encouraged to initiate pro
gramming, such as student-led courses, de
bates on international policy issues or interna
tional film screenings. Resident Stephanie
Liou 'l3, who pre-assigned to Crothers, said
that was something that attracted her to the
dorm.
"It's the first year, so we can essentially
make it what it is, so that was appealing," she
said.
Indeed, Stedman believes these student
led programs and student participation will be
key to the residents' experience in the dorm.
"Whether or not this succeeds will
depend on the residents and what
they're willing to put into it," he said.
"We're going to go out of our way
to give them the resources to do a lot
of interesting things, so it's really up to
them to take advantage of it and show
some initiative," he added.
Stedman believes that the creation
of a global citizenship-themed dorm
is in line with Stanford's vision.

"I think it all has to do with Stan
ford's aspirations to be a global uni
versity and a global leader," he said.
"It goes to the heart of the Stanford
initiative and the fact that President
Hennessy made international issues
very prominent in terms of the Uni
versity's mission. What he [wants] is
for Stanford to take a leading role in
solving global problems ... what bet
ter way for undergraduates to get in
volved and think and debate policy is
sues than to build a house like this?"
In addition to extensive program
ming, the dorm is also particularly
well staffed. Besides the fellows,
there are four academic theme asso

dates, two juniors and two seniors
whose studies have focused on inter
national issues and who will assist
with the dorm's programs. There is
also a graduate resident academic
mentor, Justine Isola, who is a sec
ond-year graduate student in the In
ternational Policy Studies master's
program.
Many of the students in Crothers
are not international relations stu
dents but believe that participating in
the themed programs will supple
ment their education.
"Global citizenship is not neces
sarily something I've been involved
with so I felt like it might add some

thing different to my Stanford educa
tion that otherwise wouldn't have
happened," Liou said.
"I thought it would be fun to do
stuff outside of my major," said man
agement science and engineering
major Agnes Omega 'l2. "I've always
been interested in global issues and
stuff, so if I could figure out away to
force me to learn about them, I'm
down for that."
