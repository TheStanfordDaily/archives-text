## PREP TO Pep Residential assistants in freshman dorms reveal what goes on behind the scenes in staff training 
### JENNY THAI CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Ninety-five percent fun.
Five percent crisis." The
succinct job description
of a typical residential
assistant (RA).
While other students were savor
ing the delights that late summer
holds, on Aug. 26, the 2010-2011 RAs
moved back to campus, gearing up
for three intense weeks of RA train
ing. The training covers the basics in
dealing with dorm crises mental,
physical and social ones.
"One of the big issues is recogniz
ing conflict," said Christopher
Longyear 'l2, a Trancos RA. "That is,
if the residents are just letting it fes
ter and mediating conflict as well,
instead of just letting it explode. We

also learned a lot about taking care
of residents, such as diet, getting
enough sleep, etc."
An essential part of RA training
is not only learning to recognize
crises, but also practicing how to deal
with them. This is accomplished in an
activity called "Small Groups,"
where small discussion-based groups
of eight to 10 RAs from different
dorms get to role-play various situa
tions.
"Role play is one of the most effec
tive ways to practice," said Pooja
Bakhai 'll, an Arroyo RA. "It's the
closest you can get to reality without
actually doing your job.The situations
we practice vary in intensity, from
homesickness to being quiet and shy
to more intense issues, such as eating
disorders and sexual assault.
"Everyone takes it very serious
ly," Bakhai added.
Another advantage of Small
Groups is that RAs learn to cooper

ate and coordinate planning activi
ties with fellow RAs from different
dorms.
"It's definitely a great way to
know the other RAs better," said
Stephanie Garrett 'l2, aTrancos RA.
"It's nice to have resources all over
campus."
The main show of training, of
course, is New Student Orientation
(NSO). RAs, particularly those for
freshman dorms, put a lot of extra
time and effort outside of training
into ensuring the incoming class's
first taste of Stanford packs plenty of
energetic kick.
One such way is promoting dorm
community through dorm themes.
"We had about 45 theme ideas,"
Longyear said. "Trancos is hard be
cause it rhymes with absolutely noth
ing and the 'o' sound we could have
used sounds a lot like other dorm
names, like Arroyo and Cedro."
Although discussing dorm

themes and decor may seem frivo
lous and time consuming, the final re
sult is actually crucial to the fresh
man experience.
"It takes a lot longer than you
might think, especially painting,"
said Adrian Castillo 'l2, a Rinconada
RA. "We decorated pretty much
non-stop. It's a cool, kitschy thing we
do, and it's a big part of the freshman
experience, to come to a dorm all
decorated. It makes them feel more
at home."
Meticulous touches to dorm dec
orations aren't the only activities to
which RAs devote their time. In
order to accelerate bonding with the
incoming freshmen, freshman dorm
staff undertakes the daunting task of
memorizing every student's face,
name and hometown.
"We go on a lot of staff retreats,"
Castillo said. "There, we focus on
memorizing the faces of all of our
dorm's students. We use flashcards
with their pictures and practice with
them over and over."
Even then, this time-old method
is not as perfect as it seems.
"Sometimes when they arrive
with haircuts or look completely dif
ferent from their pictures, it throws
you off a bit," Castillo added.
It is also at these retreats that RAs
discuss and establish the rules of the
house, which they convey creatively
in skits and presentations for the
freshmen.
For instance, Junipero's skit was a
"Bad J-Romance" music video,
based off of Lady Gaga's "Bad Ro
mance."
"It's a little nerve-wracking," said
Jessica Rowe 'l2, one of J-Ro's RAs.
"You know, being dressed up like an
idiot, performing in front of all these
people you barely know. But it was
an overall hit, and we got a positive
response from our audience."
Despite the challenges laid out
before them, the dorm staff are en
thusiastic, ready to watch their fresh
men take their first steps as members
of the Stanford community and later
grow.
"I hope to make their year bet
ter," said Sarah Hennessy 'l2, a Tran
cos RA. "Or at the very least, not
make it worse."
For Castillo, things are off to a
good start.
"I'm already loving it," Castillo
said. "It's already surpassed my ex
pectations and it's only been day two
[of NSO]. We've got a good group of
freshmen this year and I'm looking
forward to it."
