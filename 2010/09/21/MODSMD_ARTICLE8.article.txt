If you could only eat one
food group for the rest of
your life, would it be
grains, meat, vegetables or
fruit? Hmmm. Meat? Fruit?
Meat? Fruit? Pasta!!
If I hadn't gone into acade
mia, I'd be: Working as a survey
researcher in the private sector by
day, drumming by night.
Primary Research Inter
est/Project: I study how Ameri
cans form opinions on political is
sues, when and why people be
come so passionate about an issue
that it becomes a major focus of
their thinking, how people decide
whether to vote or not in an elec
tion, how people decide which
candidates to vote for and how to
do surveys well to accurately meas
ure what Americans think and
want, so the public has a voice in
telling governments how to do
their work. A special focus for us in
recent years has been understand
ing what Americans believe about
global warming.


The Daily e-mailed faculty a short
questionnaire that strayed beyond
their work at Stanford. Here is a
glimpse into the personalities behind your professors.
