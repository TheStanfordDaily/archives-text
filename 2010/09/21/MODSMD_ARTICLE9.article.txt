## Same-sex census study fills gap in family research 
### CAITY MONROE DESK EDITOR 
In debates over the legalization of
same-sex marriage, the issue of child-rais
ing often arises in rhetorical form, but a
new study from Stanford recently added
to the conversation with empirical re
search.
Stanford sociologist Michael Rosen
feld's study published in August on same
sex families uses U.S. Census data to pro
vide important information to a previous
ly scarce body of research on the results
of same-sex parenting. The study, which
compared the rates at which children of
same-sex couples repeated a grade with
those of children of married heterosexual
couples, showed that the two groups of
children have essentially the same level
of educational achievement.
Rosenfeld's research helps address a
pre-existing lack of evidence on the ef
fects of same-sex parenting and infuses
the argument in favor of gay marriage
with further evidence,
"I recognized, in reading the literature
on same-sex marriage and court deci
sions and reading the briefs in those court
decisions, that there was a fundamental
lack of empirical research on children
raised by same-sex couples," Rosenfeld
said.
The research that did exist prior to
Rosenfeld's study was often derived from
a narrow sampling size and lacked the
representative legitimacy afforded by
Rosenfeld's use of the census. Opponents
of gay marriage have often used that evi
dence in their arguments. Claims that the
educational achievement of children of
same-sex parents was comparable to
those of married heterosexual couples
could therefore be disputed by those op
posing gay marriage or adoption on the
basis of narrow sample sizes or unrepre
sentative data.
"The problem was that people who
were opposed to same-sex marriage made
the argument that all of the empirical lit
erature on same-sex couples and their
children didn't amount to much because
we didn't have a real representative study
... and how could we endorse this social
change if we didn't know what the ramifi
cations would be?" Rosenfeld said.
"That was a big argument in the lit
erature and I saw it as my job to see if
I could find evidence in the census," he
said. "The census is the largest individ
ual-level data set that we have, and it
has a pretty good way of identifying
same-sex couples and the children liv
ing with them, and it had never been
used in this way. I took it upon myself
... to see if it could be used in this
way."

It turns out it could be. Rosenfeld's
findings help to de-legitimize at least
some of the claims against gay mar
riage and parenting. The study also
serves as an example of the growing
cooperation between the academia
and activism and the ways in which
scholarly research can significantly
elucidate often complex and biased
political debates.
"I thought that it might have an im
pact on some real issues that I care
about, and I thought it would be nice if
I could bring some evidence to this
issue where people have been calling
for data and have been unable to find
it," he said.

Rosenfeld also added that in issues
such as this one, a dichotomous dis
tinction between social science re
search and political activism may be
incorrect or misleading.
"We live in a political world," he said.
"Anything that humans are involved
in has a political dimension, so I'm
definitely aware of the political di
mension of it."
"I probably wouldn't have under
taken the research if I wasn't in at least
partly interested in the political events
of the day," he said.
