## Same-sex census study fills gap in family research 
### CAITY MONROE DESK EDITOR 
In debates over the legalization of
same-sex marriage, the issue of child-rais
ing often arises in rhetorical form, but a
new study from Stanford recently added
to the conversation with empirical re
search.
Stanford sociologist Michael Rosen
feld's study published in August on same
sex families uses U.S. Census data to pro
vide important information to a previous
ly scarce body of research on the results
of same-sex parenting. The study, which
compared the rates at which children of
same-sex couples repeated a grade with
those of children of married heterosexual
couples, showed that the two groups of
children have essentially the same level
of educational achievement.
Rosenfeld's research helps address a
pre-existing lack of evidence on the ef
fects of same-sex parenting and infuses
the argument in favor of gay marriage
with further evidence,
"I recognized, in reading the literature
on same-sex marriage and court deci
sions and reading the briefs in those court
decisions, that there was a fundamental
lack of empirical research on children
raised by same-sex couples," Rosenfeld
said.
The research that did exist prior to
Rosenfeld's study was often derived from
a narrow sampling size and lacked the
representative legitimacy afforded by
Rosenfeld's use of the census. Opponents
of gay marriage have often used that evi
dence in their arguments. Claims that the
educational achievement of children of
same-sex parents was comparable to
those of married heterosexual couples
could therefore be disputed by those op
posing gay marriage or adoption on the
basis of narrow sample sizes or unrepre
sentative data.
"The problem was that people who
were opposed to same-sex marriage made
the argument that all of the empirical lit
erature on same-sex couples and their
children didn't amount to much because
we didn't have a real representative study
... and how could we endorse this social
change if we didn't know what the ramifi
cations would be?" Rosenfeld said.
