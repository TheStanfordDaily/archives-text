## Ike's Place debuts to crowds, long wait 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY MANAGING EDITOR 
Ike's Place, a renowned Redwood Shores sand
wich shop, opened its Stanford location this month
after a summer of anticipation. Much like the now
closed original shop in San Francisco, the eatery has
marked its first weeks on campus with long lines.
Set in the new Jen-Flsun Huang School of Engi
neering Center, the store began its "soft" rollout on
Sept. 1 and had its grand opening celebration on
Sept. 20. It is the brainchild of San Francisco native
Ike Shehadeh.
The premiere was the end of an exhaustive
search and construction process that lasted more
than a year. Beginning in February 2009, a group of
students and staff, formally called the Science and
Engineering Quad (SEQ) Cafe Request For Pro
posals Committee, contacted 13 vendors to gauge
their interest in opening a Stanford location.
"We actually found Ike's Place on Yelp," said
Jackie Charonis, SEQ's director of operations.
By March 2009, the committee had unanimous
ly selected Ike's for the slot, with a target opening
date of Aug. 15. But after what was characterized as
"typical construction delays" with the new Huang
building, the premiere was set back to Sept. 1.
"We considered it on time," Charonis said.
The soft rollout, which lasted for much of Sep
tember, allowed time to sort out difficulties before
the school year began.
"There's always things that go wrong, so you
never want to plan a grand opening for the first day
you open your business," Charonis said.
Still, Ike's began to make its mark on campus: the
shop gave out free food on Sept. 8 as part of the
Huang building's inauguration celebration.
Such actions are part of Shehadeh's consistent ef
fort to maintain customer service.
"Ike hand-delivers sandwiches to you," said Lisa
Abdilova 'll, a customer. "You go to sit down and
he'll remember your name and what you look like,
and he'll run it over to you."
"We want to make people feel welcome," said

Shehadeh, 32. "We're there to make sure we're the
best thing to come out of Stanford, and that's saying
something."
He opened his first Ike's Place in October 2007
and immediately garnered fame for the quality of
his sandwiches and for the length of the lines
patrons were willing to endure to purchase one.
Shehadeh said customers are driving from San
Jose just to buy food from his Stanford shop. Ab
dilova, who has eaten at the original Ike's loca
tion, considers Stanford's store just as good as San
Francisco's.
Still, the opening has not been without its kinks.
Shehadeh expressed frustration with some of Stan
ford's inherent bureaucracy, which has, for example,
prolonged the process of connecting phone lines,
which Ike's uses for takeout orders.
"We're working within a building within a school
within a university," he said. "It's not good or bad,just
slow."
For now, Shehadeh is working on solutions to

minimize wait times, which can last upward of an
hour. He is beta-testing a smart phone application
that will allow customers to place and pay for orders,
then tell them when it's ready. It will also be available
on the Web.
"People won't mind waiting 50 minutes, or even
two hours, if they know they don't have to stand on
line," he said. "They can place their order, go to class,
then come pick it up."
Charonis said Ike's will soon stock a vending ma
chine at Huang with freshly-made sandwiches for pa
trons on the go.
Both Shehadeh and Charonis expect Ike's open
ing surge of business to sustain itself throughout the
year.
"Before, there was not a place on campus where
you could get that great sandwich," Charonis said.
"At Ike's, the sandwiches speak for themselves."
