## SENT FROM MY IPHONE Frat Parties Suck, but Go to Them Anyway 
### Peter McDonald 
Seriously, Stanford, what the hell? After
four hours of playing Tower Defense
while having AlcoholEdu open in the
other window, after having to sit through six
days of Camp NSO-induced flashbacks to
high school, where's the goddamn party? I've
been in classes for two days now.
That was the dominant part of my think
ing at this point freshman year, and the an
swer is, the party was at SAE on Monday
night, and it's at Sigma Nu and Kappa Sig on
Friday. However, if you're a freshman and
you go to either of those places this weekend,
you'll discover a baffling inversion of what
you were told throughout high school via
every college movie ever made. Namely, the
Party that Everyone Goes To is not fun at all.
The floor and general demeanor will resem
ble the New York Stock Exchange and the
scene around the keg will remind you of na
ture documentaries about the watering holes
at the Serengeti. You will leave after an hour
and discover the meaning of the phrase
"painfully sober."
By the end of week one, you'll become
thoroughly disappointed with the party
scene, especially because you'll discover that
the RFs will actually enforce quiet hours. If
you make the mistake of talking to any of
your friends who went to a liberal arts col
lege, you might start looking up transfer ap
plications. For all the self-congratulating we
do about our alcohol policy, it looks down
right Mormon compared to anything you
might find at Pomona or Swarthmore. None
of those places tacitly endorses drinking but
still hands out MIPs, or has a silly ban on
drinking in common areas that does more to
promote social exclusivity than anything
else.
But fear not, enterprising freshmen, be
cause even though it may not appear so at
first glance, Stanford does hold its own on the
party scene; it's just that the administration
wants you to work for it a little, which is for
eign territory for a lot of you. Even though
I'm sure a solid 16 percent of you were blast
ing "Shots" and "I Love College" on move-in
day, the larger 68 percent of you want to have
college stories that would put Bill Clinton to
shame but also find the presence of Keystone
Light to be a deal-breaker and worry that if
you black out twice it means you're an alco
holic (Note: It doesn't. It's never about how
much you drink; it's about how many prob
lems you cause. I went through a period jun
ior year when I couldn't remember how par
ties ended. What did that prove? Just that
none of my walks home were memorable).
To those within that one standard deviation,
I say to you: unless you join the Band, join
Gaieties, join an a cappella group that's not
Testimony, write for The Chappie or live in a

co-op, parties hosted by fraternities (not
sororities) will be your only reliable source
for formalized drinking, an inherent part of
the college experience since the founding of
the University of Oxford.
However, these are not the scary frats that
promote misogyny as a core value. Very little
to no porn is shot in any of the frat houses
here on campus. None of the punch will be
half Everclear. They're on the campus map,
which means they're not the Isla de Muerta
from Pirates of the Caribbean. There's no
sketchy line for uncool guys to wait in while
girls walk right by, and I am willing to bet a
completed transfer application to U$C that
not a milligram of Rohypnol is to be found
anywhere on campus, not even at SAE.
It turns out most frat bros just love Stan
ford and want to see it have fun; that's why
they throw those parties, so you might as well
go to them. You won't get carded except for
the three or four giant clusterfucks of the
year and any party hosted by SigEp. No one
at Stanford takes arbitrary rules that serious
ly unless they're about computer science.
Yeah, Keystone Light tastes like piss, but you
know what? You're not the first person to
discover this, so get over yourself. At most
schools of this size or larger, the concept of an
all-campus party, a.k.a. any one that advertis
es "SUID to Enter, 21+ to Drink," is practi
cally a thought crime these days. That said, if
you know of a party that serves better alco
hol and will have more of your friends at it,
feel free to go to that one, but don't choose
Sigma-algebra over Sigma Chi just because
the floor's sticky. Be the change you wish to
see in the world. That way, you won't come
home wondering if you really should have
picked Williams instead.

Still can 'tfind the party? E-mail petermc@stan
ford.edu and he'll bring it to you.
