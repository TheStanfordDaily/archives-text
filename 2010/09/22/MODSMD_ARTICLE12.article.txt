# LOOKING UP
## The 						Bigger Picture, Just Brighter 
### Nina M. Chung 
I have been doing a lot of thinking lately.
Actually, that sentence could be my life
synopsis. At this point, though, you don't
need my life story an introduction might
be more in order. So, hello! My name is Nina
Chung, and I spent the past summer reaching
levels of emotion that even I found com
pletely disgusting (that was part of the prob
lem). It tends to happen when I'm severely
challenged, and this summer was nothing if
not a triple-scoop sundae of surprise tribula
tions. Delicious.
As Stanford students, we especially have
gone through the trials. Why else did your
grocery-store cashier gasp with impressed
delight when your mom unleashed the Stan
ford news? Despite being small talk, the
deeper implication was that you sweat your
heart out and lost your mind a few times with
the objective of conquering high school. (On
the flip side, perhaps you're here because of
just the opposite: your pre-college career was
a relative cake walk.)
Thus, I know quite a few people who look
back on high school as the lost and unavoid
able years: The Era of Epic Suffering, or
something. That's just an example, though.
Think of the time you felt completely ig
nored, or irreversibly off-track, or really, real
ly cringingly awkward. Don't we usually look
back at our roughest moments and wish they
never happened? They're the ugly ink-blot
mars on our timelines that we're pro at for
getting due to lack of willing mental space.
And then, uh-oh: freshman year day one oc
curs, and the rate of disaster dramas and
crazy crises soars right off the charts. Right?

Where else over Stanford are we more prone
to encountering this quantity of young, ideo
logically-clashing almost-experts who are
dangerously self-aware? Or feel the worst
kind of loneliness when we're surrounded by
so many people? We get caught in these irra
tional moments of total despair. They spiral
on, seemingly forever, because that's inertia,
and our analytical brains are kind of crazy
big. (Ron Weasley [on seeing Dementors]:
"It's like I'd never be cheerful again") Any
way, most of that sums up to self-doubt.
Long ago, my Stanford essay explained
my life as a novel: I saw character foils, recur
ring themes and, most importantly, my child
hood struggles effecting eventual advan
tages. Overall, I've been blessed all my life,
and I'm unbelievably grateful. And not
but this past summer was my second-most
emotionally testing to date. (I'll leave that
first one a little mystery.) Certain unexpected
circumstances made a nice little spotlight for
facets of my personality that really disturbed
me. (I'm always in awe by our ability to si
multaneously be ourselves and get to know
ourselves.) But a developing two-and-a-half
month expose of that led to ... one of the

best summers of my life. It wasn't a course or
an internship or research. It was intensive
Nina Chung 101, free of charge.
It turns out I'm a Big-Picture Optimist.
Maybe it doesn't matter, because it doesn't
change anything substantial. Maybe it does
matter a ton. But, seeing as we're at the
front end of another (OMG!) lightning-fast
Stanford year, the main question is: who
knows how many horrid things are lurking
ahead? A mismatched major. A choking rela
tionship. A wilting self-confidence ... these
things will happen. We live in this beautiful
world where people are allowed to both pur
sue their greatest passions and crash into
other people doing the same exact thing. De
pending on the situation, we come away ei
ther smiling or feeling like we've been sneak
ily robbed of some security. (Bridget Jones
calls this "jellyfishing" when you have a
superficially super-friendly conversation
with someone who magically leaves you feel
ing like you're a total loser. Don't you hate
jelly fishers?) When the insecurities appear,
though, we don't always have to hate their
very essence. We can, maybe, await the good
part, even if it comes a bit/a lot later. I truly
believe things work out like that.
This sounds like a happy ending, and
that's because it is. I suppose if you're not into
good news, you might want to ignore this sec
tion for the next few months. But to everyone
else! I hereby welcome you to my very, very,
very first column.
