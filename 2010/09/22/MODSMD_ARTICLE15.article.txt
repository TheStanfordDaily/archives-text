# GEARING UP

### NATE ADAMS DESK EDITOR 
Playing at home with a full student body on
campus for the first time this season, the Stanford
women's soccer team will look to impress tomor
row night when it takes on Hawaii. The No. 2 Car
dinal (6-0-2) is riding a five-game winning streak
and is coming off a tournament in Santa Clara in
which it outscored its opponents 8-1 over two
games.

As the Cardinal heads into its match with the
Rainbow Wahine (2-7), no player has more recent
momentum than Christen Press. The senior for
ward leads an offense that has outscored its oppo
nents 21-7 over eight games by contributing a near
ly nation-best total of 10 goals of her own, along
with three assists. Most recently, Press had a five
goal weekend in the Santa Clara Classic that in

eluded a hat trick in the first 32 minutes of a 6-1 rout
of Pacific. With her performance, Press earned
recognition as both the Pac-10 Player of the Week
and TopDrawerSoccer.com's National Player of
the Week.
The offense may be putting up big numbers, but
the Stanford defense has also been turning heads in
the early games of this season. The defense has al
lowed less than a goal per game, and in its last out
ing it shut out a Georgetown team that had been
averaging 3.88 goals per game before last weekend.
"The defense is really strong right now," said
Stanford head coach Paul Ratcliffe, "Alina [Garci
amendez], [Courtney] Verloo, Annie Case, Rachel
Quon... we've had a lot of success with the back
line, and we're looking at different people in the
back line."

GAME NOTES: No. 2 Stanford is 6-0-2 and is coming off a
title in last weekend's Santa Clara Classic Tournament.
The Rainbow Wahine are coming to Northern California
on a four-match losing streak. The two teams last met in
2009 in Honolulu, where the Cardinal scored a decisive
6-2 win.

After success in the Santa Clara Classic, the No. 2 Stanford women's soccer team returns home and looks to extend its five-game win streak against
Hawaii. The Card has a deep lineup on both offense and defense, including this week's Pac-10 Player of the Week, senior forward Christen Press.

The newest member of the Cardi
nal defense is sophomore Courtney
Verloo, who played in all 26 games last
season primarily as a forward and
made the Pac-10 All-Freshman team.
The Tualatin, Ore., native, who scored
her first goal along with a pair of as
sists in her debut against Hawaii in
2009, has started all eight games as a
defender this season.
"Obviously it's a complete 180
from forward, but I think our back line
is awesome," Verloo said. "I'm in be
tween Rachel Quon and Alina Garci
amendez. They're just world-class
players, and they've helped me a lot,
helped me to adjust a lot. I think we've
come together pretty quickly as a
strong unit back there,"
Stanford has also displayed added
flexibility at the goalkeeper position,
with senior veteran Kira Maker shar
ing time with Emily Oliver, a fresh

man. Oliver has started two games for
the Cardinal and has played nearly
300 minutes compared to Maker's
445, and has posted a paltry .30 goals
against average.
"Emily's been incredible, and she
has a great presence in the goal," Rat
cliffe said. "And Kira's still there
knocking on the door she's an
amazing goalkeeper and she's had an
amazing career at Stanford, so we're
still looking at her day-to-day, along
with [backup goalkeepers] Lindsay
Dickerson and Aly Gleason. They're
all talented keepers and we're looking
at them all the time,"
Hawaii, a team Stanford defeated
6-2 last season, hasn't enjoyed the
same solid start that the Cardinal has.
The Rainbow Wahine hasn't won
since facing San Francisco on Sept. 3
and hasn't scored a single goal since
Sept. 5. In its last four games, it has
been outscored 16-1.
Ratcliffe, never one to rest on his
laurels (or his team's), does not plan to
take Hawaii lightly, however. Even
with a big game against No. 3 Portland
coming up this Saturday, the Stanford

coach says he won't make sacrifices to
prepare for future games.
"My first goal is just that we have a
good performance, and that we get a
good result in the game," Ratcliffe
said. "And from there, depending on
how the game goes, we'll make adjust
ments. But you can't take anyone
lightly. I know the coach of Hawaii,
[and] he's a good coach with a lot [of
good] players. I expect it to be a hard
game."
If the match proves to be hard
fought, Stanford may gain a slight
edge by finally having a significant
home crowd to back it up.
"It helps the team a lot I think it
motivates us to play our best," Rat
cliffe said. "Last year we had fantastic
crowds, so we're really excited to have
people come out, and we're going to
put on the best performance that we
can to excite the fans."
Thursday's match against Hawaii is
scheduled for 7 p.m. at Laird Q. Cagan
Stadium.
