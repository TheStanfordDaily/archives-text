### NATE ADAMS DESK EDITOR 
Playing at home with a full student body on
campus for the first time this season, the Stanford
women's soccer team will look to impress tomor
row night when it takes on Hawaii. The No. 2 Car
dinal (6-0-2) is riding a five-game winning streak
and is coming off a tournament in Santa Clara in
which it outscored its opponents 8-1 over two
games.

As the Cardinal heads into its match with the
Rainbow Wahine (2-7), no player has more recent
momentum than Christen Press. The senior for
ward leads an offense that has outscored its oppo
nents 21-7 over eight games by contributing a near
ly nation-best total of 10 goals of her own, along
with three assists. Most recently, Press had a five
goal weekend in the Santa Clara Classic that in

eluded a hat trick in the first 32 minutes of a 6-1 rout
of Pacific. With her performance, Press earned
recognition as both the Pac-10 Player of the Week
and TopDrawerSoccer.com's National Player of
the Week.
The offense may be putting up big numbers, but
the Stanford defense has also been turning heads in
the early games of this season. The defense has al
lowed less than a goal per game, and in its last out
ing it shut out a Georgetown team that had been
averaging 3.88 goals per game before last weekend.
"The defense is really strong right now," said
Stanford head coach Paul Ratcliffe, "Alina [Garci
amendez], [Courtney] Verloo, Annie Case, Rachel
Quon... we've had a lot of success with the back
line, and we're looking at different people in the
back line."
