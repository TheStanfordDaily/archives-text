# Blowouts: all what you make of them
## 
### Jack Duane 
If you've been following the
Stanford football team for
the past few weeks, you've
probably started to notice
that the Cardinal is damn
good this year. If you've actually
been watching the games, you've
probably been pretty bored.
Beating Sacramento State 52-17
to open the season was reassuring,
but it wasn't all that entertaining.
Stanford's 35-point beat-down of
UCLA, in the Rose Bowl itself ', was
impressive, but not all that memo
rable.
And alas, Saturday's late-night
thrashing of the Wake Forest
Demon Deacons was explosive, but
the Cardinal's 41-point first half left
Stanford fans wondering if it was
even worth staying around to watch
the second act. Harbaugh pulled
both the offensive and defensive
starters out of the game early in the
third quarter. And those Red Zon
ers who did stick around for all 10
renditions of "All Right Now" woke
up with sore calf muscles Sunday
morning.
Stanford's season thus far has
been heavy on touchdowns and low
on intrigue. The good and bad news
for Stanford fans is that the Cardi
nal likely isn't done with the
blowouts.
This weekend, Harbaugh and
the boys have a road date with the
Fighting Irish of Notre Dame. It's
possible Stanford fans will once
again find themselves watching a
game whose outcome has been
sealed long before the final whistle
blows. What the heck are you sup
posed to do when your team is too

good?
I'm here to suggest some ways to
stay entertained in the probable
case of any future Stanford football
blowouts. Think of a blowout like a
long road trip: it's all what you make
of it.
Nitpick: If you're going to watch
a blowout, you may as well become
a nitpicker. Be that douche bag. Any
good Stanford nitpicker is still pro
foundly bothered by the fact that
kicker Nate Whitaker missed two
extra points on Saturday. Try to find
a problem with the smallest of de
tails, and use powerful language to
convey your dissatisfaction to fel
low fans. "Wow! Did you see how
sloppy Luck's footwork was on that
drop?" you might complain to a
friend.
Get ahead of yourself: This strat
egy requires a good imagination
and access to a Stanford football
schedule. And it's not very hard. All
you need to do is find someone
who's willing to listen to you project
the results of e very game the Cardi
nal plays this year. Do take caution,
though: you might feel kind of stu
pid if Stanford ends up going 8-4
after you thoroughly analyzed the
probable outcome of a Stanford-
Ohio State Rose Bowl matchup.
Reminisce: If you're feeling
good about a dominant Stanford
performance, you'll feel even better
when you remember that the Cardi
nal went 1-11 in 2006.
Find someone who has been
around for awhile, e.g. Dean Julie, and
have them explain something called
"The Buddy Teevens Era." You'll swell
with pride when you realize that the
current Stanford team emerged from a
dark, dark time. "Did you know that
we used to punt on third down?" you'll
smartly mention to your other friend.
Gamble: For some people, the best
way to treat a case of football boredom
is to infuse some good oF gambling
into the picture. According to
www.betus.com, Stanford is a 4.5-point
favorite over Notre Dame this week
end. Good luck. If that doesn't do it for
you, get specific. You can pretty much
bet on anything these days. But don't
get carried away, you might wake up in
a smoky Vegas backroom with a bro
ken kneecap and a laundry list of re
grets.
Hyperbole: When your team is win
ning a blowout, there have to be some
fans who maintain a steady flow of pos
itive hyperbole. A consistent flow of
declarations such as "Richard Sher
man is so sick!" and "Harbaugh might

be smarter than that British guy who
talks through that computer" will do
the job.
The hard part about being Mr. Hy
perbole is that you have to keep it up.
There needs to be a constant stream of
exaggeration in the seats, in the conces
sion lines and in the bathrooms at any
proper blowout. You can't let your fel
low fans forget that their team is really,
really, really good.

But even all of the aforementioned
techniques get boring after a while.
Here's to hoping that we Stanford
faithful have the privilege of watching
a close game at some point. Stanford
plays at No. 5 Oregon in two weeks.
Who knows? Maybe it'll be close.

Jack Duane wants to be "that douche
bag." Challenge him to a hyperbole
battle at jduane@stanford.edu.
