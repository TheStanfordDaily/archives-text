# Larry Scott should fight media bias
## 
### Kabir Sawhney 
This week, I would not want to
be Larry Scott. Sure, by most
accounts, this week has been
a pretty good one for the Pac
-10 Conference's commis
sioner. His conference's football pro
grams performed fairly well over the
weekend against nonconference com
petition, going 6-4 overall. Only one of
those defeats California's 52-31 loss
to Nevada was really an upset, and
a spirited Arizona State team that was
supposed to get blown out in Madison
instead gave Wisconsin a run for its
money, losing 20-19 on a blocked extra
point.
Meanwhile, in the win column, Ari
zona took the game of the week, con
quering then-No. 9 lowa 34-27, while
beleaguered UCLA managed an
upset of then-No. 23 Houston and
Stanford blew out Wake Forest, all on
national TV.
Here's the catch, though: while
these games were nationally televised,
due to the time difference between the
East and West Coasts, they all started
at or after 10:30 p.m. in East Coast mar
kets, when most fans have already had
their fill of football for the day. Many of
the voters in the Associated Press poll
and other polls probably didn't watch
any of the Pac-10's big games, since the
polls are centered on the East Coast.
All it takes is one glance at the lat
est rankings to see the prevalence of
East Coast bias, and the persistent un
dervaluing of the Pac-10. It's already
well-known that the USA Today
Coaches' Poll undervalues the Pac-10
even more so than its main counter
part, the Associated Press Top 25 poll
(yet the former is counted in the BCS
formula while the latter is not). So, let's
throw out the Coaches' Poll and focus
on the AP.
To start with, let's look at where
Arizona landed after decisively taking
down lowa. The Wildcats jumped from
No. 24 to No. 14 in the polls, but I would
argue that, based on the teams above
them, they are ranked too low, primari
ly because of the prevalence of East
Coast bias.
The four teams ranked immediate
ly above Arizona are No. 13 Utah, No.
12 South Carolina, No. 11 Wisconsin
and No. 10 Arkansas. Utah deserves its
ranking: it opened the season by de
feating Pittsburgh, a perennial Big
East contender, and has steamrolled
its last two opponents. However, South
Carolina, Arkansas and (especially)
Wisconsin should not be ranked as
highly as they are. They simply receive
greater consideration because (a) AP
voters actually watched their games;
and (b) they don't play in the Pac-10,
which is inexplicably considered inferi
or to the Big Ten.
Let's start with the SEC teams,
South Carolina and Arkansas. Both
programs' biggest wins of the season to
date are over a Georgia team that was
clearly overrated to start the season
and is currently unranked. But both
teams "looked good" in their games
against the Bulldogs, a consideration
the Pac-10 can never receive because
no one is actually watching to see how
good the teams look.
Wisconsin's ranking at No. 11 is
even more egregious.To date, the Bad
gers have beaten storied programs like
UNLV and San Jose State, and barely
escaped against an Arizona State team
picked to finish ninth in the Pac-10 pre
season media poll. Yet somehow, the
mere fact that it plays in the Big Ten
and appears to have some potential is
enough to rank it higher than an Ari
zona team that defeated one of the
main contenders for the Big Ten con
ference title.
So we come back to the Pac-10
commish, Larry Scott. He has done an
admirable job in his first year, expand
ing the conference by two schools and
trying to heighten its national profile.
However, he has done this without ex
plicitly addressing the elephant in the
room: the fact that the media inexpli
cably favors East Coast teams over
West Coast ones, and that a three-hour
time difference is regularly given as an
acceptable justification for this dis
crepancy. Hell, it's even a reason why
Toby Gerhart didn't win the Heisman
Trophy last year: the East Coast has
greater weight in voting than the West
Coast, and those voters never watched
Gerhart bulldoze opposing defenses
