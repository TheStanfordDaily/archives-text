### MARGARET RAWSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After a busy summer, the ASSU executives
have set their sights on several projects for fall
quarter, all with a focus on community building,
health and wellness.
A recent product of the collaboration is the
Leadership Development Program designed
by ASSU executives Angelina Cardona 'll and
Kelsei Wharton 'l2 and program co-coordina
tors Lina Hidalgo 'l3 and Madeline Hawes 'l3,
deputy chair of the Senate.
The program combines the application

process for students wishing to serve as Senate
associates or executive fellows. Hawes, along
with other several other senators, served as a
Senate associate last year.
Increased publicity for the program could
work to address a concern of Wharton's since
coming to Stanford.
"Some students know to get involved and
are privy to opportunities and information,"
Wharton said, describing what he called the
"information gap" between students active in
student groups and those less knowledgeable
about Stanford resources.
The ASSU executive is pushing for the ere

ation of a "Stanford 101" class, an initiative sup
ported by Vice Provost for Undergraduate Ed
ucation Harry Elam, to better acquaint stu

The executive also created stickers listing
campus resources for dorm staffs to distribute
to residents at the beginning of fall quarter.
Over the summer, Cardona spearheaded
the launch of the ASSU Pakistan flood relief ef
fort, which is set to continue throughout the
year. The executives partnered with UNCHR,
the United Nations' refugee agency, and named
Asfandyar Ali Mir 'l2 director of Pakistan
flood relief. Cardona matched the first $5OO

raised over the summer from her executive
salary. To date, the effort has raised $10,400.
Citing the long-term goals of the executive
in an e-mail to The Daily, Cardona listed unit
ing the Stanford community for movements
such as the Pakistan effort, ensuring the "long
term viability and credibility of the ASSU,"
"shifting Stanford culture to prioritize health,
wellness and balance," and helping to end vio
lence against women.
With this last goal in mind, Cardona attend
ed the NCHERM Conference on Responding
to Sexual Misconduct on College Campuses, a
two-day conference on campus in July.

Cardona has been working with Nicole
Baran, founder and director of the Center for
Relationship Abuse Awareness, to plan an anti
sexual misconduct and domestic abuse train
ing. The ASSU will co-sponsor the Partnership
to End Violence Against Women campus-wide
survey in October.
"This is a very tangible and visible initiative
that we hope will provide a lot of hard data as
to what people believe and experience around
sexual assault, relationship abuse and stalking,"
Cardona said. "This information will better in-
