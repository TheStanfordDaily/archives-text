Changes are afoot for the Mar
guerite Shuttle system, Stanford's
free shuttle service. Several new
stops have been added to the Shop
ping Express route and changes have
been proposed for Line A, Line B
and the Midnight Express.
According to a Sept. 10 an
nouncement from Parking & Trans
portation Services (P&TS), three
stops have been added to the Shop
ping Express route at Page Mill
Road and El Camino near Palo Alto
Square, Hansen Way and El Camino
near Fry's Electronics, and Maybell
Avenue and El Camino near Wal
greens, according to the Marguerite
Shuttle website. The stops were
added after a P&TS review of rider
ship data, stop locations, vehicles and
service hours.
The changes are part of a wider
P&TS goal to conserve fuel, reduce
emissions, reduce operating costs
