## Shuttle changes approach Marguerite adds new stops, proposes new routes 
### IVY NGUYEN DESK EDITOR 
Changes are afoot for the Mar
guerite Shuttle system, Stanford's
free shuttle service. Several new
stops have been added to the Shop
ping Express route and changes have
been proposed for Line A, Line B
and the Midnight Express.
According to a Sept. 10 an
nouncement from Parking & Trans
portation Services (P&TS), three
stops have been added to the Shop
ping Express route at Page Mill
Road and El Camino near Palo Alto
Square, Hansen Way and El Camino
near Fry's Electronics, and Maybell
Avenue and El Camino near Wal
greens, according to the Marguerite
Shuttle website. The stops were
added after a P&TS review of rider
ship data, stop locations, vehicles and
service hours.
The changes are part of a wider
P&TS goal to conserve fuel, reduce
emissions, reduce operating costs
and respond to customer feedback
while "maintaining or improving
service levels," according to P&TS
Director Brodie Hamilton.
Under the proposed changes, the
current Line A would be split into
the new Line A, which would travel
in a one-way loop between the Palo
Alto Transit Center and Campus
Oval via the Medical Center and
Cantor Arts Center, and Line D,
which would travel between the
Medical Center and Escondido Vil
lage via Serra Mall. Line B would be
split into the new Line B, which
would serve the western half of the
current Line B route, and Line E,
which would serve the eastern half of
the current Line B.
Hamilton said changes to Line A
were proposed due to current over

lap with Line B. Changes to Line B
were prompted by the high concen
tration of wheelchair users in the
Medical Center area, which requires
the deployment of the bigger Mar
guerite buses. Splitting the line into
two routes would allow the deploy
ment of smaller buses in the rest of
campus, which would increase fuel
economy for the system.
"We're hoping with these
changes that we're saving hundreds
of tons of CO2 emissions," Hamilton
said.
The Marguerite system serves an
estimated 5,000 riders a day, accord
ing to Hamilton. Some have reacted
positively to the proposed changes.
Wai Liu, a fourth-year graduate stu
dent in statistics, said he welcomes
the changes, especially the idea of
splitting Line B into two routes.
"It's good for me because the B
line is too long to get me where I
want to be," Liu said. "Because it has
to go all the way around campus, it's
often late. Splitting it into two will

make it go on time."
The Midnight Express would also
be split into two routes to provide
more frequent stops for riders.
The proposed changes would not
require additional buses or drivers,
nor would they incur additional
costs, Hamilton said.
While some Marguerite routes
like Lines A and B are closely
aligned with the Caltrain schedule,
which is facing budget shortfalls, the
changes were not made in anticipa
tion of any cuts in Caltrain times.
Should a decision be made to
change the Caltrain schedules, the
Marguerite team would work to ad
just the Marguerite schedule as
needed.
P&TS is seeking comments from
the public on the current iteration of
the proposed route changes and will
continue to accept comments on its
website through Sept. 30.
