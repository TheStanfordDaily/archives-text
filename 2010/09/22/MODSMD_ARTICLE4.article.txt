# MED SCHOOL SERVES UP OBESITY PROGRAM
## 
### JULIA BROWNELL SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford School of Medicine has
won a $12.7 million grant from the
National Institutes of Health (NIH)
to pilot and develop an unusually
long-term program to combat child
hood obesity, potentially leading the way
for other programs in the future nationwide.
The grant comes as part of the NlH's
$49.5 million Childhood Obesity Prevention
and Treatment Research (COPTR) pro
gram. Three other universities Vander
bilt, University of Minnesota Twin-Cities
and Case Western also received COPTR
grants.
Thomas Robinson M.D. 'BB, director of
the Center for Healthy Weight at Lucile
Packard Children's Hospital, will lead the
research team designing the program.
"[Dr. Robinson] has done a lot of really su
perb groundwork with families, schools and
communities," said Fernando Mendoza M.D.

'75, a professor of pediatrics who researches
childhood obesity. "We tend to set out a stan
dard format. Clearly there are a lot of ways to
lose weight... Tom's program is holistic. It
takes all those things into account."
The Center for Healthy Weight's current
intensive six-month program helps 80 per
cent of its participants shed excess weight
through fun, stealthy interventions like
dancing and soccer.

"That model works well for the families
able to do it," Robinson said. "The new pro
gram will be in a community setting because,
for some families, they have no availability

or there's [no program] in their
area."
The seven-year grant will finance a new
study following 240 obese children between
the ages of 7 and 12, as well as their families,
for three years. Participants will be drawn
from local towns like East Palo Alto, Red
wood City and East Menlo Park.
"Very few programs last three years
most last a couple of months," Robinson
said. "We've chosen the populations we
work with to be quite diverse as well so that
results can be applied across the county."
The children will receive medical care
