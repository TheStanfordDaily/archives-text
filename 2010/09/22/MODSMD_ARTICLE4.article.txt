# MED SCHOOL SERVES UP OBESITY PROGRAM
## 
### JULIA BROWNELL SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford School of Medicine has
won a $12.7 million grant from the
National Institutes of Health (NIH)
to pilot and develop an unusually
long-term program to combat child
hood obesity, potentially leading the way
for other programs in the future nationwide.
The grant comes as part of the NlH's
$49.5 million Childhood Obesity Prevention
and Treatment Research (COPTR) pro
gram. Three other universities Vander
bilt, University of Minnesota Twin-Cities
and Case Western also received COPTR
grants.
Thomas Robinson M.D. 'BB, director of
the Center for Healthy Weight at Lucile
Packard Children's Hospital, will lead the
research team designing the program.
"[Dr. Robinson] has done a lot of really su
perb groundwork with families, schools and
communities," said Fernando Mendoza M.D.

'75, a professor of pediatrics who researches
childhood obesity. "We tend to set out a stan
dard format. Clearly there are a lot of ways to
lose weight... Tom's program is holistic. It
takes all those things into account."
The Center for Healthy Weight's current
intensive six-month program helps 80 per
cent of its participants shed excess weight
through fun, stealthy interventions like
dancing and soccer.

"That model works well for the families
able to do it," Robinson said. "The new pro
gram will be in a community setting because,
for some families, they have no availability

or there's [no program] in their
area."
The seven-year grant will finance a new
study following 240 obese children between
the ages of 7 and 12, as well as their families,
for three years. Participants will be drawn
from local towns like East Palo Alto, Red
wood City and East Menlo Park.
"Very few programs last three years
most last a couple of months," Robinson
said. "We've chosen the populations we
work with to be quite diverse as well so that
results can be applied across the county."
The children will receive medical care

from their existing primary care
providers and will be enrolled in an
after-school program through or
ganizations like Boys & Girls Clubs
or YMCA. Half the children will be
enrolled in a standard after-school
program, and half will learn healthy
eating and exercise habits in spe
cially designed after-school pro

grams and receive home visits to
ensure the living environment is
conducive to weight loss.
This will be one of the largest
and longest studies ever conducted
on childhood obesity prevention
and will include analysis of its cost
effectiveness.
"It is a very comprehensive pro
gram . . . the challenge will be to
find the parts of the program that
work best and [ensure] the services
are provided in the most effective
way possible," said Jay Bhat
tacharya M.D. '97, Ph.D. 'OO, who

will lead the investigation into the
cost-effectiveness of the program.
If cost-effective, the pilot pro
gram could serve as a model for
childhood obesity prevention pro
grams across the country.
The pilot would be a success "if it
would demonstrate that this model is
effective in helping over-traditional
medical models," Robinson said.
Bhattacharya said the money
recognizes excellence in obesity re
search that Stanford has practiced
for many years. The grant "is more
of an indicator of how strong the

program is already," he said.
COPTR comes in the midst of a
national effort to combat the grow
ing problem of childhood obesity.
Still, Robinson said even more in
vestment is needed in the long term.
"Forty-nine million is a drop in
the bucket," he said. "Much more
investment needs to go into an epi
demic we're already facing, that's
having huge impacts on health and
economics in this country."
