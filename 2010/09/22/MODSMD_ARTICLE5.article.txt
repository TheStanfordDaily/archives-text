## Conservation at the Dish turns 10 
### KURT CHIRBAS 
Ten years ago, when he was an undergraduate at Stan
ford, Jeff Schwegman 'Ol camped out with some of his
classmates at the top of the Dish, a 2,400-acre area of the
campus reserved for both academic projects and habitat
conservation. He remembers hiking up dirt paths, seeing
snakes slither across his path and, most memorably,
watching the sun set.
Returning to campus this year as an IHUM teaching
fellow, Schwegman can't help but notice the changes the
Dish has undergone in his absence.
"It's a little less like the Wild West now," he says.
That's because in 2000, spurred by an increase in the
number of recreational users of the area, Stanford's
Land Use and Environmental Planning Department de
cided to implement a new conservation and land use
plan, with the goal of trying to minimize human impact
on the area. This September marks the 10th anniversary
of the Dish's environmental plan.
The Dish's history stretches back to the 1980s, when
Stanford opened the area to the public, allowing commu
nity members to hike and jog along an authorized dirt

Visitors run the Dish loop on a sunny day. Since the Dish's conservation plan started in 2000, thousands of visitors have hiked

route. But without any manage
ment of the area, other paths not
authorized by the University were
created. These 12 miles of "boot
leg" routes caused land erosion
and came close to both University
facilities and wildlife habitats.
"If you have recreational users
around those types of facilities and
infrastructures, it could really put
them at risk and complicate the
use of those things," said Charles
Carter, director of land use and en
vironmental planning.
The 2000 conservation and land
use plan was designed to help
solve this problem but the Dish
now attracts more visitors than
ever before, according to the Uni
versity. Carter said approximately
half a million people visit the Dish

annually, up from between 300,000
and 400,000 a decade ago.
"It's probably not a good thing
for conservation purposes, and it's
probably not a good thing for Uni
versity operations, but it's a good
thing from a community-relations
perspective," Carter said. "It
makes for some good-neighbor
policy."
Dana Harrold, a resident of
Palo Alto who has been going to
the Dish since she moved to the
area in 1992, said she sees benefits
to the number of visitors.
"The more time people can
spend out in nature, the more sen
sitive they'll be to the need to pre
serve it," she said.
But not all neighbors are pleased
with the new policies. Tom French,
another runner who started coming
to the Dish four months ago, said he
wishes he could bring his dog on
hikes with him, an act that is prohib
ited under the 2000 plan.
The rationale for this provision,

Carter said, is that pets would en
danger wildlife that is already
there. He also recalled a time when
pets were allowed to come to the
Dish.
"When it was open to dogs, it
was pretty foul up there," Carter
said. "There was a lot of dog waste
in the Dish, and [specifically] at
the Stanford Avenue gate en
trance."
Projects in the works for the
Dish include a plan to put up inter
pretative signs that explain what
the Dish lands are used for not
just recreation, but conservation
and academic interests. While the
plan was shelved in the past,
Carter said the University might
pursue it in the future.
And while Schwegman said the
Dish is a little more "draconian"
since the last time he saw it, he also
added: "But I still love it."
