Ten years ago, when he was an undergraduate at Stan
ford, Jeff Schwegman 'Ol camped out with some of his
classmates at the top of the Dish, a 2,400-acre area of the
campus reserved for both academic projects and habitat
conservation. He remembers hiking up dirt paths, seeing
snakes slither across his path and, most memorably,
watching the sun set.
Returning to campus this year as an IHUM teaching
fellow, Schwegman can't help but notice the changes the
Dish has undergone in his absence.
"It's a little less like the Wild West now," he says.
That's because in 2000, spurred by an increase in the
number of recreational users of the area, Stanford's

on the area. This September marks the 10th anniversary
of the Dish's environmental plan.
The Dish's history stretches back to the 1980s, when
Stanford opened the area to the public, allowing commu
nity members to hike and jog along an authorized dirt

Visitors run the Dish loop on a sunny day. Since the Dish's conservation plan started in 2000, thousands of visitors have hiked
the Dish. Annually, 500,000 guests from both Stanford and the surrounding areas come to visit the area, say officials.
