## ASSU eyes financial reform bill Queer studies, nominations fill this week's agenda 
### MARGARET RAWSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The ASSU Undergraduate Senate kicked
off the academic year Tuesday evening by
passing a bill supporting a queer studies
minor through the Feminist Studies program,
confirming the Nomination Commission's
first round of nominees to University com
mittees and discussing the first half of a com
prehensive financial reform package. The
Senate tabled a bill revising the the group's
rules of order.

Queer Studies
First introduced last spring, the bill to fos
ter queer studies through the Feminist Stud
ies program was written by Karli Cerankows
ki, a graduate student in Modern Thought and
Literature, and Charles Syms 'll of the Queer
Studies Coalition.
The bill initially included the allocation of
resources to the Feminist Studies programs
for a major, minor and Ph.D. certificate in
queer studies. A friendly amendment intro
duced by Senator Will Seaton 'l3 was adopt
ed to only encourage the creation of a minor
in queer studies.
Several senators expressed concern that
the bill needed more details about the con-
tents of the minor and more student
participation in a survey assessing
interest in queer studies. The
amended bill passed with 13 affir
mative votes and Senators Juany
Torres 'l3 and Kamil Saeid 'l3 ab
staining.
ASSU President Angelina Car
dona 'll and Stewart Macgregor-
Dennis 'l3 voiced their opinions that
passing the bill, rather than tabling it
for a week, would give momentum to
the movement for queer studies.
Daniel Khalessi 'l3 agreed, saying
the bill might also serve as commen
tary on the U.S. Senate's recent fail
ure to repeal "don't ask, don't tell."
Ryan Peacock, a graduate stu
dent in chemical engineering and
chair of graduate issues for the exec
utive cabinet, encouraged the bill's
authors to continue to reach out to
deans and high-level faculty.
Financial Reform Package
At the beginning of Tuesday's
meeting. Peacock unveiled the first
half of a financial reform package, a
significant ASSU initiative for fall
quarter. The report was a combined
effort between Peacock, the ASSU

executives, Senate Chair Michael
Cruz 'l2, Senate Treasurer Macgre
gor-Dennis and others.
The goal of the current financial
reform is "to codify how we deal with
money and who is in charge of what,"
said Peacock.
The report states its purpose is "to

address the lack of clarity in dealing
with the political
budgets and implement bylaws that
describe the current best practices of
the Association."
Proposed bylaw changes include
the creation of four categories al
location, stipend, line item and dis
cretionary — for all budget items.
The report also outlines the budget
modifications voting system and
clarifies the roles of GSC financial
officers and the Senate treasurer.
The second half of the report, still
to be unveiled, will discuss spending
on student campaigns.
Nominations Commission
The Senate unanimously con
firmed Tuesday the Nominations
Commission's first round of nomi
nees to University committees.
Many positions, particularly gradu
ate student positions, remain un
filled. The Commission plans re
newed publicity efforts to target
graduate students.
Because of time conflicts, the
chair and deputy chair of the com
mission have stepped down. The
ASSU executive is tasked with ap
pointing replacement chairs and will
do so this week after a joint meeting
of legislative body chairs.
