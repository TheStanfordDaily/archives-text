## Hot on the trail Stanford Solar Car races with the summer sun 
### KATHLEEN CHAYKOWSKI DESK EDITOR 
On a bright Oklahoma morning,
Greg Hall 'l3, a member of the
Stanford Solar Car Project's
electrical team, woke up to a
radio call blaring that the
team's solar car, Apogee, was engulfed in
blue smoke.
"We'd get panicked and call, 'The solar
car is on fire!"' Hall said.
The car wouldn't really catch on fire, but
unanticipated bugs in its circuitry or
more simply, the "electronics blowing up"
sometimes caused blue smoke.
Small explosions are fairly routine while
racing a solar car for a month straight, said
Hall, who was one of nearly a dozen Stan
ford students to spend this summer compet
ing in the North American Solar Challenge.
The biennial race is a 1,200-mile trek
from Broken Arrow, Okla., to Naperville. 111.
About 20 other universities around the
world from countries such as Germany, Tai
wan and Turkey, competed this year.
Mornings during the race started before
sunrise when team members woke to charge
the car. While the tbp half of the car was re
moved and placed on a steel structure to
capture sunlight, the team checked the car's
electrical systems, the day's weather report
and the car's battery. Once the lead and the
chase vehicles the cars carrying gear and
most of the team were packed, it was
time to hit the road.
Each day, two lucky drivers each spent
four to five hours in the vehicle's snug, one
person seat. Drivers frequently didn't have
time to visit the bathroom, and there was no
air conditioning. It's a rough combination
while driving through 100-plus degree
weather in the American South.
"There's a famous story from the 2005
race: it came down to the wire with Cal 30
minutes behind us," Hall said. "And I know
that [Stanford] repeatedly denied the driver
bathroom breaks."
"I mean, it's Cal," he added.
At noon, the car can generate about a

kilowatt of power from solar rays, enough
energy to power four desktop computers or
10 fairly large light bulbs, Hall said. The
420-pound car, built almost entirely from
carbon fiber, is extremely aerodynamic and
can go for a couple of hours at highway
speeds.
Hall heard about Solar Car even before
he enrolled at Stanford he met members
of the team in his Admit Weekend dorm.
After attending meetings and hanging
around the shop freshman year, he was
eventually invited to race with the team.
"There is a steep learning curve, so you
have to hang around the car for a while be
fore you can do something useful," he said.
Over the summer, Hall drove for about
four days. Though the ride can be uncom
fortable, he said driving a solar car is more
engaging than driving an ordinary car. For
starters, drivers are seated in the middle of
the car, which can cause people accustomed
to sitting off-center in traditional vehicles to
drift in their lanes. And throughout the racef
drivers are in constant communication with
team members and race officials, who tell
them if they need to pass another vehicle or
make a turn. Drivers are also notified if they
are violating race rules.
Racing for the day ended at around 5 or
6 p.m. and was followed by dinner and repair
work until midnight or 1 a.m. Work time was
usually accompanied by watermelon snack
breaks and techno music.
"The judges said, 'We don't like those
Stanford kids' liberal spirit,"' l Hall recalled.
"I think they thought we were having too
much fun."
This year's car, which team leader
Nathan Hall-Snyder 'l2 described in an e
mail to The Daily as the team's hiost durable
yet, came in fourth.
Hall-Snyder has been on the team for
two years, and he took fall quarter of his
sophomore year off to race the car in Aus
tralia. He built his own sports car in his
garage in high school, and team members re
gard him as the go-to source for anything
solar.
The student-run club was founded in
1989. It recently received $2 million from

Volkswagen for the construction of the new
Stanford Solar Car shop. Volkswagen also
committed $750,000 a year to the team for
five years. The team is working on its 10th
car in preparation for the next race, the 2011
World Solar Challenge across the Australian
outback.
The team has close ties to the renewable
energy technology sector of Silicon Valley.
"We work closely with companies like
VW, Linear Technology and STMicroelec
tronics on cutting-edge electric vehicle tech
nology at a pace that you'll never find any
where in industry," Hall-Snyder said.
Tesla's current chief technical officer, JB
Straubel '9B M.S. 'OO, is an alumnus of the
team, and the first prototype of the Tesla
battery pack was built in Stanford's former
Solar Car shop. Besides its commercial con
nections, the primary purpose of the project
is educational.
"On Solar Car, a part you design or build,
instead of being turned in for a grade, could
carry you or one of your teammates across

Australia on a race," Hall-Snyder said.
When the team isn't spending late nights
in the shop or making food runs to Tandoori
Oven near campus. Solar takes its car to
local K-12 schools jn the Bay Area and gives
talks about pursuing an engineering educa
tion.
Hall-Snyder said the team's long-term
goal is to become the best solar racing team
in the U.S. He is excited about what the
team's next car could do to meet that goal.
"After doing some investigation fresh
man year, I think it's the coolest hands-on
engineering project that's available to un
dergraduates," Hall said.
Solar Car meetings take place at 12 p.m. on
Saturdays and 7:30 p.m. on Mondays in the
team's on-campus shop. Interested students
