## Business and engineering graduate students named '11 Siebel Scholars 
### RYAN MAYFIELD STAFF WRITER 
Fifteen Stanford graduate stu
dents have been chosen as 2011
Siebel Scholars in recognition of
their academic achievement and
community leadership.
A faculty committee at the Grad
uate School of Business selected
five second-year students Aman
da Luther, Sumi Kim, Danielle
Buckley, Arvind Iyengar and Shane
Lauf from a class of nearly 400
students.
The students join a community of
scholars from many of the top uni
versities in the world in the fields of
business, bioengineering and com
puter science, Siebel Scholars con
vene at annual conferences, where
they discuss pertinent social issues
and collaborate with other experts
in their field. The scholars also serve
as advisers to the Siebel Founda
tion, helping direct the foundation's
strategies and programs.
The scholars each receive a cash
award of $35,000, which will fund
the business students' final year of
school.
"There is obviously the mone
tary component to the award, which

is really nice in terms of making
school more affordable," Luther
said.
In a class of nearly 400 students,
being part of a select group is also
significant to the recipients. "It's def
initely a nice surprise and a huge
honor," Kim said.
Joining the business students are
10 students enrolled in engineering
graduate programs at Stanford.
Mindy Chang, Murtaza Mogri,
Sarah Moore, Hedi Razavi and An
gela Wu were selected from the bio
engineering program. Salman
Ahmad, David Keeler, Dan Pre
ston, Keith Schwarz and Tao Wang
were chosen from the computer sci
ence program.
Fifteen Stanford students, five in
business and ten in engineering, re
ceived the award in 2009.
Karen Davis, executive director
of the Siebel Scholars Foundation,
said the award grants more than
recognition.
"The Siebel Scholars community
is an active, lifelong community of
leaders," Davis wrote in an e-mail to
The Daily. "They represent the best
and brightest from across the globe,
forming a unique professional and
personal network, bringing together

diverse insights and perspective
from three disciplines at the fore
front of solutions to world-changing
social issues."
For the winners, the ultimate im
pact joining the Siebel community
would have on them was not imme
diately clear. They were still abuzz
with the surprise of winning.
"There is this entire community
of Siebel Scholars that I am just be
ginning to learn about," Luther said.
Having worked for Dallas Mav
ericks owner Mark Cuban, Luther
said she may look to a career in
sports management after gradua
tion. Otherwise, she said, she may
return to consulting, a field in which
she worked for two years before
coming to Stanford.
Because the Siebel Scholars com
munity includes both business and
engineering students, the long-term
effect may come from the diversity
of interests among the scholars.
"I'm doing work that could have
a very strong technology connec
tion," Kim said, "so having that link
to those communities is a huge
bonus to the award."
