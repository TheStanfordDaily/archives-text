## EDITORIAL Not all housing is created equal 
### 
Even before students enroll, one of the
selling points that Visitor Informa
tion Services and any number of Uni
versity publications impress upon them is
the strength of the residential experience.
The message: that having roughly 95 per
cent of undergraduate students living on
campus and in close proximity creates a
unique atmosphere. The three years of
guaranteed housing after freshman year
carry a level of security that is not found in
other college towns, where horror stories of
draconian landlords become engrained in
campus cultures.
There is a large degree of truth mixed in
with the cheerleading having the over
whelming majority of undergraduates se
questered in select, highly concentrated
spaces helps makes Stanford what it is. But
tour-guide rhetoric does not approach
more grim truths about student housing at
Stanford. One truth is that not all Stanford
housing is created equal. The other is that
good housing, generally speaking, begets
good housing.
While it is a noble ideal, trying to under
play the disparities in student living spaces
is nothing more than a pleasant fiction.
With such a massive weight put on the com
munities built within residences, be it Rinc,
Columbae or SAE, housing should be an
issue about which all members of the Stan
ford world should become knowledgeable.
Student Housing is stocked with hard
working professionals dedicated to improv
ing the student experience. They are tasked
with the unenviable job of making sure that
students' fundamental human needs are
not only met, but met in away that lives up
to the prestige associated with this school.
Trying to cater to 11,000 different sets of
needs and habits in a personalized way is no

easy task.
A testament to the diversity of campus is
the sheer range of housing options avail
able, from co-ops to houses to quasi-apart
ments, which different students will be
drawn to for unique reasons. A resident of
Suites, perhaps, is looking for a different ex
perience than a student living in French
House, and no living space is the "right"
choice.
But unfortunately, choices and prefer
ences about such options still remain out of
the hands of some students.
Today's Daily story about the 39 under
graduates living in Rains graduate houses
brings to bear the fact that we still have a
way to go in providing optimal, equitable
options to all students. With the Draw, the
only reason beyond class year that Student
A gets Mars and Student B winds up in
Lantana is a randomly assigned number.
People make the most of wherever they
live, but to think for a second that the world
of Manz is comparable to the Lower Row is
borderline insane. The Draw should not be
abolished; it is a bit of a necessary evil. But
the acceptance of certain realities is no ex
cuse for complacency.
While Stanford is still recovering from a
massive endowment downturn, and every
building decision must jump through an
array of local and state codes, we must con
tinue to make undergraduate housing a
major issue. The price of going to Madrid in
the fall should not be banishment to Escon
dido Village, Oak Creek or Rains. Particu
larly as new staff homes pop up along Stan
ford Avenue and Munger stands still fresh
to the eye, the University needs to assess
how to help improve the living situation of
more Stanford students.
