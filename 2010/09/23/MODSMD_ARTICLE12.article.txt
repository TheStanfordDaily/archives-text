## Music In the Bubble 
### Lucas Will Johnson 
Let's talk about music! As the saying
goes, talking about music is like danc
ing about architecture. Don't worry,
I'm not saying we should all mime The Claw
Instead, I'd like to spend this quarter dis
cussing all the ways music fits into the world
of a university. Stanford's got a decent gig
going, but there are some ways for the song to
improve. How can we shape it fully into what
we want? College music is mostly student
music, so I say the more of us that jump in as
players and listeners, the better.
This week, I'll scan the overall picture and
get into details later. Let's start at the begin
ning: you arrive on campus, violin in tow,
wondering how to work music into your new
college life after years of lessons and per
formances. Or you've never touched a piano
and are just looking for a place to plug in the
speakers, hoping your roommate has similar
taste.
You've picked suburban Stanford, where
it takes initiative to visit any solid urban
music scene. Our beloved bubble has hun
dreds of talented students and teachers, and
some world-class musicians take time to visit
every once in a while. But the cup of song
doesn't quite overfloweth amid the satura
tion of engineering, computer science, busi
ness, medicine, etc. We live in Silicon Valley,
not Nashville or New Orleans.
Academically, we're not a conservatory
BFAs pop out in June as often as there's
gridlock in Petaluma. Except you weren't
looking for that when you applied you
wanted to take psychology or economics in
addition to the instrument you loved (props
to the handful of music majors). Meanwhile,
non-musicians just look forward to knowing
that kid who practices Rachmaninoff piano
concertos before biking off to an interview at
some consulting firm.
What about bands talking about a
"music scene" means we're talking about
rock and roll, right? Unfortunately, being an
isolated student enclave in the 'burbs makes
it difficult. The few intrepid rock bands have
to find college alternatives to their parents'
garage, and then the closest venues are ...
frats?
The flipside is that the "diversity" the ad
mission office brags about shows up strongly
in our music. Filling a college with people
from all around the world means many dif
ferent cultures get to mix. So you discover a
fair range of options beyond the standard
western orchestra, choir and jazz band setup

that I knew in high school, with groups like
Taiko, Mariachi Cardenal, even Calypso.
At the beginning, it takes a little time to
check out all the possible groups to join or
concerts to attend, but you're optimistic.
Then, the reality of Stanford schedules set in.
You manage to cram in a crazy computer
music class at the Knoll or an audition for an
a cappella group. Soon, it seems like the clos
est thing to a concert you've been to was at a
party where your ears were blasted over and
over by the same 40 mp3s pumped in from
New York and L. A.
As time goes by, you begin to figure some
thing out. Here I am, beginning my senior
year, minoring in music and playing in a
group or two while wishing there were more
bands, more available practice facilities and
tuned pianos. It's been a decent musical ex
perience, but we can make it better.
Luckily, I'm not the first to talk about the
music situation on campus. An arts initiative
was launched by the administration in the
last few years. Many look forward to the Art
Affair in the spring, when all kinds of musi
cians get to come out of the sandstone.
But ultimately, Stanford music is student
music. Sure, some professors perform, and
outside groups do stop by occasionally, but
it's pretty much all about you, maestros.
I have seen the bubble and the bubble is
us.
