# THIS COLUMN IS IRONIC
## Welcome to Stanford, Max Fischer 
### Shane Savitsky 
My name is Shane Savitsky, and I am a
white person. I thought I should get
that out of the way immediately, be
cause it's going to be an overarching theme
to this column as it progresses. After all,
Mark Twain once said, "Write what you
know." What I know is how to be unabashed
ly, undeniably and almost unattractively
white. Maybe you've seen me: I'm that kid
who was biking to class the other day in a
Ralph Lauren oxford with a Jamba Juice in
my hand while jamming to some Vampire
Weekend.

While I'm at it, I should probably get some
other things out of the way. I get all of my
news through Twitter. I think "Arrested De
velopment" is the funniest series to ever air
on television. There are a couple pairs of
skinny jeans hanging in my closet. "The Life
Aquatic" is my favorite Wes Anderson
movie. I check Pitchfork multiple times a day
for the latest in music updates. Of course I
voted for Barack Obama. And no, I am most
definitely not a PC.
I guess some people might call me a hip
ster. We can go with that if you want.
Obviously, Stanford is known for its diver
sity. We have people from all over the planet
coming to study at our fine institution nestled
in its own little slice of paradise, and we do
everything we can to make those people feel
comfortable. Stanford is loaded with commu
nity centers and theme houses beckoning to
every corner of society something that
makes our university such a great and wel
coming place. But sometimes, white people
need a little place where they can come to
and hear someone rant about the latest
episode of "Mad Men" or "Breaking Bad."

Maybe you just want to relax with a coffee
and sit down at your Macbook. This is that
place. (Please ignore the fact that I just com
pletely described the CoHo or any
dorm/house lounge on campus.) Every week
when you open up The Stanford Daily and
see my column on the page, know that this is
a safe respite for those of you who have been
feeling lost.
Fear not! That is not a message of exclu
sion. While this column might be a jaded and
sarcastic view of everything from culture to
Stanford-related issues to anything in be
tween, I hope to reach out to all members of
the Stanford community. You're a college
student, right? And you go to school in Cal
ifornia? From that, I can immediately as
sume that you're probably socially liberal
and culturally conscious. Thus, I'm sure we
would probably be friends if I said some
thing like, "I'm going to drive my Prius to
catch a show at the Fillmore this weekend
and stop in The Mission on my way back to
campus for some dive Mexican food. Oh,
and I hope Prop. 8 gets overturned!" Maybe
you'd like me even more if I told you that I
thought Arcade Fire put out the best album
of 2010 thus far. If you still have no idea why
anything I just said should be appealing or if

you've never heard of Arcade Fire (or think
that I'm referring to a conflagration amid
some pinball machines), then we definitely
have some work to do. We'll accomplish that
over the next few weeks.

That takes me to an important point to
leave you with: in my personal film pan
theon, Wes Anderson-directed movies hold
a very esteemed position among my fa
vorites. And in Anderson's classic film
"Rushmore," the main character is a teenag
er named Max Fischer. Max might be some
thing of a budding sociopath, but he is also
involved in countless extracurricular activi
ties at his private high school, Rushmore.
From the "Yankee Racers" to the fencing
club to the Rushmore Beekeepers, Max
does it all. He's a little obsessive compulsive,
slightly unstable, over-the-top and has way
too many things on his plate to focus on
schoolwork. And that, my friends, is some
thing all of us at Stanford can agree upon.
I'm talking to the person out there among us
who has climbed Mount Everest or whose
research might unlock the cure for cancer
someday. But mainly, I'm talking to you
the average Stanford student who is in a
thousand different student organizations
with countless meetings to go to and a cou
ple papers or problem sets due on top of
that and just not enough time in the day. It
doesn't matter if you're white or black or
brown or some odd shade of purple; all of us
here at Stanford have just a little bit of Max
Fischer in us otherwise, we wouldn't be
here.
