## DUEL IN THE DESERT 
### CAROLINE CASELLI DESK EDITOR 
After almost a month of challenging preseason matches, a monumen
tal victory over the reigning national champion and an undefeated
record, the No. 1 Stanford women's volleyball team looks to carry its non
conference success into the Pac-10 season, which will commence this
weekend.

"Preseason showed us
that we are starting from a
very solid foundation, but we
still have a lot of potential for
improvement," said senior
Ail-American setter and op
posite Cassidy Lichtman.
"We definitely are going to
be a great team, but we want
to stay focused so [that] we
get better every week."
The Cardinal (9-0) will
kick off its regular season
away from home, facing Ari
zona State (5-7) on Friday,
followed by a match against
Arizona (10-2) on Sunday.
The Sun Devils, who were
picked eighth in a Pac-10
preseason coaches' poll,
have seen mixed results in

their early matches. They split their previous two matches, both of which
went to five sets, with a win over Pacific and a loss to Utah.
Arizona State will look to three-time All-Pac-10 Honorable Mention
recipient Sarah Reaves for leadership and dominant all-around play.
Reaves, an outside hitter, currently leads the squad in kills with 195 and
trails only senior libera Sarah Johnson in digs with 116 (Johnson current
ly has 182 digs and an average of 4.55 digs per set, the second highest in
the Pac-10).
Other major contributors for the Sun Devils include junior setter Cat
Highmark, who has tallied 436 assists and a team-high 11 aces thus far,
and sophomore outside hitter Ashley Kastl, who follows Reaves with 115
kills.
Arizona, predicted by the coaches to finish fourth in the conference,
finished the 2009 season with a 19-11 overall record, a handful of upset
victories over ranked opponents and its first NCAA Tournament appear
ance in four years. With a core group of four returning starters returning
from last year's squad, the Wildcats were ranked 18th in the American
Volleyball Coaches Association (AVCA) Preseason Poll, but have subse
quently fallen out of the top 25 with preseason losses to Cal Poly and Pa
cific.
Most recently, however, the Wildcats are riding a five-match hot
streak, including three straight sweeps to win the Arizona Invitational in
Tucson last Saturday. Senior outside hitter Tiffany Owens was named the
Tournament MVP, tallying 22 kills, a .700 hitting percentage and 12 digs
in the championship match alone.
Seniors Whitney Dosty and Paige Weber are also leaders of the Wild
cat squad. Both players competed with the 2010 U.S. A2 National Team
this past summer. Outside hitter Dosty leads the team offensively, hitting
3.95 kills per set, currently the seventh-highest kills average in the confer
ence. Weber, a setter, is coming off of a strong match against New Mexi
co State in which she tallied 41 assists and two aces. Owens, Dosty and
Weber received All-Pac-10 Honorable Mention honors for their play in
the 2009 season.
The Card has the historical edge over both opponents, with a 56-4
record over Arizona State and 54-6 against Arizona. No member of this
year's Stanford roster has lost to either team the Cardinal last fell to
the Wildcats in 2005 and the Sun Devils in 2000.
Still, Stanford understands the territory that comes with being atop
the national rankings and expects a battle from both squads.

SIMON WARBY/The Stanford Daily
The No. 1 Stanford women's volleyball team opens up Pac-10 play this weekend as it hits the road to take on Arizona
State and the University of Arizona. The Cardinal has yet to lose a match this year, despite facing top-quality opponents.
"Being number one gives us a
kind of confidence that I think comes
mostly from the knowledge of what it
took to get there," Lichtman said. "It
does put a target on our backs, and
we know that, but hopefully that will
help us focus even more as we go
through the season. We're prepared
to do whatever we can to defend that
ranking."
The match on Friday against Ari
zona State will take place at 7 p.m. in
Tempe, and Sunday's match versus
Arizona will be held in Tucson at 1
p.m.
