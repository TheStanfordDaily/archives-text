# A
						conversation with John Lynch

### LIZZY COLLINS 
One of the most well
rounded, intelligent
and genuine guys to
have played in the
NFL, John Lynch was
once a student-athlete here at Stan
ford. A two-sport star in baseball and
football and a scholar in the class
room, Lynch overcame much adversi
ty on his journey to becoming a nine
time Pro Bowler and a Super Bowl
champion. Lynch has since set aside
his pads and the demanding schedule
of an NFL player, but his glory days
are not over just yet.
Stanford recently announced that
on Nov. 5, it will formally induct Lynch
into the Stanford Athletics Hall of
Fame.
"It is a tremendous honor," Lynch
said in regard to his future induction.
Having spent several years away
from the Farm, he was somewhat sur
prised to receive a message from Stan
ford's head football coach, Jim Har
baugh, who was the first to congratu
late him on the induction.
"It is a call you don't expect to get,
and it was really a great moment,"
Lynch said.
The four years (1989-1992) Lynch

played on the Stanford football team
were by no means marked purely by
success and glory. The Stanford foot
ball team from 1989-92 experienced
extreme lows and some pretty spec
tacular highs. In 1989, the team went
3-8, but in Lynch's senior year, under
the direction of Bill Walsh, the team
went 10-3, winning the Blockbuster
Bowl.
"I think it's very easy at Stanford,
that there is a built-in excuse we
can't get all the kids into school," he
said. "The one thing that I am thankful
for is that we had a group that wasn't
going to listen to that conventional
wisdom; we were going to try to break
it, and we did. We took a tremendous
amount of pride in turning the pro
gram around."
John sees a bit of his own mentality
of unwavering motivation and dedica
tion in the 2010 football team.
"I think the similarity is that they
believe," he said. "I think my senior
year, Miami was the number one team
in the country, but by the end of the
year, we felt like we could have given
them everything they could handle. I
see that same type of feeling and be
lief with this team don't tell me
why we can't, we are going to. The way

they are playing right now, they are
making a believer out of me."
Lynch was recruited to Stanford as
a quarterback, but after failing to se
cure the starting position, he transi
tioned to safety in the 1991 season.
"I thought I had won it, and I was
really crushed when I didn't get it, so I
almost quit football," Lynch said.
With baseball still very much a part
of his life, Lynch had to make a deci
sion: football or baseball. In his junior
year, he was drafted by the Florida
Marlins in baseball's amateur draft.
However, newly appointed head
football coach Bill Walsh, who won
three Super Bowls with the San Fran
cisco 49ers, saw something special in
John Lynch a talent that could not
go unrecognized. Lynch played mere
ly 30 percent of the defensive snaps
his junior year and was benched after
his third game, so it came as a bit of a
shock when Walsh called him into his
office one day.
"He said, I know you have an op
portunity to play professional base
ball, but I've watched your snaps, and
I think you can be a Pro Bowl football
player in the National Football
