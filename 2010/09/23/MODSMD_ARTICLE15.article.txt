# A 						conversation with John Lynch
## 
### LIZZY COLLINS 
One of the most well
rounded, intelligent
and genuine guys to
have played in the
NFL, John Lynch was
once a student-athlete here at Stan
ford. A two-sport star in baseball and
football and a scholar in the class
room, Lynch overcame much adversi
ty on his journey to becoming a nine
time Pro Bowler and a Super Bowl
champion. Lynch has since set aside
his pads and the demanding schedule
of an NFL player, but his glory days
are not over just yet.
Stanford recently announced that
on Nov. 5, it will formally induct Lynch
into the Stanford Athletics Hall of
Fame.
"It is a tremendous honor," Lynch
said in regard to his future induction.
Having spent several years away
from the Farm, he was somewhat sur
prised to receive a message from Stan
ford's head football coach, Jim Har
baugh, who was the first to congratu
late him on the induction.
"It is a call you don't expect to get,
and it was really a great moment,"
Lynch said.
The four years (1989-1992) Lynch

played on the Stanford football team
were by no means marked purely by
success and glory. The Stanford foot
ball team from 1989-92 experienced
extreme lows and some pretty spec
tacular highs. In 1989, the team went
3-8, but in Lynch's senior year, under
the direction of Bill Walsh, the team
went 10-3, winning the Blockbuster
Bowl.
"I think it's very easy at Stanford,
that there is a built-in excuse we
can't get all the kids into school," he
said. "The one thing that I am thankful
for is that we had a group that wasn't
going to listen to that conventional
wisdom; we were going to try to break
it, and we did. We took a tremendous
amount of pride in turning the pro
gram around."
John sees a bit of his own mentality
of unwavering motivation and dedica
tion in the 2010 football team.
"I think the similarity is that they
believe," he said. "I think my senior
year, Miami was the number one team
in the country, but by the end of the
year, we felt like we could have given
them everything they could handle. I
see that same type of feeling and be
lief with this team don't tell me
why we can't, we are going to. The way

they are playing right now, they are
making a believer out of me."
Lynch was recruited to Stanford as
a quarterback, but after failing to se
cure the starting position, he transi
tioned to safety in the 1991 season.
"I thought I had won it, and I was
really crushed when I didn't get it, so I
almost quit football," Lynch said.
With baseball still very much a part
of his life, Lynch had to make a deci
sion: football or baseball. In his junior
year, he was drafted by the Florida
Marlins in baseball's amateur draft.
However, newly appointed head
football coach Bill Walsh, who won
three Super Bowls with the San Fran
cisco 49ers, saw something special in
John Lynch a talent that could not
go unrecognized. Lynch played mere
ly 30 percent of the defensive snaps
his junior year and was benched after
his third game, so it came as a bit of a
shock when Walsh called him into his
office one day.
"He said, I know you have an op
portunity to play professional base
ball, but I've watched your snaps, and
I think you can be a Pro Bowl football
player in the National Football

League," Lynch remembered.
Walsh went as far as to make a
tape of a former player, the great
Ronnie Lott, to compare Lynch's
skills with one of the best and hard
est hitting defensive backs in the
NFL. Lynch was convinced, and,
after playing in the minor leagues in
the spring of his junior year, he re
turned to Stanford for his senior year
to play football and to develop into a
phenomenal football player.
"I knew that I loved baseball, but
I was passionate about the sport of
football, and really, that's what I
wanted to do," Lynch said. "I wanted
to give it a shot, and I did, and the rest
is history."
In 1992, his senior year, John
played the game of his life against
Notre Dame. Down 16-0 against one
of the nation's top teams, Lynch was
sidelined early in the game after a con
cussion, yet in true John Lynch fash
ion, he returned to the game to lead
his Cardinal to victory (and the only
loss for the Fighting Irish that year).
"I think that was the game that
propelled me and caused the NFL
scouts to really look at me," he said.
"At the time, Notre Dame was at the
very top, a perennial powerhouse,
and we went back there, and it really

felt like we had arrived. Once we did
that, and the way we did that, it made
it really special."
In his senior year. Lynch quickly
blossomed into one of the most re
spected defensive backs in the coun
try, earning first team All-Pac-10 and
second team All-America honors.
In 1993, the Tampa Bay Bucca
neers selected Lynch in the third
round of the NFL Draft. He played
in Tampa for 11 years and won a
Super Bowl ring in Super Bowl
XXXVII. After his time with the
Bucs, Lynch went on to play for the
Denver Broncos from 2004-07. For
Lynch, earning the opportunity to
play in the NFL was something he
had dreamed about since he was a
young boy.
"It was really a dream come true,
and I feel very blessed for having the
opportunity to play for so long," he
said.
It was not the money or the fame
that drove Lynch to play at the pro
fessional level it was his incredi
ble passion for the game. When he
joined the Bucs in 1993, they were
considered one of the worst teams in
the NFL. Lynch played for the Bucs
when the stadium seats were empty
and when their record was well
under .500, but John, believing in
himself, his teammates and the or
ganization, led the Buccaneers to
their best season and only Super
Bowl title.
Though Lynch is generally mild

mannered off the field, he had no
hesitations on it. He is considered to
be one of the hardest-hitting players
ever to play in the NFL. Whether you
were his brother-in-law, John Allred
of the Chicago Bears, or his on-field
enemy, he was going to punish you
for carrying the football. One hit that
stands out in Lynch's mind was a hit
against the Detroit Lions' Barry
Sanders he remembers being one

of the few to really get a good hit on
Sanders.
"Barry, who never said anything,
came up to me at the Pro Bowl that
year and told me it was the hardest
he'd ever been hit," Lynch said,
chuckling.
Lynch married his wife, Linda,
prior to joining the NFL, and before
every game, Linda would slip a note
in either his playbook or his luggage.
"I would read that note, and it
would get me focused and ready to
go play," Lynch said. "That is really
the one routine I carried with me
throughout my career."
Lynch has four young kids, whose
pictures he would also carry with
him. When his family was in the
stands, he remembers looking them
in the eye one time before heading
out onto the field. Lynch, a family
man first and a football player sec
ond, played every game with his fam
ily close to his heart.
John Lynch is held in high esteem
not solely because he was a star play
er and a team captain, but because he
was more than just number 47 on the
playing field. Lynch embraced the
community, and the community
loved him back. Lynch looks forward
to returning to the Farm on Nov. 5 to
celebrate his induction, and the Stan
ford community will welcome him
back with open arms.

play in the NFL was something he
had dreamed about since he was a
young boy.
"It was really a dream come true,
and I feel very blessed for having the
opportunity to play for so long," he
said.
It was not the money or the fame
that drove Lynch to play at the pro
fessional level it was his incredi
ble passion for the game. When he
joined the Bucs in 1993, they were
considered one of the worst teams in
the NFL. Lynch played for the Bucs
when the stadium seats were empty
and when their record was well
under .500, but John, believing in
himself, his teammates and the or
ganization, led the Buccaneers to
their best season and only Super
Bowl title.
Though Lynch is generally mild

mannered off the field, he had no
hesitations on it. He is considered to
be one of the hardest-hitting players
ever to play in the NFL. Whether you
were his brother-in-law, John Allred
of the Chicago Bears, or his on-field
enemy, he was going to punish you
for carrying the football. One hit that
stands out in Lynch's mind was a hit
against the Detroit Lions' Barry
Sanders he remembers being one

of the few to really get a good hit on
Sanders.
"Barry, who never said anything,
came up to me at the Pro Bowl that
year and told me it was the hardest
he'd ever been hit," Lynch said,
chuckling.
Lynch married his wife, Linda,
prior to joining the NFL, and before
every game, Linda would slip a note
in either his playbook or his luggage.
"I would read that note, and it
would get me focused and ready to
go play," Lynch said. "That is really
the one routine I carried with me
throughout my career."
Lynch has four young kids, whose
pictures he would also carry with
him. When his family was in the
stands, he remembers looking them
in the eye one time before heading
out onto the field. Lynch, a family
man first and a football player sec
ond, played every game with his fam
ily close to his heart.
John Lynch is held in high esteem
not solely because he was a star play
er and a team captain, but because he
was more than just number 47 on the
playing field. Lynch embraced the
community, and the community
loved him back. Lynch looks forward
to returning to the Farm on Nov. 5 to
celebrate his induction, and the Stan
ford community will welcome him
back with open arms.

JOHN LYNCH '93
One of the most well
rounded, intelligent
and genuine guys to
have played in the
NFL, John Lynch was
once a student-athlete here at Stan
ford. A two-sport star in baseball and
football and a scholar in the class
room, Lynch overcame much adversi
ty on his journey to becoming a nine
time Pro Bowler and a Super Bowl
champion. Lynch has since set aside
his pads and the demanding schedule
of an NFL player, but his glory days
are not over just yet.
Stanford recently announced that
on Nov. 5, it will formally induct Lynch
into the Stanford Athletics Hall of
Fame.
"It is a tremendous honor," Lynch
said in regard to his future induction.
Having spent several years away
from the Farm, he was somewhat sur
prised to receive a message from Stan
ford's head football coach, Jim Har
baugh, who was the first to congratu
late him on the induction.
"It is a call you don't expect to get,
and it was really a great moment,"
Lynch said.
The four years (1989-1992) Lynch

played on the Stanford football team
were by no means marked purely by
success and glory. The Stanford foot
ball team from 1989-92 experienced
extreme lows and some pretty spec
tacular highs. In 1989, the team went
3-8, but in Lynch's senior year, under
the direction of Bill Walsh, the team
went 10-3, winning the Blockbuster
Bowl.
"I think it's very easy at Stanford,
that there is a built-in excuse we
can't get all the kids into school," he
said. "The one thing that I am thankful
for is that we had a group that wasn't
going to listen to that conventional
wisdom; we were going to try to break
it, and we did. We took a tremendous
amount of pride in turning the pro
gram around."
John sees a bit of his own mentality
of unwavering motivation and dedica
tion in the 2010 football team.
"I think the similarity is that they
believe," he said. "I think my senior
year, Miami was the number one team
in the country, but by the end of the
year, we felt like we could have given
them everything they could handle. I
see that same type of feeling and be
lief with this team don't tell me
why we can't, we are going to. The way

they are playing right now, they are
making a believer out of me."
Lynch was recruited to Stanford as
a quarterback, but after failing to se
cure the starting position, he transi
tioned to safety in the 1991 season.
"I thought I had won it, and I was
really crushed when I didn't get it, so I
almost quit football," Lynch said.
With baseball still very much a part
of his life, Lynch had to make a deci
sion: football or baseball. In his junior
year, he was drafted by the Florida
Marlins in baseball's amateur draft.
However, newly appointed head
football coach Bill Walsh, who won
three Super Bowls with the San Fran
cisco 49ers, saw something special in
John Lynch a talent that could not
go unrecognized. Lynch played mere
ly 30 percent of the defensive snaps
his junior year and was benched after
his third game, so it came as a bit of a
shock when Walsh called him into his
office one day.
"He said, I know you have an op
portunity to play professional base
ball, but I've watched your snaps, and
I think you can be a Pro Bowl football
player in the National Football

League," Lynch remembered.
Walsh went as far as to make a
tape of a former player, the great
Ronnie Lott, to compare Lynch's
skills with one of the best and hard
est hitting defensive backs in the
NFL. Lynch was convinced, and,
after playing in the minor leagues in
the spring of his junior year, he re
turned to Stanford for his senior year
to play football and to develop into a
phenomenal football player.
"I knew that I loved baseball, but
I was passionate about the sport of
football, and really, that's what I
wanted to do," Lynch said. "I wanted
to give it a shot, and I did, and the rest
is history."
In 1992, his senior year, John
played the game of his life against
Notre Dame. Down 16-0 against one
of the nation's top teams, Lynch was
sidelined early in the game after a con
cussion, yet in true John Lynch fash
ion, he returned to the game to lead
his Cardinal to victory (and the only
loss for the Fighting Irish that year).
"I think that was the game that
propelled me and caused the NFL
scouts to really look at me," he said.
"At the time, Notre Dame was at the
very top, a perennial powerhouse,
and we went back there, and it really

felt like we had arrived. Once we did
that, and the way we did that, it made
it really special."
In his senior year. Lynch quickly
blossomed into one of the most re
spected defensive backs in the coun
try, earning first team All-Pac-10 and
second team All-America honors.
In 1993, the Tampa Bay Bucca
neers selected Lynch in the third
round of the NFL Draft. He played
in Tampa for 11 years and won a
Super Bowl ring in Super Bowl
XXXVII. After his time with the
Bucs, Lynch went on to play for the
Denver Broncos from 2004-07. For
Lynch, earning the opportunity to
play in the NFL was something he
