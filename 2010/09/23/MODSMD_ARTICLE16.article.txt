# Luck is solid fit for Heisman
## 
### Zach Zimmerman Dishing the Rock 
After enduring two hours
of sweaty full-frontal
male nudity, I thought
Full Moon on the Quad
of my freshman year
would be the most violating experi
ence of my Stanford career. That was,
until Toby Gerhart finished second in
last year's Heisman Trophy voting.
Despite trumping winner Mark
Ingram (the second best running
back on his own team) in every rele
vant statistical category (except for
wins), Gerhart was wrongly deprived
of college football's most prestigious
honor by an undoubtedly SEC-bi
ased group of Heisman voters. The
trophy would have done absolute
wonders for Stanford's football pro
gram, and we were straight robbed.
I could sit and bitch about this
travesty all day trust me, it's been
done but my hatred for Ingram,
the Heisman voters, the SEC and
everything else that is wrong with col
lege football and its hilariously arbi
trary way of evaluating players and
teams has been temporarily put on
hold for one reason.
Andrew Luck is the truth.
It is hard to believe that the Card's
offense could possibly be more po
tent after losing Gerhart's 2,028 yards
of total offense and 28 touchdowns,
but that's just what it is. And Luck, the
redshirt sophomore quarterback, is
solely responsible for the continued
domination.
Through three games, Luck has
amassed 674 yards through the air
and 140 on the ground. He's thrown
for 10 touchdowns without notching
a single interception and ranks third
in the nation in passing efficiency. Oh,
and he's managed to get No. 16 Stan
ford off to its first 3-0 start since 2001
and is looking to take the Cardinal to
4-0 for the first time in 24 years.
After vastly overrated Washington
quarterback Jake Locker's inevitably
abysmal performance a week ago,
Luck has, in the minds of most Pac-10
football fans, established himself as
the conference's best signal caller (the
only other option being Arizona's
Nick Foles). In fact, he's now regarded
so highly that he has taken the throne
atop Mel Kiper, Jr.'s Big Board, signi
fying him as the top NFL prospect. As
a result, he has vaulted himself into
Heisman contention.
Normally, I try to refrain from
jinxing an athlete that happens to re
side on one of my favorite teams.
After all, I may or may not have guar
anteed a Heisman for Toby, just as I
may or may not have guaranteed that
Dwight Howard would shoot 65 per
cent from the free throw line last sea
son. Let's just say that Gerhart was
closer to fulfilling his prediction.
So, instead of sending Luck down
the same path, I'll just say that he
should win the award. According to
ESPN, Luck currently ranks fifth in
the Heisman projections behind four
quarterbacks: Ryan Mallett of No. 10
Arkansas, Taylor Martinez of No. 6
Nebraska, Terrelle Pryor of No. 2
Ohio State and Denard Robinson of
No. 21 Michigan. Although it's impos
sible to deny any of these players
their gaudy numbers, none is a better
quarterback than Luck, and none is
more valuable to his respective team.
It's definitely concerning to see
the hype train for Pryor and Robin
son gaining steam, but it's especially
bothersome that Ryan Mallett, the
only other true pocket passer in the
group, is receiving more attention.
Arkansas' ranking is generous, con
sidering its first two wins came over
Tennessee Tech and Louisiana-Mon
roe. Its third win, via a last-second
Mallett touchdown toss, came over 1-
2 Georgia, a team whose starting
quarterback is a true freshman and
whose best player has yet to play a
down.
Luck is, in my humblest of opin
ions, a better true passer. Combine
that with his ability to make plays
when outside the pocket (see his 52-
yard touchdown run against Wake
Forest as an example), and it's almost
silly to place him behind any player in
the country, let alone any quarter
back. Still, Mallett is in the SEC and
will continue to be ahead of Luck for
as long as the Razorbacks succeed.
Nonetheless, I'm going to contin
ue to be cautiously optimistic. After

all, Stanford is back on the college
football map with at least six nation
ally televised games this season. Ger
hart paved the way for individual no
toriety on the Farm, and Luck's as

cension to the quarterbacking elite
could not have come at a better time.
Couple in potential big wins at Notre
Dame and Oregon, and the Card
could be represented in New York
for the second straight year.
It's never too early to get on the
Stanford football bandwagon. We al
ready know that the team is poised to
make a legitimate run at a confer
ence title. And as current students, we

are fortunate to be witnesses to one of
the best teams and one of the best
quarterbacks â€”in school history. A
Rose Bowl berth is one thing. But a trip
to Pasadena and a Heisman Trophy?
We might just get Lucky.

name. Give him his props at zachz@stan
