# Undergrads now call Rains home
## Students create niche in graduate housing 
### SAMANTHA McGIRR DESK EDITOR 
Rains Houses, an apartment complex tra
ditionally reserved for graduate students, wel
comed 39 undergraduates this fall. As part of
the University's response to a shortage of on
campus rooms for undergraduates, Student
Housing last spring made Rains an option to
students participating in the Draw.
"Nearly 2,000 beds have been added in
graduate housing over the past 18 years,
while almost no new bed spaces were added
in undergraduate housing during that peri
od," Rodger Whitney, executive director of
Student Housing, wrote in an e-mail to The
Daily. "We plan to meet this challenge in the
short term by temporarily setting aside a
small number of spaces in graduate housing
until additional undergraduate residences
are built in the next few years."
The 800-person Rains complex this year
includes 38 current seniors and one junior.
The undergraduates were placed exclusively
in Building 201, located near Mirrielees and
separated from the rest of Rains by the Ha
cienda Commons area. Like all Rains resi
dents, the students live in one of two apart
ment configurations: one consisting of four
bedrooms and two bathrooms and the other
of two bedrooms and one bathroom. All stu
dents receive their own bedroom, and the
common space of each apartment includes a
living room, kitchen and dining area.

The allure of a single room prompted
Michael Nguyen 'll to list Rains as one of his
housing choices. Nguyen drew Tier Three
with one of his friends, also a senior, and the
pair ended up in a four-bedroom setup with
two other seniors.
"I really wanted my own room," said
Nguyen. "The setup is nice in that we all get our
own single, but we share a common room."
Nguyen expressed interest in using the
common area for small parties and informal
get-togethers, the kind of socializing resi
dent assistant and coterminal student Kelly
Eaton 'lO hopes to encourage among draw
groups.
"Undergraduate college is soon going to be
over for [the residents]," Eaton said. "I'm here
to let them know it's going to end quickly and
that they should have fun their senior year."
To ensure her residents enjoy their last
year on the Farm, Eaton has planned various
activities, including a welcome dinner this
Sunday and a ski trip later in the year. In ad
dition, she hopes to organize a group to at
tend Pub Night each Thursday.
Whitney emphasized the importance of
ensuring that the students in Rains still felt
like members of the undergraduate student
body. In addition to enjoying the presence of
an RA, the undergrads at Rains are consid
ered part of the Mirrielees house communi
ty and have access to all staff, facilities and
activities in Mirrielees.
"When we assign undergraduates to

graduate housing, it is important that we
house all of the students in the same build
ing/area and hire staff (RAs, etc.) to support
them and their specific undergraduate
needs," Whitney said. "We also want to asso
ciate them with an undergraduate residence,
with its associated community and re

sources."
While Celeste Noche 'll appreciates the
University resources available to the Rains
undergrads, she explained that she opted for
the living situation because it offers a more
realistic sense of life after the Farm.
"It's a good middle step before I enter the

real world and have to buy groceries and
deal with housing," she said.
Noche noted the practicality of such
things as learning to cook and building a
housing resume prior to college graduation.

Thirty-nine undergraduates occupy Building 201 in Rains Houses. The building is located next to Escondido Elementary School and separated
from the rest of Rains by Hacienda Commons. Student Housing opened the complex to undergraduates in the spring Draw.
The introduction of undergraduates
in Rains may expose them to yet an
other bit of uncharted territory: in
teraction with graduate students.

"I really hope that the graduate
community welcomes undergrads,"
Nguyen said. "I haven't had a
chance to see what the interaction
between the two student bodies will
be."
Eaton is optimistic that the un
dergrads will have positive encoun
ters with the older students.
"I hear the term 'sketchy grad

student' thrown around [among un
dergraduates]," she said. "But after
meeting a group of grad students, I
really think they're like older fresh
men and need to be looked upon in
a new light. They're nice, and we can
learn from them."
