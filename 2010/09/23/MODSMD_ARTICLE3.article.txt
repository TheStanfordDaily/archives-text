## Chile talk centers on economics Minister of economy discusses country's future prospects 
### MELANIE SCHEIBLE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
"I am not an entrepreneur," Chilean minister of
economy Juan Andres Fontaine said Wednesday
evening in the first of Stanford's Entrepreneurial
Thought Leaders Seminar weekly lectures. "I am a
public policy guy."
Fontaine pushed his ideas for jumpstarting the
Chilean economy, describing both mid- and long
range ideas to put Chile on the path to innovation and
development.
Fontaine currently heads Chilean President Sebas
tian Pinera's team of economic advisers, who are fo
cused on bringing innovation and entrepreneurship to
the nation. Fie is a graduate of the Universidad Catoli
ca in Chile and the University of Chicago, as well as a
former visiting professor at UC-Los Angeles. Fie
began with a 10-minute introduction to the Chilean
economy before participating in an onstage interview
and taking questions from the audience.
Fontaine detailed the tumultuous history of the
Chilean economy. In the early 1980s, the country expe
rienced a serious decline, from which it took more
than a decade to recover. Since the return of democra
cy in 1990, the economic health of Chile has slowly im
proved.
Pinera's administration has a new vision for Chile's
economic prosperity. The first candidate with a right
of-center ideology to be elected since the transition to
democracy, Pinera has recruited a team of renowned
economists to revamp Chilean public policy.
Fontaine said he was "called to serve with a man
date to increase economic activity in Chile."
Despite a massive earthquake in Chile earlier this
year, Fontaine foresees a possible 5-percent increase
in growth this year, followed by several years of 6-per
cent growth or more. He hopes that by the end of the
decade, Chile will no longer be classified as a middle-

upper income country by the World
Bank.
Fontaine told the audience the gov
ernment's top economists look to Cal
ifornia, and specifically Silicon Valley,
for inspiration. He joked that since
Chile and California share geographic
similarities for example, Chilean
wine country resembles Napa Valley
they ought to mirror each other in
business, too.
To promote entrepreneurship and
innovation, the government has estab
lished several financial incentives for
foreign talent to go to Chile. New grant
programs on the order of $40,000 are
designed to fund private business and

expansive scholarship programs for
foreign students. In addition, new poli
cies will give Chileans tax breaks for
starting new businesses.
When a student asked if the econo
my would experience another down
turn with the conclusion of these gov
ernmental initiatives, Fontaine re-em
phasized the administration's overar
ching goal to promote a new spirit of
innovation and creativity.
"Basically, we want Chile to be a
center of creativity and ideas," he said.
"We want Chile to benefit from tech
nological advances and to use technol
ogy in new ways."

Leadership lecture series occurs every
Wednesday with speakers from all cor
