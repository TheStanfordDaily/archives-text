## New system can predict premature infant health 
### MARIANNE LEVINE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford researchers have developed a
new system to predict the health problems
premature infants may face as they grow,
one that is both more accurate and less in
vasive than currently used alternate meth
ods.
Researchers have been working on the
system, called PhysiScore, for the last two
years and published an article detailing its
development on Sept. 8 in "Science Trans
lational Medicine." According to Anand
Rajani, a neonatal specialist and one of
the main researchers and co-authors of

the article, the idea for the PhysiScore
came when Suchi Saria, a graduate stu
dent in computer science, and with com
puter science professor Daphne Roller
and pediatrics professor Anna Penn, no
ticed specific patterns in premature in
fants who faced health complications that
were not apparent in healthy premature
infants.
"PhysiScore works by looking at three
sets of signals that come from a monitor
that is attached to every premature baby
after they are born," Rajani said.
Using an ERG machine, physicians
continuously record these three sig
nals: heart rate, respiratory rate and
oxygen saturations. By running this
data through a computer program,
researchers found they could identi
fy patterns unique to babies with
health problems. They then devel
oped a scoring system using a scale
of one to 10 to determine the likeli
hood an infant will face health com
plications.
According to Roller, short-term
variation in heart rate and respirato
ry rate proved to be the most effec
tive determinants in predicting
health complications. She explained
that an infant's level of responsive
ness is a telling sign of future health,
saying that "poor responders have a
much flatter profile" when present
ed with stimuli such as the touch of a
parent.
Prior to PhysiScore, physicians
primarily determined the likelihood
of developing illness by measuring

the baby's weight and relying on his
or her gestational age. However, this
method was based on large groups of
infants and did not take into account
specific circumstances.
"We knew at that time that ma
chine learning was a powerful
method and that being able to make
a better, more individualized assess
ment of a given premature baby's
risk of being sick or well was needed,
so we continued to develop PhysiS
core," Rajani said.
According to Roller, PhysiScore is
the first method that is able to detect
complications not present during the
first three hours of life. PhysiScore is
able to detect fragility and suscepti
bility to disease that other methods,
including the Apgar method, are un
able to determine. Computed five
minutes after birth, the Apgar con
siders a combination of different fac
tors, including skin color, pulse rate,
reflexes, muscle tone and breathing.
All other methods of determining
premature infant health use data
from the first 12 hours of life and re
quire invasive testing.
"One of the unique characteris
tics of PhysiScore is its use of nonin

vasive measurements," she said.
Rajani explained that since Ph
ysiScore processes "continuous
streams of data from electronic mon
itors over the first three hours of life
. . . this gives [physicians] a far
greater level of detail as to how the
baby's body is doing and thus gives
[physicians] a much higher level of
accuracy in making a determination
about the baby's future risk."
PhysiScore has many potential
uses in the health care field. An in
fant's PhysiScore could help deter
mine if he or she should be trans
ferred to a higher level of care. In ad
dition, the PhysiScore may help ad
ministrators determine nursing-to
patient ratio by predicting which in
fants need more care.
According to Rajani, the PhysiS
core can also help compare the qual
ity of neonatal intensive care units
by "normalizing their outcomes
based on some measure of patient
acuity ... given the accuracy of Ph
ysiScore, it would be particularly
useful for this purpose."
