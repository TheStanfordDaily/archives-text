## New system can predict premature infant health 
### MARIANNE LEVINE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford researchers have developed a
new system to predict the health problems
premature infants may face as they grow,
one that is both more accurate and less in
vasive than currently used alternate meth
ods.
Researchers have been working on the
system, called PhysiScore, for the last two
years and published an article detailing its
development on Sept. 8 in "Science Trans
lational Medicine." According to Anand
Rajani, a neonatal specialist and one of
the main researchers and co-authors of

the article, the idea for the PhysiScore
came when Suchi Saria, a graduate stu
dent in computer science, and with com
puter science professor Daphne Roller
and pediatrics professor Anna Penn, no
ticed specific patterns in premature in
fants who faced health complications that
were not apparent in healthy premature
infants.
"PhysiScore works by looking at three
sets of signals that come from a monitor
that is attached to every premature baby
after they are born," Rajani said.
