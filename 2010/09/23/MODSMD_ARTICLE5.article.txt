## Grant to fund research on immune systems NIH award to support new monitoring research center 
### ERIN INMAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Just as hair color and height vary greatly
among individuals, so do their immune sys
tem responses and the study of these
variations may lead to more nuanced under
standing of the immune system, with Stan
ford researchers leading the way.
Stanford researchers have been awarded
a $17.1 million grant to fund research in the
recently established Stanford Human Im
mune Monitoring Research Center, award
ed by the National Institute of Allergy and
Infectious Disease (NIAID), a component
of the National Institutes of Health.
Stanford is one of six entities receiving

the NIAID grant. The participating institu
tions comprise a consortium that will coor
dinate and communicate under one admin
istrative infrastructure.
According to its website, the NIAID is
sued grants to "capitalize on recent ad
vances in immune profiling to measure the
diversity of human immune responses
under a variety of conditions." Scientists
refer to this diversity as heterogeneity.
The initiative's goal is not to simply de
scribe the human immune profiles, but also
to examine how these profiles react and
adapt to changes in the body.
The team, led by Mark Davis, professor
of microbiology and immunology, will char
acterize the normal human immune system
by tracking immune responses to vaccina
tions, specifically influenza and shingles.
By conducting vaccinations, taking blood
samples and measuring immune re
sponses, the center expects to identi
fy strategies to improve immune re
sponses.
Because immune responses to
viral infections or vaccinations differ

among healthy individuals, one re
search objective "is to define [this]
heterogeneity of an immune re
sponse and to identify signatures for
'good' and 'bad' responses," said Jorg
Goronzy, a project leader and pro
fessor of immunology and rheuma
tology. In addition to Davis and Gor
gonzy, other project leaders include
Andrew Fire, Harry Greenberg,
Daphne Koller and Paul Utz.
Although some factors contribut

ing to immune heterogeneity, such as
age, are known, "we do not have a
good understanding of heterogene
ity and how to measure it," Gor
gonzy said.
The federal grant anticipates that
studying this heterogeneity by
human immune profiling will likely
reveal new understanding of the re
lationship between the immune sys
tem and the rest of the body.
The American Recovery and

Reinvestment Act of 2009 will fund
the project for the first year, with
subsequent years to be funded by the
NIAID.
Under a previous grant, Davis es
tablished the Stanford Institute for
Immunity, Transplantation and In
fection, which aims to develop im
munological tools for use in patient
care and preventative medicine.
Together, the Stanford Human
Immune Monitoring Research Cen
ter and the Stanford Institute for Im
munity, Transplantation and Infec
tion reflect the current need to un
derstand immune system hetero
geneity with the objective of pre
venting age-dependent diseases
often contributed to by the immune
system.
