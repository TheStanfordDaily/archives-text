Just as hair color and height vary greatly
among individuals, so do their immune sys
tem responses and the study of these
variations may lead to more nuanced under
standing of the immune system, with Stan
ford researchers leading the way.
Stanford researchers have been awarded
a $17.1 million grant to fund research in the
recently established Stanford Human Im
mune Monitoring Research Center, award
ed by the National Institute of Allergy and
Infectious Disease (NIAID), a component
of the National Institutes of Health.
Stanford is one of six entities receiving

the NIAID grant. The participating institu
tions comprise a consortium that will coor
dinate and communicate under one admin
istrative infrastructure.
According to its website, the NIAID is
sued grants to "capitalize on recent ad
vances in immune profiling to measure the
diversity of human immune responses
under a variety of conditions." Scientists
refer to this diversity as heterogeneity.
The initiative's goal is not to simply de
scribe the human immune profiles, but also
to examine how these profiles react and
adapt to changes in the body.
The team, led by Mark Davis, professor
of microbiology and immunology, will char
acterize the normal human immune system
by tracking immune responses to vaccina
tions, specifically influenza and shingles.
