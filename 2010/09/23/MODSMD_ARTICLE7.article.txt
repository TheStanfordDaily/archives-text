## Older and Wiser Advice abounds from upperclassmen who muse, "If I had known then what I know now..." 
### JESSICA WERTHEIM STAFF WRITER 
To err is human.To exit
the CoHo unaware
that you smell like a
corned beef sandwich
is a rookie mistake.
For many, freshman year was
their best year on the Farm. For
others, it was simply the starting
block for the rest of their Stan
ford education.
Whatever the case, advice
from upperclassmen abounds.
You'll frat and you'll lie, some
say. You'll come to understand
that the five-second rule has no
place on a college campus. And,
says Ogi Zivojnovic 'O9, you'll be
come best friends with the seem
ingly intuitive yet surprisingly un
forgiving maxim: "Never own
more things than you can pack
into your car."
Well-being is a recurring
theme in upperclassman advice.
"Don't get completely lost in
your academics and forget to so
cialize or have fun," said David

Gobaud 'lO, former ASSU presi
dent. "Furthermore, realize that
Stanford is a phenomenal place
because of countless extremely
hard-working and dedicated indi
viduals. Remember to thank ad
ministrators, faculty, workers and
trustees when you see them."
Angelina Cardona 'll, Gob
aud's successor, offered up simi
lar advice.
"Make time to reflect, re-cen
ter and relax," Cardona said. "It is
more important than any p-set,
essay or midterm and will help
you do well both personally and
academically. Savor each and
every moment, and focus on liv
ing in the present."
On balancing schoolwork with
personal time, Cardona advised
to "never lose your freshman so
cial audacity. Continue to meet
and get to know others in our
community and spend time with
friends. It is the people at Stan
ford that make our university the
best in the world."
That may be, but Stanford is
not the world's best in some re
spects. Example? Biking. Worse?

Biking in the rain.
"The key to biking safely is to
not make eye contact," Professor
Tobias Wolff once said during a
lecture.
"Biking in the rain means
wearing two pairs of pants," ex
plained Jennifer Yen *ll. "Get to
class, take off the outer layer and
put them next to 'cute boy.' Let
them dry. After class, put on the
semi-dry pants and bike your
sorry self to your next class. Then
lather, rinse and repeat."
Finding great teachers and
friends also brings a learning
curve, some say. Often, the best
teachers aren't the ones standing
at the front of a lecture hall.
"Ms. Frizzle taught me at a
very young age to take chances,
make mistakes and get messy,"
said Cameron Poter 'll, referenc

ing the television childhood clas
sic "The Magic School Bus." "This
mentality, coupled with Stan
ford's resources, will allow you to
make the most out of your time
here."
"Don't be discouraged if you
don't immediately find your best
friend, your favorite activity, your
lifelong passion or even your
major when you get to campus in
the fall," said Ginny Scholtes 'l3.
"Stanford has a lot to offer...
odds are that the right people and
the right things for you are out
there. It will just take some time,
patience and effort to find them."
And from this reporter, a few
words: don't drink all the beer.
Bathe. Set the world on fire.
