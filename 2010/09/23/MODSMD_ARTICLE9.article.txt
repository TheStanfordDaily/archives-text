## GSC organizes orientations, activities to foster community 
### ANNA SCHUESSLER 
The Graduate Student Council and student group
members gathered Wednesday evening at the coun
cil's first meeting of fall quarter to discuss community
building measures and budget-oriented considera
tions.
Andy Hernandez, assistant dean of the Graduate
Life Office (GLO), started the evening off by remind
ing officers of the opportunities and resources avail
able to students and their families. In response to the
300 families and some 400 children currently living in
Escondido Village, the GLO is working to provide
family-friendly programming for young families, es
pecially international families coming to the United
States for the first time. Weekend activities for kids as
well as a pumpkin carving slated for Oct. 23 were
among the ideas the GLO has planned for the upcom
ing academic year, and Hernandez promised these
events would have something for everyone,
"For those of you who don't have kids, it's a great
opportunity for you to see kids and see if you want
them," Hernandez said. The council approved GLO's
request for $2,000 in funding.
Opinions flared briefly when the question of
whether or not to fund a measure presented by the
Biomedical Association for the Interest of Minority

Students (BioAIMS) arose. The group was hoping to
offer a workshop focusing primarily on the logistics of
applying for the Dare Fellowship, a prestigious schol
arship awarded to some 12 Ph.D. students every year.
An annual event, the workshop raised eyebrows
among the council members who felt the minority stu
dent group's role as host of the event presented a con
flict of interest.
"It is an exclusive fellowship," said Justin Brown,
council co-chair and graduate student in geophysics.
The group explored the many angles of such funding
and its possible sources, and ultimately came to a con
sensus that funding for all the items requested by
BioAIMS would be honored except for the workshop.
The council ended the meeting on a somber note as
members discussed the issue of bike safety. Aside
from encouraging those present to wear bike helmets
and use bike lights, the group also brainstormed ideas
for increasing awareness and respect for the road and
its riders. One member even suggested that athletes
should be required to wear protective headgear while
riding their bikes to foster a sense of cultural conver
sation and a feeling of "cool."
The council meets next Wednesday at 6 p.m. at the
Graduate Community Center.
