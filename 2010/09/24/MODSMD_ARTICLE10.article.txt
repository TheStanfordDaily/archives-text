## Leaders talk East Palo Alto ties Five miles away, city has unique relationship with University

Although East Palo Alto is only five miles from Stanford,
the two places' economic relationship varies greatly from
Stanford's connections with other mid-peninsula cities.
Nonetheless, the campus remains tied to the city through com
munity service efforts.
Flanked by affluent neighboring cities, East Palo Alto car
ries remnants of its notorious reputation from the 19905, when
the city was known as the country's "per-capita murder capi
tal," according to the San Jose Mercury News.
But even now, a report released by the Stanford Office of
Public Affairs in 2008 with data collected in 2006 shows that of

on the city comes from employment opportunities at the Uni
versity, even those numbers are marginal. According to the
Public Affairs report, only 302 University employees came
from East Palo Alto of more than 20,000 total employees, de
spite a rising unemployment rate in the city.
"There's a rather significant number, I can't say how much,
of undocumented citizens in East Palo Alto," Romero said.
"Generally, those folks don't work for the University because
they look for documents like that."
