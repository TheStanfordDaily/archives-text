## Leaders talk East Palo Alto ties Five miles away, city has unique relationship with University 
### CASSANDRA FELICIANO DESK EDITOR 
Although East Palo Alto is only five miles from Stanford,
the two places' economic relationship varies greatly from
Stanford's connections with other mid-peninsula cities.
Nonetheless, the campus remains tied to the city through com
munity service efforts.
Flanked by affluent neighboring cities, East Palo Alto car
ries remnants of its notorious reputation from the 19905, when
the city was known as the country's "per-capita murder capi
tal," according to the San Jose Mercury News.
But even now, a report released by the Stanford Office of
Public Affairs in 2008 with data collected in 2006 shows that of
all the communities affected by the Stanford economic foot
print, East Palo Alto falls very close to the bottom, with ap
proximately $49.1 million in overall spending in 2006 com
pared to approximately $1 billion spent in Palo Alto.
As for the cash flow in the other direction, East Palo Alto

was not listed as a factor affecting Stanford. The median in
come for a family of four is $48,000, according to Carlos
Romero 'BO, the city's vice mayor a number that is at least
half the median income in Palo Alto.
The lack of a Stanford presence in East Palo Alto is for sev
eral reasons. For one, the University does not own any land in
the area, as it does in cities such as Menlo Park, Palo Alto and
Redwood City, said Larry Horton, senior associate vice presi
dent of government and community relations at Stanford.
Although Romero said Stanford's largest economic impact
on the city comes from employment opportunities at the Uni
versity, even those numbers are marginal. According to the
Public Affairs report, only 302 University employees came
from East Palo Alto of more than 20,000 total employees, de
spite a rising unemployment rate in the city.
"There's a rather significant number, I can't say how much,
of undocumented citizens in East Palo Alto," Romero said.
"Generally, those folks don't work for the University because
they look for documents like that."
What the University doesn't invest in dollars, it may try to
make up for in time. East Palo Alto is a hotbed for communi
ty service endeavors spearheaded by programs at the Haas
Center, student organizations and
several professional schools, such as
the Schools of Education and Law.
In fact, Tom Schnaubelt, execu
tive director of Haas, said the organi
zations volunteering in East Palo
Alto are so numerous that keeping
track of exactly how many groups,
students and hours are devoted to
the city is almost impossible.
Haas itself runs five organizations
focused on East Palo Alto projects
and Schnaubelt said the center has
sent at least one student volunteer to
East Palo Alto every year since the
center's opening in 1985.
"The University was founded as a
public service," Schnaubelt said,
adding that in the founding grant,
Jane Stanford explicitly wished for
students to "become of greater serv
ice to the public."

But with the public-service im
pulse come challenges.
While time and transportation
stand out as the most obvious obsta
cles, there's also the fact that Stan
ford students are still outsiders in
East Palo Alto, a conundrum that no
amount of time, effort or money can
solve.

"One of our main challenges is to
ensure that students are prepared for
ethical and effective service in any
community, which requires, among
other things, that we set aside our
own hubris, avoid treating the com
munity as a 'laboratory' for research
or experimentation with interven
tion theories, and that we honor our
commitments," Schnaubelt said.
"East Palo Alto has a rich history,
and students should be exposed to,
have a basic understanding of, and
learn to honor and respect this histo
ry before attempting to 'fix' any
thing."
