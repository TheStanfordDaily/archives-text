## PIAZZZA-PALOOZA A 						look at how Nath's homework-help Stanford startup went public 
### STEPHANIE SARA CHONG DESK EDITOR 
A hypothetical (or, for
many, a very real) sce
nario: you're stuck on a
problem set. It's four in
the morning, and you
have only six hours left to tackle that
seemingly impossible problem, show
er (it's been a few days) and survive
the long haul to your teaching assis
tant's office just to hand in your hard
work.

So, where can you turn for help?
Let's be honest your professor
went to bed long before you even
started your homework. You're not
quite on a texting basis with your
classmates. Everyone in your fluores
cent-lit dorm with the exception
of that insomniac kid who spends
every night playing Internet
backgammon is asleep.
"Stuck? Need help? Just ask."
That's the tagline of www.piazzza.
com.

Perhaps best described as the
mule of Coursework and Wikipedia,
Piazzza is an online and, conse
quently, 24/7 homework helper.
Piazzza, whose name comes from
the Italian word "piazza" (a com
mon place for people to come to
gether), aims to mimic the classroom
setting. Using a question-and-an
swer format, students, TAs and pro
fessors alike can post questions and
offer answers. Piazzza employs a
wiki-forum interface to facilitate on
line discussion, whereby users can
repeatedly edit each other's answers
so as to ultimately produce a single,
comprehensive answer to each ques
tion.

Pooja Nath, founder and CEO of
Piazzza and recent graduate of Stan
ford Graduate School of Business,
was inspired by her undergraduate
experience. One of four women in a
computer science class of 60 at lIT
Kanpur (India), she said she em
pathized with any confused and help
less student.
"I'd been in students' shoes
frustrated, up late nights, unable to
get help on problem sets when I
needed it," Nath said. "Existing solu
tions didn't cut it... I was too shy to
interact with the majority of my class
mates. The few I knew often would be
stuck like me."

It was Nath's experience in the
working world she has held jobs at
Oracle, Kosmix and Facebook

that taught her the value of personal
ized mentorship. Later, as she was
completing her two-year master's at
Stanford this past spring, Nath finally
recruited a group of developers and
brought Piazzza into fruition.
In its initial stages, Piazzza started
out in private beta.

The Piazzza team had to reach out
directly to professors, who then intro
duced the website to their students.
Developers have worked all summer
to improve the website in prepara
tion for public launch this autumn
quarter and upping last quarter's
user count of 200 tenfold.
Professor Peter DeMarzo of the
Graduate School of Business, one of
the first to experiment with Piazzza in
the classroom, affirmed that he
would continue utilizing the website

in future classes. For

him, Piazzza helped
most in reducing e-mail
traffic of the same ques
tion over and over.

The big advantage for
my class was the fact that

teaching assistants could answer

a question once and many students
could see that answer," DeMarzo
said. "This became a repository avail
able to all the students."

Despite its usefulness, Marzo
noted that Piazzza was not without its
flaws. He disliked the website's op
tion for users to show up anonymous.
"It was more effective when ques
tions were not anonymously asked
versus anonymously asked," he ob
served. "People were just more
thoughtful about their questions
when it wasn't anonymous."
Another likely concern about
anonymity concerns the honor code:
would easily accessible information
on the Piazzza wiki-forum provide
more opportunities to cheat?
"We actually haven't had profes
sors running into honor code issues,"
said Ravi Sankar 'l2, a Piazzza team
member. "I think part of it is that pro
fessors tell their students what's rea
sonable. And out of respect for their
professor, even if they're able to be
anonymous, it seems like students
have been observing that."
Sankar's unique perspective as
both a Piazzza user and developer
has helped him define clear objec-

I tives for the
' product. One
was trying to
build a sense of

* online community
among classmates.

The developers have

also sought to exploit

game mechanics, which would incen
tivize students to post more frequent
ly-

"We have this sidebar that says,
like, 'X person answered this ques
tion in less than three minutes for
the win,"' described Sankar. After
conducting more than 50 hours of
surveys, the developers learned that
users even non-computer science
majors enjoyed playing this virtu
al game that they had, in a sense, in
vented for themselves.
To use or not to use: that is the
question.Those students who already
have suitable study groups may not
be jumping for joy at the thought of
another homework helper. But for
new students about to dive headfirst
into their freshman year, Piazzza may
be something of a lifejacket.
"With Piazzza, collaboration be
comes flexible and it complements
the classroom experience anytime,
anywhere with anyone," summarized
Cyrus Khajvandi 'll, another Piazzza
team member. "I wish I had Piazzza
when I first came to college."
