Mark Applebaum

Hometown: Chicago, 111.
Undergrad: Carleton College, music major
Grad school: UC-San Diego, doctorate in

music composition
Fan of: The 1990s Chicago Bulls

Hobbies: Inventing silly games with my

daughter, cooking, tap dancing, traveling
to places where people have different as

sumptions about life

#1 on my playlist: I try not to listen
to music because it's a job for me.
Favorite book: anything by Chuck
Klosterman
Favorite movie: This Is Spinal Tap

If you could only eat one food group for the
rest of your life, would it be grains, meat,
vegetables or fruit?: Which food group is the
Pop Tart in? How about a group comprising only salt,
MSG, high fructose corn syrup, partially hydrogenat
ed vegetable oil, sodium nitrates and Bacos? I think
that might even be vegan...
If I hadn't gone into academia, I'd be: in
prison
Department: Music
eClasses taught: This fall, "Readings in Music Th-

ory." Winter,

"Rock, Sex, and Rebel-

lion." Spring, "The British Inva
sion."

Primary research interest/project: I com
pose uncompromising and unmarketable experi
mental music and build sound-sculptures (instru
ments made of junk, hardware and found objects
mounted on electroacoustic soundboards and
played with chopsticks, wind-up toys, violin bows and
plectra).
