## POURING IT ON Women's soccer: offense erupts as Card routs Hawaii 9-0 
### SAM SVOBODA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The No. 2 Stanford women's soccer team
began its three-game homestand in impressive
fashion Thursday night at Cagan Stadium,
trouncing Hawaii (2-8) by a final score of 9-0.
The Card was dominant in all aspects of the
game, getting goals from seven players and out
shooting Hawaii 33-3 overall.
"The team is coming into mid-season form,
starting to play well," said Stanford coach Paul
Ratcliffe. "There were a lot of different faces
scoring goals tonight, so it was really good to
see."

Stanford (7-0-2) kicked off the scoring less
than three minutes into the match. Junior for
ward Lindsay Taylor received the ball just out
side of the box on the left side before cutting in
side to create a shooting angle. She was still a
long way out but struck a beautiful curling shot
over the keeper and in off the underside of the
crossbar.

Just a minute later, senior forward Christen
Press had a chance to double the advantage as
she found herself one-on-one with Hawaii
keeper Kanani Taaca after a beautiful long ball
by center back Alina Garciamendez. However,
her near-post attempt was kept out by the div
ing keeper.

In the ninth minute, Press put junior Teresa
Noyola in behind the defense, and the midfield
er unselfishly played the ball across for Taylor
to tap in her second goal of the game. With that
score, the Cardinal went up 2-0.
Stanford did not let up and the barrage con
tinued a minute later. Taaca slid to collect a
loose ball in the box but could not hold onto it,
and Press swooped in to slot the ball into the
open net.

Noyola hit the post from the top of the box
in the 18th minute, and Morgan Redman struck
the post after some nifty footwork in the 32nd
minute, Redman got her goal in the 37th
minute, again displaying some good dribbling
to win a penalty and then smashing the ball in
from the spot.

Once again, the Cardinal struck within a
minute of the previous goal. Sophomore Mar
jani Hing-Glover blasted a left-footed effort in
off the far post from 25 yards out on the right to
make it 5-0. The half would end with that score,
with Stanford holding an 18-1 edge in shots.
Stanford had its starters back in to begin the
2nd half, and Noyola made it 6-0 six minutes

Playing with a full student body on campus for the first time this season, the Cardinal was firing on all cylinders Thursday night. The scoring started early, with junior forward Lindsay Taylor, above, scoring the first goal in under three minutes. It was all the Card would need in the 9-0 shutout.
after the interval. Defender Rachel
Quon popped up on the left side to
head a high ball into the box back
across the face of goal, and Noyola
poked it home.
As was the trend on the night, it
was 7-0 inside a minute later. Senior
midfielder Allison McCann stole the
ball at midfield and drove all the way
down the pitch before coolly slotting
it past Christina Ehrett, who had re
placed Taaca in goal at halftime, into

the corner of the goal.
Press headed in number eight off
a cross from Noyola with 28 minutes
remaining, and that was the last
touch of the ball before all the
starters were subbed out for good.
Still, the Cardinal scored once more
with nine minutes remaining as
freshman Taylor McCann knocked
in her first collegiate goal on a long
range missile that a diving Ehrett
could not get a hand on. Hing-
Glover nearly made it double digits a
few minutes later, only to see her
blast tipped against the crossbar by
Ehrett. The match ended 9-0.
Stanford will now turn its atten
tion to the marquee matchup of the

weekend, a home date with Portland
on Saturday night. The Pilots (10-0-
0) currently sit third in the national
rankings, just behind Stanford. Last
weekend they had another top-10
clash, defeating No. 6 Texas A&M 1-
0 at home. Last night they took on
Cal in Berkeley, earning a 3-1 road
victory over the Golden Bears.
The game on Saturday will be a
rematch of the 2008 NCAA quarter
final match between Stanford and
Portland. The Cardinal won that
match, earning a berth in the College
Cup, where the team made a return
trip last year. If the team can get a
victory tomorrow night, it would cer
tainly be a statement that the Card is

ready to make it three trips in a row.
With No. 1 North Carolina losing to
Boston College last night, the na
tion's top ranking will likely be on
the line.
Still, Ratcliffe maintains that na
tional rank is not a concern.
"We just want totakecareof busi
ness, just win the game," he said.
"Portland's a great team. We have a
lot of respect [for them], so it'll be a
tough opponent. Hopefully we can
play our best and get a good result."
The match kicks off at Cagan Sta
dium at 7 p.m. tomorrow night.
