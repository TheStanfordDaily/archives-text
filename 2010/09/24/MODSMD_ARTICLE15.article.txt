# Our'other' problem: fixing matches
## 
### Tom Taylor 
It's not a great time to be a fan of
the Pakistani cricket team. In
March 2009, gunmen attacked a
bus carrying the Sri Lankan team
during its tour of Pakistan. Six
policemen and a driver died, while
seven players and an assistant coach
were injured. In response to the attack
and the security fears it raised, other na
tions canceled tours to Pakistan and
the International Cricket Council
(ICC) stripped the country of its host
ing privileges for the 2011 World Cup.
Adding insult to injury, its great rival
India will now jointly host the event
with Sri Lanka and Bangladesh.
This summer, the Pakistani team
was given a home in England, allowing
it to continue playing "home" interna
tional fixtures. After several games
against local sides and a couple of good
results against Australia, it then went on
to play an ill-fated series of matches
against England.
Allegations of match-fixing
emerged at the end of August, and as
the police began to investigate, three
players were suspended and sent
home. Then, just as it looked like Pak
istan was finally managing to put this
behind it, last Friday, with a good win
over England, the whole thing resur
faced. The very next day, evidence
emerged of spot-fixing in that same
game, calling into question whether or
not the two remaining matches could
even be played.
Spot-fixing is a less extreme form of
match-fixing. Players might be made to
bowl a certain number or pattern of
wides when the ball is thrown too
far from the stumps or told to score
fewer than a certain number of runs
when batting. The whole point is that
some shadowy character behind the
scenes bribes a player to do this and
then makes large sums of money by
betting on these pre-determined out
comes.
Now, bending the rules is so much a
part of all sports that someone coined
the term "gamesmanship" to make it
seem a little less dishonest. But there
are two types of cheating that should
anger even the most blase fan: doping
and match-fixing.
Both of these have repeatedly con
spired to shake the very foundations of
major sports and teams.
Every year or so, one Olympic
champion or another has his or her
gold medals stripped after taking ille
gal substances, and in one particularly
strong example, the 2007 Tour de
France was brought to its knees as
rider after rider failed blood tests.
Even as the drug-testing agencies be
come more adept at catching cheats,
those producing or administering the
substances still manage to remain one
step ahead with new chemicals and
new ways to fool the tests.
Evidence of serious match-fixing
brought serious consequences for four
of the major clubs in Italian Serie A in
2006, with league winner Juventus
stripped of its previous two titles and
relegated to Serie B. At the Singapore
Grand Prix in 2008, the Renault team
took the idea to extremes by ordering
one of its drivers to crash, and in so
doing, put its other driver in a position
to win the race. On a close-walled street
circuit, this could have led to serious in
jury or even death.
Both doping and match-fixing de
value sport, robbing spectators and par
ticipants of the chance to watch and
play an honest contest. Renault even
proved that both can be physically dan
gerous, making match-fixing in that
case seem even riskier than injecting
unknown substances into one's veins.
As a fan, though, I have to say that dop
ing is the lesser of the two evils.
While I definitely don't condone it, I
can understand why, in the highly com
petitive world of professional sports,
some might choose to take illegal sub
stances. This is a world where the differ
ence between gold and forgettable can
be just a few tenths of a second. Athletes
risk a lot, both their careers and their
health, but at the end of the day, they are
still doing what comes naturally: trying
to win.
Though in some cases of match-fix
ing there is still someone cheating to
win, there is always someone doing the
opposite: trying to lose or, at best, to
play at a certain level less than his or
her ability. That is something that goes
against every axiom of sporting. No
child grows up dreaming of the day
they can walk out onto the field and
pretend to play just enough to fool the
watching crowds into believing they
saw a real game.
That is simply not sport. It deserves
to be on a stage or a movie screen,
where everyone knows the participants
are acting out a script.

In the very worst way, match-fixers
let down everyone. For the sake of a few
extra pennies, they sell out their teams,
their fans and those closest of all to
them: their teammates.
