## OH, SWEET NUTHIN'! The 						Summer of Infinite Jest 
### Roseann Cima 
£ Q ~W"nfinite Jest" is one of those post-
I modern supernovels. It clocks in
J. around 1,000 pages and has more
than 400 footnotes. And everybody's reading

I had this impression a few months back. I
figured it was either selective attention on
my part, or one of those more-or-less local
ized book fads that occasionally occur in the
more pretentious circles. Finally it happened
that when I swung home and couldn't find
my copy of "Catcher in the Rye," 1 I found
that giant blue-sky-jacketed behemoth was
just about levitating off the shelf and into my
backpack. 11 At page 250,1 mentioned it to an
archist friends, and one informed me that
reading the book was actually an Internet
meme this summer. So everybody is reading
it. (So much as can be said for a post-modern
supernovel.)
In fact, the last time I knew so many peo
ple reading the same book I was reading was
high school, and those books were mostly
forced upon us. That was top-down organiza
tion, fodder from the Powers That Be. This is
grassroots. This is a whole generation of read
ers Saying Yes.
I feel like a book like this, one without sexy
vampires or prepubescent wizards, hasn't
been said yes to in quite some time. The last
few decades were dominated by video and
music. 111 These things are easy to acquire,
consume and pass along. Books, on the other
hand, take time to read. Send someone a
You Tube link and he knows that it's a 2:53
commitment. Ask him to read a book and
you're asking for weeks, maybe months. A
personal recommendation just isn't going to
cut it. lv But now that we have a Cloud, and
things like it, the Cloud can recommend
reading material. My News Feed knows that
a friend of a friend of a friend is reading "In
finite Jest" and thinks it's possibly the Best
Book of All Time (the B-8.0.A.T). And if I
need to hear somewhere around 20 glowing
recommendations of a book by people I
judge to have reasonably similar tastes to
mine before I read it, I'm going to hit that
tally, well, about three weeks ago.
Written by the late great David Foster
Wallace v in the mid "90s, the book jacket plot
to "Jest" revolves around a video so enter
taining that you'll die watching it. The way
the book approaches this with a myriad of
tight plots and complex characters, an ele
gant dystopia and some sometimes-moving,
sometimes-mind-bending lyrical-essay-type
things, is nothing short of dazzling. It's very
appropriate that the book is eponymous with
the Highly Addictive video. I'm not halfway
through, but if I were the kind of person to
call artistic endeavors "triumphs," I would
call it a triumph.
What percentage of current "Jest" readers
will become "Jest" veterans remains to be
seen. But all of a sudden there's something

new in our cultural vocabulary. Sure it was
written by a bandana-wearing white guy who
signed love letters "Young Werther," had an
ex-girlfriend's name carved into his arm and
said shit like "Fiction's about what it means
to be a fucking human being." vl - vu But he
was also a genius and I think this sudden
wave of influence is going to have a lasting
impact. Call it a pivot point. A revolution.
Goethe may have caused a spike in the rates
of suicide by sensitive young Germans when
he released "The Sorrows of Young
Werther," but he also kicked off the Roman
tic Movement. If this is the Next Big Thing, at
least it'll be endlessly entertaining.

i I intend to reread it soon. I have theories
about this book, no doubt forthcoming in
later columns.
ii Though as someone who's been lugging a
hardcover copy around for the past few weeks,
I can tell you it does not actually levitate.
iii There's also something to be said here about
the grassroots v. broadcast media. The only
way grassroots popularity happened before
the Internet was word-of-mouth, which only
worked with music because TV and cinema
were too expensive to make on your own, and
there's something about a catchy tune, even
with low-production values, that makes it
spread like wildfire.
iv Unless he really loves you.
v AKA DFW (BTW)
vi These things were published in a New Yorker
article shortly after his death. I remember
thinking to myself, "Dear God, this is going to
spawn such an annoying cult."
vii It is now that I admit, with some horror, to have
recently started wearing a white bandana.
