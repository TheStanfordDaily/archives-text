## Stanford football should be held to higher standard 
### 
Let us reject a six-win total for Stanford
football's bowl eligibility. Let us set a new
standard for ourselves and for the nation to
consider: Stanford University will send its
football team to a bowl game only if it has
won at least nine games of a 12-game season.
It seems to me that my personal history
with college football and with Stanford foot
ball provides a vivid and valuable back
ground and grounding for my suggested inno
vation.
Until my senior year as an electrical engi
neering student at Buffalo Technical High
School in Buffalo, N.Y., I was barely aware of
the existence of Stanford University. My fa
vorite football team was Bud Wilkinson's Ok
lahoma Sooners. It was the early 19505.
In those days, there were virtually only
four bowl games Rose, Orange, Sugar,
Cotton. Only the very best teams played in
them. (A couple minor bowls Sun, Gator
and a few specialty contests such as the
East-West Shrine Game, which was played to
benefit crippled children, completed the post
season picture.)
By the time of my senior year at "Tech,"
travels to California had brought Stanford
University brightly to my attention. I quickly
decided it was the school for me, and it was
the only one to which I applied.
In my freshman year, 1953-54, we upset
No. 1 UCLA at Homecoming. We came to
our last game, the Big Game. If we won, we'd
go to the Rose Bowl. If we tied games
could end in ties back then we wouldn't.
We raced to a 21-7 lead. Final score: Stanford
21,Ca121.1'1l never forget the headline in The
Stanford Daily the following Monday: NO
BODY WON, BUT WE LOST. It still hurts.
I played sousaphone in the Stanford
Marching Band, reveling in the rehearsals
and performances of halftime shows for the
football team. A music major, I was the lead
composer for Big Game Gaieties of 1955 and
1956. In the summer of 1955, I was house

manager at Toy on Hall for the football team's
preseason practice. I got to know legendary
coach Chuck Taylor and ate at the training
table with the team. Stanford football and I
have a richly varied history.
On Nov. 7,2009, when we brilliantly upset
No. 8 Oregon, 51-42,1 was deeply disapprov
ing as well as ecstatic. It was a downer because
we had become "bowl-eligible." It was our
sixth win of the year, and these days, all one
has to do to become eligible to go to a bowl is
win six games in the season. We play a 12-
game schedule. Do we really want a 6-6 Stan
ford football team to go to a bowl? I say no.
Bowl games have multiplied and cheap
ened ridiculously since my student days on
the Farm. There are 35 now. I remember well
a cartoon of almost half a century ago that
joked that a new bowl had been created for
left-handed redheads from the Dakotas.

Last year, I wasn't exactly excited when
our 8-4 team went to the Sun Bowl. Most
ironic for me was the 7-5 team that beat us
there, 31-27: my old favorites, the Oklahoma
Sooners.

I swell with pride over academically pres
tigious Stanford repeatedly winning the Di
rectors' Cup for No. 1 overall excellence in
NCAA Division I collegiate athletics. That is
the Stanford I prize a Stanford of out
standing value from head to toe.
1 urge President John L. Hennessy, Athlet
ic Director Bob Bowlsby, head coach Jim
Harbaugh and the whole Stanford family to
come together and repudiate six-wins bowl
eligibility for Stanford football, saying that a
Stanford football team will go to a bowl game
only if it has won at least nine games in a 12-
game season.
Let us lead the way to a new realm of high
standards and high quality in human en
deavor.
