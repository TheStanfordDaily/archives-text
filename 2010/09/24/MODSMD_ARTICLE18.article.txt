# SENSE AND NONSENSE
## The 						Grounded Student Explorer 
### Aysha Bagchi 
On a beautiful,sunny day this past sum
mer (one that seemed made for an
outdoor adventure), I visited the
beach in San Francisco. As I was looking out
over the Pacific Ocean, I was struck by a
sense of the possibility so many must have
felt over the past hundreds and even thou
sands of years when what lay beyond that
vast expanse was a true and total mystery.
Even to my modern self, simply thinking that
undiscovered country (undiscovered, at
least, by me!) lay beyond my sight seemed to
infuse life with greater promise. It felt a bit
like my first day at Stanford three years ago:
possibility abounded in the fog of an unde
termined four years.
College is a unique opportunity in life to
broaden our perspectives, to let new experi
ences upend our views of the world, to reserve
a few years in order to delve into unknown
territories. We have at our fingertips so many
different troves of knowledge, ways of think
ing, opportunities to branch out on campus as
well as experience more of the world. Yet this
sort of exploration is, at least in the tradition
al sense, increasingly undervalued.
The formal exploration apparatus re
mains intact with such things as study-abroad
opportunities, two years to choose our ma
jors, breadth requirements and a hugely di
verse set of options to explore. Yet students
feel intense pressure to settle down, to focus,
to excel in narrow areas. A fear of bad grades
can keep us from other disciplines. Anticipa
tion of the job market can turn us toward pre
professional tracks. Our desire for the es
teem of those around us can push us toward
specific targets that others have chosen for
us. Even the University, in following immedi
ate financial incentives, can nudge us toward
paths in which we directly see how what we
do is applied to a narrow aim. If college is a
time of questioning and exploring, it is in
creasingly only on the most personal levels,

with little relation our public pursuits.
There are legitimate strengths to this
modern trend. It reflects student acknowl
edgment of economic and family pressures,
and a student population that is not suffi
ciently privileged to ignore them. And just
imagine the seemingly self-indulgent atti
tude of a student whose life is entirely about
journeying into the world with no tangible
objectives in mind, whose aims in life amount
to nothing beyond voyages for self-discovery.
Her attitude is founded on the premise that
she has no ties holding her down to the world,
no fellow beings to take into account when
directing her life course. She is aloof, perhaps
even solipsistic. This is no foreign image: the
traditional Princeton man of the 1950s who
spent his college career "developing charac
ter" while not showing much concern for
things that actually seem to matter in the
world comes to mind. Today, students care
about many things beyond themselves, and
pursue them; and that's progress.
Yet I want to push back against this mod
ern trend, if only a few inches. A time for in
tellectual, artistic, social and personal explo
ration is so important for those who go on to
try to benefit the world. Indeed, without this
kind of discovery, we would foreclose every
possibility we cannot see lying before us,
would limit our futures to the specific objec
tives we already have in mind and the steps
we have worked out to get us there. That is

not the formula to be positive change-mak
ers. Indeed, that is not the formula for any
kind of fundamental change. Without learn
ing to question those around us and our
selves, without developing the humility
about our own beliefs that comes from explo
ration and discoveries that end up challeng
ing them, we never develop the capacity to
think independently, be self-critical and go
against the grain.
Nor do we develop the kind of inner char
acter that can sustain us through whatever
we choose to pursue in the world. Take a sim
ple example: many young people are going
into public service today through programs
such as Teach For America, but burning out a
few years later and heading in another direc
tion. They feel a tremendous perhaps al
most programmed drive to help the
world, but their college careers may not have
been the recipes to develop the inner realms
and self-understanding to sustain that energy
over time. They may not have cultivated for
themselves a soil that is deep enough to plant
their seeds of discontent.
Perhaps this is the reason that, so often,
the greatest achievers both in college and
other realms are the ones who do not start
out running. Rather, they start by slowing
down and exploring, by leaving themselves
open enough to be touched and transformed
in ways they could not have foreseen. They
are the ones who, without naivety or idle self
ishness, view college as a time to discover and
come into themselves. Call them the ground
ed student explorers; not only do they devel
op capacities to achieve great things, but they
may also be more likely to look back on their
college careers as ones they chose for them
selves, and would choose again.
