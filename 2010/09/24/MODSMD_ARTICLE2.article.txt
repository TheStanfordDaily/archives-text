## After three big wins, the Cardinal hits the road to face a struggling Notre Dame 
### KABIR SAWHNEY MANAGING EDITOR 
In its first and only trip outside the West Coast
this season, the No. 16 Stanford football team
travels to South Bend, Ind., this week for its annu
al game with rival Notre Dame.The Cardinal (3-0,
1-0 Pac-10) has not won at Notre Dame since 1992
and has lost seven straight games at Notre Dame
Stadium, but recent history favors it Stanford
won the last meeting between the two teams, last
season's finale in Stanford Stadium.

The Fighting Irish (1-2) enter Saturday's game
desperate for a win to salvage its first season
under new head coach Brian Kelly. After winning
its first game of the season against Purdue, Notre
Dame has dropped its last two games. It lost to
Michigan by four points before losing last week to
Michigan State, this time by three points.
For Stanford, a team ready to justify its highest
national ranking at this point in a season since
1972, this game provides the first big test of the
season.The Cardinal also is looking to start 4-0 for
the first time since 1986 and keep up its momen
tum heading into its two biggest games of the sea
son: Oct. 2 at No. 5 Oregon and Oct. 9 at home
against No. 20 Southern California.
Through its first three games, Stanford looks
like a team capable of winning its first Pac-10 title
since the 1999 season. After flattening cupcake
Sacramento State, the Card went on the road and
dismantled UCLA 35-0 before coming home and
routing Wake Forest 68-24.
The Cardinal can thank quarterback Andrew
Luck more than any other player for its hot start
to the season. The redshirt sophomore's perform
ance thus far doesn't just have Stanford fans
dreaming of the Rose Bowl; he has shot to the top
of ESPN's NFL draft board and has emerged on
Heisman watch lists around the country. His num
bers certainly have been gaudy. He has thrown for
674 yards and 10 touchdowns while completing
64.3 percent of his passes and throwing no inter
ceptions, and has a passer rating of 192.3. He also
has shown a lot of athleticism, and while he isn't a
true dual-threat quarterback, he can create of
fense with his legs, rushing for 140 yards through
Stanford's first three games.
Luck has emerged as an extremely capable and
effective offensive leader as well. In last week
end's game against Wake Forest, Luck was at the
helm for eight Cardinal drives, and all eight went
for touchdowns.
The Stanford running attack hasn't slowed
down at all either, even though it is employing a
rotation of backs. Led by the sophomore duo of
Stepfan Taylor and Tyler Gaffney, the unit is
ranked 14th in the country, rolling up 242 yards
per game. The Cardinal offensive line has shown

why it is praised as one of the country's best, open
ing up big holes for Taylor and redshirt freshman
Usua Amanam and pushing the pile forward for
Gaffney's power runs. Both the running and pass
ing games should have a good day against a Notre
Dame defense that is ranked 102 nd in the country.
Notre Dame's offensive attack is no pushover,
however. The passing offense, led by first-year
starter Dayne Crist, ranks eighth in the nation in
yards per game. Crist has thrown for 851 yards and
seven touchdowns while surrendering two inter
ceptions. He will provide a solid test for a Stanford
defense that is currently No. 1 in the nation in pass
defense.
Indeed, it is Stanford's defensive performance
that most will be keeping an eye on. Entering this
season, Luck and the offense were expected to
power the team, but the defense seems much im
proved from last season, especially after shutting
down UCLA and holding Wake Forest to 10
points before the starters were removed. Overall,
the defense is ranked sixth, and while this ranking
might slip as the Card moves into the teeth of its
Pac-10 schedule, it should provide enough

NOTES: No. 16 Stanford takes its only road trip outside of the
West Coast as it visits Notre Dame. The Fighting Irish are on a
two-game losing streak, after dropping close games to Michi
gan and Michigan State. Stanford's pass defense, led by junior
Michael Thomas, is currently ranked No. 1 in the nation, and
will be tested by Notre Dame quarterback Dayne Crist.

With the departure of Heisman runner-up Toby Gerhart, the Cardinal has employed a backfield by committee in 2010.
One of the biggest contributors has been sophomore Stepfan Taylor, above, who is averaging more than 50 yards a game.
