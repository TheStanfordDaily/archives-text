## Kele Okereke and Does It Offend You, Yeah? Review 
### â€“ ryan MAC contact ryan: rbmac@stanford. edu 
It's always a bit scary when a member of a
band you love gets his own little bit of
individualistic intuition and decides to
split off for a side project. Of course, it hap
pens all the time, and there are some that revel
in success. But more often than not, it ends in
disappointment, unfair comparisons to origi
nal work and leaving much to be desired.
On Saturday, Kele Okereke took over San
Francisco's Mezzanine to provide the Bay Area
with its first taste of his debut solo album,
"The Boxer." Delayed from the originally
scheduled July performance at Popscene, the
show represented something of a reincarna
tion of the Bloc Party front man, whose
reserved front was left backstage as he opted
for an animated performance full of crowd
banter and shirtless dance moves.
But before Kele came on, the stage was
warmed by Pennsylvania's Innerpartysystem
and the always-popular, radio announcer
nightmare Does It Offend You, Yeah? Touring
in support of their newest single, "American
Trash," Innerpartysystem kicked off the night,
bursting through the smoke and lasers with
energetic synths and fat cymbal hits. Yet while
the energy was there, the trio was your average
group of laptop junkies, trapped behind their
synths and allowing for little to no crowd
interaction at such an intimate venue. Also,
someone please tell lead singer Patrick Nissley
that berets died with scrappy pop punk.
For some at Mezzanine, the main draw of
the night wasn't Kele, but rather English com
rades Does It Offend You, Yeah?, whose show
exceeded all expectations even with lead singer
James Rushent absent. Really, how many
bands can lose their singer and still play a

solid 50-minute set? With Rushent out of
commission due to illness, the remaining
foursome stormed the stage with a variety of
mainly instrumental hits ranging from "Battle
Royale" to new selections off their soon-to-be
released sophomore LP, "Don't Say We Didn't
Warn You."
Guitarist Matty Derham took over crowd
conversation duty for the night, as the band
used the gig to gauge crowd reaction to new
material. And if circle moshes and obligatory
crowd surfing are any indication, the second
album should get the fast track to immediate
release. Putting a rough tour behind them
one which has seen band members fall ill,
mugged and sent to the ER after stage-diving
mishaps DIOYY played an ear-raiding set,
as they alternated lead mic duties. Of particu
lar note were new track, "We Are The Dead,"
whose live power overwhelmed the free
recording on the band's website, and fan
favorite, "We Are Rockstars," which sent
Derham flying into the crowd to close out the
set.
While the crowd was already sweating
from the previous whirlwind, Kele took the
stage well past midnight, insisting that the party
was only just beginning. Sporting Adidas gym
shorts and a Public Enemy shirt, the Bloc Party
leader immediately cast aside reservations
regarding his withdrawn stage persona, launch
ing into crowd conversations that ranged in
topic from drug paraphernalia found on stage
to girl fights. Yet, even larger questions
remained over Kele's material: Could it sustain
a long set? Could it set him apart from earlier
