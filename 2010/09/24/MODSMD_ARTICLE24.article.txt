On a chilly Monday evening,
Cubberley Auditorium was packed,
students and the public alike
jammed into cushy seats, elbow-to-elbow,
waiting for the event to start. Author Joyce
Carol Oates stood beneath the heavy blue
curtains in an airy white top, looking much
tinier than her reputation would suggest.
After participating in the annual Three
Books event the day before, the prolific
author gave a reading and book-signing ses
sion sponsored by the Office of the Vice
Provost for Undergraduate Education and
Stanford Continuing Studies. Oates, famed
for writing volume after volume, has writ
ten over 50 books since 1963.
Monday night, Oates decided to read a
piece, "1.D.," recently published in the
March 2010 edition of The New Yorker.
"1.D.," a story about an adolescent forced to
identify a dead body, brought together
themes of fear, denial and loneliness that
many can relate to on some level.
Her characters, particularly the young
Lisette, were developed in a compelling
fashion. Her language, too, was powerful,
evoking empathy and at the very end, a gut
punch so characteristically Oates that even
the author herself was moved, wiping away

tears almost apologetically as she concluded
the reading.
But while the content of the story was
moving, her delivery was less so.
Approximately 10 minutes into the
reading, it was somewhat difficult to follow
the story's trajectory. The story followed the
narrator's stream of consciousness, and
without a clear destination, it was easy to
get lost.
This was partly due to Oates' reading
style, marked by little inflection aside from
her distinctive accent. She stood behind the
podium and read plainly, as if carrying on a
calm conversation. Less auditory audience
members seemed to let their minds wander
as Oates evenly delivered her story.
The crowd, however, perked up for the
question-and-answer session that followed.
Having Oates inject the atmosphere with
her personality and humor was an engaging
experience.
Playing to her setting, the author made
jokes about her time living in Phi Mu, a
sorority at Syracuse University, where the
girls lived in "hovels" among "garbage," only
to emerge at night to impress the
young men that visited.
Comparing writing to practicing
music, she also gave insight into the
evolution of her writing process: both
the constant revisions and her empha
sis on images and scenes rather than
sentences.
Oates' casual insight into the
process of writing humanized the lit
erary icon she has become. More than
being able to hear her short story
come alive, attendees could enjoy her

stage presence.
The connection Oates developed
with the audience served as a strong
reminder that as prolific and intimi
dating as she might sound on paper,
genius does not mean distance from
the lowly masses.
