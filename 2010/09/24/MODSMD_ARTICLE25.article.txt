The Walkmen have a history
of making loud, drunken,
lamenting music, the sort of
songs that are good for yelling at
absent exes on particularly painful
nights. "Lisbon," their sixth studio
album, generally a more subdued
collection of tracks than those
included in their past work, is a
wonderful achievement not
because their signature tirades are
gone (they're not), but because it
shows the band stretching itself and
expanding its range with offbeat
music genres. "Lisbon" upholds the
city and captures the best music the
band has to offer.
The track that sets the journey

off is "Juveniles," a soft,
lumbering track in
which frontman
Hamilton Leithauser
wheezes and howls his
way through a vague
story of a loved one, to
end with the perennial
line for describing
teenage society: "You're
one of us, or one of
them." With the

depressing downbeat, it's not diffi
cult to imagine the band getting
inspiration from sitting at a
Portuguese cafe, listening to an
artist play mournful fado, a local
melancholy music genre much like
Latin American trova.
"Angela Surf City" brings back
a little bit of the fast, furious and
loud signature sound from The
Walkmen. Crashing cymbals, an
accelerated drum line and lyrics
hollered into the microphone make
the track a whirlwind tour, and the
most energetic one on the album,
hands down.
Although the album is inspired
by travels in Europe, there is a
healthy dose of Americana imbed
ded in it, possibly as an allusion to
home. In the song "Blue As Your
Blood," a constant, twangy guitar
riff throughout recalls the score of
Western movies, while "Torch
Song" resolutely sounds like rocked
up bluegrass during the verses, with
a constant, steady beat played on
the guitar and drums. The band
even adds distinct instrumentation:
our own Mariachi Cardenal would
be proud to hear the mariachi
horns used to record the track
"Stranded," a wailing affair about
the dismal existence of the narrator.

"Woe Is Me" is another rare
gem in the package. With an upbeat
guitar riff and simple opening lyrics
that sound like something by Ezra
Koenig ("There's a girl you should
know/She was mine not so long
ago"), the track picks up the
rhythm of the album and, contrary
to what the title might suggest,
injects some youthfulness and beat
back into the musical experience.
All too soon "Lisbon," the final
track, rolls around and brings the
imaginary trip to Europe to a close.
A slow, morose song, it shuffles
along during a few minutes, a sad
tune about an outsider in a country
where he does not know the lan-

guage or the place. It's sadly touch
ing in its loneliness and isolation as
Leithauser sings "All the younger
kids/Have gone away to sleep," even
after the production arranged a
wonderfully swelling instrumenta
tion behind the weary guitar lines
and soft drums that provide the
backbone for the song. It gently
fades down over a beautiful, lazy
and hesitant guitar solo.
The best part about "Lisbon" as
an album is that it feels fresh and
sincere. The characteristic Walkmen
quality of the recording is spot on
Leithauser's hoarse pleading
voice coupled with the fuzzy reverb
from the guitars and bass make it
feel very intimate, not glossy and
packaged like most studio albums.
Listening to it, images of a lazy
European vacation, catching trains,
watching country houses and green
fields go by, or people watching at
the local cafe, are impossible to
ignore. Over the nearly 45 minutes
that make up the album, The
Walkmen have pulled off the per
fect soundtrack to the quintessential
European vacation.
