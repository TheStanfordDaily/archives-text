Everyone grows up. For sad,
die-hard fans, that statement
also applies to Weezer, the
90s alternative rock band fronted
by Rivers Cuomo, lord of the nerds.
People complain that the latest slew
of Weezer records pales in compar
ison to classics like "The Blue
Album" and "Pinkerton." Well,
they're right.
But it's pretty impossible to
expect a band that's been in the biz
for nearly 20 years not to experi
ment and change. That's not to
excuse their more awful albums of
late, particularly last year's
"Raditude," but let's be real here
Weezer hasn't and probably never
will be as good as those "Undone
(The Sweater Song)" or "El
Scorcho" glory days.
So thank god for "Hurley."
While it doesn't hold a candle
to older Weezer classics, the album
comfortably settles somewhere in
the middle of the band's discogra
phy, closer to "The Green Album"
and "Maladroit" than the newer
ones, which is probably the best we
can expect from them at this point.
It thankfully restores some hope to
exasperated fans.
The record, with its quirky

punk pop, is a step in the right
direction. Cuomo seems to be cop
ing with his mid-life crisis in a

more mature manner, staying away
from gimmicky songs and, for the
most part, cliched lyrics.
The album opens with new
single "Memories," a hook-driven
throwback to the Weezer of yester
year with lyrics like "watching all
the freaky Dutch kids vomit then
have sex," which are just bizarre
enough to work. It's followed by
"Ruling Me," possibly the best track
off "Hurley," filled with Weezer's
trademark amped-up guitars.
"Unspoken" is more uncharacteris
tic of Weezer, an almost stripped
acoustic ditty with a gentle flute
fluttering in the background that
masks its bitterer words about
unrealized dreams.
And then there are the mis
steps.

"Trainwrecks," while melodic
and nice to listen to, is crippled by
its hackneyed tripe about the trap
pings of the rock star life. "Where's
My Sex?" is easily the worst track
off "Hurley;" the tune gets particu
larly weird toward the end, when
the band awkwardly segues into a
doo-woppy rock interlude that feels

even more out of place after the
track suddenly switches back to its
original punkier sound.
Thankfully, "Smart Girls"
counteracts any damage inflicted by
"Brave New World" or "Where's My
Sex?" The joyous ode to the
brainier ladies is immediately lik
able and guaranteed to get stuck in
your head.
Like most campfire gather
rounds, "Hurley" is more about the
fun sing-a-longs than paving new
ground. It's clear Cuomo and co.
are no longer striving for greatness
or perfection but Weezer fans
are a fairly forgiving bunch so long
as the outfit supplies more enjoy
able records like "Hurley."
