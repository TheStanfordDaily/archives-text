Finding Jupiter is a year
old, four-piece rock outfit
that hails from our own
institution of higher learning.
Born amid the perpetual sun
shine and $50,000-a-year tuition
of Stanford, Calif., this futuristic
punk-rock band manages to
bring a much-needed edge to the
otherwise flawless veneer of the
Farm.
On their first studio album,
Sarah Masimore 'll, Dean
Schaffer 'lO, Luke Georgette 'lO
and Peter McDonald 'll deliver
12 tracks of awesomeness.
(Disclosure: McDonald is also a
Daily columnist.) Although it is a
relatively young band, its sound
is a far cry from the grungy,
unpolished garage bands whose
MySpace pages populate our
generation's collective conscious
ness. The members of Finding
Jupiter, whose bathroom-stall
photo shoot The Unofficial
Stanford Blog noted in August,
are real musicians. Their latest
release is not a crappy demo; it's
a full-blown rock album. And it's
worth the ridiculous tax on
iTunes.

Finding Jupiter's sound is a
pleasant blend of punk rock,
funk rock and folk. They boast
great guitars and groovy drums,
highlighted by Masimore's origi
nal vocals. Think Tegan and Sara
meets Maria Taylor and they all
make sweet, sweet love.
The album starts strong with
"Hey Whitney," a funkadelic ode
to unrequited love. If you're a fan
of angst, heartbreak and synco
pated beats, you'll love this song.
The band will be known for this
hit once it makes it big. Be sure
to give the reprise a good listen.
The acoustic version will melt
your heart and make you want to
do some serious requiting of
Masimore's love.
Other highlights include
"Carry," which channels an
outer-space vibe with its ethereal
guitar riff. This song is every
thing Incubus wanted to do but
couldn't. "Raze the City" features
a fresh and funky acoustic riff,
complete with Masimore's clear
vocals and sexy harmonies. She'll
send shivers down your spine as
she sings, "This girl is gonna
break my heart, and there's noth-

ing I can do about it."
Toward the latter half of the
album, "One More Night" has
the catchiest chorus, allowing
every member of the band to
show off their individual musical
styles.
All in all, it's an album full of
college rock hits. Their distinct
sound is not to be missed, and
they've clearly given each record
ing the TLC necessary to produce
a solid CD. My only regret is that
their brilliant rendition of
"Birthday Sex" didn't make it
onto the final track list. Be sure
to check out their live shows to
hear said cover. You'll thank me.
