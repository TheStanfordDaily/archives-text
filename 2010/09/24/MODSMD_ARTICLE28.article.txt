## Revealing the woman behind Charles Darwin 'Emma Darwin' Review 
### â€“ sarah GUAN contact sarah: sguan@stanford. edu 
This new title from the
University Press of Florida
rides on the success of pop
ular genres and trends in today's
literature, namely biography, his
torical romance and historical
accounts with strong female pro
tagonists. Upon delving into my
review copy, however, it was quite
apparent why the authors James D.
Loy and Kent M. Loy chose to pub
lish with an academic rather than a
commercial press. While "Emma
Darwin" is a great resource for his
torians, researchers and college stu
dents with papers due, it is not the
sort of book that would appeal to a
wider readership, regardless of how
hard the authors seem to try.
The premise of "Emma
Darwin," as presented on the back
flap, promises an insider's view into
the extraordinary journeys (mar
itime and otherwise) of the origi
nator of modern evolutionary the
ory and the equally compelling
woman who caught his eye, ran his
household and managed to put up
with her husband's many eccentric
ities and increasing irreverence for
religion. The reader is lured in by
the promise of adventures,
romance and heresy.
The book opens, however, with
a very dry, very dense account of
the Darwin-Wedgwood family's
genealogy (Charles and Emma, nee
Wedgwood, were cousins). It then
proceeds to explain, in great detail,
the family's various business ven
tures and political stances. Were it
not for the title of the book, the
reader would be hard-pressed to
tell which of the numerous
Wedgwood cousins was actually the
protagonist or if there was a
protagonist at all. The only hint
thereof is a page here and there
about Emma's various suitors, pre-
Charles, and her disinterest in all of
them.
The book gets better about 60
pages in, when we meet the intrep
id, somewhat rebellious Charles
Darwin, who became a naturalist
and went gallivanting around the
world, despite his father's original
insistence that he become a clergy

man. This is still, however, quite
problematic; the work is supposed
to be a biography of Emma rather
than Charles Darwin, and presum
ably, the authors found her an
interesting and fruitful enough
subject that they wrote an entire
book about her.
However, they do seem to real
ize, at this point, that they ought to
be writing for a broader audience;
they lay off the genealogy and soft
en their rather clinical style. Here,
the authors betray their unfamiliar-

ity with commercial writing. Their
attempts to sound more colloquial
and accessible are perhaps best
exemplified by their description of
Charles Darwin's hesitancy to
marry: he was supposedly afraid
that "marriage might cramp his
style."
While it is abundantly clear
that the authors are accomplished
historians the book is meticu
lously researched it is equally
clear that they have very little expe
rience with the craft of storytelling.
Most of the book reads as though it
were a very detailed plot summary
of a novel, rather than a compelling
story in its own right. While Green
Library would do well to acquire a
copy (and shelve it in the history
section), the average reader would
do better with traditional historical
fiction.
