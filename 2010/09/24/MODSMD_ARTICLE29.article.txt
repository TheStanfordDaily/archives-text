## 'Easy A' brings back high school laughs

The summer is cooling down
and the back-to-school blues
have put people in heat for a
good movie. If you are getting nostal
gic for your high school years, then
grab a few friends and go see "Easy A."
Despite the movie's title, the film will
take your mind off the grades and into
the gutter just in time for IHUM read
ing.
The movie follows the teenage
chronicles of one Olive (Emma
Stone). She is the generic smart school
girl who's never done anything wrong
and generally goes through life unno
ticed. Soon a rumor goes around
about her losing her virginity, brand
ing her as the school trollop. However,
instead of quelling these rumors,
Olives begins selling stories about hav
ing sex with the school's charity cases
so they might gain social status. In

turn, she also faces scrutiny from the
Christian students on campus and
supposedly finds her life modeling

that of Hester Prynne's from "The
Scarlet Letter." I personally didn't fully
buy the Hester Prynne metaphor, but
it works for the sake of the movie.

While the plot may read like an
overbearing tale of the trials and

tribulations of some high school out
cast, the film was anything but.
Overall, "Easy A" is more humorous
than dramatic. Whereas "The Scarlet
Letter" focuses on the harsh scrutiny
and ostracism Hester Prynne faces,
"Easy A" focuses more on the potency
that white lies about sexual promiscu

ity have on horny, insecure

high school kids.

Don't get
me wrong. The
film gets dra
matic. Yet even

the movie's most
heart-wrenching

moments are far over-

shadowed by the frequent

one-liners that fill the script. In fact,

the film is so charming, humorous
and quirky it is sometimes hard to
properly empathize with the main
character when necessary.

None of the scenes
are ever as heavy as

Hawthorne's writing,
but they can be equally
educational. We learn

that reading is more
important than watch
ing Demi Moore take a
bath not to mention
butter knives are clearly

a gateway into far more destructive
behavior.
Still, the movie's humor doesn't
solely thrive off its amusing script.
Instead, it's the colorful and believable

cast of characters that really make the
movie. First of all, Emma Stone's por
trayal of Olive is completely winning.
So much so that it's a bit of a reach to

imagine someone so attractive and
witty could be "the dorky, invisible
girl" of her high school in the first
place.
Some of the other characters
aren't as much of a stretch. Amanda
Bynes plays the preachy pastor's

daughter who leads the flock of self
righteous Christians into shunning
Olive's behavior. Penn Badgley plays
the corny yet lovable mascot. It's only

a slight verge off course from his usual
role of the dapper, intellectual love
interest. Lisa Kudrow plays the useless
guidance counselor who dishes out
more problems than advice.
However, the best characters have
to be Patricia Clarkson and Stanley
Tucci as Olive's parents. Clarkson's
mom is an easygoing free spirit who
discloses way too much information
about her sex life, while Tucci's dad is
as bitingly sarcastic as he is cerebral.
So altogether, it's a solid film.
Despite lack of literary merit and cast
ing someone way too hot in the "out
cast role" (this is Hollywood, after all),
the film's only flaw is being too funny
to be taken as more than it is. So if
your first set of papers and problem
sets has got you down, you can be sure
to get at least one "Easy A" this fall.

Emma Stone's Olive, right, may not be a believable outcast in "Easy A," but she certifies her comedy
chops with one-liners against the uber-religious Marianne, played by Amanda Bynes.
