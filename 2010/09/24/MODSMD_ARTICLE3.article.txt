# GAINING MOMENTUM
## Card hopes to continue turnaround this weekend 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH 
The Stanford men's soccer team opens
the Stanford Nike Classic under the lights
Friday night, playing St. Mary's at 7 p.m.
The team is set to face Denver on Sunday
afternoon in its final tune-up game before
conference play begins.
The Cardinal (2-4) came into the season
ranked 14th in the national polls, but was
left dumbfounded after dropping the first
four games of the season in heartbreaking
fashion. A late goal by senior forward Do
minique Yahyavi finally put the team in the
win column against USF, however, and a 4-
1 beat-down of Santa Clara at home gave
the players some much-needed confi
dence.

Senior defender Bobby Warshaw was
impressed by the way the team handled the
losing streak.
"Those were really tough losses, but the
guys are taking the lessons they learned
from them and getting better," he said. "We
weren't ever panicking, and we knew it was
going to come, but having the wins does im
prove the morale."
Head coach Bret Simon is also opti
mistic with the season still in its infancy.
"The first few games weren't great, but
we played better than the results showed,"
he said. "We came into the game against
USF knowing it might be the most difficult
game of the year because they always play
us tough, but we scratched and clawed our
way though that game. We need to keep up
that concentration and focus, but that type
of win can go a long way to giving you be
lief."
St. Mary's, the Cardinal's opponent on
Friday, is full of confidence after moving
into a national poll (Soccer America has

them at No. 18) for the first time since 1991
and only the second time in history. The
Gaels are 4-1-1 and coming off back-to
back shutouts of San Jose State and No. 17
Cal State Bakersfield.
The matchup also pits standout junior
goalkeeper Doug Herrick of St. Mary's
against Stanford's leading goal scorer,
Yahyavi. Herrick has three shutouts in just
six games and was recently named WCC
Player of the Week. Yahyavi has been hot
of late: his three goals this past weekend,
including the aforementioned game win
ner against USF, led to him being named
Pac-10 Player of the Week for the first time.
It was the 12th time a Stanford player has
ever been awarded the honor.
The Cardinal will go on to face Denver
on Sunday at 1 p.m. and will have to work
hard to slow down junior Jarod Stigall. The
midfielder has three goals this season and
found the back of the net twice to help
Denver draw with then-No. 16 Portland
two weeks ago. He was named MPSF Play-

er of the Week for his efforts.
Denver (4-2) is coming off a bad home
loss to No. 21 Penn State, but was unbeaten
in four previous games, a stretch in which it
tied Portland and pulled out a 3-1 win over
then No. 20 Georgetown. The Pioneers will
face No. 14 California later on Friday.

SAINT MARY'S
(4-1-1,0-0 WCC)
Laird Q. Cagan Stadium 7:00 RM.
UP NEXT DENVER
9/26 Laird Q. Cagan Stadium
NOTES: After opening the season with four disap
pointing losses, the Cardinal will look to build on
the momentum of two recent wins when it takes on
Saint Mary's and Denver at home this weekend.

The team's defense has been its
usual staunch self, allowing only eight
goals in the first six games. Redshirt
freshman goalkeeper Jason Dodson
has stepped into the role filled by
graduated John Moore, who finished
with a staggering nine shutouts last
year and 18 in his four years as a
starter.

"I'm stepping in, and I have some
big shoes to fill," Dodson said. "My
job is just to be as solid as possible. I
want to be doing all the little things
right. I can't give up any soft goals,

and if I don't do that, I think the guys
can really rely on me."
This weekend will provide a
chance to see if the Cardinal has re
covered from its early-season slide
and is ready to take on what is certain
to be a rigorous Pac-10 schedule.

"We found ourselves in an unfor
tunate position after the first games,"
said sophomore midfielder Dersu
Abolfathi. "But we aren't feeling
sorry for ourselves, and we're just
taking it one game at a time. If any
thing, we are stronger as a result, and
we know that we can't take anything
for granted."
