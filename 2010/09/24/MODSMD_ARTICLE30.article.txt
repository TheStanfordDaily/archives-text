## Remote Nomad: The return of the comedy Jedi 
### â€” liz STARK contact liz: estark12@stanford. edu 
Put away your Bowflex the fall come
dies have returned and are ready to give
your abdominals a workout. The two
standouts from last year "Modern Family"
and "Glee," with the former capturing the
Emmy for Best New Comedy but splitting act
ing and directing accolades with the latter
returned this week to resounding audience
numbers.
Though I'm skeptical of the argument that
the Emmys matter enough to translate into
viewers, the ratings for this week suggest other
wise: Wednesday's "Modern Family's" 12.6 mil
lion just edged out the 12.3 million for "Glee"
on Tuesday. These numbers certainly affirm
both shows' popularity, but the weak beginnings
to their sophomore seasons may have failed to
live up to the expectations of new audiences.
"Glee" set out to revisit the audition format
of the show's seminal pilot, for which Ryan
Murphy won a directing Emmy this August. In
a surprise turn of events, however, the premiere
was directed by Brad Falchuk, and its writing
was credited to lan Brennan, the other two
thirds of the "Glee" triumvirate. That's not to
say I expected the pilot to be any worse when
those credits rolled the inconsistency of
Glee's first 22 episodes disabused me of any log
ical or formulaic approach to predicting which
episodes I will like. With "Glee," you simply
can't afford to be a fair-weather fan the way you
can in sports, simply because you'll miss
moments like Charice Pempengco killing
"Listen" from "Dreamgirls" in this week's
episode, and you'll be out of the loop when
people quote Brittany's deadpan quips such as
"Stop the violence."
The episode itself was disappointment.

Thematically, nothing has changed since last
year Gleeks are uncool as ever; money is
tight at McKinley and the teens are schizo
phrenic in their romance. The episode made no
attempt to ease new viewers into the show and
its shoddily crafted web of relationships, as we
spent the majority of the episode from the per
spective of the new female football coach,
Bieste. Except for Brittany and the revelation of
Mike Chang's abs, the episode was more cruel
than funny. From Rachel's under-described plot
against Charice (where was the classic "Glee" cut
to a shot of the crack house?) to the mediocrity
of the new guy, I was wholly underwhelmed

and disoriented.
I attended an event in LA this summer at
which the Glee writers spoke, and, in hindsight,
their disarmingly charming demeanor masked a

certain complacency about the show's structure,
themes and characters. The show's success is
undeniable, but someone needs to lay down the
law with these guys, though not before next
week's Britney/Brittany episode.

I also attended a talk with the writers of
"Modern Family," who effused the same unex
pected humor and sentimental allegiance to
family as their little sitcom that could. Many
have called the show's pilot the best of the last
five years, but the premiere on Wednesday fal
tered with its "in medias res" introduction.

Although the first season provided us with
great bookends in the pilot and finale, this
newest episode seemed insignificant. Not only
were the families kept apart, but the characters
also felt surprisingly materialistic, with the castle
and the car dominating the screen more than

the actors themselves. The message of the
episode was "we, as families and a show, are
growing up so fast!" That realization, however,
washed over the parents instead of the viewers,
as things like the car or Manny's girlfriend trig
gered it.

The humor on Modern Family is so
nuanced that I do have trouble diagnosing my
problems with a particular episode. The best
adjective I can use to describe last night's
episode is muted. The high stakes of moments
from season one, such as the "Lion King" allu
sion, Luke's birthday party and even the iPad,
made these characters simultaneously unreal in
their seriousness and familiar in their unique
obsessions. I'm confident there are better
episodes coming; I'm just surprised the team
behind "Modern Family" wanted to start on this
note.

Ironically, pilots or premieres are often the
least accurate reflections of a show's future
take "Community" or "Cougar Town." With
comedies, however, particularly the more sit
com-y ones that refuse to conform to season
long arcs, it can be hard to justify scheduling
your life around them.

Fresh off its Emmy win, ABC's Modern Family debuted with an oddly forgettable premiere,
while Glee kicked off its second season with its now trademark inconsistency.
