## Cantor's 'Go Figure!' celebrates the body in various mediums 
### — alex FIALHO contact alex: afialho@stanford. edu 
Much of the perplexity of modern art
centers on the question of abstrac
tion. It is not uncommon to overhear
a museum-goer in a modern art gallery ques
tion the merits of an all-black monochrome
painting or complain in front of a seemingly
messy canvas, "My child could do that."
Lost in these concerns, however, is the way
in which many artists over the last half-century
have explored the body and figuration in their
work. "Go Figure!," Cantor Arts Center's new
exhibition of modern and contemporary art,
brings together more than 20 works by an inter
national group of artists who have placed the
figure at the center of their artistic practice since
the 19505. A handful of the works on display are

variations of the familiar motif of an artistic
modeled form, yet the majority of works
explore the tension between abstraction and fig
uration. Either way, those weary of the abstract
tendency of modern art can breathe a cultural
sigh of relief for "Go Figure!"
Entering the show in Cantor's second-floor
Oshman Family Gallery, visitors first encounter
Richard Stankiewicz' 1955 "Urchin." Initially, the
work, made of steel and found objects, appears
to be little more than a fused junk heap of
industrial material. However, looking at
"Urchin" through the lens of the exhibition's
figurative theme, the viewer sees the work trans
form before his or her eyes. Circular tubing
knobs come into focus as eye sockets while steel
rods come to represent four limbs. Once aware
of the figurative quality of "Urchin," anthropo
morphic readings rush in. Can we see the sculp
ture as having a nose and a belly button and
perhaps even being clothed? Suddenly, the pre
vious heap of industrial materials becomes re
envisioned as a bodily presence a mischie
vous street urchin made from reused materials.
The diverse variety of mediums represent
ed within the exhibition is striking. Interspersed
among works in more traditional media,
including Appel's painting and a bronze sculp-

ture by Terry Allen,
are works in blown
glass by Martin Blank
as well as wood by
Sam Hernandez. In

painted marble, Manuel
Neri's 1981 "Carriona Figure
No. 1" interestingly calls to

mind the mannequin figures by
Benjamin Hersh 'lO on display

in Wallenberg Hall. In these
divergent views and media,

we come to see the
body in a variety of
materials and forms.

Perhaps surprisingly, it is work in ceramics
that has the strongest presence in "Go Figure!"
Viola Frey's glazed whiteware "Aquamarine
Man" and Peter Vandenßerge's coupled
stoneware sculptures provide a colorful ceramic
twist to the exhibition. Cantor's strong collec
tion of works from the loosely associated Bay
Area ceramic Funk movement shine in this dis
play, highlighting the figurative quality that
largely distinguished modern art practices on
the West Coast.

Hers," is the brashest and

arguably most provocative piece
of the exhibition. The work consists
of two constructed toilets, one desig
nated "his" and the other "hers." A

' large phallus sits on the male-desig
nated half of the piece while the toilet

bowl of the female portion takes a vaginal form,
topped with a set of breasts. The backs of the
toilets complete the ensemble with twinned
nude buttocks. Taken together, the pair of toilets
can be read as a bizarre yet humorous take on
sexual difference and its resulting implications
for the bathroom setting.
"Go Figure!" loses a bit of steam as it con
tinues into the H.L. Kwee

Galleria and McMurtry Family
Terrace. One is hard-pressed to see
figuration in works by Willie Cole
and Mel Edwards; instead, the
abstract qualities overwhelm any fig
urative reading. Further, the place
ment of works by Robert Graham
and Gerard Quenum, artists from
different regions and generations, on
the same platform with little explana
tion as to their pairing, leaves a bit to
be desired.

That said, an effective education
al feature of the exhibition that must
be acknowledged is the use of video
monitors in the space of the gallery.
On these monitors, museum-goers
can view clips of three artists' studios
(Blank, Frey and ceramicist Richard
Shaw). Though the videos are a slight
distraction from the works them
selves, they provide a fascinating per
spective on [SWl]the studio-based
practice that is so essential to these

artists' exploration of the figure.
"Go Figure!" runs alongside and
in complement to Cantor's perma
nent-collection display of modern
and contemporary works. Only in
concluding the exhibition and con
tinuing into these galleries can the
perspective afforded by "Go Figure!"
be seen, drawing connections to well
known abstract works by Richard
Diebenkorn, Isamu Noguchi and
Tony Smith. In this sense, "Go

Figure!" is a thought-provoking and
much welcomed counterpoint to
Cantor's modern art collection.

(Blank, Frey and ceramicist Richard
Shaw). Though the videos are a slight
distraction from the works them
selves, they provide a fascinating per
spective on [SWl]the studio-based
practice that is so essential to these

artists' exploration of the figure.
"Go Figure!" runs alongside and
in complement to Cantor's perma
nent-collection display of modern
and contemporary works. Only in
concluding the exhibition and con
tinuing into these galleries can the
perspective afforded by "Go Figure!"
be seen, drawing connections to well
known abstract works by Richard
Diebenkorn, Isamu Noguchi and
Tony Smith. In this sense, "Go

Figure!" is a thought-provoking and
much welcomed counterpoint to
Cantor's modern art collection.
"Go Figure!" is curated by
Hilarie Faberman, Cantor Arts Center
curator of modern and contempo
rary art. It runs through Aug. 5, 2012.
