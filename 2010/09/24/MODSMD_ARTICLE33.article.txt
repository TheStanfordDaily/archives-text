## How to Seduce a Freshman 
### â€“ roxy SASS contact roxy: intermission@stanforddaily. com 
It's the most wonderful time of
the year. Roxy loves September.
It's a chance to see, once again,
how kids (read: freshmen) just keep
getting younger ... and foxier.
Yes, these freshmen are so
young they were never taught cur
sive and have only heard Nirvana
on classic rock stations. Still, they
make juicy prey. And as any good
hunter knows, the cardinal rule
holds true here more than ever:
location, location, location.
Roxy has always been respect
ful of the law ("Hello, officer").
Remember: drunk "consent" is
never consent. Be aware that some
frosh are still under 18.
Now, without further ado ...

Talk about a Sunday brunch.
The sizzle of the egg white at the
omelette station will mirror the siz
zle when your eyes meet with that
cutie from Colorado who's still
wearing his lanyard. Come to
mama. Oh, and grab some bananas
on the way.
Frat Parties
If it's on Facebook, the frosh
will be there in hordes, determined
to "experience college." Roxy enjoys
this opportunity to show off her
knowledge of the frat houses' dark
hallways. Extra points if you live in
the fraternity: "Come on . . . my
futon is lonely."
Activities Fair
Start a new club Roxy
always wanted to be a booth babe.
Her club is the one with meetings

on weekend nights, and it's the only
one that asks for your phone num
ber. She's particularly looking for
ward to initiation activities.
Remember, also: it's not really
incest if you're just hooking up
with your "little sib."
Safeway and In-N-Out
Another key way to snag a
frosh is by offering them something
they can't find in their classmates: a
vehicle. Roxy's ride takes you many
places you've never been before ...
but Safeway is also a useful destina
tion for a little pre-romp grocery
shopping. Baby, you can drive my
car. Beep beep, beep beep ... yeah.

For freshmen, MemAud is still
a place of wonder: Three Books
(read me all night long), The Real
World, endless dorm chants and
now, a dark room and some Sass.
When that new romcom hits the
auditorium screen, it's the perfect
chance to capitalize on the dark
lighting and sentimental music
with a class of students who still
think on-campus movies are a cool
event.

Everyone's wet.
Freshman year is full of firsts.
Upperclassmen, make sure you're
one of them.
