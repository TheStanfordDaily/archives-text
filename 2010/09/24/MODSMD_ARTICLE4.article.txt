# CROSS COUNTRY
## Men, women looking tough 
### ZACH ZIMMERMAN DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford men's and women's cross country teams
will kick off their full-squad seasons on Saturday, staying
on the Farm to entertain a home crowd at the Stanford In
vitational.
The No. 1 men's team, which obliterated the competi
tion in last year's meet by sweeping first through fifth
place, will be favored again this year. This time, however,
it will not be as easy.
No. 4 Northern Arizona, led by senior David McNeill,
will be the toughest test for the Cardinal and will pose a
legitimate threat to steal an early-season victory. McNeill
finished second at the 2009 NCAA Cross Country Cham
pionships and is entering his final campaign as a frontrun
ner for a national title.
Stanford has two stars of its own in junior Chris Der
rick and senior Elliott Heath. Derrick was the overall
winner at the 2009 Stanford Invita
tional and finished just behind Mc-
Neill for third place at nationals.
Joining the two is a slew of talented
runners, including three additional
track All-Americans: redshirt juniors
Jake Riley and J.T. Sullivan and red
shirt sophomore Dylan Ferris.

The No. 13 women are also look
ing to recapture the magic of last
year's competition.The Cardinal was
absolutely dominant in its race last
season, notching 24 points compared
to runner-up Cal's 100.
Nearly all of last season's scorers
return to a team that is looking to im
prove upon a disappointing finish at
the NCAA Championships. Sopho

more Kathy Kroeger, an All-Ameri
can in track, finished in third place
overall in the 2009 meet. Redshirt
junior Steph Marcy, another track
All-American, returns to the Stan
ford Golf Course after a ninth-place
finish.

Sophomore Alex Dunne and sen
ior Alex Gits, who finished sixth and
seventh respectively at last year's
race, round out the top of a very im
pressive women's team that has now
gone two years without a national
title after winning the award in three
consecutive seasons.

The Stanford Invitational kicks off
on Saturday at 9 a.m. at the Stanford
Golf Course. The men's 8,000-meter
collegiate race will begin at 10:50 a.m.,
followed by the women's 6,000-meter
competition at 11:30 a.m.
