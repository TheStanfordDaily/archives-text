## CRIME & SAFETY Campus preps for quake drill 
### CAROLINE CHEN STAFF WRITER 
If an earthquake struck at Stanford to
morrow, would you know what to do?
If not, you'll have a chance to practice
during a campus-wide earthquake evacua
tion drill on Oct. 7.

The Office of Emergency Management
(OEM) is organizing the drill at the request
of Provost John Etchemendy Ph.D. 'B2 and
President John Hennessy to teach students,
staff and faculty what to do in case of a
major earthquake.
While the University has previously
conducted drills to test the school's ability
to triage information and organize a re
sponse, this will be the first drill focused on
residents and campus employees.
"We really want to get people to become
more aware of the appropriate response,"
said Keith Perry, emergency manager.
"They need to know what their personal
role is."

The upcoming exercise will begin with
the outdoor warning system seven sirens
going off simultaneously. Perry said the
start time is not specified because "emer
gencies never arrive on schedule."
The AlertSU system will also send a text
message to all students, staff and faculty.
Everyone will then be expected to duck,
cover and hold on to something until the
sirens stop, then evacuate whichever build
ing they are in and head to the nearest
emergency assembly point (EAP).
Campus currently has 115 assembly
points, which can be found on the emergency
evacuation maps in every residence and
building. The locations are also marked by
gray posts with the symbol of a blue triangle
in a white circle. Once students arrive at the
assembly points, they should check in with
faculty, instructors or residence staff there.
Perry suggested that students locate the
assembly point nearest to their dorms and
classes so they know where to go instantly
in case of an emergency.

Accounting for every person on campus
is the difficult aspect. Besides the Universi
ty's 16,000 students, there are also thou
sands of faculty and staff. In hopes of count
ing how many participate, the OEM is try
ing a new program that will send an auto
mated phone call through the AlertSU sys
tem to everyone after the evacuation.
"They'll be asked to press one, two or
three [in response to] the question," Perry
said. "They really need to listen to that
phone call. If they don't respond, we won't
be able to log the fact that they've checked
in."

Of course, there is no way to account for
every single person, especially within the
half-hour time slot scheduled for the drill.
However, Perry believes the exercise will
give the OEM a baseline percentage to
work with so officials can improve the sys
tem.

While students may feel silly ducking,
covering and holding with a class of stu
dents during the drill, Perry stressed that

the exercise was for their benefit.
"It's not a question of if we're going to
have an earthquake," he said. "It's a ques
tion of when we're going to have an earth
quake. We know we will experience large
earthquakes in the Bay Area in the future."
Bay Area native Chad Meirose 'll said
that the drill was "nothing out of the ordi
nary" for him, as he has done many similar
drills before.
"If many students aren't aware of how to
do it, [this drill] might be necessary," he said.
"But I think a handout with pictures would
suffice."
However, some students appreciate the
chance to rehearse an earthquake scenario.
"In the event of an actual serious earth
quake on campus," said Grove residential
assistant Bob Clark 'll, "I think we'll all be
glad that everyone has had a chance to do
a test run."
