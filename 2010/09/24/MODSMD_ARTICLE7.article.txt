## Foursquare "checks in" at Stanford Social networking app joins forces with 20 universities 
### LISA WALLACE 
Foursquare recently announced a special
"universities edition," and Stanford is among
the company's first 20 college partners trying to
facilitate social connections and event publicity
on campus.
The mobile-phone social networking appli
cation allows users to update their physical lo
cations by "checking in" at events and address
es. By syncing with other social networking
tools such as Facebook and Twitter, Foursquare
lets its users track their friends' favorite campus
landmarks.
The idea behind Stanford's Foursquare page
is that campus-specific information should help
students and faculty feel more connected so
cially by giving them better access to informa
tion about events and places. Once a user has
"checked in" to a location, he or she can write
reviews and leave insider tips for other users to
see, creating a collaborative, user-modified re
view book.
But will students use it?
Some say other social-networking sites hold
more unique and important socializing fea

"I would try out the application to look at
different events on campus and to find out
about food places more as an information
resource than for social networking," explained
Rebecca Amato 'l4, who recently downloaded
Foursquare on her iPhone. "I would look to
other social networking sites like Facebook to
feel connected."
Socializing is not the only purpose of the
service, however. While Foursquare primarily
focuses on information exchange, users can also
participate in a rewards system based on their
check-in histories. Each "check-in" earns a
badge and a number of points depending on the
location.
For example, a user who checks in to a partic
ular location most often may become the
Foursquare "mayor" of that place. Another user
who collects the most locations in a week can ob
tain the "adventurer badge." While the points
