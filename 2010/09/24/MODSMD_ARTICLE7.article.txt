## Foursquare "checks in" at Stanford Social networking app joins forces with 20 universities 
### LISA WALLACE 
Foursquare recently announced a special
"universities edition," and Stanford is among
the company's first 20 college partners trying to
facilitate social connections and event publicity
on campus.
The mobile-phone social networking appli
cation allows users to update their physical lo
cations by "checking in" at events and address
es. By syncing with other social networking
tools such as Facebook and Twitter, Foursquare
lets its users track their friends' favorite campus
landmarks.
The idea behind Stanford's Foursquare page
is that campus-specific information should help
students and faculty feel more connected so
cially by giving them better access to informa
tion about events and places. Once a user has
"checked in" to a location, he or she can write
reviews and leave insider tips for other users to
see, creating a collaborative, user-modified re
view book.
But will students use it?
Some say other social-networking sites hold
more unique and important socializing fea
tures.
"I would try out the application to look at
different events on campus and to find out
about food places more as an information
resource than for social networking," explained
Rebecca Amato 'l4, who recently downloaded
Foursquare on her iPhone. "I would look to
other social networking sites like Facebook to
feel connected."
Socializing is not the only purpose of the
service, however. While Foursquare primarily
focuses on information exchange, users can also
participate in a rewards system based on their
check-in histories. Each "check-in" earns a
badge and a number of points depending on the
location.
For example, a user who checks in to a partic
ular location most often may become the
Foursquare "mayor" of that place. Another user
who collects the most locations in a week can ob
tain the "adventurer badge." While the points
and badges are largely virtual re
wards, they provide real-world ben
efits as well. Businesses can use
Foursquare to track customer traf
fic, potentially giving their loyal pa
trons special discounts and rewards.
"I think if you're able to scan or
use your discount directly from
your phone without printing it out,
that would be beneficial, like Pay-
Pal is doing," said Jeremy Fine 'l3.
"However, if the service requires
you to print out the discount in
order to reap the benefit, it is un
likely to be used by many people."
One Stanford business, Fraiche

Yogurt, has already taken advan
tage of Foursquare's customer
tracking as a consumer incentive.
Foursquare "mayors" of Fraiche
get their first yogurt topping free
with proof of their status.
The application just began to
gather a following. Because the ap
plication's benefits depend heavily
upon the core number of users will
ing to "check in" and write reviews,
building its consumer base on cam
pus will be crucial to Foursquare's
success.

Currently, 50 businesses and 35
other location tags have been
added to the Stanford page, along
with 45 insider tips and users con
tinuing to post each day.
