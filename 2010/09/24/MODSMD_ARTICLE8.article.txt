## SLE profs take Shakespeare to big screen Professors create instructional DVDs for Shakespeare plays 
### WILLA BROCK 
Greg Watkins and Jeremy Sabol, Structured
Liberal Education (SLE) professors, one-upped
Spark Notes with the Aug. 14 release of their latest
collaboration, "This is Hamlet."
The instructional DVD follows "This is Mac
beth," released in October 2008, in their series of
humorous feature-length films introducing Shake
speare's plays.
"The goal is really to bring people towards the
text," Sabol said. "Since we teach in SLE, we're in
the business of helping students try to appreciate
the classics and feel some ownership over great
works of literature and philosophy."
Directed by Watkins, a filmmaker before his
teaching stint at Stanford, both DVDs switch be

tween stagings of key scenes, which are performed
by professional Shakespearean actors in a black
box theater, and a talk-show format where the char
acters discuss their motivations with host Ralph
Holinshed, played by Sabol.
"When we're in the theater, it's pure Shake
speare," Sabol said. "We want those clips to serve
another pedagogical function that if you just
want to see Macbeth 1.7, you can just see it, and it's
not adulterated in any way But the studio is more a
space for exploration of that language, commenting
about the language and trying to get what Shake
speare is doing."

venues is as much an art as the the
atrical masterpieces.
"It's a fine line, because we want
to make it come alive, but we also
want to interpret as little as possi
ble," Sabol said. "So we push that
buck to the students. They have to be
the ones to choose."

Although the casts consisted
mostly of professional Bay Area ac
tors, "two Stanford students have
roles in "This Is Macbeth," and
Austin Zumbro 'O9 wrote and per
formed all the music for both films.

Sabol, who had little acting expe
rience, was nervous about perform
ing, even though "it was not a very
big acting job," he said with a smile.
"I was kind of acting like an exag
gerated version of myself," he added.
Originally, Watkins and Sabol
planned a more straightforward
study aid for students.
"But I think the projects are a lot

more alive than that," Watkins said.
"There's a lot of humor. The writing
is inspired by a lot of different things,
so it didn't quite become this crys
talline thing students would pick up."
Watkins and Sabol began to tar
get teachers at advanced high
schools after the DVDs received
rave reviews from instructors at
Gunn High School in Palo Alto.
But any interested viewer is
bound to find some value, Sabol said,
especially because both SLE profes
sors worked hard to ensure the
DVDs were companions for the
plays, not substitutes.
"One of the problems with a lot
of introductory materials is that
they're a replacement for the thing,"
Sabol said. "If you read the Cliff
notes for 'Wuthering Heights,' you
kind of don't need to read the book.
And worse, Cliff notes are boring!
So they don't really make you want
to read the original... which we feel
is really much better than anything
we could make."
