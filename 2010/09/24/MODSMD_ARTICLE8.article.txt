## SLE profs take Shakespeare to big screen Professors create instructional DVDs for Shakespeare plays 
### WILLA BROCK 
Greg Watkins and Jeremy Sabol, Structured
Liberal Education (SLE) professors, one-upped
Spark Notes with the Aug. 14 release of their latest
collaboration, "This is Hamlet."
The instructional DVD follows "This is Mac
beth," released in October 2008, in their series of
humorous feature-length films introducing Shake
speare's plays.
"The goal is really to bring people towards the
text," Sabol said. "Since we teach in SLE, we're in
the business of helping students try to appreciate
the classics and feel some ownership over great
works of literature and philosophy."
Directed by Watkins, a filmmaker before his
teaching stint at Stanford, both DVDs switch be

tween stagings of key scenes, which are performed
by professional Shakespearean actors in a black
box theater, and a talk-show format where the char
acters discuss their motivations with host Ralph
Holinshed, played by Sabol.
"When we're in the theater, it's pure Shake
speare," Sabol said. "We want those clips to serve
another pedagogical function that if you just
want to see Macbeth 1.7, you can just see it, and it's
not adulterated in any way But the studio is more a
space for exploration of that language, commenting
about the language and trying to get what Shake
speare is doing."
