## Renovated Row house kitchens open 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Cassandra Feliciano 
Three Row house kitchens are set to open for
business at 10 a.m. on Friday after renovations and
county inspections delayed their openings last week.
Approximately 150 students and their chefs in
Bob, Casa Italiana and Storey could not use stoves,
toasters, washers or ovens and kitchen managers
could not stock the open kitchens when students
began arriving last Thursday, said Cristiana Giannini
'll, kitchen manager at Casa Italiana.
Instead, chefs cooked meals in neighboring resi-

dences and transported them by golf cart, and stu
dents took up additional hashing duties to cover
gaps in cleaning equipment.
"Everyone was pretty patient and they all pitched
in," Giannini said. "Everyone's been really under
standing because it's construction so they know
there's going to be delays. That's just how it is."
Affected students on Thursday got $lO in Cardi
nal Dollars, which are set to expire today.
"In an attempt to lessen the impact of the delay,
we wanted to provide students with some options
around breakfast in particular, as often students
make use of the open kitchen for that purpose," said
Nate Boswell, associate dean of Residential Educa
tion.
