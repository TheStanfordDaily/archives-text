## THE 						TRANSITIVE PROPERTY What's in a Name? 
### Cristopher Bautista 
On Friday afternoon, I stood in line at
the county Superior Court, my name
change papers shaking in my hand. It
was a rather drab place, with gray walls and a
grumpy policeman at the front door who
looked at me suspiciously and made me take
off my shoes and walk through a metal detec
tor. I was more nervous than anything. I was
surrounded by people seeking custody for
their children, filing restraining orders and
complaining about traffic tickets, all express
ing how unfair life was to them.
I didn't feel like a victim I did before,
during my angsty coming out period, when I
was jealous of everyone who wasn't trans
gender (and believe me, being jealous of
more than 95 percent of the population took
up a lot of energy). But now, no hard feelings.
One of the main reasons why I wanted to
change my name is for grad school applica
tions. The name on my transcript is my legal
name, which is at the moment my female
name.
The clerk at the front desk was this angry
black woman who seemed perpetually pissed
off. I was a bit scared, since she was being
rather terse at the people before me. My turn
came. I walked up to the window. She looked
at me over her glasses.
"We've only got 10 minutes. What are you
here for?" she asked.
I couldn't quite talk. "I want to legally
change my name," I croaked. I handed her
my paperwork under the window partition
between us.
She stared at me for a moment. I thought
that she was going to laugh at me or ask me
why the hell I wanted to change my name.
But she didn't. Maybe it was because I wasn't
complaining about the evils of some other
human being, or maybe it was because I was
this cute little scared Filipino boy. Either way,
she must have sensed my discomfort, and she
was nice. She asked me what school I went to,
my major, told me that I had a nice name and
that I looked young for my age. I didn't think
that clerks at the Superior Court would have
souls, after all the crap that they have to go
through, with divorce and restraining orders
and such. But my interactions with this clerk
were surprisingly comforting, and I appreci
ate her for it.
My legal name is Cristina Marie Soriano
Bautista, about to change it to Cristopher
Marc Soriano Bautista. One of the cool ad
vantages of being trans is that you get to
choose your own name. My name is a combi
nation of a name that I chose and a name that
my parents chose for me. At first I was going
to be "Cristian," but at the time, I knew sev-

eral other Christians, and I didn't want to
cause any confusion. But I didn't know any
Cristophers, and I liked how any combina
tion of the three syllables could form a nick
name for me ("Cristoph," "Topher," and
"Toph" came to be my favorites). So I decid
ed on Cristopher. As for "Marc," there's a
much more meaningful story if I had been
born physically male, my parents would have
named me "Marc" because the "m" and the
"c" were their initials, and they wanted to
have them included in their first child's name.
Therefore, I was Marc. I consider "Cristopher
Marc" to be my name more so than my birth
name ever was.
In the state of California, it costs $355 to
file a name change request. Not only that, but
in addition to filing a request, for four consec
utive weeks I have to post an ad in a local
newspaper that expresses my intention to
change my legal name, which costs about
$2OO. It's a process that takes about $550 dol
lars total (or more, depending on the newspa
per). I understand that legal name change
costs are so steep so that people don't want to
change their names to "God" or anything, but
part of me thinks it's a bit unfair for transgen
der folk. I feel that if trans people could in
clude a letter from a gender specialist or ther
apist with their name change application, the
fee could be waived or at least reduced
but that's not how it is. It bothers me a bit that
I'll have to spend hundreds of dollars to ac
quire what many people take for granted.
But whether that name or pronoun matches
up with their birth certificate, all people de
serve to be recognized by their preferred
name and pronoun, even it takes several hun
dred dollars.
With a couple stamps and rifling through
paperwork, my request was officially filed.
Dec. 2,2010 at 2:30 p.m. is my court date. On
that day, 66 days from the publication of this
column, I will finally legally be Cristopher
Marc Soriano Bautista. That day can't come
soon enough.
