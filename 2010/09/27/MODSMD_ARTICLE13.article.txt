# STETHOSCOPES, COMPILERS AND HEMINGWAY
## My Pre-Med Journey 
### Aaditya Shidham 
I come from a family of doctors. I grew up
in clinics around Saudi Arabia, New York
City, Columbus and India. My uncle is the
editor in chief of one of the most popular cy
topathology journals in the nation, and my
dad had experience with a (failed!) medical
startup in India. As a result, I have always felt
a kind of special connection with medicine
and the medical world.
Yet growing up in clinics doesn't mean
that I feel well suited for medicine. I always
saw myself as a person that prided practical
action, efficiency and innovation above more
ambiguous things like intellectual patience
and empathy. My heroes to this day are not
medical innovators or great empathizers, but
intellectual powerhouses that were also un
relenting men or women of action: Teddy
Roosevelt, Larry Page, Sergey Brin, Leonar
do da Vinci. I don't think I am alone at this
school or this generation in sharing this bias.
Yet I hear over and over again that medi
cine is for the most part not about the clinical
or basic sciences or about innovation or pre
cision or practical action. Certainly, some
competence is required. Some intellect is
needed. But above it all lays the cloud of pa
tience and empathy.
From a historical perspective, this makes
some sense. Think about where medicine start
ed: it was initially embodied as a tribal medi
cine man an otherworldly entity that stayed
at the intersection of the world and the spirit.
For a long time, medicine was in the hands of
theology and practiced by a doctor that was
also in some senses a priest. Only in the last
couple centuries have the church and the hos
pital split, and only in the last decades has med
icine started to display quantitative colors.

Even in this modern era, I realize that pa
tients don't want engineers or "men of ac
tion" as their family physicians. They want
patient, humble doctors that can adopt their
worldview, know them deeply and comfort
them in 10,000 different situations. A great
doctor's career is to be filled with nights of
waiting by a bedside, adjusting the ventilator
of a dying man so that he may go in peace, ft
is filled with inane paperwork and comfort

ing anxious parents that call with an hourly
update on their newborn. His life is spent
dealing with these situations in an effort to
understand the people he serves. This is a life
of great nobility and public service.
Yet I cannot imagine myself living as this
legend of the "great family doctor," as much
as I respect the ideal. Unfortunately, I am too
ironic, impatient and energetic to live with
such nobility. For a long time, I thought that
this meant a permanent break from the pro
fession of my ancestors. Yet I have returned
again and again to medicine. Through all my
doubting, I knew that there was still some
thing deeply amazing about having intimate
knowledge of the collection of cells that I live
in. There is something to the power of healing
that appeals to this engineer.
Besides these facts, I see something more:
a technical revolution in the treatment of the
ailing. I can imagine futures where patients
visit doctors because their cell group CXS34S
has been acting up, and they want a new
strain; where deadly cancers are avoided by
daily digital checkups in protein levels and
cell replication rates; perhaps even a place
where death is a thing of the past.
This place, I know, is a long way away. It
has a myriad of philosophical complications
and ethical concerns. But this will be my turf
in the wide swath of human action and intel
lect. I want to help this vision appear with my
work on this earth my work to perfect the
eternal craft of medicine.
Hopefully, this school can get me started.

choice, send him a note at ashidham@stan
