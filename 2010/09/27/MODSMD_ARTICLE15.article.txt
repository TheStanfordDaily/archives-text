## OVERWHELMED Cardinal attack puts pressure on Pilots 
### NATE ADAMS DESK EDITOR 
Christen Press is no stranger to finding the
net with 13 goals this season, the senior for
ward is the nation's top scorer. But for as often
as she scores, Saturday night's game-winner
against Portland may have been her biggest
goal of 2010. With a single chip shot late in the
first half, Press provided the difference the No.
2 Cardinal needed to take down a talented
Portland squad (10-1-0), ranked at No. 3 be
fore last weekend. She also vaulted herself
into the history books, becoming Stanford's
all-time leader in points.
Saturday's match was ultimately a tale of
two halves, with the Cardinal (8-0-2) control
ling the tempo in the opening frame but being
thrown off guard by Portland's approach after
halftime. Stanford was able to keep its compo
sure, however, and held on for the win after
taking the lead with two first-half goals.
"[Tonight] showed me that we have an
amazing team," said Stanford head coach Paul
Ratcliffe. "I was a little disappointed in the sec
ond half, but overall, Portland is an amazing
team so it's an incredible result."
Playing in front of a full crowd, the Cardinal
was quick to establish offensive control in the
opening minutes. The team's ability to main
tain possession allowed it to fire off 11 shots in
the first half, while holding Portland to just
one, which didn't come until the 38th minute.
The Pilots struggled initially to hold off the
Stanford attack and were called for three fouls
in the first 18 minutes. They defended where it
counted, however, and were able to disrupt the
Cardinal's passing near the box. Most of Stan
ford's early shots did not provide major chal
lenges to Portland goalkeeper Erin Dees.
The Cardinal kept the pressure on, and in
the 20th minute, Mariah Nogueira was able to
break through. Intercepting a Portland pass
about 25 yards out, the sophomore midfielder
quickly turned and made a hard kick from the
center of the Pilots' zone. The shot arced just
over the fingertips of a leaping Dees and
slipped in under the crossbar. The unassisted
goal was Nogueira's second of the season.
Fifteen minutes later, Press provided Stan
ford with a two-goal cushion. Taking a pass
from junior midfielder Teresa Noyola, Press
controlled the ball in the right side of the box
before deking two defenders and sending a

left-footed chip shot into the far corner.
The goal provided Press with her 153 rd ca
reer point (players earn two for a goal and one
for an assist), sending her past Stanford's pre
vious record-holder, Sarah Rafanelli, who
posted 152 points from 1990-93. Press is also
just one goal away from Rafanelli's record of
59 and needs only three more assists to tie
Marcie Ward for the school record in assists
(40).
"Christen Press is an incredible player,"
Ratcliffe said. "She deserves all the success
she's getting, she's a hard worker and a really
talented player, and she's been doing it for
four years now. She's been incredible."
Press, who wasn't aware of her achieve
ment until it was announced on the PA system,
was happy to be recognized but not focused on
her individual success.
"It's a big honor," she said. "But we're just
playing the game to win, any way, shape or
form."
Portland came back strong in the second
half, showing a better rhythm on offense and
an ability to control the ball deeper in Stanford
territory. Keelin Winters provided one of the
Pilots' best opportunities when she sent an un
contested shot over the crossbar in the 58th
minute. On the next play, Portland earned its
first corner kick of the match, but wasn't able
to convert.
"1 was disappointed in the second half, and
1 told the team that," Ratcliffe said, "ft was
strange, we thought they were going to pres
sure us because they were two goals behind,
and they just sat in, so we were impatient and
kept going, and they were counterattacking.
We should've just kept the ball."
"1 think they just stepped up their pres
sure," Press said. "In the first half, we had all

the time in the world on the ball, and they put
a little more pressure. I think we just didn't
capitalize on our chance to make it an easy
game, so that's how the momentum shifted a
little bit."
Danielle Foxhoven was eventually able to
find the net for the Pilots, sending a header to
ward diving freshman Cardinal keeper Emily
Oliver and then knocking her own rebound
back into the lower left side.
"It was just a mistake," Ratcliffe said of the
goal. "We panicked in the back, missed clear
ance, the ball flew up in the air and their play
er beat us to the 50-50 ball, and it got scuffed
in."
Portland had a few more chances before
the final whistle, but Stanford's defense was ul
timately able to hold on. The victory, the Car
dinal's seventh in a row, came on the same

weekend No. 1 North Carolina (9-1-1) lost its
first match of the season, falling 3-2 to No. 4
Boston College.That means Stanford could be
the nation's top-ranked team when the
NSCAA coaches' poll is released on Tuesday.
The Cardinal lost to the Tar Heels in last year's
national championship game and fought them
to a draw earlier this season.
Ratcliffe says he isn't particularly interest
ed in the results of the poll.
"I just want our team to play the best that
we can play and to be prepared to try to win a
national title," he said.
Stanford will close out its non-conference
season next weekend, playing one game
against Santa Clara at home. The match is
scheduled for 1 p.m. on Sunday.

"1 think they just stepped up their pres
sure," Press said. "In the first half, we had all

the time in the world on the ball, and they put
a little more pressure. I think we just didn't
capitalize on our chance to make it an easy
game, so that's how the momentum shifted a
little bit."
Danielle Foxhoven was eventually able to
find the net for the Pilots, sending a header to
ward diving freshman Cardinal keeper Emily
Oliver and then knocking her own rebound
back into the lower left side.
"It was just a mistake," Ratcliffe said of the
goal. "We panicked in the back, missed clear
ance, the ball flew up in the air and their play
er beat us to the 50-50 ball, and it got scuffed
in."
Portland had a few more chances before
the final whistle, but Stanford's defense was ul
timately able to hold on. The victory, the Car
dinal's seventh in a row, came on the same

weekend No. 1 North Carolina (9-1-1) lost its
first match of the season, falling 3-2 to No. 4
Boston College.That means Stanford could be
the nation's top-ranked team when the
NSCAA coaches' poll is released on Tuesday.
The Cardinal lost to the Tar Heels in last year's
national championship game and fought them
to a draw earlier this season.
Ratcliffe says he isn't particularly interest
ed in the results of the poll.
"I just want our team to play the best that
we can play and to be prepared to try to win a
national title," he said.
Stanford will close out its non-conference
season next weekend, playing one game
against Santa Clara at home. The match is
scheduled for 1 p.m. on Sunday.

10/3 Laird Q. Cagan Stadium 1:00RM.
GAME NOTES: Stanford edged No. 3 Portland in Saturday's
2-1 game that should send the Card into first place in the
national rankings. Christen Press's record-breaking chip
shot, paired with a goal from Mariah Nogueira, led the
Stanford women to victory. Next the team will face the
Santa Clara Broncos in a Bay Area match-up to conclude
pre-conference play.



SIMON WARBY/The Stanford Daily
Senior forward Christen Press notches her record-breaking 153rd point for Stanford as she scores
her 13th goal of the season and provides the team with its second goal of the night. The nation's
top scorer needs only three more assists to tie Marcie Ward for the school's all-time assists record.
Christen Press is no stranger to finding the
net with 13 goals this season, the senior for
ward is the nation's top scorer. But for as often
as she scores, Saturday night's game-winner
against Portland may have been her biggest
goal of 2010. With a single chip shot late in the
first half, Press provided the difference the No.
2 Cardinal needed to take down a talented
Portland squad (10-1-0), ranked at No. 3 be
fore last weekend. She also vaulted herself
into the history books, becoming Stanford's
all-time leader in points.
Saturday's match was ultimately a tale of
two halves, with the Cardinal (8-0-2) control
ling the tempo in the opening frame but being
thrown off guard by Portland's approach after
halftime. Stanford was able to keep its compo
sure, however, and held on for the win after
taking the lead with two first-half goals.
"[Tonight] showed me that we have an
amazing team," said Stanford head coach Paul
Ratcliffe. "I was a little disappointed in the sec
ond half, but overall, Portland is an amazing
team so it's an incredible result."
Playing in front of a full crowd, the Cardinal
was quick to establish offensive control in the
opening minutes. The team's ability to main
tain possession allowed it to fire off 11 shots in
the first half, while holding Portland to just
one, which didn't come until the 38th minute.
The Pilots struggled initially to hold off the
Stanford attack and were called for three fouls
in the first 18 minutes. They defended where it
counted, however, and were able to disrupt the
Cardinal's passing near the box. Most of Stan
ford's early shots did not provide major chal
lenges to Portland goalkeeper Erin Dees.
The Cardinal kept the pressure on, and in
the 20th minute, Mariah Nogueira was able to
break through. Intercepting a Portland pass
about 25 yards out, the sophomore midfielder
quickly turned and made a hard kick from the
center of the Pilots' zone. The shot arced just
over the fingertips of a leaping Dees and
slipped in under the crossbar. The unassisted
goal was Nogueira's second of the season.
Fifteen minutes later, Press provided Stan
ford with a two-goal cushion. Taking a pass
from junior midfielder Teresa Noyola, Press
controlled the ball in the right side of the box
before deking two defenders and sending a

left-footed chip shot into the far corner.
The goal provided Press with her 153 rd ca
reer point (players earn two for a goal and one
for an assist), sending her past Stanford's pre
vious record-holder, Sarah Rafanelli, who
posted 152 points from 1990-93. Press is also
just one goal away from Rafanelli's record of
59 and needs only three more assists to tie
Marcie Ward for the school record in assists
(40).
"Christen Press is an incredible player,"
Ratcliffe said. "She deserves all the success
she's getting, she's a hard worker and a really
talented player, and she's been doing it for
four years now. She's been incredible."
Press, who wasn't aware of her achieve
ment until it was announced on the PA system,
was happy to be recognized but not focused on
her individual success.
"It's a big honor," she said. "But we're just
playing the game to win, any way, shape or
form."
Portland came back strong in the second
half, showing a better rhythm on offense and
an ability to control the ball deeper in Stanford
territory. Keelin Winters provided one of the
Pilots' best opportunities when she sent an un
contested shot over the crossbar in the 58th
minute. On the next play, Portland earned its
first corner kick of the match, but wasn't able
to convert.
"1 was disappointed in the second half, and
1 told the team that," Ratcliffe said, "ft was
strange, we thought they were going to pres
sure us because they were two goals behind,
and they just sat in, so we were impatient and
kept going, and they were counterattacking.
We should've just kept the ball."
"1 think they just stepped up their pres
sure," Press said. "In the first half, we had all

the time in the world on the ball, and they put
a little more pressure. I think we just didn't
capitalize on our chance to make it an easy
game, so that's how the momentum shifted a
little bit."
