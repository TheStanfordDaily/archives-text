# CLASSIC SHUTOUTS

### MILES BENNETT-SMITH 
The Stanford men's soccer team hung on to beat Den
ver 1-0 at Laird Q. Cagan Stadium yesterday for its
fourth consecutive victory and second of the weekend.
The win, along with a 3-0 victory over St. Mary's at home
on Friday night, gave the Cardinal the Stanford Nike
Classic crown during its final weekend of non-confer
ence play.
While the final margin against Denver (3-3-2) wasn't
as impressive as Friday's three-goal blitz, the victory es
tablished that the team could find away to win without
playing its preferred style.
"This was the kind of game that happens on a hot
Sunday afternoon," said Stanford head coach Bret
Simon. "There are two types of games open games
that are faster paced and closed games that are more de
fensive-minded. It's very important that teams be able to
win both kinds of games, and I think today we showed
that we could."
The game opened with a lot of up-and-down action,
but without too many real chances for either side.The Pi
oneers tested redshirt freshman goalkeeper Jason Dod
son with eight shots, but most were well off-target. They
did, however, have several dangerous corner kicks, fin
ishing the afternoon with 12 in total.
Stanford had only seven first-half shots, three forcing
Denver goalie Teale Stone into action, as both teams felt
out the other. A stout defense led by senior Bobby War
shaw snuffed out several scoring attempts by Denver,
but the Cardinal offense could not initially capitalize
against the Pioneers.
But in the second half, the Card finally broke through.
A seemingly harmless attack in the 59th minute led by
sophomore midfielder Dersu Abolfathi on the right
wing transpired into much more when Abolfathi got a
step on his defender and crossed the ball to sophomore
forward Adam Jahn at the top of the 18-yard box. With
his body turned sideways, Jahn met the cross in the air
with his right foot and sent the ball screaming into the
upper-right corner.
"Adam's goal was top class," Simon said. "It was a
great finish."
Stanford continued to press and nearly got another
goal minutes later when senior forward Dominique
Yahyavi broke free of the defense. But just when it
seemed that the game was in hand, Denver fought back.
A big and physical Pioneer squad held the ball for a large
part of the second half as the Cardinal drew into a defen
sive shell.
But the team had enough left in the tank to hold off
Denver, and the final whistle marked the third straight
game in which the defense did not concede a goal.
"It was the type of game you win by being very disci
plined," Simon said. "I thought from the outset that who
ever scored first was going to slow the game down and
make it difficult for anyone to really get going. I don't
think we would have been able to win the game early on
this year."

The Friday night game against St. Mary's (4-2-1) fea
tured much of the same cautious play early on, but saw
fireworks after halftime.
Tied 0-0 into the second half after Stanford was frus
trated early by several near misses, it took an unbeliev
able finish by Warshaw to beat St. Mary's keeper Doug
Herrick. In the 61st minute, senior Ryan Thomas sent a
corner kick in from the right side of the box, which was
first headed by Jahn, then headed back across to the far
post by Yahyavi to an open Warshaw. Before anyone
could react, he sent a bicycle kick spinning into the net
for the lead and one of the best finishes he could remem
ber.
"I have done it in high school and youth soccer, but
that was the first [bicycle kick goal] in college," Warshaw
said.
Yahyavi padded the lead three minutes later with his
fourth goal of the season off a nice pass from junior mid
fielder Adoni Levine. The Cardinal then concluded one
of its best halves of soccer in some time with a breakaway
goal from junior forward Taylor Amman.
St. Mary's had no answer for the team's aggressive,
open attack and fell by the same score as in last year's
NCAA Tournament opener, 3-0.
The Cardinal faces off next against California on Sat
urday in the Pac-10 opener for both teams. The rivalry
match against the Golden Bears will begin at 7 p.m. at
Laird Q. Cagan Stadium.
