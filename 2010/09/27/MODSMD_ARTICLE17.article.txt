# AP, Coaches' Polls need to be changed

### Daniel Bohm 
Let me preface this by saying
that I am sitting in a sports bar
in Chicago watching NFL
games and waiting for my
flight back to California after
going to the Stanford-Notre Dame
game yesterday. So take anything I say
with, uh, a grain of salt.
So as usual, I have many quips. I want
ed to write about the experience of going
to a game at Notre Dame. How, despite
the punishment the Irish were taking, the
fans remained in the stadium until the
bitter end (hint, hint Stanford fans).
Maybe it's the lack of other things to do
in South Bend, Ind.
That was going to be my column...
until I saw the new rankings this morn
ing. Few things raise my blood pressure
like the sheer incompetence of poll vot
ers. I really think that every voter should
have to thoroughly, publicly explain the
rationale they use in deciding which
teams are better than others.

Let me start with Arkansas. Arkansas
was ranked No. 10 last week. This week
they lost 24-20 to No. 1 Alabama.
Arkansas spent most of the game lead
ing, and if it were not for a bounce here or
there, the Razorbacks easily could have
won the game against Alabama, who
hasn't lost a game in recent memory.
So what is Arkansas ranked this
week? No. 15.1 want somebody some
where to explain to me what in that game
made them think that Arkansas is a
worse team this week than it was last
week. I'm not sure any argument would
convince me, but I would love to hear
someone try.
Then there is Texas. After losing by three
touchdowns at home to UCLA (the
same UCLA team that Stanford un
dressed 35-0 in Los Angeles), the Long
horns remained ranked, 16th in the
coaches' poll and 21st in the Associated
Press poll.
If it didn't say Texas across their uni
forms, would the Longhorns still be
ranked this week? If it was, say, Texas
Christian, would they be ranked? Has
Texas done anything to warrant a rank
ing this season other than beat three de
cidedly mediocre teams? Do people re
ally think they are one of the 25 best
teams in the country? Really?
It would be one thing if they were just
numbers, but they aren't. The coaches'
poll is factored in the BCS formula that
decides who plays in the national cham
pionship game and who is eligible for
BCS games. (And am I the only who has
noticed that the coaches' poll consistent
ly undervalues Pac-10 teams?)
Oregon or Stanford could win out, be
decidedly better than their opponents,
and still not get a chance to move up in
the polls. Pollsters are consistently reluc
tant to have teams leapfrog undefeated
teams so boy, is it nice to be Alabama
and Ohio State, ranked No. 1 and No. 2 in
the preseason polls.
Then there is the part in which fans
get irrationally obsessed with where
their team is ranked. It seems like it's a
rite of passage for many fans to check the
new rankings every Sunday morning,
and then argue with friends about how it
is BS that X team is ranked too high or
too low. I'll admit, I too have fallen victim
to this syndrome.
But in reality, rankings are subjective
numbers given out by a bunch of so
called pundits who probably don't spend
enough time thinking about the rankings
and their impact. This is not to say that
there aren't any responsible voters, but I
would argue that there are likely many
more irresponsible ones, and that is un
fortunate.
Normally, when I write a critical column,
I like to give a potential solution to the
problem at the end. In this case, however,
that is difficult. Everyone loves rankings.
People need ways to compare teams and
quantify them. It's human nature. Rank
ings have to stay, I think, but going back
to what I said earlier how about we
get some explanations from the voters?
Transparency is a good thing.
