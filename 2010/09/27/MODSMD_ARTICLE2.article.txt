## Korean pop star battles attacks on Stanford record 
### KATE ABBOTT WYNDAM MAKOWSKY 
Daniel Seon Woong Lee,
better known in Korea as
recording artist Tablo, graduat
ed from Stanford with a seem
ingly uncontroversial record:
two English degrees, a bache
lor's in 2001 and a master's in
2002. But over the past six
months, an Internet campaign
has launched attacking Lee's
credentials and, he says, threat -

ening him and his family.
Lee, the frontman of premier
Korean rap group Epik High,
became aware of the allegations
that he was not a Stanford grad
uate in March, when he began
receiving threats to his Twitter
account. The sources of the at
tacks were netizens vocal
participants in an online com
munity who question the va
lidity of Lee's Stanford degrees.
An intervention from Stanford
Registrar Tom Black and a letter

from English professor Tobias
Wolff did little to help stop the
movement.
"Initially, we treated this as a
routine check," Black said. "But
Lee is a moving target. Lee had
an A average, and that 's the kind
of thing they would stretch. Ex
aggerations get made when
something like this goes viral."
The campaign to discredit
Lee's degrees exploded. One of
the largest antagonists, the neti
zen group "We Urge Tablo to Tell

the Truth," formed in May and
now has more than 131,000
members, according to Korean
journalist So-young Sung.The al
legations range widely that
Lee has exaggerated his grade
point average and that he claims
he was best friends with Reese
Witherspoon when she attended
Stanford, for example.
