## Korean pop star battles attacks on Stanford record 
### KATE ABBOTT WYNDAM MAKOWSKY 
Daniel Seon Woong Lee,
better known in Korea as
recording artist Tablo, graduat
ed from Stanford with a seem
ingly uncontroversial record:
two English degrees, a bache
lor's in 2001 and a master's in
2002. But over the past six
months, an Internet campaign
has launched attacking Lee's
credentials and, he says, threat -

ening him and his family.
Lee, the frontman of premier
Korean rap group Epik High,
became aware of the allegations
that he was not a Stanford grad
uate in March, when he began
receiving threats to his Twitter
account. The sources of the at
tacks were netizens vocal
participants in an online com
munity who question the va
lidity of Lee's Stanford degrees.
An intervention from Stanford
Registrar Tom Black and a letter

from English professor Tobias
Wolff did little to help stop the
movement.
"Initially, we treated this as a
routine check," Black said. "But
Lee is a moving target. Lee had
an A average, and that 's the kind
of thing they would stretch. Ex
aggerations get made when
something like this goes viral."
The campaign to discredit
Lee's degrees exploded. One of
the largest antagonists, the neti
zen group "We Urge Tablo to Tell

the Truth," formed in May and
now has more than 131,000
members, according to Korean
journalist So-young Sung.The al
legations range widely that
Lee has exaggerated his grade
point average and that he claims
he was best friends with Reese
Witherspoon when she attended
Stanford, for example.
"The Internet rumor was that
my entire Stanford experience

and all of my credentials are fraudu
lent," Lee wrote in an e-mail to The
Daily. "Over time, this allegation
spawned many others that my en
tire family is a fraud, that I've stolen
and lived someone else's identity, et
cetera and has escalated to the
point where my entire existence is
being questioned. Some of the alle
gations are even based on fabrica
tions of what I've said or done ... it's
all very confusing."
Black said verifying a person's
degree from the University is not an
unusual practice, but he has never
seen a case this severe. Black released
a copy of Lee's transcript, and when
that did not prove satisfactory, he
wrote a letter vouching for Lee's at
tendance and graduation. Recently,
Black allowed camera crews to film
him printing a degree to show that
none of the process is fraudulent.
"I've tried to put all the resources
that are permissible into this," Black
said, "because only I can officially at
test to his completion."
Black believes people are disput
ing the evidence because "they
couldn't absorb it."
"I think they assume someone
would put his education to better
use," he added.
"My full transcript and Stanford's
official verifications have been on
the net since June," Lee said. "I've
tried to get the truth across, but it's
been strangely difficult to do so, and
anybody who has tried to help me
has been attacked in similar ways."
Since Lee's transcript was posted
online, it has been viewed more than
16,000 times, according to Black.
During his time at Stanford, Lee

staffed in Okada as an ethnic theme
associate from 2000 to 2001 and
worked at the CoHo, where he also
performed music.
Nadinne Cruz, the Okada resi
dent fellow during Lee's time on
campus, remembers him as "very po
lite and cooperative" and "a serious
student of literature."
She described him as a quiet soul
with an interest in playwriting. His
career choice was surprising to her,
given his subdued personality and
professed love for classical texts.
"We had conversations about the
state of the world and the human
condition," Cruz said. "We talked
about identity. He was a Korean
from Canada studying in America.
He lived in many different worlds."
Lee pursued these questions
through writing and published a
book in 2008 "Pieces of You"
composed entirely of stories written
during his time in college. Generally,
Lee has not shied away from his
Stanford experiences, speaking of
them often in public appearances.
Sung, who writes for the Joon
gAng Daily and has followed the
diploma story, said Korean enter
tainment agencies often market
celebrities' academic backgrounds.
Lee's tendency to discuss earning
both of his degrees in four years
through the English co-term pro
gram doesn't seem plausible to many
Koreans, Sung said.
Lee is not the first celebrity to be
targeted by viral campaigns. Two Ko
rean entertainers "killed themselves
because of malicious comments
posted by some netizens," Sung
wrote in an e-mail to The Daily, re
ferring to Choi Jin-sil in 2008 and
Uni in 2007.
"This Tablo case is very closely as
sociated with Korea's deep-rooted
culture of judging someone by their
educational background," Sung
added. "I think Tablo mentioned
Stanford quite frequently whenever
he appeared in TV shows ... and
that made some netizens jealous of
him."

The accusers' obsession is so
strong that Sung received a litany of
aggressive e-mails and phone calls
after conducting an interview with
Lee that some readers viewed as too
"cooperative."
There appears to be little, if any
thing, that will placate Lee's attack
ers. He and the netizens have taken
legal action against one another, but
Lee acknowledged that discovering

the "truth" might not play any part in
his accusers' motives.
"Some have expressed that they
want me, and my family, to disap
pear," Lee said. "To a degree, they
may have already achieved what
they want."
"I actually talked to one of those
netizens and he didn't even know
Tablo received an electronic tran
script from Stanford," Sung said.
"Nothing will satisfy them. I think
they just want to believe what they
want to believe."
Black said that he does not think
the netizens will stop asking ques
tions. He has stopped responding to
e-mails concerning Lee.
"It's all just rumor and innuen
do," Black said. "It's not truth they're
after. It's just to ruin his life."
Lee maintains that he is not angry
and even waited several months be
fore pursuing legal action. He hopes
a documentary airing this weekend
in Korea ("Tablo Goes to Stanford,"
on Korean network MBC) will vin
dicate his reputation.
"I ask that you don't develop the
impression that what is happening to
me is in any way a reflection of my
homeland," he said. "Korea has been
host to some of the most beautiful
moments of my life. The event dis
cussed here only reflects the possible
downside of social media any
where,"
But a cultural divide still seems to
remain.
"We think about global citizens,"
Black said, "but sometimes the rest
of the world isn't ready for them."
