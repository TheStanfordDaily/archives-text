## Stanford, PG&E discuss pipeline 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€” Kabir Sawhney 
Campus officials met with represen
tatives of PG&E on Sept. 22 to continue
discussions about a high-pressure PG&E
gas pipeline running along Junipero
Serra Boulevard, the University said in a
statement last week.
Line 109, which runs through campus,
has four segments on PG&E's top-100
list of high-priority maintenance proj
ects. The utility company informed the
University about the pipeline on Sept. 20
in documents released publicly in the
wake of the Sept. 9 San Bruno explosion.
"We had a very positive exchange and
open communication," Larry Gibbs, as
sociate vice provost for environmental
health and safety, told the Stanford News
Service. "They were very helpful to us in
some areas, particularly in explaining
how they are now monitoring pipelines
and to help us as we prioritize upcoming
campus projects that involve work near
gas lines. But they also were not able to
provide us some of the information we
sought about the status of the Junipero
Serra pipeline."
PG&E officials said they could not
discuss pipeline maintenance or condi
tions while the Sept. 9 explosion is under
investigation.
Stanford has chosen to suspend a
water and sewer project set for Sept. 20
that would have required digging near
Line 109, Gibbs said. PG&E plans to
build a gas pressure-reducing station to
handle wider gas distribution following
more dining and housing construction
projects.
"The water and sewer project was not
a critical project that needed to be done
right away," Gibbs said. "We decided to
wait to make sure anything Stanford
does in the area will not interfere with
the work needed for the gas distribution
hookup."
