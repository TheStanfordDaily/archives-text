## ResEd policy change interrupts Row party planning 
### WILLA BROCK 
May Row staffers on Mayfield
Avenue open their houses to out
side groups looking for a place to
throw a party?
That's the question many Row
staff members are asking after
Residential Education told them a
week and a half ago not to let out

side groups use Row houses to
host events. The announcement
came during a "revamp" to Resi
dential Education policy just as the
fall social season gets underway.
"We are currently revamping
the process to insure the safety of
the house, the outside group and
the University," wrote Zac
Sargeant, assistant director of Res

idential Education on the Row, in a
Sept. 17 e-mail to Row managers.
"To clarify," he continued, "please
do not allow any group to host a
function in your residence."
Asked which policy revisions
are planned, Sargeant last week
did not return requests for com
ment. Greek program advisor
Amanda Rodriguez declined to

comment. Nate Boswell, associate
director of Residential Education
on the Row, did not return a re
quest for comment on Friday.
The hosting restriction posed
problems for groups hoping to host
events in the first few weeks of the
quarter. Sigma Phi Epsilon, known
as Sig Ep, had planned to hold its
annual Oktoberfest party in La

Casa Italiana on Sept. 24. But Casa
community manager Gabriel Be
narros 'll said he received an e-mail
from Residential Education a few
days before the event saying the
contract had not yet been finalized.
"It was bad because [Residen
tial Education] promised that
they'd be ready in the first week of
school," he said. "It just put Sig Ep
in a hard situation, because I think
it's kind of a tradition to host [Ok
toberfest] here. And I had to tell
them three or four days before the
party, 'Sorry, guys. Let me know if
there's anything else we can do.'"
The fraternity ultimately held
the Oktoberfest party in Xanadu
on Friday.
Andy Hiller 'll, resident assis
tant in Storey, speculated that the
policy revamping could deal with
how liabilities and damages are
handled. He said the University
wants the houses it owns to be re
spected, and by renting them to

outside groups, there is less ac
countability for damages.
"The groups are generally very
good about it cleaning up after
wards, giving enough warning to
the house in advance," Hiller said,
"but there's a difference between
renting out somebody's space and
actually living there, and it shows."
At the same time, he continued,
there is a limited amount of space
on the campus to host parties. Rent
ing space directly from the Univer
sity is often more expensive than
using a house for the night.
"I'm not exactly sure what the
specifics of the revisions were," said
Sig Ep social chair Zach Ming 'l2.
"I just know that they're giving a
little more power to the houses."
For instance, according to Ming,
deposits made by outside organiza
tions to houses are larger, up to
$l,OOO. Houses now also have more

say in whether to accept events or
not, he said.
"I think it's both better, and it
makes it a little more difficult, be
cause it rewards the outside organi
zations who do things right," Ming
said.
John Watson 'll, president of
un-housed fraternity Alpha Ep
silon Pi, said the current lack of a
contract just meant having to work
a little more with the Office of Stu
dent Activities and Leadership.
"We're trying to throw a party in
Xanadu soon, so we are going to
have a sit-down meeting with the
CM, myself and Amanda [Ro
driguez]," Watson said. "We don't
know the language of the new con
tract yet, so we don't know how it's
going to affect us."
