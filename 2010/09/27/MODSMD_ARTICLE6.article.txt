# TWO-WAY TERROR
## Marecic scores twice as Card rolls in South Bend 
### KABIR SAWHNEY MANAGING EDITOR 
In yet another strong showing,
the No. 9 Stanford football team
hammered Notre Dame on Satur
day, notching a 37-14 win over the
Fighting Irish. The win marks the re
turn of the Cardinal (4-0,1-0 Pac-10)
to the upper echelon of college foot
ball: it was the Card's first win in
Notre Dame Stadium since 1992 and
completes Stanford's first 4-0 start
since 1986. In a series that dates back
to 1925, Saturday's win, combined
with last year's 45-38 victory over
the Irish, was also the first time Stan
ford defeated Notre Dame in con
secutive games.

The star of the game was un
doubtedly senior fullback/line
backer Owen Marecic, who had key
plays on both offense and defense.
One of the few two-way players in
major college football, Marecic
scored two touchdowns on consecu
tive plays.
Midway through the fourth quar
ter, Marecic got the call on second
and-goal on the Irish one-yard line,
and he powered his way through a
pile of Notre Dame defenders for a
rushing touchdown. After a two
point conversion and the ensuing
kickoff, Marecic (playing middle
linebacker this time) picked off
Notre Dame quarterback Dayne
Crist and ran 20 yards untouched
into the end zone for his second
touchdown of the day.

GAME NOTES: Stanford dominates the Fighting
Irish in a 37-14 win to continue on its undefeated
streak. With particularly key offensive and defen
sive contributions from Owen Marecic, as well as
a nearly impenetrable Cardinal defensive line,
the team built on its momentum and expanded its
record to 4-0.

Sophomore running back Stepfan Taylor took 108 yards on 28 carries, emerging as the key member of the Stanford
offense in Saturday's victory over Notre Dame. After four games, Taylor has become the feature back for the Cardinal.

"He's the perfect football player,"
said Stanford head coach Jim Har
baugh of Marecic after the game.
"You've just got to take your hat off
to him and enjoy watching him."
While the Card eventually came
to dominate the game, the beginning
of the contest did not look as prom
ising, especially after Notre Dame's
initial drive. The Cardinal defense
managed to force the Irish into a
punt, but senior punt returner Doug
Baldwin was unable to handle the
kick, and Notre Dame recovered
deep inside Stanford territory. The
defense managed to hold the Irish to
a field goal, putting Notre Dame up
3-0 and pressuring Stanford's of
fense to respond.
The Cardinal came out on its
opening drive and did just that,
marching 79 yards down the field.
The drive culminated in a beautiful
16-yard touchdown pass from red
shirt sophomore quarterback An
drew Luck to redshirt junior tight
end Coby Fleener to put Stanford
up 7-3.
That touchdown marked the last
time that Notre Dame could come
close to matching Stanford in the
game. Luck continued to make plays
with methodical efficiency, finishing
with 19-32 passing for 238 yards, a
touchdown and his first two inter
ceptions of the year, with both inter
ceptions coming off pass deflec
tions.
Stanford's running game also
had big contributions as sophomore
running back Stepfan Taylor gashed
the Irish for 108 yards on 28 carries.
While Harbaugh appears commit
ted to a backfield-by-committee ap
proach, Taylor has emerged as the
feature back for the offense in the
past couple weeks, receiving signifi
cantly more carries than sophomore
Tyler Gaffney or redshirt freshman
Usua Amanam.
While Marecic, Luck and Taylor
were certainly key components in
the Cardinal's victory, senior kicker
Nate Whitaker also was an impor
tant player. Whitaker tied a Stan
ford record by completing five field
goals in the game, splitting the up
rights on each one. Counting his two
extra points, Whitaker had a total of
17 points three more than the en
tire Notre Dame team.

In an interesting twist, Whitaker
actually spent his freshman and
sophomore years at Notre Dame
before transferring to Stanford in
2008 after losing the starting kicking
job for the Irish. Saturday's game
was the first time Whitaker had re
turned to Notre Dame Stadium
since transferring, and he dispelled
any doubts that arose after he
missed two extra points against
Wake Forest last weekend.
Whitaker is one of two Notre
Dame transfers on Stanford's roster.
The second, senior tight end Konrad
Reuland, was also a big part of Stan
ford's offense. He caught three pass
es from Luck for 48 yards and was
Stanford's second leading receiver
of the game behind Fleener.
Stanford's defense, its biggest
question mark heading into this sea
son, proved it is capable of shutting
down a high-scoring offense. Notre
Dame punted five times in the
game, scored only one touchdown
and coughed up two turnovers
throughout the course of the game,
including Marecic's game-sealing
pick-six in the fourth quarter.
The passing defense, which en
tered the game ranked No. I in the
nation, was not particularly impres
sive, giving up 304 yards on 25-44
passing to Crist. However, its run
defense was a stone wall, holding
the Irish to just 44 yards on 23 car
ries.
Stanford was able to make stops
when it counted the Fighting
Irish were only 4-13 on third-down
conversions, and the defense came
up with a huge stop on fourth-and
one in the fourth quarter to stifle
any hope Notre Dame had for a
comeback.
Meanwhile, the Stanford offense
came through in the clutch, going
11-16 on third downs. The Card re
lied neither solely on the running
game nor solely on Luck's arm for
conversions, a depth that will serve
it well as it hits the remainder of its
Pac-10 slate.
That schedule gets under way
this Saturday when Stanford travels
to No. 4 Oregon (4-0, 1-0). The
matchup figures to be the biggest
game on the Cardinal's schedule
this season, and the winner could
very well go on to win the Pac-10.
The game is set to kick off Satur
day at 5 p.m. in Eugene, Ore., and
will be nationally televised on ABC.
