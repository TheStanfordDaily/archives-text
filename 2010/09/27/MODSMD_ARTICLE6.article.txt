# TWO-WAY TERROR
## Marecic scores twice as Card rolls in South Bend 
### KABIR SAWHNEY MANAGING EDITOR 
In yet another strong showing,
the No. 9 Stanford football team
hammered Notre Dame on Satur
day, notching a 37-14 win over the
Fighting Irish. The win marks the re
turn of the Cardinal (4-0,1-0 Pac-10)
to the upper echelon of college foot
ball: it was the Card's first win in
Notre Dame Stadium since 1992 and
completes Stanford's first 4-0 start
since 1986. In a series that dates back
to 1925, Saturday's win, combined
with last year's 45-38 victory over
the Irish, was also the first time Stan
ford defeated Notre Dame in con
secutive games.

The star of the game was un
doubtedly senior fullback/line
backer Owen Marecic, who had key
plays on both offense and defense.
One of the few two-way players in
major college football, Marecic
scored two touchdowns on consecu
tive plays.
Midway through the fourth quar
ter, Marecic got the call on second
and-goal on the Irish one-yard line,
and he powered his way through a
pile of Notre Dame defenders for a
rushing touchdown. After a two
point conversion and the ensuing
kickoff, Marecic (playing middle
linebacker this time) picked off
Notre Dame quarterback Dayne
Crist and ran 20 yards untouched
into the end zone for his second
touchdown of the day.

GAME NOTES: Stanford dominates the Fighting
Irish in a 37-14 win to continue on its undefeated
streak. With particularly key offensive and defen
sive contributions from Owen Marecic, as well as
a nearly impenetrable Cardinal defensive line,
the team built on its momentum and expanded its
record to 4-0.

Sophomore running back Stepfan Taylor took 108 yards on 28 carries, emerging as the key member of the Stanford
offense in Saturday's victory over Notre Dame. After four games, Taylor has become the feature back for the Cardinal.
