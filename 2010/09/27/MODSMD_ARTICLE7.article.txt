## Rankings season all over the board Stanford slips one spot to fifth in 2011 U.S. News ranking 
### ELLEN HUET MANAGING EDITOR 
As the summer rush of col
lege rankings comes to a close,
Stanford dropped one place
from its long-held number No. 4
spot on the U.S. News and
World Report ranking, but the
University's name is beginning
to show up on many other alter
native lists that offer some vari
ety from the monolithic U.S.
News.
U.S. News has been collect
ing rankings since 1983, and
since 2006, Stanford has consis
tently ranked fourth, often
tying with Massachusetts Insti
tute of Technology, California
Institute of Technology and the
University of Pennsylvania. In
the 2011 rankings, released in
August, Stanford came in fifth.
U.S. News "tinkers with their
methodology from year to
year," said University spokes
woman Lisa Lapin. "This year,
they gave more weight to grad
uation rate."
"There's some thought that
they have to mix it up now and
then," she added.
Lapin said Stanford fills out
30 to 50 ranking requests a year.
Some are annual, and some ask
for new information every few
years. The University responds
to rankings by looking at sur
veyors' methodologies and how
valuable a ranking might be to
prospective students.
Although the U.S. News
rankings have long dominated
the field, in recent years, the
ranking organization's method
ology has come under fire, with
some universities eschewing
the process completely.
"The proliferation of rank

ings across the U.S. and the
world misdirects prospective
students from the importance
of institutional fit," Dean of Ad
mission Richard Shaw wrote in
an e-mail to The Daily. "There
are many, many fine colleges
and universities where students
can receive first class educa
tions. To make a decision about
your colleges choices based on
very imprecise measurement is
simply the wrong approach in
the consideration of under
graduate higher education."
For some universities, the
pressure to rise in rankings may
also create an incentive to mis
report data to the ranking or
ganizations. "There's always
that allegation," Lapin said.
"But we're very straightfor
ward about what we provide to
the organization."
Despite U.S. News' long
standing reputation, its ability
to accurately represent college
quality may be losing authen
ticity.
"There's a strong disadvan
tage to public universities,"
Lapin said. "The way [U.S.
News] weight financial criteria,
there's no way a public univer
sity could be in their top 10."
Traditionally, the highest
ranking public university on the
U.S. News ranking is UC-
Berkeley, coming in 22nd in
2011.
Shaw said he has not partici
pated in U.S. News' "reputa
tional survey," where the organ
ization asks university officials
to rate their peer institutions,
for "many years."
"My opinion is magazines
that rank everything are less in
terested in the public good and
more so on their bottom line,"
Shaw said.
In response to the growing
dissatisfaction with traditional
rankings within higher educa
tion, more alternative and tai-
lored rankings are appearing with
varying methodologies. As a result,
rankings this year varied greatly in
some cases from U.S. News.
Forbes entered the college rank
ings arena in 2008, and this year
ranked Stanford as sixth, emphasiz
ing student evaluations of profes
sors, graduation rates and alumni
percentages in "Who's Who in
America."
Washington Monthly, on the
other hand, released a ranking that
emphasized social mobility, research
and service initiatives at universities,
and Stanford placed fourth behind
three UCs UC-San Diego, UC-
Berkeley and UC-Los Angeles, re
spectively.
The Princeton Review ranked
Stanford third for "happiest students,"
but The Daily Beast ranked Stanford
as the top "most stressful school," a
measure that took into account crime
rate, presence of engineering pro
grams on campus and tuition costs, but
didn't factor in financial aid.
And Stanford took fifth in a Sier
ra Club "100 Cool Schools" for its
environmentally friendly programs.

A Wall Street Journal ranking that
emphasized a school's ability to cre
ate employable graduates did not
rank Stanford, but Lapin said the re
quest for the information came to
the school without enough time to
fill it out comprehensively, and
therefore the University "declined
to participate."
Whether or not rankings will
grow in variety or methodologies
will stay the same, Shaw's feelings

about the practice in general remain
unchanged.
"This process is in the end about
best fit and not bragging rights,"
Shaw said. "Pride should be focused
on the positive undergraduate expe
rience a student will have in choos
ing the college which best fits his or
her needs."
