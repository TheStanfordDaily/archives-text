## Rankings season all over the board Stanford slips one spot to fifth in 2011 U.S. News ranking 
### ELLEN HUET MANAGING EDITOR 
As the summer rush of col
lege rankings comes to a close,
Stanford dropped one place
from its long-held number No. 4
spot on the U.S. News and
World Report ranking, but the
University's name is beginning
to show up on many other alter
native lists that offer some vari
ety from the monolithic U.S.
News.
U.S. News has been collect
ing rankings since 1983, and
since 2006, Stanford has consis
tently ranked fourth, often
tying with Massachusetts Insti
tute of Technology, California
Institute of Technology and the
University of Pennsylvania. In
the 2011 rankings, released in
August, Stanford came in fifth.
U.S. News "tinkers with their
methodology from year to
year," said University spokes
woman Lisa Lapin. "This year,
they gave more weight to grad
uation rate."
"There's some thought that
they have to mix it up now and
then," she added.
Lapin said Stanford fills out
30 to 50 ranking requests a year.
Some are annual, and some ask
for new information every few
years. The University responds
to rankings by looking at sur
veyors' methodologies and how
valuable a ranking might be to
prospective students.
Although the U.S. News
rankings have long dominated
the field, in recent years, the
ranking organization's method
ology has come under fire, with
some universities eschewing
the process completely.
"The proliferation of rank

ings across the U.S. and the
world misdirects prospective
students from the importance
of institutional fit," Dean of Ad
mission Richard Shaw wrote in
an e-mail to The Daily. "There
are many, many fine colleges
and universities where students
can receive first class educa
tions. To make a decision about
your colleges choices based on
very imprecise measurement is
simply the wrong approach in
the consideration of under
graduate higher education."
For some universities, the
pressure to rise in rankings may
also create an incentive to mis
report data to the ranking or
ganizations. "There's always
that allegation," Lapin said.
"But we're very straightfor
ward about what we provide to
the organization."
Despite U.S. News' long
standing reputation, its ability
to accurately represent college
quality may be losing authen
ticity.
"There's a strong disadvan
tage to public universities,"
Lapin said. "The way [U.S.
News] weight financial criteria,
there's no way a public univer
sity could be in their top 10."
Traditionally, the highest
ranking public university on the
U.S. News ranking is UC-
Berkeley, coming in 22nd in
2011.
Shaw said he has not partici
pated in U.S. News' "reputa
tional survey," where the organ
ization asks university officials
to rate their peer institutions,
for "many years."
"My opinion is magazines
that rank everything are less in
terested in the public good and
more so on their bottom line,"
Shaw said.
In response to the growing
dissatisfaction with traditional
rankings within higher educa
tion, more alternative and tai-
