## Consumer preferences may have genetic link Research on twins shows certain heritable effects 
### ERIN INMAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Feel strangely compelled to buy a
Prius? Marketing strategies may not
be the only thing driving you to do so.
It may be in your genes.
Consumer preferences may re
flect genetically heritable prudence
dispositions, a new study in the Jour
nal of Consumer Research sug
gests. Led by business professor
Itamar Simonson and Aner Sela,
an assistant professor of market
ing at University of Florida, the
study gives weight to the role of
genetics in consumer decision
making.
"We try to identify underlying
patterns by simultaneously test
ing a wide range of potentially
related choices, judgments and
personal characteristics," Si
monson wrote in an e-mail to
The Daily.
Researchers compared
study pools of fraternal
and identical twins and
found greater similarities
between the latter
group. Because identi
cal twins share 100
percent of their
genes, while frater
nal twins do not,
the researchers
could therefore/
determine that genet
ics influenced those trends
in consumer preferences.
According to a summary of the
study provided by Simonson, largely
heritable effects included, for exam
ple, tendencies to either engage in or
refrain from compromising or gam
bling. Research also showed a herita
ble preference for specific products,
such as mustard, hybrid cars, science
fiction movies, chocolate and jazz,
while tattooing and ketchup had no
observed genetic linkage.
Other tendencies with no signifi
cant heritable effects included pref

erences between options that pro
duced large rewards later versus
smaller rewards sooner, as well as
preferences in product variety.
This is not to say that people are
born with a "Prius gene" or a "jazz
gene." Instead, these tendencies re
flect a combination of genetic ex
pressions influenced by the interac
tion between nature and nurture, say
the researchers.

The study proposes as a "tentative
hypothe-

sis"
that the ob
served heritability patterns reflect a
genetic disposition for "living on the
edge or in the mainstream."
"At the present time, we do not
know how genes might affect... the
tendency to choose a compromise
versus an extreme option, a risky ver
sus safe option or batteries versus
Godiva chocolate," Simonson said.

"This is a preliminary investigation,
and given the difficulties of under
standing such heritable tendencies, it
may take decades until we have a
good understanding.
The research suggests that envi
ronmental effects alone do not guide
consumer behavior, but that herita
ble preferences play a key role as
well.
Genetic research could reveal
promising target consumer seg

ments for certain types of products.
For example, if a preference for mo
tion sensitive devices is found to be
heritable, the Nintendo Wii or Apple
iPhone could benefit from under
standing these genetic predisposi
tions.
While there is still progress to be
made on pinpointing the underlying
biological causes for these consumer
preferences, the researchers remain
hopeful that the consumer market
can benefit from further study of the
role of genetics in judgment and
choice.
