# OPINIONS
## EDITORIAL Difficult questions persist after endowment report 
### 
Late Monday, Stanford Management
Company released the investment fig
ures from the 2010 fiscal year and the
endowment figures for 2011. From this devel
opment, there is much in which we can take
heart. The University's 14.4 percent return on
the Merged Pool (MP), the main pot of in
vestment funds for the school, means that
those controlling the purse strings of the Farm
are doing a damn good job.
In addition, the endowment stands at a
heady $13.8 billion, more than securing Stan
ford as one of the world's richest institutions
of higher education. Over the course of the
2009 fiscal year, the endowment plummeted
from $17.2 to $12.6 billion. The fact we have
recouped a significant portion of those losses
in only a year is a very good sign. Provost
Etchemendy, in his report to the Faculty Sen
ate last spring, spoke of a nearing end to
salary freezes. From this body of evidence, is
not unreasonable to say that Stanford weath
ered the storm and is on its way back up.
But before we break out the bubbly and
pass out the Cubans, there are still some
deep, overriding issues that this University
and its community must grapple with. While
a 14.4 percent return on the Merged Pool is
more than double the average for the past
decade, the aforementioned fund lost a wal
loping 25.9 percent in 2009, and we are still
not close to our overfilling coffers of the mid
2000s. Our endowment currently is only 80
percent as large as it was in 2008. It is lunacy
to deny that Stanford is not absurdly well-off.
But after a freeze on faculty salaries, one of
the third rails of the academy, and a halt or
delay on a great many construction projects,
the effects of the recession remain with us.
This increasingly rosy but still muddled
financial situation invariably leads to a dis
cussion of prioritization. For myriad rea

sons, the average Stanford student will not
have a chance to substantively impact the
course of budget decisions made by admin
istrators. For those who were on campus
during the 2009 school year, it is not difficult
to recollect the sheer amount of hours stu
dent government poured into lobbying,
pleading and even slightly cajoling the ad
ministration to take into consideration
some of the issues central to the student
body. And while some small successes were
achieved, they were by and large peripheral
to bigger and more daunting issues.
Stanford, as a center of higher learning, is
tasked first and foremost with educating stu
dents. But at a university as complex as ours,
we need to realize we are merely part of a
much larger equation.
That is no excuse to simply check out.
Rather, this should motivate a greater con
templation of what, exactly, the Stanford ex
perience entails. The Farm likes to tote itself
as a research university, but then why hasn't
research funding (ignoring stimulus funding)
substatively increased over the last half
decade?
As this school year progresses, take time
to think and talk about what makes Stanford
... well, Stanford. Ts it your peers, many of
whom are here because Stanford's financial
aid is paying their bills? Is it the professors
and TAs, whose positions and fiscal security
have been precarious for the past year? Is it
the physical residences in which you live,
many of which are in states of disrepair? Or
could it be your student groups, which have
been impacted by the reduced hours of Stu
dent Affairs? As a university, we must not
shirk from frankly and openly discussing
these matters, because the choices made
now will affect the long term course of this
institution.
