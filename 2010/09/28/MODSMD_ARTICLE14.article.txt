# GIRL YOU KNOW IT'S TRUE
## What Stephen Colbert Has In Common with Elmo 
### Jordan Carr 
Stephen Colbert testified before Con
gress on Friday on the matter of farm
labor and immigration. Very serious
people such as David Corn of Mother Jones
raised objections along the lines of "Colbert
is making a mockery of this hearing." Though
Corn is probably most upset that Colbert
claimed "'corn-packer' is a derogatory term
for a gay lowan," others have taken up the ar
gument as well.
Rep. Steve King (R-IA) a man who
was once the lone vote against acknowledg
ing the role of slave labor in building the
Capitol took a few minutes to turn up the
heat on Colbert and demand that he answer
whether he was packing or unpacking the
corn and described the whole affair as "an in
sult to the time, an insult to the intelligence of
the American people." Reporters from Na
tional Review, The Washington Post and Rep.
Steve Cohen (D-TN) all labeled the affair a
mockery as well.
But let's drop some R. Kelly-style Real
Talk here: nobody would ever, ever care
about this particular hearing if there weren't
a famous person there. Even with Colbert
there, at least one congresswoman I'm
looking at you, Sheila Jackson Lee (D-TX)
was seen texting during the hearing.
So, if it takes Lil' Wayne to spice up a hear
ing on the reauthorization of the National
Flood Insurance Program ("Mr. Carter, what
exactly do you mean by 'make it rain?'") by
all means, go for it, attention-starved con
gressmen. Pulling some random celebrity to
testify on an issue where they lack expertise
is nothing new. In fact, I have four examples
of even less dignified moments in legislative
history.
Novelist Michael Crichton testifies before
the Senate Committee on Environment and
Public Works on climate change, 2005
The late author of such works as "The An
dromeda Strain," "Congo" and "Jurassic
Park" and onetime member of People Maga
zine's list of the "50 Most Beautiful People"
was called to testify on the matter of climate
change in large part due to his 2004 novel
"State of Fear," which chair James Inhofe (R
-OK) made required reading for the commit
tee. Considering the novel is the story of a
bunch of evil eco-terrorists operating under
the umbrella of organizations with such
bizarrely un-menacing acronyms as NERF
and ELF getting ready to kill large numbers
of people in a tsunami they've created to
raise money for environmental causes, it may
come as no surprise that Crichton was there
to talk about how fake global warming is.
The Brookings Institute described "State
of Fear" as "notable mainly for its nuttiness,"
which is surprising, since it is, you know,
called "State of Fear." Though he did have
some credentials, being a Harvard Med

School graduate and all, Michael Crichton
was a climate expert in the same way that Dr.
Phil is a podiatrist.
Rapper Hurricane Chris Performs "Halle
Berry (She's Fine)" on the Floor of the
Louisiana Legislature, 2009
Remember that song, "A Bay Bay"? No?
It was a thing in 2007,1 swear. Anyway, the
Louisiana House of Representatives saw fit
to honor its creator, Shreveport-native Hur
ricane Chris, by giving him the floor for a few
minutes, during which he performed a class
ify self-edited version of his song "Halle
Berry (She's Fine)."
That said, this cannot be regarded as that
big of a disgrace on the Louisiana legislature
because 1) Mr. Chris was wearing a suit, and
2) as Rep. Billy Tauzin, who left to work as a
pharmaceutical lobbyist promptly after over
seeing the Medicare Prescription Drug Bill
of 2003, once noted, "Half of Louisiana is
under water, and the other half is under in
dictment." And for what it's worth, New Or
leans isn't exactly Vatican City, either.
Muppet Elmo testifies before the Education
Appropriations Subcommittee, 2002
Say what you will about Stephen Colbert,
but he's not a puppet made out of red felt that
speaks in the third person. And Elmo was
asked to testify by Randall "Duke" Cunning
ham, whose corruption and bribery convic
tions stemmed in part from an illegally ob
tained yacht named the "Duke Stir." If "Con
victed Bribe Recipient Invites Puppet to
Give Expert Testimony" is no longer an obvi
ous sign of bad governance, perhaps we're
getting too jaded.
Backstreet Boy Kevin Richardson testifies
before Senate Subcommittee on Environ
ment and Public Works, 2002
Backstreet's back to testify about the
damaging practice of coal mining in Ken
tucky? Alright! Not surprisingly, Sen. George
Voinovich (R-OH) described calling on Mr.
Richardson's expertise as "a joke." Richard
son, who was always the socially conscious
one, noted "I am not a scientist, but I do know
what I've seen in flights over the coal fields."
