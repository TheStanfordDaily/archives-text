## Party Like a Grown-Up 
### Jade Wang 
I spent much of last week entrenched in
party-planning mode, frantically prepar
ing for my slightly belated housewarming.
It was quite the success, and if I sound a little
smug about it, it's because I am.
The planning process involved the kind of
stubborn persistence that only my favorite
things, parties and making lists, can inspire. I
threw myself into this task with a fervor that
surprised even me, eventually resorting to
using spreadsheets to organize my RSVP
tracking system and tiered to-do lists.
The day of the party was devoted solely to
preparation, which included a marathon af
ternoon of making hors d'oeuvres and an
evening of artfully arranging the living room
and mopping.
As my fellow hostesses and I swept and
sliced summer squash, I wondered if it is nor
mal to prepare for a housewarming with such
intensity. What drove me to the state of party
planning where I actually made a flowchart
of the ideal tempo and mood of my meticu
lously timed playlist? Is this normal? If not, is
it at least acceptably close to normal?
While I cannot attribute all of the insanity
to the Stanford effect, upon reflection, I cer
tainly think I drew heavily from the past four
years. As an undergraduate who was lucky
enough to spend three years on the Row, I
relished the sense of community and pride
generated from my place of residence, per
haps to a degree that I am ashamed to say oc
casionally bordered on belligerence.
Even as a freshman, though I scoffed at
the incessant dorm chanting asked of me dur
ing the entire first month of school, I had
somewhere to expend this energy. Now, with
no repetitive chants and a lack of bi-weekly
social gatherings through which to funnel my
instinctive and fierce pride, I apparently be

come a manic version of myself when prepar
ing my home for company. The competitive
streak I try so hard to hide rears its less-than
pleasant face in the unnecessary perfection
ism that causes me to rethink and overana
lyze both the appearance and gastronomical
cues of garnishes on dips.
It seems, somewhat unexpectedly, that
this part of my Stanford experience has fol
lowed me faithfully, and though I would hes
itate to say I am ready to create and start
shrieking a chant about my apartment, I do
invest a great deal of my identity in my
domicile. This is an instinctive feeling for
me, coming to the surface much more read

ily than my supposed bachelor-level expert
ise on science.
I don't think that community and pride
and ownership are exclusive to the Stanford
experience, but I do think that I learned them
on campus. (I never did seriously consider
the aesthetics of the bookshelves in my par
ents' house while I was in high school, and I
certainly never mopped anything three times
in one day.) For many of us, Stanford is where
we do a lot of our growing up, a large part of
which, for me, is asserting my independence
and identity through engaging with my
home, one of the first things over which my
parents had little to no control.
This might manifest itself in the question
able choices we all make in covering every
inch of white walls in our first dorm rooms
with posters, photographs, ticket stubs, a loud
announcement to the world, "This is what I
like! This is who I am!" I devoted my life to
running my house's kitchen one year, a labor
of love born of my giddy independence.
This is not to say that my throwing of one
successful housewarming marks a smooth
and clean-cut transition into adulthood. In
fact, I would venture a thought that a real
adult might merely smile indulgently upon
witnessing the obsessive process I took to
get there, thinking about the next stage of
growing up that has yet to make its way into
my conscious mind. Ultimately, I am relieved
that the love of home that I found at Stan
ford is something that is so easily trans
ferrable and that I have managed to con
vince myself that throwing parties is just a
part of growing up that I should indulge in as
much as possible.

Is this normal? If
not, is it at least
acceptably close to
normal?
