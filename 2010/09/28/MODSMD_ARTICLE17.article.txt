## KILLER KLINEMAN Senior outside hitter racks up 60 kills to lead Cardinal 
### KATHERINE KNOX 
In the opening weekend of Pac-10 Conference play, the No. 1
Stanford women's volleyball team (11-0,2-0 Pac-10) won swift
victories over both Arizona State (5-8,0-2) and Arizona (10-4,0-
2).
The Card left Tempe with a slim 3-1 victory over ASU, 25-23,
27-25,23-25,25-21.

Early service and at
tacking errors from both
sides kept the first set close.
After getting over its con
ference-opening jitters,
Stanford strung together a
streak of six first-strike
side-outs at 16-16, en route
to winning its first set of
Pac-10 competition, 25-23.

The second set likewise
went to Stanford, 27-25.
Each team posted its low
est hitting percentage of
the night with .216 and .259
for ASU and Stanford, re
spectively. Effective de
fense by the two experi
enced liberos, Stanford
senior Gabi Ailes and ASU
senior Sarah Johnson, was
critical in preventing either
team from gaining a signif
icant offensive edge. Ailes
earned a match-high 24

digs, while Johnson was runner-up with 21.
ASU demonstrated renewed spirit after the break, pulling
out the third set, 25-23.The Cardinal fell four points behind mid
set after three consecutive hitting errors, each from a different
player. The Sun Devils were led by the offense of senior outside
hitter Sarah Reaves and sophomore middle blocker Erica Wil
son, who hit .250 and .500 respectively on the match.
The Cardinal took the fourth set 25-21 under the leadership
of senior outside hitter Alix Klineman, who reeled in 11 kills in
the fourth set en route to earning a career-high 39 kills on the
match. ASU's Reaves totaled the next-highest 23 kills on 68 at
tempts, as both players took over twice the number of swings and
merited twice as many kills as any given teammate.
Arizona, though boasting a better record than ASU, dropped
quickly to the Cardinal in straight sets, 25-14,25-19,25-23.
The Wildcats were at a disadvantage before the first set even
began, as a submission of the wrong line-up forced them into an
unconventional format. The ensuing confusion prevented Ari
zona from gaining momentum against the Card.
A well-executed side-out game from Stanford brought it the
first set easily, 25-14.
While a serving run by sophomore setter Karissa Cook gave
Stanford a decisive six-point lead in the second set, it was the crit
ical timing of service errors by the Wildcats that ultimately cost
them the set going into the break.
Arizona posted its best score of the night in the third set, led
by junior opposite Courtney Karst and senior outside hitter
Tiffany Owens, who brought Arizona back to tie the score at 20-
20 after being down 17-12. Owens led her team with 39 attempts

on the match, as the weight of the Arizona offense rested large
ly on the pin hitters.The performances of these key players yield
ed crucially timed kills from Karst and Owens in particular
that nearly cost the Card its sweep down the stretch.
Stanford rested Cook in the third, moving away from its tra
ditional two-setter offense. Senior setter Cassidy Lichtman took
control of the set, setting up Klineman for the three kills that
closed out the match. She contributed 21 kills on the night, mak

ing her the uncontested kill leader for the seventh consecutive
match.
"It felt really good to start off the Pac-10 2-0. Everyone knows
how hard it is to win on the road, especially in this conference,"
Klineman said. "Arizona State definitely showed us that we still
have some things to work on, but it always feels good to walk
