# Stanford vs. Oregon: the rundown
## 
### Jacob Jaffe Fields of Failure 
In 1997,13 years ago yesterday,
Stanford football outlasted Ore
gon 58-49 in the most exciting
game I had ever seen live. I was
only seven at the time, tagging
along with my parents at their reunion,
but I'd had enough training in football
watching from my family to under
stand the game. (Dad, the brainwash
ing worked I still love Stanford and
football.) Both teams traded touch
downs, with Stanford's Chad Hutchin
son and Oregon's Jason Maas and Akili
Smith combining for 10 touchdowns
through the air. Young, naive me be
lieved that I'd often see games with 107
points in which my favorite team came
out on top. I miss that version of myself.
Fast forward to last year. I had expe
rienced 12 more years of football, yet
nothing had quite matched the explo
siveness and emotional swings of that
1997 game. That all changed when No.
7 Oregon came to town. In a game that
was more detrimental to my cardiovas
cular system than a year of the "Super
Size Me" diet, Stanford held on 51-42
against one of the most potent offenses
in the nation.
It was high-scoring (93 total points
and more than 1,000 total yards). It was
close (the nine-point margin of victory
masked the momentum swings and
general feelings of terror any Cardinal
fan felt every two or three seconds). It
was a major upset (Stanford was un
ranked and riding a seven-year bowl
absence, while Oregon was considered
a national title contender). It featured
remarkable performances (Toby Ger
hart broke the Stanford record for
rushing yards in a game with 223). It
was the Cardinal's coming-out party (it
brought Stanford national attention,
made Stanford bowl-eligible for the
first time since 2001 and put Stanford
into the national rankings for the first
time in years). Quite frankly, it was the
best game I've ever seen.
Why do I bring up two exciting
Stanford-Oregon football games, you
ask? Well, if you actually need to ask
that question, you must live some
where devoid of football (and there
fore happiness). This Saturday, Stan
ford and Oregon will face off yet again,
but this matchup could be the Cardi
nal's most important game since the
2000 Rose Bowl. Oregon is the No. 4
