# Stanford vs. Oregon: the rundown
## 
### Jacob Jaffe Fields of Failure 
In 1997,13 years ago yesterday,
Stanford football outlasted Ore
gon 58-49 in the most exciting
game I had ever seen live. I was
only seven at the time, tagging
along with my parents at their reunion,
but I'd had enough training in football
watching from my family to under
stand the game. (Dad, the brainwash
ing worked I still love Stanford and
football.) Both teams traded touch
downs, with Stanford's Chad Hutchin
son and Oregon's Jason Maas and Akili
Smith combining for 10 touchdowns
through the air. Young, naive me be
lieved that I'd often see games with 107
points in which my favorite team came
out on top. I miss that version of myself.
Fast forward to last year. I had expe
rienced 12 more years of football, yet
nothing had quite matched the explo
siveness and emotional swings of that
1997 game. That all changed when No.
7 Oregon came to town. In a game that
was more detrimental to my cardiovas
cular system than a year of the "Super
Size Me" diet, Stanford held on 51-42
against one of the most potent offenses
in the nation.
It was high-scoring (93 total points
and more than 1,000 total yards). It was
close (the nine-point margin of victory
masked the momentum swings and
general feelings of terror any Cardinal
fan felt every two or three seconds). It
was a major upset (Stanford was un
ranked and riding a seven-year bowl
absence, while Oregon was considered
a national title contender). It featured
remarkable performances (Toby Ger
hart broke the Stanford record for
rushing yards in a game with 223). It
was the Cardinal's coming-out party (it
brought Stanford national attention,
made Stanford bowl-eligible for the
first time since 2001 and put Stanford
into the national rankings for the first
time in years). Quite frankly, it was the
best game I've ever seen.
Why do I bring up two exciting
Stanford-Oregon football games, you
ask? Well, if you actually need to ask
that question, you must live some
where devoid of football (and there
fore happiness). This Saturday, Stan
ford and Oregon will face off yet again,
but this matchup could be the Cardi
nal's most important game since the
2000 Rose Bowl. Oregon is the No. 4

team in the country and one of the
fastest and scariest teams in all of col
lege football. Stanford has coasted
through four easy victories, propelling
the Cardinal to No. 9 in the country, its
best mark since 1992.
The game is so important that
ESPN moved the game from 8:15 p.m.
to 5 p.m. and from its own channel to
ABC in order to draw more viewers,
particularly on the East Coast. ESPN is
also filming College Game Day live
from Eugene on Saturday, which is
slightly surprising considering Alaba
ma-Florida and Texas-Oklahoma will
take place on the same day. So what can
we expect from this game?
It's the Pac-10 game of the year...
for now. Most of the media are billing
this game as the most important Pac-10
contest of the season. It sure looks like
it, as both teams are in the top 10 and
both have a legitimate shot at confer
ence and national titles if they win. On
the other hand, last year's "Pac-10

game of the year" was Oregon-USC,
but that turned into a blowout and did
n't end up having nearly as much of an
impact on the conference as Oregon-
Arizona or Oregon-Oregon State. So
get excited for this game, but remem
ber there are seven games on the
schedule after this one.
Replacements will play a role. Each
team in this game returns the majority
of its key playmakers from last year.
The main exceptions are Toby Ger
hart, who left Stanford to make mil
lions in the NFL, and Jeremiah Masoli,
who left Oregon to avoid NCAA back
lash and to lose to Jacksonville State.
Gerhart was the best running back in
the nation last year (say what you will
about the Heisman, but he did win the
Doak Walker Award), and Masoli was
expected to be one of the best quarter
backs in the country this year. Their
successors will have big shoes to fill,
and just how big their feet are (the
metaphor can only go so far) will play a
big part in determining Saturday's win
ner.
Oregon quarterback Darron
Thomas has been solid, if unspectacu
lar, while leading the high-powered
Oregon offense. He has been at the
helm of an offense that leads the nation
in scoring, so he is clearly doing well.
But it remains to be seen how Thomas
will perform if or when he is asked to
win the game himself, rather than rely
ing on his stellar skill position players,
especially LaMichael James and Ken
jon Barner.
Stanford's running game has han
dled the loss of Toby Gerhart well so
far by using the rarely successful back
field-by-committee. It seems to be
working for the Cardinal, though, as
Stanford is averaging 223 rushing yards
per game, which trails only Oregon in
the Pac-10. Still, the Oregon defense
will provide quite a test, so the ability of
Stepfan Taylor and Co. to step up will
be a major factor in Stanford's success.
The old adages will apply. One of
the most widely used cliches in football
is that winners run and stop the run. In
big games, this does seem to hold true,
and both of these teams embody that
mantra. The Oregon spread rushing at
tack could very well be the best in the
country, racking up over 320 yards per
game despite its best back, James, miss
ing the first game of the season. Stan
ford has greatly improved at stopping
the run, ranked 34th in run defense.
This ranking vastly underestimates the
performance of the defense, though,
because most of those yards came
against backups after the games were
more or less decided. The Cardinal de
fense came up big against the best run
ning team it has seen so far, the 15th
ranked Wake Forest rushing offense,
but Oregon is a whole different animal.
On the other side of the ball, Stan
ford's collection of running backs has
adequately kept Andrew Luck from
having to shoulder the offensive load
alone. Stepfan Taylor, Tyler Gaffney,
Jeremy Stewart, Usua Amanam, An
thony Wilkerson, Owen Marecic and
Luck have combined to keep defenses
off-balance, and Stanford could need
any or all of them in order to crack Ore
gon's underrated defense. The Cardi

nal does have the luxury of one of the
best offensive lines in the nation, but it
will be up against the best defensive
front it has seen all year.
Who's overrated? The statistics of
both teams have been Madden-like
through the first third of the season, but
neither team has faced a legitimate test
yet. Stanford's only road games have
been against the then-hapless (and
pre-Longhorn-slaying) UCLA Bruins
and the perennially overrated Fighting
Irish of Notre Dame. Neither team or
stadium can compare to Oregon and
Autzen Stadium, so Stanford could be
in for a rude awakening under the
lights on Saturday.
On the other hand, Oregon could
be ill-prepared for its toughest game of
the season. Oregon breezed through its
first three games before getting its
money's worth against Arizona State
last weekend. The Ducks were out
played through most of the game and
gave up 600 yards of total offense
more than they had given up all season
to a decent Arizona State offense.
The saving grace for Oregon's defense
was the ball-handling of Arizona State,
because the Sun Devils' seven
turnovers cost them the game. Stan
ford's offense, which has only five
turnovers total in four games, is unlike
ly to be so generous with the football,
so Oregon might have its hands full
with the No. 4 scoring offense in the
country.
Most likely, neither of these teams
will disappoint, and the game could
end up being a classic. The pollsters
predict it will be a close game, with the
spread favoring Oregon by a touch
down
Who will win? Well, for that you'll
have to wait for our predictions in Fri
day's paper and for the game on Satur
day night.

thing about who's injured this week.
