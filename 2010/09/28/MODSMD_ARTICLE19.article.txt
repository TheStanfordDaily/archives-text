# Invitational wins for Cardinal XC
## 
### ZACH ZIMMERMAN DESK EDITOR 
It was deja vu at the Stanford Golf Course on Saturday,
as the Stanford men's and women's cross country teams
swept the Stanford Invitational once again.
The No. 1 men's side looked to reclaim its dominance
from one year ago, when it took the first four positions in
the men's 8,000-meter race. Although the individual title
went to a non-Cardi

Stanford placed four
runners in the top 10.
Senior David Mc-

team exceeded expectations by winning

event in Indiana will pit the Cardinal
against much tougher competition than it
faced last weekend on the Farm.

Rather than relying on a single runner, Stanford utilized a team running strategy to triumph in last weekend's Stanford Invitational, held at the Stanford Golf Course.
The men's team defended its No. 1 national ranking and will continue its defense as the team travels to Indiana in two weeks to face much stiffer competition.
