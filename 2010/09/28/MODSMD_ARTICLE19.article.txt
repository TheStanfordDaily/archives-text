# Invitational wins for Cardinal XC
## 
### ZACH ZIMMERMAN DESK EDITOR 
It was deja vu at the Stanford Golf Course on Saturday,
as the Stanford men's and women's cross country teams
swept the Stanford Invitational once again.
The No. 1 men's side looked to reclaim its dominance
from one year ago, when it took the first four positions in
the men's 8,000-meter race. Although the individual title
went to a non-Cardi

nal runner this year,
Stanford placed four
runners in the top 10.
Senior David Mc-
Neill of Northern Ari
zona won the race
with a time of 23:18.
McNeill jumped out
to a big lead after 800
meters, at one point
beating the field by al
most 30 seconds. He
was chased by a quar
tet of Cardinal run
ners â€” juniors Chris
Derrick and Ben
jamin Johnson, red
shirt junior Jake Riley
and senior Elliott
Heath.
Although Mc-
Neill's performance
caught many of the
spectators off guard,
Stanford knew what

to expect from last year's NCAA Championships runner
up.
"It wasn't necessarily surprising to see McNeill go out
fast, but it was a little surprising to see him make such a
rapid move after hanging back for the first six to eight
hundred meters," Heath said. "He is a great runner, so we
were definitely expecting to see him at the front of the
race, but when he made his move early, we decided to let

GAME NOTES: The Cardinal men put up a
stiff defense of their No. 1 national rank
ing with a team win in the Stanford Invita
tional last weekend, while the women's
team exceeded expectations by winning
their team event as well. Stanford's next
event in Indiana will pit the Cardinal
against much tougher competition than it
faced last weekend on the Farm.

Rather than relying on a single runner, Stanford utilized a team running strategy to triumph in last weekend's Stanford Invitational, held at the Stanford Golf Course.
The men's team defended its No. 1 national ranking and will continue its defense as the team travels to Indiana in two weeks to face much stiffer competition.
him go a little bit and work together
as a team for a while."
Toward the end of the race, the
front of the pack kicked hard. In an
other classic finish, Heath, Riley
and Derrick crossed the line side
by-side, just four seconds behind
McNeill with identical times of
23:22. Johnson dropped just behind,
but finished in 23:41, good for
eighth overall. Redshirt sophomore
Miles Unterreiner capped off the
men's scoring with a 15th-place fin
ish in 24:05.
Heath felt the team, which beat
second-place Arkansas by 12 points,
executed its strategy well on Satur
day.
"Coming away from the race, I
think we generally ran the way we
wanted to heading in," he said.
"There is always a lot of excitement
that goes along with the first meet of
the year because it gives us some in
dication of how all the summer
training has set us up for the season.

We had a couple of guys that didn't
have great races, but I think we ran
fairly well as a team overall."
"The first meet is always a tough
thing to judge, because it is usually
quite hot and so much tends to
change as the season moves along,"
Derrick added. "I would say that the
meet confirmed a lot of the things
we have been seeing in training."
The No. 14 Cardinal women also
came away victorious on Saturday,
breezing through the competition
with just 41 total points. They were
led by sophomore sensation Kathy
Kroeger, who placed first overall in
the 6,000-meter race with a time of
20:06.
Junior Georgia Griffin was close
behind, finishing in fifth overall
while running a personal-best time
of 20:45.
Also finishing in the top 15 were
sophomore Alex Dunne (10th),
freshman Jessica Tonn (12th), sen
ior Alex Gits (14th) and junior
Steph Marcy (15th).
Aside from an overall team title,
Kroeger says the women set out to
accomplish another achievement
on Saturday.
"Our goal for the race was to win

as a team and particularly to de
stroy Cal," she said. "We definitely
accomplished that and set the tone
for a strong season of improvement
ahead."
The women ran a slightly differ
ent race than the men, sending
Kroeger out in front of the rest of
the team. This strategy worked out
to their advantage on Saturday, but
the Cardinal women see this differ
ence as room for improvement.
"The men's team does a really
good job of running as a pack,"
Kroeger said. "On the women's
side, we aren't quite as good at that
yet. As we continue to consistently
train hard together and race more
together, we should be able to work
together better in races."
Up next for both teams is the
NCAA Pre-National competition,
which takes place on Oct. 16 in
Terre Haute, Ind. There, the Cardi
nal will face a stronger field, and
fans will be able to better gauge the
potential of both the men's and
women's teams.
