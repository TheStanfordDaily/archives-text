## Aid through education in Afghanistan The 						Law School project writes legal textbooks for Afghanistan 
### CAITY MONROE DESK EDITOR 
For countries in turmoil, an aid greater than im
mediate help is the sustainable development of
legal institutions a mantra that a group of Stan
ford law students have taken to heart in expanding
a foundation for rule of law in Afghanistan.
The Afghanistan Legal Education Project
(ALEP) is working to provide legal education and
an essential foundation for a stable and successful
rule of law in Afghanistan. It is also filling a void
left by other international and domestic efforts to
rebuild Afghan society, work that was recently rec
ognized by a U.S. State Department grant.
"Right now, the world is pouring billions of dol
lars into Afghanistan to establish institutions for
the rule of law," said Stanford Law School dean and
project faculty advisor Larry Kramer. "For all of
those institutions to work, they require lawyers to
run them. What we were looking at [before the start
of ALEP] was a system in which there would be no
lawyers in 10 years."
Founded in 2007 by Stanford Law students
Alexander Benard J.D. 'OB and Eli Sugarman J.D.
'O9, the project researches, writes and publishes
legal textbooks to help students in Afghanistan
learn about their country's developing legal sys
tem. The project has partnered with the Kabul
based American University in Afghanistan and
also has all of its materials free and available to
anyone who wants them online. ALEP is set to pub
lish its fourth legal textbook this winter.
"They're pretty much the only comprehensive
textbooks about Afghan law that have been written
in the last 20 or so years," said team leader and
third-year law student Morgan Galland.
Not only do these textbooks provide the much
needed legal foundation for the future leaders of
Afghanistan's justice system, but they do so with sta
bility and sustainability two important character-
istics of initiatives in Afghanistan
as guiding principles.
"In Afghanistan, laws may not
last as they are," Galland said. "The
way that we are teaching the law is
getting people to think about how
to interpret law, think critically
about law and about how to change
law. They are skills that will be im
portant even if the law changes. So
it's kind of a long-term ambition
rather than kind of a short-term,
'We'll teach you the laws as they are
now."'
Law student and team member
Stephenie Gosnell, who served as a
Marine Corps officer for seven
years, spoke to the importance of
legal education in stabilizing the
country.

"One of the more important les
sons I learned from serving in
Baghdad is that stabilizing a coun
try like Iraq or Afghanistan is an
extraordinarily complex task," she
wrote in an e-mail to The Daily.
"Legal education is one of the
many aspects that contributes to
the growth of civil society," she
added.
The project's success in provid
ing Afghan society with viable solu
tions for the future of their infant
legal system has been recognized
by more than just the students and
professors who use the textbooks.
Most recently, the U.S. State De
partment awarded ALEP with a
$1.3 million grant this fall to contin
ue its work.
In addition to providing for the
basic resources necessary to re
search, write and publish these text
books, the grant will help fund con
sultation with legal experts, trips to
Afghanistan to evaluate the cur

riculum and the positioning of a
postdoctoral fellow on the ground
in Afghanistan, Kramer said.
ALEP's success has extended
beyond the university classroom in
Afghanistan. The textbooks have
shown to be useful in educating
other members of Afghan society
including military personnel and
civilians working on the rule of law
about new laws and developing
legal system. The project also is
working on efforts to translate the
books into Dari and Pashto, which
will further expand the use of the
textbooks throughout Afghanistan.
ALEP has even inspired efforts
outside Afghanistan's borders, with
similar Stanford Law School proj
ects now being implemented in
Bhutan and East Timor.
"I wouldn't be surprised if a lot
more of these projects pop up,"
Galland said, "which would be
great. It's awesome to be able to in
spire others to do similar things."
The project, with its focuses on
long-term sustainability and edu
cating Afghans themselves, may
offer a promising form of interna
tional peace-building. Galland, who
previously spent two years in Laos
doing development work, said the
particular mission of ALEP was
one thing that attracted her to the
project in the first place.
"I had a mixed bag of experi
ences and kind of came to realize
that I thought that education was
probably one of the most important
ways to contribute to a developing
country," she said. "It's also away to
teach people how to think instead
of what to think, if you do it well.
And I had kind of gotten sick of
people who come to different coun
tries and tell them what to do."
