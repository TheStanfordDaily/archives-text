## Stanford field hockey gets weekend split in North Carolina 
### â€“ Kabir Sawhney 
After a tough 2-1 loss to NorPac
Conference rival California last week
end, the No. 18 Stanford field hockey
team embarked on a two-game road
trip to the East Coast. On Sunday in
Chapel Hill, N.C., the Cardinal
squared off against No. 1 North Car
olina, losing a close match by a single
goal. The match was followed by a win
over No. 8 Wake Forest in Winston-
Salem, N.C., on Monday afternoon.
In its toughest contest all season,
Stanford (6-3, 2-1 NorPac) hung
tough with the defending NCAA
champion Tar Heels (9-0), but ulti
mately fell in a tight contest, 2-1.
The Cardinal managed to keep
the match close through solid de
fense and a stellar performance from
junior goalkeeper Alessandra Moss.
She faced 16 shots from the Tar

Heels, including nine in the second
period, ultimately allowing only two
goals while making eight saves. She
also managed to hold off a spirited
North Carolina attack throughout
the second period, keeping the Tar
Heels off the scoreboard from the
23rd minute onward.
However, Moss' performance was
not enough to compensate for the
Cardinal's overall lack of offense.
Stanford mustered just two shots in
the game, both in the first period, and
got one goal from senior Xanthe Trav
los at the tail end of the first period.
Despite the tough loss, Stanford
had no time to recover, jumping back
in the next day for a game at Wake
Forest (6-4).
The Cardinal did not look promis
ing early on, as the Demon Deacons
notched two quick goals in the first
nine minutes. The first goal, which
came at just 1:52, was deflected into
the net off a defender's stick, while

the second goal saw Wake Forest slot
the ball through Stanford's defense
right to the front of the net, before
being powered home by Taylor
Rhea.
After that goal, however, the Car
dinal found its spark, notching four
unanswered goals to ultimately over
come the Deacons, 4-2. Stanford put
18 shots in throughout the game and
got goals from four different players
senior Camille Gandhi, junior
Stephanie Byrne, redshirt freshman
Emily Henriksson and sophomore
Katie Mitchell.
The win over Wake Forest should
give Stanford a bump in the rankings
and will also give it momentum as it
continues its NorPac schedule. The
Cardinal will play UC-Davis in
Davis, Calif., this weekend, before
taking on Harvard at home in two
weeks.
