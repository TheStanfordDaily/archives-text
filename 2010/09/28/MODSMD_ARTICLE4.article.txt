# AlcoholEdu costs weighed
## Castro, county officials discuss the methods behind AlcoholEdu's renewal, assess costs of program and alcohol-related emergencies 
### ELIZABETH ROSEN STAFF WRITER 
Although the decision has already
been made to renew funding for four
more years of the online alcohol educa
tion program AlcoholEdu, University
and county officials are still monitoring
the ramifications of the survey data that
in part bolstered the program's renewal
bid.
Stanford this year heralded Alco
holEdu as a success when it renewed the
program's funding until 2013. That "suc

cess" was part of an alcohol policy pack
age Stanford used to win an exemption
from Santa Clara County's "social host"
ordinance earlier this year. Under the or
dinance, the county fines landowners for
underage drinking that occurs on their
property.
Data from a survey of students about
AlcoholEdu released this summer indi
cate improved alcohol-related safety on
campus, but the methodology and con
clusions of the survey specifically, the
lack of a control group and debatable
causality preclude definitive interpre

tations about the program's influence.
AlcoholEdu by the numbers and
methods
The survey was developed by Ralph
Castro of the Substance Abuse Preven
tion and Policy Office and vetted by
Mickey Trockel of the psychiatry and be
havioral sciences department. It was
given to freshmen for four years during
the spring quarter after they participated
in AlcoholEdu. Of the 1,685 students
who responded, 71 percent rated Al
coholEdu as "somewhat to very effec
tive" in educating them about college
alcohol issues, and 77 percent said they
learned something useful from the
program.
In his recommendation that Stan
ford continue to fund AlcoholEdu,
Castro cited a decision-making model
developed by doctoral student in deci
sion analysis Somik Raha that quanti
fied the program's effects and value to
the University. Raha weighed the
$lB,OOO annual cost of AlcoholEdu
against the monetary values of staff re
sponse time, emergency room bills,
missed classes, litigation and public re
lations costs, as well as core values
more intrinsic to the University, like
education and student welfare.
"What we wanted to know is, can
we make decisions that honor our in
trinsic values?" Raha said.
Castro noted that alcohol-related
trips to the emergency room have
dropped at Stanford to an average of
about 60 per year from 119 in 2004-05.
According to Raha's statistical analy
ses, Stanford needs to drop to at most
59 annual "minor injuries" any
thing less than permanent incapacita
tion or death for AlcoholEdu to
make financial sense.
"There's definitely a correlation"
between AlcoholEdu and a decrease
in emergency room trips, "but there
was no randomized control trial, so we
can't draw any conclusion about
causality," Castro said.
According to Castro, the lack of a
control study is due to the survey's
original purpose, which was to obtain
feedback and assess how students felt
about AlcoholEdu and not to formal
ly evaluate the program's effective
ness. Castro noted the possible effects
of the New Student Orientation alco
hol policy, increased focus on hard-al
cohol consumption in alcohol educa
tion programs on campus and recently
implemented changes in residential

staff training regarding alcohol. He
added that although AlcoholEdu is
only one small piece of a larger pro
gram, it's the most comprehensive be
cause every single student participates
in it.

Randomized control trials spon
sored by AlcoholEdu have taken
place on a national scale and have
shown quantifiable decreases in the
negative consequences of drinking in
groups that have gone through the
program. AlcoholEdu is used by more
than 500 college and university cam
puses nationwide, according to its
website. The Stanford Alcohol Advi
sory Board spent three quarters
studying national studies in peer-re
viewed journals, Stanford data and
anecdotal data before making a for
mal recommendation to continue the
program.
"We reviewed other programs, and
they paled in comparison to Alco
holEdu's richness and depth," Castro
said. "It's not just a PowerPoint, and its
messages complement [Stanford's]."
He added that although he prefers
person-to-person education tech
niques, online education is a more ef
fective way to reach students on a
large scale.
The county perspective
Another financial motivation for
the University to invest in alcohol ed
ucation is its exemption from Santa
Clara County's "social host" drinking
ordinance, which allows the county to
impose a fine of up to $7OO on anyone
responsible for hosting underage
drinking gatherings. Stanford's contin

ued exemption from the ordinance is
contingent on the University continu
ing to promote alcohol education and
minimize alcohol-related incidents.
Santa Clara County District 5 Su
pervisor Liz Kniss said the terms of
Stanford's exemption from the drink
ing ordinance were negotiated by the
University counsel office, the Stanford
University Police Department, Castro
at Vaden and the Santa Clara County
Sheriffs Department.
Kniss cited two major stipulations
developed by the county Department
of Alcohol & Drug Services (DADS)
for maintaining the exemption. First,
all University alcohol policies and pro
grams are designed to meet the pur
pose of the ordinance and then re
viewed and approved annually by
DADS. Second, Stanford bears all
costs for annual review and alcohol-re
lated emergencies, as well as responsi
bility for the outcomes.
"They made a very strong argu
ment that they would monitor this
[and] have education in place, and that
it would be reported in a regular and
sustainable way," Kniss said. She
added that the county considers the
exemption a "big deal [and] does not
take this kind of ordinance lightly."
For the county, the success of alco
hol education at Stanford is defined in
"big picture" terms: whether or not the
University is conforming to the best
practices established at similar institu
tions, how closely University officials
adhere to their own policies, the degree
of genuine support for the programs
within the administration and student
responses to the University's efforts.
Although the county has not yet re
ceived all the data on AlcoholEdu, it
has a summary indicating that infor
mation about alcohol might lead to an
increase in responsible behavior,
which seems to be the case with self
reporting as well, Kniss said.
"It seems to me that the result of
this exemption is that Stanford has
taken underage drinking very serious
ly and has really focused on educa
tion," Kniss added.

For the county, the success of alco

"big picture" terms: whether or not the
University is conforming to the best
practices established at similar institu

adhere to their own policies, the degree
of genuine support for the programs
within the administration and student
responses to the University's efforts.
Although the county has not yet re
ceived all the data on AlcoholEdu, it
has a summary indicating that infor

increase in responsible behavior,
which seems to be the case with self
reporting as well, Kniss said.
"It seems to me that the result of
this exemption is that Stanford has
taken underage drinking very serious
ly and has really focused on educa

Although the decision has already
been made to renew funding for four
more years of the online alcohol educa
tion program AlcoholEdu, University
and county officials are still monitoring
the ramifications of the survey data that
in part bolstered the program's renewal
bid.
Stanford this year heralded Alco
holEdu as a success when it renewed the
program's funding until 2013. That "suc

cess" was part of an alcohol policy pack
age Stanford used to win an exemption
from Santa Clara County's "social host"
ordinance earlier this year. Under the or
dinance, the county fines landowners for
underage drinking that occurs on their
property.
Data from a survey of students about
AlcoholEdu released this summer indi
cate improved alcohol-related safety on
campus, but the methodology and con
clusions of the survey specifically, the
lack of a control group and debatable
causality preclude definitive interpre

tations about the program's influence.
AlcoholEdu by the numbers and
methods
The survey was developed by Ralph
Castro of the Substance Abuse Preven
tion and Policy Office and vetted by
Mickey Trockel of the psychiatry and be
havioral sciences department. It was
given to freshmen for four years during
the spring quarter after they participated
in AlcoholEdu. Of the 1,685 students
who responded, 71 percent rated Al
coholEdu as "somewhat to very effec
tive" in educating them about college
alcohol issues, and 77 percent said they
learned something useful from the
program.
In his recommendation that Stan
ford continue to fund AlcoholEdu,
Castro cited a decision-making model
developed by doctoral student in deci
sion analysis Somik Raha that quanti
fied the program's effects and value to
the University. Raha weighed the
$lB,OOO annual cost of AlcoholEdu
against the monetary values of staff re
sponse time, emergency room bills,
missed classes, litigation and public re
lations costs, as well as core values
more intrinsic to the University, like
education and student welfare.
"What we wanted to know is, can
we make decisions that honor our in
trinsic values?" Raha said.
Castro noted that alcohol-related
trips to the emergency room have
dropped at Stanford to an average of
about 60 per year from 119 in 2004-05.
According to Raha's statistical analy
ses, Stanford needs to drop to at most
59 annual "minor injuries" any
thing less than permanent incapacita
tion or death for AlcoholEdu to
make financial sense.
"There's definitely a correlation"
between AlcoholEdu and a decrease
in emergency room trips, "but there
was no randomized control trial, so we
can't draw any conclusion about
causality," Castro said.
According to Castro, the lack of a
control study is due to the survey's
original purpose, which was to obtain
feedback and assess how students felt
about AlcoholEdu and not to formal
ly evaluate the program's effective
ness. Castro noted the possible effects
of the New Student Orientation alco
hol policy, increased focus on hard-al
cohol consumption in alcohol educa
tion programs on campus and recently
implemented changes in residential

staff training regarding alcohol. He
added that although AlcoholEdu is
only one small piece of a larger pro
gram, it's the most comprehensive be
cause every single student participates
in it.

Randomized control trials spon
sored by AlcoholEdu have taken
place on a national scale and have
shown quantifiable decreases in the
negative consequences of drinking in
groups that have gone through the
program. AlcoholEdu is used by more
than 500 college and university cam
puses nationwide, according to its
website. The Stanford Alcohol Advi
sory Board spent three quarters
studying national studies in peer-re
viewed journals, Stanford data and
anecdotal data before making a for
mal recommendation to continue the
program.
"We reviewed other programs, and
they paled in comparison to Alco
holEdu's richness and depth," Castro
said. "It's not just a PowerPoint, and its
messages complement [Stanford's]."
He added that although he prefers
person-to-person education tech
niques, online education is a more ef
fective way to reach students on a
large scale.
The county perspective
Another financial motivation for
the University to invest in alcohol ed
ucation is its exemption from Santa
Clara County's "social host" drinking
ordinance, which allows the county to
impose a fine of up to $7OO on anyone
responsible for hosting underage
drinking gatherings. Stanford's contin

ued exemption from the ordinance is
contingent on the University continu
ing to promote alcohol education and
minimize alcohol-related incidents.
Santa Clara County District 5 Su
pervisor Liz Kniss said the terms of
Stanford's exemption from the drink
ing ordinance were negotiated by the
University counsel office, the Stanford
University Police Department, Castro
at Vaden and the Santa Clara County
Sheriffs Department.
Kniss cited two major stipulations
developed by the county Department
of Alcohol & Drug Services (DADS)
for maintaining the exemption. First,
all University alcohol policies and pro
grams are designed to meet the pur
pose of the ordinance and then re
viewed and approved annually by
DADS. Second, Stanford bears all
costs for annual review and alcohol-re
lated emergencies, as well as responsi
bility for the outcomes.
"They made a very strong argu
ment that they would monitor this
[and] have education in place, and that
it would be reported in a regular and
sustainable way," Kniss said. She
added that the county considers the
exemption a "big deal [and] does not
take this kind of ordinance lightly."
For the county, the success of alco
hol education at Stanford is defined in
"big picture" terms: whether or not the
University is conforming to the best
practices established at similar institu
tions, how closely University officials
adhere to their own policies, the degree
of genuine support for the programs
within the administration and student
responses to the University's efforts.
Although the county has not yet re

which seems to be the case with self
reporting as well, Kniss said.
"It seems to me that the result of
