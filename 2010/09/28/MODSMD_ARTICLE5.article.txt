## Stanford endowment recovers slightly to $13.8 billion 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Devin Banerjee 
Stanford's endowment grew 9.6
percent to $13.8 billion for the year
ending Aug. 31, 2010, the University
said Monday. Its merged pool, which
includes most of the endowment,
took a nearly 25.6 percent hit the year
before, ending June 30,2009.
Return on the pool's investment
for the year ending June 30,2010 was
14.4 percent, according to Stanford
Management Company. On an annu
alized basis, the pool has yielded a re
turn of 6.9 percent since 2000, outpac
ing the U.S. equity market, which
slipped an average of 1.6 percent per
year, as well as the U.S. bond market,
which grew 6.5 percent per year.
"Our investment managers took
advantage of strong equity and credit
markets through the first three quar
ters of the fiscal year, allowing us to
make up some of the ground lost in
fiscal 2009," said John Powers, Stan
ford Management Company's chief
executive, in a statement.
Still, Stanford's endowment re
mains $3.4 billion, or 20 percent,
smaller than it was two years ago. The
University responded to the impend
ing recession by cutting budgets
across its schools and smoothing the
endowment's payout formula in
order to retain funds.
"We made the difficult budget
adjustments that are enabling the
university to continue operating
smoothly with less annual payout
from the endowment," said Randy
Livingston, Stanford's chief financial
officer, in the statement.
In fiscal year 2010, Stanford re
duced individual endowment fund
payouts by 10 percent, then in
FY2OII by another 15 percent. The
budgeted payout for this fiscal year
is $758 million, or 5.5 percent of the
endowment's beginning-of-year
value.
