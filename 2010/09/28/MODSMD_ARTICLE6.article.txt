## Obama talks education and the economy Obama discusses policies with college-age journalists 
### DEVIN BANERJEE SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
President Obama devoted the first half of
his Monday to talking about his vision for the
future of education in America, first on
NBC's Today Show and later on a conference
call from the Oval Office with a group of col
lege journalists.
In a wide-ranging conversation on educa
tion, health care, the economy and occasion
ally college football, Obama told The Daily
and other publications on the call that the
current generation of students in America
will emerge from the economic downturn
with job opportunities and the chance to
build for themselves a "great" generation.
"If you think about it, what we called the
greatest generation, my grandparents' gener
ation, they had a situation where unemploy
ment reached 30 percent," the president said,
"and they ended up essentially building the
entire American middle class to what it was
and making this the most powerful economy
in the world."
But it's not that easy. The United States
ranks 12th in college graduation rates, and the

economic downturn has only made it more
difficult for students to pay for higher educa
tion. Obama said his administration is taking
steps to make college more affordable.
"The single most important step we can
take is to make sure that every young person
gets the best education possible," he said, "be
cause countries that out-educate us today are
going to out-compete us tomorrow."
The president said more than $6O billion in
federal loan subsidies is being redirected to

support community colleges and eight mil
lion students. Also, he said, the administration
is tripling the investment in college tax cred
its for middle-class families.
The president repeatedly touted his recent
health care bill, the Affordable Care Act,
which allows people to stay on their parents'
health plans until age 26. "And that obviously
provides relief to a lot of young people who

are looking maybe at their first job
not providing health insurance," he
said.
At the same time, Obama urged
universities to disclose how students'
tuitions are spent so that students
may "have some good understand
ing" of the use of their payments.
"There should be a pie chart at every
university that says, out of every dol
lar you spend in tuition, here's where
your money is going," Obama said.
Calling the Senate's failure last
week to pass the DREAM Act a "set
back," the president emphasized his
administration's backing of the bill,
which would grant permanent resi
dency to undocumented immigrants
who came to the United States as chil
dren and wish to pursue higher edu
cation or service in the American
armed forces.
"Their parents brought them
here," Obama said of young undoc
umented immigrants. "They may
not have been documented, but
they have, for all intents and pur
poses, grown up as American young

people."
Responding to questions about
health care costs and rising tuition,
Obama continually referred back to
the strength of the economy as his ad
ministration's number-one priority.
"One of the things that I can do to
help is to make sure that the economy
is growing," he said. "States then are
taking in more tax revenue ... then
they don't have to try to pass on in
creased costs to students because
they can maintain levels of support to
institutions of higher learning."

The president plans to hold a rally
today at the University of Wisconsin
in Madison to mobilize young voters
before the November elections in a
battleground state he won handily in
November 2008.
"I love Madison because when I
was just out of college ... I used to
drive up there and have fun times,"
Obama said, "which I can't discuss in
detail with you."
