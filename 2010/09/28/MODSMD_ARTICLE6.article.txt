President Obama devoted the first half of
his Monday to talking about his vision for the
future of education in America, first on
NBC's Today Show and later on a conference
call from the Oval Office with a group of col

is tripling the investment in college tax cred

The president repeatedly touted his recent
health care bill, the Affordable Care Act,
which allows people to stay on their parents'
