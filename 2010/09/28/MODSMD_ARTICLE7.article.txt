## Printing fee loophole now closed Students can no longer cancel print jobs to avoid paying 
### ANNA SCHUESSLER 
Following a restructuring of the University's
printing system, students are no longer able to
cancel print jobs, whether they seek to cancel a
botched job or are just looking to print for free.
In the past, students looking to minimize
printing costs could cancel print jobs on Univer
sity printers at the last second, skirting the $O.lO
per page printing fee. But in response to the in
creasingly frequent use of the loophole first ac
knowledged by the University last spring, Stan
ford Academic Computing Services has now dis
allowed the canceling of any print jobs that have
begun printing in library or computer cluster
printers.
Designed to allow students to cancel print jobs
with bad print feeds or streaky toner, the old
printing system did not charge students for their
print jobs if they canceled them before printing
was complete. But staff in Academic Computing
Services became suspicious that students were
abusing this feature of the print system after they
noticed a high number of canceled print jobs last
year.
"Unfortunately, some students began taking
advantage of this [feature] to cancel jobs after
they had begun printing, merely to avoid being
charged, even though there was nothing wrong
with the printouts," wrote head of Academic
Computing Technology Services Surajit Bose in

an e-mail to The Daily.
One student canceled 52 print
jobs and another six students can
celed more than 20 print jobs each
in March, Bose told The Daily in
April.
After some consultation with
residential computing consultants
(RCCs), Academic Computing Ser
vices decided something had to be
done. Bose said Academic Comput
ing Services chose to forego the
cancel option when configuring this
year's system in light of the abuses.
"This means, sadly, that students
who do experience streaky toner,
torn paper or other such problems
will have to contact their RCCs or
library staff to initiate a refund for
damaged jobs," Bose said. He re
ported that SULAIR has processed
fewer than five refunds this aca
demic year.
Word about the tighter policy
has been getting around. After a
question was raised during a discus
sion at RCC training this fall, RCCs
were instructed to tell their resi
dents it would no longer be possible
to cancel print jobs.
"One of the people leading the
discussion [during RCC training]
said we should tell people that they
can't do that," said Durand RCC
Chris Anderson 'll.
