## CROSS-CONTINENTAL MARAIHON 
### JESSICA WERTHEIM STAFF WRITER 
Meet Travis Kiefer '11:
He runs. A lot. In
fact, he is in the midst
of running a
marathon on every
continent, in an effort to foster
awareness for poverty alleviation
through social entrepreneurship.
So far, Kiefer's marathons have
taken him to: Cork, Ireland; Rosario,
Argentina; San Francisco, Calif, and
most recently, Victoria Falls, Zimbab
we. But he is far from finished. He has
plans to complete marathons in
Japan and Australia and finish off on
Dec. 12 of this year by running the
Antarctica Ice Marathon, which he
will train for by setting up a treadmill
in a meat locker.
Kiefer is currently the executive
director of Gumball Capital, a non
profit organization that challenges
students to combat poverty through
entrepreneurship. The Gumball
Challenge (which will take place on
Stanford's campus on Nov. 15) is a
microfinance benefit competition,
beginning by giving students $27,27
gumballs and one week to create
value.
According to Kiefer, the return
is at least twice as much as the initial
loans. All of the student-raised
money from Gumball Capital goes
directly to provide aid to the work
ing poor.

"Social entrepreneurship is not
simply about making money,"
Kiefer said. "It's about finding inno
vative ways to help people improve
their quality of life despite a lack of
resources or constraints on what
they are able to do."
Kiefer thought up the ambitious
project winter quarter of his junior
year. He went for a run one day,
then the next and then the day after
that all the while keeping Twitter
updated of his mileage.
"On the third day of consecutive
running, a friend of mine said on my
Twitter profile he would give a five
dollar donation to the organization
of my choice for every day I ran,"
Kiefer said.
And so it began.
At first, he wanted to log 500
miles in 50 days in order to raise 250
dollars, but according to Kiefer,
"Five-hundred miles is cool, but I
wanted to up the stakes, so I decid
ed to run a marathon. I started out
running four miles a day, adding two
miles a day each week until I was in
marathon shape,"
Kiefer ran his first marathon
while he was studying abroad in Ox
ford spring quarter of his junior
year. Continent number one. He
later went to visit a friend in Ar
gentina. Continent number two.
For Kiefer, "Running a
marathon symbolizes the globaliza
tion and interconnectedness of the
world no matter where I go there
are people who run," he said. "Also,

I believe social entrepreneurship is
best symbolized by the training re
quired to run a marathon. Both take
work, effort and a lot of self-sacri
fice and self-discipline. Similarly,
you can't just get up one day and
run a marathon. Becoming an
overnight success takes years and
years of hard work."
The marathon has also given
Kiefer an opportunity to see much of
the world on foot. His most recent
marathon took place in Zimbabwe.
"It was absolutely beautiful!" he
exclaimed. "I saw Victoria Falls at
dawn and baboons alongside the
road. The scenery was an incredible
motivator."
However, the people he met
while traveling most affected
Kiefer: other runners, those who
cheered on the sidelines and the
people native to Zimbabwe.
"I was able to experience first
hand the poverty situation," he said.
"But I was most surprised by how
similar people's stories were. Every
one is working hard to put food on
the table; they are working for the
hope of a better future."
Kiefer hopes to raise $125,000
for Gumball Capital within the next
year and to inspire others to get in
volved in social entrepreneurship.
"I want to make a difference," he
said. "And I see entrepreneurship as
the way to do that."
