## EDITORIAL Bring ROTC back to campus 
### 
From the wide-ranging commitments of
the Haas Center to the variety of ta
bles at the activities fair on Friday,
Stanford prides itself on an unwavering
commitment to service. It holds a special es
teem in our community, yet conspicuously
absent from the view is service of a particu
lar kind: that of the men and women serving
the nation in the military. In 2010, almost
four decades after the removal of Reserve
Officer Training Corps (ROTC) on campus,
the University still does not allow the pro
gram to maintain a presence on campus or
offer academic credit for its courses.
Originally enacted in the latter stages of
the Vietnam War, the ban is currently justi
fied as a protest against the military's "don't
ask, don't tell" (DADT) policy banning
openly gay service people. A committee of
the Faculty Senate began considering in
March the idea of reinstating ROTC on
campus. Some at Stanford, however, have in
dicated that a repeal of DADT might be a
prerequisite to reinstating the program.
The editorial board supports the Univer
sity's intentions in defending the rights of
the LGBT community, but believes these
concerns should be part of a broader dis
course on the matter. To be sure, the mili
tary's mandated exclusion of certain groups
based on their sexuality constitutes an egre
gious violation of civil rights. To the extent
that excluding ROTC from certain universi
ties publicizes this discrimination or exerts
political pressure in opposition, it is benefi
cial to the military and the nation. But hold
ing ROTC hostage to the potential repeal of
the policy, which has floundered in Congress
despite widespread support from political
and military leadership, only empowers a
political failure to cause two detrimental
outcomes instead of one. Delaying the re
turn of ROTC just adds to the damage done
by DADT.
The most direct impact of the ROTC ban

falls on the handful of dedicated Stanford
students who have chosen to enlist anyway,
making the commute to Berkeley, Santa
Clara or San Jose for their service. ITie extra
effort these students must make to partici
pate in these off-campus programs and the
constraints to their course scheduling, exac
erbated by the lack of ROTC academic
credit, are unacceptable. Even more so is the
snub these students receive from a universi
ty that pays their activities no official regard.
Stanford owes these students as well as
those who might have chosen to serve had
the opportunities been more available its
fullest support.
It is not just those students who suffer
from the exclusion of ROTC. All Stanford
students do. If diversity is part of the Univer
sity's mission, exposure to the military ought
to be a valued element. If the University
aims to educate future leaders, students
must have the opportunity to understand
and interact with those who commit them
selves to defending our nation. We must
strive to avoid a world where the people
fighting our wars are disconnected from
those who decide to start them. Further
more, the forced separation of our armed
forces from top universities only intensifies
the socioeconomic and educational inequal
ities that already pervade military demo
graphics.
All this leads to one point that should go
without saying: soldiers don't cause wars.
They only suffer the consequences.
Whether or not we approve of any given
conflict, we as a society must hold our armed
forces in the highest esteem. Most Stanford
students would likely support this idea in
theory, but the University and its students
must make sure they also do so in practice. It
is time for Stanford to do the right thing and
send the right message by allowing the
ROTC back on campus.
