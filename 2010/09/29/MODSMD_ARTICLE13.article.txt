## Sometimes, SHPRC, You're Only Making It Harder 
### Peter McDonald 
By now, after its colorful displays in the
activities fair and its omnipresence at
dorm meetings, the Sexual Health
Peer Resource Center (SHPRC) and all its
colorful sexual accoutrements should be in
timately familiar to all of you kids. Its insti
tutionally supported, lighthearted and cre
ative approach to a controversial subject
like sex education really helps break down
the vestigial societal barriers that hold us
back from having open and honest conver
sations about sexuality in today's society.
There's a disconnect, though, because
SHPRC is still vastly underutilized by large
subsections of the student body. The center
is struggling to reach out to them, and I
think I can offer an insight. The thing is,
SHPRC, in order to take advantage of your
lovely 12 free condoms, or exchange them
for lube and cock rings, someone has to want
to have sex with you first. Quite the curious,
and maddening, dilemma.
For just how many fellas and ladies and
genderqueer folk am I speakin' right now?
Judging by the frequency of limericks sent
to the Band's e-mail list, the level of entan
glement on its hookup map, the number of
high-pitched squeals I hear through the all
too-thin walls of Chi Theta Chi, and the ag
gregate two high school girlfriends in my
Roble freshman quad: enough.
So what gives, Stanford? Well, part of the
problem is our obsession with time manage
ment. No one puts "Bonetown, 2-4" in their
GCal, and everyone here knows that if you
don't make something a priority, it won't get
done, which is why at the end of the night,
people end up claiming they're too tired to
perform their primary biological function, a
particularly cutting rejection considering
the number of "distracted by Facebook, sup
posed to be working"-type status updates I
see at 1:30 a.m. on a regular basis.
Then there's that other ghastly business
that holds us back from realizing our sexu
al potential: that whole rape thing, which
turns an affirmation of life into a destroyer
of spirits and can make girls afraid to be
sexually open. And they're kind of a neces
sary part in the equation for total sexual lib
eration.
Dudes, let's talk. I read a study on Jezebel
last November that said that 6 percent of
male college students have admitted to rape
or attempted rape, which means the capaci
ty to rape is present in a lot more of us than
we'd probably like to admit. I'm especially
talking to you guys who think you're the
nicest dude on the planet and are incapable
of ever making a woman uncomfortable.

Some introspection might help before your
next round of creeping, because it really is
not helping the rest of us.
And ladies, I've got a few words for you as
well. Don't worry. I'm not going to tell you to
make sure you're not leading guys on or any
thing like that. Two years in Men Against
Abuse Now have taught me there really,
truly, is nothing you can do to "ask for it."
No, the main issue I have is that most of
the anti-sexual assault literature on campus
seems to ascribe no sexual agency to
women, assuming you're all Disney charac
ters who have no idea what a guy is really
after when he invites you to his room. In
deed, following a guy to his room is not an
invitation for rape. (It is an invitation for a
few awkward moments, and with the excep
tion of a rare species of turtle, no one likes
awkward moments.) Though I would never
do anything as intellectually cavalier as
blame women for the presence of misogyny,
I will say that rejection after a night of flirt
ing is bound to cause some frustration on
the guy's end, no matter how many feminist
studies courses he's taken. Honestly, you
should take it as a compliment.
So buck up, you guys, because after all,
Stanford is a pretty unique sexual land
scape. We've got hundreds of the fittest peo
ple on the planet, but they have to compete
for attention with the tech start-up whizzes.
The co-ops are as much a bastion for hipsters
as they are for hippies. And College Prowler
be damned, we are some attractive people.
There is no reason why any of you shouldn't
go through all 12 of your free condoms by
week five and then empty out Tres-Ex by the
end of the quarter. Sex is a pretty good study
break.
When has Stanford ever been about ac
cepting the status quo? Don't be afraid of
your sexuality, and don't be afraid to ask for
anything you want from another person. Just
remember to ask first. Get off your seat and
out of them pants and start a revolution!
