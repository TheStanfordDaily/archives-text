# LOOKING UP
## This Is Not My Runway 
### Nina M. Chung 
I strut. And violently swing my right arm,
according to my dad. That's a part of strut
ting, right? And last week, driving home
from a nearby auto body shop in my now
dent-free bright red coupe, I surely felt invin
cible, (Boris Grishenko in "Golden Rye" prior
to death by liquid nitrogen: "I am invinci
ble!!!") I was essentially drive strutting. My
dazzling almost-toy car and I were blasting
Bellatrax dance mixes really loudly ...
Until I realized that this was an exact re
play of the moments before my first mortify
ingly slow-motion accident four years ago.
I spent the rest of the drive intentionally
toning myself down. Literally within minutes
of leaving the shop, my mental state had re
versed a generous 180 degrees. My psycho
logical mini-revolution stayed in my head
and within my car, so no exterior signs re
vealed me i.e. my driving didn't change
(still a bit too fast, maybe). But my eyes start
ed darting around suspiciously as I became
hyper-conscious of all potential vehicular in
cidents. Written down, that sounds abnormal.
My life thus far, though, has made me enter
tainingly speculative about unexpected fu
ture events, especially when one takes some
thing for granted.
No accidents occurred and I was genuine
ly grateful when I got back to the dorm. (It's
easy to forget how the best day is sometimes
just the simple, disaster-free one.) I remem
bered what my mom half-jokingly told me a
couple years ago, after borrowing my car for
an errand. The gist: a) it's fun to drive that
new little car, and b) take care to stay a bit
modest while inside. And, like most of the

lines stored in my Mom Quote Reservoir, its
truth-value has aged superbly.
To be honest, my biggest fear has always
been my ego. Okay, fine, not true: At one
point it was my little brother finding my diary
(which ultimately resulted in a lost one that's
probably under a hotel mattress in another
country). But once I learned what the enig
matic "ego" was, I did become quite afraid of
mine and for good reason: There are a lot
of things I am proud of. It's pure vanity be
cause they're normally things I had no hand
in creating and am lucky to have seen or felt
at all. Unfortunately, the awareness itself is
no panacea. My contract with pride is still rid
dled with the small print of embarrassing and
humbling experiences.
There's a line between self-affirming con
fidence and self-loving pride. I don't know its
width, but it's pretty solid. One is a bit more
reckless and simple than the other. It exists
for the sake of existing. It's the relaxed pose
we wear in front of certain people. It's our se
cret passions we hide from our friends to
keep an image. It's that signature, seemingly
nonchalant phrase we drop in conversation

the one that used to be true but now re
quires work to maintain. They're mysterious
or misleading, pretending that something we
really take to heart is just, like, you know,
whatever. "Yeah, I didn't know anything
about college until, like, sophomore year, ha
haha," I used to say. Is it totally true? I can't
remember. But, given my ethnicity and the
stereotypes around it, it was a casual remark
I'd throw out to represent a world of other re
lated concepts about my past and identity. I
was really proud of it, so I wrapped it in a lit
tle prepackaged phrase. This past week, I re
alized I have more of those repeat offender
one-liners than I'd like.

It's strange to think about the mantras we
say and act out to other people. On the sur
face it's all unrehearsed, easy, background.
Often, however, they're non-realities of
which we're convincing ourselves. But why is
this rocky terrain? Because if we proclaim too
many self-indulgent slogans, we start publiciz
ing somebody we don't even know. That's a
kind of insecurity I really want to avoid.
The best people I know and love lack the
self-written signs hanging around their
necks. Rather, they walk and talk and live
without proving anything except the fact that
they don't need to. I'm taking a page out of
their book, which means throwing away the
one filled with pretty self-descriptions. And
the self-aware strut? Definitely taking steps
to remove it.
