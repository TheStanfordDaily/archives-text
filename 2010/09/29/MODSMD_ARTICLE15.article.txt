Bravo to whoever put piano
in plaza

Dear Editor:
Yesterday an old dilapidated piano mys
teriously appeared in White Plaza with a sign
encouraging students to make the arts "in
escapable" at Stanford. The Daily erroneous
ly attributed this to the Stanford Institute for
Creativity and the Arts. Although we at
SICA cannot claim responsibility, I applaud
those who had the creative urge to turn a ver
itable piece of junk into an instant public
music-maker.

You brightened the day of many and sent
a wonderful message to your fellow students.
Spontaneous creative events like this reflect
the spirit of the arts initiative at Stanford. I
applaud the students who put it there and
hope that it remains for a while longer (or
better yet, moves around to random loca
tions on campus).
Ed. note:please see correction, page 3.
