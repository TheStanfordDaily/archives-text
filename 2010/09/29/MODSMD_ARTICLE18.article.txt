## Cal to cut five varsity teams Cost-cutting takes baseball, gymnastics 
### CAROLINE CASELLI KABIR SAWHNEY 
In a press conference on Tuesday,
UC-Berkeley Chancellor Robert Bir
geneau and Athletic Director Sandy
Barbour announced that California
will eliminate five of its varsity athlet
ic teams in an effort to maintain a fi
nancially sustainable athletic program
committed to excellence.
The affected teams baseball,
men's and women's gymnastics,
women's lacrosse and men's rugby
will cease to represent Cal in intercol
legiate competition at the end of this
academic year. The Cal athletic pro
gram will be reduced from 29 teams to
24; by comparison, Stanford currently
has 35 varsity teams, and Pac-10 oppo
nents UCLA and Washington have 24
and 21 teams, respectively.
This reduction will impact 163 stu
dent-athletes and 13 full-time coaches.
The Cal athletics department will
honor current scholarships for the af
fected student-athletes who choose to
stay at UC-Berkeley and continue
pursuing their degrees.
The rugby team, currently the only
varsity rugby program in the country,

has been a perennial national power
house, winning 25 national champi
onships since 1980. Unlike the other
four teams, rugby will be transitioned
to a varsity club sport, meaning it will
still have access to training facilities,
sports medicine and admissions bene
fits however, Cal will cease funding
the team.
In a letter to the UC-Berkeley com
munity, Birgeneau and Barbour out
lined the rationale for the decision,
with financial concerns at the top of
the list.
"The status quo is simply unsustain
able," they wrote. "Given the econom
ic environment, the campus cannot
continue to provide Cal Athletics with
recent levels of annual financial sup
port that exceeded $l2 million during
the last fiscal year. After an exhaustive
consideration of every reasonable op
tion, it became clear to us that the only
credible way to balance our twin ob
jectives of financial sustainability and
continued excellence is through a re
duction in the program's scope, along
with new steps to contain costs and in
crease revenues."
The proposed plan will save Cal an
estimated $4 million.
While Cal is struggling to fully fund
its athletics program, the expansive
Stanford athletics program remains
on solid financial footing. Stanford
Athletics is an auxiliary unit of the
University, running independently on
the revenues that it generates. The

program did operate at losses in both
2009 and 2010, but is projected to re
turn to the black this year as payouts
from its independent endowment re
turn to normal levels.

Over the last two years, Stanford
Athletics also made numerous cuts to
ensure that it would be able to retain
all of its varsity sports. It eliminated
staff positions, froze salaries and im
plemented budgetary cuts in order to
remain solvent. The only potential ca
sualty was the fencing team, which was
forced to raise $250,000 on its own to
remain a varsity sport.
In the medium-term, Stanford is
also expected to receive significant
revenue boosts from the renegotia
tion of the Pac-10 Conference's media
contracts at the end of this year. With
the addition of Colorado and Utah,
the new Pac-12 is expected to pay out
much more to member schools after
the contracts are signed, which should
help Stanford to plug any remaining
budgetary gaps.
From a competition perspective,
Stanford figures to be affected the
most by the elimination of Cal's gym
nastics programs. The Golden Bears
are the only significant rivals to the
Cardinal on the West Coast, especially
on the men's side the men's gym
nastics team is scheduled to square off
against Cal four times this season.
