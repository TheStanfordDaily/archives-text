### Trent Edwards signed by NFL's Jacksonville Jaguars â€” Zach Zimmerman 
Former Stanford quarterback
Trent Edwards 'O7 was picked up by
the Jacksonville Jaguars Tuesday, just
one day after being released by the
Buffalo Bills.
Edwards' NFL tenure has been in
consistent at best. After being named
the third-best quarterback in the
2007 NFL Draft by ESPN's Mel
Kiper, Jr., the Bills drafted Edwards
in the third round. After then-starter
J.P. Losman went down with an in
jury, Edwards made his first career
start just three games into his rookie
season. His performance earned him
a selection on the 2007 NFL All-
Rookie Team.
However, injuries plagued him
over the next few seasons. In recent
years he has battled Ryan Fitzpatrick
for the starting position in Buffalo.
Edwards was named the starter for
the 2010 season, but was benched in
favor of Fitzpatrick last week after
the Bills started 0-2. He was cut by the
Bills on Tuesday after throwing for
just 241 yards with one touchdown
and two interceptions in two games.
The Jacksonville Jaguars, who
have quarterback problems of their
own with current starter David Gar
rard, were quick to claim Edwards
off waivers. He will immediately
enter the role as Garrard's primary
backup and, depending on Garrard's
play, has the potential to regain a
starting position.
Stanford fans will remember Ed
wards as the starting quarterback
during the infamous 2006 season. Ed
wards started seven games of the 1-11
campaign for the Cardinal before get
ting injured, ending his Stanford ca
reer on a low note. He was also the last
starting quarterback of the Walt Har
ris era, leaving for the NFL before
current head coach Jim Harbaugh
took the position in 2007.
Edwards has started in 32 games in
just over three seasons of NFL play.
He has thrown for 5,739 yards, 23
touchdowns and 25 interceptions. He
carries a career passer rating of 76.8.
