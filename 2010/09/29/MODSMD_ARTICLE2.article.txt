## Genetics prof wins 'genius' fellowship Bustamante wins MacArthur grant for research in human genetics 
### IVY NGUYEN DESK EDITOR 
Genetics Prof. Carlos Bustamante, a newcomer to the
University, has been named a 2010 Mac Arthur Fellow for
his work in analyzing the patterns of DNA variation among
populations to understand both evolutionary processes
and the genetic basis of complex traits in humans, dogs,
plants and pathogens. The $500,000 awards granted to Bus
tamante and 22 other winners will be given over five years
for recipients to use however they see fit.
The Mac Arthur Fellowship, also known as the "genius
grant," is a "no-strings-attached" award intended to stimu
late creativity and progress. Fellows are chosen each year
by an anonymous group that submits its recommendations
to another anonymous selection committee. The commit
tee then chooses 20 to 40 individuals in fields from science
and education to art and social activism.
Having only received the news last week, Bustamante
has not finalized his plans on how to spend the funds. One
of his pet projects is expanding his study on medical and
agricultural genomics in the Americas, a labor- and money-

intensive project that the award
could fund. Bustamante said he also
would like to expand work on com
paring the genomes of individuals in
the Americas with and without dis

ease, a task that is especially interest
ing to him because of these individu
als' "rich ancestry" of Native Ameri
can, West African and European
backgrounds.
"We have many projects that
have been on the backburner that we
can now bring to the forefront," he
told The Daily. "It's not every day
that you receive funds that allow you
to take your research in any direc

tion you want to go."
Of these projects, Bustamante is
most passionate about translating
what he finds in his genetic studies
into practical applications in agricul
ture and medicine in the Americas.
"I believe that genomics can play
a key role in the development plans
for developing countries," Busta
mante said. "If we can understand
how genetic variation impacts traits

in peoples, plants and pathogens as
well as the role that diverse evolu
tionary forces have played, we are
closer to realizing the promises of ge
nomics to improve people's lives."
Bustamante arrived at Stanford
in January 2010 and was previously a
researcher at Cornell University.
