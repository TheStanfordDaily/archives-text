# Red Zone cap sends message that students don't matter
## 
### Kabir Sawhney 
As a Stanford student and an avid
follower of our athletic program, I
have always been proud of the
fact that the University makes it
incredibly easy for students to at
tend all of its home sporting events for free, with
the sole exception of men's basketball. Even
football, which has risen to the status of Pac-10
contender, is totally free to all students.
When I tell that little factoid to friends who at
tend other universities, most are shocked that
such a prominent program would simply allow
all students to enter. Many other colleges insti
tute quotas or other restrictions that prevent stu
dents from watching their classmates on the field
at some schools, students have to win a lottery
just for the right to buy their tickets. At some
places, it can be even more extreme for exam
ple, at Duke, students will camp outside of the

ticket office the night before basketball tickets go
on sale (this is not only considered acceptable,
but is a rite of passage).
So, when the announcement emerged last
week that Stanford will cap the number of stu
dents in the Red Zone for next weekends game
against USC, I was both shocked and disgusted.
The University's line of thinking seemed to go
somewhat like this: "Well, we've got a decent
team now. Time to start screwing over the stu
dents!"
The system Stanford has set up will involve
students "buying" tickets to the Red Zone for
$O.OO, which they will then need to get into Stan
ford Stadium on Oct. 9. After 4,500 of these tick
ets are distributed, the athletic department will
shut down the site and prevent anyone else from
getting a ticket.
Admittedly, Stanford isn't making the stu
dents pay for their seats, which I suppose is still
better than the systems that prevail at many
other institutions. However, there is a reason that
students have not had to pay up to this point:
Stanford is by far the smallest institution in the

Pac-10 Conference and one of the smaller BCS
conference schools in the country. If the athletic
department were to charge for admission, many
students would simply stay away. Stanford Stadi
um's Red Zone is already the smallest fan section
in the Pac-10; some schools fit more students in
their sections than are enrolled at Stanford.
At this point, some might be quick to say that
Stanford has had this system in place to control
the number of students at the Big Game with the
Red Zone loyalty points system. To be totally
honest, I don't really mind the system. Unlike the
system for the USC game, which is merely first
come, first-serve, the points system rewards those
who come to every game in the season with a
ticket to the Big Game, giving students incentive
to come to as many games as possible and ensur
ing that the student section is always full. Of
course, for years like this one when the Big Game
is in Berkeley, Stanford necessarily has to ration
student tickets, and it makes sense to give them to
those who attend all the games leading up to it.
The real reason for my outrage at this deci
sion is not necessarily the cap in and of itself

there are physical limitations on the allotted sta
dium section (which hasn't changed) and safety
concerns. I am angry that this announcement
comes swiftly on the heels of Stanford's football
program's return to national relevance. While I
started on the Farm last year, there are students
here who endured a string of losing seasons,
who were asked to wear the slogan "I believe in
Stanford football" and who were given the
promise that we would one day become a factor
in the conference and in the country again.
That day has arrived, and yet those who be
lieved in Stanford football are now being told
that they're not as important as the fair-weather
fans who suddenly find our matchup against a
sanctions-hit USC team a must-see, and who
have the means to buy a ticket to the game.
College athletics is fundamentally about the
students both those who are playing in the
games and those in the stands cheering them on.
Stanford may be a small school, but its students
are just as passionate and dedicated to its athlet
ic teams as any other university in the country. Is
this message that its students are less impor

tant because, unlike fans, they've already forked
over significant sums of cash really what an
academic institution like Stanford should be
broadcasting?
More broadly, I'm afraid that this could be the
first step on a slippery slope for the Stanford ath
letics program. Unlike many other schools, like
USC, that focus heavily on football and men's
basketball, Stanford has a broad-based athletic
program, with over 30 varsity teams. The Univer
sity might quickly forget that all of its athletics
programs exist (ideally, anyway) for the students,
and start cutting programs or shifting more atten
tion and revenue to the football team. Stanford's
rise to national prominence on the gridiron has
been a wonderful thing for everyone here on the
Farm, but if it comes at the price of alienating and
shafting the students, I fear that we will have sac
rificed more than we have gained.

Kabir Sawhney is protesting the changes by
boycotting the games. Unfortunately, this may
be counterintuitive. Let him know there's hope
