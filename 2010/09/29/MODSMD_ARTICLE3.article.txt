# SUES committees convene this week
## Groups are set to evaluate Stanford undergraduate curriculum in major review 
### TYLER BROWN DESK EDITOR 
The Study of Undergraduate Educa
tion at Stanford (SUES) moves forward
with its review of the University's under
graduate curriculum this week as the
study's subcommittees assemble for the
first time.
The subcommittees, which each draw
approximately ten members from facul
ty, students and staff, are set to review
broad topics including the freshman ex
perience, residential education, co-cur
ricular activities and academic breadth.
Committees will define their individual
focus areas in coming weeks.
At least initially, however, no sub
committees will be dedicated to studying
specific programs such as Introduction
to the Humanities (IHUM) or the Pro
gram in Writing and Rhetoric (PWR).
"We didn't think that would be the
most valuable way to start," said biology
professor and SUES co-chair Sue Mc-
Connell. McConnell replaced drama
professor Harry Elam as co-chair in June
after Elam was named vice provost for
undergraduate education.
"We're looking much more broadly at
student life and student experience,"
McConnell said. "How do residential
and co-curricular experiences, overseas
experiences play in to student life and
learning? What's the optimal way for
students to get breadth in their educa

tion without compromising their ma
jors?"
One of the most often vilified aspects
of undergraduate experiences is IHUM,
required of all freshmen who do not en
roll in the smaller Structured Liberal Ed
ucation (SLE) program.
"I think if people were genuinely in
terested in English they would seek it
out on their own," said Tuong Phan 'll.
"They already have their humanities re
quirement, so why do they need
IHUM?"
"It's not news that a lot of students are
dissatisfied with their freshman require
ments," history professor and SUES co
chair James Campbell Ph.D. 'B9 said. "It's
clear to us that a lot of existing require
ments, both the breadth requirements
and the education for citizenship require
ments, are satisfied by students in the
most cynical ways imaginable."
"People try to cherry-pick courses
that double count, or are easy As, or they
choose based simply on the hour that it
meets and so forth," Campbell contin
ued. "Some of this is inevitable. It hap
pens at every university."
Aside from reevaluating the existing
graduation requirements, SUES is work
ing to keep the Stanford curriculum rel
evant to an ever-evolving world.
"Part of what we've been trying to do
is try to not get snared so much in evalu
ating existing programs but to try to
think broadly and creatively about what

about university education at an institu
tion like Stanford is supposed to mean in
the 21st century," Campbell said.
Campbell cites a "perennial tradeoff"
between giving students the freedom to
choose their own paths and offering the

"institution's wisdom and perception."
"I think it's fair to say there's a com
mon view that the freshman year is ex
traordinarily densely packed," Mc-

Connell said. "And it's causing prob
lems for freshmen in exploring pos
sible majors. So the idea that there
would be an increase in require
ments for freshman year is incom
prehensible."
The traditional rule of thumb for
the division of units was that "a third
was your major, a third was general
education, a third was elective," Mc-
Connell said. These parameters,
however, are not followed by all of
the major programs offered at Stan
ford. Some majors, like history or
math, require 55 to 65 units, while
some engineering majors require
more than 120.
A consequence of more units,
Campbell believes, is limited time to
take courses out of interest or cu
riosity.
"Students here have to be ex
tremely instrumental and practical
in how they think about their school
ing," Campbell said. "We don't want

to do anything that will compromise
what is one of the premier engineer
ing schools in the world. But we do
want to see carve out space in time
for students to reflect the totality of
their experiences."
SUES has been underway since
Provost John Etchemendy Ph.D. 'B2
and former Vice Provost for Under
graduate Education John Bravman
'79 M.S. 'Bl Ph.D. 'B5 commissioned
it last winter quarter. It is the most
recent in a series of studies on and
revisions to Stanford's undergradu
ate education that stretches back to
the 19605.
In 1994, the Commission on Un
dergraduate Education (CUE) rec
ommended University support for
undergraduate research, which
Campbell says "changed the face of
this institution utterly."
Of the students surveyed for this
article, all unanimously lauded the
University's abundance of research
opportunities for undergraduates.
"It's cool how much research
there is for everyone," said Adam
Jensen' 14. "I got into some psych re
search after my intro sem professor
mentioned he needed a few research

assistants."
What changes SUES will recom
mend remain to be seen, but the ul
timate goal of the committee and its
co-chairs remains clear.
"I think it's a great university, but
there are just certain things that I
think it can do better," Campbell
said. "And that's really our chal
lenge, is to come up with some fairly
concrete suggestions about how to
accomplish that."

prehensible."
The traditional rule of thumb for
the division of units was that "a third
was your major, a third was general
education, a third was elective," Mc-
Connell said. These parameters,
however, are not followed by all of
the major programs offered at Stan
ford. Some majors, like history or
math, require 55 to 65 units, while
some engineering majors require
more than 120.
A consequence of more units,
Campbell believes, is limited time to
take courses out of interest or cu
riosity.
"Students here have to be ex
tremely instrumental and practical
in how they think about their school
ing," Campbell said. "We don't want

to do anything that will compromise
what is one of the premier engineer
ing schools in the world. But we do
want to see carve out space in time
for students to reflect the totality of
their experiences."
SUES has been underway since
Provost John Etchemendy Ph.D. 'B2
and former Vice Provost for Under
graduate Education John Bravman
'79 M.S. 'Bl Ph.D. 'B5 commissioned
it last winter quarter. It is the most
recent in a series of studies on and
revisions to Stanford's undergradu
ate education that stretches back to
the 19605.
In 1994, the Commission on Un
dergraduate Education (CUE) rec
ommended University support for
undergraduate research, which
Campbell says "changed the face of
this institution utterly."
Of the students surveyed for this
article, all unanimously lauded the
University's abundance of research
opportunities for undergraduates.
"It's cool how much research
there is for everyone," said Adam
Jensen' 14. "I got into some psych re
search after my intro sem professor
mentioned he needed a few research

assistants."
What changes SUES will recom
mend remain to be seen, but the ul
timate goal of the committee and its
co-chairs remains clear.
"I think it's a great university, but
there are just certain things that I
think it can do better," Campbell
said. "And that's really our chal
lenge, is to come up with some fairly
concrete suggestions about how to
accomplish that."
