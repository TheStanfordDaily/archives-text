## Senate establishes rules of order, tables fees bill 
### MARGARET RAWSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Following a retreat last weekend at
Bass Lake, the Undergraduate Senate
found Tuesday that it still had some pro
cedural kinks to work out to set the tone
for the year, including expectations re
garding laptop use in Senate meetings
and collaboration on writing bills.
At the second meeting of the year,
with a close vote of eight to six, the Sen

ate passed a bill establishing the Senate
rules of order.
The Senate tabled a bill requiring that
students seeking special fees refunds do
so in person at Stanford Student Enter
prises and passed funding bills for the
Objectivists of Stanford and the Educa
tional Studies Program.
The Senate also confirmed the ASSU
Nominations Commission's second round
of nominees. Last Wednesday, the execu
tive committee appointed Stephanie Gar

rett 'l2 as chair of the Nominations Com
mission and Hilary Stone 'l3 as deputy
chair after the previous chair and deputy
chair stepped down from their positions
due to personal time constraints.
Rules of Order
The majority of Tuesday evening's
meeting was spent discussing a bill estab
lishing the Senate's rules of order. The
Senate adopted several minor friendly
amendments to the bill involving proce

dural issues, such as the time limits on
committee reports at Senate meetings.
The bulk of the controversy surround
ing the lengthy bill centered on Article
19, which prohibited the use of electronic
devices, specifically laptops, by senators
during meetings, except for specific Sen
ate business and note-taking.
"When we visited last year's meetings,
the vast majority of people were doing
stuff while voting ... we weren't
happy with that," said Stewart Mac
gregor-Dennis 'l3, one of the bill's
authors.
Several senators expressed con
cern that the no-laptop policy lacked
a mechanism of enforcement.
"It's not about slapping anybody
on the wrist," said ASSU Vice Presi
dent Kelsei Wharton 'l2.
Juany Torres 'l3, chair of the ad
ministration and rules committee,
was disappointed that her commit
tee had not seen the bill before it was
brought to the Senate for discussion.

"I feel I was disrespected, as well
as my committee," Torres said.
The bill's authors, Macgregor-
Dennis, Chair Michael Cruz 'l2 and
Daniel Khalessi 'l3, accepted re
sponsibility for the oversight and
emphasized their good intentions.
Special Fees and Appropriations
A bill requiring that students re
quest special fees refunds in person
at Stanford Student Enterprises was
tabled until next week as senators
expressed a need for input from the
Graduate Student Council and Stan
ford Student Enterprises.
The appropriations committee
held a successful town hall on Mon
day evening, according to committee
Chair Rafael Vasquez 'l2, who re
ported that the 12 student group fi

nancial officers in attendance pro
vided valuable feedback to tighten
loopholes in policy and improve
communication to student groups.
To begin Tuesday evening's meet
ing was itself a small hurdle for the
Senate. Last week, faced with a
locked room and a lost key, the Sen
ate was unable to meet in the normal
second-floor Nitery room and
moved into Old Union. This week,
Senator Will Seaton 'l3 descended
from a bathroom window onto a bal
cony to enter the scheduled meeting
room through a window.
"He's superman in disguise," said
Senator Pat Bruny 'l3 of his fellow
senator.
