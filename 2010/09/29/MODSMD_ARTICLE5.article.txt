## Objectivists host Biddle of Rand Institute

"I'd like to start tonight with a little thought experi
ment," said the man in the gray suit. "Imagine you must
choose today between two moral codes. One says that
your life is the most important thing in the world ... and
provides you with an abundance of guidance about how
to make your life wonderful. The second moral code says
that your life is unimportant, that you should give up the
things that make your life great."
The first moral code,it turns out,is Ayn Rand's unique
system of ethics, known as rational egoism or objec
tivism. The second is its polar opposite, the philosophy of
altruism. The man in the suit was Craig Biddle, editor of
The Objective Standard and author of "Loving Life: The
Morality of Self-interest and the Facts that Support It,"
who spoke Tuesday evening to a group of approximately
90 students in Building 320.
Biddle's lecture, which event organizer and Objec
tivists of Stanford President Evan Storms 'l3 said was in
tended to give attendees a "concrete, easy-to-understand
introduction to objectivist morality," provided listeners
with a two-hour survey course in the philosophy and
ethics of Ayn Rand, author of "Atlas Shrugged" and "The
Fountainhead."
Biddle devoted the initial part of his talk to differen
tiating between "selfishness and selflessness," between
Ayn Rand's system of rational egoism, which emphasizes
acting purely in one's own self-interest, and the compet
ing moral framework of altruism, which demands that in
dividuals act in the interest of others.

"Whether we choose a morality is not an option," de
clared Biddle. "Morality is inescapable, and the reason is
because we have free will."
Biddle warned, however, against what he called ac
cepting a morality "by default, by osmosis," a principle he
cautioned would inexorably lead to the passive accept
ance of altruism, which he contended dominates schools,
religious institutions and the media today. He proceeded
to repudiate what he saw as four logically flawed reasons

historically presented by proponents of altruism for act
ing in the interests of others besides oneself: because
God tells us to, because other people need our help, be
cause we must do so or face coercion by the state or be
cause it's simply the mature thing to do once we grow up.
"Altruism," declared Biddle in dismissing each of these
claims in turn, "is the morality of logical fallacies."

Craig Biddle, editor of The Objective Standard, an Objectivist publication, teaches Ayn Rand's philosophy to students
at an event hosted by the Objectivists at Stanford on Tuesday. Approximately 90 students attended the event.
By contrast, Biddle argued, "prac
ticed consistently, egoism leads to a
life of happiness." Using one's rea
son and intellect to make rational
decisions in one's own self-interest
under a government that respects
fundamental individual rights, he de
clared, is the only true path to indi
vidual fulfillment. Employing three
fundamental qualities reason,
purpose and self-esteem each in
dividual is equipped and obligated to
use his or her mind to produce and
be productive, and to refuse to be a
"parasite" by living off the work of
others.
Biddle followed with questions to
the audience about people's funda
mental obligations to one another
and critiqued the widely held notion
that self-sacrifice is morally good or
praiseworthy.
"Why sacrifice at all? What rea
sons are there to sacrifice?" he
asked, asserting instead that the ra
tional egoist realizes that he must
"neither sacrifice himself nor sacri
fice others."
