## Univ. searches for support for first-generation students 
### KURT CHIRBAS 
The Office of the Vice Provost for Student Affairs
(VPSA) has created a new position in an attempt to re
spond to a growing portion of the Stanford undergrad
uate student body.The newly created position, titled the
"associate dean and director of diversity and first-gen
eration programs," will be filled with the help of a 13-
member search committee.
Since the University revamped its financial aid poli
cy in 2008, there has been a steady increase in the per
centage of first-generation students on campus. Almost
15 percent of the incoming freshman class identified
themselves as first-generation, Vice Provost for Student
Affairs Greg Boardman said.
"[The financial aid initiative] has made Stanford a lot
more accessible, especially to students who are low-in
come or first-generation," Boardman said. "I think this
position will allow us to make a significant impact in
trying to support their unique challenges in transition
ing to college because their parents or families don't
have that prior experience to share with them."
This isn't the first attempt by the VPSA office to
reach out to first-generation students. During the 2008-
'O9 academic year, the office partnered up with the Of
fice of the Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education
to fund a similar position. At the time, this position was
filled by a recent Stanford grad.
"We wanted to see what kind of response we would
get," Boardman said. "It ended up being very positive."
Despite the good reception, this position was cut at
the end of that year due to the eco
nomic meltdown and the 15 per
cent University-wide budget cut
that followed. This summer, how
ever, an anonymous donor stepped
forward and agreed to fund a new
associate dean post for five years,
reviving VPSA's effort to reach out
to first generation students.
"In this era of tight budgets, this
gift allows us to expand the current
support and resources we offer to
the first generation community
through the community centers
and other campus offices," wrote
Associate Vice Provost Sally Dick
son in an e-mail to The Daily.
The search committee is chaired
by Shalini Bhutani, associate direc
tor of Bechtel International Cen
ter, and is comprised of students,
staff and a recent graduate. It in
cludes staff members from El Cen
tra Chicano, the Black Community
Services Center, the Financial Aid
Office, the Haas Center for Public
Service and Residential Education.
"The students who are actually
on the committee are not there be
cause they represent a particular
group, but because they are first
generation students themselves
and are committed to this work,"
said Associate Vice Provost and
Dean of Residential Education
Deborah Golder. "They might also
then be representative of other
groups, but it's really that they
have the experience."
Included on this committee is
Sarah de la Garza 'l2. She is a co
president of the First-Generation
and Low-Income Partnership, a
student organization on campus

that tries to both foster communi
ties for first generation students
and raise awareness about socioe
conomic class issues.
De la Garza said that the estab
lishment of this position is a step in
the right direction for the Universi
ty, as first-generation students
often encounter challenges that the
general student population does
not have to deal with, such as hav
ing to contribute to their family's
income and not having the same ex
periences as their fellow classmates
because of financial issues.
"It shows a conscious effort on
behalf of the University that they
are aware that this population ex
ists, and it helps establish a pres
ence among the administration,"
de la Garza said. "I foresee greater
interaction with student groups,
better programming and a lot more
open dialogue than what might
have taken place in the past."
The committee's current goal is
to fill the position by the end of this
quarter. Last Monday, committee
members filled out rankings to help
narrow down 22 candidates to the
final eight, and phone interviews
will be held sometime in October.
Later in the process, the commit
tee plans to bring the finalists to
campus, giving students a chance to
meet with them, ask them ques
tions and provide their input,
which will be used to come to a
final decision.
"[This position] is something that
institutionally we've needed for a
while, but now, the resources are
there to back it," Colder said,
"which speaks very highly to what a
huge difference alumni can make in
terms of advancing the needs of stu
dents."
