## HORSE ON A COURSE Stanford equestrians at the Farm's heart trot, vault, jump, play polo and more

Striding about campus in burnished
brown riding breeches and stiff,
dark boots that taper to a point,
Sasha Najera 'l3 looks every inch a
horsewoman.
"Eve been riding for as long as I can re
member," Najera said. "As a little kid, it's al
ways what I wanted to do, so finally my par
ents said, 'O.K., we'll give you lessons.' It
took 10 years of begging for a horse and
they finally gave me one. For me [the sport
meant] freedom, I guess!"
Before joining the Stanford equestrian
team, Najera primarily rode dressage, a type
of "horse ballet," where the rider shows the
horse's agility and footwork, as well as
doing vaulting, an activity involving gym
nastics on horseback. Coming to Stanford,
however, she joined the hunt seat team,
which rides both on flat courses and ones
with hurdle-like rails. After joining the
team, she began to jump, something she had
never tried before coming to Stanford.
"Learning how to jump is amazing. It's
just like flying, and I love it!" Najera said,
her eyes sparkling.
Balancing the equestrian team and school
is a challenge the season stretches from
October to May but the coaches recog
nize the immense course load that many of
the riders face. The team firmly believes in
practicing around the schedules of its stu
dent riders, and coaches do their utmost to
accommodate these student athletes.
"It's really great because you can struc
ture it just how you want, obviously we want
everyone to be super enthusiastic," Najera
said warmly of the team. "And everyone's
great and helps out at shows. Everyone

loves it and loves to be with everyone else."
"I think with a full year-long of competi
tion, I can't ask a student not to take an af
ternoon seminar because it's only offered
that quarter," said Vanessa Bartsch, head
coach of the Stanford equestrian team and
executive director of the University's
equestrian programs. "We try to schedule
when we can around them."
The Stanford equestrian team is coedu
cational and consists of about 35 riders at
different levels of experience. While the

team is primarily women, Stanford also
draws excellent male riders who cannot ride
at other schools.
In collegiate equestrian competition, only
women can compete at the varsity level,
Bartsch said. "And it's one of the few sports
in the world where it's co-gender and there's
no age. So for us it doesn't feel right to drop
the men from the sport to [go varsity]."
The sport is unusual as well in that there
are multiple levels of competition. For the
Western and English riders, there are six

levels, while for dressage only four. In order
to compete, a team must show riders at all
levels. Riders are scored within their cate
gories, meaning beginners from the
walk/trot category can contribute as much
value to the team score as an advanced vet
eran from the jumping category.
"It counts equally, and that's been really
great, because we can learn from the people
who are more talented, but also from the
people who are just starting," Najera said.
"Our walk/trot riders win national champi
onships, they're really great riders."
Najera brought her own horse, Lancast
er, to Stanford, and is responsible for caring
for him as well as performing other eques
trian duties required by team membership.
While the Stanford grooms, the caretak
ers at the barn, feed and water him and
clean his stall, Najera gives him vitamins
and shots of de-wormer to kill heartworms
and rides him for his exercise. However, the
energy she spends doing such tasks is ulti
mately well-rewarded.
"He challenges me a lot, and I don't [per
form] as well with him as I've done with some
other horses, but he keeps me really sharp as
a rider... and he's just the best for emotion
al support," Najera said. "Whenever school's
overwhelming, I can just go out there, sit on
him bareback, we'll go on a trail ride, and it
just brings me back to my happy place. I trust
him more than I trust any other horse."
The Stanford equestrian team is not the
only equine team on campus. The Stanford
polo team competes nationally with other
collegiate teams as a club sport. Played on
"polo ponies," riders use mallets to hit a ball
into a goal at the ends of the field in a fast
paced, dangerous game that can lead to bro
ken bones.
"It's kind of got the brutality of ice hock

ey with thousand-pound animals, except
there's no ice, and you're riding, not skat
ing," said Elizabeth Lake 'l3, another rider
who began playing polo at the end of last
year. "You can get pretty physical with it
we wear kneepads, we have helmets and the
helmets have facemasks on them, in case
you get bumped."
Otherwise, polo is a relaxed, easy-going
sport, and beginners who have spent their
lives with their feet firmly grounded are
welcomed whole-heartedly to the team.The
team relies on, and has been lucky to re
ceive, generous donations of "polo ponies"
to practice and compete on.
"One of my favorite parts about polo is
that the ponies just love their j ob, they get so
excited when they see the ball going," Lake
said. "When they're right next door they'll
reach over and try to bite it, push it over
they get really into the game."
