# STUDENT LIFE
## GSB alumni pioneer budding online social gaming industry 
### SAMANTHA McGIRR DESK EDITOR 
Though not every Stanford student has been on a
farm, many proudly own hundreds of acres of farmland
and herds of animals. They do this through the social
game FarmVille, an online platform that enables users
to simulate the experience of owning and tending a
farm a game that, like many others in the genre, has
its roots at Stanford.
FarmVille belongs to a growing category of online
applications including Mafia Wars and Tap Tap Re
venge referred to as "social games," so called because
people play them with friends on social networks such
as Facebook and MySpace, as well as cellular devices
like the iPhone. Much of the brainpower behind these
games comes from alumni of the Graduate School of
Business, many of whom are involved in the founding
and management of tech companies such as Zynga
Game Network Inc. and Tapulous Inc.
Social games have grown tremendously in popular
ity over the last few years due to their duality as a form
of entertainment and a platform for social interaction,
explained Haim Mendelson, professor of electronic
business at the Graduate School of Business.

"You can communicate with people you haven't
seen in two years, but only invest five minutes in [the
game]," he said. "An easy, Ã¼biquitous and fun connec
tion is very powerful."

Zynga, whose
current operating
director is

William "Bing" Gordon, MBA '7B, created the most
popular social game, FarmVille, in 2009. Now boasting
over 62 million users, FarmVille is available as an appli
cation on Facebook and on the iPhone and Android; in
FarmVille, players run farms and earn "coins" by har
vesting crops or selling animal products.
Justine DiPrete 'll recalls a time when she was an
avid user of FarmVille, at one point progressing up to
Level 24 of the game.
"The best part about social games is the competitive
aspect with your friends," she said. "When your friends
are on Level 27 and have 17 cows, then that gives you
motivation to play."
Though social games are relatively easy and cheap
to create Mendelson estimated one could be built in
three weeks with $5,000 the intrinsic challenges of
social media give larger, more experienced companies
an advantage.
"Large companies like Zynga have a lot of money
and can advertise on Facebook, for example," he said.
"They have high quality analytical ability, so they can
track how users are responding to the game and adapt
quickly. The barrier to developing a game is low, but the
barrier to developing a successful game is high."
Developing that rare successful game, however, can
pay off big time. FarmVille, for example, offers virtual
goods such as superior tools and special crops to users
willing to pay a small monetary fee. Though only
around 3 percent of social gamers opt to spend real
money on these virtual perks, the bottom line remains
favorable for the companies. According to Mendelson,
sales of virtual goods reached about $3 billion world
wide in the 2009-2010 fiscal year.
