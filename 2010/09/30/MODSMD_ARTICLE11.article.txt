## LETTER FROM THE EDITOR Covering ROTC 
### ELIZABETH TITUS Editor in Chief 
The Stanford Daily editorial board on
Wednesday called for the Reserve Of
ficer Training Corps (ROTC) pro
gram to return to Stanford even if the "don't
ask, don't tell" policy remains.
In a blog post, The Stanford Review ap
plauded the editorial board for coming out in
support of ROTC's return. We appreciate the
mention. However, it is worth setting the
record straight about something the blogger
wrote: "For a long time. The Stanford Review
was the only campus publication and one of
the few student-driven voices reporting on
ROTC at Stanford and calling for its return."
The Daily has covered ROTC and its ab
sence at Stanford for decades. The paper's
archives contain all its ROTC and anti-war
movement coverage from the 1960s and
19705, and anyone may read those fascinating
accounts in the Green Library Media and
Microtext Center or at the Lorry I. Lokey
Stanford Daily Building upon request.
More recently, in October 2001, The Daily
reported on Stanford students participating
in the program at other schools while nation
al interest in ROTC grew post-Sept. 11.
Emeritus Prof. Ronald Hilton wrote to The
Daily about historic clashes over ROTC at
the University that year, too.
In 2003, The Daily covered the College
Republicans' campaign to bring ROTC back
to Stanford and profiled some of the 30 stu
dents who were serving that year. The edito
rial board wrote against the program's return
and The Daily ran guest columns for and
against the program.

In 2005, The Daily wrote about an uptick
in the ROTC debate among students and fac
ulty.
In 2007, The Daily reported on Diana
Clough 'O7, an ROTC cadet who went to
Washington, D.C., that spring to be sworn in
as an army lieutenant. It also reported that
Azia Kim participated in Santa Clara ROTC
while pretending to be a Stanford student.
Meanwhile, the editorial board in May 2007
wrote that it was "time for Stanford to re
think its rationale for banning on-campus
ROTC programs."
In 2008, The Daily noted the support
among presidential candidates for the
Solomon Amendment while disagreement
about ROTC at Stanford persisted. It also
highlighted the tension between Stanford
Law School and JAG recruiters.
Last year, students continued covering
ROTC for The Daily. Nikhil Joshi 'll was
there when the Faculty Senate formed an ad
hoc committee to investigate the potential
return of ROTC. Wyndam Makowsky 'll
featured the history of the program and its
final departure from campus in 1973. Kate
Abbott 'l2 profiled Stanford students com
muting to other ROTC programs as they
weighed in on the program's possible return
to the Farm.
This year could be a historic one for
ROTC at Stanford. Whatever happens, The
Daily will continue to be there.
