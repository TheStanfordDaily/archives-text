# SENT FROM MY IPHONE
## I Can't Hear You 
### Lucas Will Johnson 
Someday, I hope to be that crotchety old
man who yells at the kids next door to
"turn it down!" Why? Because it means
I can still hear their music.

Deafening music at some college parties is
one of the many assaults on hearing in our
world. We compress audio into mp3s, cutting
away the high fidelity. We inject little head
phones into our ears, blasting over the
sounds of the outside world. And when we go
partying, the sound guy jams up the levels as
if the people down the street want to dance
too. The sonic world is vast and I don't want
to lose any perception of it due to an effluvial
loudspeaker one Friday night.
I have nothing against parties themselves.
The "dazed and confused" atmosphere is its
own world of fun. It's dark, late, hot and full
of intoxicated people squished in together at
tempting to dance. The fortissimo fits in with
the rest of the package.
But I don't understand why, when creat
ing those dens of semi-hedonism, we need to
use quite that level of volume. It would be
just as fun with the sound turned down a lit
tle. That marginal extra 10 dB isn't impera
tive for a rager. It will still be dark and crowd
ed. You'll still be intoxicated and you can still
make a "bad" decision and tell the story the
next morning. And let's face it: you're proba
bly too busy to notice that the music is qui
eter anyway.
For a modicum of technical expertise: what
does a Google search tell this non-bio major
about noise-induced hearing loss? Basically,
the louder the atmosphere, the quicker you
can experience lasting damage. Pretty obvi
ous. Workplace safety rules don't let you work
in an environment with sound at 110 dB for
longer than 30 minutes, a level often attrib
uted to rock concerts. So why save our ears in
the workplace only to kill them at home?
Granted, 110 dB is a rather specific level.
Loudness at a party can depend on all kinds
of things: distance from speakers, reflectivity
of the walls, how long you stay. You'd have to
carry around a decibel meter to get a true
reading, and the level of harm can still vary
from person to person. But the general prin
ciple still stands: don't linger too long at loud
levels, especially aggregated across all the
people in the room.
Some might disagree with my general as
sessment. It's not like we're firing guns in our
ears and going deaf. If there's some hearing
loss, it's at frequencies that aren't usually detri
mental to regular life. Maybe you'll have to ask
your friend to speak up a little when you're
older, but that will probably happen anyway.

Except that argument just doesn't fly for me,
especially as a musician. The subtleties of
sound at high-fidelity levels are too delicious to
give up. If parties gradually made you lose the
ability to taste chocolate, would you go?
Others might also criticize, saying your
hearing shouldn't be the DJ's responsibility.
We partygoers should self-regulate and not
stick around on the dance floor past a point
where it might muffle our brains' micro
phones. But doesn't it seem a bit sick to draw
people into something and then hurt them?
If we want to really cultivate an awesome
music scene on campus, we need to start by
maintaining our ability to even experience it
with our ears. I'm a big supporter of parties,
concerts, iPods and wailing away on a drum
set. But the volume doesn't need to go to 11.
If you're playing some tunes, keep the max at
a reasonable level. The listeners will appreci
ate it.
