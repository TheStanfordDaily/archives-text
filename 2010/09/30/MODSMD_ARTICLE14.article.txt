# THIS COLUMN IS IRONIC
## I Liked Stanford Football When It Was Still On Viny1 
### Shane Savitsky 
Stanford football has been deemed the
No. 9 team in the country.
Yes, you read that correctly. Our once
woeful Cardinal has officially reached na
tional prominence, at least for a week. The
team has the chance to prove itself on Satur
day afternoon within the ear-splitting con
fines of the University of Oregon's Autzen
Stadium. ESPN College Game Day is going
to be there. The entire country will be watch
ing our football team try to make its Rose
Bowl statement and potentially become a na
tional-title contender in the process. Ab
solutely everyone here in our little slice of
heaven cares about this game.
And it couldn't infuriate me more.
I remember coming here as a freshman
two years ago and nobody gave a shit about
this team. Half of our current student body
wasn't even here that season. Now they can
pretend to be fans all of a sudden? I bet
they'd get lost trying to walk to Stanford Sta
dium.
Last year, I saw this whole bandwagon
thing coming. Let me give you an analogy to
help you understand my predicament.
There's this little band from Prance called
Phoenix only they're not so little any
more. I've been listening to their pop jams for
years. No one knew who they were, and I'd al
ways be like, "Hey, check out this band called
Phoenix. They're great, I promise." No one

listened.
Then, in 2009, Phoenix put out this album
called "Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix." Boom.
Pitchfork loves them, my friends love them,
everybody loves them. They're playing the
main stage at Coachella and selling out
Madison Square Garden. Somehow, my cries
of "I told you so!" just got lost in the fray.
It was kind of the same thing with Stan
ford football. During the 2009 season, the
Stanford football team was just like Phoenix.
And Toby Gerhart was its "Wolfgang
Amadeus Phoenix."
CS majors who only leave their rooms to
go to the Lair started going to football games
to see Toby. Sorority girls who don't know the
difference between a touchdown and a home
run somehow started actively discussing
Toby's Heisman chances in between drink
stations at progressives. Somewhere in the
middle of his 1,871 yards of pure destruction,
it seemed like Toby Gerhart singlehandedly
made Stanford football cool again.

I couldn't believe it. This was my team. I
wanted to do my best Jim Harbaugh impres
sion and scream, "What's your deal?" to the
entire campus.
The end of the 2009 season gave me hope.
We did go 8-4 in the regular season, but we
managed to lose our bowl game and Toby got
robbed of the Heisman. I was disappointed,
but I thought this rush of bad news might
cause people to write off Stanford football
like they did Kings of Leon when they put
out "Only by the Night." Only I forgot one
crucial piece of information: Kings of Leon
actually do suck. Stanford football doesn't.
So here I am, staring at a 4-0 Cardinal foot
ball team in 2010 that somehow has once
again captured the hearts and minds of this
campus. There's an overwhelming feeling here
in our little bubble that this could be our year.
I'll be watching on Sunday, cheering on
my Cardinal with the rest of you the
sketchy grad students, the materials science
nerds, and everyone in between. Normally,
this would be a huge problem, but I'm ok
with it now. This team is too great to keep to
myself. I think it's about time the whole coun
try knew what Stanford football is all about.
Just remember one thing: I liked them
first.
