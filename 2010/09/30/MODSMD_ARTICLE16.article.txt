## FOES ON THE FARM No. 1 women face tough Oregon teams 
### KATHERINE KNOX 
The No.l Stanford women's volleyball
team (12-0, 2-0 Pac-10) returns to Maples
Pavilion this weekend to host Oregon State
(8-8,1-1) and No. 11 Oregon (12-0,2-0).
Stanford's conference home opener pits
the squad against the unranked Beavers for
the teams' 56th matchup in Pac-10 history.
The Cardinal has been nothing short of
dominant in the series, winning all 55
matches to date.
Oregon State split against the Washing
ton schools last weekend to open up its reg
ular season. The Beavers come to Palo Alto
fresh off a win at home against rival Wash
ington State.
The match will yield a battle at the net, as
OSU currently leads the Pac-10 in blocks
on the season, while Stanford tops the chart
in overall kills. Beaver sophomore middle
blocker Ashley Eneliko ranks second in the
Pac-10 in blocks, garnering 1.23 per game.
Freshman middle blocker Mona Kressl also
ranks ahead of Stanford's block leader, red
shirt junior Stephanie Browne.
On the offensive end, Stanford senior
outside hitter Alix Klineman ranks second
in the Pac-10 in kills this season, while OSU
senior outside hitter Jill Sawatzsky is
ranked sixth. Both players have at least
twice as many kills as any teammate, mak
ing a showdown at the pins inevitable.
An aggressive net game is sure to rile up
the fans, especially the first true Cardinal
crowd of the season. Although the fresh
man class made its debut at Maples during
the Stanford Invitational against UC-Irvine
and Marquette earlier this month, this
weekend marks the first home match while
school is in session.

"This weekend is really exciting for the
freshmen because we will get to experience
the feeling of playing in front of the student
body and all our fans," said freshman out
side hitter Rachel Williams.
All the teams competing in Maples this
weekend are coming off victories and each
is seeking to maintain a winning record
throughout conference play.
The Ducks come to the Bay after upset
ting previously undefeated No. 7 Washing
ton at home last weekend, beating the
Huskies for the first time in 10 years. Sitting
at No. 11, Oregon now lies on the verge of
its first top-10 ranking on the season.
Oregon's rise in the NCAA rankings
can be partially attributed to an effective
service game. The Ducks top the Pac-10 in
aces senior Heather Meyers is first and
sophomores Kat Fischer and Jocelyn
Levig place fourth and fifth, respectively.
This is the only team statistic for which
Stanford does not rank in the top three in

the conference.
Williams affirms that the team is "focus
ing on perfecting the little things and
preparing as best [it] can." Practices often
include situations that simulate serving
under pressure at zones on the court, as if to
target a specific passer or weaker location
in the lineup.
"Our main focus this season is to take a
step forward each week," said senior libera
Gabi Ailes. "After the weekend, we take a
look at film from our matches and work on
our weaknesses until they become our
strengths."
Luckily for the Card, its serve-receive
game is one of its strengths, an aspect which
may counteract the Ducks' effective serv
ing on Saturday night whether or not Stan
ford can deliver from the service line.
As a top-ranked team, Oregon also
earns a bulk of its points at the pins. Meyers
and Fischer who switch unpredictably
between the left and right sides, both within
and between points rank sixth and sev
enth in points earned per set, which speaks
to their ability to split the block. Both play
ers, like Klineman, also frequently run an
aggressive back-row attack, making their
opponents liable for a variety of shots.
Additionally, Duck redshirt sophomore
outside hitter Alaina Bergsma earned a sea
son-high 21 kills, scored 23 points and won
Pac-10 Player of the Week after her per
formance against the Washington schools.
With at least three offensive threats on the
court at all times, the Cardinal blockers and
defenders will have their work cut out for
them.
Nonetheless, Stanford tops the Pac-10 in
assists and kills, ranks second in digs and
rounds out the top three in blocks.
Both teams enter the match undefeated,
posting identical records of 2-0 in the Pac
-10 and 14-0 on the season. Despite the Car

crowd of the season. Although the fresh
man class made its debut at Maples during
the Stanford Invitational against UC-Irvine
and Marquette earlier this month, this
weekend marks the first home match while
school is in session.

"This weekend is really exciting for the
freshmen because we will get to experience
the feeling of playing in front of the student
body and all our fans," said freshman out
side hitter Rachel Williams.
All the teams competing in Maples this
weekend are coming off victories and each
is seeking to maintain a winning record
throughout conference play.
The Ducks come to the Bay after upset
ting previously undefeated No. 7 Washing
ton at home last weekend, beating the
Huskies for the first time in 10 years. Sitting
at No. 11, Oregon now lies on the verge of
its first top-10 ranking on the season.
Oregon's rise in the NCAA rankings
can be partially attributed to an effective
service game. The Ducks top the Pac-10 in
aces senior Heather Meyers is first and
sophomores Kat Fischer and Jocelyn
Levig place fourth and fifth, respectively.
This is the only team statistic for which
Stanford does not rank in the top three in

the conference.
Williams affirms that the team is "focus
ing on perfecting the little things and
preparing as best [it] can." Practices often
include situations that simulate serving
under pressure at zones on the court, as if to
target a specific passer or weaker location
in the lineup.
"Our main focus this season is to take a
step forward each week," said senior libera
Gabi Ailes. "After the weekend, we take a
look at film from our matches and work on
our weaknesses until they become our
strengths."
Luckily for the Card, its serve-receive
game is one of its strengths, an aspect which
may counteract the Ducks' effective serv
ing on Saturday night whether or not Stan
ford can deliver from the service line.
As a top-ranked team, Oregon also
earns a bulk of its points at the pins. Meyers
and Fischer who switch unpredictably
between the left and right sides, both within
and between points rank sixth and sev
enth in points earned per set, which speaks
to their ability to split the block. Both play
ers, like Klineman, also frequently run an
aggressive back-row attack, making their
opponents liable for a variety of shots.
Additionally, Duck redshirt sophomore
outside hitter Alaina Bergsma earned a sea
son-high 21 kills, scored 23 points and won
Pac-10 Player of the Week after her per
formance against the Washington schools.
With at least three offensive threats on the
court at all times, the Cardinal blockers and
defenders will have their work cut out for
them.
Nonetheless, Stanford tops the Pac-10 in
assists and kills, ranks second in digs and
rounds out the top three in blocks.
Both teams enter the match undefeated,
posting identical records of 2-0 in the Pac
-10 and 14-0 on the season. Despite the Car

SIMON WARBY/The Stanford Daily
The top-ranked Stanford women's volleyball team returns home this weekend to take on a pair of
conference opponents in Oregon State and No. 11 Oregon. The Cardinal remains undefeated this year.

dinal posting a 47-3 historical record
against the Ducks, the teams split
their last two meetings as each won on
its home court in 2009 conference
play.
Home-court advantage is histori
cally significant in this matchup
Stanford has not lost to Oregon in
Maples Pavilion since 1989.
"We are coming off of playing the
past four out of five weekends on the
road," Ailes said. "Playing on the road
comes with many challenges travel
time wearing down bodies, playing in
difficult atmospheres with hostile
crowds, and adjusting to time zone
changes. We are looking forward to
playing in front of our home crowd."
Stanford takes on Oregon State on
Friday and Oregon on Saturday. Both
matches are set to start at 7 p.m. at
Maples Pavilion.
