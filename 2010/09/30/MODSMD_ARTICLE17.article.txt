# Value the stats, not the rings
## 
### Zach Zimmerman Dishing the Rock 
I would be lying out of my teeth if I
told you that I've been remotely
following Major League Baseball
this year. I just learned that the
Braves are winning the NL Wild
Card race, and I recognized less than half
of the starters in the Red Sox lineup
three nights ago.
Thus, it seems pretty ridiculous that
I'd even attempt to discuss the AL Cy
Young race because 1) I hardly know
anything about it and 2) I don't really
care. What I am aware of.liowcver.is that
this year's field is strong and a little weird.
There are five pitchers that could possi
bly win the award that is annually given
to the best hurler: Boston's John Lester
and Clay Buchholz, the Yankees' C.C.
Sabathia, Tampa Bay's David Price and
Seattle's Felix Hernandez.
All of those pitchers are big-name
players oozing with skill and/or poten
tial. Not one of them comes as that big of
a surprise, and all have posted pretty
spectacular numbers this season.
Here is where it gets strange. It seems
as if the race will come down to Sabathia,
Price and Hernandez. Sabathia and
Price bring pretty gaudy, but rather stan
dard, numbers to the Cy Young table.
The Yankee is 21-7 with a 3.18 ERA and
197 strikeouts, and Price is 19-6 with a
2.73 ERA and 187 strikeouts.
Meanwhile, Felix Hernandez is just
13-12, but has an ERA of 2.27 and 232
freaking strikeouts.
We're now in an age in sports where
statistics are more relevant than ever,
and individual talent can and should be
measured with numbers. The traditional
baseball experts are having trouble
wrapping their heads around a potential
Cy Young winner with just 13 victories
to his name and 12 losses. They see
Sabathia and Price, star pitchers on two
of the most dominant teams in baseball,
as better fits. Well guess what?
Winning isn't everything.
I'll be completely honest and say that
I don't know diddly about sabermetrics.
WARP, WHIP and PERA sound more
to me like animal activist groups than
comprehendible measurements of a
player's ability.
What I do know is this: In baseball,
you can't win without scoring. The Rays
and the Yankees have no problem in this
department, combining for 1,633 runs
while smacking 158 and 198 home runs,
respectively. Even when Price and
Sabathia had off days, they could get the
run support necessary for wins. I prom
ise I'm not trying to discount their sea
sons in any way. It's just that, in baseball,
scoring is a fundamental part of winning.
Crazy, right?
So what is Hernandez's deal? The

Seattle Mariners absolutely suck. They
are abysmal. Felix's friends have done
little to help his case, registering just 501
runs on a measly .235 collective average.
The Mariners are currently the only
team in all of baseball with fewer than
100 dingers (99). At 35 games under
.500, it's pretty easy to see why Hernan
dez has just 13 wins one earned run is
too often not enough to seal a win.
My point here isn't to advocate for
Hernandez even though, with the
limited research I did for this column,
he's the most deserving but rather to
put to rest the conservative view that the
only stat that matters for a player in any
professional sport is winning. Taking an
athlete's performance out of context to
decrease his perceptive value is com
pletely unfair and is an antiquated
method for awarding honors.
Still, I have friends who wholeheart
edly believe that the most important sta
tistic for determining whether a player is
of Hall of Fame caliber is number of
championships won. They believe that
Robert Horry is a better basketball
player and more deserving of a vote into
Springfield than, say, a Reggie Miller.
Horry is a career 42.5 percent shoot
er from the field and just 34 percent
from outside the arc. He averaged exact
ly seven SEVEN!!! â€”points per
game in just over 24 minutes of play.
Compared to Miller, who hit nearly half
of his field goals and 40 percent of his
threes while averaging 18 points per
game, Horry's Hall of Fame credentials
are laughable. Sure, he hit some big shots
and has won seven titles, but those came
with some of the best teams ever. If you
had put me on the 2000 Lakers as the
12th man, they still would have won a
title. Let me remind you that in June of
20001 was nine years old, less than five
feet tall and my favorite musical artist
was Eiffel 65.
The moral of the story is that regard
less of how many rings Horry won, he
wasn't half the player that Reggie Miller
was. If you were to pick an NFL quarter
back to build a historical fantasy team
around, would you choose Super Bowl
champion Trent Dilfer, or a loser like
Dan Marino? IsTy Cobb multiple rungs
below David Eckstein on the greatest
players-of-all-time ladder?
So give Felix Hernandez his props,
award him the Cy Young and get your
head out of the sand.This is 2010, and we
have the ability to analyze every
nanometer of a player's performance.
Championship rings are the ultimate
team goal, but they shouldn't be relied on
for determining individual ability.
After all, it's not whether you win or
lose, it's how you play the game.
