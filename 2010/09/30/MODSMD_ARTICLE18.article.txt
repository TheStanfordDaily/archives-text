# MEN IN BLACK
## New football look gets mixed reviews 
### LIZZY COLLINS 
On Sept. 18, for the first
time in school history,
the No. 9 Stanford
football team wore
all-black uniforms in
its home game against Wake For
est. Upon first glance, spectators
and fans were shocked to see the
Cardinal wearing a foreign color.
For some, the addition of a third
uniform was genius. For others, it
was a miserable failure.
A handful of the team's veteran
players helped design the black
uniforms, which were provided by
Nike back in 2008. Flowever, it was
not until the beginning of this sea
son that head football coach Jim
Harbaugh offered the players the
opportunity to wear the new gear.
"Personally, I loved them," said
sophomore linebacker Shayne
Skov.
The Stanford football team tra
ditionally wears red jerseys with
white pants at home and either
white jerseys with red pants or all
white uniforms when they play on
the road. Historically, it is uncom
mon for teams to vary the colors of
their uniforms. It has, however, be
come increasingly popular to cre
ate color combinations that are
outside the norm.
With the new look came a re
markable performance as Stanford
easily defeated Wake Forest, 68-24.
"Maybe it was the black uni
forms," joked redshirt sophomore
quarterback Andrew Luck.

Harbaugh was reluctant to ad
dress the issue, while assuring that
the team's performance was more
important than the color of its uni
forms. Fans, however, could not help
but express their opinions. Students
were both excited and disappointed

about the new look, yet they all ac
knowledged the new spirit in the re
cently indomitable team.
"They're horrible," said Jenni
Ockelmann 'll. "All the students
and spectators are out there in red
and white, and for some reason our

team is in black? It doesn't make
any sense."
"I think they're intimidating,"
said Andrew Molina 'll. "They rep
resent the huge shift in the last
three years of Stanford football,
and I love them."
Black is fierce and adds a level
of intensity to Stanford football
that the Cardinal may have been
lacking. For the first time since
1986, Stanford is off to a 4-0 start,
and with the way it has been play
ing, the black could be a positive in
dicator of what is to come.
"When you wear all black, you
have a different attitude," Skov
said.
The players were energized as
they ran out of the tunnel in a mass
of black and lit up the stadium with
their newfound spirit. Though
cheering for the team in black was
unusual, the Red Zone did not miss
a step. Stanford football is making a
name for itself, and the stunning all
black uniforms helped elevate its
"we mean business" identity.
"I loved the black uniforms,"
said sophomore running back Tyler
Gaffney. "I know some alumni may
not have liked them, but putting up
68 points, we can't complain."
Love it or hate it, the new look is
not here to stay. The Bootleg re
ported that the all-black uniforms
will likely not be seen again this
year.
"Probably not this season," Har
baugh said. "We just prefer to wear
our standard uniforms in the con
ference games, but I think we'll
wear them again at some point."
Harbaugh has been known to
refer to himself as a traditionalist,
so at least for now, the team will be
sporting its conventional uniforms.
Expect the traditional cardinal and
white at the team's next home
game, Oct. 9 against rival USC.
