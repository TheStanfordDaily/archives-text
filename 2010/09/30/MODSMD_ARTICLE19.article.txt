## Cardinal walk-ons flourish in roles 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY MANAGING EDITOR 
Stanford, like the rest of its Divi
sion I compatriots, is allotted 85
scholarships to use for its football
program at any given time. With the
ability to secure such a wealth of tal
ent with the promise of a free educa
tion, it is often easy to forget about
the players who pay their own way
and hold down the team's remaining
spots: the walk-ons.
Indeed, at some schools, they re
main an afterthought. Redshirt fresh
man Robbie Picazo, a walk-on, spoke
of stories he had heard of players who

never received game time, solely be
cause of their scholarship status.
But Stanford prides itself on its
ability to recruit athletes who, for one
reason or another, fly under the radar
in high school. Two years ago, Direc
tor of Football Administration Mike
Eubanks declared: "No successful
program can operate without a
strong walk-on program." His state
ment, said well before Stanford had
achieved a No. 9 national ranking, has
proven to be prophetic.
Ryan and Griff Whalen the
Cardinal's No. 1 and No. 3 receivers,
respectively as well as Nate
Whitaker, a Lou Groza Award candi

date as Stanford's kicker, and Zach
Nolan, the team's errorless long snap
per, came to The Farm without schol
arships in hand. And the Cardinal's
all-important scout teams which
prepare the starters and top reserves
for the next opponent by mimicking
its schemes are littered with walk
ons, many of whom are recognized by
coach Jim Harbaugh publicly, and on
a weekly basis, for their practice per
formances.

The road to prominence is certain
ly not easy, but Harbaugh is clear:
walk-ons are not thought of different
ly, or set at an inherent disadvantage
from the onset of their careers. The

thinking goes: If a player shows he
can contribute, he will contribute, re
gardless of whether or not he has a
free ride.
"We look at walk-ons the same as
everybody else," Harbaugh said. "We
go and get guys who are good football
players and then try to evaluate them.
There's no different method."
"Stanford is a lot different from
other places," Picazo said. "Coach
Harbaugh treats you the same, and if
you can help the team, you're going to
play. It's a lot different from other
schools."
In the past two years in particular,
the walk-on program has flourished.
If a viewer were to watch the second
half of Stanford's win over Wake For
est, for example, he or she would have
seen a field filled with redshirt fresh
man walk-ons from the recruiting
class of 2009. There was receiver Sam
Knapp making his first career recep
tion. There was running back Andrew
Stutz scoring a touchdown on just his
second carry. There was linebacker
Brent Etiz jumping the snap count
with regularity, and recording three
tackles, including one for a loss. All
were seeing their first collegiate ac
tion; all performed up to par.
"You come full circle, and you real
ly feel like you're contributing," Etiz
said.
Knapp, Stutz and Etiz were not the
only ones to get in on the action. Jacob
Gowan, Brent Seals and Myles
Muagututia have all seen playing time
in multiple games this season.
Muagututia, a safety, was rewarded
with a scholarship before the year
began. Even players that have yet to
get snaps have played significant
roles. Picazo, as a true freshman, was
the No. 2 quarterback in the Sun Bowl
last season, and Michael Spanos, who
is out for the year with a torn ACL,
won Harbaugh's praise throughout

spring practices, and may have seen
time in 2010 had he been healthy.
For most, playing time is fleeting.
Knapp had no illusions of grandeur.
"Whenever you're third string,
you're always watching the score
board and hoping," he said. "In terms
of playing time, you don't really ex
pect any, so any that you get is a huge
bonus."
That said, the walk-ons are im
mensely serious about their prepara
tions. Although those are mainly for
the benefit of the starters, their scout
team work has them ready should
playing time should arise.
Etiz provides a fine example.
Against the Demon Deacons, he
seemed to be in the backfield as soon
as the ball was snapped. He attributed
that success to studying Wake Forest's
silent count on film and during the
game.
"I timed it up, and the pieces came
into place," he said. "We take a lot of
pride in our work; it means a lot to us."
That collective mentality was one
that the class established as soon as it
came to campus.
"We definitely came in and bond
ed instantly," Knapp said. "We have a
really strong class."
For his part, Harbaugh recognizes
the ability of this particular walk-on
group.
"There's no question that last
year's class was the best we've had,"
he said.
But he is never the one to rest on
his laurels or resist issuing a challenge.

"The newest class is really good,
too," Harbaugh said. "I can't tell which
one will be better in the long run."
