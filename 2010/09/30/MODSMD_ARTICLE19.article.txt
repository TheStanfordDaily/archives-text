## Cardinal walk-ons flourish in roles 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY MANAGING EDITOR 
Stanford, like the rest of its Divi
sion I compatriots, is allotted 85
scholarships to use for its football
program at any given time. With the
ability to secure such a wealth of tal
ent with the promise of a free educa
tion, it is often easy to forget about
the players who pay their own way
and hold down the team's remaining
spots: the walk-ons.
Indeed, at some schools, they re
main an afterthought. Redshirt fresh
man Robbie Picazo, a walk-on, spoke
of stories he had heard of players who

never received game time, solely be
cause of their scholarship status.
But Stanford prides itself on its
ability to recruit athletes who, for one
reason or another, fly under the radar
in high school. Two years ago, Direc
tor of Football Administration Mike
Eubanks declared: "No successful
program can operate without a
strong walk-on program." His state
ment, said well before Stanford had
achieved a No. 9 national ranking, has
proven to be prophetic.
Ryan and Griff Whalen the
Cardinal's No. 1 and No. 3 receivers,
respectively as well as Nate
Whitaker, a Lou Groza Award candi

date as Stanford's kicker, and Zach
Nolan, the team's errorless long snap
per, came to The Farm without schol
arships in hand. And the Cardinal's
all-important scout teams which
prepare the starters and top reserves
for the next opponent by mimicking
its schemes are littered with walk
ons, many of whom are recognized by
coach Jim Harbaugh publicly, and on
a weekly basis, for their practice per
formances.

The road to prominence is certain
ly not easy, but Harbaugh is clear:
walk-ons are not thought of different
ly, or set at an inherent disadvantage
from the onset of their careers. The

thinking goes: If a player shows he
can contribute, he will contribute, re
gardless of whether or not he has a
free ride.
"We look at walk-ons the same as
everybody else," Harbaugh said. "We
go and get guys who are good football
players and then try to evaluate them.
There's no different method."
"Stanford is a lot different from
other places," Picazo said. "Coach
Harbaugh treats you the same, and if
you can help the team, you're going to
play. It's a lot different from other
schools."
