## Olmsted Terrace welcomes home faculty families Housing development on Stanford Ave. welcomes first round of new occupants 
### KELSEY KING 
After four years of planning and a year and a half of con
struction, all the houses of the new Olmsted Terrace devel
opment have been sold and the first faculty residents have
moved in.
The development, located on Stanford Avenue between
Escondido and El Camino Real, has six completed and oc
cupied homes. An additional five homes are set to be com
pleted each month until April 2011 for a total of 39 houses,
said Tiffany Griego, associate director of real estate for
Stanford's Office of Real Estate.
Stanford developed Olmsted Terrace to help recruit and
retain faculty by creating desirable, affordable, on-campus
housing. At $700,000 to $900,000, the homes are intended to
make ownership a more realistic option for faculty in the
relatively high-cost Palo Alto area.
"Real estate prices are very high in this area and afford
able housing for our faculty is a major challenge," wrote Jan
Thomson, director of Faculty-Staff Housing, in an e-mail to
The Daily. "A special, and very restricted, lease was devel
oped for Olmsted Terrace in order to make the homes more
affordable for our faculty and to keep them affordable for
future faculty who buy there,"
Buyers are subject to a 51-year restrictive ground lease.
As a condition of the lease, after 51 years the lessee must sell
the home back to the University, which can in turn sell the
home to another faculty member.
"It's really trying to create a stock of faculty housing that
Stanford will have into perpetuity," Griego said.
Faculty members were quick to realize the benefits of
Olmsted Terrace. More than 175 eligible faculty members
expressed interest in the homes. Due to the high demand,
priority was given to Academic Council faculty who had
never owned a home in the Bay Area. In August, the last
available Olmsted Terrace home was sold.
The development, which consists of two-story, three- and
four-bedroom homes, includes amenities designed exclu
sively for faculty. Such amenities include studies in every
home located near the front door so students and col
leagues can easily visit faculty without disturbing other fam
ily members. Additionally, the homes have high speed
SUNet access to allow faculty members to work at home, as
well as designated parking for guests.
"We worked with a faculty focus group early on to figure
out the design and program of the homes," Griego said.
"They are definitely targeted to faculty, with a goal of max
imizing value for the faculty with every single decision."
The development boasts a clustered design where homes
share courtyards and jogging paths. The homes are

equipped with energy- and water-ef
ficient appliances, allowing each
home to exceed state energy-effi
ciency standards by at least 15 per
cent.
Additionally, the homes' architec
tural styles complement the sur
rounding Palo Alto homes. Five dif
ferent architectural styles and four
different floor plans allowed faculty
members to choose homes that

would best serve their needs.
"We have tried to avoid making a
cookie-cutter development here,"
Griego said. "Instead, we've really
tried to create a community."
In addition to the 39 Olmsted Ter
race homes, 25 homes, including four
duplex buildings (eight units) and 17
single-family homes are available for
rent between Olmsted Road and El
Camino Real. Seven homes were
completed for occupancy on Sept. 24,
with the rest set to be completed by
December 2010.
