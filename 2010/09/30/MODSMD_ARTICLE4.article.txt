### IVY NGUYEN SAMANTHA MCGIRR 
The Stanford School of Medi
cine ushered in a new era on
Wednesday with the opening of the
Li Ka Shing Center for Learning
and Knowledge, expected to help
transform the way in which physi
cians are trained at the school.
About 300 people attended the
dedication ceremony on Alumni
Green, adjacent to the new build
ing. A $9O million project, it faces
Campus Drive, nestled between the
Beckman Center and Fairchild
Building in the medical school com
plex.
Philip Pizzo, dean of the School
of Medicine, said on his first visit to
Stanford to interview for the dean's
position, none of the cab drivers he
asked knew where on campus the
Medical School was. The 120,000-
square-feet Li Ka Shing Center
raises the school's physical profile.
In their remarks, Pizzo, Universi
ty President John Hennessy and
donor Li Ka-Shing extolled the
virtues of the five-story building,
which features an array of interac
tive and technologically advanced
teaching tools for doctors.
"It is not only the building of the
future," Pizzo said. "It is an identity
for the School of Medicine."
The center will serve as the hub
of educational activities for medical
students and experienced clinicians

alike who want to undertake expe
riential and team-based approaches
to learning.
The ground floor houses the
28,000-square-foot Hon Mai and
Joseph Goodman Center for Simu
lation and Immersive Learning. The
facility features a fully simulated
hospital with programmable man
nequins that bleed, breathe and
talk. Physicians can use these man
nequins, as well as individual simu
lation devices, to test their manage
ment of almost any clinical condi
tion.
Li Ka-Shing, the building's pri
mary benefactor, is a Hong Kong
entrepreneur and philanthropist.
He is also the chairman of the Li Ka
Shing Foundation, which had con
tributed $37 million to medical re
search and programs at Stanford
since 1983 before building the cen
ter. The center represents the third
major collaboration between the
foundation and the University.
Li, whose second son attended
Stanford as an undergraduate, ex
pressed his fondness for the Uni
versity in his speech, translated
from Chinese by an interpreter.
"Lives have been enriched here,
ennobled with a sense of service,"
Li said. "Today, with the dedication
of this building, I am now a part of
this university. For that I am most
happy and very honored."
