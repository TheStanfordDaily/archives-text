## At ERs, a dose of prevention Stanford study finds most ERs offer form of preventative care 
### JULIA BROWNELL SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
A recent study from Stanford School of Medicine
has found that during a trip to the emergency room,
you may very well receive a dose of preventive medi
cine.
Offering the first comprehensive picture of pre
ventive care in U.S. emergency departments, the study
revealed that a striking 90 percent of emergency de
partments (EDs) offer such services.
Lead author Mucio "Kit" Delgado, M.D., a post
doctoral scholar at Stanford's Center for Primary
Care and Outcomes Research, views this high per
centage as a symptom of a deeper problem within the
U.S. healthcare system: lack of access to primary care
services.
"[The findings] point to the fact that we need to
improve our health care system so that patients can
get primary care in other places," Delgado, who is also
an emergency room physician at Stanford Hospital,
said. "It's a symptom that things aren't working out as
they should."
The study surveyed the directors of 350 randomly

selected emergency departments around the country
on the services offered in their ED and their per
ceived barriers to offering preventive care.
The most common service provided is screening
for domestic violence, offered at 66 percent of hospi
tals. Delgado noted that this finding is actually discon
certing, considering that the accrediting agency for
U.S. hospitals mandates that emergency rooms offer
this service.
Other services commonly available included in
fluenza and pneumococcus vaccines, tobacco and al
cohol addiction counseling and screening for dia
betes, hypertension and HIV. The study asked about
11 different services in total.
The least commonly offered service is HIV screen
ing, only available at 19 percent of hospitals, despite a
CDC recommendation for testing at all emergency
departments. Delgado suggested that the low access
rate was due to the high cost of implementing the
screening.
"That's not surprising because it does take a huge
amount of effort to be able to do that [HIV screening]
effectively," he said.
ED directors saw cost, increased length of patient
stay and lack of follow-up as the top barriers to offer
ing preventive care services in their ED. Almost 75
