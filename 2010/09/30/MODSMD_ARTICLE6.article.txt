## Grad Student Council weighs Dining's 'apartment meal plan' 
### ANNA SCHUESSLER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Graduate Student Council (GSC) on Wednesday
unanimously approved the first round of student nomi
nees to University committees and boards. Based on rec
ommendations by the Nominations Commission, the
nominees were approved by the Undergraduate Senate
on Tuesday.
The council questioned nominees for committees such

as the Student Activities Advisory Board, the Bicycle
Safety Committee and the Graduate Housing Advisory
Committee, among others, about their plans for the up
coming school year.
The council moved on to discuss a proposed new meal
plan Stanford Dining has designed specifically for gradu
ate students. Advertised as the ''apartment meal plan,"
the program in the fall quarter offers five meals a week
and $5O in Cardinal Dollars for $571.
"What we're looking for is some way to get the word

out, because the need is there," said Chana Rodriguez,
Stanford Dining's events and voluntary meal plan manag
er.
Rodriguez attended the meeting to gather graduate
students' reactions to the proposed plan. She said the new
plan would offer better pricings than the cash price for
meals at University dining halls. For example, under the
Apartment Meal Plan, students would pay an average of
$6.95 per dinner as opposed to the
$lO charged out of pocket.
Members of the council expressed
some resistance to the plan, reason
ing that the new plan was not clearly
distinguishable or necessarily better
priced than the plan that already ex
isted for graduate students, which
charges a flat $5.95 for lunch and
$6.95 for dinner. Rodriguez assured
the GSC that the proposed plan was
unique due to its increased efficiency

and the addition of Cardinal Dollars.
Ultimately, some members wanted
an option closer to home.
"I think you should try to work
with Ray's because that's where grad
students eat," said Krystal St. Julien, a
graduate student in biochemistry.
Ray's Grill is in the Graduate Com
munity Center on east campus.
ASSU executives Angelina Car
dona 'll and Kelsei Wharton 'l2
joined the meeting with an update on
upcoming programming. They invit
ed the graduate students to the "Fall
into Health" event slated for Friday
in White Plaza. Currently working to
gether to draft a revamped sexual
health survey which Vaden Health
Center will release later in the quar
ter, the group discussed the possibili
ty of offering two iPads as prizes to
encourage student participation.
"This information will be ultra
helpful and it will be really important
in terms of research for these issues,"
said Cardona.
Opinions differed on whether of
fering one iPad or several smaller
prizes at the same cost would be more
effective at boosting student respons
es, but the group saved the discussion
for another day and ultimately ap
proved $550 for the prizes, roughly
the cost of a basic iPad.
