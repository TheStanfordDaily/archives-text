## Friedman talks sustainability, energy sources 
### TYLER BROWN DESK EDITOR 
Author and New York Times columnist Thomas Fried
man called for technological innovation and government
regulations that support global clean energy while
lamenting "a values breakdown in both the market and in
Mother Nature" over the last decade. He spoke on
Wednesday at the second and final day of the Stanford
Global Climate and Energy Project's (GCEP) research
symposium.
"Our country is still exploding with innovative prom
ise ... but somehow we're not getting the most out of it,"
Friedman said.
More than 500 individuals in academia, venture capi
tal and industry registered for the conference. Organizers
invited Friedman because of his expertise in the global

clean energy field, said Sally Benson,
director of GCEP.
"He's an interesting guy and has
interesting perspectives on interna
tional issues that are central to solv
ing energy problems," Benson said.
During the talk, Friedman de
cried past and present practices that
value profit over sustainability.
"We have treated both the mar
ket and Mother Nature with same
principle: I'll be gone, you'll be
gone," Friedman said. "Plow up the
Amazon to sell soybeans."
Friedman warned of a difficult
future if the world economy does
not adopt more "green" practices.
"If we don't bring sustainable
values to [the market and nature],
then we are going to be more unfree

than if the greatest generation had
not won the Cold War," Friedman
said.
Friedman also drew ties between
the price of oil and political oppres
sion.
"'Petrolist' states are totally de
pendent on oil for their GDP," he
said. "As the price of oil goes down,
freedom goes up."
The best solution to these prob
lems is a sustainable energy system
or, as Friedman phrased it, "abun
dant, cheap, clean, reliable electrons
the next great global industry."
Though popular sentiment holds
governments responsible for regu
lating clean energy, "this is a prob
lem that will be solved by innovators
and engineers, not regulators,"
Friedman said.
Coming closer to this goal of
widespread, sustainable energy was
the motivation behind the sympo
sium, Benson said.
"A sustainable energy system is

affordable, accessible, secure and
protective of the environment," she
said, adding that a goal of the sym
posium is to "bring forward these
ideas and develop new approaches
to make energy more sustainable."
Friedman compared global-scale
development of clean energy with
the tech revolution in the 19905, dur
ing which the developed world rap
idly integrated the Internet into its
everyday life.
When the "green revolution"
runs its course, instead of living in
drastically different ways, "when we
win, we're still going to have the
same light, heating and cooling and
mobility" with a better planet and
environment, he predicted.
Following Friedman's speech, the
GCEP symposium focused on the
carbon cycle and how it informs peo
ple about carbon dioxide emissions.
Throughout the symposium, speak
ers and panel discussions comple
mented posters and presentations

from graduate and postdoctoral stu
dents.
"From a societal perspective, we
really need to provide access to
everyone," Benson said. "From an
economic perspective, energy needs
to be affordable to everyone."
Friedman concluded by telling
students in the audience who wanted
to make a difference in the develop
ment of clean energy to "get out of
Facebook and into somebody's
face."
"I'm kind of an old fart, but...
politics in this country is still analog,"
he added. "We need to be the regen
eration."
