## CANNABIS CONVERSATION Students and profs weigh in on Calif. prop to legalize marijuana 
### ZOELEAVTIT SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
On Nov. 2, California might just become the
envy of Bob Marley fans across the country.
Proposition 19, a measure that proposes le
galization of marijuana possession for adults
21 and over, has blazed up more emotional
reactions than iPod lighter apps at a Palo Alto High
School dance.
Many Stanford students view Proposition 19 which
is slated for the Nov. 2 California statewide ballot as a
natural step in light of California's budget issues, growing
cultural acceptance of marijuana and the dangerous as
pects of many currently legal drugs, such as alcohol and
OxyContin.
"I think it's really exciting that California might take
this step to be more responsible with substance abuse is
sues," said Brian Anderson, a Stanford medical student
who donated money to Yes on Proposition 19.
Fifteen states currently support legal medical marijua
na with Washington D.C. recently joining the list
but California stands poised to be the first state to legalize
personal, recreational use. Proposition 19 would allow for
regulation and taxation of marijuana much like alcohol
today.
Driving under the influence, selling to minors, using in
public or smoking in the presence of minors would remain
prohibited.
"As someone involved in medicine I think this is not
just a political thing but a medical thing, and having drugs
more regulated and hopefully from safer sources is a great
thing for public health," Anderson said.
While many state politicians still refuse to take strong
stands, groups ranging from the National Association for
the Advancement of Colored People to the American

Civil Liberties Union to the United Food and Com
mercial Workers Union, as well as a number of
police chiefs and district attor
neys, have endorsed Proposition
19. Increasing publicity surround
ing addiction to legal substances, such
las painkillers, in concurrence with mari
juana becoming more mainstream in pop
ular culture, has opened a wider variety of
groups to the idea of legalization than ever be
fore.
Many students seem to agree that in
comparison to the dangers of legal alcohol,
keeping marijuana banned makes little sense.
"People are more impaired [and] more likely to do
things that would hurt others around them when they're
drunk than when they're high," said Brittany Huggins 'l3.
Statistics back up the dangers of alcohol, with some cit
ing more than 85,000 alcohol-related deaths in America
per year, as well as medically related issues such as fetal al
cohol syndrome, exacerbation of domestic violence and
traffic accidents. However, for the simple reason that mar
ijuana is currently illegal, few reliable studies on its effects
exist. Should Proposition 19 pass, therefore, California will
serve as something of a great American experiment.
"I think if California is the first to do it, a lot of states
will follow," said Nicole Brooks *ll.
Proposition 19, however, may have more than just po
litical effects. If marijuana becomes legal, estimates from
the Research and Development Corporation show the
drug's price may drop by 80 percent, establishing the
Golden State as a nationwide dispensary of marijuana at
Costco-like prices.
Proponents of legalizing marijuana believe it will de
crease gang violence and Mexican cartels, but Keith
Humphreys, professor of psychiatry and behavioral sci
ences, believes it may actually create stronger gang activ
ity in smuggling cannabis across state lines.
"If our price drops 80 percent, all the drug rings are
going to do the smart thing and set up operations in Cal
ifornia," Humphreys said. "They'd be foolish not to."
Humphreys, who served last year in the Obama ad
ministration as senior policy advisor at the White House
Office of National Drug Control Policy, has worked to
reduce criminal penalties for crack cocaine and other
drugs. He believes that states have a lot of work to do in
creating humane drug policy, but that Proposition 19
would likely hurt public health by giving rise to new mar
ijuana mega-corporations, in the model of Big Tobacco.
"This law hands another product to market to tobacco
companies or creates a doppelganger that will lobby with
them," Humphreys said. "I don't want to see some 16-
year-old kid who smokes a joint have his life ruined, but.
.. this law is not just legalized use, it's legalized corporate

ownership [and] legalized marketing."
Humphreys predicts that tobacco companies, which
have been poised and ready to accept cannabis into their
product line since the 19705, will align their aggressive
marketing tactics and billions of dollars in lobbying power
to gain control of cannabis in California.
"It's taken us 40 years to bring tobacco companies
even modestly to heel, and tobacco still kills 40,000 people
per year," he said. "How about let's show we can regulate
one industry that sells an addictive plant before we take
on another."
Is legalization of marijuana a step toward common
sense and greater personal freedom or a submission
under the heels of powerful corporate interests? Either
way, the impetus of California's budget crisis,coupled with
the lure of tax revenue from legalized marijuana, takes the
issue out of morality and emotion and into the realm of
cold, hard cash.
To a state drowning in debt, the $l4 billion in under
ground cash flow that marijuana currently generates in
California runs frustratingly untouchable. If legalized,
state tax collectors estimate new revenue up to $1.3 billion
per year.
"Proposition 19 is a great thing for California," Brooks
said. "It might not be the best way to solve the deficit, but
I don't think Proposition 19 would hurt it."
The illegal activity policy at Stanford tends to focus on
safety and trust rather than on policing every infraction.
However, would state-sanctioned marijuana use lead to
students lighting up on every rooftop, tendrils of smoke
smothering Hoover Tower and Introduction to the Hu
manities books left unread by dilated pupils?
"I'm kind of surprised that as an institution, Stanford
hasn't started gauging student interest on the issue,"
Brooks said. "I would hope that Stanford would at least
have a discussion for example, we have AlcoholEdu
but no DrugEdu."
While overall, Stanford students trend toward either
favoring Proposition 19 or apathy in typical Stanford
political form knowing they'll be able to rely on a com
prehensive set of University guidelines in the event of le
galization is reassuring to many.
But even without Stanford intervention, the unwaver
ing belief in Stanford students' ability to moderate them
selves, to keep that duck paddle going through tempta
tion, remains strong.
"The amount of people doing stupid things on mari
juana will increase for a short time, but once people get
over the shock it will go back down," Huggins predicted.
"I think more people would be willing to try it if it
weren't illegal," she added. "But a lot of people would stop
because it would no longer be such a rebellious thing."
