### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Elizabeth Titos 
Republican Senate candidate Carly Fiorina '76 met with
35 Graduate School of Business students in Palo Alto on
Thursday to discuss jobs and economic growth.
The campaign stop came with just more than a month
until the Nov. 2 election, in which Fiorina faces incumbent
Democrat Barbara Boxer. Throughout the race, the candi
dates have sparred over each other's job plans, an issue hang
ing heavy over a state with 12.4 percent unemployment.
The Public Management Initiative, a nonpartisan
group of Stanford business students taking part in the
school's certificate-granting Public Management Pro
gram, invited Fiorina to Palo Alto. Its objective is to "have
intelligent, thoughtful debates about the key challenges
facing the United States right now," said member Evan
Brown, a second-year M.B.A. student who introduced
Fiorina on Thursday.
"She showed an interest in meeting with students who
were going to be joining the workforce soon and having a
very open discussion with students from all political affil
iations," Brown added.
The business students met Fiorina at noon at Lavanda
Restaurant on University Avenue, according to a cam
paign spokesperson. Brown said Fiorina spoke for 20
minutes before taking questions for 40 minutes from stu
dents about American innovation, business regulation
and how she would address the federal deficit.
"We had a real diversity of questions on political is
sues," Brown said. "I think the students were very satisfied
with how it went."
The group plans to invite Boxer to meet with students
later this quarter.
Earlier this week, Fiorina was in Sacramento for a
forum with the Asian Pacific Islander American Public
Affairs Association. On Wednesday, she and Boxer met
on public radio for a debate, their second of the campaign.
A poll by the Public Policy Institute of California this week
showed Boxer holding a seven-point lead over Fiorina.
Fiorina is a former executive at HP, founded by Stan
ford alumni David Packard '34 and William Hewlett '34,
and headquartered in Palo Alto. She holds a bachelor's
degree in history from Stanford. She and her husband live
in Los Altos Hills, according to her campaign.
