## Researchers fuel plants with slop 
### CAROLINE CHEN STAFF WRITER 
Wastewater treatment and aero
nautics do not tend to go hand in hand,
but two Stanford professors and an in
novative graduate student are using
rocket technology to make wastewater
treatment systems more sustainable.
In a nutshell, the idea is to use bac
teria to convert nitrous oxide, a
byproduct of wastewater treatment
plants normally viewed as an unwant
ed greenhouse gas, into air (pure nitro
gen and oxygen gas), in the process
producing both heat energy and
methane that can be used as fuel.
The ultimate goal is to use these

conversion processes to power the en
tire treatment plant, making it not only
sustainable, but also emissions-free.
It may not sound glamorous, but
treatment plants currently use signifi
cant amounts of energy. In fact, the
local wastewater treatment plant is the
one of the largest electricity consumers
in Palo Alto, according to aeronautics
and astronautics Prof. Brian Cantwell.
"If there is away to derive
[methane] from this kind of biological
source, you're carbon-neutral because
you're not bringing it out of the
ground," he said. "We think, using this
approach, a wastewater plant could
produce enough energy so it could be
energy self-sufficient."

Cantwell works on this venture
with civil and environmental engineer
ing Prof. Craig Criddle and fourth-year
doctoral student Yaniv Scherson.
The idea began in 2008, when Sch
erson was seeking a topic for his doc
toral thesis. Having used nitrous oxide
as fuel for rockets, Scherson began
looking at other ways to use the gas.
"Nitrous oxide is also a greenhouse
gas 310 times more powerful than car
bon oxide," he said. "Since I had an ef
ficient way to get rid of a greenhouse
gas... I thought this could be a great
source of clean energy and removal of
a greenhouse gas. I started to look for
