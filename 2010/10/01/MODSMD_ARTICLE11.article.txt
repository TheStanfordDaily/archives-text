## Researchers fuel plants with slop 
### CAROLINE CHEN STAFF WRITER 
Wastewater treatment and aero
nautics do not tend to go hand in hand,
but two Stanford professors and an in
novative graduate student are using
rocket technology to make wastewater
treatment systems more sustainable.
In a nutshell, the idea is to use bac
teria to convert nitrous oxide, a
byproduct of wastewater treatment
plants normally viewed as an unwant
ed greenhouse gas, into air (pure nitro
gen and oxygen gas), in the process
producing both heat energy and
methane that can be used as fuel.
The ultimate goal is to use these

conversion processes to power the en
tire treatment plant, making it not only
sustainable, but also emissions-free.
It may not sound glamorous, but
treatment plants currently use signifi
cant amounts of energy. In fact, the
local wastewater treatment plant is the
one of the largest electricity consumers
in Palo Alto, according to aeronautics
and astronautics Prof. Brian Cantwell.
"If there is away to derive
[methane] from this kind of biological
source, you're carbon-neutral because
you're not bringing it out of the
ground," he said. "We think, using this
approach, a wastewater plant could
produce enough energy so it could be
energy self-sufficient."

Cantwell works on this venture
with civil and environmental engineer
ing Prof. Craig Criddle and fourth-year
doctoral student Yaniv Scherson.
The idea began in 2008, when Sch
erson was seeking a topic for his doc
toral thesis. Having used nitrous oxide
as fuel for rockets, Scherson began
looking at other ways to use the gas.
"Nitrous oxide is also a greenhouse
gas 310 times more powerful than car
bon oxide," he said. "Since I had an ef
ficient way to get rid of a greenhouse
gas... I thought this could be a great
source of clean energy and removal of
a greenhouse gas. I started to look for


ANASTASIA YEE/The Stanford Daily
'free' sources on nitrous oxide, [and]
my search led me to Professor Crid
dle."
Criddle, an expert on wastewater
treatment, then helped Scherson to
develop the project.
There are two steps to the pro
posed process. The key step is to use
methane gas to power the plant and
convert nitrous oxide into energy and
clean air. In order to do this, plants
need to first increase the amount of
methane and nitrous oxide being pro
duced.
Cantwell explained that this idea is
innovative because wastewater re
searchers have conventionally fo
cused their attention on minimizing,
not maximizing, nitrous oxide produc
tion.

"People who work in the field of
wastewater don't think of the energy,"
Cantwell said. "And propulsion re
searchers and wastewater researchers
rarely cross paths. In many ways, we
would have still been wandering in the
desert looking for an application of
our thruster technology if we hadn't
come across the wastewater re
searchers."
Cantwell explained that maximiz
ing nitrous oxide would surprisingly
save treatment plants a lot of money.
Currently, plants use oxygen-hun
gry processes to minimize nitrous
oxide production, and the process of
pumping oxygen into the wastewater
is both costly and energy-consuming.
However, the bacteria-driven process
they propose requires much lower
oxygen levels than conventional prac
tices.
For now, Scherson, Criddle and
Cantwell are still researching ways to
maximize the amount of nitrous
oxide produced at treatment plants.

Cantwell predicts that research will
continue for a couple of years before
they can seek out a municipal treat
ment plant and create a pilot pro
gram.

But a number of facilities have al
ready expressed interest in partnering
with Stanford for a pilot program,
which could lead to larger-scale proj
ects, Cantwell said.
Scherson's enthusiasm for the pro
ject's potential is unbounded.
"This treatment process could be
implemented at a city scale like San
Jose, a high rise building in Manhattan
or a small village in the developing
world," he said. " I envision every
water treatment facility in the U.S. and
many world-wide retrofitting their
water treatment plants from the ener
gy pigs that they are today to efficient,
low-cost, possible no energy cost
treatment facilities."
