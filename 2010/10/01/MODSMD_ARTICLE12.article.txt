If you build it, they will come.
And in border enforcement, if you
build it higher, they will still come.
That was part of the hard look
Wayne Cornelius, director of the
Center for Immigration Studies at
UC-San Diego, took at the effec
tiveness of U.S. border enforce
ment in a talk at Stanford on Thurs
day.
Cornelius founded the Mexican

Migration Field Research and
Training Program, which studies
immigration from three Mexican
regions: Jalisco, Oaxaca and the Yu
catan. Forty years of field research
in Mexico and the U.S. provided
him with first-hand accounts of
legal and illegal immigration.
More than 4,800 surveys show il
legal border crossing remains high
although the U.S. has spent $17.1
billion on immigration enforce
