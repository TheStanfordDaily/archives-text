If you build it, they will come.
And in border enforcement, if you
build it higher, they will still come.
That was part of the hard look
Wayne Cornelius, director of the
Center for Immigration Studies at
UC-San Diego, took at the effec
tiveness of U.S. border enforce
ment in a talk at Stanford on Thurs
day.
Cornelius founded the Mexican

Migration Field Research and
Training Program, which studies
immigration from three Mexican
regions: Jalisco, Oaxaca and the Yu
catan. Forty years of field research
in Mexico and the U.S. provided
him with first-hand accounts of
legal and illegal immigration.
More than 4,800 surveys show il
legal border crossing remains high
although the U.S. has spent $17.1
billion on immigration enforce

Wayne Cornelius explains why the U.S. Mexico border remains vulnerable to illegal
immigration despite the nation's border-security efforts.
ment this year alone, he said. Sixty
percent of immigrants crossing the
US-Mexico border succeed on
their first try and 90 percent of
those actually detained by border
patrol still end up successful.
He added that border patrol has
increased four-fold since 1992,
adding 600 miles of fencing that
costs up to $l6 million per mile.
"It's our own great wall," Cor
nelius said, referring to a section in
the Otay Mountains of San Diego
County.
But rather than stopping illegal
immigration flow, the fences have
only diverted it, he said. Migrants
can simply tunnel under, climb
over fences or trek across deserts
or the Rio Grande. In fact, smug
gling migrants has increased dras
tically as prospective immigrants
search for new and safer, though

sometimes more expensive, ways
to cross the border.
These detours have generated
close t014,000 deaths, he said. "It's
a slow-motion death across the
Southwest."
Cornelius suggests a cheaper al
ternative to current U.S. border
policy: a more generous guest work
program, an increase in permanent
legal immigrant admissions and an
increase in the number of green
cards the U.S. awards.
Cornelius' statistics were com
pelling enough to astonish some
members of the audience.
"I was really surprised to hear
the incredible amount of spending
that has gone into border enforce
ment with almost no results to
show for it," Omar Media 'l3 said.
"That's $3O billion down the drain.
This only reinforces the idea that
the U.S. must adopt comprehensive
immigration reform now. We can't
afford not to."
