## A 						NEW APP, JUST FOR KICKS Two alumni introduce the "scalpel" of social networking applications

A simple dinner off campus is scheduled for
Saturday at 7 p.m. Then Mark can't make it
because he has a meeting, and Liz might be an
hour late. Now Tom's not too excited, with
Mark and Liz out. "We'll find another time,"
they say. Of course, the dinner never happens.
In short, scheduling fun is pretty much no fun.
That's why Stanford alumni Henry Lee 'OB and Am
bert Ho 'O6 created Kickin.it, a mobile application that
they say cuts out the headache of planning gatherings
ahead of time and allows them to happen spontaneously.
"A lot of the vision of the product comes from our so
cial interactions while we were in college," Ho said. "The
idea is that we're making a product that's extremely easy
to share who you're with in the context of what you're

doing, and then also make it as easy as possible to find out
who to hang out with."
The application is a live-stream communication plat
form with origins in the founders' days as students broad
casting various campus events. Two things happened that
triggered the inspiration to use real-time technology in
their business venture. First, through a Fleet Street con
cert broadcast they met an alum and seasoned Silicon Val
ley veteran who later became one of Kickin.it's advisors.
Second, they raised a good chunk of change for Dance
Marathon by broadcasting the event a little fist pump
in the air that, according to Ho, led them to think, "Okay,
let's just do something that's purely helpful and we'll go
from there and see how it goes."
Here's how Kickin.it works. Users can post what they
are doing to a network of friends by inputting their activ
ities as an update, dubbed a "hangout." They may desig
nate the time of the event as "now," "soon" or "later," tag
friends who are present and invite others to join. For ex
ample, a Kickin.it hangout might read, "Watching 'How I
Met Your Mother' while making pasta in my room with
John Doe and Jane Doe."

Kickin.it founders Henry Lee '08, left, and Ambert Ho '06, right, show off their new live-stream communication
platform, which they say makes planning social activities precise and easy, even on the go.
What makes the impromptu get
togethers possible is the applica
tion's ability to allow users to contin
uously tag friends, augmenting the
hangout as attendees appear. It takes
the guesswork out of choosing
whether to partake in an event de
pending on the crowd, or when the
optimum time to pop up might be.
"Right now we're operating
under the assumption that location is
important, but the primary impor
tance is who it is," Ho said.
In fact, the whole thing seems like
a combination of Facebook status
updates, Facebook Places and Face
book Events, all bundled into a sin
gle user interface.
"We're absolutely optimizing for
a very lightweight mobile experi
ence," Lee said. "It's very clean, and
you don't have to sift through the
Facebook clutter."
But like many applications nowa
days, Kickin.it may be integrated
with Facebook via Facebook Con
nect. Down the road, Lee and Ho
hope to tighten privacy settings and
categorize friend groups such that
only specific people may view the
hangouts. After all, you likely don't
want some creeper joining in on your
pasta-making party.

"We understand that privacy is
definitely a big concern, particular
ly for Stanford students, and Face
book has screwed the pooch a cou
ple times," Lee said. "We're moving
toward a more powerful product
optimized for a subset of your Face
book friends the people you in
teract with in real life or maybe
even those you would like to inter
act with."
"If Facebook is a chainsaw, we're
trying to be a scalpel," Ho added.
For Lee and Ho, the poor job
market presented an opportunity to
take a chance, mobilize their savings

and go forth with an idea.
"These breaks are how you pro
pel your life forward," Ho said.
They could not stress enough the
role the Stanford community contin
ues to play in the development of
their product.
"We've seen how the current stu
dents are helpful in just talking to
them, trying to learn from them, and
the community in all facets was help
ful in encouraging our startup ef
forts," Lee said.
