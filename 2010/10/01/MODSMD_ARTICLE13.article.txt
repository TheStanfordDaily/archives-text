A simple dinner off campus is scheduled for
Saturday at 7 p.m. Then Mark can't make it
because he has a meeting, and Liz might be an
hour late. Now Tom's not too excited, with
Mark and Liz out. "We'll find another time,"
they say. Of course, the dinner never happens.
In short, scheduling fun is pretty much no fun.
That's why Stanford alumni Henry Lee 'OB and Am
bert Ho 'O6 created Kickin.it, a mobile application that
they say cuts out the headache of planning gatherings
ahead of time and allows them to happen spontaneously.
"A lot of the vision of the product comes from our so
cial interactions while we were in college," Ho said. "The
idea is that we're making a product that's extremely easy
to share who you're with in the context of what you're

doing, and then also make it as easy as possible to find out
who to hang out with."
The application is a live-stream communication plat
form with origins in the founders' days as students broad
casting various campus events. Two things happened that
triggered the inspiration to use real-time technology in
their business venture. First, through a Fleet Street con
cert broadcast they met an alum and seasoned Silicon Val
ley veteran who later became one of Kickin.it's advisors.
Second, they raised a good chunk of change for Dance
Marathon by broadcasting the event a little fist pump
in the air that, according to Ho, led them to think, "Okay,
let's just do something that's purely helpful and we'll go
from there and see how it goes."
Here's how Kickin.it works. Users can post what they
are doing to a network of friends by inputting their activ
ities as an update, dubbed a "hangout." They may desig
nate the time of the event as "now," "soon" or "later," tag
friends who are present and invite others to join. For ex
ample, a Kickin.it hangout might read, "Watching 'How I
Met Your Mother' while making pasta in my room with
John Doe and Jane Doe."
