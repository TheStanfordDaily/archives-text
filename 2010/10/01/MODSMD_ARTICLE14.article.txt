## EDITORIAL Concerns of first-generation students must remain a priority 
### 
Stanford's commitment to financial aid and
diversity has attracted students from
many backgrounds to apply for admis
sion. However, students can attest: the story
doesn't end at admission. After the long, gruel
ing application process, surviving rigorous
Stanford academics is yet another battle.
Though all admits are claimed as the best and
brightest, certain students tend to fare better
than others.
Background has proved to play an important
role in a student's ability to do well in college. In
the past, students and faculty alike have argued
that admits of different backgrounds would
need different resources. As a result, community
centers emerged over several decades to sup
port these students, ranging from the Black
Community Services Center (BCSC) and El
Centro Chicano to the Native American Com
munity Center (NACC) and the Asian Ameri
can Activities Center (A3C).
However, while there are ample resources
for students of color, Stanford has long over
looked the role that socioeconomic status or
class play in a student's development in a col
lege setting.
The editorial board supports the Office of
the Vice Provost for Student Affairs' effort to in
clude socioeconomic differences in the diversi
ty discussion. The office is searching for a new
associate dean and director of diversity and
first-generation programs, a hire that will help
more students navigate their Stanford experi
ences. The position replaces a similar one cut in
2009 over budget concerns. An anonymous
donor has come forward to fund the new posi
tion for five years.
Issues of socioeconomic status are often
thrown into the same messy pile as issues of
race. While both affect students' college experi
ences, socioeconomic levels have a different ef
fect than race. Although ethnic community cen
ters are sufficient for helping students bridge ac
ademic and social gaps, people often overlook
the fact that socioeconomic status transcends
racial boundaries.
At first glance, African-Americans and

Africans appear to be "covered" by the BCSC,
the Latino community by El Centro Chicano,
the Native Americans by the NACC and
Asians-Americans by the A3C. It is easy to con
clude that the only minority group that the new
dean would be helping are socioeconomically
disadvantaged Caucasians.
But issues of class and race do not intermin
gle so clearly.
The creation of the dean's position marks
Stanford's acknowledgement that rifts beyond
race exist in the overall Stanford community.
First-generation and low-income students need
to overcome many issues that don't necessarily
have anything to do with race.
A production by STAMP, the social protest
theatre company, in spring 2010 brought to light
such challenges. Soliciting monologues from
anonymous students from the first-generation
and low-income communities, the play "Wealth
of Words" highlighted the challenges that these
students face when trying to fit in with their
peers. The script included horror stories ranging
from discriminatory remarks made in IHUM
discussions about the poor to the hesitation of
taking unpaid internships because of financial
difficulties to the frustration of lacking parental
connections because of their first-generation
status. These are only some examples of unique
obstacles that first-generation and low-income
students deal with.
The population of low-income and first-gen
eration students is also growing, possibly due to
recent financial aid initiatives. According to
Dean of Admission Richard Shaw, 15.2 percent
of Stanford undergraduates are first-genera
tion. Additionally, 14 percent of undergraduates
in 2008-2009 received a federal Pell Grant,
which is often used as a standard for assessing
low-income status.
Stanford is making important strides toward
improving the undergraduate experience with
the creation of the associate dean and director
of diversity and first-generation job. Fie or she
will be an invaluable resource. If we wish to con
tinue to uphold the founding mission of the
University, the concerns of first-generation stu
dents must remain a priority.
