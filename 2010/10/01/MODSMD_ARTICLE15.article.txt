# OH, SWEET NUTHIN'!
## Guerilla Trends 
### Roseann Cima 
Some of my time this summer was spent
"vandalizing." A friend and I chalked a
few reproductions of famous paintings
on University surfaces. It started the day be
fore Bastille Day when my friend, both artist
and Francophile, called me with a suggestion
for celebration: chalking "Liberty Leading the
People" as a mural on the stage behind White
Plaza.
I consider myself neither artist nor Fran
cophile, but was more than grateful for the
diversion. We enjoyed it enough that time
that we put up a few more reproductions in
different locations. In the little vacuum of a
summer research position, the only public re
action that made its way back to me was a
blurb in the police crawl about graffiti, "not
believed to be gang-related or hate-motivat
ed." But when I moved back onto campus for
manager training, I was delighted to find that
people had chalked their own abstract designs
alongside "Liberty," and everybody was talk
ing about the wall. I listened anonymously,
and then introduced myself to take the credit.
Indulgent, I know.
"I think it's good," someone said. "It can
become, like, public art space now."
The phenomenon he referred to is well
noted in the world of design. As Jane Suri puts
it, we learn patterns of behavior from others.
All that needs is for those patterns to be pub
licly established. Stack a few dirty dishes on an
empty surface in a cafe, and pretty soon the
counter will be full with everyone else's. Start
leaving your fruit stickers on an unused bit of
wall space in Columbae, and by the end of the
year your managers will be cursing you for the
dense layer of paper and adhesive they're
going to have to scrape off. Mark a bathroom
stall in Meyer with a provocative bit of "poet
ry" and, well, we all know what hell can break

loose there.
Once we're aware of the tendency, we can
exploit it, in ways both big and small. The
street musician throws a few dollars and coins
out of his own purse into his case before set
ting up to play. And once "Liberty Leading"
was pictured on a pristine beige wall, it was
only a matter of time before she was followed.
What I saw at the start of September was a
plain wall inching its way over the tipping
point, in the Gladwellian sense, into a full
mural.
If it ever got there, I missed it. The wall was
hosed last week and the art replaced by some
cheesy pastel club promotion. Thinking about
it now, it could very possibly be a well-execut
ed post-modernist response, but I'm willing to
bet that it really is just the Plain Beige World
fighting back.
Just because they have water, though, does
n't mean they win. The burgeoning mural, to
me, seemed like the first step in transforming
White Plaza into a true center for student cul
ture. It communicated a sense of popular own
ership that I hadn't thought was possible on
campus.
So consider this a call to arms. We outnum
ber them. And chalk is cheap.
