# SENSE AND NONSENSE
## Science and Religion, Stanford Style 
### Aysha Bagchi 
The world is an unnerving place. Here
we are, these Homo sapiens in 2010,
who came into our biological selves
through evolutionary processes over the
span of millions of years. We developed the
ability to think about our condition and a
yearning to make sense of it. And we re
sponded with traditions that would help us
negotiate a life we could not explain.
Religions emerged and gave us some
(often loose) accounts of the origin of our
world, oriented us toward a conception of the
good life and instilled in us a sense of pur
pose. Humanistic traditions such as litera
ture, visual aesthetics and music stirred and
cultivated the feelings that led us to ask exis
tential questions, and in so doing helped in
fuse life with meaning and calm our disquiet.
Then reason and the empirical sciences
emerged on the front to lead us in our efforts
to finally conquer our condition, to scientifi
cally answer every question that had pushed
us from fact to ambiguity.
And this last tradition, according to Cam
b

■ridge and Caltech Professors Steven Hawk
ing and Leonard Mlodinow, is finally bring
ing us to the end of our search. Science is on
the brink of rendering religious traditions
those in which people ascribe purpose to
phenomena they cannot explain by reference
to God obsolete. In their recent book,
"The Grand Design," they tell us that the
laws of gravity and quantum theory allow
universes to appear spontaneously from
nothing, that "reason, mathematics and ex
perimental test" are about to deliver the final
stab to faith.

Being at Stanford, where such thoughts
from Hawking, Mlodinow and Richard
Dawkins find a natural stronghold, inclines
me to think that young people's belief that
science is finally threatening the intellectual
demise of religion is a new phenomenon. But
I see much to make me think otherwise.
William James describes in his 1896 essay
"The Will to Believe" that as soon as his Har-

vard students got "well imbued with the logi
cal spirit" they rejected philosophically the
lawfulness of voluntarily adopted faith. Fer
nando Pessoa, in his 1930s novel "The Book
of Disquiet," calls "the childhood of intelli
gence" that period "when we're attracted to
popular science and writings that attack reli
gion." While these trends may seem new in
the life of sophisticated 20-year-olds, in the
bigger scheme of things they are not.
On the one hand, it seems like a sign of
progress that students are, instead of sup
planting science with blind faith, supplanting
the unknowable with some dogma about
how we can, and perhaps already do, know it.
Isn't this, at least, a much less dangerous atti
tude to have than the superstitions that lead
parents to refuse blood transfusions for their
children, lead churches to condemn contra
ceptives, lead political leaders to turn to
prayer in trying moments that call for action?
Perhaps. But better still would be an attitude
that distinguished between superstition and
faith, that appreciated that faith and volition
play a role in the beliefs of atheists and deists
alike. As James points out, even our belief
that there is a truth, and that our minds and it
are made for each other, is but a "passionate
affirmation of desire, in which our social sys
tem backs us up." A brief dive into the actual
philosophical debates on all these questions
will illustrate that, for our greatest thinkers,
they are far from resolved.
Our passionate desire to rationalize the
world leads some students who have begun

to challenge their faith to decide there is no
God rather than live in a more difficult
limbo. It similarly leads students to relegate
the humanities and the arts, to dismiss pre
cious responses to the human condition as
meaningless because they fail to rationalize
our worlds. It precludes us from developing
the humility about our own beliefs that
would challenge our dogmatic instincts in
all spheres of life. And it makes us miss a
very obvious reality check: that the being
from-nothingness doctrine is not going to
convert anyone who is not already convert
ed. It is, as The Economist put it, "physics by
sound-bite." As Carlin Romano points out
in The Chronicle of Higher Education, we
do not know much about the universe that
is not astonishingly inferential. As time
goes on, we will progress, and questions will
persist.

This column is no denial of the absurdities
religion can cause. Its topic is instead about
the absurdities behind anti-religious dogma
tism.They include the failure to grasp that re
ligion is not going anywhere. If it will be sep
arated from superstitions that resist science,
it will do so when its critics earnestly prefer
reforming doctrine to scorning faith.
We live in a world full of uncertainty, of
experiences and emotions we cannot verbal
ize, of vanishing points of truth we will never
reach. Reconciling ourselves to that reality is
a difficult, often painful task. It asks us to re
sist wishful thinking. But doing so makes us
more robust, gives us a deeper appreciation
of the world, precludes logicians and scien
tists from becoming the next zealots in pur
suit of a hopeless cause. The diversity of be
liefs within each religion betrays how people
fill the voids in different ways. For many, per
haps most at Stanford, a designer cannot fill
them. But, Lord help us, let's not forget they
exist.
