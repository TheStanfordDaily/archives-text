# TOP-10 TITANS
## CARD AND DUCKS MEET IN CLASH OF UNBEATENS 
### KABIR SAWHNEY MANAGING EDITOR 
In its most important game since
the 2000 Rose Bowl, the No. 9 Stanford
football team will travel to Eugene,
Ore., this weekend to take on No. 4
Oregon. The game is receiving nation
al recognition and is being billed in
some corners as the de-facto Pac-10
championship game.
While the Ducks (4-0,1-0 Pac-10)
have been the favorite to win the con
ference since August, the Cardinal (4-
0,1-0) was thought of as a dark-horse
contender, picked to finish fourth in
the conference in the preseason
media poll.
The contest figures to be one of con
trasts, pitting Stanford head coach Jim
Harbaugh's physical, brute-force play
ing style against the finesse and gad
getry of Oregon head coach Chip
Kelly. Through its first four games, Har
baugh's team has played in no-non
sense fashion, emphasizing size and
power over speed and agility. Oppo
nents have often seen the Stanford of
fense lining up with six or seven offen
sive linemen with the clear intent of
simply overpowering the opposing
line. Tlie Cardinal has even used sixth
year senior lineman James McGillicud
dy as an eligible receiver on some
downs. Harbaugh will try to consistent
ly pound the Oregon defense, using
Stanford's superior physicality and of
fensive line to wear down the Ducks
and keep their offense off the field.
Meanwhile, the Oregon offense
employs an extremely potent
spread attack, which can score
points in bunches and keep the
Ducks in any game. They are able to
stretch the field using quarterback
Darron Thomas and a talented core
of receivers, which can open holes
for the speedy running back tandem
of LaMichael James and Kenjon
Barner.

Last season's clash at Stanford Sta
dium was a similar affair, with Stanford
rolling up points behind Heisman run

ner-upToby Gerhart and Oregon stag
ing a big comeback behind the play of
quarterback Jeremiah Masoli. Stan
ford eventually prevailed 51-42, deal
ing Oregon what turned out to be its
only Pac-10 loss of the season. This
year, the styles might be similar, but the
names will be different Gerhart
graduated and moved onto the NFL,
while Masoli was dismissed from the
Duck roster for off-field violations and
now plays for Ole Miss.
Unlike last year's meeting, both
teams enter Saturday with top-10 rank
ings and sky-high expectations. Over
the season's first four games, both have
proven themselves as capable con-

tenders.
Behind redshirt sophomore quar
terback Andrew Luck, Stanford's of
fense is currently fourth in the nation
in scoring. Luck has earned some
Heisman consideration after throw
ing for 912 yards and completing 62.7
percent of his passes over the Card's
first four games. He has also thrown 11
touchdowns while giving up just two
interceptions, both to the Fighting
Irish last weekend. Stanford's receiv
ing corps is strong as well, with junior
wide receiver Chris Owusu figuring to
be Luck's top target this weekend. Se
nior receiver Ryan Whalen, the leader
of the receiving corps, is questionable
for the game with an elbow injury, but
did practice this week.
Stanford's running game is anoth
er key component of its offense, and is
expected to make significant contri
butions on Saturday. While the Card
has been using a number of different

backs, sophomore Stepfan Taylor has
emerged as the key playmaker at the
position with 59 carries on the year,
more than double any other Stanford
player. Besides Taylor, the Cardinal
will rely on sophomore Tyler Gaffney,
redshirt freshman Usua Amanam and
true freshman Anthony Wilkerson to
generate yards on the ground.
This week's game may see the re
turn of senior running back Jeremy
Stewart to the depth chart. Stewart en
tered the season as one of Stanford's
main tailbacks, but suffered an ankle
injury in the first game of the season.
While Harbaugh has not indicated
whether or not Stewart will play, he was
in practice all week.
While the Cardinal offense certain
ly packs some firepower, Oregon
boasts one of the most explosive of
fenses in the country. At 57.8 points per
game, the Ducks have the top-ranked
offense in the country. The passing
game, led by Thomas and wide receiv
er Jeff Maehl, is the most potent attack
Stanford has faced all season. Howev
er, the main battle will be for control of
the line of scrimmage and the running
game. Led by James and Barner, Ore

gon boasts the fourth-best rushing at
tack in college football and will seek to
utilize that unit to score early and
often.
Both offensive units are among the
best in the nation, but the game is like
ly to come down to the play of each
team's defense. Stanford is ranked
12th nationally in scoring defense
while the Ducks are third.
The Cardinal defense is vastly im
proved this season, with a new defen
sive coordinator and a new 3-4
scheme. Stanford shut out UCLA
the same UCLA team that put up 34
points on Texas in Austin in the
Rose Bowl three weeks ago before
limiting Notre Dame to just a touch
down and two field goals last weekend.
Stanford will rely on its physical line
backersâ€” sophomore Shayne Skov,
senior Owen Marecic, redshirt junior
Thomas Keiser and redshirt sopho
more Chase Thomas to put pres
sure on Darron Thomas and shut
down James and Barner. Stanford's
secondary, which has been fairly effec
tive in shutting down opposing passing
games, also will be hard-pressed to
shut down Oregon's speedy receivers.

The unit is likely to be without junior
safety Michael Thomas, the star of the
secondary through the first four
games.
Despite these challenges, senior
cornerback Richard Sherman re
mained confident in the defense 's abil
ity to make plays.
"Every game is the same game
plan," Sherman said. "We have to go
in, prevent big plays and play hard.
Every week, we play a better oppo
nent, so we have to keep preparing the
same, and keep doing our jobs."
Oregon, meanwhile, is ranked 31st
in pass defense and 44th in rushing de
fense. The Ducks have yet to test them
selves against a truly elite opponent;
their toughest opponent so far has
been Arizona State, a team picked to
finish ninth in the Pac-lO.The Ducks do
possess a ball-hawking secondary ca
pable of generating turnovers. So far,
they have picked off nine passes, while
the offense has given up just three on
the year.

The game is likely to come down to
which defense is able to make a big play
late in the game. Both offenses are ca
pable of scoring and are likely to match

each other point for point. Whichever
defense can step up and make a critical
stop will go a long way in deciding who
leaves Eugene as the conference fa
vorite to make the Rose Bowl and pos
sibly the national title game.
Stanford will kick off against Ore
gon at 5 p.m. on Saturday at Autzen
Stadium in Eugene, Ore. The game will
be nationally televised on ABC. Addi
tionally, ESPN's College Game Day
program will be broadcasting from Eu
gene starting at 6 a.m.
