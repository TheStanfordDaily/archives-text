# TOP-10 TITANS
## CARD AND DUCKS MEET IN CLASH OF UNBEATENS 
### KABIR SAWHNEY MANAGING EDITOR 
In its most important game since
the 2000 Rose Bowl, the No. 9 Stanford
football team will travel to Eugene,
Ore., this weekend to take on No. 4
Oregon. The game is receiving nation
al recognition and is being billed in
some corners as the de-facto Pac-10
championship game.
While the Ducks (4-0,1-0 Pac-10)
have been the favorite to win the con
ference since August, the Cardinal (4-
0,1-0) was thought of as a dark-horse
contender, picked to finish fourth in
the conference in the preseason
media poll.
The contest figures to be one of con
trasts, pitting Stanford head coach Jim
Harbaugh's physical, brute-force play
ing style against the finesse and gad
getry of Oregon head coach Chip
Kelly. Through its first four games, Har
baugh's team has played in no-non
sense fashion, emphasizing size and
power over speed and agility. Oppo
nents have often seen the Stanford of
fense lining up with six or seven offen
sive linemen with the clear intent of
simply overpowering the opposing
line. Tlie Cardinal has even used sixth
year senior lineman James McGillicud
dy as an eligible receiver on some
downs. Harbaugh will try to consistent
ly pound the Oregon defense, using
Stanford's superior physicality and of
fensive line to wear down the Ducks
and keep their offense off the field.
Meanwhile, the Oregon offense
employs an extremely potent
spread attack, which can score
points in bunches and keep the
Ducks in any game. They are able to
stretch the field using quarterback
Darron Thomas and a talented core
of receivers, which can open holes
for the speedy running back tandem
of LaMichael James and Kenjon
Barner.

Last season's clash at Stanford Sta
dium was a similar affair, with Stanford
rolling up points behind Heisman run

ner-upToby Gerhart and Oregon stag
ing a big comeback behind the play of
quarterback Jeremiah Masoli. Stan
ford eventually prevailed 51-42, deal
ing Oregon what turned out to be its
only Pac-10 loss of the season. This
year, the styles might be similar, but the
names will be different Gerhart
graduated and moved onto the NFL,
while Masoli was dismissed from the
Duck roster for off-field violations and
now plays for Ole Miss.
Unlike last year's meeting, both
teams enter Saturday with top-10 rank
ings and sky-high expectations. Over
the season's first four games, both have
proven themselves as capable con-
