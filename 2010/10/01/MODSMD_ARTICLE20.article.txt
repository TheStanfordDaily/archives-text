## BRING ON THE BEARS Rebounding Card takes on Cal 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford men's soccer team (4-4-0)
will face a stiff test as it opens Pac-10 play
at home on Saturday night against No. 16
Cal (6-2-1).
Four straight losses to open the season
meant that the Cardinal's preseason rank
ing went out the window, but the players
believe they have hit their stride just in the
nick of time.
"We dug ourselves a really big hole by
losing the first four games, but everyone is
really confident now, said junior defender
Tommy Ryan. "We look at it as though we
are going into Pac-lOs with essentially a
clean slate. Four and four [wins and losses]
might as well be 0-0."
The Cardinal's defense has certainly
stepped up this year, allowing just eight
goals in eight games. Redshirt freshman
Jason Dodson has stepped into the role
of starting goalie decisively his goals
against average is a stingy 0.98.
The offense, often dormant in the first
four games, has really come into its own
during the four-game winning streak. Se
nior forward Dominique Yahyavi leads
the team with four goals on just 10 shots.
Senior defender Bobby Warshaw has
been his usual dominant self, controlling
the back line and getting forward
enough to score three goals, including
two game-winners. In one of the early
front-runners for goal of the year
against St. Mary's, Warshaw found him
self alone on the back post after a de
flected corner kick, and executed a re
markable bicycle kick past the stunned
Gaels goalkeeper.
For its part, Cal looks to be a worthy
adversary, coming into the game with a
No. 16 ranking and a four-match unbeat
en streak. But the Golden Bears' most
recent game was a 2-2 draw with Denver,
a team which Stanford beat 1-0 last Sun
day. And the Bears were lucky not to
have lost they scored an equalizer
with just 54 seconds left.
With the Cardinal on a roll and Cal ex
periencing somewhat of a drop-off from
some stellar play to open the season, this
Saturday's matchup looks promising. But

Cal has historically given Stanford fits on
the soccer field.
Stanford has had one win over its cross
town rivals in the last nine years, and the
Bears have won the last four meetings, all
with a score of 1-0.
But the players insist that what happened
in the past has nothing to do with prepar
ing for this game.
"We only focus one game on at time,"
said sophomore defender Hunter
Gorskie. "We have been watching film,
studying their tendencies, and from a
preparation standpoint I think we are real
ly solid," he said. "Once that game is over
we look to the next team."
The team will benefit from having only
one game this weekend after a loaded
schedule to this point.
"This was the fourth week in a row we
had Friday-Sunday games," said head
coach Bret Simon. "It's a really heavy load
for the players, and with some of the in
juries we've had, it's asking a lot."
Regardless of the tough schedule and
early season struggles, the Cardinal needs to
get off to a good start in Pac-10 play if it
wants to have any chance to get back to the
NCAA Tournament. After the game
against Cal, the team hits the road against
Washington and Oregon State before com
ing home to face UCLA and San Diego
State.
Of the six teams in the soccer version of
the Pac-10, only Stanford and Oregon
State are unranked Washington (6-1-1)
is currently No. 23, San Diego State (6-1-1)
is No. 22, UCLA (5-2-1) is No. 20 and Cal is
No. 16. Despite being unranked, Oregon
State is 5-2.
Remembering that Stanford was
picked to finish second in the preseason
media poll, Simon remains undaunted by
the crowded field.
"This year is really wide open," he said.
"Everyone in the Pac-10 started well, and I
think that any of the teams is capable of
winning, which isn't always the case. We've
gotten ourselves in a position to be back in
the picture for the NCAA Tournament,
and every game is going to be very inter
esting. I don't see anyone running the
table."
For the Cardinal to take home its first
Pac-10 title since Simon's first year on the
Farm in 2001, it must keep its momentum
rolling and prove that the play of the last
four games and not the first four is
what fans should expect to see the rest of
the year.
Kickoff at Laird Q. Cagan Stadium is
scheduled for 7 p.m. on Saturday.
