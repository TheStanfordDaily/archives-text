## Student tickets to USC football game sold out 
### â€” Kabir Sawhney 
Stanford Athletics' allotment of
4,500 student tickets for next Satur
day's home football game against
Southern California has been fully
distributed, according to GoStan
ford.com.
At 8 a.m. on Wednesday morning,
ticket registration went live, and the
system promptly crashed due to the
volume of students attempting to log
on.
By Wednesday evening, a number
of students reported difficulties in
acquiring tickets, and the link to USC
student tickets no longer appeared
on the "Student Tickets" home page
on the Stanford Athletics website.
On Thursday morning, the website
confirmed that all tickets had indeed
been sold out.
Students were notified of the
need to register via a campus-wide e
mail on Tuesday.
Stanford Athletics implemented
the system due to expectations of
high attendance in light of the Stan
ford football team's recent on-field
success. The Oct. 9 game against USC
is expected to sell out, so ticket buy
ers are expected to fill seats adjacent
to the student section. When atten
dance is low, students can usually
overflow into these sections with lit
tle difficulty, but since the game is
likely to be fully sold out, there is
nowhere in Stanford Stadium to
place extra students.
