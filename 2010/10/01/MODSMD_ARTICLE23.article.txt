# Reworking Red Zone rewards
## 
### Tom Taylor 
One of the great things
about being at Stanford
is free access to most
sports on campus
(everything but men's
basketball, at least).
Every student on the Farm can join
the Red Zone, the official student fan
club, simply by going to a game with a
Stanford ID card. For just showing your
face you reap some pretty nice benefits:
a free weekly e-mail from Stanford
Athletics (though not everyone might
view that as a benefit!), a free T-shirt (as
suming you get in early enough and
your size is still available, otherwise you
might be wearing either a tent or an ex
tremely figure-hugging number) and
enrollment in the Red Zone Loyalty
Program (which basically decides
whether or not you get to go to the Big
Game).
Now don't get me wrong, the fact
that the athletics department gives free
access to games, plus a free T-shirt, is
nothing to be sniffed at, but I am not a
huge fan of the loyalty points system.
Perhaps there needs to be away to give
some preference to the most commit
ted fans among the student body to at
tend the Big Game (especially with it
being held across the Bay this year), but
I don't think the current system really
achieves that.

There are a total of 13 points up for
grabs this year, with nine guaranteeing
you a free ticket. However, one of those
points is not available until after the Big
Game (that is, it will only count towards
next year) and new students may be an
noyed to discover that another was
handed out at the Spring Game
(played far back in April, before they
were privileged enough to own an
SUID). For a lot of people this means
there are only realistically 11 points
they can rack up.
Miss either of the Washington State
or Arizona games, which count for three
points apiece, and your hopes of that
free ticket are history. And now that
Stanford Athletics has limited the num
ber of students allowed into the USC
game, the required number of points is
even more difficult to accrue.

Perhaps, you might say, that is the point:
you have to be a diehard fan and go to
every game to deserve a free ticket. But
that's just not realistic. Consider, for ex
ample, two extremes. For example's
sake, I'll use Alice and Bob.
Alice: Can't get enough of college
football and goes to every single game,
except one. She always arrives at the
stadium early to get a front row seat and
stays to the very end, win or lose. Unfor
tunately the game she misses is Ari
zona, because of a family commitment
that weekend eight points.
Bob: Likes the atmosphere of
games, but can't quite find the time or
enthusiasm to stay for all four quarters
and often just drifts by on his way else
where, making sure to rack up enough
points to go to the Big Game. Unfortu
nately he's out of town for the Washing
ton State game, so leaves his card with a
friend to get it swiped â€”ll points.
Which of these two is the most loyal
Red Zone member? Who really de
serves that ticket?
The Red Zone also claims to be the
fan club for all sports, not just football. A
quick glance at where you can earn
points for loyalty shows only two of the
other sports are represented. There are
probably very few, but there might just
be some students who watch at least
one home event in each of the 35 differ
ent varsity sports. Surely anyone who
does that this year, shows that sort of
loyalty to the Cardinal cause, should be
worthy of a free ticket to next year's Big
Game, regardless of how many football
games they attend.
Perhaps Stanford Athletics could
turn the loyalty scheme into some kind
of credit card-style rewards program.
You would earn points on your SUID
for showing up at games, with different
numbers of points awarded for different
events, but crucially, with the chance of
earning something at any event no mat
ter how small. Then you could spend
them however you like: Maybe 100
points buys you a Big Game ticket, 50
points a T-shirt. You could even use
points toward Sixth Man membership,
get game tickets for friends or vouchers
for the Athletics Shop.
This way, maybe football games
wouldn't be quite as full as they are now,
but the average student representation
at sports events across campus would
be much bigger, creating greater home
advantage and maybe even more suc
cess. Plus, there would also be a lot less
reason to cheat the system if you hon
estly can't make it to one of those
points-heavy football games, because
you could easily catch up elsewhere.
And for those committed souls who
manage to go to all 35 sports in one
year? You should get a medal.

Tom Taylor just wants to earn points
that could buy him a fancy T-shirt. Se
riously, those things are like 25 bucks.
