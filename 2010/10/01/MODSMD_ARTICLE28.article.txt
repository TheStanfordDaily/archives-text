As China gains ascendancy in
the global arena, more and
more Americans find them
selves across the Pacific, trying to
make sense of the foreign and often
very confusing society around them.
Author Deborah Fallows was one
such expatriate; she and her hus
band, the acclaimed writer and jour
nalist James Fallows, spent three
years living and working in Shanghai
and Beijing. Upon returning to the
States, she found a need to organize,
in her own mind, her diverse experi

ences a project that eventually
became the book "Dreaming in
Chinese: Mandarin Lessons in Life,
Love and Language."
Embarking upon a cross-coun
try tour promoting her memoir,
Deborah Fallows spoke at the
Stanford Bookstore on Wednesday
evening to a modest but enthusias
tic turnout. She chose to read only
a few short passages from the book,
instead relying upon her dynamic
and humorous stage presence to
engage her audience. She explained

that most of her peers fellow
foreigners in China found their
own unique ways to approach the
daunting task of learning how to
live in China. Her particular avenue
was language.
Fallows, despite her doctorate in
linguistics from Harvard, had her
share of awkwardly funny, some
times surreal encounters with both
the Chinese language and its speak
ers. She recounted, complete with
hand gestures, the first time she
attempted to order takeout from a

local restaurant: the waiter taking
her order could not understand a
word she said and ended up calling
for backup. He and most of the
kitchen staff, after having her repeat
herself over and over, concluded that
she was asking for a big hug.
Fallows' book is full of similarly
amusing anecdotes laced with
enduring compassion and fondness
for the ordinary people she encoun

tered on the street. Unlike many
other authors who write about
China, including her husband, she
only briefly mentions politics, eco
nomics and sweeping social reform,
focusing instead on the rhythms of
everyday life and interpersonal
interaction. She tells stories of
matchmaking mothers and street
