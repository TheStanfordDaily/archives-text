For those who still think
women can't be funny, the
four comedians in the 11th
annual Kung Pao Kosher Comedy
"Funny Girlz" lineup will inspire
conversion Friday night whether
by laughter or obscenity. Shazia
Mirza, Dhaya Lakshminarayanan,
Carla Clayy and Lisa Geduldig take
the Palo Alto stage on the evening of
Oct. 1 as the last stop in the annual
three-night "Funny Girlz: A
Smorgasbord of Women
Comedians."
"It's just going to be a powerful
lineup of funny, intelligent comedy
that is going to really resonate," said
Lakshminarayanan, participating
comedian and host of WGBFI's
"High School Quiz Show." "There's
no, 'being a woman is so hard,
whine whine.' It's going to be pretty
inspired."
While "Funny Girlz" kicked off
in 1999 as a showcase for female
standup comics, this year's quartet is
objectively hilarious, chromosomes
notwithstanding. With a British-
Pakistani Muslim, an Indian
American, a black Bay Area native
and a fewish lesbian, the diverse line
up runs the gamut of experiences.
Stanford students may most
identify with Indian-American
Lakshminarayanan, who graduated
with two degrees from MIT,

researched in Cuba, blogged at the
Democratic National Convention
and then joined a Silicon Valley ven
ture capital firm. And now she jokes
about it. She maintains that comedy
clubs and the "traditional good
Indian girl route" of management
consulting aren't as far removed as
they would appear. For one, the
business negotiations come in
handy.
"I decided to go into comedy
because I had always been funny,
always the nerdy class clown, always
getting into trouble but still getting
As," she said. "When I was in ven
ture capitalism, I couldn't smoke
cigars and couldn't go out for drinks
I'm vegetarian and 98 pounds
so comedy was how I could com
pete." Lakshminarayanan's clean
comedy is as cerebral and socio
political as her pedigree would sug
gest (think "The Big Bang Theory"-
style humor).
Fellow sometimes-academic
Mirza, a veteran of both Comedy
Central and "60 Minutes," studied
biochemistry at Britain's Manchester
University and taught science before
taking to the standup circuit.
"When I was teaching, the kids
were so bad, they were so rough,
and that's actually where I learned
my standup comedy," the third-time
"Funny Girl" said. " [The students]
were so bad I would have to tell
jokes to keep them interested to
survive."
Mirza, also a columnist for The

Guardian, now performs across the
globe, bringing her trademark auto
biographical humor that draws
upon her upbringing as a Pakistani
Muslim in Birmingham, U.K. For
this stop in the Bay Area, Mirza will
speak about what Americans love
most: themselves.
"America is such a big and
powerful country that it likes to
hear about itself," she said. "So when
I come to America, they don't know
about where else I've been or what
I've been doing, they want to know
about what I think about what is
happening in America."
In turn, comedians Clayy and
Geduldig represent the local Bay
Area. Hostess Geduldig created
Kung Pao Kosher Comedy in 1993
and has been a fixture in the San
Francisco standup scene ever since.
Catch "Funny Girlz" at
Berkeley's Julia Morgan Center for
the Arts Thursday night, then Palo
Alto's Lucie Stern Community
Theatre (1305 Middlefield Rd.)
Friday at 8:00 p.m. Tickets are $25.

From top to bottom: "Funny
Girlz" Dhaya Lakshminarayanan,
Shazia Mirza, Carla Clayy and
Lisa Geduldig.


Victor "Kool A.D." Vazquez formed the hairy third of indie rap group Das Racist, who took over
Enchanted Broccoli Forrest's (EBF) second floor at Wednesday's Happy Hour. A San Francisco native,
Vazquez and his group played favorites like "Who's That Brown" and "Combination Pizza Hut and Taco
Bell," while weathering technical difficulties throughout the set.

A significant portion of the crowd left before the end of the 30-minute
set, as stereo problems and microphone issues led to major
feedback and indiscernible noise. However, those who stayed got
up close and personal with the Brooklyn trio.
