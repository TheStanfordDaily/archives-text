# Cross-town rivals
## Top-ranked Card prep to take on Santa Clara at home 
### NATE ADAMS DESK EDITOR 
Earlier this week, Stanford was singled
out in the NSCAA poll as the nation's No. 1
team. Now it's up to the Cardinal (8-0-2) to
defend that position and show why it has
earned it.
The next test for the country's top squad
will come this Sunday as the Cardinal re
sumes one of its more competitive rivalries,
hosting Bay Area foe Santa Clara. The
match, the only one of the weekend, marks
the final non-conference contest for the two
top-25 teams.
Both squads have had successful seasons
thus far, with No. 13 Santa Clara (7-2-2) suf
fering just a pair of losses and the Cardinal
standing just one win away from a perfect
non-conference season. But as talented as
the two rivals are, Sunday's game arrives
during a relative high for the Cardinal and a
low for the Broncos.
Stanford, which had a perfect season in
2009 before losing to North Carolina in the
national final, had been relegated to the na
tion's No. 2 team in 2010. The Cardinal
earned draws against then-N0.7 Boston Col
lege and No. 1 North Carolina early in the
season, and with last weekend's combina
tion of a 2-1 win over No. 3 Portland and
North Carolina losing to a fourth-ranked

Boston College squad, the Cardinal moved
into the No. 1 spot for the first time this sea
son.
"The team's playing really well right now
and we're firing on all cylinders, so we're ex
cited to play [Santa Clara]," said Stanford
head coach Paul Ratcliffe.
The Broncos, meanwhile, are coming off
just their second defeat of 2010. After defeat
ing Oregon 2-0 last Friday, the team flew to
Los Angeles to take on another Pac-10 op
ponent, UCLA. Santa Clara ultimately lost
to the Bruins 1-0, the same score that came in
its only other defeat this season, which came
early in September against Notre Dame.
However, the losses are certainly no rea
son to take Santa Clara lightly. When they
played the Broncos, Notre Dame was
ranked at No. 3 and UCLA at No. 15.
"It'll be an interesting game," Ratcliffe
said. "It's always a tough match because it's a
cross-town rivalry. It'll be a hard game, Santa
Clara's a good team and I expect them to put
up a tough fight for us."
Any team would look to bounce back
after a loss, but Santa Clara will have an extra
chip on its shoulder against Stanford this
weekend. The Broncos played the Cardinal
twice last year, losing 6-2 early in the season
before being eliminated from playoff con
tention in a heartbreaking 1-0 loss in the
Sweet 16.
The goal that knocked Santa Clara out of
the tournament came on a 25-yard free kick
from Teresa Noyola. The junior midfielder
has a good chance of contributing to anoth

With five goals in 10 games and solid defensive play, junior
midfielder Teresa Noyola, above, has been an instrumental
part of the No. 1 Cardinal's successful season thus far.
