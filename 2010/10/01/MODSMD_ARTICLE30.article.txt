For the past month, soprano Lydia
Zodda' 11 and alto Deborah McDevitt,
a member of the Stanford Chamber
Chorale, have been rehearsing the vocals and
choreography for their performance in next
week's Daniel Pearl World Music Days
Concert. Zodda and McDevitt aren't learning
dance moves, though. They've been learning
the gestures to play iPhones.
The singers will perform a hybrid elec
tro-choral piece in Thursday's concert at
Memorial Church, singing a collaborative
work composed by graduate students Spencer
Salazar and Jeffrey Smith. The original work
is just one act in the Oct. 7 Lively Arts- and
Music at Stanford-sponsored "Harmony for
Humanity," a free concert honoring the late
journalist, musician and alumnus Daniel
Pearl. Pearl, who graduated from Stanford in
1985, was kidnapped and murdered in

Pakistan in 2002 while on assignment for the
Wall Street Journal.
On Thursday, Zodda and McDevitt will
have the complicated task of singing the
soprano and alto parts while simultaneously
"playing" the iPhones that take up the cus
tomary organ and bass parts. Each of the
singers' movements and rotations will be
tracked by the iPhone's gyroscope, which will
then send signals to the computer powering
the speakers in the church.
"There are thousands of ways one could
conceivably play an iPhone," Salazar said.
"You could tap the screen. You could shake it.
You could blow into it. As a composer and
instrument builder you have to figure out
how one might use it with knowledge of what
things look good, what things are easy or
hard to do for a performer."
The iPhone piece was composed specifi

cally for the Daniel Pearl memorial, with
Smith writing most of the traditional score
and Salazar designing the iPhone movements
to be both expressive and executable for the
novice iPhone user.
"The text is taken specifically from Psalm
123," Smith said. "It's reflective of some of the
experiences we all went through after 9/11
and when Daniel was murdered." Smith
noted that while the performers will be work
ing iPhones, it is very much a vocal piece.
Smith hopes that the modern and exper
imental composition may open the way for
more collaboration between computer music
considered the domain of the Center for
Computer Research in Music and Acoustics
and more conventional art forms.
"I hope that this is a general technique
that any composer could then use and begin
to think about more opportunities to cooper

ate with the school of dance where you have
music that's more integrated with choreogra
phy," he said. Smith will play an original work
for piano.
Other participants include the Stanford
Chamber Chorale, performing a composition
by Stanford music Prof. Jonathan Berger, the
St. Lawrence String Quartet, playing Marcus
Goddard's "Allaqi," and cellist Christopher
Constanza, performing J.S. Bach's
"Allemande."
"Harmony for Humanity" begins at 8:00
p.m. on Thursday, Oct. 7 at Memorial
Church. Admission to the event is free.
