I'm wearing:
Vintage Dior sequin top from a vin
tage store in Williamsburg, Levi cutoffs
from a flea market in Iceland, shoes
from Opening Ceremony and sun
glasses from the vintage store that I
work at called Amarcord in downtown
Manhattan. The bracelets are my
grandmother's from Bombay, the lip
stick is my one and only Nars Schiap
and the backpack is a Salvation Army
find.
My style:
I tend to be capricious and a bit schiz
ophrenic when it comes to getting
dressed. For the most part, I'd say my
style is leather and lace.
