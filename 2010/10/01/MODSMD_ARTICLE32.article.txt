## FALL FASHION TRENDS 
### â€” merissa REN contact merissa: merissar@stanford. edu 
The trend: Ladylike
Designers: Prada, Louis Vuitton
Two of the cornerstones of mainstream
luxury dressing sent a decidedly 50s
aesthetic down their fall runways. The
"Mad Men"-esque silhouettes and styling
marked a return to luxury dressing that
embraces the female form. Although the look
was reminiscent of housewives from an ideal
ized American past, both collections were
imbued with a subversive underlying power
contained in the prepackaged symbol of wom
anly form. Miuccia Prada sent buxom, bee
hived women down her maze-like Milan run
way to the sounds of free jazz. She took the
cookie cutter housewife image and turned it
darker and more sarcastic. In a world of face
less 13-year-old Eastern European toothpicks,
Miuccia overtly drew attention to the chest
with tiers of ruffles and under-the-bust
cutouts, celebrating and embracing the
woman instead of boxing her into an ideal.
Marc Jacobs continued this ode to women,
closing Paris fashion week with a Louis
Vuitton line full of elbow-length gloves and
buttery leather A-line skirts. The decolletage
was paid equal homage with form-fitting
bustiers and cinched-in waists. This time lady
like was not about confining women to a cer
tain ideal, but rather embracing the female
body as muse.
How to wear it:
Although I'm all in favor of a campus-wide
motion to wear full-length gloves, if that
seems a little problematic for eating and such,
try this trend from the inside out. Before you
throw on the sweatshirt and Rainbows, chan
nel your inner Christina Hendricks and dress

like a woman. Try an A
line silhouette with a well
placed cutout or a struc
tured bustier top, with a
little volume in your pony
and a stacked pump. Don't

be afraid of length and volume

when it comes to skirt choice. Instead of flashy
and skin tight, showcase your curves by wear
ing something that is flattering to the bust,
directs attention to your waist and floats away
from the hips. Take the time and invest in lux
ury pieces that fit your body perfectly. In
short, treat yourself like a lady.

The trend: Floor-Length for Day
Designers: Marc Jacobs, The Row,
Dries Van Noten

This fall, expect a major drop in hem
lines, from micro minis to fabric softly
sweeping the ground. Great lengths
were making appearances throughout all four
major fashion weeks in various different
incarnations. Marc Jacobs' eponymous line
featured gently voluminous ankle-grazing
skirts with sheer panels. Mary-Kate and
Ashley Olsen's signature It-girl, effortlessly
cool aesthetic was flawlessly recreated in the
all-black floor-length minimalist ensembles
featuring simple and elegant silhouettes. The
floor-length skirt reappeared as a boldly
printed sheath at Dries van Noten, a grey knit
oozing classic American at Michael Kors and
a whimsical forest-green chiffon at Peter Som.
Although more modest than the statement
making mini dresses at Balmain, the floor
length skirt creates just as much, if not more,
drama. The visual strength of the long unbro
ken line demands respect and creates elegance.

How to wear it:
This trend is totally
doable, do not be afraid.
Avoid dowdy grandma
fabrics, large flowers, fat

pleats, heavy or too much vol-

ume; instead opt for lightweight

fabrics and body-skimming cuts. As one of the
very vertically challenged, I was always terrified
of looking swallowed up in fabric. For us short
folk, think less volume, more column. Also, I
always sneak some huge heels under there,
then wow, my legs are magically five inches

longer! How did that happen? With this look,
you statuesque beauties, even with flats, still
create a line that shows off your legs for miles
and miles. Not only does it lend instant ele
gance, but it's also incredibly versatile. You can
wear it with a dramatic slit, as a flattering
blank backdrop to the outfit or as a printed
main attraction. Floor-length lightweight chif
fon adds so much romance to an outfit, but

doesn't have to be fairy princess-y. Paired with
a basic top and blazer it becomes clean with a
touch of whimsy. Plus, wearing a long skirt
feels like sweeping around in a ball gown. You
feel like you own every movement you make
and the space you take up. It also is so easy to
throw on, and bam, automatic relaxed cool a la
Mary-Kate. There is something extremely sexy
about just hinting at the shape of your legs.
Bonus, you won't flash anyone whilst bicycling!
