Tucked away just off California Avenue
is a hidden gem called Homma's
Brown Rice Sushi. You're not likely to
find this place unless you're looking for it, but
for those on a mission to try something differ
ent, Homma's is worth the detour.
The name of the restaurant tells you

exactly what to expect, but as some 7(
percent of rice eaten in America is
white rice, a quick introduction to
the main difference between white
and brown rice may be warranted
for those less familiar with the
grain. White rice actually grows as

brown rice, a whole grain that include;

the bran, germ and endosperm. The rice is
then processed to remove the bran and germ,
leaving mainly the starchy endosperm; unfor
tunately, the extracted portions are also what

carry most of
the grain's vita
mins and fiber.
The starchy
white rice, then,
is more similar
to white bread
with its mellow
taste and fluffi
ness (and nutri
tional value),
while brown rice

is more similar to whole grain bread, having a
mild earthy flavor accompanied by a slightly
grainy texture.
At Homma's, Homma himself handles
the sushi preparation, while his extremely
friendly son handles the ordering. The down
side of one mastermind chef is that the queue
for food can get quite lengthy, as one man
simultaneously juggles eat-in and takeout
orders. The restaurant also only seats about a
dozen people in plastic chairs with fairly asce
tic decor. The potential wait and the atmos-

phere make me strongly sug
gest following the lead of those
smart enough to call in

advance.

What Homma's lacks in
ambiance and efficiency,

though, it makes up

for with its food.

The brown rice
aspect of the
sushi is exe
cuted flawless
ly. The flavor is
subtle enough

not to overwhelm

the fish or vegetables,
and the texture is just right.
Another refreshing aspect of
Homma's is that you will not
find rolls drenched

in spicy mayonnaise
or too tempura-

heavy, allowing you
to embrace flavor

without sacrificing
the relatively healthy
dimension of their
sushi.

The hama
avo (yellowtail, green
onion, avocado) and

una-avo (BBQ eel and avocado) are highlights
of the maki menu. Homma is a perfectionist
when it comes to the freshness of his ingredi
ents, helping ensure that one cannot go wrong
with some simple tekka maki (tuna) or uni
nigiri (sea urchin) for the more adventurous.
The vegetable maki, however, is liable to lose
something to the brown rice, so I would rec
ommend going with some of the stronger fla
vors available, such as the gobou (pickled bur
dock root), shinko (pickled radish) or umekyu
(plum and cucumber). The futomaki roll was

a bit too ambitious with its size and tried to
combine too many subtle ingredients, but
overall, the menu is filled with excellent choic
es.
Off the sushi menu, there was some dis
appointment in my experience with the inari.
Homma's wraps some of its rice into three
envelopes of fried, sweet bean curd. The result
is certainly a bit confusing for those used to
traditional inari, which is more often wrapped
in fried or deep-fried tofu rather than bean
curd. The resulting texture of Homma's wrap

is soggy, and the dish is not quite savory
enough to be eaten comfortably with the meal
nor sweet enough to end it like dessert. Skip
this part of the menu.
Despite the occasional slight misfire, I left
Homma's very happy. It's a great spot with a
ton of potential as a take-out staple; avoid the
wait and enjoy.
