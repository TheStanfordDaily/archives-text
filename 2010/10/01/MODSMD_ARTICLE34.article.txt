It's a typical Axe and Palm situation:
another Tuesday afternoon and an
empty stomach still on East Coast time.
Naturally it's 3 p.m. and no other dining
hall is open for another two hours.
Thankfully, the 3 p.m. stomach is one
of The Axe and Palm's greatest demograph
ics that and the 1 a.m. liver on a Friday
night.
Remember last year when they remade
the menu and had very healthy items? This
year, TAP realized that didn't work. Burgers
and milkshakes abound.
The Axe and Palm has

gotten a little
fancier, too.
Diners can
now find
bison and
lamb burgers
on the menu.
The menu also
now resembles
that of a fast
food restau-

rant where you can buy either the sandwich
or the combo. Only two minutes after ring
ing up an order for the bison burger with a
side of waffle fries, the order was ready.
With regular fries(... obviously not every
thing has changed). Luckily this situation
was quickly rectified.

Looking for a table, space is much
more open than it was last year,
but also very much football-ori
ented, living up to "The Axe"
nomenclature. In the main seating
area they've added a very notice
able addition to the decor, a full
wall picture of the Red Zone at a
football game. It's a little intense
the first time you look at it, but it
looks a little like the crowd is

cheering for the patrons.
The burger was fantastic! When it
comes to the Axe and Palm, the food is the
most important thing, and they got this
spot on.
What is on the menu is about half of
what the Axe and Palm has to offer. They

have a
wide
variety
of
drinks

and pre-made
sandwiches if

you're on the go. The best and most impor
tant thing is that they take meal plan dol
lars! When you find yourself with a 3 p.m.
stomach and you need something quick, go
to the Axe and Palm and get cheered on for
eating.
