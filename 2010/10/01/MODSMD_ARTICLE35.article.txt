Palo Alto Sol provides some of the best Mexican
food in Palo Alto, served in the "Comida Poblana"
style. A family restaurant, the proprietors Hector
and Helena attempt to recreate the foods of their Puebla
heritage. If you're tired of the Treehouse or looking for a
date spot, Palo Alto Sol, situated in the heart of California
Avenue, is definitely worth a try.

The eatery can get packed at dinnertime, so try mak
ing a reservation during weekdays or you may end up like
my party waiting approximately 20 minutes for a table.

The restau
rant is dark
but comfort
able, with a
large bar and
great drink
variety. While
the drinks
make for a
great show,
especially

margaritas served in a goblet, diners on Yelp repeatedly
lament weak- to average-strength drinks.
I enjoyed snacking on the chips while waiting to
order with three types of salsas and an involved menu
chock-a-block full of text. With the hopping nature of

the restaurant at dinnertime and the large menu,

you may have some time to chow on the chips.
My party had a range of dishes. I really
enjoyed the burrito mole, with its rich choco
late-flavored sauce. The Camarones Diabla
(spicy shrimp) suited my friend, especially as
she could set her degree of spice. The Burrito

Campeano was a bit of a let down; the green sauce

was watery, but it did strike a good balance between the
component parts of the burrito: rice, beans, lettuce, toma
to and mushroom. Portions were filling, but prices were
high.

If you're looking for a night out or some nice
Mexican food for your next date, keep Palo Alto Sol in
mind.
