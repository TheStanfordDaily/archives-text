Following my review of the BBQ scene in
San Jose, reader R. H. wrote in to ask about
my view of the San Carlos-based Mack's
Smoked BBQ. I was intrigued, especially as his
letter proudly announced that he was flinging
clean ribs out of his window as he typed a mes
sage to me. I admired not only his abilities at
one-handed typing, but also the opportunity to
explore a culinary adventure.
Put simply, Mack's BBQ is delicious. Thank
you, R. H.! Mack's is a neighborhood barbeque
joint that fights off the strip mall feeling with
attempts at homey decoration, sports on the tube
and local newspapers throughout the eatery. The
compact space is packed at lunch, so much so

that the end of the day can see
shortages of Mack's staples of
pork, ribs, tri-tip or brisket.
When I went, the lunch rush
claimed all the brisket as its
victim.
The full-rack of ribs, run-

nmg $2O, is enough to share, meaty

and served wet. The succulent pulled pork is best
described as divine. I got it by the pound, and the
server prepared my styrofoam container with
care, providing alternating layers of sauce and
pork.
As for the sides, I was very pleased with the
baked beans but confused by the cornbread.

While tasty, the cornbread is too small for its

$0.99 price tag. According to its menu, the
I L cornbread does not come with the pulled
pork sandwich combo. Mack's also offers a
variety of unique brews: beer, root beer and
' cream soda. My root beer was the best I've
:ver had. It went down smooth and served as

a great supporting actor to my meal.
All in all, Mack's is a great place for BBQ,
especially for lunch. Just remember Mack's
hours: Monday to Saturday, 11 a.m. to 8 p.m.
