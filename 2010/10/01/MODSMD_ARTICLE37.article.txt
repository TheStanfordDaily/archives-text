Full disclosure: I am a metalhead. My
favorite bands are Metallica, Guns N'
Roses and Megadeth. Why, then, am I
writing about, or even listening to, Zac
Brown Band? The answer is twofold: first, I
have a girlfriend. Second, this album is actu
ally really good.
"You Get What You Give," the latest
endeavor from Zac Brown Band, is its most
ambitious album yet. Only months after the
band's 2010 Grammy Award for Best New
Artist, this album's release marks a satisfying
and well-deserved foray into the realm of
popular music, though the band has certainly
not left behind the spirit of the country
music that made it famous. Nothing demon
strates this duality better than a simple glance
at the names of the album's two guest vocal
ists; one is Jimmy Buffet and the other is Alan
Jackson.
"Let It Go" kicks the album off with a
drum beat, a guitar riff and a question: is
every song on this album written by Jimmy
Buffett? The simple answer is no, actually,
none of them are, but the carefree lyrics, slow
trot of a drum beat and island-sounding
organ certainly seem to suggest that this one
was taken right out of the Buffett songbook.
The interjection of a fiddle solo all but ruins
this sentiment, but even then, the very worst
that can be said is that this is a very pleasant
and relaxing country song.
In a rather ironic twist, the song in
which Jimmy Buffett himself is featured,
"Knee Deep," sounds less Buffett than even
the preceding track, and more country than
other songs on the album. Again continuing

the theme of living without cares (either a
motivating relief from the recent financial
downturn or the cause of it, I can't tell), this
is actually one of the weaker selections from
the record.
Following hot on the heels of "Cold
Weather," a song with a pleasant, galloping
drum beat and a plethora of tasty vocal har
monies, "Whiskey's Gone" is a rowdy barn
yard romp that is capable of entertaining any
one, if only allowed the chance. With a
stomp-clap friendly drum beat and a bass line
that has trouble standing still, the addition of
a talkative organ and a pluckin' good guitar
part adds tremendously to the excitement of
this fun-filled jam.
Other standouts include "Who Knows," a
partially-syncopated 10-minute jam with an
intro and conclusion that are very rock, and
"Martin," a beautiful ballad that is very coun
try and very beautiful.
Finally, my favorite two songs from this
album are the final track, "Make This Day,"
and the album's first single, "As She's Walking
Away," which features guest vocals by Alan
Jackson. "Make This Day" is another extreme
ly fun song, a fusion of blues and big band
elements that tickles the ear and arouses the
sudden urge to break into dance. "As She's
Walking Away" is a song that, not surprising
ly, screams country, from the reverberated
twang of the electric guitar to the hackneyed
but well-constructed lyrics about love and
loss. Country fans will immediately under
stand why this song gets radio play.

Overall, this is an extremely well-written and well-balanced album, and,
despite my heavy rock and roll background, I must say I really enjoyed listen
ing to almost every song (the reggae feel of "Settle Me Down" just didn't float
my boat, and "Keep Me In Mind" starts off with a warning: "It's gonna get
funky"). I won't be surprised if this album does very well on the pop as well
as the country charts some tracks have the potential to be crossover hits.
My recommendation: Go buy it. If you're a country fan, you will not be
sorry, and if you aren't, you may just surprise yourself with this one.
