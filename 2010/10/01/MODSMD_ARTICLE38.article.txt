I've got to hand it to Maroon 5 eight
years and three studio albums on, they
are still the kings of mainstream pop.
With hits as big as "This Love," "Sunday
Morning" and "She Will Be Loved,"
Maroon 5 set a very high bar for them
selves with their multi-platinum debut
album, "Songs About Jane" (2002). While
chock-full of big beats and groovy guitar
riffs, their second studio album, "It Won't
Be Soon Before Long" (2007), did not
quite have the impact of their first release,
leaving some fans worried about the future
of the band. With their latest album,
"Hands All Over," Maroon 5 has made a
comeback from their three-year hiatus to
prove that they are still alive and kicking.
Front man Adam Levine has always
had a knack for writing hypnotic hooks
and relentlessly catchy choruses. He does
not fail to deliver on "Misery," the opening
track of "Hands All Over" and the most
stereotypically Maroon 5-sounding song
on the album. There is no accusing the
band of producing more of the same this
time, however, as the rest of the tracks on
"Hands All Over" showcase a variety of
different sounds and influences, and see
the band delving into genres they had pre
viously left untouched. The addictive gui
tar riffs skillfully spun by guitarist James
Valentine are still present in force, as is the
sultry verve of Levine's falsetto, but the
band now sports a more polished sound.
This glossy finish is largely thanks to pro
ducer Robert "Mutt" Lange, who is best
known for his work with rock legends

AC/DC and Def Leppard and country
crooner Shania Twain.
The true novelty of this album lies not
in its production, but in the radical depar
ture from Maroon s's former "funk rock"
sound. Following "Misery's" bridging of
the stylistic gap between "It Won't Be Soon
Before Long" and "Hands All Over," the
band uses the rest of the tracks to assert
their musical versatility.
To start, the second track on the
album, "Give A Little More," has a sunny
soulfulness to it reminiscent of the early
days of Motown. The subsequent song,
"Stutter," boasts a grandiose pop sound
that channels the melodic flair of former
"American Idol" contestant Adam Lambert
and marks an audible shift in sound.
"Don't Know Nothing" is a beautifully-lay
ered track backed by a recurring piano
motif and upbeat harmonies. Rumored to
be the next single off this album, "Never
Gonna Leave This Bed" is a moving song
with nostalgic melodies suggestive of The
Fray, and it definitely deserves more than
one listen. "Hands All Over," the title track,
is a suitably rocky anthem with a driving
drum beat that begs to be blasted and is
sure to get your head bobbing.
Appearing later in the album, "How"
and "Last Chance" serve as reminders of
Levine's great ability to write love songs
that are anything but cringe-worthy. One
of the closing tracks, "Out of Goodbyes,"
merits a mention as well. A duet with Lady

Antebellum's Hillary Scott, this song
marks Maroon s's foray into country
music. Although one would never
associate Levine's jaunty tenor with
the country genre, his voice comple
ments Scott's nicely, and the crossover
tune could very well be the next hit on
both the country and pop charts.
The deluxe version of "Hands All
Over" features a few acoustic versions
of album songs, as well as a live cover
of Alicia Keys' "If I Ain't Got You," all
of which further reinforce Maroon s's
raw musical talent.
From start to finish, "Hands All
Over" is a wonderfully surprising com

pilation of musical genres, likeable lyrics
and memorable melodies. Maroon 5
has more than proved that they deserve
their place at the top of the world of
mainstream music, without selling out
to the gimmicks that propel many of
today's artists to the top of the charts.
So grab your copy of "Hands All Over,"
crank up your stereo and get used to the
new sound of success: "This Love" is
one that's here to stay.
