In a world managed by computer interac
tions, it can be difficult to come across
something that feels human and genuine.
Mostly what one encounters reads as mecha
nized or worse, sterile. "Halcyon Digest,"
Deerhunter's latest effort, is anything but. A
fine example of quality mixing, the album is
thick with emotional content and awe of life.
Forget polished vocals and monotonous
looped drum beats: With "Halcyon Digest,"
you're in for a shot of reality.
The album takes off with "Earthquake," a
psychedelic track that swells with keyboard
instrumentation and an incessant guitar
tremolo. What sounds like a halting metallic
drum beat during the
first few seconds fuses

into the body of the song,

which has so man
layers of record
ed music, it's
hard to make
out the heavily
distorted
vocals. That
isn't a problem
though, it's inten
tional. The only

discernible human
sounds are the heavy breathing and parting of
lips before singing. The feeling of intimacy is
palpable, like having someone singing into
your ear; you can't really hear everything, but
the experience is intoxicating.
True to its title is "Revival."
An upbeat, quick-lived song, it

injects life

into the album through a soaring chorus line
and acoustic guitar strumming. The energy
mounts as the vocals turn into a wail and an
acoustic guitar riff bursts above the vocal har
monies it acquires a feeling of sentimentali
ty and hope that otherwise is hard to catch in
the steady beat of the rest of the song. Another

sunshine-y track, "Memory Boy," incorporates
bells into the background. The chiming recalls
The Beach Boys in all their positive affection
and helps subdue the darker tracks on the
album, like "Sailing," a heartbreakingly bare
track. Based on guitar and vocals alone, the
loneliness is echoed in lines such as "You learn
to accept/Whatever you can get." The human
condition never felt so poignant.
"Desire Lines" is one of the many high
lights of the album. A nod to garage rock, the
track resounds with feeling the moment its
low-fi, simple guitar riffs and bass drum line
take off with harmonized vocals. Although the
tone of voice doesn't swell with sentimentality,
its flatness, paired with the guitar riff during
the chorus, is completely unforgettable.
"Walking free, ooh-whoa/Come with me, ooh-
