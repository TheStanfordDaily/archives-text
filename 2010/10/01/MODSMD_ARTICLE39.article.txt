In a world managed by computer interac
tions, it can be difficult to come across
something that feels human and genuine.
Mostly what one encounters reads as mecha
nized or worse, sterile. "Halcyon Digest,"
Deerhunter's latest effort, is anything but. A
fine example of quality mixing, the album is
thick with emotional content and awe of life.
Forget polished vocals and monotonous
looped drum beats: With "Halcyon Digest,"
you're in for a shot of reality.
The album takes off with "Earthquake," a
psychedelic track that swells with keyboard
instrumentation and an incessant guitar
tremolo. What sounds like a halting metallic
drum beat during the
first few seconds fuses

into the body of the song,

which has so man
layers of record
ed music, it's
hard to make
out the heavily
distorted
vocals. That
isn't a problem
though, it's inten
tional. The only

discernible human
sounds are the heavy breathing and parting of
lips before singing. The feeling of intimacy is
palpable, like having someone singing into
your ear; you can't really hear everything, but
the experience is intoxicating.
True to its title is "Revival."
An upbeat, quick-lived song, it

injects life

into the album through a soaring chorus line
and acoustic guitar strumming. The energy
mounts as the vocals turn into a wail and an
acoustic guitar riff bursts above the vocal har
monies it acquires a feeling of sentimentali
ty and hope that otherwise is hard to catch in
the steady beat of the rest of the song. Another

sunshine-y track, "Memory Boy," incorporates
bells into the background. The chiming recalls
The Beach Boys in all their positive affection
and helps subdue the darker tracks on the
album, like "Sailing," a heartbreakingly bare
track. Based on guitar and vocals alone, the
loneliness is echoed in lines such as "You learn
to accept/Whatever you can get." The human
condition never felt so poignant.
"Desire Lines" is one of the many high
lights of the album. A nod to garage rock, the
track resounds with feeling the moment its
low-fi, simple guitar riffs and bass drum line
take off with harmonized vocals. Although the
tone of voice doesn't swell with sentimentality,
its flatness, paired with the guitar riff during
the chorus, is completely unforgettable.
"Walking free, ooh-whoa/Come with me, ooh-


COURTESY DEERHUNTER
whoa/Far away, ooh-whoa/Everyday, ooh-whoa,"
sings Lockett Pundt to his overachieving subject. The
oscillating and incessant guitar licks that close up the
song encompass a feeling of exhilaration before the
amazing thing that is life.
The beat kicks back in with the track
"Coronado." A wonderfully warm recording, the
song is injected with vitality from bubbly saxophone
lines throughout the three minutes of the song. Brass
has a certain joyful quality to it, and in this record
ing, it makes the song, adding to the steady beat and

heavily distorted vocals a
feeling of genuineness. This

feeling is heightened when, at the end of the track, a
few cables can be heard falling on the floor in the
background, an invitation to believe that we are there
in the studio with the band, listening in.
The album closes mid-note during the final
track, "He Could have Laughed" dedicated to the late
Jay Reatard. Having the music cut off abruptly is
completely unexpected was this copy of the
album faulty? In fact, it wasn't. In an album dedicat
ed to celebrating the wonders and pitfalls of life, it
makes sense that the final track paid homage to its
most distinctive characteristic: the unpredictability of
it.
