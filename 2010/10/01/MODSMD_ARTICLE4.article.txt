# Three of The Daily's football gurus give their takes on Saturday's game
## 
### 
NO. 9 STANFORD (4-0,1 -0] AT NO. 4 OREGON (4-0,1 -0)
KABIR SAWHNEY
OREGON 45, STANFORD 42: Both offenses have the ability to match
each other point for point; that much is fairly clear. This game will go down to the
final drive, but Stanford will simply have one fewer clutch play in it than the Ducks.
The Cardinal?s defense will not be able to replicate its performances against
Notre Dame and UCLA, and that will end up being the decisive factor in an ex
tremely close finish.
ZACH ZIMMERMAN
STANFORD 34, OREGON 30: I have complete faith in a Stanford offense
that has, even when struggling for quarters at a time, made other teams look silly.
However, what concerns me, along with the rest of America, is Stanford's lack of
athleticism defensively. Oregon's James and Barner are absurdly fast, and have
the potential to go off on any given night. My pick comes down to whether or not
the Cardinal linebackers are up for the challenge. I think they are.
JACOB JAFFE
STANFORD 46, OREGON 45: Oregon is as talented as any team in the
country, the game is in Autzen Stadium, Stanford is battling injuries and the time
for a Cardinal letdown has never been higher. The signs seem to point to an Ore
gon victory. But this isn't your dad's (or sister's) Stanford Cardinal. Stanford's phys
ical running game (yes, even without Toby Gerhart) steamrolls a small, quick Ore
gon defense, and the new-look Cardinal 3-4 comes up with a couple big stops. A
gutsy two-point conversion call by Harbaugh proves to be the difference.
