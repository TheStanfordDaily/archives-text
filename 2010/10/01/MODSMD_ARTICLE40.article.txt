Facebook is a cultural addiction, a tech
nological phenomenon, a global cross
roads. Its reach is indisputable.
Available in 76 languages, including Upside
Down English and Leet Speak (133t sp34k),
Facebook has more users than the United
States has people. According to Facebook,
these users spend 700 billion minutes on the
social networking site each month and boast
an average of 130 friends. Facebook has over
come time zones and tight schedules, will
power and work ethic. It has infiltrated our
consciousness as a society. It has, in short,
defined us.
It began, however, by defining its creator,
Mark Zuckerberg. David Fincher's "The
Social Network" begins the same way.
Embittered by the rude awakening of a
sudden breakup, Zuckerberg (Jesse
Eisenberg) sulks, drinks and vents his anger
in the only way he knows how online. He
fashions a website that allows guys to com
pare Harvard girls based on looks, which
earns him academic probation as well as the
attention of three entrepreneurial undergrad
uates: the fabulously gorgeous twins Tyler
and Cameron Winklevoss (Armie Hammer
with body double Josh Pence) and their
friend Divya Narendra (Max Minghella). The
three successfully enlist Zuckerberg's help in
creating a Harvard-exclusive social network
ing website.
From this point on, the film follows two
carefully intertwined storylines one docu
menting the inception of Facebook, the other
the legal action surrounding Zuckerberg's

alleged theft of the website idea from the
Winklevosses (or "Winklevi").
"The Social Network" traces the disinte
gration of Zuckerberg's personal life and
simultaneous rise of Facebook. It is an
unabashed dramatization of real life, but
under Fincher's direction, it deftly avoids
mainstream melodrama in favor of artistry,
gravitas and honest, character-driven con
flict. Like "Fight Club" and "The Curious
Case of Benjamin Button," the movie is char
acterized by dark lighting and a complex but
cleanly edited narrative structure. And
although Fincher elicits striking moments of
truth throughout the film, he opts to show
case a rather romantically glamorous, alto
gether fictional image of prestigious universi
ties. Abrasive realism and attention to the grit
of college life, which would have augmented
the film's believability and boldness, are not
indulged.
Fincher's directing is buoyed by the
intelligence and class of screenwriter Aaron
Sorkin's adaptation of Ben Mezrich's "The
Accidental Billionaires." Sorkin drops witty
remarks like staccato notes. Yet at times, the
dialogue's razor sharpness makes "The Social

Network" feel more like a blockbuster heist
than an extraordinary coming-of-age story.
This imbalance of entertainment and sinceri
ty is softened, but not entirely erased, by the
cast's earnest delivery.
The characters themselves are simply
drawn but well-acted. Eisenberg as
Zuckerberg is an idealistic but arrogant ass
hole committed to "taking the entire social
experience of college and putting it online."
Fincher's storytelling complicates our under
standing of Zuckerberg by portraying him as
a liar, but as one who manages to avoid our
criticism thanks to his inherent aloofness and
close-mindedness. British actor Andrew

Garfield (lead of the new Spiderman reboot)
assumes a perfect American accent as
Facebook's Chief Financial Officer Eduardo
Saverin, balancing mature seriousness with
emotional naivete. While the Winklevoss
brothers are written as borderline caricatures
of real people, Armie FFammer commits with
gusto to their Ivy League righteousness and
privilege. Lastly, Justin Timberlake as
Napster's wild card creator effectively com
municates Sean Parker's delusional antics.
The film's only great flaw lies in the fact
that none of its characters is likable. While



COURTESY COLUMBIA PICTURES
likability seems superficial, as one character a legal
associate played by Rashida Jones points out to
Zuckerberg, mere likability can determine a jury's deci
sion. "Myths need a devil," she says, and Zuckerberg
fits the part. The overriding unpleasantness of the
characters in "The Social Network" prevents us from
deeply empathizing with them, caring about where
they end up and ultimately, enjoying the film to its
fullest. As the protagonist, Zuckerberg fails to warm
our hearts. He largely internalizes his conflicts, which
Eisenberg aptly portrays, but this absence of visible
emotional impact on his character makes his journey a
flat, predictable one. What little change he does go
through lacks weight due to the apathy with which the

audience regards him. Saverin comes the closest to
establishing empathy with us, but his coolness during
the legal talks makes that feeling difficult to hold on to.
While undoubtedly one of the year's more impres
sive films, "The Social Network" is not entirely perfect.
Its shortcomings, however, do not detract from the
potency of the actors' performances or from the high
drama of the story itself. Fincher's take on the intrigue
surrounding Mark Zuckerberg's rise to unfathomable
success will certainly captivate, if not thoroughly
impress, Facebook's 500 million users.
