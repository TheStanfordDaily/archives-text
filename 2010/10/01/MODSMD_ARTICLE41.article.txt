When the trailer for this action-heist
movie was first shown, people
came to two conclusions. The first
was that this movie had one of the lamest
titles for a movie since M. Night Shyamalan's
"The Happening." The other was that the
trailer gave too much away. It seemed to spoil
the twist and ruin another good movie for
the public.
In watching "The Town," however, the
drama and plot twists from the trailer are
revealed not to be twists at all, merely the
jump-off point at the 15-minute mark.
Ben Affleck plays Doug, the leader of a
small group of bank robbers that include his
off-the-handle brother Jem, played by Jeremy
Renner of "The Hurt Locker" fame. When a
bank robbery goes wrong, Jem makes a mis
take and takes a manager, Claire (Rebecca
Hall), as his hostage. Our heroes let her go
free, but Doug must make sure that Claire
doesn't remember her captors. She doesn't,
but Doug ends up falling in love with his for

mer hostage. Further complications come
when an aggressive FBI agent played by Jon
Hamm ("Mad Men") begins to track Doug
and his brother. Doug must also navigate
around his listless, casual relationship with
Jem's sister (Blake Lively from "Gossip Girl"),
his imprisoned father (Chris Cooper) and a
local crime magnet (Pete Postlethwaite).
Ben Affleck now finds himself both in
front of and behind the camera in "The
Town," his second directorial attempt after

the 2007 critically acclaimed "Gone Baby
Gone." Now he proves his critical success
wasn't just a fluke and that he actually has
talent as a filmmaker. He starred, directed
and even helped adapt this movie from
Chuck Hogan's novel "Prince of Thieves."
This is Affleck's first turn as a leading man
since his failures at the beginning of last
decade, and here, he asserts himself as an

actor against a phenomenal sup-

porting cast.

Perhaps one of the year's best movies,
"The Town" never fails to excite. The film
twists and turns its way through a few differ
ent bank heists and Doug's relationship with
Claire. Each of the robbery scenes is exciting
ly executed and shows Affleck's strength as a
director. "The Town" faithfully explores the
relationship between hostage and criminal,
while pushing the theme of change and
breaking free from a haunted past. Affleck
handles these themes with a surprising ease
and a subtle manner that ensures the audi
ence won't tire of them. The movie also fea
tures some of the best acting from Hamm,
Hall and Affleck, even though the hilarious
and brutal Renner upstages them all.
And now, since Ben Affleck is on the
rise, maybe soon we can return to the Ben
Affleck of "Good Will Hunting" and forget
the Affleck of "Gigli," "Daredevil" and most
of the 2000s.
