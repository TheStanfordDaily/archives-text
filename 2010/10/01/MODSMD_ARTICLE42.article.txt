In 1987, Oliver Stone's "Wall Street"
tapped into the 80s culture of excess more
effectively than any other film of its time.
Now, Stone is back with a star-studded cast to
cover the 2008 financial meltdown in the
glossy sequel "Wall Street: Money Never
Sleeps."
The movie, screened for Stanford stu
dents last Friday by the Stanford Film Society,
has all the makings of a great film strong
performances, Stone's directing and, above
all, timeliness. But while entertaining at some
parts, and despite the elements working for it,
"Money Never Sleeps" just never fully deliv

ered what it promised.
The sequel picks up 23 years after the
original movie. Gordon Gekko (Michael
Douglas) has been out of prison for seven
years and is back in the public consciousness
with his new book, "Is Greed Good?" Gekko's
resurgence catches the eye of Wall Street
upstart Jacob Moore (Shia Laßeouf), who
happens to be engaged to Gekko's estranged
daughter, Winnie (Carey Mulligan), an aspir
ing Internet journalist who, unsurprisingly,
despises Wall Street. Jacob is determined to
patch up the father-daughter relationship
mostly because of his love for Winnie not
to mention the convenient connections and
wealth that await him with reconciliation.
Matters are complicated when Jacob suspects
the suicide of his mentor and Wall Street leg
end Lewis Zabel (Frank Langella) may have
had something to do with his corrupt hedge
fund manager Bretton James, played by a
deliciously devious Josh Brolin.

Douglas reprises his Oscar-winning role
as Gekko, a man whose moral compass
remains determinedly obscured throughout
the film, even when he pulls out the poignant
stops to win back his daughter. Laßeouf has
come a long way from his Disney Channel
days on "Even Stevens." In "Money Never
Sleeps," the young actor turns in a believably
adult performance as the eager, ambitious
Jacob. The unexpected weak spot is Mulligan
despite critical raves for her part in "An
Education," here she spends the movie doing
little more than mope and make sad puppy
dog faces at Jacob. While Winnie isn't your
typical Hollywood arm candy, she becomes a
tormented drag.
Composition-wise, the hyper editing and
transitions should tap into this generation's
frenzied technologic addiction, but here it
does more harm than good. Stone takes it too
far superimposing Zabel's face over a bath
room stall while Jacob pensively washes his

hands was more laughable than thoughtful.
In the end, Stone may have tried too
hard to push his message. Instead of sharp,
the director comes off preachy. lacob and
Winnie are good people who want to save the
world with green energy, but are stifled by
evil Wall Street suits. Environment good.
Businessmen bad.
Clearly Brolin's James can't get away with
his wicked, greedy deeds. And then there's
Gekko and his classic conundrum power
and ambition or mushy gushy family? Stone
is so intent to drive home that greed is, in
fact, not good that he misses his chance to
make a smart, relevant film. In "Money Never
Sleeps," he treads too heavily, his intentions
blaringly obvious; what comes out instead is a
clunky, verbose snore.
