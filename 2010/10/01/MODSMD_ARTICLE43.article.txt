## The 						thing about using the word ordinary ...

The superhero genre is traditionally
best left for feature film, with a few
notable attempts to disprove that
maxim: "Heroes," "Smallville," "Power
Rangers," to name the exceptions. That list
doesn't inspire much confidence going into
ABC's new show, what appears to be an
unanimated version of "The Incredibles" (is
the similarity allowed because Disney owns
ABC and Pixar? If another network had
developed this show, would it have been shut
down for legal issues? Thoughts to chew on),
"No Ordinary Family."
"No Ordinary Family" tells the story of a
family weighed down by work, technology
and teenage 'tude. When the badass Michael

Chiklis, the no-longer-delicate Julie Benz, the
grown-up Kay Panabaker and the unknown
Jimmy Bennett are cast as your nuclear fami
ly, it's a wonder they have any problems, but
they're unhappy just like us! Chiklis, the clear
leader of both the series and the fictional
clan as Jim Powell, orchestrates a family
vacation to South America, where their plane
plunges into magical South American lake
water. Unbeknownst to the crew, they have
been imbued with superhuman abilities: Jim
has super strength, Stephanie (Benz) has
super speed, Daphne (Panabaker) can read
minds and JJ (Bennett) overcomes his learn
ing disability with super intelligence. They
spend the pilot realizing and experimenting

with these new abilities.
As such, the pilot feels more like a pro
logue than a first chapter of this new series
no villains emerge, other than the charac
ters' own human flaws and Stephanie's sexu
ally predatory boss (played, ironically, by the
dad from "7th Heaven"). That idea generates
the thematic core of the series: how do
superficial things, like jobs, technology and
even superpowers, affect our identities and
important relationships? The literal transla
tion of this issue comes with the reveal of the
therapist (played by the dad from "Billboard
Dad!") in the final moments of the pilot. The
Powells will work through their superpowers
and their family issues in tandem.

WHAT TO WATCH NEXT WEEK
Sunday at 9:30 p.m.: Fall premieres
conclude with "American Dad."
Monday at 9 p.m.: "Lone Star"... oh
wait. Season three premier of "Lie to
Me" instead.
Thursday at 9 p.m.: Watch the fallout
from this week's disqualification on
"Project Runway."

This is where the pandering to American
audiences muddles not only the superhero
genre but also the show's ability to identify
with a specific genre at all. Is it a comedy? Is
it a drama? Is it a superhero vehicle? Is it a
high school show? Family shows such as
"Parenthood" or "Brothers and Sisters"
define the hierarchy within their families
very quickly, in that "Parenthood" cares more
about the parents and "Brothers and Sisters"
cares more about the children than Sally
Field. The pilot of "No Ordinary Family" sets
the series up as a vehicle for Chiklis and
Benz, nearly forgetting the children, a choice
that would change the whole concept of the
series. The preferential treatment of the
parental figures suggests that the show's fam
ily aspect lies with the running of a family,
not merely living with one. Admittedly, there
are enough sitcoms about the former, but the
further "No Ordinary Family" drifts from
family interaction, the less coherent of a
series it becomes.
This is not to say the work lives of the
adult Powells are uninteresting. The "work"
Jim and Stephanie do in the pilot consists of
testing their strength and speed, respectively,
with their sidekicks in tow. Romany Malco
and Autumn Reeser, as the assistants-turned
sidekicks, encapsulate the genius casting of
the series and are the most likable roles in it,
perhaps because they are able to have per-


COURTESY ABC

sonalities where the Powells, with
the exception of Jim, are reduced to
stereotypes.
And how's the action itself?
Nothing to write a column about.

Growing up in the age of superhero
movies, I think it's difficult to
recreate it on a television budget
(or a non-HBO budget) without
appearing hokey. The actors, how
ever, are able to sell the sequences
on the merit of "what does it feel
like to have superpowers?"

The show, thanks to a great cast
with good chemistry, has potential
to be heart-warming and addictive if
the family dynamic is executed cor
rectly. I'll also be intrigued to see
how the first season will be struc
tured, in terms of conflict and
episodic developments. "No
Ordinary Family" is no ordinary

concept (and certainly no original
one), but it has to avoid being an
even worse adjective, "blah."
