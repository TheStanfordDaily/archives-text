## ROXY SASS Stanford dating: A field guide 
### â€” roxy SASS contact roxy: intermission@stanforddaily. com 
You might say Roxy knows
her way around, and she
has observed, through vast
personal experience, that there are
only two types of lovin' at
Stanford: the casual hookup and
the married couple. Roxy's seen
and done it all. Yes, from meet
and-"greet" encounters to hip
attached commitment, it's true:
there just aren't many other ways
to rough-and-tumble on the
Farm.
To each his or her own, but
before you accidentally find your
self tied down or cut loose, take a
gander at Roxy's take on the two
sides of the lovely coin that is sex
at Stanford.
Short and Sweet
The biggest upside to the
casual fling? Easy come, easy go.
The Roxy Cake's got enough for
everyone to have a slice. And let's
face it: who isn't hungry? As we
say around the office, if you're
interested in Roxy, she's interested
in you. Never one to surrender her
addiction to raspberry-flavored
vodka, Roxy knows that a little
social lubrication is often a friend
ly helper when getting to, ahem,
"know" people. Biblically.
Because really, Roxy would
like to get to the point here. The
problem with actually getting to
know someone is that you have to
deal with troublesome things like
conversations and feelings. Why all
the games, why all the fuss, why all
the Facebook poking when you
could be poking IRL?
So get over your prudish
high-school qualms and serve
yourself a little sampling from the
all-you-can-taste buffet. Never
before and never again will Roxy

be privy to such an array of
young, intelligent and athletic
specimens in her life. Roxy's been
around the block and she
knows the history corner is never
locked.
The Grateful Wed
Roxy, like many Stanford sassy
lasses, is a busy gal. And as such,
she knows the power of a little
horizontal workout as a study
break. But who has the time to
wine and dine someone for a little
fun? Though Roxy's more
"exploratory" phases may contrast
sharply with her times as half of a
perennial couple, she's got some
aspects of the persistent-pair setup
to defend.
For one, it's efficient. Once
you've gotten over the initial wor
ries of how much time to spend
together, there's no need for pleas
antries, only a quick text: "Meet
me in the stacks in five. Bring
rope." It's because Roxy knows the
best part of being tied down is
being tied up by someone who
knows how she likes her knots.
Roxy's wallet appreciates not
having to pay for housing, and her
schedule appreciates the speedi
ness of a mid-afternoon quickie
when two Google Calendars line
up. And as much as she enjoys the
thrill of a new conquest, there's
something to be said for practice
making perfect. There are only so
many kinks you can throw at a
new "acquaintance" before the
poor soul bolts into the night for
the relative safety of FroSoCo.
