# HEAD TO HEAD: Stanford, Oregon editors sound off on football game
## 
### DAILY SPORTS STAFF 
With Stanford set to square off
against Oregon this Saturday, The Stan
ford Daily's managing editor of sports,
Kabir Sawhney, and The Oregon Daily
Emerald's sports editor, Lucas Clark,
break down the matchup between the
Cardinal and the Ducks.
Lucas Clark: I can think of very few
things that left more of a bitter taste in
my mouth than when I walked out of
Stanford Stadium last Nov. 7. Not only
did we face an eight-hour drive back to
Eugene, but Oregon had just had its na
tional championship hopes run into the
ground by Toby Gerhart.The game was
one of the few low points in 2009 and
should make for a very interesting
matchup come Saturday. With the
ESPN College Game Day crew rolling
into town for a showdown between two
top 10 teams, it's hard to say where the

clear advantage lies at this point.
Kabir Sawhney: Stanford's upset of
Oregon had to be one of the highlights
of last year for Cardinal fans. Coupled
with the dismantling of USC, it marked
the return of Stanford football to the
ranks of Pac-10 contenders. I still re
member rushing the field after that
game, convinced that the trajectory of
the program only pointed upward.
While Oregon has been the consen
sus favorite in the Pac-10 since the end
of last year's Rose Bowl.it should be in
teresting to see if the Cardinal can
replicate last year's result. I think the
game's location is going to play a big
factor in this one; Stanford has yet to go
on the road this year against an oppo
nent of Oregon's caliber, and Autzen
Stadium is a difficult place for visiting
teams to play.
LC: No question Oregon has one of
the best home-field advantages in the
college football realm. Eugene is noto
rious for the ruckus its can cause in the
venue rain, sleet or shine. But this
game is going to be about neither the
weather nor the fans, ft will be about
what happens between the lines of play
with two of the best teams in the coun
try. Despite a some what lackluster per
formance last weekend against Ari
zona State, the Ducks still have one of
the most dangerous offensive attacks
in the nation. If it weren't for the
strength of the offense I might find my
self worried if Oregon could hang with
Andrew Luck and Co. But no matter
how many points the Cardinal puts up,
Oregon is capable of matching the
total. The key variable: both defenses.
KS: You're absolutely right about
the defenses. While both have been
putting up impressive numbers, nei
ther has faced a truly elite offense. For
the Ducks, the toughest offense so far
has been Arizona State; for Stanford, it
was Wake Forest. I'm particularly con
cerned about how the Stanford sec
ondary will match up against Darron
Thomas and the passing game. From
what we've seen so far, Stanford's
front seven is as good as any in the
country, and the Cardinal's identity is
built on a brute-force, smash mouth
game on both sides of the ball. Howev
er, Stanford's best playmaker in the
secondary this season, safety Michael
Thomas, was injured last weekend
against Notre Dame, and whether the
secondary will be able to contain Ore
gon's receiving corps remains an open
question.

LC: In previous seasons, Oregon's
receiving corps has been a bit of a
question mark in the early going. The
Ducks have taken as many as four
games to really develop a consistent
passing attack, but that hasn't been the

case in 2010. Led by all-everything
senior Jeff Maehl, the Oregon wide
outs have been one of the offensive
bright spots this season. Senior Lavasi
er Tuinei has been a welcomed sur
prise after a shaky 2009 season, and
true freshman Josh Huff has been the
only first-year player to make an im
pact with the first-team Oregon of
fense. The front seven for Stanford,
both physically imposing and intelli
gent with their schemes, will provide
Oregon with an extremely tough look
up front. The pride of every Oregon
team has always been in the running
game, and in order for the Ducks to
stay undefeated through week five, ex
pect a heavy dose of sophomores
LaMichael James and Kenjon Barner.
KS:I 'm sure the prospect of James
and Barner running all over the Cardi
nal is one that keeps the defensive
coaching staff up at night. To stop
them, Stanford is going to rely heavily
on its linebackers, led by all-world sen
ior Owen Marecic, to contain the run
ning game just like it held down Notre
Dame last weekend. Stanford's run
ning game is a major component of its
offense, too, with a trio of runners:
sophomores Stepfan Taylor and Tyler
Gaffney and redshirt freshman Usua
Amanam, with freshman Anthony
Wilkerson occasionally in the mix. To
the amazement of many commenta
tors, who predicted a huge drop-off
after Toby Gerhart left for the NFL,
the Cardinal running attack hasn't
missed a beat, largely due to the dom
inance of the offensive line. That line
was a big part of Gerhart's success last
season, and it returned four starters
this year. Look for Stanford to try and
pound the Oregon front seven into
submission, which should open some
holes for Andrew Luck and the pass
ing game.
