## LOCAL Caltrain focuses on mental health issues Railway joins support groups to help local teens 
### CAITY MONROE DESK EDITOR 
Caltrain officials have joined with local
organizations and support groups to ad
dress the five young deaths that plagued
Palo Alto between May 2009 and January
2010.
Last Monday, the first of 250 new sui
cide prevention signs were put up along a
10-mile stretch of Caltrain tracks, one
measure groups are taking to communi
cate, in the words of the signs, that "there
is help."
Adorning the new signs are those words
and a hotline. The signs a collaborative
effort among Caltrain, Palo Alto-based
Project Safety Net, county mental health
organizations in both San Mateo and
Santa Clara counties, and the American
Association of Suicidology (AAS) re
place older ones that have been up since
2001.
Caltrain spokeswoman Christine Dunn
said the old signs, which had the hotline
number listed as 1-800-SUICIDE, had be
come less effective with the rise of smart
phones, which don't have the same letter
number correlation on their keypads.
"The telephone number was no longer
effective," she said. "And the other reason
that we introduced new signs is that we

have a new telephone number on there
that goes to a local crisis intervention cen
ter ... [which] is going to keep track of
the telephone calls so we can determine
whether or not the signs actually work."
That call-tracking process is an impor
tant component of a larger ongoing study
by the AAS that includes two other rail
roads on the east coast.
"This is just an initial study to determine
if signage helps," said Michael Garb, chief
executive officer of Youth and Family En
richment Services and a partner in the
project. "Other things may be determined
to be more helpful. It's sort of a multi
phased project," he added.
Indeed, the signs are only a small part
of several endeavors within the communi
ty to address mental health issues and
youth development led by Project Safety
Net, a community task force involved with
the implementation of the new signage.
According to Project Safety Net's co
chair, Rob de Geus, the task force is com
posed of about 40 different agencies and
groups, including parents, physicians, non
profits and other youth-serving organiza
tions.
De Geus cited 22 strategies adopted by
the task force that fall under the cate
gories of education, prevention and inter
vention.
"One of the priorities that we've come
up with in terms of this year is gatekeeper
training," he said. Gatekeeper training is
given to adults who work as youth advi
sors. It is especially targeted toward advi

sors who aren't in the medical field, aren't
psychologists or aren't knowledgeable
about suicide prevention. The aim is to
give these advisors the skills and re
sources to recognize danger signs and
refer youth to the proper professional
help.
This emphasis on general mental health
has lead to initiatives aimed at fostering a
better environment for youth develop
ment as a whole. De Geus cited 40 devel
opmental assets developed by the Min
neapolis-based Search Institute that help
children and teens thrive. Those resources
include support networks, positive values
and social competencies.
"We're on a campaign to talk about de
velopmental assets with the goal of every
citizen in Palo Alto becoming asset

builders," he said.
The breadth of solutions to these issues
has been matched by the impressive scope
of community participation, some say.
"I think it's not one organization or
agency that is able to solve the mental
health problems of a community," Garb
said. "It takes the efforts of everyone in
the community."
De Geus also emphasized community
dedication and expressed hope for this
collaborative effort's success. "It has been
... certainly a very tragic year, but the
community has really come together
around this community task force to make
a difference," he said.

Signs like these, above, at local Caltrain stations are set to be replaced as community
groups seek to improve mental health resources around the railway.
