## ZAP has rat sightings, nabs one captive 
### ELLEN HUET MANAGING EDITOR 
Rat sightings and other evidence of rat
presence in ZAP, the Cowell Cluster house,
this week ended with the capture of one rat
late Thursday night.
Staff members estimate that the first
signs of rat presence appeared on Sunday
or Monday, with rat sightings in two rooms
as well as multiple instances of rat drop
pings in rooms.
The rat sightings and other evidence
have been contained to one wing of the
first floor of the house, affecting five rooms.
"We can't be sure, but we think they've
been traveling through the vents in be
tween rooms," said ZAP financial manager
RushiTalati'll.

Residents also have spotted rats in the
house's courtyard. Two rooms have seen a
rat and others have found droppings

around the house, including in one resi
dent's bed, said resident Yashraj Narang
'll. Narang himself had a run-in with a pest
on Tuesday night when he "looked up and
saw a big old rat staring at me from the
inner doorway" before the rat "scurried
away."
After the initial sightings, the house no
tified facilities managers. Maintenance
workers sealed some of the vents in the af
fected area. An exterminator from Crane
Pest Control came, but was unable to find
any rat, so he set out traps. Before Thursday
night, he and the residents had little suc
cess.
Late Thursday night, a rat was caught.
"The exterminator had to kill it and take it
away," said ZAP resident assistant Aaron
Zarraga 'lO.
"It's questionable if it was ever more
than one rat, though we're not sure," Zarra
ga said. "We're really hoping it's just one.

It's a small victory."
Zarraga, Talati and ZAP community
manager Lisa Abdilova 'll all praised the
responsiveness of the exterminator, who
said he often responded to calls as late as
2:00 a.m.
Although the rat's presence led a hand
ful of house residents to sleep elsewhere
for the week, the shared fear of the rat pres
ence mostly led to resident bonding, Ab
dilova said.
"As staff, I was concerned about the res
idents, but they've all gotten closer over
this," she said. "It's become like a little
game: 'Let's find that rat.'"
Stanford Housing was notified of the rat
presence over the weekend and has since
been working to address the problem by
hiring pest controllers and encouraging
residents to keep doors closed, wrote

An exterminator set traps around ZAP
to keep out unwanted pests, which residents
began seeing this week. They
trapped one rat on Thursday after
bonding over the search, they say.
Housing executive director Rodger
Whitney in an e-mail to The Daily.
Whitney said that while there have
been no other recent rodent reports
in other residences, the problem is
not a new one.
"It is important to remember that
Stanford was and is a farm, and that
there are animals of all sorts on cam
pus, which do sometimes attempt to
enter the residences," he said.
The Cowell Cluster recently un
derwent a pathway replacement
project, Whitney said, adding that it
is "entirely possible that the rat's
home in the wild was disrupted
through this construction and that it
ventured indoors looking for a new
home," staying put once it found a
source of food.
