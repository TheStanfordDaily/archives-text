## Stanford, Palo Alto object to high-speed rail High-speed rail proves slow to gain support on the peninsula 
### CASSANDRA FELICIANO DESK EDITOR 
With Palo Alto's substantial nine-to-five demo
graphic, it's no wonder the city's ridership at the Uni
versity Avenue Caltrain station is through the roof
second only to San Francisco. But just two years into its
planning phase, the California High Speed Rail Project
faces derailment by public opinion from the city and
the Farm.
The top concern: commuter overload.
California High Speed Rail Authority's (HSRA)
800-mile high-speed train system, approved in 2008 as
Proposition IA, would run from San Francisco to San
Diego with a stop in one of two mid-peninsula cities,
Palo Alto or Redwood City. Mountain View dropped
out of the running on Sept. 13.
In Palo Alto, the proposed station would be at the
current Caltrain stop on University Avenue, which is on
Stanford property, and cross Sand Hill Road, El
Camino Real and Galvez Street.
The University vocalized its opposition to the sta
tion on Sept. 20, sharing many of the same concerns as
Palo Alto city officials.
"It's like building a mini-airport, what [the High
Speed Rail Authority] wants to do," said Jean McCown,
director of community relations at Stanford. "We're
concerned that University Avenue is already congested
as it is."
Holman said HSRA reports show ridership would
average 7,800 daily. That's in addition to more than
36,000 Caltrain riders, according to Caltrain reports re
leased in February.
"We really just don't have the capacity to accommo
date that size," said City Councilwoman Nancy Shep
herd, who serves on the city's high-speed rail subcom
mittee, "We would have to reconfigure University Av
enue."
Shepherd added that the numbers become more
significant in light of the 10,000 new visitors expected
with the proposed Stanford hospital expansion, which
already is poised to burden traffic, according to a draft
environmental impact report (EIR) earlier this year.
To accommodate riders, HSRA's plans require a
3,000-car parking garage and the city of Palo Alto to
foot the bill an estimated $l5O million, said Shep
herd. This ticket makes city officials even more hesitant
as Palo Alto still has a $5OO million infrastructure proj
ect backlog that needs funding, including street im
provements, new emergency facilities and community
services.
"I'm not seeing how it's going to be compatible with
the city's Comprehensive Plan," said Councilwoman
Karen Holman.
At 37,000 square feet, the HSR garage would be
much larger than any parking structure in the city.
The city is considering joining
neighbors Menlo Park and Ather
ton in a lawsuit against the HSRA,
Holman said. The suit is based on
what they say is an inadequate EIR;
Holman declined to elaborate on
details.
The high-speed rail is not com

pletely without benefits. More rail
traffic means fewer cars on the road,
more shoppers and less-crowded air
ports, said HSRA spokeswoman
Rachel Wall. Because the train sys
tem would run separately from road
traffic, there are fewer chances for
vehicle collisions.
Still, Stanford and city council
members said they plan to concen
trate their efforts more toward pre
serving the Caltrain system. Council
members remain concerned that the
HSRA project will pose a threat to

ticket sales for Caltrain, which is al
ready facing major budget cuts due
to a $3O million deficit.
Although groundbreaking is pro
jected for 2012, trains are not expect
ed to run until 2020 and Shepherd
said HSRA could just as easily de
cline to set a station in Palo Alto. In
the meantime, a public discussion is
set for Oct. 7 with final EIRs to be re
leased this winter.
