# STETHOSCOPES, COMPILERS AND HEMINGWAY
## Students Are Not Customers 
### Aaditya Shidham 
One of the defining characteristics of
Stanford in the eyes of The Princeton
Review is that the school operates so
smoothly it "runs like butter." This compli
ment appealed to me when I was considering
colleges as a senior in high school. I wondered
how such a free, innovative place could also
"run like butter."

As a freshman, I continued to be amazed.
It seemed that there were invisible genies
that took down and put up decorations and
signs, coordinating thousands of events every
quarter seamlessly, all as I went to class and
chatted with friends and did my homework.
As the state of California went bankrupt and
America was in financial crisis, Stanford of
fered tens of thousands of dollars in grant
money to undergraduate students.
I realize now that this smooth operation
comes at a price: it comes with a paradigm of
"business as usual" that students trust be
cause so much is handled so well at the Uni
versity level.
This trust and the huge workload of
the Stanford administration has slowly
converted Stanford into an academic-indus
trial complex. Now don't get me wrong. It's a
sunny, jolly complex, complete with smiling
administrators and as little red tape as possi
ble, which means still a lot. But at the end, we
are paying, quarter after quarter, a school
that is shrewd with its money and ambitious
with its space. "Business as usual" has put
University operations under the tyranny of
the all-powerful dollar.
This is an unflattering characteristic that
our beloved school shares with almost every
other large university in America. An organi
zation that is media-hungry, jealously guards
its reputation and shields its clientele from
competitors could just as easily describe any
21st-century American university as it could
describe your neighborly multinational cor
poration.
What are some problems? The more en
trenched the product, the less your comment
essentially matters. There is almost a unani
mous consensus that Axess must die and I
have a feeling that the administration knows
this without the need for a single survey. Yet
the administration isn't responsive to this
comment because Axess only grows with in
ertia over time, and the cost to replace it be
comes enormous. Again, the dollar lord re-

mains almighty.
And then there are the legacy admits. A lit
tle less than a year ago, this very newspaper
published a startling statistic: almost one fifth
of my class, the Class of 2013, had a legacy at
Stanford, according to Dean of Admission
Richard Shaw. This percentage of legacies is
head-and-shoulders above some elite East
Coast schools. Furthermore, across the pond,
the universities that usually embody class and
privilege, such as Oxford and Cambridge, all
abandoned legacy admits decades ago.
Again, from a corporate mindset, the
practice of legacy admission is a practical
one: it supposedly emboldens alumni loyalty
and entices donors to fill University coffers.
If students are customers, then they will be
loyal donors to the brand if their progeny can
have the privilege of being customers as well.
Yet at a philosophical level, such admis
sions are deeply problematic. New York

Times op-ed columnist Richard Kahlenberg
recently wrote in "Elite Colleges, or Colleges
for the Elite?" that legacy admissions are dis
tinctly an American privilege and, at the
same time, paradoxically un-American be
cause they undermine the notion of meritoc
racy that this nation was founded on.
There are so many cases where the notion
of "business as usual" works well in the uni
versity context. But upon closer inspection,
there are just as many cases where such a no
tion doesn't work at all. The practical and the
moneymaking are often prided above the
morally correct and the popular.
1 don't know if Stanford can adjust or
more precisely, 1 don't know if it can afford to
adjust its mindset. But it must. If it wants
to be a leader of a true liberal arts education,
it needs to stop running a non-profit educa
tional institution as if it were a for-profit ed
ucational commodity.
Stanford, we are not here as customers of
an experience. We're here for much more
than that. We are here to shape our very souls
and minds. Please don't forget this.

What do you think about Stanford's corpo
ratism? Is it a necessary effect of the pressures of
21st-century American higher education?
