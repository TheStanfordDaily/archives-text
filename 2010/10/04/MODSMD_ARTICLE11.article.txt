Seeking support for military
students

Dear Editor:
I am writing in response to "Bring ROTC
back to campus" (Sept. 29) in order to correct
its assertions regarding a lack of support for
military-connected students. I am Sebastain
Gould, a sophomore in the philosophy de
partment and a veteran of the war in Iraq. I
joined the Marine Corps after my freshman
year at Stanford and deployed to Iraq that
next summer. When I returned to campus, I
experienced some hostility. I partly expected
this, but I didn't know just how distressing it
would be.

My hope is to help change this. I am the
Military Service as Public Service student co
ordinator at the Haas Center. With its help,
and support from the President's Office, we
are trying to build a community more respon
sive to veteran and ROTC needs. The Presi
dent's Office currently funds transportation to
and from ROTC events for enrolled cadets. It
also funds luncheons with guest speakers and
dinner events, including the upcoming Veter
an's Day barbecue at Sigma Nu. Students, staff
and faculty are all welcome to attend!
