I remember well the "debate" leading up to
the war in Iraq. First, a fringe right-wing po
sition was drawn up by a motivated seg
ment of the nation's elite. Then the propagan
da onslaught began, blasting the public with a
smorgasbord of deceptive justifications for
bloodshed, with both "conservative" and
mainstream media outlets banging the war
drums. Conscientious citizens who opposed an
illegal and immoral war were largely excluded
from the "debate," often with a deafening bray
of, "Support the troops!" (as if the best way to
"support" a person were to catapult him into a
war zone to kill and be killed).
We face a similar, smaller-scale debate
about militarism today, but it's not a foreign
country that is going to be invaded it's our
university.
The Stanford Daily and The Stanford Re
view have both recently come out against keep
ing the various military ROTC programs off
Stanford's campus. Their editorials have been
more verbose versions of that nauseating yel
low-ribbon, bumper-sticker splatter. The thing
about the refrain "Support the troops," howev
er, is that it is a cleverly designed propaganda
phrase designed to distract from the implied
message: "Support our policies." It is the policy
of transforming the campus into a four-year
military staging area, and whether it benefits
the campus as a whole, that we should be dis
cussing not vacuous and misleading slogans.
So, is there a compelling reason to bring
ROTC back on campus? If there is a good ar
gument, I haven't heard it. One argument that

I can identify is from a 2007 Daily editorial
much to the same effect as this year's. It makes
the case that poor kids are disproportionately
killed in war and postulates that rich kids
should be killed as well, as if the real problem
were economic inequality of corpses instead of
human beings getting killed in the first place.
And there are plenty of reasons to exclude
ROTC. First, I'm not aware of any other organ
ization that blackmails its members with finan
cial penalties if they discover years down the
road that the group isn't for them. Second, I
also haven't heard of any student group that
forces its members to pledge several years of
their lives to the organization after graduation.
These requirements make Stanford less of an
institution to nurture intellectual interests and
more of an assembly line for the Army.
Third and most important, we must decide
if hosting an enduring presence of the U.S. mil
itary on campus is compatible with Stanford's
mission. By my count, the military currently
runs afoul of the ideals the University purports
to stand for. Stanford's founding grant calls for
the University to "[exercise] an influence on
behalf of humanity and civilization." Does
training students to participate in the world's
most effective and well-financed killing ma
chine facilitate this goal? Clearly not.
Campus militarization advocates often
state that attitudes have changed since the
Vietnam (and Cambodian and Lao) War. That
is true, but not in the way that they think.
American aggression in Indochina was not op
posed en masse until many years after the start
of the war, while the most recent Iraq war was
protested before it even began. All peoples are
by nature pacifistic, but the civilizing influence
of the '6os and beyond in this country has made
many confront the gruesome reality of what
war is and question why anyone should be as
sisting its execution.
Thus is it really any wonder why, in The Re
view's words, "all we hear is silence from the

students"? Perhaps students are less than en
thusiastic about their university being turned
into a military base.
The Review's suggestion that students
would be clamoring for ROTC's return if they
were better informed about the program is
patently absurd or is this just a not-so-subtle
way of declaring all people who oppose mili
tarism ignorant? Either way, not too convincing.
In any event, "don't ask, don't tell" still re
mains in the way before we can liberate out-of
the-closet gays to go halfway around the world
to shoot up Afghanistan. But once DADT is
repealed, and everyone recognizes its days are
numbered, ROTC should stay where it is: out
of our school.
