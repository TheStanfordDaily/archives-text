# Why the Military Matters
## 
### JESSICA KNIGHT 'lO History WILLIAM TRESEDER 'll Science, Technology Society 
Last fall, we were approached independ
ently and asked to head up the Stanford
chapter of a new program called the Tru
man Service Initiative (TSI). Its parent organ
ization, the Truman National Security Project,
"recruits, trains and positions a new generation
of Progressives across America to lead on na
tional security." After meeting with the nation
al directors, we both decided to volunteer for
the job.
It took several weeks for each of us to figure
out the other was a political conservative.
Imagine our surprise.
Rather than undermine TSl's goals, this dis
covery highlighted the importance of our work
on campus. National security issues have be
come something you only care about if you

lean right politically. Stanford is not alone in
this. The three-year pilot program also was in
stituted at Yale, Princeton, University of
Chicago and Columbia all places known for
their active, involved and, dare we say, over
achieving, students. But even so, the program
had trouble finding students with the neces
sary interest and experience to act as campus
directors.The fact is that progressives who care
about national security are a rarity on elite
campuses, as is non-politicized discussion of
these issues.
We saw this as a gap in our collective educa
tion. This is about citizenship, not politics as
shown by the two conservatives who volun
teered their time to a progressive organization.
As students, we constantly are reminded that
we are tomorrow's leaders in academia, busi
ness and government. Why, then, do so few of
us know the differences between the Army
and the Marine Corps? Or that there even are
differences?
We see you out there, physics major, rolling
your eyes because you don't care and can't
imagine why you should. But you vote, don't
you? You pay taxes? Your money funds our
defense budget. Your security is entrusted to
our military personnel. You cannot pursue
your research without the assumption of a safe
environment.
It is even truer for those of you who take ex
ception to the military's past or current poli
cies. You cannot hope to reform an institution
that you do not understand. You cannot speak
convincingly to its leaders if you do not share
their vocabulary, grasp their perspectives or
understand their particular hardships.
After its beginning in October 2009, TSI
hosted a number of events on campus to help
start a dialogue about national security and its
relevance to all Stanford students: Military 101
seminars, a lecture on global terrorism, a panel
with Stanford ROTC cadets and a roundtable
on military conscription. It was a busy, success

ful, exciting year and that brings us to the
present.
We realize we're a little late with this op-ed.
It is partly Jessie's fault; she wrote a thesis,
graduated and in the process ignored three
months of e-mail. It is partly William's fault; he
took a leave of absence from Stanford to reen
list in the Marines and currently is deployed to
Afghanistan. As you can imagine, it has been
hard for us to coordinate.
But isn't that what this is all about? The
Marine in Afghanistan and the civilian in her
living room, the six-foot-something guy and
the five-foot-something girl, the student veter
an and the student with no military connec
tion at all. We come from different back
grounds and face different challenges. In this,
we represent the great diversity of the Stan
ford population. But we also represent its ulti
mate commonality: we are both students, and
we are both citizens. Our job is to learn and to
serve in the positions and according to the
skills we uniquely possess. We will vote. We
will pay a lot of taxes. One of us will fight. It is
important, therefore, that we both know
about our military, its capabilities and mis
sions and the people who wear its uniforms
regardless of our politics.
Stanford prides itself on intellectual en
gagement and frank debate, but these attitudes
have not been applied to discussions of nation
al defense. Our hope is that efforts like TSI, the
Haas Center's Understanding Military Service
as Public Service Initiative, expanded ROTC
programs and defense-focused Student Initiat
ed Courses will make Stanford an example of
how an elite university can reconnect with the
military community to the advantage of both
great institutions.
