After four games in which it never trailed, the
Stanford men's soccer team came back to earth on
Saturday night, courtesy of a talented and speedy
California squad. The No. 16 Golden Bears (5-1-2,1-
0 Pac-10) scored early and held off a rejuvenated
Cardinal team after the break, before adding two
more goals in the final two minutes. The final score
for both teams' Pac-10 opener was 3-0 in favor of Cal.
The loss was painful for the Cardinal (4-5,0-1) on
multiple levels.
Redshirt freshman goalkeeper Jason Dodson suf
fered a dislocated left shoulder while making a div
ing save in the first few minutes. In addition, senior
defender Bobby Warshaw ran into redshirt senior
Thiago Sa Freire while trying to head a cross out of
the box. After the collision, Warshaw had to change
jerseys because his shirt was covered in blood from a
cut on his head, and Sa Freire's eye nearly swelled
shut within minutes. While each returned to the field,
both players' injuries required stitches on the side
lines.
Dodson's shoulder was relocated on the field, and
he was due to have an MRI to determine the extent
of the injury on Sunday afternoon.
Injuries are nothing new this year, however. Sev
eral players are not fully healthy, including veteran
senior Garrett Gunther and juniors Ben Grafentin,
Alexander Binnie and Adoni Levine, Sophomore
Eric Anderson saw action for the first time since an
early September injury derailed his season.
"Injuries are just a part of the game," said sopho
more Hunter Gorskie. "[Goalkeeper Jason] Dodson
has been at the top of his game recently, so it's unfor
tunate, but now the next guy just has to step up."
That "next guy" was true freshman Drew
Hutchins from Morrisville, Pa. Hutchins came into
the game in the 11th minute and was immediately
tested just minutes later by the strong wing play of
the Bears. An attack down the left side resulted in a
driven cross that found sophomore forward John
Fitzpatrick, who knocked the header past Hutchins.
The Cal offense continued a relentless assault on
Stanford's flanks and maintained a 13-4 advantage in

shots at halftime.
But the Cardinal stepped it up after a talk by head
coach Bret Simon and came out with renewed ag
gression. While the Bears still had several chances,
Stanford controlled the ball and the run of play.
"We needed to be fighting a little harder in the be
ginning," Gorskie said. "Their passing was more ac
curate, and they had us on the defensive, so it was
only a matter of time before they got a good look.
"Overall, we needed to be much more aggressive
and dictate the style of play from the outset," he
added. "We did a much better job of that after the
half-
Senior forward Dominique Yahyavi nearly found
an equalizer when he won a challenge with the Cal
goalkeeper, but his chip shot from 30 yards away flew
over the bar. Warshaw nearly found the back of the
net soon after in the 70th minute when a bending cor
ner kick found him streaking in, but he too sent his
shot above the frame.
With the offense shifting into gear, the Bears
seemed vulnerable. But the Cardinal became a little
too anxious in its attempts, leaving too few men be
hind the ball. With just two minutes to play, Cal coun
tered and put two more goals away, the last coming
from a deflection that left Hutchins helpless.
"Drew is a terrific goalkeeper, but we put him in
an awfully tough position as a freshman coming into
a rivalry game in the Pac-10," Simon said. "It was not
a get-your-feet-wet kind of game. It was a very tough
game, but he is a very athletic goalie, and he did rea
sonably well in a tough situation."
As the team continues Pac-10 play with a road
trip to Oregon State and Washington next weekend,
Simon hopes that the players take this loss and learn
from it.
"We changed out of our game plan, and we left
ourselves very vulnerable," he said. "The message I
hope the guys get is they have to be patient they
got impatient again at the end.
"We have to stick with our game plan it's a
game plan that we believe can win."
The Cardinal heads to Seattle this Friday for a
matchup with the No. 23 Huskies at 7 p.m.
