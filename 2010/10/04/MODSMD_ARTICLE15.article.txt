# Volleyball stays unbeaten for season
## 
### CAROLINE CASELLI DESK EDITOR 
Playing in front of a home crowd
for the first time since early Septem
ber, the No. 1 Stanford women's vol
leyball team did not disappoint,
sweeping both Oregon State (8-10,1-
3 Pac-10) and No. 11 Oregon (14-2,2-
2) this past weekend.
On Friday, Stanford (14-0, 4-0)
took down the Beavers in dominant
fashion, winning three straight sets,
25-14,25-17,25-19.
The Card kicked off the match
with a kill from senior outside hitter
Alix Klineman, the first of her match
leading 16 kills. Despite several early
service and hitting errors, the Stanford
frontline of junior middle blocker
Stephanie Browne and freshman out
side hitter Rachel Williams was fero
cious, combining for eight early kills to
extend Stanford's lead to 13-8. Con
tinued offensive power from Kline
man, Browne and Williams, spot-on
sets from senior setter Cassidy Licht
man and Oregon State errors secured
the first set, 25-14.
Sophomore defensive specialist
Flannah Benjamin began the second
set with an impressive string of serves,
including one ace, to help the Card to
a quick 7-0 start. Strong hitting from
Beaver senior Jill Sawatzky and fresh
man Mona Kressl brought the game
within four points at 17-13, but the
Card could not be stopped. Sopho
more opposite Hayley Spelman put
down her fifth kill of the set to win the
set, 25-17.
After two hitting errors to open
the third set, Stanford regrouped.
Solid defensive play from senior

libero Gabi Ailes, who tallied six digs
in the set, combined with continued
relentless attacks from Klineman and
Spelman, secured the set and match
victory over Oregon State, 25-19.
Klineman, Spelman and Williams
all had kills in the double digits, with
16,12 and 10, respectively, and Licht
man led the match with 41 assists. De
fensively, Ailes had 16 digs, Benjamin
had eight and Klineman and Licht
man had seven apiece.
For the Beavers, Sawatzky and
Kressl each had eight kills, with Kressl
boasting a .538 hitting percentage on
the night. Sophomore libero Alyssa

O'Neil had 15 digs, and sophomore
setter Megan Mc√üride tallied 23 as
sists.
The next day, Stanford faced No. 11
Oregon, which had just suffered its
first loss of the season at No. 8 Califor
nia the night before. The Oregon
squad provided no contest for the
Card, which swept the Ducks 25-10,
25-16,25-21.
The momentum was in Stanford's
hands from the get-go, with a match
opening block from freshman middle
blocker Carly Wopat followed by
three straight aces from Ailes. With
two kills apiece from Klineman and

Browne and yet another Ailes ace, the
Cardinal jumped out to an early 9-0
lead that Oregon could never over
come. Stanford easily won the first set,
25-10.

The second set began more even
ly, but when Ailes returned to the serv
ice line, Stanford began to pull away
again, aided by the offensive prowess
of Klineman and Browne. Already
holding a five-point lead at 11-6, Stan
ford went on another six-point run led
by the serving of Benjamin and Spel
man's four kills to extend the lead to
17-6. The Ducks mustered up several
kills from their outside hitters, senior

Heather Meyers and sophomore
Katherine Fischer, but consecutive
Klineman-Spelman kills ended the
set, 25-16.
The third set was the closest of the
night, with Browne, Spelman and
Klineman exchanging kills with Ore
gon's Fischer and Meyers. Oregon
redshirt sophomore outside hitter
Alaina Bergsma put down a kill to
bring the Ducks within one point at
13-12, but a Klineman kill followed by
three kills from Williams, extended
the Card's lead to 17-13. With four
more Klineman kills and yet another
Ailes ace, the four-point difference
was never made up, and Stanford won
the set and match 25-21.
Klineman led the match with 17
kills and a .455 hitting percentage, and
Spelman and Williams contributed
identical lines of nine kills and .389 hit
ting percentages. Ailes dug 18 balls
and served five aces, and Lichtman
put up a match-high 38 assists.
For the Ducks, Meyers boasted 12
kills and a .458 hitting percentage, and
Fischer and Bergsma added seven
kills apiece. Freshman setter Lauren
Plum contributed 25 assists and three
digs, and sophomore libero Haley
Jacob had 11 digs.
While the Card has rolled over its op
ponents all season, these wins looked
a bit different with a notable lineup
change Stanford ran a 5-1 system
with senior setter and opposite Cas
sidy Lichtman functioning as the pri
mary setter on all rotations. Sopho
more setter Karissa Cook, who typi
cally shares the setting duties with
Lichtman, was sidelined by an injury
