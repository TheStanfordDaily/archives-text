# Avoiding a football letdown
## 
### Daniel Bohm 
It may sound cliche, but it's gut
check time for the Stanford foot
ball team. After steamrolling its
first four opponents, the Cardinal
is now facing its first bit of adversi
ty, having fallen Saturday to Oregon and
its video game-like offense.
Stanford seemed to be in control of
the game in the first half —Andrew
Luck was leading the offense up and
down the field, and the Cardinal defense
was being disruptive enough to force
three Oregon turnovers. And then Ore
gon scored, recovered an onside kick
and never looked back.
Now, how will the Stanford team re
spond? After losing such a hyped game
it may have been the biggest Stanford
game in years after seemingly being
in control, lots of teams would fold. Lots
of teams would struggle to overcome the
disappointment and would carry that
emotion into their next game. With an
angry USC team looming, Stanford can't
afford that.
USC is going to be motivated when it
invades the Farm on Saturday. As most
of the country probably knows, Jim Har
baugh's Cardinal didn't exactly let off the
gas last year when it was pummeling the
Trojans in the Coliseum. That win left
many in southern California none too
pleased.
That, the Stanford loss and the fact
that USC fell on Saturday to Washing
ton,make next Saturday very dangerous.
It has all the ingredients of a letdown.
But then again, the same could be
said for the Trojans.
Nobody expected Stanford to go un
defeated this season. Despite the loss to
Oregon, a Rose Bowl berth is not at all
out of the question, so responding in a big
way against another talented team next
week is vitally important.
I don't know what Chip Kelly served
his Ducks at halftime on Saturday, but in
the second half, Oregon controlled every
aspect of the football game. For the first
time in a year and a hal£ Stanford was get
ting dominated in the trenches. Andrew
Luck didn't have time to pass, and the
Cardinal front three (or four) were get
ting pushed downfield on the defensive
side of the ball.
This was understandable, Oregon's
offense was moving at a million miles an
hour, and Stanford was playing in a hos
tile environment. What can't happen
now is a loss of confidence. Stanford's of
fensive line remains one of, if not the best
in the conference, and that crew needs to
get back at it.
Luckily for Stanford, that same rab
ble-rouser that got under the skin of Tro
jan faithful last year Harbaugh is
the man tasked with ensuring that Stan
ford regroups from being outscored 49-
10 after taking an early 18-point lead. If
there is a man up to that task, it is Har
baugh, who I am sure will do everything
in his power to ensure that the Cardinal
roster is thinking only about this coming
week and not last week.
The rest of Stanford's schedule is
quite manageable. From here on out,
Stanford is likely to be favored in every
game, so if the team doesn't play its own
worst enemy, as was the case in Satur
day's second half, things set up awfully
well.
