## Turner to lead STS program McGinn, 12-year director, will step down in August 
### ASHLEY MENZIES 
Communication Prof. Fred Turner
is set to replace longtime Science,
Technology and Society (STS) Direc
tor Robert McGinn next fall after
McGinn's three-year appointment
ends in August.
McGinn, a management science
and engineering professor, co-direct
ed the program with history Prof.
Paula Findlin from 1998 to 2003,
when he became the sole director.
Under his tenure, STS became the
third-largest interdisciplinary pro
gram at Stanford. An undergraduate
program, it grants bachelor's degrees
of both arts and science.
"It's the most fulfilling thing I've
ever done," McGinn wrote in an e
mail to The Daily. "I would do it all
over again."
Turner shares McGinn's enthusi
asm about STS and has served on the
program board for several years.
When Humanities and Sciences
Dean Richard Sailer offered Turner
the job, he accepted.
"Fred Turner has a great back
ground to direct STS," Sailer said.
"He is a passionate teacher and does
research on how technology has
changed the nature of communica
tion over the generation a perfect
fit for STS."
Turner's assumption of the STS di
rectorship has been met with much
enthusiasm.
"Fred Turner has a passion for the
scholarly issues surrounding science
and technology and an inspiring vi
sion of the future of the STS pro
gram," said communication Prof. Je
remy Bailenson.
Turner's vision for the program in
cludes enhancing the intersection be
tween the worlds of engineering, the
humanities and the social sciences.
"One of the most exciting things
about Stanford is the sheer number
of faculty and students thinking
about issues that cross these three
areas," Turner said. "We would like
STS to continue to be a central gath
ering point for those folks."
Four faculty members, two from
the School of Engineering and two
from the School of Humanities and
Sciences, founded the program in
1971, McGinn said.
"Involving faculty from both
schools has yielded research and
teaching benefits that simply would
not have happened if the program
had been a one-school venture,"
McGinn said.
"I'm very much looking forward
to having Robert's input next year,"
Turner wrote in an e-mail to The
Daily. "He has been at the core of
STS at Stanford for a number of
years, and I very much hope he con
tinues to stay involved with the pro
gram."
McGinn oversaw the program's
surge in popularity, exceeded among
interdisciplinary majors only by
human biology and international re
lations. In 1996, only 20 students ma
jored in STS, but the number reached
150 last spring. This year, about 50
students will graduate with either
bachelor of arts or bachelor of sci
ence degrees.
Many of these graduating seniors
will go on to work for tech companies.
These companies respond positively
to the backgrounds of STS majors,
which combine humanities and so
cial-science perspectives with varying
levels of technical course work, blur
ring the popular "fuzzy-techie" dis
tinction.
"As media technologies in par
ticular become Ã¼biquitous, the
lines between the social and the
technological, and even sometimes
between the mechanical and the
biological, have begun to blur,"
Turner said via e-mail. "The STS
program strikes me as a perfect
place in which to think about that
kind of blurring and to prepare stu
dents to live alongside it."
