## Oregon crushes Stanford, 52-31 
### KABIR SAWHNEY MANAGING EDITOR 
In its toughest test of the sea
son to date, the No. 16 Stanford
football team fell to No. 3 Oregon
on Saturday night, 52-31, marking
its first loss of the season.

The game was a tale of two
halves for both teams. While the
Cardinal (4-1,1-1 Pac-10) held a
31-24 lead heading into halftime,
it did not score in the second half
while Oregon (5-0,2-0) lit up the

scoreboard with four more
touchdowns.
"Things didn't quite go our
way in the second half," said Stan
ford head coach Jim Harbaugh.
"We didn't handle some situations
that could have put points on the
board for us."
Stanford came out strong and
dominated the first quarter, forc
ing two Duck turnovers en route
to taking a 21-3 lead.The Cardinal
was quick to capitalize on its op
portunities, scoring 14 points off a
fumble recovery by Delano How
ell and an interception by redshirt
sophomore linebacker Chase
Thomas.

Taylor Skaufel (40) and Thomas Keiser take down Oregon quarterback Darron Thomas. Thomas shredded
Stanford, passing for 238 yards and three touchdowns and rushing for an additional 117 yards and a touchdown.

Redshirt sophomore quarterback Andrew
Luck was methodical in slicing up the Oregon
defense, marching his team down the field for
three touchdowns. He used numerous play
action passes with devastating effectiveness,
notching numerous short- and medium
yardage gains on three-step drops to keep the
offense moving. He capped the game's first
drive with a beautiful pass to junior receiver
Griff Whalen for a touchdown and ran the ball
in from 10 yards out on Stanford's next drive
for its second touchdown.
The quarter also featured a 44-yard touch
down run on the first play after the Chase
Thomas interception from sophomore run
ning back Stepf an Taylor, who has emerged as
the featured back for the Cardinal offense.
In the second quarter, Oregon began to re
cover some of the momentum it had surren
dered to the Cardinal. Duck quarterback Dar
ron Thomas began to assert himself over the
Stanford defense, hitting receiver Jeff Maehl
with a 29-yard touchdown pass early in the
quarter. Maehl completely fooled the Stan

ford defense, and Thomas hit him with no de
fenders within 10 yards.
After the touchdown, Oregon head coach
Chip Kelly went for a dangerous gamble,
electing to go for an onside kick.The Card was
caught completely off-guard, and Oregon
kicker Rob Beard recovered the kick with lit
tle difficulty to give the Ducks an opportunity
to draw closer to Stanford.They capitalized on
that opportunity in short order, going 54 yards
down the field in less than two minutes to
score on a LaMichael James touchdown run.
Oregon moved the ball extremely well against
the Stanford defense, with Thomas using a se
ries of fakes and screens to pick up chunks of
yardage on every play.
With the momentum firmly back on the
Oregon sideline, the Cardinal returned to the
field desperate to regain its composure and
expand its suddenly slim four-point lead. Luck
managed to drive Stanford down the field and
hit redshirt junior Coby Fleener with a 36-
yard touchdown pass, but the Ducks respond
ed with a touchdown of their own on the next
drive. Stanford entered the locker room with a
31-24 lead after notching a field goal as time
expired in the half.
While Stanford was able to compete with
Oregon in the first half, the second half was all
Ducks.The Oregon defense shut out Luck and

the rest of Stanford's offense, while James and
Thomas rolled up points against a suddenly
weak Cardinal defense.
Over the final three quarters, the Ducks
outscored the Cardinal 49-10, including a 28-0
run through the final two quarters. The Ore
gon offense finished with 626 total offensive
yards, including 257 rushing yards and three
touchdowns from James.
"I think it's really hard to keep up with us
because we practice so fast," James said. "We
put a lot into it in practice for the game. So
when it comes to the third or fourth quarter,
and we're down by a touchdown or whatever,
you know, we really feel confident because of
our endurance and our tempo."
Sophomore linebacker Shayne Skov, a de
fensive leader who had nine tackles in the
game, did not mince words about Stanford's
second-half performance.
"Defensively, we just didn't play a good
game," he said. "And they had a great offen
sive game ... we made a lot of mistakes, and
they played great offensively."
The overall performance of the Stanford
defense in the game renewed questions about
whether the unit is strong enough to allow the
Cardinal to be competitive in the Pac-10. Over
Stanford's first four games, the defense
seemed vastly improved, shutting out UCLA

and holding Notre Dame to 14 points how
ever, the Ducks' offense was the first in a slew
of strong Pac-10 offenses that new defensive
coordinator Vic Fangio will have to scheme
against, and it will be interesting to see
whether the defense can respond with better
performances against the remaining oppo
nents on its schedule.
The Cardinal secondary, after showing
flashes of brilliance through Stanford's first
four games, was highly ineffective. The defen
sive backs were methodically shredded by
D arron Thomas, who finished with 20-29 pass
ing for 238 yards and three touchdowns, in ad
dition to running 15 times for 117 yards and
another score.
Stanford's physical front seven, led by
Skov and senior linebacker Owen Marecic,
was supposed to compensate for some of the
deficiencies in the defensive backfield, but
that unit was also gashed by the Ducks, who
ran for 388 yards overall in the game.
On the offensive side of the ball, Stanford's
offense seemed to live up to the hype sur
rounding it throughout the first half, but fal
tered under the pressure and the hostile at
mosphere in Autzen Stadium in the second
half. Unless the offense can handle the pres
sure of playing from behind better, prospects
for its remaining Pac-10 contests look some

what dim.
A crucial play that came early in the fourth
quarter illustrated some of the offense's strug
gles. Down 45-31, the Cardinal faced a third
and-goal at the Oregon one-yard line, but
Luck fumbled the snap and fell on the ball for
a four-yard loss.
"That was my fault," Luck said. "I pulled
out too early and took the negative play."
On the next play, Luck threw a pass intend
ed for redshirt freshman tight end Zach Ertz
in the end zone, but the pass was tipped and
fell incomplete, turning the ball over to the
Ducks.
Though Luck's final stat line for the game
was fairly strong —he went 29-46 for 341
yards and a touchdown his two intercep
tions were very costly, and his final intercep
tion, late in the fourth quarter, sealed the vic
tory for Oregon.
Stanford will try to regroup next weekend,
as it finishes a slate of high-profile opponents
with a home game against USC (4-1,1-I).The
Trojans lost at home to Washington on Satur
day, 32-31.
The game will be nationally televised on
ABC.
