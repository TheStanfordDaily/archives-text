## Oregon crushes Stanford, 52-31 
### KABIR SAWHNEY MANAGING EDITOR 
In its toughest test of the sea
son to date, the No. 16 Stanford
football team fell to No. 3 Oregon
on Saturday night, 52-31, marking
its first loss of the season.

The game was a tale of two
halves for both teams. While the
Cardinal (4-1,1-1 Pac-10) held a
31-24 lead heading into halftime,
it did not score in the second half
while Oregon (5-0,2-0) lit up the

scoreboard with four more
touchdowns.
"Things didn't quite go our
way in the second half," said Stan
ford head coach Jim Harbaugh.
"We didn't handle some situations
that could have put points on the
board for us."
Stanford came out strong and
dominated the first quarter, forc
ing two Duck turnovers en route
to taking a 21-3 lead.The Cardinal
was quick to capitalize on its op
portunities, scoring 14 points off a
fumble recovery by Delano How
ell and an interception by redshirt
sophomore linebacker Chase
Thomas.
