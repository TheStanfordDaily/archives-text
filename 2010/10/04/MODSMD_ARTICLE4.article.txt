## Chief executive says goals 'absolutely' met after year's 14.4 percent gain 
### AN LE NGUYEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford Management Compa
ny (SMC) announced that its
merged pool, the University's prin
cipal investment pool, secured a
14.4 percent investment gain in the
year that ended June 30,2010. The
merged pool, which includes most
of the endowment, was valued at
$15.9 billion.
The endowment itself had a re
ported $13.8 billion value as of
Aug. 31, 2010, representing a 9.6
percent increase over the previous
fiscal year.
These figures show a solid re
bound from the 25.9 percent loss
the merged pool suffered last year,
the largest single-year plummet in
the University's history. The en
dowment dropped sharply from
$17.2 billion to $12.6 billion during
this period.
According to John Powers, chief
executive of SMC, the recent gains

are well aligned with the manage
ment company's goals. SMC aims
to enable Stanford to meet its pay
outs, to build up the endowment to
increase the University's resources
and to operate at an appropriate
level of risk.
"At 14.4 percent, we're both
meeting all of our obligations to
the University and significantly
growing the value of the endow
ment ... so we met our goals, ab
solutely," Powers said.
The Road to Recovery
Stanford's investment gains this
past year had much to do with im
proved market conditions, as well
as deliberate actions by SMC.
"It was a strong year for both
equity and credit in general, but
what made it a good year for Stan
ford was a decision to overweight
value credit significantly," Powers
said.
