## Chief executive says goals 'absolutely' met after year's 14.4 percent gain 
### AN LE NGUYEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford Management Compa
ny (SMC) announced that its
merged pool, the University's prin
cipal investment pool, secured a
14.4 percent investment gain in the
year that ended June 30,2010. The
merged pool, which includes most
of the endowment, was valued at
$15.9 billion.
The endowment itself had a re
ported $13.8 billion value as of
Aug. 31, 2010, representing a 9.6
percent increase over the previous
fiscal year.
These figures show a solid re
bound from the 25.9 percent loss
the merged pool suffered last year,
the largest single-year plummet in
the University's history. The en
dowment dropped sharply from
$17.2 billion to $12.6 billion during
this period.
According to John Powers, chief
executive of SMC, the recent gains

are well aligned with the manage
ment company's goals. SMC aims
to enable Stanford to meet its pay
outs, to build up the endowment to
increase the University's resources
and to operate at an appropriate
level of risk.
"At 14.4 percent, we're both
meeting all of our obligations to
the University and significantly
growing the value of the endow
ment ... so we met our goals, ab
solutely," Powers said.
The Road to Recovery
Stanford's investment gains this
past year had much to do with im
proved market conditions, as well
as deliberate actions by SMC.
"It was a strong year for both
equity and credit in general, but
what made it a good year for Stan
ford was a decision to overweight
value credit significantly," Powers
said.

He said many market players
including individuals, corporations,
investment management firms and
sovereign wealth funds attempt
ed to lower their levels of indebted
ness in late 2008 and early 2009.
"That meant that people were
selling off credit exposure because
they had to, not because that made
good economic sense," Powers said.
"During that period of time, we were

buying some of that exposure, and
that exposure has performed really
well over the last year and a half."
He added that Stanford chose to
underweight real estate at a time
when these assets experienced a rel
atively tough year, a decision that ul
timately helped bolster the Univer
sity's financial position.
All in all, the robust investment
returns have relieved some of the
pressure on the University pocket
book. From a risk management point
of view, gains in the merged pool
have helped improve Stanford's liq
uidity position, Powers said.
Moreover, with the budgeted

payout for fiscal year 2011 set at 5.5
percent of the endowment's begin
ning-of-year value, growth in the
value of the endowment enables a
higher level of payout. The endow
ment payout for 2010-2011 is slated
to be approximately $758 million.
Stanford's investment gains are
also strong relative to returns at peer
institutions. Stanford outperformed
Harvard, Yale and the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology in the 12
months that ended June 30,2010.
Harvard reported an 11 percent
investment return, placing its en
dowment at $27.4 billion. Yale's en
dowment grew to $16.7 billion and

took in an 8.9 percent investment
gain. MIT announced a 10.2 percent
investment return and an endow
ment of $8.3 billion.
Columbia outpaced the pack; the
New York-based university saw its
investments increase by 17.3 percent
and boosted a $6.5 billion endow
ment, according to the Columbia
Spectator.
Despite Stanford's strong show
ing, its endowment remains $3.4 bil
lion shy of its $17.2 billion value two
years ago.

Looking Forward
While the recent investment re

turns are impressive, it is uncertain
whether they can be sustained in the
long term.
"We're optimistic about a long
term ability to grow value," Powers
said. "But 14 percent is a great year
and we should appreciate it as such."
"It's important to keep in mind
that what we're trying to do is to
compound over five-, 10-, 20-year pe
riods," he added.
In that vein, the merged pool has
increased from $5.8 billion to $15.8
billion in the past decade, earning an
annualized return of 6.9 percent.
In the current fiscal year, the
Stanford Management Company

hopes to complete a top-to-bottom
overhaul of its approach toward
asset allocation and risk manage
ment.
According to Powers, the SMC
has made incremental improve
ments in its liquidity position and
will continue to shift towards a mix
of assets that have lower correlation
to global equity markets.
These strategies, coupled with the
guidance of a strong investment
team, will largely define SMC's agen
da in 2010-2011.
