## Produce Stand now accepts Cardinal Dollars 
### LISA WALLACE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford Produce Stand now accepts
Cardinal Dollars. The student-run venue is in
front of Tresidder on Fridays from 11:00 a.m. to
3:00 p.m.
A new partnership with Union Square, the
eatery inside Tresidder, allows the produce
stand to run transactions through Union
Square's sales system.
Residential and Dining Enterprises, which
oversees the Sustainable Food Program of
Stanford Flospitality and Auxiliaries, sponsors
the produce stand.
"The Produce Stand is an important part of
the educational awareness platform of the Sus
tainable Food Program," said Matt Rothe, di
rector of the Sustainable Food Program. "By
accepting Cardinal Dollars, our hope is that
we'll be able to connect with a greater number
of students and to showcase the great work
that's happening right here on campus."
Emily Bookstein 'll has worked at the pro
duce stand for the past two school years. She
recognizes the benefit to students of increased
payment options, but because the change is still
new, she has yet to notice a change in cus
tomers.
"Maybe the information isn't out there as
well as it could be because not that many peo
ple do it," she said. "It is hard to tell what is in
fluencing people to come to the stand. At the
moment, it is mostly faculty and staff."
While the student clientele may be small,
for those who do support the stand, increased
payment options are attractive.

"I had Cardinal Dollars last year, and I had
no idea the produce stand takes Cardinal Dol
lars," said Tess Rothstein 'll, a frequent cus
tomer. "If I had them this year, I would total
ly use them to buy produce from the stand."
Using Cardinal dollars "provides a great
value to students who are looking to support
the local and organic food movement by pur
chasing fruits and vegetables at the stand,"
Rothe said. "We are hopeful that it draws a
greater number students to the stand so we can
demonstrate all of the work that we and our
student partners are doing to raise awareness

around sustainable food and agriculture."
Stanford students on campus grow many
of the fruits and vegetables sold at the stand.
The produce stand sources from two growers:
Stanford Community Farm and Gardens, the
on-campus agricultural project, and ALBA
Organics in Monterey County. Small-scale sup
ply means that the stand's offerings vary from
week to week. On Friday, the spread included
heirloom tomatoes, eggplants, basil, bell pep
pers, kale, arugula and bok choy.
