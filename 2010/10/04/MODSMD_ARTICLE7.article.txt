## Refunds to stay online â€“ for now Senators withdraw proposed special fees change 
### MARGARET RAWSON STAFF WRITER 
A bill that would require students to re
quest special fees in person at the Stanford
Student Enterprises (SSE) office rather
than online, introduced in the ASSU Un
dergraduate Senate on Tuesday, was re
tracted over the weekend in a series of ef
forts to reform special fees funding for stu
dent groups.
The withdrawn bill, which had not been
vetted by SEE or the Graduate Student
Council (GSC), was part of an effort to
combat the recent trend of increased re
quests for refunds.
"Refunds were skyrocketing," said Sen
ate Chair Michael Cruz 'l2, reflecting on
changes last year to the special fees
process.
While statistics for this quarter's refunds
are not yet available, the numbers for re
funds per quarter for the past four quarters
have been the following: spring 2010,959 re
quests, totaling $99,776 with 322 full re
funds; winter 2010, 1,132 requests, totaling
$115,794 with 379 full refunds; fall 2009,788
requests, totaling $79,604 with 248
full refunds; spring 2009, 886 re
quests, totaling $82,355 with 284 full
refunds.
Students request special fees re
funds online, filling out a form that
gives them the option to request a
refund from all or some student
groups receiving special fees. (The
Daily is one of those groups.)
Groups may deny their services to
students who refund money from
them.
Friday marked the end of the
week-long period during which stu
dents could request refunds for fall
quarter. The 11th Undergraduate
Senate shortened this period last year.
In part due to this change, special
fees refunds declined slightly be
tween winter and spring 2010,
though the refund rate remained the
second-highest in three years, be
hind winter 2010, suggesting the
baseline for special fees refunds in
creased significantly over the pre
ceding years.
Last year, the special fees rate per
quarter per student was $ll9. This
year, the student activities fee is
$lll. During the 2009-2010 academ
ic year, students were overcharged
by $l4, and subsequently refunded,
due to an accounting mistake that
provided groups who had not passed
the funding process with funds.
ASSU has taken a three-pronged
approach to the issue of special fees,
Cruz said.
Last year, the focus rested on con
trolling the special fees rate. This year,

the ASSU has decided to continue
this reform by improving awareness
among students about the refund
process and attempting to decrease
the number of refund requests.
Requiring students to request re
funds in person would help change
what Appropriations Committee
Chair Rafael Vasquez 'l2 described
as a "free-rider system," under
which students could request re

funds for non-financial or moral rea
sons but still benefit from student
group services.
Cruz, one of the bill's authors,
said the bill was withdrawn because
"various members of the association
... decided the best way to affect
the refund problem is through the
technological side rather than
through legislation."
Vasquez, expressing his disap

pointment, suggested the withdraw
al might have been a result of discus
sions with SSE.
Senator Rebecca Sachs 'l3, one
of the most critical voices of the bill
at Tuesday's Senate meeting, was re
lieved to hear of the bill's withdraw
al, which had not been publicized on
Senate e-mail lists as of Sunday
evening.
"I can't imagine 800 people lining
up in SSE to get their money back,"
said Sachs, commenting on her expe
rience as a financial officer for a stu
dent group.
"We want to make the [refund]
process difficult on some level, but
this infringed on their privacy by
making students go into SSE," Sachs
said.
