## Refunds to stay online â€“ for now Senators withdraw proposed special fees change 
### MARGARET RAWSON STAFF WRITER 
A bill that would require students to re
quest special fees in person at the Stanford
Student Enterprises (SSE) office rather
than online, introduced in the ASSU Un
dergraduate Senate on Tuesday, was re
tracted over the weekend in a series of ef
forts to reform special fees funding for stu
dent groups.
The withdrawn bill, which had not been
vetted by SEE or the Graduate Student
Council (GSC), was part of an effort to
combat the recent trend of increased re
quests for refunds.
"Refunds were skyrocketing," said Sen
ate Chair Michael Cruz 'l2, reflecting on
changes last year to the special fees
process.
While statistics for this quarter's refunds
are not yet available, the numbers for re
funds per quarter for the past four quarters
have been the following: spring 2010,959 re
quests, totaling $99,776 with 322 full re
funds; winter 2010, 1,132 requests, totaling
$115,794 with 379 full refunds; fall 2009,788
