## EDITORIAL Understanding and improving the refund rate 
### 
As you flip through the pages of this
edition of The Daily, you should
come across an article discussing an
item known as the "refund rate." We ask you
to not immediately move on. If you have the
time, read the piece, because you will gain a
greater understanding of one of the least
understood, and most-important, aspects of
Stanford student life.
Buried under bylaws and sub-paragraphs
in the governing documents of the ASSU lies
the refund rate. Every year, students vote in
the spring ASSU election on whether or not
to provide special-fees funds to voluntary stu
dent organizations (VSOs). A self-imposed
tax on campus voters, special fees are charged
to each and every one of our tuition bills
under the heading "activities fees." They pay
for the workings and survival of 50 of the
largest student groups on campus. (The Daily
is one of them.) But this is not nearly the end
of the story.
Not only are you able to vote on whether
or not a student group should receive stu
dent funding, but you have the option at the
beginning of each quarter, for a concise peri
od of time, to go online to
refund.stanford.edu and refund your por
tion of those student groups' budgets. In ef
fect, if you are to vote to fund a group, you
can negate, or refund, your vote later. But if
you do so, those student groups are then en
titled to deny you the services they other
wise provide to the campus writ large.
If you do not fully understand the above
paragraphs, do not worry too much. You are
in good company. A great many student
group leaders and elected officials, the indi
viduals charged with engaging in this
process, haven't the foggiest as to how the

system works. Even the editorial board, with
a whole host of experiences across campus,
could not explicate fully all the intricacies of
special fees and the refund rate. This is a
major problem.
What we currently have at Stanford is a
convoluted and problematic system that is
understood by a select few individuals,
which only compounds the fundamental in
stitutional issues.
The editorial board believes it is incum
bent upon student leaders in major VSOs, as
well as the halls of elected office, to better
explain what exactly the special fees and re
fund process is and how it affects undergrad
uate life on this campus. While we acknowl
edge the financial town hall the Undergrad
uate Senate recently held, the Appropria
tions Committee still exists largely inde
pendent of the average Stanford student. Al
most all of the information about elections,
budgets and refund rates exists as public in
formation online, and as a campus commu
nity we must individually educate ourselves
about the process, but we need elected and
supported leaders to help synthesize these
matters.

Furthermore, the editorial board urges
the ASSU and Stanford Student Enterpris
es to take a deeper look at the special fees
process itself. While the board was not unan
imous on the specific issue, it had a deep dis
cussion about exploring the possibility of
doing away with the refund process.
Nowhere in the real world will you find a
place where you can negate your vote later.
By doing away with the refund rate, your
vote in the spring election would carry with
