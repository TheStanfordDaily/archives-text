# THE 						TRANSITIVE PROPERTY
## Notes From a Fourth-Year Freshman 
### Cristophei Bautista 
As a freshman resident assistant (RA),
I have the honor of taking part in peo
ple's emotional development
watching them learn and grow, experiencing
the first triumphs and disappointments,
cheering with them, mourning with them. Al
though it's only the third week of the quarter,
I'm ready to admit that being an RA has per
haps been the most rewarding experience for
me at Stanford so far.
But I do have a confession to make. I al
most turned down the job.
Don't get me wrong. I did want to become
a frosh RA. I had wanted this job since I was
a freshman, more than anything. I know how
competitive the RA job application process
is, and I am thankful that someone thought
I'd do a good job. However, in the face of
transitioning, I wasn't sure if becoming an
RA would be a good choice.
For a while, I debated whether or not I
should turn down the RA gig if I decided to
pursue hormone replacement therapy and
my legal-name change. This would be my first
full year at Stanford as Cristopher I had

not come out as trans until winter quarter
sophomore year, and spent most of my junior
year overseas so in away, I am as much a
freshman as those I'd be looking after.
I figured it would be stressful enough to
go through transitioning by myself. It would
be even more stressful to do it by myself in
front of all these people. I wasn't sure if I
was ready to commit, because if I failed
and I would be failing in front of 85 fresh
men I honestly wouldn't know what to
do. And having a failure for an RA probably
would not be the best message in their first

year of college, would it?
But after some deliberation, I de
cided that I was going to take the job.
I knew that it probably was going to
be difficult, but being an RA had
been important to me for years, and
I wasn't going to let some stupid man
issues get in the way.
That still didn't keep me from feel
ing terrified of failure, though. When
move-in day came, I was introduced
to 85 residents. Although they had
their own personalities, their likes,
their dislikes, their aspirations, they
all were like me. No, not with the
whole hormone or legal-name
change stuff (at least, not so far). But
they all, like me, had their own deep
seated, almost paralyzing fears
fears of failure, of letting loved ones
down, of not getting the most of the
Stanford experience.
Yet regardless of those fears, my
residents decided to come to Stan
ford anyway, to take everything
head-on. It was surprising when I re
alized that I could learn something
from my residents so early on in the
term.
I learned it's ok to be scared. It's a
matter of whether or not you run
away.
I'm still finding myself, still figur
ing out which words apply to me, still
figuring out how I will handle the
rest of my transition and how far I
plan to go. But despite the uncertain
ty, I take comfort in the fact that my
residents and I are on the same jour
ney. I am glad that out of all the peo
ple I would get stuck with for the

year, I could not have thought of
anyone better.
I know my freshmen will grow
into good people, and it does not
matter how they identify, what
nouns or adjectives they use to de
scribe themselves. What matters is
that they care about the world, that
they learn how to love and how to re
spect people. I'm not sure if they're
learning from me as much as I am
learning from them.
So this column is for you, Serra.
Thanks for showing me the epitome
of Serra love by reading my column,
listening to me and talking to me. As
much as I am ashamed to say it, the
Class of 2014 may actually become
the next great class (following closely
behind 'B9 and 'll, of course). Thanks
for making an old senior feel welcome
again.
