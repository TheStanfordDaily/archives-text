# THE
						TRANSITIVE PROPERTY
## Notes From a Fourth-Year Freshman 
### Cristophei Bautista 
As a freshman resident assistant (RA),
I have the honor of taking part in peo
ple's emotional development
watching them learn and grow, experiencing
the first triumphs and disappointments,
cheering with them, mourning with them. Al
though it's only the third week of the quarter,
I'm ready to admit that being an RA has per
haps been the most rewarding experience for
me at Stanford so far.
But I do have a confession to make. I al
most turned down the job.
Don't get me wrong. I did want to become
a frosh RA. I had wanted this job since I was
a freshman, more than anything. I know how
competitive the RA job application process
is, and I am thankful that someone thought
I'd do a good job. However, in the face of
transitioning, I wasn't sure if becoming an
RA would be a good choice.
For a while, I debated whether or not I
should turn down the RA gig if I decided to
pursue hormone replacement therapy and
my legal-name change. This would be my first
full year at Stanford as Cristopher I had

not come out as trans until winter quarter
sophomore year, and spent most of my junior
year overseas so in away, I am as much a
freshman as those I'd be looking after.
I figured it would be stressful enough to
go through transitioning by myself. It would
be even more stressful to do it by myself in
front of all these people. I wasn't sure if I
was ready to commit, because if I failed
and I would be failing in front of 85 fresh
men I honestly wouldn't know what to
do. And having a failure for an RA probably
would not be the best message in their first
