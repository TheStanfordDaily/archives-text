## EDITORIAL Students face enormous stakes in November 
### 
The 2008 election saw historic levels of
youth voter turnout around the coun
try. The 54.5 percent of 18- to 29-year
olds who voted represented the second
highest percentage in American history and
played an instrumental role in propelling
Barack Obama to the presidency. But two
years later, political prognosticators tell a
different story. Voter apathy is up and vote
totals among youth will be down, say the ex
perts. Historic trends and current polling
show a relative lack of excitement for
midterm elections that will keep our demo
graphic away.
The editorial board urges Stanford stu
dents to prove this prediction wrong. Make
your voice heard. Register to vote. Fill out an
absentee ballot or find the right polling
place on Nov. 2.
To really fulfill your civic duty, you must go
far beyond this minimum standard. Educate
yourself on the candidates and the issues. Do
your best to get past the political banter and
engage in the complexities of the questions.
Read newspapers. Ask your professors what
they think. Take the time to apply your own
reasoning to the facts and opinions.
The decisions your elected officials make
in the coming years will shape this nation
and the world for decades. How will tax pol
icy and spending evolve to prevent the na
tional debt from exploding? How will we at
tempt to shape a vibrant economy that
quells the crisis of unemployment? What
comes next in Iraq, Afghanistan and around
the world? Can we ever find enough agree
ment to make necessary changes and invest
ments in our energy infrastructure?
Through the ballot, we have a voice in these
issues if we choose to use it.
And for the nearly 90 percent of Stanford
students who voted for President Obama,

now is no time to be silent. Despite a litany
of setbacks, Obama has, contrary to popular
perception, succeeded in his first two years.
Swift and sure action saved the nation's fi
nancial system from total disaster. The stim
ulus created and saved millions of jobs while
beginning to lay the infrastructural and
technological foundations for a successful
21st-century economy. The war in Iraq is
drawing to a close.
Indeed, much remains to be accom
plished. But Republicans are offering a
starkly contrasting vision of what exactly
needs to be done. You must decide yourself
whether or not Vice President Biden is right
when he says that if Republicans gain con
trol of Congress, the progress will "come to
a screeching halt." Republicans have prom
ised to peel back the landmark health-care
law that will extend coverage to 32 million
Americans, stand against efforts to promote
clean energy, and start taking drastic meas
ures to curb the size of the federal govern
ment.
Debates about these policy issues are not
the only thing characterizing this campaign
season. A wave of anti-intellectual extrem
ism, which diverts from mainstream politics,
also has marked the year. A host of "Tea
Party" Senate candidates deny that anthro
pogenic global warming is happening. Can
didates have lied about their college de
grees, objected to the passage of the Civil
Rights Act and called for the closure of the
Departments of Energy and Education. If
elected, who knows if they will indeed act
upon these claims?
There is no presidential race on the bal
lot, but the stakes this November are enor
mous. Whether or not you agree with the po
litical views expressed here, get your ballot
counted on Nov. 2.
