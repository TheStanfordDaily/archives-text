# GIRL YOU KNOW IT'S TRUE
## Smoke and Mirrors 
### Jordan Carr 
It used to be that when the issue of mari
juana legalization came up, supporters
had to pretend that what really mattered
to them was medicinal marijuana that,
even though nobody ever really cared much
about the old people with glaucoma, under
going chemotherapy or facing whatever
other unspeakable pain marijuana could
ease. Honestly, who doesn't support letting
some sick person smoking a whole bunch of
weed if they want? They're old and sick. Let
them have it.
Indeed, a majority of California voters
succumbed to the powerful old-and-sick
lobby and in November 1996 and passed
Proposition 215, which legalized medicinal
marijuana and more or less left us where we
are today.
Few people actually understand or care
about the medicinal benefits of giving weed
to people. In general, it is good for easing
pain and stimulating appetite. The fact of the
matter is that some people like smoking a
whole bunch of weed in their basement and
playing Mario Kart while eating some Fun
yuns, and some people find that detestable
and dangerous. Shocking to hear, I know, but
it's true.
And it's that Mario Kart, Funyun-loving
taste for freedom that brings us to California
Proposition 19, also known as the Regulate,
Control and Tax Cannabis Act of 2010. On
Nov. 2, 2010, California voters will decide
whether or not they want to make it legal to
possess up to an ounce of marijuana for per
sonal consumption.
Because of the one-ounce limitation, pas
sage of Prop 19 would not mean that the next
time you go to Safeway there would be a
wide variety of blunts to choose from, nor
would it mean you could light up a joint
wherever you please.
So the net result will basically be, um, not
a whole lot. Marijuana was decriminalized in
the legislature a few days ago. Prop. 25, which
would make it so that only a simple majority
is required to pass a budget, is inarguably
more important, but Lord knows you would
not still be reading if this were about the pro
cedural workings of the California legisla
ture. The question of how California will vote
on a referendum on the morality of smoking
weed? More interesting.
So let's join the conversation about weed.
On one side, we have our media establish
ment, which has all but universally opposed
Prop. 19 and generally been willing to throw
in a few demeaning jokes about marijuana
users to boot. Here's the Pasadena Star-
News' apocalyptic vision of a post-Prop. 19
world: "The guy in the cubicle next to you at
work is stoned. There's an increased likeli
hood the driver of the car in the next lane on
the freeway is under the influence of pot.
Commercial entities openly selling pot in
storefronts near where you shop, or perhaps

in your child or grandchild's college dormito
ry." Dun dun dun! Chaos will reign! The
streets will run red with blood! Someone
might actually find being in a cubicle to be
tolerable!
Obviously, none of this should be allowed
to (puff, puff) pass. I mean, they're lazy, have
a short attention span, eat too much and are
entranced by television for hours on end.
Isn't that crazy? Nobody else in America is
like that at all.
But for all the evasions and doomsday
scenarios on the other side, it's not as if the
pro-legalization forces are trying to win this
debate straight up either. I mean, The Regu
late, Control and Tax Cannabis Act? Really?
A more direct name like The Smoke, Bake
and Smoke Cannabis Act would get us a bet
ter sense of how much support there really is
for legalization.
Instead of pretending to make dying and
sick people happy, this time they pretend rea
son is that Prop. 19 might raise a little money
to pay the forthcoming debts from projects
such as our increasingly popular prisons and
the California Super Train. Remember voting
on that two years ago? No? It's like a big
fancy train, and it's not going to be free.
Prop. 19 represents a chance to take some
of the disposable income of those allegedly
irresponsible marijuana users to try to pay
our debts, so that even if we cannot make
ends meet, we'll go down in a blaze of glory,
so to speak.
