### Jade Wang 
I have a confession: I'm addicted to board
games. I'm not talking about Candyland
or Monopoly, though I do relish a raucous
game of Pictionary. I get my fix from games
that are a little more complex and a little
more embarrassing a category sometimes
referred to as "Eurogames" or "German
style board games." These involve less strate
gy than chess but more strategy than Sorry!
and are often based on strangely specific his
torical periods.
Settlers of Catan is probably the most
well-known German-style board game, but
in my tentative exploration of the board
game scene on campus and off, it is definitely
not alone. I spent a little time denying this
foray into a new level of nerd, but after I
started frequenting a virtual version of one
game online, facing off against terrifying,
possibly German strangers, the matter be
came undeniable.
Following this stage of denial, I entered a
brief stage of shame, during which any men
tion of games would make me sheepish and
prone to blushing. My penning of this column
marks my exit from the shame stage. I am an
nouncing my fixation on the most public
forum I have.
In retrospect, it is unsurprising that I de
veloped this acute interest in strategy board
games. It indulges my fondness for solving
puzzles while giving me an outlet for a com
petitive attitude that I usually hide, while also
allowing me to feel self-congratulatory about
being somewhat social instead of squander
ing all my free time on the Internet.
These games often use numerous, highly
stylized wooden pieces that I like to admire
on an aesthetic level and, of course, arrange
into neat stacks before beginning game play.
Predictably, my favorite subcategory of
games is cooperative, the sort of game where
all players work together toward a common

goal (Think "Jumanji," though the thought
that many readers may be too young to re
member the film disturbs me more than I
would like to admit).
I like games that are relatively simple and
fast, since I tend to get bogged down with in
decision and strife otherwise. I like games
with cute graphics and boards that are well
organized. I now realize that I am so far gone
that I am able to detail my specific game pref
erences and relate them to my personality.
My quest for adulthood has hit an unex
pected obstacle. I spend more time now than
I did as a child giggling over board games,
and if my all-too-frequent online researching
of games doesn't severely undermine my
credibility as an adult, I would be very sur
prised.
As it turns out, though, I am too willing to
sacrifice my credibility based on maturity for
an afternoon of rolling dice or drawing cards.
Before I graduated for the first time and en
tered this stage of adulthood-light, I had a
penchant for obsessive behavior. This per
sonality flaw was made apparent through
high school with my teenage fanaticism and
through college with my numerous ill-ad
vised decisions to stay up all night pursuing
some minutia instead of doing the reason
able thing and finding sleep. Perhaps it is ask
ing too much for this characteristic to leave
me when I am attempting to put on a show
that I am a real adult. The obsession needs an
outlet, and when I declared celebrities,
books, and films too juvenile, my resulting
affinity for board games, of all hobbies, is a
study in irony.
Upon further contemplation, though, I
am more or less at peace with my newest
hobby. I am in no hurry to become a bona
fide adult. I've always been something of an
old woman trapped in a young body, so per
haps this is tipping the balance back a little.

My coterm year has given me the gift of one
more year before I enter the abyss, and I cer
tainly plan on enjoying it.
And really, is there a clear definition of
adulthood? Maturity of hobbies as con
structed by society seems an unimportant
factor to take into the bigger picture.
I'll concede the possibility that the true
conclusion I should take from all this is that I
am thinking too much.
Perhaps it's time for a little distraction,
time to go inside and set up a board game.
