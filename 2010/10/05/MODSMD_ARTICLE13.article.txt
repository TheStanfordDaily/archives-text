On "Op-Ed: Our School, Not Your Army
Base," Oct. 4:
"Irrespective of this Op-Ed's content, it is
probably the most functional writing I have
ever (5 years) read in the Daily." Anony
mous, Oct. 4
On "Op-Ed: Why the Military Matters," Oct. 4:
"We need a discussion on ROTC that
sounds a whole lot more like this letter, and a
whole lot less like Mr. Colligan's." Bril
liant Piece, Oct. 4
On "Powers discusses endowment gains after
last year's drop," Oct. 4:
"The long-term preservation of capital for
our university is, at least to me, more impor
tant than obtaining equity-like returns. Just
because we've weathered a recent financial
crisis doesn't mean the horizon is free of
storms." 'l3, Oct. 4
On "University, Palo Alto concerned about
long-range high-speed rail," Oct. 1:
"If Stanford is interested in becoming a
truly global university, then it needs to sup
port the high speed rail. Without it, Stanford
will forever be in the middle of nowhere sub
urbia with no access to a major city except for
Caltrain, which is a joke." Observer, Oct. 3
On "Sent From My iPhone: Sometimes,
SHPRC, You're Only Making It Harder,"
Sept. 29
"I realize rape is a serious, serious topic
and rape jokes in any form aren't actually
funny. But I'm glad to see one more guy (one
more person, even) stand up and say some
thing against victim blaming and ask other
guys to make sure and ask first." student,
