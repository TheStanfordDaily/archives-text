## Step your game up, Card fans! 
### Zach Zimmerman Dishing the Rock 
Prior to the event-that-shall
not-be-named that took
place on Saturday night, I
started to regret my deci
sion not to make the trip up
to Eugene. I decided to stay on campus
for three reasons: 1) I was broke, 2) I
needed to study German, a new lan
guage for me in which I knew the word
for "f******" but not "brother," and 3)
there was going to be a potentially awe
some mass viewing at Angell Field.
So my girlfriend and I, being the
sports optimists that we are, decided to
set out for the viewing party at 3:30 p.m.
with hopes of securing ourselves prime
positions for the single big screen. Keep
in mind that kickoff for the event-that
shall-not-be-named was scheduled for
5:12 p.m.
We ended up being late (standard)
and didn't make it to the field until
about 4:18. What met us was both sur
prising and infuriating.
The field was empty except for 25
red-vested security guards on major
power trips.
We approached the makeshift

"SUID ONLY" sign, only to get the
stiff arm from the queen bee of the
rent-a-guard clan.
"We're not open yet," she barked at
us. Not open yet? Kickoff is in less than
an hour.
"When do you open?"
Before she responded, she gave me
the kind of look that a neighbor gives
you if your dog shits in his yard.
"4:30!"
This woman, in all the glory that
comes with carrying an SUID scanner,
is what is wrong with the sports scene at
Stanford.
Before coming to the Farm, I had vi
sions of campouts three days in ad
vance of big games. Maybe my ideal
world was skewed by hundreds of im
ages that saturated my brain of Duke
kids parked outside Cameron Indoor
Stadium a week before the UNC game.
Believe it or not, those kids are also
smart. They also care about their
schoolwork and their futures. But they
really, really care about Duke basket
ball. If they have a test, they study with
five of their friends in a tent on the con
crete.
Unfortunately, that sports-above

all culture doesn't exist here. Here, it's
perfectly acceptable to show up for a
home basketball game against UCLA
with six minutes left in the game, only
to leave with two minutes remaining
in a four-point game. Here, it takes a
free T-shirt to draw a full student sec
tion at Stanford Stadium. And here,
you can arrive at a school-wide view
ing party for the biggest football game
in a freaking decade, only to be
spurned at the gate by a pissed off se
curity guard.
Unlike some of my fellow colum
nists, I can't put all the blame on the stu
dents. Despite our athletic prowess
YEAH 16 DIRECTORS' CUPS WE
ROCK, YEAH! this is not a sports
school. It's a shame, but no one gives a
damn about the Directors' Cup. We
won't be a sports school until every
component of a successful athletics
program the students, faculty, ath
letic department, party planning com
mittees, red-vested field Nazis, etc.
comes together for the sole purpose of

improving the life of a Stanford fan.
This begins with events like Satur
day. These are not cocktail parties. I'm
not trying to show up 45 minutes be
fore a game, make small talk, munch on
some cheese and then eat dinner. I
want to eat four meals, play some touch
football and drink my weight in cheap
beer. Game day should be a day, not a
three-hour gathering.
Yet we see the same pattern, year
after year. The first football home
game is packed, and if you take out the
USC, Cal and Oregon games, there is a
steady decrease in attendance. And if
we face a team like Washington the
week after an away game, you can hear
crickets in Stanford Stadium.
The Sixth Man follows the Red
Zone's lead and performs an annual
vanishing act just a month into the sea
son. It is entirely possible to show up
for a game at tip-off and grab a spot at
center court. If you tried to pull the
same stunt at Duke, you'd be lucky to
find a seat at a sports bar within a five
mile radius of Cameron Indoor.
One of the biggest contributors to
the decline in sport popularity is the
coma the campus goes into when one
of our big teams hits the road.The Car
dinal faithful need to change the way

they handle the absence of their teams.
When any sports team from Oregon or
USC comes to the Farm, you can feel
the presence of its fans, both those in at
tendance and those hundreds of miles
away.
We really do have amazing athletes
in a giant variety of sports. It's time to
care. Saturday's event was beautiful in
theory, and horrifying in execution.
That type of school-wide gathering
should be held on a regular basis.There
doesn't always need to be food and
drinks provided, just a place to hang
out and watch the game. It may not
make us Oregon or Duke, but we won't
be the University of Chicago either.
And most importantly, we don't
need people running the event that feel
inconvenienced by eager students. All
we need is one Ben Laufer and a
dream, not a redcoat army.
So fans, there is no such thing as a
bye week. We need you to throw more
viewing parties, party throwers. It's
time to change the Cardinal experi
ence.

Zach probably assumes you don't
care about this column either. Show
