Prior to the event-that-shall
not-be-named that took
place on Saturday night, I
started to regret my deci
sion not to make the trip up
to Eugene. I decided to stay on campus
for three reasons: 1) I was broke, 2) I
needed to study German, a new lan
guage for me in which I knew the word
for "f******" but not "brother," and 3)
there was going to be a potentially awe
some mass viewing at Angell Field.
So my girlfriend and I, being the
sports optimists that we are, decided to
set out for the viewing party at 3:30 p.m.
with hopes of securing ourselves prime
positions for the single big screen. Keep
in mind that kickoff for the event-that
shall-not-be-named was scheduled for
5:12 p.m.
We ended up being late (standard)
and didn't make it to the field until
about 4:18. What met us was both sur
prising and infuriating.
The field was empty except for 25
red-vested security guards on major
power trips.
We approached the makeshift

"SUID ONLY" sign, only to get the
stiff arm from the queen bee of the
rent-a-guard clan.
"We're not open yet," she barked at
us. Not open yet? Kickoff is in less than
an hour.
"When do you open?"
Before she responded, she gave me
the kind of look that a neighbor gives
you if your dog shits in his yard.
"4:30!"
This woman, in all the glory that
comes with carrying an SUID scanner,
is what is wrong with the sports scene at
Stanford.
Before coming to the Farm, I had vi
sions of campouts three days in ad
vance of big games. Maybe my ideal
world was skewed by hundreds of im
ages that saturated my brain of Duke
kids parked outside Cameron Indoor
Stadium a week before the UNC game.
Believe it or not, those kids are also
smart. They also care about their
schoolwork and their futures. But they
really, really care about Duke basket
ball. If they have a test, they study with
five of their friends in a tent on the con
crete.
