## Stanford water polo settles for sixth in SoCal 
### â€” Daniel Bohm 
The No. 4 Stanford men's water
polo team split its four games at the
SoCal Tournament, which included a
13-9 loss in the fifth-place contest
against rival Cal, this past weekend
and left the tournament at UCLA as
the sixth-place finisher.
The Cardinal (6-4) opened the
weekend with a 22-12 rout of No. 13
UC-San Diego on Saturday. Four Car
dinal players tallied three goals each
and redshirt junior goalkeeper Brian
Pingree made nine saves in the victory.
Stanford would not be so fortunate
in its second game of the day, falling to
No. 6 UC-Santa Barbara 12-10. After
taking a one-goal lead into the second
period, the Cardinal allowed six Gau
cho goals in the second frame, and
UC-Santa Barbara never looked
back. Senior utility Jeffrey Schwimer
and junior utility Peter Sefton each
notched three goals in the loss.
Resigned to the consolation
bracket, Stanford bounced back with
a 9-8 win over No. 8 Long Beach State
in its first game Sunday. The contest
was tight throughout, and Stanford
got a huge day from junior driver
Jacob Smith, who hammered home
five goals. Pingree had 11 saves in
net.
The win put the Cardinal in the
fifth-place game against rival Cal.The
third-ranked Golden Bears blitzed
the Cardinal early in the match and
led 8-2 at halftime. The Cardinal was
never able to recover, falling 13-9, de
spite outscoring Cal 5-2 in the final
period. Sefton had four goals in the
loss.
The champion of the tournament
was No. 1 USC, who took down the
tournament's host, UCLA, in the
championship game, 9-8.
Stanford will now get ready to
host the top-ranked Trojans, who visit
the Farm on Saturday.
