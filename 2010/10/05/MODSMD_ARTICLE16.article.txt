## No. 1 women strike late to beat visiting Santa Clara 
### SAM SVOBODA BROOKE DAVIS 
It took two late goals to do it, but the No. 1 Stanford
women's soccer team took down its local rival. No. 13
Santa Clara, 2-0 at Laird Q. Cagan Stadium on Sunday.
The match was highly physical, but the Cardinal (9-0-2)
broke through against the Broncos (7-3-2) with a record
tying goal from senior forward Christen Press and a free
kick by junior forward Lindsay Taylor, both of which
came in the last 15 minutes.
Stanford dominated possession in the early stages, as
Santa Clara seemed content to sit back and park the bus
in front of its box. Press had the first attempt of the
match, curling a shot just over the bar from the left side
of the box in the fourth minute. The Cardinal fashioned
another chance in the ninth minute, when Taylor served
a cross in for fellow junior Cami Levin to head the ball
goalward, but the angle was tight and SCU keeper Bian
ca Henninger made the save.
Stanford's next good chance would come 15 minutes
later when Press got in front of her marker on a cross into
the penalty area, but the senior could only redirect the
ball right at Henninger. The Cardinal continued to apply
the pressure for the rest of the half, but largely settled for
long-range shots. In the end, although Stanford outshot
Santa Clara 12-0 in the first half (with six of those 12
coming from Press), the score remained knotted at zero.
Stanford head coach Paul Ratcliffe, while not sur
prised with Santa Clara's conservative approach, gave
credit to its staunch defense in the opening minutes.
"Basically they sat in and made it hard for us to
score," Ratcliffe said.' 'And yeah, you give them credit for
that. And I give their goalkeeper credit. (She) made
some fantastic one-on-one saves, point-blank saves. So
yeah, I give them credit."
The Santa Clara defense was bolstered with tough
physical play to which the Cardinal responded through
out the game. At the end of 90 minutes, the match had
seen a total of 16 fouls.
"I thought we responded fine," Ratcliffe said of the
Broncos physicality. "I mean, they're just trying to throw
us off our game and throw us off our rhythm and it was
n't a huge issue for me. I thought we played hard and it

didn't rattle us at all."
The second half saw more Stanford domination,
starting with Levin winning a free kick just outside of the
box on the right in the 49th minute. Junior midfielder
Teresa Noyola's free kick was headed out, but fellow
midfielder Allison McCann, a senior, served the ball
right back into the box, and Press was just inches away
from getting the vital touch.
Stanford again nearly broke through in the 55th
minute. Substitute Marjani Hing-Glover, a sophomore
forward, got to the endline on the right before crossing
to the middle. Press was waiting in the box, only to see
her close-range effort once again stopped by Henninger.
Sophomore fullback Rachel Quon's header hit the
crossbar a minute later.
The Cardinal continued to push forward, with both
Press and Taylor finding good opportunities, but neither
could find the back of the net.
Yet the all-important goal arrived with just over 12
minutes remaining in the match. Quon sent in a pinpoint
cross from the left, and Press powered a header past
Henninger to set off a dog pile celebration.The strike not
