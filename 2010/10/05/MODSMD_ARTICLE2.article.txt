# STUDENT LIFE
## Students organize for November elections Next month's propositions, candidates prompt student action, voter registration drive 
### MARY ANN TOMAN-MILLER 
Stanford voters will speak on an
array of ballot propositions in the Cali
fornia midterm elections on Nov. 2,
ranging from marijuana legalization to
the suspension of air pollution stan
dards to making it easier for the perpet
ually gridlocked state legislature to pass
a budget all measures that have the
potential to impact Stanford constituen
cies.
The unusual coalitions forming both
in support of and in opposition to these
measures give new meaning to how pol
itics makes strange bedfellows. The
propositions getting the most attention
are Prop. 19, the marijuana initiative,
and Prop. 23, the measure that would
suspend the greenhouse gas law (AB 32)
until unemployment drops to 5.5 per
cent. This week offered a rundown of the
major propositions and how local
groups are lining up.

Prop. 19: Marijuana Legaliza
tion
The fastest miles this
year appear to have been
recorded by politicians
running away from Prop. 19. Elected of
ficials and candidates are shying away
from associating their names with mak
ing pot available for recreational use.
Indeed, one of the few things that
Steve Cooley and Kamala Harris the
respective Republican and Democratic
candidates for attorney general
agree upon is opposition to Prop. 19.
Both have signed a ballot statement
warning that "Proposition 19 seriously
compromises the safety of our commu
nities, roadways, and workplaces."
The Stanford Democrats held a
meeting on Sunday at the Old Union
Clubhouse and discussed fall activities
and this measure.
"This proposition splits voters down
the line," said Mauricio Grande 'l2. "It's
a good way to bring in extra revenue, but
many other laws would have to be re

considered, like what constitutes DUI."
The California Democratic Party is
remaining officially neutral on the
measure. Although the Stanford Con
servative Society, which is comprised of
conservatives, moderates, Republicans
and libertarians, has similarly declined
to take a position, the California GOP
has come out in opposition while the
California Libertarian Party recom
mends a "yes" vote.
Prop. 23: Suspension of Greenhouse
Gas Laws
Passage of Prop. 23 would suspend
implementation of the pollution control
law AB 32 until unemployment drops to
5.5 percent for a year. AB 32 requires
that major emissions contributors sub-

Mit reports of
their emissions and reduce their levels.
Prop. 23 is generating passionate reac
tions on the Stanford campus, as demon
strators came out on Sept. 24 at the
Campus Drive Valero station to partici
pate in a "Stop Texas Oil" protest
against the measure.
"I absolutely cannot stand the propo
sition," said Sarahi Constantine Padilla
'll. "We have a moral obligation to vote
no. Climate change is such a huge issue
that it overpowers everything."
"Students for a Sustainable Stanford
opposes Proposition 23 because the very
idea of allowing outside corporate inter
ests to suspend California's landmark
