## Partridge fights disfigurement stigma 
### ERIN INMAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
What do we see when we look in the
mirror? One in 111 people see a socially
or psychologically "significant" facial dis
figurement, according to nonprofit leader
James Partridge.
In a talk at Stanford titled "Face Dif
ferent, Life Ruined?" on Monday night.
Changing Faces founder and chief execu
tive Partridge talked about his work fight
ing the stigma attached to disfigurement,

which he said includes the visual effects of
a rash, scar or skin graft on a person's skin
or an asymmetry or paralysis to their face
or body.
Changing Faces, a United Kingdom
based nonprofit, counsels those with a
disfigurement, challenges public attitudes
and works to ensure a culture of inclusion
through social change.
At age 18, Partridge was severely
burned in a car accident.
"The first time I really knew I'd done
something to myself was when an old

friend of mine came in and fainted in the
ward," Partridge said. "I started to realize
that people weren't actually looking at
me. They were looking away."
Although Partridge had some recon
structive surgery, he said he was enriched
by his disfigurement. Rather than contin
ue with more reconstructive surgery, he
"liberated" himself from the "absurd
pressures" put on him to conceal his dis
figurement.
"I had felt so much like Humpty
Dumpty," Partridge said. "Surgeons
can get you back on the wall. Al
though the problem for me was I did
n't want to spend my life on the wall.
I met people sitting on the wall
thinking, 'This is hell.' They felt
pushed into the margins of society."
Pop culture does little to dispel
this culture of exclusion, but rather
enforces strong stereotypes and
prejudices regarding disfigurement,
he said: "Culture has used and I
mean used disfigurement as a de
vice."
In the majority of James Bond
movies, for example, the main vil
lains are scarred. Other infamous
disfigured cinema characters include
the Phantom of the Opera, the beast
in "Beauty and the Beast," and Scar
in "The Lion King," Partridge point
ed out.
Popular television shows are not
innocent either. "Nip/Tuck," an
American drama about plastic sur
gery, once featured an advertising
slogan, "Ugliness demeans us all. In
vest in your face."
In an effort to understand cultural
attitudes concerning disfigurement,
Changing Faces conducted an "im
plicit attitude test." It found that 90
percent of those surveyed implicitly
judge people with disfigurements to
be less attractive, less likely to suc
ceed and less likely to lead happy
lives. People with disfigurements
often deeply hold these unconscious
negative attitudes themselves.
While patients need multidiscipli
nary treatment, society needs to
challenge the prejudices often re
sponsible for those patients' vulner
ability to low self-esteem, depression
and reduced self-confidence, Par
tridge argued. At the group level,
governments, public policy and edu
cation need to dispel the myths re
garding disfigurement.
"I was surprised by all the sectors
working for the same goal: the med
ical field, schools, et cetera," said Ab
dulkareem Agunbiade 'lO, organizer
of the talk. "And I figured a lot of
Stanford students would be interest
ed in learning about disfigurement.
It's an important issue."
