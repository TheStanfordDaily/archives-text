## Partridge fights disfigurement stigma 
### ERIN INMAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
What do we see when we look in the
mirror? One in 111 people see a socially
or psychologically "significant" facial dis
figurement, according to nonprofit leader
James Partridge.
In a talk at Stanford titled "Face Dif
ferent, Life Ruined?" on Monday night.
Changing Faces founder and chief execu
tive Partridge talked about his work fight
ing the stigma attached to disfigurement,

which he said includes the visual effects of
a rash, scar or skin graft on a person's skin
or an asymmetry or paralysis to their face
or body.
Changing Faces, a United Kingdom
based nonprofit, counsels those with a
disfigurement, challenges public attitudes
and works to ensure a culture of inclusion
through social change.
At age 18, Partridge was severely
burned in a car accident.
"The first time I really knew I'd done
something to myself was when an old

friend of mine came in and fainted in the
ward," Partridge said. "I started to realize
that people weren't actually looking at
me. They were looking away."
Although Partridge had some recon
structive surgery, he said he was enriched
by his disfigurement. Rather than contin
ue with more reconstructive surgery, he
"liberated" himself from the "absurd
pressures" put on him to conceal his dis
figurement.
