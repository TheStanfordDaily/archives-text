# Innovating 'the new Arab woman'
## In Monday talk, renowned Lebanese poet examines the changing role of Arab women 
### MARGARET RAWSON STAFF WRITER 
Joumana Haddad, renowned Lebanese poet,
journalist and founder and editor in chief of
Jasad Magazine, the first erotic magazine in the
Arab world, spoke Monday afternoon in Wallen
berg Hall about the "new Arab woman" and her
latest book, "I Killed Scheherazade: Confessions
of an Angry Arab Woman".
Joining Haddad on a panel were Esther Woj
cicki, chairwoman of Creative Commons, Diana
El-Azar, director of media, entertainment and
information industries for the World Economic
Forum, and Kirsten Mogenson, associate profes
sor in journalism at Roskilde University. El-Azar
and Mogenson served on the panel via webcam
from Switzerland and Denmark, respectively.
The panel, co-organized by the Stanford Cen
ter for Innovation & Communication (SCIC)
and the Center for Design Research and moder
ated by David Nordfors, founding executive of
SCIC, began with Haddad reading a section of
her book.
The book's title references Scheherazade, the
heroine of "One Thousand and One Nights," a
character normally regarded as the vision of a
strong woman. In the classic tale, Scheherazade
saves her own life and the lives of other women
by telling stories to a king for 1,001 nights.
Haddad argued that the archetype of
Scheherazade must be killed because she repre
sents a woman who negotiates for her basic
rights, a process which must stop as women real
ize they are equal with men and deserve these
rights from the onset.
In her excerpt, Haddad described the "so
called Arab woman," an image of a belly dancing,
submissive woman perpetuated by the media
and innovations such as Mattel's "burka Barbie."

"What is an Arab woman, anyway?" Haddad
asked.
"She is not as uncommon as you might sup
pose," Haddad said of the independent Arab
woman, saying "she represents an intense kind of
hope" for other women, both Christian and Mus
lim, of the Arab world.
Haddad stressed that she does not deny the
existence of the submissive Arab woman.
"It has become like an art," Haddad said of
the problem of denial in the Arab world.
Haddad's work, which includes challenging
religion and discussing sexuality, has received
strong reactions, drawing hate mail and death
threats. Jasad, the title of her groundbreaking
magazine, means "body" in Arabic.
Haddad contended that Islamic feminism is
"an internal contradiction" and challenged the
conception that a woman can be emancipated
while choosing to wear the veil.
Despite censorship, Jasad Magazine has a di
verse readership of both men and women. Out
side of Lebanon, the most interest in the maga
zine comes from Saudi Arabia, where the maga
zine's website is banned.
"The more you ban something, the more you
make it desirable," Haddad said, characterizing
censorship as "a monster that feeds on itself."
Haddad described her book as the outcome of
building passion and anger and discussed the im
portance of economic empowerment, culture
and reading in the liberation of women. She de
scribed the "illusion of freedom" that some
women have in Lebanon despite the fact they re
main economically dependent on men.
Haddad, who speaks seven languages and has
received literary awards from various countries,
typically translates her own works. Though she

first wrote it in English, which she
said was coincidence, Haddad plans
to translate "I Killed Scheherazade"
into Arabic soon.
Though she has chosen to remain
in Lebanon, Haddad said she would
leave if a war breaks out again.
"I have always felt like a world
citizen," she said. "I'm scattered as if
an explosion happened when I was
born."
