## Researchers advance nanoscale solar-cell work 
### MATT BETTONVILLE 
Solar cell technology, long limited by
costs and practical issues, has the potential
to cross a new threshold of efficiency
through an approach recently theorized by
Stanford researchers.
Solar cell researchers Shanhui Fan,
Zongfu Yu and Aaswath Raman took a sig
nificant step toward future solar power
practicality with a Sept. 27 paper titled
"Fundamental Limit of Nanophotonic
Light Trapping in Solar Cells," which lays

the foundation for nanoscale solar cells
research indicating that for solar cells, less is
more.
"We have developed essentially a rigor
ous theory to treat light trapping in
nanophotonic structures in general," said
Fan, an associate professor of electrical en
gineering, pointing out that the team did not
construct new kinds of solar cells but rather
laid the theoretical foundation for future
development.
Most solar panels in use today imple
ment the 20th-century technology of mak

ing thick panels with rough surfaces to keep
light rays inside the panel for as long as pos
sible. However, the nanoscale cells that
Fan's team researched take a fundamental
ly different approach, using solar cells as
thin as 500 nanometers, or one two-thou
sandth of a millimeter.
"Previously, the theory treated light as a
straight ray," said Yu, a postdoctoral re
search fellow. "But light has a lot of wave
factors, and this in fact does not show up
until you go into the nanoscale."
Yu pointed to a previous theoretical limit

for light absorption in larger solar cells and
said that the theoretical limit that his team
determined for nanoscale cells that dealt
with the wave aspect of light turned out sig
nificantly higher. In addition to their in
creased efficiency, the thinner cells also cost
much less because they use fewer resources.
And lower cost is a big deal. According to
Scott Gould, senior engineer for building
energy systems commissioning, solar power
currently offsets well under one percent of
