## Researchers advance nanoscale solar-cell work 
### MATT BETTONVILLE 
Solar cell technology, long limited by
costs and practical issues, has the potential
to cross a new threshold of efficiency
through an approach recently theorized by
Stanford researchers.
Solar cell researchers Shanhui Fan,
Zongfu Yu and Aaswath Raman took a sig
nificant step toward future solar power
practicality with a Sept. 27 paper titled
"Fundamental Limit of Nanophotonic
Light Trapping in Solar Cells," which lays

the foundation for nanoscale solar cells
research indicating that for solar cells, less is
more.
"We have developed essentially a rigor
ous theory to treat light trapping in
nanophotonic structures in general," said
Fan, an associate professor of electrical en
gineering, pointing out that the team did not
construct new kinds of solar cells but rather
laid the theoretical foundation for future
development.
Most solar panels in use today imple
ment the 20th-century technology of mak

ing thick panels with rough surfaces to keep
light rays inside the panel for as long as pos
sible. However, the nanoscale cells that
Fan's team researched take a fundamental
ly different approach, using solar cells as
thin as 500 nanometers, or one two-thou
sandth of a millimeter.
"Previously, the theory treated light as a
straight ray," said Yu, a postdoctoral re
search fellow. "But light has a lot of wave
factors, and this in fact does not show up
until you go into the nanoscale."
Yu pointed to a previous theoretical limit

for light absorption in larger solar cells and
said that the theoretical limit that his team
determined for nanoscale cells that dealt
with the wave aspect of light turned out sig
nificantly higher. In addition to their in
creased efficiency, the thinner cells also cost
much less because they use fewer resources.
And lower cost is a big deal. According to
Scott Gould, senior engineer for building
energy systems commissioning, solar power
currently offsets well under one percent of

Stanford's yearly power consump
tion because of the impractical costs
to install solar cells and the physical
space required to house cells. The re
cent research theorizes cells that are
both less expensive and more effi
cient, making them overall more
practical for widespread use.
However, the team's research will
not make solar cells more practical
overnight.
"What we have pointed out is re
ally what outer limit of light absorp
tion enhancement can be accom
plished in different structures," Fan
said. "It's very important [as a solar
cell producer] to know how far you
are from the absolute optimum as al
lowed by theory."
The team hopes that its paper
serves as a gateway to the optimiza
tion of solar cells as future research
uses its theoretical computer models
to make concrete and functional
cells, but the work is unlikely to in
fluence any commercial units for
years.
Solar power is both a prominent
Stanford hobby and a serious under
taking. The Stanford Solar Car Pro
ject, which produces a solar-powered
car every two years, and the Stanford
Solar and Wind Energy Project
(SWEP) bring together student
solar-power enthusiasts. Veteran
Solar Car mechanical team member
Matt Lambert 'l2 said that although
the solar cells used in the Solar Car

Project generally use decades-old
technology, companies including
General Motors and Volkswagen
sponsor the project with an interest
in researching ways to implement
solar cell technology.
Gould said that SWEP, a group
that advocates for sustainable ener
gy sources, has worked a lot with his
department and that solar cells are
on the rise in Stanford facilities. The
Knight Management Center, under
construction as the new home of the
business school, is planned to con
tain 4,275 solar cell modules, more
than tripling the school's current
number of modules. The huge cost of
installing solar cells, however, re
mains the central obstacle to retro
fitting current facilities with solar
cells, necessitating research projects
like this one.
"The hope is that all this research
tells us what to do to make those
cells absorb light as well as we want
them to," Raman said.
