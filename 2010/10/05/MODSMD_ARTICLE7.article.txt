## I DON'T LIVE HERE Sneaking into dorms and houses remains a stubborn security issue 
### JENNY THAI CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
I recall a mission I once had. The target
was Otero. After a late branch around
1 p.m. one day, I approached the door,
my motions jerky and tense. The door
swung open as one of the residents
emerged, her head barely visible as she car
ried a large basket of laundry.
I took a step toward the closing door.
Without a second glance, she stuck out her
foot a bit, stalling the door just enough for me
to grab the handle and sneak into the build
ing, the home of more than 60 freshmen.
It had taken fewer than five seconds to
penetrate the dorm. No alarms.
Today, on a campus where the relative
ease of sneaking into dorms is known widely
and where one of the country's most high
profile dorm security breaches happened
three years ago Student Housing and the
Department of Public Safety (DPS) continue
to work on tightening campus security.
Police say the campus feels safe to many;
it's not uncommon to see students up and out
at odd hours.
"We see a lot of people out walking or bik
ing in the early morning and at night," said
Lt. Rich Cinfio of DPS. "Unless you feel safe
and secure, you wouldn't be out by yourself."
The department works closely with Stu
dent Housing to ensure a safe campus for its

residents. One security measure
was the implementation of a card
access system in many dorms.
By 2007, "Student Housing's
Stern Hall was selected as the pilot
program for the University, and was
completed successfully," wrote —.
Rodger Whitney, executive director of
Student Housing, in an e-mail to The
Daily. "Since then all of our residences
which house freshmen, as well as the major
ity of our large residences, have been con
verted to card access."
The premise of the system is to keep
strangers from infiltrating student resi
dences. To supplement the card-access sys
tem, dorm alarms also were installed, activat
ing when doors are intentionally or acciden
tally propped open.
Yet there is a limit to the effectiveness of
the card system. Students often use a tactic
called "tailgating," or following another resi
dent into a dorm, which can potentially com
promise the safety of the entire dorm, police
say.
"Think of [opening the door] as the front
door of your house," said Bill Larson, a
spokesperson for DPS. "Except, of course,
it's not just your house but everybody else's
in the dorm, too. You wouldn't let anyone
tailgate through your front door, would
you?"
Student Housing encourages students to
be vigilant. "We empower residents to ap

proach »
strangers in
their residence and
to ask who they are there
to visit," Whitney said, "or to
ask them to leave if they are not
an authorized visitor. It is also important that
students limit their guests to people they
know."
Another step that students can take is to
familiarize themselves with their fellow resi
dents and distinguish them from strangers,
police say.
"What it boils down to: people need to
trust their intuition," Cinfio said. "If someone
looks suspicious, then contact security. An
other good way to [prevent] strangers from
getting in is to get to know everyone in your
dorm, or at least become familiar with their
faces."
This strategy appears to work well for
smaller residences, such as Row houses or
Suites, where the tailgating method may not
work quite as well as in dorms due to less foot
traffic.

Because the campus is perceived to be so
safe, lapses in safety protocol are common
place.
"It will happen," Larson said. "Last year,
two people snuck into a dorm. It was a clever
ploy. They were wearing Stanford sweatshirts
so everyone in the dorm assumed that they
were students."
Major breaches in security, such as the in
famous incident in 2007 when Azia Kim
spent eight months successfully tricking
Okada residents into thinking she was a
Stanford student, are rare.
"The incident a few years ago where an in
dividual posed as a student was an unusual
one," Whitney said. "And while the situation
did provide the University-at-large with a re

minder of the ne
cessity that everyone involved work together
toward security, it did not significantly im
pact our processes."
Authorities urge the Stanford community
to take initiative in maintaining security and
to think twice before letting an unknown per
son through the door with a wordless, per
functory glance.
"Even the best systems are defeated,"
Larson said. "What happened several years
ago was a lapse in protocol, but not necessar
ily a lapse in security. Everyone needs to be
reminded from time to time to follow the
protocol."
