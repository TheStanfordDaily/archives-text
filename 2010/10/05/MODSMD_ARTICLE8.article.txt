# STUDENT LIFE
## Seniors prepare for another round of school after graduation 
### CAITY MONROE DESK EDITOR 
For a certain subset of Stanford seniors, this fall's
workload and stress levels derive only partially from
their course loads. With the pressure of LSATs, GREs,
GMATs, medical school applications and interviews,
some seniors are busy planning for the next stage of their
education while still wrapping up their current one.
"It's kind of a struggle to be preparing for a test like
[the GRE] while doing school stuff," said Alex Robert
son 'll, who took the general GRE on Saturday.
Students hoping to attend medical school next year
are in the middle of the nerve-racking process of await
ing interview offers. "Every time I check my e-mail, I
check it hoping to see something from a medical school,"
said Chris Sonne 'll. "And that's been the case for the
last month and a half."
While the process is no doubt stressful, Stanford does
have resources to ensure that students aren't navigating
the application process alone. Stanford's Undergraduate
Advising and Research (UAR) has four advisors who
work specifically with pre-professional students. In addi
tion to advising appointments, UAR provides those stu
dents a variety of events

and resources.
"There's a whole
array of services
available," said
Randall Williams,
associate dean of
UAR. "[We pro
vide] general ad
vising, info ses
sions, panels and
programs, visits
from law school
teams, academic
and experiential pro
grams."
Sonne is one of the many
students who have taken advan
tage of the UAR's help.
"I've made appointments with
several of the pre-med advisors and
they've always been helpful," he said.
"Luckily, I have to say it is pretty
busy for us," Williams said. "Students are
coming through the door, making ap
pointments and dropping in to see all the
pre-professional advisors, as well as the
general ones."
For the upcoming weeks, UAR has
organized visits from deans of admis
sion from various law schools to meet
with students and answer their ques
tions. UAR also has joined with the

Stanford Pre-Medical Association (SPA) to provide
medical students with opportunities to shadow physi
cians.
"It's important for medical schools to see students get
exposure to the hospital and see what life as a doctor is
like," said Kevin Tran 'l2, co-president of SPA. "That's
why we created the shadowing program a few years ago."
Student groups like SPA, the Stanford Pre-Law Soci
ety and the Stanford Pre-Business Association provide
interested students with peer support and other re
sources to help them through the application process.
"Because there is no pre-law curriculum, we try to fa
cilitate intellectual discussion of the different legal is
sues," said the co-president of Stanford Pre-Law Society,
Jimmy Threat! 'll. "We try to organize events with Stan
ford law professors and lawyers in the area to give Stan
ford students the opportunity to discuss legal issues with
legal scholars."
Ericka Sohlberg "11, an English major applying to
medical schools, has appreciated the programs she's
taken part in so far, especially recent events to help her
prepare for interviews.
"The mock interview was very helpful," she said, "and
as someone who's not a biology major, I still feel like I get
all the information and support that I need."
Students made it clear, though, that while the re
sources are there, they aren't going to be delivered to
your doorstep.

"They don't come hold your hand and help you
fill out your primary," Sohlberg said. "You
have to take the initiative."
Threatt agreed that the help is there,
but only for those who seek it.
"I think the problem is that I don't
know if all students are aware of the re
sources," Threatt said.
Not all students who are in pre-profes
sional fields are moving straight on to their
next degree, though. Kim Conner'll is one
of many pre-med students who are taking
some time off before medical school.
"I felt like I wasn't ready to launch
straight into another eight years of
school," said Connor, who was just nomi
nated for a health extension position in the
Pacific Islands with the Peace Corps. "I felt like

I might end up being bitter about it even if I did get
into a medical school I liked, just because I have
not had the time to investigate any other options
in my life other than school up until now."
