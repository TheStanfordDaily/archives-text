In "Powers talks investment"
(Oct. 4), the graphic misstated Stan
ford's investment gains as 5.5 per
cent for the recent year. As the story
correctly reported, the University's
principal investment pool gained
14.4 percent in the year ending June
30, 2010. The endowment grew 9.6
percent in the year ending Aug. 31,
2010. The budgeted endowment
payout for fiscal year 2011 is set at
5.5 percent of the endowment's be
ginning-of-year value.

In "Refunds to stay online for
now" (Oct. 4), The Daily incorrectly
reported the refund period was a
week long. It was two weeks long.
