## Schwarzenegger signs organ-donor bill at Lucile Packard Children's Hospital 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€” Ivy Nguyen 
California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger signed
a bill to encourage organ donation Tuesday in a ceremo
ny held at Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.The legis
lation, Senate Bill 1395, aims to prompt Californians to
consider the option of registering as an organ donor by
making it mandatory to indicate whether or not they
want to be an organ donor on the Department of Motor
Vehicles driver license application, driver license renew
al or state identification card application form.
Prior to the passage of the bill, California drivers had
the option not to answer the question when filling out

their license or ID applications. The bill, introduced by
state Senator Elaine Alquist (D-Santa Clara), is intend
ed to increase organ donations and encourage Californi
ans to "give the gift of life" by becoming organ donors.
Apple CEO Steve Jobs, a 2009 liver transplant recip
ient who spearheaded the campaign to pass the bill, was
on hand to watch Schwarzenegger sign it.
"This new law will save thousands of lives in California
each year," Jobs said. "It's good for everyone. The donor's
family knows their loved one is making it possible for oth
ers to live. Talented surgeons can save the lives they're
trained to save. Recipients are given the gift of an extend
ed life... as a transplant recipient, I know how precious
this gift of life is."
The bill will also create the nation's first donor reg
istry for kidney transplants, which, according to
Schwarzenegger, will enable those awaiting transplants
to find their matches more easily.
