### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€” Ivy Nguyen 
Researchers at the School of Medicine have received $25
million in gi ants from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) to
develop new cancer diagnostic techniques and therapies and
to advance the understanding of cancer cell biology.
The first of the grants gives $lO million to the In Vivo
Cellular and Molecular Imaging Center at Stanford
(ICMIC), which combines researchers in chemistry, ma
terials science and engineering, molecular imaging, on
cology, cancer biology, protein engineering, biostatistics
and mathematical modeling. The center, led by co-prin
cipal investigators Christopher Contag, associate profes
sor of microbiology and immunology and Sanjiv Gamb
hir, professor of radiology is working to develop molec

ular imaging that will enable new cancer research and
improve cancer-patient management.
Several of these projects, including positron emission
tomography, magnetic resonance and optical imaging,
aim to advance current understanding of cancer cell bi
ology and to optimize new cancer therapies and will be
funded by the award.
The second grant, worth $l5 million, was awarded to
the Center for Cancer Nanotechnology Excellence and
Translation (CCNE-T), which, like ICMIC, draws to
gether researchers from radiology, bioengineering, ma
terials science, oncology and other departments to de
velop nanotechnology to promote earlier cancer detec
tion and improve doctors' ability to monitor patients' re
sponses to anti-cancer therapy.
CCNE-T is headed by Gambhir and Shan Wang, pro
fessor of materials science and engineering. The center is
developing the next generation of smart nanoparticles,
magnetonanotechnology for cell sorting and other can
cer imaging techniques and therapies.
