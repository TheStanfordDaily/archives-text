## EDITORIAL After Rutgers tragedy, it's time to reaffirm respect and tolerance 
### 
In September, a freshman at Rutgers took
his own life after his roommate and an
other student allegedly made a secret
video of him engaging in sexual relations
with another man and streamed it on the In
ternet. From a legal perspective, it is difficult
to prove a causal relationship between the
video and the suicide. However, rational
people can certainly understand the impli
cations of this sort of bullying. The editorial
board is disappointed that this childish and
extremely hurtful behavior still exists at the
university level and would like to see it dis
appear.
The first step to preventing situations like
this these, which are sadly all too frequent in
this country, is to alter the campus dialogue.
Using words like "gay" and "fag" in an in
sulting manner, whether sincerely or ironi
cally, is a detriment to everyone in the
LGBTQ community and the student body
at large. Attempting to rationalize the use of
slurs "But he actually is gay and told us
he was ok with it" does not ameliorate
their usage. Many people began using these
slurs inadvertently in their youth, before
they understood the words' meanings and
implications. "Gay" does not mean stupid. It
never did, and now it is time for us to eradi
cate its usage as such.
Any deployment of epithets is inherently
insulting, whether or not it is intended to be.
And while the editorial board is certainly
not a fan of hyperactive and reactionary po

litical correctness, when individuals are di
rectly harmed because of such callousness,
it's time to change.
Suggesting the removal of specific words
from our collective lexicon does raise ques
tions about limiting free speech. There is no
legal precedent to suggest that people must
interact civilly with one another, which is why
the First Amendment protects the use of
slurs. However, this protection does not justi
fy their use. While we may question the
morality of removing specific words from our
vocabulary, we must also consider the moral
ity of using words that are distinctly harmful
to a certain subset of our peers.The board be
lieves removing such slurs from our campus
conversation is a morally superior decision.
With the improvement of campus dia
logue, the next measure should be for toler
ance and not just in touchy-feely, buzz
word form. Everyone is entitled to his or her
own beliefs. This respect for the viewpoints
of others should be universal, which unfor
tunately it is not. Intolerance persists be
cause there is a tendency to focus on the the
oretical ideas behind opposing philosophies
rather than on the individuals who hold
those beliefs and are affected by others'
views. Empathy for those with opposing
views, whether on the left or right, will breed
tolerance for their contrasting ideologies.
The tragedy at Rutgers is an extreme in
cident. Let us work to ensure there is no po
tential for such an event here.
