## Party Planning: An Exercise in Oxymorons 
### Peter McDonald 
Readers, I'm angry. Two great beauties
of this world, Velvet Hammers and
LovEvolution2olo, were callously
forced into oblivion recently, courtesy of the
department formerly known as the Office of
Student Activities and the Mayor's Office of
San Francisco, respectively. Why? Both in
volved party plans that the Man deemed un
acceptable.
Velvet Hammers are the ceremonial
drink of choice for the Stanford Band, and we
were supposed to enjoy them in anticipation
of the all-too-epic Road Trip to Oregon last
weekend. LovEvolution 2010 is an all-day,
outdoor, electronic music festival (please,
media, stop calling them raves. It's like con
tinuing to call people illegal aliens) that was
supposed to take place last weekend in Civic
Center Plaza up in San Francisco.
Both were unique entities, existing in an
administrative framework that claimed to
support the quirkiness they represented. It
turns out, though, that when you are the des
ignated Havers of Fun, either for Stanford
University or for the state of California, it's
only a matter of time before Those in Charge
get uncomfortable and decide the only fun
you can have is the kind you submit to them
in writing beforehand. It makes sense. After
all, the spontaneity and craziness that make
the Band and San Francisco legendary owe
all of their existence to the paternalism of the
no-longer-called-OSA and the Mayor's Of
fice.
The Band's current malaise can trace its
origins back to the worst word in the English
language: "liability." Before the Band piled
onto the bus last Thursday night for our Road
Trip to Eugene, we were supposed to prepare
for the occasion with our own signature drink
served in a toilet, the aptly named Velvet
Hammer. However, any mentions of the
words "Road Trip" causes everyone in the
administration to do their best Ned Flanders
impression. After the extensive meetings and
visits by Ralph Castro and review of the con
duct policy (yes, that's right, the Band has a
conduct policy now), we thought we had
cleared all the necessary hurdles.
We were doing everything the right way,
actually registering this shindig and all. It
would appear, though, that no amount of
rule-following will ease the administration's
night terrors about someone drinking too
much and suing the University, and because
Stanford has nowhere near the resources to
settle a frivolous lawsuit out of court, it
pulled the plug, most likely indefinitely, on
our lowly toilet-based drink on Thursday af
ternoon, displaying the impeccable timing
that really has come to define this universi
ty's administration.
All I've been able to glean from this inci
dent is a reminder of what I learned in ado
lescence: the less you tell your parents what's
going on, the better. Also, a word of advice to
any of you out there who would even con
template suing the University or letting your
parents sue the University because you vol
untarily drank too much: please exit this
earth.
After having experienced the crushing
letdown of the Man shutting down your

party, my heart goes out all the more to the
planners of LovEvolution 2010. In my tenure
here at Stanford, I have witnessed large elec
tronic music festivals go from the sole prop
erty of the weirdest kid in Naranja to the
trendiest thing a Theta could make a Face
book photo album of, and I think that's beau
tiful. Electronica is what the kids are into
these days, and it's about damn time because
rock has been going absolutely nowhere.
Considering that the definitive music festival
of the previous generation was Woodstock
'99, I'm quite proud that we've all decided to
culturally affirm love in our music, with or
without the aid of MDMA. A bunch of old
people in suits don't see it that way.
Electronic music festivals are perhaps the
last way to freak out anyone's parents any
more. When a few bad things happen, as they
are bound to at any event involving hundreds
of thousands of people, the news media and
politicians treat them as the next great drug
scourge that will cause the downfall of socie
ty. Through this framework the organizers of
LovE volution had to fight, and the addition
of a stampede during a similar event over in
Germany made their work even harder, de
spite all previous LovEvolutions going off
successfully. "Denied" was the verdict from
the oh-so-progressive Gavin Newsom's of
fice. Don't they know you can't keep your
love in chains?
Every time we take a loss in the struggle, I
get sad. Having to defend alcohol and sub
stance use from an institutional standpoint is
a hard exercise but is it ever an important
one. All work and no play make Jack a dull
boy, but no administration will truly affirm
this. So remember, you've got to fight for
your right to party, because the Man can al
ways take your rights away from you.
