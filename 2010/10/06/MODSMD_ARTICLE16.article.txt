# LOOKING UP
## The 						Real Counterculture 
### Nina M. Chung 
Seven days a week, students at Stanford
University are working. We have classes
Monday through Friday, with a three
day weekend only if you hit the schedule
jackpot. We have primary-document course
readers to skim, job hours to clock and meet
ings to get to at night. Unfinished work is
never a distant thought, which means meals
are cut short and phone calls home are brief.
(The self-proclaimed procrastinators are
often the modest but meanest homework
machines.) This is Stanford culture ac
complishment via productivity and that's
great, period.
Unfortunately (fortunately), we're all
limited by biological humanity, i.e. sleep,
food, social quotas. Times when deadlines
don't press in allow for temporary cold
shoulder treatment of the to-do list. You fol
low a TV show, hit the gym, skip classes and
get drunk for study breaks. Otherwise, there
are diminishing marginal returns (I'm taking
Econ 1 A!).
But let's break down that nomenclature.
Study breaks are defined by what they are
not: studying. They simply emphasize the
slots of time that restrict them.
And now for a one-word vocabulary quiz:
define "rest."
Stop reading. Think.
Dear reader, I don't know who you are,
but we 're similar in a lot of ways, which is why
I'm writing this column: my sources of joy are
public domain. (But wow, I'm struggling to
legitimately introduce this next one. Ok, I'm
going for direct.)
I don't work on Sundays.
Yes. I don't work on Sundays. It's the day
I put on my shelves everything that attempts
to pressure and push me around. At the most
basic level, I don't do homework. At the most

abstract level, I do anything and everything
that truly fulfills me. This means much of my
adored alone time, reading, journaling and
seeing the people I love for rendezvous dates
and adventures. (I have a blog about cafes
and restaurants, to give you a hint on what my
exploration style is.) Every Sunday is differ
ent because no week is the same, but the
timeless constant is that it's cut from worldly
chronology.
Perhaps you're thinking I'm taking eight
units, but this is my "hardest" quarter. Typical
student small talk is usually a complaint con
gress, debating who is reaching insanity faster,
so please see this as honest context: editing an
academic journal, two (different) language
partners three times a week, uncompleted
major declaration and study-abroad applica
tion, a job on campus (I got the You're Hired
e-mail yesterday!), several weekly commit
ments to my faith's fellowship (though I feel
more need for these than duty), this Wednes
day column (also not dread-inducing yay!),
five courses, the most homework I've had to
date, and 20 units (again, but this time not
buffered by an athletic class, which I thus had
to pay for instead).
Honoring an entire day of rest was not
and is not a Sunday-morning decision, and
requires some wily scheduling strategies.
Looking in from the outside, it appears unat

tainable and what? Difficult? Wasteful?
Unproductive ? That's what I first thought,
before 1 opted in. Actually, though, when 1 ac
knowledged my refusal or inability to rest, I
realized I was opting out. I was opting out of
this entire framework where we pick our ma
jors and courses and activities and then let
the world pick how we operate them. We live
and breathe an atmosphere that demands
that we work, all the time, and the signifi
cance is lost in the agenda. But when I start
ed resting (doesn't it sound epic?), I re-estab
lished all of my weekday work as my privi
leged choice, and not my charge. 1 rest be
cause 1 need to and 1 want to and it's possible.
My Sunday of rest is counterculture. That
means many challenging conflicts as I put
myself at odds with most of my classmates
and virtually disconnect. It's my weekly gift
of nothing related to the world's stubbornly
narrow idea of productivity. Consequently,
the one question I get, even if well-inten
tioned, is a frown-tinged "So what do you
do?" The easy, literal and beautiful answer is
that I rest. I watch out for this girl named
Nina who loves going out, running around,
sitting outside on benches (watching people)
and remembering her favorite things.
Every day is technically still my favorite.
On this one day, though, the world and all of
the petty things it asks of me gets a busy tone.
There's so much constant stress around, but
I've never felt this much stability and peace
in my life. I'm serious. And there's so much
more goodness in that than I ever could have
imagined. Or tried to stick in between study
sessions.

Nina still hasn't received any e-mail responses
from secret mysterious readers. Don't be a
stranger: ninamc@stanford. edu.
