"i feel you zach. but i do think that we're going in the right direction." —
masaru, Oct. 5
"Zach, i admire your passion, but the lack of fan passion is a west coast issue in
general." — Andrew, Oct. 5
"What I have to wonder is if it comes down to living in an area with tons of pro
sports teams and other cultural events, whereas up here there ain't much happen
ing other than football." — Mike in PDX, Oct. 5
"You should have done your diligence. Stanford has never been a sports school."
— Your Boss, Oct. 5
"Also, just so we're all clear, there is no excuse for Stanford fans to not jump
during All Right Now. The 60-year-olds who frequent the women's volleyball
games show more enthusiasm than many of the students, yes we all see you when
you just pretend to jump." — Jeremy C, Oct. 5

On "Editorial: Students face enormous stakes in November," Oct. 5:
"The Stanford Daily: providing rallying cries to Democrats, and tritely blam
ing Republicans for all our global problems, since 1892." — Political Moderate,

"Your fairly baseless insult (didn't this same editorial board argue in favor of
ROTC last week) also ignores historical fact. I.e. the state of the Democratic and
Republican parties in 1892." — Funny, Oct. 5
