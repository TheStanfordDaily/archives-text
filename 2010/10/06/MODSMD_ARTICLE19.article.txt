## Confronting concussions Football head injuries prompt doctors' worry 
### LIZZY COLLINS 
One aspect of the game of foot
ball that tends to grab everyone's at
tention is the extremely brutal hit
that is delivered by one player to an
other. The sheer power and force
that is exhibited in a collision be
tween players is incredible to wit
ness. Yet, what often follows these
brutal collisions is the chilling silence
of a stadium with a player lying mo
tionless on the field.
On Oct. 2 against the No. 3 Oregon
Ducks, junior wide receiver Chris
Owusu took a violent hit to the head.
Although Owusu's diagnosis remains
unknown, his injury rocked the Stan
ford community and brought to light
once again the concern over injuries
resulting from football, namely brain
and spinal cord injuries.
Football is regarded as an ex
tremely physical sport, and with
growing numbers of concussions
comes the question of whether the
violence inherent to the sport can be
reduced. Youth around the country
are picking up helmets and shoulder
pads and taking to the fields to
"rough the other guys up," despite in
creasing information about the risk
that the sport poses to the develop
ing brain. Quite simply, the human
brain cannot handle the continuous
high impact that football entails. And
while helmets properly support the
head and prevent injuries like skull
fractures, they do not protect the in

terior of the head at all.
Concussions occur when the head
is violently forced in one direction
and then is stopped or spun rapidly.
As helmets clash, the cranium
thrashes against the skull the
head inadvertently decelerates while
the brain lurches forward. This un
natural shaking of the brain causes
brain cells to become depolarized
and simultaneously fire their neuro
transmitters at once in an unhealthy
cascade, severely threatening the
brain's receptors linked to learning
and memory.
University of Kentucky spinal
cord and brain injury researcher Dr.
Jonathan Lifshitz has been research
ing a relatively new phenomenon
called the fencing response. The
fencing response is an involuntary
movement in which a person extends
his or her arms in the air immediate
ly following a concussion. It is used as
a clear indicator of a moderate brain
injury.
"The fencing response was a for
tuitous finding in both animal and
man, which can be used to rapidly
identify a head injury and guide im
mediate medical care," Lifshitz said.
"We are currently working on the
long-term behavioral and pathologi
cal consequences."
Recurring hits to the head can re
sult in lifelong consequences, and the
issue in football is becoming more
and more concerning. The physiques
of professional athletes are only
making the game more dangerous,
with linemen weighing in between
300 and 350 pounds. They launch
themselves headfirst at their oppo
nents, resulting in forceful helmet-to
helmet contact. Coaches and fans
love the hard-hitting action of foot

ball, but the potential long-term
harm to the players is becoming a
vital and life-threatening issue.
One of the most severe diseases
shaking the football community is
chronic traumatic encephalopathy
(CTE). CTE is a progressive degen
erative disease, typically found in in
dividuals who have suffered multi
ple concussions and other forms of
head injury. The disease, primarily
associated with contact sports such
as ice hockey, boxing, martial arts
and football, embodies the long
term neurological consequences of
repetitive blows to the head. The in
tense head trauma athletes experi
ence is a result of the degeneration
of brain tissue and the accumulation
of tau protein. Symptoms, which can
start months or even decades after
the trauma to the brain, range from
memory loss to aggression to de
pression.
Owen Thomas, a junior lineman
at the Elniversity of Pennsylvania,
hanged himself in his apartment last
April. With no previous history of de
pression, the 6-foot-2, 240-pound
football player shocked the UPenn
community with his unexpected and
aberrant emotional collapse. Elpon
examination of Thomas' brain tissue,
doctors at Boston University discov
ered early stages of CTE. Doctors in
sist that, while it may not be the sole
cause of Thomas' suicide, the severe
trauma to his brain undoubtedly re
sulted from the numerous collisions
he endured in his 12 years of football.
Many of football's ruling powers
have begun to realize that change is
of the essence that new rules, a
new mentality and a new approach
are needed to tackle this problem at
the core of the football community.

In light of the recurring incidences,
the NFL recognized the gravity of
concussions and has taken steps to
ward addressing the problem. As of
December 2009, an NFL player who
sustains a concussion or exhibits
signs of a concussion cannot partici
pate in a game or practice the same
day of the injury.
Though unlikely to be enacted any
time soon, some propose the possibili
ty of doing away with the three-point
stance for linemen. If linemen were to
start in an upright position with no
hands on the ground, they would be
forced to block with their arms and
hands as opposed to their heads.
While important at the NFL level,

the reform movement should also
begin to trickle down to all levels of
the game. It is imperative that coach
es teach players the most basic fun
damentals of proper tackling to re
duce the chances of a serious head in
jury. Players should be reminded to
keep their heads up and to see what
they hit. Head injuries are happening
at all levels of the game and are oc
curring in kids as young as nine.
The New York Times, which has
reported extensively on this topic,
quoted current Baltimore Ravens
cornerback Domonique Foxworth as
saying, "Ninety-nine percent of the
people who put on helmets don't get
the payback we do [as professionals],

but they're taking the same risks.
[The warning is] probably more valu
able to them than it is to a lot of us."

The game of football holds such a
high place in today's culture that it is
almost impossible to imagine the
sport's popularity being seriously
threatened by a medical issue. But as
people are becoming increasingly
aware of the severity and long-term
consequences that result from foot
ball collisions, the need to find cor
rective solutions to protect the
health of its players is becoming the
sport's top priority.

Traumatic head injuries resulting from hard hits, like the one that sidelined junior wide receiver Chris Owusu (81)
in Stanford's match-up against Oregon last Saturday, are of increasing concern within the football community.
One aspect of the game of foot
ball that tends to grab everyone's at
tention is the extremely brutal hit
that is delivered by one player to an
other. The sheer power and force
that is exhibited in a collision be
tween players is incredible to wit
ness. Yet, what often follows these
brutal collisions is the chilling silence
of a stadium with a player lying mo
tionless on the field.
On Oct. 2 against the No. 3 Oregon
Ducks, junior wide receiver Chris
Owusu took a violent hit to the head.
Although Owusu's diagnosis remains
unknown, his injury rocked the Stan
ford community and brought to light
once again the concern over injuries
resulting from football, namely brain
and spinal cord injuries.
Football is regarded as an ex
tremely physical sport, and with
growing numbers of concussions
comes the question of whether the
violence inherent to the sport can be
reduced. Youth around the country
are picking up helmets and shoulder
pads and taking to the fields to
"rough the other guys up," despite in
creasing information about the risk
that the sport poses to the develop
ing brain. Quite simply, the human
brain cannot handle the continuous
high impact that football entails. And
while helmets properly support the
head and prevent injuries like skull
fractures, they do not protect the in

terior of the head at all.
Concussions occur when the head
is violently forced in one direction
and then is stopped or spun rapidly.
As helmets clash, the cranium
thrashes against the skull the
head inadvertently decelerates while
the brain lurches forward. This un
natural shaking of the brain causes
brain cells to become depolarized
and simultaneously fire their neuro
transmitters at once in an unhealthy
cascade, severely threatening the
brain's receptors linked to learning
and memory.
University of Kentucky spinal
cord and brain injury researcher Dr.
Jonathan Lifshitz has been research
ing a relatively new phenomenon
called the fencing response. The
fencing response is an involuntary
movement in which a person extends
his or her arms in the air immediate
ly following a concussion. It is used as
a clear indicator of a moderate brain
injury.
"The fencing response was a for
tuitous finding in both animal and
man, which can be used to rapidly
identify a head injury and guide im
mediate medical care," Lifshitz said.
"We are currently working on the
long-term behavioral and pathologi
cal consequences."
Recurring hits to the head can re
sult in lifelong consequences, and the
issue in football is becoming more
and more concerning. The physiques
of professional athletes are only
making the game more dangerous,
with linemen weighing in between
300 and 350 pounds. They launch
themselves headfirst at their oppo
nents, resulting in forceful helmet-to
helmet contact. Coaches and fans
love the hard-hitting action of foot

ball, but the potential long-term
harm to the players is becoming a
vital and life-threatening issue.
One of the most severe diseases
shaking the football community is
chronic traumatic encephalopathy
(CTE). CTE is a progressive degen
erative disease, typically found in in
dividuals who have suffered multi
ple concussions and other forms of
head injury. The disease, primarily
associated with contact sports such
as ice hockey, boxing, martial arts
and football, embodies the long
term neurological consequences of
repetitive blows to the head. The in
tense head trauma athletes experi
ence is a result of the degeneration
of brain tissue and the accumulation
of tau protein. Symptoms, which can
start months or even decades after
the trauma to the brain, range from
memory loss to aggression to de
pression.
Owen Thomas, a junior lineman
at the Elniversity of Pennsylvania,
hanged himself in his apartment last
April. With no previous history of de
pression, the 6-foot-2, 240-pound
football player shocked the UPenn
community with his unexpected and
aberrant emotional collapse. Elpon
examination of Thomas' brain tissue,
doctors at Boston University discov
ered early stages of CTE. Doctors in
sist that, while it may not be the sole
cause of Thomas' suicide, the severe
trauma to his brain undoubtedly re
sulted from the numerous collisions
he endured in his 12 years of football.
Many of football's ruling powers
have begun to realize that change is
of the essence that new rules, a
new mentality and a new approach
are needed to tackle this problem at
the core of the football community.

In light of the recurring incidences,
the NFL recognized the gravity of
concussions and has taken steps to
ward addressing the problem. As of
December 2009, an NFL player who
sustains a concussion or exhibits
signs of a concussion cannot partici
pate in a game or practice the same
day of the injury.
Though unlikely to be enacted any
time soon, some propose the possibili
ty of doing away with the three-point
stance for linemen. If linemen were to
start in an upright position with no
hands on the ground, they would be
forced to block with their arms and
hands as opposed to their heads.
While important at the NFL level,

the reform movement should also
begin to trickle down to all levels of
the game. It is imperative that coach
es teach players the most basic fun
damentals of proper tackling to re
duce the chances of a serious head in
jury. Players should be reminded to
keep their heads up and to see what
they hit. Head injuries are happening
at all levels of the game and are oc
curring in kids as young as nine.
The New York Times, which has
reported extensively on this topic,
quoted current Baltimore Ravens
cornerback Domonique Foxworth as
saying, "Ninety-nine percent of the
people who put on helmets don't get
the payback we do [as professionals],

but they're taking the same risks.
[The warning is] probably more valu
able to them than it is to a lot of us."

The game of football holds such a
high place in today's culture that it is
almost impossible to imagine the
sport's popularity being seriously
threatened by a medical issue. But as
people are becoming increasingly
aware of the severity and long-term
consequences that result from foot

rective solutions to protect the
