## Senate passes funding for Full Moon Appropriations Committee: group funding to be more 'data-driven' 
### MARGARET RAWSON STAFF WRITER 
The ASSU Undergraduate Senate adjourned Tuesday
evening after approving funding for Full Moon on the
Quad, discussing Nominations Commission openings and
several bills on previous notice and passing the week's
funding bills.
Full Moon
Sophomore Class Presidents Misha Nasro and Maxine
Litre requested funding for Full Moon on the Quad from
the ASSU traditions fund, money set aside last year by the
11th Undergraduate Senate for campus-wide traditions.
On Tuesday, the Senate re-approved $5,000 for Full
Moon on the Quad, which will be supplemented by fund
ing from Stanford Concert Network and the Office of the
Vice Provost for Student Affairs.
The event, which was officially cancelled last year due to
swine flu (H1N1) concerns, has been planned for Oct. 25 by
a sophomore class yet to experience the festivities in full.
This year's Full Moon celebrations fall on a Monday
night and will begin at Old Union due to noise concerns in
the Quad, after which the Band will escort partygoers to
the Quad for the countdown to midnight.
Nominations Commission
Stephanie Garrett 'l2, chair of the Nominations Com
mission, briefed the Senate on problems the commission
has been facing in filling positions on its various commit
tees.
It also came to Garrett's attention this week that the or
ganization's website is not functioning. Garrett urged those
who have applied or still wish to apply for a position to e
mail the Nominations Commission directly.
Appropriations
Appropriations Committee Chair Rafael Vasquez 'l2
reported Tuesday on the committee's lengthy Friday
evening meeting, during which senators completed a re
view of all general-fees policies. A similar review process,
the results of which will affect the 2011-2012 academic
year, will take place for special fees in the coming weeks.
Vasquez described the general fees review process and
said that funding for student groups this year will be "very
data-driven" as part of an effort to make the process more
clear to financial officers.
"Every single line item will be explained this year,"
Vasquez said.
Friday's Appropriations Committee meeting also in
cluded interviews with financial officers seeking budget ap
proval for their volunteer student organizations.
Juany Torres 'l3 said of the committee meeting,"We got
very positive feedback from the groups that came to see
us."
Senate Treasurer Stewart Macgregor-Dennis 'l3 re
ported Tuesday on the Senate's "take-back rate," the
amount of money unspent each year
by undergraduate student groups and
returned to the Appropriations Com
mittee.
Macgregor-Dennis reported last
year's rate as around $27,000, which,
after further investigation, the Appro
priations Committee may be permit
ted to dispense along with its normal
budget this year.

The Senate discussed several bills
on previous notice, including the first
part of a fiscal reform package, a bill to
establish standardized bill nomencla
ture, a bill to schedule Senate office
hours and a bill to encourage the cre
ation of a digital Senate archive.
Funding bills of the evening were
approved for the following student
groups: Pakistanis at Stanford, Ori

Taking Action Now: Darfur
(STAND).
