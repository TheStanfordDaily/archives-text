# HEAD TO HEAD
## Where should Pac-12 championship be held? 
### Miles Bennett-Smith Kabir Sawhney 
With the Pac-10 set
to become the
Pac-12 as soon as
next year, a foot
ball championship
game to determine West Coast su
premacy is quickly becoming a reality.
Immediately, the biggest question to
me is where the game would be held.
There are two schools of thought
one is that it could be held at the site of
the higher-seeded team, akin to the way
professional sports conduct playoffs.
The opposing view is that it could be
held at a predetermined "neutral" site.
I think that the game must be held at
the stadium of the higher-seeded team,
and I don't think it's even that close.
According to ESPN.com's Joe
Schad, Pac-10 Commissioner Larry
Scott and the powers that be in the Pac
-10 are considering Las Vegas; Los An
geles; Seattle and Glendale, Ariz., for a
potential "neutral-site" title game.
Los Angeles, Seattle and Glendale
all throw up immediate red flags be
cause of their supposed "neutrality." I
understand that it would be cool to
have the championship game at Seat
tle's Qwest Field, home to the NFL's
Seahawks, and a very nice stadium in its
own right. But if the idea is to play
someplace where no team has a distinct
advantage, how can the game be equi
table when the University of Washing
ton is just 10 minutes down the road? In
fact, UW is slated to play its home
games at Qwest in 2012.
I won't even begin about Seattle's

weather in December.
L.A. has the same "neutral" prob
lems. Would any team find it fair to play
USC or UCLA at the Rose Bowl? I
don't think so. Not to mention that the
Rose Bowl should be reserved for the
actual Rose Bowl. It would be very awk
ward for Oregon to win the Pac-12 in the
Rose Bowl, only to be rewarded with
another trip to Pasadena weeks later.
Games in Las Vegas would be easier
logistically, as there are endless hotel
rooms and travel would be simple, but I
think Las Vegas would easily outshine
the game. The city wouldn't stop to
watch the game it wouldn't even
slow down. The stadium also seats
36,800 and has terrible parking. I'm

talking pure desert dust.
But before I continue,let's just come
clean about something. The real reason
behind the debate about where to hold
the game and in fact the real reason
there will be a game at all is money.
The additional revenue generated
by an extra marquee game makes it lu
crative for the conference, and the com
missioner and league executives want
their title game to be sexy. Corvallis,
Ore., is not sexy. Neither is Pullman,
Wash. Were Oregon State or Washing
ton State to have the top seed some day,
the title game might have to be played
there.
So yes, leaving the title game location
up to chance is somewhat risky. And
some argue that there would not be
enough time between the end of the Pac
12's regular season and the title game
(usually about two weeks) for the prop
er infrastructure and hoopla to be set up.
Fine, Those are all perfectly logical
arguments against letting teams host
the game. But before you go along with
the majority and side with the big
money executives, think about this
Stanford Stadium at night, filled to the
brim with raucous Stanford students
and alums all cheering for their team to
win the championship on their turf. An
entire campus consumed with Pac-12
football fever. It could happen.
I think that students should have the
chance to root on their team in the con
ference title gameaf their stadium. Or at
the very least make it a fantastic road
trip to someplace like Autzen Stadium
in Eugene or yes, Qwest Field if Wash
ington were the high seed.The stadiums
would sell out for sure, something not
guaranteed and rather unlikely if the
game involved out-of-market fans.

(The 2008 ACC title
game was held away
from most of its mem
ber campuses in
Tampa, Fla., and
drew 27,360 fans in a
j\ 65,000-seat stadium.)
M And there is some-
J thing to be said for giv
ing the higher-ranked
team home-field advan
tage. If we sanction it in
every professional sport, why
don't we do it in college?

If the Pac-12 adopts a neutral-site
championship model, I believe that
some of the luster is lost from the game
itself. Perhaps the most appealing as
pect of the college football environ
ment is the atmosphere around the
game. Joy and electricity spread far and
wide on college campuses everywhere
Saturday mornings.
Please, Larry Scott, don't take that
away. Please, Pac-12, give part of the
game back to the students and the cam
puses that make college football games
far and away the most well-attended
sporting events in the country.

With the Pac-12 offi
cially set to begin
play next season, it's
time to open up the
debate of where the
conference's new football champi
onship game should be located: at a
neutral site, or on the campus of the
team with the best conference
record. While there are strong argu
ments on both sides, the best thing for
the conference to do would be to
hold the game at a neutral, off-cam
pus location.
To give a quick overview of the cur
rent status of discussions, Pac-10 offi
cials are debating between several
sites, as well as the on-campus option.
Six cities are currently receiving seri-

ous consideration: Glen
dale, Ariz.; San Diego;
Los Angeles; San
Francisco; Las
Vegas and Seat
tle. The fron
trunners are
San Francisco
and Seattle
Los Angeles is a
weak choice be
cause the winner
of the game would
be going right back to
the Rose Bowl in January,
Glendale is already the site of a
BCS bowl, San Diego started out as
a dark horse candidate and Las Vegas
(while nearly ideal) doesn't have an

appropriate venue.
So why should the new Pac-12
choose to stage its championship
game at one of these sites anyway?
The arguments for staying on campus
are pretty strong namely, it would
give teams further incentive to play
for a better final record and make it
easier to fans to attend games.
However, this scheme could back
fire in any number of ways. Let's be
fully honest the reason the Pac-12
wants a championship game is be
cause the game would generate a fair
amount of money for the conference
through ticket sales and (mainly)
media contracts with big networks.
Putting the game in a home stadium
would work quite nicely if, say, USC
won the conference the Trojans
would certainly fill their 90,000-seat
stadium, and they have an ideal loca
tion to attract a whole mess of media
attention.
Should the game end up in some
godforsaken location like Pullman,
Wash, or Corvallis, Ore., this equation
would be totally reversed. Yes, the sta
diums would most likely be sold out,
since fans of the home school would
undoubtedly buy up every seat. How
ever, the conference wouldn't attain
anywhere near the media exposure it
is looking for, and the game would be
easily overshadowed by the big-ticket

SEC and Big Ten championship
games (held in Atlanta and Indi
anapolis, respectively).
Competitively, there are also issues
with deciding which division champi
on would get the game. Though the
Pac-10 currently plays a round-robin
schedule, with each team playing
every other team once a season in
football, the addition of Colorado and
Utah will necessitate splitting the con
ference up into divisions. The Pac-12 is
expected to continue its nine-game
conference schedule, with each team
playing five games against the rest of
its division and four games against
teams from the other division. Natu
rally, the strength of conference sched
ule will vary, but if one division is sig
nificantly weaker than another, it
could make the choice of host campus
unfair.

More broadly, this debate is about
the Pac-12 measuring up to the other
conferences with which it aspires to
compete. Today, the Pac-10 does not
receive as much media attention and
respect as some of its rival conferences
indeed, this was part of the reason
that the conference chose to aggres
sively pursue expansion opportunities
in the past few months. Putting its new
championship game at a bona fide
NFL venue is an important step to
ward gaining the same kind of prestige
as the Big Ten and the SEC. Putting it
anywhere else would broadcast this
message: "We're not quite good
enough to fill a big stadium with fans,
so we're going to throw some bullshit
justifications around and put the game
somewhere it would definitely be
filled."
The Pac-10 has aspirations of be
coming an elite conference, especially
in football. In order to do that, it needs
a championship game in a major city
that will attract the attention of the na
tion in away that a middle-of
nowhere college campus just can't.
The conference wants to play with the
big boys, but if it goes through with
putting its marquee event on campus,
it'll have to stay at the kids' table.

Ore., is not sexy. Neither is Pullman,
Wash. Were Oregon State or Washing
ton State to have the top seed some day,
the title game might have to be played
there.
So yes, leaving the title game location
up to chance is somewhat risky. And
some argue that there would not be
enough time between the end of the Pac
12's regular season and the title game
(usually about two weeks) for the prop
er infrastructure and hoopla to be set up.
Fine, Those are all perfectly logical
arguments against letting teams host
the game. But before you go along with
the majority and side with the big
money executives, think about this
Stanford Stadium at night, filled to the
brim with raucous Stanford students
and alums all cheering for their team to
win the championship on their turf. An
entire campus consumed with Pac-12
football fever. It could happen.
I think that students should have the
chance to root on their team in the con
ference title gameaf their stadium. Or at
the very least make it a fantastic road
trip to someplace like Autzen Stadium
in Eugene or yes, Qwest Field if Wash
ington were the high seed.The stadiums
would sell out for sure, something not
guaranteed and rather unlikely if the
game involved out-of-market fans.

(The 2008 ACC title
game was held away
from most of its mem
ber campuses in
Tampa, Fla., and
drew 27,360 fans in a
j\ 65,000-seat stadium.)
M And there is some-
J thing to be said for giv
ing the higher-ranked
team home-field advan
tage. If we sanction it in
every professional sport, why
don't we do it in college?

If the Pac-12 adopts a neutral-site
championship model, I believe that
some of the luster is lost from the game
itself. Perhaps the most appealing as
pect of the college football environ
ment is the atmosphere around the
game. Joy and electricity spread far and
wide on college campuses everywhere
Saturday mornings.
Please, Larry Scott, don't take that
away. Please, Pac-12, give part of the
game back to the students and the cam
puses that make college football games
far and away the most well-attended
sporting events in the country.

With the Pac-12 offi
cially set to begin
play next season, it's
time to open up the
debate of where the
conference's new football champi
onship game should be located: at a
neutral site, or on the campus of the
team with the best conference
record. While there are strong argu
ments on both sides, the best thing for
the conference to do would be to
hold the game at a neutral, off-cam
pus location.
To give a quick overview of the cur
rent status of discussions, Pac-10 offi
cials are debating between several
sites, as well as the on-campus option.
Six cities are currently receiving seri-

ous consideration: Glen
dale, Ariz.; San Diego;
Los Angeles; San
Francisco; Las
Vegas and Seat
tle. The fron
trunners are
San Francisco
and Seattle
Los Angeles is a
weak choice be
cause the winner
of the game would
be going right back to
the Rose Bowl in January,
Glendale is already the site of a
BCS bowl, San Diego started out as
a dark horse candidate and Las Vegas
(while nearly ideal) doesn't have an

appropriate venue.
So why should the new Pac-12
choose to stage its championship
game at one of these sites anyway?
The arguments for staying on campus
are pretty strong namely, it would
give teams further incentive to play
for a better final record and make it
easier to fans to attend games.
However, this scheme could back
fire in any number of ways. Let's be
fully honest the reason the Pac-12
wants a championship game is be
cause the game would generate a fair
amount of money for the conference
through ticket sales and (mainly)
media contracts with big networks.
Putting the game in a home stadium
would work quite nicely if, say, USC
won the conference the Trojans
would certainly fill their 90,000-seat
stadium, and they have an ideal loca
tion to attract a whole mess of media
attention.
Should the game end up in some
godforsaken location like Pullman,
Wash, or Corvallis, Ore., this equation
would be totally reversed. Yes, the sta
diums would most likely be sold out,
since fans of the home school would
undoubtedly buy up every seat. How
ever, the conference wouldn't attain
anywhere near the media exposure it
is looking for, and the game would be
easily overshadowed by the big-ticket

SEC and Big Ten championship
games (held in Atlanta and Indi
anapolis, respectively).
Competitively, there are also issues
with deciding which division champi
on would get the game. Though the
Pac-10 currently plays a round-robin
schedule, with each team playing
every other team once a season in
football, the addition of Colorado and
Utah will necessitate splitting the con
ference up into divisions. The Pac-12 is
expected to continue its nine-game
conference schedule, with each team
playing five games against the rest of
its division and four games against
teams from the other division. Natu
rally, the strength of conference sched
ule will vary, but if one division is sig
nificantly weaker than another, it
could make the choice of host campus
unfair.

More broadly, this debate is about
the Pac-12 measuring up to the other
conferences with which it aspires to
compete. Today, the Pac-10 does not
receive as much media attention and
respect as some of its rival conferences
indeed, this was part of the reason
that the conference chose to aggres
sively pursue expansion opportunities
in the past few months. Putting its new
championship game at a bona fide
NFL venue is an important step to
ward gaining the same kind of prestige
as the Big Ten and the SEC. Putting it
anywhere else would broadcast this
message: "We're not quite good
enough to fill a big stadium with fans,
so we're going to throw some bullshit
justifications around and put the game
somewhere it would definitely be
filled."
The Pac-10 has aspirations of be
coming an elite conference, especially
in football. In order to do that, it needs
a championship game in a major city
that will attract the attention of the na
tion in away that a middle-of
nowhere college campus just can't.
The conference wants to play with the
big boys, but if it goes through with
putting its marquee event on campus,
it'll have to stay at the kids' table.

With the Pac-10 set
to become the
Pac-12 as soon as
next year, a foot
ball championship
game to determine West Coast su
premacy is quickly becoming a reality.
Immediately, the biggest question to
me is where the game would be held.
There are two schools of thought
one is that it could be held at the site of
the higher-seeded team, akin to the way
professional sports conduct playoffs.
The opposing view is that it could be
held at a predetermined "neutral" site.
I think that the game must be held at
the stadium of the higher-seeded team,
and I don't think it's even that close.
According to ESPN.com's Joe
Schad, Pac-10 Commissioner Larry
Scott and the powers that be in the Pac
-10 are considering Las Vegas; Los An
geles; Seattle and Glendale, Ariz., for a
potential "neutral-site" title game.
Los Angeles, Seattle and Glendale
all throw up immediate red flags be
cause of their supposed "neutrality." I
understand that it would be cool to
have the championship game at Seat
tle's Qwest Field, home to the NFL's
Seahawks, and a very nice stadium in its
own right. But if the idea is to play
someplace where no team has a distinct
advantage, how can the game be equi
table when the University of Washing
ton is just 10 minutes down the road? In
fact, UW is slated to play its home
games at Qwest in 2012.
I won't even begin about Seattle's

weather in December.
L.A. has the same "neutral" prob
lems. Would any team find it fair to play
USC or UCLA at the Rose Bowl? I
don't think so. Not to mention that the
Rose Bowl should be reserved for the
actual Rose Bowl. It would be very awk
ward for Oregon to win the Pac-12 in the
Rose Bowl, only to be rewarded with
another trip to Pasadena weeks later.
Games in Las Vegas would be easier
logistically, as there are endless hotel
rooms and travel would be simple, but I
think Las Vegas would easily outshine
the game. The city wouldn't stop to
watch the game it wouldn't even
slow down. The stadium also seats
36,800 and has terrible parking. I'm

talking pure desert dust.
But before I continue,let's just come
clean about something. The real reason
behind the debate about where to hold
the game and in fact the real reason
there will be a game at all is money.
The additional revenue generated
by an extra marquee game makes it lu
crative for the conference, and the com
missioner and league executives want
their title game to be sexy. Corvallis,
Ore., is not sexy. Neither is Pullman,
Wash. Were Oregon State or Washing
ton State to have the top seed some day,
the title game might have to be played
