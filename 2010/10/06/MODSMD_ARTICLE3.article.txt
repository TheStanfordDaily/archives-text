## Hundreds search for jobs opportunities, summer internships 
### MARIANNE LeVINE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
If the employer turnout at Tues
day's career fair in White Plaza is any
indication of the health of the job
market, soon-to-be Stanford gradu
ates could take a little heart. The an
nual fair, hosted by the Career Devel
opment Center (CDC), featured 268
employers, a slight improvement over
the 215 employers who attended last
year.

The recession had a significant im
pact on the number of employers
who attend the fairs, said CDC Direc
tor Lance Choy. Prior to the reces
sion, Stanford had 300 employers at
tending in addition to a waitlist, he
said.
The career fair on Tuesday offered
numerous full-time employment and
internship opportunities for both un
dergraduate and graduate students.
Companies there included Apple
Inc., Morgan Stanley, the FBI and

Abercrombie & Fitch. Many had sev
eral positions to advertise.
"We think the economy is improv
ing and expect to hire new college
graduates next summer ... we have
as many as 10 open positions," said
Kathy Englar, a representative for In
tApp, a software company in Palo
Alto. The Stanford career fair has
played an important role in employ
ment for IntApp, Englar said
