# More employers turn out for fall career fair
## Hundreds search for jobs opportunities, summer internships 
### MARIANNE LeVINE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
If the employer turnout at Tues
day's career fair in White Plaza is any
indication of the health of the job
market, soon-to-be Stanford gradu
ates could take a little heart. The an
nual fair, hosted by the Career Devel
opment Center (CDC), featured 268
employers, a slight improvement over
the 215 employers who attended last
year.

The recession had a significant im
pact on the number of employers
who attend the fairs, said CDC Direc
tor Lance Choy. Prior to the reces
sion, Stanford had 300 employers at
tending in addition to a waitlist, he
said.
The career fair on Tuesday offered
numerous full-time employment and
internship opportunities for both un
dergraduate and graduate students.
Companies there included Apple
Inc., Morgan Stanley, the FBI and

Abercrombie & Fitch. Many had sev
eral positions to advertise.
"We think the economy is improv
ing and expect to hire new college
graduates next summer ... we have
as many as 10 open positions," said
Kathy Englar, a representative for In
tApp, a software company in Palo
Alto. The Stanford career fair has
played an important role in employ
ment for IntApp, Englar said

Representatives from Lockheed Martin talk to first-year graduate student James Sung and Kevin Ting '11 on Tuesday
about the company's job opportunities. Lockheed Martin was one of 268 employers, up from 215 last year, at the fair.
more than 50 percent of the compa
ny's employees are Stanford gradu
ates.
While companies like IntApp are
specifically recruiting engineering
and computer science majors, other
companies do not have specific ma
jors as criteria for employment.
Jacquelyn Dulis, the district manag
er for the Social Security Adminis
tration, said she was looking to re
cruit a service representative and a
claims representative. Although she
was mainly looking for graduate stu
dents, she said an interest in public
service was the only factor candi

dates needed. Like Englar, Dulis
said she believes that the economy is
improving.
"For us, we're hiring more this
year than we've been able to in the
last few years," Dulis said. "As a re
sult of the president's encourage
ment of employment, the federal
government is looking to put people
to work."
Most undergraduates who at
tended the career fair were seeking
internships.
"I'm looking to find an internship
for the summer," said Sam Beder
'l3. "There are a wide range of em
ployers here, from business to in
vestment banking opportunities. I
feel like the career fair is a great way
for undergrads to pitch to business
es, especially the big people who
mostly aren't interested in under

grads."
Despite the number of employ
ers who attend career fairs, the fairs
are but one of many ways to find em
ployment, Choy said. According to
CDC-conducted surveys, 9 to 14
percent of students with bachelor's
degrees find jobs through career
fairs, as do 12 to 18 percent of stu
dents with master's degrees. That
doesn't include students who find
internships, Choy said.
"Only a small fraction of employ
ers participate in career fairs, which
can be seen as extremely time con
suming," he added."Students should
make an appointment with career
counselors to help them develop
strategies to find employment."
