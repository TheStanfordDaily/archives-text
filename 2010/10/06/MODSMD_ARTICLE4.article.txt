### SAMANTHA MCGIRR DESK EDITOR 
The Jen-Hsun Huang Engineering Center was
dedicated in front of a crowd of 150 on Tuesday, in
augurating the latest addition to the Science and En
gineering Quad. Amid recessed lighting and modu
lar furniture, the crowd watched as the University's
brightest minds in engineering discussed the center
and its potential role in Silicon Valley innovation.
The formal dedication of the $3O million building
was held in the Huang Center Amphitheatre and
featured School of Engineering Dean Jim Plummer,
President John Hennessy, lead donor Jen-Hsun
Huang M.S. '92 and Board of Trustees Chair Leslie
Hume.
Prior to the dedication, the crowd watched from
a screen in the newly christened Nvidia Center of
the building as Plummer moderated a symposium
among Hennessy, Huang and Yahoo co-founder
Jerry Yang '9O M.S. '9l. Entitled "Technology Inno
vation in the 21st Century," the symposium centered
on the importance of engineering as a discipline and
the need to train engineers who possess business
skills and are cognizant of social issues. Plummer
emphasized the need for engineers to develop a
multidisciplinary approach as they tackle current
energy and technology challenges.
"We have narrowly defined academic disciplines,
but we need to find ways to educate students more
broadly or to create teams that are interdiscipli
nary," he said.
Nancy Peterson, director of communications for
the School of Engineering, echoed Plummer's senti
ments, saying the center will equip students with the
tools to become not only excellent engineers, but
also savvy entrepreneurs and community activists.
