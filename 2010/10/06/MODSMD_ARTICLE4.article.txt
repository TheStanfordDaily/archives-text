## Huang Center debuts in new science quad Hennessy, Huang and guests discuss future of engineering 
### SAMANTHA MCGIRR DESK EDITOR 
The Jen-Hsun Huang Engineering Center was
dedicated in front of a crowd of 150 on Tuesday, in
augurating the latest addition to the Science and En
gineering Quad. Amid recessed lighting and modu
lar furniture, the crowd watched as the University's
brightest minds in engineering discussed the center
and its potential role in Silicon Valley innovation.
The formal dedication of the $3O million building
was held in the Huang Center Amphitheatre and
featured School of Engineering Dean Jim Plummer,
President John Hennessy, lead donor Jen-Hsun
Huang M.S. '92 and Board of Trustees Chair Leslie
Hume.
Prior to the dedication, the crowd watched from
a screen in the newly christened Nvidia Center of
the building as Plummer moderated a symposium
among Hennessy, Huang and Yahoo co-founder
Jerry Yang '9O M.S. '9l. Entitled "Technology Inno
vation in the 21st Century," the symposium centered
on the importance of engineering as a discipline and
the need to train engineers who possess business
skills and are cognizant of social issues. Plummer
emphasized the need for engineers to develop a
multidisciplinary approach as they tackle current
energy and technology challenges.
"We have narrowly defined academic disciplines,
but we need to find ways to educate students more
broadly or to create teams that are interdiscipli
nary," he said.
Nancy Peterson, director of communications for
the School of Engineering, echoed Plummer's senti
ments, saying the center will equip students with the
tools to become not only excellent engineers, but
also savvy entrepreneurs and community activists.
"We're emphasizing both
breadth in a discipline and broad
skills," she said. "As Dean Plummer
says, we want to create T-shaped
people, where the vertical bar is
depth in a particular discipline, and
the horizontal bar is breadth
things like communication, leader
ship, cultural awareness."
Quoting Ronald Reagan, Hen
nessy voiced the need to "break
down these walls" that separate the
hard sciences and engineering from
other aspects of society. The key, he
argues, is to put power in students'
hands.
"If we let students drive learning,
they will build cross-disciplinary col
laboration," he said.
The Huang Center was designed
with collaboration in mind. The
building features an open floor plan,
conference rooms with transparent
glass walls and modular furniture,
meant to be moved around during
group projects. Proponents hope
that the open, modular design, simi
lar to that of Wallenberg Hall in the
Main Quad and the Peterson Build
ing at the Institute for Design, will fa
cilitate fruitful collaboration.
Huang pointed out that the
culture of innovation at Stanford
also facilitates groundbreaking
discovery.
"At Stanford, you have permis

sion to fail," he said. "At some places,
there's a deep sense of disappoint
ment. Here, we just want to know,
'What did you learn from your fail
ure?'"
Peterson, too, believes that such a
bold and fearless spirit will be neces
sary as engineers prepare to tackle
the technological problems of the
new millennium.
"The Huang Center is an outward
and visible sign that we are focusing
on engineering education for the
21st century," she said.
