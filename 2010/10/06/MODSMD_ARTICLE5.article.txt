Zebrafish and your PowerPoint presen
tation. What's the connection?

According to a recent study led by re
searchers in the Stanford School of Medi
cine, zebrafish suggest that, rather than
paging through your slides just a few more
times as the clock ticks onward, or endless
ly rehearsing your speech into the night, it
might be wisest to get a few good hours of

shut-eye before your test or presentation.
Throughout the day, as animals and hu
mans learn, communicate and perform
their daily habits, the brain forms new
synapses to handle the inputs of informa
tion. Now, Stanford scientists have used ze
brafish, transparent freshwater fish related
to minnows and commonly used as models
in scientific studies, to actually trace the
changes in the number of synapses be
tween waking and sleep. According to a
paper published in Wednesday's issue of

Neuron, synapses in the brain decrease as
you sleep, consolidating important infor
mation and shedding irrelevant irritants.
"When you're awake in the day, you
create more and more synapses to do
things, but at a certain point, this would be
unsustainable," said Emmanual Mignot,
senior author of the paper and director of
the Stanford Center for Sleep Sciences and
Medicine. "Sleep is needed to clear all the
synapses that are not helpful to prune
the synapses that have not been used

much."
In other words, the phone number that
guy with bad breath at the bar gave you last
night? Blissfully gone by morning. Knowl
edge of how to brush your teeth? Still
there.
While similar theories had previously
been established about invertebrates, sci
entists had never before concretely
demonstrated this sleep-related synaptic
