## Zebrafish study lends clues to why humans need sleep 
### ZOE LEAVITT SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Zebrafish and your PowerPoint presen
tation. What's the connection?

According to a recent study led by re
searchers in the Stanford School of Medi
cine, zebrafish suggest that, rather than
paging through your slides just a few more
times as the clock ticks onward, or endless
ly rehearsing your speech into the night, it
might be wisest to get a few good hours of

shut-eye before your test or presentation.
Throughout the day, as animals and hu
mans learn, communicate and perform
their daily habits, the brain forms new
synapses to handle the inputs of informa
tion. Now, Stanford scientists have used ze
brafish, transparent freshwater fish related
to minnows and commonly used as models
in scientific studies, to actually trace the
changes in the number of synapses be
tween waking and sleep. According to a
paper published in Wednesday's issue of

Neuron, synapses in the brain decrease as
you sleep, consolidating important infor
mation and shedding irrelevant irritants.
"When you're awake in the day, you
create more and more synapses to do
things, but at a certain point, this would be
unsustainable," said Emmanual Mignot,
senior author of the paper and director of
the Stanford Center for Sleep Sciences and
Medicine. "Sleep is needed to clear all the
synapses that are not helpful to prune
the synapses that have not been used

much."
In other words, the phone number that
guy with bad breath at the bar gave you last
night? Blissfully gone by morning. Knowl
edge of how to brush your teeth? Still
there.
While similar theories had previously
been established about invertebrates, sci
entists had never before concretely
demonstrated this sleep-related synaptic
change in vertebrates, a group into
which humans fall.
"For the first time we demonstrat
ed the role of synaptic downscaling
on a living vertebrate," said Philippe
Mourrain, co-director of the study.
"We can actually see the change in
synaptic density within the animal."
The study further showed that
these synaptic changes depend on an
imals' circadian clocks and do not ad
just purely based on sleep.
In order to view the neurons
through the transparent zebrafish,
the Stanford team pioneered new im
aging methods that would trace brain
activity while avoiding affecting it.
"It was pretty special because no
body has ever been able to look in on
an animal throughout its entire circa
dian cycle," said Gordon Wang, who
co-authored the paper and designed
most of the imaging work. "You can
actually embed the zebrafish in
agarose without anesthesia, so there's
no issues with anesthesia affecting

sleep, and hold it in space and take im
ages throughout the day and night."
Zebrafish, though not as pervasive
as the mouse or fruit fly in lab studies,
made this study possible,
Mignot said.
"Its body plan and
brain are much more
similar to humans, it's v
cheap ... it has huge po-
tential," he said.
While zebrafish are more
similar to humans than fruit flies
are, their brains are still different
enough that researchers are wary
of drawing too many implications
for human sleep patterns. Further
more, because of the technological
challenges of tracing human brain ac
tivity while maintaining normal
sleeping patterns, it's "definitely sci
fi" to imagine similar studies on hu
mans, Mignot said.
"The real thing to keep in mind is
that sleep is such a complicated phe
nomenon that encompasses all parts
of the brain," Wang said.
At the same time, the researches
learned a little bit about their own
sleeping needs.
"You need to have someone that
will stay up for 24 or 36 hours ... to

take images every three hours,"
Mourrain said. "Even if you sleep-de
prive the fish, you do it to yourself as
well, so it's only fair."
