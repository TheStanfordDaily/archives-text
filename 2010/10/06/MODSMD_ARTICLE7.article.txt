# STUDENT LIFE
## Yes Plus program comes to Stanford 
### WILLA BROCK 
Everyone's heard the saying:
Stanford students are like ducks,
calm on the surface, but paddling
furiously under the water. The
Wellness Project, a new student
group, wants to give those ducks
some water wings.
The organization is holding
three Yes Plus workshops this
quarter, aimed at teaching stu
dents to "utilize the power of nat
ural yoga, breathing and medita
tion to decrease stress and in
crease focus," said Vineet Singal
'l2, Wellness Committee Health
Coordinator.
The five-day workshops are
offered through the Art of Living
Foundation in conjunction with
Vaden Health Promotion Ser
vices, and though they normally
cost $375, they are free for stu
dents who successfully submit a
scholarship application. The first

workshop is set for Oct. 6-10.
Chemistry graduate student
Debanti Sengupta, last year's
Wellness Project president, first
attended a Yes Plus workshop as
an undergraduate student at
Amherst College.
"I took the workshop at a time
in my life when I was going
through a lot of different
changes," she said. "I was very
skeptical about how a five-day
workshop might actually change
anything, but the techniques that
I learned there, the communities
that I formed, have actually
stayed with me since and have
been an invaluable asset."
The workshops teach students
tools to deal with their stress and
negative emotions and endeavor
to promote a culture of well
being on campus.
The term "wellness" is often
understood to mean a physical
state, said Singal, "but I think

there is a second, more ignored
component: your emotional, psy
chological and spiritual well
being. And I use the word 'spiritu
al' in the very broad sense, to in
clude things like religion, but also
things like your own understand
ing of who you are and what you
want to be."

Breathing techniques and
meditation are a big part of the
workshops, Sengupta said, but
the entire experience is holistic.
"We also have a service compo
nent of the program that encour
ages students to take the energy
that they gain with the tech
niques that we teach and give it
back to the community in the
form of a service project," she
said. Other parts of the workshop
deal with leadership skills such as
public speaking.
