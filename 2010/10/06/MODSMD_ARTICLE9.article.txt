1/ host mother, peeking
up from the pot of
espresso she is heating over the stove's open
flame. Coffee is a serious, serious business for
Antonella, a retired schoolteacher who has
made cooking her stock and trade. Achieving
the perfect espresso is a daily necessity.
"For favore," I respond groggily, plop
ping down at the mahogany kitchen table,
which is covered with assorted tins of bis
cotti and different fruit marmalades for
breakfast. Outside, the ring of steeple bells
wakes my sleepy neighborhood on Via dei
Macci, a historic street a few blocks from
the sprawling Piazza di Santa Croce in Flo
rence, Italy. Stanford has had an abroad
program in Florence for 50 years it was
the University's first foreign outpost.
After breakfast, I grab my book bag and
my door key, a three-inch contraption that
looks to be straight out of the 1500s, and
clamber down the four spiral flights of stairs
for my morning Italian class. As I leave, my
host mother reminds me to eat a good lunch
as if, in Italy, eating well is ever a prob
lem. It speaks volumes about a culture
where quel che non ti uccide, ti rafforza,
"what won't kill you will feed you," is a pop
ular proverb.
It takes 15 minutes to walk from Santa
Croce across the Ponte alle Grazie, down
the bank of the Arno River and up the five
flights of stairs to my class at The Stanford
Center, a towering building one block from
Florence's oldest bridge, the Ponte Vecchio.
On my way to the Center, pony-tailed men
lean casually against the storefront eaves

catcalling "Ciao bella" at the sea of stiletto
clad women sauntering by. A fleet of mope
ds careens down the impossibly narrow
streets, scattering throngs of tourists that
amble down the middle of the cobble
stoned roads. As I arrive at the Stanford
Center, I call out " Buongiorno!" to the sil
ver-haired doorman at the entrance, who by
now has become accustomed to the accent
ed Italian that students shoot his way every
morning.
After class, the afternoon is mine to do
what I like, which usually means a trip to a
gelateria for a frozen snack followed by me
andering through the streets. Before I know
it, it's nighttime, and Florence transforms
into a different city.
The Piazza di Santa Croce, which by day
houses hundreds of milling pigeons, be
comes an epicenter for nighttime revelers.
Clumps of Italian men and American stu
dents lounge on the basilica steps and pop
open bottles of Chianti Classico beneath
the towering statue of Dante Alighieri.
Throngs of students prance down Via Verdi,
stopping in the streets to greet their friends
with the customary two-cheek kiss before
ducking into one of the clubs blasting tech
no hits like "We No Speak Americano."
A month ago, when 23 other Stanford
students and I arrived in Florence for our
quarter abroad, we were told to make the
city our own. I didn't know exactly what
that meant at the time, especially in Flo
rence, a city so culturally different from
anywhere I had lived before. But now that I
habitually grab a panino from Salumeria
Verdi, cross the Ponte Vecchio at sunset and
return home every day to Antonella's
"Buona sera!" from the kitchen, I think I'm
beginning to feel at home.
