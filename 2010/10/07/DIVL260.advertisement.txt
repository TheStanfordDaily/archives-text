The Stanford Daily is looking for the next generation of leaders.
Every fall The Stanford Daily recruits a group of
driven Stanford students interested in business
for its Business Internship Program. These students
receive an intensive immersion into the world of ad
vertising, sales, marketing and entrepreneurship as
they are trained to fill the roles of advertising execu
tives. They are given hands-on experience, work with
departmental and local accounts and ultimately gain
a practical education in business and sales.
In addition, our interns attend training workshops with mar
keting consultants, receive direct mentorship from the COO
and VP of Sales and experience the rigor of a real company.
If you are interested in gaining a real business experi
ence before summer and making a difference in the
Stanford community, this business internship is right
for you. By joining The Daily, you are ensuring that The
Stanford Daily, one of the oldest organizations on cam
pus, continues keeping the Farm informed. Moreover,
the internship is a great way to get an interactive and
challenging entrepreneurial education.
Absolutely no prior business experience is required! We
are looking for applicants with diverse and unique
backgrounds and interests.

Begum Erdogan (begum@stanforddaily.com) and ask
for an application form.
Apply for a 2010-2011 business internship.
