## Bhutto discusses modern Pakistani issues, new book 
### DEVIN BANERJEE SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Fatima Bhutto, the granddaughter of for
mer Pakistani President and Prime Minister
Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and niece of former Prime
Minister Benazir Bhutto, spoke Wednesday
evening at the Bechtel International Center.

She discussed a wide range of issues facing her
country, most of which she has written about in
her latest book, "Songs of Blood and Sword,"
released in April.
"It was one of the last things I promised my
father," Bhutto, a poet and journalist, said of
the book. Her father, Murtaza Bhutto, a critic
of the Pakistan Peoples Party, was killed in an

encounter with police in 1996. Fatima Bhutto
was 14 years old.
"Hours before he was killed, we were sitting
and talking, and I said, 'You've had such a fasci
nating life. You have to write a book,"' Bhutto
recalled. "And he laughed and said, 'I can't write
a book about my life because they would kill me
for saying what I know. When I'm gone and

you're older, you write it.'"
Of her family and its legacy, Bhutto lamented
the failure of Pakistan to preserve the sites
where Bhuttos have been killed. At the same
time, she addressed the downsides of dynastic
political families in Pakistan, India and
Bangladesh.
"All these countries have had not just dynas
ties, but dynastic murders and dynastic assassi
nations," she said. "None of these cases have
ever actually been solved. No sites have been
preserved, except that of Indira Gandhi in New
Delhi."
Violence in Pakistan, such as the bloody war
between the army and the Taliban in Swat Valley
that raged last year, is only one of the contempo
rary issues hampering democratic peace in the
country, Bhutto said.
"There is tremendous violence in Pakistan,"
she said, "but what accompanies it is silence."
Censorship in the country, Bhutto said, is
among the worst in the world. Censorship
boards in cities across Pakistan scan newspaper
articles and radio broadcasts as frequently as
twice a day, redacting names, paragraphs and en
tire articles.
"Newspapers begin to print empty newspa
pers — essentially white newspapers," Bhutto
said. "And when they are told by the regime that
they cannot print empty newspapers, they fill
the space with pictures of donkeys and animals."
Also constraining Pakistan's democratic de
velopment, she said, are blasphemy laws,
"hudud" ordinances, which make adultery
punishable by death, and a lack of understand
ing in the foreign press about Pakistani culture
and politics.
On U.S. foreign policy toward Pakistan,
Bhutto slammed American officials who say
Pakistan does not cooperate with the U.S., and
she reaffirmed her hard-line stance against aer
ial strikes by U.S. Predator drones.
"I'm not sure, at this point, how much more
Pakistan could cooperate without becoming
the 51st state," she said, prompting several dis
agreeing audience members to raise their
hands with questions. "It has cooperated with
thousands of Pakistani lives."
Asked by an audience member if she herself
will enter Pakistani politics, Bhutto said she
would rather discontinue the line of Bhuttos in
government so as to avoid the political effects
of a dynasty.
"I think that Pakistanis have to choose be
tween democracy and dynasty," she said. "Both
cannot exist. One is inclusive and the other is
exclusive. One is participatory and one negates
participation. So I don't think it's correct to
enter politics."
