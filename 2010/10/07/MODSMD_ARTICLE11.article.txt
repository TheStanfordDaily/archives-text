## EDITORIAL Hoover Institution should renounce Hanson's racist remarks 
### 
Victor Davis Hanson Ph.D. 'BO, senior
fellow at the Hoover Institution,
blogged last week that, for a variety
of reasons, the American university is the
"the most politically intolerant and mono
lithic institution in the country." While ad
dressing his wide range of criticisms, some of
which hold merit, is beyond the scope of this
editorial, we direct your attention to a par
ticular set of complaints regarding the be
havior of various racial groups in higher ed
ucation:
"Latin Americans add an accent and a
trill and they become victimized Chicanos,"
Hanson wrote. "One-half African Ameri
cans claim they are more people of color
than much darker Punjabis; the children of
Asian optometrists seek minority and victim
status."
At the risk of stating the obvious, we
would like to point out this passage for what
it is: absolute trash. If Hanson wants to en
gage in discussion about affirmative action
or the role of race in higher education, we
would applaud that and welcome his view
point. But this sort of homogenous denigra
tion is no intellectual commentary. It is at
best vitriolic ignorance. Combining the toxic
assumption that all members of an ethnicity
group act the same way with the mocking
reference to "an accent and a trill" veers
dangerously into bigotry.
There is incredible value in examining
the current university structure in this coun
try, and race and class issues should not be ig
nored in that temperate and thoughtful dis
course. Hanson's words, tragically, not only
hinder this discussion, but deride stakehold
ers and concerned parties with callous and
shrill remarks. If he was trying to draw atten
tion to the topic, he has instead shifted the

focus onto himself.
Worse yet, Hanson's words reflect badly
on Stanford through his association with a
research center supported by this university
and housed on this campus. The editorial
board understands the Hoover Institution
cannot be held responsible for all the public
statements of its scholars, but strongly urges
the institution to repudiate or, at the very
least, review Hanson's remarks. Surely, gross
generalities couched in racially charged lan
guage cannot fit with Hoover's mission.
It is worth stressing that the Hoover Insti
tution includes preeminent scholars in a va
riety of disciplines. From Nobel Laureates to
former high-level public policy officials and
advisers, many of the foremost minds at
Stanford and other universities contribute
to Hoover's work. These professors offer se
rious academic research that adds signifi
cant value to policy discussion and to the in
tellectual community on campus.
Hanson's despicable words provide the
Hoover Institution the perfect opportunity
to clarify its role in American politics. Pur
poseful academic research or derisive, un
founded cheap shots: which will it be? The
editorial board expects and hopes that an in
stitution producing distinguished research
to inform policy debates will wholehearted
ly reject the sort of remarks Hanson made.
Thus, we issue this editorial as an open
challenge to the Hoover Institution. If you
find fault with Hanson's grossly generalizing
remarks and wish to be a leader in the dis
cussion of modern American universities,
then please: let us know.
If you do not, we hope you realize the
damage you do to this university's standing
and to the well-being of higher education in
America.
