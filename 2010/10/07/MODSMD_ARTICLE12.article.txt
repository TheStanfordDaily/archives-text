# THE 						CAMPUS BEAT
## More Guerrilla Musicians 
### Lucas Will Johnson 
In the last couple weeks in White Plaza, a
setting usually de voted to tables of people
beckoning to the passing bikers, a piano
entered the scene. Whatever its origin, it al
lowed spontaneous live music to mix with the
usual chatter. Random acts of music like this
liven up the routine and give musicians on
campus additional purpose. We need more of
it.
White Plaza has a share of musical events
throughout the year, from the occasional mu
sical guest at a community group's event to a
full-blown concert on Dink's outdoor stage.
But performances in White Plaza aren't the
most surprising acts to see and don't even
occur very often.
So I racked my memory for times outside
of White Plaza when an unexpected musical
gift lit up the area. Mostly, it seems that the
musical events on campus are scripted: con
certs, a jazz night at the CoHo, the rush of stu
dent group shows in the spring, the occasion
al band at a party or a special dinner. Per
formers prefer scheduled shows because you
can tell people to show up and expect some
amount of audience. When there is a lot of
equipment to set up, you want to make sure
the effort is worth it. But does that mean all
"performances" on campus should be
planned?
There's the case of those who live in
dorms with good rehearsal spaces they
get a taste of music occasionally. I know that
Roble listens to Calypso for four hours every
week, though I suppose the surprise and
charm can get lost in the routine.
Except I'm not quite asking for that ei
ther. If you've ever been to a decent-sized
city for long enough, you know the joy of
being interrupted by a street performer who
has something awesome to say on her trum
pet or on his buckets and trash cans. It's a
burst of expression amid the robotic func
tionality of cars and subways and cell phones.
So we should drop everything, becoming
poor street musicians struggling to make
ends meet, scraping for coins in subways by
day and scraping leftover linguine off plates
outside kitchens at night, right?
No. Stanford has to fashion its own ver
sion of spontaneous music. We're a suburban
university of overachievers with 25-hour-a
-day schedules. We'll have to find a different
way to squeeze musical whims into this dom
inant mold.
I figure that amidst all the student music
groups and closet musicians, there are thou
sands of hours of people practicing. Even if
only a few of those people and groups decid
ed to randomly, occasionally, practice in un
usual places on campus, it could open up
much of daily life to some tonal variety.
Just imagine wandering into Terman one
evening to work on a project, hearing a
French horn player practicing from the bal
cony. Or picture biking past Encina toward
the gym while an a cappella group works on

its harmonies. This kind of thing happened to
me once as I biked through the quad one
evening and heard someone playing a saxo
phone. Musicians need to practice anyway
we should do it somewhere beautiful.
The thought occurred to me to even start
a little e-mail list for these kinds of guerrilla
musicians, where they talk about cool places
to play, courtyards that resonate well, or un
expected audiences that showed up. But isn't
that too organized? Isn't the point of all this
that we create a new culture of music pop
ping up everywhere?
There are times and places where some
live music would clearly get in the way, like in
a lecture or during the conference you'd been
planning for months. Luckily, Stanford cam
pus is one of the largest in the world. I'm sure
if a handful of square footage is occupied, we
can find spots to whistle.
Bigger musical groups with cumbersome
equipment to carry should also feel free to
play gigs in busy places once in a while. Dur
ing the summer jazz workshop, lunchtimes
outside Tresidder feature some astounding
jazz pros playing a few tunes for fun.
Essentially, I'm not talking about the
LSJUMB's (predictable) traditions and your
housemate practicing on the dorm piano; I'm
saying that Stanford needs more random acts
of music around campus. Too many of us
bunker up in practice rooms to mask the
"wrong" notes. Don't keep your playing to
yourself complement the Farm's stunning
visuals with some melody. We'll applaud as
we bike by.
