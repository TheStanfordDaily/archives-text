# THIS COLUMN IS IRONIC
## Majorly Difficult 
### Shane Savitsky 
On Monday night, a rather jarring e
mail from one Harry J. Elam, Jr. hit
my inbox. The terrifying subject line
told me all I needed to know: "Attention
needed: Major Declaration." The time had
come.
You see, as a member of the Class of 2012,
I should have declared my major at some
point last year. And really, I would have
done it already if the political science de
partment didn't make it so damn difficult.
Advisor this, declaration form that why
can't I just go into Axess and say I'm a polit
ical science major? White people like myself
become political science majors because it's
"easy." We major in the humanities because
it's "easy." The bureaucratic hoops I have to
jump through to declare are making me
think I aimed too high. Maybe I should have
looked into medieval studies or archaeology
instead.
Of course, some people have to rain on my
parade. They're called techies, and they make
up approximately half of Stanford's popula
tion. Watch out for them at all costs. Don't let
them tell you that Stanford grads include the
guys who founded Hewlett Packard, Google
and Yahoo men whose combined net
worth would probably approach the "more
money than God" range.They will try to proj
ect this materialism on you. Their argument
inevitably concludes with this clincher: to
make money in this day and age, any major
with "engineering" or "science" in the name
probably isn't a bad bet.
I say, who cares? As a white person, if
you're not majoring in something semi-relat
ed to the humanities, then you're making
things too hard on yourself. Forget "engi
neering" "literature" might be the opera

tive word in the major you're looking for.
English would be a good call, too, as would
philosophy. Perhaps you're out to change the
world (at this school, who isn't?) but don't
want to piss off your parents too much. Then
major in international relations. There's
some NGO out there with your name on it, I
promise. Or maybe you're like me and think
international relations is just too much econ
(and don't forget, econ is almost math!).
Then try political science. Dr. Pangloss would
tell you it's the best of all possible worlds.
Let's just put it this way there's a major
out there for you that requires far fewer than
100 units to complete.
Simply put, the humanities and social sci
ences will always have a future as long as
white people like myself are around. We
couldn't make up our minds for months be
tween Obama and Hillary during the 2008
presidential election. How do you expect us
to decide on a cohesive and comprehensive
major in college? Granted, this is Stanford
we're talking about the land where it
seems necessary to have your four-year plan
set by the time you set foot in your freshman
dorm. Raise your hand if you heard some kid
in your IHUM section talking about how his
or her winter quarter during senior year was
going to be a total bitch. Yeah, that's what I
thought.
Four-year plans don't really work for us
white people. We're far too into the moment
to appreciate the beauty in planning ahead.
We're all a little bit like Meursault from "The
Stranger." To us, trying to control the present
is an exercise in futility in a universe devoid
of meaning. We're disconnected from the rest
of humanity and seeking out momentary
pleasures in life. (Honestly, if that doesn't ac

curately describe most of Stanford's housed
fraternity scene, then what does?) Thus, wor
rying just doesn't really cut it because white
people get more of a kick out of confusing
others by obliquely referencing Nobel Prize
winning French existentialists who have
been dead for half a century. That's why we
love the humanities so much.
Don't get me wrong: white people aren't
lazy. Our Weltanschauung that's "world
view" in German, for those of you not down
with philosophic terms just consists of
seemingly caring about the world more than
our academics. (We also like to use words
like "Weltanschauung" because it makes us
sound more worldly and cultured. Trust me,
that's a huge plus for us.) Techies, I'll bet that
you're reading this and thinking about the
endless problem set that's waiting for you
tonight. Or maybe you're considering that
ME 101 project that's staring you in the face.
Oh, did you forget about that CS assign
ment? That sucks. I bet you probably have a
midterm next week, too.
What about me, you ask? I guess I'll forge
ahead and declare myself a political science
major as planned. Then, I can just blow off
the reading for my poli sci seminar, bullshit
my history paper and catch up on some Dex
ter.
