## GSC tightens its purse strings Members also discuss Body Week, support National Coming Out Day 
### ANNA SCHUESSLER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Graduate Student Council (GSC) grappled with
a reduced budget and new ideas for fall and winter pro
gramming at its Wednesday meeting. This year, the coun
cil has more closely scrutinized student groups coming
before the council to ask for event programming funds.
At last night's meeting, the group spent several min
utes reviewing the cost of food as requested by the Shak
ing the Foundations Conference, held every year at Stan
ford Law School. Voting members ensured the program
ming would be applicable to a variety of disciplines be
fore granting the event its full request for funding.
ASSU Vice President Kelsei Wharton *l2 updated
members on recent events for undergraduates. He first
advertised the remaining events of Love Your Body
Week, which included film screenings of the documen
taries "The Souls of Black Girls" and "Do I Look Fat?" In
addition, Wharton urged attendees of the meeting to for
ward an application for the Constitutional Council to all
of their e-mail lists. The Constitutional Council has seen
lower participation on the part of graduate students in re

cent years, and both the executives and the GSC hope to
reverse that trend.
"We need you guys to send it out to your respective
lists," Wharton said. "We need it to be up and running be
cause there may be events going through the silo very
soon."
The group also discussed the process of appointing a
new law representative. After receiving 10 applications
for the position, GSC co-Chair Justin Brown proposed
two options: the group could either put the vote to an
elections committee or vote internally. Most of the group
wanted to vote internally and to hear speeches by the
candidates.
"I would want them to come in here and see a meeting
so they know what they're getting into," said Nii Okai
Addy, a fourth-year student in electrical engineering.
The meeting concluded with a vote to fund a party at
Ray's Grill in honor of National Coming Out Day, slated
for Oct. 9. Brown brought the measure before the GSC,
promoting the event as an all-inclusive gathering to rally
support for the gay and lesbian community, especially in
light of recent incidences of bullying throughout the
country.
"If you're coming to this event, you're not just coming
out as an LGBT person," Brown said. "You're coming
out to support."
