## WOUNDED WARRIORS 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After enduring a tough 3-0 loss to
California in the Pac-10 opener, the
Stanford men's soccer team (4-5-0,0-1-
0 Pac-10) has a chance to get back on
top with a road trip through the Pacific
Northwest this weekend. First up on
Friday night is a game against Washing
ton (6-3-1,0-2-0) in Seattle, followed by
a short ride down to Corvallis, Ore. to
face Oregon State (6-3-0,1-1-0) Sunday
afternoon.
Head coach Bret Simon sees the
time away from the Farm as an oppor

"It's a great chance for us to regroup
on the road," he said. "The worst thing is
to not have anyone to play, so I think we
are all looking forward to the trip. We

usually take this trip later in the fall, so
an early chance to compete with some
of our rival teams has all the guys excit

The Stanford men's soccer team heads to the Pacific northwest this weekend to take on a pair of Pac-10 foes in
Washington and Oregon State. The Cardinal will be without starting keeper Jason Dodson, who injured his shoulder
in Stanford's 3-0 loss to Cal last week. Redshirt freshman Galen Perkins will replace Dodson in goal on Friday night.

son in goal for Stanford. Dodson suf
fered a dislocated shoulder while mak
ing a save against Cal and had an MRI
Sunday that found no structural dam
age.
Freshman Drew Hutchins replaced
Dodson in goal against Cal, but redshirt
freshman Galen Perkins is slated to get
his first career start Friday night against
Washington. According to Simon, all
three backup goalies had a great week
of practice, giving the coaching staff ad
ditional confidence that Dodson's in
jury will not be a crippling blow.
While the team is disappointed
about losing its starting goalie just as he
had begun to find his groove between
the posts, as sophomore Hunter
Gorskie said, "injuries are a part of the
game. It's a shame because [Dodson]
has been at the top of his game recently,
but now the next guy just has to step up."
Perkins will have plenty of support
in front of him, including senior defend

er and captain Bobby Warshaw, who
was named yesterday as one of 10
Lowe's Senior CLASS Award finalists.
Simon was very pleased to hear the
news.
"It's a wonderful achievement," he
said. "It's great to see the respect that
the coaches and players have around
the country for him. It is very well-de
served."
Warshaw, who required stitches on
the sideline for a cut suffered against
Cal, will also have his hands full against
Oregon State's potent offense on Sun
day.
Senior forward Travis Sanchez has
scored four goals in his past five games
for the Beavers, who have yet to be shut
out in nine games this year. OSU split
this past weekend's games in southern
California, earning a tight victory
against San Diego State before falling
at UCLA 4-1.
Neither Washington nor Oregon
State will be an easy opponent, but the
players stressed that in the end, the
team has to focus on playing its game.
"Washington and Oregon State are
good teams, but it's really about us,"
Warshaw said. "Every team we play is

going to present a challenge, but if we
go out and play well and execute the
game plan, we should win. To a certain
extent, the biggest challenge is our
selves."
Gorskie, who was disappointed with
the way the team performed against
Cal, echoed Warshaw's comments.
"We have to just play our game," he
said. "We need to be aggressive like we
usually are and pay attention to detail.
The rest is going to take care of itself.
"This past game is a bit of a wake-up
call. But at the same time, it's good for
us and I'm confident that we are going
to be winning a lot of games going for
ward."
Confidence seems to be the key
word for the Cardinal, which is looking
to regain the good form that allowed it
to outscore opponents 9-1 during its re
cent four-game win streak to close non
conference play.
Kickoff against Washington is at 7
p.m. at Husky Soccer Stadium, fol
lowed by the 1 p.m. match against Ore
gon State on Sunday.

the posts, as sophomore Hunter
Gorskie said, "injuries are a part of the
game. It's a shame because [Dodson]
has been at the top of his game recently,
but now the next guy just has to step up."
Perkins will have plenty of support
in front of him, including senior defend

er and captain Bobby Warshaw, who
was named yesterday as one of 10
Lowe's Senior CLASS Award finalists.
Simon was very pleased to hear the
news.
"It's a wonderful achievement," he
said. "It's great to see the respect that
the coaches and players have around
the country for him. It is very well-de
served."
Warshaw, who required stitches on
the sideline for a cut suffered against
Cal, will also have his hands full against
Oregon State's potent offense on Sun
day.
Senior forward Travis Sanchez has
scored four goals in his past five games
for the Beavers, who have yet to be shut
out in nine games this year. OSU split
this past weekend's games in southern
California, earning a tight victory
against San Diego State before falling
at UCLA 4-1.
Neither Washington nor Oregon
State will be an easy opponent, but the
players stressed that in the end, the
team has to focus on playing its game.
"Washington and Oregon State are
good teams, but it's really about us,"
Warshaw said. "Every team we play is

going to present a challenge, but if we
go out and play well and execute the
game plan, we should win. To a certain
extent, the biggest challenge is our
selves."
Gorskie, who was disappointed with
the way the team performed against
Cal, echoed Warshaw's comments.
"We have to just play our game," he
said. "We need to be aggressive like we
usually are and pay attention to detail.
The rest is going to take care of itself.
"This past game is a bit of a wake-up
call. But at the same time, it's good for
us and I'm confident that we are going
to be winning a lot of games going for
ward."
Confidence seems to be the key
word for the Cardinal, which is looking
to regain the good form that allowed it
to outscore opponents 9-1 during its re
cent four-game win streak to close non
conference play.
Kickoff against Washington is at 7
p.m. at Husky Soccer Stadium, fol
lowed by the 1 p.m. match against Ore
gon State on Sunday.
