## WOUNDED WARRIORS 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After enduring a tough 3-0 loss to
California in the Pac-10 opener, the
Stanford men's soccer team (4-5-0,0-1-
0 Pac-10) has a chance to get back on
top with a road trip through the Pacific
Northwest this weekend. First up on
Friday night is a game against Washing
ton (6-3-1,0-2-0) in Seattle, followed by
a short ride down to Corvallis, Ore. to
face Oregon State (6-3-0,1-1-0) Sunday
afternoon.
Head coach Bret Simon sees the
time away from the Farm as an oppor
tunity to quickly get back in the win col
umn.
"It's a great chance for us to regroup
on the road," he said. "The worst thing is
to not have anyone to play, so I think we
are all looking forward to the trip. We

usually take this trip later in the fall, so
an early chance to compete with some
of our rival teams has all the guys excit
ed."
The Huskies saw their six-game win
streak evaporate this past weekend as
they dropped two tough matches to No.
16 UCLA and No. 25 San Diego State,
the latter game ending 4-3 in double
overtime.
The Cardinal's defense will be hard
pressed to stop Washington sparkplug
Brent Richards. The junior forward has
scored six goals and tallied 15 points in
just 10 games this season after garnering
Second Team All-Pac-10 honors last
year.
Richards, who led the Pac-10 in shots
last season, is expected to test whoever
replaces redshirt freshman Jason Dod-

The Stanford men's soccer team heads to the Pacific northwest this weekend to take on a pair of Pac-10 foes in
Washington and Oregon State. The Cardinal will be without starting keeper Jason Dodson, who injured his shoulder
in Stanford's 3-0 loss to Cal last week. Redshirt freshman Galen Perkins will replace Dodson in goal on Friday night.
