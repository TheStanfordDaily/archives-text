# What better way to kick off the playoffs than a no-no?
## 
### Jacob Jaffe Fields of Failure 
It's mid-afternoon on a Wednesday.
I had finally finished a barrage of
homework and my friends and I
were about to continue our usual
Xbox session. I was feeling sick, I
hadn't had a full night's sleep in a week
and I hadn't showered in... let's just say
it had been a while since I'd been proper
ly put together. Sleep, a shower and video
games were waging a war in my head for
dibs.
Yet my attention, like that of so many
sports fans around the country, became
fixated on another event Game 1 of
the Reds-Phillies series. Wait a minute,
the Reds and Phillies? I don't care about
the Reds or the Phillies. I couldn't have
told you if Wilson Valdez was the bullpen
catcher for the Reds or the starting third
baseman for the Phillies (he's the latter).
The outcome of the game would have
less impact on my life than Matt Leinart

has had on the NFL. So why postpone
improving my health, social life and ap
pearance all of which could use plenty
of work to watch two teams that mean
nothing to me play a baseball game that
wasn't even close?
The answer, as any sports fan or
Yahoo! headline scanner could readily
inform you, is that Roy Flalladay was
pitching a no-hitter. In the playoffs. In his
first career playoff start. Now as I said, I
don't have any feeling toward the Phillies.
But watching Halladay working toward
history (no one had thrown a no-hitter in
the playoffs since Don Larsen's perfecto
52 years ago) made me become the
world's biggest bandwagon Halladay
fan. I cheered every strikeout, gasped at
the few decently tough plays and got
goosebumps as the 27th out drew closer
and closer. Halladay eventually complet
ed his no-no, only the second in postsea

son history, and even while (finally)
showering afterward, all I could think
about was a 4-0 game between the
Phillies and Reds.
It takes a game like this to make you
truly appreciate just how special sports
can be. So much of watching sports has to
do with f andom and knowledge of specif
ic teams that sometimes we forget how
great sports can be without any of the
bias. Seeing a truly remarkable achieve
ment â€”you try holding the best offense
in the National League without a hit for
an entire playoff game makes you ap
preciate what sports are all about.
So Roy Halladay brought me back to
baseball. I'll admit, this year was not a
peak baseball-watching time for me.This
season, my beloved Angels looked more
like the Royals than the Angel teams
