# What better way to kick off the playoffs than a no-no?
## 
### Jacob Jaffe Fields of Failure 
It's mid-afternoon on a Wednesday.
I had finally finished a barrage of
homework and my friends and I
were about to continue our usual
Xbox session. I was feeling sick, I
hadn't had a full night's sleep in a week
and I hadn't showered in... let's just say
it had been a while since I'd been proper
ly put together. Sleep, a shower and video
games were waging a war in my head for
dibs.
Yet my attention, like that of so many
sports fans around the country, became
fixated on another event Game 1 of
the Reds-Phillies series. Wait a minute,
the Reds and Phillies? I don't care about
the Reds or the Phillies. I couldn't have
told you if Wilson Valdez was the bullpen
catcher for the Reds or the starting third
baseman for the Phillies (he's the latter).
The outcome of the game would have
less impact on my life than Matt Leinart

has had on the NFL. So why postpone
improving my health, social life and ap
pearance all of which could use plenty
of work to watch two teams that mean
nothing to me play a baseball game that
wasn't even close?
The answer, as any sports fan or
Yahoo! headline scanner could readily
inform you, is that Roy Flalladay was
pitching a no-hitter. In the playoffs. In his
first career playoff start. Now as I said, I
don't have any feeling toward the Phillies.
But watching Halladay working toward
history (no one had thrown a no-hitter in
the playoffs since Don Larsen's perfecto
52 years ago) made me become the
world's biggest bandwagon Halladay
fan. I cheered every strikeout, gasped at
the few decently tough plays and got
goosebumps as the 27th out drew closer
and closer. Halladay eventually complet
ed his no-no, only the second in postsea

son history, and even while (finally)
showering afterward, all I could think
about was a 4-0 game between the
Phillies and Reds.
It takes a game like this to make you
truly appreciate just how special sports
can be. So much of watching sports has to
do with f andom and knowledge of specif
ic teams that sometimes we forget how
great sports can be without any of the
bias. Seeing a truly remarkable achieve
ment —you try holding the best offense
in the National League without a hit for
an entire playoff game makes you ap
preciate what sports are all about.
So Roy Halladay brought me back to
baseball. I'll admit, this year was not a
peak baseball-watching time for me.This
season, my beloved Angels looked more
like the Royals than the Angel teams

that won five division titles in six years
from2oo4-2009 (the only team to do so).
As much as I'd like to say otherwise, it's
hard to care as much about a sport when
your team is not competitive and you
don't get the games on Stanford's mo
nopolized cable TV. Don't get me
wrong, I've still paid more attention to
MLB than to Meg Whitman, Jerry
Brown, Prop 19 and Inception com
bined, and I'll still be an Angels fan even
if they replace their core players with
Nyjer Morgan, Milton Bradley and
Manny Ramirez.
But this postseason gives me the
somewhat rare opportunity to watch an
entire month of playoff baseball with
out any rooting interest. Ok, so I'll still
cheer against the Yankees until the day
my doctor pulls the plug on my breath
ing machine. But I'll do my best to re
main as impartial as I can, for my own
sanity's sake.
Here, after lots of ado, are my not-en
tirely-biased division series predictions.

Let's start with the aforementioned
Phillies. Even before Halladay's best
Roy Halladay impression last night
(don't forget, he pitched a perfect game
just five months ago), the Phillies look to
have the experience (two straight trips to
the World Series), the home field and the
pitching to go deep into October again.
The Reds, meanwhile, have none of the
above (no playoff wins since 1995, a pos
sible Game 5 on the road and a starting
rotation led by an "ace" who couldn't
last two innings last night). The Phillies
should win comfortably.
The other matchup in the National
League features two teams that had
not clinched playoff spots a week ago.
The Giants have been hot of late, over
taking the Padres to win the NL West.
Meanwhile, the Braves blew their lead
in the NL East to the hard-charging
Phillies and had to get help from the
Giants and Padres to salvage the wild
card. Neither team has much playoff
experience: the Braves haven't made
the postseason since 2005 and the Gi
ants haven't since 2003. Still, the Gi
ants have home-field advantage, mo
mentum and the better pitching staff,
so they should advance.
In the American League, the Rays

were picked by many to advance to the
World Series after securing the league's
best record during the regular season.
They have more experience, home
field advantage and better pitching
overall than the Rangers, yet Cliff Lee
led a dominant effort over David Price
and the Rays yesterday to win Game 1.
Still, the rest of the Rangers' rotation
will not be able to maintain the same
level of play, and the Rays will still pull
out the series.
The final remaining series is the
Twins vs. the Yankees, and this is the
most intriguing series, at least on paper.
The Yankees have eliminated the
Twins in the ALDS three times since
2003, including last year's sweep. This
year, though, the Twins have home
field advantage over the Yankees,
something they didn't have any of the
last three times. Target Field has been a
perfect new home for the Twins, whose
53 home wins are the most in the
American League. Minnesota has its
best record since 2002, when it ad
vanced to the ALCS. Meanwhile, the
Yankees failed to win the AL East for
only the third time in the last 13 years.
The Yankees are the defending
champs and deserve to be feared at any
point. Cy Young candidate C.C.
Sabathia, MVP candidate Robinson
Cano and perennial All-Stars Derek
Jeter and Alex Rodriguez are just some
of the weapons New York can send out
against the low-payroll Twins. Howev
er, the Yankees have looked very vul
nerable at times, while the Twins just
keep on winning despite losing former
MVP Justin Morneau and shutdown
closer Joe Nathan to injuries. In a faux
upset, the Twins pull out the series in
five, despite last night's loss.
So go out and put your money on the
Reds, Braves, Rangers and Yankees. No
matter what, I won't mind.

Roy Halladay impression last night
(don't forget, he pitched a perfect game
just five months ago), the Phillies look to
have the experience (two straight trips to
the World Series), the home field and the
pitching to go deep into October again.
The Reds, meanwhile, have none of the
above (no playoff wins since 1995, a pos
sible Game 5 on the road and a starting
rotation led by an "ace" who couldn't
last two innings last night). The Phillies
should win comfortably.
The other matchup in the National
League features two teams that had
not clinched playoff spots a week ago.
The Giants have been hot of late, over
taking the Padres to win the NL West.
Meanwhile, the Braves blew their lead
in the NL East to the hard-charging
Phillies and had to get help from the
Giants and Padres to salvage the wild
card. Neither team has much playoff
experience: the Braves haven't made
the postseason since 2005 and the Gi
ants haven't since 2003. Still, the Gi
ants have home-field advantage, mo
mentum and the better pitching staff,
so they should advance.
In the American League, the Rays

were picked by many to advance to the
World Series after securing the league's
best record during the regular season.
They have more experience, home
field advantage and better pitching
overall than the Rangers, yet Cliff Lee
led a dominant effort over David Price
and the Rays yesterday to win Game 1.
Still, the rest of the Rangers' rotation
will not be able to maintain the same
level of play, and the Rays will still pull
out the series.
The final remaining series is the
Twins vs. the Yankees, and this is the
most intriguing series, at least on paper.
The Yankees have eliminated the
Twins in the ALDS three times since
2003, including last year's sweep. This
year, though, the Twins have home
field advantage over the Yankees,
something they didn't have any of the
last three times. Target Field has been a
perfect new home for the Twins, whose
53 home wins are the most in the
American League. Minnesota has its
best record since 2002, when it ad
vanced to the ALCS. Meanwhile, the
Yankees failed to win the AL East for
only the third time in the last 13 years.
The Yankees are the defending
champs and deserve to be feared at any
point. Cy Young candidate C.C.
Sabathia, MVP candidate Robinson
Cano and perennial All-Stars Derek
Jeter and Alex Rodriguez are just some
of the weapons New York can send out
against the low-payroll Twins. Howev
er, the Yankees have looked very vul
nerable at times, while the Twins just
keep on winning despite losing former
MVP Justin Morneau and shutdown
closer Joe Nathan to injuries. In a faux
upset, the Twins pull out the series in
five, despite last night's loss.
So go out and put your money on the
Reds, Braves, Rangers and Yankees. No
matter what, I won't mind.

It's mid-afternoon on a Wednesday.
I had finally finished a barrage of
homework and my friends and I
were about to continue our usual
Xbox session. I was feeling sick, I
hadn't had a full night's sleep in a week
and I hadn't showered in... let's just say
it had been a while since I'd been proper
ly put together. Sleep, a shower and video
games were waging a war in my head for
dibs.
Yet my attention, like that of so many
sports fans around the country, became
fixated on another event Game 1 of
the Reds-Phillies series. Wait a minute,
the Reds and Phillies? I don't care about
the Reds or the Phillies. I couldn't have
told you if Wilson Valdez was the bullpen
catcher for the Reds or the starting third
baseman for the Phillies (he's the latter).
The outcome of the game would have
less impact on my life than Matt Leinart

has had on the NFL. So why postpone
improving my health, social life and ap
pearance all of which could use plenty
of work to watch two teams that mean
nothing to me play a baseball game that
wasn't even close?
The answer, as any sports fan or
Yahoo! headline scanner could readily
inform you, is that Roy Flalladay was
pitching a no-hitter. In the playoffs. In his
first career playoff start. Now as I said, I
don't have any feeling toward the Phillies.
But watching Halladay working toward
history (no one had thrown a no-hitter in
the playoffs since Don Larsen's perfecto
52 years ago) made me become the
world's biggest bandwagon Halladay
fan. I cheered every strikeout, gasped at
the few decently tough plays and got
goosebumps as the 27th out drew closer
and closer. Halladay eventually complet
ed his no-no, only the second in postsea

son history, and even while (finally)
showering afterward, all I could think
about was a 4-0 game between the
Phillies and Reds.
It takes a game like this to make you
truly appreciate just how special sports
can be. So much of watching sports has to
do with f andom and knowledge of specif
ic teams that sometimes we forget how
great sports can be without any of the
bias. Seeing a truly remarkable achieve
ment —you try holding the best offense
in the National League without a hit for
an entire playoff game makes you ap
preciate what sports are all about.
So Roy Halladay brought me back to
baseball. I'll admit, this year was not a
peak baseball-watching time for me.This
season, my beloved Angels looked more
like the Royals than the Angel teams

that won five division titles in six years
from2oo4-2009 (the only team to do so).
As much as I'd like to say otherwise, it's
hard to care as much about a sport when
your team is not competitive and you
don't get the games on Stanford's mo
nopolized cable TV. Don't get me
wrong, I've still paid more attention to
MLB than to Meg Whitman, Jerry
Brown, Prop 19 and Inception com
bined, and I'll still be an Angels fan even
if they replace their core players with
Nyjer Morgan, Milton Bradley and
Manny Ramirez.
But this postseason gives me the
somewhat rare opportunity to watch an
entire month of playoff baseball with
out any rooting interest. Ok, so I'll still
cheer against the Yankees until the day
my doctor pulls the plug on my breath
ing machine. But I'll do my best to re
main as impartial as I can, for my own
sanity's sake.
Here, after lots of ado, are my not-en
tirely-biased division series predictions.
