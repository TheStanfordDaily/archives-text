## Students say 'aloha' to Hawaii field program 
### KELSEY KING 
Fourteen students this fall are studying topics as diverse as Earth
sciences, biology, environmental sciences and cultural anthropology,
marking the inaugural run of Stanford's Wrigley Field Program in
Hawaii.
The quarter-long program, funded by a donation from environ
mental philanthropist Julie Wrigley, the Earth sciences department
and the Woods Institute for the Environment, was spearheaded by
Peter Vitousek, a biology professor and a senior fellow at the Woods
Institute for the Environment.
Vitousek pushed for the establishment of a Hawaii program fol
lowing the popularity of his freshman seminar on island ecology,
which culminates in a week-long trip to Hawaii. He wanted to pro
vide students interested in Earth systems the opportunity to gain
valuable field experience.
"Field experience and field courses involve a type of education
and learning that is difficult to get on campus," Vitousek said. "Stu
dents will get a real chance to spend some time in the field, and there
are unique opportunities when you're in a place like Hawaii to bring
together data and analyze a place from multiple perspectives."
The Hawaii program was designed to be an interdisciplinary pro
gram. Participants must take three courses Earth Sciences of the
Hawaiian Islands, Ecology of the Hawaiian Islands and Heritage, En
vironment and Sovereignty in Hawaii in addition to completing
an independent research project. These courses are cross-listed in
Earth sciences, biology and anthropology, respectively.
Course topics are covered through a series of nine modules, ac
cording to Noa Lincoln, the teaching assistant for the program and a
Ph.D. student in the School of Earth Sciences. This module system al
lows a variety of professors to come in for anywhere from four to
eight days and teach in their areas of expertise.
According to Lincoln, the module system allows students to build
an interdisciplinary view of the historical interactions between peo
ple and the environment.
"The early modules are laying a foundation of the individual dis
cipline, such as ecology and geology, and how those evolved over
time," Lincoln said. "The modules slowly get more interdisciplinary,
where you then look at the interactions between those different dis
ciplines."
Participants spent the first two weeks on the Big Island of Hawaii
at Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, where students studied volca
noes, terrestrial ecology and geophysical processes.
"During our first module, we followed two lava flows from the
summit all the way down to the ocean and stopped at different sites
and learned to do botanical surveys," Lincoln said.

Students participate in the Wrigley Field Program this quarter in
Hawaii. The new program incorporates disciplines such as Earth
systems, biology and cultural anthropology.
Students are now studying com
munity ecology in Waimea, located
in the north of the Big Island, and are
staying at a house owned by the
Hawaii Preparatory Academy. After
six weeks on the Big Island, students
will go to Kauai for two weeks to
study the Grand Canyon of Waimea
and the North Shore. After Kauai,
students will return to the Big Island
to complete the course.
Both Vitousek and Lincoln agree
that Hawaii provides an ideal loca
tion for students to understand is
sues of sustainability.
"As an island, it's simpler than a
continent," Vitousek said. "Thus,
your ability to understand aspects of
the natural and human world is sig
nificantly better. The interesting
thing about island cultures is that
they sustained in isolation. They had
to figure out how to develop systems
that could subsist. Students can eval
uate and understand these process
es and get a sense of what works and
doesn't work."
Student participants in the pro
gram agree that they have already
learned a tremendous amount
through their field courses.
"It's really experiential learning
instead of conventional learning,"
said David Geeter 'll. "We've
learned so much that every day feels
like multiple days."
For most students, the most excit
ing part of the program has been the
opportunity to experience first-hand
the science they learned in class
rooms at Stanford.
"We have this tradition now
when we're in the middle of the for
est, and you can hear birds chirping,
and you're learning so much but it's
so different from sitting in a lec
ture," said Angela Hayes 'l2. "We'll
look at each other, and someone will
say, 'Hey guys, we're in class right
now.'"
