# Johnny Dawkins and I want, need you
## 
### Caroline Caselli 
Several weeks ago, as I was
wandering alone in the con
course at halftime during the
Wake Forest game, I spotted
a familiar face in the crowd.
Just feet away from me and headed in
my direction was none other than
Johnny Dawkins, the Stanford men's
basketball coach.
"Mr. Dawkins!?" I blurted out with
the kind of excitement that may or may
not have been a result of three hours of
pre-game tailgating. "Stanford basket
ball is my favorite sport!!!"
Now, it wouldn't be shocking for a
man in Dawkins's shoes a national
collegiate player of the year at Duke,
the 10th overall pick in the 1986 NBA
draft, an assistant coach under Duke
legend Coach K and now, the head
coach of Stanford's storied program
to shrug off a peon student like myself.
But he didn't. Instead,he responded
with genuine appreciation for my
words confirming my image of him
as a friendly, down-to-earth kind of guy
who I really just want to hug every time
the team is struggling and left me
with a parting message: "Come out to
the games and bring all of your friends.
We need your support."
Now, my love for Stanford basket
ball began at a time when it was easy to
be a Stanford basketball fan: that mag
ical 2003-2004 season of Josh Childress,
the shot, a 17-1 Pac-10 record and a No.
1 seed in the NCAA Tournament (fol
lowed by a heartbreaking second
round exit to Alabama that I'm still bit
ter about, but that's beside the point).
The Sixth Man section was consistently
jam-packed and notoriously loud, and
Stanford students believe it or not
camped out overnight to get into
games.
But since the departure of the
brothers Lopez, the Card has fallen on
some rough times, and most current un
dergrads haven't seen the team in the
NIT, much less the Tournament. These
days, the Sixth Man is, at best, decently

full, and at worst (read: any preseason
or Thursday night game), pathetically
empty.
However, I am an optimist, and if
the athletic department can "sell out"
5,000 (free) student tickets to the USC
game this weekend, then surely the
glory days of the early 2000s when stu
dents bled Stanford basketball (or at
least some semblance of that era) are
not so far off. And so, I have made it my
mission to convince you, my collective
friends, why you should come to Stan
ford basketball games this year. I owe it
to Johnny.
Reason 1: Our freshmen are al
legedly awesome, and our upperclass
men aren't too shabby either.
So we're coming off consecutive
ninth-place finishes in the Pac-10 and
are predicted to finish this season near
the bottom of a relatively weak confer
ence once again. Why should anyone
have hope for this season?
Meet the highly touted recruiting
class of 2010.The six-man class features
two four-star, top-100 players (Dwight
Powell and Anthony Brown) in addi
tion to four three-star players (John
Gage, Josh Huestis, Stefan Nastic and
Aaron Bright). The freshman class has
been ranked 15th in the nation by
Scout.com and just may be the best in
the Pac-10.
Some, like Powell and Brown, will
likely see significant minutes this sea
son. And while the 2014ers' impact may
not translate to a drastic turnaround
this year, the core of six has all the mak
ings of a Pac-10 contending, Tourna
ment team a couple of years down the
road.
As for the veterans, no one is ex
pected to replace the all-around domi
nance that was Landry Fields last sea
son, but our older guys are far from tal
entless. Junior Jeremy Green, a Second
Team All-Pac-10 selection who aver
aged 16.6 points per game last season,
can shoot as well as anyone when
he's hot and has proven himself as

an offensive threat against every con
ference opponent. Classmate Jarrett
Mann had moments of glory with well
executed assists (he averaged 4.3 per
game last season, second best in the
Pac), and redshirt junior Josh Owens,
who sat out last season for medical rea
sons, will hopefully return with the
same explosive play that we saw from
him two years back.
Reason 2: $35 is cheap.
Until November 15th, students can
purchase a Sixth Man membership for
the early bird price of $35. With 16 reg
ular season home games, this translates
to roughly $2.19 per game. $2.19! The
cost of courtside season tickets is the fi
nancial equivalent of forgoing one cup
of CoHo coffee a day for two weeks.
This is also far cheaper than what
students at other schools pay for bas
ketball tickets. At our East Bay coun
terpart, students have to pay $69 (hehe)
for basketball tickets, and up at Wash
ington, a cleverly named "Dawg Pack"
gives students access to football and
basketball games for sl2s.Throw in
the copious amounts of free shit that
Sixth Man thrusts upon you a
snazzy long-sleeve tee, free food galore,
Kanye glasses, Stanford washcloths,
etc. and 35 bucks is a major bargain.
Reason 3: Maples is one of the best
college gyms in the country.
Despite its relatively small seating
capacity of 7,233, Maples Pavilion has
been described as "one of the West's
most notorious pits" and "one of the
most difficult arenas in the Pac-10 con
ference for visiting opponents."
It only takes a two-minute viewing
of the aforementioned Nick Robinson
buzzer-beater clip on You Tube to un
derstand why the full student sec
tion is in-your-face loud and the echo of
the crowd is deafening. The energy evi
dent in that six-and-a-half-year-old
grainy clip still gives me chills, and I
wasn't even there.

There's not a bad seat in the house,
and this is especially true for the stu
dents the Sixth Man section spans
from baseline to baseline of the lower
section, directly across from both
teams' benches. Not only are Sixth
Man members pretty much as close to
the game as sports fans can get, stu
dents are also in prime heckling loca
tion. Though this shit-talking is often
overwhelmingly nerdy and free of ex
pletives, students year after year seem
to find unmatched delight in getting
under the skin of a poorly performing
player or simply making fun of the
night's ugly dude (Cal's Max Zhang is
a perennial favorite).
And lastly, I come to Reason 4:
Johnny Dawkins personally told me to
tell you to come out and support the
team.
Isn't that enough?
