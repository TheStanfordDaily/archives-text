# PAC-10 POWER RANKINGS
## 
### 
Every week, Jacob Jaffe will give his power rankings of the Pac-10 football programs. These
represent a measure of current success, not a prediction of future standings or a measure of
talent. Overall and conference records are in parentheses.
1. Oregon (5-0, 2-0 Pac-10) UP NEXT: at Washington State
The Ducks might very well be the best team in the country, and they are certainly the class of
the Pac-10 so far. They've been the only consistently dominant team so far, and it will take a lot
to unseat them at the top of the conference.
2. Arizona (4-0,1-0 Pac-10) UP NEXT: vs. Oregon State
The only other unbeaten Pac-10 team also has the conference's second-best win, a thriller over
Iowa. Otherwise, though, Arizona's best wins are a rout of middling Toledo and a come-from
behind squeaker over Cal at home, so the Wildcats have a lot to prove.
3. Stanford (4-1, l-l Pac-10) UP NEXT: vs. USC
The Cardinal's only blemish is a loss at Autzen, and however painful it was, Stanford remains
a BCS bowl contender. Stanford could be favored in the rest of its games, and it has a great
opportunity to bounce back Saturday against USC.
4. Oregon State (2-2, 1-0 Pac-10) UP NEXT: at Arizona
A 2-2 record covers up a quality football team in Corvallis, and the Beavers look to be a force
in the conference race. Two respectable losses to top-five teams are in the past, and no one will
want to face Oregon State in Pac-10 play.
5. Washington (2-2,1-0 Pac-10) UP NEXT: vs. Arizona State
The choice between the Huskies and UCLA was very close, but Washington's upset win was in
conference play, while a win over Texas doesn't count for as much as it might have seemed at
the time.
6. UCLA (3-2, l-l Pac-10) UP NEXT: at California
The Bruins have been two very different teams so far; a team that was humiliated at home by
Stanford and a team that humiliated Texas. The turnaround has been impressive, but UCLA also
let a horrendous Washington State team hang around into the fourth quarter, so I'm reserving
judgment.
7. USC (4-1, l-l Pac-10) UP NEXT: at Stanford
How bad can a 4-1 team be at this point in the season? Well, losing at home to a previously
beleaguered Washington team to start off Pac-10 play, combined with unconvincing wins over
subpar teams, makes the Trojans a question mark for conference play. Add to that NCAA sanc
tions preventing a bowl game, and anything goes.
8. California (2-2, 0-1 Pac-10) UP NEXT: vs. UCLA
The Golden Bears have been the opposite of UCLA so far. After outscoring UC-Davis and
Colorado 104-10 in two home games, Cal turned around and got blasted at Nevada and blew
a late lead at Arizona. It's hard to tell what Cal team will show up on any given Saturday.
9. Arizona State (2-3, 0-2 Pac-10) UP NEXT: at Washington
Three consecutive close losses to top-level teams could be the difference between missing a
bowl and being a top-25 team. Still, losses are losses, and the Sun Devils have not shown the
ability to beat an FBS team yet.
10. Washington State (1-4,0-2 Pac-10) UP NEXT: vs. Oregon
The Cougars will likely occupy the No. 10 spot until further notice, because there still appears
to be a significant gap between Wazzu and the rest of the Pac-10. Is it too early for Cougar
fans to start looking ahead to next year?
