# Liquor arrests rise in '09
## Annual safety report also records increases in rapes, bike thefts 
### IVY NGUYEN DESK EDITOR 
The Department of Public Safety
(DPS) arrested almost twice as many
people on campus for alleged liquor
law violations in 2009 as it did the previ
ous year, according to the release this
fall of the annual Stanford safety report.
Last year 113 people were arrested
on campus on suspicion of violating
possession, purchase, transportation
and other alcohol laws, compared to 62
in 2008. Those statistics do not include
the number of arrests for driving under
the influence or public drunkenness,

which is not provided in the report.
Of those arrests, 14 were made in
student residences, compared to six the
year before. And last year, 61 people
faced other types of disciplinary actions
by campus officials after alleged liquor
law violations, compared to 23 the year
before.
Reports of rape, hate-related battery
and bike thefts also were up in 2009
over the previous year, according to the
report.
The release of the report, sometimes
referred to as the "Clery report," is
mandated by the Jeanne Clery Disclo
sure of Campus Security Policy and

Crime Statistics Act. It details crime
that occurred on campus defined as
academic and research buildings, resi
dences, the Medical Center and the
Dish, on Stanford-owned or Stanford
affiliated property and on public prop
erty, such as sidewalks, contiguous to
Stanford property.
Drug Arrests
Most of the drug-related arrests last
year involved marijuana, Police Chief
Laura Wilson told the Stanford Report.
These numbers reflect an increase in
police department staff rather than an
increase in drug and alcohol use, she
added. Now that the police department

is fully staffed, more officers have been
assigned to weekend shifts.
"We changed the staffing to increase
the number of people working on
weekends because so many student
parties were being disrupted by people
who had not been invited to the party
and who were stealing from students,"
Wilson told the Report.
New Domestic Violence, Stalking Cate
gories
In response to requests from the
Stanford community, the report includ-
Ed two new categories: domestic vio
lence and stalking. Seven incidences
of alleged domestic violence, includ
ing six on campus, and two incidences
of alleged stalking, both on campus,
occurred in 2009, the report said.
Twelve alleged "forcible sexual of
fenses" were reported, including
seven in student residences. That
compared to 10 such offenses in 2008
and 12 in 2007. The report defines the
category "any sexual act directed
against another person, forcibly or
against that person's will," including
rape, sodomy, sexual assault with an
object and forcible fondling.
Of these cases, five were listed as
rapes, three in student residences,
compared to three forcible rapes in
2008 and eight in 2007.
Domestic violence and sexual as
sault tend to be underreported, Wil
son told the Stanford Report. "We
have reason to believe more sexual
offenses are taking place on campus
than are being reported to university
sources, based on the stories that stu
dents tell us," she said.
Two hate crimes were reported in
2009: one case of "hate-related bat
tery on campus" involving sexual ori

entation, the other of hateful vandal
ism involving religion. One hate
crime was reported in each of the two
previous years.

Property Crimes Down
The number of reported bike
thefts increased to 375 last year from
353 in 2008 and 297 in 2007. About
half of those reports were near stu
dent residences.
Car burglaries declined to 57 cases
in 2009 from 122 the previous year.
GPS units, laptops, purses, wallets and
backpacks reportedly were stolen
most often. Structural burglaries,
such as those that occur in residential
buildings or academic and research
buildings, were down to 151 cases last
year from 186 cases in 2008. Motor
vehicle and golf cart thefts also de
creased to 15 in 2009 from 38 in 2008
As these statistics are based on re
ported crime, they do not necessarily
reflect the number of crimes commit
ted, said DPS spokesman Bill Larson.
"It would be difficult, if not impos
sible in some cases, to explain why
there were increases or decreases in
any of the crimes noted in the Re
port," wrote Larson in an e-mail to
The Daily.
The complete report is available
on the DPS website.
