# Liquor arrests rise in '09
## Annual safety report also records increases in rapes, bike thefts 
### IVY NGUYEN DESK EDITOR 
The Department of Public Safety
(DPS) arrested almost twice as many
people on campus for alleged liquor
law violations in 2009 as it did the previ
ous year, according to the release this
fall of the annual Stanford safety report.
Last year 113 people were arrested
on campus on suspicion of violating
possession, purchase, transportation
and other alcohol laws, compared to 62
in 2008. Those statistics do not include
the number of arrests for driving under
the influence or public drunkenness,

which is not provided in the report.
Of those arrests, 14 were made in
student residences, compared to six the
year before. And last year, 61 people
faced other types of disciplinary actions
by campus officials after alleged liquor
law violations, compared to 23 the year
before.
Reports of rape, hate-related battery
and bike thefts also were up in 2009
over the previous year, according to the
report.
The release of the report, sometimes
referred to as the "Clery report," is
mandated by the Jeanne Clery Disclo
sure of Campus Security Policy and

Crime Statistics Act. It details crime
that occurred on campus defined as
academic and research buildings, resi
dences, the Medical Center and the
Dish, on Stanford-owned or Stanford
affiliated property and on public prop
erty, such as sidewalks, contiguous to
Stanford property.
Drug Arrests
Most of the drug-related arrests last
year involved marijuana, Police Chief
Laura Wilson told the Stanford Report.
These numbers reflect an increase in
police department staff rather than an
increase in drug and alcohol use, she
added. Now that the police department

is fully staffed, more officers have been
assigned to weekend shifts.
"We changed the staffing to increase
the number of people working on
weekends because so many student
parties were being disrupted by people
who had not been invited to the party
and who were stealing from students,"
Wilson told the Report.
