## Campus police sergeant arrested for DUI Put on leave while DPS runs internal investigation 
### DEVIN BANERJEE SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Sgt. Chris Cohendet, a 31-year-old mem
ber of Stanford's police force, was arrested
last week while off duty in San Mateo Coun
ty for allegedly driving under the influence
of alcohol. The Stanford Department of
Public Safety (DPS) has put him on admin
istrative leave while it conducts an internal

investigation into the circumstances of the
arrest.
Cohendet was pulled over by Millbrae
police and arrested at 1:26 a.m. on Sunday,
Sept. 26, said Millbrae Police Officer Jen
nifer McCarthy. He was taken to a county
"sobering facility" before being released
later that day, according to Irene Brunow,
Millbrae police records manager. The po
lice would not divulge Cohendet's blood
alcohol content or the car he was driving.
Conhendet joined Stanford's police
force "eight to nine years ago," said Lt. Rich
Cinfio of DPS. Cinfio said he isn't aware of
any Stanford police officer, past or present,

who has been arrested. "There has certainly
been nothing in recent years," he said.
DPS is conducting an administrative in
vestigation, separate from the criminal in
vestigation, into Cohendet's arrest. Police
Chief Laura Wilson will review the investi
gation's outcome and decide a course of ac
tion, Cinfio said.
"We are conducting a fair, impartial and
objective review of the circumstances, which
has not reached a conclusion yet," he said.
"We want to be thorough."
Cinfio would not say whether Cohen
det's administrative leave is paid or unpaid,
calling it a personnel matter.

Stanford's police chief reports to the Uni
versity's general counsel, Debra Zumwalt
J.D. "79, who said Wednesday Cohendet's
case is "an ongoing personnel matter." Jeff
Wachtel '79, senior assistant to Stanford
President John Hennessy, was unaware of
the arrest and said it was unlikely Hennessy
would know about it.
A spokeswoman for the San Mateo
County district attorney's office on
Wednesday said Cohendet is awaiting ar
raignment.
