# STUDENT LIFE
## Celebrate your body, says ASSU First-annual 'Love Your Body Week' promotes esteem 
### CELESTE NOCHE 
The ASSU executive cabinet wants the stu
dent body to celebrate students' bodies this
week with its first annual "Love Your Body
Week."
Since Monday, the event has showcased
events such as cross-cultural discussions, a
healthy eating seminar and film showings meant
to create safe environments where students can
openly discuss issues regarding body image and
how these struggles affect life at Stanford. The
main goal of this week's activities is to create
awareness and encourage support for Stanford
students particularly women who struggle
with body image issues and eating disorders.
Viviana Arcia 'l3, ASSU executive chair of
women's issues and coordinator of the week's
events, was inspired by her work with "Mirror,
Mirror," a series of monologues produced by
the Stanford Theatre Activist Mobilization Pro
ject. As assistant producer, she moderated dorm
discussions where many students voiced their
frustration with the University's perceived lack
of support for body-image issues, she said. She
has encountered similar sentiments from Uni
versity administrators.
"Most [of the administrators] saw body
image struggles as one of the most significant is
sues affecting women on campus, particularly
because it is not an issue that is openly dis
cussed," Arcia wrote in an e-mail to The Daily.
"They, too, spoke of a need that was not being
met and of a dialogue that was not being had."
According to the National Organization for
Women (NOW), more than 25 million Ameri
cans suffer from some type of binge-eating dis
order, and 86 percent of people with eating dis
orders report the onset of the illness by the time
they reach age 20. These struggles are not limit
ed to any gender, ethnicity or sexual orienta
tion.
ASSU timed the event to happen near
NOW's annual "Love Your Body Day" on Oct.
20. According to Arcia, the week also is posi
tioned to expose freshmen to the variety of psy
chological and health-related services available
to them on campus.
"We wanted to have the event early on in the
quarter to capitalize on momentum from NSO
and the general excitement of a new school
year, particularly since we are targeting fresh
men and new students who may not be educat
ed enough on the issues and who may not be fa
miliar with the many resources offered at Stan
ford," she said.
On Wednesday, more than thirty students at
tended a lunch seminar on "mindful eating" led
by psychologist Laurel Zappert of Counseling
and Psychological Services. The seminar dis
cussed eating as an "experience" that should be
savored, according to Taylor Winfield'l3, ASSU
