## The
						joy of jogging Running free on the Farm 
### STEPHANIE SARA CHONG DESK EDITOR 
Tired of going to the gym? Looking for away
to rub a little dirt on those spanking white
sneaks? The next time you're hoping to
sweat off last night's impressive helping of
Death by Chocolate, take the monotony out
of your usual routine and try out one of Stanford stu
dents' favorite off-and on-campus running spots.
LAKE LAG:
Although Lake Lagunita isn't actually a lake, that
doesn't mean it lacks the beauty of one. Encompassed
by Roble Hall, Governor's Corner and Campus
Drive, Lake Lagunita is an easy place to test your
chops in outdoor running. The circular trail measures
just under a mile, so it's doable even for those amateur
runners not yet in spandex-wearing shape. Or, if
you're feeling ambitious, run around it three, five or
even 10 times; you may or may not get too many
strange looks. The dirt and rock combo means less
stress on the knees, and overhanging trees provide
sufficient shade at any time of the day but, as Ed
ward Zhu 'l3 points out, don't forget to "look out for
low branches."
CAMPUS DRIVE LOOP:
Circumscribing the core of campus, the Campus Drive
loop is probably the most frequented running route at
Stanford. In the words of Anna Grummon 'll, it's
"standard fare," Depending on whether you choose
the inner or outer route, the path is about four miles
long, so it lacks the merry-go-round sensation of re
peatedly circling Lake Lag. The Campus Drive loop is
also a fun way to explore campus hence the name
as it passes by Palm Drive, the Medical Center,
Row Houses and more. But for those with feeble
knees, be forewarned: a good percentage of Campus
Drive has concrete pavement.

THE DISH:
The Dish has its ups and downs (pun intended). On

the one hand, its infamous hills have landed the Dish
with a reputation of "what beastly runners do," ac
cording to Rachel Rosenberg 'l3. On the other hand,
the incline undoubtedly has its advantages over the
monotony of other prairie-like trails. Hills aside, the
Dish rewards hikers and runners alike with a stunning
panoramic view of the surrounding area. Says Rosen
berg, "It gives you a feeling of where you are in the
world instead of just Stanford." Other worthwhile
components of a run around the Dish: three and a half
miles of asphalt, wildlife (watch out for scorpions!)
and the opportunity to catch up on the latest Palo Alto
middle school gossip, straight from the power-walking
soccer moms.
ARASTRADERO PRESERVE:
If the Dish doesn't satisfy your craving for a challenge,
check out the Arastradero Preserve. It's more than
four miles from the center of campus, though techni
cally still on Stanford property. The nature preserve
makes up for the long trek with its 10 miles of unpaved
trails, a number of small lakes and even the occasion
al deer or coyote sighting. Arastradero is no doubt a
captivating exploration for the curious. As Zhu de
scribes, it has "endless hills, dirt roads, [and] it's really
easy but fun to get lost."
ARRILLAGA:
Sure, a little fresh air would do us all good, but don't
forget about the gym quite yet. Sometimes, it's just
that much more convenient. Cheryl Miyake 'l3, for in
stance, rarely runs outdoors. "It gets hot and the gym
is air conditioned. I like to drink water when I run, and
I don't like holding anything in my hand," she said. If,
however, you're getting bored of the usual deal of
swiping your ID card at the front desk, walking down
the stairs into the gloomy basement and hopping on
the treadmill, next time spice things up by playing a
fun side game with your friends like tallying the
number of guys wearing cut-off shirts.
