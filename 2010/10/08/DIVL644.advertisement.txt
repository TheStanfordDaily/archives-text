0.25% APR (0.000685 daily periodic rate) for automatic transfer of payment using ACH, and 0.25% APR (0.000685 daily periodic rate) for service program discount, i.e. MAP Auto Finder, Drive Green

special loan rate or if you are in default on any loan you have with us, we may, at our option, change the rate charged on all loans pursuant to the loan agreement to the greater of the non-reduced rate in
effect when the loan was made or the non-reduced rate in effect on the date the qualifier service for each loan was terminated. When the rate increases in this fashion, it has the effect of increasing the
number of payments required to pay the balance in full. Applicants must have proof of income. All loans are subject to credit approval. All rates and terms are subject to change without prior notice.
