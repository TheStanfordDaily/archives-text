## EDITORIAL Three cheers for new Science and Engineering Quad 
### 
A number of us on the editorial board
are non-engineering majors, more
fondly known as "fuzzies." So imag
ine our surprise when we returned this fall
and noticed that a glittering white quadran
gle had sprung up near Y2E2. Our techie
friends explained that this was the new Sci
ence and Engineering Quad.
Our response: wow.
The "anchor" of the quad is the new
Huang Center, named in honor of Jen-Hsun
Huang M.S. '92, co-founder of NVIDIA. If
you haven't seen it yet, drop what you're
doing and go right now. Walk through the
courtyard under the blue California sky and
peer into the glass offices of Nobel laureates.
Curl up in a comfy red sofa and munch on a
sandwich from Ike's. (You'll never think of
sandwiches the same way again.) Ask your
self: would you rather work on your thermo
dynamics problem set in Terman or in this
stunning engineer's paradise?
The answer should be obvious. As long as
Stanford remains a residential university,
the physical spaces we occupy will affect our
productivity in material ways. After all, why
do students flock to the Bender Room dur
ing finals week? Why not head over to one of
the frats instead and crack out a book while
your friends play rounds of beer pong? We
all know the answer: because we are more
productive if the space meets our needs.
Working on CSIO7 with your friends is that
much more difficult when there aren't
enough outlets. And as any student will tell

you, ready access to sources of caffeine after
midnight is critical to surviving the quarter
system.
But magnificent buildings like the engi
neering quad go one step farther and add a
sense of wonder to this campus. Wonder, one
might claim, has no practical value and is a
waste of tuition money. But Stanford and
other top schools in the country attract the
best talent from around the country in part
because they inspire dreaming. If you are an
accomplished high school cellist, would you
practice late into the night so that one day in
the future, you could to Stanford and play on
the Dinkelspiel stage? No. Would you
dream about performing in the forthcoming
Bing Concert Hall, with its first-class
acoustics that "determined the shape of the
hall's exterior, which echoes the vineyard
configuration with a distinctive, fez-shaped
design," as the University describes it? Yes,
please.
Yet disbelievers, including some on the
editorial board, do have a point. These
spaces are an enormous investment. The
University cannot in good faith devote all its
resources to designing architectural master
pieces on a whim. There are financial aid,
professor salaries and research funding to
worry about which is why, for the first
time in our Stanford career, a few members
of this board wandered into the engineering
quad and stood for some time in front of the
list of donors. It seems even we ungrateful
youth can be moved. So thank you.
