# OH, SWEET NUTHIN'!

Yesterday, I opened a door with the rare
desire to really make an entrance. I
was en route to meet with a friend: my
audience. The gesture I yenned for belongs to
one Michael Vang 'l3, who is a self-described
"hot mess." He swings doors open and lunges
into rooms, flourishing his free hand and say
ing to his chosen audience member their
name, then a beat, then, "You are a goddess."
The word floats in the air for minutes after
ward, because how could anybody launch
into an ordinary conversation after that?
But I was having a bit of a dilemma. The
friend whom I was en route to meet was
George. Which is not a girl's name. I wasn't
about to spoil the giddy magic of the gesture
by using the inappropriate gender. But as I
stood there, poised to open the door into the
room in which he waited, I realized I just
couldn't bring myself to say the words,
"George, you are a god." They felt wrong.
At first I thought it was the meter.
I ended up walking out, blinking a bit and
then remarking on how weird this phenome
non was.

It's not like I'm religious. It's just that
"You are a god" meant something much
stronger than I wanted to communicate.
"God" is powerful, is awesome. The user im
plies his own humility. He grovels. I only feel
comfortable applying it as a direct reaction to
acts, when they are near-divine (for instance,
had George just baked delicious bagels). But
it simply is not seemly as a general comment
on a person's character. And, while I've al
ways understood that this applies to calling
someone "God," (particularly given the fact
that in our culture, many people believe in a
one-and-only), this definitely also applies to
the phrase "a god," as in one of many. It
seems like, according to the semantics of
things, all this should apply to the word "god
dess," too. But it just doesn't.
It is at about this point in my reasoning
that I started blaming the media. Ad cam
paigns for women's razors have ruined femi
nine divinity forever! And Western women
were so willing to be flattered that it was fea
sible. And the god-damned hippies. Women's
empowerment? If you call everyone a god
dess, it, of course, loses it effect.
The problem with this theory is that I
don't think it's possible for even the media to
balance the words out. Of course, across the
country, it's out of the question. Too many de
voted Masculo-Monothesists. But I want to
think, someday, in certain more secular cir
cles, if enough women objectify men for their
bodies and enough Old Spice commercials,
(or less cheeky, more manipulative versions
of them), are seen on Hulu, that it really

should be possible to bring "god" down to
"goddess" level. And I just can't imagine it
working. Which is troubling, because I can
imagine most things.
It really does come down to meter. "God"
is masculine. "God-ess" is a feminization. A
secondary one. This isn't like Emp-eror,
Emp-ress: with "god," that "-ess" is blatantly
tacked on. There is no counterpart masculine
suffix. This inequality must have preceded
the words. A quick romp through the OED
reveals that "god" derives from the Pro
toGermanic and was neuter until it started
being used to refer to the Christian God.
Never in the English-speaking world did fe
male deities pack quite the punch males did.
Somewhere in the monotheistic tradition,
they decided the one-and-only was a He, and
it stuck.
I guess this shouldn't come as a surprise.
There are probably multiple dissertations in
feminist studies on this very subject. The pa
triarchy is nothing new. But rarely have I
been more convinced of the fact that our lan
guage actually necessitates it. It almost
makes me want to tell Michael to stop calling
me a goddess.
Almost.

Theolinguistix? Theolinguistor? Comment on
the fact these are comically bad constructions at

"You are a
goddess." The word
floats in the
air for minutes
afterward.
