# SENSE AND NONSENSE
## Educating for Souls? 
### Aysha Bagchi 
About a month ago, a professor asked
me: why is it important that students
develop and cultivate internal
realms? He meant to get me to reflect on my
belief that fostering earnest, including criti
cal, self-reflection in all students should be a
paramount aim of a Stanford education.
Here goes.
To put his worry in more concrete terms,
imagine the Wall Street Journal headline:
"Stanford Says Students Must Challenge
Their Values." A skeptic might legitimately
wonder: "If a student does not want to soul
search during her time in college, isn't that
her prerogative?"
In the simplest sense, of course it is: no
soul searching happens unless we get the soul
on board. But I want to discuss why the Uni
versity should even aim to help students de
velop and cultivate internal realms.
Perhaps I should start by acknowledging
the dangerous ground I stand on in talking
about "internal realms" and "souls." What
does that even mean? The internal realm I am
referring to is our conception of self, the realm
full of feelings, reflections, hopes and values
that form our deeper identity. This deeper
identity is the springboard for all our "Whys?"
in life, the world we venture into when we ask
questions that are only for our ears.
From a student's perspective, involving this
personal realm in our education may seem
like a scary proposition. It means acknowledg
ing that we are all fallible creatures with things
to learn and room to grow. It means putting
our most precious convictions and values
precious because they are part of our identity
on the line. That is no easy prospect.
And yet, becoming vulnerable enough to
engage what we learn with who we are offers
so many rich possibilities that a reserved ed
ucation forecloses. It frees us from being

shackled to views we have, at best, only pri
vately scrutinized. It retrieves from the side
lines those central questions questions
about what we think and stand for that are
at the heart of directing our own life paths.
For good reason, a liberal education is
about engaging those personal questions
with a much wider world. As W.E.B. Du Bois
describes (and a kind professor pointed out
to me), a university is, above all, the organ of
"that fine adjustment between real life and
the growing knowledge of life." A university
education is about bringing ourselves to a
much wider table. It is not merely about
memorizing facts or regurgitating a profes
sor's arguments; it is about putting our beliefs
and values in dialogue with what our fellow
beings have to say. That is why an education
needs to involve developing and cultivating
internal realms. Deep convictions stem only
from those depths.
And aiming to develop and cultivate in
ternal realms also means, importantly, re
sponding to the fact that students have them!
I was struck this past summer by a passage in
Fernando Pessoa's "The Book of Disquiet"
in which the narrator learns that an employ
ee at his regular tobacco shop in Lisbon com
mitted suicide. With surprise, the narrator re
flects on how this man, too, was "truly a soul
capable of suffering."

Like the tobacco shop employee, students
have depths beneath the veneer. As a 2008
University Mental Health Report, the Well
ness Room and the Bystander Campaign all
suggest, many students deal with serious
mental health issues. In the dorms, identity
and existential questions are still part of the
college experience. The biggest problem with
leaving souls on the sidelines is that we are
leaving souls on the sidelines. Students still
possess the root aspiration for a holistic edu
cation, one involved in deeper desires to
flourish as individuals. The University should
respond to these desires.
So much for why I think it is important to
engage internal realms in a Stanford educa
tion. Here is why I think it is imperative:
Stanford students will one day be leaders in
places all over the world. Many will be in po
sitions of power and responsibility, as they
were on Wall Street in 2007. The University,
as it well knows, has its own responsibility to
educate students to seriously reflect on our
impact on the world.
The major hiccup is that true ethical rea
soning and responsibility are not facts that
can be memorized in a textbook; no class on
ethics or race history, no section discussion
on global warming or war or evolution can
touch my beliefs when the point, to me, is
only about getting the grade and getting
ahead. Learning involves soul-searching, ma
turing in simultaneously intellectual and per
sonal ways. If we do not assimilate what we
learn into who we are, the deepest learning
that true adjustment between real life and
the growing knowledge of life will never
have happened. In fundamental ways, our
University education will have failed.
