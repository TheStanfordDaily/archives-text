## Bike rules aren't new, say police Rumors about bike safety precautions debunked 
### MARGARET RAWSON STAFF WRITER 
Students lately may have noticed
large light-up signs around campus
proclaiming, "Helmets save brains."
Coupled with rumors last month, in
cluding a post on The Unofficial
Stanford Blog, that undercover
Stanford police officers were issuing
more bike tickets, bike safety may
seem more at the forefront of Stan
ford's streets and sidewalks.
But neither safety reminders nor
tickets are new techniques, says
Deputy Sheriff Allen James of the

Department of Public Safety (DPS).
They're simply part of Stanford's
Bike Diversion Program, which
began as an educational project be
tween DPS and Parking & Trans
portation services (P&TS) in 2008.
Through the program, bicyclists
who receive citations can attend a
bike safety presentation instead of
paying a fine or going to court.
"We've always recognized that
we do have a bicycle problem here,"
said James, who heads the program.
"Bicyclists don't obey the law."
The program formed to change
the enforcement of bicycle viola
tions from a punitive to a more edu
cational system, he said.
The classes, which teach funda
mental bike safety, are held twice a
month and are open to the public, at

tracting "a lot of people who just
want the education," James said.
Although James reports that the
number of ticketed bikers has re
mained relatively stable over the
past three years, there was a marked
increase immediately after the Di
version Program's installment.
Many police officers were more
lenient before the program's onset
because fines for a ticket, which can
reach amounts upward of $lBO,
could be expensive for college stu
dents, James said. But since the di
version program intended to in
crease bike safety education, these
same authorities have since lost
their sympathy.
A chief concern of DPS is helmet
use, or the lack thereof, which the
electronic signs aim to mitigate. The

death of Yichao Wang is a grim re
minder: the Ph.D. student died in
February after he collided with a car
on Palm Drive while he was bicy
cling without a helmet.
"We are getting more helmet
usage out there, but we still have a
long way to go," James said. "It's
strictly a cultural thing. We have to
do something to change the culture.
Right now, it's not cool."
Not all students' disregard of po
lice warnings is rooted in rebellion.
Some complain about not knowing
where to place helmets or that the
tendency to follow the flow of traffic
might make things difficult for bicy
clists who do wish to follow the rules.
"I stop at stop signs, and I obey all
traffic signals, but no one else does,"
said Sheta Chatterjee 'l4. "That's
what scares me. Trying to do the
right thing makes you end up getting
in an accident."
In fact, pedestrians, not just bicy
clists, need to be aware of their sur
roundings, said Sean Troxel 'l4, who
chooses to wear a helmet any time
he's biking between 10:00 a.m. to
3:00 p.m. what he feels are peak
traffic hours.
"Pedestrians are walking bike
problems," he added. "They don't
know what's going on."

Stanford police issued bikers around campus tickets for traffic law violations
more frequently since the 2008 debut of the Biker Diversion Program, which
educated students about road rules and encouraged them to wear helmets.
