## Card set for SoCal swing Perfection on the line in LA 
### CAROLINE CASELLI DESK EDITOR 
The No. 1 Stanford women's volleyball
team looks to remain perfect as it ventures
down to Los Angeles in what could be one of
its most challenging weekends of conference
play this season.
After dominating the Oregon schools last
weekend in Maples Pavilion, the Cardinal ladies
(13-0, 4-0 Pac-10) will face two ranked oppo
nents on their turf, No. 8 USC (13-1,2-1) on Fri
day and No. 12 UCLA (11-3,1-2) on Saturday.
"Playing on the road is definitely more dif
ficult than playing at home," said senior out
side hitter Alix Klineman. "There are so many
things to get distracted by travel, school, op
posing crowds and it definitely requires
100-percent focus. I think we were reminded of
this during our first Pac-10 road trip to Ari
zona. However, this weekend, I think every
body is really excited to play two strong teams,
and [we] are not going to let anything get in the
way of playing our best."
Currently sitting at fourth in the Pac-10, the
Trojans have risen from their No. 10 preseason
ranking to the No. 8 spot thanks to a 12-game

win streak that included big victories over
cross-town rival UCLA and No. 5 Hawaii.
After suffering a five-set defeat to the No. 9
Washington Huskies in Seattle last weekend
their first loss of the season the Trojans
will look to bounce back against the Cardinal
this Friday.
Junior outside hitter Alex Jupiter, who put
down her I,oooth career kill several weeks
back against UCLA, is second among all Pac
-10 players in service aces (0.52 per set), fourth
in points (5.48 per set) and fourth in kills (4.43
per set). Junior setter Kendall Bateman, a for
mer teammate of Klineman's at Mira Costa
High School in Manhattan Beach, leads the
conference in assists, averaging 12.1 per set.
"I played with Kendall and [freshman out
side hitter Falyn Fonoimoana] in high school,
[senior middle blocker Zoe Garrett] in club
and [senior defensive specialist/outside hitter
Geena Urango] on USA teams, so there are a
lot of familiar faces on the USC team," Kline
man said. "Just generally speaking, almost
every team in the Pac-10 has players that I
have either played with or against in high
school. It's a lot fun to compete against them at
the next level, especially having played with
these players so much in the past."
Like USC.UCLA has had a largely success
ful season thus far its only three losses to
date have been to top-10 teams and is re
turning home after a disappointing three-set
loss to the Huskies on the road last Saturday.
While the Stanford offense comes into Sat

urday's match with the clear statistical advan
tage the Cardinal currently leads the Pac-10
in kills, assists per set and average hitting per
centage the UCLA defense may slow down
its front row firepower. UCLA leads the con
ference with 16.11 digs per set as a team (Stan
ford is second with 15.3), and junior libero
Lainey Gera currently tops the individual Pac
-10 standings with 4.71 digs per set (Stanford's
senior libero Gabi Ailes is not far behind in
fourth, with 4.26 digs per set).
The Bruin offense is led by senior outside
hitter Dicey McGraw, an All-Pac-10 Honor
able Mention selection last season, who had 12
kills in the loss to Washington and is averaging
3.89 kills per set (eighth in the conference). Ju
nior middle blocker Katie Camp leads the Pac
-10 in blocking with 1.27 blocks per set.
The Cardinal has fared well against both
teams in years past, with a 53-18 edge over
USC and a 40-32 record against the Bruins.The
Card has won its last five matches against the
Trojans, but split the series with UCLA last
season, suffering a five-set defeat in Maples
Pavilion in the teams' most recent meeting.
Despite sweeping its last three opponents
and still being undefeated over a month into
the season, the Cardinal doesn't see the No. 1
ranking as an excuse to let up in either prepa
ration or matches.

"I think our team knows that being the No.l
team now guarantees us nothing at the end of
the season," Klineman said. "Every team out
there is improving every day, and for us to stay

at the top means that we have to do the same.
"Even though we have been so successful
early in the season, our coaches challenge us
every day at practice, and we are reminded
daily that there are still lots of things we need
to get better at," she added. "With this team,
getting too comfortable really isn't much of an
issue, and I've really been impressed with how
motivated everyone is."
Stanford takes on USC on Friday and
UCLA on Saturday. Both matches are set to
start at 7 p.m. in Los Angeles.

fourth, with 4.26 digs per set).
The Bruin offense is led by senior outside
hitter Dicey McGraw, an All-Pac-10 Honor
able Mention selection last season, who had 12
kills in the loss to Washington and is averaging
3.89 kills per set (eighth in the conference). Ju
nior middle blocker Katie Camp leads the Pac
-10 in blocking with 1.27 blocks per set.
The Cardinal has fared well against both
teams in years past, with a 53-18 edge over
USC and a 40-32 record against the Bruins.The
Card has won its last five matches against the
Trojans, but split the series with UCLA last
season, suffering a five-set defeat in Maples
Pavilion in the teams' most recent meeting.
Despite sweeping its last three opponents
and still being undefeated over a month into
the season, the Cardinal doesn't see the No. 1
ranking as an excuse to let up in either prepa
ration or matches.

"I think our team knows that being the No.l
team now guarantees us nothing at the end of
the season," Klineman said. "Every team out
there is improving every day, and for us to stay

at the top means that we have to do the same.
"Even though we have been so successful
early in the season, our coaches challenge us
every day at practice, and we are reminded
daily that there are still lots of things we need
to get better at," she added. "With this team,
getting too comfortable really isn't much of an
issue, and I've really been impressed with how
motivated everyone is."
Stanford takes on USC on Friday and
UCLA on Saturday. Both matches are set to
start at 7 p.m. in Los Angeles.
