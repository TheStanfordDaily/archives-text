## Men's water polo opens conference season against powerhouse USC 
### — Kabir Sawhney 
After a pair of disappointing tour
nament finishes to open its season, the
Stanford men's water polo team
opens play in the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation (MPSF) on Satur
day at home against No. 1 USC. It will
be the No. 6 Cardinal's first home con
test of the season.
Stanford (6-4,0-0 MPSF) opened
its season with two victories at the
UCI Invitational over Pomona-Pitzer
and the Redlands but turned in lack
luster performances at its last two
tournaments.
At the NorCal Invitational, hosted
by California, the Card advanced to
the semifinals but fell to fourth place
after consecutive losses to UCLA and
Cal. While Stanford hung tough in
both matches, it lost both by a com
bined four goals.
A similar fate befell Stanford at
last weekend's SoCal Invitational,
hosted by UCLA. The Card won its
first match over UC-San Diego, but
fell to UC-Santa Barbara by two goals
to end up in the consolation bracket.
While Stanford did manage to ad
vance to the fifth-place game, it fell
again to the Golden Bears, 13-9, for a
finish of sixth in the tournament. The
losses saw Stanford drop two spots in
the national rankings to its current
spot of No. 6.
With the Trojans coming to town,
Stanford has had little time to recover
after its tournament in SoCal. USC is
the defending NCAA champion and
the top team in the nation, boasting a
15-0 overall record (including a 1-0
record in MPSF play). Last season,
the Trojans edged the Cardinal both
times the two teams met, once in the
regular season and once in the MPSF
Tournament.
Stanford will rely on a trio of high
powered scorers juniors Jacob
Smith and Peter Sefton along with
senior Jeffrey Schwimer —to pro
vide the bulk of the offense against
USC. It will also need strong play
from junior goalie Brian Pingree to
help contain a powerful USC attack.
Saturday's match is scheduled to
start at 3 p.m. at Avery Aquatic Center.
