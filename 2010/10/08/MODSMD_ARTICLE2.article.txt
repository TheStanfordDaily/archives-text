# 'WHAT'S YOUR DEAL?'
## AFTER TOUGH LOSS, CARD HOSTS USC 
### JACK BLANCHAT WYNDAM MAKOWSKY 
Here's the deal.
Stanford is looking to break a
trend nearly a decade in the making.
USC is seeking revenge. Both teams
suffered devastating losses last week.
The No. 16 Cardinal (4-1,1-1 Pac-10)
and the Trojans (4-1,1-1) resume one
of the Pac-10's longest rivalries, one
that has taken on a particular tone in
recent seasons, when the two schools
converge on Stanford Stadium Satur
day night at 5 p.m.
Last November, the Cardinal em
barrassed the Trojans 55-21 in the
Coliseum, sending fans to the exits by
the end of the third quarter. But Stan
ford head coach Jim Harbaugh was
not done, as he controversially at
tempted a two-point conversion (it
failed) after taking a 27-point lead
with under seven minutes to play. The
post-game midfield conversation be
tween Harbaugh and then-USC
coach Pete Carroll spawned a brief
meme "What's your deal?" as
well as Stanford football's newest
marketing slogan.
Much has changed since then, par
ticularly for the Trojans. Carroll left,
replaced by Lane Kiffin, and USC
was hit with far-reaching sanctions
that have already led to an exodus of
talent. Stanford, meanwhile, has con
tinued its rise to the upper echelon of
the conference and, for the first time
in recent memory, will be favored
against the Trojans. It'll also be going
for its first back-to-back wins over
USC since the 2001 season.
"When Stanford played USC it
was always 'How bad is the score
going to be this year?'" said redshirt
senior cornerback Richard Sherman.
"It has changed a little bit."
But neither team is concerned
with the past. Both are looking to re
bound after losses last Saturday
Stanford was blown out in the second
half against Oregon, and USC squan
dered a late lead to Washington. The

defeats marred each squad's previ
ously perfect record. That alone, Kif
fin said, was enough fuel for this
weekend's game.
"We have so many things that we
need to correct. We let a game get
away from us that we should have
won," Kiffin said.
Indeed, this USC team is hardly
the same squad that took home three
consecutive Rose Bowls earlier this
decade. NCAA sanctions, and subse

quent transfers, have left the Trojans
with only about 70 scholarship play
ers, as opposed to the 85 allowed by
the NCAA. Harbaugh says that
USC's troubles and coaching
turnover are the least of his concerns.
"[There are] some subtle differ
ences, particularly defensively. But
they're not dramatically different.
USC has an identity, both offensively
and defensively," Harbaugh said.
"Every team is going to be different
the following year. It's a trademark of
USC to be well-coached."
The focus on preparing their teams
physically and mentally after Satur
day's losses permeated Harbaugh's
and Kiffin's attitudes on their upcom
ing match. Both noted the need to im
prove defensively: USC against the
pass, Stanford against the run. A
struggling Jake Locker tore through
the Trojans for 310 yards through the
air, while the Ducks tallied nearly 400
yards on the ground.
"We didn't tackle very well, espe
cially in the secondary," Kiffin said.
"We're not playing as fast as we'd like
to ... we're digesting the defense in
stead of playing really fast."
"It'll be a challenge this week, as it
was last week," Harbaugh said. "Last
week, we played a tremendous back,
and this week, we'll play backs that
are just as good. We have to step up to
that challenge and get ready to play
physical run defense."
Stanford must also deal with key
injuries. Its top two receivers, senior
Ryan Whalen and junior Chris
Owusu, are banged up. Whalen, who
dislocated his elbow against Wake
Forest, was adamant that he would
play this weekend, but the status of
Owusu, who was involved in a brutal
helmet-to-helmet collision against
Oregon, is still unclear. USC has also
been nicked up, but both center Kris

NOTES: Stanford and USC will both be looking
to bounce back from tough losses this week
end, against Oregon and Washington respec
tively. For the first time in almost a decade, the
Cardinal is favored to win the game against a
Trojans team that is carrying only 70 scholar
ship players. Stanford Stadium will be sold out
for the first time this season.


from a dislocated shoulder, are
expected to play.
Though the Cardinal is deep at
the receiver position, Whalen and
Owusu have often been safety
valves for redshirt sophomore
quarterback Andrew Luck, who
has thrown four interceptions in
the past two weeks. Harbaugh
maintained that his star passer
played an "outstanding" game
against Oregon, but Luck was un
able to lead Stanford to a second
half score. Still, against a USC
secondary that has not had a
tremendous amount of success
against deep and midlevel routes,
Luck will have a chance to re
spond.
To their credit, the Trojans
possess a fine young quarterback
of their own a much-improved
Matt Barkley, who is in the top 15
in passing efficiency. He presents
perhaps the first significant pass
ing threat to Vic Fangio's new de
fensive scheme.
"It's a big game, both teams
are hungry for a win," Harbaugh
said.
He emphasized that the Car
dinal has responded well to last
week's defeat.
"We probably had our best
Monday practice that we've ever
had since I've been around here,"
the fourth-year coach said. "I felt
like the attitude was good."
As for any sort of grudge
match? Both Harbaugh and Kif
fin described history as "irrele
vant."
"We're not even going to talk
about it," Kiffin said. "All that
motivation stuff, as soon as the
ball is kicked off, goes away."
Stanford will kick off against
USC at 5 p.m. on Saturday at
Stanford Stadium. The game will
be nationally televised on ABC.

Andrew Luck, above, impressed many by leading the Cardinal to a 55-21 rout over USC last season. The redshirt
sophomore will be eager to repeat the feat this weekend, epsecially after dropping a tough loss in Oregon.
