# Golf: a 'real sport' after all?
## 
### Tom Taylor 
It's no secret that I don't like golf.
I even wrote a column a year
ago arguing that it's not really a
sport. So it comes as a bit of a
surprise even to myself that
last weekend I not only showed some
interest in the happenings of the
Ryder Cup, I even watched some of it
on TV.
Where professional golf in gener
al leaves me cold, I found myself
warming to the action as it unfolded
in damp and rainy Wales because, I
think, of two differences between
this tournament and most of the
other ones I flick past while surfing
the sports channels.
The first is the "clash of civilizations"
feel of the Ryder Cup: Europe vs. the
U.S.; The Old Continent against The
New World.
Beyond the infamous Tiger Woods, I
would struggle to name any of the
world's top golfers, even after having
just watched some of them a few days
back. Most of the sports that catch
my eye on a regular basis are team
sports, and for good reason.
As a fan, I can identify with and feel
part of a team even if I might be stuck
on the couch watching from home.
Even the best players in team sports
ultimately play for the team, both for
and with fans, as one. I can be im
pressed by an individual's skills on
the PGA circuit, but there isn't that
feeling of equality and brotherhood.
Individual sportsmen play for their
own personal success and glory, not
for me.
As a citizen of Europe, it was hard
not to feel proud seeing these golfers
fighting for the Ryder Cup under the
banner of my continent. Stripped of
the distraction of prize money, the
players had nothing more to lose
than their own honor, and the honor
of the millions at home that they rep
resented. Whether I like golf or not,
they were playing for me.
So even though my understanding of
the finer points of golf is sketchy, and
even though I couldn't pick a single
one of the European golfers out of a
crowd, when the Ryder Cup comes
around, I know who's on my side, and
whose side I'm on.
The second factor motivating my in
terest was match play, the scoring
system used for the Cup.
Most professional golf tournaments
use stroke play, where players aim to
go around a course in the minimum
number of total shots. Players com
pete with a leaderboard rather than
directly with the golfer who may be
accompanying them on any particu
lar round. Match play instead pits the
player directly against the opponent
playing next to him as they both try
to win each hole by sinking the ball in
a lower number of shots.
It may be because I am a golf heretic,
but as a sports fan, I just can't get ex
cited about stroke play. I'm used to
sports where opponents clash face
to-face, where psychological and
physical battles are fought out mano
a-mano. In stroke play, the two lead
ers on any one day could be on oppo
site sides of the course.
To me, the concept would be a bit like
deciding a tennis match not by who
won the most sets, but by who won
the most points. It certainly rewards
consistency, but consistency is bor
ing.
In stroke play a golfer could come
out and play a terrible first three
holes, perhaps ending up four or five
over par, and suddenly his tourna
ment is over. In match play he could
come back from worse than that,
thrilling spectators as he battles back
into contention. The tennis analogy is
good here again: I've watched many
matches where a player has lost a set
to love, but has shown great force of
will to come back and win.
In this regard, the Ryder Cup made
sense to me. I could flick on the TV
and watch two players compete
against each for a single hole, and
that was enough to keep me watch
ing for a couple more.
It is a shame that the tournament is
only played every two years, and that
there are so few other competitions
in golf that work on the same format.
Until then, my newfound pride for
being European and my interest in
the sport will undoubtedly vanish as
I return to my diet of soccer and
motor-racing.
