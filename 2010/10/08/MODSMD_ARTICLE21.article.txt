## Stanford researchers see the head light 
### JENNY THAI CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A revolutionary treatment for men
tal illness beyond manipulating brain
chemicals may be on the horizon of
bioengineering.
Stanford researchers are working to
explore a means of controlling neural
activity using light through gene ma
nipulation to trigger muscle move
ment.
Optogenetics the technique of
using light in gene control is an
emerging tool that holds powerful po
tential for bioengineers, particularly in
the field of neuroscience. Building on
the 2002 discovery of channel
rhodopsins, light-sensitive proteins
found in green algae, the research team
engineered a bold invention: a virus
that assists in delivering the algae gene
into brain cells.
These brain cells are stimulated by
light of varying wavelengths.
"Neurons can be inhibited with red
light, while a shift to blue light can ex
cite them," said neuroscience Ph.D.
candidate Viviana Gradinaru, who is
working alongside 41 other scholars on
the research.
By exposing the cells to light of dif
ferent wavelengths, scientists can now

control which cells to "turn off' and
which cells to "turn on." One of the
weaknesses that this research address
es is the lack of precision in neural ac
tivity mapping.

Gradinaru said the Stanford team
developing optogenetic brain stimu
lators to control brain function and its
applications to psychiatric disorders.
Advances in neuroscience research
have long been limited to the technolo
gy used in neural imaging scans. Scien
tists could measure electrical signals
from individual neurons or observe the
brain as a whole using magnetic reso
nance imaging.
But before optogenetics, no tech
nology allowed researchers to look at
specific clusters or areas of neurons,
limiting current knowledge on how
neurons affected mental and neurolog
ical illnesses such as schizophrenia and
clinical depression.
This opens up exciting and new op
portunities for scientists seeking to
treat diseases that target specific types
or clusters of not only brain cells but
potentially cells in other parts of the
body as well.
"It can also be applied to all ex
citable cells, such as muscle cells, gut
cells, heart cells," Gradinaru said. "With
the opto-xr tools engineered to control

intracellular signaling pathways, there
lies the possibility of expanding that
technique to all types of body cells."
Although the field of optogenetics
is young, it has received enormous en
thusiasm from researchers all over the
world. At least 600 research university
labs have expressed interest in the tech
nology.
Karl Deisseroth, the associate pro
fessor in bioengineering and psychiatry
leading the research, seems to have no
trouble keeping up with new research
avenues. He's already published five
papers since 2007.
"A lot of people thought about [the
idea of using protein to control human
cells]he told Forbes Magazine in July.
"But nobody was crazy enough to try it.
We were."
He was unavailable for an interview
with The Daily.
There is still much work to be done
the data collected are solely based
on animal models.
"The ultimate goal is to help scien
tists speed up the investigation of ex
citable cells," Gradinaru said. "Then
we 'll be able to gain further understand
ing into diseases like Parkinson's."
