John Lennon's 70th birthday is tomorrow, so Intermission thought it was
fitting to celebrate by listing off the birthday boy's best work.

The song is ethereal in every sense of the word, from its abstract, poetic lyrics to John's
otherworldly vocals. He sings "nothing's gonna change my world," and for the brief dura
tion of the tune, we believe in his mystical universe.

John considered this one of his best. Paul and George listed it as their favorite track off "The White
Album." Its themes of sexual perversion and violence make it hands down John's darkest, most
twisted song.

The perfect antithesis to Paul's exuberant "Penny Lane," John's contemplative ode to his
childhood affected Brian Wilson so much he shelved the Peach hoys' next album because
he felt he couldn't compete. With the song's poignancy and subtle psychedelia, it's not
hard to see why.

The soothing lullaby-like track is dedicated to John's mother but spends most of its time indirectly
alluding to John's love, Yoko Ono, the "ocean child." He hardly sings more than one note the entire
song, but his gentle vocals coupled with the sparse instrumentation lend a frail loveliness to this
under-appreciated tune.

One day, John got up, sat down at his famous white piano and tapped out the serene
melody to "Imagine." It's a testament to his skill as a songwriter how easily he could
knock out the graceful, hopeful anthem.
