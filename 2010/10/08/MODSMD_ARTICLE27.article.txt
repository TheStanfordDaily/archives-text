Families, hipsters, professors
and stoners were out in full
force at the Sunday night
Arcade Fire concert at the Greek
Theatre in Berkeley.
The diverse audience
indicative of Arcade Fire's wide
appeal lent itself to great peo
ple-watching in the hours before
the show and contributed to what
has to have been one of the nicest
rock concert crowds ever experi
enced. The civility with which
people negotiated spots in the pit
was mind-blowing. It was as if the
beautiful setting of the Greek
Theatre or perhaps some trans
planted Canadian ideals (a la
Arcade Fire's homeland) chilled

out the crowd.
Or maybe it was the effects of
the ever-lingering thick cloud of
marijuana that prompted front
man Win Butler to comment, "Me
and my brother grew up in a
Mormon family, so we've never
intentionally gotten high, but we
always look forward to coming to
Berkeley as there's so much smok
ing going on, we get it second
hand Thank you guys for
that!"
The crowd warmly received
opening band Calexico, who
offered up a genre of music that
could best be described as "cow
boy rock." With one song starting
on a flamenco-inspired malague

na riff and several other songs
offering catchy Spanish chants
that the crowd diligently attempt
ed to echo, Calexico was to rock
music as TexMex is to border
food. The music felt distinctly
American but with many South
American-, Spanish- and
Mexican-inspired flourishes. The
band's lead singer successfully
engaged the crowd in some
mimetic cooing on one of the last
songs of the set, and the band
exited the stage to rapturous
applause.
Following the south-of-the
border beats, Arcade Fire opened
to the great surprise of the audi
ence with "Neighborhood #1

Tunnels." There were so many
people singing along it was dif
ficult to hear the band over the
singing crowd in the pit that I
suspect that the few absent-mind
ed attendees who did not know
the lyrics were mouthing along
anyway to go with the flow. The
steady pulse of the drum was
visually complemented by the in
rhythm falling of snowflakes on a
JumboTron behind the band that
alternated between shots of the
audience, pre-filmed footage and
multi-layered shots of the band.
The band played nearly its
entire first album "Funeral," a few
favorites from its sophomore fol
low-up "Neon Bible" and six
songs from its latest effort, "The
Suburbs." The crowd roared for
nearly every song, including the
new ones. Providing the necessary
level of spectacle, Butler surprised
the audience by climbing into the
upper limits of the audience dur
ing "We Used to Wait," and heads
were banging to the anthemic
"Rococo."
Each member of the band
was continuously switching
instruments throughout the
night. Front woman Regine
Chassagne notably sang and
twirl-danced with the attitude of
a mate rejecting or egging on a
partner during bird dance
courtship. This was only for a few
songs in the middle of the set,
though, before she switched back
to playing drums, accordion and
hurdy gurdy (a big medieval
instrument you have to spin,

But perhaps the most entertaining and
impressive person on stage was the key
board-drum-glockenspiel player whose
glockenspiel playing left most people under
the impression that he was doing a tribal
dance as he rhythmically and violently
extended his arms all the way over his head
between hitting each note. Will Butler, the
younger brother of front man Win, also
managed to beat his drum so hard that you
could clearly see specks of wood flying into
the air. After nearly depleting his drumsticks
during "Neighborhood #2 (Laika)," Will
Butler climbed up 30 feet of scaffolding on
the side of the stage only to start beating the
scaffolding with his drumsticks.
The highlight of the night, however,
came at the end of the band's encore, when
Arcade Fire played the classic and fan
favorite "Wake Up." Before starting the song,
Will Butler complained to the crowd that he
"wasn't going to jump in if they couldn't
even help one kid crowd surf." This comment

sparked a wave of crowd surfing that left
security at the show trembling in fear and
the band laughing in joy and surprise
(Arcade Fire concerts do not typically spawn
punk rock-level crowd surfing, or crowd
surfing at all for that matter). People left and
right were being launched up over the crowd
every five seconds throughout the show.
Meanwhile, those standing were powerfully
chanting the words and "ohh"s of the chorus
for all of Berkeley to hear. This lucky review
er crowd surfed in the last two minutes of
the show to just in front of the stage, where I
goofily waved at the band and, in turn, was
tossed a tambourine (from a laughing Will
Butler) which I victoriously shook until the
band closed the song and left the stage, leav
ing the audience in complete, blissful joy.
And yes, I am perhaps biased for having
the fanboy moment of the year.
