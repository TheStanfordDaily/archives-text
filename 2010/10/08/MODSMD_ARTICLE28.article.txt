The idea was simple: write
100 words, every day. Lara
Ortiz-Luis,' 11, Wyatt Roy' 11
and Chris Rurik' 11 took these sim
ple instructions and created "All of
100," a blog where contributors are
invited to post their own 100-word
works.
"100 words is just catchy
enough to be compelling without
being too kitsch," Roy said. "It's
graspable." Anyone may sign on to
the challenge, and there are no con
tent or format limits outside of the
exact 100-word requirement.
This year, the three authors
compiled their favorite daily blurbs
from the blog's first year and self
published the "All of 100" collec
tion. Its pages contain glimpses of
plays, short stories and poetry.
The authors celebrated with a
book launch Monday at La Maison
Franchise. Dim lights and friendly

chatter set the mood that night,
which was a proper introduction to
a down-to-earth reading session.
Reactions to the stories could
be heard in the midst of people
smiling, mingling and eating. The
responses were as diverse as the
blurbs themselves, which detail
covetous condiments, lost loves,
feminist fairy tales and whimsical
wordplay. A broad range of narra
tives and emotions play out in the
mini-stories, from longing to joy.
"My favorite types of pieces are
the ones that leave me ultimately
with a sense of a thought," Roy
said. "I appreciate subtlety."
One by one, the authors and
friends took to the mic Monday
night. Some pieces were what Roy
described as "no story, no plot, no
development... but a linguistic
fitzblitz, a conglomeration of
sounds that feel that they were

made for a mouth to swallow and
say." Performances of the words
included a rendition of one story as
Gandhi and another as a Miley
Cyrus-embodied Taylor Swift song,
which brought laughs.
The book release is a milestone
for the project, which was initially
started from an abstract idea of
Rurik's.
"If I were a basketball player,
I'd shoot free throws every day,"
said Rurik. "It started as a disci
pline, not as a project for me. Soon
I realized it had this great poten
tial." After he asked Ortiz-Luis and
Roy to read his work, they quickly
volunteered to join in. Each blurb
was posted on a blog, initially
shared among the three authors.
The idea became so accessible
that fellow dormmates and even

family members across the country con
tributed. Michael Brandt 'll, a frequent
writer for the blog, mentioned his surprise at
having written at all.
"Writing daily is just like running; you
have to put the miles in," Brandt said. He
pointed to his lack of background in creative
writing and focus on computer science. "An
area of my brain lit up as I wrote, one that I
didn't realize could be so active before."
Samuel Cohen-Tanugi 'l2, blurb-author
and mutual friend, agrees that the book is
hype-worthy. "The project's personal influ
ence on me has been positive," he said.
"Spend time on something you've thought
today. Put a lot or a little into it one story
isn't nerve-wracking but it adds up to a
great product. It's away to practice." When
the day comes to create a quality lengthy
work, he'll be ready for it.
"I'm terrible at routine, but it's fun to
have a concept that ties it together," Roy said.
"I turn to the blog instead of Facebook now
when I want to a moment to chill out."
Apart from a workshop already under
way with the Hume Writing Center, the
authors envision even more for the project.
They see it making its way to senior centers
and K-12 schools, believing in the breadth
and depth of stories to be told.
To those who want to try forming a
piece, Rurik advised, "Don't be afraid. Don't
censor yourself too much. Just do it. So many
people want to make it perfect or fear they're
too pretentious. Instead, it's become this
community where people inspire each other
to write."
The authors maintain that no writing
pedigree is necessary to contribute.
"It's not about how good the pieces are,
because I don't know what that means," Roy
said. "What makes me the happiest is that
people seem to connect to the idea in some
way."
