Stanford's annual "Party on the
Edge," held every October at
the Cantor Arts Center, is
debuting student art this Thursday
night. Aptly held on the "edge" of
campus north of the Oval, "Party
on the Edge" has been a Cantor tra
dition for the last 12 years, drawing
in more than 2,500 students last
fall.
The party is, at its core, a fall
open house for the pieces created
by summer and continuing winter
student-arts grant recipients.
However, the annual party also
showcases myriad student arts and
performing groups on campus.
According to Kristen Olson,
one of the organizers of the event,
an open call was held to allow as
many student groups to perform as
possible at the party. Performances
will be happening all over the
premises; students can check out a
cappella groups singing in the
Rodin Rotunda, intimate poetry
readings and singing duos upstairs
in the European gallery, interactive
artwork in the courtyard and larger
performance groups out on the
back lawn.
Students arriving at the event
will even be greeted with perform
ances in the front of Cantor for the
duration of the evening. Attendees
can expect to see many popular
student groups, including Talisman,
Mariachi Cardenal, Alliance
Streetdance, Urban Styles, the
Spoken Word Collective, Everyday

People and Catch a Fyah.
Along with the performances,
student films ranging from docu
mentaries on traditional hat-mak
ing to the life of one of Cantor's
beloved maintenance workers will
be screened. And finally, students
not interested in art can at least
stop by for some food provided by
the organic Cool Cafe at museum.
Expect hot, sugary churros.
Attendees also will be able to
preview the new exhibitions on dis
play this fall. The new "Mami
Wata" exhibition explores represen
tations of the African water spirit
through sculptures, paintings,
masks and other forms of art. Also
on display is a contemporary pho
tography exhibit on "vodoun," col
loquially known as voodoo, which
delves into the ceremonies and
practices of this religion through 25
diptychs.
For students who can only stay
for a short amount of time, the
jam-packed lineup may be daunt
ing to navigate. But don't be con
cerned with trying to hit up every
exhibit; the motivation behind the
party is to let students know "that
there are outlets for their creativi
ty," according to Olson, so atten
dees are encouraged to wander
freely, enjoy the atmosphere and
keep an open mind.
