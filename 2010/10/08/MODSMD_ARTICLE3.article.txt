NO. 16 STANFORD (4-1,1-1 PAC-10] US. USC (4-1,1-1 PAC 10]

KABIR SAWHNEY
STANFORD 35, USC 27: On paper, Stanford is a much better team than
the Trojans and should win at home with ease. However, USC will be hungry to
avenge its blowout loss to the Cardinal last year in the Coliseum, and will be eager
to play the role of spoiler with its two-year bowl ban. Stanford will nevertheless hold
off a late Trojan charge and pull this game out, as its defense bounces back from
the Oregon debacle, and Andrew Luck returns to his usual dominant form.
ZACH ZIMMERMAN
STANFORD 41, USC 23: After last week's heartbreaking loss to Oregon,
Stanford is physically and emotionally beat up. As a result, the Trojans have be
come a trendy pick to come into hostile territory and sneak away with a win. I'd
have to politely disagree. Luck and his receivers should have little to no trouble
abusing a USC secondary that needs a lot of work. Although Trojan QB Matt
Barkley has been on a hot streak of late, there is no way the Cardinal defense is
going to collapse for a second consecutive week.
JACOB JAFFE
STANFORD 45, USC 23: The Trojans are 116 th in the nation in pass de
fense. The Cardinal has Andrew Luck. Even with Stanford's top two receivers
questionable with injuries, this is a huge advantage for Stanford. Add in an angry
Cardinal team looking to bounce back and a USC team with no reason to win
other than to make up for last year's humiliation, and you end up with another com
fortable Stanford victory. The Cardinal proves that the second half against Oregon
was anything but the norm and pulls away early against the unproven Trojans.
