## Meet the student artists: 
### 
Sophi Newman
Sophi Newman chose to pro
duce a series of photographs she
says were "inspired by imagery
from a theology book published
in 1903," which she found as she
was taking out the recycling in
the photo lab where she works.
She printed these images on the
actual pages of the book using a
process called type cyan. Her
intention was to explore the rela
tionship between images and
texts, especially the underlying
sub-text of images themselves.
Jimmy Chion and Jason Chua
Jimmy Chion recently gradu
ated from Stanford with a bache
lor's in psychology and is now
receiving his master's in mechani
cal engineering. Jason Chua is a
senior from Chicago majoring in
product design. With their arts
grant, Chua and Chion collabo
rated on a "Visual Windchime."
This interactive piece of art con
sists of hanging panels of light
that twinkle when students run
their hands through them. Their
motivations for this project were,
according to Jason, to create an
"interactive, gratifying and
delightful experience" that evokes
"fireflies on a warm sunny day."
Jin Zhu
Senior Jin Zhu began pursu
ing photography seriously after
making sound for films at the
Expression College for the Digital
Arts. Her project, "Water in the
West," explores the use of water
in California and the American
Southwest and the conflicts that
arise when deciding how to allo
cate this precious resource. She
questions how we use our water,
who has water and who does not
and the consequences of taking
this water. She drew her inspira
tion from long drives through the
deserts of California's Central
Valley.
Nabila Abdallah
Nabila Abdallah 'l3, an
Indian-American raised in
Tanzania, created five works she
calls "spiritual struggle" that were
partially inspired by her experi
ence in Structured Liberal
Education (SLE) during her
freshman year. She says she
approaches art as a spiritual
process, and her pieces address
her own inner conflict over iden
tity. She drew from texts like St.

Augustine's "Confessions,"
Homer's "Odyssey" and "The
Aeneid."
Santhi Elayaperumal
Elayaperumal is a Ph.D. can
didate in mechanical engineering
with a concentration in design
methodology and robotics. Her
research focuses on medical
robotics and sensors for MRl
compatible devices. Elayaperumal
created the "Krotoscope," a device
that lets students control musical
elements with their minds. This is
done through monitoring levels
of attention and mediation in
students through a wireless EEG
that then controls the music cre
ated by the Krotoscope. The
Krotoscope is also an expansion
on a brain-noise machine
debuted at the SOCA's "An Art
Affair" in April. Santhi collabo
rated with other mechanical engi
neering doctoral students on this
project: Greg Kress, Joel Sadler
and Jakob Wallsten.
