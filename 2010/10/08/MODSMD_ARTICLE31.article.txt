Standing on Treasure Island in the mid
dle of the unforgiving San Francisco
Bay, the sensible individual should
immediately question his or her motives for
ever making that turn off the Bay Bridge.
With the wind swirling and fog engulfing
everything and anything, Treasure Island is
the last place you'd want to be in the heart of
Bay Area autumn.
That is, unless you're accompanied by
thousands of others, dancing the night away
with LCD Soundsystem or screaming their
lungs out with The National.
In a week, San Francisco welcomes the
fourth reincarnation of Treasure Island Music
Festival. The only redeeming quality of the
man-made bay blemish, the two-day audio
orgy features the trademark polar lineup, with
electro-enthusiasts drooling over Saturday
and the reflective indie types embracing a
mellow Sunday.
Yet whatever fits your fancy, there is
something for everyone here, guaranteed.
And it's damn well worth braving the cold,
shady surroundings and, for those caught in
the thick of school, midterms.
In four years, TIMF has evolved from an
eclectic experiment to a bona fide Bay Area
attraction. Capitalizing on the music festival
craze, California concert conglomerate
Another Planet Entertainment and Noise Pop
have attracted arguably the most diverse line
up yet, mashing together 26 artists that will

shake the island for the weekend.
And the best part of it all? You'll be able
to catch them all technically. With no set
overlap, TIMF is unique in that you'll have
time to catch each and every performance if
your little heart desires. Of course to do so,
you'll have to avoid the art exhibits, free hair
cuts, giant Ferris Wheels and other promo
tional distractions that will provide for some
hard decisions come the weekend. "Hurry,
Four Tet's starting, oh wait, FREE T-SHIRTS."
Barring free goodies, there is little to get
in your way besides other crowd members
if you're there for the music. Saturday, a
day for synths and laptops, features dance
saviors LCD Soundsystem, fresh off stops at
Coachella and Bonnaroo and on their second
tour in support of their newest album "This
Is Happening." Preceding James Murphy and
Co. are pop upstarts Miike Snow and every
one's favorite half mascot, half DJ,
Deadmaus.
And Saturday isn't all about the headlin
ers, as a solid midday congestion of!!! (pro
nounced "chk chk chk"), Phantogram,
Jamaica and Holy Fuck will take you from the
extremes of chill electronica to feet-shuffling
dance punk. Also sandwiched in there are
South African freak rap group Die Antwoord,
whose growing cult following, lyrical stylings
and fresh "zeff" make them a must-see.
Keeping with tradition, Sunday remains
the de facto indie day a day where you can

chill in the grass and recover from staring at
the strobe light during Deadmaus the night
before. Cutesy Belle and Sebastian the
band with the duo name that really isn't a
duo headline the day, whereas the real
male and female duo, M. Ward's and Zooey
Deschanel's She & Him play earlier in the day.
Also making appearances are hometown
heroes Rogue Wave, Canadian favorites
Broken Social Scene and one Brooklyn band
that's finally getting its due: The National.
Sunday is a day for buzz bands, as Ra Ra
Riot and Surfer Blood make their first festival
appearances, as well as one for seasoned vets
with Superchunk and The Sea and Cake.
With a supreme lineup and a schedule
that allows for maximum audio enjoyment,
TIMF 2010 is well worth the price of admis
sion tickets are still on sale for $l2O a pop.
Arrive early so you can take the free shuttle
from Giants' stadium, pack your lunch and
dress in plenty of layers. San Francisco falls
can be unsympathetic, even if there's music to
keep your ears warm.
