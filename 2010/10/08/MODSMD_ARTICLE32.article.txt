Even though the cold has just set in, it's once again
sundresses and sandals time in the fashion world.
The four major Spring/Summer 2011 fashion weeks
New York, London, Milan and Paris came to a close
this Wednesday in the gardens of the Palais-Royal.
Generally, spring shows are disappointing because
one can only do chiffon and short dresses in so many
incarnations before it becomes tedious. But although
spring fashion poses challenges for the avant-garde,
some genius managed to shine through this fashion
month. In sum, some well-proven designers spent this
season riffing on their signature, others not quite at that
level used this collection to solidify their aesthetic and
one new designer gave a stunning breakout perform
ance.

Rodarte (New York)
The Mulleavy Sisters, center of the Jason Schwartzman-
Kirsten Dunst cool kid clique, are known for their oddly
haunting, disheveled, multimedia layering aesthetic of the
past two seasons. However, this time around the NorCal
natives found their inspiration in their childhood, creating a
collection in the colors and textures of 70s suburbia and the
redwoods. This definite palate of suburban interiors allowed
them to refine their layering using the structure of the wood
prints and Ming vase embroidery to simplify the impact.
Cut-out shoulders and peek-a-boo navels paired with
vaguely 60s silhouettes allowed their quirkiness to be
refined to creative acuity. We always knew they had the
ingenuity, but the clarity of vision and maturity showcased
this September truly solidifies their status as design power
houses.

Mary Katrantzou (London)
The London-based designer delivered an
unbelievable collection for her first stand-alone
show. She found her inspiration to be 70s
Helmut Lang photos in which the room had
just as much of an impact as the model. From
there, she jumped into architectural digest and
produced a graphic miracle. Katrantzou took
surreal prints of interiors and fitted them to
perfect silhouettes, designing in three dimen
sions. Her use of depth in the perspective prints
in harmony with the female form is incredible.
A print of a windowsill extends into a flowing
chiffon skirt, and wall moldings became neck
laces. This is truly the breakout performance of
the season.

Prada (Milan)
Miuccia Prada is a veteran designer rock star,
famous for her twisty and perverse genius that is
always immaculately executed. This season she
departed from her "Mad Men"-influenced fall and
channeled the bizarre conflagration of )azz Age
icon Josephine Baker with the concept of uni
forms and baroque cherubs. Her crazy brilliance
distilled all that into bold, simple and obvious.
She marched intense monochrome ensembles,
unadorned silhouettes, banana prints, wide hori
zontal stripes, graphic snakes and cherubs one
after another, two or three at a time. Listen to
Miuccia: "It's time to be bold."

Lanvin (Paris)
Every woman loves Alber Elbaz, and he loves her right back. Ele
has that uncanny ability to know exactly what women want. Elbaz
designs for everyday women, granted impossibly chic and glamorous
ones, of course. This week he focused on skin, imperfections and all.
The collection featured gorgeous second skin dresses with huge bil
lowing floor-length skirts offset by leather harnesses and big, exposed
zippers. Elbaz, he knows what he's doing.

Haider Ackermann (Paris)
The Colombian-born, Belgian
trained designer is poised on the edge
of international fame. This collection
was silk pajamas gone evening-wear.
Ackermann managed the perfect bal
ance in each gown between elegant and
sordid. The models dazzled in languid
floor-length gowns in rich colors, miss
ing entire bodices that revealed navels,
daring slits at the hip and almost uni
formly bare backs. This collection
achieved the impossible: effortlessly
sexy, dramatic and tasteful. Of all the
collections, these are the dresses I want
to wear right now.

6

Alexander McQueen (Paris)
This spring marks the first collection after Lee McQueen's untimely death. His long-time
right-hand woman, Sarah Burton, made her debut as sole creative director this October, with
huge and somber footsteps to fill. The concept was inspired by an exquisitely McQueen kind of
Mother Earth, and the show did not disappoint. The pieces were immaculate and showcased
the artfully exaggerated silhouettes essential to the McQueen aesthetic. However, the show
manship and darkness that were his signature were replaced by a bare floor with grass coming
up through the cracks in a markedly optimistic tone. Burton did an incredible job of main
taining the excellence and drama of the line, particularly with a dress blooming butterflies and
a gown with a golden corn bodice erupting with pheasant feathers. I cannot wait to see how
she continues to evolve with the house.

Louis Vuitton (Paris)
Marc Jacobs loves his self-aware kitsch. Last
spring, it was afros and clogs with mustaches, and this
time around, it's a 40s Asian circus on acid. Goodbye
lady-like luxury of the fall collection, hello camp. The
show was fitted with huge stuffed tigers, red velvet
curtains, heels in the shape of giraffe hoofs, sequined
pandas and some very suggestively placed tassels.
Cheongsam dresses were rendered sparkly and see
through or bedazzled with neon zebra print. It was
ridiculous, but also fantastic. The humor in the
revered house of luxury was refreshing; after all,
according to Marc Jacobs, "Taste is subjective."

Miu Miu (Paris)

Miucca Prada strikes again. While Prada is her day job, Miu
Miu is her playground, and her "younger" line never fails to serve
as a twisty commentary on youth. After the widely held "it" show
of Lolitas and kitty cat prints for Spring/Summer 2010, the whole
fashion world awaited this show with huge expectations. Of
course, Miuccia delivered the final show of the season, closing
fashion month with a clean, well-articulated piece of art. The con
cept: little girls who want to be famous. Firmly seated in multi
chronic pop culture, the show was placed to the soundtrack of
screaming tweens and Simon Cowell blathering. References to
Elvis, Ziggy Stardust and everything in between were sent through
the Miuccia machine and delivered on neat little 60s dresses, pleat
ed and knee grazing. The accoutrements of fame were distorted
and layered on each other so intricately that it became something
modern, as it was disturbingly presented on a stark black runway.
Miuccia, she's got it.
