Remember "American Idol" season seven
cutie David Archuleta (AKA "Archie")?
Hint: he's the David that didn't win.
Well, it's been almost three years since
Archuleta's near miss with superstardom, and
he's proven that he doesn't need a coveted title
to cement his place in the music industry. Just
this week, Archuleta released his long-antici
pated second album (if you don't count his
Christmas CD, that is). Entitled "The Other
Side of Down," this album is a charming
throwback to the 90s, and a tribute to pop in
its purest form.
Contrary to his self-titled album "David
Archuleta," which the ex-"Idol" contestant was
forced to produce within months of his stint
on the show, "The Other Side of Down" took
over a year to make. The extra time appears to
have been well spent, as almost all of these new
tracks were written by Archie himself, and the
album as a whole displays a new level of musi
cal confidence that was not present on the first
release. Archuleta's silky voice sparkles on the
up-tempo tracks and shines on the album's
ballads, making for very pleasant and easy lis
tening.
Don't let the poppy nature of the album
fool you, though this kid's got serious tal
ent. In a musical niche currently defined by
artists such as Justin Bieber, Miley Cyrus and
the Jonas Brothers, it is wonderfully refreshing
to hear a voice soar above the noise. If there is
one thing that sets Archuleta apart from other
artists his age, it is his unfaltering ability to
truly sing any song he chooses to perform.
Forget auto-tune, rap interludes and over-pro
duced beats all Archuleta really needs to sell
his music is his angelic voice.
Take the album's first ballad, "Falling

Stars," for example. The melody is lovely in its
simplicity and the lyrics suitably sappy, but it is
Archuleta's gorgeous falsetto and flawless runs
that lend the song its true charm. Archuleta's
smooth sound is also audible in the album's
title track, "The Other Side of Down." The
optimistic vibe of the song is complemented
by its catchy beat and Archuleta's crisp tone.
The following track, "Something 'Bout Love,"
which is rumored to be the album's first single,
is equally catchy and also flaunts an infectious
chorus and lyrics that are sure to make you
smile. "Elevator" is the most lyrically driven
song of the lot, painting a picture of
Archuleta's battle with indecision and his new
found confidence. If you're looking for a song
to get stuck in your head, skip to the next
track, "Stomping the Roses," which will have
you singing along before the song has even fin
ished its first play.
Later in the album, "Parachutes and
Airplanes" and "Look Around" go back to the
basics of pop, with their sunny melodies and
light rhythms. "Complain" and "Things Are
Gonna Get Better" round off the album with
their winding melodies and inspirational mes
sages. Finally, the closing track, "My Kind of
Perfect," finds Archuleta singing about his
search for love and is sure to have girls every
where melting in their shoes.
While "The Other Side of Down" is not
the most inventive pop record ever made, it is
a high-quality, aesthetically appealing release
that is guaranteed to put you in a great mood.
After all, between Archuleta's velvet voice and
adorable face, who wouldn't crack a smile?
