The year 2009 was a great one for Kings
of Leon. They were on the cover of
every leading music publication,
played every major music festival and were
lauded as the Next Big Thing in the history of
rock. 2010 may prove a bit more challenging.
"Come Around Sundown," their fifth album,
has a reputation seven years in the making
and, unfortunately, it does not live up to it.
Although the band could anticipate a pat on
the back for its courage to branch out and
experiment, the whole album comes off as an
effort poorly achieved.
"The End" comes at the beginning.
Starting off with a sparse drum and bass line,
the song catches on with a distorted tremolo
guitar and Caleb Followill's wonderfully
hoarse voice. With a mid-tempo rhythm and
little, if any, feeling embedded in the vocals,
the track feels like a warm-up for the typical
AOR (arena-oriented rock) that Kings of
Leon are known and loved for. Next!
The swiff tremolo guitars on
"Radioactive" take off the second the track
comes on, and it is impossible to ignore the
energy mounting in them. The typical Kings
of Leon power song, and the most obvious
choice for first single, the track features high
speed guitar lines and an incredibly powerful
bass courtesy of Jared Followill. "Radioactive"
is hands down the gem of this album.
Then, a few songs in, comes the ultimate
cliche: "Mary." It sounds like a cross between
"Oh! Darling" by The Beatles and an
Aerosmith tune. There's entirely too much
sugary cooing going on in the background for
this track to be taken seriously. A larger-than
life guitar solo and some misplaced whoops
by Caleb Followill bring the whole distasteful

affair to an end.
Thankfully, "The Face" comes on and
helps remind the listener why Kings of Leon
rocked the past two years since their main
stream breakthrough. A beautiful song with
moving lyrics about home (Tennessee for
KOL), the track feels more like a ballad, with
its slowly reverberating guitar riffs and cym
bal-heavy drum lines, than any other song off
the album. What makes it so enjoyable is that
it sounds honest: the band is not trying to be
groundbreaking, but to play the music it
plays best.
The theme of home is further fleshed out
in "Back Down South,"a country ballad if
there ever was one. It starts off with a fiddle,
what sounds like slide guitar but probably
isn't and Caleb Followill's voice accessorized
with a southern drawl. While the music is
unoriginal, the song is not displeasing. On
the other hand, "Beach Side," another
Americana-influenced track, is difficult to lis
ten to.
A post-worldwide fame album can't be
easy to write. Once a band has lived on the
road for more than a year, it's understandable
that its roots play a big part in its ensuing
record. In fact, country influences are not the
problem of this album they are the
strength. The weakness of the album comes
in the layering of its sound with mediocre
pop. Thankfully, "Pickup Truck," the final
track, features none of this. As a piano chimes
away in the background, bleary guitars in the
verses fizzle out, and the drumming dies soft
ly away. Let's hope Kings of Leon do neither.
