"The Wrong Blood," by
Manuel de Lope, is the much
anticipated English translation of
"La Sangre Ajena," first published
in 2000. It tells the story of two
Basque women brought together by
personal tragedy at the outset of
the Spanish Civil War; Isabel
Cruces Hernandez, the lovely wife
of a young army captain, is wid
owed, and Maria Antonia Etxarri,
an innkeeper's teenaged daughter,
is raped. Both women are pregnant
and desperately alone in uncertain
and dangerous times. They turn to
each other, despite their differences,
and make a pact. The only witness
to it is the local doctor, Felix
Castro, who delivers Isabel's daugh
ter.
This story dovetails seamlessly
with that of Miguel Goitia, Isabel's
grandson, who spends his summer
studying for the bar exam at Las

Cruces, the country inn which was
once his grandmother's estate and
which is now owned and operated
by Maria. Despite his unassuming
and scholarly nature, his presence
awakens in Maria and her neigh
bor, Dr. Castro, the memory of
long-kept secrets things they
know about Miguel that he himself
does not. As they get to know him,
they agonize over the decision to
tell him the truth whether he
would benefit from knowing and
whether anything would be gained
in the telling.
"The Wrong Blood," despite
the inevitable weaknesses of trans
lation, is full of lush, poetic prose
which paints the story in a distinc
tively Spanish tint. Its pacing is
leisurely verging on lethargy
but never quite tipping the scale
between sluggishness and unhur
ried appreciation for the roses (of

which, the author is careful to note,
there is an astounding variety in
Basque). The structure of the novel,
which is written in four parts,
interweaves scenes from Miguel's
lifetime and that of his grandmoth
er through flashbacks vaguely remi
niscent of the recent bestseller
"Hotel on the Corner of Bitter and
Sweet." The author drops hints, ele
gant but at times rather obvious,
about the mystery at the heart of
the novel; by the end, the answer
comes as no surprise, but rather
with a sense of satisfaction at the
neat conclusion to the story.
The major failing of this novel
(and being a story of such com
plexity, that it has just one signifi
cant flaw is no mean feat) lies in its
inadequacy in handling some of
the distinctly feminine themes. This
point is especially problematic con
sidering that it is for the most part

a story of two women. It is, for
example, painfully obvious that the
rape scene was written by a male
author who tries very hard to be
sensitive he, in no uncertain
terms, condemns the act and the
trauma that results but ends up
missing the mark, with passive
prose and tritely indignant airs.
Manuel de Lope, in this trans
lation of "The Wrong Blood," fol
lows in the footsteps of other emi
nent Spanish-language writers in
producing grand but poignant
works encompassing life, love and
tragedy. He is no Marquez, but who
is? At least he comes quite close.
