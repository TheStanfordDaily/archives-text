## Exploring 'The Art of Dislocation' 
### â€” alex FIALHO contact alex: afialho@stanford. edu 
By now, most observant mem
bers of the Stanford commu
nity will have noticed the
advertising flyer for artist Faisal
Abdu'Allah's on-campus exhibition.
Against a white background, the
advertisement depicts a figure
standing in profile, gazing down the
barrel of a gun pointed directly out
into the space of the viewer.
Unsettling to the point of alarm, the
flyer announces Abdu'Allah's exhi
bition "The Art of Dislocation."
And dislocation is definitely the
operative word here. One cannot
escape the feeling that the urban
violence and gang culture that the
flyer signifies could not be farther
removed from the reality of our
pristine, suburban campus. Yet it is
this sense of dislocation, this out
of-context quality, which makes
"The Art of Dislocation" particular
ly provocative and exciting to see
here at Stanford.
"The Art of Dislocation"
opened on Sept. 28 in the Thomas
Welton Art Gallery, the on-campus
art gallery adjacent to the History
Corner. As a retrospective of
Abdu'Allah's career, the exhibition
features work produced by the artist
over the last 20 years and is the
most comprehensive display of his
work to date. Stanford represents
the first of three stops for this inter
nationally touring exhibition, which
will continue to the Frost Art
Museum in Miami before conclud
ing in the United Kingdom. For the
London-based Abdu'Allah, the U.K.
exhibition will be a return home, as
the artist himself has been dislocat
ed for the quarter to teach as
Stanford's Artist-In-Residence. In
fact, as the exhibition catalog states,
this show is the first of a black
British artist on Stanford's campus.
As such, "The Art of Dislocation"
makes up for lost time in the strong
statements on race, masculinity and
community that the exhibition rep
resents.
Upon entering the gallery's
lobby, one gets the impression that
the confrontational flyer that
solicited entrance into the exhibi
tion was simply the tip of the ice
berg in terms of the charged quality
of Abdu'Allah's work. The viewer is
"greeted" by "Goldfingers" (2007),
which consists of a gold-plated pis
tol and knuckleduster displayed
under a vitrine typical of museum
display. One cannot deny the beauty

of these golden objects, but the per
nicious consequences that the
weapons index are equally impossi
ble to ignore. As such, these objects
epitomize preciousness at a price.
In a similar manner through
out the exhibition, Abdu'Allah mas
terfully aligns a formal beauty of
alluring surfaces and materials with
highly charged content addressing
questions of race, religion, violence
and their intersection.
In large part because of the
expectation garnered by the publici
ty flyer, upon entering the larger
gallery space, my attention was
immediately directed toward
Abdu'Allah's "I Wanna Kill Sam
'Cause He Ain't My Motherfucking
Uncle" (1993). Running the entire
length of the right gallery wall, the
work consists of five separate alu
minum prints, beautifully spotlit
from above, each depicting a life
size black man dressed in stereotyp
ically gang-related clothing. The fig
ure from the flyer is here, pointing
his gun from the middle of the
composition while flanked on both
sides by four equally threatening
figures carrying a gun, baseball bat
or knife or, in the case of one of
the figures, all three.
Further, though the title refer

ences the rapper Ice Cube's song "I
Wanna Kill Sam," the central figure
additionally calls to mind the famil
iar iconography of Uncle Sam
posters. However, Abdu'Allah turns
this reference point on its head. In
contrast to a pointing symbol of
patriotism, the pointing gun of the
work's central figure indicts and
implicates both the viewer and "The
Man."
This sense of skepticism in
relation to traditional systems of
power and "justice" is also reflected

in the earliest of the works on dis
play here, Abdu'Allah's 1991"Fuck
da Police." In this work, the repeat
ed phrase "fuck da police" cascades
down the surface of the print, a
chorus of obscenities etched atop
an image of an isolated black man.
Through both text and image, the
work mines the feelings of alien
ation and disenfranchisement expe
rienced by the black community

following the infamous L.A. police
brutality against Rodney King.
In continuing around the
gallery, two of Abdu'Allah's photo
graphic series take up religious
themes as their focus, "Last Supper"
(1996) and "Revelations" (1996). In
the latter, five photographic por
traits place the viewer uncomfort
