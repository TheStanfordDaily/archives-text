# FIFA '11 gets technical

If you're like me, you were thrilled earlier
this year to see even casual sports fans
following America in the World Cup. It
may be a few more years before the United

States will be as
excited for even
an everyday
soccer match,
but at least in the
meantime, we can
imagine our team,
or any other, going
all the way in FIFA
Soccer 'll.
The great
est feature of I
any FIFA
game, and per-

haps its most distinctive, is the staggering
amount of depth and customizability it
offers. Teams from every corner of the globe
are well-represented, complete with accurate
rosters, jerseys and, in many cases, their
home stadiums. The career mode this year is
more involved than ever, including options to

sign and trade players, change lineups
and strategies, assign new captains
and more. Virtual Pro mode, away
to create a custom player to carry
through a career, also makes a wel
come comeback. Without discussing
£ll r tvin/Ha id

every mode ad
nauseam, suf
fice it to say
that FIFA does
an

admirable
job of
creating
almost
any sit-

uation that a would-be soccer player (or
manager) could dream up.
This ambition extends to the game play
side of things. FIFA 'll offers mostly smooth
controls with a lot of fidelity, but this comes
at a bit of a price: for each of the myriad lit
tle tricks that the game allows players to per
form, there's another button combination to
learn. I can't knock the game for including
advanced techniques like body feints and
reverse step-overs, but the methods of exe
cuting them aren't always intuitive or respon
sive, and at the default difficulty level, the
game seems to expect them from the player a
little too often. It's rather telling that EA
included a series of tutorial videos, which
(along with a practice mode, interactive load
ing screens and a robust replay feature) help
expose you to some of the more subtle tech
niques that can make you successful. It's just
a bit of a shame that these instructions aren't
more interactive or hands-on, given the stag
gering amount of moves that players can per
form in FIFA. All this means is that despite
the wide audience the game is targeted for,
some less experienced gamers might find
themselves spending more time contemplat
ing the chunk of plastic in their hands than
the action on screen.

Luckiiy, the basics ot attacking and
defending are as tightly tuned as
ever. Players move with impressive
fidelity, and it's a breeze to control

the speed of dribbling or the power

behind a pass or shot. In fact, for all the
new features in the game, the most impres
sive tweak in FIFA 'll is just the basic way
in which the ball moves about the field. The
game flows faster and more smoothly than it
has before, with the ball bouncing, spinning
and dragging on the ground in the way you'd
expect. For as good as the ball physics are,

though, the game is sometimes puzzlingly
restrictive in letting you get to a free ball,
whether because it won't let you change to
controlling the proper player fast enough or
because it's already decided that another
player "is supposed" to be getting the ball.
That isn't to say that this year's edition
of FIFA doesn't offer some bigger "back-of
the-box" additions as well, but only that
these new features aren't very compelling.
The biggest addition is the new "Be a
Goalkeeper" mode, which is about as exciting
as it sounds. While it does allow for 11 -player
online play, playing between the pipes for an
entire match is pretty boring unless you're
facing a shot. The controls are deep enough
that these moments are fun, they're just not
frequent enough and they shouldn't be, if
the game is to remain realistic.

I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the
"Personality Plus" feature, which supposedly
makes each player shoot, dribble or defend
like they do in real life. This works all right
for some of the bigger names like Kaka or
Beckham, but it's not übiquitous enough to
really change the game.
Speaking of big-time players, FIFA' 11
impresses with its accurate recreation of stars
like Landon Donovan and Wayne Rooney.
The grass and the ball look good as well, and
the majority of animations are fluid and
believable. Given the huge roster of players
and global locations that the game offers,
though, it's not surprising that other areas
lack this attention to detail. The sounds of
the game are adequate if a bit underwhelm
ing, but the charming pair of British com
mentators and a robust soundtrack of

licensed tunes, sometimes international,

make FIFA fun to listen to. (One of my

favorite features is that players, for
the most part, will yell to each
other in their native language.)
Once you've mastered the
basics of the game and gotten your
fill of the commentators, you might
want to try your hand in online
play. There's nothing groundbreak
ing in this regard, but it's a full-fea
tured experience with online
leagues, leaderboards and 11-on-11
matches, all with no lag if you have
a decent connection.
If you're already a veteran of
virtual soccer, I can't recommend
EA's latest effort to you enough.
Otherwise, you might need some
patience as you learn the ropes of a
fast game with an intricate control
scheme. Once you do, however,
there's enough customizability and
content here to easily keep you
happy until the next time your
favorite team takes the world stage.
