# From the Tech Blog | Enter CCRMA's Listening Room

"So the first thing you'll notice is ... how
dry it is," said my guide, Michael Repper 'l2.
These were the confusing words I heard as I
was let into what is arguably the coolest room
on the Stanford campus. After much anticipa
tion and a grueling bike ride up the hill, I had
finally gained access to a place that has been a
mystery to me since the day I found out it
existed: the listening room at the Center for
Computer Research in Music and Acoustics
(CCRMA).
Where? CCRMA (pronounced "Karma")
is located at the Knoll, in the old residence of
the University president. The research done at
CCRMA has brought us some of the most
important technological developments to
come out of Stanford, including digital synthe
sizers and "I am T-Pain"
iPhone apps.

In its day-to-day operations, CCRMA is
home to some incredible facilities and
research, mostly dealing with the use of com
puters in music. Like any academic depart
ment, CCRMA hosts projects led by world
renowned faculty. Take, for example, the
Stanford Laptop Orchestra, led by Ge Wang,
the co-founder of the iPhone app maker
Smule.
Something that sets CCRMA apart from
other departments, however, is the freedom
that students get to develop and present their
own projects. As part of the Music, Science &
Technology track, music students are given
tools that computer science or electrical engi
neering majors would be familiar with. But
here, students receive prompts along the lines
of "make a musical interaction."
My guide tonight, Repper, is one of those
students. He is a junior majoring in music
with a concentration in Music, Science &
Technology. According to him, it's this freedom

and open-endedness that sets CCRMA apart.
"The best part," he says, "is that all the
work is creative." And since all that creativity
needs an outlet, they have places like the listen
ing room.
So naturally, I ventured down the
CCRMA music hole.
Upon entering the listening room, I found
myself standing on a metal cage in the middle
of a practically soundproof room, quite literal
ly suspended in the ideal place to hear 16
channels of surround sound coming from
some of the best speakers in the world. I wait
ed for Repper to play the song I had selected
off my iPhone: "What a Wonderful World" by
Louis Armstrong.
Then the music started. The room speak
ers are set up so that the sound from each of
them hits you at exactly the same time, which
makes it nearly impossible to tell where the
sound is coming from. The experience was
similar to wearing really good headphones,

except I was standing inside of them. If I took
a step in any direction, I could detect a sound
change: as I neared each speaker, I began to
make out which speaker was playing what. It's
mind blowing to think that this room is so
specialized that no one records music in away
that takes full advantage of its potential.
As I stepped out of them room, mind
completely blown, I realized what Repper
meant by how "dry" it was. My ears started to
ring immediately from the echoes going
around in the hallway, and I could suddenly
hear my voice coming back at me from the
walls. I also realized that I had been spoiled by
this experience and will quite possibly never be
able to appreciate lesser sound again. Oh well.
