## Pulling the Plug WHAT TO WATCH NEXT WEEK 
### â€“ liz STARK contact liz: estark12@stanford. edu 
Sunday at 10 p.m.: The
penultimate episode of "Mad
Men" is directed by the silver
fox himself, John Slattery
(AMC).
Monday at 8 p.m.: "Dancing
with the Stars" is off the chain
this season. Find me at
Arrillaga running in sync with
the situation's abdominal
undulations (ABC).
Tuesday at 9 p.m.: Fox has
just picked up the full season
of "Raising Hope," so watch
to see if you approve and if
Cloris Leachman is the new
Betty White (Fox).
Thursday at 8:30 p.m.: Holy
tamale! It's the first two live
episodes of "30 Rock!" Now
we'll really understand how
far SNL has fallen (NBC).

In 1995,1 saw my first and only
funeral after my grandfather
died, but since then, my life has
been attended by the deaths, grue
some and civilized, of many a tel
evision show. Most will have
their day in court, even if the
ruling is unjust, as was the case
with "American Dreams" (have I
referred to that show enough?) or
"The Middleman." This fall, howev
er, two series I touted in my pre
view column have already fallen to
the swords of Hollywood execu
tives: Fox's "Lone Star" and ABC's
"My Generation." Let's look at how
the shows themselves and we, the
wielders of the remote controls,
failed these two somewhat promis
ing upstarts.
The most obvious commonali
ties between the two are genre and
setting. The portrait of a Texas con
man in "Lone Star" doesn't have
the flash of most con narratives or
even the charisma of reformed TV
con men such as Patrick Jane of
CBS's "The Mentalist" or Neal
Caffrey of TNT's "White Collar."
These dramedy procedurals only

refer to trauma (dead wives, bad
parents), using it as a veneer of
psychological development for
their suave leading men. In com
parison to that technique, also a pet
peeve of mine in Hollywood, "Lone
Star" forces its protagonist, Robert
Allen, to confront trauma daily in
the form of his father. Where Allen
is still looking for his comfort zone,
Jane and Caffrey have already
found it in their respective law
enforcement positions. Perhaps the
very lack of community that
defines Allen and resonates through
the show's title alienated audiences.
Presently, network dramas fall into
the categories of dramedy, proce
dural and Shonda Rhimes, all of
which rely on an ensemble cast
with many shoulders to cry on. The
ability of "Lone Star" to isolate
Allen's relationships with his father,
his father-in law and his two wives
may have been too complex for
American audiences.
"My Generation" similarly suf
fers from a perversion of the
ensemble dynamic. Last year's com
edy successes, "Modern Family"

and "Glee," redefined television
families, and originally, it seemed
that "My Generation" was on that
same track. By pursuing the con
flicts precipitated by the dashing of
high school expectations, the show
provides itself plenty of dramatic
fodder. Although the premiere
numbers of "My Gen" were better
than those of "Lone Star," it failed
to live up to its own hype. The uses
of the timeline and flashbacks were
not only irritating, but also
destructive to any construction of
community among these 10 high
school classmates. I appreciate the

show's emphasis on the disillusion
ment of the current generation,
but, without camaraderie or friend
ship (we witnessed only one, Dawn
and Kenneth, and that's tainted by
sexual desire), this drama loses all
hope the emotion that sustains a
depressing genre. The premise of
the show itself, to see how the rela
tionships develop in a new decade,
was perhaps presented too subtly in
the first two episodes to intrigue
audiences sufficiently.
What does it say about the
marketing of television that critical



"MY GENERATION," COURTESY ABC
acclaim, sharp writing and strong
performances from fresh faces are
not sufficient to make a show suc
cessful? In the age of Internet
advertising, a show needs more
than a juicy trailer or an aestheti
cally pleasing poster. It needs a link
to the Twitter account upon which
it is based, or a recognizable image
of its star, or a CD in the iTunes
store. As TV gains more cultural
clout, the extent of its cultural
influence must similarly grow. Or,
to invoke a cop-out argument, the
ability of a show to dodge cancella
tion may boil down to luck: Nancy

Franklin argues in the most recent
issue of the New Yorker that, had
FX's "Terriers" premiered just a
week later in the schedule, it would
have suffered a fate similar to "Lone
Star," which had to face off against
the return of juggernaut "Dancing
with the Stars" and the dramatically
publicized premiere of "The Event."
It's also entirely possible that, when
the unaired episodes of "Lone Star"
and "My Generation" are inevitably
released on DVD, they will inspire
the same adoration and regret as
"Arrested Development," though
with fewer laughs.
