## No. 1 Card kicks off conference play at USC 
### BROOKE DAVIS 
With the close of non-conference
play, the undefeated Stanford women's
soccer team is looking forward to the
start of Pac-10 play. After defeating
No. 13 Santa Clara (7-3-2) in a game
that tested the stamina of the Cardinal
offense, No. 1 Stanford (9-0-2) plans on
keeping its momentum alive in confer
ence play.
In its first match of conference play,
Stanford will face No. 20 USC (7-2-2)
on Friday before taking on No. 13
UCLA (7-3-1) on Sunday. Given the
tough test that Stanford faced Sunday
against the talented Broncos across
town, the Cardinal should be in good
shape to move on to a pair of tough
southern California squads.
Even as the clock ticked on and
nerves escalated both on the field and
in the stands last weekend, the Cardi
nal kept its cool and continued to press
the Bronco defensive line until it put
away two goals for the win.
"If teams tactically are dropping a
lot of numbers back, it's going to take
time," said Stanford head coach Paul
Ratcliffe. "We have to be patient and
maybe it's the 80th minute, maybe it's
the 90th minute, that we score the goal.
So we have to stay true to our game
plan and be patient."
The game against Santa Clara

marked the end of non-conference
play for Stanford and the beginning of
its quest to repeat as Pac-10 champi
ons.
"I think every game is important,"
Ratcliffe said. "So we take every game
seriously. The Pac-10 has a significance
to us because we want to win the Pac
10 championship this year."
Both the Trojans and the Bruins are

NOTES ! No. 1 Stanford, after closing out its un
defeated non-conference season against
Santa Clara last weekend, will look for a
strong start in Pac-10 play as it heads to south
ern California this weekend to take on two of
its toughest conference foes. USC and UCLA
are both coming off of losses, and should be
hungry for a win.

offense this season. The senior forward scored the game-winner over Santa
Clara last weekend and leads the nation with 14 goals on the season.
