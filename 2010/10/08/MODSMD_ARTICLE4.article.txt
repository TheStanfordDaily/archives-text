# PAC-PREPPED
## No. 1 Card kicks off conference play at USC 
### BROOKE DAVIS 
With the close of non-conference
play, the undefeated Stanford women's
soccer team is looking forward to the
start of Pac-10 play. After defeating
No. 13 Santa Clara (7-3-2) in a game
that tested the stamina of the Cardinal
offense, No. 1 Stanford (9-0-2) plans on
keeping its momentum alive in confer
ence play.
In its first match of conference play,
Stanford will face No. 20 USC (7-2-2)
on Friday before taking on No. 13
UCLA (7-3-1) on Sunday. Given the
tough test that Stanford faced Sunday
against the talented Broncos across
town, the Cardinal should be in good
shape to move on to a pair of tough
southern California squads.
Even as the clock ticked on and
nerves escalated both on the field and
in the stands last weekend, the Cardi
nal kept its cool and continued to press
the Bronco defensive line until it put
away two goals for the win.
"If teams tactically are dropping a
lot of numbers back, it's going to take
time," said Stanford head coach Paul
Ratcliffe. "We have to be patient and
maybe it's the 80th minute, maybe it's
the 90th minute, that we score the goal.
So we have to stay true to our game
plan and be patient."
The game against Santa Clara

marked the end of non-conference
play for Stanford and the beginning of
its quest to repeat as Pac-10 champi
ons.
"I think every game is important,"
Ratcliffe said. "So we take every game
seriously. The Pac-10 has a significance
to us because we want to win the Pac
10 championship this year."
Both the Trojans and the Bruins are

NOTES ! No. 1 Stanford, after closing out its un
defeated non-conference season against
Santa Clara last weekend, will look for a
strong start in Pac-10 play as it heads to south
ern California this weekend to take on two of
its toughest conference foes. USC and UCLA
are both coming off of losses, and should be
hungry for a win.

coming off 1-0 losses to unranked
teams. On Oct.l, UCLA fell to Pep
perdine, while San Diego defeated
use.
"They're both great opponents,"
Ratcliffe said. "They'll be very
tough games. We're looking for
ward to some really good competi
tion."
In 2009, Stanford faced UCLA
twice.The Bruins put up a fight each
time, keeping the Cardinal at two
goals a match, while Stanford man
aged four goals in its sole game
against USC. Although Stanford
came out of the two games against
UCLA with two victories, (a 2-0 vic
tory in the regular season and a 2-1
overtime win in the national semifi
nal), the Cardinal expects a chal
lenging face-off this Sunday.
"I think traditionally, UCLA has
had an amazing team," Ratcliffe

said. "Jillian [Ellis, UCLA head
coach] has done a great job down
there and they have fantastic play
ers. They're always one of our
toughest games through the whole
year."
The Stanford offense promises
to be a force to be reckoned with
throughout conference play. Senior
forward Christen Press was just
named one of 10 finalists for the
Lowe's Senior CLASS Award,
awarded to a player that exempli
fies both on-the-field contributions
and support in the community. With
her goal in the Santa Clara match,
Press tied Sarah Rafanelli for the
school record for total career goals
scored, which stands at 59.
Behind the offense stands the
Stanford defensive back line. Stan
ford's defense has kept goals al
lowed to a minimum with freshman

Emily Oliver planted in the net.
"Emily's done a great job," Rat
cliffe said. "I think her decision
making and organization of the box
and her decision-making coming
out on crosses and dealing with
crosses has been incredible, I think
she's brought a real presence and
leadership to the back line."
With Oliver in the net for the
past few weeks, senior goalkeeper
Kira Maker has made strong contri
butions to the Stanford team on and
off the field.
"Kira's been great," Ratcliffe
said. "She understands the situa
tion, she's still working hard and
she's pushing because she could be
in the next game, for all we know, as
the starting goalkeeper. She's that
close to being a starter. She's been a
great supporter of Emily, a great
teammate, and everyone really re

spects her."
Last year, the Cardinal had a
record of 25 wins and one loss. Stan
ford made it to the NCAA champi
onship after a perfect regular sea
son and fell by one goal to now-No.
3 North Carolina (10-1-1).
"1 think we play a distinct style,"
Ratcliffe said, "in that we try to
keep possession. The team is fast
when it's on. It's more like a rhythm
of play and then a change to a fast
speed when we get either equal
numbers or numerical advantage.
That's kind of what we're trying to
teach."
The Cardinal will face USC on
Friday at 7 p.m. in Los Angeles,
Calif., and will take on UCLA on
Sunday at 1 p.m. in Westwood, Calif.

hungry for a win.



SIMON WARBY/The Stanford Daily
Christen Press, above, has been an integral part of the Cardinal's dominant
offense this season. The senior forward scored the game-winner over Santa
Clara last weekend and leads the nation with 14 goals on the season.
coming off 1-0 losses to unranked
teams. On Oct.l, UCLA fell to Pep
perdine, while San Diego defeated
use.
"They're both great opponents,"
Ratcliffe said. "They'll be very
tough games. We're looking for
ward to some really good competi
tion."
In 2009, Stanford faced UCLA
twice.The Bruins put up a fight each
time, keeping the Cardinal at two
goals a match, while Stanford man
aged four goals in its sole game
against USC. Although Stanford
came out of the two games against
UCLA with two victories, (a 2-0 vic
tory in the regular season and a 2-1
overtime win in the national semifi
nal), the Cardinal expects a chal
lenging face-off this Sunday.
"I think traditionally, UCLA has
had an amazing team," Ratcliffe

said. "Jillian [Ellis, UCLA head
coach] has done a great job down
there and they have fantastic play
ers. They're always one of our
toughest games through the whole
year."
The Stanford offense promises
to be a force to be reckoned with
throughout conference play. Senior
forward Christen Press was just
named one of 10 finalists for the
Lowe's Senior CLASS Award,
awarded to a player that exempli
fies both on-the-field contributions
and support in the community. With
her goal in the Santa Clara match,
Press tied Sarah Rafanelli for the
school record for total career goals
scored, which stands at 59.
Behind the offense stands the
Stanford defensive back line. Stan
ford's defense has kept goals al
lowed to a minimum with freshman

Emily Oliver planted in the net.
"Emily's done a great job," Rat
cliffe said. "I think her decision
making and organization of the box
and her decision-making coming
out on crosses and dealing with
crosses has been incredible, I think
she's brought a real presence and
leadership to the back line."
With Oliver in the net for the
past few weeks, senior goalkeeper
Kira Maker has made strong contri
butions to the Stanford team on and
off the field.
"Kira's been great," Ratcliffe
said. "She understands the situa
tion, she's still working hard and
she's pushing because she could be
in the next game, for all we know, as
the starting goalkeeper. She's that
close to being a starter. She's been a
great supporter of Emily, a great
teammate, and everyone really re

spects her."
Last year, the Cardinal had a
record of 25 wins and one loss. Stan
ford made it to the NCAA champi
onship after a perfect regular sea
son and fell by one goal to now-No.
3 North Carolina (10-1-1).
"1 think we play a distinct style,"
Ratcliffe said, "in that we try to
keep possession. The team is fast
when it's on. It's more like a rhythm
of play and then a change to a fast
speed when we get either equal
numbers or numerical advantage.
That's kind of what we're trying to
teach."
The Cardinal will face USC on
Friday at 7 p.m. in Los Angeles,
Calif., and will take on UCLA on
Sunday at 1 p.m. in Westwood, Calif.
