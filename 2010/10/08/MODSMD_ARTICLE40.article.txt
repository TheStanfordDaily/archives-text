## Vegan Chinese 'Garden Fresh' 
### â€” joshua GLUCOFT contact joshua: glucoft@stanford. edu 
The Internet is overflowing
with recommendations and
opinions on food, so why
would one read this column? To
begin, sites like Yelp end up having
insanely tight ratings distributions,
where almost every restaurant
scores between three and four stars,
obviating the utility of the artifi
cially-precise five-star rating sys
tem; even Alinea, number seven on
the S. Pellegrino World's 50 Best
Restaurants list, only scores four
and a half stars on Yelp.
Furthermore, underlying the
narrow distributions is a skewed
mix of contributions from occa-

sional bloggers who only voice
their opinion to express their five
star love or one-star disappoint
ment. The result is basically a blan
ket "moderate" recommendation
for every restaurant emerging from
the balanced set of extremist
reviews an unhelpful resource
for anyone looking for something
new. Accordingly, as part of my
first review at the official beginning
of this column, I have decided to
switch to a simpler, actionable rat
ing system with three choices:
"Definitely worth trying;" "Don't
bother;" and "Middle of the road."
Good eats!

About six months ago, Alice
Liang, the wife of the owner of
Garden Fresh in Mountain View,
decided to grow the business and
open a new location in Palo Alto.
Garden Fresh serves vegan Chinese
food, an interesting take on an oth
erwise pork-heavy tradition. Less
than one percent of the United
States considers itself vegan, so the
expansion seems to suggest that the
food would compensate for an oth
erwise tiny target demographic.
The restaurant itself is inviting
but underwhelming. It seats just
over 30 if you are willing to get
cozy with the table next to you.
The atmosphere lends itself to a
lunch spot, as the decor and dense

table arrangement aren't
geared to long, relaxing din
ners. And there is also a bit of
a frenzied vibe as Alice is
forced to play hostess, wait
ress, cashier and owner/man
ager simultaneously.
There are some dishes,
though, that really stand out

through the mediocrity of the sur
roundings. Specifically, the
"General's Veggie Chicken" was a
beautiful balance of sweet and
spicy. Also, the "Orange Veggie
Beef," made from shitake mush
rooms, was an incredibly high
fidelity impersonation of beef with
a wonderful flavor.
On the other hand, there were
some dishes that should just be
avoided. The biggest offender was
the "Grilled Veggie Salmon" that
had a taste and texture comparable
to but less pleasing than gefilte fish,
a traditional Jewish dish. The broth
in the corn and tofu soup was also
off. Even the side of brown rice
seemed a bit undercooked.
Most dishes were somewhere
in the middle and often had offset
ting pros and cons. The "Basil
Tempura" was flavorful, but the
texture was too monotonous to
compose a complete entree. The
scallion pancakes had a good
crunch but lacked the complexity
to be interesting once the tempura

crisp lost its heat. Likewise, the hot
and sour soup was relatively stan
dard, and the "Basil Mu Shu Rolls,"
one of the few dishes on the menu
that was not fried or doused in
sauce, were not particularly flavor
ful.
If you're a vegetarian or vegan,
you'll be delighted by some of the
flavor profiles Garden Fresh has to
offer; considering the relatively
limited set of options available to
this cohort, Garden Fresh would
have to be considered "Definitely
worth trying." But for the rest of
us, it's not a particularly healthy
trade-off for animal-derived ingre
dients, nor are the dishes unique;
they are, after all, knock-offs of
typical Chinese dishes. Garden
Fresh is more like "Middle of the
road."
