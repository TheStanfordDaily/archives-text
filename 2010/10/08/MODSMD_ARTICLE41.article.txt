Folks, it's time to get your
game ready for Full Moon
and what better than check
ing off all of Roxy's favorite clan
destine make-out spots around
campus? If only Visitor
Information Services offered a tour.
Follow Roxy as she walks backward
through her top five stomping (and
kissing) grounds.
Frost Amphitheater
Tucked behind the Alumni Center,
Frost is a place you might have only
been to once: for O-Show during
NSO. Well, Roxy encourages you to
take a second and third, and
fourth look. A secluded yet vast
venue, it has plenty of room to
romp around while surrounded by
a (mostly) private perimeter of
trees. Talk about an O show.
Cactus Garden
This succulent garden is a bit of a
challenge to find after sundown,
but the prickly pears are a relatively
pointed way to keep unwanted
intruders at bay. Roxy never liked
her men spineless, and the land
scape certainly inspires certain cacti
to reach full potential. lust be sure
not to roll over unexpectedly in the
throes of passion, lest they turn
into the echoes of dissatisfaction.

Golf Course
A long walk or a quick drive up the

hill opens the possibilities of end
less green. Take a mood-setting
stroll under the stars or take a more
horizontal approach on the
groomed grass itself. Roxy's not
above letting someone take a few
swings at her driving range. Just be
sure to bring your nine-iron.
Green Library Stacks
Everyone needs a study break, and
the South Stacks suit every fuzzy
and techie's needs. Roxy's office
hours, held late every night, can
help you bang out that position
paper or gain a more physical
understanding of heat transfer.
Perhaps a little hands-on learning?
An oral exam? The possibilities, like
the book titles, are endless as is
Roxy's stamina.
Faculty Hot Tubs
The Holy Grail of hookup hot
spots, the exact location is known
to a select few. Roxy knows that
nothing is steamier than a quick
dip in forbidden waters never
mind who has been there before.
Some faculty are even outright wel
comed in Roxy's book especially
those with "endowed professor
ships" ...
