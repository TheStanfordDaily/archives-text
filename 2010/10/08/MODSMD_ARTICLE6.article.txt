## CRIME & SAFETY Quake drill rolls with some bumps 
### CAROLINE CHEN STAFF WRITER 
The earthquake evacuation drill on
Thursday morning conducted by the Office
of Emergency Management came and went
peacefully for most. For others, however, it
didn't happen at all.
According to a school-wide e-mail from
Greg Boardman, vice provost for Student
Affairs, the AlertSU outdoor sirens were to
"sound for 45 seconds to signal the begin
ning of the exercise" yesterday. At 10:05
a.m., sirens began going off but on some
parts of campus they were barely audible
and, to some, underwhelming. The high
pitched tone had to compete with sounds of
traffic and planes overhead, and stopped
after less than a minute.
"It stopped ringing so fast, it was like, did
that just happen?" said Julia Ko 'l3. "The
sound needs to be louder."
Nick Isaacs 'l2 didn't even hear the alarm
in his Spanish 1A class. "We were singing a
song about Spanish verbs to the tune of 'La
Cucaracha,"' he said. "We did not hear the
sirens."
It wasn't until a student read the AlertSU
text message that Isaacs' class realized they
should evacuate the building.
Keith Perry, campus emergency manager,
was not ready to give an immediate assess
ment of the drill on Thursday. For students
reflecting on the drill, some don't remember
much they simply slept through the
sirens, which were quieter than the sirens
typically used inside dorms for fire drills.

Those who did hear the sirens in class
rooms near the Quad began leaving the
buildings immediately, around 10:06 a.m.,
only to experience another glitch.
According to the protocol, students, facul
ty and staff were supposed to go to their near

est Emergency Assembly Point (EAP) and
check in. But most people seemed unsure
where to go, bemusedly milling around and
following the crowd.
"I was looking around for a congrega
tion point," said Ava Lindstrom 'l4, who
joined the group clustered outside Green
Library. "I think we should actually have a
map with meeting points on it, to make it
easier for everyone to figure out where to
go-"
In fact, there are 115 EAPs on campus,
and each building on campus has maps indi
cating where to go. However, as Lindstrom
pointed out, those not in a building at the
time of the drill might have difficulty figuring
out where to go.
While the drill confused some, most par
ticipants believed it was a worthwhile exer
cise. "There are a lot of people from out of
state who wouldn't know what to do in an
earthquake," Lindstrom said. "So that's
valuable."
Regina Roberts, a librarian at Green Li
brary, agreed with Lindstrom. "Of course it's
a good idea," she said. "At least the people
who work in Green now know where our
emergency meeting point is."
At Memorial Church, the staff reflected
on a different issue.
"Our staff were able to exit the building
quickly and effectively," said Scotty McLen
nan of the Office for Religious Life. "What I
am worried about is the fact that [Universi
ty organist] Robert Huw Morgan tried to get
the tourists out, and a lot of the tourists did
n't leave. So if we had a serious emergency,
we would really have to work on getting the
tourists out, and we think it was a linguistic
issue not all of them understand English."

Many students did not report to emergency assembly points like the one
pictured above because, they said, the sirens signaling the start of the
Thursday earthquake drill weren't loud enough for them to hear.
