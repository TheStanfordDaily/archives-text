## Hennessy discusses financial aid at Faculty Senate 
### ELIZABETH TITUS EDITOR IN CHIEF 
University President John Hennessy
highlighted the endowment's recovery at
Thursday's Faculty Senate meeting, which
also saw a detailed overview of undergrad
uate admission and financial aid two years
into a financial aid overhaul that pressured
University finances but erased tuition for
hundreds of students' families.
The endowment's growth to $13.8 bil
lion this year marked a turnaround from
the $4.6 billion drop to $12.6 billion last
year, the largest single-year fall in the Uni
versity's history. "We're beginning to see
some greater stability," Hennessy said. "It's
a long way back to where we once were."
He repeated Stanford Management
Company's comparison between the 10-

year performances of Stanford's principal
investments, with a return of 6.9 percent,
and the U.S. equity market, which declined
over the decade.
"I think it still shows the advantage of a
highly diversified portfolio, although in the
financial crisis of the last few years, no port
folio was completely safe," Hennessy said.
"I think going forward, we hope to be
able to continue to deliver good returns
while ensuring that the endowment can
meet its obligation payout to the Universi
ty," he added.
Heading into the final year of the Stan
ford Challenge, a five-year, multi-billion
dollar fundraising campaign, Hennessy said
the University has seen a "significant" jump
in annual giving. It is helping close the
deficit in undergraduate financial aid,
which Stanford hopes to seal in four to five

years, the president said. Alumni must un
derstand the importance of that support
when they consider giving, he added.
The endowment payout funds more
than $6O million of the financial aid budget
this year. The remainder of the $lOO mil
lion-plus budget is covered by the Stanford
Fund, general funds, the Tier II buffer and
other sources. Slightly fewer students are
receiving financial aid this year than last.
Hennessy's remarks came after a cam
pus-wide earthquake drill Thursday morn
ing. "I think we discovered that we still have
a lot of work to do," Hennessy said about
the community's readiness. A major earth
quake in California is a matter of "when,"
not "if," added law Prof. Hank Greely.
Shaw Talks Test-Score Trends, Recaps Aid
Dean of Undergraduate Admission and

Financial Aid Richard Shaw last made a
formal report to the faculty two and a half
years ago, just as Stanford made a major
commitment to more financial aid. On
Thursday, he recapped those changes and
provided a detailed glimpse at the under
graduate demographic.
The $15.5 million financial aid boost of
2008-2009, which erased parent contribu
tions for families making less than $60,000
and tuition for families making less than
$lOO,OOO, has helped protect families' home
equity, cost-of-living adjustments and re
sponsibilities to multiple children in college
as the economy flagged, Shaw said.
In fiscal year 2010, more freshmen with
families making between $lOO,OOO and
$200,000 received financial aid, he added.
