## Hennessy discusses financial aid at Faculty Senate 
### ELIZABETH TITUS EDITOR IN CHIEF 
University President John Hennessy
highlighted the endowment's recovery at
Thursday's Faculty Senate meeting, which
also saw a detailed overview of undergrad
uate admission and financial aid two years
into a financial aid overhaul that pressured
University finances but erased tuition for
hundreds of students' families.
The endowment's growth to $13.8 bil
lion this year marked a turnaround from
the $4.6 billion drop to $12.6 billion last
year, the largest single-year fall in the Uni
versity's history. "We're beginning to see
some greater stability," Hennessy said. "It's
a long way back to where we once were."
He repeated Stanford Management
Company's comparison between the 10-

year performances of Stanford's principal
investments, with a return of 6.9 percent,
and the U.S. equity market, which declined
over the decade.
"I think it still shows the advantage of a
highly diversified portfolio, although in the
financial crisis of the last few years, no port
folio was completely safe," Hennessy said.
"I think going forward, we hope to be
able to continue to deliver good returns
while ensuring that the endowment can
meet its obligation payout to the Universi
ty," he added.
Heading into the final year of the Stan
ford Challenge, a five-year, multi-billion
dollar fundraising campaign, Hennessy said
the University has seen a "significant" jump
in annual giving. It is helping close the
deficit in undergraduate financial aid,
which Stanford hopes to seal in four to five

years, the president said. Alumni must un
derstand the importance of that support
when they consider giving, he added.
The endowment payout funds more
than $6O million of the financial aid budget
this year. The remainder of the $lOO mil
lion-plus budget is covered by the Stanford
Fund, general funds, the Tier II buffer and
other sources. Slightly fewer students are
receiving financial aid this year than last.
Hennessy's remarks came after a cam
pus-wide earthquake drill Thursday morn
ing. "I think we discovered that we still have
a lot of work to do," Hennessy said about
the community's readiness. A major earth
quake in California is a matter of "when,"
not "if," added law Prof. Hank Greely.
Shaw Talks Test-Score Trends, Recaps Aid
Dean of Undergraduate Admission and

Financial Aid Richard Shaw last made a
formal report to the faculty two and a half
years ago, just as Stanford made a major
commitment to more financial aid. On
Thursday, he recapped those changes and
provided a detailed glimpse at the under
graduate demographic.
The $15.5 million financial aid boost of
2008-2009, which erased parent contribu
tions for families making less than $60,000
and tuition for families making less than
$lOO,OOO, has helped protect families' home
equity, cost-of-living adjustments and re
sponsibilities to multiple children in college
as the economy flagged, Shaw said.
In fiscal year 2010, more freshmen with
families making between $lOO,OOO and
$200,000 received financial aid, he added.
The number of freshmen getting aid
in that range dropped back in FYII.
Trends in the entering class include
a drop since 2003 in the number of stu
dents reporting their class ranks a
"Lake Wobegon effect," Shaw said.
Forty-one percent of the Class of 2014
reported their class ranks to Stanford,
compared to 83 percent in 2003.
Median verbal SAT scores for the
entering class have hovered between
710 and 730 in the past decade, land
ing this fall at 720. The median math
score this fall was 740 on the high
end for the decade and the median
writing score was 730, the highest it
has been since that section's introduc
tion in 2006.
Shaw turned to other universities,
telling faculty 26 percent of students
admitted to the Class of 2014 also
were admitted to UC-Berkeley; 21
percent to UC-Los Angeles; 18 per
cent to Princeton; 17 percent to Har
vard; 15 percent to Yale; 13 percent to

UC-San Diego; 14 percent to Duke;
and 13 percent to M.I.T.
Of the *l4 admits who did not en
roll at Stanford, 32 percent chose
Harvard; 16 percent, Yale; 14 percent,
Princeton; and 13 percent, M.I.T. UC-
Berkeley was not among the top 20
schools those students chose.
At 71.6 percent of 2,340 admits,
yield this spring was the highest since
at least 1954. Shaw attributed that, at
least in part, to connections alumni
made with applicants who participat
ed in the pilot alumni-interview pro
gram in several U.S. cities last year.
The Committee on Undergraduate
Admission and Financial Aid found a
"very small effect" of the interviews
on evaluations of Stanford hopefuls,
and will decide the future of the
three-year pilot after its wrap-up this
year.
Up Next: Libraries, SUES, ROTC
David Spiegel, psychiatry profes
sor and 35-year faculty member, ap
peared as the new chairman of the
Faculty Senate on Thursday. "I should
warn you as a psychiatrist that I have
never before undertaken group ther
apy on such a massive scale," he

joked.
The Senate now looks to an Oct.
21 report on the future of Stanford's
libraries, which earlier this year af
firmed their support of a massive
book-scanning partnership with
Google Book Search. On Nov. 4, pro
fessors Sue McConnell and James
Campbell Ph.D. 'B9 are due to deliver
an update on the Study of Under
graduate Education at Stanford
(SUES), a major review of undergrad
curriculum.
When the ad hoc committee on
ROTC will report to the faculty is un
clear. When U.S. Senate Republicans
blocked debate on a proposed repeal
of the "don't ask, don't tell" policy last
month a repeal expected when the
ad hoc committee formed in March
the timing and likely outcome of a
decision at Stanford were thrown into
doubt. But the committee is meeting,
Spiegel told The Daily, and he is "sure
they'll report sometime this year."
Rex Jamison, academic secretary
to the University, promised: "There
won't be any dragging."
