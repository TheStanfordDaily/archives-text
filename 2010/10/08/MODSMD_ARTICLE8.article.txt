# STUDENT LIFE
## Ready, set, go – green Athletics, SSS use grant money to reduce waste at sports events 
### CASSANDRA FELICIANO DESK EDITOR 
Cyrus Pinto 'l3 will take a literal approach to trash
talking while he hops between tailgates at Saturday's
football showdown against USC. Accompanied by 12
student volunteers, Pinto will implement the first recy
cling initiative at pre-game events around Stanford Sta
dium and spread awareness about proper garbage dis
posal.
Pinto, a member of Students for Sustainable Stan
ford (SSS), is heading a bottle and can collection on
Saturday as part of an initiative to make Stanford ath
letics more eco-friendly. While the planning for this
particular event began last summer, Athletics turned
over a new leaf in 2008.
The University's athletics department competed
against 61 applicants for a $120,000 grant from the
state's Department of Conservation (Calßecycle).
Twelve other schools and organizations received finan-

cial assistance, totaling $1.5 million,
as part of the Beverage Container
Recycling and Litter Reduction
Program.

"The goal of the program is to
increase recycling of CRV bever
age containers by providing edu
cation on recycling at Stanford

athletic facilities,"
wrote Janine
Corcoran, accounts
executive for Car
dinal Sports, LLC,
in an e-mail to The
Daily.
Stanford's Cal-
Recycle initiative,
intended to run
throughout the en
tire 2008 football
season, was tem
porarily put on hold
because of the
state's financial cri-

sis. The grant was re-

opened midway through the
2009 football season, giving Ath-

letics time to revive the program with recycling promo
tions at the end of that season, as well as for baseball
and Softball games.
Projects aimed solely at collection were in the works
since 2004, with recycling bins at the football stadium.
Stanford Athletics, Cardinal Sports and Peninsula San
itary Service, Inc. (PSSI) have since placed bins at the
soccer, baseball and Softball stadiums.
But in 2008, "we still felt there was a need to educate
our fans on recycling and remind them to recycle at
games," Corcoran said.
The grant will allow for receptacles at all facilities,
covering a total of 350 events and garnering recyclables
from more than one million attendees. Bins have al
ready been purchased for use at the Sunken Diamond,
the softball field and Maloney Field, which also fea
tures reminders on the PA systems during soccer
games.
On Saturday, SSS members will be talking to fans at
the largest tailgate events and will also man a booth in
side the stadium from the 5 p.m. kick-off until 7:00 p.m.

sustainability.
Pinto is hoping that the sheer
presence of bins at the smaller tail
gates will be enough of a motivator
for fans to recycle their bottles and
cans.
Even though Pinto has only two
and a half hours to cover the major
tailgate areas with 12 volunteers, he
seems confident they can accommo
date the inevitably large crowd that
will arrive for the Stanford-USC
game.
"We've had to deal with thou
sands of people before, and this is
definitely going to be a challenge,"
Pinto said. But "it's a pilot program,
and we don't expect everything to
be perfect," he added. "What we
hope is that we could divert the
largest amount of bottles and cans."
