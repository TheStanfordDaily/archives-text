## SALAAM Saying farewell to the 'grandfather' of Stanford's Muslim community 
### KATHLEEN CHAYKOWSKI DESK EDITOR 
The Havana Room of the Graduate Community
Center is filled with friends and family sitting
around dinner tables covered in red table
cloths. An expanse of food is laid out in the back
of the room, with everything from chicken
masala, to kebabs, to korma, to naan.
Friends reunite after a summer away from campus, and
little girls in sundresses are playing with balloons that
have fallen on the floor. Outside of the doorway, young
Muslim women wearing saris pull out high heels from
their handbags and change out of their flats before enter
ing the room. It is the annual Eid celebration at Stanford,
one of the largest gatherings co-organized by the Muslim
Student Awareness Network (MSAN) and the Islamic
Society of Stanford University (ISSU), in celebration of
the end of Ramadan.
Boisterous conversation dies down as students make
speeches at the podium. Next in line is a first-year Stan
ford Law student, Omar Shakir 'O7, who takes the floor to
bid farewell to Ibrahim Almojel, a recent graduate of
Stanford's Ph.D. program in Management Science and
Engineering (MS&E), who made nothing short of a
tremendous impact on the Stanford Muslim community.
"He helped people detained in airports," Shakir said of
Almojel, a soft-spoken 31-year-old sitting near the front
of the room with his wife, Sara, and one-year-old son,
Saad. "His car was the community car ... He was the big
brother I never had."
Shakir announced that in honor of Almojel's contribu
tions, the community's Muslim-American Scholarship
Award will be named in Almojel's honor.
When Shakir handed Almojel the microphone at the
front of the room, Almojel was speechless for a few mo
ments, moved to tears.
"The beautiful thing about this community," Almojel
finally said, "is that I feel I know everyone here this is
our family."
For the past six and a half years, Almojel, known
among Muslims on campus as "grandfather," has been
working tirelessly behind the scenes to build a cohesive
Muslim family that is engaged with the rest of campus, a
challenge without a community center or a full-time staff
member.
"When I first came, it was a place to pray and say
Salaam," Almojel said of joining the community. "After
being involved, it became my life."
Some of Almojel's contributions could only be noticed
at the micro level, like ensuring that a room on the third
floor of Old Union is reserved every quarter for Friday Ju
mu'ah prayer.
Other efforts were more noticeable, like working to
preserve the independence of MSAN, whose emphasis
lies in engaging both Muslim and non-Muslim students in
exploring social and political issues, from the ISSU, which
focuses on students' personal religious lives.
Other structural changes included creating the Muslim
Board, a discussion forum comprised of leaders of MSAN
and ISSU, which enables the two groups to remain in
open, constructive dialogue.
"The Muslim Board helped make sure they had an
aligned, long-term vision for the community," Almojel
said.
Although a Muslim community center is still hypothet
ical, Almojel worked extensively with the University to
establish a center on campus where events could be held,
students could go to relax and visitors could be welcomed.
"I think that the University is in a time of defining what
the community center means," Almojel said. "We're not
an Asian organization or a religious organization. And I
don't think the administration is comfortable with that."
Almojel was ISSU president from 2005 to 2006 and
Chair of the Muslim Board from 2004 to 2006. Yet,
whether or not he was in an official leadership position, he
was a mentor for students and a problem-solver when un
expected situations arose.
For example, when another male Muslim Stanford
graduate student was detained after postponing gradua
tion plans, it was Almojel who collaborated with the Bech
tel International Center to release the student from
prison. He also had to deal with the FBI when he received
a letter from the bureau at his residence upon becoming
ISSU president in 2005.
Helping students deal with prejudice was one of the
more complex tasks Almojel took on. He counseled stu
dents grappling with anti-Islamic sentiments expressed in

the news or at some
campus events, like
one widely advertised
lecture, "The Trou-

ble with Islam,"
which was upset
ting to some stu
dents.

"Sometimes
people think that

you can stand up to terrorism and Muslims by standing up
to Islam," Almojel said. "But if you attack an identity, you
never really get anywhere."
And to raise Islamic awareness, he pushed to expand
Islamic studies on campus and developed the communi
ty's relationship with administrators.
"This country has a very Islamophobic environment,
and Ibrahim was the guy you'd always know would have
your back and advocate that things would be done and
done correctly," Shakir said. "How do you build a commu
nity that's inclusive and open to everyone? He was able to
uniquely do that."
Almojel said Muslim students at Stanford are con
fronted by the same issues that Muslims have to cope with
anywhere in the United States: defining what their faith
means to them, which can translate into abstaining from
drinking, avoiding wearing tight or immodest clothing
and not dating, difficult standards to adhere to if peers
hold different values.
For example, last summer, MS AN distributed a survey
titled, "What does Stanford know about Islam?"
"About 100 people across campus filled it out," said
MS AN president Mai El-Sadany 'll. "When asked what
people thought about when they saw the hijab, or head
scarf, the most common responses were: 'She's probably
oppressed; I wonder if she's forced to wear it; I wonder if
she's hot.'"
Almojel said his passion to help the community was in
spired by a peer who helped him when he studied at Van
derbilt as an international student from Saudi Arabia and
by the value he places in his faith.
To Almojel, being Muslim is about a "feeling that you
are connected directly to God, and no one has power over
you except God it gives me a lot of freedom. It helps
me make sure I'm on the right path."
Although Almojel returned to his home country to
work for the company that funded his Stanford studies, he
is sad to leave the University and the people he has be
come so close to.
"Stanford grows on you, and it's very difficult to leave
this place," Almojel said.
He has only one wish for the community that has been
such an important part of his time at Stanford: that it will
"have the wisdom to remain cohesive and discuss the
things that matter most."

For example, when another male Muslim Stanford
graduate student was detained after postponing gradua
tion plans, it was Almojel who collaborated with the Bech
tel International Center to release the student from
prison. He also had to deal with the FBI when he received
a letter from the bureau at his residence upon becoming
ISSU president in 2005.
Helping students deal with prejudice was one of the
more complex tasks Almojel took on. He counseled stu
dents grappling with anti-Islamic sentiments expressed in

the news or at some
campus events, like
one widely advertised
lecture, "The Trou-

ble with Islam,"
which was upset
ting to some stu
dents.

"Sometimes
people think that

you can stand up to terrorism and Muslims by standing up
to Islam," Almojel said. "But if you attack an identity, you
never really get anywhere."
And to raise Islamic awareness, he pushed to expand
Islamic studies on campus and developed the communi
ty's relationship with administrators.
"This country has a very Islamophobic environment,
and Ibrahim was the guy you'd always know would have
your back and advocate that things would be done and
done correctly," Shakir said. "How do you build a commu
nity that's inclusive and open to everyone? He was able to
uniquely do that."
Almojel said Muslim students at Stanford are con
fronted by the same issues that Muslims have to cope with
anywhere in the United States: defining what their faith
means to them, which can translate into abstaining from
drinking, avoiding wearing tight or immodest clothing
and not dating, difficult standards to adhere to if peers
hold different values.
For example, last summer, MS AN distributed a survey
titled, "What does Stanford know about Islam?"
"About 100 people across campus filled it out," said
MS AN president Mai El-Sadany 'll. "When asked what
people thought about when they saw the hijab, or head
scarf, the most common responses were: 'She's probably
oppressed; I wonder if she's forced to wear it; I wonder if
she's hot.'"
Almojel said his passion to help the community was in
spired by a peer who helped him when he studied at Van
derbilt as an international student from Saudi Arabia and
by the value he places in his faith.
To Almojel, being Muslim is about a "feeling that you
are connected directly to God, and no one has power over
you except God it gives me a lot of freedom. It helps
me make sure I'm on the right path."
Although Almojel returned to his home country to
work for the company that funded his Stanford studies, he
is sad to leave the University and the people he has be
come so close to.
"Stanford grows on you, and it's very difficult to leave
this place," Almojel said.
He has only one wish for the community that has been
such an important part of his time at Stanford: that it will
"have the wisdom to remain cohesive and discuss the
things that matter most."

The Havana Room of the Graduate Community
Center is filled with friends and family sitting
around dinner tables covered in red table
cloths. An expanse of food is laid out in the back
of the room, with everything from chicken
masala, to kebabs, to korma, to naan.
Friends reunite after a summer away from campus, and
little girls in sundresses are playing with balloons that
have fallen on the floor. Outside of the doorway, young
Muslim women wearing saris pull out high heels from
their handbags and change out of their flats before enter
ing the room. It is the annual Eid celebration at Stanford,
one of the largest gatherings co-organized by the Muslim
Student Awareness Network (MSAN) and the Islamic
Society of Stanford University (ISSU), in celebration of
the end of Ramadan.
Boisterous conversation dies down as students make
speeches at the podium. Next in line is a first-year Stan
ford Law student, Omar Shakir 'O7, who takes the floor to
bid farewell to Ibrahim Almojel, a recent graduate of
Stanford's Ph.D. program in Management Science and
Engineering (MS&E), who made nothing short of a
tremendous impact on the Stanford Muslim community.
"He helped people detained in airports," Shakir said of
Almojel, a soft-spoken 31-year-old sitting near the front
of the room with his wife, Sara, and one-year-old son,
Saad. "His car was the community car ... He was the big
brother I never had."
Shakir announced that in honor of Almojel's contribu
tions, the community's Muslim-American Scholarship
Award will be named in Almojel's honor.
When Shakir handed Almojel the microphone at the
front of the room, Almojel was speechless for a few mo
ments, moved to tears.
"The beautiful thing about this community," Almojel
finally said, "is that I feel I know everyone here this is
our family."
For the past six and a half years, Almojel, known
among Muslims on campus as "grandfather," has been
working tirelessly behind the scenes to build a cohesive
Muslim family that is engaged with the rest of campus, a
challenge without a community center or a full-time staff
member.
"When I first came, it was a place to pray and say
Salaam," Almojel said of joining the community. "After
being involved, it became my life."
Some of Almojel's contributions could only be noticed
at the micro level, like ensuring that a room on the third
floor of Old Union is reserved every quarter for Friday Ju
mu'ah prayer.
Other efforts were more noticeable, like working to
preserve the independence of MSAN, whose emphasis
lies in engaging both Muslim and non-Muslim students in
exploring social and political issues, from the ISSU, which
focuses on students' personal religious lives.
Other structural changes included creating the Muslim
Board, a discussion forum comprised of leaders of MSAN
and ISSU, which enables the two groups to remain in
open, constructive dialogue.
"The Muslim Board helped make sure they had an
aligned, long-term vision for the community," Almojel
said.
Although a Muslim community center is still hypothet
ical, Almojel worked extensively with the University to
establish a center on campus where events could be held,
students could go to relax and visitors could be welcomed.
"I think that the University is in a time of defining what
the community center means," Almojel said. "We're not
an Asian organization or a religious organization. And I
don't think the administration is comfortable with that."
Almojel was ISSU president from 2005 to 2006 and
Chair of the Muslim Board from 2004 to 2006. Yet,
whether or not he was in an official leadership position, he
was a mentor for students and a problem-solver when un
expected situations arose.
For example, when another male Muslim Stanford
graduate student was detained after postponing gradua
tion plans, it was Almojel who collaborated with the Bech
tel International Center to release the student from
