Understanding
The Innovation Ecosystem
Where do great ideas and the ability to implement them come from?
The individuals who built the U.S. technology landscape had one thing in
common a belief that virtually nothing is impossible. Their inventions
often flew in the face of established ideas and "rules" of science and technology.
Join us as some of the Silicon Valley's legendary innovators recount their early
experiences as they developed groundbreaking theories and inventions and
debate how to maintain a healthy innovation ecosystem for the future.
