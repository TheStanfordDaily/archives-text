## Alums aim to shift gay-rights focus 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY MANAGING EDITOR 
Two Stanford alumni, Brian Elliot
'O3 and Patty Buckley M.B.A. 'O9, re
cently launched a social networking
site aimed at mobilizing straight peo
ple for gay rights. The new nonprofit,
Friendfactor, is based in New York.
The site's premise is simple: focus
the gay rights campaign on individu
als instead of on a larger, impersonal
movement. Both Elliot, the founder,
and Buckley, the COO, referenced a
CBS poll that claimed 77 percent of
Americans have someone close to
them who is gay a statistic they say
provides an impetus for their grass
roots effort.
"Gay rights aren't important to
people, but gay friends are," Elliot
said. "We want to amass large
amounts of friends who want to help
friends."
"If you change the rhetoric from
'gay people' to a friend's name, it res
onates differently," Buckley said. "It's
all about the framing."
The site is set up to have two types

of users: "advocates" people
deeply devoted to the cause, regard
less of orientation and "support
ers," who join to help. Advocates can
call on their supporters for aid in a va
riety of ways, from voting on referen
dums to participating in public educa
tion campaigns, which could consist of
as little as a Facebook status.
"For supporters, it's 10 or 15 min
utes a month to help their friends get
full legal freedoms faster," Elliot said.
The page itself aims for simplicity:
"gay" is used instead of "LGBT," be
cause, Elliot reasons, fewer people un
derstand the acronym. In addition,
Facebook Connect is used as the
means of networking, so members are
not prompted to do much legwork.
The ultimate goal is to rapidly
speed up the movement's rate of
change. At its current progress, Elliot
said, gay Americans will have full
rights in no fewer than 10 years. By
creating peer-to-peer accountability
a tactic that, he said, has never
been properly or fully implemented
Elliot hopes to achieve equal free
doms in far less time.

But Elliot wonders, "How much
less?" The question dates back to the
site's origins in late 2009, when Elliot,
who is out, asked his friends a ques
tion: "What would it take for me to
have equal rights in three years?"
"It was pie in the sky, but it mobi
lized a lot of energy," he said. "Young,
straight folks haven't been asked to
do too much before."
He said that once he explained
that gay rights extended beyond mar
riage —he referenced laws in 29
states that allow for homosexuals to
be fired from their jobs simply be
cause of their sexual orientation
his friends were eager to get engaged.
He then started a Facebook group,
"Give Brian Equality." He invited 600
friends; 300 joined. Within four weeks,
it had 19,000 members.
He quit his job on Dec, 4,2009, to
become what he calls a "professional
gay." The response, he said, has been
overwhelmingly positive. So far,
Friendfactor has raised $500,000 and
has an advisory board with both high
ranking Democrats and Republicans
on board. The nonprofit has three
full-time employees and a slew of
volunteers. About 10 work in Friend
factor's New York City office.
"These people believe that this
will push the needle," Buckley said.
The site currently has 800 regis
tered beta testers and will have a
soft launch in four to six weeks. Al
though the focus is currently specif
ic to the gay rights movement,
Buckley sees Friendfactor as a
"highly replicable model" for any
host of issues.
"We're trying to mobilize millions
of Americans," Buckley said. "This
will shift the way we think about gay
rights. It's a game changer."
