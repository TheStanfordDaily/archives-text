## EDITORIAL Admission statistics hold lessons 
### 
Last week, both the Committee on Un
dergraduate Admission and Financial
Aid (C-UAFA) and Dean of Admis
sion Richard Shaw made presentations to
the Faculty Senate. Their reports gave an ex
haustive and in-depth look at the driving en
gine of this institution the process of
culling together the next great class of Stan
ford freshmen.
Many of the items covered are the ran
dom statistics uttered at some point during
New Student Orientation. They include ac
ceptance rate for the Class of 2014 (7.2 per
cent!), the gender breakdown (47.6 percent
female for 'l4 and transfers, but 49 percent
for 'l3) and the percent of freshmen who at
tended public school (57.6 percent.)
As quaint as those statistics may appear
when casually thrown about, the fuller con
text of admission and changes to the
process over time highlight what Stan
ford has become over the years. In 1994, with
14,000 total applicants, the University had
an acceptance rate of 20 percent. Sixteen
years later, the annual number of applicants
has swelled to more than twice that. The
graphs lay out plainly the undisputable fact
that the last two to three decades have wit
nessed Stanford's rise to global prominence
in higher education, a fact from which all of
us benefit extensively. The 49 states and 54
different countries represented in the Class
of 2014 further cement this case.
Even with our ascent, the data also show
that we have not yet conquered the big
three: Harvard, Yale and Princeton. While
the yield rate climbed to its highest-ever
peak of 71 percent, almost two thirds of stu
dents who are accepted by both Harvard
and Stanford flock to Cambridge. These
numbers are improving to our advantage,
with accepted students breaking evenly be

tween the Farm and Yale, but our consistent
positioning behind the Big Three in nation
al rankings seems to have a bit of support
from the admission data analysis.
Two particularly fascinating points of dis
cussion raised by the C-UAFA dealt with
the same underlying issue of whom exactly
Stanford is targeting for acceptance. First,
the committee last year reviewed language
in its charge that refers to the admission pol
icy about criteria the University uses when
giving "special consideration" to applicants.
The Faculty Senate approved the commit
tee's revised charge, including reference to
that policy, last week.
The first of those criteria for "special con
sideration": "those applicants whose par
ents graduated from Stanford." As the Uni
versity has reconceived itself in recent years,
the place and prominence of "legacies"
stands as a discussion topic that deserves at
tention.
Second, the committee is actively target
ing potential humanities majors. With
Shaw's statistics showing a mere 18 percent
of freshmen even considering the humani
ties, C-UAFA noted "the declining numbers
of Stanford students majoring in the human
ities and arts." And when cross-referenced
with the dual-acceptance figures, the only
schools Stanford loses students to are insti
tutions, such as Flarvard, with flourishing
humanities programs, whereas we fair com
petitively, or better, against heavy technical
schools.
These figures, while wonkish and dry as sin
to many, speak to what our University has be
come and where it plans to go. The editorial
board encourages the whole campus to take
a deep look at the admission process and to
help articulate a dialogue about what the
freshmen classes years to come will look like.
