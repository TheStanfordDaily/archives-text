# THE

## Coming Out: It's Not Just For LGBT People 
### Cristopher Bautista 
So I'm one of those really lucky people
who had to come out twice (because, of
course, coming out once wasn't fun
enough). My earliest memory regarding my
gender identity occurred when I was in pre
school I'd be changing, and I most vividly
remember that I'd look down and I most con
fidently thought that I'd eventually get the
boy parts I'd always wanted, maybe as a
Christmas present. If Santa Claus could get
some little girl a pony, then he could sure as
hell give me boy parts. (Of course, once puber
ty came along, I ended up more than a bit dis
appointed.)
My second most vivid memory happened
when I was in seventh grade. Gwen Araujo, a
transwoman who lived in the neighborhood
where I went to middle school, was brutally
murdered one night by several men when they
found out her biological sex. Her story made
national headlines, and her funeral was at my
parish. The story terrified me as a 12-year-old
for the first time, I saw someone I identified
with, someone whose mind and body didn't
quite match. And she ended up murdered be
cause of it, and this all happened within a mile
or two of my school, a place I thought was safe.
It probably was one of the reasons I didn't
come out as transgender for so long.
I first came out as lesbian during my first
year of high school. The word "lesbian" didn't
quite feel right, but I knew that I was attracted
to women, and "lesbian" was the only word
that fit best at the time, and I guess it was also

a "safer" word to hide behind, one that people
understood more and didn't require so much
explaining.
It wasn't until fall quarter of my sopho
more year at Stanford, when I got involved
with the No on Prop. 8 campaign and the
queer community, that I finally had a safe
space to explore my gender identity. I came
out as Cristopher Marc during the winter
quarter of my sophomore year. My friends
and family accepted me almost instantly, and
because of that, I will never take them for
granted.
One of the big decisions I had to come to
terms with during my coming out period was
how "out" I wanted to be. As a transman, I
have the blessing of "passing" meaning, if I
wanted to, I could blend into the general pop
ulation, and no one would know how I was
born. Not to mention I'd live a much safer life

I wouldn't have to worry so much about
hate crimes or meeting an unpleasant end. I
