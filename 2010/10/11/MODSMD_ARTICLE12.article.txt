# THE 						TRANSITIVE PROPERTY
## Coming Out: It's Not Just For LGBT People 
### Cristopher Bautista 
So I'm one of those really lucky people
who had to come out twice (because, of
course, coming out once wasn't fun
enough). My earliest memory regarding my
gender identity occurred when I was in pre
school I'd be changing, and I most vividly
remember that I'd look down and I most con
fidently thought that I'd eventually get the
boy parts I'd always wanted, maybe as a
Christmas present. If Santa Claus could get
some little girl a pony, then he could sure as
hell give me boy parts. (Of course, once puber
ty came along, I ended up more than a bit dis
appointed.)
My second most vivid memory happened
when I was in seventh grade. Gwen Araujo, a
transwoman who lived in the neighborhood
where I went to middle school, was brutally
murdered one night by several men when they
found out her biological sex. Her story made
national headlines, and her funeral was at my
parish. The story terrified me as a 12-year-old
for the first time, I saw someone I identified
with, someone whose mind and body didn't
quite match. And she ended up murdered be
cause of it, and this all happened within a mile
or two of my school, a place I thought was safe.
It probably was one of the reasons I didn't
come out as transgender for so long.
I first came out as lesbian during my first
year of high school. The word "lesbian" didn't
quite feel right, but I knew that I was attracted
to women, and "lesbian" was the only word
that fit best at the time, and I guess it was also

a "safer" word to hide behind, one that people
understood more and didn't require so much
explaining.
It wasn't until fall quarter of my sopho
more year at Stanford, when I got involved
with the No on Prop. 8 campaign and the
queer community, that I finally had a safe
space to explore my gender identity. I came
out as Cristopher Marc during the winter
quarter of my sophomore year. My friends
and family accepted me almost instantly, and
because of that, I will never take them for
granted.
One of the big decisions I had to come to
terms with during my coming out period was
how "out" I wanted to be. As a transman, I
have the blessing of "passing" meaning, if I
wanted to, I could blend into the general pop
ulation, and no one would know how I was
born. Not to mention I'd live a much safer life

I wouldn't have to worry so much about
hate crimes or meeting an unpleasant end. I

could lead a normal life. And for a
while, I'll tell you the truth, that's
what I wanted.
But we are at a moment of crisis.
This isn't the time to live a normal
life. Maybe I could settle down later,
but not now. In a world where LGB
youth are four times more likely to
attempt suicide than their hetero
sexual peers and where almost half
of trans youth have seriously con
templated suicide, this is not a world
where I can hide behind a short hair
cut and a male name. This is a world
where something needs to be done,

and it needs to be done now.
Today is National Coming Out
Day. Today is a day where we are
meant to celebrate the experiences
of queer people, but instead, we are
reflecting on a recent string of sui
cides committed by queer youth. I
find it terrifying, the fact that young
people are taking their lives out of
a fear, out of a hopelessness that
things will not get better. They're
people like me, people whom I
identify with, people whom I wish I
had known so I could reach out to
them.
What's scary is that I've been
there. I have friends who have been
there. And I'll tell you the truth
it's scary as hell, recalling those mo
ments at four in the morning, feeling
terrified, trapped, hopeless, and the

only way out is jumping off some
building or swallowing some pills or
doing something horrible to myself. I
never want anyone else to feel that
way, if I can help it. We don't deserve
to become statistics. We deserve to
be people. This is why I am writing
this column.
So happy National Coming Out
Day, Stanford. This isn't just for
queer people to come out of the
closet. This is for you to come out
too. Hold a sign. Start a conversa
tion. Be out for someone who can't
be out for themselves yet. Some
times that makes all the difference.
