Responses to Editorial on Victor Davis
Hanson

Ed. note: In response to the Oct. 7 editorial
"Hoover Institution should renounce Han
son's racist remarks," Victor Davis Hanson
Ph.D. 'Boposted a criticism on his blog and The
Daily received dozens of critical letters. A sam
ple of those letters, limited by our space con
straints, is below. More letters are on our web
site, stanforddaily.com. Unsigned editorials, as
always, represent the views of the editorial
board and do not necessarily reflect the opin
ions of the Daily staff. Please see the full policy
beneath today's editorial.

Your caustic screed against Victor Hanson
is a routine embarrassment to Stanford Uni
versity, your apparent intellectual inbreeding
leading to unwarranted overconfidence pro
ducing sanctimonious posturing which so
gaudily illustrates the "one size fits all" cogni

tion of America's future thought police officer
corps. If only there were substantive intellec
tual diversity in your environs, you'd have re
alized before humiliating yourselves that
Hanson's comments are at once more sub
stantive and more restrained than your puta
tive critique, and your efforts to demand intel
lectual compliance —so characteristic of
race/gender/class ideologues will, in a free
thinking world, carry only as much weight as
their underlying arguments will sustain, which
is to say, a featherweight, in orbit.
JOHNRYLANDER
That editorial was sophomoric, at best, but
then, I suppose some of the staff are, indeed,
sophomores. In fact, after reading both the ed
itorial and the article it was unhappy with (in
both incarnations), I find that the editorialists
quite obviously misunderstood the
arguments of Hanson (either deliber
ately or not) and then wrote an edito
rial in the very vein for which they (in
correctly) attacked Hanson. Is your
answer for him to just shut up? Or
might you consider making counter
arguments instead of calling names.
Actually, I now see I was wrong.
This piece was not sophomoric, at
least in the sense of college sopho
mores, it has much more in common
with the behaviors more commonly
found in junior high schools.

JAMES IVERS

Your claims are baseless, unsup
ported by fact and McCarthyite in im
plication. This is regardless of my
level of agreement with Mr. Hansen's
opinions.
Sadly it is this precious sophomor
ic pedantry that I've come to expect
from our so-called elite institutions. I

used to run recruiting for a global
consulting company, we prized Stan
ford graduates.
I for one repent of the regard I
once held for the Leland Stanford Ju
nior University.

BILL REEVES

Brown Shirts ... all of you. To
take the words of an intellect like Vic
tor. D. Hanson ... and twist those
words into racial slurs when they are
anything but... and then to demand
that he be silenced by his colleagues
in a setting and organization that is
supposed to breed dialogue and view
points from many directions and per
spectives?
You are Brown Shirts.
If you wonder why the Tea Party
exists... It is in response to three
decades of fascist idiots like you.

BRIAN C.KUHN

Your editorial written against Vic
tor Davis Hanson is the most coward
ly, ill-advised screed I have ever seen
in a paper associated with an institute
of higher learning. Bar none.

You and you institution have a lot
to answer for. That you are charged
with teaching the youth of our coun
try makes me literally sick to my
stomach.

JEANNE PATTERSON

I am appalled by your editorial.
That kind of knee jerk demonization
of anyone who questions race-con
scious resource allocation by power
ful institutions is daily becoming less
and less convincing. Time to stop
playing the race card and start mak
ing real arguments.
