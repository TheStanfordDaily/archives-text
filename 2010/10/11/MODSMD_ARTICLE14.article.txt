# STETHOSCOPES, COMPILERS AND HEMINGWAY
## Dim Meta Writing 
### Aaditya Shidham 
Caution for the next half-dozen para
graphs, you may find half-baked writ
ing. That's right kids this week's in
stallment is worse than usual! Why? It's an ex
periment to write about the writing process. I
have spent some time thinking about what I
will write about, but the actual text that fol
lows this paragraph comes naked an unfil
tered dump from the thoughts of my mind to
the letters you see before you. I will do little
editing to the sentences that follow this para
graph, other than those obvious mistakes of
grammar or spelling. Hopefully, you readers
will make sense of the nonsensical, and send
me your thoughts.
When I was a kid, I imagined that I could
fly and, in mid-flight, freeze time with my very
will. I imagined that I could drop to the
ground, stare at a person in the middle of a
conversation, mid-word, and appreciate his or
her entire life through that look. I imagined
myself with blue flannel pajamas, no glasses
I finally had 20/20 vision and swimming
fins, because I could also go underwater mid
flight and stare at fish in mid-gaze as well.
That is a story I like to tell about the dreams
about my youth. The following is not.
As a more devout Hindu back then, I also
imagined that I was reincarnated and I re
member vividly having a dream that laid out
for me utter, undeniable empirical proof that I
was a gay, blind penguin swimming alone in

the depths of the Antarctic seas (Side note:
does Antarctica even have seas? What are
they called if they aren't seas then? Is there a
difference between a sea and an ocean?). I
woke up with sweaty palms and a yelp.
I know why may you care about the use
less dreams of my past? That's right I didn't
think you did. Isn't it annoying when someone
else tells you something that personal? Yes?
OK, good. Let me tell you some more things
that feed my narcissism. You are free to stop
reading anytime.
This is my duality very hard, witty, sar
castic on the outside, and soft like a mellow,
castrated bumblebee on the inside. (Another
side note: again, castration here is not a refer
ence to genitalia at all. I think castration is the
best word to describe what happens to the last
horrible hours of a bumblebee's life when
their intestines and stinger are ripped out of
them all at once. Stop reading now, and give
thanks that you are not a bee.)
Now for more wittiness: look down at this
column. Now look up. No? How about this?
Coco is a horrible nickname for Conan
O'Brien. It sounds so effeminate and passive
so wait, never mind ...
Why is the sky blue? And why aren't more
people from Stanford on Reddit? Does any
one else secretly hate the Class of 2014?
What assholes younger, better-looking,
more accomplished. And now they live in a

room where I once vomited. It is probably
the most explicit example of the young push
ing out the old. It makes me think of when my
own children will push me into a nursing
home. Yes, that's right Crothers is the
nursing home in the Stanford housing hierar
chy! Huzzah!
I think that the best window for work is 20-
minute chunks. Some people say that this is
too short for most genius Stanford students.
My opinion? It's enough time for me to do ge
nius work... so there. I must have turned
back and forth from the same problem set 15
times this weekend. Its challenges never
forced me to question my own life choices, or
consider the utterly illogical teaching choices
of certain unnamed Stanford departments of
science and engineering, or question my own
validity in the class and mourn the passing of
the drop deadline. No I got my work done
with little stress, and lots of learning and cre
ation packed in little, cute packets of joy no,
not joy, more like packets of red chili peppers.
Sadistic joy, I guess.
You know what I want sometimes? I want

to sit at the end of a bar and have an
old white geezer with a top hat laugh
at my stupid jokes all day. I want him
to follow me around on the streets of
New York, down major thorough-

fares, and just laugh so hard that
sometimes he will seem like he is

going to have a heart attack. I will feed
him with money and food. That is all.
See? I have waxed ironic, academ
ic, poetic and just plain stupid in one
swell rush of my pen. I wrote this way
this week only because I wanted to
hear from my readers. So please,
readers, tell me what you think. How
did my experiment in creative writing
go? Does it look good naked?

Please do write! I want to read. Drop
me a line at ashidham@stanford.edu.
