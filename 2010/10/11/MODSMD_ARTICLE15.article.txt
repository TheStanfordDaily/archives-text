## ResEd Won't Ask, Just Tells 
### 
My name is Brandon Jackson, a junior
and resident assistant (RA) in Cas
tano. I'm writing in response to the
recent changes Residential Education
(ResEd) has made with the hiring of its stu
dent staff members. The changes, announced
in an e-mail to current RAs Friday afternoon,
were a shock, to say the least, and have left
me quite concerned.
During RA training this summer, there
was a great deal of rhetoric from the ResEd
staff reminding us of how integral we were to
the success of ResEd as a whole. It is the RAs,
after all, who live and work in the residences
to build the desired intellectual and educa
tional living communities on this campus.
That said, in efforts to hire the best staff, I find
it disappointing that, to my knowledge, no
current RA or student staff member was con
sulted or even made aware of these drastic
hiring changes until now. This certainly
doesn't resemble the move away from bu

reaucracy that some of the newest ResEd
staff members spoke so proudly of during
RA training. There are a number of issues in
the new (and not improved) hiring system,
but I will limit this letter to a few of them.
First, the announcement stressed that one
of the key goals was to initiate an additional
class model of RA training to take place dur
ing spring quarter giving RAs "more time
to reflect on the role and how to engage in a
residential setting." I would really like to take
a look at the RA training survey data from
the summer or, even better, hold an open
forum to talk to current RAs to really hash
out the many problems that exist in RA train
ing. However, I'm fairly confident that the
main issues did not stem from not having
enough time to develop fully functional staff
members. If anything, there was more time
wasted in workshops and presentations that
did little to prepare student staff for the many
challenges that arise in the RA role.
The most sensible response to an existing
inadequate training is not to create room for
more insufficient training. Moreover, if there
was any pro to coming back during the sum
mer, it was that most, if not all, of my time was
dedicated to becoming the best RA I could

be. Adding a course in the spring as students
are already taking full loads of classes, extra
curricular activities and athletics, etc., in the
name of giving students "more time to re
flect" simply does not make sense.
One point was offered that by making stu
dents apply by the new Dec. 3 deadline (dur
ing dead week), they would not be backed
into corners concerning the Draw. I can't
speak for everyone, but I certainly don't re
call any of my peer RAs being backed into
any corners greater than the one anyone who
wishes to become an RA now finds himself
or herself backed into. I've spent three weeks
with residents in my current dorm striving to
do everything I can to make it a place we all
can call home (Casta-No-Place-Like-Home).
And now it's time to start thinking about not
only where I'm living, but also staffing next
year! Oh, and about going abroad? Well, I
guess I have to finalize that soon too. This, of
course, is not even to mention the question of
if I want to staff next year a question I was
looking forward to exploring over the next
two quarters in my current role as an RA.
Coming full circle, I have to ask: where
was the student input in this deci
sion? Where were the inquiries into
how students would be affected by
changes that will undoubtedly have
many adverse consequences for
those interested in becoming a stu
dent staff member? I'm pleased that
ResEd is coming to current staff to
get us to spread the word of the new
hiring system, recognizing how
deeply we are positioned into the
living communities on this campus.
However, I sincerely wish that we,
instead of pure advertisers, were
also looked upon as fruitful advisers
to the Stanford Residential Educa
tion program. I certainly would have
jumped at the opportunity, as would
many others, had we only been
asked.
