## OUSTED IN OVERTIME 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
This weekend, the Stanford men's
soccer team opened up the road edition
of its 2010 Pac-10 campaign against two
northwestern opponents. The Card hung
with a tough Washington team (7-4-1,1-
3-0 Pac-10) for the first 45 minutes, but
gave up two quick goals to open the sec
ond half and fell 2-0 on Friday night in
Seattle.

Sunday afternoon looked like it
would be more of the same for Stanford
(5-6,1-2), as the team extended its score
less streak to 280 minutes and headed
into double overtime against Oregon
State (6-5,1-3) in Corvallis. But a golden
goal by senior forward Dominique
Yahyavi clinched the victory for Stan
ford and sent the team back to the Farm
with a weekend split.

Redshirt freshman Galen Perkins saw
his first collegiate action Friday night,
starting in place of injured redshirt fresh
man goalie Jason Dodson. Perkins
played well, making two saves in the first
half to keep the Huskies at bay. Yet he
was unable to stop veteran senior for
ward Matt Van Houten, who broke free
of the defense minutes into the second
half. Van Houten first headed in a cross
from the right side in the 46th minute and
went on to beat Perkins again, this time
on a one-on-one from the left side
Perkins was helpless both times.
Despite the two goals, the defense
generally held up well against a potent
Washington attack in front of a large
crowd at Husky Stadium. The Huskies
fell from the national rankings after a
wild 4-3 overtime loss to No. 25 San
Diego State last week, but were unbeat
en in seven straight matches earlier in the
year. That streak includes a crucial 4-1
victory over then-No. 15 Portland.
The Stanford offense, however, was
out of sync all night the Cardinal mus
tered just four shots, half of which came
from defenders.

After a day off on Saturday, the Car
dinal headed south to Corvallis to face
Oregon State. The Beavers were coming
off a 5-0 shelling by Cal on Friday night
at home, but they still managed to put up
a great fight and outshot Stanford 4-1 in
the second half. Both teams lacked ener-

gy, and the crowd of 800 saw a defensive
struggle through steady rain throughout
most of regulation.
Perkins again stepped up and made a
number of crucial saves, including two to
keep Stanford alive in the first overtime.

Head coach Bret Simon was im
pressed with his young backup keeper.
"Galen Perkins did an excellent job
starting the first two games of his college
career," he said.

Perkins made nine saves over the
weekend and appears likely to feature
frequently in goal for the Cardinal with
Dodson's return still unclear.
After the first overtime finished score
less, the Stanford offense finally got into
gear. In the 107 th minute, sophomore for
ward Adam Jahn found himself free with
the ball and fired a shot that goalkeeper
Steve Spangler parried away. But senior
Dominique Yahyavi pounced on the re
bound and fired the ball into an empty
net for his fifth goal of the season and his
second game-winning goal of the year.
Stanford will resume Pac-10 play next
weekend, when it welcomes UCLA and
San Diego State to the Farm. The Cardi
nal will face off against the Bruins on Fri
day night, before playing a Sunday after
noon game against the Aztecs.
