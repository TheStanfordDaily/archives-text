# CRIMSON CAN'T COMPETE
## Harvard heads home after Cardinal shutout 
### NICK SU 
A strong performance in the second
period led the No. 17 Stanford field hock
ey team (8-3,3-1 NorPac) to a 6-0 shutout
over a struggling Harvard squad last Fri
day at the Varsity Turf. Hie Stanford
women held Harvard to zero shots in that
period after coming off a 4-2 victory over
No. 8 Wake Forest and a 2-1 overtime win
against UC-Davis last weekend. Harvard,
on the other hand, came into the game
having won only one of its last eight
matches.
Less than two minutes into the first
half, a right-side cross from junior forward
Stephanie Byrne led to a tap-in goal for
sophomore forward Alysha Sekhon and a
quick 1-0 lead for the Card. However,
Stanford was unable to capitalize on its
initial lead until the end of the first period.
Fortunately for the Cardinal, Har
vard's offensive effort was unsuccessful,
as the Crimson missed its only two shots
of the game a penalty corner lobbed
wide of the left post and another shot
missing to the right.

GAME NOTES: The No. 1 7 Cardinal field hockey
team shutout Harvard 6-0 at home last Friday. The
Crimson's subdued offense was no match for Stan
ford's aggressive possessions. The Card now
heads on an East Coast tour to face No. 9 Syra
cuse, Rutgers and Northeastern next weekend.

But in the second half, Stanford
would strike early once again, with
a goal by sophomore defender
Becky Dru in the 41st minute. Scor
ing off a penalty corner shot, the
goal was Dru's fourth of the season.
Fifteen minutes into the second
half, Stanford pulled ahead to a
solid 4-0 lead, with goals by senior
defender Katherine Donner and
senior midfielder Xanthe Travlos,
assisted by senior forward Kather
ine Swank and Dru, respectively.
The Cardinal would end the match
with two more goals by Byrne and
Donner.
Donner's two goals were her first
of the season, and Byrne contributed
to the second-half Cardinal effort

with two assists.
In a dominant offensive display
by Stanford, the team managed to
outshoot the visiting Harvard squad
22-2. Along with a 10-0 difference in
second half penalty corners, this
dominance kept the ball predomi
nantly in Stanford possession and
gave little action to the Cardinal de
fenders. Redshirt freshman Julia
LaSalvia and junior Allessandra
Moss split time at the goalkeeper
position.
With five games left in its regu
lar season, the field hockey team is
headed for three games on the
road, beginning with No. 9 Syracuse
(8-4) this Friday. The team's East
Coast tour will continue with
matches at Rutgers (5-9) and
Northeastern (6-7) the following
Sunday and Monday.
