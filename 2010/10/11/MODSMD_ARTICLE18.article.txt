# CRIMSON CAN'T COMPETE
## Harvard heads home after Cardinal shutout 
### NICK SU 
A strong performance in the second
period led the No. 17 Stanford field hock
ey team (8-3,3-1 NorPac) to a 6-0 shutout
over a struggling Harvard squad last Fri
day at the Varsity Turf. Hie Stanford
women held Harvard to zero shots in that
period after coming off a 4-2 victory over
No. 8 Wake Forest and a 2-1 overtime win
against UC-Davis last weekend. Harvard,
on the other hand, came into the game
having won only one of its last eight
matches.
Less than two minutes into the first
half, a right-side cross from junior forward
Stephanie Byrne led to a tap-in goal for
sophomore forward Alysha Sekhon and a
quick 1-0 lead for the Card. However,
Stanford was unable to capitalize on its
initial lead until the end of the first period.
Fortunately for the Cardinal, Har
vard's offensive effort was unsuccessful,
as the Crimson missed its only two shots
of the game a penalty corner lobbed
wide of the left post and another shot
missing to the right.
