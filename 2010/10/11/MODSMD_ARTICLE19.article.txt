# No respect for field rushers
## 
### Daniel Bohm On My Mind 
I apologize in advance to my loyal
readers who will recognize that
this column is awfully similar to
one I wrote after Stanford beat
Notre Dame last year. I also
apologize for being a downer, because
really, I should be celebrating Stan
ford's resiliency in beating USC on
Saturday. But of course, Stanford stu
dents had to go screw it up.
This is an open challenge to any
person who ran onto the field after
Stanford's win to e-mail me a legiti
mately good reason why you did so. If
you do, I will do something any
thing of your choice, to match the
embarrassment you brought upon all
of us by looking like a clown after the
game. That isn't going to happen
though, because a good reason does
not exist.

Stanford students are so consistent
ly out of touch with sports reality that it
never ceases to amaze me. Did you
know, Mister or Miss Field-Rusher,
that USC is unranked, on probation
and has 15 fewer scholarship players
than Stanford? Or that USC lost last
week to a very mediocre Washington
team and that Stanford was favored in
this game by more than a touchdown?
When you rush the field, you tell
the other team that you didn't expect
to win the game, and that you think
they are better than you. You are es
sentially saying that particular win is
more special than all the other wins.
When Oregon beat Stanford last
week, I found solace in the fact that
very few idiotic Oregon fans rushed
the field. I thought, "Wow, they really
think we are a hell of a team." USC
doesn't deserve that distinction.
I have a newsflash for you Stan
ford is better than USC. This isn't the
2007 upset when Stanford was a 41-
point underdog. This is a Stanford
team that is one poorly played second
half away from being undefeated and
ranked in the top five.
I haven't talked to anyone on the
team about it, but I don't know how I
would feel about the field rush if I were
a player. Sure, the crowd was active last
night. It wasn't Death Valley-loud, but
for Stanford, it was impressive. People
didn't leave around halftime and even
the Axe Committee people managed
not to yell at the wrong times (hint:
when Stanford has the ball). But how
many games does the team have to win
before fans start expecting to win?
Some coaches tell their teams that
when they score a touchdown, they
should hand the ball to the referee and
act like they had been there before.
When will Stanford fans act like they
have been there before? We have beaten
USC three out of the past four seasona
We have been ranked for most of the
season. We went to a bowl game last year.
I got a text message from a friend
who went to the University of Maryland
a school that may not have a great
football team, but has fans that under
stand sports that read, "Good win
but u should be ashamed of yourself for
charging the field." Damn straight.
Ashamed is probably the best word
for it. That or pathetic. I want to be
proud, but instead I'm forced to sit in
my seat and just shake my head. I guess
I can be happy that we aren't Colorado,
one of college football's most storied
programs in the past, and we didn't rush
the field after beating 1-3 Georgia.
So where should we draw the line?
I don't want to delve too deeply into
that topic, because that is what I did in
my column last year after the field
rushing after beating 6-6 Notre Dame.
I will say this, however: if you rush
the field, the team you beat should
have at least been a) ranked higher
than you, b) a top-10 team or c) your
archrival (in our case Cal everyone
hates USC,not just Stanford).
So I'm sorry for being the fun po
lice, but really, if you want to be consid
ered respectable, you have to start de
manding respect. Charging the field
isn't the way to earn it.

Daniel Bohm hates you. Win back his
affection at bohmd@stanford.edu.

Stanford students
are so consistently
out of touch with
sports reality.
