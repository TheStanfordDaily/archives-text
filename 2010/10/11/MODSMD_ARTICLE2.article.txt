## CARD TAKES DOWN TROJANS, AGAIN 
### KABIR SAWHNEY MANAGING EDITOR 
Troy has officially fallen.
The No. 14 Stanford football team hammered anoth
er nail into the coffin of once-proud USC on Saturday
night, defeating the Trojans by a final score of 37-35.
While the game ended in victory for the Cardinal
(5-1,2-1 Pac-10), that outcome was uncertain until the
final few seconds of the game. Despite being a signifi
cant underdog, the Trojans (4-2, 1-2 Pac-10) played
hard throughout the contest, matching the Stanford of
fense point for point behind sophomore quarterback
Matt Barkley.
Stanford eventually won the game on a last-second
field goal from senior kicker Nate Whitaker, who
drilled a kick from 30 yards out as time expired to send
the Card to victory. Whitaker had earlier missed an
extra point wide left, a miss which might have proved

decisive.
"I had to make it," Whitaker said of the final kick. "I
had a chance to redeem myself, and I made it. I'm def
initely glad I got a chance it would have been a
rough night otherwise,
"This is the biggest kick I've ever had," he added. "I
couldn't have done it without the team there, giving me
that chance."
The win allowed Stanford to bounce back from a
tough loss last weekend at then-No. 4 Oregon. The de
feat saw the Cardinal lose its top-10 ranking and
marked its first loss of the season.
"We were definitely aware of our shortcomings last
week," said redshirt sophomore quarterback Andrew
Luck. "We didn't dwell on it, and we tried to improve
upon it. This had to be our half we can't have anoth
er debacle like we did last weekend."
On the flip side, USC was deprived of a revenge op
portunity for last season, when the Cardinal defeated
the Trojans 55-21 in the Coliseum in Los Angeles.
The two teams were fairly evenly matched through
out this game, with the offenses trading scores back

Sophomore running back Stepfan Taylor flies past Trojan defenders in Saturday's tug of war between Pac-10 powers. Despite a disappointing first half and
a missed extra-point kick in the fourth quarter, the Cardinal offense compensated with a power running game and beat USC for the third time in four years.
