# DOWN TO THE WIRE
## CARD TAKES DOWN TROJANS, AGAIN 
### KABIR SAWHNEY MANAGING EDITOR 
Troy has officially fallen.
The No. 14 Stanford football team hammered anoth
er nail into the coffin of once-proud USC on Saturday
night, defeating the Trojans by a final score of 37-35.
While the game ended in victory for the Cardinal
(5-1,2-1 Pac-10), that outcome was uncertain until the
final few seconds of the game. Despite being a signifi
cant underdog, the Trojans (4-2, 1-2 Pac-10) played
hard throughout the contest, matching the Stanford of
fense point for point behind sophomore quarterback
Matt Barkley.
Stanford eventually won the game on a last-second
field goal from senior kicker Nate Whitaker, who
drilled a kick from 30 yards out as time expired to send
the Card to victory. Whitaker had earlier missed an
extra point wide left, a miss which might have proved

decisive.
"I had to make it," Whitaker said of the final kick. "I
had a chance to redeem myself, and I made it. I'm def
initely glad I got a chance it would have been a
rough night otherwise,
"This is the biggest kick I've ever had," he added. "I
couldn't have done it without the team there, giving me
that chance."
The win allowed Stanford to bounce back from a
tough loss last weekend at then-No. 4 Oregon. The de
feat saw the Cardinal lose its top-10 ranking and
marked its first loss of the season.
"We were definitely aware of our shortcomings last
week," said redshirt sophomore quarterback Andrew
Luck. "We didn't dwell on it, and we tried to improve
upon it. This had to be our half we can't have anoth
er debacle like we did last weekend."
On the flip side, USC was deprived of a revenge op
portunity for last season, when the Cardinal defeated
the Trojans 55-21 in the Coliseum in Los Angeles.
The two teams were fairly evenly matched through
out this game, with the offenses trading scores back

GAME NOTES: The No. 16 Stanford football team bounces
back from last weekend's loss to Oregon in a last-second
37-35 win over USC. The Cardinal and the Trojans traded
points and possessions throughout the game but managed
to clinch the victory with a game-ending field goal from sen

mentum through the bye weekend and in to its next Pac-10
match up with Washington State.

Sophomore running back Stepfan Taylor flies past Trojan defenders in Saturday's tug of war between Pac-10 powers. Despite a disappointing first half and
a missed extra-point kick in the fourth quarter, the Cardinal offense compensated with a power running game and beat USC for the third time in four years.
and forth all night.
USC drew first blood in the first quarter when,
taking over after a Stanford punt, it put together an
impressive drive behind a duo of running backs
senior Allen Bradford and freshman Dillon Baxter.
Bradford provided the bulk of the carries for the
Trojans, while Baxter served well as a secondary tail
back primarily out of the "wildcat" formation he
scored the Trojans' first touchdown of the game by
knifing through the Stanford front seven virtually
untouched on his way into the end zone.
The Cardinal responded quickly, scoring a
touchdown of its own on a pass from Luck to jun
ior receiver Chris Owusu.
The two teams continued to trade points and
possession throughout the first half. Stanford
squandered opportunities to pull ahead twice, as
two fumbles deep inside USC territory cost it
dearly. However, the Cardinal defense was also
opportunistic, managing to force a fumble of its
own early in the second quarter that prevented the
Trojans from adding to their tally.
The score at halftime a 14-14 draw was
indicative of the kind of close battle the teams
were waging. Nevertheless, Luck saw room for im
provement.
"We were a little disappointed as a unit at half
time," he said. "We had a couple of suicide plays,
fumbling the ball. We had the motivation to come
out and put points up on the board every time we
went out there."
Indeed, Stanford's offense came out early in
the third quarter and looked ready to dominate
the rest of the game. After getting the ball back on
a USC punt, Luck and his offense took the ball and
pounded the Trojans with their power running
game, scoring a touchdown on a long, 14-play
drive that went 93 yards down the field. After a
made extra point, Stanford took a 21-14 lead.
USC's offense took the field and responded in
kind, scoring a quick touchdown on a 61-yard pass
from Barkley to freshman receiver Robert Woods
to knot the score at 21 apiece. Woods would even
tually grab 12 receptions on the night for 224 yards
and three touchdowns, becoming the first player
in the country this year with over 200 yards receiv
ing and at least three touchdowns.
After another touchdown exchange, the score
stood at 28-28 a few minutes into the fourth quar
ter. A huge kickoff return from Owusu to USC's
12-yard line (with six more yards tacked on for a
horse-collar penalty) gave Luck tremendous field
position. He did not disappoint, threading a pass to
senior receiver Doug Baldwin in the end zone.
Stanford went up 34-28 after Whitaker missed the
extra point, only his third PAT miss on the season.
With time running out, USC head coach Lane
Kiffin elected to try to convert a fourth-and-10 at
the Stanford 32-yard line. However, Barkley
couldn't complete his pass, turning the ball over to
the Cardinal on downs. Stanford looked ready to
seal the game another touchdown could have
easily put it out of reach for USC.
Instead, sophomore running back Stepfan Tay

lor, the main tailback in Stanford's offense, fum
bled the ball near midfield, and after a video re
view, officials confirmed that the ball belonged to
USC. This time, Stanford's defense couldn't come
up with a stop, and the Trojans went down the field
and put another touchdown on the board courtesy
of an Allen Bradford one-yard run. A converted
extra point gave the Trojans a slim 35-34 lead.
After a short Owusu kickoff return, the Cardi
nal took over on its own 26-yard line with 1:02 re
maining in the game. Luck then engineered a
quick-strike drive that went 62 yards in six plays,
helped by a 15-yard personal foul on Trojan line
backer Chris Galippo. As the clock ran out,
Whitaker nailed the 30-yard field goal, giving
Stanford the 37-35 win and sending the sellout
crowd at Stanford Stadium into a delirium.
After the game, Stanford head coach Jim Har
baugh remained extremely enthused.
"We felt like we could be game winners if we did
n't give in, if we didn't quit," he said. "There were big
hurdles and obstacles that had to be overcome, and
to a man, everyone on our team did that. As a head
coach, I couldn't be more proud of everybody."
Both passers had very strong games. Barkley
finished with 390 yards and three touchdowns (all
to Woods) on 28-45 passing, while Luck went 20-
24 for 285 yards and three touchdowns of his own.
Neither quarterback threw an interception.
"People that have doubted Andrew Luck do
not know football," Harbaugh said. "He is a bril
liant leader, and he played his heart out once again

â€”he was as poised as you can be in the two
minute drive [at the game's end]."
Stanford's rushing attack was also a key to its
success, which Harbaugh went to repeatedly
throughout the game, Taylor, who has emerged
from Stanford's early "backfield-by-committee"
approach as the go-to back for the Stanford of
fense, had 23 carries, 104 yards and a touchdown
run, and freshman Anthony Wilkerson added a
touchdown run of his own.
Harbaugh also had plenty of praise for USC.
"[USC] played a great game," he said. "This
was a great college football game."
"To beat a great team like USC three out of
four years is a great milestone," he continued. "I
really gained a lot of respect for Matt Barkley, for
his play.The Trojans played a tremendous football
game."
With Stanford's bye week coming up, Har
baugh said that he will give the Cardinal some
time off this week.
For Luck, it will just be more time to savor beat
ing the Trojans.
When asked whether it was more fun to beat
USC at home or in Los Angeles, he laughed and
replied, "That's a good question... I'm not going
to answer that one."
