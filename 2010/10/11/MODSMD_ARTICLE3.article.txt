# Changes come to RA app process
## Prospective resident assistants will apply during fall quarter 
### BRANDON POWELL 
Stanford students hoping to be
resident assistants (RAs) must
now apply during fall quarter in
stead of spring; meanwhile, resi
dent fellows and Row student staff
will have more time to interview
prospective RAs, marking signifi
cant changes for the staffing time
line.
Also awaiting successful appli
cants is a new training class for
RAs, a change set to take effect
during the 2011-12 school year.
Associate Dean of Residential
Education (ResEd) Jennifer
Calvert announced the changes to
resident fellows (RFs) and college
directors (CDs) via e-mail on Sept.
27. The establishment of an RA
class is intended to afford future
staff members more time to pre
pare for the position, Calvert told
The Daily.
"They need time to reflect on
the role and how to engage with
the rich teaching and learning that
can happen in a residential set
ting," Calvert wrote in an e-mail to
The Daily. "A class will allow the
opportunity for newly hired RAs
to do this."
The class is set to launch during
the 2011-2012 academic year and
will be required for RAs hired to a
position for the following year.
Speaking about the shift of the
application process to fall quarter,
Calvert expressed concern over
the current conflict between RA
applications and the housing draw,
since sometimes not all staff posi

tions are filled before students
apply for housing.
"At this point, we are putting
applicants and houses in a very dif
ficult position," Calvert said.
In making the process earlier,
Calvert said ResEd is "looking to
create a bit more space to be able
to offer applicants positions dur
ing a reasonable time."
ResEd also is seeking to offer
RFs more time to select dorm staff
members. The interview period for
RA applicants will span five to six
weeks this year.
Florence Moore RF Greg
Watkins said fellows are historical
ly faced with a time constraint in
selecting RAs.
"Something that frustrates RFs
in particular is the crunch of inter
viewing, not interviewing just
RAs, but all staff members,"
Watkins said.
Watkins said it would be more
difficult for applicants to be confi
dent in their decisions so far from
the following year.
"It will make it harder for cur
rent staff who think they might
want to return," Watkins said.
"They might not have a good sense
of whether returning works for
them. The earlier you make the ap
plication process, the more likely
you are to say, 'lt's a neat job. I
want to keep doing it.' Whereas in
the spring, you are more likely to
say, 'OK, one year was enough.'"
While Watkins expressed confi
dence in the upcoming changes,
current and prospective student
staff members voiced curiosity and
apprehension about the changes.
"I'm curious to hear the Univer
sity's response as to how these RA
changes will affect the Row," said
Jon Anderson 'll, an RA in Chi
Theta Chi and prospective cotermi
nal degree applicant. "The early
deadline means that house staff
might not be chosen yet, so I don't
know how they would be able to
pick the RAs. Also, I wouldn't know
if coterms could apply to be RAs,
because they won't know whether
or not they'll even be here next
year."
Tiffany Shih 'll, an RA in Car
denal, said she is concerned that
some of Res Ed's actions may be
misguided.
"ResEd keeps making sponta
neous decisions to change things
without consulting RAs and hear
ing what we have to say," Shih said.
"It seems that they're making a lot
of decisions that seem good only on
paper."
ResEd hopes to address the con
cerns of all involved parties, Calvert
said.
