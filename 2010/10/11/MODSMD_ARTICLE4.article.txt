## Google buys alums' website for millions 
### ZOE LEAVITT SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford alumni Ben Eidelson 'OB M.A. 'OB and Jason
Prado 'OB sold their company last week to Google for an es
timated $6 million.
The pair founded everythinglsTheßest, LLC just last
year, but its ingenuity managed to attract Google's atten
tion. The company hosts a series of projects that "apply
simple technology to real problems," according to the com
pany's website.
Eidelson enrolled at Stanford at age 16 and earned both
his bachelor's and master's degrees in electrical engineer
ing in four years. After graduation, Eidelson and Prado
both worked at Microsoft, where they brainstormed the
idea behind their social networking project.
In Silicon Valley, the image of an overworked computer
science graduate struggling to make the next big website is
common, but Eidelson and Prado seemed to have navigat
ed the startup lifestyle with balance after leaving Mi
crosoft.
"There were no moments of super desperation, but we
definitely adjusted our lifestyle accordingly," Eidelson said
of their decision to close the door on Microsoft in favor of
a big bet on everythinglsTheßest. "Stanford did play a big
part... it tends to instill people with the idea of not feeling
insecure about not having a quote-unquote real job."
"We just threw away the idea of work ... we're just liv
ing life and building things we want to build," he added.
The pair's latest creation, Plannr (now closed), served as
an up-to-the-minute social planning service for use by
small groups of friends. By syncing an address book and
Google Maps, Plannr provided an alternative for text or e
mail streams that can arise around planning a simple cof-
fee date or pizza night.
Plannr faced competition from
Facebook invites, a host of other apps
trying to get iPhone users to hang out
with each other, and simple phone
calls. However, Tech Crunch called
the application "schedule manage
ment for hipsters" and deemed it a
success.

"We didn't think about what was
already out there, because if those
things worked for us, we'd be using
them, and we weren't," Eidelson said.
By taking lessons from their own

experiences, Eidelson and Prado
seem to have successfully captured
the social potential coursing through
the iPhone's circuitry.
Plannr and other everythingls-
Theßest apps have been shut down
following Google's purchase of the
company. Eidelson and Prado will
begin work at Google soon.
"It's definitely going to be a
change to be employees again," Ei
delson said.
Although Stanford is home to
many innovative site founders who
dropped out —including Google
creators Larry Page M.S. '9B and
Sergey Brin M.S. '95, who left their
Ph.D. studies for the company Ei
delson said he was happy to have
completed his degree.

"A lot of things you read, you just
don't end up applying ... you can al
most get inundated with consump
tion of material rather than just doing
stuff," Eidelson said. "I do regret not
doing more projects as a student, with
other students, because I was so over
whelmed with problem sets and day
to-day work."
Eidelson and Prado's initial suc
cess story may seem to parallel the
origins of Facebook, but Eidelson
maintains that there isn't an ambition
for fame.
"We're just having a fun time in
life, and I sometimes wonder how bad
that would look in a movie," he said.
