# STUDENT LIFE
## Fraternity placed on suspension 
### MARISA LANDICHO MANAGING EDITOR 
Campus officials have put housed fraternity Kappa
Sigma on provisional alcohol and party suspension for
conduct and possible policy violations during New Stu
dent Orientation, according to Nate Boswell, associate
director of Residential Education (ResEd) on the Row.
ResEd, the Office of Student Life (OSL) and the Alco
hol Advisory Board issued the suspension, pending in
vestigation and possible further action by the Organiza
tional Conduct Board (OCB).
"The University is following up with Kappa Sigma
regarding concerns of an alleged unregistered event
during NSO," wrote Kappa Sig President Harris Brown
'll in an e-mail statement to The Daily.
Under suspension, Kappa Sig may not host events
where alcohol is served or consumed, according to
Ralph Castro, manager of Health Promotion Service's
substance abuse prevention program.
A Greek organization can be put on alcohol and
party suspension if it violates the Controlled Substances
and Alcohol Policy of the University, which prohibits
serving alcohol during "dry" weekends.
"We have been cooperating with the University

through an interim alcohol suspension and working
hard to address any specific concerns that may arise,"
Brown added.
Kappa Sig was last under review and put on proba
tion during the 2001-2002 school year.
All housed fraternities and sororities are overseen by
Res Ed's Row Office, which can take immediate penal
izing action while a more in-depth OCB review process
continues.The OCB may then rule to take no further ac
tion, extend suspension or place the Greek organization
on probation.
"Over the years, Greek organizations have gone
through the OCB process on a yearly basis," Castro
wrote in an e-mail to The Daily. "For the most part, our
Greek organizations are comprised of responsible and
thoughtful individuals. Sometimes, there are instances
where a few members make poor decisions that affect
the entire organization."
Probation, unlike suspension, means the Greek or
ganization may still host social events and parties with
highly controlled alcohol, though under increased
scrutiny by the University.

considered a warning to fraternities
and sororities, cautioning them to im
prove their conduct or risk losing
their housing if probation continues
for several years.
Suspended fraternities and sorori
ties, on the other hand, may not have
alcohol of any kind for gatherings
larger than five people. Suspensions
may be imposed for single incidents
or series of incidents.
Both suspension and probation
periods depend on the severity of the
offenses and the conduct of the of
fending organization.
To get off probation, the Greek or
ganization must meet guidelines set
by Res Ed. Most recently, Sigma
Alpha Epsilon (SAE) was lifted off
its 2009-1010 housing probation,
which was imposed in May 2009 for

"various violations of the Universi
ty's alcohol policy during the preced
ing months," according to SAE Presi
dent Owen Boochever *ll.

"Specifically, [ResEd] wanted to
see that we could not only be more re
sponsible when serving alcohol at our
social events, but that we could con
tribute more to our members and the
campus as a whole than just a venue
for parties," Boochever wrote in an e
mail to The Daily.
If a fraternity or sorority does not
improve its behavior on probation, it
faces eviction from its residence. It
has been more than seven years
since a Greek organization was re
moved from its house (see "Housing
Timeline").
In 1998, the University evicted Phi
Delta Theta (now 680 Lomita) after a
member fell off the balcony while in
toxicated and while the fraternity was
under probation. The University later
revoked the fraternity's charter. Fra
ternities Theta Xi (formerly housed in
717 Dolores), Delta Kappa Epsilon

(now Phi Kappa Psi) and Delta Tau
Delta (in what is now Narnia) lost
their houses in the '9os and early 2000s.
The Kappa Sig suspension comes
at a time when ResEd is dealing with
an upswing in alcohol-related inci
dents.
"To date, this year has been espe
cially troubling for us because we
have seen more serious alcohol inci
dents than in the past and some of
these have centered around Greek
houses," Castro said.
Alcohol suspensions and proba
tions may be administered by ResEd
to any residence or student organiza
tion prior to OCB review, not just
Greeks, Boswell said. But Castro said
Greeks in particular are under more
scrutiny by the University.
"Housed Greek organizations
are held to a higher standard because
they are both a house and a student
organization," Castro said.
