Campus officials have put housed fraternity Kappa
Sigma on provisional alcohol and party suspension for
conduct and possible policy violations during New Stu
dent Orientation, according to Nate Boswell, associate
director of Residential Education (ResEd) on the Row.
ResEd, the Office of Student Life (OSL) and the Alco
hol Advisory Board issued the suspension, pending in
vestigation and possible further action by the Organiza
tional Conduct Board (OCB).
"The University is following up with Kappa Sigma
regarding concerns of an alleged unregistered event
during NSO," wrote Kappa Sig President Harris Brown
'll in an e-mail statement to The Daily.
Under suspension, Kappa Sig may not host events
where alcohol is served or consumed, according to
Ralph Castro, manager of Health Promotion Service's
substance abuse prevention program.

party suspension if it violates the Controlled Substances
and Alcohol Policy of the University, which prohibits
serving alcohol during "dry" weekends.
"We have been cooperating with the University

through an interim alcohol suspension and working
hard to address any specific concerns that may arise,"
Brown added.
Kappa Sig was last under review and put on proba
tion during the 2001-2002 school year.
All housed fraternities and sororities are overseen by
Res Ed's Row Office, which can take immediate penal
izing action while a more in-depth OCB review process
continues.The OCB may then rule to take no further ac
tion, extend suspension or place the Greek organization
on probation.
"Over the years, Greek organizations have gone
through the OCB process on a yearly basis," Castro
wrote in an e-mail to The Daily. "For the most part, our
Greek organizations are comprised of responsible and
thoughtful individuals. Sometimes, there are instances
where a few members make poor decisions that affect
the entire organization."
Probation, unlike suspension, means the Greek or
ganization may still host social events and parties with
highly controlled alcohol, though under increased
scrutiny by the University.
Probation, given for sustained behavior patterns, is
