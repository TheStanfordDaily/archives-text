## Art professor's exhibit attacked 
### ELLEN HUET MANAGING EDITOR 
A week of picketing outside a controversial art exhibit
by a Stanford professor culminated when a woman broke
into the museum and destroyed the art, which depicts a man
who resembles Jesus Christ receiving oral sex.
Picketers crowded outside the Loveland Gallery in
Loveland, Colo., on Oct. 1, when art professor Enrique
Chagoya's art exhibit, a 7.5-inch by 7-foot color lithograph
print titled "The Misadventures of Romantic Cannibals,"
opened.
On Oct. 6, 56-year-old Kathleen Folden of Kalispell,
Mont., entered the exhibit and broke the Plexiglass case
with a crowbar, pulling out the book and tearing it up, The
Denver Post reported.
Protesters claim the art is offensive and should not be
displayed because the museum uses taxpayers' dollars. Mu
seum officials said since the art was donated, no public
funding was used for that exhibit, according to The Post.
Chagoya, however, sees his art not as defaming Jesus but
expressing an opinion about the organized church. "I'm not
trying to offend anyone's beliefs," he said. "This is a critique
to institutions."
Chagoya is shocked at the art's public reception, since he
said the book has been in various exhibits for more than a
year without any similar reaction and, he says, "no one has
complained until now."
"It's been very disconcerting," he said of the work's de
struction. "I feel our First Amendment right is being at
tacked. The museum is even afraid of replacing the work
[with another copy]."
Chagoya teaches print-making
and other art technique classes at
Stanford, and says he never speaks
about his art in classes.
Although his art has faced outspo
ken criticism from many, he says he
also has received support from unex
pected places, such as a pastor in
Loveland who commissioned a work
for his church after the controversy
broke out.
He said the dean and the chair of
the art department have been sup
portive, They are planning to organ
ize a forum on censorship in the fu

ture, "maybe when animosities calm
down, but not right now," he said.
According to Chagoya, the muse
um held a vigil for the destroyed art on
Friday night. Thomas Seligman, direc
tor of Cantor Arts Center, called the
act a "prime example" of intolerance.
"I think art often provokes emo
tions because it has something to say
that is a little too truthful for us to
take or is against someone's ideolo
gy," he said. "It's another good exam
ple of art having power, but a gross
example of intolerance and purpose
ful hostilities."
He added that while art as provo
cation is part of a growing society,
censorship of art does nothing to ad
vance the cause.
"It's amazing that a woman would
go to these lengths to destroy this," he
said. "If she made her own art, that'd

be great â€”it keeps the dialogue
going. But in no way did she have the
right to do what she did."
Chagoya feels that a tense political
environment may have also con
tributed to the reaction to the art.
"I think pre-election polarizing
politics may be the cause," he said.
"Unfortunately, I feel victimized by
this kind of extremism."
And, as he pointed out, his art is not
the first nor will it be the last to deal
with controversial religious topics.
"My work is not even as bad as it
could be," he said. "I mean, 'South
Park' gets away with depicting reli
gious icons and the reaction is not the
same." And, he noted, the show "also
takes place in Colorado."
