## Art professor's exhibit attacked

A week of picketing outside a controversial art exhibit
by a Stanford professor culminated when a woman broke

who resembles Jesus Christ receiving oral sex.
Picketers crowded outside the Loveland Gallery in
Loveland, Colo., on Oct. 1, when art professor Enrique
Chagoya's art exhibit, a 7.5-inch by 7-foot color lithograph
print titled "The Misadventures of Romantic Cannibals,"
opened.

Mont., entered the exhibit and broke the Plexiglass case
with a crowbar, pulling out the book and tearing it up, The
Denver Post reported.

displayed because the museum uses taxpayers' dollars. Mu

funding was used for that exhibit, according to The Post.
Chagoya, however, sees his art not as defaming Jesus but
expressing an opinion about the organized church. "I'm not
trying to offend anyone's beliefs," he said. "This is a critique
to institutions."
Chagoya is shocked at the art's public reception, since he
said the book has been in various exhibits for more than a
year without any similar reaction and, he says, "no one has
complained until now."
"It's been very disconcerting," he said of the work's de
struction. "I feel our First Amendment right is being at
tacked. The museum is even afraid of replacing the work
