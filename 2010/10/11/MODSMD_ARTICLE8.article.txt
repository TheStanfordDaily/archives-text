## Bling comes to campus 
### MATT BETTONVILLE 
"What's that thing on your
phone?"
That's a question becoming more
common on campus since Bling, a
new payment method that uses a
proximity chip stuck onto users' cell
phones, expanded into Palo Alto and
began its push among Stanford stu
dents at the beginning of the school
year.
Bling tags are meant to function
as more efficient and safe debit
cards. To complete a transaction, a
user touches a Bling tag, which he or
she sticks on the back of a cell phone,
to a pad provided by a retailer. The
tag eliminates PIN numbers and sig
natures, and is about one-eighth the

size of a credit or debit card.
The tap withdraws funds
from a user's Pay Pal account,
which can be connected on- <
line.
"It's about adding a small
amount of convenience," said
Bling user Drew
Padley'lo.
The convenience
also extends to re
tailers. Fraiche .
employee Annal
isa Likens said she
has seen Bling drive
consumers to the
Stanford campus
Fraiche location be
cause they want to pay
with the tag. She uses the

payment method herself.
Setting up a tag involves entering
a mobile phone number upon com
pleting the first transaction, and after
setup, every purchase instantly sends
a text message alert to the linked
phone, an added feature for book
keeping and security.
Several Bling users said a big sell
ing point of the tag was the incorpo
ration with a cell phone. "Someday
I'll really want something and only
have my phone," said Evan McDon
ald'll.
Other users said that a cell phone
is much more difficult to lose than a

credit card or wallet.
Some retailers offer a program
Bling Nation spokesman Matthew
Murphy described as a "digital
punch card," wherein the text alerts
offer incentive programs for fre
quent shoppers at a given venue. For
example, Stanford CoHo offers 10
percent off every seventh purchase
made with a Bling tag.
One concern students voiced
about the Bling tags is the seemingly
easy theft of such small objects, espe
cially because Bling tags are identi
cal aside from a nearly invisible
number indented near the bottom.
However, Murphy believes that
Bling Nation's security features off
set this problem.
"There is no information stored
on a Bling tag whatsoever," Murphy
said, comparing Bling tags with debit
cards. "You also realize you lose
your cell phone before you realize
you lose your wallet."
Murphy said the company is ex
panding from Palo Alto to San Jose,
with a particular focus on expanding
at Stanford.
Although some students admit
ted they only accepted the Bling tag
because of the $lO incentive, those
who adopted it as their primary
method of payment have largely

been pleased.
"I use [the Bling tag] every place
that has it," Likens said. "It's a lot
easier, because I'm pretty forgetful
and forget money."
"It's definitely a trendy way to
pay," said Bryan Yoo 'lO.
