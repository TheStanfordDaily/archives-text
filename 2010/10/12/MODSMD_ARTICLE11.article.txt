## Some biz-school hopefuls defy GMAT trend 
### ANNA SCHUESSLER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Despite a growing number of students nationwide who
are hoping to avoid a tough job market by applying direct
ly to business school, many at Stanford are still opting for a
more winding path.
According to the Graduate Management Admissions
Council, people under 24 comprise the fastest-growing
group of GMAT test-takers. The trend, however, has yet to
take root at Stanford with either undergraduates headed to
business school or Graduate School of Business (GSB) stu
dents.
The desire to get out of academia and gain some practi
cal experience is a common one for current seniors even
if their eventual plans will have them hitting the books
again in a few years.
That experience just might prove to be necessary in
order to distinguish themselves from the rest of the appli
cants. Business schools are known for looking for well
rounded applicants and often like students with a few years
or more of hands-on work experience.
The GSB is no different. The median student comes into
the program with four years of experience in the workforce
or having started his or her own company. According to
Madhav Raj an, senior associate dean for academic affairs at
the GSB, attracting senior undergraduates is not a top pri
ority in fact, it is not on the priority list at all. Rajan has
been teaching at the GSB since 2001, and has yet to see a
large number of first-year students coming straight out of
undergraduate careers.
"Last year's first-year class had 388 students and the
number straight out of undergrad was in the single digits,"
he said.
Rajan, an accounting professor, said students without
much practical experience tend to bring less to the class
room than those who have been exposed to more business
techniques. And while summer internships expose students
to some business structures, they lack the degree of respon
sibility normally put on part-time or full-time employees.
He says that when considering undergraduate applicants,
the GSB is more likely to look at students who have tried to
start businesses on their own rather than those who have
completed several brief work experiences.
"It's about bringing their own experiences into the class
room, and students with more experience can contribute
more to the class," Rajan said. "Students tend to get less out
of the program also if they come straight out of undergrad."
As an active member of Alpha Kappa Psi, Stanford's
business fraternity, Ming Yan *ll is familiar with the path to
ward business school. She does not know of any seniors in
the fraternity applying for acceptance into MBA programs,
positing that many of the group members are fully aware of
the expectations that business schools have for their stu
dents.
"Normally how it's done is that you have to have work
experience," Yan said.
One program that's attracted the attention of Stanford
students in the last few years is Harvard Business School's
2+2 program, which demands two years of work and two
years of academic study of its students. Bringing the securi
ty of a graduate program together with the adventure of
two years of entrepreneurial endeavors, the program strikes
a balance that many students find appealing.
"I want to get some experience that I can reflect on when
I go back to school," David Rust 'll said of the Harvard pro
gram. He has already been accepted into it and says allow
ing students to defer their enrollment after being accepted

to business school is a growing trend
that promises to yield many bene
fits. Rust imagines that collecting
recommendations and writing per
sonal statements might prove to be
challenging outside an academic
setting. Furthermore, the Stanford
senior has heard from others that
business school can be useless with
out work experience. Rust is there
fore looking forward to the years he
will spend between an undergrad
degree and graduate school.
"I feel like I can go do what I re
ally enjoy whereas I might be more
inclined to do something with more
certainty otherwise," Rust said.
