## EDITORIAL Changes to RA hiring timeline raise concerns 
### 
Now three weeks into the school year,
freshmen are just getting used to
Stanford and the idea of Residential
Education. Some sophomores are thinking
deeply about their three-year plans with lit
tle time to decide a major and academic
track. Some juniors are still contemplating
whether or not to take advantage of study
abroad options. Prospective coterminal stu
dents are preparing their applications, antic
ipating decisions to be announced in March
and April.
In the midst of the fall-quarter frenzy, stu
dents now have to weigh yet another option
that Stanford offers the choice of com
mitting now to four quarters of resident as
sistant (RA) duties, including a one-quarter
training class and three quarters of staffing.
The editorial board has concerns about
the new changes to the RA hiring process.
Granted, there is value in moving the dead
line earlier. It allows more time for prospec
tive RAs to find drawmates in the event of a
denial, it allows RAs to take a class similar to
the training that peer health educators and
resident computer consultants undergo dur
ing spring quarter, and it allows for more
preparation.
However, all these improvements are
done at the expense of the students, forcing

them to make hasty decisions during fall
quarter.
Very few sophomores know of their in
tentions for next quarter, much less whether
or not they want to make a four-quarter
commitment to a dorm staffing position. Ju
nior RAs are just becoming acclimated to
staffing. With only nine weeks of experience,
it will be hard to determine whether or not
committing another year would be worth it.
Non-RAs are just growing accustomed to
their major courses, figuring out commit
ments to activities, and deciding whether or
not to pass up their last chances to apply for
study-abroad opportunities. For prospective
coterminal students, the staffing decision
will likewise be more difficult.
In addition, a Row house's current staff
will only have about nine weeks of interac
tion with its residents, leaving the staff to de
cide on next year's hires with little knowl
edge how the applicants would fit into the
house.
The improvements could be made with
out putting students in such situations. Stu
dent input is integral in making these deci
sions, and while the RA hiring process need
ed to be revamped, the editorial board is
skeptical about whether or not this change is
the best course of action.
