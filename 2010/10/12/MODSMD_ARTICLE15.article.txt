# GIRL YOU KNOW IT'S TRUE
## The
						Next Great Technology Movie 
### Jordan Carr 
This weekend, "The Social Network"
rode its Aaron Sorkin-based walk-and
talks to its second week as the No. 1
film in the country. Considering this is basi
cally a movie about a lawsuit between one set
of rich WASPs and some other billionaire
guy who went to Harvard, it seems likely that
the vast majority of the popularity is piggy
backing on the fact that it is The Facebook
Movie rather than being especially torn up
over the travails of various Winklevosses and
Zuckerbergs and Timberlakes. Old people
want to see the movie that captures the spirit
of the younger generation, young people like
to see what old people think captures the
spirit of our generation, and the circle of life
continues.
The Movie That Defines a Generation
comes out every so often, and as far as this
goes, it could be worse. Fifteen years ago, the
equivalent movie was called "Reality Bites,"
and it starred Ben Stiller, Winona Ryder,
Ethan Hawke and America's sweetheart,
Janeane Garofalo.
Though I am not original enough to think
of a good idea, I am unethical enough to
steal someone else's and capitalize on it my
self without sharing credit (like our collec
tive hero, Mark Zuckerberg!). And the great
idea here is to take some random boring
movie about a dull legal procedure or some
such and suddenly tie it into a technology or
product that people care deeply (and irra
tionally) about. Here are a few ideas for how
to do that.
Just Ask: The Story of Ask Jeeves
A disgruntled butler (Michael Caine) re
alizes he has a gift for answering his boss's
(Ashton Kutcher) moronic questions. What
color is a knife? What is normal blood pres
sure? Who you attracting with that line,
what's your name, what's your sign? So in
1996, he takes to the interwebs to personally
answer people's questions, the world over.
(Sample dialogue Random Attractive
Woman: The site got 2,200 hits within two
hours? Jeeves: Hundred. Twenty-two hun
dred. RAW: Yes, that's what I said. Jeeves:
Oh. Right then.)
Jeeves' newfound wealth allows him to
quit his job and hire a butler of his own, an ac
tion that he is deeply conflicted about. How
ever, he gets over it and eventually begins
making his butler do all the humiliating tasks
he resented doing.
Unfortunately, other search engines real
ize that there are better ways to gather infor
mation on the Internet than having one per
son sit at a computer and type in answers, so
Jeeves' website loses all its value, and he is
forced to go back to his old job as a butler,
where he will serve out the rest of his days
primarily functioning as a footstool.

Jobs! The Official Steve Jobs Story
How do you go from getting fired from a
company to becoming the guy whose health
outlook affects its stock prices? The story
opens in a dorm in Reed College where
young Steve Jobs (Denzel Washington) is the
most beloved man on campus, but he would
really like to be part of the school's elite so
cial clubs. Upon learning that Reed doesn't
really do weird, elite social clubs, he drops
out and soon is running Apple, where some
jealous idiots fire him for being too awesome.
They soon regret their horrible mistake and
rehire him at which point he is awarded over
230 patents and single-handedly invents
everything that makes Apple worthwhile.
The biggest drama surrounds when that
stupid jerk Bill Gates (Vin Diesel) starts try
ing to look good by getting all his billionaire
buddies to agree to donate large sums of
their fortunes. Steve Jobs has no interest in
participating, and is mad that Bill Gates gets
any credit for this. The problem is resolved
when Jobs realizes that for no apparent rea
son, young and socially conscious people ar
bitrarily regard Apple as a "responsible"
brand, and Bill Gates as the evil, money
hoarding rich guy. In the closing scene,
everyone high fives and laughs hysterically
as an ad for something called a "Microsoft
Zune" comes on TV. Written and Directed by
Steve Jobs.
