## Life: Hacked 
### Jade Wang 
Sometimes, when I'm melting into my lap
top, staring at the blinking cursor of my
word processor, I somehow manage to
convince myself that reading about "life
hacks" on the Internet is close enough to
work to assuage the niggling guilt. Life hacks
are small, clever changes in habit that im
prove life, generally by increasing productivi
ty. I read about ways to work on the comput
er more efficiently and even occasionally
download programs that I rarely end up
using. I read, sometimes for hours, about how
to increase my productivity, thereby drastical
ly decreasing my productivity.
It feels kind of like shopping, but instead of
searching for a soft cardigan that will flatter,
or a thick novel that will compel, I am looking
for something that will make me a better ver
sion of myself.
These hacks promise me that I can, in fact,
get it all done, with higher quality, and with
enough time left over to bake an authentic
pizza from scratch. Instead of peeking at my
inbox through squinted eyes, hoping that the
number in the parentheses has somehow
dwindled, I could be gazing calmly at a con
trolled situation. I can almost envision myself
evolving much in the style of a Pokemon,
from procrastinating girl wearing athletic
shorts despite never doing athletic activity to
focused woman, poised and punctilious. Is
there really a magical program somewhere
on the Internet that will suddenly transform
me into one of those people who doesn't
struggle to achieve focus? I haven't found one
yet, but every Sunday night, I'll do another

search.
While, admittedly, I do rely heavily on the
program that only allows me six minutes of
Facebook a day, these computer-based hacks
can only take me so far. My true interest lies in
the hacks that people use in their everyday
lives, away from the computer. To be honest, I
know my computing productivity could use
some serious optimization, and I don't really
need a shiny program to tell me that I should
probably read fewer blogs if I want to ever get
anything done. Away from the laptop, though,
I like to believe that I operate at a moderate
level of efficiency. A laundry list of ways to in
crease my productivity does not come to me as
easily as in the case of laptop work.
Hacks in everyday life are difficult to come
by. They are not so readily apparent as the
computer variety, which are generally some
kind of application that utilizes keyboard
shortcuts heavily. They are the small habits
and quirks that have assimilated into routine
but present moments of insight for other peo
ple. I first realized that I could be a hacker of
life when I was walking to class with a friend,
the customary burn in my calves not quite
enough to help me completely avoid tardi
ness. I approached the Quad and barreled
through the first door I saw, walking intently.
My friend was confused, remembering cor
rectly that I actually had class in Gates, sever
al courtyards away. I explained that I wanted
to go through the building, so I could cut diag
onally through the Quad and make it to Gates
faster, with no shortage of statements of ob
noxious pride at being one of the few "cam-

pus walkers" thrown into the diatribe. I didn't
have time to see much of his reaction beyond
vague surprise before I rushed off to class on
my optimized route, but later, 1 started asking
people for their life hacks.
I have been collecting life hacks since,
keeping an eye out for clever shortcuts people
use in their own lives. Hacking is something
that, it seems, people do naturally it's going
to a restaurant during off hours to avoid a wait
and it's pulling into the carpool lane and
speeding by the parking lot to the right. It's
that sensation that feels like winning and beat
ing the system. It's saving a phone call home
for a long walk across campus, and it's organ
izing a shopping list according to the shelves at
the store. It's carrying a shopping bag around
to sheath a wet bike seat, and it's going to the
market to eat samples for lunch.The hacks can
get a little stranger, a little less common. It's
brushing teeth in the shower to save time and
water. It's mixing banana bread batter in the
baking pan to save on dishes, and it's walking
through buildings to get somewhere faster.
I invite you to join in the fun think
about your own hacks, and share them with
your friends. You might save some time, or
you might waste some, but it's the conversa
tion that is the fun. Welcome to life
hackathon.
