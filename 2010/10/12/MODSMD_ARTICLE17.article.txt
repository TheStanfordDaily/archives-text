Writing, not content, was
problem with Hanson editorial

Dear Editor,
I stumbled upon the recent controversy re
garding the Oct. 7 editorial about Victor Davis
Flanson's remarks about race and politics.
I wrote for The Daily occasionally in 1990
and 1991 while completing an M.A. in com
munication (journalism), and during this
time I always found the staff to be one of the
best in college journalism, with the fiercest
and most knowledgeable copy editors in the
business.
Thus I was extremely disappointed by the
Oct. 7 editorial.
The content, such as it was, was not a prob
lem. Davis made a provocative argument,
and you responded with disagreement. That's
as it should be (though your argument would
have been much more effective had you em
ployed some specifics).
The problem was the writing.
"But this sort of homogenous denigration
is no intellectual commentary. It is at best vit
riolic ignorance. Combining the toxic as

sumption that all members of an ethnicity
group act the same way with the mocking ref
erence to 'an accent and a trill' veers danger
ously into bigotry." And it goes on like this.
Let me put on my professor hat for a mo
ment: can ignorance be "vitriolic"? Can an
assumption be "toxic"? Can you veer "dan
gerously into" bigotry? (On this last, you can
veer toward something, but once you've
veered "into" it, then it's just bigotry, which
was actually your point, was it not?)
Not to be all "back in the day," but, well,
back in the day The Daily's board and the
copy editors would never let that many mod
ifiers be employed in one paragraph and
would certainly not have allowed them to be
imprecise and therefore ineffective. ("Vitri
olic" means "like acid," so certainly rhetoric
can be "vitriolic" which is no doubt what
the writer meant. But "vitriolic" does not re
ally describe ignorance very well at all.)
You let someone get carried away with the
adjectives and adverbs and printed a dog's
breakfast of an editorial. Unless things have
really changed at the Farm (which I doubt),
you're better than that. As Prof. James Risser
told me once, a true argument written calmly

beats a pile of adjectives every time.

Beutelsbach, not Florence, was
first BOSP outpost

Dear Editor,
In "Framing Florence" (Oct. 6), there is a
small factual mistake. The author says that
"Stanford has had an abroad program in Flo
rence for 50 years it was the University's
first foreign outpost." It is true that Stanford in
Florence was opened in 1960 and has been
going strong for 50 fabulous and successful
years. But the first foreign outpost of the Bing
Overseas Studies Program was in Beutelsbach,
Germany, a program that opened in 1958.
