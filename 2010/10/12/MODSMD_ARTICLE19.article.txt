## SINKING NO.1 Stanford hands previously perfect USC its first loss of season 
### DASH DAVIDSON 
In a day that saw several Stanford teams
triumph over their USC counterparts, the
men's water polo game may have been the
most surprising of all the victories. Stanford
put in a strong defensive effort en route to a
tough 5-3 win.
No. 1 USC (15-1,1-1 MPSF) was in the
midst of an 18-game winning streak, and had
won its previous 17 games against the Cardi
nal, dating back to 2005. The No. 6 Cardinal
(7-5,1-0), on the other hand, had been endur
ing a slide, losing four of its last six after four
straight wins to start the season. Two of those
losses came against rival California, which
knocked the Card out of both the NorCal
and SoCal Tournaments.
One thing the Cardinal did have going for
it, which seemed to give the squad added en
ergy and motivation, was home-pool advan
tage. Having an electric atmosphere against a
marquee opponent like the Trojans set the
stage for the upset at Avery Aquatic Center
on Saturday afternoon.
The unquestioned star of the match for
the Cardinal was redshirt junior goalkeeper
Brian Pingree. In consort with an excellent
effort by the defense as a whole, Pingree
managed to hold the Trojan attack, vaunted
for its scoring proficiency, to a paltry three
goals, well below its Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation (MPSF)-leading average of 15

goals per game. Pingree finished with 14
saves.
On the offensive side of the pool, senior
driver Jeffrey Schwimer paced the Cardinal
with two goals while sophomore driver Paul
Rudolph, senior driver Sage Wright and jun
ior utility Peter Sefton each added a goal to
the Cardinal's tally.
For the visiting Trojans, senior goalie Joel
Dennerley had four saves while sophomore
Mace Rapsey scored two goals and freshman
Nikola Vavic had the other.
The game's scoring was concentrated
around the beginning of the match and the
end, with a lull in the middle two periods. The
Cardinal, courtesy of Schwimer's first goal,
opened up the scoring at the 5:33 mark in the
first period. Six sturdy saves by Pingree sti
fled the USC offense for most of the first pe
riod, and Stanford doubled its lead at the 2:38
mark in the period when Sefton hammered

home his goal.
The Trojans responded quickly thereafter
with Vavic scoring their first goal at the 1:07
mark in the first period. After that point
though, they could not penetrate the stingy
Stanford defense again until the fourth period,
when the game was starting to get out of reach.
The fourth period opened with Stanford
leading 4-1, following Schwimer's second
goal in the second period and Rudolph's tally
at the end of the third. USC mounted a brief
charge at the beginning of the final period.

right after Wright put the Cardinal up 5-1 just
1:39 into the fourth. Rapsey responded with
a goal of his own, doubling the Trojan's score
15 seconds after Wright's goal, and sent
tremors of an impending comeback through
the crowd at Avery.
However, Pingree and the Cardinal de
fense remained steadfast, allowing only one
more goal, scored again by Rapsey, when the
game was essentially already out of reach
with 1:43 left.
Befitting the stellar game he played, the

contest ended with a penalty-shot save by
Pingree, cementing the upset.
For his efforts, Pingree was named MPSF
Mikasa player of the week.

Stanford will hit the road for its next two
MPSF contests, going to UCLA on Friday
and UC-Santa Barbara on Sunday. The Card
will take on the Bruins at 7 p.m. and the Gau
chos at 12 p.m.
