"How do we preserve the art of medicine?" asked liver-trans

Jonathan J. King Lecture at Stanford Medical School on Mon

Chen admitted that she used to consider the dying patients in
the internal care unit as "crumpled" and the frightened patients
who refused to accept treatment until they asked all their ques

By doing so, she forgot what she now calls a crucial aspect of
her profession: it is always the patient's first time.

for "defamiliarizing the familiar," causing her to see her work in
new light. Rather than leave a woman alone with her dying hus
band in the internal care unit, as Chen thought was the norm,
