## Chen discusses the art of medicine Surgeon highlights importance of fresh perspectives on patient care 
### ERIN INMAN STAFF WRITER 
"How do we preserve the art of medicine?" asked liver-trans
plant surgeon Pauline Chen in her address for the 20th annual
Jonathan J. King Lecture at Stanford Medical School on Mon
day night.
Chen is a surgeon, a frequent contributor to The New York
Times and the author of The New York Times bestseller "Final
Exam: A Surgeon's Reflection on Mortality." The Jonathan J.
King Lecture commemorates Dr. King's vision of enhancing pa
tient care through empathy, compassion and hope.
"It is a fact that our work becomes routine with time," Chen
said. "Our patients benefit from this clinical experience. But
with that experience we begin to develop assumptions that pre
vent us from delivering truly patient-centered care,"
In a world where the average medical resident witnesses 28
deaths a year, it's hard to remember that it's the patient's first
time while still tapping into one's wealth of experience as a doc
tor, Chen said.
Chen admitted that she used to consider the dying patients in
the internal care unit as "crumpled" and the frightened patients
who refused to accept treatment until they asked all their ques
tions as "difficult."
By doing so, she forgot what she now calls a crucial aspect of
her profession: it is always the patient's first time.
She credited this realization to a former attending physician
for "defamiliarizing the familiar," causing her to see her work in
new light. Rather than leave a woman alone with her dying hus
band in the internal care unit, as Chen thought was the norm,

this doctor would remain in the room
to comfort the woman.
Chen realized that some rare doc
tors, such as this man, saw suffering
and dying as an opportunity to care
and a chance to practice the art of
medicine.
"They replaced suffering, unbear
able grief and fear with comfort, true
healing and hope," Chen said. "They
managed to bring the two threads [of
medicine] back together the sci
ence and the art and they weaved
them back into the same thread that
was stronger than each thread
alone."
From these models, Chen began
to stay with her dying internal care
unit patients and families to provide
comfort as if for the first time.
"Hold onto the incredible role

models you have," Chen said, ad
dressing the medical students. "Their
behaviors are beacons of inspira
tion."
Chen also urged medical students
to hold fast to their newness and ide
alism, as they remind older physi
cians of the necessity of patient-cen
tered care.
Leo Ungar, a first-year medical
school student in attendance, echoed
Chen's perception of a fine balance
between burning out and being a
truly compassionate physician.
"I remember when I was applying
to med school the question I got a lot
was, 'What do you think the most dif
ficult part of medicine is?'" Ungar
said. "The answer that I gave was
maintaining the distance that you
need to do your job effectively and
not burn out while at the same time
appreciating the gravity of each
case."
