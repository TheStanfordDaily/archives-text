# W. volleyball drops one
## Card suffers first loss of the season, splits two games in L.A. 
### KATHERINE KNOX 
The No. 1 Stanford women's volleyball
team (14-1, 5-1 Pac-10) headed south last
weekend to face No. 8 USC (14-3,3-2) and
No. 12 UCLA (12-4,2-3) on Friday and Sat
urday. To kick off the weekend, the Card
pulled out a four-set victory over the Trojans,
18-25,25-23,25-20,25-16. However, Stanford
couldn't keep up its momentum, and the Bru
ins ended the Cardinal's undefeated run in a
five-set thriller the following night, 25-21,16-
25,25-27,25-23,15-12.
USC got off to a quick start after aggres
sive serving by senior outside hitter Geena
Urango and junior setter Kendall Bateman
that kept the Cardinal offense off the net.
Early attacking errors from the Stanford side
combined with three consecutive kills by
USC freshman Falyn Fonoimoana added to
the Trojan lead, which peaked at 17-7 mid-set.
USC held the Card to a .125 hitting percent
age on the set, which at that point was the
lowest on the season.
Despite another huge serving run by
Urango that brought the Trojans up to 11-6 to
kick off the second set, the Cardinal pulled
out a slim 25-23 victory to split sets. USC sen
ior outside hitter Alex Jupiter earned four
early kills, yet the 10 combined kills of Stan
ford's priorities senior outside hitter Alix
Klineman and sophomore opposite Hayley
Spelman gave the Card the offense edge.
It was a pair of untimely errors from the Tro
jan service line that ultimately cost USC the
set by a two-point deficit.
After the break, the teams traded leads
twice before a trio of consecutive kills from
Klineman allowed Stanford to pull ahead 11-
9. Cardinal momentum built throughout the
set, as Klineman added three more kills to
two pivotal side-out kills by Spelman. Red
shirt junior middle blocker Stephanie
Browne concluded the set with a solo block
of USC middle blocker Lauren Williams.
Stanford took the set 25-20.
Five tied scores early on in the fourth sug
gested an inevitable battle for the set and
match. However, Cardinal senior libero Gabi
Ailes took control of the match mid-set by
punching out a pair of aces in a five-point run.
Klineman, Spelman and Browne tallied 14
kills on the set to score a 25-15 win, earning
the Card the match.
Klineman totaled 27 kills to become the
kill leader for her 10th consecutive match,
while Jupiter slid in second with 19 kills.
The USC defense gave the Cardinal front
line a battle as four Trojans recorded double
digit digging totals. The Trojans rank third in
Pac-10 digging stats, while the Cardinal sits in
second.
However, UCLA embodies defensive
success, leading the conference in digs per set
since the beginning of Pac-10 play.
The Cardinal started its campaign in
Pauley Pavilion neck-and-neck with the Bra
ins until three Cardinal hitters contributed
three consecutive errors to give UCLA the
lead, 14-13. A pair of kills by senior outside
hitter Dicey McGraw gave the Bruins a
three-point lead. The Card then dropped
quickly to a 24-19 deficit with a series of un
forced errors, and closed the set with a service
error.
The beginning of the second set mirrored
the first, yet the outcome reversed when a
block by Spelman and freshman middle
blocker Carly Wopat forced three hitting er
rors from the Bruins. The Cardinal stole the
momentum, holding the Brains to a hitting

percentage of .000 to pull out a 25-16 win and
split the sets.
Ten tied scores characterized the third set,
which forced the "win-by-two" rule into ef
fect when Stanford took the set with a pair of
attacking errors from the Bruins.The rallying
of the score paralleled the long rallies that en
abled Klineman and Ailes to accumulate 20
digs apiece.
Gera, working in tandem with sophomore
outside hitter Bojana Todorovic, controlled
the Bruin defense and serve-receive forma
tion. The Cardinal took the set, 27-25, to lead
the match 2-1.
Klineman carried the Stanford offense in
the fourth set, with contributing kills by
Browne and senior setter Cassidy Lichtman
at the beginning of the set. Timely kills by
UCLA outside hitter Rachael Kidder and
middle blocker Katie Camp throughout the
set kept the Bruins in control. Each beat
down a kill in opposition to Klineman's pair
at the end of the set as the Bruins maintained
their two-point lead to take the set 25-23 and
bring the score to 2-2.
Because both teams tacked on a number of
service and attacking errors in the fifth set, it
was Kidder's dominant offensive performance
that earned the Bruins the upset, 15-12. She
added an unprecedented seven kills for UCLA
in the final set, giving her 25 on the night.
Klineman led with 27 kills, hitting .243 to
Kidder's .110 across the five sets. The loss was
Stanford's first on the season.
The Cardinal remains first in the Pac-10
after Saturday's defeat, although rival Cal
now shares the position with the same 5-1
conference record.
Stanford's next two matches are at Maples
Pavilion, where it will face Washington on
Friday and Washington State on Saturday.
Both matches are scheduled to start at 7 p.m.

two pivotal side-out kills by Spelman. Red
shirt junior middle blocker Stephanie
Browne concluded the set with a solo block
of USC middle blocker Lauren Williams.
Stanford took the set 25-20.
Five tied scores early on in the fourth sug
gested an inevitable battle for the set and
match. However, Cardinal senior libero Gabi
Ailes took control of the match mid-set by
punching out a pair of aces in a five-point run.
Klineman, Spelman and Browne tallied 14
kills on the set to score a 25-15 win, earning
the Card the match.
Klineman totaled 27 kills to become the
kill leader for her 10th consecutive match,
while Jupiter slid in second with 19 kills.
The USC defense gave the Cardinal front
line a battle as four Trojans recorded double
digit digging totals. The Trojans rank third in
Pac-10 digging stats, while the Cardinal sits in
second.
However, UCLA embodies defensive
success, leading the conference in digs per set
since the beginning of Pac-10 play.
The Cardinal started its campaign in
Pauley Pavilion neck-and-neck with the Bra
ins until three Cardinal hitters contributed
three consecutive errors to give UCLA the
lead, 14-13. A pair of kills by senior outside
hitter Dicey McGraw gave the Bruins a
three-point lead. The Card then dropped
quickly to a 24-19 deficit with a series of un
forced errors, and closed the set with a service
error.
The beginning of the second set mirrored
the first, yet the outcome reversed when a
block by Spelman and freshman middle
blocker Carly Wopat forced three hitting er
rors from the Bruins. The Cardinal stole the
momentum, holding the Brains to a hitting

percentage of .000 to pull out a 25-16 win and
split the sets.
Ten tied scores characterized the third set,
which forced the "win-by-two" rule into ef
fect when Stanford took the set with a pair of
attacking errors from the Bruins.The rallying
of the score paralleled the long rallies that en
abled Klineman and Ailes to accumulate 20
digs apiece.
Gera, working in tandem with sophomore
outside hitter Bojana Todorovic, controlled
the Bruin defense and serve-receive forma
tion. The Cardinal took the set, 27-25, to lead
the match 2-1.
Klineman carried the Stanford offense in
the fourth set, with contributing kills by
Browne and senior setter Cassidy Lichtman
at the beginning of the set. Timely kills by
UCLA outside hitter Rachael Kidder and
middle blocker Katie Camp throughout the
set kept the Bruins in control. Each beat
down a kill in opposition to Klineman's pair
at the end of the set as the Bruins maintained
their two-point lead to take the set 25-23 and
bring the score to 2-2.
Because both teams tacked on a number of
service and attacking errors in the fifth set, it
was Kidder's dominant offensive performance
that earned the Bruins the upset, 15-12. She
added an unprecedented seven kills for UCLA
in the final set, giving her 25 on the night.
Klineman led with 27 kills, hitting .243 to
Kidder's .110 across the five sets. The loss was
Stanford's first on the season.
The Cardinal remains first in the Pac-10
after Saturday's defeat, although rival Cal
now shares the position with the same 5-1
conference record.
Stanford's next two matches are at Maples
Pavilion, where it will face Washington on
Friday and Washington State on Saturday.
Both matches are scheduled to start at 7 p.m.
