# Taking L.A.
## Stanford remains unbeaten with road victories over USC and UCLA 
### BROOKE DAVIS 
The curtain has fallen on the first week
end of conference play, leaving No. 1 Stan
ford women's soccer with two victories to
its name. The Cardinal (11-0-2, 2-0-0 Pac
-10) defeated both No. 20 USC (8-3-2,1-1-0)
and No. 13 UCLA (8-4-1,1 -1 -0) on the road
in southern California.
On Friday night under the lights of the
Coliseum, the Cardinal met a fervent USC
squad. At the half, the scoreboard re
mained tied at zero. Stanford and USC
each had six shots at halftime, but the game
took a turn in the 59th minute when senior
forward Christen Press sunk the ball in the
back of the net from 20 yards out.
With her 60th career goal. Press now
holds the Stanford record for goals scored.
The mark, set by Sarah Rafanelli in 1993,
had been untouched for 17 years.
But the goals didn't stop there. The 65th
minute arrived and so did junior midfield
er Teresa Noyola with a shot from the top
of the box. Noyola managed to sneak the
ball past USC goalkeeper Shelby Church,
who couldn't quite reach the left post shot
in time to keep it out of the Trojan net.
With plenty of time still left on the
clock, USC kept up its intensity and drew
14 total fouls from Stanford, which only
drew eight from USC. Off one USC free
kick, Trojan defender Mia Bruno collected
an attempted Cardinal clearance and put
the ball away in the 84th minute.
Stanford held the score at 2-1 for the re
mainder of the game and came out on top.
"We learned a lot about the mentality it
takes to win a game in the Pac-10," said
Stanford head coach Paul Ratcliffe. "USC

went after us. We've got to be hungry, hun
gry enough to win."
Two days after defeating USC, the Car
dinal headed to Drake Stadium to face
UCLA. The Bruins entered the game com
ing off a 1-0 victory over No. 16 California,
and were bolstered by the return of for
ward Sydney Leroux, who came back after
two weeks at the U.S. senior national-team
camp.
Stanford delivered early, holding Ler
oux to one shot over the course of the game
and earning its first goal in the 23rd minute
of play. After a Bruin handball, Press
stepped up to take the penalty kick and
scored her 16th goal of the season.
"When you're in a tight game, especial
ly away from home, and get a goal, it can
break the ice," Ratcliffe said. "This one
broke the ice. It was big."
The Cardinal continued to press, taking
a total of 12 shots during the game (UCLA
took seven), and in the 36th minute, sopho
more midfielder Mariah Nogueira took ad
vantage of one of three Stanford corner
kicks and sunk the ball in the Bruin net
from the six, closing the scoring at 2-0.
The weekend came to a close and sent
Stanford back up north in good spirits.
"We knew the first weekend was going to
determine who's going to have the best shot
of controlling the Pac-10," said senior mid
fielder Allison McCann. "This was huge."
"They understood the importance of
this week," Ratcliffe said. "But the job's not
done. There are plenty of tough teams in
this conference."
Conference play for the Cardinal will
continue this weekend, when Stanford will
host Washington State on Friday at 5 p.m.
and Washington on Sunday at noon at
Laird Q. Cagan Stadium.
