# Luck's big hit helped Card
## 
### Zach Zimmerman Dishing the Rock 
Before Saturday night, I had never
cheered after a Stanford turnover.
Never before had I seen a team bene
fit from a lost fumble. Never before
had I witnessed a sell-out crowd drop
its collective jaw in a synchronized WTF-just-hap
pened reaction.
That's because before Saturday night, Andrew
Luck had never gone Thomas the Tank Engine on
aUSCTrojan.
USC's Shareece Wright is probably still feeling
the effects of the hit by the train that is our starting
quarterback. As Wright attempted to return a
Stepfan Taylor fumble just before halftime, Luck
thwacked him Ray Lewis-style, forcing the ball
loose with such authority that it sparked accusa
tions of juicing by You Tube commenters.
The play was literally breathtaking, causing fans
of both teams to drool at the big screens while Luck
jogged off the field with a grin. ABC replayed the
hit umpteen billion times while play-by-play guy
Mike Patrick tried his hardest not to have an
aneurysm as he described the heroics.
Yet some of my friends weren't impressed. In
fact, many of them were ticked off They weren't
mad at Luck, who none of us doubt has a spine
made out of titanium, but rather at Stanford fans
the same Stanford fans that I berated last week and
that my friend Dan Bohm lambasted yesterday.
See, despite Luck's attempted murder of
Wright, Stanford still lost the ball. We gave up pos
session with 50 seconds left in the first half, in a tie
game in which every touch of the ball was of the

utmost importance.TheTroj ans started their drive
at midfield, were receiving to start the second half
and were picking on the Stanford cornerbacks
without resistance. Objectively speaking, they
were a near lock to get on the scoreboard before
the break.
Nonetheless, Stanford fans cheered. I cheered.
I punched my friend in the chest. I acted like an an
imal. The question is whether this behavior is in
dicative of a "true" football fan.
No. The play was really terrible like worst
case scenario terrible. Did all of the fans recognize
this? Of course not.
Let's be honest. At Stanford Stadium only 20
percent of those who were cheering understood
the true consequences of the play, 40 percent of
those cheering did so just because they saw the hit
and the remaining 40 percent were cheering be
cause they heard everyone else cheering.
However, I'm going to give everyone the ben
efit of the doubt this one time and take the side of
the fans because, this time, I truly believe that this
play made a difference in the outcome of the
game.
For the first time since I've been a student
here, people looked at us like we were mean. We
could care less if you took the ball from us.
Turnover or not, we were going to hit you square
in the mouth. These nerds can get pissed off too.
And not just any nerd, but our prized quarter
back, the projected first pick in the NFL Draft. A
potential 50 million-dollar man is willing to
lower his shoulder scratch that, his throwing

shoulder and lay down the law. If that doesn't
put an ounce of fear into an opposing squad and
a jolt of electricity into Cardinal fans, then noth
ing will.
From then on, the offense played flawlessly.
The famous O-Line, the same one that was humil
iated last week at Oregon in easily its worst per
formance of the season, was fired up with a pas
sion that we had never seen. And although our de
fensive players were exposed more than Brett
Favre's manhood on Deadspin, they played with
an extra step. The stadium was absolutely electric,
and the win was gigantic.
So hate or love the crowd's reaction, but it was
well-deserved. A hustle play that sparked a bril
liant offensive performance against our most
hated rivals I said it.USC has suipassed Cal
deserves to be rewarded with praise. Even the
biggest football elitists, myself included, have to
step away from big words like "implications" and
"statistics" every once in a while and savor the
moment for what it is.
And what a moment it was. Stanford's domi
nance over USC in recent years now has a poster
image. And Shareece Wright has a new daddy.

Zach Zimmerman is hiding from Andrew Luck
and his titanium spine. Remind him that Luck is a
nice guy at zachz@stanford.edu.
