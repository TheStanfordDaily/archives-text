# Group pushes park compost
## New community initiative gathers signatures for anaerobic digestion facility in Byxbee Park 
### MARGARET RAWSON STAFF WRITER 
The Palo Alto Green Energy Initiative
(PAGEI) kicked off its petition drive in
front of City Hall on Sept. 25, calling for
an initiative on the November 2011 ballot
for the rededication of 10 acres of Byxbee
Park for a composting operation. The ini
tiative supports the construction of a
composting operation, or anaerobic di
gestion facility, on 10 of the 127 acres
scheduled to be turned into parkland
when the Byxbee Park landfill closes in
2012 but it is facing some community
opposition.
The anaerobic digestion facility would
convert more than 60,000 tons of organic
waste per year into green energy and

compost, providing enough energy to
power 1,400 homes and reducing city
greenhouse-gas emissions by 20,000 tons
per year, according to PAGEI. The facili
ty, which would be next to the existing
wastewater treatment plant, could also
save the city $1 million each year.
"There's been a kind of chicken-or
egg situation," said former Palo Alto
mayor and PAGEI member Peter Drek
meier of the petition, stressing the impor
tance of thinking ahead to next year's
election even though results of a feasibili
ty study commissioned by the City Coun
cil last spring will not be published in full
until September 2011.
The proposed facility would use dry
anaerobic digestion, "a fermentation
process that breaks down the material in

the absence of oxygen and produces
methane which is harvested for energy,"
according to Hilary Gans, a proponent of
the facility and contract manager for
South Bayside Waste Management Au
thority.
"That energy can be combusted to
generate electricity or it can be piped over
to the wastewater treatment plant to be
used as heating in their process," Gans
said. "Or, theoretically, it can be com
pressed into liquefied natural gas to run
vehicles."
Overall, said Gans, "it is an energy
positive operation. We also calculate that
it's a revenue-positive facility."
The facility is expected to cost be
tween $l4 and $2O million. Potential
sources of funding include city programs.

venture capital, government grants and
the city's Refuse Fund and Utilities Fund,
including the Calaveras Fund, which to
tals between $25 and $3O million, accord
ing to Drekmeier.
"This is one of the most significant
things we can do as a community," Drek
meier said of the facility. Forty years ago
when the landfill was originally labeled to
be turned into parkland, "no one knew
about global warming," he said. "If Propo
sition 23 is defeated on Nov. 2, there will
be a lot more focus on how to reduce
greenhouse gases."
"We feel it's tremendously popular,"
Drekmeier added of the initiative, reflect
ing on the pride Palo Alto residents have
of their environmental ethic,
"There is a need for dozens of these
facilities to be built," Gans said. "Right
now there are none."
"Palo Alto has a history of being re
sponsible for its own services, with its
own utilities department, wastewater
treatment plant, and landfill," Gans
added. "This facility is an extension of
that self-reliant philosophy."
Not so, says conservationist and
former councilmember Emily Renzel.
"It's being misrepresented to peo
ple," said Renzel of the petition. "This
is a park undedication ordinance, pure
and simple. They have a concept of a
project but there is no official project."
Renzel views the proposed facility
as "a real slap in the face to many,many
councils who ratified over and over

again that this would be a park," and
doubts its money-making prospects.
"Dream on," said Renzel to the
idea that the facility will not cause dis
ruptive noise or odor, calling the com
puter-generated image of the facility
"a pie-in-the-sky" vision.
Dry anaerobic digestion takes
place indoors, but Renzel says trucks
coming and going from the site would
cause disruptions. Drekmeier hopes
the facility would have a green roof,
though opponents like Renzel ques
tion how expensive a green roof
would be.
Proponents of the facility view it as
a compromise. "This is not an either-or
decision," Gans said, stressing that the
facility will use only about 10 of
Byxbee Park's 127 acres.
"If we don't set aside land for this
purpose, we'll have lost this opportuni
ty forever," Gans said.
Although a private company,
Peninsula Sanitary Services, Inc., han
dles University waste, sustainability

programs on campus see the initiative
in Palo Alto as a step in the right di
rection.
"It represents a really positive step
for Palo Alto in the long term and for
Stanford as well," saidTheo Gibbs 'll,
ASSU executive chair of sustainabili

ty. "I think it's more a matter of looking
at short-term definitions of environ
mentalism and 'green' versus long
term sustainability."
