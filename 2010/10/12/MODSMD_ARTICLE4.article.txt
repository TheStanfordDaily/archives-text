## Europe travel alert elicits caution 
### STEVEN SMALLBERG 
The U.S. Department of State issued a travel alert on
Oct. 3 notifying American travelers of potential terror
ist attacks in Europe, where six of the Bing Overseas
Studies Program (BOSP) centers are located.
The alert, which will be in effect until Jan. 31,2011,
warned of possible attacks in tourist areas and trans
portation infrastructure in large European cities, be
lieved to be coordinated by al-Qaida and its affiliates.
The broad alert encompasses BOSP locations in
Berlin, Florence, Madrid, Moscow, Paris and Oxford.
The alert did not mention specific cities; counterter
rorism officials this month were assessing possi
ble threats against Britain, France and Ger
many, The New York Times reported.
Travel alerts are less severe than travel
warnings when a warning is issued, the i
Department of State generally advises
Americans to avoid visiting the country '
the warning concerns. Travel alerts, on the
other hand, are usually issued in response to
short-term conditions and instead advise that
citizens exercise particular vigilance while
traveling.
The BOSP administration reacted
promptly when the alert was released.
"We drafted a memo to the students,
advising them to look carefully at the
travel warning, give overseas staff their
contact information and alert program
staff of weekend plans," said Associate
Vice Provost and Executive Director

Irene Kennedy. "We also emphasize that they maintain
regular contact with their families."
Travel alerts and warnings are issued fairly regularly,
and the BOSP has an established protocol in place to re
spond accordingly. A recent Community Health Pro
gram in Oaxaca, Mexico was cancelled because of a gov
ernment-issued warning that included the entire nation.
"Stanford actually has a policy, issued by the provost,
that we do not send students to countries with travel

warnings," Kennedy said. "A travel warning
hile the quarter is underway, depending on
he situation, could require us to evacuate
students."
Kennedy said that some parents of
BOSP students contacted the program
asking what emergency plans were in
place, but, according to Kennedy, "no par
ents or students requested to leave Eu
rope."
BOSP students spending fall
quarter in Europe have reported virtu
ally no effect of the warning on daily
■j. life.
' "1 am a little more aware of my
surroundings, but other than that, I
don't think much has changed," Julia Kayser
'll wrote in an e-mail from Paris. "Fear is ex
actly what terrorists aim to inspire, so I think


ERIC KOFMAN/The Stanford Daily
an even-keeled response is the best
we can do."
Kayser said the atmosphere
among students had not changed
since before the alert, and her group's
BOSP weekend trip was not resched
uled in the weekend following the
alert's release.
Additionally, the vagueness of the
alert, such as a lack of specific loca
tions or time periods, may have de
flated the sense of severity it inspired
among students.
"The idea that something might
happen at some point somewhere in
Europe isn't going to make most peo
ple too worried," Aisha Ansano 'l2
said from Oxford. "Accidents and
other unpredictable things happen all
the time, but that doesn't stop people

from travelling,"
While she did not feel immediate
ly at risk, Ansano felt that the BOSP
responded appropriately to the alert.
"I think it's probably the right
amount," Ansano said. "It might seem
a little excessive, but when you think
about the fact that they're partially
responsible for us on Stanford's be
half, it seems like a good idea to go a
little beyond where they have to just
in case it's necessary."
BOSP has prepared for the possi
bility of a greater security threat as
well. A global response team is ready
at all times to discuss evacuation
plans if necessary.
Discussions of evacuation took
place earlier this year when an earth
quake struck on Feb. 27 in Santiago,
Chile, where the BOSP has a location.
The BOSP administration kept in
close contact to ensure the safety of
the students, all of whom desired to
stay in Chile and aid in the recovery
process.

As the status of the alert has not
changed since it was issued, the
BOSP students in Europe have not
allowed fear to interrupt their experi
ences.
"Worrying about the terrorist at
tacks isn't going to change the statisti
cal likelihood of their occurrence, so I
haven't given it a whole lot of
thought," Kayser said.
