## Europe travel alert elicits caution 
### STEVEN SMALLBERG 
The U.S. Department of State issued a travel alert on
Oct. 3 notifying American travelers of potential terror
ist attacks in Europe, where six of the Bing Overseas
Studies Program (BOSP) centers are located.
The alert, which will be in effect until Jan. 31,2011,
warned of possible attacks in tourist areas and trans
portation infrastructure in large European cities, be
lieved to be coordinated by al-Qaida and its affiliates.
The broad alert encompasses BOSP locations in
Berlin, Florence, Madrid, Moscow, Paris and Oxford.
The alert did not mention specific cities; counterter
rorism officials this month were assessing possi
ble threats against Britain, France and Ger
many, The New York Times reported.
Travel alerts are less severe than travel
warnings when a warning is issued, the i
Department of State generally advises
Americans to avoid visiting the country '
the warning concerns. Travel alerts, on the
other hand, are usually issued in response to
short-term conditions and instead advise that
citizens exercise particular vigilance while
traveling.
The BOSP administration reacted
promptly when the alert was released.
"We drafted a memo to the students,
advising them to look carefully at the
travel warning, give overseas staff their
contact information and alert program
staff of weekend plans," said Associate
Vice Provost and Executive Director

Irene Kennedy. "We also emphasize that they maintain
regular contact with their families."
Travel alerts and warnings are issued fairly regularly,
and the BOSP has an established protocol in place to re
spond accordingly. A recent Community Health Pro
gram in Oaxaca, Mexico was cancelled because of a gov
ernment-issued warning that included the entire nation.
"Stanford actually has a policy, issued by the provost,
that we do not send students to countries with travel

warnings," Kennedy said. "A travel warning
hile the quarter is underway, depending on
he situation, could require us to evacuate
students."
Kennedy said that some parents of
BOSP students contacted the program
asking what emergency plans were in
place, but, according to Kennedy, "no par
ents or students requested to leave Eu
rope."
BOSP students spending fall
quarter in Europe have reported virtu
ally no effect of the warning on daily
â– j. life.

surroundings, but other than that, I
don't think much has changed," Julia Kayser
