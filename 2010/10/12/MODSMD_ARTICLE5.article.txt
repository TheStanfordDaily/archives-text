## ASSU revives Pakistan flood relief effort 
### ELLORA ISRANI 
Media and humanitarian attention to devastating Pak
istan floods is dwindling, but the ASSU is implementing a
second wave of campaigns to revamp its Pakistan flood re
lief effort and, organizers hope, spike attention for the 20
million people affected by the summer disaster.
Spearheaded this August by Asfandyar Ali Mir 'l2, a
Pakistani student appointed as ASSU executive director
of Pakistan flood relief, along with ASSU President An
gelina Cardona'll and Vice President Kelsei Wharton'l2,
the campaign is a partnership with the United States
Agency for United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees (USA for UNHCR), the United Nations
refugee agency. Stanford has partnered with six other
schools Caltech, UC-Berkeley, Vanderbilt, Rice, Uni
versity of Ontario and Gettysburg College and is tar
geting 30 high-school and collegiate partners in the near
future.
Stanford is leading the fundraising efforts with an esti
mated $ll,lOO raised so far, with the second-largest dona
tion totaling $4,000 from Caltech. Cardona said the focus
is not on reaching a monetary benchmark, but instead on
raising awareness about the disaster on and around cam
pus.
Vineet Singal 'l2, who has been
helping with the campaign, said he
recently removed a personal plea in
his e-mail signature because of sev
eral questions from individuals who
believed the disaster and campaign
were over.
"I got several e-mails from people
who were like, 'Aren't the floods
over?"' Singal said. "No, it's not.The
relief effort is still going on."
A major obstacle continues to be
raising funds and encouraging in
volvement regardless of waning in
ternational support. Mir called the
floods "one of the biggest in the his
tory of humanitarian disasters" but
believed media coverage has been
inadequate. A native of Rawalpindi,
Mir has friends whose houses were
swept away in August by the floods.
His high school in Nowshera also
was destroyed.
Singal attributed the drop in pub
lic awareness to the declining media
coverage.
"When the international re
sponse subsided, so did the media at
tention, and then so did the personal
attention," Singal said.
The Stanford effort has used a
number of strategies, including Face
book statuses and postings, personal
appeals as e-mail signatures and a
blog with resources such as inter

views by UNHCR Goodwill Ambas
sador Angelina Jolie. A number of
students participated in "Walk for
Pakistan" on Sunday in Fremont, an
effort by the nonprofit organization
Focus, which is unaffiliated with the
ASSU.
One of the most effective meth
ods so far was a letter sent on Aug. 27
to students from Cardona and Whar
ton, asking students to donate just $5
to the cause.
"It's something they spend on a
Subway sandwich, it's something
they spend on a Starbucks coffee,"
Singal said. "It's nothing. It got peo
ple to think they could either have a

coffee or help people in Pakistan
who need it."
Given the success of the letter, the
next wave will likely focus on one
on-one strategies, such as having
ASSU senators send out personal e
mails.The ASSU has also gotten Ro
taract, a student service group, to
agree to match contributions, but the
details of this agreement have yet to
be defined. Mir is planning a panel
discussion on students' role in such
humanitarian crises.
The empathy that Stanford stu
dent feel in response to humanitari
an tragedy has a history of generat
ing of financial support on campus.
Last year, the ASSU ran a similar
campaign for relief for the earth
quake in Haiti, raising thousands of
dollars with partner organizations. A
number of contributions came from
the "Heal Haiti" event held in Stern
Dining, which raised $4,000 in just a
few hours, Cardona said. Many of the
individuals who worked for Haiti re
lief are also working for Pakistan re
lief.
"We have a lot of talent on our
team," Cardona said.
According to Mir, Stanford stu
dents "have a tradition of stepping
up."
"We did it for Katrina, for the
Southeast Asian tsunami, for Haiti
and have done it in part for Pakistan
as well," he said. "But more needs to
be done still."
