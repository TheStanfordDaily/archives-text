## ASSU revives Pakistan flood relief effort 
### ELLORA ISRANI 
Media and humanitarian attention to devastating Pak
istan floods is dwindling, but the ASSU is implementing a
second wave of campaigns to revamp its Pakistan flood re
lief effort and, organizers hope, spike attention for the 20
million people affected by the summer disaster.
Spearheaded this August by Asfandyar Ali Mir 'l2, a
Pakistani student appointed as ASSU executive director
of Pakistan flood relief, along with ASSU President An
gelina Cardona'll and Vice President Kelsei Wharton'l2,
the campaign is a partnership with the United States
Agency for United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees (USA for UNHCR), the United Nations
refugee agency. Stanford has partnered with six other
schools Caltech, UC-Berkeley, Vanderbilt, Rice, Uni
versity of Ontario and Gettysburg College and is tar
geting 30 high-school and collegiate partners in the near
future.
Stanford is leading the fundraising efforts with an esti
mated $ll,lOO raised so far, with the second-largest dona
tion totaling $4,000 from Caltech. Cardona said the focus
is not on reaching a monetary benchmark, but instead on
raising awareness about the disaster on and around cam
pus.
