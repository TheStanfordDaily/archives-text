## Researchers predict fate of embryos 
### CAROLINE CHEN STAFF WRITER 
Until recently, the precarious first moments of an
embryo's development have been a mystery to doc
tors and scientists. A team of Stanford researchers,
led by obstetrics and gynecology Prof. Renee Reijo
Pera, recently managed to film early embryonic de
velopment, thus discovering more accurate ways to
predict the success of an embryo developing into a
child.
In vitro fertilization (IVF) is an increasingly pop
ular form of infertility treatment for women. But
though the technology has existed since 1978 and
the successful birth of Louise Brown, the treatment
is still riddled with flaws and risks.
One major problem in IVF is the low pregnancy
rate that is, the percentage chance that a woman
who undergoes IVF will actually become pregnant.
Currently, IVF practitioners create several em
bryos, which are grown and observed for up to five
days before implantation. The practitioners pick
embryos that are dividing regularly, but up to now
there has been no way for doctors to predict
whether or not the fertilization will be successful.
Nationwide, the live birth rate with IVF is only 30
to 35 percent for women under 35 years old, accord
ing to the American Pregnancy Association. This
number continues to drop as the woman's age in
creases. Failures are costly not only financially,
but emotionally as well. Another potential conse
quence is the higher likelihood of twins and triplets,
which can result when multiple embryos are trans
ferred to increase the chance of success.
"It's difficult to tell if an embryo is going to make
it or not," said Reijo Pera. "It's been a problem ever
since 1978, and this is the number-one problem in
IVF."
Motivated by the low success rates in IVF, Reijo
Pera set out to study the human embryo. Working
with a team at Stanford's Institute for Stem Cell Bi
ology and Regenerative Medicine, Reijo Pera em
ployed time-lapse imaging techniques on more than
a hundred fertilized eggs to study their develop
ment.
Quickly, her team realized that the first stages of
embryonic development were in fact quite orderly
and not as chaotic as scientists had always pre
sumed. By the time the embryo had divided into
eight cells which is roughly "half the size of a

point of a pin," according to Reijo
Pera the cells were already acting
autonomously.
As a result, Reijo Pera realized
that the chances of survival were not
a murky mystery, but rather a pre
dictable process that could be mod
eled with mathematical formulas.
"We can predict success or failure
with over 93 percent accuracy," she
said.
Not only did they realize they
could predict the success rate, but
they could do so by the second day of
development.
"The embryo is still genetically
silent on day two," said Reijo Pera.
"The embryo has not even turned on
its genes. So the success or failure
must be genetically inherited."
Reijo Pera gives credit to devel
oping technology as a reason for this
latest discovery. She explained that
embryo development could be af
fected by light, so the microscopic
cameras had to work in dim condi
tions.

"There's also a component that
nobody has really thought to do this
before," she added. She hopes that
the discovery will help increase preg
nancy rates and reduce the complica
tions for women.
The technology has been licensed
by Auxogyn, Inc., a bio-tech company

in Menlo Park co-founded by Reijo
Pera. The company hopes to start
clinical trials by 2011 to determine if
success rates are equally accurate
outside the lab.
