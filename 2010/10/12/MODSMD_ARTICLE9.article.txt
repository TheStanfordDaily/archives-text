## ETCHED WITH INDIA In front of the Stanford bookstore, Raj and Narinder Singh sell handmade jewelry; scarves and ornaments using materials and themes from India 
### MARWA FARAG 
Outside the Stanford book
store every Monday and
Tuesday, Raj and Narinder
Singh bring a little bit of
India to Stanford.
In an unassuming stall reminiscent of
the copious bazaars of Southeast Asia,
they arrange jewelry, scarves and tradi
tional ornaments.
For the past five years, twice a week
from May to December, Raj and
Narinder have been giving Stanford stu
dents the opportunity to shop for authen
tic ethnic jewelry and trinkets. Why the
Stanford bookstore?
The bookstore staff "is so kind and co
operative, and it's a beautiful place,"
Narinder said.
The Singhs, an elderly Indian couple,
moved to the United States in 1992 when
their grandson, Jujhaar Singh 'l4, was
born. Through "trial and error," Narinder

said, she taught herself how to make Indi
an jewelry and handicrafts, and began to
show her work at art fairs and festivals,
such as the annual Jewish Cultural Street
Festival on California Avenue this month.
"I embroider, I crochet, I do a lot of
work ... it gives me satisfaction,"
Narinder said.
Using sterling silver, semiprecious
stones, wood, steel and copper, she creates
an array of pieces, from traditional bridal
jewelry to costume wear.
"I started with silver only, then I diver
sified," she said. "I like to follow the trends
of what people like. Sometimes I remake
pieces."
Raj and Narinder call their business
Thera Thera, in reference to the Sikh leg
end of Guru Nanak. It is said that the
Guru was a storekeeper at a state granary,
where one day he was weighing grain
packages and counting. Upon reaching
the thirteenth grain package, the Guru
went into a trance and began repeating,

"Thera, thera ..." Thera in Punjabi
means both the number 13 and the word
"thine" in a spiritual context.
"What it means is that whatever we
make here is yours, as in God's," Narinder
said. "Guru Nanak kept on saying, 'Thera,
thera' and distributing [the grain], but it
never finished."
Raj and Narinder combine pieces
made by Narinder, pieces imported from
India, and select Korean and Native
American pieces in a single, multicultural
display.The variety is evident: a gold Indi
an bridal headpiece is juxtaposed against
brightly colored plastic bracelets. A
wooden bangle engraved with the symbol
for "Om," a traditional meditation chant,
sits next to a necklace made with garnets
and green turquoise.
While jewelry dominates the stall,
scarves and Indian handicrafts make ap
pearances. A legion of small, meticulously
painted elephant ornaments sit next to
wooden carvings.

"We have turtles, owls and Indian
deities, traditional Indian ornaments," Raj
said.

Recognizing that some students are on
tight budgets, Narinder and Raj set the
prices accordingly.
"We try to keep rates low so it is af
fordable for students," Narinder said. In
deed, is it easy for the bright colors and
reasonable prices of the pieces on display
to lure passing students.
Raj and Narinder love interacting
with Stanford students and showcasing
their work and culture. Happy to answer
to the curious gaze of passing students,
they emphasized that it's the people on
campus who keep them coming back
every week.
Stanford "is the best place on earth,
and these are the best people on earth,"
Narinder said.
