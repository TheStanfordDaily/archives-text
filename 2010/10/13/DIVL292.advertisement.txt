Turn up the heat on dangerous mercury contamination of our air, creeks and San Francisco
Bay by disposing of your old mercury thermometer safely.
Digital thermometers are readily available, accurate and safer for your family and the environment. Local pharmacies
and other drop-off sites will collect mercury thermometers from October 1-31,2010. To dispose of your mercury
thermometer, place it in its original case (if available) or in two sealed or tied plastic bags. Remember: mercury
thermometers have a silver line (not red) showing the temperature - red lined thermometers are alcohol-based and
better for the planet.
