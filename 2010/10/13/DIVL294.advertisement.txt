Teaching Tales â€”
Students speak to the importance of teachers and
teaching in their undergraduate experience ...
The Center for Teaching and Learning is celebrating its thirty
fifth anniversary and we would like you to join the festivities in
a very special way. Since student perspectives on teaching have
played a central role in our work as a teaching center over the
years, we invite you to share your most significant or transfor
mative experience with a teacher. Please submit your recollec
tions in the form of a five-minute speech, bearing in mind that
the selected entry will be presented at a gathering of faculty,
staff, and students on November 9 at 3:45 pm. The winner will
receive a prize of $1,500.
The selection process will have two stages. First, please
submit a manuscript of your speech to
doree.allen@stanford.edu by Sunday, October 17.
A committee will review the submissions and select several
finalists. Finalists will be asked to deliver their speeches to
the committee, which will then select the contest winner.
Our selection committee will be seeking thoughtful, original,
and provocative reflections on teaching: May the best tale win!
