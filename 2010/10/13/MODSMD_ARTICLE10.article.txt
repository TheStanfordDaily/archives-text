## Writing off the lone genius' Creative writing lecturer Tom Kealey teaches a collaborative style 
### ANNA ROSALES 
If you walked into Meyer 220 on
a Tuesday night this quarter,
you would see students writing
together and critiquing each
other, each trying to complete a
50,000-word novel in just one month.
This room is the home of two experi
mental creative writing classes at
Stanford: "NaNoWriMo," short for
"National Novel Writing Month,"
and "The Graphic Novel." The force
behind both of these classes is cre
ative writing lecturer Tom Kealey.
Often, writing is perceived as a
solitary endeavor, but Kealey en
courages his students to work collab
oratively, and his classes reflect this
approach.
"The idea of collaborative writing
is really crucial," Kealey said. "In
most classes we're taught the Tone
genius' concept."
Instead, he likes to see teamwork
taught in writing as much as inde
pendence.
"It's difficult sometimes to write
in a vacuum," Kealey added. "And for
students to bounce ideas off of each
other, to give suggestions, it's an
amazing thing to see,"
For November, which is National
Novel Writing Month, creative writ
ing lecturer Scott Hutchins floated
the idea for a class where students
write 1,667 words a day for each of
the 30 days of November. The goal is
50,000 words (about the length of
Hemingway's "The Sun Also Rises")
by the end of the month.
NaNoWriMo, co-taught by
Kealey and Hutchins, is a class that
encourages students to give each
other feedback while completing
their own projects.
"The class is in many ways teach
ing students about what a writer's life
is like," Kealey said. "It's about get
ting the words down on the page
every day and understanding that
good writing is hard writing, and it
takes many drafts to find what you
want to say and say it right."
Both the students and the instruc
tors are writing in the class, allowing
for students to collaborate not only
with each other, but also with their in
structors. According to Kealey, what
he likes best about teaching under
graduate students is that he gets to
learn things, too.
"This may sound silly, but some
times I feel after two or three weeks
of my instructing that I've just be
come the most experienced student
in the class and I learn along with
them," he said.
Kealey has developed a reputa
tion for teaching innovative courses,
teaming up with creative writing pro
fessor Adam Johnson for a class
called "The Graphic Novel."
Johnson, who wanted to create a
course in which creative writing and
art students worked together to cre
ate a full-length graphic novel, con
ceived the class.
"I thought at first we were going to
make a pamphlet, but instead we
made a 200-page book," Kealey said.
The class was a challenging but
rewarding undertaking for the in
structors.
"I always say about 'The Graphic
Novel,' it's my most favorite class I've
ever taught, but it's also the most dif
ficult, and part of that is finding our
way," Kealey said. "You don't make
anything successful without either
setbacks or failures along the way."
In "The Graphic Novel," students
are confronted with the task of indi
vidually proposing novel topics and

then choosing one as a group.
"My favorite part of the class was
also the most uncomfortable part of
the class," Kealey recalled. "'Pika
don' [last year's novel] won in a vote
seven to six over another idea,
'Baghdad Burning.' Students debate,
negotiate, collaborate and eventually
decide on a topic and, through the
process, you can see students go from
disparate needs to having a commit
ment to the same project."
Students also recognized how
Kealey facilitated an engaging learn
ing environment. Avantika Agarwal
'l2 recalled a positive experience in
"The Graphic Novel" class.
"Never have I come across such a
warm, giving and wonderful teacher.
Tom creates the perfect classroom at
mosphere that respects and nurtures
each individual, while maintaining a
high standard of intellect."
Kealey fosters commitment and
community in his classes while at the
same time challenging his students to
go beyond their comfort zone.
"Writing can be a deeply personal,
challenging and downright embar
rassing experience but Tom does
an excellent job of making his stu
dents face all of that, consider it, and
then use it to fuel creativity," said Jes
sica Rowe 'l2, who took "Introduc
tion to Fiction Writing" with Kealey.
"Fie encourages students to be fear
less and learn through triumph and
through failure."
Kealey discovered his passion for
teaching in graduate school at the
University of Massachusetts,
Amherst, only after working as a bar
tender, a technical writer and an edi
tor for an art and literary magazine
called "Cities and Roads." After he
finished graduate school, he came to

Stanford as a Stegner Fellow in cre
ative writing in 2001 and was a Jones
Lecturer in creative writing from
2003 until he became a Senior Jones
Lecturer in 2006.
As a teacher, Kealey is drawn to
the commitment he sees in his stu
dents.
"Stanford students are intelligent
and motivated and also kind to each
other," Kealey said. "There's a sense
of cooperation and collaboration at
all the classes here at Stanford. I like
to be a part of that."
Kealey the writer is not far re
moved from Kealey the person. He
carries a notebook around with him
to capture a spontaneous inspiration
or catch interesting dialogue (though
he confesses that nowadays he most
ly jots down notes on his Blackberry).
"I once heard on the subway one
boy say to another, T don't want to
hug no skinny-bones girl,' and I
thought that that was an unusual and
odd thing to say, but also unique ...
And from that quote came a charac
ter and out of that character came a
story," Kealey said.
In his spare time, Kealey runs
marathons. Recently, he even swam,
biked and ran a triathlon, an experi
ence that gave him insight into his
writing. Intending to write an article
about the triathlon, Kealey created
an outline for the story beforehand.
"It's not until I ran the race that
the idea of the story changed com
pletely," Kealey said. "Everyone else
out there gets to run a half-marathon,
but with every step out there, I was
writing a story. Writers don't get to
rest."

go beyond their comfort zone.
"Writing can be a deeply personal,
challenging and downright embar
rassing experience but Tom does
an excellent job of making his stu
dents face all of that, consider it, and
then use it to fuel creativity," said Jes
sica Rowe 'l2, who took "Introduc
tion to Fiction Writing" with Kealey.
"Fie encourages students to be fear
less and learn through triumph and
through failure."
Kealey discovered his passion for
teaching in graduate school at the
University of Massachusetts,
Amherst, only after working as a bar
tender, a technical writer and an edi
tor for an art and literary magazine
called "Cities and Roads." After he
finished graduate school, he came to

Stanford as a Stegner Fellow in cre
ative writing in 2001 and was a Jones
Lecturer in creative writing from
2003 until he became a Senior Jones
Lecturer in 2006.
As a teacher, Kealey is drawn to
the commitment he sees in his stu
dents.
"Stanford students are intelligent
and motivated and also kind to each
other," Kealey said. "There's a sense
of cooperation and collaboration at
all the classes here at Stanford. I like
to be a part of that."
Kealey the writer is not far re
moved from Kealey the person. He
carries a notebook around with him
to capture a spontaneous inspiration
or catch interesting dialogue (though
he confesses that nowadays he most
ly jots down notes on his Blackberry).
"I once heard on the subway one
boy say to another, T don't want to
hug no skinny-bones girl,' and I
thought that that was an unusual and
odd thing to say, but also unique ...
And from that quote came a charac
ter and out of that character came a
story," Kealey said.
In his spare time, Kealey runs
marathons. Recently, he even swam,
biked and ran a triathlon, an experi
ence that gave him insight into his
writing. Intending to write an article
about the triathlon, Kealey created
an outline for the story beforehand.
"It's not until I ran the race that
the idea of the story changed com
pletely," Kealey said. "Everyone else
out there gets to run a half-marathon,
but with every step out there, I was
writing a story. Writers don't get to
rest."

Senior Jones Lecturer Tom Kealey leads a creative writing seminar. Kealey teaches classes including "NaNoWriMo"
and "The Graphic Novel."
If you walked into Meyer 220 on
a Tuesday night this quarter,
you would see students writing
together and critiquing each
other, each trying to complete a
50,000-word novel in just one month.
This room is the home of two experi
mental creative writing classes at
Stanford: "NaNoWriMo," short for
"National Novel Writing Month,"
and "The Graphic Novel." The force
behind both of these classes is cre
ative writing lecturer Tom Kealey.
Often, writing is perceived as a
solitary endeavor, but Kealey en
courages his students to work collab
oratively, and his classes reflect this
approach.
"The idea of collaborative writing
is really crucial," Kealey said. "In
most classes we're taught the Tone
genius' concept."
Instead, he likes to see teamwork
taught in writing as much as inde
pendence.
"It's difficult sometimes to write
in a vacuum," Kealey added. "And for
students to bounce ideas off of each
other, to give suggestions, it's an
amazing thing to see,"
For November, which is National
Novel Writing Month, creative writ
ing lecturer Scott Hutchins floated
the idea for a class where students
write 1,667 words a day for each of
the 30 days of November. The goal is
50,000 words (about the length of
Hemingway's "The Sun Also Rises")
by the end of the month.
NaNoWriMo, co-taught by
Kealey and Hutchins, is a class that
encourages students to give each
other feedback while completing
their own projects.
"The class is in many ways teach
ing students about what a writer's life
is like," Kealey said. "It's about get
ting the words down on the page
every day and understanding that
good writing is hard writing, and it
takes many drafts to find what you
want to say and say it right."
Both the students and the instruc
tors are writing in the class, allowing
for students to collaborate not only
with each other, but also with their in
structors. According to Kealey, what
he likes best about teaching under
graduate students is that he gets to
learn things, too.
"This may sound silly, but some
times I feel after two or three weeks
of my instructing that I've just be
come the most experienced student
in the class and I learn along with
them," he said.
Kealey has developed a reputa
tion for teaching innovative courses,
teaming up with creative writing pro
fessor Adam Johnson for a class
called "The Graphic Novel."
Johnson, who wanted to create a
course in which creative writing and
art students worked together to cre
ate a full-length graphic novel, con
ceived the class.
"I thought at first we were going to
make a pamphlet, but instead we
made a 200-page book," Kealey said.
The class was a challenging but
rewarding undertaking for the in
structors.
"I always say about 'The Graphic
Novel,' it's my most favorite class I've
ever taught, but it's also the most dif
ficult, and part of that is finding our
way," Kealey said. "You don't make
anything successful without either
setbacks or failures along the way."
In "The Graphic Novel," students
are confronted with the task of indi
vidually proposing novel topics and

then choosing one as a group.
"My favorite part of the class was
also the most uncomfortable part of
the class," Kealey recalled. "'Pika
don' [last year's novel] won in a vote
seven to six over another idea,
'Baghdad Burning.' Students debate,
negotiate, collaborate and eventually
decide on a topic and, through the
process, you can see students go from
disparate needs to having a commit
ment to the same project."
Students also recognized how
Kealey facilitated an engaging learn
ing environment. Avantika Agarwal
'l2 recalled a positive experience in
"The Graphic Novel" class.
"Never have I come across such a
warm, giving and wonderful teacher.
Tom creates the perfect classroom at
mosphere that respects and nurtures
each individual, while maintaining a
high standard of intellect."
Kealey fosters commitment and
community in his classes while at the
same time challenging his students to
go beyond their comfort zone.
"Writing can be a deeply personal,
challenging and downright embar
rassing experience but Tom does
an excellent job of making his stu
