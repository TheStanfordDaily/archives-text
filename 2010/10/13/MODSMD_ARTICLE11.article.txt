# Solicitor General files amicus brief for Stanford suit against Roche
## 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€” Tyler Brown 
The United States Solicitor Gener
al filed a "friend of the court" brief be
fore the United States Supreme Court
supporting Stanford in its intellectual
property lawsuit against biotech firm
Roche Molecular Systems, Inc. The
case stemmed from a dispute between
the University and Roche over the
ownership of patents used in the com
pany's HIV test kits.
In the brief, acting Solicitor Gener
al Neal Katyal expressed strong sup
port for Stanford and its peer institu
tions and has asked the Court to both
hear the case and decide in the Univer
sity's favor. It argues that the Bayh-
Dole Act, an intellectual property law
passed in 1980, prevents an inventor at
a federally funded U.S. university from
assigning ownership of his invention to
a third party.
The Federal Circuit Court of Ap
peals held last year that an agreement
between Roche's predecessor, Cetus,

and medical school professor and for
mer Cetus employee Mark Holodniy
gives the University and Roche dual
ownership of the patents in question.
The brief adds that the Appeals
Court's decision "creates serious un
certainty" about the ownership of
patents and "frustrates Congress's ef
forts to foster scientific research and
development".
Other universities and university
groups, including the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, the American
Association of Universities, the Amer
ican Council on Education and a con
sortium led by the Wisconsin Alumni
Research Foundation previously filed
briefs in support of Stanford.
