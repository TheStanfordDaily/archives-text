### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€” Ellen Huet 
A small fire in Synergy's kitchen
early Monday morning set off fire
alarms and woke up residents but did
not cause any lasting damage, accord
ing to assistant University fire marshal
Alison Pena.
The fire began in a plastic bin in the
kitchen that contained "oily rags,"
Pena said.
The fire was contained to the bin,
but it did set off smoke detectors and
prompted an evacuation of the house.
According to Pena, the firefighters
carried the bin outside and put out the
fire with a hose, There were no injuries
and no damages to the house apart
from the bin itself.
The call for the fire arrived at 2:30
a.m., and one engine responded to
Synergy from the campus fire station.
