## SENT FROM MY IPHONE You're Only 14 Twice 
### Peter McDonald 
Last week, the perpetually vacuous an
nals of correspondence that is the Dias
pora delivered to me a heartfelt letter
from Robin Thomas 'l2 that urged everyone
to "have all your mid-life crises now" and to
"stop trying to secure a joyful life later at the
expense of a joyful life now." All sound ad
vice. So far this week, I've lived a joyful-er life
than any of you assholes reading this. By the
end of Monday night, my third favorite T
shirt was completely soaked in the sweat of
dozens of 30-something shirtless South Bay
residents. My body is still somewhat sore, but
my soul had achieved unity if, you know,
you believe in that sort of thing. On Oct. 11,
Alice in Chains, along with Mastodon and
the Deftones, played at the San Jose State
University Events Center and some psyche
delic friends and I made the trip. It's now
fourth on my list of Best Decisions I've Made
in My Life.
Now at this point, a faction of you is con
templating dismissing the rest of my words as
the ramblings of a drugged out hippie or
burnout. To the doubters, I won't say any
thing as cliche as, "Free your mind, man." I'll
just ask that you reserve judgment until the
800 th word. You still with me? Radical, be
cause for some reason, Alice in Chains' ex
pertly constructed songs about heroin addic
tion were the biggest aid in preventing my
angsty prepubescent self from doing any
thing as stupid as attempting suicide. We all
had dark places in adolescence; it's what
made us work so hard. At that 5,000-seat
arena, I finally settled the score with 14-year
old Peter.
The show, by the way, was badass. I was
quite gratified to find out that no white man
alive could replicate Layne Staley's voice. Of
all the bands from Seattle to make it big,
Alice in Chains always had the most blue
collar fans, and the diversity of the South Bay
helped to balance out the prep school-trend
ing crowd that was more there to see the
Deftones (whose concert footage would
make a beautiful graphic novel, by the way).
I was by far the most hipster kid there. Even
better, I finally discovered the inspiring egal
itarianism that is the General Admission
floor (aka the mosh pit). No rich bastards in
the front row, just the people willing to fight
their way there. I'm never letting seating as
signments restrain my rocking again. All
their songs brought the requisite ferocity,
though their drummer had a tendency to
drag. The most soul-piercing moment came
when they busted "Nutshell" onto the audi
ence, a song that doubled as a seance for ol'
Layne. The venue was the most functional

municipal sports arena you've ever seen, per
fect for Jerry Cantrell smoking and drinking
on stage.
It was without a doubt the most hardcore
Monday night of my life, but after the lights
came on and I was able to reorient myself, my
inner Stanford student came out again, and
all I could think about was the work I still had
to do, stupid Poetry and Poetics. Waiting in
line at 7-Eleven for a recovery Slurpee, I felt
the pull of the Stanford bubble more than
ever. All I wanted was to retreat into the safe
ty of my studies and apologize to the Univer
sity for having too much fun on a Monday
night and to my fellow Bandies for bailing on
rehearsal to go have an actual once-in-a-life
time experience. It's that whole real-world
thing. It can get pretty annoying.
But please, do not despair, though I know
most of you aren't because you wouldn't
even attempt something so profligate. I re
member when RJD2 came to Kresge (R.1.P.)
freshman year (RJD2!) and no one on my
hall would go because it just so happened to
be during finals week. That's lame. In case
you forgot, we're supposed to be the iPod
Generation, a name that must make Steve
Jobs ecstatic. We care more about music than
any other prior generation. Our iTunes li
brary far outclasses our libraries of anything
else. I'm sure you all remember the first mu
sician you loved, and how you were ready to
forsake the world just to see him or her in
concert. Suppressing that child because you
have a paper due, or because you're sick, or
because you didn't budget for it is your first
step toward becoming boring. So please,
keep track of your favorite bands from ado
lescence. If they're coming on tour, go see
them. Save your money, and if you have an
assignment due the next day, manage your
time properly. Your 14-year-old self will
thank you. Oh, and do it soon, because I have
a suspicion that in 10 years, no one's going to
be hyperventilating over a Passion Pit re
union.
