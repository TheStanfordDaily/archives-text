## Data Should Drive ASSU Legislation 
### STEWART MACGREGOR-DENNIS '13 ASSU Undergraduate Senator 
More data should be considered when
passing legislation than just the
number of hands raised on either
side. Debate about how the student body
feels about an issue should be based on statis
tical evidence, rather than on speculation.
Feedback on bills should be taken from all
students on a regular basis, rather than once
a week and just from those that show up to
the right meeting.
These are ideas that have begun to rise
in this year's ASSU Undergraduate Senate
and may well be the differentiating quality
for this year's legislative branch of the
ASSU. Creating a student government that
we can be proud of comes down to the sum
of the impact of the decisions we make. Op
timizing these decisions is the place to start.
The operation of the ASSU has a direct
impact on every single Stanford student.
Stanford is such an incredible community
in large part due to the fact that the stu
dents around you are engaged in enriching
and edifying activities. Every student I
know at Stanford is a leader in some way,
and we all benefit from this. The ASSU is
an enabler; it helps students make those
unbelievable activities happen. The ASSU
is Stanford and Stanford is the ASSU.
Former Election Commissioner Quinn
Slack 'll recently wrote an excellent cri
tique of some of the issues in student gov
ernment for a campus publication. He high
lighted from a data perspective many of the

issues around funding that need to be ad
dressed. This is the kind of data-driven con
tribution that is hugely valuable to helping
the student body. There are student that do
care; we just need to find the Quinn Slacks.
"Data-driven" may not be the most sexy
term. Then again, I am a computer science
major, so I won't comment on my senti
ment on whether it is or not. Anyway, the
point is that I'm writing this to let you
know that we would like your help. At
Tuesday's Senate meeting, a bill was pre
sented to electronically survey students
each week on legislation; we want your
input. Appropriations Committee Chair
Rafael Vasquez 'l2 is doing a great job
leading the committee in a data-driven ef
fort to optimize our funding policies. Help
us analyze your output. Senate Chair
Michael Cruz 'l2 is leading from the front
in his charge to make decisions with evi
dence, improve based on proof, and create a
better Stanford based on what people actual
ly want. Help us decide how our collective re
sources are best put.
To be clear, I'm talking numbers, not gam
bling. The risk is in making decisions based
on shadows on the wall. Data can lead us at
least part of the way out of the cave. The time
for conjectures is over, unless they're mathe
matical ones. Let's do this.
