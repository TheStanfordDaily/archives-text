# LOOKING UP
## Please List All Prior Assumptions 
### Nina M. Chung 
One of the easiest daily assumptions
we each carry is that we know our
selves and how we live. We know our
own clothing preferences, what foods we
don't like, what we think is funny and all of
those beautiful facets of personality that
crystallize into who we are. This is the rea
son I love asking people about their fa
vorites: they're our simplest distinctions. We
know what they are and feel security be
cause of it. We take for granted that we will
act according to our identities, because if
that were up in the air, every day would be a
self-reflexive philosophical crisis. (Ohmy
gosh that sounds horrible.) So it's all good!
We can bullet-point our correct character
adjectives and speed through personality
quizzes. It'd be weird if we couldn't, after liv
ing with ourselves for the past 20-ish years.
That's a mighty long time to get to know
someone, if you ask me.
. . . Then again, maybe not. Because I'm
heading toward 21 years and this girl in the
mirror is getting unexpectedly good at
throwing me curve balls. Isn't that just the
absurdist thing? That we can surprise our
selves? That the phrases "Before I knew it, I
was ..." or "Suddenly, I found myself ..."
exist at all is mind-boggling. I mean, we are
ourselves.
But it's Life As Unusual, Cont'd as I find
myself speedily undermining certain "facts"
I "knew" about how I act. Recently, I've been
letting something highly unfamiliar develop,
sans my go-to over-analysis and deconstruc
tion ... and I'm really, completely not used
to that. (I know this sounds super-vague, but
the specifics aren't the point.) Right now, I'm
entertaining an idea that could potentially
cause me future anxiety, and readers? That's

so not me. In many ways, my style is clear
cut, no ambiguity, thank-you-very-much,
good bye. I thought that was pretty solid. But
I realized that for so long prior to these new
little episodes, much of that didn't have ex
periential precedence ... or maybe it did,
once or twice. Mostly, they were decisions I
had made about myself that existed to pre
scribe my future, too. This time I'm taking a
what do they call it? Oh, yeah. A chance. I
find myself stepping into a particular oppor
tunity, against my former self-medicated
judgment.
We make so many kinds of assumptions
about who we are and will always be. Do any
of the following sound familiar to you? I've
only been good at math, so there's no way
I'm good at creative writing. I work best
under pressure, which is why I won't ever
get enough sleep. I can't connect with peo
ple in class because I'm shy, and they think
I'm boring. I need to be in a relationship be
cause being alone means being lonely. Or,
I'm too independent, and no relationship
will be meaningful enough to be worth the
effort.
To be sure, we each have our Bad Past Mem
ories that by default become our present/fu
ture To Not Do lists. We learn from our mis
adventures and count on the lessons learned

to be static. It's necessary, of course, because
otherwise we'd have to re-experience pain
and discomfort all the time. Blech.That'd be
like having to re-learn everyday not to
touch the hot stove or something.
Really, though, when it comes to our own
person and ideas of our future, who are we
to set things in stone? I feel quite strongly
that there are only a few things in life of
which we can all be truly assured, and our
preferences and "types" and ideals of today
somehow don't seem to fit the bill. We
change, we grow, we learn, and it's cliche be
cause it's undeniably true. Things we
"know" about ourselves can become dicta
tors of future decisions, and the longer we
reinforce them, the more we close doors
without realizing it. Is that not scary? We're
Stanford students who question everything.
It should be okay to question ourselves
sometimes, too.
So surprise, surprise! Turns out I don't
know everything after all. Turns out I can't
plan everything on my own. Ultimately,
though, it turns out that there are way bigger
things at work in my life than any of my
greatest intellectual, rational or deductive
epiphanies will ever be able to catch up to.
On one level, it's terrifying to leave the
crutch that I've got the final word on every
thing that affects me. But beyond that point
less endeavor to command my entire reality
is a beautiful freedom. It comes with recog
nizing that despite my strongest man-made
intentions, something might just sweep me
off my feet in away I surely could not have
foreseen.
