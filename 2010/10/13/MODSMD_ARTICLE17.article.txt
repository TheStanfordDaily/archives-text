# LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Man up, you pansies

Dear Editor,
So the incomparable Victor Davis Han
son spoke truth to stupidity about "diversi
ty," and the stupid responded the only way
the stupid know how: with a gutless anony
mous attempt to shout down an argument
they didn't like and aren't capable of en
gaging and in fact, made absolutely no
effort to engage.
You claim Hanson damages Stanford
with his undeniable truths? No, you damage
Stanford with your lockstep "thinking" and
inability to partake in a reasoned (and rea
sonable) exchange of ideas yet isn't that
supposed to be the whole reason universi
ties exist? Cowards. You are a disgrace to
your institution, and to America. How 'bout
you grow some and actually take on the de
bate? You've already lost it, of course, so it's
understandable that you avoid it but it's
not understandable that you try to silence
your intellectual betters along the way.
On the other hand, if it was your goal to
prove beyond the shadow of a doubt one of
Hanson's primary points, that "the university

is the most politically intolerant and mono
lithic institution in the country," well then, I
congratulate you on a job superbly done.
Nitwits.

Diversity?

Dear Editor,
I worked at Fannie Mae for seven years. I
know how "diversity" works, and Professor
Victor Davis Hanson has it EXACTLY right.
You seem to be clinging to some archaic no
tion that affirmative action is helpful, and you
fail to notice the destructive consequences of
that policy. I believe "diversity" and "affirma
tive action" are very "do-good" ideas, but
until we get to the point of judging people for
the content of their character and not the
color of their skin, then we will continue to
endure racism. Affirmative action and clumsy
"diversity" programs extend racism from
what I've seen in the real world. I think if you
woke up and were honest with yourself, you
might see the same thing. I could be wrong.

Truth is something that leftists
cannot abide

Dear Editor,
I love how the extreme Left (and I mean
those united progressives at your paper) re
spond to the TRUTH. Truth is something
that leftists cannot abide; it is not touchy
feely, or perhaps it doesn't sound nice, or
maybe it doesn't make the reader feel good.
However, it passes the rigorous examina
tions of fact, and if it impeaches the rigidly
held beliefs of the small-minded leftists, it
must be countered with personal attacks and
slurs that are based on beliefs and feelings,
and not facts. Racist? How can any rep
utable journalist come to such a conclusion?
Perhaps I should reiterate what a journalist
is supposed to do: "Who, what, where, why, in
an unbiased, factual manner." Basic journal
ism has never been abandoned so freely as
by the sophomoric hacks at your poor little
unprincipled paper.
