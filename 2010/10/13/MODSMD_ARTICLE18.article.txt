## Time for baseball to modernize 
### Kabir Sawhney 
Baseball needs instant re
play. The debate is over.
No, seriously, it's over.
Wait, it's not over? How
can this still be an ongoing
issue? After a weekend of botched
calls that could have been decisive,
after a season that saw Armando
Galarraga lose a perfect game (on the
27th out, no less), there are some
people, both inside Major League
Baseball and outside of it, that con
tinue to insist that there's no need to
expand the use of instant replay.
These people cite a number of hare
brained reasons to continue with the
way things are.
So, instead of rehashing the nu
merous reasons for the adoption of
instant replay (chiefly that it would
allow umps to get calls right, which is,
you know, their job), let's take a look
at the twisted logic that seems to rule
the mind of baseball commissioner
Bud Selig on this issue.
Reason 1: Replay can't help um
pires in a lot of situations.
To its credit, this argument does
apply to some aspects of the game.
Balls, strikes and checked swings
are, to an extent, subjective based
on the umpire of the day. While one
day it may be possible to use tech
nology to improve ball-strike calls,
today's technology isn't sophisticat
ed enough to define the strike zone
accurately for every single hitter
and provide complete consistency.
That being said, there are a lot of
situations where replay could defi
nitely apply beyond calling home
runs and questionable fair/foul
calls. Replay could be used to deter
mine whether a fielder had appro
priately applied the tag to a sliding
runner, whether a runner was safe
or out at first base, if a fielder had
made a diving catch, etc. Every re
play technology does have some
limitations even football, the
sport that has most enthusiastically
adopted replay, has some types of
plays that are not reviewable calls
(especially on penalties). But just
because it can't help on every call
doesn't mean that it shouldn't be
used on the calls it can make accu
rate.
Reason 2: Human error is part of
the game.
Human error isn't just a part of
baseball; it's a part of everyday life.
However, just because we make mis
takes naturally doesn't mean that we
shouldn't use technology to mini
mize those mistakes. In baseball, a
hitter missing a pipe fastball is a re
sult of human error; a base runner
misreading the signs is human error;
two fielders running into each other
is human error.
The human error in umpiring is
the type of error we should seek to

eliminate. We want the rules to be
fairly, evenly and correctly applied to
everyone; it's extremely harmful
when a group of umpires stands clue
less on the field as the TV audience
watches them proven wrong in crys
tal-clear 1080p hi-def. Galarraga's
perfect game is an ideal example:
Human perfection was taken away
by human error, but the error was
from an authority that, ideally, will be
correct 100 percent of the time.
When we have the ability to reach
that ideal, I fail to see why baseball
stubbornly refuses to utilize it.
Reason 3: Replay will add a lot of
time to games.
Look guys, if you're really wor
ried about how long the games are
taking (and trust me, it's a damn long
time), you have bigger worries than
the amount of time a replay review
might take. The average time of a
baseball game has been steadily
creeping up, and the sport has been
losing fans and interest as a result. I
could probably write an entirely sep
arate column on this issue, but suf
fice it to say for now that it's some
thing else that needs to be tackled.
The best way to handle this
problem would be to have a fifth
umpire up in the booth responsible
solely for replay (similar to the re
play official at college football
games). If nowhere else, this extra
umpire should at least be utilized
for the playoffs, so that he can re
view calls quickly and relay infor
mation down to the crew chief on
the field. For the regular season, if
baseball doesn't want to add an
extra umpire to every crew, man
agers can be given a single chal
lenge, and (similar to football) get
the challenge back if they win it.
Reason 4: Tradition.
Baseball simply doesn't want to
move out of its storied past, when it
truly was the "national pastime " (and
before it was rocked by the Steroid
Era). Well, here's a newsflash: Base
ball is declining in popularity across
the nation, as people flock to more
fast-paced sports that don't take a
minute between every 10 seconds of
action (i.e. football). Sticking to tra
dition hasn't helped baseball any up
to this point, so why should it help on
the issue of umpiring calls?
The sport needs to begin moving
into the modern age more rapidly,
and instant replay is one area that it
can quickly adopt that would instant
ly restore some of its lost credibility.
Baseball's reputation has been tar
nished by steroids, and its fan follow
ing is growing more and more disillu
sioned with every season. It's time to
start restoring some of that credibili
ty by making sure that the play on the
field is as fair and even as possible.

The previous column is under review.
