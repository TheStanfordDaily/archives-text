# LUCK TOPS DAILY'S HEISMAN POLL
## 
### DAILY SPORTS STAFF 
We ran an experiment this week
under the guise of a poll. The task was
simple: choose your top three choices for
the Heisman Trophy at the halfway
point of the college football season. We
bombarded The Daily's staff with e
mails and reminders. Ultimately, 22 peo
ple voted. For our intent, we'll deem that
a critical mass.
The results are as follows: Stanford's
Andrew Luck barely edged out Michi
gan's Denard Robinson, with Ohio
State's Terrelle Pryor and Oregon's
LaMichael James tying for third place
Pryor gets the edge because he had
more first place votes. A first-place vote
counts for three points; second place,
two points: and third place, one point.
Robinson had the most first-place votes.
The writers, editors, artists and pho
tographers who participated came from
a variety of sections and possess a wide
spectrum of knowledge. Some are foot
ball fanatics who spent days considering
then choices; others admitted to know
ing next to nothing about the game. We
find this to be a fair reflection of the ac
tual pool of Heisman voters, many of
whom have admitted to not actually
watching a tremendous number of
games or paying attention to entire con
ferences altogether. Also, as with the ac
tual Heisman, we sent out the poll be
fore all the games of the season's first
half had been played; early judgments
are a centerpiece of the Heisman voting
process. As such, there are ballots from
before and after last Saturday's contests.
Finally, we acknowledge a certain
Stanford bias. There were 33 players on
the ballot, mainly chosen for their pres
ence on the StiffArmTrophy.com voter
poll. Two are from Stanford: Luck and
Owen Marecic. We told our staff the fol
lowing: "If you objectively think they de
serve votes, go for it. If your desire to mark
them down is driven only by your colle
giate affiliation, reconsider your choices."
But at the end of the day, the Heis
man vote is driven by biases, and the vot
ers themselves are not particularly shy
about it. So, ultimately, there are three
notes about our poll: It was taken both
before and after the "final" week's ac
tion, some voters don't know a whole lot
about the sport and a few participants
have slanted views.
If we're imitating the Heisman voting
process, we might as well go all out. That
is the experiment: to see how closely we
could imitate general balloting practices,
and how close our results match up with
conventional thought. Tell us if we suc
ceeded.
Below, four writers explain their
choices.
Jacob Jaffe
Votes: First: Kellen Moore. Second:
Cameron Newton. Third: Denard Robin
son.
Most of you probably aren't giving
Kellen Moore enough credit, just like
you aren't giving his team enough cred
it. Yet the Boise State Broncos are pro
jected to take over first place in next
weekend's BCS standings, and their un
doubted leader is Moore. It is a reason
able argument to say that Boise State is

under more pressure than any other
team in the country, because fans and
media all over the nation are rooting for
the Broncos to fail. A win for any other
team is good enough, but just winning
won't cut it for Boise State; the Broncos
need to dominate.
And dominate they have, led by
Moore. Despite the pressure of winning
"impressively" every week, Moore leads
the nation in passing efficiency, throwing
only one interception and taking only
one sack in five games to go with his 14
touchdowns.'lhe Heisman nearly always
goes to a strong leader on a title-con
tending team, and Moore has been the
most reliable, efficient passer in the
country, and he plays for the likely No. 1
team.

After Moore, a number of candidates
have been impressive. Auburn's Cam
Newton has the distinction of being the
top-rated passer outside of Boise, and he
has mixed in some incredible plays on
the ground. Newton leads the country in
yards per attempt through the air, and he
is also 12th in the nation in rushing. Com
bine this with Auburn's unbeaten record
(albeit against lackluster foes) and New
ton is a strong No. 2. If he leads Auburn
to a BCS bowl and maintains these num

bers, he would likely jump Moore, but
Auburn hasn't proven itself to be a true
title contender.
Denard "Shoelace" Robinson
topped most ballots as recently as a week
ago, but he ran into his first good oppo
nent in Michigan State, and the Spartans
knocked him down a peg or two. Robin
son's three interceptions in that game
took some of the luster off his earlier per
formances, but he has still done things
that few players have ever done in the
history of college football. He still (easi
ly) leads the nation in rushing at 991
yards, and even with the three picks, he
remains the country's 12th-rated passer
and comes in fifth in yards per attempt.
"Shoelace" might fall off when he starts
facing more good defenses (lowa, Wis
consin and Ohio State all remain on the
schedule), but for now he is still a top
three performer.
KabirSawhney
Votes: First: LaMichael James. Second:
Denard Robinson. Third: Marcus Latti
more.

With apologies to Darron Thomas,
James has been the most electrifying
playmaker on the country's most elec

trifying offense. In Oregon's toughest
game to date, against then-No. 9 Stan
ford, James was masterful, brutalizing
the Cardinal's physical front seven and
rushing for 257 yards on 31 carries (a
ridiculous 8.3 yards per carry), as well as
three touchdowns. More than any other
player, James is responsible for the
Ducks leading the country in a whole
bunch of statistical categories on of
fense, which is why I'm giving him the
nod as my midseason Heisman No. 1.
Robinson has been insane, period,
and before last weekend's perform
ance, when he tossed up three picks to
Michigan State, he would have easily
slid into the top spot. He has over 1,200
yards passing and almost 1,000 yards
rushing in just six games, and if he keeps
up this torrid pace he'll easily win the
award at the end of the season. Howev
er, Robinson may not have the pieces
assembled next to him necessary to
continue his production.
Lattimore's stats have looked pretty
pedestrian so far: 459 rushing yards
through six games for the Gamecocks.
He's on this list not because he's statisti
cally impressive, but because his explo
siveness and sheer running ability have
almost single-handedly taken South
Carolina from a middling, unranked
team to a top-10 ranking and a con
tender for the SEC East title. Lattimore
has given Gamecocks head coach Steve
Spurrier the kind of backfield threat he
has never had in his tenure, and the re
sults speak for themselves.
Dan Bohm
Votes: First: Denard Robinson. Sec
ond: LaMichael James. Third: Patrick
Peterson.
I guess my ballot is a lesson in why
you should wait until the last possible
second to cast your vote for any award.
Of course I voted before last weekend's
games and my first choice, Michigan
quarterback Denard Robinson, went


JONATHAN YORK/The Stanford Daily

and threw three picks and my third
choice, LSU defensive back Patrick Pe
terson, muffed a punt. Still, I believe my
ballot holds up.
Robinson has been the best player
on the field in every game. He has run
rampant all over the field and made
Michigan football relevant again. Oh,
and he has also put up video game-like
numbers.
LaMichael James got my second
place vote, and if the award goes to
whom it often has in the past the best
player on the best team (read: Mark In
gram, Troy Smith, USC players)
then the award may easily swing to the
running back that dropped 257 rushing
yards on our very own Cardinal.
Peterson definitely deserves to be in
contention. He does everything he
hits, he covers and he is the best return
man in the game. There is some hesita
tion, I believe, among voters to select a
defensive player, but the award is sup

posed to go to the best player, not the
best offensive player, so if Peterson fits
that mold, why not?
Zach Zimmerman
Votes: First: Terrelle Pryor. Second:
LaMichael James. Third: Taylor Mar
tinez.
The Terrelle Pryor hype train has
been full speed ahead since he came into
college football two years ago. Despite
glimpses of greatness, he remained ab
surdly inconsistent through his first two
seasons. Now, as a junior, Pryor is leading
an undefeated Buckeyes team to what, at
the very worst, will be a Rose Bowl ap
pearance.The strength of schedule hasn't
been fantastic, but Pryor has mutilated
opposing defenses to the tune of 1,349
yards and 15 touchdowns while complet
ing 68 percent of his passes. His ability to
scramble is what makes him such a dan
gerous weapon, but it's his newfound
touch on the deep ball that has finally
placed him among the college quarter
backing elite. If Ohio State runs the table
and he continues to demonstrate phe
nomenal accuracy, it will be hard to select
anyone over Pryor.

I may be overrating James based on
his performance against Stanford (257
yards and three touchdowns), but it's
hard to ignore his value and skill. He's
already amassed 847 yards on over
seven yards per carry. His 10 total
touchdowns leads the most dynamic of
fense in the country, and he's put Ore
gon in prime position to win a national
title. What's most striking to me is his
ability to hold on to the ball he has
never lost a fumble in a Ducks uniform.
Martinez is a little bit of a reach, but
the freshman quarterback is the main
reason why Nebraska is returning to its
glory days. As a quarterback, he's aver
aging more than 10 yards per carry. He's
accumulated 12 rushing touchdowns
on the year, and although he's not the
purest of passers (660 yards and three
scores), he is undoubtedly one of the
best playmakers in college football. Just
ask Kansas State. Martinez torched the
Wildcats for 241 yards and four touch
downs on the ground and 128 yards and
a score through the air.
