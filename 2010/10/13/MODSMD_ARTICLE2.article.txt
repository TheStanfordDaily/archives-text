## Brown, Whitman debate for last time before looming vote Candidates scrutinize each other's records at Dominican U. event 
### PAUL JONES 
SAN RAFAEL —Three
weeks before the Nov. 2 elec
tion, California gubernatorial
candidates Meg Whitman, Re
publican and former CEO of
eßay, and Democrat Attorney
General Jerry Brown met for a
final war of words. Moderated
by former NBC Nightly News
anchor Tom Brokaw, the de-

bate at Dominican University focused on issues
such as the state's fiscal crisis and economy.
It wasn't long before Brown and Whitman
began sparring with each other.
"I wouldn't totally eliminate the capital
gains tax, which my opponent Meg Whitman
wants to do," Brown said. "That would add $5
billion to $lO billion to our budget deficit," he
added.
"The tax he likes so much is a tax on jobs,"
Whitman said.
"How much money will you save if this tax
break goes into effect?" Brown asked of Whit
man, a billionaire.
"I'm an investor, and investors will benefit
from this, but so will j ob creators, and I was a j ob
creator," Whitman said.
By contrast. Whitman said Brown's record
showed he would hurt California's economy.

"Jerry Brown talks about
having created all these jobs
when he was governor,"
Whitman said. "But the fact
is, unemployment nearly
doubled to what was then a
record number of nearly 11
percent."
"We had something
called a business cycle,"

Brown shot back. "We did create new jobs. Yes,
we were in a recession, and two years later Cal
ifornia was booming again."
Brokaw interjected.
"At the end of Mr. Brown's term as gover
nor, it was in the middle of the Ronald Reagan
recession," he said. "Illinois, Ohio, Indiana and
Tennessee all had Republican governors and
higher unemployment rates at the time."
Later, Brokaw asked Whitman about her
decision to spend upward of $l4O million on a
political campaign, despite her spotty voting
record. Whitman called her lack of civic partic
ipation "wrong," but said her wealth allowed
her to be independent and said Brown owed
public employee unions.
"If Jerry Brown gets to be governor of this
state, there will be a meeting... of all the union
bosses who are there to collect all the lOUs for
their having funded Jerry Brown's entire cam
paign," Whitman said.
Brown said Whitman's special interests are
the rich.
"She's raised $3O million from the kind of

Brown
corporate executives who will benefit
directly from her key economic plan,
which is not to invest in schools, but
take money from schools," Brown
said.
Whitman said Brown's union con
nections were the real threat to educa
tion.
"I have never said I want to cut
spending on education," Whitman
said. "Only 60 cents of every dollar
goes to the classroom. Forty percent
goes to the bureaucracy... that's why
the next governor cannot be beholden
to the California Teachers Associa
tion, because they want to protect that
bureaucracy. And the number two
contributor to Jerry Brown's inde
pendent expenditures attacking me is
the California Teachers Association."
Brokaw raised the recent scandals
that have rocked both campaigns, first
broaching an incident where a voice
mail recording revealed a member of
Brown's campaign calling Whitman a
"whore,"
"We've heard no outrage from you
about the use of that kind of language,
which to many women is the same as
calling an African-American the 'n
word,"' Brokaw said.
"I don't agree with that compari
son," Brown said. But, he said, "my
campaign apologized promptly, and I
affirm that apology tonight."
Whitman found herself in the hot
seat when Brokaw visited her hiring of
an undocumented immigrant as a maid
in 2000. The maid was fired in 2009
after Whitman said she found out
about the woman's immigration status.
"You said businesses and house
holds ought to be held accountable for
employing undocumented workers,"
Brown said. "If you couldn't find out
someone in your home was undocu
mented or illegal, how do you expect
businesses to be able to?"
"It broke my heart, but I had to fire
her," Whitman said. "This is why we
need a very good e-verify system that
allows businesses of every size to look
at the documentation and know if it is
real or not."
"I think it's a sorry tale, after work
ing for her for nine years, she didn't
even get her a lawyer," Brown said.
