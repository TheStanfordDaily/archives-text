# TREE-SON FOR DEBATE
## 
### Alyssa London 
Stanford prides itself on diversity, \
and maybe that is why we should respect
this year's Tree for "what it is" —it broke f I
away from the mold of the coniferous evergreen
redwood Tree of the last four years. But al
though we have had unique Trees in the past, such as a palm
tree, I find this year's deciduous tree to be more cringe-wor
thy than some of these past creations.
The "non-traditional" palm trees of the past make
sense, to an extent, because they are strewn all over
our campus, but tree diversity in our mascot is
tricky. Do we want tradition or diversity? Do we
want our Tree mascot to look like what is por
trayed in the Stanford logo or do we want it to
keep us guessing?
Personally, I want tradition, and to see what _

I imagine when I think of the Stanford Tree out
there dancing around on the field. I want to know that next year
our mascot is not going to manifest itself as a bonsai tree or some- \
thing more ridiculous and "non-Stanford" than even that.
To try to gauge campus sentiment, I sent out a survey to my di- k
verse assortment of e-mail lists asking how people perceived this V
year's Stanford Tree. I received 250 responses, largely reporting
that this year's Tree has not been favorably received. •,
Seventy percent of my respondents reported they do not like the Tree cos
tume. Of those respondents, 25 percent said they flat out hated it. Only 25 per
cent said they liked it and of those, eight percent loved it. An overwhelming 90
percent of respondents said the Tree should be a redwood and not deciduous, I
and 70 percent said this year's costume is not an accurate representation of 1
our mascot. Some of the survey respondents were particularly outspoken, £
and below is a sample of their responses: 4
