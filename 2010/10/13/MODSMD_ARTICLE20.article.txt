# TREE-SON FOR DEBATE
## 
### Alyssa London 
Stanford prides itself on diversity, \
and maybe that is why we should respect
this year's Tree for "what it is" —it broke f I
away from the mold of the coniferous evergreen
redwood Tree of the last four years. But al
though we have had unique Trees in the past, such as a palm
tree, I find this year's deciduous tree to be more cringe-wor
thy than some of these past creations.
The "non-traditional" palm trees of the past make
sense, to an extent, because they are strewn all over
our campus, but tree diversity in our mascot is
tricky. Do we want tradition or diversity? Do we
want our Tree mascot to look like what is por
trayed in the Stanford logo or do we want it to
keep us guessing?
Personally, I want tradition, and to see what _

I imagine when I think of the Stanford Tree out
there dancing around on the field. I want to know that next year
our mascot is not going to manifest itself as a bonsai tree or some- \
thing more ridiculous and "non-Stanford" than even that.
To try to gauge campus sentiment, I sent out a survey to my di- k
verse assortment of e-mail lists asking how people perceived this V
year's Stanford Tree. I received 250 responses, largely reporting
that this year's Tree has not been favorably received. •,
Seventy percent of my respondents reported they do not like the Tree cos
tume. Of those respondents, 25 percent said they flat out hated it. Only 25 per
cent said they liked it and of those, eight percent loved it. An overwhelming 90
percent of respondents said the Tree should be a redwood and not deciduous, I
and 70 percent said this year's costume is not an accurate representation of 1
our mascot. Some of the survey respondents were particularly outspoken, £
and below is a sample of their responses: 4

"IT'S NOT THE STANFORD
TREE!!!!"
"I think it's great I like that its
different and think that people criti
cizing it should understand better that
the Tree is remade every year by the
new Tree and it'saTON of work!"
"I like it because a Tree is a tree,
but I like last year's Tree better."
"Though I appreciate the creative
efforts, I think this year's costume
does not hit the mark. A. It should be
a redwood. B. There should be more
of an element of anonymity. C. The
costume should accentuate the jig,
and the jig should accentuate the cos
tume: they should work as one. D.The
Tree is really, really not good."
"This year's Tree is definitely silli
er than last year, and to me it seems
the point is to be silly. So in that re
spect it's more successful."
"It looks like a dead broccoli or
stalk of celery from "Veggie Tales"
with bulging eyes. Ew. Especially how
the bottom part looks dead and the
top part is green ... just no."

"It has phallic characteristics ..."
"Personally, I think it looks more
like a Tree. However, sometimes
when he dances his eyes look like
boobs overall its appearance is
psychotic and frightening."
"When I think of the Stanford
Tree, the image I get in my head is
that of the redwood, not whatever
this is."
"It looks like a bush on a stick."
We have to accept that the Stan
ford Tree is already not a very serious
mascot. The nature of the Stanford
Tree is to be quirky. After all, the Tree
is affiliated with the Stanford band,
not the University.
Yet, the new Tree's appearance
may take quirkiness too far. Since
this year's Tree is deciduous, it de
tracts from Stanford's image of
"brawn" (after all, year after year we
win the Director's Cup for our athlet
ic dominance). Deciduous trees lose
their leaves seasonally and look like
skeletons for a large portion of the
year. At least the redwood Tree mas
cot symbolizes old growth, an im
pressive large size, beauty and tradi
tion within our school by represent
ing our classic Tree logo.
Stanford football is doing great
this year. By the time the bowl season

rolls around, our deciduous friend
should have lost its leaves for the
winter. How can we stand behind a
mascot that looks like it is weak and
hibernating? How does that generate
school spirit and pump the crowd up?
Stanford Tree, thank you for your
creativity and for representing a cul
ture of a school that doesn't need to
take itself too seriously I must say
this year's rendition is very unique! I
liked the spiced-up appearance of the
Tree with lights through the leaves for
the first home game and the clothes
for this last game against USC. The
Tree mascot in general is pretty cool
because it is weird, and the Tree's en
ergy is still up to par this year, but it is
just this year's costume that is ques
tionable ... but it will work.
Disclaimer: This column is by no
means bashing the person inside the
Tree costume, or his creative expres
sion. This column is intended to shine
a light on a discussion that is already
being had all over campus as to the
appearance of this year's Stanford
Tree.
