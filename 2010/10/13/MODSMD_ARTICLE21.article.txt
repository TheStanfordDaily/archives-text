# PAC-10 POWER RANKINGS
## 
### 
Every week, Jacob Jaffe will give his power rankings of the Pac-10 football programs. These
represent a measure of current success, not a prediction of future standings or a measure of
talent. Overall and conference records are in parentheses.
1. Oregon (6-0, 3-0 Pac-10) UP NEXT: Bye
O Multiple injuries and a mediocre performance against the conference's worst team
aren't enough to knock the country's No. 2 team out of the top spot. The Ducks have
too much talent and an undefeated record, and no opponent has gotten within 10
points of them yet this year.
2. Oregon State (3-2, 2-0 Pac-10) UP NEXT: at Washington
Most Stanford fans would be screaming for the Cardinal to be in this spot, and it
was a very tough call. However, these are power rankings, and the Beavers had
by far the best win this weekend, knocking off Arizona in Tucson. Oregon State
has no conference losses and looks to be in the thick of the Pac-10 race again
this year, even without James Rodgers.
3. Stanford (5-1,2-1 Pac-10) UP NEXT: Bye
eA thrilling victory over the hated Trojans was great for the fans, but it brought up a
number of questions about the defense's inability to stop Robert Woods and the
USC offense. Stanford should have won much more easily, and that kind of per
formance will not be enough against teams with some semblance of a defense.
4. Arizona (4-1, l-l Pac-10) UP NEXT: at Washington State
C 73 The Wildcats suffered their first loss of the season, a home conference defeat to the
/jj\ Beavers. This will still be a tough team to beat, but Oregon State exposed some holes
CLj iâ€”l in Arizona. This is likely not a Rose Bowl-contending team, but the Wildcats will not
be a pushover for anyone.
5. California (3-2, l-l Pac-10) UP NEXT: at USC
* Outside of the top group in the Pac-10, Cal had the best win of the bunch. In what
f /yy was expected to be a close game, the Golden Bears rolled UCLA, 35-7, making
-SHES* 1 people again wonder what kind of team they are. On any given day, Cal can be bril
liant or mediocre, but the Bears have the talent to beat just about anyone in the conference.
6. Arizona State (3-3, 1-2 Pac-10) UP NEXT: Bye
After three consecutive tough losses to ranked teams, the Sun Devils finally closed the
deal by beating Washington on the road. Bowl eligibility will be tough to come by
because ASU still needs four more wins (two wins came against FCS teams), but the
\v Sun Devils have already shown the ability to contend with any team on their schedule.
7. USC (4-2,1-2 Pac-10) UP NEXT: vs. California
/fr&iat, s^ows ow far the Trojans have fallen that a two-point loss to Stanford is not a bad thing,
but that is certainly the case. USC showed more fight than most people expected, and
there is little doubt about the talent level in Los Angeles. If the Trojans can lay off the penal
ties and cover receivers, they will be a tough out, even with no bowl berth on the line.
8. UCLA (3-3, 1-2 Pac-10) UP NEXT: Bye
_ /'/} The Bruins sneak ahead of Washington because their loss was on the road. Yet again,
UCLA proves to be an enigma, completely disappearing in Berkeley after three straight
victories. UCLA seems to be able to beat or lose to any team in the country.
9. Washington (2-3, l-l Pac-10) UP NEXT: vs. Oregon State
yfr The Huskies show once again that they aren't a consistent threat. After pulling
another upset over USC, this time in the Coliseum, Washington fell flat on its face
against Arizona State at home. If the Huskies want to get back in a bowl game for
the first time since 2002, they need to learn how to win multiple games in a row.
10. Washington State (1-5, 0-3 Pac-10) UP NEXT: vs. Arizona
The Cougars are certainly improving . . . but it sure is easy to improve on one
Pac-10 win since 2007. Still, Wazzu looked better against one of the best teams
in the country last weekend, and the Cougars could steal a win if someone takes
them lightly.
