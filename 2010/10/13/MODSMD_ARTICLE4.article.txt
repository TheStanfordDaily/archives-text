That IHUM paper might have done some damage
to your skin in addition to your sleep cycle. Accord
ing to a recently published article in the journal of the
American Academy of Pediatrics, chronic exposure
to the heat source on the underside of a laptop com
puter can cause an unsightly rash dubbed "laptop
skin" or, officially, laptop-induced "erythema ab
igne," a web-like, pinkish-brownish lesion.
Latin for "redness from fire" and also known as
"toasted skin syndrome," erythema ab igne can result
from prolonged skin contact with any significant heat
source. Historically, the elderly have been primarily
affected with proximity to fires and other heating el
ements, such as electric blankets. Only in the last
decade have laptops been identified as an agent.
When laptops are the culprit, however, the condi
tion is not severe enough to present any serious
health risks, according to several dermatologists at
the Stanford Medical Center.
