## Study: laptops' heat can cause skin problems Case study documents laptop-in-duced skin discoloration, burns 
### DANA EDWARDS 
That IHUM paper might have done some damage
to your skin in addition to your sleep cycle. Accord
ing to a recently published article in the journal of the
American Academy of Pediatrics, chronic exposure
to the heat source on the underside of a laptop com
puter can cause an unsightly rash dubbed "laptop
skin" or, officially, laptop-induced "erythema ab
igne," a web-like, pinkish-brownish lesion.
Latin for "redness from fire" and also known as
"toasted skin syndrome," erythema ab igne can result
from prolonged skin contact with any significant heat
source. Historically, the elderly have been primarily
affected with proximity to fires and other heating el
ements, such as electric blankets. Only in the last
decade have laptops been identified as an agent.
When laptops are the culprit, however, the condi
tion is not severe enough to present any serious
health risks, according to several dermatologists at
the Stanford Medical Center.

"The concern is mainly aesthet
ic," said Jean Tang, assistant profes
sor of dermatology, "though some
slight discomfort can be involved.
This type of laptop burn is not even
a first-degree burn."
Indeed, this "burn" is actually a
reddening of the skin caused by the
dilating of capillaries.
"The infrared [radiation from the
heat] causes a reticular pattern of
hyper-pigmentation due to the
swelling of surrounding cells," said
David Peng, clinical associate pro
fessor of dermatology. He concurred
that the risks associated were main
ly aesthetic.
Though this is indeed the case for
"laptop skin," other types of er
tythema ab igne have potentially
graver long-term health conse
quences. Just as prolonged exposure
to ultraviolet radiation mutates skin

cells and causes melanoma, expo
sure to severe infrared radiation can
cause squamous skin-cell cancer,
which was common in ancient China
and Tibet, when people slept close to
heated-brick platforms called
"kangs." the study said.
As to the possibility of develop
ing squamous cell cancer from lap
top exposure, Peng calls it "extreme
ly unlikely." He added, "It's very
hard to examine the connection be
tween the exposure to the heat
source and the development of the
cancer, due to extremely long laten
cy time."
As for treatment, both Tang and
Peng agree that simply stopping ex
posure to the laptop will cause the
lesion to fade completely in a matter
of weeks, though Tang added that
scarring is theoretically possible and
is often more visible in those with
darker skin tones. No active treat
ments exist, though Tang suggested
taking aspirin to alleviate symp
toms.
The heat behind the damage all
originates from three potential

sources on the laptop: the optical
drive, the battery and the ventilation
fan, all of which are usually located
on the left side of the computer.
Consequently, all reported cases of
laptop skin have occurred on the left
thigh only, and this asymmetry is
characteristic of the diagnosis.
Professors at the medical school
and clinicians at Vaden Health Cen
ter say they have encountered "very
few" cases of laptop-induced erythe
ma ab igne in Stanford students and
in general patients, though this lack
of cases is not necessarily due to a
low prevalence of the condition.
Several students interviewed for
this article agreed that prevention of
this condition is a matter of common
sense simply stop putting the lap
top on your lap, they said.
"Generally when something is
burning your legs or crotch, you
should remove whatever is causing
that sensation," said Matt Anderson
