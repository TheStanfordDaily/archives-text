## Overseas programs report crime 
### IVY NGUYEN DESK EDITOR 
Recently released Clery reports for Bing Overseas
Studies Program (BOSP) centers detail crime at and
near Stanford centers in 2009. No crime was reported
for the Beijing, Berlin, Madrid, Oxford, Paris or Santia
go centers, while the crimes reported for the Florence,
Moscow and Kyoto centers occurred on public proper
ty near the sites.
The crimes detailed in the reports are categorized by
whether they occur on campus, within the dorm, in a
non-campus area owned or controlled by the Universi
ty or on public property. Public property is defined as
"streets, sidewalks, and parking facilities contiguous to,
but not within, the campus," and those statistics are pro
vided by local agencies. Some of the statistics do not in
dicate whether the victims of the crimes were Stanford
students or other people.
In 2009, 94 cases of aggravated assault occurred on
public property near the Florence center, down from
104 in 2008. A total of 17,077 cases of burglary occurred
there in 2009. It was not indicated whether any students
were involved in these cases.
Two incidents of forcible fondling occurred on pub

lie property near the Kyoto center. Again, it was again
not indicated if students were involved. Motor vehicle
and bike thefts on public property in the area nearly
doubled, to 49 vehicle and 323 bike thefts in 2009 from
26 motor vehicle and 255 bike thefts in 2008.
One case of aggravated assault and one of robbery
occurred on public property near the Moscow center in
2009, up from none the previous year.
No information was available for the Cape Town
center because the center debuted in spring 2010. No re
port was made for the Australia center because the pro
gram is run through a contract with the University of
Queensland and does not have a facility maintained by
Stanford.
Due to the differences in law enforcement record
keeping at these sites, these numbers are not represen
tative of actual crime patterns in the regions surround
ing any of the centers.
"The definition of 'in the campus area' is different
because these foreign police departments don't have to
do this for their own governments or purposes," said
Irene Kennedy, executive director of BOSP. "In the
United States it's pretty well spelled out, but you try ex-
