## University starts pilot child-care program for faculty families 
### KURT CHIRBAS 
In 2007, a survey by the Faculty Development & Diversi
ty Office showed that almost a third of Stanford faculty
missed five or more days of work annually to take care of an
ill child, causing a potential loss in productivity. To alleviate
this problem, the University recently launched a program
that aims to meet the child-care needs of Stanford faculty,
funded through a partnership between the provost and the
School of Medicine.
In addition to the productivity issue among general fac
ulty, the medical school was concerned with how the unpre
dictability of its faculty members' schedules affected their
child-care options and was looking for a solution, said Han
nah Valantine, senior associate dean for diversity and lead
ership in the medical school.
Now, the new program seeks to resolve both of these is
sues. Called the Faculty Back-up Care Plan, it will be offered
in a three-year pilot phase that began on Oct. 1. During this
phase, the service will be limited to Stanford faculty as well
as associate, assistant and full-time clinical professors at the
School of Medicine.
The provider of this service, Bright Horizons Family So
lutions, already manages similar childcare plans at Harvard,
Rice and Cornell. Its experience at other universities was a
major factor in the University's decision to select the com
pany, Valantine said.
"I think as we move forward, we're seeing a shift in this
generation of workforce where they are very concerned that
they should have work-life balance," Valantine said. "So the
institutions that recognize that need, and provide the infra
structure and resources to support [it]... are going to be the
ones that are going to be able to recruit and retain the very
best of faculty."
The University last revised its child-care services in 1999

when it implemented a
program that has parents
call a referral agency to
get a list of centers and in
house providers that
could take care of their
children that day. Today, it
currently extends to all
members of the Stanford
staff.
"With the referral, the
employee makes all the
arrangements with the
provider and pays the full
cost of care," said Teresa
Rasco, director of the
Stanford Work Life Of
fice, in an e-mail to The
Daily.
Employees are then el
igible to submit for a $l6O
reimbursement at the end
