## University starts pilot child-care program for faculty families 
### KURT CHIRBAS 
In 2007, a survey by the Faculty Development & Diversi
ty Office showed that almost a third of Stanford faculty
missed five or more days of work annually to take care of an
ill child, causing a potential loss in productivity. To alleviate
this problem, the University recently launched a program
that aims to meet the child-care needs of Stanford faculty,
funded through a partnership between the provost and the
School of Medicine.
In addition to the productivity issue among general fac
ulty, the medical school was concerned with how the unpre
dictability of its faculty members' schedules affected their
child-care options and was looking for a solution, said Han
nah Valantine, senior associate dean for diversity and lead
ership in the medical school.
Now, the new program seeks to resolve both of these is
sues. Called the Faculty Back-up Care Plan, it will be offered
in a three-year pilot phase that began on Oct. 1. During this
phase, the service will be limited to Stanford faculty as well
as associate, assistant and full-time clinical professors at the
School of Medicine.
The provider of this service, Bright Horizons Family So
lutions, already manages similar childcare plans at Harvard,
Rice and Cornell. Its experience at other universities was a
major factor in the University's decision to select the com
pany, Valantine said.
"I think as we move forward, we're seeing a shift in this
generation of workforce where they are very concerned that
they should have work-life balance," Valantine said. "So the
institutions that recognize that need, and provide the infra
structure and resources to support [it]... are going to be the
ones that are going to be able to recruit and retain the very
best of faculty."
The University last revised its child-care services in 1999

when it implemented a
program that has parents
call a referral agency to
get a list of centers and in
house providers that
could take care of their
children that day. Today, it
currently extends to all
members of the Stanford
staff.
"With the referral, the
employee makes all the
arrangements with the
provider and pays the full
cost of care," said Teresa
Rasco, director of the
Stanford Work Life Of
fice, in an e-mail to The
Daily.
Employees are then el
igible to submit for a $l6O
reimbursement at the end

With the new pilot plan, however,
it takes one phone call for a Stanford
faculty member to get help. The
agency takes care of the rest iden
tifying vetted child-care centers
within a preexisting network, mak
ing the arrangements and confirm
ing the placement with the employ
ee.
The University is extending the
service to faculty who need to travel
and is adding an elderly-care compo
nent.
"The elder care component
speaks to the rising number of peo
ple responsible for the care of elder
loved ones," Rasco said.
And it all comes at a lower cost to
the employee. The service charges a
co-pay of $6 an hour for an in-house
provider and $l5 a day for care at a
center.
Still, some groups on campus
feel left out.The program in its pilot
phase does not apply to many indi
viduals within the Stanford com
munity.
Rie Kijima, a fourth-year gradu
ate student in the School of Educa
tion who has a one-year-old daugh
ter, said as a student, the pressure to

find consistent daycare can be
daunting.
"Sometimes, you have meetings
that come up at the last minute, and I
think those services would really
help graduate students at those
times," Kijima said. "If there's
enough money available, and if
there's a program that could be ex
tended, I think people would wel
come it from the graduate student
community."
Kijima pointed to financial obsta
cles when looking for child care.
"The child-care situation here is
very expensive," Kijima said. "Usu
ally the ones on campus are any
where between $1,700 to $1,900 a
month, so it's pretty hefty in terms of
the cost it requires from our normal
stipend to pay off the childcare fee."
Valantine said the program will
be reevaluated at the end of its first
year to see if it should be extended to
other groups on campus.
"Because we are uncertain how
this program will work, whether it
will work, how it will be used, we
thought we would do a limited pilot
in the first year," Valantine said.
"We wanted to first conduct a pilot
to get a good sense of how it was
working and whether it was being
used, and then we'll be rolling it out
to others."
