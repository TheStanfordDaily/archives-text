## Senate approves fiscal reforms 
### MARGARET RAWSON STAFF WRITER 
The ASSU Undergraduate Senate
passed four bills Tuesday, enacting the first
part of an ASSU fiscal reform package, insti
tuting Senate office hours, encouraging the
establishment of Senate archives and stan
dardizing bill nomenclature. The Senate also
appointed 11 more students University
committees through an amendment to an
earlier appointment bill.
The first half of an ASSU fiscal reform
package, authored by Ryan Peacock, sought
to clarify definitions for budget items and
further outlined the capabilities of the Sen
ate treasurer and Graduate Student Council
financial officer and the process for a budg
et modification veto.
If the Graduate Student Council passes
the bill, altering the Association Joint By
laws, on Wednesday, Peacock will work with
Stewart Macgregor-Dennis 'l3, Senate
treasurer, and Raj Bhandari, the CEO of
Stanford Student Enterprises, to draft new
budgets for both bodies. Peacock is a gradu

ate student in chemical engineering and ex
ecutive chair of graduate issues
The Senate passed a bill instituting three
hours of Senate office hours per week, ex
cluding dead week and finals week. While
the office hours will not start this quarter,
senators expressed hope that, once a sched
ule is created by the Communications Com
mittee, the rotating office hours will begin
soon.
The Senate also passed a bill Tuesday en
couraging the establishment of the Under
graduate Senate archives. The bill says "at
tempts shall be made" by Senate Chair
Michael Cruz 'l2 and the Administration &
Rules Committee to establish digital
archives for the past 11 Undergraduate Sen
ates.
The last bill passed Tuesday established
standard bill nomenclature, which has been
changing each year at the discretion of the
chair. While the first three bills of the meet
ing passed unanimously, the bill to establish
bill nomenclature passed 14 to 1, with
Daniel Khalessi 'l3 opposing.
"I don't really see the point of this when

there's actual stuff that needs to be done on
campus," Khalessi said, expressing frustra
tion that the Senate has continued to focus
on internal affairs.
Cruz acknowledged this concern. "There
are some things that need to be fixed, but
this shouldn't be the focus of the rest of the
year," he said.
The various Senate committees dis
cussed their plans for the year at Tuesday's
meeting, including a push for a pilot study
abroad program in the Middle East, a bike
safety campaign that would distribute free
bike lights, and the potential creation of a
"diversity council" similar to the current
Frosh Council.
The ASSU executives presented their
nominations to the Constitutional Council
Tuesday. Nominees David Hoyt 'l2, J'vona
Ivory 'll and Samir Siddhanti 'l2 will be
voted on next week. Those nominees re
place three earlier ones after the executives
opted for a second application round. (One
former nominee, Brianna Pang 'l3, is a Daily
staffer.)
All funding bills for the evening
were passed.
Surveying Student Opinion on Sen
ate Bills
The Senate spent the last part of
Tuesday's meeting discussing a bill on
previous notice calling for a method
to obtain qualitative and quantitative

data on what students think about
bills going before the Senate. The bill's
current form suggested an e-mail sent
to a new e-mail list notifying students
of upcoming bills.
The information would be "purely
meant as an extra data point for your
consideration," said Macgregor-Den
nis, who authored the bill, when asked
by senators how the information
might affect the voting process.
Whether or not they agreed with
the bill's sentiment that more student
voices would be helpful, many sena
tors raised doubts about the imple
mentation of the bill and questioned

if an e-mail survey would elicit fair
representation of the student body.
ASSU Vice President Kelsei
Wharton 'l2 expressed the perspec
tive that "sometimes bills are written
and they affect people who have no
idea they're being affected. It does
help to have that information dissem
inated in away that people can be ac
tive."
"Maybe we need to do more think
ing about this," Macgregor-Dennis
concluded about the details of the bill.
