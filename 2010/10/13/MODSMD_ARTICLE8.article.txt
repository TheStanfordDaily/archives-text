## Hume outlines trustees' agenda, notes Hennessy's 10th year 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€” Elizabeth Titus 
The board of trustees expects re
ports this year on the state of the
School of Engineering, the earthquake
risks facing the University and the next
25 years of land use at Stanford, board
President Leslie Hume said in an
overview of the board's agenda on
Tuesday.
Hume spoke on campus after the
October meeting of the board, the first
for six new trustees named earlier this
year. University President John Hen
nessy spoke to the board and the group
walked through the new Science and
Engineering Quad on west campus.
In a press briefing, Hume gave
glowing reviews to Hennessy and
Provost John Etchemendy Ph.D. 'B2,
who marked a decade in their respec
tive roles last month.
"When you look back on these 10
years of when John and John have
been partnered in leading this univer
sity, I think in the Stanford annals this
will go down as one of the legendary
times of Stanford history, not unlike
the partnership of Fred Terman and
Wally Sterling," Hume said, referring
to the provost and president who
served together from 1955 to 1965.
She cited new facilities, fundraising
efforts, financial aid expansion and the
"excellence of our departments" as
achievements of the past decade. In
December, Hume herself will mark a
10-year milestone as a member of the
board. She is set to step down when her
second two-year term as president ex
pires in June 2012.
After a spate of construction proj
ect approvals in June, the board ap
proved no new projects this month,
Hume said.
Regarding financial aid, Hume said
the University's commitment to the
expanded program remains "iron
clad." Hennessy told the Faculty Sen
ate last week that Stanford hopes to
close the aid budget deficit in four to
five years; meanwhile, some general
funds are helping close the gap. That
demonstrates Stanford's dedication to
financial aid, Hume said: "Those are
dollars that could be allocated any
where."
"It's an issue that keeps being
raised as. Are we really serious about
this?"' Hume said. If parents wonder
whether or not Stanford's financial aid
program is too good to be true long

term, "that, 1 understand completely,"
Hume said.
In December, School of Engineer
ing Dean Jim Plummer M.S. '67 Ph.D.
'7l is set to report to the trustees about
the state of the school. Also that
month, the board plans to discuss geo
logic and financial risks earthquakes
pose to the University and its build
ings. On the April agenda is a discus
sion of Stanford's land use in the next
25 years, Hume said.
