## THE
						CAMPUS BEAT The
						Limits of Opportunity 
### Lucas Will Johnson 
Over the last couple weeks, dorms have
had the pleasure of enjoying the 7
a.m. wake-up thunder of roll-outs. It's
auditioning season for student groups! What
isn't heard is the disappointment of those
who tried out but weren't forced to get out of
bed and run around campus sycophantically
before breakfast. You got accepted to Stan
ford, but that doesn't guarantee you a spot in
that dance company or that instrument en
semble. They just don't have all the space and
resources to accommodate everyone.
Universities are primarily educational in
stitutions does it matter how we parcel
out the extracurricular resources? We do live
here for four-plus years, so non-academics
make up a significant part of our lives. And,
arguably, those activities are as much about
education as our classes. They give us hands
on practice rounds of activism, business, per
formance arts and so forth. Many of us will
attempt to earn a living with those skills, and
those who don't will still benefit from the
breadth of experiences. So why can't every
one do all the activities they want and reap
the full educational benefits?
Well, we have some elements of a meri
tocracy here and there, for good reasons. I'm
sure you would learn a lot playing football
under the coaching of Jim Harbaugh, but
that's just not in the cards for most of us. And
when it comes to music, performance groups
have just as good a reason for auditions. At
this age, people expect a level of musician
ship when going to shows we're no longer
in elementary school orchestras with audi
ences of proud parents listening to us squeak
away.
But what about when there's a clear de
mand for people to learn something, and a
clear desire to teach them? I'm in Cardinal
Calypso and we saw over 50 people audition.
All would have clearly loved to learn about
the steel pan, yet we could only take three.
Our mission includes teaching, so we show
new members how to play. The rest we teach
about the sound and versatility of the instru
ment via gigs and shows, which is great, but
not the same.
We simply don't have enough instruments
for a 60-person band. We don't have enough
time in our schedules to try to put together a
B band using the instruments we already
own. We don't have a full-time instructor
who could run several ensembles. And even
if we did, we don't have a practice space with
the flexibility for us to use more than the few
hours per week we already occupy. In theory,
the music department would have that kind
of jurisdiction and could provide some of
those opportunities, but part of the point of a
VSO is that it's student-run.
Calypso has a music ensemble's version of
the timeless problem of resources. Other
groups get to wrestle with the same issue in
different ways. But the solution is always
money.
I'm not going to get into an argument
about special fees. That is but one potential
source of financial help that can provide op
portunity to more students. Other options in
clude ASSU discretionary funding, all shapes

and sizes of grants, The Stanford Fund, in
come from performances and our own wal
lets. Each has its own process, its own limita
tions (of time or amount or purpose), and
you can get into arguments about the justice
or appropriateness of using any of them. Suf
fice it to say, there is a variety of places groups
can go to ask for resources.
So even though not everyone gets to ben
efit from all the opportunities they see at
Stanford, the farm doth have fertile ground if
you want to get some money to plant some
thing. And given that musicians are usually
pretty strapped for cash, at least while you're
in college you can apply for funding to record
an album or start a steel pan group.
Besides, is it even a huge deal that some
doors are closed to students? With all the
classes and activities to choose from, a few
unavailable options might make it a bit easi
er to pick among the thousand other things
on your to-do list.
Let's be clear, though: This issue of un
available opportunities due to short re
sources is not unique to Stanford student
groups. It's a part of life. My point is merely
that, as I advocate for a stronger music pres
ence on campus, I lament the times when sit
uational factors prevent more people from
joining in. Taking the long view, groups can
build themselves up over the years, enabling
them to share music with more people later.
Right now, they might not have room, but
things can change. And when you don't make
it the first time around, Stanford's got some
resources if you're enterprising enough. Who
knows, it might teach you something.
