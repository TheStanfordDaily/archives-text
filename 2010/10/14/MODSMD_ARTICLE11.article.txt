# LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
## The
						wind of freedom still blows 
### 
Dear Editor,
I am one of those who wrote in to criti
cize The Stanford Daily's editorial, which
labeled Dr. Victor Davis Hanson a racist,
and expressed my disappointment that such
a poorly argued editorial, whose author had
entirely misread Hanson's remarks and in
tentions, was published at all. Like others, I
believe The Stanford Daily owes Dr. Han
son a public apology.
However, the writers of several letters to
the editor responding to the Hanson edito
rial have engaged in similar ad hominem at
tacks and generalized negatively about the
intellect, abilities and political leanings of
Stanford students and their teachers, even
questioning the national standing of the
University itself.
Despite the well-deserved criticism of
that single editorial, I do not waver in my
belief that it was an absolute privilege to be
a Stanford student and it still is. Stanford is
an incredible place to get an education, a
place of rigorous debate, talented students
and outstanding faculty, and may well be
the best University in the world.
As an alumna, I am about to spend
$3,000 for my husband and me to attend the
four-day Homecoming Reunion of the
Stanford Class of '65 this month (registra
tion fees, airfare, hotel, rental car, etc.). We
are willing to pay that just for the privilege
of sitting in on a few Classes Without
Quizzes led by distinguished Stanford pro
fessors and researchers, panel discussions
on current issues, tours of the gorgeous
campus and the singular opportunity to
enjoy a Dinner on the Quad. And we plan
to do it again five years from now for my
50th reunion.
On scholarship, loans, grants and a

work-study program even to be able to af
ford to go to Stanford, I was an English
major who took classes across the curricu
lum with professors I could only dream of
meeting. Admittedly, I wrote some papers
that I'd like to reach back through time and
retract (not unlike some Daily editorial
writers), but I learned the proverbial les
sons of a lifetime at Stanford. I met people
of all races, religions and creeds and spent
long nights at Roble, FloMo and Hurlburt
and in Beutelsbach listening and openly
discussing every philosophical, religious
and political viewpoint imaginable. Like
students everywhere, sometimes I was an
ass and sometimes I actually made a few
worthwhile contributions.
But I was never pressured to conform
my thinking to any particular direction at
Stanford, whether liberal or conservative,
other than being guided to be clear, to use
logic and to be able to back up my asser
tions with facts, authority and solid exam
ples. Perhaps some of the writers of those
letters to the editor criticizing Stanford as
promoting leftist, liberal propaganda
would be amazed to know I actually gradu
ated as a conservative independent in my
political leanings.
Yes, at every university, as Dr. Hanson
writes, some policies should be re-exam
ined and changed. Stanford has warts, but it
continues to be a truly great university.
And I have no doubt that open discussion
and rigorous examination of diverse ideas
will always be part of what makes Stanford
a place where the wind of freedom still
blows.
