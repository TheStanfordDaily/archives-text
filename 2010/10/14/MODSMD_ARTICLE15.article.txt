## Stanford hosts annual FACE AIDS conference More than 100 students to attend weekend event 
### MARIANNE LEVINE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
This weekend, 100 students from
FACE AIDS chapters around the
United States and Canada will attend
the annual FACE AIDS conference
at Stanford. This year's conference is
entitled "Beyond the Pin." The con
ference is primarily funded by FACE
AIDS, an international nonprofit
founded by Stanford students dedi
cated to fighting HIV/AIDS. The
conference was planned and organ
ized by the FACE AIDS Director
Corps, a group of eight Stanford stu
dents passionate about global health.
According to Romy Saloner 'O7, a
FACE AIDS executive and manag
ing director, the conference gives stu
dents the unique opportunity "to
learn from global health experts and
each other about critical issues in the
field and how to be effective advo
cates and leaders in the fight against
HIV/AIDS."
The FACE AIDS conference will
host a variety of speakers, from doc
tors to lawyers to activists. The
keynote speakers are Joia Mukher
jee, medical director of Partners In
Health, Joe Amon, director of the
Health and Human Rights Division
at Human Rights Watch, and Don

Francis, executive director of Global
Solutions for Infectious Disease and
co-discoverer of HIV/AIDS.
Mukherjee is scheduled to speak at
Bishop Auditorium at 6:30 p.m. on
Saturday; Amon is scheduled for Sat
urday and Francis on Sunday, both at
the Clark Center.
In addition to hosting a wide
range of speakers, the FACE AIDS
conference will include other activi
ties. According to Sidhtara Tep 'll,
the national events director for
FACE AIDS, these activities include
a "speed-dating" session where stu
dents can meet with professionals
and activists in the field and a career
panel in global health.
The University of Oregon, Vassar
College and University of Texas-
Austin are among many schools with
large FACE AIDS chapters. In order
to attend the conference, students
simply had to register online.
For the Stanford organizers, the
conference involved a significant
amount of planning. "We had to find
speakers, create programming, design
t-shirts and finalize logistics for food
and airport pick-up," Tep said. "There
is so much more that went into the con
ference and we literally have a million
Google documents floating around."
The FACE AIDS conference will
begin Friday at 5 p.m. and end Sun
day at 2 p.m.
