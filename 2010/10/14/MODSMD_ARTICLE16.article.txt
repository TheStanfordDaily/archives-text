## BRUIN BONANZA Cardinal looks to build off double-overtime victory 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After dropping its first two Pac-10 con
tests to California and Washington, the
men's soccer team avoided an even bigger
hole thanks to senior forward Dominique
Yahyavi's golden goal to beat Oregon State
in double overtime.
This weekend, the Cardinal returns home
to face a stiff test from two tough opponents:
No. 13 UCLA and previously-ranked San
Diego State.
The Bruins (8-2-1, 3-0 Pac-10) are tied
with Cal for the Pac-10 lead and are looking
to extend their dominance over the Cardi
nal, already holding a 36-5-7 advantage in
the all-time series. UCLA head coach Jorge
Salcedo's club is rounding into top form as
well opponents have scored just one goal
in Pac-10 play. The Bruins have won four
straight matches and have only one loss in
their past nine games.
After losing several key players from last
year's 12-4-4 squad that lost to Wake Forest
in the NCAA quarterfinals, UCLA is riding
the wave of a very highly ranked freshman
class this year. Five Bruins were drafted in
the 2010 MLS Super Draft in January, but the
current freshman class includes five more
players from Top Drawer Soccer's Top 25.
Underclassmen have scored all but one of
UCLA's 18 goals this season, and only five
upperclassmen have received a start this
year.
Freshman midfielder Kelyn Rowe is on a
tear of late, with a goal or an assist in his past
four games and totaling four goals and five
assists on the season. Incidentally, UCLA is
7-0 when Rowe has at least one point, and 1-
2-1 when he is scoreless.

But for all the statistics, rankings and talk
of how well various opponents are playing,
Stanford's focus remains intensely inwards.
Sophomore defender Hunter Gorskie
emphasized not allowing opponents to dic
tate the team's style of play.
"We have to focus on playing our game
and let them adapt to us. We have to keep the
ball, be confident on the ball and maintain
possession," he said. "To win, we also need to
be clinical in the final third [of the field] and
make sure the last pass is also the right pass."
In the 2-0 loss to Washington on Friday
night, the offense never really found its
groove, according to redshirt senior mid
fielder Thiago Sa Freire.
"It was just one of those nights when
things weren't going our way," Sa Freire said.
"You have to give them credit, because they
played a really good game, but we just didn't
really get into our game and our offense
never got going."
Sunday saw a more energetic and aggres
sive Cardinal team against Oregon State, as
it dominated possession throughout the
match.
Gorskie said that the team found itself in

a difficult position and reacted accordingly.
"We were all pretty disappointed starting
off Pac-10 play 0-2, especially when we know
we need to do well in order to get into the
[NCAA] Tournament," he said. "Sunday, we
saw that we had nothing to lose and needed
to do everything together.

"Right from the beginning we played ag
gressively and were energetic and had lots of
possession," he added. "It was a good game
for us."
The Cardinal will need more of that ener-

GAME NOTES: Stanford is coming off a thrilling double

gy if it hopes to slow down UCLA,
particularly since it will again be
without the services of redshirt
freshman Jason Dodson in goal.
Dodson suffered a dislocated
shoulder against Cal and will likely
miss the remainder of the regular
season.
In his absence, fellow redshirt
freshman Galen Perkins has
stepped up and by all accounts
delivered.
"If there was one very positive
thing from this weekend, it was
Galen," Sa Freire said. "He played
very well and has really stepped up
in his role this weekend."
Perkins made his first two ca
reer starts and finished with nine
saves and two goals allowed in 197
minutes, an impressive debut in a
difficult situation on the road.
He will have his hands full Fri
day night against UCLA, and it
won't get much easier against San
Diego State on Sunday.
The Aztecs (7-3-2, 1-2) have
been flirting with the rankings
throughout the year, falling from
their No. 25 perch this week after a
tough 1-0 loss at UCLA. They did,
however, manage to hold off Wash
ington, 4-3, in overtime with only
10 men and will be looking to re
bound off the loss to the Bruins.
With a little under half the Pac
-10 season complete, the pressure is
mounting for the Cardinal to make
a move and play its way into the
postseason.
"We are really excited to play at
home, and we love playing at home
because we usually play well here
and play our game," Gorskie said.
"But there's no mistaking that we
need to do very well in the second
half of the Pac-10 season to move
on. I think we are all ambitious to
take on the challenge."
Kickoff against UCLA will be at
7:30 p.m. Friday, with the game

class this year. Five Bruins were drafted in
the 2010 MLS Super Draft in January, but the
current freshman class includes five more
players from Top Drawer Soccer's Top 25.
Underclassmen have scored all but one of
UCLA's 18 goals this season, and only five
upperclassmen have received a start this
year.
Freshman midfielder Kelyn Rowe is on a
tear of late, with a goal or an assist in his past
four games and totaling four goals and five
assists on the season. Incidentally, UCLA is
7-0 when Rowe has at least one point, and 1-
2-1 when he is scoreless.

But for all the statistics, rankings and talk
of how well various opponents are playing,
Stanford's focus remains intensely inwards.
Sophomore defender Hunter Gorskie
emphasized not allowing opponents to dic
tate the team's style of play.
"We have to focus on playing our game
and let them adapt to us. We have to keep the
ball, be confident on the ball and maintain
possession," he said. "To win, we also need to
be clinical in the final third [of the field] and
make sure the last pass is also the right pass."
In the 2-0 loss to Washington on Friday
night, the offense never really found its
groove, according to redshirt senior mid
fielder Thiago Sa Freire.
"It was just one of those nights when
things weren't going our way," Sa Freire said.
"You have to give them credit, because they
played a really good game, but we just didn't
really get into our game and our offense
never got going."
Sunday saw a more energetic and aggres
sive Cardinal team against Oregon State, as
it dominated possession throughout the
match.
Gorskie said that the team found itself in

a difficult position and reacted accordingly.
"We were all pretty disappointed starting
off Pac-10 play 0-2, especially when we know
we need to do well in order to get into the
[NCAA] Tournament," he said. "Sunday, we
saw that we had nothing to lose and needed
to do everything together.

"Right from the beginning we played ag
gressively and were energetic and had lots of
possession," he added. "It was a good game
for us."
The Cardinal will need more of that ener-

GAME NOTES: Stanford is coming off a thrilling double

Dodson for the rest of the season.

After defeating conference rival Oregon State in a double-overtime thriller, the Stanford men's
soccer team hopes to extend its winning streak as it takes on powerhouse UCLA. The Cardinal is
most likely without injured starting goalkeeper Jason Dodson for the rest of the regular season.
gy if it hopes to slow down UCLA,
particularly since it will again be
without the services of redshirt
freshman Jason Dodson in goal.
Dodson suffered a dislocated
shoulder against Cal and will likely
miss the remainder of the regular
season.
In his absence, fellow redshirt
freshman Galen Perkins has
stepped up and by all accounts
delivered.
"If there was one very positive
thing from this weekend, it was
Galen," Sa Freire said. "He played
very well and has really stepped up
in his role this weekend."
Perkins made his first two ca
reer starts and finished with nine
saves and two goals allowed in 197
minutes, an impressive debut in a
difficult situation on the road.
He will have his hands full Fri
day night against UCLA, and it
won't get much easier against San
Diego State on Sunday.
The Aztecs (7-3-2, 1-2) have
been flirting with the rankings
throughout the year, falling from
their No. 25 perch this week after a
tough 1-0 loss at UCLA. They did,
however, manage to hold off Wash
ington, 4-3, in overtime with only
10 men and will be looking to re
bound off the loss to the Bruins.
With a little under half the Pac
-10 season complete, the pressure is
mounting for the Cardinal to make
a move and play its way into the
postseason.
"We are really excited to play at
home, and we love playing at home
because we usually play well here
and play our game," Gorskie said.
"But there's no mistaking that we
need to do very well in the second
half of the Pac-10 season to move
on. I think we are all ambitious to
take on the challenge."
Kickoff against UCLA will be at
7:30 p.m. Friday, with the game
against the Aztecs slated for Sun
day at 2:30 p.m. Both games will be
at Laird Q. Cagan Stadium.
