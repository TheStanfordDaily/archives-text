# The 						highs and lows of Card football
## 
### Jacob Jaffe Fields of Failure 
It's Stanford football's bye week,
so this is a perfect time to focus
on other sports. There are so
many other things going on in the
world of sports the MLB
playoffs, the beginning of the NHL, the
thick of the NFL season, the NBA pre
season and the realization that college
football players break the rules, just to
name a few.
But let's be honest, this is college
football season. So with apologies to
the Rangers' first series victory, a new
class in the NASCAR Hall of Fame and
Brett Favre's latest way of staying in the
headlines, here is a review of the first
half of Stanford's football season.
Let's start with the good:
Record: The most important stats
for any team are wins and losses, and
the Cardinal sits at 5-1 through six
games. A 5-1 record has to be consid
ered a success for almost any team, and
let's not forget that Stanford just broke
a string of seven straight seasons with
out racking up more than five wins.
Looking at the schedule before the
year, just about any Cardinal fan would
be happy with five wins at this point in
the season.
Replacing Toby Gerhart: Pundits all
around the country doubted Stanford's
ability to replace its star from 2009,
Toby Gerhart. While there is no doubt
among the Cardinal faithful that Ger
hart was a big part of the team's success
last season, the team has clearly moved
on. The backfield-by-committee ap
proach has turned into the Stepfan Tay
lor Show in the past few weeks. This is
partly due to injuries, but it is mostly

due to Taylor's success. He has rushed
for over 100 yards each of the past
three games, and Stanford as a team
ranks in the top 25 in the nation in rush
ing at over 200 yards per game, Toby
who?
Andrew Luck: In case you haven't
heard, Stanford has a quarterback
named Andrew Luck, and he's pretty
good. As in top-10-in-the-nation-in
passing-efficiency and tied-for-fourth
in-passing-touchdowns good. Oh, and
don't forget that he's second on the
team in rushing at over 40 yards per
game, including a ridiculous 52-yard
touchdown against Wake Forest. The
craziest part about Luck's season
might be the fact that exactly zero peo
ple are surprised by his success. Many
experts project him to be the top over
all pick in next year's NFL Draft, and
he's only a sophomore. And while no
one with an ounce of sense could com
plain about Luck's first half, it's fair to
say that he hasn't come close to his best
football, and that's certainly good for
Stanford football.
Defense ... at first: The biggest
question mark for Stanford coming
into the season was the ability of the
defense to keep the Cardinal in big
games. During Stanford's first four
games, every defensive question was
answered and more. The Cardinal
threw its first road shutout in 36 years
against conference foe UCLA, which
later rolled Texas in Austin. The sec
ondary, which had been the source of
countless near-heart attacks, looked
dominant during the first three weeks,
ranking first in the nation in pass de
fense. Stanford allowed only 11 points
per game in the first four weeks, and

the normally potent rushing attacks of
UCLA and Wake Forest were stymied.
Everything looked rosy.
Which brings us to the bad:
Defense against good teams: The
biggest negative for Stanford this sea
son, and the biggest change between
the first four weeks and the last two, has
been the defense. After pounding four
mediocre-at-best teams not one has
a winning record the Cardinal ran
into the buzz saw that is the Oregon
spread option. The loss was not the
issue Oregon might very well win
every game it plays this year by double
digits but the inability of the Stan
ford defense to get a stop did not bode
well. Giving up 626 yards, including a
staggering 388 on the ground, said even
worse things about the Cardinal de
fense.
While these numbers are grue
some for a defense, Oregon's video
game-style offense stopped many fans
from worrying. That should change
after the abysmal effort of Stanford's
defense last Saturday against USC.
The matchup was supposed to be an
other chance for the Cardinal to assert
itself over the rival Trojans. Stanford
was favored by 10, and USC was reel
ing from a last-second loss to Wash
ington. Then the Cardinal secondary
decided not to cover Trojan wideout
Robert Woods, and the USC offense
made it pay. As in 12 catches for 224
yards and three touchdowns, making
him the only player in the country to
put up those numbers in a game this
year. Woods' numbers in five games
coming in? 13 catches for 175 yards
and one touchdown.
Stanford cannot take the next step
to becoming a powerhouse unless it
figures out away to hold teams like
USC below 35 points. The run defense
was better against the Trojans, but a
top-10 team would not give up 390
yards to Matt Barkley, even if he's hav

ing a better year.
Turnovers: One of the best attrib
utes of Luck during his first season on
the Farm was his ball security (he only
had four interceptions all year). Ger
hart didn't cough up the ball too easily,
so Stanford was one of the best teams
last year at avoiding turnovers. This
trend was expected to continue into
2010, but the last few games have hard
ly reinforced this notion.
In the past three weeks, Stanford
has committed nine total turnovers,
three in each game. This total is unac
ceptable for a top-tier program, and it
will cost the Cardinal dearly. Taylor's
fumble late in the fourth quarter
against USC might have been the dif
ference if not for the final drive and
field goal by Nate Whitaker.
Are turnovers really that impor
tant, you might ask? Well, something
that separates top teams like Ohio
State, Oklahoma, Alabama, Boise
State and TCU is their ball security.
None of these four teams has commit
ted more than seven turnovers all year,
and that's no coincidence. Among top
teams, only Oregon has racked up
more turnovers than Stanford, but the
Ducks can get away with it because
they lead the nation with 22 takeaways.
The Cardinal, on the other hand, has a
negative turnover margin over the past
few weeks, and this will be a big prob
lem if it continues during the meat of
Pac-10 play.
Despite its 5-1 record, Stanford has
plenty to work on during this bye week,
from covering receivers to making
extra points. So far, though, the Cardi
nal has lived up to high expectations
for the season, and there's a lot to look
forward to in Palo Alto.

The Oregon Ducks would have lost if
they played football like Jacob Jaffe
plays video games. Challenge him to

Let's start with the good:

three games, and Stanford as a team
ranks in the top 25 in the nation in rush
ing at over 200 yards per game, Toby
who?
Andrew Luck: In case you haven't
heard, Stanford has a quarterback
named Andrew Luck, and he's pretty
good. As in top-10-in-the-nation-in
passing-efficiency and tied-for-fourth
in-passing-touchdowns good. Oh, and

countless near-heart attacks, looked
dominant during the first three weeks,
ranking first in the nation in pass de
fense. Stanford allowed only 11 points
per game in the first four weeks, and

the normally potent rushing attacks of
UCLA and Wake Forest were stymied.
Everything looked rosy.
Which brings us to the bad:
Defense against good teams: The
biggest negative for Stanford this sea
son, and the biggest change between
the first four weeks and the last two, has
been the defense. After pounding four
mediocre-at-best teams not one has
a winning record the Cardinal ran
into the buzz saw that is the Oregon
spread option. The loss was not the
issue Oregon might very well win
every game it plays this year by double
digits but the inability of the Stan
ford defense to get a stop did not bode
well. Giving up 626 yards, including a
staggering 388 on the ground, said even
worse things about the Cardinal de
fense.
While these numbers are grue
some for a defense, Oregon's video
game-style offense stopped many fans
from worrying. That should change
after the abysmal effort of Stanford's
defense last Saturday against USC.
The matchup was supposed to be an
other chance for the Cardinal to assert
itself over the rival Trojans. Stanford
was favored by 10, and USC was reel
ing from a last-second loss to Wash
ington. Then the Cardinal secondary
decided not to cover Trojan wideout
Robert Woods, and the USC offense
made it pay. As in 12 catches for 224
yards and three touchdowns, making
him the only player in the country to
put up those numbers in a game this
year. Woods' numbers in five games
coming in? 13 catches for 175 yards
and one touchdown.
Stanford cannot take the next step
to becoming a powerhouse unless it
figures out away to hold teams like
USC below 35 points. The run defense
was better against the Trojans, but a
top-10 team would not give up 390
yards to Matt Barkley, even if he's hav

ing a better year.
Turnovers: One of the best attrib
utes of Luck during his first season on
the Farm was his ball security (he only
had four interceptions all year). Ger
hart didn't cough up the ball too easily,
so Stanford was one of the best teams
last year at avoiding turnovers. This
trend was expected to continue into
2010, but the last few games have hard
ly reinforced this notion.
In the past three weeks, Stanford
has committed nine total turnovers,
three in each game. This total is unac
ceptable for a top-tier program, and it
will cost the Cardinal dearly. Taylor's
fumble late in the fourth quarter
against USC might have been the dif
ference if not for the final drive and
field goal by Nate Whitaker.
Are turnovers really that impor
tant, you might ask? Well, something
that separates top teams like Ohio
State, Oklahoma, Alabama, Boise
State and TCU is their ball security.
None of these four teams has commit
ted more than seven turnovers all year,
and that's no coincidence. Among top
teams, only Oregon has racked up
more turnovers than Stanford, but the
Ducks can get away with it because
they lead the nation with 22 takeaways.
The Cardinal, on the other hand, has a
negative turnover margin over the past
few weeks, and this will be a big prob
lem if it continues during the meat of
Pac-10 play.
Despite its 5-1 record, Stanford has
plenty to work on during this bye week,
from covering receivers to making
extra points. So far, though, the Cardi
nal has lived up to high expectations
for the season, and there's a lot to look
forward to in Palo Alto.

The Oregon Ducks would have lost if
they played football like Jacob Jaffe

It's Stanford football's bye week,
so this is a perfect time to focus
on other sports. There are so
many other things going on in the
world of sports the MLB
playoffs, the beginning of the NHL, the
thick of the NFL season, the NBA pre
season and the realization that college
football players break the rules, just to
name a few.
But let's be honest, this is college
football season. So with apologies to
the Rangers' first series victory, a new
class in the NASCAR Hall of Fame and
Brett Favre's latest way of staying in the
headlines, here is a review of the first
half of Stanford's football season.
Let's start with the good:
Record: The most important stats
for any team are wins and losses, and
the Cardinal sits at 5-1 through six
games. A 5-1 record has to be consid
ered a success for almost any team, and
let's not forget that Stanford just broke
a string of seven straight seasons with
out racking up more than five wins.
Looking at the schedule before the
year, just about any Cardinal fan would
be happy with five wins at this point in
the season.
Replacing Toby Gerhart: Pundits all
around the country doubted Stanford's
ability to replace its star from 2009,
Toby Gerhart. While there is no doubt
among the Cardinal faithful that Ger
hart was a big part of the team's success
last season, the team has clearly moved
on. The backfield-by-committee ap
proach has turned into the Stepfan Tay
lor Show in the past few weeks. This is
partly due to injuries, but it is mostly

due to Taylor's success. He has rushed
for over 100 yards each of the past
three games, and Stanford as a team
ranks in the top 25 in the nation in rush
ing at over 200 yards per game, Toby
who?
Andrew Luck: In case you haven't
heard, Stanford has a quarterback
named Andrew Luck, and he's pretty
good. As in top-10-in-the-nation-in
passing-efficiency and tied-for-fourth
in-passing-touchdowns good. Oh, and
don't forget that he's second on the
team in rushing at over 40 yards per
game, including a ridiculous 52-yard
touchdown against Wake Forest. The
craziest part about Luck's season
might be the fact that exactly zero peo
ple are surprised by his success. Many
experts project him to be the top over
all pick in next year's NFL Draft, and
he's only a sophomore. And while no
one with an ounce of sense could com
plain about Luck's first half, it's fair to
say that he hasn't come close to his best
football, and that's certainly good for
Stanford football.
Defense ... at first: The biggest
question mark for Stanford coming
into the season was the ability of the
defense to keep the Cardinal in big
games. During Stanford's first four
games, every defensive question was
answered and more. The Cardinal
threw its first road shutout in 36 years
against conference foe UCLA, which
later rolled Texas in Austin. The sec
ondary, which had been the source of
countless near-heart attacks, looked
dominant during the first three weeks,
ranking first in the nation in pass de
fense. Stanford allowed only 11 points
per game in the first four weeks, and

the normally potent rushing attacks of
UCLA and Wake Forest were stymied.
