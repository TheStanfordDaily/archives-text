## MPSF champions to kick off new season 
### JACK BLANCHAT 
The Stanford women's lacrosse
team begins its fall season this Satur
day, welcoming Fresno State, St.
Mary's and UC-Davis to town

three teams that Stanford will meet
again in MPSF conference play in the
spring.
The championship season for
women's lacrosse won't begin until
February, but the Cardinal's fall
schedule will prove to be a champi
onship-level test. After this week
end's round-robin event at home, the
Card will travel to Philadelphia,
where it will take on three perennial
lacrosse powerhouses in Penn, Vir
ginia and Maryland, all of whom fin

ished in the top 10 of last year's final
rankings.
But before the Cardinal can set its
sights on its third NCAA appearance
in the spring, it faces a test against
three Mountain Pacific Sports Fed
eration (MPSF) foes this Saturday.
The UC-Davis Aggies are the
headliner for the visitors, as the Ag
gies went 11-6 overall last season
with a 3-3 record in conference, good
enough for fourth in the MPSF. The
Aggies pushed the Cardinal the full
60 minutes in their only meeting last
season before eventually fading
back, falling 17-14.
St. Mary's finished the 2010 spring
season with a 4-12 record and will be
looking to rebound after a difficult
performance in its last trip to the
Farm. The Gaels had a tough time
against the Cardinal, which was in
the middle of a stretch that would
end up being a seven-game winning
streak. When all was said and done,
the Card completed an impressive
21-5 victory, its largest margin of vic
tory of the season.
Fresno State enters after a winless
season and without its head coach of
the past two years, as former leader
Sue Behme moved on to Rochester
earlier this month. Fresno State's
program will be looking for its first
win ever, as the brand-new program
began just two years ago.
In their matchups last year, the
Cardinal dominated Fresno State,
taking the Bulldogs down 19-4 in a
game at Laird Q. Cagan Stadium,
and later polished them off 16-1 in
the first round of the MPSF Tourna
ment in Denver.
The Cardinal will look to extend
its winning ways from last season, as
Stanford head coach Amy Bokker
led the Cardinal to one of its best sea-

FRESNO STATE
10/16 Stanford

GAME NOTES: Stanford won it's last match
against Fresno State 16-1 in the first round
of the MPSF Tournament. The Bulldogs have
yet to record a victory in the program's brief
two-year existence. The Cardinal will look to
improve upon last season's finish, a first
round exit in the NCAA Tournament.


SIMON WARBY/The Stanford Daily
Fresh off one of the most successful seasons in school history, the Stanford
lacrosse team begins a new campaign on Saturday as it takes on Fresno
State. The Cardinal smashed the Bulldogs 16-1 in their last meeting.

sons ever. The girls from the Farm
reached as high as No. 8 in the na
tional rankings and won the MPSF
Tournament title, defeating Denver
11-10 in double overtime. The victo
ry avenged a 17-12 home loss to
Denver earlier in the season, and
marked the sixth consecutive MPSF
title for the Cardinal.

This year, the Cardinal returns
seven seniors from last year's 15-6
squad, including last year's two lead
ing point-scorers, Sarah Flynn and
Lauren Schmidt, who captured her
second consecutive MPSF player of
the year award last year. Senior goal
keeper Annie Read also returns to the
Farm Read was nothing short of
outstanding for the Cardinal last sea

son. Her 0.496 save percentage was
good enough for 13th in the nation.
A few other notable names to
watch this weekend will be from the
young guns on the team, as the Cardi
nal looks to have many young players
in important roles this year, with four
of its top nine point-scorers from last
year lost to graduation. Perhaps the
most notable departure is Claire
Hubbard, who notched 41 assists
from her attack position last year, the
sixth-best total in the country.
Fans can also be on the lookout
for the new freshman class this sea
son, which boasts two Under Ar
mour Ail-Americans, including at
tacker Annie Anton, who was
named the best player in Colorado
by the Denver Post, and goalkeeper
Lyndsey Munoz, who was a selection
to the ESPN All-Rise team.
