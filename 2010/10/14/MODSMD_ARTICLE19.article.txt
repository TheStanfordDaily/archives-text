# Card women face East Coast test
## 
### NICK SU 
After a dominant 6-0 romp over
Harvard last Friday at the Varsity
Turf, the Stanford women's field
hockey team will be taking its game
on the road, playing a trio of match
es on the East Coast this weekend.
The No. 20 Cardinal (8-3, 3-1 Nor-
Pac) begins play this Friday, as the
team takes on No. 8 Syracuse (8-4).
This match will be followed by two
more away games against Rutgers
(5-9) on Sunday and Northeastern
(6-7) on Monday.
Recovering from a nail-biting 2-
1 loss to No. 1 North Carolina (14-
0) in late September, the Cardinal
has gone on to win its last three
games. But despite the strong offen
sive performance against Harvard
last week, Stanford fell three spots
in the coaches' poll as Drexel, Al
bany and Old Dominion jumped
over it in the national rankings.
Now, after 16 consecutive weeks of

being in the coaches' poll, a loss on
the road this weekend may drop
the Card out of the national rank
ings for the first time since Septem
ber of 2009.
Stanford has done a great job on
the road, with a 6-1 record away
from home. Its only loss came at
the hands of undefeated North
Carolina, which is also the defend
ing NCAA champion. In fact, the
Card has done significantly better
on the road than it has at home, with
a record of only 2-2 playing on the
Varsity Turf.
All three of the Cardinal's losses
have come by one-point margins,
with its two losses at home to No. 7
Michigan State and California both
decided by goals scored in the last
five minutes of the match. Syracuse,
on the other hand, has defeated sev
eral ranked teams in highly contest
ed matches, coming off an overtime
victory against No. 18 Albany last
Sunday. At the same time, the Or

ange has not been defeated on its
home turf, posting a 3-0 record.
The Stanford squad has done a
solid job throughout the season,
scoring an average of 3.18 goals per
game while holding a shooting per
centage of .201. Defensively, the
Card has kept its opponents to only
1.27 goals per game. The team pos
sesses great depth as well, with 15 of
18 players on the squad having
scored at least one goal. Senior de

named NorPac Player of the Week
last week after scoring two goals in
the match against Harvard. Donner
became the fifth Cardinal team
member to receive the player of the
week honor this season.
Though the Syracuse team has put
up lower numbers than the Card, the
Orange is not to be underestimated.
Playing a tough schedule filled with
East Coast schools, Syracuse has not
lost any of its four matches played
against opponents in the top 20
ranked lower than itself.
"It's going to be a challenging
weekend," said head coach Tara
Danielson, who acknowledged the
difficulty of playing three games in
four days while traveling across the

country.
Coach Danielson stressed that
quick ball movement would be a key
to victory against the very physical
play of the New England teams, but
seemed quite confident about the
Cardinal's upcoming matches.
"The expectation for this week
end is to execute well and to start
showing some signs of postseason
play," she added.
After this weekend, the Card will
play its last two games of the regular

season conference matches
against Pacific and Cal. With a 3-1
conference record, Stanford is cur
rently second in the West Division of
the NorPac, behind Cal. However,
two wins in its remaining NorPac
matches would give Stanford a bet
ter seed and more momentum going
into its postseason, which begins
with the NorPac Championships in
early November.
