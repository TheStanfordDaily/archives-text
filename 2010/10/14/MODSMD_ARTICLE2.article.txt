## Consulting firms reach out to seniors Top companies attract high numbers of qualified applicants

While many students on campus sport T-shirts and flip
flops, a select group of seniors are donning suits and slacks
as they stroll through White Plaza.
These students are participating in the intensive recruit
ment process for consulting companies. The companies,
with specialties ranging from finances to biotechnology, are
eagerly courting seniors who have begun exploring their
postgraduate options.
Bain & Company, a top global management consulting
firm that currently employs more than 150 Stanford alum
ni, is recruiting students for its associate consultant, or AC,
position. Suzanne Tollerud 'O7 M. A. 'OB, now a senior asso
ciate consultant, says the role of an AC is to work with clients
"in the process of solving complex business problems."
"These interactions range from simple data requests to
in-depth discussions with clients to brainstorm and debate
ideas," Tollerud wrote in an e-mail to The Daily. "As insights
and potential solutions begin to emerge, team members will
often return to the employees they have worked with to
share these ideas and iterate on strategy development."
ACs at Bain and other consulting firms work on small
teams, managing a caseload that changes daily. Sherry Ho
'll, an international relations maj or, spent the past summer
as a Bain AC intern at the firm's San Francisco office. She
said she enjoyed being exposed to a variety of business sec
tors.
"One thing I really like is that no two days are the same,"
said Ho, who will work for the firm full-time upon gradua
tion. "It varies a lot, and Bain is a very dynamic place to
work."
The excitement of the consulting field also drew in
Patrick MacKenzie 'll, a management science and engi
neering major who interned for Accenture this summer.
"It's a fast-moving environment where you're constant
ly switching from case to case," MacKenzie said. "You're
learning about new industries and constantly being chal
lenged."
MacKenzie, who plans to attend business school eventu
ally, said he views consulting as a learning experience rather
than as a long-term career prospect.The first step in that ex
perience, for most hopefuls, is the notoriously intense re
cruitment process. Many companies begin courting Stan
ford students before their senior year and continue with in
formational sessions and informal meet-and-greets in the
early fall.
