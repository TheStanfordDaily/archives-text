# STUDENT LIFE
## Consulting firms reach out to seniors Top companies attract high numbers of qualified applicants 
### SAMANTHA MCGIRR DESK EDITOR 
While many students on campus sport T-shirts and flip
flops, a select group of seniors are donning suits and slacks
as they stroll through White Plaza.
These students are participating in the intensive recruit
ment process for consulting companies. The companies,
with specialties ranging from finances to biotechnology, are
eagerly courting seniors who have begun exploring their
postgraduate options.
Bain & Company, a top global management consulting
firm that currently employs more than 150 Stanford alum
ni, is recruiting students for its associate consultant, or AC,
position. Suzanne Tollerud 'O7 M. A. 'OB, now a senior asso
ciate consultant, says the role of an AC is to work with clients
"in the process of solving complex business problems."
"These interactions range from simple data requests to
in-depth discussions with clients to brainstorm and debate
ideas," Tollerud wrote in an e-mail to The Daily. "As insights
and potential solutions begin to emerge, team members will
often return to the employees they have worked with to
share these ideas and iterate on strategy development."
ACs at Bain and other consulting firms work on small
teams, managing a caseload that changes daily. Sherry Ho
'll, an international relations maj or, spent the past summer
as a Bain AC intern at the firm's San Francisco office. She
said she enjoyed being exposed to a variety of business sec
tors.
"One thing I really like is that no two days are the same,"
said Ho, who will work for the firm full-time upon gradua
tion. "It varies a lot, and Bain is a very dynamic place to
work."
The excitement of the consulting field also drew in
Patrick MacKenzie 'll, a management science and engi
neering major who interned for Accenture this summer.
"It's a fast-moving environment where you're constant
ly switching from case to case," MacKenzie said. "You're
learning about new industries and constantly being chal
lenged."
MacKenzie, who plans to attend business school eventu
ally, said he views consulting as a learning experience rather
than as a long-term career prospect.The first step in that ex
perience, for most hopefuls, is the notoriously intense re
cruitment process. Many companies begin courting Stan
ford students before their senior year and continue with in
formational sessions and informal meet-and-greets in the
early fall.
"It's not uncommon for us to be in
contact with a recruit for a year or more
before we invite them to interview for
a full-time position," Tollerud said.
MacKenzie, who has attended sev
eral sessions, says that the number of
students in attendance makes it diffi
cult to gain face time with company
representatives. He recently attended a
McKinsey & Company session in a

completely fullTresidder Oak Room.
"It was really hard to speak with
McKinsey people because there were
so many students wanting to meet
them and network," MacKenzie said.
"There's definitely pressure to stand
out to someone at a company and have
a good conversation so they remember
you."
Applicants submit a resume and
transcript to the firms they are interest
ed in, and most firms send out inter
view requests within a week of receiv
ing applications. Bain's interview
process, like that of many other con
sulting companies, consists of two

rounds of case interviews.
"Our case interviews are based on
real business problems, very similar to
the ones our clients hire us to help them
solve," Tollerud said. "The case inter
view process is the best way for us to ac
cess a candidate's ability to be success
ful in the associate consultant role."
Firms typically present offers to
candidates within a week of interviews.
According to a 2008 article in Business-
Week, "Best Places to Launch a Ca
reer," entry-level consultants at top
firms can expect a starting salary of
$55,000, plus signing bonuses.
Though consulting firms work with

the Career Development Center
(CDC) to plan on-campus recruiting
events, CDC Director Lance Choy of
fers words of caution to students con
sidering the field.
"For some students consulting is a
great field," Choy wrote in an e-mail to
The Daily. "Unfortunately, I see far too
many students who pursue consulting
without exploring other options. For
many students, they pursue consulting
because of their friends. These students
think that it must be a good field be
cause so many others are pursuing this
field."
For students like Ho, however, con

suiting offers an opportunity to be an
integral and valued member of a
team. In few other professions, she
points out, are recent college gradu
ates given such a high level of respon
sibility right away.
"They [fellow consultants] don't
discredit you for your age," Ho said. "If
you're on a four-person team, they ex
pect you to work just as hard as every
one else. You have the chance to make
an impact immediately, and that's
hard to come by."
