# Row is hit with three alleged burglaries
## Storey, 680 Lomita and Kairos residents report stolen laptops, iPods 
### KELSEY KING 
Several houses on the Row have re
ported burglaries in the past week, re
sulting in the loss of thousands of dol
lars' worth of student belongings, in
cluding laptops and iPods.
The first reported break-in occurred
around 3 a.m. on Saturday, when four
unidentified men entered a first-floor
room of Storey House, according to res
ident Chris Jenkins 'l3.
According to Storey resident assis

tant Andy Hiller 'll, the four men were
able to enter the room through an open
door, which accesses the Tresidder park
ing lot, after it had been propped open
to keep the students' room cooler.
Jenkins was asleep when the men en
tered his room. His two roommates
were in the kitchen.
"I had been asleep for a few hours
when four men came into the room,"
Jenkins said. "I heard them and got out
of bed and grabbed hold of one of them,
but they got away."

The intruders stole an XBox and
Jenkins' laptop, as well as his two room
mates' laptops.
On Saturday evening, residents at
680 Lomita also experienced a burglary.
Community manager Alexei Dunaway
'll said two first-floor rooms were bro
ken into.
Among the items stolen were bottles
of scotch, an iPod and Engineering 60
textbook. Dunaway said these were par
ticularly interesting items to steal, given
that there were five computers between

the two rooms. He said the choice of
stolen items could suggest the identity
of the perpetrator.
"I mean, who steals an E-60 book?"
Dunaway said. "That makes me think
it's Stanford people."
The most recent alleged burglary oc
curred on or before Monday afternoon
at Kairos, when someone entered the
room of kitchen manager Michelle
Mederos 'll and stole her netbook and
