# Row is hit with three alleged burglaries
## Storey, 680 Lomita and Kairos residents report stolen laptops, iPods 
### KELSEY KING 
Several houses on the Row have re
ported burglaries in the past week, re
sulting in the loss of thousands of dol
lars' worth of student belongings, in
cluding laptops and iPods.
The first reported break-in occurred
around 3 a.m. on Saturday, when four
unidentified men entered a first-floor
room of Storey House, according to res
ident Chris Jenkins 'l3.
According to Storey resident assis

tant Andy Hiller 'll, the four men were
able to enter the room through an open
door, which accesses the Tresidder park
ing lot, after it had been propped open
to keep the students' room cooler.
Jenkins was asleep when the men en
tered his room. His two roommates
were in the kitchen.
"I had been asleep for a few hours
when four men came into the room,"
Jenkins said. "I heard them and got out
of bed and grabbed hold of one of them,
but they got away."

The intruders stole an XBox and
Jenkins' laptop, as well as his two room
mates' laptops.
On Saturday evening, residents at
680 Lomita also experienced a burglary.
Community manager Alexei Dunaway
'll said two first-floor rooms were bro
ken into.
Among the items stolen were bottles
of scotch, an iPod and Engineering 60
textbook. Dunaway said these were par
ticularly interesting items to steal, given
that there were five computers between

the two rooms. He said the choice of
stolen items could suggest the identity
of the perpetrator.
"I mean, who steals an E-60 book?"
Dunaway said. "That makes me think
it's Stanford people."
The most recent alleged burglary oc
curred on or before Monday afternoon
at Kairos, when someone entered the
room of kitchen manager Michelle
Mederos 'll and stole her netbook and

Residents say intruders entered Storey on Friday evening through this back door, which was propped open, and stole three laptops and an XBox from the residents
of one room. Residents in 680 Lomita and Kairos also have also reported thefts during the past week.
iPod, Mederos said. She echoed Dun
away's observation that the burglars
selected an unusual assortment of be
longings to steal.
"I had a lot of other valuable things
laying out," Mederos said. "I had a
desktop monitor, a nice 35mm camera
and j e welry, but none of that was taken.
It's really sort of obscure. It makes me
believe that it's some student some
where who just wants to sneak in and
sneak out and knows campus well
enough to do that."
Despite the recent string of Row
break-ins, Police Lt. Rich Cinfio of the
Department of Public Safety (DPS)
said the incidents are not yet indicative
of a larger trend and are all "under in
vestigation."
"There's not a concentrated pattern
of crime on campus," he said.
According to DPS, there have

been 79 burglaries on campus thus far
in 2010. DPS considers each victim of
theft to constitute a separate burglary,
for a total of 49 incidents since Janu
ary.
Nonetheless, the recent burglaries
have led some students to call for
greater security measures and the in
stallation of more security cameras.
"We understand that there are a lot
of ways to get into a building, but we
don't understand why there's no secu
rity camera in Tresidder parking lot,"
Jenkins said. "There's nothing stopping
someone from breaking a window."
Cinfio said security cameras "can be
a good tool" to assist in crime preven
tion, but he said the addition of cam
eras to that area would be problematic.
"The problem is, who is going to
monitor these security cameras?"
Cinfio said. "They're not practical in
terms of responding to a crime in
progress, and also, for parking lots we
would need video cameras sensitive to
low-light situations, which are very ex
pensive."
Instead, campus police and Student

Housing urge students and Row staff
to take preventative measures to help
keep possible intruders out.
"It's important to be aware of your
surroundings, and challenge someone
who looks suspicious by asking them
what they're doing there," Cinfio said.
"It's also important to lock your doors
and windows and secure your valu
ables."
Rodger Whitney, executive direc
tor of Student Housing, agreed that
students must play an active role in
keeping the residences safe through
out the year.
"Incidences of unauthorized en
trance are always a good time to re
mind residents of the key part they play
in security," Whitney wrote in an e-mail
to The Daily.
According to Whitney, this includes
being continuously aware of who is in
their residence, and reporting malfunc
tioning doors and latches to the emer
gency maintenance hotline.
