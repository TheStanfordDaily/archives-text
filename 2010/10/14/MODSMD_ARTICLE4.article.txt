## GSC talks Constitutional Council picks 
### ANNA SCHUESSLER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
On Wednesday, the Graduate Student
Council (GSC) prepared for upcoming holi
days, discussed recent nominations to the
ASSU Constitutional Council and clarified
policies about religious and political events.
The Council's Thanksgiving coordinator,
doctoral student in earth sciences Mary Van

der Hoven, announced plans to revamp the
menu for the annual dinner given for gradu
ate students in honor of Turkey Day. Van der
Hoven was pleased with last year's increased
attendance but was determined to improve
the programming for graduate students and
their families spending the upcoming
Thanksgiving break on campus. According
to Van der Hoven, last year's event attracted
hundreds of students, but she invited willing

participants to add some creativity to the
event.
"What I would really like is for someone
to take it and run with it, get creative," Van
der Hoven.
The GSC turned from celebrations to
speculation as Ryan Peacock, a graduate stu
dent in chemical engineering and ASSU ex-
ecutive cabinet member, brought an
Oct. 12 Stanford Review blog post to
the council's attention. In the post, blog
ger Otis Reid 'l2 questioned the recent
selection of three new nominees for the
ASSU Constitutional Council, postu
lating that GSC politics may have
played a role in the developments.

"Otis was able to get a little infor
mation from an anonymous source,"
Peacock said. "I think it was unfortu
nate that that message was sent be
cause it was not true."
Reid wrote that Brianna Pang 'l3,
former GSC beat writer for The Daily,
was a first-round Constitutional Coun
cil nominee but was not re-nominated
in the second round, raising "concern
about the impartiality of GSC mem
bers ... towards her nomination."
(Pang remains a Daily staff member.)
Peacock addressed this issue as well.

"As a GSC member from the previ
ous year, we thought Brianna was
great," Peacock said. "She turned the
level of reporting on the GSC around."
Samir Siddhandti 'l2, representing
one of the second-round nominees to
the Constitutional Council, attended the
meeting and fielded questions posed by
GSC members about his new position.
The meeting concluded with an in
vitation to discuss the GSC's bylaws re
garding funding for religious and polit
ical events. Krystal St. Julien, a gradu
ate student in biochemistry, reported
recommendations given in a recent
meeting with representatives from
Student Activities and Leadership
"The recommendation was that we
should be open to funding religious
events," St. Mien said. "Everyone must
feel welcome attending. On the politi
cal side, keep the bylaw stating that we
don't fund political events unless they
are educational."

that that message was sent
because it was not true."
