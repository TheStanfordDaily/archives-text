## Recent study suggests love may be a natural painkiller 
### BRANDON POWELL 
Your blossoming relationship may be
providing more than just an ear to listen and
a shoulder to cry on. It may actually be re
lieving your pain. A recent study at the
School of Medicine suggests that love may
alleviate pain in the same way narcotic
painkillers do.
Sean Mackey, associate professor of
anesthesia, Jarred Younger, a professor of
anesthesia, and Arthur Aron, a professor of
psychology at SUNY Stony Brook, collabo
rated on a study investigating the pain-re
lieving capabilities of love that was pub
lished Wednesday online in PLoS ONE.
Subjects in the early stages of a romance
nine months or fewer into a relationship
were shown pictures one at a time of their
significant other or of a platonic friend while
receiving pain in the form of either intense
blasts of heat to the hand. As comparison,
the study also measured pain relief that sub
jects felt when they were given a word-dis
traction test while experiencing pain.
The subjects were then asked to rate
their pain levels, at which point the experi
menters could compare those results to the

neurological changes they observed.
"The centers that were being activated
that were responsible for the pain relief
were definitely general reward centers,"
Younger said. "These regions are also the
ones activated by drugs of abuse, sex, eating
really good food anything that your
body wants you to keep doing."
Younger said the reward sensation feeds
into pain-suppressing centers that can block
pain signals from reaching the brain, a
process known as analgesia. Since love is an
experience of reward, it could in fact have
analgesic effects.
"[Art] and his wife study passionate love
and I study pain," Mackey said in describing
how the study got started. "We got to talk
ing about the brain systems of love and the
brain systems of pain and realized there was
tremendous overlap."
Mackey then offered Younger, a post
doctoral student at the time, the opportuni
ty to join the study and assist the love-pain
experiment.
"I think we picked love because it's one
of the strongest naturally occurring reward
experiences that we can actually emulate in
the scanner," Younger said.

Furthermore, Younger expressed hope
that harnessing the activity of these brain
regions could lead to the discovery of non
addictive methods of controlling pain.
"One of the possibilities is that now that
we see some of the regions associated with

love that reduce pain significantly, we may
be able to teach that person how to control
their activity in that region," Younger said.
Younger conceded, however, that it may

be difficult to determine how specifically to
induce love and thus reduce pain.
"We can't ask them to have an affair or
anything," Younger said, "but it could be
that anything rewarding could reduce
pain."
Still, Younger maintained that love is
among the strongest of the reward sensa-
