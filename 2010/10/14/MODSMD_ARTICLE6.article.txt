### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Ellen Huet 
The Dalai Lama is set to headline a va
riety of events on compassion, altruism
and a meaningful life Thursday and Friday
at Stanford.
The exiled Tibetan Buddhist leader's
last visit to campus was in 2005, when he
discussed the biological meanings of com
passion with scientists and Buddhist lead
ers and explored spiritual and scientific
aspects of suffering, craving and choice.
On this visit, His Holiness the 14th
Dalai Lama is set to host a public talk
from 9:30 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. on Thursday in
Maples Pavilion about compassion and al
truism and their central roles in human so
ciety. Following the public talk, the Office
of Religious Life will host the Dalai Lama
as the 2010 Rathbun Visiting Fellow, and
as such, he is scheduled to give the annual
memorial Harry's Last Lecture on a
Meaningful Life from 2:00 p.m. to 3:30
p.m. in Memorial Church.
On Friday, he is set to serve as a pan
elist in the all-day conference "Scientific
Explorations of Compassion and Altru
ism" in Memorial Auditorium. His fellow
speakers and panelists include education
professor Linda Darling-Hammond, psy
chology professor emeritus Philip Zim
bardo, neurosurgeon James Doty, associ
ate bioengineering professor Karl Deis
seroth and economics professor Bill Har
baugh, among others. The Dalai Lama is
set to serve as a panelist in all four confer
ence sessions, which cover both societal
and biological interactions with compas
sion.
Tickets for both Thursday talks and the
Friday conference are sold out, but the
University is broadcasting both days'
events via live webcast. A recording of the
event will be available on iTunes U and
