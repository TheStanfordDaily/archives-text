## Arabic sparks new passions

( -w- went to Egypt for personal rea-
I sons, as a means of escape. I
I needed a break. But little did I
I know that my experience there
would completely alter my ac
ademic plans for the future, and my already
set pre-med major would change into a life
long passion for Arabic and the Middle
East."
Born into a time in which Middle East
ern issues are at the forefront of American
politics, Michelle Lee 'l4 has recently real
ized the strategic necessity of studying Ara
bic in today's politically complex world.
Thousands of others are following suit.
Ever since the 9/11 terrorist attacks in
2001, there has been a nationwide surge in
college-student enrollment in Arabic and
study abroad in the Middle East. According
to a study by the Institute of International
Education, the number of American stu
dents spending their junior year in Arabic
speaking countries has increased six-fold,
from 562 in 2002 to 3,399 in 2007.
Khalil Barhoum, the coordinator of Mid
dle Eastern and African Languages and Lit
eratures at Stanford, notes that according to
a recent survey conducted by the Modern
Language Association, "Arabic enrollment
at the university level has more than dou
bled nationally between 2004 and 2008, and
so has the number of institutions offering
programs over the same period, with 23,974
students currently enrolled in 466 programs
around the country."
This upward trend of interest in Arabic
and the Middle East exists at Stanford as
well, though the University has no formal
Middle Eastern studies department.
"We have seen our numbers often triple
and quadruple each fall quarter over the last
few years," Barhoum said. "It is not unusual
for us these days to have over 120 students
enrolled in Arabic classes each fall quarter
since Sept. 11,2001."
Arabic instructor Khalid Obeid agrees,
noting that students are attracted to Arabic
for a variety of reasons.
"We've seen in many articles and studies
that the number of students interested in
Arabic increased after 9/11," Obeid said.
"But I've seen a genuine interest in students
learning Arabic for the culture and language
away from the conflict. Many of them are
taking it for themselves. They just want to
learn a foreign language and enhance their
language skills."

Lee concurs, insisting that learning Ara
bic and understanding culture go hand in
hand.
"Learning a language is more than just
learning the words and definitions," she said.
"It's more about understanding the cultural
paradigm and ideology. In the little sub
tleties in which Arabs communicate, we get
a glimpse of their culture."
The students in Obeid's Level I Arabic
class come from a variety of backgrounds.
Some focus their studies in history, interna
tional relations and political science, but a
growing number of them hope to major in
engineering, law, anthropology and archae
ology.
"What all of my students have in com
mon is interest in the Middle Eastern region
and culture," Obeid said. "I have archaeolo
gy students who are interested in studying
sites in the Middle East and engineering stu
dents who believe that having a strong foun
dation in Arabic will help them in finding fu
ture employment. The motivation is not al
ways politics."
History professor Joel Beinin noted that
there is a "clear difference at Stanford be
tween students taking classes in Arabic and
students taking classes in Middle Eastern
politics."
While the number of students signing up
for Arabic has grown in the years following
9/11, the number of students expressing in
terest in taking his Middle Eastern politics
classes has dropped.
"I teach a course on the Arab-Israeli
conflict in winter quarter," Beinin said. "In
the past, my course has been very difficult
to get into. I would have to turn students
away. But this year, I don't even know what
enrollment's going to be like. I'm sure that
a freshman could even get in this year."
Political science Prof. Lisa Blaydes be
lieves that there is room for develop
ment and expansion in the realm of
Middle Eastern politics. Blaydes just
returned from two years at the Har
vard Academy for International and
Area Studies
"I think when it comes to the
Middle East, there is enough
student demand, and it's suf
ficiently important that the
University does need to pro
vide coursework and advising
for students who are interested
in the area," she said. "We're not
talking about a small university. I
think Stanford is large enough to

handle that kind of diversity of scope."
Meredith Wheeler 'l4 came to Stanford
with a strong background in Arabic and
Middle Eastern politics. In the summer be
fore her senior year of high school and again
during her gap year, Wheeler participated in
the National Security Language Initiative, a
project within the State Department's Criti
cal Language Scholarship Program that en
courages college-age students to study Ara
bic. She believes that the upward trend of
students studying Arabic is "to an extent tar
geted toward the State Department initia
tives, because the government benefits if
there are more Arabic speakers in the
world."
After living in Jordan and Egypt, Wheel
er gained interest not only in the Arabic lan
guage, but also in Middle Eastern culture
and politics, so she was somewhat disap
pointed that Stanford lacks formal pro
gramming in this area.
"I hope that the University will start to
invest more in Middle Eastern studies in
general," Wheeler said. "The Middle East is
currently one of the most politically volatile
and socially complex regions in the world,
and while there is sufficient coursework
dealing with the Middle
East, Stanford lacks a syn- A
thesized pro-

gram and major to unite these classes for
students like me."
It is unclear if the inverse relationship be
tween students taking Arabic and those in
terested in Middle Eastern culture and poli
tics will remain.
"As a third-year Arabic student and
someone who is passionate about Middle
Eastern politics, I hope that this growing
trend is just the beginning for Stanford
and that we will be able to push for new
infrastructure in academic program
ming before we graduate," Wheeler
said. "If every class could be like my
intro seminar, Everyday Political
Life in the Authoritarian Middle
East, my life would be com
plete,"
