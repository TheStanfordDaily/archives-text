# NONPROFIT FOR HEALTH EDUCATION

It's new. It's nonprofit. It provides pa
tient education. It's Anjna: A New Joint
Nonprofit Approach to Patient Educa
tion.
Founded in May 2010 by Stanford under
graduates, Anjna is a student-run organiza
tion that develops and disseminates high
quality health education materials to free
clinics around the Palo Alto area, as well as to
other institutions across the country, includ
ing Cornell, Harvard and HEC Paris. The
main focus is to establish health education in
frastructure programs in free clinics where
patients have one-on-one interactions with
health educators.
Among its many programs and services,
Anjna targets socioeconomically disadvan
taged patients by providing health education
materials, such as easy-to-read pamphlets in
different languages, to areas where these ma
terials are lacking. It strives to improve the
treatment and prevention of diseases, includ
ing obesity, diabetes, hypertension, depres
sion and other chronic illnesses.
Anjna began with a team of 15 members
led by its founder and executive director Vi
neet Singal 'l2 and Donovan Barfield 'l2, the
managing director. Singal first came up with
the idea for the organization after taking a
quarter off from Stanford to volunteer full
time at St. Vincent's Free Clinic in Galveston,
Texas.
Galveston's community was suffering
from a weak economy ever since Hurricane
Ike, which forced many people in under
served populations to lose their health insur
ance and thus made them dependent on free
clinics for treatment.
"I noticed how many people were suffer
ing from diseases like diabetes and obesity
and high blood pressure," Singal said of his
work in Galveston. "The worst part is that
these diseases are preventable; there's no
reason why people should have to have
them."
In response to the lack of quality patient
and health education infrastructure, Singal
started a health education program at the
clinic in Galveston by partnering with med
ical students who were working there. The

program eventually became integrated into
the clinic's regular operation.
To date, Anjna works with 40 partner clin
ics around the country and has already re
ceived awards for its work from foundations
such as DoSomething and Institute for the
Future. In contrast to other patient education
nonprofits, Anjna is the only nonprofit that
develops, translates and provides consulting
services specifically to free clinics.
Of the 40 clinics Anjna works with, most
are located in Santa Clara County. Anjna's

next priority is to scale up so that it has a na
tional presence.
"The future is to provide this service to
free clinics nationwide," Singal said. He
hopes that Anjna will eventually reach un
derserved patients worldwide.
Barfield, Anjna's managing director, said
that building the organization took a summer
of establishing the various disease teams
within the organization and applying for
grants.
"We've expanded in the span of about

four months," he said. "We have about 100
people within the organization, we've raised
$3,000 to implement our project in local clin
ics, and so we're really excited in seeing
where we can go."
Barfield has personal motivations for
working with Anjna.
"I myself was raised in an underprivileged
family," he said, "so it's really rewarding be
cause growing up, I was involved and I have
stories from my mom about going to free
clinics ... It's like I'm giving back directly to

a situation that I was once immersed in my
self."
Another key player in building and sup
porting Anjna is Dr. Tien-Wen Wiedmann,
Anjna's faculty advisor and a former pro
fessor in nuclear medicine at the School of
Medicine. With experience as founder and
president of H.E.L.P. for Kids, another
nonprofit dedicated to youth education
and development through partnership with
public schools, Wiedmann has assisted the
team with recruitment and has helped
Anjna define exactly what it wants to ac
complish.
"We want to make people rethink ... the
experience that a patient has when they go to
a free clinic," Barfield said. "It's not just they
come in, they get medicine, they leave. They
come in, they get to see a doctor, and they get
to sit down with somebody and talk about
their problems."
Wiedmann notes that one of the biggest
problems in health education efforts is pa
tients' noncompliance with their doctors' ad
vice.
"If you don't understand your own condi
tion, you don't do what the doctor says, most
ly because you don't understand what the
doctor says ... I personally think that educa
tion is very important, because if you really
understand the material [and] what's going
on, you will actually be a participant in your
treatment."
Wiedmann doesn't know whether patient
education makes a difference in the long run,
but in an analysis study on the efficacy of pa
tient education in chronic diseases and obesi
ty published in June 2010, researchers found
that 50-80 percent of patients who received
therapeutic patient education showed gener
al improvement in health.
Still, one of the biggest obstacles for
Anjna has been convincing larger health ed
ucation nonprofits and fiscal sponsors that
undergraduate students can accomplish this
project. A great source of assistance has been
the student body.
"The students have been awesome," Sin
gal said. "We've been blown away by the tal
ent of the student body and how dedicated to
a cause they have been."

to sit down with somebody and talk about
their problems."
Wiedmann notes that one of the biggest
problems in health education efforts is pa
tients' noncompliance with their doctors' ad
vice.
"If you don't understand your own condi
tion, you don't do what the doctor says, most
ly because you don't understand what the
doctor says ... I personally think that educa
tion is very important, because if you really
understand the material [and] what's going
on, you will actually be a participant in your
treatment."
Wiedmann doesn't know whether patient
education makes a difference in the long run,
but in an analysis study on the efficacy of pa
tient education in chronic diseases and obesi
ty published in June 2010, researchers found
that 50-80 percent of patients who received
therapeutic patient education showed gener
al improvement in health.
Still, one of the biggest obstacles for
Anjna has been convincing larger health ed
ucation nonprofits and fiscal sponsors that
undergraduate students can accomplish this
project. A great source of assistance has been
the student body.
"The students have been awesome," Sin
gal said. "We've been blown away by the tal
ent of the student body and how dedicated to
a cause they have been."
