## OH, SWEET NUTHIN'! The 						Good, the Bad and the Interesting 
### Roseann Cima 
I have this friend who has this theory. It is as
follows. Many people believe that gener
ally, unattractive people are very interest
ing, because they have to be to compete so
cially and sexually. This theory is concerned
with the inverse namely, that being very
physically attractive means you're uninter
esting.

"Because really attractive people get
whatever they want without having to try at
all." The upshot of this is that because
women, on the whole, are more attractive
than men, women are the less-interesting sex.
Actually, I have a few friends who have in
dependently arrived at this theory. They're
all tall slim CS majors, and most likely think
of themselves as "interesting."
But according to my own theory (of Inter
est and Attraction), people are driven to do
interesting things by internal pressures as
well as external ones. Even if it didn't yield
great stories that would likely get me laid,
given the opportunity, I'd still rather back
pack Tierra del Fuego than spend the sum
mer watching TV. And I think it'd be easier to
traipse the globe and have adventures for
Beautiful People because people often want
to help them out. They get invited to the best
parties, they're given the best things and they
have sex with the most Interesting People
(who must, by the original theory, be coping
very well).

So where are all the uninteresting beauti
ful people coming from?
Because my friends' theory seems to be
epistemically motivated. When I say, "Well,
you at least have to be interesting to your
self" they say, "Uh ..." and when I say,
"You don't think some of these people lead
rich internal lives?" they say, "Have you
ever heard two very attractive women talk
to one another?" They've got evidence to
which to point.
Obviously at some point (often here) I

say, "Wait a minute. On behalf of very attrac
tive women everywhere " My tongue pret
ty firmly in my cheek, but still. There is only
so far you can present a dualistic view of a
race or gender before you start wondering
into which category you fall.
Then they say, "That's different."
Then I get to hear them affect an airy, high
pitched voice, twirl their imaginary locks, and
say something about their "new lip gloss." Or
"Twilight."
"Not everybody attractive talks like that."
"The very attractive ones do."
I probe further and realize that "very at
tractive" means somebody who spends all of
his or her free time not travelling or reading
or learning to play the oud, but instead put
ting on makeup, buying clothes that flatter
his or her body and working out at the gym.
In light of this, the fact that these people are
not at all interesting is not at all interesting.
It's entailed in the terminology.
Anyways, the spiel usually ends (remem
ber the gender-issue here) with a call to arms.
To castigate very attractive women for unin
teresting conversations, because they won't
talk to the theorist often enough for him to
have an impact. I tell them that if somebody
starts talking about "Gossip Girl" or hair
product, I leave.
They usually thank me for that.
