## Why I quit having fun 
### 
Since 1892 Sigma Alpha Epsilon has de
voted itself to peddling a product for
which good work is irrelevant, because
people can't help themselves from having it.
This product is timeless and, at an emotional
level, it never changes. Of course, there is hap
piness associated with this product, a lot of
happiness. We knew it wasn't good for us, but
for many years we couldn't stop. In fact, our
entire existence to the outside world has de
pended on this legally dangerous product
known as "having fun."
Recently, my fraternity ended a long rela
tionship with having fun. Frankly, I'm both re
lieved and upset. The recent Kappa Sigma
"incident," which further demonstrates the
obvious fact that excess drinking could poten
tially lead to detrimental health effects, has
shown me that the risk is no longer worth the
reward with regard to many aspects of social
drinking and partying, mostly because certain
truths we hold to be self-evident (yes, I'm
aware how arrogant that sounds) are often
completely overlooked by the greater part of
the Stanford community. At some point peo
ple need to start taking personal responsibili
ty for their behavior and their actions. It's a lot

easier to say, "Someone in SAE gave me too
many drinks" than it is to say, "I had too much
to drink." Neither of these statements is factu
ally inaccurate. It's simply an act of delegating
responsibility.
Before we sharpen our knives and prepare
to slaughter the fraternity system, let's try and
understand it better. It makes sense that any
18-year-old freshman should have either a
broad conception of the negative conse
quences associated with drinking or an
awareness of the legal drinking age. It's far
easier for you to know your own age and lim
its than it for us to know that information,
having never met you before. Yet from the
University's perspective, we get in trouble
when you drink too much and require med
ical or legal assistance in the form of either a
hospital visit or a police escort accompanied
with a minor-in-possession ticket (which you
really don't want). When someone goes to the
hospital or someone gets arrested, blame
needs to be distributed that's just what
happens when paperwork gets filed. It's very
easy for both the University and victim to
blame the fraternity system. Passing the buck
to an institution people generally have no
problem demonizing is an easy out. I'm not
saying crimes don't occur on the Stanford
campus. I'd never make such a bold claim. Yet
the difference between personal regret and
proclaiming someone else is to blame for
your actions is a thin line. I believe putting the
blame on one institution dehumanizes all
sides.

Drinking responsibly is a talent. Being re
sponsible when sober is a moral choice. Peo
ple are going to drink, and sometimes, people
are going to drink too much.This is a reality of
college. Sadly, as stated earlier, the current
risk of throwing a party outweighs the reward
of having one which should explain why
there were so many more all campus parties
when I was a freshman than there are now.

Parties are dangerous because the world is
dangerous. It just seems easier to pass the
blame under the veil of "public safety" or play
a game of hot potato with legal responsibility
rather than deal with these realities. We're not
going to solve the problem of administering
blame in a legal sense once an incident has
happened. When the situation is in the hands
of a legal entity, all bets are off because every
one will try to protect themselves. This is sys
temic and not something than can be
changed.
What I'm imploring everyone to do is take
the necessary steps to avoid a hospital trip or
a legal issue. We're doing our part and I'm try
ing to be as sincere as possible in writing this
(I really don't need to disclose any of this in
formation). All I ask is for you guys to do your
part, and hopefully, we can get back to making
frat parties fun again. Otherwise, we'll stick to
private events instead of opening our doors to
everyone, which is what we really want to do.
