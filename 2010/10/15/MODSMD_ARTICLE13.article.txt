# SENSE AND NONSENSE
## Too Scared to Believe 
### Aysha Bagchi 
When it comes to believing, there are
two dangerous pitfalls. Dogmatism
is the traditional one, where people
know what they know so wholeheartedly
that they never appreciate complexity and
their views never change. We have been
fighting that problem for centuries. A mix
ture of moral relativism and abstinence from
public beliefs is now often the college fash
ion, where students know (or kind of, sort of
think?) what they know so weak-heartedly,
and with such skepticism about the knowl
edge-seeking enterprise, that they never gain
a firm grip on their own opinions or bother to
wrestle with differing views.
Stanford graduate Sam Harris 'B9 de
scribed on The Daily Show last week how we
have "a kind of intellectual and moral emer
gency" today where the only people on the
planet who think there are right answers to
moral questions are "religious demagogues."
Everyone else, he argued, "seems to think
that there's something suspect about the con
cept of moral truth." Kevin Baumgartner
wrote a nice piece in The Stanford Review
last week about moral relativism on campus
(and I think he underestimated its preva
lence). In the introduction to "The Closing of
the American Mind," Allan Bloom describes
how it took a lifetime for Socrates to figure
out he was ignorant, but now every high
school student knows only that.
There was a time when what most univer
sity students needed to appreciate, on a funda
mental level, is that the world is naturally com
plex. Now, many students either think it is so
complex that it is impossible to judge any
thing, or they simplify it by cutting out the
complex parts. Moral relativism and absti

nence from public beliefs are common results.
These results are strengthened by our po
litical world. Students are conscious of how
past generations have proven intolerant and
unable to appreciate all the basic ways in
which the differences be tween us do not justi
fy differing political or moral treatment. Cru
sades, slavery, imperialism, segregation, op
pression and tyranny that's one version of
History 101. Our response to it has been: stop
believing there are differences in the first
place or thinking that your beliefs can some
how be better. It is not that students do not
have moral or political opinions, just that they
have a problem with the idea of defending
them, or even of taking them too seriously.
The difficulty with this attitude is that
progress requires thinking about debatable
things, which requires thinking thought can
get us somewhere. That is how we agreed (in
another version of History 101) that slavery
is wrong, that women should vote, that it
would be nice if children had the chance for
an education. It was through pioneers who
fought for the right beliefs, who believed in
believing, but also in earnestly engaging with
differing views. An appreciation of this ver
sion of history was, I think, underlying the

Dalai Lama's urge to students at the end of
his talk on Thursday to embrace the 21st cen
tury as the "century of dialogue."
The "Know-Nothing" nativist political
movement of the 1840s and 1850s, sparked by
popular fears that the U.S. was being over
whelmed by German and Irish Catholic im
migrants, got its label because it was so dog
matic. Its followers knew nothing because
they thought they knew everything, and
thought so despite their true ignorance of the
world. Now, too many of us take refuge in
claiming to know nothing about morality or
other complex things. It is true that when we
do not believe anything, or do not claim that
our beliefs are meaningful, we at least avoid
making mistakes and becoming arrogant
about mistaken convictions. Those are gen
uine pitfalls. But we should keep in mind that
without mistakes, and without the misplaced
self-assurance that can accompany them, we
make no progress.
To believe while still appreciating the
world's history of mistakes (and each of our
personal histories) is contradictory. It means
believing we know things while earnestly ac
cepting that we will one day believe we were
wrong about some of them. This contradic
tion is an inherent part of human life. Per
haps the biggest challenge for today's stu
dents in trying to be as logical as we can
about the world is to accept while ever or
dering its inherent illogic, and still be will
ing to persevere. Maybe that's what intellec
tual maturity is.

Aysha will probably believe intellectual matu
rity is something else tomorrow. She welcomes
your thoughts at abagchi@stanford.edu.
