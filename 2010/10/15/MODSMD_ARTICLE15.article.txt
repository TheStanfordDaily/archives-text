## PROTECTING PERFECTION Undefeated Card hosts Washington schools 
### NATE ADAMS DESK EDITOR 
The No. 1 Stanford women's soccer team
may have tackled one of this year's biggest
challenges when it swept a talented pair of
Los Angeles schools on the road last week
end, but it will have its hands full once again
as it hosts its first set of conference games
against Washington State and Washington.
For as much as Stanford (11-0-2,2-0 Pac-10)
has accomplished in its undefeated season,
the Cougars (6-7,1-1) and Huskies (9-3-1,2-
0) are formidable teams in their own right,
and have impressed in their recent outings.
The duo of Northwestern squads each
hosted the Arizona schools last weekend,
posting a combined record of 3-1. The
Huskies, Stanford's opponent in Sunday's
game, managed to sweep both teams a
particularly difficult feat against then-No. 25
Arizona State, who had just two losses on
the year before its defeat in Washington.
The Cougars, meanwhile, hung tough
against ASU in a 1-0 loss and shut out Ari
zona two days later, 1-0.

The performance of the Washington
schools on opening weekend, combined
with Stanford's victories over USC and No.
16 UCLA (both 1-1 in the conference), put
them in position to gain an early edge in the
Pac-10 standings. The Cougars and Huskies
both advanced to the second round of the
NCAA Tournament last year, and would no
doubt like to return.

"Washington and Washington State are
both definite contenders," said Stanford head
coach Paul Ratcliffe. "So we have to play our
best to beat them. We have to earn it."

Despite having a less-than-stellar record
on the year as a whole, the Cougars showed
last year that they can push a team like Stan
ford to the limits. On a rainy afternoon last
October, Washington State, ranked No. 14 at
the time, forced the Cardinal into its only
overtime game of the regular season. A goal
from Christen Press tied it in the 87th
minute, and Stanford barely maintained its
perfect record with a golden goal from re
cent graduate Kelley O'Hara.
Of course, Washington State's roster has
changed since its thrilling meeting with the
Cardinal last season. While it isn't faring
quite as well in the standings at the moment,
Ratcliffe considers it a well-built team.

"I think Matt Potter's a great coach at
Washington State, he has a really solid team
and they're always tough to play against," he
said. "It's always a hard game, so I expect it
to be difficult and we've got to prepare for
them, for sure."

The Cougars and Huskies both had im
pressive weekends against the Arizona
schools, but it's hard to argue that they have
more momentum then the Cardinal. Stan
ford has won its last 10 contests, including
matches against then-No. 3 Portland and
then-No. 13 Santa Clara. Over that stretch,
the Cardinal has scored 33 goals while al
lowing only five, Stanford also boasts the na
tion's co-leader in goals scored (Christen
Press, with 16) and the Pac-10 leader in as
sists (midfielder Teresa Noyola, with nine).

Speaking of his recent victories over
USC and UCLA in particular, Ratcliffe was
quick to point out that the Cardinal can't
rest on its laurels, but acknowledged that
success breeds confidence.

"It shows that we're a really strong team
and we have the character as well, because
it's difficult to win at home against two real
ly strong opponents," he said. "So it should
give us a lot of self-confidence and self-re
lief."

While the Cardinal has clearly found a
formula for success in recent weeks, Rat
cliffe also isn't afraid to change up his team's
approach when necessary. Against USC last
Friday, sophomore midfielder Marjani
Hing-Glover got her first start of the year
while junior Camille Levin, who has some
experience at all areas of the field but has
played mostly at forward this season, started
as a defensive back.

The Cardinal could continue to change
its lineup this weekend.

"We're looking at different lineups
against different teams, we have so many
good players, so it's just a matter of our
mood and what we see tactically for each
game," Ratcliffe said. "Marjani did a
tremendous job, Annie Case has been doing
a tremendous job if we put her at back, and
Cami's a great forward and back, so it's just
a game-day decision that we're looking at
the opponents."

The Cardinal will square off with the
Cougars at 5 p.m. on Friday, then will face
the Huskies at noon on Sunday. Both match
es will be held at Laird Q. Cagan Stadium.

NOTES: After opening the conference season with a

pair of victories in Los Angeles, the to-ranked Cardinal
will return home this weekend to take on the Washing
ton schools. While both opponents give Stanford rea
son to be careful, the Huskies in particular have been
hot recently. At the moment, they're tied with the Car
dinal for first in the Pac-10.

Marjani Hing-Glover, above, has played an increasingly large role on the Cardinal's offense in recent weeks. The sophomore forward has two
goals and just two starts this season, which came agasintthe talented duo of USC and UCLA when the Cardinal visited Los Angeles last weekend.
