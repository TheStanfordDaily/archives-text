# WOMEN'S VOLLEYBALL
## No. 2 Card hopes for rebound win 
### CAROLINE CASELLI DESK EDITOR 
After suffering its first loss of the
season last weekend in Los Angeles,
the No. 2 Stanford women's volleyball
team looks to regroup as it takes on
No. 7 Washington (15-1, 4-1 Pac-10)
and Washington State (6-9, 0-5) at
home this weekend.
Although the Card dropped a spot
in the national rankings and can no
longer boast an unblemished record,
the loss to No. 10 UCLA provided
Stanford with insight and areas to
work on heading into the weeks
ahead.
"We learned what every team
learns when they lose we are beat
able and have things to work on," said
senior libero Gabi Ailes. "We learned
we have to prepare with the same
focus for every team we play."
With no undefeated Pac-10 teams
remaining after last weekend's match
es, Washington sits with Stanford and
No. 6 California atop the conference
standings as the only one-loss teams.
The Huskies fell to No. 17 Oregon on
the road in a 3-1 decision several
weeks back a team that the Cardi
nal swept decisively at Maples but

has since gotten back on track, taking
down two top-10 opponents (No. 5
USC and No. 10 UCLA) and cross
state foe Washington State.
Tonight's Washington-Stanford
matchup will bring together two of the
nation's most dominant attacking
teams. The Huskies currently boast the
best hitting percentage of all NCAA
Division I teams at .325, and the Card
is right behind them at .324. Stanford,
however, leads the nation in kills per
set (15.06 compared with Washing
ton's 13.92), and senior outside hitter
Alix Klineman is the conference kill
leader, averaging 5.63 per set.
The Huskies' strong front row has
received much of its firepower from
senior outside hitters Kindra Carlson
and Becky Perry and junior middle
blocker Bianca Rowland. Carlson is
sixth in the Pac-10 with 4.02 kills per
set, and Perry is 10th in the conference
with 3.67. Rowland boasts the best hit
ting percentage in the Pac, .438, and is
coming off of a strong 11-kill, .600 per
formance against Washington State
last weekend.
Senior setter Jenna Hagglund, an
All Pac-10 Team selection last year, is
averaging 11.92 assists per set, second
best in the conference. Hagglund,

along with Stanford's Klineman, was
recently named one of ten finalists for
the Lowe's Senior CLASS Award. In
its first year given to volleyball players,
the award honors student-athletes
who have excelled in community,
classroom, character and competition.
Both programs are perennial Pac
-10 powerhouses since 2004, Wash
ington and Stanford have finished first
or second in the conference and
though the Card leads the series
against the Huskies 44-10, the schools

NOTES I The Cardinal, ranked second national
ly, will look to rebound from its first loss of the
season as it takes on Washington and Wash
ington State this weekend. The Huskies in par
ticular, who also have just one loss this sea
son, should pose a difficult obstacle to that
goal when they face the Cardinal later this
evening.

have gone 8-8 since 2003.
On Saturday, Stanford will
square off against Washington State.
The Cougars' preseason was pep
pered with wins and losses, but they
have had little success of late, going
0-5 in Pac-10 play. As the only team
yet to win a conference match, the
Cougars sit last in the Pac, and have
been swept by their last three oppo
nents.

Junior outside hitter Meagan
Ganzer leads the Cougars' offense,
with an impressive 283 kills on the
season (5.44 per set) and 6.13 points
per set average she is second in
the conference to Klineman in both
statistical categories. Ganzer had 17
kills, three blocks and an ace in
Washington State's loss to Washing
ton last weekend.

WSU has also received notable
contributions from its underclass
men. Sophomore libero Oceana
Bush ranks fifth in the Pac-10 with
four digs per set, and freshman setter
Sara Biondi is seventh in the confer
ence with 9.96 assists per set.
The Cardinal is 46-3 against the
Cougars, last falling to them in 2002;
Washington State has never won at
Stanford.
"We are finding ways to improve
every day this year," Ailes said. "Our
goal is to continue climbing the
mountain and find away to reach the
peak at the right time right
around the Final Four."
"'And continue to enjoy playing
volleyball," she added. "Some teams
get so wrapped up in wins and losses,
they forget the reason they play vol
leyball."
Stanford will take on Washington
tonight and Washington State on
Saturday. Both matches are at 7 p.m.
in Maples Pavilion. In addition, stu
dents who attend the Washington
match will receive one Red Zone

NOTES I The Cardinal, ranked second national
ly, will look to rebound from its first loss of the
season as it takes on Washington and Wash
ington State this weekend. The Huskies in par
ticular, who also have just one loss this sea
son, should pose a difficult obstacle to that
goal when they face the Cardinal later this
evening.

have gone 8-8 since 2003.
On Saturday, Stanford will
square off against Washington State.
The Cougars' preseason was pep
pered with wins and losses, but they
have had little success of late, going
0-5 in Pac-10 play. As the only team
yet to win a conference match, the
Cougars sit last in the Pac, and have
been swept by their last three oppo
nents.

Junior outside hitter Meagan
Ganzer leads the Cougars' offense,
with an impressive 283 kills on the
season (5.44 per set) and 6.13 points
per set average she is second in
the conference to Klineman in both
statistical categories. Ganzer had 17
kills, three blocks and an ace in
Washington State's loss to Washing
ton last weekend.

WSU has also received notable
contributions from its underclass
men. Sophomore libero Oceana
Bush ranks fifth in the Pac-10 with
four digs per set, and freshman setter
Sara Biondi is seventh in the confer
ence with 9.96 assists per set.
The Cardinal is 46-3 against the
Cougars, last falling to them in 2002;
Washington State has never won at
Stanford.
"We are finding ways to improve
every day this year," Ailes said. "Our
goal is to continue climbing the
mountain and find away to reach the
peak at the right time right
around the Final Four."
"'And continue to enjoy playing
volleyball," she added. "Some teams
get so wrapped up in wins and losses,
they forget the reason they play vol
leyball."
Stanford will take on Washington
tonight and Washington State on
Saturday. Both matches are at 7 p.m.
in Maples Pavilion. In addition, stu
dents who attend the Washington
match will receive one Red Zone
Loyalty Point toward admission to
