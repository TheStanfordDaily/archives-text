# MEN'S WATER POLO
## Getting set for a SoCal swing 
### DASH DAVIDSON 
Coming off its biggest win of the
year, the No. 4 Stanford men's
water polo team (7-4, 1-0 MPSF)
will journey down to southern Cal
ifornia this weekend to battle two
familiar foes, UCLA and UC-Santa
Barbara.

The Cardinal will be looking to
build on the momentum from its
defeat of top-ranked USC this past
Saturday at Avery Aquatic Center.
Saturday's game saw the emer
gence of the Stanford defense, led
by redshirt junior goalie Brian Pin-

gree, as the deciding factor in the
game. The defense will try to back
up that effort against a UCLA team
that is ranked No. 3 in the country
and a UCSB squad ranked at No. 6.
The Bruins, whom the Cardinal
visits today at 7 p.m., are ranked
No. 3 by virtue of a stellar record (9-
3, 1-1 MPSF) that includes a 10-9
defeat of the Cardinal at the neu
tral site of the NorCal Invitational
Tournament on Sep. 19.
The Bruins will take to the pool
on a bit of a cold streak, having lost
two out of their last three matches,
falling to USC and Cal over the

past two weeks while only notching
one victory over Pacific.
UCLA is led by the strong at
tacking of divers Ben Hohl, who
has netted 22 goals, and Christiano
Mirachi, who has 21 goals to his
credit. The Bruins are also bol
stered by the sturdy defense of
their goalie, James Hartshorne, who
leads the Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation (MPSF) in saves per
game with 11.
The weekend's second game for
the Cardinal, on Sunday at 12 p.m.,is
against UC-Santa Barbara. The
Gauchos are sitting at No. 6 in the
rankings, a spot occupied by the Car
dinal last week, with a record of 9-4.
Sunday marks the opening of the
MPSF season for the Gauchos.
UCSB is coming off two wins
against lesser opponents in the last
week Concordia and Harvard.
The Gauchos have squared off
against the Cardinal twice so far this
season, in both the NorCal and
SoCal Invitationals. The teams have
split the two meetings, with each
school winning in the tournament
representing its half of California.
The Gauchos are led on offense
by driver Milos Golic, who has
scored 34 goals, and by goalie Myles
Christian, who has held opponents

to an impressive 6.73 goals against
per game.
Stanford is 4-2 so far this season
in games played in southern Califor
nia. This will be the third of the Car
dinal's four trips down to the south
ern half of the state this season.
Both games this weekend are set
to be matchups of star goalies, with
Friday's affair pitting reigning MPSF
player of the week Pingree against
Hartshorne, the conference's leader
statistically. Sunday sees Pingree
being matched up with Christian,

who is second in the MPSF in goals
allowed per game.
Stanford's win over USC this past
Saturday has caused some ripples
throughout the MPSF, including the
Cardinal moving up two spots in the
rankings, from sixth to fourth.
The Cardinal will take on UCLA
this Friday at 7 p.m. in Westwood,
Calif., then head to UC-Santa Bar
bara for a match on Sunday at noon.
