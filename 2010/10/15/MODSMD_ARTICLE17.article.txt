# MEN'S WATER POLO
## Getting set for a SoCal swing 
### DASH DAVIDSON 
Coming off its biggest win of the
year, the No. 4 Stanford men's
water polo team (7-4, 1-0 MPSF)
will journey down to southern Cal
ifornia this weekend to battle two
familiar foes, UCLA and UC-Santa
Barbara.

The Cardinal will be looking to
build on the momentum from its
defeat of top-ranked USC this past
Saturday at Avery Aquatic Center.
Saturday's game saw the emer
gence of the Stanford defense, led
by redshirt junior goalie Brian Pin-

gree, as the deciding factor in the
game. The defense will try to back
up that effort against a UCLA team
that is ranked No. 3 in the country
and a UCSB squad ranked at No. 6.
The Bruins, whom the Cardinal
visits today at 7 p.m., are ranked
No. 3 by virtue of a stellar record (9-
3, 1-1 MPSF) that includes a 10-9
defeat of the Cardinal at the neu
tral site of the NorCal Invitational
Tournament on Sep. 19.
The Bruins will take to the pool
on a bit of a cold streak, having lost
two out of their last three matches,
falling to USC and Cal over the

past two weeks while only notching
one victory over Pacific.
UCLA is led by the strong at
tacking of divers Ben Hohl, who
has netted 22 goals, and Christiano
Mirachi, who has 21 goals to his
credit. The Bruins are also bol
stered by the sturdy defense of
their goalie, James Hartshorne, who
leads the Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation (MPSF) in saves per
game with 11.
The weekend's second game for
