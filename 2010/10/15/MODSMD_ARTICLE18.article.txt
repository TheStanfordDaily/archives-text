# Fixing soccer in America, part 1 of 2
## 
### Tom Taylor 
I am not going to win any jour
nalism awards for re vealing that
America has never taken soc
cer fully to heart, but this fact
belies how central and impor
tant a position the U.S. could hold in
the future of the world game. Put sim
ply, America is in a unique position to
change soccer, and for the better.
Neither the U.S. nor soccer truly
needs each other: the sport is, and will
continue to be, the biggest game on

the planet, and America is still very
much a global superpower. But that
doesn't mean they shouldn't desire
each other's attention.

Patriotism is a defining American
quality and something that is borne
out at every U.S. sporting event, big or
small. Even the most un-soccer
friendly fan here must admit that if
the Stars and Stripes could stand atop
the world as undisputed global cham
pions of the biggest and brightest

sport, it would be a truly momentous
achievement.
At the same time, the U.S. is per
haps the biggest market worldwide
for sports. Even a tiny slice of that pie
is a very tempting thought for the
major forces in world soccer, but to
stand as true equals among the major
American sports is the one thing that
could somehow elevate the sport be
yond the global phenomenon it al
ready is.
Soccer wants to be big here, but it
cannot turn completely from its foun
dations to achieve this. Soccer is not,
and never will be, American football,
basketball or baseball, but it can, and
certainly will, make compromises to
win over the U.S. In this respect the
American sports fan holds a unique
power.
So what would you change about it if
you could? What's wrong with soccer?
Trying to position myself somewhere
in the mid-Atlantic so that I have a
half-British and half-American per
spective, these are the major challenges
I can see for soccer here.
Low scoring and ties:
Apart from hockey, the major
sports in the U.S. are all high scoring
games, but many soccer games are de
cided by just one goal and the 0-0 tie is
a frequent result. While a lack of goals
doesn't mean a game was in any way
boring, it is surely a major turn-off for
American audiences.
Cheats and bad referees:
Soccer players are renowned for
diving and faking injuries to gain an
advantage from an unsuspecting ref
eree. While there are many honest

players out there, this practice is so
widespread it has almost become an
accepted, though distasteful, part of
the game. At the same time, refereeing
errors are equally legendary. During
this year's World Cup there were sev
eral major mistakes that could well
have changed the results of games,
from goals disallowed to clear penal
ties dismissed.

While no one is perfect minor
cheating is acceptable in any sport and
no referee is infallible these mis
takes are often astoundingly obvious
to anyone watching.
Understanding the game:
Statistics are a big thing here. Base
ball fans may be the most stat-hungry,
but to analyze the performances of
players and teams in all of the big
sports, pundits rely heavily on these
numbers. Passing and rushing yardage,
shooting percentages, runs batted in
(RBI), etc.
Soccer doesn't lend itself well to the
typical mold of American sports be
cause it is pretty light on statistics, and
without timeouts, there perhaps isn't
even time to discuss the few numbers
that can be gleaned from a game.
Major League sports:
The MLS, NBA, NFL and NHL
are four of the biggest and brightest
professional leagues in the world, but
it's no secret that the MLS isn't the
best soccer league and it's not even
close. The best American players are
drawn to Europe, where the richest

and most illustrious clubs reside, and
so the MLS simply cannot compete.
With the time change across the At
lantic, the biggest games are rarely
played at sensible times for U.S.-based
fans, and when these teams do travel
to play games over here, they are only
ever friendlies or meaningless presea
son tournaments.

Accustomed to being able to watch
the very best in the world in the big four
sports, it's no surprise that fans here are
generally not that thrilled by the MLS.
College sports:
Gaining a college degree is a great
thing, but it may not be the best learn
ing experience for the top U.S. soccer
talent. The rules of NCAA soccer are
noticeably different from those
played professionally around the
world, and by their late teens the best
soccer players elsewhere may already
be at some of the top clubs, on multi
million dollar contracts, and may
even have played in the Champions
League or World Cup finals.
I've run out of space this week, so I
can't even attempt to come up with
some solutions for these problems.
Please tune in next week as I devote
another 700-odd words of your time
to my favorite sport and try to do just
that.
