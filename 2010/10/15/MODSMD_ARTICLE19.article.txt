# CROSS COUNTRY
## Men, women set for Pre-Nationals 
### ZACH ZIMMERMAN DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford men's and women's cross country
teams look to build off team victories at the Stanford In
vitational as the top runners head to Terre Haute, Ind.
for the NCAA Pre-Nationals.

The No. 1 men's squad dominated in its only group
appearance this year. With multiple runners capable of
finishing in any top 10, the Cardinal once again enters a
competition as the odds-on favorite.
However, unlike the Stanford Invitational, the team
will be tested by a much more talented field. Stanford is
joined by three other teams ranked in the top 10 No.
4 Colorado, No. 5 Northern Arizona and No. 8 Portland.
Junior Chris Derrick, last year's third place finisher
at the NCAA Championships, said that the team plans
on remaining consistent in its strategy, but will adjust to
the elevated level of competition.
"Our strategy for the [Stanford Invite and Pre-Na-

tionals] will be very similar," Derrick said. "We will look
to work together as a team and run people down at the
end. Because the front of the field is more competitive
than at the Stanford Invite we may break into two dis
tinct packs more quickly."
Derrick and senior Elliott Heath will strive to im
prove their already very impressive times on the Terre
Haute course. Last year, Derrick and Heath finished in
first and third, respectively, separated only by Sam
Chelanga of Liberty, who won the 2008 race by 44 sec
onds. Chelanga has since graduated, creating the poten
tial for a 1-2 Stanford finish.
Still, Pre-Nationals is a team race, and the Cardinal
will approach the 8,000-meter race like any other.
"As with any meet we enter we want to win as a
team," Derrick said. "Pre-Nats should also be helpful in
rehearsing our strategy for nationals."
The No. 17 women, down three spots in the polls, are
also off to a strong start. Like the
men, they were victorious at the
Stanford Invitational, performing at
a level that brought up questions
about their uncharacteristically low
ranking.
The women's Blue and White
races (eight and six kilometers, re
spectively) will also pose a tough
challenge for any team at the meet,
as four of the top-10 teams No. 3
Florida State, No 5 Georgetown,
No. 6 Arizona and No. 9 Colorado
will be on hand.
The Cardinal is led by sopho
more Kathy Kroeger, who won the
individual title at the Stanford Invi
tational. She hopes to help Stanford
improve on its fifth-place finish at
Pre-Nationals a year ago, a meet in
which she did not compete.
Junior Georgia Griffin, sopho
more Alex Dunne and freshman
Jessica Tonn also put together

strong performances and will be re
lied on heavily if Stanford is to chal
lenge for a podium position this
weekend.

Pre-Nationals is split up into two
races for each gender the Blue
and White races. The men will com

pete in the 8,000-meter Blue Race
at 9:10 a.m. while the women start
the 6,000-meter White Race at 8:35
a.m.
