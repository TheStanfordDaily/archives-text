## Men, women set for Pre-Nationals 
### ZACH ZIMMERMAN DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford men's and women's cross country
teams look to build off team victories at the Stanford In
vitational as the top runners head to Terre Haute, Ind.
for the NCAA Pre-Nationals.

The No. 1 men's squad dominated in its only group
appearance this year. With multiple runners capable of
finishing in any top 10, the Cardinal once again enters a
competition as the odds-on favorite.

end. Because the front of the field is more competitive
than at the Stanford Invite we may break into two dis
tinct packs more quickly."
Derrick and senior Elliott Heath will strive to im
prove their already very impressive times on the Terre
Haute course. Last year, Derrick and Heath finished in
first and third, respectively, separated only by Sam
Chelanga of Liberty, who won the 2008 race by 44 sec
onds. Chelanga has since graduated, creating the poten
tial for a 1-2 Stanford finish.
Still, Pre-Nationals is a team race, and the Cardinal
will approach the 8,000-meter race like any other.
"As with any meet we enter we want to win as a
team," Derrick said. "Pre-Nats should also be helpful in
rehearsing our strategy for nationals."
The No. 17 women, down three spots in the polls, are
