# Dalai Lama talks compassion at Stanford
## On day one of Farm visit, the Dalai Lama urges reconstruction of education system 
### KAMIL DADA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Bad news: four years of a Stanford
undergraduate education will not nec
essarily give you a well-rounded educa
tion, because the entire global educa
tion system needs to be revamped ac
cording to Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai
Lama, that is.

The head of state and the spiritual
leader of Tibet returned to the Farm on
Thursday, his third visit in recent years.
He was giddy, chuckled at his own jokes
and gestured while explaining how to
become compassionate.

Speaking to a standing-room only
crowd at Maples Pavilion in the morn
ing and Memorial Church in the after
noon, the Dalai Lama explained that
the education system today is based on
material values. This system, he argued,
develops the "brain" rather than the
"mind."

"Years ago, there were two types of
schools: the secular [school] and the
church," he said. "We must introduce
the concept of compassion and empathy
as fundamental, secular concepts that
children can use as a guide to follow."
He noted that having an open, com
passionate heart brings inner strength,
reduces fear and is essential to any indi
vidual's educational development.
"Compassion, with the help of wis
dom, always provides a broader, holistic
perspective," he said.

The 75-year-old Nobel Prize winner
was previously at Stanford in 1994 and
2005 to talk about nonviolence, medita
tion, science and spirituality. This time,
the primary reason for the trip was to
hear about the research at the new Cen
ter for Compassion and Altruism Re
search and Education (CCARE).
CCARE uses rigorous scientific
methods to attempt to explain the neu
roscience behind compassion and altru
istic behavior. In fact, the Tibetan leader
helped develop the center by donating
$150,000 in 2008 to fund the institute's
establishment.

"Now, because of neuroscience, there
is more attention to the mind and the re
lationship between the mind and the
brain," he explained. "Scientists in the
medical field are beginning to see the
importance of the mental state, to the
health of the body."

The Dalai Lama presents University President John Hennessy with a scarf on Thursday. The Tibetan leader,
speaking at Maples Pavilion, stressed the importance of infusing education with values of compassion.
He added that tranquilizers,
drugs and alcohol do not allow one
to develop a calm mind and inner
peace.
"Inner peace must develop
through mental ways, through men
tal process," he said.
The exiled Tibetan Buddhist
leader was also at Stanford as the
third annual Rathbun Visiting Fel
low. He delivered his own "Harry's
Last Lecture on a Meaningful Life"
and shared personal experiences on
how to lead a compassionate life of
purpose and moral values to a
packed audience in Memorial
Church.
The Rathbun fellowship was ere

ated in 2008 in memory of the late
law Prof. Harry Rathbun 'l6 J.D. '29
and his late wife, Emilia. The fellows,
who have included retired Supreme
Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor
'SO L.L.B. '52 and former Secretary
of State George Shultz,give an annu
al speech on what it takes to live a life
of meaning.
"Using force, you cannot solve
problems," the Dalai Lama reflect
ed. "You can control or eliminate the
body, but not [the] mind. You can
change your mind only through com
passion or education."
The Dalai Lama experienced the
use of force personally when China
invaded Tibet in 1949. After a failed
Tibetan uprising, he fled the region
at the age of four, and has lived in
Dharamsala, India, ever since. Yet
he saw the move in optimistic
terms-his time in India taught him
valuable lessons of peaceful coexis

tence.
"The world should learn from
India," he said. "All the world's
major religions have peacefully ex
isted in India for over 3,000 years."
However, he was quick to em
phasize that moral ethics do not
need to be based on a specific reli
gious faith. He noted that humans
were "created as social animals"
and that the survival of the individ
ual depends on community cooper
ation.
"I usually try to promote the
human value of compassion," he
said. "Secularism does not mean
you disrespect religion."
Sitting in orange robes and rose
tinted glasses, the Dalai Lama shied
away from giving specific advice on
how to make measurable steps to
ward world peace.
"You are the people who belong
to this century," he said. "My people

are of the 20th century and are now
ready to say good-bye. 50...y0u
should think how to bring a more
peaceful century, a more compas
sionate century."
However, he did leave the stu
dents with a clear message: the 21st
century needs to be focused on dia
logue instead of violence, and love
instead of anger.
"Irrespective of appearances, we
all have a desire to achieve a happy
life," he said with a smile. "Mental
ly, physically, emotionally, we are all
the same. We are the same human
being."
The Dalai Lama is set to serve as
a panelist in Friday's conference,
"Scientific Explorations of Com
passion and Altruism," which will
also be webcast online.

valuable lessons of peaceful coexis

tence.
"The world should learn from
India," he said. "All the world's
major religions have peacefully ex
isted in India for over 3,000 years."
However, he was quick to em
phasize that moral ethics do not
need to be based on a specific reli
gious faith. He noted that humans
were "created as social animals"
and that the survival of the individ
ual depends on community cooper
ation.
"I usually try to promote the
human value of compassion," he
said. "Secularism does not mean
you disrespect religion."
Sitting in orange robes and rose
tinted glasses, the Dalai Lama shied
away from giving specific advice on
how to make measurable steps to
ward world peace.
"You are the people who belong
to this century," he said. "My people

are of the 20th century and are now
ready to say good-bye. 50...y0u
should think how to bring a more
peaceful century, a more compas
sionate century."
However, he did leave the stu
dents with a clear message: the 21st
century needs to be focused on dia
logue instead of violence, and love
instead of anger.
"Irrespective of appearances, we
all have a desire to achieve a happy
life," he said with a smile. "Mental
ly, physically, emotionally, we are all
the same. We are the same human
being."
The Dalai Lama is set to serve as
a panelist in Friday's conference,
"Scientific Explorations of Com
passion and Altruism," which will
also be webcast online.
