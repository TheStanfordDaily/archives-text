# Dalai Lama talks compassion at Stanford
## On day one of Farm visit, the Dalai Lama urges reconstruction of education system 
### KAMIL DADA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Bad news: four years of a Stanford
undergraduate education will not nec
essarily give you a well-rounded educa
tion, because the entire global educa
tion system needs to be revamped ac
cording to Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai
Lama, that is.

The head of state and the spiritual
leader of Tibet returned to the Farm on
Thursday, his third visit in recent years.
He was giddy, chuckled at his own jokes
and gestured while explaining how to
become compassionate.

Speaking to a standing-room only
crowd at Maples Pavilion in the morn
ing and Memorial Church in the after
noon, the Dalai Lama explained that
the education system today is based on
material values. This system, he argued,
develops the "brain" rather than the
"mind."

"Years ago, there were two types of
schools: the secular [school] and the
church," he said. "We must introduce
the concept of compassion and empathy
as fundamental, secular concepts that
children can use as a guide to follow."
He noted that having an open, com
passionate heart brings inner strength,
reduces fear and is essential to any indi
vidual's educational development.
"Compassion, with the help of wis
dom, always provides a broader, holistic
perspective," he said.

The 75-year-old Nobel Prize winner
was previously at Stanford in 1994 and
2005 to talk about nonviolence, medita
tion, science and spirituality. This time,
the primary reason for the trip was to
hear about the research at the new Cen
ter for Compassion and Altruism Re
search and Education (CCARE).
CCARE uses rigorous scientific
methods to attempt to explain the neu
roscience behind compassion and altru
istic behavior. In fact, the Tibetan leader
helped develop the center by donating
$150,000 in 2008 to fund the institute's
establishment.

"Now, because of neuroscience, there
is more attention to the mind and the re
lationship between the mind and the
brain," he explained. "Scientists in the
medical field are beginning to see the
importance of the mental state, to the
health of the body."
