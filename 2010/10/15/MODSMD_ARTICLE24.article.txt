## Ballet meets The Shins in 'Oh, Inverted World' 
### â€“ stav ZIV contact stav: sziv@stanford. edu 
Last Friday evening, I settled
into my seat at the Palace of
Fine Arts Theatre in San
Francisco for Smuin Ballet's fall
season premiere. The evening had
opened with Michael Smuin's more
classically rooted "Brahms-Haydn
Variations," but the program quick
ly left behind the world of chiffon
dresses and tiaras for the scruffy
domain of indie rock a ballet set
to the power pop of The Shins.
Named after the band's 2001 debut
album, Smuin Ballet's "Oh,
Inverted World" was an innovative
world premiere by choreographer
Trey Mclntyre.
Normally, the endless opportu
nity for cliche would make me
cringe, but Mclntyre has proven
time and again that he can create
ground-breaking work set to any
music. This summer, Mclntyre fol
lowed Felix Mendelssohn's
"Wedding March" with glam-rock
Queen at Jacob's Pillow Dance
Festival. His company performed
"Wild Sweet Love," choreographed
to a medley that also featured the
The Partridge Family, Lou Reed
and Roberta Flack. Mclntyre is as
comfortable with Beethoven as he
is with Beck and The Beatles, or in
this case, The Shins.

The second of three pieces on
the night's program, "Oh, Inverted
World" was comprised of eight
dance vignettes that corresponded
to tracks on the album. No pointe
shoes were allowed in this ballet,

and though it could boast its share
of technical feats, the choreography
shied away from bravura. The
dancers, simply dressed in bright
shorts or in quirky two-piece
ensembles and socks, shuffled on
and off stage in a winding pattern,

each resting a hand on another's
shoulder.
The synchronized clump final
ly left one man in its wake, to begin
a series of solos, duets and small
groups that spilled one into the
next. The ballet's unusual sound
track accompanied Mclntyre's dra
matic and aesthetic insight and his
attention to detail. Each dancer's
nuanced movement vocabulary
kept the audience engaged and
curious, always one step away from
understanding the choice of song
paired with each section.
The program ended with Smuin's
even less conventional
"Bluegrass/Slyde." The ballet
which revolved around three spin
ning poles is equal parts cabaret,
musical and circus, a pinch of
county fair and dripping with sass.
As the dancers spun, bodies parallel
to the floor, on pointe with leg
extended outward or counterbal
ancing another dancer, they lent a
new, virtuosic and much less vulgar
meaning to pole-dancing.
In every permutation of ballet,
emulating or departing from tradi
tion, the dancers felt at home. The
Smuin Ballet Company, whose
technical level and artistry often
falls short of larger and more pres
tigious institutions like San
Francisco Ballet, distinguished itself
with energetic, playful and accessi
ble choreography. The program is
worth a trip when it comes to
Mountain View, Walnut Creek and
Carmel in February 2011, even if
you're not a bunhead yourself.
