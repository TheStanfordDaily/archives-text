# Maroon 5 at the Greek Theatre

The number in Maroon 5
naturally refers to the five
members in the group, but
just one listen to pretty much any
of their records makes it over-

whelmingly obvious that the star
is front man Adam Levine and his
distinctive voice. The same applies
to their live show as soon as the
Greek Theatre's lights went down
Sunday night, it was pretty clear
the audience had bought tickets to
the Adam show.

Levine sashayed onstage,
launching into the bouncy funk of
"Misery," the first single off their
latest record "Hands All Over." The
ditty fell in the same group as

their many groovy throwbacks,
including their most disco-heavy
one, "Makes Me Wonder," which
they reserved for the encore.

What Maroon 5 is great at
doing is maintaining an effortless,
organic feel to their live show. The
transitions between songs were
seamless jams between the boys,
like the smooth switch from the
opening song to "If I Never See

Your Face Again." The melodies
fell together like natural, comple
mentary puzzle pieces. The audi
ence didn't even realize one song
had ended until Levine began
singing the lyrics for the next one.
Maroon s's music videos
paint the quintet as young men
driven by gorgeous models and
glamour check the clips for
"Wake Up Call" or "Makes Me
Wonder." And Levine fully embod
ies those ideals in his stage pres
ence. It was a little ridiculous
watching him languorously strut
around the stage, making love to
his microphone, but what else can
we expect from a man whose
romantic dalliances are no
strangers to the tabloids?

Levine's larger-than-life stage
persona, however, didn't affect the
quality of the music. The moody
blue lights during "Secret"
matched its seductive indolence,
before segueing into a cover of
Tina Turner's "What's Love Got to
Do with It." Levine's voice never
faltered, even when he went up
into falsetto. His extra gentle han
dling of "Won't Go Home Without
You" made it an even more melan
choly serenade. The agitated,
head-bobbing beat of "Wake Up
Call" and aggressive, blistering
(relatively speaking) guitar of
"Shiver" proved Maroon 5 can do
more than just saccharine ballads.
Although they're sometimes
dismissed as an overrated pop
outfit specifically one that stole
the Best New Artist Grammy from

a more deserving Kanye West
Maroon 5 is still pretty ballsy in
the sense that they're one of the
few current pop bands that can
really pull off the blue-eyed soul
thing. Their cover of A1 Green's
R&B classic "Let's Stay Together"
didn't seem out of place at all.

They followed it up with a gentle,
stripped down rendition of "She
Will Be Loved." The slower song
and a couple of other tunes in
Maroon s's repertoire have
become regular fixtures on adult
contemporary radio stations,
which explained the surprisingly
large number of older folk inter
spersed between the excited young
women.
Of course, since the show was
on a Sunday, Levine was all but
forced to make a bad pun about
this "fine Sunday evening" before
closing out the night with a high

ly satisfying "Sunday Morning."
While promoting "Hands All
Over," Levine has stated in inter
views that this may be his final
foray with Maroon 5. He doesn't
have much left to gain from the
group their newest album did
n't even debut at number one,
knocked down a spot by Zac
Brown Band. Levine can do much
better than the merely pleasant
tunes found there, and he seems to
know it too. Unlike most bands
with a new record to push, out of
their 14-song set, Maroon 5 only
performed three songs from their
latest record. The wealth of old
favorites was a reminder of just
how good the band could be and
how most of their new tracks like
"Give a Little More" are adequate
at best.
In sum, the L.A. band put on
a great show not as Maroon 5
but as Adam Levine and his back
ing band. Levine visibly enjoyed
the attention, and the crowd did
too. But there just wasn't a real
give and take between Levine and
the rest of the band. He filled most
songs with his soulful vocals and
kept the rest of the good stuff for
himself, like a particularly sizzling
guitar solo on "Shiver."
Perhaps this will be Maroon
s's last hurrah before Levine kicks
off his inevitable solo career. If so,
at least it was a darn fun one.
