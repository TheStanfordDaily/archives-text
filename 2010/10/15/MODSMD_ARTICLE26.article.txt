California might not have any festive
foliage, but autumn is upon us, bring
ing with it the annual Fall Ball. On
Friday, Oct. 22, the seasons will change in
Roble Gym from 9 p.m. to 1 a.m. for a night
of live music, dancing, games and perform
ances, proving that football is not the only
kind of fall ball around here.

Last year's depression-era themed
Hooverville Hop prompted both elegant
(think Astaire and Rogers) and ragged (think
Great Depression). However, Fall Ball co-chair
Acata Felton 'l2 insists this year, "costumes
are admired, but not required."
A seasonally inspired motif will dress up
Roble Gym with autumn hues. Attire is at
attendees' discretion come classy, sassy or
completely casual.
The 17-piece Swing Solution Big Band
will play a whirlwind of high-energy swing,
salsa, foxtrot, tango, cha-cha and maybe a sur
prise or two. The band, one of the finest born
in the Bay Area during the neo-swing move
ment of the 19905, will keep the beat going
until midnight, when dance Prof. Richard
Powers will take over as DJ for a final hour of
dancing and games.

Attendees will have a chance to catch

their breaths while they are treated to per
formances by Danse Libre, Decadance, Swing
Cats and Swingtime, scattered throughout the
evening. Dedicated to reviving social dance
traditions and keeping them alive in the 21st
century, the four groups perform and teach
on campus and throughout the Bay Area.
The booming social dance culture on
campus, co-chairs Felton and Sonya
Chaudhry 'l3 agree, can be traced back to one
source: Richard Powers, a member of the
Dance Division faculty for nearly three
decades.
"The Fall Ball is really a testament to
Richard Powers," Chaudhry said. His commit
ment to making dance accessible, and fun a
priority, draws hundreds of students into
Roble Gym every quarter for class, Jammix or
Friday Night Waltz.
Powers, who emphasizes the social
aspects as much as the dancing, received an
undergraduate degree in engineering before
turning to dance pedagogy and history. This
dance instructor's little-known "techie" past,
Felton theorizes, results in a teaching method
that speaks to Stanford's innumerable engi
neers, scientists and students of every aca
demic background.

About a decade and a half old, the Fall
Ball is the most recent tradition to join
Stanford's social dance calendar. Its counter
parts in the winter and spring Viennese
Ball and Big Dance complete this unique
triad of events.

The quarterly balls ensure that social
dance enthusiasts on campus and in the sur
rounding community have a wealth of oppor
tunities to hone their skills and have a blast,
be they decades-long lovers of the waltz or
first time lindy-hoppers.

While Viennese Ball channels Vienna,
and Big Dance borrows from popular New
England dawn dances, the Fall Ball is all
Stanford. One notch fancier than Jammix, it
requires less formalwear than Viennese and
less stamina than the Big Dance all-nighter.
So even if you've never danced before,
Fall Ball is the perfect opportunity to put
your foot in the door, and get out on the
dance floor. Tickets for the Fall Ball are on
sale now in social dance classes and can be
purchased at the door: $l5 for students, $25
for others.

performed at last year's Fall Ball. This

come dressed however they please.
