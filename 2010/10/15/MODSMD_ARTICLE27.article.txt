TAB the Band's Adrian Perry 'O3, like
many musicians, lives on the edge.
But unlike most, the edge for the
Stanford graduate is the thin line between a
normal, nerdy childhood and his rock-star
roots; responsibility and irresponsibility; a
legal career and a rock band. Perry's life, it
seems, has always been about striking the
right chord between two worlds rather
than neglecting either, he manages to incor

porate both in a high-octane lifestyle.
Growing up with his mother in Sherman
Oaks, Calif., a suburb of Los Angeles, Perry
lived a pretty normal life normal, except
for the visits of his father, legendary

Aerosmith guitarist Joe Perry. His dad's visits
introduced him to the whirlwind of a rock
star's lifestyle.

Perry recalled one night he was taken
out to the movies by his dad and Aerosmith
lead singer Steven Tyler. "Steven was wearing
a full, onesie, red jumpsuit and a red hat with
a feather in it," he said in a phone interview.
"My dad was dressed however he dresses,
mostly shirtless, with leather. And I'm just
some kid in a baseball hat, going to the
movies with these two dudes."
It wasn't his rockstar dad, however, who
served as Perry's first musical role model.
When Perry first picked up bass around the
age of 12, he was inspired by the vibe Paul
McCartney brought to The Beatles. And once
Perry started playing, there was no looking
back.
"It became my obsession," he said. "I just
wanted to play in a band. I didn't want to be
a sideman or a producer. I wanted to play in
a band." Nevertheless, Perry always thought
he'd end up going to law school. "I had this
other side of me that was a super nerd. That's
how I got into Stanford," Perry said with a
laugh.
Once here, Perry immersed himself in
the unique music scene at Stanford. He
focused on playing in as many bands as he
could, "probably a dozen," as well as his own
band.
Beyond its music scene, Perry remem-

bers Stanford as "a very free-thinking place"
that attracts a certain kind of person, distinct
from the student who chooses Harvard or
Princeton.
"Stanford folks, in general, are very
entrepreneurial, building these really alterna
tive lifestyles," he said.
"I think Stanford in particular breeds
that type of adventurism," he added. "Part of
whatever you want to call what I'm doing
stems from [Stanford]."
After graduating from Stanford in 2003
with a B.A. and M.A. in English, Perry moved
to New York City in pursuit of "the ultimate
arts lifestyle," playing in a band and working
in the entertainment industry. With a love of
comedy writing sparked by his work at The
Chaparral, a Stanford humor magazine,
Perry picked up a job at "Saturday Night
Live." Following what Perry calls a "mixed
experience" at "SNL," he left the Big Apple
for law school, a decision which he credits
with reviving his rock and roll dreams.
"Being back at school refocused me,
took up that part of my brain that needed to
be occupied and re-sparked the creative side
and got me back on track," he said.
These days, Perry leads a kind of super
human life attorney by day, rocker by
night. Touring with TAB the Band while
working as an intellectual property law attor
ney at Weil, Goshal and Manges, a high-pow
ered, New York-based law firm, doesn't faze
Perry. While he admits that this best-of-both
worlds lifestyle can't go on forever, Perry
seems to have the balance under control for
the present.
"The more I do, the better I am, so the

crazy situation with the law firm and the
band works for me," he said. "I like having a
high-octane lifestyle."
Ultimately, Perry's childhood ambition
to just "play in a band" remains the same. He
rocks out as the frontman and bassist for
TAB the Band, along with brother Tony Perry
and friends Ben Tileston and Lou Jannety.
TAB the Band has been described as arena
rock, '6os rock and roll and rock fusion. In
Perry's words, TAB the Band is "not just one
type of band."
Though TAB the Band's first two records
were focused on '6os rock, their new album,
"Zoo Noises," expands the band's horizons
and reflects all their different influences.
"Some stuff still has that Stonesy rock vibe,"
Perry said, while other songs bring out
acoustic folk or power-rock sounds. The
band's new single, "Little Water" is "a real
Stones-on-steroids kind of song."
Perry finds his experience as a rock
musician to be different from his dad's expe
rience. When Aerosmith was starting out, it
was "a different time. There was no Internet,
very few record companies and very few gen
res of music," he said. "It was equally hard,
just for different reasons."
But with the emphasis on grassroots
advertising, today's bands have to be more
proactive in reaching their fan base.
"Aerosmith really pounded the pavement
that's why they still have such a strong fol
lowing," he said. "They built these fans one at
a time, for years, going place to place. Now
it's not the same. You have to find other ways
