Belle & Sebastian are the masters of
power pop (although The New
Pornographers might have some
thing to say about that). A band seven
strong, the strength in their music comes
from their cohesion: not one of the mem
bers outshines another, although arguably,
front man Stuart Murdoch out-fames the
others. There are no long, vain solos on a
typical Belle & Sebastian album, but plenty
of well-mixed indie pop to play on relaxing
weekends.
Their latest album, "Belle & Sebastian
Write About Love" is a decent package, in
that the music is what an audience expects
from the band, but a mediocre one in that it
is simply not as strong as some of their ear
lier efforts.
"I Didn't See It Coming" putters the
album into existence with some white noise
and a dry drum line. As far as establishing a
theme for the album, it's pretty straightfor
ward: this is typical Belle & Sebastian music,
and don't expect anything groundbreaking.
The song rests on Sarah Martin's delicate
vocals, accompanied by Murdoch and a
quivering guitar line in the background,
sounding familiarly fresh. The music is
pleasant and less sugary sweet then other
B&S songs. So far, so good.
"Come on Sister," second on the track
list, is by far the best one on the album.
Bubbly and sweet, the keyboard-led song is
all about idealization of love, but it's still,
well, fun. The keyboard sounds like a 60s
moog, a synthesizer used particularly for
disco music, and although the music does
not come off as a tribute to the era at all, it
has a vintage thing going on with the
unconventional synth line.
The title of "I Want The World To
Stop" echoes the thoughts of many a
Stanford student during finals week,
although of course, in a completely different
setting. A quick, tightly wound-up song, the

vocals are a fun call-and-response game
between Murdoch and the rest of the band.
It gets even better with the addition of clap
ping, wind instrumentation and even some
faint strings to build the exit of the song. It's
pure Belle & Sebastian perfection.
The following "Little Lou, Ugly Jack,
Prophet John" does not just feature Norah
Jones on the album, but incorporates her. A
bittersweet ballad, it sounds so much like
one of her own compositions that it cuts the
atmosphere the album was building right in
half. Although it incorporates a synth
(which is unthinkable on a Norah Jones
album), the bluesy sound is much too dis
entangled from the rest of the album and is
therefore not an asset, but a burden.
"Write About Love" tries to reassert the
classical power pop the band is known for.
Upbeat, sweet and dramatic, it features
Carey Mulligan (of Shia Leßeouf fame)
responding to Murdoch's religious two lin
ers, like "I know a way/Get on your skinny
knees and pray." The response? "Maybe not
today." Totally nailed. It does the job in wel
coming back Belle & Sebastian to their own
album.
But from there on, the album takes a
slight downward turn. Although the songs
are good, some channeling bygone-era pop
("I'm Not Living in the Real World"), some
strong on the religious theme ("Read The
Blessed Pages"), some of them slow and
mournful ("The Ghost of Rockschool"), the
guest star appearances outshine them all
and cause a rift in the listening experience.
This is Belle & Sebastian all right, but it
is not "The Life Pursuit" (2006); it is far
from their best work. This is just a new

album with the same kind of music, and the
truth is that they have done it better before.
