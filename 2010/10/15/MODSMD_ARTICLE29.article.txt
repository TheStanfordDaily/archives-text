His work has been all over the radio
for the past three years the annoy
ing-but-catchy party favorite "Right
Round," which he co-wrote with Flo Rida, the
mellow, hopeful jam "Billionaire" by Travie
McCoy and the blast-through-your-car-speak
ers summertime hit "Nothing on You" by
8.0.8. With the release of his first studio
album, "Doo-Wops & Hooligans," crooner
Bruno Mars cements his rising stardom.
Mars, a premier songwriter in the music

industry, finally brings his talent to his own
music with "Doo-Wops & Hooligans." One of
three executive producers of the album, Mars
along with the two remaining members of
his production and songwriting trio, titled
The Smeezingtons manages to create an
album that marks a foray into multiple styles
of music. The album is typified by the diverse
range of artists Mars cites as influences,
including Prince, Tupac and Elvis Presley.
True to its name, "Doo-Wops &
Hooligans" deviates from the generic pop
album and instead explores a smooth, soulful
perspective on modern music. The album
starts strong with two of its best songs up
front beginning with the heavy, thumping
ballad "Grenade," which laments a failing
romance. The track is followed by the übiqui
tous summer hit "Just the Way You Are," a
spontaneous love song a la Taylor Swiff with
enough romance to make any girl swoon, but
a catchy beat and relatable theme to attract a
male audience as well.
The album continues on to explore a few
different musical approaches. Bruno Mars,
born Peter Gene Hernandez, was raised by his
Puerto Rican and Filipino parents and spent
his entire adolescence in Hawaii, a back-

ground which lends an obvious influence to
the album. Tracks such as "The Lazy Song"
a sunny, carefree tune documenting the ideal
leisurely day and the reggae-influenced
"Liquor Store Blues," featuring Damian

Marley (son of Bob Marley) on vocals, pro-

vide a successful mix of a strong island feel
and a laid-back California vibe that typified
Mars' childhood.
At the same time, Mars brings an under
lying sensuality to "Doo-Wops & Hooligans."
Most obviously following this trend is the
R&B-influenced third track, "Our First Time,"
which includes lyrics such as "Don't it feel
good, babe?" A similar song comes in the
form of "Talking to the Moon," the most
piano-heavy, romantic track in the album, in
which Mars serenades an unknown woman
while stargazing.
Mars saves his best for last in the album.
The 10th track, "The Other Side," featuring
Cee Lo Green and 8.0.8., represents a more
philosophical approach to lyricism ("You
could die if you wanted, but baby, what for?")
and brings a satisfying fusion of a rock and
synth-dominated pop style with a soulful 60s
retro influence although that last bit could
be solely because of Cee Lo Green's singing
voice.
Despite a coherent theme, Mars misses
the mark in a few spots. "Count on Me"
comes across as nothing more than an
extremely kitschy ode to friendship, and the
sixth track, "Marry Me," is cliched enough to
include bell chimes in the chorus, falling flat
as Mars paradoxically croons, "If we wake up
and you want to break up, that's cool."
But, as a whole, "Doo-Wops &
Hooligans" is a successful album that satisfies
pop listeners looking for music a bit more
refined than bass-thumping club songs. Mars
manages to walk the tightrope between con
forming to a style and over-experimenting
while showcasing his immense talent as both a
formidable vocalist and a (generally) mean
ingful lyricist.
