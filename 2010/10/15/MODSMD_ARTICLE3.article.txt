## Stanford frosh competes for racing team spot

Julia Landauer 'l4 will compete
in the Nascar-sponsored Drive for
Diversity Testing and Evaluation
Combine this weekend in Radford,
Va., for a chance to secure a year
long spot with the Revolution Rac
ing team. It's an opportunity that
she says could "jumpstart" her pro
fessional driving career.
The event takes place over a
three-day span from Sunday to
Tuesday with the goal of identi
fying young, up-and-coming minor
ity and female drivers. Thirty-six
athletes will participate; 10 will ulti
mately be chosen to move to North
Carolina and join Revolution Rac
ing for a year. If selected, it's an
honor with far-reaching implica
tions.

"It's a huge in with Nascar," Lan
dauer said. "You're provided with
so many resources that otherwise
you'd need a lot of connections to
get. They can really open the door
for a driver."

Participants are judged not only
on their driving, but also on their
"off-track" qualities, such as their
stability and media savvy.
"They want to see how well you
speak publicly, because so much of
Nascar is how you interact with
fans," Landauer said. "They want to
make sure you're a marketable
driver."

But the racing side still matters

competitors will be put through
time trials to assess their skill levels.
That, along with their performance
away from their cars, helps decide
who gets one of the 10 coveted
spots.

"They can tell how you're adapt
ing to the track situations. You can
tell how good a driver is just by
watching them going around. If
they're smooth, if their times are
consistent.That's what they're look
ing for," Landauer said.
Revolution Racing's and by
extension, Nascar's goal is to
find and develop the "total pack
age," a female or minority driver
that can be marketed broadly. The

drivers are all assumed to be of high
quality Landauer, a champion
multiple times over in a variety of
races and series, had to apply three
times before she was finally accept
ed. To that end, the uniqueness of
each participant plays a significant
role in what is a largely subjective
competition.

"There's a big effort in
Nascar to get it to be more di
verse and not just a white
boy sport," Landauer
said.

She be
lieves that

she presents a compelling profile.
Beyond her gender, she's from New
York City and a Stanford student
