## Stanford frosh competes for racing team spot 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY MANAGING EDITOR 
Julia Landauer 'l4 will compete
in the Nascar-sponsored Drive for
Diversity Testing and Evaluation
Combine this weekend in Radford,
Va., for a chance to secure a year
long spot with the Revolution Rac
ing team. It's an opportunity that
she says could "jumpstart" her pro
fessional driving career.
The event takes place over a
three-day span from Sunday to
Tuesday with the goal of identi
fying young, up-and-coming minor
ity and female drivers. Thirty-six
athletes will participate; 10 will ulti
mately be chosen to move to North
Carolina and join Revolution Rac
ing for a year. If selected, it's an
honor with far-reaching implica
tions.

"It's a huge in with Nascar," Lan
dauer said. "You're provided with
so many resources that otherwise
you'd need a lot of connections to
get. They can really open the door
for a driver."

Participants are judged not only
on their driving, but also on their
"off-track" qualities, such as their
stability and media savvy.
"They want to see how well you
speak publicly, because so much of
Nascar is how you interact with
fans," Landauer said. "They want to
make sure you're a marketable
driver."

But the racing side still matters

competitors will be put through
time trials to assess their skill levels.
That, along with their performance
away from their cars, helps decide
who gets one of the 10 coveted
spots.

"They can tell how you're adapt
ing to the track situations. You can
tell how good a driver is just by
watching them going around. If
they're smooth, if their times are
consistent.That's what they're look
ing for," Landauer said.
Revolution Racing's and by
extension, Nascar's goal is to
find and develop the "total pack
age," a female or minority driver
that can be marketed broadly. The

drivers are all assumed to be of high
quality Landauer, a champion
multiple times over in a variety of
races and series, had to apply three
times before she was finally accept
ed. To that end, the uniqueness of
each participant plays a significant
role in what is a largely subjective
competition.

"There's a big effort in
Nascar to get it to be more di
verse and not just a white
boy sport," Landauer
said.

She be
lieves that

she presents a compelling profile.
Beyond her gender, she's from New
York City and a Stanford student

studying the applications of green
energy to the automotive industry
two qualities that coincide with cur
rent Nascar marketing plans target
ing large metropolitan areas and
"cosmopolitan" fans, Landauer said.
Indeed, even though many driv
ers reside in New York, it's rare to
find one who was actually raised in a
major city. But Landauer is from the

five boroughs and attended
Stuyvesant High School in down
town Manhattan, just blocks from
ground zero.
Her interest in racing began when
she received a go-kart for Christmas
when she was 8 years old; she drove
it around the driveway in her fami
ly's house in Newton, N.J., and from
there, her passion took off. She has
been racing for more than half of her
life, at this point, and considers her
self a professional.
As such, she puts in hours of work
per day, both for marketing and
physical fitness. To prepare for the

combine, she does extensive running
and weight training.
"People underestimate how much
endurance it takes. It gets to be about
135 degrees in the car, so if you don't
have the stamina, you're not going to
be on your A game," she said.
Landauer intends to pursue rac
ing as far as she can, and has already
planned to take one or two years off
in the middle of her Stanford career
to dedicate herself fully to her craft.
If she is selected to be part of Revo
lution Racing, she would start her
yearlong program in late March. She
plans to be enrolled for spring quar

ter, which means that she would ei
ther be forced to take classes online
or to commute between North Car
olina considered the heart of rac
ing culture and the Farm.
Although a chance to compete on
the Cup level Nascar's highest
is still years away, the importance of
landing a spot with Revolution Rac
ing is not lost on her.
"It could make your career," Lan
dauer said. "Or, for that matter,
break it."
