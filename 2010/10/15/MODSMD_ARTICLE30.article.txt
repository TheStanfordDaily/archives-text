Two years removed
from the big finan
cial collapse of
2008, documentarian
Charles Ferguson j
answers the question I
"How did it all start?" 1
Ferguson takes the grand
task upon himself and
interviews seemingly ever

CEO, economics professor and

financial advisor in the Tri-State
area. His result is a sleek, sexy and
surprisingly fun expose "Inside
Job" reveals the inner-workings of
Wall Street and the financial sector.
Divided into five distinct parts,
the audience is walked through the
history, crash and aftermath of the
recent recession. We are guided by
Matt Damon's trusting voice
through a dizzying amount of
graphs, interviews and economics
lessons. But have no fear. The film
makes sure that even if you don't get
the financial side of things perfectly,
you will at least be able to take away
the big picture: Greedy executives
caused everything, and they are not
being punished.
At the very least, this documen
tary should make you feel angry. It
will also make you think, laugh and
commiserate, but mostly you'll just
get mad. After watching the rich get
richer, the poor get poorer and a
whole slew of possibly illegal actions
in the interim, there is no way to
deny that Ferguson wants you to
dislike Wall Street executives and
their comrades. The feeling that they
are being targeted from the begin
ning doesn't shake this strong dis
like. While the executives are
Ferguson's clear victims, it is impos
sible to sympathize with them.
The hatred for these men
builds, as we first learn about ways
they cheat the system to make
money. It involves things that may
not be easily understood, but there
is no question that it is shady. After
essentially toying with derivatives
and credit default swaps, the elite

then spend their money on cocaine
and escorts, making them further
moral enemies. The last nail is ham
mered into the coffin when the
audience realizes that there has been
little recognition of their wrongdo
ings, and thus, there has been no
retribution.
Much of the humor in this doc
umentary does not come from the
events, but rather from some ridicu
lously embarrassing interviews.
Oftentimes, the interviewer asks
fairly simple and straightforward
(and maybe a little pointed) ques
tions that the interviewee stumbles
through with a series of "uhs" and
"urns," fearing his cover has finally
been blown. The fast-paced editing
makes the humor hit harder and the
facts sink deeper. The high styliza
tion throughout many of the
sequences helps to improve the flow
and understanding of the facts.
For a documentary, this proves
to be pretty standard. The filmmak
er set out with an objective, sought
it out and then is showing his well
composed results. It is tough not to
get angry, but a feeling of under
standing about what is behind the
economic facade of our country is
the reward. Even if you do not know
what a credit default swap is, or who
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are
and what they were doing in bed
together (I kid), you will still be able
to follow this poignant, timely and
necessary documentary sweeping
the rug out from Wall Street's very
screwed feet.
