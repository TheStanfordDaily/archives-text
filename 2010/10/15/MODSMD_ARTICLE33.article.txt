# Community college: Where the cool kids are

Now that you've learned the
meaning of life from the
Dalai Lama three times
over, it's time to be introduced to
the best comedy on network televi
sion: NBC's "Community." This
show averages four million viewers
on Thursdays at 8 p.m., competing
against CBS's "The Big Bang
Theory," CW's "The Vampire
Diaries" and repeats of "Grey's
Anatomy" on ABC (how anyone can
watch more than 45 minutes of
Grey's at a time is beyond my com
prehension).
That statistic was entirely new
to me until this summer, when I
came to terms with the fact that not
all of my friends were spending their
Thursday nights lusting after Jeff
(Joel McHale), looking up Abed's
(Danny Pudi) film references and
spitting rhymes in the style of Troy
(Donald Glover). Emmy-favorites
like "Modern Family" and "Glee" are
premised on fleeting conflict and
ensuing sentimentality, but no show
captures mercurial, immature col
lege-age adolescence quite like
"Community" (with the possible
exception of the heavy drinking on
"Cougar Town").

In the way that Liz Lemon and
"30 Rock" speak to us single ladies,
"Community" speaks uniquely to
the media-saturated and self
obsessed Generation Y. The premise
itself dysfunctional students who
prevented themselves from succeed
ing in the traditional college envi
ronment now united at community
college identifies the potential
pitfalls of our age bracket.
We, as Stanford students, man
aged to avoid or convert these
quirks to be just socially acceptable
enough to inspire a Common App
essay, but on "Community," we are
reminded of our possibilities: the
guy with swagger who became a
lawyer without going to college; the
wannabe hipster girl who dropped
out of high school to join the Peace
Corps; the ethnic guy who works at
his immigrant father's restaurant;
the uptight girl who went to rehab
for Adderall; the athletic guy who
lost his football scholarship (I'm
leaving out the two distinctly adult
figures, the single mom and the for
mer moist towelette tycoon).
These are the stories of our past
and our avoided present. With the
show's second season, however,

these character profiles have become
relics of the past, of a series uncer
tain of its relationships to stereo
types. Fortunately, it has chosen to
reinvent them.

The show's creator, Dan
Harmon, and his talented staff of
writers (many of them female!) have
accomplished this by blending
tropes of the school setting with
film genre frameworks and general
irreverence. Take, for example, one

of my favorite episodes from season
one, "Contemporary American
Poultry:" a parody of "Goodfellas"
in which the gang corners the cafe
teria's chicken tender market

(usurping the position of fry cook
from one of the more absurd fea

tured characters, Starburns) and
combusts as the individual members
make power grabs. I'm shocked to
see that that episode was the only
one to draw fewer than four million
viewers last season.
The first season's most famous
episode, "Modern Warfare," which
drew a standing ovation at Comic-
Con 2010, designs a school-wide
paintball competition in the style of
"Die Hard," balancing student group
stereotypes (the Glee club haunts
competitors with a pun-tastic a cap
pella rendition of "Hit Me With
Your Best Shot") and emotional
character development (Jeff and


"COMMUNITY" CAST, COURTESY NBC
Britta do it on a library table ...
classier than a Green library cubicle,
I suppose).
There's something undeniably
likable about this show's silliness
and originality. It exhibits self
awareness and dares to improve (a
lesson "Glee" could learn), and it has
a genuine underdog quality what
other show can say that its creator's
Twitter muses openly about the e
mails he wished he had sent to the

network and rants that his followers
should "WATCH BIG BANG THE
ORY ALREADY." The willingness to
break the fourth wall, a la, dare I say
it, "Arrested Development," and abil
ity to preach truisms about our cul
ture "I don't have an ego; my
Facebook profile picture is a land
scape" situates it squarely
between "30 Rock" and "Modern
Family." What's not to love? This
show is hardly predictable, so I

won't bore you with my theories
about Jeff/Britta or my obsession
with Ken Jeong. I will, however, dis
close that, come Friday mornings,
the first show I watch is this one. If
that's not a reason to nominate this
show for every Emmy ever, I don't
know what is.
