## Fast food salads at Sprout Cafe

Sprout Cafe's name is an allu
sion to its mission of provid
ing healthy food, fast.
Sprouts, the vegetable, can mature
from seed to salad in about a week,
and they are among the most nutri
tious foods available. There is a

very wide range of sprouts, from
the alfalfa sprouts most people are
familiar with on their turkey sand
wich to the bean sprouts you heap
onto your Vietnamese pho. In these
aspects, Sprout Cafe is somewhat
able to live up to its name and pro
vide a variety of relatively healthy
foods in quick fashion.

The restaurant has the modern
vibe that characterizes Silicon

Valley health-conscious and eco
friendly while still clean and effi
cient. Sprout is best considered a
lunch destination built for those
that have long enough to get out
for lunch but aren't in a siesta
mindset.

Sprout's main attraction is the
custom salad bar that allows diners
to craft a salad from a wide variety
of ingredients. Of course a custom
salad cannot be reviewed, but it is
noteworthy that while there are
tons of options to mix in, few are
markedly exotic; they don't even
offer a particularly wide selection

of sprouts.
The pre-selected "signature"
choices seem to fall a bit short on
the taste or health dimension (or
both). The biggest offender is the
"Steakhouse," where there is only a
marginal resemblance to a salad at
best. Similarly, the somen salad is
overwhelmed by the amount of

somen noodles, making the dish
feel very little like a salad and more
like a bowl of noodles that lack fla
vor. The pepper-crusted ahi tuna
that comes with the Nicoise is the

only thing that can be remembered
about this otherwise completely
unimaginative and bland salad. Of
the salads tasted, only the
"Farmhouse" comes through with a
satisfying amount of flavor while
still feeling like a salad.
The sandwich side of Sprout's
menu does not entirely align with

its mission of healthy food, but
there are certainly some tasty
options. The chipotle sandwich has
barely any real spice, but the fonti
na cheese is layered on in the per
fect proportion to give the sand
wich a great taste without com
pletely betraying the healthy con
cept. The portabella sandwich is a
bit bread-heavy relative to its con
tents, but overall was delectable; the
sandwich is pleasantly reminiscent
of mushroom pizza.
Oddly, perhaps Sprout's best
dish is not a salad or sandwich but
a soup. The curry red lentil soup is
a fantastic mix of quinoa and
chickpeas in a mildly spicy lentil
broth. The soup is packed with fla
vor without being too salty and,
while a bit out of place thematical
