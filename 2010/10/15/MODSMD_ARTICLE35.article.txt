## ROXY SASS Roxy Sass samples the academic departments 
### â€“ roxy SASS contact roxy: intermission@stanforddaily. com 
It took Roxy a long time to settle
on a major while at Stanford
not because she didn't always
know she wanted to be an English
major (have you read "Lady
Chatterley's Lover?"), but because
she couldn't get enough of academ
ic exploration in all departments.
The adventurous Roxy knows that
a little variety keeps one on their
toes, and there's no better way to
sample the Stanford smorgasbord
than by taking a few classes for a
more personal examination of
departmental specimens.
Computer science
Roxy's never been one to turn away
an invitation to a lair. While the
programming types may face a rep
utation for less-than-ample game,
Roxy's here to educate the masses.
Those all-night hack-a-thons are a
workout for mind and body, and
for those interested in an MRS
degree, a Stanford CS degree is an
investment in the future. Your con
versations can be a nice mix of
nerdy talk and dirty talk. Plus,
Roxy's always interested in learning
more about your Python ... code.
Religious studies
While perhaps shy at first, a few
rounds of confession later, these
scholars are teaching Roxy all the
ways to sin in every religion a
very comprehensive review. As a
classy lady, Roxy will skip the

mandatory "missionary position"
pun here, but has secretly always
wanted to learn about shrines and
temples you know, since there
are so many already built to her.

Feminist studies
A whole major based on Roxy's
gender? Sweet. Roxy's intrigued by
the thought of a feminist studies

major who can appreciate a woman
in charge. And after years of study,
these students offer Roxy a chance
to roughhouse with someone who
knows her better than she knows
herself.

Human biology
In no other department can you
spend weeks and weeks talking
about the raw impulses that drive
human sexual behavior Roxy's
favorite pastime, masquerading as
academia. And evo-psych creates a
lot of convenient excuses for a bit
of sexual exploration (hey, our
ancestors did it too!). Plus, these
students may one day become
Roxy's own McDreamy, and really,
who doesn't love sexy doctors?
Post-doctoral fellows
Roxy hears you've got Ph.D.s. Can
you confirm?
