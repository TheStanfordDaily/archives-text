## Leader meets off campus with Stanford students Tells younger generation to think 'more wisely' 
### DEVIN BANERJEE SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Fang Zheng was 22 years old
when a Chinese tank ran over his
legs. It was 1989, and he was one of
tens of thousands of protesters in
Tiananmen Square rallying against
the government's repressive policies.
On Thursday afternoon, in a
quiet, shady courtyard of the Stan
ford Park Hotel in Menlo Park,
Zheng rolled his wheelchair up to a
microphone to ask Tenzin Gyatso,
the 14th Dalai Lama, what the
prospects of democracy are in the
country where Zheng lived for four
decades. Leaning forward in a red
and gold chair, the Dalai Lama lis
tened closely, furrowed his brow
and then replied: "I myself hope to
return to Beijing. But right now I
cannot."

In a rare private event during his
four days in the Bay Area, the 75-
year-old leader of Tibet met with
Chinese and Tibetan students and
scholars after giving two public lec
tures at Stanford the same day. For
70 minutes he spoke on the current
state of China, Tibet and India, in
tertwining the lessons of human
compassion and religious harmony
that won him the Nobel Peace Prize
in 1989 and made him one of the
most recognizable figures in the
world.

Greeting a group of Chinese col
lege students from Stanford and
UC-Berkeley in the front row with
a traditional Chinese "ni hao"
greeting, the Dalai Lama immedi
ately launched into an assessment
of China's current political and so
cial state.

"After 60 years, there is no civil
war or external threat to China," he
said. "But they have kept certain
habits from the time when there
was threat: suppression, censorship
and too much control."

Chinese censorship, particularly
on the Web, has clouded the coun
try's reputation this year, especially

after Internet giant Google tem
porarily yanked its search engine
from China-based servers in
March, when it was found that Chi
nese hackers had attacked Google
and other U.S. technology compa
nies. The Chinese media is also
heavily censored by the govern
ment.

"One point three billion people
have the right to know the reality
and to judge for themselves what's
right and what's wrong," the Dalai
Lama said. "Therefore the censor
ship is immoral. It's self-destruc
tive."

Censorship is just one part of the
trust deficit that China has created,
the Dalai Lama said. He compared
China to India, saying both suffer
from heavy corruption but India is
trusted by the international com
munity because its democratic val
ues highlight individual freedom
while China's domestic policies en
courage suppression.

"Individual creativity of diverse
people is very necessary," he said.
"Look at India. For the last 60 years,
there has been accountability be
cause of democracy, rule of law and
freedom of information. And there
is secularism in the government

which does not mean rejection of
religion, but means respect for all
religions."

China's trust deficit is a hin
drance to talks between Tibet and
the Chinese government over
Tibet's autonomy. The Dalai Lama
called the tension "man-made" and
said it can "easily be solved" if the
Chinese government understands
that Tibet is not seeking separation
or independence, but instead
"meaningful autonomy" of gover
nance.

"Sooner or later we have to talk
to the Chinese government," the
Dalai Lama said. "It has to be un
derstood that we are not seeking
separation. We are not seeking in
dependence. We are seeking mean
ingful autonomy."

Independence would refer to a
Tibet that governs itself at every
level without China's hand, while
autonomy would refer to a Tibet

that governs its internal affairs but
gives international and military de
cision-making power to China.
Speaking to the group of Chinese
students in attendance, the Dalai
Lama said, "You are the people who
will create this century. Please think
more wisely." He described groups
of Chinese students who protest his
visits to the U.S. with "too much
emotion, too much anger."
"They never listen to my expla
nation," he said. "Good thing I sit at
a big table, otherwise they would
reach over and ..." He made
swinging motions with his fists.
At 75 years old, the Dalai Lama
said he is looking toward "complete
retirement." He now devotes him
self to two main commitments: pro
moting human values through secu
lar paths and promoting religious
harmony.

"The future belongs to people,
not necessarily governments," he
said. "Basically all people want a
happy life. Everyone must have a
right to pursue that goal."
The private meeting was organ
ized by Tenzin Seldon 'l2, who
made news earlier this year when it
was found that her private Google
e-mail account was hacked by
someone with a Chinese IP address.
Seldon, who was born and raised in
Tibet but fled to India with her par
ents, is a regional coordinator of the
New York-based nonprofit Stu
dents for a Free Tibet. She worked
for one of the Dalai Lama's non
profit organizations in India over
the summer, where she had the op
portunity to meet the Dalai Lama
and ask him to speak with Chinese
and Tibetan students on his visit to
the Bay Area.

"What struck me the most was
how knowledgeable His Holiness
was about the intricacies of China,"
she said after the event. "It's quite
an undertaking for a spiritual per
son to be on the level where he can
talk about political and economic
implications. This relates directly to
what I went through."
