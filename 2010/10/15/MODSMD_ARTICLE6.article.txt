## When Muggle Meets Magic stanford's fLedgLing quidditch team brings students closer to the world of rowLing's famous series 
### HELEN ANDERSON 
There seems to be a good chance that Stewart
Macgregor-Dennis 'l3 attended Hogwarts.
Even though he spent his first five years in Eng
land, he's from Edinburgh, where J.K. Rowling
wrote the best-selling Harry Potter series. And
this year, he's bringing the sport of Quidditch to Stanford.
"It's in my blood," he said, referring to how his Scottish
roots connect him to the series. "Although I'm still a Mug
gle."
His idea to start a Quidditch team was sparked by that
Stanford staple: rivalry across the Bay.
"I watched a You Tube video over the summer...
about Berkeley's Quidditch team, and they spent the ma
jority of it talking about... how they wanted to beat Stan
ford's Quidditch team," which didn't exist at the time,
Macgregor-Dennis said. "So, like any self-respecting
Harry Potter fan who goes to Stanford, I felt like it was my
duty to form the Stanford Quidditch team."
Collegiate Quidditch has its roots in Vermont, where
Middlebury College formed an intramural league in 2005,
which eventually grew into the International Quidditch
Association (IQA). Each year, the IQA hosts a "Quid
ditch World Cup," which, last year, featured 21 teams. This
year, over 50 teams are expected to attend the event in
New York City.

Although the IQA has developed rules for collegiate
Quidditch, teams sometimes create rules on their own
terms. For example, Macgregor-Dennis has been in con

tact with UC-Berkeley's team about making rules for their
upcoming game. The main challenges are converting the
magical aspects of the sport to real-world possibilities.
"The largest handicap that we have is that none of our
members can fly," Macgregor-Dennis saaid. "In terms of
equipment, we're looking at the moment for broomsticks
and capes. Preferably we're looking for shorter broom
sticks for more maneuverability."
A volleyball will be used to represent the Quaffle, while
the Bludgers will be dodgeballs. Elula hoops will become
the goalposts. But probably the most bizarre aspect of
Muggle Quidditch is the Snitch, originally a tiny flying ball
that must be caught to end the game.
"[The Seeker] is a person with a tennis ball in a sock
tied to their waist," said Natalie Stumpf 'l3, another mem
ber of the founding team. She got involved after receiving
an intriguing e-mail; however, she has had a longtime in
terest in Harry Potter.
"I took a class last year which was about folklore, and I
actually wrote a paper about Harry Potter," Stumpf said.
So when she got an e-mail from Macgregor-Dennis about
the new team, she knew she couldn't resist.
Stumpf and Macgregor-Dennis were both inspired by
separate encounters with the renowned author herself.
"When I was 10,1 went to a book signing with J.K.
Rowling," Stumpf said. "She waved at me, and it was just
incredible."
Macgregor-Dennis saw Rowling when he attended one
of her talks, which he described as "probably the greatest
moment of my existence."
Their excitement about Rowling is reflected in the zeal
with which they have gone about making Muggle Quid
ditch a reality on campus.
So far, Macgregor-Dennis, Stumpf and their fellow
team members, which together make a group of six, are fo
cusing on a single upcoming game against Cal's team. The
match will take place on Nov. 13, the Sunday before Big
Game, at UC-Berkeley.
"We're a little behind in that we're freshly formed,"
Macgregor-Dennis said. "We believe [Berkeley's Quid
ditch team] formed last year, so they have a little bit more
familiarity with the rules of the game."
If this game goes well, the team might branch out and
try to play teams from other schools. First, though, Mac

gregor-Dennis and Stumpf need more players to round
out their team. There are seven people from each Quid
ditch team on the field at one time, but ideally the team
will comprise at least 10 members.
"We're actively seeking new members," Macgregor-
Dennis said. "There's no prior experience or magical
powers necessary. The main challenge has just been
alerting people of it, finding the Harry Potter fans [at
Stanford] that clearly exist and would be very keen
about the game."
Finding Quidditch players is difficult, he said, simply
because the sport is still new and not yet well-known.
Although the idea of Quidditch as a professional sport
might currently seem far-fetched, Macgregor-Dennis sees
it as a distinct possibility. He cites rugby as an example; in
the United States, it started off in the 1800s just as a sport
played at colleges, and it only truly became a professional
sport in 1995.
"It might well take Quidditch a couple centuries to get
to the standing of professional sport," Macgregor-Dennis
said. "But I think the people who are involved in it think
that it will."
"Hopefully, one day, children will spend their day on
the Quidditch field," he added.
Because of the diversity of the positions on a Quidditch
team and the variety of skill needed for those positions, the
ideal professional Quidditch player would be an all
around athlete.
"You probably also need good field awareness; you
need to have a good game-mind," Macgregor-Dennis said.
Until that day comes, though, he can be satisfied with
the exciting prospects for Quidditch right here in the Stan
ford bubble.
"I think Quidditch is a sport with a lot of camaraderie,"
Macgregor-Dennis said, comparing the spirit to the likes
of the Leland Stanford Marching Band.
Stumpf said she is drawn to the creativity of the endeav
or.
"I just think it's really cool that people have taken
something that's in this book, and that sounds so incredi
bly fantastical, and made it into something you can actual
ly do," she said.
