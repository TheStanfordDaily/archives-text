## Superfund effects linger after 30 years 
### PATRICIA HO 
Despite ongoing clean-up ef
forts, contamination from a 30-
year-old groundwater leak contin
ues to affect Stanford Research
Park, according to a water quality
report released Sept. 30.
According to the report re
leased by the California Regional
Water Quality Control Board
(RWQCB) of the San Francisco
Bay Area Region, soil investiga
tions began in 1981 after a "leaking
1,000 gallon underground storage
tank" was found at the Hewlett-
Packard (HP) Superfund Site at
620-640 Page Mill Rd. in Palo Alto.
The leak released toxic chemicals
and volatile organic compounds
into the surrounding groundwater,
affecting nearby sites such as the
Stanford Research Park, Fry's
Electronics, the Mayfield soccer
complex and the Palo Alto court
house.
In response, HP began a seven
month groundwater extraction and
treatment process in 1982, which
was restarted in 1987 and expanded
in 1988,1992 and 1996.
According to Ken Torke, Envi
ronmental Control Programs man
ager for environmental compliance
for the city of Palo Alto, the
RWQCB has issued HP a permit to
discharge the contaminated
groundwater into nearby creeks
after treatment.

"It's a large plume [a term for
contaminated water] that covers
several areas, so we have intermit
tent discharges from people, usual
ly in conjunction with a single
building," Torke said.
RWQCB has had oversight of
the clean-up efforts of HP, a
ground-lease tenant on Stanford
land, since 1986 after identifying it
as the responsible party for the
contamination.

"The RWQCB required HP to
investigate and remediate the con
tamination, and HP has been com
plying with the order," wrote
Tiffany Griego, director of asset
management at Stanford Research
Park, in an e-mail to The Daily.
"[HP], as well as other entities
within the Stanford Research Park,
continue to meet all of their obliga
tions required by Cleanup and
Abatement Orders from the regu
latory agencies."
Stanford has been monitoring

overall clean-up and cooperating
with the RWQCB to ensure over
sight by "reviewing all environ
mental reports and providing tech
nical comments to the RWQCB,
HP and HP's environmental con
sultants to hold them accountable,"
Griego said.

Additionally, Stanford will sug
gest preventative methods to prop
erty tenants and lessees if neces
sary including underground sys
tems meant to decrease contamina
tion. To pre vent similar problems in
the future, Stanford asks its lessees
and tenants in modern lease con
tracts to remediate their properties
in order to preserve Stanford land.
"We [ask] our lessees or tenants
to provide annual reports of mate
rials they use in their business oper
ations and proof they comply with
applicable law and licensing re
quirements to use such materials,"
Griego said. "We have the right to
conduct inspections to ensure they
are complying with law."
Lessees must maintain land at
conditions that allow for future res
idential uses. To determine the po
tential for danger, Stanford em
ploys objective measures to ensure
clean-up standards set by regulato
ry agencies in applicable laws and
codes are met.
"Our role is to serve as a check
and balance on our lessee to ensure
their compliance with law and with
what the agencies say they must
do," Griego said.

trol Plant and HP representatives
