## EDITORIAL Concerns of first-generation students must remain a priority 
### 
This editorial originally ran on Oct. 1,2010.

Stanford's commitment to financial aid
and diversity has attracted students
from many backgrounds to apply for
admission. However, students can attest: the
story doesn't end at admission. After the
long, grueling application process, surviving
rigorous Stanford academics is yet another
battle. Though all admits are claimed as the
best and brightest, certain students tend to
fare better than others.
Background has proved to play an im
portant role in a student's ability to do well
in college. In the past, students and faculty
alike have argued that admits of different
backgrounds would need different re
sources. As a result, community centers
emerged over several decades to support
these students, ranging from the Black Com
munity Services Center (BCSC) and El
Centra Chicano to the Native American
Community Center (NACC) and the Asian
American Activities Center (A3C).
However, while there are ample re
sources for students of color, Stanford has
long overlooked the role that socioeconom
ic status or class play in a student's develop
ment in a college setting.
The editorial board supports the Office
of the Vice Provost for Student Affairs' ef
fort to include socioeconomic differences in
the diversity discussion. The office is search
ing for a new associate dean and director of
diversity and first-generation programs, a
hire that will help more students navigate
their Stanford experiences. The position re
places a similar one cut in 2009 over budget
concerns. An anonymous donor has come
forward to fund the new position for five
years.
Issues of socioeconomic status are often
thrown into the same messy pile as issues of
race. While both affect students' college ex
periences, socioeconomic levels have a dif
ferent effect than race. Although ethnic
community centers are sufficient for help
ing students bridge academic and social
gaps, people often overlook the fact that so
cioeconomic status transcends racial
boundaries.
At first glance, African-Americans and
Africans appear to be "covered" by the

BCSC, the Latino community by El Centra
Chicano, the Native Americans by the
NACC and Asians-Americans by the A3C.
It is easy to conclude that the only minority
group that the new dean would be helping
are socioeconomically disadvantaged Cau
casians.
But issues of class and race do not inter
mingle so clearly.
The creation of the dean's position marks
Stanford's acknowledgement that rifts be
yond race exist in the overall Stanford com
munity. First-generation and low-income
students need to overcome many issues that
don't necessarily have anything to do with
race.
A production by STAMP, the social
protest theatre company, in spring 2010
brought to light such challenges. Soliciting
monologues from anonymous students
from the first-generation and low-income
communities, the play "Wealth of Words"
highlighted the challenges that these stu
dents face when trying to fit in with their
peers. The script included horror stories
ranging from discriminatory remarks made
in IHUM discussions about the poor to the
hesitation of taking unpaid internships be
cause of financial difficulties to the frustra
tion of lacking parental connections because
of their first-generation status. These are
only some examples of unique obstacles
that first-generation and low-income stu
dents deal with.
The population of low-income and first
generation students is also growing, possibly
due to recent financial aid initiatives. Ac
cording to Dean of Admission Richard
Shaw, 15.2 percent of Stanford undergradu
ates are first-generation. Additionally, 14
percent of undergraduates in 2008-2009 re
ceived a federal Pell Grant, which is often
used as a standard for assessing low-income
status.
Stanford is making important strides to
ward improving the undergraduate experi
ence with the creation of the associate dean
and director of diversity and first-genera
tion job. He or she will be an invaluable re
source. If we wish to continue to uphold the
founding mission of the University, the con
cerns of first-generation students must re
main a priority.
