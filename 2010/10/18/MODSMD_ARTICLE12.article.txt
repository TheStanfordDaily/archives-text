## The 						Nature of Work 
### Aaditya Shidham 
Ask yourself, right now, what the word
"work" means to you. What images
come to your mind? Is it a carpenter
adding a last layer of polish to his newly de
signed table? Is it an overworked law stu
dent, with bags under her eyes and profani
ties under her breath? Is it a mathematician,
shivering with awe at what he has proven?
One image cannot seem to stand alone here:
work is not always mental or physical labor,
nor is it always the fulfillment gained by hav
ing done something well. If it were always the
former, there would be no such thing as job
satisfaction. And if it were always the latter,
then our sense of accomplishment would be
dangerously low. For me, work has always
been a packaging of the labor that tests your
endurance and the feeling of pleasure that
comes after. This definition of work is unro
mantic and saps energy from your day.
Nonetheless, it is practical, and it makes
sense for most college students. We don't all
love the classes we take, but we do our best in
each of them, and the ones that we love hope
fully give us insights into our career and our
future lives. Fair, yes?
No. Not fair. Not fair at all.

I learned just how wrong I was in my def
inition of work a few months ago, when I met
a college senior let's call her Sara who
was terminally ill, suffering from pancreatic
cancer. Yet she was determined to graduate
with honors in mathematics, while waitress
ing on the side to pay for her tuition and
doing research in theoretical physics. In our
conversation, she smiled at me through
bloodshot eyes, buried in a mountain of pa
perwork in a cubicle-sized dorm room. Her
skin was yellow and frail, but her eyes shone
with an intensity that I had rarely witnessed.
As she went through the story of the discov
ery of her cancer, she told me of her denial,
her anger and finally her acceptance of her
condition. As a dying woman, she defined her

college experience in a new way. There was
no time to waver when it came to her aca
demic choices: she could no longer justify
taking classes just because they might have
long-term value. She had deep conversations
with her professors from day one, read aca
demic papers with an unmatched intensity
and discovered the intellectual and personal
loves of her life. For her, there was no current
sacrifice of happiness for a larger, undefined,
unexpected goal. She didn't waddle between
alleys of thought and intern at places she did
n't understand or appreciate in the hope of a

letter of recommendation. She focused her
attention on something she truly loved. She
studied like an Olympic athlete practices his
or her sport. In short, she lived life in the face
of death.
I think many of us at Stanford are too se
cure about our own mortality. We bathe in
passing time as if it is never-ending. I have
been guilty of the very same being a triv
ial student at times, asking petty questions of
professors and worrying about the exam
more than the knowledge itself because this
class isn't the most important thing in my life.
I still find myself using cheap high school
gimmicks that have no place at a university
like Stanford. Yet the urgency of meaningful
work can define someone just as deeply as a
lifelong love can. Sara has done this for me
she has allowed me to move my definitions of
work from an outer to an inner reality. Sara
couldn't allow her work to be anything she
didn't love. For her, work was not endurance
for a sense of satisfaction. No work was
her satisfaction.
I think many of us hope we view our "ac
tual jobs" this way. Yet we put off this expec
tation of work until after we graduate and
enter the industry or the job market. But isn't
our job currently "student"? Are we living
our adult lives right now? In Sara's case, it
was the urgency of her mortality that led her
to this redefinition. But in our case, she can
lead by example.
I found recently that Sara passed away the
same day that Benoit Mandelbrot did. It
seems fitting for the universe to regard the
two in the same breath. If you can read news
papers in heaven, Sara, know this: your life
and your death has touched more than
just those you know.
