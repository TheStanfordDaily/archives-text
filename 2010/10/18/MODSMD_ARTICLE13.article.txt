# THE
						TRANSITIVE PROPERTY
## The
						Pros and Cons of Passing 
### Cristopher Bautista 
I had my first testosterone injection last
Wednesday. During the weekend before, I
had to pick up my prescription (it's weird
how my manhood comes from a teeny little
bottle that I get from CVS), and then bring it
to Vaden for the injection. It was a rather an
ticlimactic affair. Within half an hour, the doc
tor poked a needle into my arm and before I
knew it, it was done. I still felt like the same
awkward Filipino boy who likes comic books.
The only change that would happen, I felt,
was that I'd talk with a bit of a deeper voice
when I proclaimed my love for Batman.
But it hit me a little while afterward. I real
ized I will look normal I will pass as a regu
lar guy for the first time ever. Transgender
men are probably the luckiest queer people in
that once they've gone through the physical
transition, they can blend into the general
population (which is why it's so hard to keep
track of how many FtMs there are. It's just so
hard to tell the difference). In other words, I
can live a normal, safe life, relatively free of,
you know, getting beaten up, shot at, laughed
at, discriminated against, so on and so forth. I
will finally be in a position in which everyone
I meet will assume right away I'm a bio-guy,
and treat me as such. It is a prospect that is
strange, exciting and frightening.
I realize that when the effects of testos
terone kick in, I will look less queer than be
fore. I will straddle both the queer and
straight world, and even have the choice of
leaving the queer community behind
something that a portion of transmen do after
physically transitioning. But the queer com
munity is something I do not want to aban
don. From my experience, the Stanford queer
community has been wonderfully accepting.
When I'm hanging out at Terra for Happy
Hour, or at the LGBT Center, I don't have to
worry about presenting as "man enough."
Hell, I could love Lady Gaga and football and
no one will judge me. Not to mention I have
also met so many awesome people I don't

think I would have been exposed to so much
diversity if it were not for my involvement in
the Stanford LGBTQ community. Many of
my close friends are queer. There's just a con
nection between my queer friends and me
that just isn't present with other friendships.
There's a mutual understanding, a freedom to
talk about things, an unconditional accept
ance. I don't have to prove or explain any
thing to my queer friends. And last Wednes
day's vigil for recent LGBTQ youth suicides
was one of the most powerful moments I have
experienced during my undergrad career.The
queer community is part of me, and will al
ways be part of me, no matter how I look.
As a pre-testosterone man, I always appre
ciated my physical appearance because it ges

tured toward the more complicated aspects of
my identity. The phrase "born in the wrong
body" is a bit problematic to me. Earlier in my
transition I did identify with this phrase, and
felt generally bitter about this whole cosmic
prank of my body and mind not matching up,
but as I grew, I realized that my life experi
ence has actually been a bit of a gift. By living
as a female, I understood the female perspec
tive, and through this life experience I real
ized how important it is to respect women,
and how it is important to fight for women's
rights (I swear, if all men were required to live
as women for at least some portion of their
lives, the world would be a whole lot better). I
am ardently feminist, and I owe my female ex
perience to this identification.
I like manly things, like ties, steak and
Guinness beer. I've had the biggest crush on
Emma Watson since the sixth grade, and I
have a Jessica Alba poster proudly displayed
in my room. However, I also have some traits
that you could deem as stereotypically gay
I worship Lady Gaga and religiously watch
Glee, and my door is literally draped in rain
bow paraphernalia. And for some unex
plained reason or another I've recently devel
oped an obsession with Zac Efron, Andrew
Garfield and any other men with fabulous
hair. I'm a feminine guy, and proud of it.
Looking more "normal," though convenient
and more resonant to how I picture myself in
my mind, has made me realize that maybe
"fitting in" with everyone else is not some
thing I want to do.
The other day my throat was a bit sore I
thought with a twinge of excitement that the T
was kicking in, until I realized that I live in a
freshman dorm, and during fall quarter fresh
man dorms are bastions of disease and sore
throats. False alarm. But I'll keep you posted,
Stanford. Thanks for keeping up with me.

Next week: Cristopher bitches about relation
ships. E-mail him at cmsb@stanford.edu.

I had my first
testosterone
injection last
Wednesday.
