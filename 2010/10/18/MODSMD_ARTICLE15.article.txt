## DAWGS IN THE DUST Card beats Huskies in four-set thriller, also tops Wazzu 
### KATHERINE KNOX CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Cardinal senior outside hitter
Alix Klineman led her team to con
secutive victories over No. 7 Wash
ington (15-3, 4-3 Pac-10) and Wash
ington State (6-11, 0-7) this past
weekend. The No. 2 Stanford
women's volleyball team (16-1, 7-1)
continues to share the lead of the
Pac-10 as it nears the midpoint of
conference play.
The Huskies Stanford's long
time rival and biggest competitor in
recent years brought in the Cardi
nal's largest crowd of the season on
Friday night. The teams split matches
last season and nearly shared the
Pac-10 title before the Huskies
dropped their last match to give
Stanford the crown.
Stanford took the rivalry match in
a four-set thriller, 24-26,25-17,25-16,
32-30.
Impeccable serve-receive passing
and defense by Stanford senior
libero Gabi Ailes and Washington
libera Jenna Orlandini allowed both
teams variety with their sets, yielding
long rallies in the first set. Eventually
back-to-back missed serves by the
Cardinal gave Washington the mo
mentum to successfully deliver to its
primary hitters seniors Kindra
Carlson and Becky Perry whose
offense brought the Huskies the set,
26-24.
Washington's strategy to attack
the right back defenders in the sec
ond set was futile. From the right
back position, Cardinal freshman de
fensive specialist Mary Ellen Luck
put together a career-high 10 digs on
the night to patch up the weakness of
Stanford's new 5-1 setting formation.
Nonetheless, senior setter Cassidy
Lichtman spread the Stanford of
fense from pin to pin, effectively in
corporating oft-underused sopho
more opposite Hayley Spelman.

Spelman's 17 kills exposed holes in
the Husky block while balancing the
court opposite Klineman, allowing
the Cardinal to gather an eight-point
lead that would determine the sec
ond set in Stanford's favor, 25-17.
Husky setter Jenna Hagglund
who, like Klineman, has been nomi
nated for the national Lowe's Senior
CLASS Award kept her team in
contention early on in the third with
astute set distribution.
"They spread out their offense
which made them very hard to de
fend," Spelman said.
The fast tempo of play ruled the
rallies, yet 11 combined kills by
Klineman, Spelman and redshirt jun
ior Stephanie Browne brought Stan
ford a decisive lead.
Washington's five-point deficit was
precipitated by contributions from
Cardinal freshmen Luck and outside
hitter Rachel Williams, who added an
ace and a kill, respectively. Stanford
cruised to a decisive 25-16 victory.

One would think that the eight
kills posted by Washington's Perry
would bring the Huskies the win in
the fourth, but the story revolved
around Klineman, who led her team
to a 32-30 victory with 15 kills in the
fourth set alone, earning Stanford
the match.
"[Perry] had a great match," Spel
man said, "but we adjusted defen
sively, minimized our errors, and hit
deep on them from all positions,
which worked really well."
"We prepared more for Washing
ton [scouting-wise] than we have for
any other team this season and it re
ally showed on the court," Klineman
added.
Both players attributed the victo
ry largely to strategic preparation,
both on and off the court, rather than
the spirit of the match itself. Never
theless, the atmosphere in Maples
Pavilion contributed to Stanford's
success.
"The wonderful support from
over 4,000 fans in Maples added spir
it to the match and made it a great ex
perience overall," Spelman said.
Following the battle with the
Huskies, the Cardinal took down
Washington State on Saturday night
in an uneventful three-set sweep, 25-
13, 25-15, 25-10, to round out the
weekend.
The match gave Stanford head
coach John Dunning the opportunity
to allow non-starters to contribute to
the team's success. Redshirt sopho
more middle blocker Jessica Walker
joined the starting lineup, delivering
six kills on 11 swings to hit .455 for
the night. Freshman outside hitter
Sam Wopat earned a career-high five
kills, leading the Cardinal with a .625
hitting percentage.
Ailes picked up 19 digs to help
hold the Cougars to a .064 hitting
percentage on the match. After the
