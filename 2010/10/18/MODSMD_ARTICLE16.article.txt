# My Bowl Championship Series predictions
## 
### Daniel Bohm 
Can we all take a second to
gives thanks for Ohio
State's loss Saturday? Re
ally though, now we all
won't be forced to watch
the perennially overrated Buckeyes
get rolled in the BCS National Cham
pionship Game, simply because they
were ranked highly in preseason polls.
Even with their own loss, Nebras
ka falling to Texas and Nevada drop

ping one to Hawaii, there are still 10
undefeated teams left in college foot
ball. I don't know how true this is, but
that sure seems like a lot of perfect
teams for this late in the season. The
question now is who will be left stand
ing to play for the title? What if there
are more than two undefeated
teams? Will we have to hear more
anger targeted at the much-maligned
Bowl Championship Series?

Well, everyone enjoys predictions,
so I'm going to go ahead and make
some.
1. Oregon will go undefeated and
play for the national title ... against
Boise State. I'm not saying this be
cause it is what I think should happen
I don't believe Boise State is one of
the two best teams in America, but no
one left on their schedule can beat the
Broncos. Oregon has some chal

lenges a trip to USC, a home date
with Arizona and of course the Civil
War in Corvallis.
2. That prediction is predicated on
the fact that the nation's best confer
ence the SEC will not send a
team to the championship game. Es
sentially the teams will beat each
other up so no one goes undefeated.
The conference's two unbeaten
teams Auburn and LSU play

each other next week. There is no
way LSU will go undefeated with the
Mad Hatter, Les Miles, running the
show. Eventually his luck will run
out. Auburn, on the other hand, may

enter the final weekend of the season
without a blemish, but the Iron Bowl
is at Alabama this year, and the Crim
son Tide would like nothing more
than to ruin Auburn's shot at the
championship.
3. Multiple undefeated teams will
miss out on the national title game.
Oklahoma could end up perfect,
which would mean the Sooners would
hand Oklahoma State and Missouri
(who are currently undefeated) losses
along the way. The same goes forTCU,
whose only remaining challenge is a
date with fellow unbeaten Utah. The
winner of that game, which I believe
will be the Horned Frogs, could be
locked out of the BCS title game
along with Oklahoma. Michigan State

could also finish perfect, but that
would likely mean a trip to the Rose
Bowl for them. (That could be a date
with Stanford if the Oregon-Boise
State championship game holds up).
4. That brings me to this predic
tion: Stanford will play in the Rose
Bowl. This may be Stanford's only
shot at a BCS bowl because it is un
likely to be selected as an at-large
BCS team because of its lackluster
fan support (see many of my previ
ous columns for further explanation
of this phenomenon). In order for
Stanford to go to the Rose Bowl, not
only would it likely have to win out,
but it also needs Oregon to go to the
championship game and play a team
from a non-automatic qualifying
conference (basically Boise State,
TCU or Utah). If a non-AQ team
isn't in the title game, it will be head
ed to the Rose Bowl in lieu of a Pac
-10 team. So oddly enough, go Boise.
I know. I'm not really going out on

many limbs with these predictions. I
also want to remind everyone that this
is not what I think should happen; it is
what I think will happen. When it
comes to that national championship
game, the Ducks will reign supreme.
Revenge will be had for last season's
defeat in Boise. As for the rest of the
BCS bowls, here you go:
Rose Bowl: Stanford vs. Michigan
State.
Sugar Bowl: Oklahoma vs.TCU.
Orange Bowl: Virginia Tech vs. Al
abama.
Fiesta Bowl: West Virginia vs.
Auburn.

Daniel Bohm couldn't get through a
column without taking a shot at Stan
ford's fan support. Help him find
