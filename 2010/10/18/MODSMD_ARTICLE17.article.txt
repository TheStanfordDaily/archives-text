The Stanford women's soccer team's two games
against Washington schools last weekend could
hardly have been more different, but they had one
important thing in common Stanford left both of
them with a victory. After blowing out the Cougars
of Washington State, 5-0, under a scorching sun on
Friday, the No. 1 Cardinal (12-0-2,3-0-0 Pac-10) bat
tled against the Huskies in a rain-soaked affair yes
terday. The match would eventually go Stanford's
way, 2-1, but not without over 80 minutes of chances
being turned away.
The Cardinal started the match against Washing
ton State (6-8,1-2) with a bang, scoring two goals in
the first 10 minutes of play.
Junior midfielder Teresa Noyola put the first goal
on the scoreboard. Noyola, positioned about 30
yards out, gathered the ball from the just-taken cor
ner and drove it into the top right corner of the net
for her seventh goal of the season.
Barely a minute had passed before Stanford got
its second goal of the half. Junior Camille Levin
served a ball across the box, and in an interesting in
stance of unspoken teamwork, Noyola ducked as
the ball soared over her head right into senior Chris
ten Press's instep. Press volleyed the ball into the
back of the net, scoring her 17th goal of the season in
the ninth minute of play.
Twelve minutes later, sophomore defender
Courtney Verloo sent a cross into the box where
Press got enough of a foot on it to hit the ball toward
back post. Senior midfielder Allison McCann was
parked at back post and took the header to score the
third goal of the game.

While the Cardinal offense continued to pres
sure the Cougar net, freshman goalkeeper Emily
Oliver held down the fort with well-timed saves. In
the 11th minute, Oliver pushed a powerful shot from
Washington State's Eileen Maes over the crossbar,
saving the Cardinal from any threat to its shutout.
Stanford's scoring picked back up as the 50th
minute rolled around. Junior forward Lindsay Tay
lor collected a pass from defender Annie Case and
slipped a left-footed shot past the keeper to give the
Cardinal a 4-0 lead.
The last goal came from freshman forward Na
talie Griffen, who aggressively followed a back-pass
to Washington State goalkeeper Ariana Byrd. Byrd
attempted to clear the ball, but it deflected off Griff-
