The Stanford women's soccer team's two games
against Washington schools last weekend could
hardly have been more different, but they had one
important thing in common Stanford left both of
them with a victory. After blowing out the Cougars
of Washington State, 5-0, under a scorching sun on
Friday, the No. 1 Cardinal (12-0-2,3-0-0 Pac-10) bat
tled against the Huskies in a rain-soaked affair yes
terday. The match would eventually go Stanford's
way, 2-1, but not without over 80 minutes of chances
being turned away.
The Cardinal started the match against Washing
ton State (6-8,1-2) with a bang, scoring two goals in
the first 10 minutes of play.
Junior midfielder Teresa Noyola put the first goal
on the scoreboard. Noyola, positioned about 30
yards out, gathered the ball from the just-taken cor
ner and drove it into the top right corner of the net
for her seventh goal of the season.
Barely a minute had passed before Stanford got
its second goal of the half. Junior Camille Levin
served a ball across the box, and in an interesting in
stance of unspoken teamwork, Noyola ducked as
the ball soared over her head right into senior Chris
ten Press's instep. Press volleyed the ball into the
back of the net, scoring her 17th goal of the season in
the ninth minute of play.
Twelve minutes later, sophomore defender
Courtney Verloo sent a cross into the box where
Press got enough of a foot on it to hit the ball toward
back post. Senior midfielder Allison McCann was
parked at back post and took the header to score the
third goal of the game.

While the Cardinal offense continued to pres
sure the Cougar net, freshman goalkeeper Emily
Oliver held down the fort with well-timed saves. In
the 11th minute, Oliver pushed a powerful shot from
Washington State's Eileen Maes over the crossbar,
saving the Cardinal from any threat to its shutout.
Stanford's scoring picked back up as the 50th
minute rolled around. Junior forward Lindsay Tay
lor collected a pass from defender Annie Case and
slipped a left-footed shot past the keeper to give the
Cardinal a 4-0 lead.
The last goal came from freshman forward Na
talie Griffen, who aggressively followed a back-pass
to Washington State goalkeeper Ariana Byrd. Byrd
attempted to clear the ball, but it deflected off Griff-

GAME NOTES ! After two home victories against the Washing

en into the back of the net, giving Stan
ford its final score of 5-0.
While the Cardinal would have eas
ily won Friday's match without the fifth
goal, for Griffen it had a bit of added
significance. It was the first goal of the
Pleasanton, Calif native's collegiate ca
reer, coming on just her third shot in a
total of five appearances.
"It was kind of an effort play, I just
ran as hard as I could and it ended up
coming out in my favor," Griffen said.
"But it felt awesome. It's like now, let
the floodgates open."
Stanford head coach Paul Racliffe
was equally pleased, both with Griff
en's breakthrough goal and the result
as a whole.
"I think the team started fast. We
scored some good goals early, and it re
ally opened things up for us," he said.
"Overall, the team played very well."
Stanford's early lead allowed Rat
cliffe to make liberal substitutions, with
a total of 22 players making appear
ances on the field.
"I think the team's improving
through the season. We're starting to get
more convincing results now, and I can
make more changes," he said. "Some of
the younger players are really develop
ing and getting better and better."
Stanford's 12-game winning streak
continued when it defeated Washing
ton (9-5-1, 2-2-0) in a rainy game on
Sunday afternoon. The Huskies en
tered the weekend tied with the Cardi
nal at 2-0 in the Pac-10 standings, but
lost to Cal on Friday after taking a 2-0
lead early in the game. While Washing
ton's defense held tough in a game that
could have allowed it to tie the Cardi
nal for first place, an early Stanford
goal and consistent pressure on offense
allowed the home team to prevail.
Stanford opened things up early,
with Taylor finding the net in just the
fourth minute. Noyola controlled the
ball outside the box and sent it in on the
left side to Press, who crossed it over to
Taylor just outside the right post. The
forward controlled the ball and fin
ished it off, placing it inside the near
post for her second goal of the week
end and sixth of the season.
Press's assist was the 39th of her ca
reer, putting her just one away from
tying the school record set by Marcie
Ward.
By the end of the first hall) the Cardi
nal had 16 shots, while the Huskies went
off the field with no shots to their name.
Stanford's starting 11 continued to
pressure heavily in the second, with
Husky goalkeeper Jorde Lafontaine-
Kussmann turning away chance after
chance. She ended the day with 10
saves on Stanford's 35 shots.
While the Cardinal would eventual
ly find the net for an insurance goal,
Ratcliffe was disappointed with his
team's inability to capitalize on
chances, and he praised the effort of

Lafontaine-Kussmann.
"It was a frustrating game because I
thought we had a strong performance,
but I give credit to their goalkeeper
she made some really great saves," he
said. "We just couldn't break the ice
again. We got the early goal and I
thought we created great chances, but
we couldn't put them away."
In the 88th minute, Stanford's
breakthrough effort came from a fa
miliar source: the nation's top scorer,
Christen Press.
After collecting the ball in the mid
field, Press pushed the ball in front of
her and bolted down the field, beating
the Husky defense and taking on the
keeper one-on-one. Her first attempt
was deflected by Lafontaine-Kussman,
but Press one-timed her own rebound
and put the ball away, marking her 18th
goal of the season. It also marked the
ninth consecutive match in which Press
scored a goal.
The Cardinal goal was answered in
the last minute of the game when
Husky midfielder Lindsay Elston sent
a cross to teammate Kelli Stewart, who
got her head on the ball and put it away
along the near post.

The ending result was a 2-1 victory
for Stanford, but not without numer
ous close chances, foiled by outstand
ing saves by Lafontaine-Kussman.
Press had several close-range shots in
side the six, such as one in the 72nd
minute of play, blocked by Lafontaine-
Kussman, who would dive for any shot,
using every inch of herself to block the
open net.
With the pair of victories, Stanford
improved to a perfect 4-0 in the Pac-10
this season. Oregon State is also unde
feated in the conference, but has only
played three games.
"The team's doing well and we're
happy to be at the top of the Pac-10,"
Ratcliffe said. "That's our goal, to win
the Pac-10 title, so we've got to keep
working hard and prepare for the next
two games."
Stanford will head to the desert
next weekend for a pair of games
against Arizona schools, taking on the
Sun Devils this Friday at 6 p.m. and the
Wildcats on Sunday at 11 a.m.

While Stanford pulled out two victories this weekend, it did so in very different ways. The Cardinal steamrolled Washington
State, 5-0, but had a tough time against Washington and goalie Jorde Lafontaine-Kussman in a close 2-1 win.
