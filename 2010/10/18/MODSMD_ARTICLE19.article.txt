## Running toward first place Stanford impresses at Pre-Nationals in Indiana 
### ZACH ZIMMERMAN DESK EDITOR 
If there's one thing Cardinal fans have
learned from the No. 1 Stanford men's
cross country team, it's that the stars love
to shine together. For the second straight
race, junior Chris Derrick, senior Elliott
Heath and redshirt junior Jacob Riley
crossed the finish line shoulder-to-shoul
der.
The 1-2-3 finish for the Card capped
off a day of dominance at NCAA Pre-
Nationals in Terre Haute, Ind. on Satur
day. Stanford easily won the White Race,
accumulating just 43 points compared to
runner-up No. 18 lona's total of 127. Der
rick was officially declared the overall
winner, but the top three Cardinal run
ners recorded the same time of 23:16.9.
"I wouldn't necessarily say it was easy,
but I wasn't hugely surprised," Derrick
said of the finish. "A couple of guys that
we thought might be able to run with us
weren't there and the strength of our
pack was able to overcome the other in
dividuals present."
While the strength of the Cardinal's
top three has not been in question this
season, the surprise performances of red
shirt sophomores Benjamin Johnson and
Miles Unterreiner have distanced the
team from the competition. The two fin
ished in 18th and 19th, crossing the finish
line in 24:02.8.
"They are tremendously important,"
Derrick said of Johnson and Unterrein
er. "Five score in cross country, and with
how competitive the NCAA is, if you
don't have a four and five, no matter how
good your [top three] are, you're not
going to win."
Up next for the men are the Pac-10 Cham
pionships on Oct. 30, a meet that, though
Stanford will be favored to win, will chal
lenge the Cardinal's stellar season record.
"Looking ahead, there are a lot of teams
that will be legitimate competition in our up
coming championship meets," Heath said.
"What they do is out of our control, so we are
just focused on taking care of our business as
best we can."
"There are some very very talented teams
out there and it's going to be a very close race,
but I truly believe that if we show up and run
like we're capable of that we can beat any
team in the country," Riley said.
Meanwhile, the No. 17 women, who had

dropped from No. 14 in the national rankings
prior to the Indiana meet, narrowly missed a
second-place finish in the White Race, finish
ing in third with 125 points. No. 5 George
town was victorious with 100 points, while
No. 9 Colorado snuck just past Stanford, tak
ing silver with 123 points.
Despite outclassing their national rank
ing, the Cardinal women were not happy with
their final position on Saturday.
"We are definitely not satisfied with the
third-place finish," redshirt junior Stephanie
Marcy said. "Our goal was to win and we
know that we were capable of winning since
we were only two points away from second
and 25 from first. The results are just fuel for
the fire now, and we have five weeks to

progress and get to where we need to be."
Sophomore Kathy Kroeger, the leader of
the women's team at the Stanford Invitation
al, once again paved the way for the Cardinal,
finishing in third place overall with a time of
20:12.0. In an extremely tight race, she fin
ished just four seconds behind the winner,
Lucy Van Dalen of Stony Brook.
Freshman Jessica Tonn ran her second
consecutive impressive race, finishing in 19th
with a time of 20:53.7. Veteran runners
Stephanie Marcy and Alex Gits, who finished
23rd and 31st respectively, emphasized first
year Tonn's value to the team.
"Jess has been improving every week,"
Gits said. "She has 100 percent of her heart
committed to the team and that is exactly

what we need."
"Jess has been such an incredible asset to
the team this season," Marcy added.
The women's team will also race next at the
Pac-10 Championships. Despite the team's
disappointment surrounding Pre-Nationals,
the collective goal remains the same.
"We can win Pac-lOs, there's no question
about it," Marcy said. "If we perform the way
we do every day during practice, we will
prove to be a formidable opponent in the
most competitive conference."
The Pac-10 Championships take place in
Seattle on Oct. 30.

"We are definitely not satisfied with the
third-place finish," redshirt junior Stephanie
Marcy said. "Our goal was to win and we
know that we were capable of winning since
we were only two points away from second
and 25 from first. The results are just fuel for
the fire now, and we have five weeks to

progress and get to where we need to be."
Sophomore Kathy Kroeger, the leader of
the women's team at the Stanford Invitation
al, once again paved the way for the Cardinal,
finishing in third place overall with a time of
20:12.0. In an extremely tight race, she fin
ished just four seconds behind the winner,
Lucy Van Dalen of Stony Brook.
Freshman Jessica Tonn ran her second
consecutive impressive race, finishing in 19th
with a time of 20:53.7. Veteran runners
Stephanie Marcy and Alex Gits, who finished
23rd and 31st respectively, emphasized first
year Tonn's value to the team.
"Jess has been improving every week,"
Gits said. "She has 100 percent of her heart
committed to the team and that is exactly

what we need."
"Jess has been such an incredible asset to
the team this season," Marcy added.
The women's team will also race next at the
Pac-10 Championships. Despite the team's
disappointment surrounding Pre-Nationals,
the collective goal remains the same.
"We can win Pac-lOs, there's no question
about it," Marcy said. "If we perform the way
we do every day during practice, we will
prove to be a formidable opponent in the
most competitive conference."
The Pac-10 Championships take place in
Seattle on Oct. 30.
