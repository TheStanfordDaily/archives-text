# Reported alcohol incidents outpace last year
## Fall quarter sees spike in rate of hospital transports 
### ELLORA ISRANI 
In the beginning weeks of fall quarter, 16 stu
dents were transported to the hospital for alcohol
related incidents, said Ralph Castro, manager of
the Substance Abuse Prevention Program at
Vaden Health Center. The number represents an
increased rate from the 61 total transports report
ed during the 2009-10 school year and is of growing
concern among administrators and dorm staff.
Castro said there is a common trend to the inci
dents.
"This is the fifth year we've been collecting this
data pretty systematically," Castro said. "In every
case I've reviewed ... the number-one determi

nant for people going to the emergency room is too
much hard liquor too many shots, repeated
shots, in a short amount of time."
Seven freshmen were transported to the hospi
tal in the last four weeks, compared to the total of
27 freshman incidents last year. Prior to arrival on
campus, all freshmen are required to complete the
AlcoholEdu program, which recently received
four more years of funding. But some are con
cerned that the mandatory program isn't serving
its purpose.
"Despite the fact that we have AlcoholEdu and
stuff, a lot of people don't necessarily know their
limits where social drinking stops and binge
drinking begins," said one resident assistant (RA)

in a freshman dorm. He wished to remain anony
mous to protect the identities of two freshmen who
were transported to the hospital from his dorm.
The Department of Public Safety has given four
citations between Sept. 15 and Oct. 14: two public
drunkenness citations and two minor-in-posses
sion citations, said department spokesman Bill
Larson.
The department remains on message regarding
the drinking age, "The law requires that you be at
least 21 years of age to purchase or consume alco
hol," Larson said in an e-mail to The Daily.
The statistics show that freshmen are not the only

contributors to this sharp increase in
transports. According to Castro, of
the 16 that have occurred so far, six
were sophomores and three were
juniors.Transports were evenly divid
ed between men and women.
There have been a number of
theories on why the increase has oc
curred, but Castro said it is "difficult
to gauge what's going on this early in
the quarter." He said Stanford's
"grassroots" safety measures must
improve.
"We need a better grassroots ef
fort of students looking out for each
other, and, first of all, for them
selves," Castro said.
In every alcohol-related trans
port this year, there were other stu
dents present who could have
"done something before it hap
pened," he said.

"If somebody had a bottle of
Advil and they were just putting
them in their mouths one at a time,
somebody would step in and go,
'What are you doing? That's not
healthy; that's not OK,"' Castro said.
"People should look at alcohol as a
drug, as an intoxicant... it leads to
being poisoned. It leads to overdose.
People need to understand and re-

spect alcohol as such."
He said Vaden and Stanford have

some work to do themselves.
"We probably need to do a better
job of getting some information out
there to students about that, to let
them know that you can't take mul
tiple shots of alcohol in a short
amount of time and expect to func
tion later," Castro said. "That's not
an appropriate use of alcohol."
