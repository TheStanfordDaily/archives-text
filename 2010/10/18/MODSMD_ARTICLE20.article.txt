# SWEEPS ON THE FARM

### JACK BLANCHAT 
The Stanford women's lacrosse team
took down St. Mary's, Fresno State and
UC-Davis last Saturday in a round-robin
playday, a good start to the season before
the team heads to Philadelphia this week
end.

Because the official lacrosse season
does not start until winter, the games were
informal and no official scores were kept.
Nevertheless, the Cardinal had no trouble
dusting off all three opponents, outplaying
and outscoring all three.

Plead coach Amy Bokker compliment
ed the three Mountain Pacific Sports Fed
eration (MPSF) foes for their solid play.
"Fresno State now has a couple years
under their belt. They seem to have more
experience," she said. "UC-Davis has al
ways been right there in the MPSF they
held their own. St. Mary's looked pretty
competitive, too, but mainly it was just nice
to get out and play against three confer
ence opponents."

Stanford started the day with a 9 a.m.
match against St. Mary's. The Cardinal
dominated the time of possession and got
its fair share of turnovers, but had some

trouble scoring when close to the goal.
"I thought we had a lot of good looks and
great opportunities for us. We either kept
missing the cage or they were clanging off the

GAME NOTES: After three successful bouts against St.
Mary's, UC-Davis and Fresno State last Saturday,
women's lacrosse looks to a tough upcoming week
end in Philadelphia. The Card will face off against de
fending national champion Maryland, Penn and Vir
ginia on Saturday and will see Drexel, St. Joseph's
and Temple on Sunday.


ANDREW STILES/The Stanford Daily
Stanford's women's lacrosse team continued preseason action on the Varsity Turf against three California schools over the weekend, notching
wins over St. Mary's, Fresno State and UC-Davis. The Card will face tough opposition next weekend, as it faces down three highly-ranked foes.

posts," Bokker said. "We wanted to
keep momentum and it's hard when
you keep shooting and missing."
In the second game, Stanford
faced off against UC-Davis, whom
Stanford only defeated by a score of
17-14 when the Aggies last visited
the Farm. The Cardinal had far less
trouble with the Aggies on Satur
day, notching a 15-9 victory.
The Card ended the day against
Fresno State, commanding both time
of possession and face-offs on the
way to a 13-3 victory. Stanford start
ed off quickly, and used the fast break
to its advantage, whipping any
missed shot by a Bulldog down the
field, resulting in several quick scores
for the Card.
"We really wanted to utilize our
team speed, which I think looks
great," Bokker said. "Our goal was
to finish on five fast break opportu
nities each game, and we did that in
every game except the first one,
where we only had four."
The top players of the day were
the attackers for the Card, who
feasted on those fast break opportu
nities. Junior Emilie Boeri, sopho
more Jennifer Lang and freshman
Rachel Ozer scored multiple goals
in all three games.

Another high point for the Car
dinal was the goalkeeping of fresh
man Lyndsey Munoz and senior
Annie Read, who split time and
managed to hold both the Fresno
State and UC-Davis offenses to sin
gle-digit scoring.
Bokker said she was very happy
overall with the team's play, but
said, "I was a little disappointed be
cause our settled defense looked re
ally great against Cal last week, and
there were times when we looked a
little bit unorganized today. That
comes with a little bit more practice
and getting used to one another."
The Cardinal's next test comes
this weekend, as the team heads to
Philadelphia to take on Maryland,
Penn and Virginia on Saturday, all
of whom finished in the top 10 last
season. Maryland headlines the
slate, as the Terrapins finished No. 1
after taking home the national title
over Northwestern with a 13-11 vic
tory in May.
The Cardinal will be looking to

avenge its 20-8 loss to the Terrapins
last season, where the Terps had a
first-half run of 10 straight goals and
a second half run of seven straight
goals. Although Stanford cut the
lead to only 13-7 at one point in the
second half, Maryland was too
strong, outshooting the Card 43-16
overall.
After Saturday's draw against
top quality competition, the Card
will then take on Drexel, St.
Joseph's and Temple on Sunday. St.
Joseph's struggled to a 2-14 record
last year, while Temple finished 7-10
and Drexel completed a 10-7 sea
son.
Stanford announced the 2011
spring schedule last Thursday,
which will feature four matchups
against top-15 teams from last year
No. 2 Northwestern, No. 11 Notre
Dame, No. 9 Syracuse and No. 10
Vanderbilt.
