## Random audits to begin Admission office will review applicants 
### LAURYN WILLIAMS 
Stanford will implement random au
diting of prospective students' applica
tions starting this application season
with early-action applicants, whose cre
dentials are due Nov. 1.
The Office of Undergraduate Ad
mission will use random audits to hold a
portion of the estimated 30,000 students
expected to apply to Stanford this year
accountable for what they declare to be
true in their applications.
Because the implementation of this
practice is still in the planning phase, the
Admission Office is not yet sure of how
many audits it will be able to carry out.
Though the practice of verifying and
confirming each aspect of an applica
tion may be new to Stanford, it will not
be the first of its kind in the state of Cal
ifornia.
"The University of California system
already audits," Director of Admission
Robert Patterson said. "They use differ
ent techniques to conduct these audits,
including e-mailing and calling stu
dents." Patterson was the deputy direc
tor of admission at UC-Berkeley from
spring 2009 until he became director at
Stanford this fall.
When using the Common Applica
tion to apply to Stanford, applicants are
prompted to electronically sign agree
ments stating that their claims are true
before the applications can be submit
ted, thus holding them to the Funda
mental Standard.
Current Stanford students are famil
iar with the Honor Code and the Funda
mental Standard, which calls for "re
spect for order, morality, and personal
honor" as necessary traits in a Stanford
student and applicant. But for a small
number of past applicants, a contract
binding them to their work has not
been enough to ensure honesty in
the application process.
"Many institutions, including
Stanford, have responded to this
prominent discussion on the nation
al level of college admissions," Pat
terson said.

Students who are chosen to have
their application audited will be con
tacted directly to notify them of their
selection in the process. Both the
general Common Application and
the Stanford Supplement to the
Common Application will be includ
ed in the auditing procedure.
The issue reached a national au
dience this summer when alleged ac
ademic con artist Adam Wheeler ap
plied and was accepted to Stanford
after he was expelled from Harvard
and indicted in May on 20 counts of
identity theft, larceny and other
charges.
Stanford officials in June said the
University revoked Wheeler's ad-

mission offer.
In July, Dean of Admission
Richard Shaw told The Daily
the office was
considering a
random audit
system be
cause of the
"issue of
dishonesty
and forgery
on the national
level." He declined
to comment on the
Wheeler incident specifically.
Patterson said the decision to im
plement random audits was made in
dependently of the incident.
"The decision to enforce random
audits at Stanford does not have to

do with Adam Wheeler," Patterson
said. "This is something the admis
sion office has considered doing for a
while."

According to Patterson, the Na
tional Association of College Admis
sions Counseling, which aims to en
sure that its member institutions
carry out ethical and fair admission
practices, is calling for colleges to
look into verifying student accom
plishments.
"We actively follow the principles
and practices of NACAC and the
College Board," Patterson said.
"Both organizations have seen an in
crease in application falsity and want
colleges to look into this."

To ensure that a scandal similar to
Wheeler's never occurs again, the
entire admission office, headed by
Patterson, will oversee the process of
random auditing.
Though applying students may
view random auditing as an attempt
to "catch" students, Patterson asserts
that the Admission Office is hoping
to ensure the opposite.
"We do not hope to catch any stu
dents," he said. "Our philosophy in
the Admission Office is to keep the
process fair for all students, especial
ly honest students. We intend to keep
prospective students informed of the
process and to make it as transparent
as possible."
