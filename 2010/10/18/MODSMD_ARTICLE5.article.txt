# STUDENT LIFE
## Saturday Startup School inspires budding entrepreneurs 
### ALAN GUO STAFF WRITER 
The annual Startup School, put on by
the Business Association of Stanford En
trepreneurial Students (BASES) and Y-
Combinator, featured founders and in
vestors in Dinkelspiel Auditorium on Sat
urday. More than 800 prospective entre
preneurs attended.

The day's list of speakers included Silicon
Valley heavyweights such as Mark Zucker
berg, founder and CEO of Facebook, Reid
Hoffman 'B9, founder of Linkedln, and
angel investor Ron Conway, who was one of
the early investors in companies such as
Google, Pay Pal, Facebook and Twitter.
The annual event is a collaboration be
tween BASES, a student organization fo
cused on entrepreneurship on campus, and

Y-Combinator, a startup incubator that
identifies promising startups and helps them
succeed. In its sixth year, the event attracted
young entrepreneurs, including approxi
mately 200 current Stanford students and re
cent alumni.
The day started with Andy Bechtolsheim,
co-founder of Sun Microsystems, who dis
cussed venture financing to the "too-young
to-know" crowd of twenty-something hack

ers and founders.
"The key to success [in the Internet
space] isn't to be the first," Bechtolsheim
said, using Google as an example. "It is who
solved the right problem."
Ron Conway spoke later, sharing his an
ecdotes of meeting the founders of Napster,
Google, Facebook and Twitter for the first
time. His behind-the-scene stories
illustrated the evolution of each of
these companies, and pointed out
that even the founders themselves
were surprised by their own incred
ulous success.
In an amusing moment of the
day, a girl asked if it is possible to
be too young to be an entrepre
neur. Conway said no and asked
how old is she. "Twelve," she
replied amid cheers and applause
from the audience.
The day's most anticipated event
was Mark Zuckerberg's on-stage in
terview with Jessica Livingston, co
founder of Y-Combinator.
When asked about the recent
movie "The Social Network,"
Zuckerberg said, "The people in
Hollywood just don't get the whole
culture of Silicon Valley. They just
can't wrap their head around the
idea that someone would build
something because they like build
ing things."
Though Zuckerberg said he
didn't foresee his success and ad
mitted that he had "no grand
plan" for Facebook when he start
ed, his family is more perceptive of
his capacity.
"Before I started college, my
younger sister made a bet with me
that she would finish college before
me," he said. "So I owe her $50."
According to Yin Yin Wu 'll, the
co-president of BASES, the event
attracted more than 2,000 applica
tions from around the world, but the
venue could only accommodate
1,000 people.
"We had people coming from
even Japan, who flew in for this one
day event," Wu said.
After the speakers finished,
members in the audience said they

were inspired.
Steve Wu 'll meets entrepre
neurs at other events,"but just noth
ing on a scale like this," said the
computer science major.
"If you really focus on the busi

ness, you will change the world for
good, whether you want it or not,"
he added.
