## Event covers the science of altruism Dalai Lama discusses meditation and compassion 
### KAMIL DADA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
It turns out that even after 60 years of
meditating and practicing compassion, the
Dalai Lama still has much spiritual learning
to do.
"Even now, I cannot say my spiritual ex
perience is something very high," he said,
laughing. "It is a little above zero. So it takes
a lot of years."
Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai Lama, ad
mitted as much to approximately 1,500
eager listeners in Memorial Auditorium on
Friday. He said he started meditating when
he was about 15 years old. He gradually
began more "serious practice and study"
when he was in his late 20s and 30s, and
began reaching "deeper levels" in his 50s
and 60s.
The head of state and the spiritual leader
of Tibet, now 75, engaged Stanford profes
sors at a Center for Compassion and Altru
ism Research and Education (CCARE)
conference, which aimed to tease out the
neurobiological underpinnings of compas
sion and altruism. Professors had 10 min
utes each to present their emerging findings
from experimental research in psychology,
neurosciences and the emerging field of
neuro-economics.
Brian Knutson, associate professor of
psychology and neuroscience, kicked off the
day with a review of his work using fMRI to
identify brain pathways involved in the ex
ercise of compassion.
"We're at the very beginning of this re
search, but there's good evidence that com
passion can be elicited in the laboratory,"
Knutson said. "We need to further investi
gate."
What emerged from the daylong confer
ence was a general consensus on the bene
fits of compassion, but a lack of clear under
standing of how to objectively measure it
using the scientific method. All researchers
professed going forward that much more re
search was needed in the field of compas
sion.
"We've got to have a standardized set of
measures to show the benefits of compas
sion training," said James Doty, professor of
neurosurgery and director of CCARE.
Psychiatrist and bioengineer Karl Deis
seroth, who helped pioneer the new field of
optogenetics, explained his work studying
the neural basis of social compassion in the
mammalian brain.
"The goal is to slowly start to piece to
gether how mammals value social behavior
and this is ultimately, we think, linked to
compassion," Deisseroth said.
The goal of his research, he explained,
was to determine whether compas
sion is an emotion that can be gener
alized and cultivated. He described
an experiment in which he activated
specific brain cells of mice using puls
es of light to make them more social.
"We turned on neutral reward cir
cuitry to promote nurturing and pro
social behavior in mice," he said. "It is
yet to be seen whether this is can be
replicated in other species."
While the researchers were un
clear on the quantifiable benefits of
compassion and how to generate it,
the Dalai Lama was clear: meditation
makes a person happier and calmer.
"There is one thing I can state def
initely, with confidence: the mind can
change through training, through

awareness," he said. "That's for sure."
Consequently, the Dalai Lama
was more interested in how to inhibit
anger.
"Anger is really of no use," he said.
"It creates all the problems. So here
we need investigation. Can you re
move anger through electricity in the
brain?"
William Harbaugh, a neuroecono
mist at the University of Oregon, con
tinued the debate by describing the
brain's reward mechanism when peo
ple donate money to charity.
"Research shows that people do
get a neural reward form charitable
giving," he said. "This activation tends
to be higher when people make the
choice voluntarily."
The Dalai Lama was quick to
agree and noted that being compas
sionate toward others was beneficial
to the individual.

"There is a misunderstanding that
showing compassion and love for oth

ers means sacrificing yourself," he
said. "This is not the case. By helping
others, you are helping yourself."
Throughout the day, the Dalai
Lama was easily able to merge the
concepts of science and religion while
discussing altruism. He championed
the importance of science to contem
porary life, but he also warned that
the benefit of science was dependent
on the human designer.
"The development of science and
technology of course has benefit, but
it also brought unthinkable suffer
ing," he said, outlining the develop
ment of the atomic bomb and World
War 11. "Science and technology
alone is not a guarantee for happiness
on this planet. Science is created and
used by human beings. If the user is
full of hatred, then these technologies
become destructive."
