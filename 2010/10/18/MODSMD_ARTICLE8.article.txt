## Knight Management Center wins environmental award 
### MATT BETTONVILLE 
The Silicon Valley/San Jose Business Journal recently
named the rising Knight Management Center, scheduled to
open this spring, its 2010 Green Project of the Year. The cen
ter, which will house Stanford's Graduate School of Business
(GSB), has earned Leadership in Environmental Energy
and Design (LEED) Platinum certification by implement
ing new energy-conserving technologies.
"[Our efforts] had a lot to do with being a leader and
demonstrating what it means to be green," said Knight
Management Center Program Director Kathleen Ka
vanaugh.
The Silicon Valley/San Jose Business Journal presents a
Green Project of the Year award to both a public and a pri
vate construction project each year. Turner Construction,
the company contracted to build the Knight Management
Center, nominated the project for the private award. The
project came with an estimated $350 million price tag.
Kavanaugh pointed to community factors for the proj
ect, which employed around 400 people day-to-day and
spent more than $l2 million per month, helping to stimu
late the local economy, she said. The project's LEED Plat
inum certification, which is the highest level of certification
the U.S. Green Building Council awards, was a major factor
in the prize.
In addition to careful selection of resources in building
the Knight Management Center, the project has many fea

tures to provide lasting energy conservation that Ka
vanaugh said will make the complex consume 46 percent
less energy than an average building of its size.
Notable among the building's green systems is a water
collection and conservation system that reduces the use of
potable water by 80 percent. Gutters across the roof of the
complex collect rainwater and store it in a 75,000-gallon
holding tank underground for use in plant irrigation and
toilet water.

The south-slanting roofs on the Knight Management
Center feature solar paneling that will compensate for 12.5
percent of the complex's electric power. In all, the center
will house 4,275 solar modules, more than tripling the num
ber of solar cells on campus.
California solar company Solar City owns and installed
the solar cells on the center, and will sell the power to Stan
ford. Kavanaugh said that although solar energy costs more
than conventional sources of electricity, the efficiency of the
buildings compensates to produce a predicted 75 percent
net decrease in energy costs over the existing GSB facility.
The current GSB facility is comprised of a main building
constructed in 1966 and peripheral buildings constructed in
1989 and 1999.
"We've done lots to try to be the most energy-efficient
we can," said Kavanaugh.
Other details of the project lean toward green. Fifty per-
