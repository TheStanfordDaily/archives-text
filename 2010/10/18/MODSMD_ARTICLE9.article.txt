JONATHAN YORK/The Stanford Daily
Former President Bill Clinton, left, Democratic gubernatorial candidate Jerry Brown, center, and lieutenant-governor hopeful Gavin Newsom, right, wave at a California Democrat rally at San Jose State University on Sunday. Clinton
has been campaigning with both Brown, the state attorney general, and Newsom, San Francisco's mayor, in recent days, as both hopefuls are locked in tight races with only weeks to go until November's general election. Brown, who
has served as California's governor previously, is battling Republican nominee Meg Whitman, while Newsom is running against the incumbent Lt. Gov. Abel Maldonado, who was appointed to the office in April of this year.
