## GIRL YOU KNOW IT'S TRUE Science Watch '10 
### Jordan Carr 
The latest issue of "The Atlantic" featured
a profile of Dr. John loannidis, a man who
has devoted his career to debunking and
disproving the myriad failures of medical re
search. According to the article, loannidis
"charges that as much as 90 percent of the pub
lished medical information that doctors rely on
is flawed," due to factors such as institutional
pride, corruption and conflicts of interest in
particular, researchers' reliance on funding
from pharmaceutical companies.
With all due respect to Dr. loannidis, sci
ence just had a magical week, proving awe
some, important things left and right in a
way that clearly is not designed to gain at
tention, but instead to enhance the body of
human knowledge and the understanding of
the magical world that surrounds us. This
again proves that having an inquisitive na
ture and desire to figure out the natural
world still has practical benefits, even in this
day and age. Having said that, everything
that follows is completely true and not to be
questioned.
Study: Babies think friendly robots are human
A University of Washington study showed
that if a robot exhibits humanoid characteris
tics and interacts socially with 18-month-old
babies, the babies can be tricked into believ
ing those silver devils are actually humans.
I know what you're thinking: this ability
to deceive man so easily may be the first
step toward a dystopian future where robots
act autonomously and crush the human race
a la "Terminator," but this strikes me as
more like "Bicentennial Man" remem
ber that movie? Robin Williams was a
robot. The movie actually took 200 years.
Does this ring a bell at all? Anyway, in that
movie, the future was really, really boring,
and all the robots (well, really just the Robin
Williams robot) wanted was to be recog
nized as human.
So the good news is that the future is not
enslavement at the hands of the robots. The
bad news is that the future is going to get a 38
percent on Rotten Tomatoes because it is
slow-paced, and its plot will lack an identifi
able conflict or a sympathetic protagonist.
Study: Drinking during pregnancy makes bet
ter children
Relying on self-reported data, a United
Kingdom study showed that the children of
women who drink lightly during pregnancy
(one to two units of alcohol per week) fare
better on cognitive tests.
On the one hand, there is the possibility
that months after giving birth (when the sur
vey was administered), when confronted by a
person asking whether or not they were
drinking while pregnant, it is the case that the
women who were lying elected to go with the
"no drinking ever" category.
On the other hand, we now have ir
refutable proof that drinking during preg
nancy makes smarter children. Fun fun!

Study: Watermelon shown to reduce blood
pressure

Watermelon is tasty. And healthy. What
more do I have to say?

Study: Teens average 3,339 texts per month
Say what you will about these teens aver
aging over 100 text messages a day, but this
has to prove that they are remarkably tech
nology-savvy. Teens send millions of texts a
day, and nobody ever hears anything about it.
But grandfather and Minnesota Vikings
quarterback Brett Favre tries to send one,
and all of a sudden pictures of his, um, Min
nesota Viking (helmet included) are all over
the Internet.
Study: Taking a break from a task means you're
being lazy, weak-willed, not "recharging"
This is a fun one, and it's from a team of
Stanford psychologists. From the paper's ab
stract: "whether depletion [of willpower]
takes place or not depends on a person's be
lief about whether willpower is a limited re
source." In other words, if you think you need
to take a break in order to refresh, you are
just a mentally weak pansy who needs to get
back to work.
Study: Employees find prostitution less humil
iating than being on Linkedln
A recent survey showed that while 9 per
cent of American workers would consider
having an office fling with their boss in order
to advance their careers, only 6 percent are
connected to their bosses on business net
working site Linkedln.
See, science is working to make our lives
better. This week we learned a lot about
human interactions. If you are a boss who has
an ambitious employee, it is more tasteful to
offer to advance their career in exchange for
sexual favors than to send them a Linkedln
request. If you want to talk to teens, text them
or don't. A different Stanford study
showed cell phones to be infested with 18
times as much bacteria as toilet seats. If you
want to be more productive, be more produc
tive, and quit distracting yourself. If you want
smarter kids, get drunk immediately. If you
want to trick a child born of even the drunk
est parents, get a robot. And if you want to
keep your blood pressure down, eat some de
licious, delicious watermelon.
