## Trapped In the Pantry 
### Jade Wang 
When I was a child, my concept of
being grown up was nothing short
of glamorous, involving a lot of
poise and knowledge of purpose. High
school graduation came and went, and
while I like to think I at least had fewer
tantrums post-diploma, the magical calm of
adulthood eluded me through Stanford.
One degree later, I write to you with the
limited wisdom of having struggled through
12 finals weeks but otherwise still lacking
this calm.

My childhood conception of adulthood
was perhaps unrealistic. I thought that my
struggles and mild hysteria would abate to
make room for wisdom and competence. I
am not quite a real adult, but my hypothe
sis? I was wrong. The feeling of being a lit
tle bit lost will probably follow me around
the rest of my life, but it's not devastating.
It reminds me to be pleasant to others who
feel the same way, and sometimes, it occa
sionally lands me in ridiculous situations.
There was that one time that I got
locked in the pantry of an empty mansion,
for example. A little background my
summer internship provided housing in the
form of host families. While I spent my days
toiling, non-profit-style, I spent my nights
in a huge house, the guest of a generous
family. They went on vacation at one point,
leaving me to fend for myself (with the
help of a full-time housekeeper) and keep
their pets alive. I was a college graduate
and had at least shown myself to be moder
ately independent for short periods at a
time, so I was not particularly worried
about my well-being.
Then, I locked myself in the pantry.

I got home late, after my program's ver
sion of Back to School Night, which, for a
student teacher, felt like a big exam. I was
exhausted after a harrowing 14-hour work
day, the last several hours of which were
spent attempting to speak Spanish, a lan
guage in which I can comfortably state, "My
name is Jade" and "It is cold outside," speak
at length about global warming and nothing
else.
I had prioritized keeping the pets alive,
however, so I diligently let the dogs in and
went to give them dinner. I walked into the
pantry with two dog bowls, scooped the first
serving and heard the pantry door shut be
hind me. Then, I heard the doorknob fall
out.
I tapped the door to make sure it had, in
fact, shut. It had. I managed to curtail the
hysterical crying, but I did get dizzy with
panic and drive all rational thought from
my mind. I banged on the door pathetically,
wondering if perhaps a neighbor might
hear me, or that the dogs might magically
know how to put the door back together.
No luck.
My palms tingling, I sat down on the
floor and started to evaluate my situation. I
realized the housekeeper would come in
approximately 12 hours, so at least I would
n't die. I tried shutting my eyes and sitting
to ascertain the likelihood of my falling
asleep in there, given my state of exhaus
tion. My rational thought left me, however,
when I realized I might have to pee.
Thus began another round of banging
pathetically on the door, attempting to
break it down. This time, I did not maturely
refrain from throwing a crying fit. I did have

a brief interlude of shrewd rational calcula
tion during which I tried to decide if I would
actually go insane trapped in the pantry and
weighed the cost of my impending psychi
atric bills with the cost of repairing the
pantry door. This analysis was inconclusive,
but it didn't matter, because my nonexist
ent upper body strength was absolutely no
match for the solid, solid door.
Defeated, I somehow found calm again
and realized I was not playing to my
strengths. While I am decidedly non-athlet
ic, I do play "Escape From This Room"
flash games with alarming frequency. I used
my fingernails to unscrew the rest of the
doorknob and a kebab to push out the
other pieces. Miraculously, I managed to
puzzle out how the doorknob worked and
used a can and a dog leash to open it. It was
literally the most James Bond thing I have
ever done and likely will ever do.
I wept with happiness upon escaping
from the pantry and also subsequently de
veloped major paranoia about that little
room.
My child self would have scoffed that my
22-year-old self could manage to get herself
trapped in a pantry, but I have come to ex
pect and almost embrace these little hic
cups. It might be less than sophisticated, but
ultimately, I would choose the storytelling
fodder life anytime but not having the
choice makes it that much better.
