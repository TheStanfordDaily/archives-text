## Stanford concludes voter registration initiative with White Plaza drive 
### JAZMIN YOUNGBLOOD 
Stanford students have recently
taken action to prepare for the up
coming elections. Monday marked
the last day to register to vote in Cal
ifornia, with a wave of student initia
tives accompanying the arrival of
that deadline.
According to Public Policy Insti
tute of California, 49 percent of the
18-to-24-year-old age group were
registered to vote as of September.
Student organizations around cam
pus are now focusing on bolstering
student participation in the Nov. 2
general election.
ASSU began a voter registration
effort on a dorm-by-dorm basis in
early October. Dorm representatives
distributed voter registration cards
and gave students the option to re
ceive e-mail reminders for upcoming
elections. The set-up was meant to be
simple and easy for students. The
nonpartisan initiative encouraged
students to become involved, regard
less of party affiliation.
John Haskell'l2, ASSU executive

chief of staff, faced concerns about
whether or not the voter registration
drive could be truly nonpartisan. He
said the concerns were not valid.
"The drive is completely nonpar
tisan," Haskell said. "Dorm 'cap
tains' [assisting in dorm registration]
cannot ask or influence party regis
tration, and we do not keep track or
look at what party people register
with."
On Monday, the last day to regis
ter, Stanford Black Student Union
(BSU), Alpha Phi Alpha, NAACP
and ASSU co-sponsored a voter-reg
istration drive in White Plaza, making
one final push to encourage students
to cast their vote in the fast-ap
proaching elections. Jam Pac'd and
Stanford Spoken Word Collective
were slated to perform, and bright
signs and enthusiastic volunteers
urged passing crowds to register to
vote.
The co-chairs of the Political Ac
tion Committee of the BSU, Kayla
Steper 'l3 and Jason Carter 'l3,
helped organize the event. Both em
phasized the importance of voting

and considered the drive a success,
with 150 newly registered students.
The initiative encouraged the student
body to not let fear or apathy prevent
them from registering to vote.
"If we silence ourselves," Steper
said, "then there is no way we will
have any change."
"We want students to know their
vote counts," Carter said. "A lot of
time when you get stuck in the Stan
ford bubble, you become disillu
sioned."
New propositions have heated up
the political atmosphere in California
and caused some stir among campus.
"It is through conflicting conver
sation that we get our best solutions,"
Steper said.
For many students, voting is an
important form of expression.
"For me, [the importance of vot
ing is] to let your voice be heard,"
said Torie Bates 'l3. "Everyone has
an opinion, and they should express
that opinion."
