## Fixing contact sports? 
### Zach Zimmerman Dishing the Rock 
I really didn't anticipate learning
a valuable lesson in parenthood
last weekend. However, after 10-
plus hours of television and a
slew of the scariest hits I have
ever seen, the message has been re
ceived.
My kid will never play football.
It's impossible to imagine what's
going through the minds of Rutgers
defensive tackle Eric LeGrand and his
family. While making a tackle on a
kickoff return, LeGrand ran his six
foot-two, 275-pound frame head-first
into the returner.The next few minutes
were horrifying as he lay motionless on
the field, able only to shake his head.
He couldn't grip the fingers of the
athletic trainers. He couldn't give a
thumbs-up to the crowd as he was cart
ed off in a stretcher. He couldn't give
his mother a hug from his hospital bed.
Eric LeGrand couldn't do any of
these things, because football left him
paralyzed below the neck.
LeGrand is the most unfortunate
victim among a laundry list of athletes
that have recently received severe
trauma to the head and/or neck. From
the NFL's Aaron Rodgers and De-
Sean Jackson to Stanford's Chris
Owusu and the NHL's Keith Ballard,
the increasing dangers of contact
sports are, sadly, receiving more atten
tion than ever.
I'm not sure about you, but this
poses a really difficult problem for me
as a fan of contact sports. I love soccer
and mixed martial arts. I love football
to the point that I wrote an entire col
umn last week on a single hit. There's
just something about the violent as
pect of sport that perversely appeals to
us. It's absolutely undeniable.
Therefore, we should consider our
selves barbaric. But we don't. Our ra
tionale is that every time we cheer a big
hit, a knockout, hell, even a NASCAR
crash, we do so hoping, thinking, know
ing that everyone will come out un
scathed.
But this doesn't happen. Week in
and week out, guys and girls are con
cussed and debilitated. The problem
has become such a pandemic that the
Boston University Medical School is
performing a brain trauma study on
over 300 athletes that have agreed to
regular testing. At the time of this col
umn, over 40 of these athletes have
agreed to donate their brains after
death.
This move is both brilliant and nec
essary. We're no longer in the age of the
gladiator. Athletes should be able to
enter the arena knowing that, win or
lose, they're going to come out breath
ing and, more or less, in a single piece.
Everyone involved with sports ath
letes, coaches, trainers and fans
must become better educated.
But then what? We learn that hav
ing eight concussions by age 22 leaves
you with oatmeal for brains. We learn
that hockey fighting, a skill that is often
taught before age 10, causes short
term memory loss in early adulthood.
Will that change the way sports are
taught, played and viewed?
One can only hope so. I played bas
ketball and soccer as a kid, but the in
jury story of my childhood that I'll
never forget stems from my younger
brother's Pop Warner days. The best
kid on the team, a linebacker that has
outweighed kids five years his elder
since he could walk, was making a hit
when he was briefly knocked out.
After getting up and complaining
about dizziness, the kid came back in,
three plays later. He could have worn a
memory foam mattress on his head,
and this still would have been a terrible
decision.
Regardless of how advanced our
technology is, if you hit or are hit the
wrong way, your career as an athlete,
and as a fully functional human being,
could be over. We would all be com
pletely devastated if the game of foot
ball vanished, but it wouldn't hold a
candle to how we would feel if our kid
lost movement in his limbs.
I'm not calling for a ban of contact
sports, because I wouldn't know what
to do with myself. Sports, as I've
stressed time and time again, play an
enormous role in my life and in the
lives of millions of people. What I am
asking for, however, is that we invest as
much time reforming the contact
sports culture as we do watching ath
letes writhing in pain. Get rid of the "if
