# CARD GIVES BRUINS BOOT
## Stanford upsets No. 13 UCLA and defeats San Diego State behind backup goalkeeper 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With a 2-1 upset of No. 13 UCLA
Friday night and a hard-fought 1-0
victory against San Diego State on
Sunday afternoon, the Stanford
men's soccer team moved past the
.500 mark and into the heart of the
Pac-10 title race. At 7-6 overall and 3-
2 in Pac-10 play, the Cardinal sits just
one game behind co-leaders Califor
nia and UCLA with five regular-sea
son games remaining.
A huge crowd of over 2,000 turned
out to support the Cardinal against
the rival Bruins. UCLA (8-3-1,3-1-0)
came in riding a four-game winning
streak and was undefeated in Pac-10
play.
But for one of the first times this
year, Stanford came to play right out
of the gate. The Cardinal was clearly
the aggressor and dominated posses
sion early, creating a few good oppor
tunities in the first 15 minutes as the
Bruins looked overwhelmed.
The breakthrough came in the 23rd
minute when sophomore midfielder
Dersu Abolfathi dribbled through a
defender and into the box, only to be
brought down before he could get a
shot off. The referee signaled for a
penalty kick, and senior defender and
captain Bobby Warshaw calmly
stepped up and slotted the ball into
the corner for the early 1-0 lead.
The goal seemed to energize the
Bruins, however, as they picked up the
pace and settled in. UCLA ended up
outshooting the Cardinal 8-5 in the
half, even though most of the shots
were relatively harmless from the
outside. Redshirt freshman goalkeep
er Galen Perkins was forced into two
saves and cleaned up several corner
kicks and crosses into the box.
Perkins and the back four were up
to the challenge, and the game re
mained 1-0 at half time. UCLA came
out like gangbusters to open the sec
ond half, fighting for every ball and
pinning the Cardinal in its own half.
Perkins was repeatedly challenged
and made three saves in the first 20
minutes.
"Galen's done very well for us,"
Abolfathi said. "[lnjured goalie Jason
Dodson's] shoes are pretty hard to fill,
but he's done it well. He has shown
the ability to keep us in games with his

saves, and he has distributed the ball
well to start the attack."
It took a first-class effort from
UCLA freshman standout Kelyn
Rowe to beat Perkins. Rowe took a
pass from Ryan Hollingshead in the
73rd minute and carried it straight up
the middle of the field before taking a
shot that bent past the diving Perkins
and into the upper left-hand corner
for the equalizer.

The Bruins continued to press for
the game-winner, but Perkins
stopped several shots in the final 15
minutes to keep Stanford level.
With five minutes to play, Abol
fathi and sophomore forward Adam
Jahn returned as substitutes and
made an impact almost instantly. Ju
nior forward Taylor Amman flicked a
ball in the middle of the field to Jahn,
who played it on to a streaking Abol
fathi. One-on-one with the keeper,
the young midfielder placed a shot in
side the left post to set off a wild cele
bration at Laird Q. Cagan Stadium.
"I literally just stepped on the
field, and you can hear him [the PA
announcer] announcing my name [as
a substitute] in the film of the goal,"
Abolfathi said. "Taylor did well to
flick it, and Adam used his body to
open the gap for me. It was simple, but
I'll take it."

The Cardinal had to work hard to
avoid a letdown against San Diego
State (7-5-1, 1-4) two days later, but

Redshirt freshman goalkeeper Galen Perkins, above, helped carry Stanford to a pair of victories over the weekend.
Perkins has shined since being pressed into duty because of an injury to starter Jason Dodson.

Perkins was up to the challenge. In
the freshman's fourth career game, he
stopped six shots and earned his sec
ond shutout.
Warshaw said that he felt in the pre
season that Perkins was destined to
make a positive impact on the team.
"I sat down with Galen before the
East Coast trip, and you could just tell
he would help us from the way he
handled being in a difficult situation
[as the backup goalkeeper] and just
his approach," Warshaw said. "He is a
great guy who shows up and works
hard every day.
"No one on the team is surprised
with how well he has done," he added.
For all their offensive troubles, the
Aztecs did stymie the Cardinal of
fense in the first half. Their use of an
offside trap caught Stanford's attack
ers eight times in the first 45 minutes.
But San Diego State was done in
when it failed to cover senior defend
er Cameron Lamming in the 78th
minute. Lamming headed a corner
kick from junior midfielder Clayton
Holz into the net for his first goal of
the year, and the defense held firm to
complete the weekend sweep.
The season-opening four-game
losing streak looks to be a thing of the
past as the Cardinal hits the midpoint
of the Pac-10 season firmly in the
thick of things. The team sits in prime
position to make a deep run if it can

maintain its recent success.
Stanford will have to prove itself
almost immediately with another stiff
test against UCLA on Friday, this
time in Los Angeles. Kickoff is slated
for 7 p.m. The Cardinal will also face
San Diego State again next weekend
in San Diego, Calif.

But for one of the first times this
year, Stanford came to play right out
of the gate. The Cardinal was clearly
the aggressor and dominated posses
sion early, creating a few good oppor
tunities in the first 15 minutes as the
Bruins looked overwhelmed.
The breakthrough came in the 23rd
minute when sophomore midfielder
Dersu Abolfathi dribbled through a
defender and into the box, only to be
brought down before he could get a
shot off. The referee signaled for a
penalty kick, and senior defender and
captain Bobby Warshaw calmly
stepped up and slotted the ball into
the corner for the early 1-0 lead.
The goal seemed to energize the
Bruins, however, as they picked up the
pace and settled in. UCLA ended up
outshooting the Cardinal 8-5 in the
half, even though most of the shots
were relatively harmless from the
outside. Redshirt freshman goalkeep
er Galen Perkins was forced into two
saves and cleaned up several corner
kicks and crosses into the box.
Perkins and the back four were up
to the challenge, and the game re
mained 1-0 at half time. UCLA came
out like gangbusters to open the sec
ond half, fighting for every ball and
pinning the Cardinal in its own half.
Perkins was repeatedly challenged
and made three saves in the first 20
minutes.
"Galen's done very well for us,"
Abolfathi said. "[lnjured goalie Jason
Dodson's] shoes are pretty hard to fill,
but he's done it well. He has shown
the ability to keep us in games with his

saves, and he has distributed the ball
well to start the attack."
It took a first-class effort from
UCLA freshman standout Kelyn
Rowe to beat Perkins. Rowe took a
pass from Ryan Hollingshead in the
73rd minute and carried it straight up
the middle of the field before taking a
shot that bent past the diving Perkins
and into the upper left-hand corner
for the equalizer.

The Bruins continued to press for
the game-winner, but Perkins
stopped several shots in the final 15
minutes to keep Stanford level.
With five minutes to play, Abol
fathi and sophomore forward Adam
Jahn returned as substitutes and
made an impact almost instantly. Ju
nior forward Taylor Amman flicked a
ball in the middle of the field to Jahn,
who played it on to a streaking Abol
fathi. One-on-one with the keeper,
the young midfielder placed a shot in
side the left post to set off a wild cele
bration at Laird Q. Cagan Stadium.
"I literally just stepped on the
field, and you can hear him [the PA
announcer] announcing my name [as
a substitute] in the film of the goal,"
Abolfathi said. "Taylor did well to
flick it, and Adam used his body to
open the gap for me. It was simple, but
I'll take it."

The Cardinal had to work hard to
avoid a letdown against San Diego
State (7-5-1, 1-4) two days later, but

SIMON WARBY/The Stanford Daily
Redshirt freshman goalkeeper Galen Perkins, above, helped carry Stanford to a pair of victories over the weekend.
Perkins has shined since being pressed into duty because of an injury to starter Jason Dodson.

Perkins was up to the challenge. In
the freshman's fourth career game, he
stopped six shots and earned his sec
ond shutout.
Warshaw said that he felt in the pre
season that Perkins was destined to
make a positive impact on the team.
"I sat down with Galen before the
East Coast trip, and you could just tell
he would help us from the way he
handled being in a difficult situation
[as the backup goalkeeper] and just
his approach," Warshaw said. "He is a
great guy who shows up and works
hard every day.
"No one on the team is surprised
with how well he has done," he added.
For all their offensive troubles, the
Aztecs did stymie the Cardinal of
fense in the first half. Their use of an
offside trap caught Stanford's attack
ers eight times in the first 45 minutes.
But San Diego State was done in
when it failed to cover senior defend
er Cameron Lamming in the 78th
minute. Lamming headed a corner
kick from junior midfielder Clayton
Holz into the net for his first goal of
the year, and the defense held firm to
complete the weekend sweep.
The season-opening four-game
losing streak looks to be a thing of the
past as the Cardinal hits the midpoint
of the Pac-10 season firmly in the
thick of things. The team sits in prime
position to make a deep run if it can

maintain its recent success.
Stanford will have to prove itself
almost immediately with another stiff
test against UCLA on Friday, this
time in Los Angeles. Kickoff is slated
for 7 p.m. The Cardinal will also face
San Diego State again next weekend
in San Diego, Calif.
