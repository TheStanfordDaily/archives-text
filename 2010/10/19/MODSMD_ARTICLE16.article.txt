# Water polo splits with So-Cal foes
## 
### DASH DAVIDSON 
Trying to follow up on its impressive victo
ry over USC last weekend at Avery Aquatic
Center, the No. 4 Stanford men's water polo
team (8-5,2-1 MPSF) found mixed success on
its trip to southern California last weekend.
The trip featured two games a Friday night
affair at No. 3 UCLA and a Sunday afternoon
game against No. 6 UC-Santa Barbara. Stan
ford fell to UCLA, but managed to pull out a
win over the Gauchos.
The UCLA match, the second meeting this
season between the Cardinal and the Bruins,
was a back-and-forth contest neither team
could pull away. The game, which the Bruins
ended up winning 9-8, was tied six different
times, and save for two brief instances, the two
squads were never more than a goal apart.
The critical stretch of the game occurred, fit
tingly for such a tight contest, in the final three
minutes. With 2:56 left in the final quarter, Stan
ford senior driver Jeffrey Schwimer netted a
clutch goal that gave the Cardinal an 8-7 lead.
Though it was coming off a string of strong
performances, the Cardinal defense could not
back up this slim margin, allowing two hard
fought goals by the Bruins in the final minutes,
with the game-clincher taking place with a
mere 50 seconds left on the clock.
Sunday saw the Stanford squad swiftly skip

up the coast to do battle with UC-Santa Bar
bara. This game featured less drama than Fri
day's contest, but it was still a close one, with
the Cardinal winning 8-6.
Stanford took advantage of a high number
of Gaucho penalties, converting on several
key mismatch situations three goals came
courtesy of penalty shots with an additional
two occurring via an imbalanced six-on-five
situation. Discipline and execution were the
difference in this game, but the Cardinal was
able to exact revenge on the UCSB squad that
had handed them a defeat on Sept. 18 in the

NorCal Invitational.
With this win over UCSB, the Cardinal was
able to remain in third place in the highly com
petitive Mountain Pacific Sports Federation
(MPSF) standings, behind California and UC-
Irvine, who each boast perfect 2-0 conference
records.
For the weekend, Stanford tallied 16 goals
scored by: team captain and senior driver Sage
Wright (four); junior driver Jacob Smith
(four); Schwimer (three); senior driver Paul
Rudolph (two); senior driver Travis Noll
(one); junior utility Peter Sefton (one) and

redshirt freshman driver lan Gamble (one).
Redshirt junior goalie Brian Pingree recorded
15 saves, playing as the reigning MPSF player
of the week.
Next up for the Cardinal is the alumni
game, to be played on Saturday at Avery
Aquatic Center in honor of Homecoming
Weekend. After that, the team travels down to
Malibu for a contest versus Pepperdine on
Sunday.
