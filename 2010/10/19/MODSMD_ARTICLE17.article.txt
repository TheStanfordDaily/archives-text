# Card drops two of three
## 
### NICK SU 
No. 20 Stanford (9-6,3-1 NorPac) sawmixed
results this past weekend as it traveled to the
other side of the country, playing three match
es in four days against a trio of East Coast
teams. Despite a strong offensive effort, the
Cardinal finished its East Coast tour with one
win and two losses, with both defeats coming in
overtime.
The weekend began with the Cardinal tak
ing on No. 8 Syracuse (10-4) on Friday morning
in Albany, N.Y. In a highly contested match,
Stanford took a 1-0 lead after the first half, with
a goal by sophomore defender Becky Dra off a
stop by junior forward Stephanie Byrne and a
push by sophomore forward Kelsey Lloyd.
With seven penalty corners and six shots, Syra
cuse was unable to notch any goals on the Card
in the first half.
But Syracuse would strike back in the final
minutes of the second half, equalizing the score
at one point apiece off a penalty corner shot by
Syracuse attacker Amy Kee in the 60th minute
of play. The Orange would go on to win the
match, 2-1, in overtime.
The loss on Friday snapped a three-game
winning streak for the Cardinal. Furthermore,
the loss also broke a seven-game string of over
time victories for Stanford, with the team's last
overtime defeat coming more than two years
ago.
Although Stanford outshot Syracuse 17-12,
a total of six saves by Syracuse goalkeeper
Rachel Sayer kept the Cardinal offense in
check. Syracuse also held a 12-7 advantage in
penalty corners.
The Cardinal squad was able to rebound in
its next game against a struggling Rutgers (6-
10) team on Sunday. Stanford took an early 1-0
lead in the first period when a deflected shot by
sophomore forward Katie Mitchell found its
way to the back of the net for her first goal of
the season. Coming off the bench in the second
half, senior forward Katherine Swank sealed
Stanford's victory by putting up a goal in the

40th minute, giving the Cardinal a 2-0 lead. De
spite a goal by Rutgers' Kat Rodziewicz in the
60th minute, Swank would score once again
moments later off of an assist by Dru to ensure
a Stanford win.
The Cardinal once again outshot its oppo
nents, with an 11-7 shot advantage and a 5-2
edge in penalty corners. Junior goalkeeper
Alessandra Moss held the Scarlet Knights to
only one goal in the 3-1 Cardinal victory and
came out of the match with six saves.
Elowever, the difficulty of playing three
road games in four days showed in the final
match against Northeastern in Boston, just
one day after the Cardinal played Rutgers. In
a very physical contest, the Northeastern de
fense refused to yield to Stanford's offensive
efforts, keeping the Cardinal scoreless in the
first half of play despite being outshot 14-5 in
the opening period. Stanford would score
early in the second half on a penalty corner
converted by Dru, again assisted by Byrne
and Lloyd.
But once more, Stanford let its opponents
score late in the game. A shot by Northeastern's
Crystal Poland tied the score in the 57th minute
and pushed the match into overtime, where a
quick goal by Nicky Graham ended the game
for a 2-1 Northeastern victory. It also gave Stan
ford its second overtime loss of the season.
While Stanford maintained a staggering 25-
15 edge in shots and an 8-4 advantage in penal
ty corners, Northeastern goalkeeper Lizzie
Priest had 13 saves in comparison to just seven
for Stanford's Moss.
The Cardinal has outshot its opponents in
12 of the 14 games it has played this season, but
has had difficulty coming out on top in close
matches, with all five of its losses marked by
one-point margins.
Stanford's next game will be a conference
match against Pacific (2-11) this Sunday at 1
p.m. on Varsity Turf. It will be Stanford's last
home game of the season.
