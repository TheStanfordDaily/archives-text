# Sixth Man Club will be free
## 
### CAROLINE CASELLI DESK EDITOR 
With only a few days of practice under its belt,
the Stanford men's basketball team already has one
major change to announce for the year ahead
admission for all students to the Sixth Man section
for the 2010-2011 season will be free of charge, ac
cording to the director of the Sixth Man Club. Pre
viously the only Stanford sport that required stu
dents to purchase tickets, men's basketball games
will now be accessible to all students with an SUID.
While members of the Sixth Man Committee
have had distant hopes of a cost-free student sec
tion, it was the diligence of head coach Johnny
Dawkins that finally enabled the change to tran
spire, said Joel Sandler 'll, club director.
"It was something always thrown around as a
way to make the section as inclusive as possible, but
it was difficult for us to make happen as students,"
said Sandler in an e-mail to The Daily. "It took
Coach Dawkins pushing for this change to make it
a reality. Since coming to Stanford, he has been a
huge supporter of the student section and made nu
merous efforts to reach out to us fans."

Space has not been an issue for students hoping
to stand in the Sixth Man section for the past sever
al seasons for the most part, students could ar
rive at tip-off and receive a decent spot to stand
but with the new admission policy, students are en
couraged to arrive at games well in advance.
In addition, the Sixth Man plans to implement a
loyalty points system, similar to the Red Zone sys
tem, which will reward attendance at the preseason
games in the fall with priority to the lower section
for the Pac-10 games in the winter. Though some
students may be guaranteed better seats with the

point system, the Sixth Man Club expects to house
all students who come out, even if it means getting
creative.
"While the Sixth Man has had some tremendous
student turnouts in the past, with these changes in
place, we may have to find additional sections of
Maples Pavilion to expand to," Sandler said. "Know
that we are committed to not turning any student
away."

In the past, the Sixth Man section has offered nu
merous incentives to boost student attendance and
reward its paying members, including free shirts,
Chipotle burritos, posters, barbecues and hand tow
els. Although Sixth Man membership will now be
extended to the entire student body, Sandler is con
fident that the benefits will remain.

"A major thing that concerned me about the sec
tion being free was that our members might lose
some of the great perks to cover the loss of ticket
revenue," he said. "The exciting part about the
change, though, is that it is backed by some very
generous donors, who care about rewarding our
fans. We will be greatly expanding our perk system

this year with door prizes for every student that
comes early, great raffles [like] trips to Vegas and, of
course, food."
Additionally, students who have already pur
chased their Sixth Man memberships for the com
ing season will receive their money back in full and
also qualify for added goodies, as a thank you for
their loyalty to the team.
"We will refund them, and if they put the charge
on their University bill, we will remove it," Sandler
explained. "We will also issue them cards granting
special deals and giveaways on game days such as
first choice of seating and sweet raffle prizes
think iPad! The message we want to send is that we
appreciate your love of Stanford basketball."
Sandler, currently a co-term, hopes that with the
free student admission, this year's Sixth Man sec
tion will be reminiscent of the jam-packed student
sections that he remembers from his first couple of
years on the Farm.
"My single favorite Stanford memory is being at
Maples Pavilion when Stanford came back from a
17-point deficit to beat 18-1 UCLA my freshman
year," he recalled. "Imagine over 800 students
standing courtside, screaming, jumping, taunting,
crowd-surfing and most importantly, helping our
team overcome. This is the environment Coach
Dawkins, our donors and the athletic department
want to create at Maples Pavilion, and these are the
kinds of memories I know we can make this year."
Jeff LaMere from Stanford Athletics' men's bas
ketball operations and several members of the
team were contacted for comment, but were unable
to be reached prior to the time of publication.

The Sixth Man will be free to all students this basketball season, says the club director. Crowds in recent years have been smallerthan desired, and the Sixth Man Club hopes that
free admission to games will encourage more student support of the men's basketball team. The first home game is the Cardinal-White scrimmage on Saturday.
