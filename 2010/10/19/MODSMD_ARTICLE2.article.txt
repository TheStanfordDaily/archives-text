## Med School to conduct flu vaccine trials Trials will help researchers gain insight into flu vaccine 
### KATHERINE NABEL 
With flu season now underway, researchers at the
Stanford University School of Medicine are explor
ing vaccines for influenza infection, commonly
known as the flu, more than ever before.
Medical Director of Lucile Packard Children's
Hospital vaccine program Cornelia Dekker and her
team of researchers are conducting three different flu
vaccine trials this fall. These experiments are part of a
five-year National Institutes of Health grant to gain a
more thorough understanding of the common flu.
The first two trials will compare the reaction of
young and elderly persons as well as identical and
fraternal twins to the seasonal flu vaccine. Enroll
ment for the studies began this September after the
licensed flu vaccine became available. Dekker is
hoping to complete enrollment by Thanksgiving.
A third vaccine trial that will study influenza re
sponse in subjects with mitochondrial encephalomy
opathy, lactic acidosis and MELAS syndrome is also
being conducted. Dekker's team will compare the
local and systemic reactions to the seasonal flu shot
to assess vaccine safety. In addition, they hope to
compare the metabolic responses in patients with
the MELAS mutation to determine if their immune
systems react differently than those of healthy con
trols.
"All of these studies will help us understand bet
ter how genetics, age and mitochondrial disease af
fect the immune response to flu vaccine," Dekker
wrote in an e-mail to The Daily. "It's possible that we
may identify factors that could help to diagnose in
fluenza infection earlier and improve existing in
fluenza vaccines."
According to the Center for Disease Control, an
estimated 25 to 50 million cases of influenza virus
were reported last year in the United States alone.
The flu, a contagious respiratory illness, can cause se
vere symptoms of fever, fatigue, muscle aches and
coughing. The only way to prevent influenza virus is
to get a flu vaccine every year.The flu shot is now rec
ommended annually for everyone older than six
months.
Study participants will be compensated for their
visits in addition to receiving a free seasonal flu vac
cine.
Dekker strongly encourages all who are eligible
for her team's studies to consider participating. This
includes all identical and fraternal twins (ages 18 to
30), all non-twins (ages 18 to 30) who did not receive
the HINI vaccine last year and carriers of the
MELAS mutation (ages 13 to 60).
"Because there is such wide availability of flu vac
cine this year, we're in a race against time to identify
our volunteers before they get immunized else
where," Dekker said.
Even for those who do not qualify for studies at
Stanford School of Medicine, JooHee Ahn 'll, a peer
health educator for Stern Hall, recommends that all
Stanford students get a flu shot this year.
"I know a lot of students are probably not both
ering to go get their flu vaccines because they're
busy," Ahn said. "It's true! As Stanford students,
we're all busy with classes, homework and activities.
But what people don't realize is that in order for us
to be time-efficient, the most important thing is our
health."
Vaden Health Center is offering flu shots this
fall to the Stanford community. They are free for
students and University employees, and $25 for all
others. Students from the Stanford School of Med-

icine will be assisting in the adminis
tration of influenza vaccines, which
will occur on select Wednesday
evenings this October and Novem
ber.
"Being sick is the most time-con
suming thing at Stanford. You can't
study, you can't be active, you can't re
ally do anything," Ahn said. "Getting
the flu vaccine is a great way to pre
vent this."
