# Debaters talk effects of Prop. 23
## Four different speakers bring a variety of perspectives to the debate surrounding California Prop. 23 
### STEVEN SMALLBERG 
In preparation for the approaching Nov.
2 California general election, the Stanford
Solar and Wind Energy Project (SWEP)
hosted a debate on California Proposition
23 Monday in the Yang and Yamazaki En
vironment and Energy Building.
If passed, Prop. 23 would suspend As
sembly Bill 32 (AB 32), the Global Warm
ing Solutions Act, which currently man
dates that California's greenhouse gas
emissions must return to 1990 levels by
2020. The suspension would remain in ef
fect until the state's unemployment rate,
which was at 12.4 percent as of August, ac
cording to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statis
tics, drops to or below 5.5 percent for four
consecutive quarters.
Guest speakers Anita Mangels, commu
nications director for the Yes on 23 cam
paign, and Miles Barber of the Santa Clara
Chamber of Commerce spoke in support of
the proposition. Stanford professors Larry
Goulder, chair of the economics depart
ment, and Mark Jacobson, director of the
Atmosphere and Energy Program, repre
sented the opposition.
The speakers represented a wide diver
sity of backgrounds. Mangels focused
largely on the economic aspect of the po
tential suspension of AB 32, citing signifi
cant growth of the employment rate and
emphasizing that while global warming re

mains a serious issue, California's weak
economy prevents addressing it at this
time.
Barber spoke primarily from the small
business viewpoint, having started seven
businesses himself. He criticized opponents

of Prop. 23 as being overly idealistic, em
phasizing the severe disadvantages small
businesses would face with the proposi
tion's overturn.
Goulder spoke about the economy from
an academic point of view, citing a study

that he chaired that analyzed three major
economic models. He concluded that the
potential unemployment figures cited by
the Yes on 23 campaign were grossly over
stated and that California could act as a
"laboratory" for climate change policy and
could hasten national or international ac
tion.

Finally, Jacobson addressed the proposi
tion from a public-health point of view. He
made reference to statistics regarding
"CO2 domes" over major Californian
cities. He cited several studies that show
that domes increase ozone and particulate
matter (PM) deaths in the United States by
300 to 1,000 per year and that every 10 mi
crograms of PM per cubic meter reduce
lifespan by up to 1.6 years.
"A vote for Prop. 23 is a vote to shorten
your own life and to damage the lives of
other people in the state," Jacobson said.
After the panelists spoke and offered
their rebuttals, they accepted written ques
tions from the audience.

The debate progressed smoothly, but
some students were critical of the speakers'
conventionally political rhetoric.
"I came in relatively uninformed about
this issue, and I don't think the debate
changed that too much," said second-year
electrical engineering graduate student
Jake Matlick. "The speakers were clearly

informed, but I could have done
without the emotional and political
fluff on both sides of the argument."
Third-year management science
and engineering graduate student
Ahren Lacy agreed that the debate
lacked direct explanation.
"The speakers gave us plenty of
statistics, but not enough context be
hind them," he said. "Everyone val
ues their health and the environ
ment. Everyone values their pock
ets. What we have to decide is
whether [Prop. 23] is the most effec
tive way to preserve both."
Though Matlick's and Lacy's crit
icism of the debate was directed at
both sides of the argument, they ac

knowledged an apparent bias in the
audience that seemed to favor the
opposition to Prop. 23.
"There was substantially more
murmuring while the proponents [of
Prop. 23] were speaking," Lacy said.
The audience was much more dis
content with [Barber's] 'leave us
alone' argument and seemed more
comfortable with the academic set
ting [established by Goulder and Ja
cobson]."
He acknowledged, however, that
a bias among the audience was like
ly inevitable.
"The average Stanford student is
probably wealthier ... than the av
erage citizen and would probably be
willing to pay a little more for C 02,"
he said. "And that's a perfectly valid
point of view."
