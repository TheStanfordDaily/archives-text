## Treasury secretary criticizes Chinese exchange-rate policy 
### DEVIN BANERJEE SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner
was in Palo Alto Monday with a simple
message for Silicon Valley: Washington has
more work to do to repair the U.S. econo
my, and it is in the process of doing it.
But the direction of the 49-year-old's
Q&A session at the Commonwealth Club of
California was quickly pulled away from his
defense of the administration's economic
policy toward the more salient issue of global
trade, specifically China's alleged manipula
tion of its currency to gain export advantages.
The value of the Chinese yuan is a hot
button issue in Washington, where the
Treasury Department announced Friday it
was delaying a scheduled report on China's
exchange-rate policies. Geithner said his
department is holding the report until after
the Group of 20 finance ministers meets
next month in South Korea, where U.S. del
egates hope to mobilize support behind a

set of improvements to China's currency
practices.

"How much do you feel the Chinese
currency is undervalued today?" modera
tor Michael Moritz, a partner at Menlo
Park-based Sequoia Capital, flatly asked
Geithner on Monday.
The Treasury secretary, who spent most
of his childhood abroad, maintained his tra
ditionally aggressive stance toward the
world's largest country, digging into
China's "unfair" and "damaging" policies.
"By almost any measure, it [the yuan] is
significantly undervalued, more so than is
true of any major significant emerging mar
ket currency," Geithner said. "It's not ten
able for China long-term, and it's unfair to
all of China's trading partners, America
and others. It just creates a playing field
that's off-balance."
He added: "It's very damaging to what's
very important to everyone: the sense that
we operate in a world where people play by
a set of consistent rules of the game,"

Geithner noted that the yuan rose about
20 percent in value between 2005 and 2008
and three percent in recent months. "We
want to see that process continue," he said.
"And how far would you like to see it
go?" Moritz asked.
Geithner issued a one-word response:
"Higher."
In California
Moritz, a former director at Google,
Pay Pal and Yahoo, also indulged Monday's
Silicon Valley audience by taking the con
versation with the Treasury secretary to
state and local economic challenges.
Referencing cities like Vallejo, Calif.,
which filed for bankruptcy in 2008, Moritz
said the crisis many people see looming
"right in front of the windshield" will come
from mounting financial obligations that
are encumbering state and local govern
ments. A domino effect of city bankrupt
cies, Moritz said, could be more disruptive
than the subprime mortgage crisis.

"It's going to take quite a bit of time still
for states to get back to the point where
they feel they know how to finance the
basic needs that only governments can
meet," Geithner said. "The Recovery Act
reduced local risk ... but it didn't fill the
hole completely. We've found it actually
quite hard."
The solution is not to depend on Wash
ington, Geithner said, but to build political
consensus locally about how limited re
sources should be allocated. "It's not a fi
nancial challenge; it's a political choice," he
said.
During the course of the hour-long ses
sion, Geithner, a father of two, including
Elise Geithner *l3, continually referred
back to "educating our children" as one his
own personal priorities for state and local
governments.
One hope for Geithner is infrastructure
development. Asked whether California's
proposed high-speed rail system,
which would require a sizable chunk
of its proposed $4O billion-plus cost
from Washington, would affect the
nation's unemployment rate, Geith
ner said it would only put more peo
ple to work.
"Investment in public infrastruc
ture, in transportation, is a good in
vestment," he said. "Our govern
ment doesn't do it perfectly, but it's a
very good strategy ... and it has the
benefit of getting some of the peo
ple hardest hit by the recession back
to work more quickly."
