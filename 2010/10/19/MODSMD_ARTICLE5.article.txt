## Stanford law, business schools rank high Princeton Review grades class-room experience, selectivity 
### HENRY ZHU 
The newly released 2011 edition of the Prince
ton Review's college rankings for law and busi
ness schools has given the Stanford Graduate
School of Business (GSB) and Law School (SLS)
especially good marks. The rankings report that
Stanford's business school is the hardest to get
into, while Stanford Law has the best "overall
classroom experience." The GSB placed second
for "career prospects" and seventh for best "cam
pus environment."
The Princeton Review rankings were based on
surveys of 18,000 students attending 172 law
schools and 19,000 students attending 300 busi
ness schools, as well as on school-reported data.
The 80-question survey asked students about
themselves and their career plans, as well as their
school's academics, student body and campus life.
Though Stanford earned high rankings, the
Law School and GSB generally measure their
merits in other ways.
"As a matter of policy, we don't comment on
rankings," wrote Judith Romero, a spokesperson
for Stanford Law School, in an e-mail to The


LAN GARCIA-DOTY/The Stanford Daily
The Stanford Law School received the highest ranking in the "classroom experience" category of recent Princeton Review rankings.
