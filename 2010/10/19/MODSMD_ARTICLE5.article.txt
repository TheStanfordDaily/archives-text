## Stanford law, business schools rank high Princeton Review grades class-room experience, selectivity 
### HENRY ZHU 
The newly released 2011 edition of the Prince
ton Review's college rankings for law and busi
ness schools has given the Stanford Graduate
School of Business (GSB) and Law School (SLS)
especially good marks. The rankings report that
Stanford's business school is the hardest to get
into, while Stanford Law has the best "overall
classroom experience." The GSB placed second
for "career prospects" and seventh for best "cam
pus environment."
The Princeton Review rankings were based on
surveys of 18,000 students attending 172 law
schools and 19,000 students attending 300 busi
ness schools, as well as on school-reported data.
The 80-question survey asked students about
themselves and their career plans, as well as their
school's academics, student body and campus life.
Though Stanford earned high rankings, the
Law School and GSB generally measure their
merits in other ways.
"As a matter of policy, we don't comment on
rankings," wrote Judith Romero, a spokesperson
for Stanford Law School, in an e-mail to The

The Stanford Law School received the highest ranking in the "classroom experience" category of recent Princeton Review rankings.
Daily. "What's important is that stu
dents find the right school for
them."
Second-year law student Dan
Corbett echoed Romero's feelings
about the rankings.
"Sure it's fun, and it kind of feels
good, but it doesn't really matter to
big decisions, because you don't get
enough information just from that
one number," Corbett said. "It
might matter to employers when
you're talking about big differences
in the ranking, but otherwise, it's not
really a big deal."
Corbett did agree with what the
numbers themselves indicated.
"The people here are friendly
and supportive, and I haven't seen
any evidence to the rumors of back
stabbing and getting ahead of peo
ple that occurs at law schools," Cor
bett said about his classroom experi
ence. "Here, there's a good collabo
rative sense of helping each other
study. There are fantastic teachers
who really know the material and
really care about the students and
their education."
According to Madhav Raj an,
senior associate dean for academic
affairs at the GSB, Stanford has the
smallest business program in the
world with fewer than 400 enrolled
students. In comparison, the class
sizes at Harvard Business School
and the Wharton School are about
900 and 800, respectively. Stanford
has a unique competitive advantage
in attracting the very best students
in that its curriculum has no fixed
classes and instead matches stu
dents with the classes they want to
take. This helps match the students'
interests with the faculty's interests,
Rajan said.
"The GSB is very good with in
novation and pedagogy," he said. "It
encourages experimentation in
terms of courses, and many courses
are based directly on faculty re
search."

"A lot of schools do care about
the rankings, so it may just be a Stan
ford issue that people here don't
care as much and pay far less atten
tion," Rajan said.
Rajan was previously a professor
at the Wharton School, where he felt
rankings such as Business Week and
U.S. News & World Report were
heavily scrutinized.
"We would worry instead about
no longer being able to recruit the
students we want to recruit," he said.
"This could happen if students think
Stanford is no longer changing with
the times, but that is actually where
Stanford shines the most: its flexibili
ty and innovation."
