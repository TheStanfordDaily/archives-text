## SWINGING WITH RHYTHM Swingtime puts a spin on traditional Lindy Hop, focusing on performance 
### ANNA ROSALES 
Swingtime dancers make their
way into Studio 52 on a Tues
day night, perhaps after a typ
ically busy day, leaving be
hind papers and problem
sets. They greet each other with a kind
of unguarded openness that only
comes from countless hours spent re
hearsing and dancing together. Be
fore rehearsal officially starts, a cou
ple or two practice swing variations
effortlessly, while others lace up their
two-toned swing shoes and slip into
skirts that woosh when they spin.
Then the music starts, and it's
showtime, even during rehearsal.
With every step, swivel and swish, the
energy and excitement in the room
seems to go up a notch, as if everyone
had a healthy dosage of caffeine be
fore rehearsal.
There is no audience, and yet every
single dancer is grinning from ear to
ear, hamming it up and having a blast.
And it's not just for show.
"It's impossible to do swing and
not be happy," said member Rachel
Liaw 'll.
Swingtime is Stanford's premier
Lindy Hop dance group and focuses
on performance.
"We dance a different sort of
Lindy Hop from social dance Lindy
Hop," Liaw said. "It's more about the
performance we look at the audi
ence and not our partner."
Swingtime came out of the Vintage
Dance Ensemble led by social dance
instructor Richard Powers. When the
Vintage Dance Ensemble broke up in
2000, some of its alumni decided to
put together a classic Lindy Hop
dance group with Powers as the advi
sor. This year, Swingtime is coming up
on its 10th anniversary.
Monchette Gonda 'l2, this year's
artistic director, explained that the
group's overall style is largely deter
mined by the director's vision.
"Last year, there was a diverse col
lection of styles," Gonda said. The
group has a wide-ranging repertoire
of pieces, including popular routines
from past years and newer, more ex
perimental choreography that fuses
elements of hip-hop with swing.
Last year, the group choreo
graphed a piece to "American Idiot"
by Green Day that featured updated
swing moves and even incorporated
the Macarena.

"This year, we're aiming for clean,
sleek choreography. We also don't
have a piece that doesn't have high
energy and excitement," Gonda said.
A lot of practice goes into achiev
ing that clean, sleek look. In Swing
time, couples are not set or predeter
mined, which means that dancers
have to be ready to switch partners for
any given performance. The dancers
feel that they benefit from this chal
lenge.
"In social dance classes, they have
you rotate. If you only dance with one
person, you can never dance with any
one else," Liaw said.
It is during more complicated vari
ations like aerials that partners have
to be especially aware of each other.
"When you switch partners, you
have to adjust your style. Each person
prefers different tension and lands
differently," explained Paul Csonka, a
graduate student in mechanical engi
neering.
In order to deliver a seamless per
formance, dancers devote four hours
a week to rehearsing. Every perform
ance requires careful planning.
"For each performance, we have to
figure out who's performing, who's
dancing with who, and we have to fig
ure out where everyone is going to
be," Gonda said. "But it's fun. It's like
playing matchmaker."
Though dancers are under pres

sure to perform, rehearsals are kept
carefree and fun. Members view the
four hours as a much-needed stress
relief.
"As a group, we love dancing, and
rehearsal, as a result, is pretty light
hearted," Liaw said. "We like to goof
off, and it never feels like a chore."
"It's a study break a time to de
stress and learn some awesome cho
reography," Gonda added.
The group's cohesion on the stage
is a reflection of its dancers' cama
raderie.
"There's a strong sense that we
have a strong connection on a person
al level, because we 're all really happy
and it shows," said Han Hye-Jung 'll.
Recently, Swingtime was invited to
audition for a new talent competition
series called Live to Dance pro
duced by Paula Abdul and scheduled
to air on CBS though the group
chose not to attend due to schedule
conflicts. The dancers are, however,
planning to expand to different ven
ues outside Stanford this year, includ
ing the Bay Area and southern Cali
fornia.
Swingtime performs year-round at
both on- and off-campus events. Its
next performance is on Friday night at
the Fall Ball.
