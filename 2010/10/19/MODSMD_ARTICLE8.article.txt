# Professor Snapshot

### 
The Daily e-mailed faculty a short questionnaire that
strayed beyond their work at Stanford. Here is a glimpse
into the personalities behind your professors.
Claire Jarvis
Hometown: Shelby, N.C.
Undergrad: UNC-Chapel Hill, English and Cre
ative Writing Major
Grad school: Boston University, master's in poet
ry; Johns Hopkins, Ph.D. in English literature
Hobbies: I have pretty elaborate cooking projects,
but I also like seeing art of all kinds, so I spend a lot
of time in galleries and at concerts.
#1 on your play list: I like the new Nite Jewel EP,
"Am I Real?" and the new Thee Oh Sees LP, "Warm
Slime." I'm curious to hear the new Kanye West
the songs on his website have been fascinating I
think he's a real formalist!
Currently reading: I just picked up the first vol
ume of Anthony Powell's "A Dance to the Music of
Time," which is my favorite kind of leisure reading
the comic/realist novel.
Favorite book: "Wuthering Heights"
You wouldn't mind being a character in: I'd
like to channel the narrating Werner Herzog, but I
don't think I have the accent or the idiosyncrasy
down, so let's say I've felt like a character in "Freaks
and Geeks" more times than I want to say.
If you could live in any time period, it
would be: The near future
You have never: Learned to drive
If you hadn't gone into academia, you'd
be: Before going to graduate school, I worked as a
book designer, though my fictional alternative career
would be "musicjournalist."
Department: English

Classes Taught: I'm cur
rently co-teaching Medievalisms with Michelle
Karnes and leading a seminar on The Marriage Plot.
In the winter quarter, I'll be re-teaching Victorian Sex
and developing a new class, The Major Victorian
Novel.
Primary research interest/project: The manu
script I'm working on focuses on a character system
prevalent in the 19th-century novel, the sexualized (but
unmarried) dyad made up of a strong, imperious
woman and an enthralled, submissive man. I suggest
that the cultural currency of this pairing alters as
woman's status in the social and political world
changes and, more, that it offers a useful formal lens
through which we can seethe centrality of the sexual to
the novel's marriage plot. In other words, by focusing
on these pairings, we begin to see the importance of
the sexual body in marriage plots that at first glance
focus on less embodied personal characteristics (like
character, temperament and complexity). This project
focuses on the British novel, from Emily Bronte to D. H.
Lawrence. I'm also interested in mid-20th-century
British comic realism and its tendency to mine 19th
century British literature as a body of knowledge.
