## EDITORIAL It's not too late to adopt a more responsible attitude toward drinking 
### 
This month, Residential Education
(ResEd) officials said they had put
housed fraternity Kappa Sigma on
provisional alcohol and party suspension for
conduct and possible policy violations dur
ing New Student Orientation.
Also this month, Nate Boswell, associate
director of ResEd on the Row, sent an e-mail
to all Row staff members asking them to be
extra vigilant that weekend because of the
"unusually high number of student medical
transports" this year.
And on Monday, Ralph Castro, manager
of the Substance Abuse Prevention Pro
gram at Vaden Health Center, said in the be
ginning weeks of fall quarter, 16 students
were transported to the hospital for alcohol
related incidents. It represents an increased
rate from the 61 total transports during the
2009-10 school year.
Combining this data with the rise in prob
lematic alcohol usage on campus from 2008
to 2009 (the most recent years for which data
is available) shows a disturbing trend emerg
ing. Does Stanford have a drinking problem?
Stanford's attitude toward alcohol use on
campus is unique. At our peer institutions,
the ban on underage drinking is strictly en
forced, leading to a culture of drinking be
hind closed doors.
On the Farm, officials repeat that the
University does not condone the breaking
of underage-drinking law. The controlled
substances and alcohol policy says as much.
Implicit "is the understanding that students
are responsible for making their own deci
sions and accepting the consequences of
those decisions," the University says.
But students and dorm staff tend to abide
by an unofficial "open-door policy," which
holds that some underage students will
choose to drink, and when they do, it is safer
they drink in a non-clandestine manner.
So students consume alcoholic beverages

in their rooms, with doors open, and general
ly do not fear hostility at the hands of their
dorm staffers. This is one of the reasons why
the Stanford freshmen-year experience is
virtually unsurpassed across the country.
Critics have decried this practice because
they believe it enables students to engage in
self-destructive behavior. Meanwhile, pro
ponents of this stance laud the University
and its functionaries for treating students as
responsible adults capable of making their
own decisions, helping to remove the stigma
that affects drinking at other universities.
What do recent events mean for the cam
pus social culture? Should sheriffs be sta
tioned on the Lower Row every Friday and
Saturday night? Should resident assistants
be held personally responsible for their resi
dents' actions? Should every student be re
quired to take AlcoholEdu again?
The editorial board thinks that these are
all extreme measures, but there is cause for
concern. The situation hasn't progressed to
the point that such actions are required at
this time, but if this trend continues, these
options might be on the table.
The editorial board believes that all Stan
ford students are capable of making their
own decisions and that they should be held
responsible for those decisions. It is disap
pointing that more students this year are
abusing this freedom, but it is not too late for
us as a campus to change direction and
adopt a more responsible attitude toward
drinking.
To the freshmen, most of whom are expe
riencing unprecedented levels of personal
freedom: knowing your limits is important,
and it is better to approach them slowly
rather than to pass and see them behind you.
To the upperclassmen: whether you like it or
not, students look to you as examples to fol
low, so please set a good one. We should be
able to sort this out on our own.
