## The
						Death of All Idealism

By far my favorite part of "The Social Net
work" was the line "And Stanford. It's
time for them to see this in Palo Alto."
The Facebook was great and all, but if Zucker
berg wanted to make it big, he had to go to Cal
ifornia, just like the gold rushers and aspiring
movie stars before him. Once again, Holly
wood reclaims its position as the destination
for excitement and dreams, a reclamation that
unfortunately becomes writer Aaron Sorkin's
biggest source of unintentional comedy in the
movie.
Either Sorkin didn't do his research, or he
just didn't care, because I found it quite incon
gruous to see the most boring college town in
the world represented as our hero's Island of
Circe. There's probably a reason that most of
those scenes take place inside the house. And
Stanford, which is home only to model-thin
coeds who all can afford apartments in Palo
Alto and crazy coked-out sorority parties. Just
where exactly Sean Parker went on campus to
have said parties that proved so alluring to
ruddy young Zuckerberg escapes me. Certain
ly not the Cowell Cluster; I'm pretty sure there
hasn't been an all-campus sorority party over
there to date.
All nitpicking aside though, Sorkin's charac
terization gratifies me. Even if I am four years
late to the party, I'm still finally at the place to
be. Even after all my requisite collegiate disil
lusionment, I still get jazzed to discover that
Steve Jobs and Eric Schmidt had lunch over at
Town and Country or that Mark Zuckerberg
goes to the Nuthouse. I've been to those
places! Moreover, the South Bay held enough
intrigue to prompt the founding of Valleywag,
America's first Silicon Valley gossip blog.They
could be talking about people I know!
Though if you desire the real story, just ask
the one of the many '05 alums making their
way back on campus this weekend. They en
tered college in 2001 and so are perhaps the
best witnesses to the transformative power
that Facebook held over us college students.
That was back when Facebook was, ahem, still
discovering its identity. People would actually
list their favorite movies; you could still indi
cate that you were interested in Random Play
and Whatever I Can Get instead of just Friend
ship and Networking, and people had no
qualms posting all their compromising photos.
If Inlovewith McHottie was attending Generic
Party, you could count on them to be there,
damn it. The lascivious dissolution of the pub

lic/private sphere, all behind the safety of the
Internet, was precisely the seduction, as movie
Zuckerberg freely admitted. That was the
Facebook of the man whose business card said,
"I'm the CEO, bitch."
My second favorite part of "The Social Net
work" was JT's speech to movie Zuckerberg
right before he goes into a business meeting in
his pajamas to curse them out. Hardwired into
many a brain, including mine, is an inherent
contempt for traditional authority and corpo
rate culture, which provides the fuel for the ro
mance of the tech scene with their company
wide excursions to Burning Man and permis
sion of cargo shorts at board meetings. It would
just be so cool to work there, though admitted
ly not cool enough for me to actually take any
CS classes.
What I love even more, though, is that this
unique culture is a direct product of Stanford,
the place always looking forward. Armed with

The Facebook was
great and all, but if
Zuckerberg wanted
to make it big, he had
to go to California.
