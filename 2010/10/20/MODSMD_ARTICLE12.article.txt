# LOOKING UP
## Small talk 
### Nina M. Chung 
Hi! How are you?
And this, dear readers, is the beginning of
a very unique conversation. Can you figure
out why?
... Once upon a time, I was convinced I
was bad at small talk. I remember being on
the tennis team during freshman and sopho
more years of high school, feeling horribly
dysfunctional. I couldn't understand why it
was so difficult for me to flow with the other
girls' conversations. It was the most basic
thing. What was wrong with me that I could
n't operate a simple chat about some person's
clothes/that ridiculous teacher/some shock
ing hook-up? They were the easiest things.
Events like New Student Orientation were
similar ordeals: brief, unnaturally people
dense spectacles where names fly like bullets
in the battle of quick! get-acquainted. I was
never at ease. I honestly didn't want to suffer
an overly friendly encounter with another
person who had just played the same scripted
scene with someone else a minute ago. Omi
nously, though, it seemed like conversational
prodigies abounded all around me.
So, for a long time, I was certain I lacked
the casual skills.
Now, I realize that what I actually hear the
most are dead dialogues between people who
will clearly forget them immediately after
they part. I hear the mechanic "Hey, how are
you." I hear the "Good!" response and the
"You?" and the echoed "Good, good." I hear
flat "Awws" volleyed back to unfortunate
news and automatic, toneless varieties of
"Good luck." It's too empty, too often.
It's not possible to genuinely care about
everyone else's life all the time,but we act like

it is. Maybe some think it's better to say any
thing rather than nothing at all lest we suf
fer the universally hated "awkward" phe
nomenon. Plus, it's true that not every conver
sation is the stuff of epic novels, of great
metaphors and philosophy. Ultimately, our
everyday encounters can't all be significantly
memorable yes, this is all undeniable. But
at the same time, if the conversation isn't
going to be real, what's really the point in pur
suing it? It feels like such a waste of breath to
pretend we care about someone else's hap
penings when we're not going to think twice
about it afterwards. Why the social self-lies?
Over time, my definition of "awkward"
has narrowed, my appreciation for silence
has soared, my love for honest people has
grown ... and my tolerance for self-justify
ing chitchat has hit rock bottom. I realized
how much I disliked being the victim of circu
lar conversations and assumed-answer ques
tions. So I stopped doing them to other peo
ple. And somehow, I hardly ever find myself
in those fake situations anymore.
When I'm curious about him, I'll talk to
the guy I don't know next to me in class.
When I see my hallmate in the bathroom in
the morning, I'll ask her about her day be
cause I hope she had a good one I would
n't wish anyone anything less. But, of course,

as I said before, it would be a complete lie if I
said that at all times, I have mental space to
consider someone else's circumstances. Or
that I can connect with everyone through in
terests we don't actually share. At those
times, though, I'm completely happy keeping
to myself. I used to be insecure I'd be consid
ered anti-social by someone who encoun
tered me in those moments ... until I real
ized that at that moment, yeah I didn't
want to talk. And doesn't that make so much
sense?! If I forced myself to just blurt out
whatever, it would be the most meaningless
conversation ever, and to me that's essential
ly a lie with a great smile. An old friend once
told me I was the most anti-social social per
son she knew ... and I like that possibility.
Thinking back on my former self-per
ceived bad small talk skills, I realize that it
was ultimately discomfort with pretending:
pretending I was into the topic of the mo
ment, pretending I was intrigued by some
one's house party mishaps, pretending I was
in a great mood when perhaps I was far from
it. But I avoid pretenders, and I don't ever
want to be one.
I'm sure that from the outside, some of my
conversations with people may look like
small talk about classes, or the summer, or
a movie. But for me, it's never small talk. I'm
not fond of small talk, and that means that if
I'm not interested, I'm not going to engage.
So when I've decided to ask you how you are,
I'd really like to know! In reality, it's a pretty
big question to ask, isn't it?

Well? How is your Wednesday going? Nina is
genuinely curious, because good days are great
and bad days can change. Let her know, at ni
