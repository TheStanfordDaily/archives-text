# OP-ED
## New general fees policies are inspired by principles 
### RAFAEL VASQUEZ '12, Chair of the Appropriations Committee MICHAEL CRUZ '12, Chair of the Undergraduate Senate STEWART MACGREGOR-DENNIS '13, Senate Treasurer 
Every Stanford student will be
affected by the implications of
this op-ed. The ASSU Under
graduate Senate funds over $300,000
in student programming each year,
giving students opportunities from
experiencing traditional Mexican
folk dance to playing Quidditch.
Every candidate in last year's elec
tions had something to say about Ap
propriations and student funding.
This week, the Appropriations
Committee of the 12th Undergradu
ate Senate is proud to finalize and
release the new General Fees poli
cies for the 2010-2011 academic year
(available at senate.stanford.edu).
After five months of dedication
including two all-campus town halls,
research into the process of student
funding, and meetings with financial
officers, student leaders, administra
tors, SSE staff and other ASSU stu
dent government officials the
committee has created a set of poli
cies that is based on student input,
collected financial data and the

work of previous Appropriations
Committees. These changes are
based around three basic principles:
increased communication, increased
programming and increased feed
back.
The Appropriations Committee's
first main initiative is to close the
communication gap between the
student body and the Undergradu
ate Senate. Each financial officer
(FO) of each voluntary student or
ganization (VSO) applying for gen
eral fees will be assigned a member
from the Appropriations Commit
tee to act as a liaison between that
particular VSO and the committee.
This liaison will answer questions
about funding, myGroups and the
ASSU student government, working
to stop problems and address issues
before they arise. The committee
will soon launch a Facebook profile,
which will serve as a more conven
ient and informal method for Stan
ford students to ask questions about
funding. Along with the recently re

vamped Senate website, the Appro
priations Committee will be able an
swer FO questions with a variety of
resources.
One huge change this year is that
the committee will be promoting
greater student programming by
funding events that would not usual
ly be funded via loans. These loans
will allow student groups to put on
more programming and float larger
upfront costs. This year, loans will be
issued to student groups after con
sideration of the committee's regu
lar policies along with the likelihood
that the group will be able to repay
the association. Student groups in
terested in pursuing this should con
tact the committee in advance.
The committee has stated one of
its major goals is to optimize the line
item amounts and caps based on
hard data and feedback. The Com
mittee now distinguishes between
line items (GL Codes) with three
terms: not funded, subsidy/capped
amount and fully funded. In the past,

this distinction has implicitly existed;
this year it will be explicitly outlined.
Furthermore, this year's committee
is incorporating economies of scale
into its funding policies in line with
the theory that buying in bulk is
cheaper per unit. Beyond this, the
committee has also formalized
retroactive funding, decided to fully
reimburse gas costs for community
service groups, and adjusting other
line items.
The newest Appropriations Com
mittee was formed five months ago.
We seek to be better than our past
and set the standard for future Ap
propriations Committees.
