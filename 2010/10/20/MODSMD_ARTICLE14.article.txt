## USC, not Cal, is now Stanford's biggest rival 
### Kabir Sawhney 
Rather than give a long
winded introduction, I'm
just going to come right
out and say it: USC is
now Stanford's biggest
rival. It has surpassed Cal as Enemy
No. 1 on the Farm, and rightly so.
Personally, I hate USC. I hate
everything about USC. I hate its fans,
who were quick to abandon the pro
gram as soon as it lost a couple of
games. I hate its marching band,
which decided to mock Stanford's
fight song at the last football game. I
hate its players, who are on the take
from agents and have difficult classes
on their schedule like ballroom
dance. I hate its fight song it's just
obnoxious. I hate how it has sub
sumed its academic integrity in order
to, in the words of Pete Carroll, "win
forever."

More broadly, USC personifies
everything that Stanford is not

hell, it's even in the name ( Southern
California). USC represents glamour
and Hollywood; Stanford has Bay
Area cool. USC exists to party; Stan
ford takes its academics seriously.
USC is located in bustling Los Ange
les; Stanford exists in tranquil Palo
Alto. Alumni from the Farm go on to
start innovative companies and take
leadership roles in society, while one
of USC's more famous alums found
ed Girls Gone Wild (which, coinci
dentally, features its fair share of
USC coeds) and ended up in prison.
Last but not least, even the mascots
betray big differences: Stanford's is a
color, while USC gets a condom
brand.

Of course, I'm not going to deny
that USC's run in the past decade as
the dominant football program on
the West Coast has something to do
with this phenomenon. Because the
Trojans were so good for so long, it
makes it that much more fun to see
its program in tatters, its reputation
tarnished by scandal and its on-field
product a laughable shadow of its
former self. It also makes us feel vin
dicated; we weren't as good as USC,
but at least Stanford (and the rest of
the Pac-10) didn't win by cheating.
However, even if USC hadn't
been quite as dominant, the Trojans
would have still evolved into Stan
ford's biggest rival. The vast majority
of college rivalries in the U.S. today
are based chiefly on history, and
Stanford's rivalry with Cal is no ex
ception. Stanford was founded
across the Bay from Berkeley, and
the two schools played their first
football game in 1892. The geograph
ical proximity of the two schools and
longstanding animosity are the pri
mary reasons why most still consider
Cal to be Stanford's biggest rival.
However, today Cal and Stanford
share a great deal more than they
once did, which has contributed to a

thaw of sorts. Though it might be
heresy on the Farm to say so out
loud, UC-Berkeley has an extremely
strong academic program some
of its departments even rival Stan
ford. It is undoubtedly the finest
public university in the U.S. and has
a geographically and culturally di
verse student body, its own fair share
of Nobel laureates and some of the
country's finest physics research labs
(the same ones used by the Manhat
tan Project).

Stanford and Cal also share a lot of
the same culture, even if Berkeley is a
little more "out there" than Palo Alto.
Stanford students don't seem to hold
any particular grudge against Cal stu
dents, and except in the week leading
up to Big Game, USC hatred is much
more manifest on campus than ani
mosity toward the Golden Bears.
That brings us to the final reason
why USC, not Cal, is Stanford's
biggest rival today: the differences in
each school's student body. Stanford
and Cal students share much more
than their counterparts in southern

California. USC is the type of school
that "Animal House" could have
been about; it is dominated by its fra
ternity scene, and while I'm sure
there are some USC students who
are concerned about actually getting
an education, it's not the prevailing
culture in Los Angeles. Stanford, on
the other hand, is your stereotypical
"nerd" school, and while some might
cringe at that characterization, I fully
embrace it. After all, I came to Stan
ford because of its academic pres
tige, and many students attend Cal
for the same reason.
In today's world, USC, not Cal, is
the antithesis of Stanford. It repre
sents everything that we are not, and
there is no shame in reveling more in
the Trojans' downfall than in the
Golden Bears' struggles. I look for
ward to the day when this rivalry is
finally recognized as one of college
football's best, not because of histor
ical hatred (although there is plenty
of that), but because of a genuine an
imosity that has exploded and pre
vails today.

Kabir Sawhney has never actually
watched Girls Gone Wild to know
about those USC coeds, of course. Send
him your favorite videos at ksawhney
