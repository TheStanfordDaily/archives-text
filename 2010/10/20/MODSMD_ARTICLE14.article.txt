## USC, not Cal, is now Stanford's biggest rival 
### Kabir Sawhney 
Rather than give a long
winded introduction, I'm
just going to come right
out and say it: USC is
now Stanford's biggest
rival. It has surpassed Cal as Enemy
No. 1 on the Farm, and rightly so.
Personally, I hate USC. I hate
everything about USC. I hate its fans,
who were quick to abandon the pro
gram as soon as it lost a couple of
games. I hate its marching band,
which decided to mock Stanford's
fight song at the last football game. I
hate its players, who are on the take
from agents and have difficult classes
on their schedule like ballroom
dance. I hate its fight song it's just
obnoxious. I hate how it has sub
sumed its academic integrity in order
to, in the words of Pete Carroll, "win
forever."

More broadly, USC personifies
everything that Stanford is not

hell, it's even in the name ( Southern
California). USC represents glamour
and Hollywood; Stanford has Bay
Area cool. USC exists to party; Stan
ford takes its academics seriously.
USC is located in bustling Los Ange
les; Stanford exists in tranquil Palo
Alto. Alumni from the Farm go on to
start innovative companies and take
leadership roles in society, while one
of USC's more famous alums found
ed Girls Gone Wild (which, coinci
dentally, features its fair share of
USC coeds) and ended up in prison.
Last but not least, even the mascots
betray big differences: Stanford's is a
color, while USC gets a condom
brand.

Of course, I'm not going to deny
that USC's run in the past decade as
the dominant football program on
the West Coast has something to do
with this phenomenon. Because the
Trojans were so good for so long, it
makes it that much more fun to see
its program in tatters, its reputation
tarnished by scandal and its on-field
product a laughable shadow of its
former self. It also makes us feel vin
dicated; we weren't as good as USC,
but at least Stanford (and the rest of
the Pac-10) didn't win by cheating.
However, even if USC hadn't
been quite as dominant, the Trojans
would have still evolved into Stan
ford's biggest rival. The vast majority
of college rivalries in the U.S. today
are based chiefly on history, and
Stanford's rivalry with Cal is no ex
ception. Stanford was founded
across the Bay from Berkeley, and
the two schools played their first
football game in 1892. The geograph
ical proximity of the two schools and
longstanding animosity are the pri
mary reasons why most still consider
Cal to be Stanford's biggest rival.
However, today Cal and Stanford
share a great deal more than they
once did, which has contributed to a
