# PAC-10 POWER RANKINGS
## 
### 
Every week, Jacob Jaffe will give his Pac-10 football power rankings. These represent a measure
of current success, not a prediction of future standings or a measure of talent.
1 Oregon (6-0, 3-0 Pac-10) UP NEXT: vs. UCLA (Thurs.)
CEven a bye week was successful for the Ducks, who ascended to the top spot of the
AP Poll for the first time in their history. Oregon is still fighting the computers, which
ranked the Ducks eighth. Having already played Washington State, Oregon's
strength of schedule should get better, but so will its opponents. A national title is now certain
ly plausible, but the Ducks have a ways to go.
2. Stanford (5-1,2-1 Pac-10) UP NEXT: vs. Washington State
The off week also gives the Cardinal a bump up to No. 2. Stanford still has several
tough games ahead, but so far the Cardinal appears to be solidly second in the con
mlH ference. The computers were kind to Stanford, ranking it 10th, ahead of Alabama
and Ohio State, but the Cardinal should keep its eyes on its own games and not on
the rankings. A Rose Bowl trip is still possible, but Stanford will need some help.
3. Arizona (5-1,2-1 Pac-10) UP NEXT: vs. Washington
LA J The Wildcats had a costly 17-point win over Washington State last weekend, losing
i£j\ starting quarterback Nick Foles to a knee injury. Arizona still looks like the third-best
l_j ■_] team in the Pac-10, but a Foles-less Arizona might not be. Matt Scott, Foles' replace
ment, started the first few games of 2009, so he should be serviceable. Depending on the
length of Foles' injury, the Wildcats could be shorthanded against Stanford and USC in early
November.
4. USC (5-2, 2-2 Pac-10) UP NEXT: Bye
✓r The Trojans were the biggest movers of the week, coming back from two last-second
losses with a vengeance. Cal was the unfortunate recipient of the USC beatdown, which
included five touchdowns from Matt Barkley in the first half. If the rest of the Pac-10
needed a reminder of how much talent the Trojans still possess, they sure got it. The
next team to face the rested and possibly rejuvenated Trojans will be No. 1 Oregon next week.
5. Washington (3-3, 2-1 Pac-10) UP NEXT: at Arizona
People say baseball is a game of inches, but the Huskies could attest to a similar
assertion about football. Washington beat Oregon State by the skin of its teeth, or
rather by the hands of Joe Halahuni, who dropped the would-be game-winning two
point conversion in double overtime. All of a sudden, the Huskies could be back in the bowl
picture. They'll have to earn it, though, as their next three games are against ranked teams,
including two on the road.
6. Oregon State (3-3, 2-1 Pac-10) UP NEXT: Bye
~_I L The hard-luck losers in the aforementioned thriller, the Beavers now have a bye
week to regroup and refocus. The loss of electric receiver/returner James Rodgers
Hi for the season could be a crucial blow for Oregon State, which now finds itself in
the middle of the conference. After their bye, the Beavers have a slightly easier
road ahead, as their next four opponents are unranked.
7. Arizona State (3-3, 1-2 Pac-10) UP NEXT: at California
IA. The Sun Devils face a tough road to a bowl game, needing four wins in their final six
games to qualify. There are still winnable games on their schedule, but Arizona State
ArQ*- Wasn't shown the ability to pull out close games. The Sun Devils will likely need to if
TV- they are going to go bowling, and they might have an opportunity this week against
the perennially inconsistent Golden Bears.
8. UCLA (3-3, 1-2 Pac-10) UP NEXT: at Oregon (Thurs.)
The Bruins stay at eighth after their bye week, and it will take a massive road upset
them to move up. Of course, UCLA has already had one of those this season,
and the Ducks could be primed for an Ohio State-like fall from the top. That said,
UCLA is severely behind Oregon talent-wise, and an injured Kevin Prince will have his work cut
out for him in Autzen Stadium tomorrow night.
9. California (3-3,1-2 Pac-10) UP NEXT: vs. Arizona State
J* Just when you thought Cal had things under control, it built a 42-point deficit by half
m gww time against USC. And it's not as though this was the USC of old. No one knows
jSSmmfr what to expect from the Golden Bears this weekend, but they will be playing in the
friendly confines of Memorial Stadium, where they are 3-0 this year. Cal could be looking at
a four-win season or an eight-win season, and we might have more of a clue about their direc
tion after Saturday's game. Or we might not.
10. Washington State (1-6,0-4 Pac-10) UP NEXT: at Stanford
Washington State keeps getting better, but at some point double-digit losses
~ won't be good enough. The Cougars will face another stiff challenge against
Stanford this weekend. Improving or not, it's hard to see the 118th-ranked
Wazzu defense shutting down, or even slowing down, the fifth-ranked Cardinal
offense. Of course, if the Cougars injure the opposing quarterback for the third consecutive
week, it could be a different story.

Washington State keeps getting better, but at some point double-digit losses
~ won't be good enough. The Cougars will face another stiff challenge against
Stanford this weekend. Improving or not, it's hard to see the 118th-ranked
Wazzu defense shutting down, or even slowing down, the fifth-ranked Cardinal
offense. Of course, if the Cougars injure the opposing quarterback for the third consecutive
week, it could be a different story.
