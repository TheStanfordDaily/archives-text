# ASSU reflects on nominations
## Cardona: Council nominations process remains unclear 
### KURT CHIRBAS 
In June, Brianna Pang 'l3, Oz Hasbun
'l3 and Alex Katz 'l2 received an e-mail
from ASSU president Angelina Cardona
'll informing them of her intent to nomi
nate them as members of the Constitution
al Council, the judicial ruling body of the
ASSU.
Pending confirmation by the Under
graduate Senate and the Graduate Stu
dent Council (GSC), Hasbun, Katz and
Pang, a Daily staffer, were told they would
be filling the vacancies of three graduating
members of the council.The bill to confirm
their appointment, however, never made it
to the Senate. In fact, it was never written.
Cardona and ASSU Vice President
Kelsei Wharton 'l2 decided to reopen the
position to more applicants at the begin
ning of autumn quarter and conducted in
person interviews with each candidate at
the beginning of October.

On Oct. 11, Pang, Hasbun and Katz
each received another e-mail from Car
dona, but this time with a different mes
sage: they had been replaced. Three new
nominees, David Hoyt 'l2, J'vona Ivory 'll
and Samir Siddhanti 'l2 had been offered
the three available council positions.
"I was pretty confused at first," Pang
said. "I did a lot of studying of the ASSU
constitution over the summer, and I basi
cally tried to prepare myself for the posi
tion."
Katz said he agreed.
"I think it was unfair to the candidates
to lead them on over the summer, and then
to surprise us in the fall with a new deci
sion" Katz said.
The Constitutional Council
Mirroring the U.S. federal government,
the powers of the ASSU are divided in
three: the executive, headed by the ASSU
president and vice president; the legisla

tive, consisting of the Senate and the GSC;
and the judicial, led by the Constitutional
Council, a five-member panel, including
four justices and one chair, that rules on
questions involving the ASSU constitu
tion.

Historically, the judicial branch has
been the weakest —and least well known
of the three. Last year, only one case, the
first in five years, was brought before the
Constitutional Council.

Shooting Down Rumors
However, partially because of the re
placement of the original three nominees,
the Constitutional Council has received
more attention than usual this year. At a
GSC meeting on Oct. 13, Ryan Peacock, a
graduate student in chemical engineering
and ASSU executive cabinet member, at
tempted to put to rest rumors that the GSC
had ulterior motives in seeking new nomi
nees, a speculation posited by Otis Reid 'l2

in an Oct. 12 Stanford Review blog post.
Pang was a GSC beat writer for the
Daily last year, and Reid speculated that
this might have affected the GSC's partial
ity towards her nomination.
Peacock denies the claim.
"I strongly emphasized in the GSC
meeting that [Reid's] conclusion that the
GSC didn't like Brianna last year and
that's why she was withdrawn was com
pletely incorrect," Peacock said. "I can tell
you serving on the GSC last year that we
thought Brianna was great."
Cardona also dismissed speculation
that Pang's writing for The Daily influ
enced the final decision and said Pang was
in strong contention for a seat that will
open in winter quarter.
"Brianna actually has a great relation
ship with the GSC, and their leadership ac
tually thought she was one of the strongest

applicants that we had," Cardona said.
"So she's still highly being considered
for the winter position if she's still inter
ested."
She also shot down the notion that
Katz's position as editor in chief of The
Stanford Review, a conservative publi
cation, affected her decision, as Reid
speculated it might have.
"People's ideology didn't play a
role," Cardona said. "I actually don't
know where on the political spectrum
Samir, David or J'vona are."

Unclear Nomination Procedure
Cardona cites the lack of a clear
precedent as the reason behind the re
call of the nominees. While the ASSU
constitution states it is up to the presi
dent to fill any vacancy on the council, it
doesn't specify a procedure. After
choosing three tentative names in June,
Cardona said she felt the original

process, which was just a paper applica
tion, was not as comprehensive as it
should have been.
"After a lot of deliberation be
tween Kelsei and I, we decided that we
wanted to have a more thorough
process, which included an interview
component that we didn't have last
year," Cardona said. "We felt that we
rushed through the process in the
spring and made decisions on three
people very quickly."
While five individuals applied for the
position in the spring, that number dou
bled to ten this fall. Cardona said that
the new candidates were simply
stronger.

"The thing that changed was that we
found other applicants who were more
capable of fulfilling what we saw as the
requirements to be on the council," Car
dona said.

She cited Siddhanti's experience
withMockTrial,Hoyt'sperformance on
a mock case that each applicant was
given and Ivory's passion for law as the
traits that, respectively, pushed them
over the edge.
However, Cardona said she is con

cerned over the language in the ASSU
constitution, which states that the chair
of the Constitutional Council must be
chosen within the first three weeks of
the quarter by a majority vote. For a ma
jority vote to be valid, there must be at
least four members on the Council par
ticipating.
All three of the original candidates
said they will not let this setback dis
courage them from getting involved
with the ASSU in the future.
"I can't say that I am content with
the way things were handled," Hasbun
wrote in an e-mail to The Daily. "How
ever, I do know that I would never
allow one bad experience to deter me
from pursuing activities through
which I believe I can make a positive
impact at Stanford. Therefore, I may
very well be involved with the ASSU
in the future, but I would like to see
more defined protocols set in place
within the Constitution in regards to
the Council's nomination and confir
mation processes."

In June, Brianna Pang 'l3, Oz Hasbun
'l3 and Alex Katz 'l2 received an e-mail
from ASSU president Angelina Cardona
'll informing them of her intent to nomi
nate them as members of the Constitution
al Council, the judicial ruling body of the
ASSU.
Pending confirmation by the Under
graduate Senate and the Graduate Stu
dent Council (GSC), Hasbun, Katz and
Pang, a Daily staffer, were told they would
be filling the vacancies of three graduating
members of the council.The bill to confirm
their appointment, however, never made it
to the Senate. In fact, it was never written.
Cardona and ASSU Vice President
Kelsei Wharton 'l2 decided to reopen the
position to more applicants at the begin
ning of autumn quarter and conducted in
person interviews with each candidate at
the beginning of October.

On Oct. 11, Pang, Hasbun and Katz
each received another e-mail from Car
dona, but this time with a different mes
sage: they had been replaced. Three new
nominees, David Hoyt 'l2, J'vona Ivory 'll
and Samir Siddhanti 'l2 had been offered
the three available council positions.
"I was pretty confused at first," Pang
said. "I did a lot of studying of the ASSU
constitution over the summer, and I basi
cally tried to prepare myself for the posi
tion."
Katz said he agreed.
"I think it was unfair to the candidates
to lead them on over the summer, and then
to surprise us in the fall with a new deci
sion" Katz said.
The Constitutional Council
Mirroring the U.S. federal government,
the powers of the ASSU are divided in
three: the executive, headed by the ASSU
president and vice president; the legisla

tive, consisting of the Senate and the GSC;
and the judicial, led by the Constitutional
Council, a five-member panel, including
four justices and one chair, that rules on
questions involving the ASSU constitu
tion.

Historically, the judicial branch has
been the weakest —and least well known
of the three. Last year, only one case, the
first in five years, was brought before the
Constitutional Council.

Shooting Down Rumors
However, partially because of the re
placement of the original three nominees,
the Constitutional Council has received
more attention than usual this year. At a
GSC meeting on Oct. 13, Ryan Peacock, a
graduate student in chemical engineering
and ASSU executive cabinet member, at
tempted to put to rest rumors that the GSC
had ulterior motives in seeking new nomi
nees, a speculation posited by Otis Reid 'l2

in an Oct. 12 Stanford Review blog post.
Pang was a GSC beat writer for the
Daily last year, and Reid speculated that
this might have affected the GSC's partial
ity towards her nomination.
Peacock denies the claim.
"I strongly emphasized in the GSC
meeting that [Reid's] conclusion that the
GSC didn't like Brianna last year and
that's why she was withdrawn was com
pletely incorrect," Peacock said. "I can tell
you serving on the GSC last year that we
thought Brianna was great."
Cardona also dismissed speculation
that Pang's writing for The Daily influ
enced the final decision and said Pang was
in strong contention for a seat that will
open in winter quarter.
"Brianna actually has a great relation
ship with the GSC, and their leadership ac
tually thought she was one of the strongest

applicants that we had," Cardona said.
"So she's still highly being considered
for the winter position if she's still inter
ested."
She also shot down the notion that
Katz's position as editor in chief of The
Stanford Review, a conservative publi
cation, affected her decision, as Reid
speculated it might have.
"People's ideology didn't play a
role," Cardona said. "I actually don't
know where on the political spectrum
Samir, David or J'vona are."

Unclear Nomination Procedure
Cardona cites the lack of a clear
precedent as the reason behind the re
call of the nominees. While the ASSU
constitution states it is up to the presi
dent to fill any vacancy on the council, it
doesn't specify a procedure. After
choosing three tentative names in June,
Cardona said she felt the original

process, which was just a paper applica
tion, was not as comprehensive as it
should have been.
"After a lot of deliberation be
tween Kelsei and I, we decided that we
wanted to have a more thorough
process, which included an interview
component that we didn't have last
year," Cardona said. "We felt that we
rushed through the process in the
spring and made decisions on three
people very quickly."
While five individuals applied for the
position in the spring, that number dou
bled to ten this fall. Cardona said that
the new candidates were simply
stronger.

"The thing that changed was that we
found other applicants who were more
capable of fulfilling what we saw as the
requirements to be on the council," Car
dona said.

She cited Siddhanti's experience
withMockTrial,Hoyt'sperformance on
a mock case that each applicant was
given and Ivory's passion for law as the
traits that, respectively, pushed them
over the edge.
However, Cardona said she is con

cerned over the language in the ASSU
constitution, which states that the chair
of the Constitutional Council must be
chosen within the first three weeks of
the quarter by a majority vote. For a ma
jority vote to be valid, there must be at
least four members on the Council par
ticipating.
All three of the original candidates
said they will not let this setback dis
courage them from getting involved
with the ASSU in the future.
"I can't say that I am content with
the way things were handled," Hasbun
wrote in an e-mail to The Daily. "How
ever, I do know that I would never
allow one bad experience to deter me
from pursuing activities through
which I believe I can make a positive
impact at Stanford. Therefore, I may
very well be involved with the ASSU
in the future, but I would like to see
