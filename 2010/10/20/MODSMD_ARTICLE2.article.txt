# ASSU reflects on nominations
## Cardona: Council nominations process remains unclear 
### KURT CHIRBAS 
In June, Brianna Pang 'l3, Oz Hasbun
'l3 and Alex Katz 'l2 received an e-mail
from ASSU president Angelina Cardona
'll informing them of her intent to nomi
nate them as members of the Constitution
al Council, the judicial ruling body of the
ASSU.
Pending confirmation by the Under
graduate Senate and the Graduate Stu
dent Council (GSC), Hasbun, Katz and
Pang, a Daily staffer, were told they would
be filling the vacancies of three graduating
members of the council.The bill to confirm
their appointment, however, never made it
to the Senate. In fact, it was never written.
Cardona and ASSU Vice President
Kelsei Wharton 'l2 decided to reopen the
position to more applicants at the begin
ning of autumn quarter and conducted in
person interviews with each candidate at
the beginning of October.

On Oct. 11, Pang, Hasbun and Katz
each received another e-mail from Car
dona, but this time with a different mes
sage: they had been replaced. Three new
nominees, David Hoyt 'l2, J'vona Ivory 'll
and Samir Siddhanti 'l2 had been offered
the three available council positions.
"I was pretty confused at first," Pang
said. "I did a lot of studying of the ASSU
constitution over the summer, and I basi
cally tried to prepare myself for the posi
tion."
Katz said he agreed.
"I think it was unfair to the candidates
to lead them on over the summer, and then
to surprise us in the fall with a new deci
sion" Katz said.
The Constitutional Council
Mirroring the U.S. federal government,
the powers of the ASSU are divided in
three: the executive, headed by the ASSU
president and vice president; the legisla

tive, consisting of the Senate and the GSC;
and the judicial, led by the Constitutional
Council, a five-member panel, including
four justices and one chair, that rules on
questions involving the ASSU constitu
tion.

Historically, the judicial branch has
been the weakest â€”and least well known
of the three. Last year, only one case, the
first in five years, was brought before the
Constitutional Council.

Shooting Down Rumors
However, partially because of the re
placement of the original three nominees,
the Constitutional Council has received
more attention than usual this year. At a
GSC meeting on Oct. 13, Ryan Peacock, a
graduate student in chemical engineering
and ASSU executive cabinet member, at
tempted to put to rest rumors that the GSC
had ulterior motives in seeking new nomi
nees, a speculation posited by Otis Reid 'l2

in an Oct. 12 Stanford Review blog post.
Pang was a GSC beat writer for the
Daily last year, and Reid speculated that
this might have affected the GSC's partial
ity towards her nomination.
Peacock denies the claim.
"I strongly emphasized in the GSC
meeting that [Reid's] conclusion that the
GSC didn't like Brianna last year and
that's why she was withdrawn was com
pletely incorrect," Peacock said. "I can tell
you serving on the GSC last year that we
thought Brianna was great."
Cardona also dismissed speculation
that Pang's writing for The Daily influ
enced the final decision and said Pang was
in strong contention for a seat that will
open in winter quarter.
"Brianna actually has a great relation
ship with the GSC, and their leadership ac
tually thought she was one of the strongest
