## Stanford Dining hires staff nutritionist 
### JULIA BROWNELL SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
As part of a more holistic approach to food
service, Stanford Dining has hired Elaine
Magee as its new wellness nutritionist.
The new position is the first full-time nutri
tionist Stanford Dining has ever supported.
Previously, Ricker dining manager Mary
Duch served as Dining's part-time nutrition
ist. Following the new hire, Duch will be man
aging Ricker full-time. Vaden Health Center
also has a full-time nutritionist, Vivian Crist
man, who works with students on individual
dietary concerns.
Stanford Dining specifically created a
"wellness" nutritionist position to encompass a
more holistic view of nutrition and health in

the dining experience.
"It comes naturally that with our dedication
to EatWell and our partnership with BeWell, we
would create a position for a Performance and
Wellness Nutritionist," Eric Montell, executive
director of Stanford Dining, wrote in an e-mail to
The Daily. "Stanford Dining wants to serve food
that not only provides nutrients that students
need to prevent illness, but also food that maxi
mizes athletic and intellectual performance."
Stanford Dining was looking for someone
with a strong nutrition background and who
was comfortable writing and communicating
via the Internet and social network sites to
reach students where they are. After a search
by a steering committee, Magee emerged as an
obvious choice.
Before coming to Stanford, Magee worked

as a nutrition expert and writer for
WebMD.com, wrote more than 25 books on
nutrition, and wrote a national column in
which she "made over" recipes to make them
healthier. She saw a unique opportunity in
coming to Stanford.
"Over the past couple of years I have seen
how impersonal and limiting contract food
service can be on other college campuses, so I
was particularly impressed with how different
things are here at Stanford Dining," she wrote
in an e-mail to The Daily.
Magee expressed excitement about the po
sition because of its unique broad view of nutri
tion.
"I hope to help students and student ath
letes (and interested staff) reach a higher level
of health while embracing health in the more

holistic sense health in
mind, body and spirit,"
Magee said.
To achieve this, a large

part of Magee's role will involve organizing
outreach with the many wellness-oriented pro
grams on campus.
Dining wanted to support BeWell and
ASSU Health and Wellness, partner with Stan
ford Athletics and serve as a liaison to Vaden
Health Promotions, Montell said.
Magee will also assist with some of Stanford
Dining's own outreach programs. For instance,
she was just involved with the BeWell Student
Launch Party to promote eating whole, fresh
foods. Her dining outreach will also involve ap-


Magee
pearances at the dining halls with an
"Ask Elaine!" sign to talk directly
with students about nutrition ques
tions.
Magee will also take an active role
in consulting the dining halls on nutri

tion and their menus. She says she is
already working on a project with the
chefs on campus.
"I am working on a whole grain
project (whole wheat bread, buns and
pasta) with the chefs as a standard to
increase whole grain consumption.
This would mean whole grains would
be used as the rule rather than the ex
ception. So, in other words, dining
halls would make grilled cheese sand
wiches on whole wheat bread and a

student could request it to be made on
white bread if that's what they pre
fer," Magee said.
She will be blogging and writing
about nutrition and working directly
with students. Her blog, called "Food
for Thought," will appear on Stanford
Dining's Facebook and Twitter pages.
Her pieces will also appear on the
Dining newsletter that appears on
dining hall tables every two weeks.
William Lee 'l2 hadn't heard of

her arrival but did see a role for her in
improving the dining-hall menus.
"If she could figure out away to do
less mass cooking find easier,
healthier things chefs can cook that
students can eat without feeling like
they're sacrificing something," he
said. "Perhaps giving them less un
healthy options so that the healthy
options become just as good as the
unhealthy ones."
Some students, such as Jisun Minh

'll, had heard about Magee's arrival
through the dining-hall newsletter.
However, she wasn't sure what to ex
pect.

"I'm not all too sure what a nutri
tionist is supposed to do, or where she
is," Minh said.
Magee will eventually be stationed
in the new East Campus Dining Com
mons, to be completed this spring. The
dining hall has a performance and
wellness theme and will foster a pro

gram Magee is spearheading.
"[My] largest project... is a pro
gram called Performance Dining,"
she said. "This is a new concept that
looks at the relationship between eat
ing, activity levels and the nutrition
aspects of food.This new program will
be fully realized in the soon to be built
East Campus Dining Commons."
