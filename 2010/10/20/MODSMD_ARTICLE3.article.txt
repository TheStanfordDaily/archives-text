## Stanford Dining hires staff nutritionist 
### JULIA BROWNELL SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
As part of a more holistic approach to food
service, Stanford Dining has hired Elaine
Magee as its new wellness nutritionist.
The new position is the first full-time nutri
tionist Stanford Dining has ever supported.
Previously, Ricker dining manager Mary
Duch served as Dining's part-time nutrition
ist. Following the new hire, Duch will be man
aging Ricker full-time. Vaden Health Center
also has a full-time nutritionist, Vivian Crist
man, who works with students on individual
dietary concerns.
Stanford Dining specifically created a
"wellness" nutritionist position to encompass a
more holistic view of nutrition and health in

the dining experience.
"It comes naturally that with our dedication
to EatWell and our partnership with BeWell, we
would create a position for a Performance and
Wellness Nutritionist," Eric Montell, executive
director of Stanford Dining, wrote in an e-mail to
The Daily. "Stanford Dining wants to serve food
that not only provides nutrients that students
need to prevent illness, but also food that maxi
mizes athletic and intellectual performance."
Stanford Dining was looking for someone
with a strong nutrition background and who
was comfortable writing and communicating
via the Internet and social network sites to
reach students where they are. After a search
by a steering committee, Magee emerged as an
obvious choice.
Before coming to Stanford, Magee worked

as a nutrition expert and writer for
WebMD.com, wrote more than 25 books on
nutrition, and wrote a national column in
which she "made over" recipes to make them
healthier. She saw a unique opportunity in
coming to Stanford.
"Over the past couple of years I have seen
how impersonal and limiting contract food
service can be on other college campuses, so I
was particularly impressed with how different
things are here at Stanford Dining," she wrote
in an e-mail to The Daily.
Magee expressed excitement about the po
sition because of its unique broad view of nutri
tion.
"I hope to help students and student ath
letes (and interested staff) reach a higher level
of health while embracing health in the more

holistic sense health in
mind, body and spirit,"
Magee said.
To achieve this, a large

part of Magee's role will involve organizing
outreach with the many wellness-oriented pro
grams on campus.
Dining wanted to support BeWell and
ASSU Health and Wellness, partner with Stan
ford Athletics and serve as a liaison to Vaden
Health Promotions, Montell said.
Magee will also assist with some of Stanford
Dining's own outreach programs. For instance,
she was just involved with the BeWell Student
Launch Party to promote eating whole, fresh
foods. Her dining outreach will also involve ap-
