## Gene does not predict heart ills Study finds genetic marker wrongly linked to heart attacks 
### ERIN INMAN STAFF WRITER 
A genetic marker peddled as a pre
dictor of coronary artery disease actual
ly has no significant bearing on the mat
ter, according to a recently published
Stanford-led study.
The study was led by Thomas Quert
ermous, professor in cardiovascular
medicine, and Themistocles Assimes,
assistant professor of medicine, in col
laboration with more than 130 coau
thors throughout Europe and North
America.
Published online in the "Journal of
the American College of Cardiology"
on Oct. 8, the study dispels the claim
that a KIF6 gene polymorphism is asso
ciated with an increased risk for coro
nary artery disease. Coronary artery dis
ease, a disease of cholesterol buildup in
the arteries of the heart that often re
sults in fatal heart attacks, is the number
one killer in the United States.
The collaborators used a meta
analysis of genome-wide association
studies to assess the effects of KIF6
polymorphisms on more than 17,000 in
