## Gene does not predict heart ills Study finds genetic marker wrongly linked to heart attacks 
### ERIN INMAN STAFF WRITER 
A genetic marker peddled as a pre
dictor of coronary artery disease actual
ly has no significant bearing on the mat
ter, according to a recently published
Stanford-led study.
The study was led by Thomas Quert
ermous, professor in cardiovascular
medicine, and Themistocles Assimes,
assistant professor of medicine, in col
laboration with more than 130 coau
thors throughout Europe and North
America.
Published online in the "Journal of
the American College of Cardiology"
on Oct. 8, the study dispels the claim
that a KIF6 gene polymorphism is asso
ciated with an increased risk for coro
nary artery disease. Coronary artery dis
ease, a disease of cholesterol buildup in
the arteries of the heart that often re
sults in fatal heart attacks, is the number
one killer in the United States.
The collaborators used a meta
analysis of genome-wide association
studies to assess the effects of KIF6
polymorphisms on more than 17,000 in
dividuals with coronary artery dis
ease and more than 40,000 individu
als without the disease. As opposed to
some previous studies with small sub
ject pools that cited a 22 to 55 percent
greater risk of disease for those with
the KIF6 variant, this study found no
significant increased risk.
The mistaken risk association be
tween the KIF6 gene and coronary
artery disease gained momentum
with a minority of the medical com
munity when medical devices com
pany CELERA Diagnostics made
and marketed a test kit for doctors to
take patients' samples, Quertermous
said.
Both positive and negative stud
ies existed prior to CELERA mar
keting its test kits.
"It was a murky feeling to begin
with," Assimes said in reference to
the mistaken gene-disease associa
tion. This murky feeling amid the
gaining momentum of the CELERA
test kits prompted the study.
This mistake is common to com
plex human diseases, such as coro
nary artery disease, that have com
plex genetics (that is, multiple small
defects each with small effects) and
gene-environment interactions, as
opposed to "Mendelian" genetic dis
eases, where a single gene defect
causes a large effect.
Currently, 13 valid molecular
markers for coronary artery disease
have been identified using genome
wide association studies. However,
more markers are necessary for this
technology to be truly useful in clini
cal practice, Assimes said. "We need
to reach a threshold."
Researchers hope to identify new
genes to identify drug targets and de
velop new drugs for those pathways,
said Joshua Knowles, who runs the
clinic of inherited coronary diseases

at Stanford's Center of Inherited
Cardiovascular Disease.
"For people with cardiovascular
disease, the first symptom is usually
death," Quertermous said. "We want
to intervene."
The field of genetic markers as
predictors of complex human dis
eases is still in its infancy, Knowles
said.
Most genetic variants thus far are
not widely used as a diagnosis tool in
a clinical setting and more trials are
needed.
Doctors are not yet paying much
attention to genetic markers for
complex human diseases, Querter
mous said. Nonetheless, Assimes
predicts that ten years from now, ge
netic markers will be an important
assessment tool for physicians.

However, using markers will re
quire medical schools and physicians
to brush up on genetics, which is "un
derstudied and under-taught at most
medical schools," Knowles said.
Because this technology is still
maturing, insurance companies have
given it little attention as well. When
the insurance companies do take
note, patients will be partially pro
tected by the Genetic Information
Nondiscrimination Act of 2008,
which prohibits discrimination
based on genetics for life but not
health insurance, Knowles said,
putting even more pressure on ge
neticists to catch these mistakes such
as this one well beforehand.
