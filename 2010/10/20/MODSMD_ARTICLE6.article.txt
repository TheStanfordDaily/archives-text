## Senate confirms nominees Constitutional Council filled after redo of nominations 
### MARGARET RAWSON DESK EDITOR 
The 12th ASSU Undergraduate Senate
confirmed on Tuesday three ASSU execu
tive nominees, David Hoyt '12, J'vona
Ivory '11 and Samir Siddhanti "12, to the
Constitutional Council.
The ASSU executives, despite having
chosen three nominees at the beginning of
summer, decided to redo the interview
process for the Constitutional Council at
the beginning of fall quarter, resulting in
three new nominees â€” Ivory, Hoyt and
Siddhanti.
Hoyt and Ivory were present Tuesday
evening to field questions from the sena
tors and to express what motivated them to
serve in the ASSU judicial branch.
"I have a history of studying constitu
tions ... I wanted to apply what I've
learned in the abstract to reality," Ivory
said.
Hoyt, a junior transfer student, men
tioned his experience with public speaking
and his personal aspirations toward law
school. He said his extensive participation
in different student organizations granted
him the skills needed to serve on the Con
stitutional Council.
"Every organization I worked with I
threw myself into 110 percent,'' Hoyt said.
Senator Rebecca Sachs '12 asked Ivory
about her past experience in the ASSU, a
contentious issue surrounding the replace
ment of the Executive's original nominees.
Ivory served in the 10th Undergraduate
Senate and ran endorsed by the Students
of Color Coalition (SOCC). She did not
seek re-election.
"How do you think having been on the
inside will influence how you see things?"
Sachs asked.
Ivory cited her experience as a senator
as less-than-positive and discussed her de
cision to part with the ASSU for her junior
year, a choice that allowed her to under
stand the ASSU from the perspective of a
typical student.
"Junior year I decided to distance my
self from [the ASSU]... through my dis
tance I was able to get what the students
thought the ASSU meant," Ivory said,
adding that she looks forward to joining
the ASSU in a new capacity.
"Yes, I was SOCC-endorsed, but
that was awhile ago," she added. "I'm
older and do have an unbiased view."
When asked his view of the role of
the Constitutional Council, Hoyt
stressed the council's importance in
maintaining the balance of the ASSU
branches and "protecting the students
and their organizations and empower
ing them."

Senate Chair Michael Cruz 'l2 said
of the nominations, "It was a fair and
open process. We have three excellent
new justices and I'm sure they'll work
hard."

The Senate tabled on Tuesday a bill
calling for a surveying method to obtain

qualitative and quantitative data on
student opinion about Senate bills.
The bill's author, Stewart Macgregor-
Dennis 'l3, suggested the Senate com
munication committee further discuss
the details of the bill, though many sena
tors supported the goal of using data on
student opinion to inform voting.

"We want accurate numbers and
the better the methodologies, the more
accurate the statistics we'll get and the
better decisions we'll make," Macgre
gor-Dennis said.
During committee updates. Appro
priations Committee Chair Rafael
Vasquez 'l2 briefed the Senate on the
recent revisions to general fees for
2010-2011, including economies of
scale for event food and explicit line
item distinctions. Vasquez said the com
mittee plans to encourage student
groups to spend on an event basis to de
crease the Senate's take-back rate.

As the short meeting neared closing,
the Senate atmosphere shifted and the
senators began to discuss informal
gatherings, such as a Senate party.
"It's so good to see everyone so
happy, in such a happy setting," said
Daniel Khalessi 'l3.
"I've been a Stanford student for
three years and I've seen three Senates
and I can say the 12th Senate is a happi
er and a more whole bunch," said Cruz,
who also served in the 11th Senate. "We
all just seem to get along. It helps the de
bate because we can be real with one
another."

Cruz added, "There's more respect
almost a collegial experience."
All student group-funding bills and
budget modifications for the evening
were passed.
