## Senate confirms nominees Constitutional Council filled after redo of nominations 
### MARGARET RAWSON DESK EDITOR 
The 12th ASSU Undergraduate Senate
confirmed on Tuesday three ASSU execu
tive nominees, David Hoyt '12, J'vona
Ivory '11 and Samir Siddhanti "12, to the
Constitutional Council.
The ASSU executives, despite having
chosen three nominees at the beginning of
summer, decided to redo the interview
process for the Constitutional Council at
the beginning of fall quarter, resulting in
three new nominees â€” Ivory, Hoyt and
Siddhanti.
Hoyt and Ivory were present Tuesday
evening to field questions from the sena
tors and to express what motivated them to
serve in the ASSU judicial branch.
"I have a history of studying constitu
tions ... I wanted to apply what I've
learned in the abstract to reality," Ivory
said.
Hoyt, a junior transfer student, men
tioned his experience with public speaking
and his personal aspirations toward law
school. He said his extensive participation
in different student organizations granted
him the skills needed to serve on the Con
stitutional Council.
"Every organization I worked with I
threw myself into 110 percent,'' Hoyt said.
Senator Rebecca Sachs '12 asked Ivory
about her past experience in the ASSU, a
contentious issue surrounding the replace
ment of the Executive's original nominees.
Ivory served in the 10th Undergraduate
Senate and ran endorsed by the Students
of Color Coalition (SOCC). She did not
seek re-election.
"How do you think having been on the
inside will influence how you see things?"
Sachs asked.
Ivory cited her experience as a senator
as less-than-positive and discussed her de
cision to part with the ASSU for her junior
year, a choice that allowed her to under
stand the ASSU from the perspective of a
typical student.
"Junior year I decided to distance my
self from [the ASSU]... through my dis
tance I was able to get what the students
thought the ASSU meant," Ivory said,
adding that she looks forward to joining
the ASSU in a new capacity.
