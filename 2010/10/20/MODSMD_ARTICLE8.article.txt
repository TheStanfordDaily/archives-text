## Health care reform meets Cardinal Care Some clear changes coming to student health plans, but others still unknown 
### EDITH PRECIADO 
Regulatory changes passed in
March's Patient Protection and
Affordable Care Act have set in
surance companies, hospitals and
corporate America to work to
alter their health plans and policies. But other
organizations, like universities, could see
changes, too.
While some of the legislation's provisions
only apply to insurance plans created after Sept.
23, there are several adjustments to which cur
rent plans must adhere. Among them are sever
al requirements that could affect college-based
insurance plans. The mandates include no life
time limits on benefit payments, free
preventive care and the option of
allowing parents to keep
children under age 26 on
their health insurance
plans.

Most school insurance
programs, like Stanford's
Cardinal Care, are excluded
from these provisions for the
2010-2011 academic year since
the first parts of health-care re
form were implemented after the
year started.
In later years, Cardinal Care's
Tier 2 program, which has a lifetime
maximum benefit of $5 million would
have to change, as well as Cardinal Care's
$2O co-pay for preventive care.
Ira Friedman, director of Vaden Health
Center, addressed the possibility of expanding
services.

"Under the new bill, Cardinal Care's medical ben
efits will probably expand further (for example, more
reventive care), which is a good thing," Friedman

wrote in an e-mail to The Daily. "However, premium costs will prob
ably need to go up. I'm very concerned about that, considering stu
dents' limited budgets."
He said many upcoming changes directly related to this new legis
lation are still up in the air.
"The new health care bill is very long and complicated," Friedman
said. "Many of the implementing regulations have not been made
public. So, we and others around the country have been working hard
to understand the bill's future impact on students and on the insur
ance plans sponsored by colleges and universities."
Today, about 30 percent of undergraduates and 75 percent of grad
uate students have Cardinal Care. The larger percentage of under
grads with insurance plans other than Cardinal Care could be affect
ed by changes in legislation, depending on whether their parents' cov
erage is available to them in future years, whether their parents will
purchase coverage from the new state-wide exchanges made avail
able in January 2014 or whether they have Medicaid or other state
funded programs.
Students interviewed expressed satisfaction with their current
Cardinal Care coverage.
Elizabeth Patino 'l4, who lives independently from her family, said
she had no viable health insurance options other than Cardinal Care
through financial aid. She said she felt extremely safe with her service.
Despite the $2O co-pays for each visit, "Cardinal Care is a good sys
tem," she said. "It is affordable, and I feel secure because I know I can
use it if anything happens. It is also really easy to make appointments."
Julia Grabowska 'l4, an international student, opted for Cardinal
Care out of convenience.
"It was too complicated to figure out an international health-care
provider with the same kind of benefit," she said. Although Grabows
ka has not yet needed any services, she knows of other students for
whom Cardinal Care has covered "serious matters" such as visits to
the ER and knee injuries.
Overall, the consensus for those who have Cardinal Care either
covered by financial aid or paid for by their parents seemed to point
to the fact that service is more than satisfactory.
When asked if she planned on changing her health care provider any
time soon, Patino replied, "I definitely plan to keep it for the next four
years."
