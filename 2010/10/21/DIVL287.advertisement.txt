From family dynamics to the global economy, the graying of the boomer
generation will impact every aspect of society. What is next for boomers and the
generations that follow in their wake?
As the planet's population surges towards 9 billion in 2050, our sheer numbers will
exert tremendous pressure on resources, infrastructures and the ability of leaders
to address the issues of the massive shift in demographics.
Living longer and better may be the biggest challenge any individual boomer faces,
but the global implications of an aging world population are equally daunting. Few
issues are as universal and compelling in the world and in one's own life.
Join moderator Tom Brokaw and a distinguished panel of leaders for the fifth
Roundtable at Stanford University.
