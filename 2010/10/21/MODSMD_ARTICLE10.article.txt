## GSC debates religious, political funding 
### ANNA SCHUESSLER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
On Wednesday the Graduate Stu
dent Council (GSC) discussed its posi
tion as a facilitator of freedom of
speech on the Stanford campus. In re
sponse to a questions raised about reli
gious-event funding, the council invit
ed Nanci Howe of Student Activities
and Leadership to speak about the
University's relationship with the by
laws regarding religious and political
funding. GSC funding committee chair
Krystal St. Julien clarified the guide
lines the group has been using in the
past year to make funding decisions.
"Right now we cannot fund reli
gious and political events with the
strict exception that they are educa
tional and open to everybody," St.
Mien said. "One of the things that

has come up in the discussion is that it
is making certain student groups feel
excluded."
Howe clarified the basis for the
rules, saying that Stanford's status as
a 501(c)(3) organization restricts
funds coming directly from the Uni
versity from supporting candidates
running for office.
"We cannot support partisan and
political activities," said Howe. "'Par
tisan' is narrowly defined by some
one running for office. We cannot en
dorse or fund candidates, and cannot
put the University in a position of
funding candidates. That is against
tax law."
Howe could not be sure of the ori
gins of the funding bylaws regarding
religious events, but she encouraged
the GSC to think about the values
they were planning to uphold with

their final decisions.
"There are two philosophical con
cerns: what is your body's commit
ment to free speech and free associa
tion? If you do restrict funding, it
should be content-neutral across all
activities because you might be
abridging someone's speech," said
Howe.
Some council members expressed
reservations about writing a bylaw in
tended to be passed down from year
to year. Addy Satija, a fourth-year
graduate student in electrical engi
neering, hoped to protect the tran
sient nature of each council.
"I would think it would be useful
to keep [the bylaw] standing at least
for a year," Satija said.
Ultimately, councilmembers came
to the conclusion that the decision
would be theirs to make. The GSC
planned to discuss the matter at
greater length at an open session di
rectly following the meeting as well
as at its upcoming retreat.
"We can ask as many administra
tors as we want," said Jessica Tsai,
council co-chair. "But in the end, we
have to make our own decision about
our values."
