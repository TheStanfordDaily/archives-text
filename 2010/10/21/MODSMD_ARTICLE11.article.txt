What's your favorite sound? No, not
the sizzle of bacon; not something
associated with another sense or ex
perience, The sound you like most in the
world, purely for its aesthetic appeal.
It's not a question asked very frequently.
We have favorite colors, probably a favorite
flavor, but not very often is there a sound
that causes you to stop and just listen. The
sonic sense is cultivated in our society in
such away that most people pay little atten
tion to the finer details. I'd like to suggest a
little more opening of the ears.
You probably had a favorite song in mind,
and I'm not suggesting we neglect our brain's
microphones. In the same way we enjoy a
meal or a landscape painting, when several el
ements of a sense are assembled together,
they make a pleasing product. But do you
have a particular tempo or pitch you prefer
above others? And how often do you take the
time, between classes, homework and activi
ties, to really listen to the world around you?
Technology has given us amazing control
over the sound we listen to. Audio recording
has developed to a point where digital en
coding provides us with microscopic resolu
tion and massive storage capacity. With en
tire music libraries in our pockets, we are no
longer restricted to a concert hall for a
world-class performance of a Beethoven
symphony. Nor must we sit in our living
room with a turntable piping tunes through
cabinet-sized speakers. But when we take
music out of those quiet environments, the
noisy world intrudes upon the fidelity of the
sound.

For example, when you're in a car, listen
ing to an iPod or the radio, the highway noise
masks all subtleties. That's why pop and rock
are always mixed to be forte, because you
would never hear the soft bits. It's the same
on a plane or commuting on a metro we
wear headphones in an attempt to drown out
the hum of the vehicle (and the tedium).
Campus life has its examples too: speakers
cranked up over voices at loud parties, wear
ing earbuds as you go to class, etc.
In these kinds of settings, not only are the
dynamics of music for naught, but so is the
spectral variety. Certain frequencies get lost,
like when the car engine's low rumble domi
nates a bass line. We still sing along at the top
of our lungs to a song at a party, but if that's
the main way we listen, we lose a depth of
complexity in the sonic experience.
Even if we listened in quiet areas, the
quality of our recordings hasn't been opti
mal recently. Algorithms compress sound

files into MP3s so that they take up less
space, but the compression reduces the reso
lution. It sounds "good enough," but do you
forego HD video just because of storage
constraints? Luckily, as computer capacity
expands, we'll be more able to have quantity
and quality.
Interestingly, we aren't trained to manip
ulate recorded sound the same way we are
with other media. Text editing is second na
ture, simple cropping and toying with photos
is easy, and even middle school kids can pull
out a video camera and make silly cops-and
robbers home videos. But it's usually only
musicians that start fiddling around with
Garage Band. I suppose we don't edit sound
very often because it's not our main form of
storing and communicating information. It
takes time to listen to a speech when you
could more quickly read it. So we usually
couple the sound with a video, or we multi
task and listen while we work.
But when we treat sound as a supplement
to our other senses, we don't devote our en
tire attention to it. Unless you're a musician
or an audiophile, it's easy to neglect a whole
universe of experience. Taking time to pick
out the clarinet countermelody in a piece, ap
preciating the particular "chnk!" of a car
door closing, or marveling at the rasp of a
radio host's voice are just more delicious rea
sons to be alive.
On campus, there is a contingent of peo
ple who obsess over sound. We're finally get
ting a concert hall with good acoustics, and
any music class (especially at CCRMA) will
focus your ears more than before, not to
mention the kid down the hall with expen
sive speakers and headphones. But for peo
ple in general, if you've ever savored a bite of
your favorite food or gazed for minutes at an
impressive sunset, then I recommend tuning
into your ears' acuity. Take a breath from the
Stanford schedule for a moment and listen to
the Farm. It'll make the music better.
