## Shedding Light on the Constitutional Council 
### 
Dear Editor,
The ASSU Constitutional Council is one
of those rare byproducts of our strange local
democracy. Americans don't forget that the
U.S. Supreme Court exists, but in a universi
ty with high turnover and a booming stu
dent-government bureaucracy, it's not unbe
lievable that the average Stanford student
will have no clue what the Constitutional
Council is, let alone who's on it. The judicial
body of the ASSU has a considerable influ
ence: the right to interpret the ASSU consti
tution. Yet a case almost never arrives to the
council's docket. A glance at its recent histo
ry shows that before the council's member

ship was refreshed last spring, not a single
case had been heard in years.
A quiet past, or even a drawn-out nomi
nations process, shouldn't and won't
impact the legitimacy of the Constitutional
Council. What this recent attention might
do is ignite interest in what is probably the
single most important body in an organiza
tion marked by a divided and political Sen
ate. Our work won't change: we will remain
as committed as ever to maintaining a fair,
transparent mechanism for interpretation
of the constitution and other foundational
ASSU texts. But perhaps what we do will
matter more to the Stanford community.
For that, we should all be thankful.
