# THIS COLUMN IS IRONIC
## It's a Jungle Out There 
### Shane Savitsky 
Stanford is one of the most diverse college
campuses on the planet. We have stu
dents here from countries you've never
even heard of. Seriously, my roommate dur
ing freshman and sophomore years was from
Bahrain. Do you think I could actually point
that out on a map before I walked into Mirlo
304 two years ago? Hell no.
It's not just our international student seg
ment that embodies this remarkable diversi
ty. In fact, our entire student population ex
hibits a wider variety of creatures than you'd
see in The Lion King. Heading out into the
jungle of Stanford will allow you to see dif
ferent types of people all existing together. It
can be confusing and even overwhelming at
first, so here's a little scientific guide to help
you pick out some of the most prevalent
species of students here in the wild of the
Farm:

Bros (bromo erectus): If you want to spot
some bros in the wild, your best bet is to head
to the area around Theta Delt, Kappa Sig and
SAE an area I like to refer to as the "Bro
muda Triangle." To confirm that you've spot
ted a bro, check his clothing choice. He is al
most guaranteed to be wearing a tank top
from one of the sororities on campus most
likely to show off his Theta or Pi Phi girl
friend. Bros are also likely to be legacy stu
dents or have at least one parent who is the
CEO of a Fortune 500 company. If you would
like to attempt to get an up-close look at a
bro (don't worry: they're harmless), try offer
ing him a can of Keystone Light. Please note:
members of Sigma Nu desire the moniker
"bro," but end up looking more like Quinn
from Dexter than anything else.
Sorority Girls (homo blairwaldorficus):

Sorority girls are the female equivalent of
bros. You can spot them sporting the same
neon tank tops as bros, but always with a
Longchamp bag in tow. While bros tend to
congregate in the Bromuda Triangle, you'll
find sorority girls in the Cowell Cluster.There
are only three relevant species of sorority
girls Thetas, Pi Phis and Tri Delts. They
have houses and thus greater status in their
ecosystem here at Stanford. Kappas also are
plentiful on campus, but their lack of a true
habitat in the Cowell Cluster has caused them
to develop an affinity for alcohol as a social
adaptation to combat their inferiority com
plex. Beware.
Hippies (homo immundus): Some may tell
you that Columbae is the "social justice"
theme house on campus, but it just exists to
distract you from the real hippies on campus.
We've placed them in their very own quaran
tine zone Synergy. It's on a secluded hill
top far away from the rest of campus. You
could think of it as a "Jurassic Park" for hip
pies. These people can be identified by their
complete disregard for basic human norms,
including but not limited to showering, cloth
ing and the consumption of meat. Don't ap
proach too close. Otherwise, the hippies will
mercilessly expound the benefits of a vegan

and environmentalist lifestyle to you.
Hipsters (scientific name is too obscure):
These are more difficult to spot in the wild, so
feel fortunate if you run across one. Your best
bet to see one may be wine and cheese nights
at Kairos. You can identify hipsters by their
extremely ratty clothing. This is just a camou
flage technique! Their clothing most likely
was purchased at Urban Outfitters or some
overpriced secondhand shop in San Francisco
for hundreds of dollars. Feel free to get a clos
er look. Their oversized headphones general
ly blast incomprehensible music, giving you
the element of surprise. Most of their time is
spent scouring the blogosphere for new
bands to listen to in order to impress others.
They'll want to tell you about it, so don't mis
interpret this behavior as aggression. Simply
tell the hipster that you're attending a Katy
Perry concert tonight, and he will scamper off.
Nerds (homo solitarius): This species is
known for its horrific mutation: they are gen
erally techies or pre-meds. Stanford scientists
are still confused as to how they evolved. Re
gardless, as a result of their mutation, they
spend much of their time locked away in their
rooms in Manz or GovCo.They are generally
harmless, but their lack of human contact
often makes them skittish. The only time you
will run into this species is on their way to
class in Gates, Hewlett or Mudd.
There you have it, my friends. You will en
counter all of these species during your time
here at Stanford. Stay safe and happy spot
ting!
