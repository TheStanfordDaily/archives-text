Hendry was the teacher whom students re
membered, who inspired them to think critical
ly and challenge themselves. She was passion
ate about teaching and saw public education as
the cornerstone of a strong democracy. Many
students stayed in touch long after they gradu
ated. In the words of one of them, "You were
the first teacher to open the wider world of
ideas to me." When Georgetown University
asked students to name their most influential
high school teacher, they chose Hendry; in
1979, she was awarded the degree of Doctor of
Humane Letters (Hons.) by Georgetown Uni
versity for excellence in the field of secondary
school teaching, and was one of the first sec
ondary-school teachers in the country to be so
recognized.
Hendry began her teaching career in Sacra
mento and San Francisco, Calif. In 1946, she
went to Beijing to help reopen the Peking
American School after the war with Japan
ended. She remained there to teach until evac

by communist forces. Hendry also taught in
the American School in Saigon from 1957 to
1959, and was headmistress of the Dacca
American School from 1963 to 1964 in what
was then East Pakistan, now Bangladesh. She
taught in the junior high school in East Lans
ing, Mich, from 1960 to 1962 and again from
1964 to 1966.

She came to Montgomery County in 1966
and taught there for 20 years, first at Richard
Montgomery High School in Rockville, and
from 1970 until her retirement in 1986 at Walt
Whitman High School in Bethesda. Her fields
of instruction were economics, history and
contemporary issues. In 1986, she was recog
nized as a distinguished teacher under the
Presidential Scholars segment of the National
Merit Scholarship Program, and also received
the University of Rochester's Award for Ex
cellence in Secondary School Teaching.
Hendry was named teacher of the year at
Richard Montgomery High School for the ac
ademic year 1970-1971 and best teacher at
Walt Whitman High School in 1976. She
served as chair of the Walt Whitman High
School Faculty Council, county representa
tive in the Maryland State Teachers Associa
tion and on various other educational com
mittees.
Hendry was a 1941 graduate from Stanford
University. She received a California General
Secondary Certificate from UC-Los Angeles
in 1942 and an M.A. in education from Michi
gan State University in 1960.
