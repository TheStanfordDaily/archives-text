## BACK TO THE DESERT Unbeaten Card heads to Arizona for first time since '07, puts conference lead on the line 
### SAM SVOBODA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The No. 1 Stanford women's soccer
team travels to Arizona this weekend
to take on Arizona and Arizona State,
heading off on what could be the
team's final trip out of California until
the College Cup.
After this weekend, the Card will
only have three Pac-10 matches left
a trip across the Bay to Berkeley and
games against the Oregon schools at
home. Given its current ranking, Stan
ford will likely be playing at home for
the first four rounds of the NCAA
Tournament (if the team advances to
all of those rounds) before the Final
Four takes place in Cary, N.C.
But first the Cardinal must survive
the trip to the desert, which begins Fri
day night in Tempe against Arizona
State. ASU comes into the match with
a record of 8-3-2 (2-1-0 Pac-10), but has
not been on a great run of late. After
starting the season at an impressive 6-0-
l,the team has gone 2-3-1 since.
The Sun De vils do have a bit of mo
mentum now, however, and thanks to a
good conference start they are still in
third place in the Pac-10. ASU split its
games in Washington two weeks ago,
beating Washington State,l-0, but los
ing to Washington by the same score.
Last weekend the Sun Devils hosted
in-state rival Arizona and came away
with a 2-1 victory. An upset over Stan
ford would prove them to be legitimate
contenders in the conference.
Arizona, meanwhile, is looking to
gain respect after a rough start to the
season.The Wildcats are 4-8-2 and sit at
the bottom of the Pac-10 standings,
with a 0-3-0 conference record. Aside
from last weekend's loss to Arizona
State, they also lost a close 1-0 match to
Washington State, but were trounced
by Washington 4-1. They will play their
first conference game at home on Fri
day against Cal before hosting Stan
ford on Sunday at noon.
Although these are not the most
high-profile matches on Stanford's
schedule, the Card is still prepared for a
challenge in the desert.
"Both [Arizona and Arizona State]
are tough teams," said Stanford head
coach Paul Ratcliffe. "We'll have to re
ally show up and give good effort to get
the wins."

The Cardinal did just that last year,
winning relatively comfortably against
both of the Arizona schools when they
visited the Farm Stanford beat Ari
zona State 3-1 behind goals from Mari
ah Nogueira, Courtney Verloo and
Morgan Redman, and then clinched a
share of the Pac-10 title by beating Ari
zona 4-0. Kelley O'Hara tied the school
record for points in a single season dur
ing that game, and the Card also got
goals from Nogueira, Christen Press
and Teresa Noyola.
While O'Flara has since graduated,
every other player who scored for Stan
ford that weekend is still on the team.
In fact, Press has been breaking records
of her own, as she has claimed the Stan
ford career points and goals marks this
year. The forward is in incredible form,
and going into this weekend has 18
goals on the season and has scored in
nine consecutive matches.
Not that the streak crosses her mind
during the game, though.
"I don't think about it... when I'm
playing," Press said. "I just have been in
front of the goal so many times this year
[and] I've had so many good chances, it's
just about finding away to persevere
and get one in. I think,'l've got to get one
[of the chances], at least, in,' not 'l've got
to score this game [for the streak]."'

Senior Christen Press, above, has been a huge asset for the Cardinal this season. The forward from Palos Verdes
Estates, Calif, recently became Stanford's all-time leader in points and goals, and has scored in nine straight games.
