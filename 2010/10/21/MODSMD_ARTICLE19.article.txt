# East Coast gauntlet
## 
### JACK BLANCHAT 
The Stanford women's
lacrosse team embarks on a
championship challenge this
weekend, as the Card travels to
Philadelphia to take on three
top-10 teams this Saturday.
While the Card will be missing
Homecoming, the reason is most
definitely a good one, as it will
tangle with perennial power
houses Maryland, Virginia and

Pennsylvania.
Stanford capped off last
weekend's playday by knocking
off three Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation (MPSF) foes,
but the task gets elevated to a
new level this weekend at
Franklin Field, home of the
Quakers.
The highlight of the weekend
will be when the Card takes on
Maryland, the defending nation
al champion. Of course, Penn

and Virginia are no slouches ei
ther, as both made last year's
NCAA Tournament as well.
Maryland took home the na
tional title with a 13-11 victory over
Northwestern, which was ranked
No. 1 for most of the season.
The Northwestern-Maryland
matchup in the title game was es
pecially significant for the Ter
rapins, who were pining to knock

GAME NOTES : After powering through a trio of opponents
from the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation in their last
playday, the Cardinal is headed to the East Coast to take
on some much tougher opponents: All three of Stanford's
matches this Saturday are against top-10 teams.

off the Wildcats team that had cap
tured every national championship
since 2005, a streak of five in a row.
The Wildcats had commandeered
the top spot in women's lacrosse
from the Terps, who also had an im
pressive title streak of their own.
From 1995-2001, the Terps reeled
off seven straight national champi
onships, the third-longest streak of
consecutive championships in any
NCAA women's sport.
The Terps have had a tough test
in their fall schedule, having gone
on the road to face Virginia and
battled with both Vanderbilt and
Georgetown at home.
Stanford, their latest challenge, will
be looking to exact revenge on the
Terps, as Maryland beat the Card
20-8 last year in College Park, Md.
While the Cardinal will be hop
ing to get back at the Terrapins, the
Card's other two opponents have
an even bigger bone to pick with
the girls from Maryland. The Cava

liers lost once in the regular season
and once in the ACC Tournament
to the Terrapins, and Penn lost to
the Terps in the regular season and
in the quarterfinals of the NCAA
Tournament
Virginia finished ranked No. 5
last year and was bounced from the
NCAA Tournament by North Car
olina in the quarterfinals. The 17-7
loss to the Heels was especially sur
prising because the Cavaliers took
down the Tar Heels 13-12 in over
time during the regular season. The
Cavaliers only had three regular
season losses last year, including
one to James Madison, who ended
Stanford's season in the NCAA
Tournament.
The Card's final opponent,
Penn, finished the season ranked
No. 7 after it fell to Maryland in the
quarterfinals of the NCAA Tourna
ment. The Quakers finished with a
12-3 regular season record, good
enough for the Ivy League regular
season title. Penn completed the
Ivy double when it took home the
league's tournament title with a 9-8
victory over Dartmouth in the
championship game.
And while Maryland, Virginia

and Penn will steal the spotlight of
this weekend's schedule, the Cardi
nal will still have another playday on
Sunday. After Saturday's Penn
scrimmages, the Card will move to
Malvern, Pa., for scrimmages against
Drexel, St. Joseph's and Temple. The
three Sunday opponents struggled
last season, as the best record be
longed to Drexel, who finished 10-7
overall. Temple notched a 7-10
record and St. Joe's struggled to a 2-
14 regular season. None of the three
made the NCAA Tournament.
The Philadelphia weekend will
be the Cardinal's only trip away
from California this fall, but the
venture will be a return home for
many of the players on the Cardinal
roster. Seventeen of 27 team mem
bers hail from the greater Philadel
phia metropolitan area, including
11 players from Maryland.
Next weekend, the Card will take
a Halloween trip to UC-Davis for a
playday. The Cardinal will play Cal,
St. Mary's and UC-Davis in its last
series of intercollegiate games be
fore February.
