# East Coast gauntlet
## 
### JACK BLANCHAT 
The Stanford women's
lacrosse team embarks on a
championship challenge this
weekend, as the Card travels to
Philadelphia to take on three
top-10 teams this Saturday.
While the Card will be missing
Homecoming, the reason is most
definitely a good one, as it will
tangle with perennial power
houses Maryland, Virginia and

Pennsylvania.
Stanford capped off last
weekend's playday by knocking
off three Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation (MPSF) foes,
but the task gets elevated to a
new level this weekend at
Franklin Field, home of the
Quakers.
The highlight of the weekend
will be when the Card takes on
Maryland, the defending nation
al champion. Of course, Penn

and Virginia are no slouches ei
ther, as both made last year's
NCAA Tournament as well.
Maryland took home the na
tional title with a 13-11 victory over
Northwestern, which was ranked
No. 1 for most of the season.
The Northwestern-Maryland
matchup in the title game was es
pecially significant for the Ter
rapins, who were pining to knock

WOMEN'S LACROSSE
10/16 vs. FRESNO STATE
SAINT MARY'S, UC DAVIS 3-0
UP NEXT
MARYLAND, PENN, VIRGINIA
10/23 Philadelphia, Pa.
GAME NOTES : After powering through a trio of opponents
from the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation in their last
playday, the Cardinal is headed to the East Coast to take
on some much tougher opponents: All three of Stanford's
matches this Saturday are against top-10 teams.

Sophomore Carloyn Bradley, the Cardinal player on the right above, scores a goal against UC-Davis last weekend. Stanford will need continued contributions
from the midfielder, along with the rest of the team, when it faces one of its toughest tests of the season this weekend.
