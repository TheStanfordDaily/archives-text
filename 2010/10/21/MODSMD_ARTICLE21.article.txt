# Fixing soccer in America: part 2 of 2
## 
### Tom Taylor 
Last Friday, I wrote an article
arguing that the future of soc
cer may well lie in the hands
of the United States, not be
cause of its great interest in
the sport, but rather because of its apa
thy. Soccer wants to be big here, and so
the average American sports fan could
wield serious influence on the game.
I also drew up a short list of the
major problems with soccer from as
much of an American viewpoint as I
could. Now I want to analyze these and
propose some solutions that could not
just boost the sport's popularity here,
but would also be seen as a positive
step elsewhere.
Low scoring and ties
There is no way to change the fun
damental rules of soccer to increase
the number of goals scored without
changing what is a tried-and-true (and
hugely successful) format overseas, not
to mention alienating billions of fans.
Similarly, there is no good way to elim
inate ties, as FIFA's failed experiments
with golden and silver goals have
shown.

Even if American fans can't get
used to these aspects of the game, there
might still be an answer. Youth devel
opment in the United States could
concentrate on developing ball skills
and playing a fast, attacking game. The
combination of better offense with in
evitably weaker defense would make
tied games more rare and lead to more
goals scored.
Cheats and bad referees

Compared to pretty much every
other professional sport, soccer has
lagged behind in using technology to
help referees and to catch cheaters.
This is partly because the game has few
natural pauses in which to refer to
video evidence, but that is no real ex
cuse.

Goal-line technology would be a
start. Everyone has seen disallowed
goals that clearly crossed the line, and I
can even think of goals that went
nowhere near the line. It is easy to vili
fy referees for these mistakes, but if we
don't use technology to make their
lives easier, even the best will still get it
wrong occasionally.

Video evidence would also be a
vital tool in catching cheaters. It's not
possible to stop a game in the middle of
play to check the footage, but there are
still ways to integrate it. Reviewing the
game afterwards, it would be possible
to hand out red or yellow cards retro
spectively, and even take back cards
that were wrongly awarded. Though it
would be impossible to reverse the ac
tual result of the game, this would act
as a major deterrent for anyone inten
tionally cheating, knowing their ac
tions would never go completely un
noticed.

Understanding the game
One consequence of using more
technology at soccer games is that all
sorts of data could be amassed on what
happens during a game length of
passes, speed of shots, distance run, etc.
The list is virtually endless, and all sorts
of tables and charts could be drawn up
to compare the performances of differ
ent players and teams. Something like
the Hawk-Eye system used in tennis
and cricket would allow TV pundits to
replay shots from any angle and make
televised soccer more appealing to the
average American sports fan.

Major League sports
It is unlikely that any major foreign
soccer teams will play regular season
games in the United States any time
soon, because the idea is hugely un
popular with fans and the governing
bodies of the world game. But there
could still be away to do this. Occa
sionally teams are forced to play
games either behind closed doors or in
neutral locations, and I can't think of a
much more neutral location than the
United States. Perhaps America could
even bid to host the Champions
League Final one year.
The world's best players could also
be brought to these shores by creating
strong links between MLS teams and
the biggest clubs in Europe. Big teams
often loan out talented young players
so that they can gain vital match expe
rience, and U.S. teams could market
themselves as feeder teams. This could
mean some of the brightest young tal
ent coming to play here for a year or
two, and could perhaps bring the "sen
ior" players across now and then as
well.

It is also worth considering structur
ing the MLS more like soccer leagues
abroad rather than copying the major
U.S. sports. Across Europe, each coun-
