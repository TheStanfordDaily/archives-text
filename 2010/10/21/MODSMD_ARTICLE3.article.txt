# STUDENT LIFE
## More grads are choosing civic service Postgraduate public service rising in popularity, prestige

While many Stanford students dream of landing a
job at a Fortune 500 company or top consulting firm, a
growing number are pursuing public service options
after graduation. In recent years, postgraduate service
programs, such as Teach For America and Ameri-
Corps, have witnessed a surge in applications from
Stanford.
As Jim Murray, the Postgraduate Public Service
Program director at the Haas Center, puts it, "I think
that we have leaders who want to make change, and
they see public service as away to do that."
Murray estimates 100 to 120 Stanford students go
on to complete postgraduate service each year, either
through the Haas Center or external programs.
Today's millennial generation those born after
1982 grew up with public service as part of their
most basic education. More than 80 percent of current
high school students perform community service, ac
cording to Morley Winograd and Michael Hais in their
book "Millenial Makeover: MySpace, You Tube, and
the Future of American Politics." As a result, students
are endowed with a more conscientious and informed
worldview and are choosing to give back to their com
munities through public service, some say.
Lisa Hoffman, the Teach for America (TFA) on
campus recruiting director, noted the competitiveness
of the program. In 2009, TFA received 35,178 applica
tions and had a 15 percent acceptance rate, she said.
Postgraduate fellowships through the Haas Center
have also noted an increase in applications, according
to Murray, who said postgraduate service offers real
life, entry-level experience in sectors that may other
wise be difficult to break in to. It can also better define
students' interests and how they could best use a grad
uate degree, if they choose to go on to graduate school.
Finally, postgraduate service often makes an applicant
more attractive to graduate schools.
Murray also said service careers have become in
creasingly attractive due to the professionalization of
the non-profit and public service sectors. With in
creased funding, many nonprofits offer competitive
salaries, especially compared to companies that have
had to cut back due to the economic recession.
Christine O'Connell 'OB said she chose TFA in
order to address the issue of educational inequity. She
served as a high school biology teacher at a charter
school in Brooklyn and will continue her passion for
serving underserved students by completing her doc
torate in ecology at the University of Minnesota and
becoming a professor.
Of her experience with TFA, O'Connell said, "I
never once wished I hadn't done it."
Hoffman estimates that, after TFA, about one
third of teachers stay in education, one-third go on to
work with non-profits and related fields, and the re-
