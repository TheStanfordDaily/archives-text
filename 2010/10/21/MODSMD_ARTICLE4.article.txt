## Obama to fundraise in Palo Alto today 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF – Devin Banerjee 
President Obama's motorcade is scheduled to skim
past the Stanford campus this evening as Obama returns
to the Bay Area today for two Democratic fundraisers.
According to the White House, Obama will land in
San Francisco at 3 p.m., after which he will head to the
Palo Alto home of Marissa Mayer '97 M.S. '99, a vice
president at Google. There, he will attend a $30,000-per
person fundraiser for 50 Democrats, according to media
reports.
The fundraiser was originally to take place at Mayer's
apartment in the Four Seasons Hotel in San Francisco,
but it was moved earlier this week for unknown reasons.
One reason floated by media outlets is the Major
League Baseball's National League Championship Se
ries, which is expected bring 40,000 San Francisco Giants
fans to the city for Game 5 against the Philadelphia
Phillies.
Obama later will head to Atherton, where he will
host a Democratic National Committee re
ception at the home of Steve Westly '7B MBA
'B3, the former state controller of California.
The purpose of the president's visit to
Northern California, according to a White
House press release, is two-fold: to headline
events for the DNC and to campaign for
San Francisco district attorney Kamala
Harris, who is running to be the first woman
and first African-American attorney gener
al of California. Harris was an early and
strong supporter of Obama's bid for the
presidency.
Obama will spend the night in the Bay Area
before leaving early Friday for Los Angeles.
There, he will campaign for Democratic guber
natorial candidate Jerry Brown, Democratic
lieutenant governor candidate Gavin Newsom
and Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Cali£) at various
events, including at a rally at the University of
Southern California.
