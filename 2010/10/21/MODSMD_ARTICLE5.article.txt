# Recession effects may linger in S.F.
## New distress survey makes use of current economic data 
### SAMANTHA McGIRR DESK EDITOR 
A "distress index" developed jointly by the Stanford
Center for the Study of Poverty and Inequality and New
America Media and released in September reveals the
worsening economic state of San Francisco's most vulnera
ble residents and may shed light on where improvement in
public policy can provide the most help.
According to the report, entitled "Measuring Economic
Distress in San Francisco," "since December 2007 (the first
official month of the great recession), economic distress in
San Francisco has increased a full 100 percent."
The index was based on 11 indicators of economic hard
ship, including CaIWORKS enrollment, CaIWORKS
homeless-assistance requests, bankruptcies, food-stamp ap
plications, food-pantry visits, MediCal enrollment, Healthy
San Francisco enrollment, foreclosures, unemployment and
County Adult Assistance Program participation.
According to Chris Wimer, the lead researcher on the
project and the associate director of the center, the new dis
tress index is meant to address the limited scope of current
poverty statistics, such as those released annually by the U.S.
Census Bureau, that rely primarily on factors such as income
and size of family.
"The official poverty stats are really flawed," he said.
"They don't take into account the cost of living, all the things
that people need to spend money on now in terms of food,
clothing, shelter.These indicators are built around [a] basket
of resources that people use now to make ends meet."
Additionally, Wimer says, current poverty statistics are
published a year after their collection, further limiting their
usefulness.
"Right now we only know numbers for 2009," he said. "It
won't be until fall 2011 that we know the numbers for 2010."
All data in the index are up to date through June 2010,
with plans to update the index as data become available.The
San Francisco-based news site The Public Press published
an early version of the index in June, when it was titled the
"Misery Index." Executive Director Michael Stoll notes that
the trends revealed by the index suggest fundamental errors
with the methods that policymakers use to track poverty.
"Ten of the 11 markers changed in the same direction,"
Stoll said. "The Obama administration declared that the re
cession ended last year, but this measure argues the opposite

the recession, as felt by the most vulnerable amongst us,
is getting worse."
While 10 measures showed upward trends, indicating in
creased need for social service, CaIWORKS enrollment has
decreased in this "Great Recession." These trends, Wimer
said, might reveal the relative efficacy of various social pro
grams and help communities determine where to direct re
sources.
"The index can determine which services are working
and which aren't," Wimer said. "The food pantry, for exam
ple, is doing a great job to ramp up services. CaIWORKS is
not showing as much of an increase, maybe because that
program isn't being as responsive to underlying indication
of need."
The Distress Index project, underwritten by the San
Francisco Foundation and the Wallace Alexander Ger
bode Foundation, further reveals that current distress is 76
percent higher than the average level of distress during the

dot-com bust of the early 2000s, and al
most double levels at the start of the
Great Depression.
Sandy Close, the executive director
of New America Media, which co-de
veloped the project, says the index has
tremendous potential not only to en
able journalists to understand histori
cal trends but also make sense of eco
nomic facts and figures.
"We as reporters have a hard time
unpacking the economic data and get
ting a real sense of what's going on
around us," she said.
Though the San Francisco project
made use of county data, since the city
is coterminous with the county, Close

called it a "provisional first step" and
expressed hope that similar indicators
could be collected in other counties
and subsets developed for individual
cities. Such indexes, she says, make it
easier to gauge not only hardship but
improvement.
"I would like to see the distress
index turned into a hope index," she
said. "It would be exciting if the indica
tors showed improvement."
