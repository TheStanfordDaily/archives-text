## Study gives a new meaning to 'viral' technology 
### VIVIAN SHEN 
With the onset of flu season comes a new way
to transfer illnesses prized electronic devices,
including iPhones, Blackberrys and similar gadg
ets.
A recent study co-authored by Stanford Uni
versity graduate student Timothy Julian found that
about 20 to 30 percent of viruses are transferred
from the glass, like that of touch-screen interfaces,
to fingers.This adds just one more way for students
to catch the flu or other diseases.
"Our research study originally looked at how
well viruses transfer," Julian said, "because we
don't know how important different modes of
transfer are for communicable infectious diseases
like influenza, the common cold and gastrointesti
nal diseases."
Julian said diseases like influenza are passed
through surfaces and airborne particles, but they
didn't know how well surfaces transferred these
diseases. All results were from lab-based data; vol
unteers seeded their hands with bacteria phage
virus, then touched glass surfaces. The amount of
virus left on the fingertips or transferred to the
glass represented the transferability of the virus.
As he discovered, glass is a very effective
fomite, or object capable of transferring infectious
agents. The germs from the glass touch-screens get
onto fingers or other body parts, which in turn
poses serious health risks, as there is a high proba
bility that these viruses go directly to the nose and
mouth, the most direct pathways to infection.
The practical implications of his study extend to
many commonly used surfaces and items, includ
ing touch-screen devices. If someone coughs on his
or her hand and then borrows a phone, the chances
of transferring that disease increase exponentially.
This danger is not reserved specifically to touch
screens; glass was simply used as a proxy in the ex
periment, and the results could potentially be ex
tended to doorknobs, toilet flush handles and

countertops.
Yann Meunier of the Stanford School of Medi
cine Health Improvement Program added general
tips to reduce the spread of pathogens.
"It is easiest to catch diseases in public places,"
he said. "There are people coughing and sneezing
at concerts, conferences and sports events. Trans
mission of germs is within 6 feet, so stay away from
sick people."
He also added that general precautions include
"washing hands, covering coughs with elbows,
wearing warm clothing [viruses are easier to catch
when weakened from the cold], eating well, sleep
ing well and having basically a sound lifestyle."
If students are already sick, "stay home for 24
hours after the fever has subsided and then go
back to work or classes," Meunier suggests. "If you
can, have a separate bedroom or bathroom, stay in
bed, and get a lot of fluid because the body loses
water and salt. Don't share food or dishes with oth
ers. Viruses can stay alive for hours outside the
body."
He notes that studies have shown the virus still
alive after 17 days. Julian agrees.
"My personal recommendations if you're al
ready sick are to stay home until you feel better,
because it's better to stay than get others sick," he
said.
In regard to touch-screens specifically, it never
even occurred to some students that they could be
potential vehicles for spreading germs.
"I've never thought about it," says Brianna
Griffin 'll, "but I don't like it when sick people
touch any of my stuff. I am fully in favor of Lysol
ing."
Julian couldn't agree more.
"If you have to go out, make sure you're wash
ing your hands and wash surfaces. If you're specif
ically concerned about devices, use screen replace
ments or alcohol wipes."

Two students look at an iPhone. According to a recent study, about 20
to 30 percent of all pathogens are transferred from glass such as that
found on touchscreen devices.
