## John Wayne's masculine identity crisis? 
### MOLLY K. VORWERCK 
Imagine this: John Wayne lying on a psycholo
gist's couch, lamenting the loss of his manhood.
Clint Eastwood fervently writing to Dear
Abby, asking for a cure to his manly insecuri
ties. Sylvester Stallone perusing a bookstore,
searching for "How To Retain Masculinity for Dum
mies." Silly, huh?
Not so fast, say some scholars. A new branch of ac
ademia, male studies, has reached professors at Wag
ner College, Rutgers University and McGill Univer
sity in recent months, a movement that argues that
feminist studies has threatened the stability of the
contemporary male identity, one which might not be
as secure as those of Dirty Harry or Rambo.
On the Facebook page for the Foundation for
Male Studies, the up-and-coming academic group
spearheading this movement, articles abound justify
ing the need to address this supposed crisis. One such
article involves the decreasing ratio of men to
women attending four-year colleges and universities,
and another addresses the statistic that women "for
the first time ever" make up the majority of the work
force due to layoffs associated with the economic re
cession.
In a recent New York Times article, male-studies
proponent and resident scholar at the American En
terprise Institute Christina Hoff Sommers says that
"male-averse attitudes are widespread in the United
States" due in part to feminist studies and the fact
that masculinity has become a social taboo.
While the foundation cites its underlying goal as
studying "the male as male," one cannot ignore its
rather apparent anti-feminism. Even its brothers
within academia are refusing to take part in this pro
gram. For instance, The Men's Studies Association,
established in 1991 to promote the scholarship of
masculinity, denied an invitation to speak at an April
conference for the Foundation at Wagner College.

So, what does Stanford have to think about this
new branch of study?
According to intended feminist-studies major
Miranda Mammen 'l4, "feminist studies, women's
studies and gender studies across the country are
doing a really good job of tackling what it means to
be a man and conventional constructions of mas
culinity. I think it's a misconception that they only
study women, because the study of women's roles
necessarily includes men."
"My biggest problem with the male studies phe
nomenon ... is that it's an explicitly anti-feminist
platform," she continued. "The creators of male stud
ies have argued that the presence of feminist and
gender studies is harmful to them, which is really
ridiculous."
Mark Diaz 'l4, an intended psychology and lin
guistics double major, "understands the idea" of
male studies, "but if you were to look at the big scope
of things, you could say that eveiything you learn has
been taught with a bias towards men, so I think it's
fair for feminism to try and balance the scale."
History Prof. Matthew Sommer considers the
male studies movement "very much part of a kind of
anxious backlash against feminism.
"It seems to me that some scholars, mostly men,
seem very insecure and defensive about feminism,"
Sommer said. "They seem to think that men are vic
tims."
That Sommer, as well as many other feminist
studies and history professors at Stanford, was only
nominally familiar with the male studies movement
may be indicative of the movement's limited media
exposure and its irrelevance to the broader academ
ic community. In fact, Sommer's familiarity extended
to only a few articles he had read to prepare for his
interview with The Daily.
Despite his minimal exposure to the movement,
Sommer argues that these academics "don't confess
to being anti-feminist."
"But what are they trying to defend?" he ques

tioned. "What are
they trying to re
habilitate?"
Sommer an
ticipates that
gender depart
ments across the
country will be be
mused by this idea of
male studies because
"it's odd to hear that
men are the victims"
and that very few aca
demic institutions, if
any, will welcome it as a legitimate
field of study.
On the question of whether Stanford
will create a home for male studies, Som
mer laughed. "No, [it's] certainly not welcome.
The idea that men are oppressed in society is ab
surd."
While most male studies critics on the Stanford
campus believe that the movement is largely irrele
vant, some students feel otherwise.
"If there were to be a male-studies class, then it
needs to approach its studies in the same way that
feminists approach theirs," Alisa Parrett 'l3 suggest
ed. Male studies "shouldn't try to side-step feminism
in the name of being politically correct. It shouldn't
be cowering in a corner trying to be nice to feminists."
So, back to the beginning: is it really so preposter
ous to find John Wayne on the psychologist's couch?
"There are good parts and there are bad parts to
feminism," said Angela Torres 'l3. "And if you pres
ent it unbiased, then, you know, guys can make their
decision."
Maybe man's favorite gunslinger shouldn't cancel
that appointment just yet.
