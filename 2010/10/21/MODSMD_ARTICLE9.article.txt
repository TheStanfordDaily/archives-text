Reyna Garcia 'll walks into Roble Library wearing shorts and
a "Beat Cal" shirt. At quick glance, she looks just like any
other student. You would never guess that in April 2009, she

At the time, Garcia's video was the most well-documented instance
of Rice engaging students in back-and-forth conversation on controver

terrogation techniques used during the Bush presidency.
Luckily for viewers, Garcia believes she managed to get the most in
teresting part of the night on video.
"I was there for most of the reception," Garcia said. "She was just
