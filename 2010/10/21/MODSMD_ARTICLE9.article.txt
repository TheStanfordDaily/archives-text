## Catch up with Reyna Garcia, the student behind the 2009 video that got thousands of hits 
### BILLY GALLAGHER 
Reyna Garcia 'll walks into Roble Library wearing shorts and
a "Beat Cal" shirt. At quick glance, she looks just like any
other student. You would never guess that in April 2009, she
filmed a video of Condoleezza Rice that got more than
360,000 hits and 3,000 comments on You Tube.
The video captures on film a student reception for political science
Prof. Condoleezza Rice, former U.S. secretary of state. As a group of
protestors demonstrated outside Roble Hall, the location of the
event, Garcia videotaped Rice defending the use of interrogation tech
niques under the Bush administration.
Garcia admits she never expected the video to skyrocket in popular
ity as it did.
"At first I just thought I would e-mail it to the dorm list because some
people missed the event and were kind of wondering what went on,"
Garcia said. "I just kind of e-mailed it out to the dorm and to TYT [The
Young Turks] too because I follow them."
Soon after posting the video on You Tube, Garcia received e-mails
and phone calls from major news networks.
"A lot of them just wanted the original footage, but some wanted in
teresting quotes or more information about the event or more about me
or more about the people asking questions," she said. "There was a NBC
story that I was on. I was on TYT, The Young Turks. They were the ones
that originally posted to Huffington Post, which is where they picked up
the story. Once it got on Huffington Post it really exploded."
At the time, Garcia's video was the most well-documented instance
of Rice engaging students in back-and-forth conversation on controver
sial topics. It was also Rice's first publicized response at Stanford to in
terrogation techniques used during the Bush presidency.
Luckily for viewers, Garcia believes she managed to get the most in
teresting part of the night on video.
"I was there for most of the reception," Garcia said. "She was just
making the rounds with the students. [Taking the video] was just kind of
impromptu and everyone had their
cameras because we were there tak
ing pictures. Everyone was invited
to bring their cameras for pictures."
Rice and Garcia have not spoken
since the You Tube video gained na
tional attention.
When asked for a comment for
this story, staff in Rice's office
replied that they were too busy be
cause of her book tour.
Garcia expressed interest in con
versing one-on-one with Rice in the
future, particularly on the decisions
Rice made while in office.
"I would definitely want to per
haps press on the torture issue and
why she is so adamant about sticking
to the position of waterboarding not
being torture," Garcia said.
Although she has received sup
portive feedback from friends, fami
ly and even strangers, Garcia ac
knowledged that not all the respons
es to her You Tube video have been
positive.
"Anonymous people on
You Tube send hateful e-mails every
once in a while," she said. "Often
they go on very personal attacks to
wards me or the other students who
were asking the questions, and that
was the hardest thing to deal with at
first. But I realized 1 don't need to
worry about what they think about
me, especially since I don't know
them ... I still get some hate mail
even today from random people on
You Tube."
Garcia hopes that the very real
possibility of negative backlash will
not discourage other professors or
people of Rice's stature from dis
cussing contentious issues with stu
dents.
"I mean, people like Dr. Rice,
they're public figures ... that's kind
of the response her staff gave after
the event," Garcia said. "They know
that what they say is subject to re
sponse. I would hope that that would
n't make them nervous."
Garcia, a Los Angeles native, will
graduate this spring to an undecided
future. Currently in the process of
applying to jobs and graduate
schools, she likes to think that the
Rice incident won't dampen her
prospects.
"I would hope it wouldn't really
affect anyone's opinion of me," she
said. "I don't know. I don't think
anyone would want to take the time
to Google me. That seems kind of
random."
In any case, Garcia has taken
away an important lesson from the
Rice-YouTube experience: students
have every right to engage in open
dialogue with visiting speakers.

"Just take advantage of the fact
that Stanford does offer you the op
portunity to interact with people
such as Condoleezza Rice and other
important heads of states or former
