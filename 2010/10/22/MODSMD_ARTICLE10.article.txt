## GSB research reveals deception in corporate management 
### PATRICIA HO 
A company's "fantastic earnings"
may not be so great after all, accord
ing to a recent study co-authored by
David Larcker, finance professor at
the Graduate School of Business
(GSB) and M.B.A. student Anasta
sia Zakolyukina. The study analyzes
CEO conference calls to shed light
on the linguistic methods used by de
ceptive corporate managers.

"It's an important thing for corpo
rate governance to understand
whether people are dealing in a
truthful matter or not," Larcker said.
"When someone releases their ac
counting reports, you'd like to know
whether you actually believe those
numbers, or if they have been manip
ulated in some form."
According to the study, deceptive
executives tend to refer to general
knowledge while speaking, using

blanket phrases such as "as you
know" to boost credibility with lis
teners. Deceivers also use signifi
cantly fewer self-references while
speaking, substituting third person
pronouns for the word "I" to avoid
taking ownership of false statements.
Zakolyukina was surprised to
find that deceiving chief executives
and chief financial officers (CFO) ac
tually use extremely positive lan
guage "fantastic" or "great" to

describe earnings and avoid reveal
ing mediocre results.
For example, in a March 2008
earnings conference call, former
Lehman Brothers CFO Erin Callan
used phrases like "very strong client
flows" and "a robust trading environ
ment." Such examples of extreme
positive language allow deceptive
speakers to sound more persuasive
while concealing the truth.
Furthermore, the use of swear

words, usually indicative of negative
emotions, only occurs minimally and
is not statistically significant.
"In our results, we only found
swear words in just one case, in a very
specific setting," Zakolyukina said.
"But for some reason, perhaps be
cause of the famous Enron case, the
idea of swear words [as an indicator
of deception] was developed and
propagated."
To verify that CEOs were being

truthful during a conference call, the
study analyzes subsequent changes
to stated earnings from previous
quarters. A correction signified that
the call was deceptive.

"We have to assume that if the
company makes a restatement, the
executive at the time of the confer
ence call knew about it and his lan
guage will exhibit deception," Za
kolyukina said.

Unlike most research efforts to
predict company manipulation, Za
kolyukina and Larcker chose to ana
lyze the question-and-answer sec
tion of earnings conference calls for
their spontaneous nature, which al
lows less room for language manipu
lation.

"Some papers try to look at the
language used in financial reports,"
Zakolyukina said. "But all the formal
reporting is screened through the
legal department of the company, so
they are well-prepared pieces of
text."

Additionally, conference calls
have the added benefit of a quarterly
schedule, which added regularity and
specificity to Larcker and Zakolyuk
ina's long-term study of deceptive
language.

"We've seen that no matter how
the reports were manipulated, if the
manager knows about it at the time
of the conference calls, the more like
ly the way he speaks will give out that
he's hiding something," Zakolyukina
said.

M.B.A. student Aaron Gelband
MBA, who is co-president of the
GSB's Finance and Investment Club,
has investments in Perry Capital and
previously worked for Goldman
Sachs, said that while the study pro
vided insight into the methods of de
ception in corporate management,
the findings do not always indicate
dishonesty.
"I will caution that although the
results are statistically significant,
only 60 percent of instances in man
agement statements would suggest
that they were actually being dishon
est," Gelband added. "Even if they
displayed signs that are typically in
dicative of dishonesty, you still have
to treat that with a grain of salt."
Despite its relevance in language
research, Gelband said the study
will not have any substantial effects
on his post-graduation plans be
cause of its limited professional and
practical implications.
"I don't think it's going to sub
stantially change the way I do any
thing after business school," Gel
band continued. "But it will make
me a little more thoughtful and
aware about the type of language
that management uses."

In fact, Larcker cautioned that
the study only provides a prelimi

nary view of corporate deception.
"We found some results, but
there's plenty of work to do," Larck
er said. "The idea of using language
to understand behavior is a very ac
tive research area and it requires
skills across various areas."
But he is optimistic that despite
the difficulties of analyzing an inter
disciplinary subject, added research
may eventually apply these findings
to situations outside of a corporate
setting.
Since deceptive-language re
search is new, "it's going to be risky
as well," Larcker said. "But presum
ably, that's what we're supposed to
do with our research."
