## ART OF DISPLAY Cantor seeks to use technology and flexibility to evolve display design 
### JAMES LANCASTER 
There is more to visiting the Cantor Arts
Center than simply observing an isolat
ed painting or sculpture. An imperative
part of the museum experience is some
thing less tangible: the art of designing
and arranging exhibits.
Though largely overlooked, designing exhibits
to engage and interact with viewers is an essential
concern for any museum curator. And for Pa
tience Young and Kristen Olson of the Cantor
Arts Center, the art of placing art might just be as
important as the art itself.
Young, curator for education at Cantor, ex
plained how Cantor seeks to create a unique har
mony in its exhibit design.

"Our goal is to set the art off in the best envi
ronment for it," she said. "We want the setting to
work for each work of art."
Designing exhibits is a laborious process, and it
involves a careful contemplation of many factors.
Wall colors, lighting, surrounding architecture and
even surrounding pieces are all considered by
Cantor's curators in placing art.
"A work of art will speak very differently de
pending on its context," Young said. "Curators
think long and hard about what they're going to
juxtapose."
Young cited the placement of "Seaweed," a
Georgia O'Keefe painting, next to Edward West
on's photograph of a cabbage leaf as an example
of the relationship between works of art in an ex
hibit.
"The sinuous lines and curves speak to each

other directly," she said. "When that photograph
changes out, the new relationship will be com
pletely different."
Although Cantor has always experimented
with various components of design, technology
has become an increasingly important factor in
designing exhibits at Cantor.
Like many museums around the world, Cantor
is now turning to technology to enhance the view
ing experience. The center is currently testing QR
tags, which allow visitors to access information
about a particular work of art by scanning an
image with a cell phone.
Users of most smart phones can download free
software that will allow them to scan QR images.
After scanning an image with a phone's camera,
they are then directed to Web pages where they
can learn more about particular works for art.

For Kristen Olson, Cantor's academic and edu
cational technology liaison, technologies like QR
tags are an integral component in designing in
formative and engaging exhibits.
"The idea is to have the cell phone be another
tool to interact with the viewer," she said. "Tech
nology allows us to explore something that isn't
necessarily explained by a label."
Olson explained how Cantor uses technology
like video clips to educate and inform its visitors.
To accompany the work of Martin Blank, a con
temporary glass artist, the museum created a short
video of the glass making process. Designed to af
ford viewers a better understanding of Blank's
work, the clip provides an engaging experience
that can't be offered by the typical label.

Cantor's use of technology has
even expanded to reach visitors
when they aren't at the exhibits. One
can learn more about Cantor and its
exhibits by watching guided art tours
on Cantor's website. These multime
dia podcasts consist of commentary
on selected works of art by Mark
Feldman, a Program in Writing and
Rhetoric lecturer.

Although Cantor has already
substantially changed the way it ap
proaches the design of its exhibits,
Young said that design at Cantor will
continue to evolve.

"Over time, curators have come
around to a better understanding of
what visitors are interested in and
how they approach works of art,"
Young said. "Even the way curators
approach art is changing immense
ly-"

A willingness to experiment with
new methods of design is something
that Young said is essential to ap
pealing to Stanford's wide range of
interests.

"In designing exhibits, we en
deavor to reach all Stanford stu
dents," Young said. "We hope to
offer something for everyone, what
ever their disciplines and interests
are."
