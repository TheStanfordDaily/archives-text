# Turning the Beat Around
## LSJUMB spunk reflects 1960s roots 
### CAMILLE BROWN 
It's a chilly, fall Monday evening, and most Stanford stu
dents can be found pent up in the library or eating din
ner in a quiet dining hall that is, except for a cohort
of students jumping up and down, doing the pelvic
thrust in time to Styx's "Blue Collar Man."
Welcome to the typical weekly Leland Stanford Junior
University Marching Band (LSJUMB) rehearsal. Bright-or
ange earplugs are issued to the members trickling in, and a
small whiteboard lists the agenda for the day scrawled in
green dry-erase marker: "Ignorance, Lovecats, Uptight,
Frankenstein ... etc."
The typical warm-up exercise involves losing one's shoes
and grooving with instruments as if they are dance partners
while the Band familiarizes itself with old songs. The "Clair
picks" section even strikes up a kick-line.
Some read their music off traditional stands, but many just

mimic others around them, not really
caring if they play out of tune. As Ar
ianna Vogel 'l4 nonchalantly put it
after admitting she has no idea how to
play her trombone, "You have to
learn not to care that you're making a
fool out of yourself."
To say the least, this is not a typical
college band rehearsal. In fact, com
pared with any traditional marching
band, the Stanford Band could very
well be construed as utter chaos.
Discipline and dignity may seem
like the natural pillars of a marching
band, but the LSJUMB is just plain
fun. After all, it's run by Stanford stu
dents for the sheer purpose of enter
taining other Stanford students.
Peter "Shotgun" McDonald, the
Toobz Sexion Leader for the Band, de
scribed how the LSJUMB sees its role.
"There is a lot of arbitrary follow
ing of authority and doing what
you're told in the marching band
process," said McDonald, who is also
a Daily columnist. "And at more aca
demically prestigious universities like
Stanford, people see through the au
thority and see that their purpose is to
entertain."
And entertain they do. From the
traditional Band Run to its quirky
half time shows, the Band captures all
the suppressed energy Stanford stu
dents have building under the surface
of their otherwise academically ori

ented lives.
So how did the LSJUMB get to be
so wild? Apparently, the Band was
once as reverent as its full name sug
gests, until a restructuring of the
music department in 1963 resulted in
the dismissal of the then- director
Jules Schucat. To protest what it saw
as an injustice, the Band went on
strike and refused to play at the first
two football games of 1963.
Finally, Schucat's replacement,
Arthur P. Barnes, thought of a com
promise to get the Band back on the
field: Barnes would allow the Band to
be a student-run organization and the
Band would play at football games
again. The freewheeling 1960s plus
the student direction of the Band
gave it the rambunctious spirit it still
has today.
The 1960s rebirth of the LSJUMB
is still seen in both the pictures on the
wall the Band Shak and the alumni
who come to jam with the band every
so often. And as the Band's faculty
advisor, John Giancarlo, said over the
deafening roar of "Turn the Beat
Around," "This year the Band is bet
ter musically than ever before." Half
the Band members openly admitted
they started Band not being able to
read sheet music.
Despite its cult-like mystique, the
Band offers a tight-knit community
where any Stanford student who
wants to be a musician can be consid
ered one. As junior Kevin "Yogi" Fis
cher put it, "Anybody can rock out."
