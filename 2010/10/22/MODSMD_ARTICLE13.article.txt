## OH, SWEET NUTHIN'! Peep Psychology

This column originally ran on July 8,2010.
There's an old psych study colloquially
referred to as "the Marshmallow Ex
periment." It was originated by Stan
ford's Walter Mischel in the sixties and has
since been repeated many times over. In the
test, a four-year-old is seated in a room with a
marshmallow in front of him. He is told he'll
be left alone for fifteen minutes. He can eat
the marshmallow now, but if he waits until
the experimenter comes back, he can have
another marshmallow in addition to this one.
The experimenter leaves, and the child is
videotaped battling his will. Adorableness
ensues.
Something like 70 percent of kids succeed
at waiting. Almost all the rest struggle and
fail, succumbing to fluffy temptation. The re
sults of the test are correlated, unscientifical
ly speaking, with overall performance in life:
SAT scores, level of education, income and so
on. The patient child has already learned to
suppress his impulse for immediate gratifica
tion, opening up many doors for him later in
life. The impatient child's will, on the other
hand, is like the marshmallow he has such
trouble resisting: soft, yielding, insubstantial.
His will be a life of indulging now and suffer
ing the consequences later.
Robert Sapolsky, a Stanford neurology
professor, would likely say the predictive
power of the marshmallow marker is a clear
demonstration of the biological basis of per
sonality. Marshmallow-now children are
more likely to fall into substance addiction or
lives of crime. And Sapolsky's all about
showing that we punish people for things
they're ultimately not responsible for (exam
ple: burning schizophrenics at the stake for
witchcraft). But the armchair biologist in me
is more interested in the evolution of the
temptation than its underlying anatomy. Why
is it so darn hard (because even for the suc
cessful kids, it is hard: their legs swinging like
little pendula, their eyes fixed ceiling-ward,
counting tiles and fiercely avoiding the plate
in front of them) to resist that marshmallow?
Once we've decided it's better to defer our
gratification, why are we battling our bodies
at every turn until the matter is out of our
hands? How could twisting ourselves into
these knots ever be adaptive?
The answer I've reached is pretty straight
forward. Before I spell it out, let me attempt
a convoluted illustration of my point: a new
variation on the Marshmallow Experiment.
A child is left in the room with the marshmal
low and the same instructions as before. She
is left to hang there for a good ten minutes,
tugging at her braids, fighting her impulses.
Then a man in a gorilla suit bursts through
the door, gobbles up the marshmallow and
runs out. (Caveat: this will likely make many
children cry.)
I don't expect this to yield any valuable
predictive measures, and I wouldn't even
know how to start quantifying reactions, be
yond maybe timing the ensuing tantrums. (I
do, however, think that this is fertile ground
for hilarious You Tube videos. The scripted

sketch-comedy version might be even better.
The researcher could return and act very
upset that the marshmallow is gone, then
threaten some silly British penalty as his go
rilla-suited minions seize the subject to carry
him away. Just a thought.) What this version
does do is provide us with a context in which
the marshmallow-now phenotype wins. The
body beats the will, and it turns out better for
everyone in the end.
Our bodies are adapted to an uncertain
world, one in which it is much more likely
that food will be snatched from under our
noses than it is that we'll be awarded more
for merely waiting to eat it. I think that al
most all of the children believe that the ex
perimenter is prepared to uphold his side of
the deal. But here our bodies seem to know
what our minds so often forget: you can't log
ically predict the future. There's no guaran
tee that the first marshmallow will still be
here fifteen minutes from now, nor that the
experimenter will ever return, nor that the
building won't collapse (and you'd definitely
be glad for the extra energy in the immediate
aftermath of an earthquake-induced apoca
lypse). Your body wants to force you to take
the sure thing now rather than gamble on in
duction a hard-coded impulse to live for
the present.

As Stanford students, chances are we
were in the marshmallows-later category.
And Stanford is, in many ways, one big series
of marshmallow experiments. This is why our
bodies rebel when we spend a Friday night
coding instead of going out it recognizes
that we're investing in a future that just might
not be. If we're going to win, we can never
forget the reality of that risk, and we should
always know just what it is that we're waiting
for. Some marshmallows are sweeter or surer
than others.

later? Place an order at rcima@stanford.edu.
