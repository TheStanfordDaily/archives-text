# SENSE AND NONSENSE
## The 						Meaning of Teaching 
### Aysha Bagchi 
Whenever I reflect on the greatest
teachers in my life, the idea of dis
cussing why we should value teach
ing seems silly. It feels like devoting energy to
discussing why universities should admit
women or provide financial aid. To those
lucky enough to have had it, the value of
great teaching is felt everyday. The question
seems profoundly obvious.

But then I remember that, from the lens of
a major research university, things can look
different. When the growing knowledge pro
duced at Stanford not only ups us in the rank
ings, but also truly has huge, positive effects
on a wider world, it is easy to see how teach
ing becomes something that we don't just
forget to value, but really don't think should
be valued too much.

I still remember a university administra
tor informing me three years ago (naive
freshman that I was) that faculty members
with tremendous research but weak teaching
will probably still get tenure, but a phenome
nal teacher with less than stellar research
never will. Great teachers at Stanford are
great because they want to be, often in spite
of an incentive structure that disincentivizes
their devotion to teaching.
The University's justification is one of re
turns. Fostering a faculty culture of taking
teaching seriously certainly won't help us in
the U.S. News rankings, and if it comes at the
expense of pioneering research, it may actu
ally bring us down. More significantly, some
believe the public service value of research is
much more profound than that of the person
al dedication of a great mind to students, and
in this light, Stanford has a moral obligation
to skew the balance far in favor of research.

It is a reality that pioneering research has
the potential to provide profound benefits
for the world. Part of the excitement sur-

rounding the idea of research is just that: the
results are not fully known and possibilities
can seem boundless. Through research, we
contribute to humanity everyday. But the
same is just as true perhaps even more so
when it comes to teaching bright young
students.

Almost anyone who makes a profound
difference in the world does so because
someone made a profound difference in her
life, and so often that person was a teacher. It
is difficult for a university to measure these
differences, especially because students
rarely develop in ways that match our hy
potheses, but it should not be too difficult to
recognize that in capturing some of the best
students in the U.S. and around the world,
from a public service standpoint, Stanford
has an unbelievable chance to make us lead
ers of a different sort, to help us shift our tra
jectory and wrestle with all the wisdom and
guidance Stanford's faculty could offer.
And, importantly, the biggest infusions of
motivation and moral awareness often come
in personal ways. They involve igniting a stu
dent's curiosity, taking her seriously, illustrat
ing how what she learns relates to the world
and her experiences and helping her see a vi
sion of her future self to work toward. They
involve passionate commitment to helping
students become all we can be. When that

commitment is there, the returns though
they may be neglected in the rankings are
huge.

Thinking about the returns of teaching is a
very important task, one Stanford should de
vote more time to. But the truth is, when I
think about the value of teaching, my heart
isn't in arguments about returns.They are im
portant, but they fail to capture teaching's
most central value. That value isn't discov
ered when we are always caught up in objec
tives, in thinking about the next step and how
we are going to get there. It is discovered
when we slow down to reflect. In these mo
ments, we begin to remember why a universi
ty holds such enchantment in people's imag
inations, why, for example, the names "Ox
ford" or "Harvard" inspire awe when uttered
on almost any corner of the globe. The uni
versity is a site for something special.
The deepest meaning to be found at a uni
versity a place of growing knowledge
about the world is in the sharing that takes
place between teacher and student when a
teacher helps a student expand her world. It
is experienced in the gratitude a student feels
when a teacher has helped her become her
better self and the gratitude a teacher feels in
being part of that development. The poten
tial returns of such relationships are enor
mous, but to find their deepest value we need
look no further than the present. The essen
tially non-economic element involved in
teaching is about meaning, about the flour
ishing that takes place when a teacher's intel
lectual firepower and guidance help foster
fruition; that element is part of a university's
soul.
