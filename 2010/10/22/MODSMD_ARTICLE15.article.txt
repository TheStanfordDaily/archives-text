## Advice to Freshmen 
### KATHRYN KANE TAMARA RITCHEY POWERS RICHARD WHITMORE 1,642 other classmates from the Class of 1980 
Dear Class of 2014: Though we realize
that you are all amazingly talented
young adults who neither need nor
likely want advice from a bunch of people "old
enough to be your parents (and then some),"
as we now reflect on 30 years since our time at
Stanford, we couldn't resist passing along
some observations.

First off, enjoy the weather. Take a few
classes that are interesting and off the beaten
path of your major. Make the most of your
friendships while at Stanford. Work hard and
play hard. Have a passion.
Stay flexible, but follow your dreams re
lentlessly. Try to live debt-free. Listen to differ
ent points of view and try to understand the
differences and similarities to your own. Get
involved. Even if you are shy, go out and make
friends and relationships.
Breathe the Stanford air deeply. Study
overseas for at least one quarter. Fall or spring

let you travel more either before or after. Re
member that life isn't a sprint, it's a marathon.
Enjoy it as you go.
Cultivate relationships with professors. Be
open to people who don't seem to be "your
type." Learn like a sponge. Try to be humble.
Marry the right person.
Audit as many courses as you can. Be opti
mistic. Envision your dream and go for it. Show
up every day.Tell the truth and keep your word.

Make sure to volunteer somewhere. Find
your passion. Develop your creativity. Take
risks, both academically and socially. Believe
you can change the world.
Spend less time with your phone and com
puter and more time experiencing life firsthand.
Learn something new each day. Don't be in a
rush to grow up. Look at this time as an oppor
tunity to decide who you are, what you believe
and what you want to contribute to the world.
The decisions you make are not irrevocable.

Follow your passion. Be kind. Make more
time for people, conversations with professors,
and exploring the beauty of the area. Make
sure each day has a goal. Make sure each day is
shared with others.

Enjoy the full college experience. Go to Asia
or Africa; Europe is too comfortable. After you
graduate, keep in contact with at least five close
friends. Get a job. Plan to work hard.
Set yourself all kinds of goals spiritual,
physical, educational, fun, family, career, etc. Go
to the City. Study some economics and finance.
Have a passion. Don't be afraid to change.
Stretch yourself. Take advantage of every
opportunity.

Remember that in 30 years, your advice to
the Class of 2048 will be looked at with skepti
cism, perhaps even more than the skepticism
you greet our advice with!
Enjoy it all, and good luck!
