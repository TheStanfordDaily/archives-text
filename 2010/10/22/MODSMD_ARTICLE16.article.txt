Can Stanford discuss academia,
class and race?

Dear Editor,
On Thursday, Oct. 7, the Daily editorial
board ran an article about the remarks of Vic
tor Davis Hanson, a research fellow at the
Hoover Institution. Hanson was essentially
bashing the trend towards cultural studies at
American universities, mocking the narratives
of oppression put forth by students of color. Ig
noring the ignorance in Hanson's comments
for a moment, let us investigate what he was
getting at by suggesting that Latin Americans
"add an accent and a trill" to take on a Chicano
identity or that the children of an "Asian op
tometrist" seek victim status. He is (perhaps in
advertently) dealing with the substitution of
race for class. This subtext is important.
In our various pursuits of social justice,
armed with the multi-culti mantra of anti-dis
crimination (race, sex, gender, sexual orienta
tion and so on), do we forget "class"? Perhaps
this deliberate blindness is a result of our

(with "our" referring to Stanford academe as
a whole) awareness of our current situation

that we are indeed in a bastion of material
privilege by virtue of attending a private uni
versity, that despite our diverse individual so
cioeconomic backgrounds, we've "made it" to
a certain position by virtue of being at Stan
ford, that maybe we're not quite equipped to
deconstruct class politics to the same extent
or with the same fervor as we take on other
categories of oppression. Or is it simply that
socioeconomic status is too real, too ground
ed in materiality for us to deal with? Obvious
ly, we cannot isolate class oppression, but that
is not a reason to subsume it. Is there a reason
we have all manner of cultural studies and
feminist studies departments, but none focus
ing specifically (I didn't say exclusively) on
class?
If we turn back to Thursday's Daily, we see
another example of class erasure. Just south
east of the editorial, we encounter Shane Sav
itsky's piece on his difficulties of declaring a
major in political science, or the humanities
more generally. He posits that the humanities

are ideal for him because "as a white person, if
you're not majoring in something semi-relat
ed to the humanities, then you're making
things too hard on yourself." Now I'm curious.
Why are white people in techie fields working
too hard? Because, as Savitsky admits, engi
neering and the sciences aren't a bad bet if one
wants to earn a steady income (or even better,
found Google). So what Savitsky means to say
is that rich people don't need to put in so much
effort as to major in the techie fields (I know
the humanities majors are not "easy" I'm
just following Savitsky's logic). So let's substi
tute the word "rich" in this article: "As a rich
person, if you're not majoring in something
semi-related to the humanities, then you're
making things too hard on yourself." Ouch.
That sentence has gone from pseudo-hipster
to pretty offensive with that simple switch.
And I wonder if The Daily or Stanford as a
whole is equipped to really have the conversa
tion on academia, class and race.
