## Men look to stay in playoff race 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The men's soccer team currently
sits third in the Pac-10 standings be
hind co-leaders UCLA and Cal,but
a southern California road trip this
weekend gives Stanford a chance to
continue its climb towards the post
season.

Tonight, the Cardinal (7-6-0,3-2-
0 Pac-10) squares off against No. 11
UCLA (9-3-1,4-1-0) in a rematch of
last Friday's thrilling 2-1 victory on
the Farm. Then on Sunday after
noon, the squad will have to deal
with a tough San Diego State squad
that has been ranked in the top 25
this year, but has started off Pac-10
play with a disappointing record of
1-4.

UCLA has yet to lose at home
this season, going a perfect 6-0 thus
far and outscoring its opponents 13-
4 in Westwood. Further adding to
the challenge is Stanford's histori
cal difficulty playing at UCLA. In

the 43 years that both schools have
kept full records, Stanford has
never defeated the Bruins on the
road.
In order to get a positive result,
