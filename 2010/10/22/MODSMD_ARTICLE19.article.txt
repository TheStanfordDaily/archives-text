## Men look to stay in playoff race 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The men's soccer team currently
sits third in the Pac-10 standings be
hind co-leaders UCLA and Cal,but
a southern California road trip this
weekend gives Stanford a chance to
continue its climb towards the post
season.

Tonight, the Cardinal (7-6-0,3-2-
0 Pac-10) squares off against No. 11
UCLA (9-3-1,4-1-0) in a rematch of
last Friday's thrilling 2-1 victory on
the Farm. Then on Sunday after
noon, the squad will have to deal
with a tough San Diego State squad
that has been ranked in the top 25
this year, but has started off Pac-10
play with a disappointing record of
1-4.

UCLA has yet to lose at home
this season, going a perfect 6-0 thus
far and outscoring its opponents 13-
4 in Westwood. Further adding to
the challenge is Stanford's histori
cal difficulty playing at UCLA. In

the 43 years that both schools have
kept full records, Stanford has
never defeated the Bruins on the
road.
In order to get a positive result,

GAME NOTES: No. 11 UCLA is undefeated at
home this season. Stanford has never defeat
ed UCLA in Los Angeles in the 43 years the
teams have squared off. The Cardinal current
ly ranks third in the Pac-10 after beating both
UCLA and San Diego State last weekend.

The Stanford men's soccer team heads to Southern California this weekend to square off with UCLA and San Diego
State. Goalkeeper Galen Perkins, above, has filled in well for injured keeper Jason Dodson.

the team will need to really stick to
the game plan and forget about the
past, according to head coach Bret
Simon.
"The most important thing is to
forget about last week's win, forget
about the other results, and get
ready to give everything for this
one game," he said. "It is a big
game, but their field is the same size
as ours, we've played games at 7:00
before, and we will do it again.
From the outside this game is no
different."
The players have reiterated that
stance all week long.
Senior defender and captain
Bobby Warshaw said that each
match is a battle of its own.
"It's all kind of the same game
plan for us no matter who we're
playing. It comes down to how we
are going to execute," he said.

Stanford's execution has been
improving from its initial four
game losing streak that saw the
Cardinal fall from the national
rankings. The scoring load has been
shouldered mainly by senior for
ward Dominique Yahyavi, with five
goals, and Warshaw, with four. That
said, six players have combined for
Stanford's 16 total goals.

In the back, Simon has settled on
a defensive quartet of veteran play
ers seniors Cameron Lamming,
Warshaw and Ryan Thomas, and
junior Tommy Ryan. Redshirt fresh
man Galen Perkins has stepped up
to replace injured goalie Jason Dod
son, and together the unit has only
allowed seven goals since starting off
0-4 and just one goal in the past three
games.

The defense will be hard
pressed to stop UCLA again, espe
cially given the red-hot play of
freshman Kelyn Rowe. The mid
fielder scored the lone goal in Fri
day's loss, and added to his impres
sive young career with a golden
goal in the Bruins' upset win over
Cal on Sunday. Rowe leads UCLA

with six goals and five assists, and
his point total ranks second in the
Pac-10.

Perkins is eager for the chal
lenge against a good team with a lot
on the line.

"With them being at home,
under the lights, they're going to
come out with a ton of energy," he
said. "They came into our game ex
pecting to beat us, so I'm sure losing
was a sore subject. The main thing
will be who brings the most energy.
I wouldn't expect too many
changes tactically, so I think it
should be a really tight game."
The rematch Sunday against San
Diego State will feature the offen
sive talents of Aztec Raymundo
Reza against Stanford's backline.
Reza was frustrated last game by
the Cardinal defense the senior
managed only three shots and
played just 51 minutes.
The Aztecs are expected to
come out firing in hopes of revers
ing their cold spell.
Just five regular season games
remain, and at 7-6-1, an NCAA
Tournament berth is still within
Stanford's reach. Unfortunately,
the schedule is not exactly favor
able from here on out.

After the road trip through
southern California, the Cardinal
comes home to face Washington
and Oregon State before finishing
on the road at No. 12 Cal.
Warshaw and the rest of the team
don't have any interest in looking
ahead. "The only thing that mat
ters is that UCLA will be a tough
place to play this weekend, and we
have to keep getting better at prac
tice," Warshaw said. "It's the same
old answer as every week, but it
makes me proud to say that we
don't talk about winning out, Pac
-10 titles or the NCAA Tournament.
In the locker room we're talking
about how we're going to work
hard at 7:45 tomorrow morning at
practice."

Kickoff from Drake Stadium is
tonight at 7 p.m., and the Card will
face the Aztecs on Sunday at 1 p.m.

one game," he said. "It is a big
game, but their field is the same size
as ours, we've played games at 7:00
before, and we will do it again.
From the outside this game is no
different."
The players have reiterated that
stance all week long.
Senior defender and captain
Bobby Warshaw said that each
match is a battle of its own.
"It's all kind of the same game
plan for us no matter who we're
playing. It comes down to how we
are going to execute," he said.

Stanford's execution has been
improving from its initial four
game losing streak that saw the
Cardinal fall from the national
rankings. The scoring load has been
shouldered mainly by senior for
ward Dominique Yahyavi, with five
goals, and Warshaw, with four. That
said, six players have combined for
Stanford's 16 total goals.

In the back, Simon has settled on
a defensive quartet of veteran play
ers seniors Cameron Lamming,
Warshaw and Ryan Thomas, and
junior Tommy Ryan. Redshirt fresh
man Galen Perkins has stepped up
to replace injured goalie Jason Dod
son, and together the unit has only
allowed seven goals since starting off
0-4 and just one goal in the past three
games.

The defense will be hard
pressed to stop UCLA again, espe
cially given the red-hot play of
freshman Kelyn Rowe. The mid
fielder scored the lone goal in Fri
day's loss, and added to his impres
sive young career with a golden
goal in the Bruins' upset win over
Cal on Sunday. Rowe leads UCLA

with six goals and five assists, and
his point total ranks second in the
Pac-10.

Perkins is eager for the chal
lenge against a good team with a lot
on the line.

"With them being at home,
under the lights, they're going to
come out with a ton of energy," he
said. "They came into our game ex
pecting to beat us, so I'm sure losing
was a sore subject. The main thing
will be who brings the most energy.
I wouldn't expect too many
changes tactically, so I think it
should be a really tight game."
The rematch Sunday against San
Diego State will feature the offen
sive talents of Aztec Raymundo
Reza against Stanford's backline.
Reza was frustrated last game by
the Cardinal defense the senior
managed only three shots and
played just 51 minutes.
The Aztecs are expected to
come out firing in hopes of revers
ing their cold spell.
Just five regular season games
remain, and at 7-6-1, an NCAA
Tournament berth is still within
Stanford's reach. Unfortunately,
the schedule is not exactly favor
able from here on out.

After the road trip through
southern California, the Cardinal
comes home to face Washington
and Oregon State before finishing
on the road at No. 12 Cal.
Warshaw and the rest of the team
don't have any interest in looking
ahead. "The only thing that mat
ters is that UCLA will be a tough
place to play this weekend, and we
have to keep getting better at prac
tice," Warshaw said. "It's the same
old answer as every week, but it
makes me proud to say that we
don't talk about winning out, Pac
-10 titles or the NCAA Tournament.
In the locker room we're talking
about how we're going to work
hard at 7:45 tomorrow morning at
practice."

Kickoff from Drake Stadium is
tonight at 7 p.m., and the Card will
face the Aztecs on Sunday at 1 p.m.
