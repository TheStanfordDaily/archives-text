# PAC-10 POWERS
## COLLIDE Stanford hosts Cal in the 71st Big Spike 
### CAROLINE CASELLI DESK EDITOR 
The No. 2 Stanford women's volleyball team
will take on No. 5 California at home tonight in
the 71st Big Spike. Although meetings with rival
Cal (17-1,7-1 Pac-10) are always much anticipat
ed, this weekend's battle of the Bay Area teams
has an added element of significance, with both
teams currently ranked in the nation's top five
and hoping to emerge as the sole leader of the
Pac-10.

The Card (16-1, 7-1), coming off a pair of
dominant victories last weekend against the
Washington schools, hopes to carry its momen
tum forward into what could be its toughest chal
lenge of the season yet.
"With the Pac-10 being as crazy as it is, with
everyone winning and losing big games, we can
never get comfortable," said sophomore defen
sive specialist Hannah Benjamin. "We know that
every game matters, no matter who the oppo
nent, so we make sure to never allow ourselves to
let up.
"Also, Cal has the same record as us and has
been playing really well," she continued. "We are
very pumped up for this match because it is one
step closer to our long-term goal of being the
best team in the country at the end [of the sea
son]."

The Cal women's volleyball team is off to one
of its best starts in program history. Until falling
at No. 8 USC in a 17-15 fifth set decision on Oct.
9 coincidentally, the same day that Stanford
suffered its only loss of the season across town to
No. 11 UCLA the Bears were 15-0, marking
the second-longest winning streak in the school's
history.

The talented duo of senior setter Carli Lloyd
and junior outside hitter Tarah Murrey has been
instrumental to Cal's success thus far. Both play
ers posted double-doubles against No. 7 Wash
ington last week Lloyd with 33 assists and 13
digs, and Murrey with 19 kills and 14 digs a
testament to their offensive and defensive
prowess.

Lloyd, just two assists shy of 5,000 for her ca
reer, ranks ninth in the Pac-10 record books for
all-time career assists. This season, she is fourth
among the conference's assist leaders, dishing an
average of 11.42 per set. Lloyd is also one of 10 fi
nalists for the prestigious LoAwe's Senior
CLASS award, along with Stanford outside hitter

NOTES ! The winner of this weekend's match will gain sole
possession of first place in the Pac-10. No. 2 Stanford's
Alix Klineman ranks second in the nation in kills per set and
points per set. No. 5 Cal leads the conference in blocking
at just over three per set.

Alix Klineman and Washington setter Jenna Hag
glund from the Pac-10.

Murrey's powerful hitting has put her, like
Klineman, among the nation's premier attackers.
She currently ranks fifth nationally in kills per set
(5.21) and points per set (5.84); Klineman is second
in both categories with 5.76 and 6.3, respectively.
Murrey and Klineman are also the only two out
side hitters to place in the conference's top 10 hit
ting percentages Murrey has the Pac-10's sev
enth-best hitting percentage (.361), while Kline
man is third (.397).
The Cal squad has displayed stellar blocking
abilities, leading the conference with an average
of 3.15 blocks per set. Two sophomore middle
blockers, Kat Brown and Shannon Hawari, are
one-two in the Pac-10's individual blocking sta
tistics with averages of 1.38 and 1.25 per set, re
spectively. Sophomore opposite Correy John
son, the third Bear in the conference's top 10
blockers, ranks 10th on the list with 1.04 blocks

per set.
Stanford boasts a 62-8 historical edge over Cal,
but the series was split last season with each team
winning in five sets at home. Although the Cardi
nal squad is hesitant to declare any one match
more significant than others, tonight's meeting
with the Bears comes with high stakes and a fierce
tradition of rivalry.
"We never like to consider certain games more
important than others because all of them have
equal importance in the end, but Cal has a very
strong team this year and we are currently tied
with them in the standings," Benjamin said. "Our
games versus Cal are always very emotional and
intense games, so we hope to get a lot of support
from students, families and friends."
The match will start at 7 p.m. tonight in Maples
Pavilion.
