# PAC-10 POWERS
## COLLIDE Stanford hosts Cal in the 71st Big Spike 
### CAROLINE CASELLI DESK EDITOR 
The No. 2 Stanford women's volleyball team
will take on No. 5 California at home tonight in
the 71st Big Spike. Although meetings with rival
Cal (17-1,7-1 Pac-10) are always much anticipat
ed, this weekend's battle of the Bay Area teams
has an added element of significance, with both
teams currently ranked in the nation's top five
and hoping to emerge as the sole leader of the
Pac-10.

The Card (16-1, 7-1), coming off a pair of
dominant victories last weekend against the
Washington schools, hopes to carry its momen
tum forward into what could be its toughest chal
lenge of the season yet.
"With the Pac-10 being as crazy as it is, with
everyone winning and losing big games, we can
never get comfortable," said sophomore defen
sive specialist Hannah Benjamin. "We know that
every game matters, no matter who the oppo
nent, so we make sure to never allow ourselves to
let up.
"Also, Cal has the same record as us and has
been playing really well," she continued. "We are
very pumped up for this match because it is one
step closer to our long-term goal of being the
best team in the country at the end [of the sea
son]."

The Cal women's volleyball team is off to one
of its best starts in program history. Until falling
at No. 8 USC in a 17-15 fifth set decision on Oct.
9 coincidentally, the same day that Stanford
suffered its only loss of the season across town to
No. 11 UCLA the Bears were 15-0, marking
the second-longest winning streak in the school's
history.

The talented duo of senior setter Carli Lloyd
and junior outside hitter Tarah Murrey has been
instrumental to Cal's success thus far. Both play
ers posted double-doubles against No. 7 Wash
ington last week Lloyd with 33 assists and 13
digs, and Murrey with 19 kills and 14 digs a
testament to their offensive and defensive
prowess.

Lloyd, just two assists shy of 5,000 for her ca
reer, ranks ninth in the Pac-10 record books for
all-time career assists. This season, she is fourth
among the conference's assist leaders, dishing an
average of 11.42 per set. Lloyd is also one of 10 fi
nalists for the prestigious LoAwe's Senior
CLASS award, along with Stanford outside hitter
