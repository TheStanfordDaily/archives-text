# MEN'S WATER POLO
## Stanford revists SoCal in matchup with Pepperdine 
### DASH DAVIDSON 
After a long trip down to southern
California last weekend in which the
Stanford men's water polo team split
games against UCLA and UC-Santa
Barbara, the No. 4 Cardinal (8-5, 2-1
MPSF) has another busy weekend to pre

On Saturday, in honor of Homecom

water polo team hosts the Alumni Game
at Avery Aquatic Center. The team then

No. 10 Pepperdine (8-10,0-3).

play, are UC-Irvine and California, both
with 2-0 records. Pepperdine is currently
in last place in the conference, with a
record of 0-3.

the modest totals of their top three goal
scorers: Danny White, James Perry and
Spencer Hamby, who have scored 23,18
and 17 goals, respectively. In the net, the
Waves employ a goalie platoon featuring
