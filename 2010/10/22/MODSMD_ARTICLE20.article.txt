# MEN'S WATER POLO
## Stanford revists SoCal in matchup with Pepperdine 
### DASH DAVIDSON 
After a long trip down to southern
California last weekend in which the
Stanford men's water polo team split
games against UCLA and UC-Santa
Barbara, the No. 4 Cardinal (8-5, 2-1
MPSF) has another busy weekend to pre
pare for.
On Saturday, in honor of Homecom
ing weekend for Stanford alumni, the
water polo team hosts the Alumni Game
at Avery Aquatic Center. The team then
heads back to work with yet another trip
to southern California and another road
game against a tough opponent, this time
No. 10 Pepperdine (8-10,0-3).
Stanford is looking to gain ground in
the tight Mountain Pacific Sports Feder
ation (MPSF) standings, where it cur
rently stands at No. 3. Ahead of the Car
dinal, which holds a 2-1 record in league

play, are UC-Irvine and California, both
with 2-0 records. Pepperdine is currently
in last place in the conference, with a
record of 0-3.
The Waves are in the midst of a severe
cold streak, having dropped nine of their
past 13 games heading into Sunday's
matchup with Stanford. In their most re
cent outings, the Waves defeated UC-
Davis, 7-5, in a non-conference game, be
fore losing to Pacific by the same score to
run their conference record to its current
state.

The Waves have been a low-scoring
team this year, and this fact is reflected in
the modest totals of their top three goal
scorers: Danny White, James Perry and
Spencer Hamby, who have scored 23,18
and 17 goals, respectively. In the net, the
Waves employ a goalie platoon featuring
Bence Valics and Bryce McLain,
who together have accumulated 127
saves.

The Waves' victory over UC-
Davis this past Saturday was filled
with drama, as top goal-scorer
Danny White netted a shot with one
second left in regulation to send the
game into overtime. In the extra pe

riod, the Waves ended up prevailing.
7-5.

Stanford will look to continue
the gritty play that has resulted in
five of its past six games being de
cided by two goals or less. In those
five tight affairs, Stanford has man
aged to go 3-2, including its win
against previously undefeated USC.
On offense, the Cardinal has been
led of late by the resurgence of sen
ior team captain Sage Wright, who
has successfully battled back this
season from the ACL injury that
kept him out of the action all of last

year. He came up huge last week
end, scoring twice in both contests.

The Stanford attack has been re
markably consistent all year, using
the contributions of many different
players, both veterans on the squad
and newer faces, all adding up to the
fourth-highest scoring average in
the MPSF, at 11.23 goals per game.

On defense the Cardinal has re
mained stingy, holding four of its
past five opponents under the 10-
goal barrier. Senior goalie Brian
Pingree has continued to excel in
the net, backing up his recent MPSF

player of the week honor with con
sistently stellar play. He is third in
the conference in saves-per-game
average with a mark of 7.23.

This weekend will mark the
fourth and final Stanford trip down
the coast for games in southern Cal
ifornia. The Cardinal has fared well
in its final region, to the tune of a 5-
3 mark.

Stanford takes on Pepperdine in
Malibu, Calif., this Sunday at noon.

The No. 4 Stanford men's water polo team has relied on a scoring committee to produce its 11.23 goals per game. The strength of the Cardinal lies in its
defense, which, led by senior goalkeeper Brian Pingree, has held four of its past five opponents under 10 goals. Pingree is averaging 7.23 saves per game.
