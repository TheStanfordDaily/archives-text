# Card football has come a long way
## 
### Jacob Jaffe 
Three years ago this month,
Stanford football defeated
USC,24-23, in one of the most
shocking outcomes in sports
history. The Cardinal came
into the Coliseum as a six-touchdown
underdog and left as a program reborn,
having just completed the Biggest Upset
Ever.
Just 39 games later, Stanford is now a
five-touchdown favorite against Wash
ington State. For those of you who are
unfamiliar with point-spreads and Vegas
odds, these are huge numbers. USC's 41-
point (depending on who you ask, 40.5-
to 41.5-) spread over Stanford in 2007
was one of the biggest spreads ever,
meaning it was expected to be one of the
most lopsided contests of the decade and
certainly of the year. This week, the Car
dinal's 34.5-point margin in Vegas is the
biggest point-spread in the country.
Let that sit for a moment. In less time
than it takes Brett Favre to retire, Stan
ford went from being one of the biggest
patsies in the nation to one of the "big
boys." For a team that won one game all
year in 2006, a team that had just broken
a nine-game home losing streak, a team
that hadn't even finished .500 since 2001,
the thought that just a few years would
separate the Cardinal from being a five
touchdown favorite would have been lu
dicrous in 2007.

Three years ago, Stanford fans were
celebrating their long-awaited first victo
ry at the new Stanford Stadium, even if it
was against San Jose State. Now the Car
dinal faithful are busy discussing possible
BCS bowl scenarios and weighing the
team's strength of schedule for the com
puters.
So, Stanford supporters, on the eve of
an expected gimme, before you worry
about how this game will affect the Car
dinal's spot in the polls, have some per
spective. Only 159 weeks ago, you were
probably waking up ready to cringe at
yet another impending beatdown. This
morning, no one unrelated to a Washing
ton State football player or coach can
reasonably expect the Cougars to beat
Stanford.
The turnaround engineered by head
coach Jim Harbaugh and these classes of
players has been truly remarkable. Be
fore last year, the Cardinal had failed to
qualify for a bo wl game for seven straight
seasons. Stanford had had only one
major individual award winner (Troy
Walters won the Biletnikoff Award in
1999) since Elway.
After just six games this year, a bowl
is seen as inevitable, and the entire year
has been about fighting for Pac-10 su
premacy. Stanford writers and fans, in
cluding yours truly, still bemoan Heis
man voters passing over Toby Gerhart
by a razor-thin margin last year, even
though Gerhart still won the incredibly
prestigious Doak Walker Award as the
nation's best running back. And many
fans follow Andrew Luck's Heisman
campaign religiously, obsessing over his
stats each week, regardless of the game's
outcome.

All this is not to say that Stanford
should be happy to get here and no fur
ther, or that this is the peak for this Car
dinal team. Plenty of achievements (win
ning a bowl game, going to the Rose
Bowl, national title contention, etc.) re
main ahead for the program. But it's
worth a look back to remember where
this team was.

After all, this isn't tennis, swimming
or women's volleyball. Stanford isn't a
perennial No. 1 team looking to add yet
another title to its trophy case. This is
football, where the Cardinal has won just
two bowl games in the last 32 years.
It's easy to get caught up in Stan

The Cardinal's
34.5-point margin
in Vegas is the
biggest point
spread in the
country.
