## Profs urged to focus on athletics COIA delegate reports to Faculty Senate 
### DEVIN BANERJEE SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Thursday's meeting of the Faculty
Senate featured a report by Stan
ford's delegate to the Coalition on
Intercollegiate Athletics (COIA),
philosophy professor Tom Wasow, on
the activities of the eight-year-old or
ganization.

The purpose of the "grassroots"
group of representatives from Divi
sion 1A schools is to "provide a fac
ulty voice on issues related to athlet
ics," said Wasow, who was appointed
by Provost John Etchemendy Ph.D.
'B2 to be Stanford's delegate when
the University joined during the
2003-04 academic year. Wasow is not

a member of the Senate.
During his presentation, Wasow
said Etchemendy was initially skep
tical of Stanford's need to join
COIA, as student athletes face rela
tively few academic challenges at
Stanford compared to those at other
colleges and universities. But
Wasow's intent was for Stanford to
be a "role model" in the coalition.
"Stanford has great athletics
teams without sacrificing academic
values," Wasow told the Senate on
Thursday. "There are no special ad
mits, no special dorms for athletes, no
canceling of classes for football
games."
(Philosophy professor Ken Taylor
interjected: "We can't even cancel a
Faculty Senate meeting for a Giants
game.")
While Wasow claimed athletes do
not receive special consideration in
admission, the Faculty Senate ac-

knowledged at its last meeting that
the admission office may, under its
current policies, give special consid
eration to "those with highly devel
oped specific talents."
Athletics Director Bob Bowlsby,
who also was in attendance Thurs
day, chimed in to say the breakdown
of academic majors among athletes
is no different from that among the
undergraduate population.
But both Wasow and Bowlsby ac
knowledged that student athletes at
Stanford face academic challenges.
Bowlsby said science courses with
afternoon laboratory sections fre
quently conflict with practices and
training. He also said athletes have
constant access to four academic ad
visers from the Office of the Vice
Provost for Undergraduate Educa
tion.

For Wasow, Stanford faculty does
not show enough interest in ensuring

that Stanford remains the model for
athletic programs in the country.
"There is still very little faculty over
sight of athletics," he said. "I encour
age the Senate to take more interest
in athletics and to remain the model
that we are."

Bowlsby took a question from
electrical engineering professor
Olav Solgaard about how often ath
letes are tested for drugs and by
whom. Bowlsby said Stanford "does
not do any institutional-based drug
testing, but the NCAA runs a year
round drug testing program. They
test for both performance-enhancing
drugs and so-called recreational
drugs."

The meeting adjourned early for
an off-the-record executive session
on University accreditation.
