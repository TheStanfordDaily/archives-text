## SCENES FROM PARTY ON THE EDGE 
### â€”nairi STRAUCH contact nairi: nstrauch@stanford. edu 
Last Thursday's "Party on the
Edge" was exciting and classy
a definite highlight of the
quarter thus far. A good change
from the average sticky and sweaty
frat party, the annual festivities
held in the beautiful Cantor Arts
Center offered a new way to be
entertained, socialize and, of

course, get dressed up.
The jugglers and musicians
who welcomed attendees waiting
outside were just hints of what
entertainment waited indoors.
The night's line-up of acts was
tight; every 10 minutes a new stu
dent group would perform in one
of three locations. Walking

through the galleries, it was easy
to hear the sounds of a cappella in
a nearby gallery or get a good
view of a dance performance from
the balcony.
Groups such as Alliance
Streetdance and Stanford

Swingtime were instant crowd
pleasers, and their music set an
energetic mood outside on the
lawn.

Singing groups, including
Mixed Company, performed in the
Rodin Rotunda a circular room
with Rodin's smaller sculptures and
good acoustics.
