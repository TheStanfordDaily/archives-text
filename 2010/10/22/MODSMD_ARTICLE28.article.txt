## SCENES FROM PARTY ON THE EDGE 
### â€”nairi STRAUCH contact nairi: nstrauch@stanford. edu 
Last Thursday's "Party on the
Edge" was exciting and classy
a definite highlight of the
quarter thus far. A good change
from the average sticky and sweaty
frat party, the annual festivities
held in the beautiful Cantor Arts
Center offered a new way to be
entertained, socialize and, of

course, get dressed up.
The jugglers and musicians
who welcomed attendees waiting
outside were just hints of what
entertainment waited indoors.
The night's line-up of acts was
tight; every 10 minutes a new stu
dent group would perform in one
of three locations. Walking

through the galleries, it was easy
to hear the sounds of a cappella in
a nearby gallery or get a good
view of a dance performance from
the balcony.
Groups such as Alliance
Streetdance and Stanford

Swingtime were instant crowd
pleasers, and their music set an
energetic mood outside on the
lawn.

Singing groups, including
Mixed Company, performed in the
Rodin Rotunda a circular room
with Rodin's smaller sculptures and
good acoustics.

Students enjoy the annual tradition "Party on the Edge" at Cantor Arts Museum last Thursday night.
"Singing inside Cantor was exciting
and different, especially early on in the
year as we're trying to figure out our
group's sound," said Mixed Company's
Jessica Asperger 'l3. "The acoustics were
great, and the audience was supportive
and energetic. I think the group had a
wonderful time singing for their friends
and various Rodin statues."
Other solo performers could be found
around the museum in quieter galleries.
The party also encouraged apprecia
tion for visual art with an exciting gallery
show on Mami Wata (mother water), an
African mythological spirit of a mermaid
snake charmer, portrayed in vibrant mixed
media art including sculptures and masks.
The bright teal color of gallery walls
accentuated the water imagery in the
pieces, and made the exhibit very attrac
tive overall. "Mami Wata: Arts for Water
Spirits in Africa and Its Diasporas" contin
ues through Jan. 2, 2011.
The main focus of the night, however,
was the Student Arts Grant Program. Each
grant recipient displayed his or her work
with an explanation of their project and
intentions as artists, using paintings, pho
tography, film or mixed media art to con
vey a message. The pieces were diverse
a highlight being an interactive "Hit the
Lights" piece by Charity Fluharty 'lO. Most
of the artists studied visual art extracurric
ularly many were biology majors, in
fact.
Another crucial factor helped make
the event a success the refreshments.
The free food was an immediate attraction
for most people, making the lawn a popu
lar and social location.
Analogous to a classy garden party,
Cantor filled its tables with bite-size chick
en and cranberry sandwiches, an assort
ment of chips, fruit and warm churros for
dessert. To top it off, there was an endless
supply of Hot Tamales candies that could
be found on tables throughout the build
ing.
Though mainly intended for student's
enjoyment and appreciation of the arts,
the event seemed to benefit the museum
as well tables with student membership
forms were packed. It seemed that every
one, especially those for whom this was
their first "Party on the Edge," wanted to
get involved in more such activities.
"Party on the Edge" was enjoyable for
the whole three hours, yet its open house
feel made it easy to come and go as one
pleased. What a pleasant experience it was
to walk through a vibrant exhibit with
friends, live music in the background,
churros in hand.
