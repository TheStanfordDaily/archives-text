## CARD SEEKS BOWL ELIGIBILITY 
### JACOB JAFFE DEPUTY EDITOR 
After seven straight seasons below .500, the No. 12
Stanford football team looks to become bowl eligible for
the second consecutive year when it takes on Washing
ton State on Saturday.

The Cardinal (5-1, 2-1 Pac-10) is coming off a bye
week, which followed a thrilling last-second win over
USC on Oct. 9. Meanwhile, the Cougars (1-6,0-4) have
lost 21 of their past 22 conference games, and their lone
win on the season was a one-point comeback victory
over FCS foe Montana State.

In the first BCS standings of the year, which were re
leased on Sunday, Stanford was ranked No. 12, as the
Harris Poll put the Cardinal at No. 13, the USA Today
Coaches' Poll at No. 14 and the computers at No. 10.
While playing Washington State will not help Stanford's
strength of schedule, a big victory could help move the

Cardinal up in the polls. A win on Saturday would also
give Stanford its best start since 1970.
Like most Pac-10 teams, Stanford has had little trou
ble with Washington State the past few seasons. Last
year, the Cardinal opened its season with a 39-13 victory
over the Cougars in Pullman, Wash., and two years ago
Stanford routed Washington State 58-0.
The Cougars have struggled in recent seasons, partic
ularly on the road. Washington State has not won a game
outside the state of Washington since 2006, a string of 20
consecutive defeats. The past few games have been en
couraging, though, as the Cougars have held tough
against quality teams. Washington State's last two games
were both against top-20 teams, Oregon and Arizona,
and it lost both respectably, 43-23 and 24-7. This is in
stark contrast to the last two years, when the Cougars
lost by combined scores of 122-42 and 100-13 to the same
two teams, even though both the Ducks and Wildcats are
having better seasons this year.
Despite their improvements, though, the Cougars are
still among the worst teams in the nation in several sta
tistical categories. Out of 120 FBS teams, Washington
State is 103 rd in scoring offense, managing fewer than 20
points per game, and 116 th in rushing offense. This pales
in comparison to the Cougar defense, though, which is
dead last in yards allowed, second-worst in rushing yards
allowed and third-worst in points allowed.
That defense will surely be tested against Stanford's
offense, one of the most potent units in the country. The
Cardinal ranks fifth in scoring offense, averaging over 40
points per game. Perhaps even more impressive, and
tough to defend, is Stanford's ability to spread the
wealth. Just six games into the season, 17 Cardinal play
ers have scored a touchdown the most in the nation.
To put this in perspective, Washington State as a team
has only scored 18 touchdowns on the year, and the
Cougars have played one more game than Stanford has.
Leading the Stanford offense is redshirt sophomore
quarterback Andrew Luck, who has been in Heisman
Trophy discussion all year long. Luck has lived up to his

NOTES: No. 12 Stanford will become bowl eligible with its next victory.
The Cardinal enters this weekend's game against Washington State as
35-point favorites, the largest spread of any college football game this
weekend. Washington State QB Jeff Tuel has thrown for at least 200
yards in every game this season.
