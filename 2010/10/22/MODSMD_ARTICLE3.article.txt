## CARD SEEKS BOWL ELIGIBILITY 
### JACOB JAFFE DEPUTY EDITOR 
After seven straight seasons below .500, the No. 12
Stanford football team looks to become bowl eligible for
the second consecutive year when it takes on Washing
ton State on Saturday.

The Cardinal (5-1, 2-1 Pac-10) is coming off a bye
week, which followed a thrilling last-second win over
USC on Oct. 9. Meanwhile, the Cougars (1-6,0-4) have
lost 21 of their past 22 conference games, and their lone
win on the season was a one-point comeback victory
over FCS foe Montana State.

In the first BCS standings of the year, which were re
leased on Sunday, Stanford was ranked No. 12, as the
Harris Poll put the Cardinal at No. 13, the USA Today
Coaches' Poll at No. 14 and the computers at No. 10.
While playing Washington State will not help Stanford's
strength of schedule, a big victory could help move the

Cardinal up in the polls. A win on Saturday would also
give Stanford its best start since 1970.
Like most Pac-10 teams, Stanford has had little trou
ble with Washington State the past few seasons. Last
year, the Cardinal opened its season with a 39-13 victory
over the Cougars in Pullman, Wash., and two years ago
Stanford routed Washington State 58-0.
The Cougars have struggled in recent seasons, partic
ularly on the road. Washington State has not won a game
outside the state of Washington since 2006, a string of 20
consecutive defeats. The past few games have been en
couraging, though, as the Cougars have held tough
against quality teams. Washington State's last two games
were both against top-20 teams, Oregon and Arizona,
and it lost both respectably, 43-23 and 24-7. This is in
stark contrast to the last two years, when the Cougars
lost by combined scores of 122-42 and 100-13 to the same
two teams, even though both the Ducks and Wildcats are
having better seasons this year.
Despite their improvements, though, the Cougars are
still among the worst teams in the nation in several sta
tistical categories. Out of 120 FBS teams, Washington
State is 103 rd in scoring offense, managing fewer than 20
points per game, and 116 th in rushing offense. This pales
in comparison to the Cougar defense, though, which is
dead last in yards allowed, second-worst in rushing yards
allowed and third-worst in points allowed.
That defense will surely be tested against Stanford's
offense, one of the most potent units in the country. The
Cardinal ranks fifth in scoring offense, averaging over 40
points per game. Perhaps even more impressive, and
tough to defend, is Stanford's ability to spread the
wealth. Just six games into the season, 17 Cardinal play
ers have scored a touchdown the most in the nation.
To put this in perspective, Washington State as a team
has only scored 18 touchdowns on the year, and the
Cougars have played one more game than Stanford has.
Leading the Stanford offense is redshirt sophomore
quarterback Andrew Luck, who has been in Heisman
Trophy discussion all year long. Luck has lived up to his

35-point favorites, the largest spread of any college football game this
weekend. Washington State QB Jeff Tuel has thrown for at least 200
yards in every game this season.


billing, ranking ninth in the country in
passing efficiency while leading the Pac
-10 in total offense. The Cardinal running
game has not particularly slowed down
this season, even without Heisman run
ner-up Toby Gerhart. Stanford averages
210 yards per game (the same as its aver
age at this time last year) and over five
yards per carry, led by sophomore running
back Stepfan Taylor. Taylor is averaging
about 80 yards per contest on the ground,
but since he was given the role as lead
back against Notre Dame three games ago
he has eclipsed 110 yards in each game.
The more interesting battle in this game
will likely be the matchup of Stanford's de
fense and Washington State's offense. De
spite their struggles, the Cougars are only
two spots below Stanford in passing yards
per game, due in large part to the strong
play of sophomore quarterback Jeff Tuel.
Tuel has passed for over 200 yards in every
game this year something Luck has not
done even though the talent around
him is significantly worse than most of the
defenses he has faced. Tuel's favorite tar
get has been freshman wide receiver Mar
quess Wilson, who is 14th in the country
and second in the Pac-10 with 92 receiving
yards per game.

Meanwhile, Stanford's defense, which
was a surprise bright spot in the first four
games, has regressed the past few weeks.
After ranking 11th in total defense and
12th in scoring defense through four
games, the Cardinal defense was shredded
by the two best offenses (statistically) that
it will face all year. Stanford's defense sur
rendered 626 yards, including 388 rushing,
in a loss to No. 2 Oregon. The next week,
the Cardinal struggled against USC's aer
ial assault, allowing Trojan quarterback
Matt Barkley to throw for 390 yards, in
cluding 224 to freshman wide receiver
Robert Woods. The combined 87 points
and 1124 yards allowed in those two
games dropped Stanford to 56th in total
defense and 58th in scoring defense.

New Stanford defensive coordinator
Vic Fangio implemented a hybrid 3-4 de
fense starting this year, and that unit will
likely have to regroup and revert to its
early form if Stanford is going to contend
for a possible BCS bowl. The Cardinal is

still alive in the conference race, and Stan
ford could also go to the Rose Bowl as an
at-large team if it wins out and Oregon
meets Boise State, TCU or Utah in the
BCS National Championship Game.

Last year, Stanford came out of its bye
week by shocking then-No. 8 Oregon 51-
42. That game made the Cardinal bowl-el
igible and propelled it into the AP Top 25
for the first time in eight years. This week,
Stanford can again become bowl-eligible
by winning after its bye week.
The contest against Washington State is
also the Cardinal's annual Reunion
Homecoming Game, so Stanford alumni
from several decades are expected to be in
attendance at Stanford Stadium. The Car
dinal's last game, a 37-35 nail-biting win
over USC, set an attendance record for
the remodeled Stanford Stadium with
over 51,000 fans on hand.
The Cougars and the Cardinal will kick
off at 2 p.m. on Saturday at Stanford Sta
dium.

State is 103 rd in scoring offense, managing fewer than 20
points per game, and 116 th in rushing offense. This pales
in comparison to the Cougar defense, though, which is
dead last in yards allowed, second-worst in rushing yards
allowed and third-worst in points allowed.
That defense will surely be tested against Stanford's
offense, one of the most potent units in the country. The
Cardinal ranks fifth in scoring offense, averaging over 40
points per game. Perhaps even more impressive, and
tough to defend, is Stanford's ability to spread the
wealth. Just six games into the season, 17 Cardinal play
ers have scored a touchdown the most in the nation.
To put this in perspective, Washington State as a team
has only scored 18 touchdowns on the year, and the
Cougars have played one more game than Stanford has.
Leading the Stanford offense is redshirt sophomore
quarterback Andrew Luck, who has been in Heisman
Trophy discussion all year long. Luck has lived up to his

billing, ranking ninth in the country in
passing efficiency while leading the Pac
-10 in total offense. The Cardinal running
game has not particularly slowed down
this season, even without Heisman run
ner-up Toby Gerhart. Stanford averages
210 yards per game (the same as its aver
age at this time last year) and over five
yards per carry, led by sophomore running
back Stepfan Taylor. Taylor is averaging
about 80 yards per contest on the ground,
but since he was given the role as lead
back against Notre Dame three games ago
he has eclipsed 110 yards in each game.
The more interesting battle in this game
will likely be the matchup of Stanford's de
fense and Washington State's offense. De
spite their struggles, the Cougars are only
two spots below Stanford in passing yards
per game, due in large part to the strong
play of sophomore quarterback Jeff Tuel.
Tuel has passed for over 200 yards in every
game this year something Luck has not
done even though the talent around
him is significantly worse than most of the
defenses he has faced. Tuel's favorite tar
get has been freshman wide receiver Mar
quess Wilson, who is 14th in the country
and second in the Pac-10 with 92 receiving
yards per game.

Meanwhile, Stanford's defense, which
was a surprise bright spot in the first four
games, has regressed the past few weeks.
After ranking 11th in total defense and
12th in scoring defense through four
games, the Cardinal defense was shredded
by the two best offenses (statistically) that
it will face all year. Stanford's defense sur
rendered 626 yards, including 388 rushing,
in a loss to No. 2 Oregon. The next week,
the Cardinal struggled against USC's aer
ial assault, allowing Trojan quarterback
Matt Barkley to throw for 390 yards, in
cluding 224 to freshman wide receiver
Robert Woods. The combined 87 points
and 1124 yards allowed in those two
games dropped Stanford to 56th in total
defense and 58th in scoring defense.

New Stanford defensive coordinator
Vic Fangio implemented a hybrid 3-4 de
fense starting this year, and that unit will
likely have to regroup and revert to its
early form if Stanford is going to contend
for a possible BCS bowl. The Cardinal is

still alive in the conference race, and Stan
ford could also go to the Rose Bowl as an
at-large team if it wins out and Oregon
meets Boise State, TCU or Utah in the
BCS National Championship Game.

Last year, Stanford came out of its bye
week by shocking then-No. 8 Oregon 51-
42. That game made the Cardinal bowl-el
igible and propelled it into the AP Top 25
for the first time in eight years. This week,
Stanford can again become bowl-eligible
by winning after its bye week.
The contest against Washington State is
also the Cardinal's annual Reunion
Homecoming Game, so Stanford alumni
from several decades are expected to be in
attendance at Stanford Stadium. The Car
dinal's last game, a 37-35 nail-biting win
over USC, set an attendance record for
the remodeled Stanford Stadium with
over 51,000 fans on hand.
The Cougars and the Cardinal will kick
off at 2 p.m. on Saturday at Stanford Sta
dium.

Just six games
into the season,
17 Cardinal
players have
scored a
touchdown.
After seven straight seasons below .500, the No. 12
Stanford football team looks to become bowl eligible for
the second consecutive year when it takes on Washing
ton State on Saturday.

The Cardinal (5-1, 2-1 Pac-10) is coming off a bye
week, which followed a thrilling last-second win over
USC on Oct. 9. Meanwhile, the Cougars (1-6,0-4) have
lost 21 of their past 22 conference games, and their lone
win on the season was a one-point comeback victory
over FCS foe Montana State.

In the first BCS standings of the year, which were re
leased on Sunday, Stanford was ranked No. 12, as the
Harris Poll put the Cardinal at No. 13, the USA Today
Coaches' Poll at No. 14 and the computers at No. 10.
While playing Washington State will not help Stanford's
strength of schedule, a big victory could help move the

Cardinal up in the polls. A win on Saturday would also
give Stanford its best start since 1970.
Like most Pac-10 teams, Stanford has had little trou
ble with Washington State the past few seasons. Last
year, the Cardinal opened its season with a 39-13 victory
over the Cougars in Pullman, Wash., and two years ago
Stanford routed Washington State 58-0.
The Cougars have struggled in recent seasons, partic
ularly on the road. Washington State has not won a game
outside the state of Washington since 2006, a string of 20
consecutive defeats. The past few games have been en
couraging, though, as the Cougars have held tough
against quality teams. Washington State's last two games
were both against top-20 teams, Oregon and Arizona,
and it lost both respectably, 43-23 and 24-7. This is in
stark contrast to the last two years, when the Cougars
lost by combined scores of 122-42 and 100-13 to the same
two teams, even though both the Ducks and Wildcats are
having better seasons this year.
Despite their improvements, though, the Cougars are
still among the worst teams in the nation in several sta
tistical categories. Out of 120 FBS teams, Washington
State is 103 rd in scoring offense, managing fewer than 20
points per game, and 116 th in rushing offense. This pales
in comparison to the Cougar defense, though, which is
dead last in yards allowed, second-worst in rushing yards
allowed and third-worst in points allowed.
