# Prof. Ian Morris debuts new book

At 7 p.m. on a Wednesday,
the back of Kepler's Books
was packed. Most of the
crowd was older people who
likely never had the good fortune
to take a class with classics and
history Prof. Lan Morris but
upon cracking his new book,
"Why the West Rules For
Now," one could see why they
came. And upon hearing him
speak, one could see why they
stayed. The event was reminiscent
of the days when "Ancient
Empires" was one of the most
popular IHUM classes; Morris is,
as ever, a maestro of the lectern.
Morris opened with a
thought experiment: what if
China had colonized Britain,
rather than Britain colonizing
Hong Kong? He read from the
first chapter of his book, where he
envisions an alternate history in
which the Emperor of China dis
patches the governor Qiying to
accept Queen Victoria's fealty and
to administer Britain. (Morris
later confessed an obsession with
science fiction, which is apparent
ly a source of consternation in
certain academic circles.) He chal
lenged the audience to consider
why history unfolded as it did in
reality, with the Western world
coming out on top. After all, from
about 550 to 1750 A.D., he said,
China was significantly more
advanced than any of the various
post-Roman Western states.
He spoke about his experi-

ences teaching at the University of
Chicago, where he found enough
problems with the prevalent doc
trine of intrinsic Western superi
ority (he was careful to note that
the mentality of the time was very
much influenced by the Cold
War) that he decided to make up
his own answer.
Morris proposed, in "Why
the West Rules," that a combina
tion of biology, sociology and
geography could explain all of
human history, calling it, in that
particular British accent of his, a
theory of "chaps and maps."
Geography drives society, he
argued, but society changes the
significance of geography; even
today, even now, the meaning of
geography is changing, which is
why the title ends in "For Now."
Morris told a rapt audience that
he predicted by means of pro
jecting each side's "social develop
ment score," a calculation he
devised especially for this project
that the East would catch up
with the West in 2103. He also
argued that, perhaps more signifi
cantly, the distinction between
East and West would no longer be
important then an especially
relevant idea in this age of
increasing globalization.
The book is equally engaging
(his particular brand of humor
translates well onto the page) and
makes equally grand, cosmic pre
dictions about the future of our
world. He spins a cohesive narra

tive of Eurasian history in 600
pages and devotes the rest of the
book to similarly vivid projections
of the world as it might become.
Morris confessed himself much
enamored with the Winston
Churchill quotation, "The farther
backward you can look, the far
ther forward you can see."
Given his background in

archaeology and classical history,
manifest in the extraordinary
scope of his work, it comes as no
surprise that Morris can see very
far indeed.
