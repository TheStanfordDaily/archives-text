### â€”marisa LANDICHO contact marisa: landicho@stanford. edu 
Composer, performer and director
Rinde Eckert will take center stage at
the Center for Computer Research in
Music and Acoustics (CCRMA) Friday night.
Eckert's one-night show marks the return of
CCRMA Cabaret 2.0, a series put on by
CCRMA and Stanford Lively Arts.
In its second year, CCRMA Cabaret
places boundary-defying performers hired by
Lively Arts on the CCRMA stage for smaller
solo sets. For the events in winter and spring
quarter, students will work with the artists on
the technical side of the production.
"The initial idea was that artists who
were performing with larger acts for Lively
Arts, who had an interest in electronic or
experimental music, would be able to come
up to CCRMA for one night for a more inti
mate gathering with students, and make their
music up here," said CCRMA technical coor
dinator Sasha Leitman, one of the event
organizers.

With a long history of one-man shows,
Eckert was a logical first choice of performer,
according to Leitman. Eckert, who received
The Alpert Award in the Arts in 2009, started
off as a composer in the 1980s before
branching out into more experimental the
ater. In his career, he has composed dance
scores, staged solo acts and had his work pro
duced by the New York Theatre Workshop,
American Repertory Theatre and The
Foundry Theatre and Culture Project in New
York.
Eckert is involved with two other proj
ects on campus this year: he will perform in
composer Steve Mackey's "SLIDE" with the
Grammy Award-winning eighth blackbird
(March 5) and direct sound-sculptor
Gerhard Trimpin's "The Gurs Zyklus," a per
formance piece based on the Nazi-era intern
ment camp (May 14).
Friday's show will include elements from
previous works, "Flighway Ulysses" and "And

God Created Great Whales," based off of the
book "Moby Dick." In addition, the audience
can expect pieces from his in-progress solo
work, "An Idiot Divine."
"It's a one-man show that mixes theater
and music," Leitman said. "Guitars, some
piano, small percussion, flutes, accordion
and he'll play all of them."
During winter quarter, students may
sign up to take MUSIC 2508, where they will
participate in the sound and control design

of two 40-foot teeter-totters with rolling
wheel speakers to be used in the CCRMA
Cabaret series.
Eckert performs tonight at 8 p.m. on the
CCRMA stage. Admission is free.
