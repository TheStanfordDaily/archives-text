## HAMLET' TRAVELS TO ALCATRAZ 
### â€”halle EDWARDS contact halle: halle@stanford. edu 
Shakespeare's "Hamlet" is one of the
most well-known plays in the world and
has been performed in hundreds of dif
ferent venues by a variety of actors. However,
it is safe to say it has never been performed
like the We Players performed it on Alcatraz
Island. By using the island itself as a set,

director Ava Roy transformed Shakespeare's
well-known play into a fresh and unexpected
artistic experience.
This production of "Hamlet" was not set
on a traditional stage. Instead, the audience
followed the actors around to different loca
tions on Alcatraz Island to watch the scenes
play out. The scenes occurred outside in
places like the old exercise area of the prison
and the rocky paths surrounding it, and also
inside locations such as the old hospital wing.
Minimal set pieces were used to guide the

scenes, but the island served as the main
backdrop. Even the characters' costumes
echoed this minimalist scheme, made with
mostly gray or dark colors and simple
designs.
The acting in the play was mostly strong.
The character of Hamlet, played by actress
(yes, actress) Andrus Nichols, however, was
somewhat flat. Throughout the play, the
actress focused on the more manic aspects of
Hamlet's personality, playing the character as
extremely depressed, dramatic and flustered.

Although the performance was certainly
attention-grabbing, by leaving out the more
nuanced aspects of Hamlet's character, the
play suffered in quality.
Scott D. Phillips, playing Claudius, was a
firm counterpoint to Hamlet. Equal parts
menacing, creepy, confident and tormented,
the actor brilliantly conveyed Claudius's char
acter while still communicating that he is,
without a doubt, the villain. Misti Boettiger,
playing Ophelia, was also strong, especially
during the character's descent into madness.
She showed all of the vulnerability and inno
cence of the character while lending her a
confident, self-assured edge in the first part of
the play, offering a stronger interpretation of
Ophelia's character. Laertes, played by
Benjamin Stowe, also offered a convincing,
tragic performance as Ophelia sank into
madness.
The setting of Alcatraz Island was perfect
for "Hamlet." The island is very bleak, usually
cold and famous for the old prison structure
that dominates it. The various unkempt ruins
around the island also contribute to its bleak,
decaying image. All of this perfectly mirrors
the atmosphere in "Hamlet," which is set in
the coldest, darkest months of the year in
Denmark, a country Hamlet refers to as "a
prison." Walking around the island with the
characters, it is easy to understand Hamlet's
growing despair. The action of the play is so
much more real and engaging when it takes
place just feet away from you, rather than up
on an isolated stage. Roy makes excellent use
of various features of the island, as well as
minimal set decoration, to enhance themes in
