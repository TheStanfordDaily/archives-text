## LINES Ballet stretches its limbs for the fall season 
### â€”stav ZIV contact stav: sziv@stanford. edu 
Alonzo King's LINES Ballet, based in
San Francisco, is well known for its
jaw-dropping collection of sinewy
limbs and impossible virtuosity, offering the
ideal vehicle for a choreographer's every
whim and creative impulse. And King's are
plenty.
LINES Ballet's 2010 fall program opened
with "Dust and Light," drifting through
Baroque instrumental and choral odes.
Aided by partners, dancers skimmed the sur
face of the floor and slid across it, suspended
over a shoulder or spun upside down, only to
be placed back on the ground without a
moment's hesitation. A seamless continuity
of motion unfolded, one moment blending
effortlessly into the next, as the beautiful
fused with the extreme and even the slightly
awkward.
Simply adorned in dresses, skirts or
shorts in muted tones (costumes not always
segregated as expected by gender), bodies
traversed the stage and filled its three dimen
sions with shapes and shadows. Women's
skin-colored pointe shoes became natural
extensions of the human body; they quietly
magnified the scope of physical capacity
rather than acting merely as instruments to
don at show time.
Dancers frequently entered and exited
the stage, and the audience's gaze fell upon a
quick succession of newly occupied spaces.
Only in the final stretch of the 30-minute
piece did the entire company return as a
group for the most eloquent passage of uni
son, canonized and independent voices of
"Dust and Light." Darkness descended upon
a last dancer, turning, back arched toward his
leg bent high behind him, as his silhouette
faded into black for intermission.
A provocative tale of adultery and mur
der, "Scheherazade" shocked Parisian audi
ences with a spectacle of the exotic and the
erotic, a bold and colorful display capitaliz
ing on society's predilection for Orientalism.
"The Book of One Thousand and One
Nights," or "The Arabian Nights," inspired
Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov's composition
loosely based on the tale of the Persian queen
"Scheherazade," and provided source materi
al for the ballet. Diaghilev's Ballets Russes
exported a Russian vision of the East to cul
tural centers of the West.
One hundred years later, King re-imag
ined the 1910 collaboration among Michel
Fokine, Leon Bakst and Rimsky-Korsakov for
the 21st century, forgoing most literal aspects
of the original production.
King's "Scheherazade" was performed to
live tabla music in a stunning architecture of
fabric and lighting. The set's design
ensconced the stage in rich yellows and reds,
light ebbing and flowing against its solid and
translucent surroundings. Dancers rippled

their torsos and leapt through the air, draped
in billowing costume pieces that extended
their movement in time and space.
Ballets that lack explicit narrative ele
ments are not uncommon, especially in the
U.S., whose tradition was shaped by George
Balanchine, master of the plot-less ballet.
Balanchine's deep understanding of musical
qualities and their aesthetic repercussions, as
well as the inherently dramatic effect of plac
ing bodies on a stage, produced work that
was both purposeful and compelling.
Fleeting moments in King's choreogra
phy evoked a captivating atmosphere, but at
times, it erred on indulgent rather than
inspiring. On the surface, the dancers' unnat
ural facility tapped physical expression to its
fullest potential. But the movement some
times strayed from emotional and dramatic
cohesion that would give depth and reso
nance to the beautiful shapes.
Still, LINES is a superb company of
international renown, home to artists of
exquisite talent. "Dust and Light" and
"Scheherazade" offered a feast for the eyes, an
evening of visual rapture to be enjoyed by
dance enthusiasts and novices alike.
LINES' home season extends through
this Sunday, Oct. 24 at Yerba Buena Center
for the Arts in San Francisco.
