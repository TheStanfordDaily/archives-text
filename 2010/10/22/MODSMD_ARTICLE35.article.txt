## Music, music, everywhere Intermission reports from Treasure Island 
### â€”annika HEINLE, marisa LANDICHO, ryan MAC 
We realized a couple things
after the fourth annual
Treasure Island Music
Festival this weekend:
1) Everything is much the same
as years past. There's still the solid
network of free shuttle transporta
tion to get you to the island. There's
still the same layout: two stages,
Ferris wheel and assortment of art
and fashion stops. And there's still
the spectacular sunset over the Bay,
framed by the Bay Bridge and that
beautiful fog-shrouded city skyline.
2) The wind blows. On an island
rising out of the San Francisco Bay,
there's no hiding from the elements.
Plenty of festival-goers sporting their
skimpiest outfits for Saturday's dance
party were forced into submission by
the cold. But it's fall. In the Bay.
What could you expect?
3) The split-genre, with elec
tronic Saturday and chill Sunday,
works. Round two's indie-thon was
mellow and cozy compared to its
trip-the-light-fantastic predecessor,
giving something for everyone.
The festival, keeping to its for
mula of small-scale, high quality acts
can count this year in its win col
umn.

Intermission recaps TIMF2OIO
below.
Saturday
Within the first beats of Holy
Fuck's opening Saturday afternoon,
lead keyboardist Brian Borcherdt was
simultaneously playing an antique
film strip yes, that stuff used for
movies and swallowing a mic. The
almost-electronic band avoided the
laptops and loops of their more digi
tal compatriots, incorporating
instead a 35-mm film synchronizer, a
slew of kids' keyboards and a top
notch live bassist and drummer. The
result was four Canadians hunched
and enthusiastically bobbing in uni
son over whale screeches and crash
ing melodies.
Jamaica was a wildcard for festi
val organizers. They had only played
two previous shows in the U.S.
before their TIMF2OIO appearance,
and the duo's bassist Florent Lyonnet
was temporarily M.I.A. due to
injury. But all fears were erased with
the first throwback chords of "Cross
the Fader." Antoine Hilaire, the other
half of Jamaica, pulled it together
with his touring members to pro
duce a jamming 40 minutes of head
banging material off their debut,
"No Problem."
Eager festival-goers gathered at
the Bridge Stage at 3 p.m. to wit
ness South Africa's next great cul
tural creation, Die

Antwoord. What they were treated to
was simply a mindfuck of antics. Yo-
Landi Visser complimented her heli
um-powered voice with bouts of
water-spitting into the crowd, sug
gestive dancing and a knack for bar
ing her butt for all to see. Ninja fol
lowed up with his own debauchery,
displaying his infamous hip thrust
and getting intimate with the crowd
with an impromptu stage dive. "Be
happy!" Yo-Landi said as they exited.
We're just happy we're not that nut
ters.
Following the guano-jacked Die

Antwoord, the New York duo
Phantogram brought a more ethere
al and brooding intensity to the early
afternoon. Gliding through this
year's "Eyelid Movies," keyboardist
Sarah Barthel's breathy and haunting
vocals wove in and out of Josh
Carter's guitar. The pair's lush
cadence had girls swaying in the
Treasure Island breeze, only inter
rupted by the flashes of feedback
that organizers were eventually able
to tame.
Halfway through the windy day,
energy for many in the crowd began

to dwindle. Brooklyn-based !!! (pro
nounced "chik-chik-chik") stepped
up to the challenge and then some.
With a funk-infused sound, the boys
got the crowd dancing, doing its best
to imitate the moves of charismatic
lead singer Nic Offer, who gyrated
every chance that he had and yelled
to the crowd and the group of pho
tographers, "I was made for the cam
era!" Performing their collective
heart out to hits like "Me and
Giuliani Down By the School Yard"
and "The Hammer," !!! left the audi
ence with no doubt that they were,
in fact, made for the camera and
made for the dance floor.
Perhaps the biggest surprise of
the day was Austrian super-duo
Kruder and Dorfmeister. Playing a
live set after a 10-year hiatus, the
founders of G-Stone were dressed
sharply in slick suits, standing
behind and below what looked like
an immense desk of light, a veritable
wall of electronic fireworks, Jackson
Pollock-esque lights looking like
splashes of paint and an otherwise
constant assault on the eyes. With
two equally well-dressed MCs to
hype the crowd up, dauntingly
describing "the bass line that is
sweeping the nation," Kruder and
Dorfmeister stood coolly over the
turntables, with a bossanova dub
sound that kept the audience danc
ing and simultaneously in a hypnotic
trance.
Indisputably the biggest rock
star at the festival, Canadian-born DJ
Joel Zimmerman, the man behind
Deadmaus, has created a cult of per
sonality behind his sinister Mickey
Mouse head. With countless atten
dees present just to witness his hour
long set, Deadmaus did what he
does best and let his maus cube and
music speak for itself. With one song
supported by hype-woman SOFI, the
rest of the set left the crowd
entranced and dancing to hits like
"Some Chords," "Sometimes Things
Get, Whatever" and "Ghosts N'
Stuff," the latter of which had
Zimmerman step out of the LED
Maushead and throw on a minimal
istic sheet to engage with the crowd.
Departing memorably with a middle
finger to the crowd, the too-short set
further proved that house music and
inspired branding has created the
biggest dance superstar since Daft
Punk.
Miike Snow was slotted at the
Tunnel stage behind Deadmaus, and
fans had to decide whether to relin
quish territory for LCD or be con-

tent with hearing the Swedish outfit
from afar. The latter folk missed a
fog and light, wall of sound display
that boasted six masked men
arranged on equipment eerily similar
to the film "Metropolis." The set,
minus the kick-ass closer, was drawn
from the band's eponymous album,
though the live songs abandoned the
gloss and cheerful recorded elements
and instead turned up the lurking
bass lines to full sonic tilt. Favorites
"Silvia" and "Animal" produced the
expected dance pits, but it was the
quirky closing cover of Vampire
Weekend's "The Kids Don't Stand a
Chance" that lit up the San Francisco
skyline, singer Andrew Wyatt inton
ing, " Kids ... don't... stand...
chance" to exit the night.
LCD Soundsystem's Saturday
set proved to be a set of contradic
tions. Closing out the Bridge Stage
on day one, they were the only head
liner on the main stage not to use
the massive LCD display behind
them, opting for a simpler approach
with flashing spotlights. On the
audio front, the band opted to play a
smattering of offerings from newest
album, "This Is Happening," opening
with the popular "Dance Yrself
Clean" and later playing "You

Wanted A Hit."
From Murphy playing a double
cowbell to Pat Mahoney's frenetic
drumming to Nancy Whang's key
board command, these seasoned vets
created music that's inescapable and
infectious in a style that's unmistak
ably their own. Who else could write
a song which has the crowd scream
ing "Yeah" for 10 minutes? And for
the final contradiction of the night,
the band played the beautiful
"Home" when no one really wanted
to head for the exit, unable to play
an encore and eventually walking off
stage into the cold San Francisco
night.
Sunday
Ra Ra Riot took to the Bridge
Stage early Sunday so early that
many festival-goers, discouraged by
the rain, hadn't shown up yet. Still,
the band managed to pull it off,
trekking through the showers to try
newer songs like "Boy" and
"Shadowcasting." And there was a
little something new for everyone.
Lead singer Wes Miles who had
some vision problems without his
glasses took over guitar duties
from Milo Bonacci, cellist Alexandra
Lawn tested her pipes on "You and I

Know" and some of the crowd was
watching their first set of the day in
ponchos.
The members of 90s punk-rock
Superchunk may kind of resemble
suburban parents, but hey, at least
they seem like cool suburban par
ents. The band, touring for "Majesty
Shredding," their first album in near
ly a decade, were self-deprecating
between and exuberant during
songs, from their ridiculous self
introduction to the kick-drum bust
ing bridge of new "Digging for
Something" to the squeaky-clean
guitar line of "Hello Hawk" off
1999's "Come Pick Me Up."
Highlight "Crossed Wires" had a
jump-right-in chorus that appealed
to all generations assembled.
The perpetually adorable Zooey
Deschanel and effortlessly cool M.
Ward of duo She & Him were a fun,
saccharine blast to the overcast skies
call it suffocation by cotton
candy. The producer-actress combo's
"Volume One" and "Volume Two"
provided pleasant Beach Boys-tinged
material for the afternoon set, tightly
toeing the line between uplifting and
cutesy in the almost-heartbreaking


COURTESY BRIAN VALDIZNO/Treeswingers
Ninja, one third of South Africa's Die Antwoord, spewed some of the most expletive lyrics of the entire Treasure Island Music Festival. Ranging
from "Evil Boy" to "Rich Bitch," the adrenaline-jacked threesome embarked on a mixed-language rap journey Saturday afternoon.

Belle & Sebastian's Stuart Murdoch (top) stole Sunday night's closing
show with his delicate running man and hypnotic dancing. Between
songs, the singer pulled up lucky fans to dance on stage for "There's
Too Much Love" (spotted among them: Surfer Blood singer JP Pitts).


COURTESY BRIAN VALDIZNO/Treeswingers
Surfer Blood's 45-minute set on Sunday night was by no means enough for the gathered fans, a large
contingent of whom stayed by the stage afterward begging for an encore. The fest's rigid schedule
made extended sets impossible, to the consternation of the girls who threw their bras to the young
band.
