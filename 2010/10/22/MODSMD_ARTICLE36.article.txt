For the opening of its new
exhibition,
"Vodoun/Vodounon:
Portraits of Initiates," the Cantor
Arts Center has literally been
blessed. On the opening night of
the exhibition last Wednesday, Oct.
13, local Bay Area Vodoun practi
tioners blessed the space, enacting
an hour-long ceremony outside the
museum. This display of religious
significance is in line with the larg
er exhibition, which features the
Belgian photographer Jean-
Dominique Burton's photographic
series from 2007 of initiates into
the Vodoun religion of the
Republic of Benin in West Africa.
The exhibition features 25
photographic diptychs that pair
black-and-white portraits of
Vodounon, the priest and priest
esses of the Vodoun religion, with
color photographs of their conse
crated shrines. In these pairings,
the photographic series provides an
intimate look into the aesthetic
beauty and sacred significance of
both practioner and religious
object. Taken together, we come to
understand the Vodoun religion as
one of both people and practice.
Before entering the exhibition
gallery itself, the first diptych of
"Vodoun/Vodounon: Portraits of
Initiates" makes an appearance in
the Cantor Arts Center's monu
mental entrance hall. In this lobby,
a photograph of the elderly
Combethe Andee
Doulolougba/Dan Heke Cotonou is
paired with her sacred shrine, both
large-scale hanging prints on linen.
The considerable scale of this pair

ing gives the Vodounon and her
shrine a force that is larger than
life.
Though much smaller, four
similar hanging-linen life-size
prints comprise the center space of
the exhibition gallery's interior.
Along the space of the walls, even
smaller photographic pairings
round out the exhibition's display.
In the varying sizes of these paired
photographs, we encounter the
Vodounon and their shrines as
both grandiose emblems of reli
gious potency and intimate por
traits of religious earnestness.
Two particular striking pairs of
Vodounon and their shrines are of
note. A stunning portrait of
Allognikin Touna De Souza
Marcelle/Shango-Yalode Pahou is
paired with the Vodounon's shrine,
comprised of ceramic pots, bowls,
mortar and cloth. The Vodounon
sitter's solemn beauty shines in the
medium of black-and-white pho
tography, which highlights the con
trast between the figure's dark skin
and her white headdress.
Interestingly, this Vodounon's
shrine, with its anthropomorphic
shape and clothed top, bears strong
resemblance to the head-dressed
Vodounon herself. In a similar
manner, the photograph next to
this series features Odjouman
Monlade/Chango Pobe, whose pat
terned headpiece visually rhymes
with the dynamic patterned cloth
of his shrine. In the similarity
between religious practitioner and
religious object, the inextricable
connection between communicator
and conduit with the gods is made
explicit.
Further, the thorough wall
labels throughout the space of the

gallery elucidate the various tenants
of the Vodounon religion. It is
through one of these wall labels
that we come to understand the
significance of Mawu-Lisa as the
god of the Vodoun religion, com
prised of the Mawu female princi
ple and Lisa male principle. As a
result, one sees the near-equal
number of Vodoun priestesses and
priests pictured here as a reflection
of the equal reverence for the femi
nine and masculine in the Vodoun
religion.
From these wall labels, we also
learn about important figures of
the Vodoun religion, such as
Sakpata, Shango, Dan and Ogou.
After reading about these legends,
significant aspects of the shrines
come in to focus, such as the cen
trality of materials from the earth,
as well as metallurgy.
In the vast display of Vodoun
shrines on view in the exhibition,
we come to see these objects as
bricolage of a wide-ranging variety
of materials, including jewelry, can
dles, feathers, shells, books and cig
arettes. Moving past aesthetic beau
ty, these are not simply art objects
as we are perhaps normally accus
tomed, but also highly charged
symbols of spiritual worship.
The question becomes, with
what does one walk away from
these portraits of religious initiates
and their objects of worship? In
describing the exhibition's stakes,
curator Barbara Thompson writes:
"The Western myth of 'voodoo'
as it has been widely popularized
by Hollywood films and other
media has painted a dark vision
of a world filled with occult prac
tices, black magic, zombies, voodoo
dolls and witch doctors. Far

removed from this Westerner mis
conception, the Vodoun religion
places primacy on calmness, intro
spection and order." In our
encounter with these intimate por
traits of "calmness, introspection
and order," we develop a reverence
and respect for the practitioners
and their objects.
As another helpful wall text
describes, the religion of Vodoun is
"an ever-growing pantheon of new
and foreign spirits," which, as a
result of the African Diaspora, has
circulated throughout the world to
Benin, Togo, Ghana, Haiti, the
Dominican Republic and the
United States. Practiced by over 60
million people, Vodoun is a diverse
and vibrant set of religious prac
tices, and the photographs in
"Vodoun/Vodounon: Portraits of
Initiates" do well to bring this reali
ty to light.

prised of the Mawu female princi
ple and Lisa male principle. As a
result, one sees the near-equal
number of Vodoun priestesses and
priests pictured here as a reflection
of the equal reverence for the femi
nine and masculine in the Vodoun
religion.
From these wall labels, we also
learn about important figures of
the Vodoun religion, such as
Sakpata, Shango, Dan and Ogou.
After reading about these legends,
significant aspects of the shrines
come in to focus, such as the cen
trality of materials from the earth,
as well as metallurgy.
In the vast display of Vodoun
shrines on view in the exhibition,
we come to see these objects as
bricolage of a wide-ranging variety
of materials, including jewelry, can
dles, feathers, shells, books and cig
arettes. Moving past aesthetic beau
ty, these are not simply art objects
as we are perhaps normally accus
tomed, but also highly charged
symbols of spiritual worship.
The question becomes, with
what does one walk away from
these portraits of religious initiates
and their objects of worship? In
describing the exhibition's stakes,
curator Barbara Thompson writes:
"The Western myth of 'voodoo'
as it has been widely popularized
by Hollywood films and other
media has painted a dark vision
of a world filled with occult prac
tices, black magic, zombies, voodoo
dolls and witch doctors. Far

removed from this Westerner mis
conception, the Vodoun religion
places primacy on calmness, intro
spection and order." In our
encounter with these intimate por
traits of "calmness, introspection
and order," we develop a reverence
and respect for the practitioners
and their objects.
As another helpful wall text
describes, the religion of Vodoun is
"an ever-growing pantheon of new
and foreign spirits," which, as a
result of the African Diaspora, has
circulated throughout the world to
Benin, Togo, Ghana, Haiti, the
Dominican Republic and the
United States. Practiced by over 60
million people, Vodoun is a diverse
and vibrant set of religious prac
tices, and the photographs in
"Vodoun/Vodounon: Portraits of
Initiates" do well to bring this reali
ty to light.
"Vodoun/Vodounon: Portraits
of Initiates" runs until March 20,
2011.
