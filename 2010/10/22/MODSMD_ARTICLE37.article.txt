## IMPRESSIONISM ON DISPLAY 
### â€”armine PILIKIAN contact armine: arminep@stanford. edu 
The second of two installations
from Musee d'Orsay's perma
nent collection of
Impressionist works, "Van Gogh,
Gauguin, Cezanne and Beyond: Post-
Impressionist Masterpieces," was dis
played in only one museum in all of
North America the de Young
Museum in San Francisco. This
might explain the seas of observers
who have swarmed de Young's halls
since Sept. 25. These late 19th-centu
ry paintings have been drilled into
our generation's understanding of art
and history whether through text-

book covers or oversized prints deco
rating your roommate's wall, you
know a Van Gogh and can recognize
a Cezanne.
The first room displayed seven
incredibly famous Van Gogh paint
ings, including his vibrant blue-green
"Bedroom at Arles"(1889), a prickly
self-"Portrait of the Artist"(lBB7) and
of course, some flowers. Van Gogh's
"Starry Night Over the Rhone"
(1888) had the most heads floating
around it, making it nearly impossi
ble to zoom in on the shimmering
painting. In the same room hung the
works of Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec,
an artist whose color palette and
stroke pattern intimately reflected
Van Gogh's.
Developing chronologically, the
next room housed Paul Cezanne's
masterpieces, depicting onions in his
self-explanatory "Still Life With
Onions" (1896-98), handsome nudes
("Bathers") and some fruits
("Kitchen Table"). Another distin
guished presence in the room was
Pierre-Auguste Renoir, displayed in
several large works, including his
famous "A Dance in the Country"
(1883).
And then the world got brighter
stepping into Paul Gauguin's space,
portrayed in 10 works, from the yel

low Christ "Self-Portrait" (1889) to
various paintings of exotic Tahitian
women. This signified the shift into
Cloisonnism, a style of post-
Impressionism defined by flat and
colorful forms, boldly contoured and
highly abstracted. Several artists, such
as Paul Serusier and Emile Bernard
helped create this form, having
worked closely with Gauguin. One of
the most striking pictures is Bernard's
"Madeleine in the Bois d-Amour," a
painting of Gauguin's sister, who
Bernard later fell madly in love with.
The final movement in the

exhibit showcased Les Nabis, a group
of avant-garde artists highly influ
enced by Impressionism. Their works
ranged from a decorative style to
fapanese prints, from miniature can
vases to panoramic paintings cover
ing entire walls. Two artists, Pierre
Bonnard and Jean-Edouard Vuillard,
explored emotionally charged scenes
of domestic life; Bonnard's "The
White Cat" was the most famous of
these decorative paintings (perhaps
because the cat is both perfect and
fluffy). Their works mirrored the
brush strokes and vague, dream-like
feel of early Impressionist works. But
artists such as Henri Rousseau, in
works like "The Snake Charmer,"
explored divergent color schemes and
symbolic, unrealistic imagery.
The images in the exhibit had
both vivid reactions to Impressionism
and subdued reflections, so the over
all experience felt both cohesive and
dizzyingly impressive.
"Van Gogh, Gauguin, Cezanne
and Beyond" runs through Jan. 18 at
the M.H. de Young Museum in San
Francisco.
