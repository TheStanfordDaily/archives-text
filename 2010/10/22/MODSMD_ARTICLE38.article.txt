Part teen movie, part serious
look at the lives of the men
tally ill, "It's Kind of a Funny
Story" explores what would happen
if a typical high school student had
to stay in a psychiatric hospital. The
film is based on the novel of the
same name by Ned Vizzini and
directed by Anna Boden and Ryan
Fleck, who previously collaborated
on 2008's "Sugar."
The film revolves around Craig
(Keir Gilchrist), a depressed 16-
year-old high school student strug
gling with typical teenage troubles:
pressure to get into a good college,

fear of disappointing his parents
and angst over the fact that he is in
love with his best friend Aaron's
(Thomas Mann) girlfriend Nia
(Zoe Kravitz). Coupled with his
depression, these problems cause
Craig to seriously contemplate sui
cide, prompting him to check him
self into a psychiatric hospital.
Most of the movie centers on
Craig's five days in the psychiatric
ward. There he meets patients like
Bobby (Zach Galifianakis), a trou
bled man who has been in and out
of the psychiatric ward for years,
and Noelle (Emma Roberts), a fel-

low teenager who struggles with
self-injury.
During his stay, Craig starts to
put his problems in perspective
with everyone else's and realizes
that his problems pale in compari
son with his blessings a good
family, a great school and amazing
prospects. This realization spurs
Craig to reach out to his fellow
patients while embracing some of
his neglected hobbies, like drawing.
Although Gilchrist carries the
movie well, Galifianakis is the real
acting standout. He balances a
calm, witty persona with occasional
dramatic outbursts to create a char
acter that is funny, realistic and
troubled without being melodra
matic. Roberts is also charming and
likeable as Noelle, Craig's eventual
love interest.
Even though the film is well
acted, the plot is predictable and the
ending feels a bit cliche, despite the
narrator's attempt to break the
fourth wall and convince the audi
ence it is not. The movie also relies
on breaking the narrative with short
montages highlighting the many
facets of Craig's life, which begin to
feel overdone as the film wears on.

However, the film over
comes its predictable plot
and montage-heavy
structure with clever,
witty writing. There are
plenty of hilarious one
liners and jokes, usually
courtesy of Galifianakis's
Bobby. The awkward
tension between the
patients of the ward also

makes for some good laughs, as
does the love triangle between Nia,
Noelle and Craig.
A lot of the fun of "Funny
Story" comes from the classic teen
movie tropes it employs an
inserted musical sequence (com
plete with sequin-heavy costumes),
high school drama and illicit
escapes from the psychiatric ward
set to an upbeat indie soundtrack.
However, through Galifianakis's
character, the film also provides a
serious glimpse into the life of
someone who has a chronic mental
illness and how that can affect his
family, home and happiness.
Along with this insight, "Funny
Story" offers an interesting perspec
tive about the lives of overachieving
high school students and how the

pressure to succeed can overshadow
the simpler joys of being a teenager.
This is underscored when, in a seri
ous moment, Bobby tells Craig that
he would give anything to walk in
his shoes for just a day, because
Craig has so much going for him.
It's a message that will certainly be
well-received by the average high
school or college student.
"It's Kind of a Funny Story"
takes a typical teen movie and sub
verts it with a serious storyline
about mental illness. Boosted by
strong acting and solid writing, it
makes for a fun if slightly pre
dictable movie-going experience.
