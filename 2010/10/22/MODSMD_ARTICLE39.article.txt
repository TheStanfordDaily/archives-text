"Life as We Know It" is a com
edy/drama that explores the possi
bility of what it feels like to wake
up one day and find that "life as
we know it is never the same," as
tagged in the trailer. The movie
follows a classic romantic TV
drama plot, except it is a bit more
unexpected, more dramatic and
more grown-up. But while the
movie gets a round of applause for
its sweetness and its seemingly
awesome suspense in the title, it
simply falls flat on viewers' expec
tation of a solid, funny, romantic
drama.
The movie starts with an awk
ward first date that kills whatever
love seed is planted between the
two main characters Holly
Berenson (Katherine Heigl from
"Grey's Anatomy" fame) and Eric
Messer (Josh Duhamel, mid
"Transformers" run). But life never
happens the way you want it to,
and of course, this time life does

its trick as well, bringing the two
rivals back together by throwing at
them a life-size baby. And this is
where all the fun starts.
The baby's arrival is explained
in true Hollywood fashion. Holly's
best friend and Eric's best friend
are married, so at every get
together and every party, the pair
engages in countless sarcastic
fights. Soon, their best friends have
a daughter, Sophie. Both Holly and
Eric rejoice in this little precious
thing, but not for long. A car acci
dent makes Sophie an orphan, and
compounding Holly and Eric's
grief is the news that they both are
the newly appointed guardians for
little Sophie. Dumbfounded, Holly
and Eric now have to work hard to
raise Sophie and to figure out their
personal lives.
The movie has all its elements
right: the hilarious adventure with
changing baby diapers, the frus
trating but not heart-wrenching

misconceptions and the sad but
not tear-teasing pursuit to the air
port. The adorable baby Sophie
easily brings about happiness to
create the necessary light-hearted
atmosphere. In addition to that,
the snippets of big and small fights
between the "single status" couple
are fun to watch.
However, maybe the touch of
classic is too heavy or the landed
with-a-baby idea is just not new
enough. The movie is cute, but not
enough to send people flying back
to watch it a second time like the
movie "Knight and Day" does. The
commonplace humor of dealing
with babies manages to induce
some giggles but never whole
hearted laughs; the classic love plot
succeeds in producing a love
drama but largely fails to grab the
audience's emotions.
The whole movie lacks the
cohesiveness that builds a memo
rable love story. Maybe it's the way

the movie is portrayed; maybe it's
the plot itself. The love is just not
deep and attractive enough to etch
itself into your memory instead of
straying into oblivion when the
movie is over.
So, in a word, no serious
action, no love at first sight, but
more ups and downs of raising a
baby, more balancing work life
with a baby and more "life as we
know it." It would be most suitable
for dating couples and a senior
audience, since it is warm, mostly
gentle and glowing with love.
