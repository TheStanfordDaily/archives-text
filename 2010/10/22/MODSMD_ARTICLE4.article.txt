NO. 12 STANFORD (5-1,2-1 PAC-10) US.
WASHINGTON STATE (1 -6,0-4 PAC-10]

KABIR SAWHNEY
STANFORD 48, WASHINGTON STATE 21 I While the Cougars have
shown signs of life in recent weeks, they are still undeniably the Pac-10's worst
team, and should be in for another beatdown in Stanford Stadium. The last time
Washington State visited the Farm, it fell 58-0 to a Cardinal squad that only fin
ished 5-7. Andrew Luck should obliterate Wazzu's Swiss-cheese-like defense. The
Washington State offense, under young QB Jeff Tuel, can gain some ground
against a suspect Cardinal defense, but not nearly enough to match Luck & Co.
point for point.

Y ZACH ZIMMERMAN
\ STANFORD 55, WASHINGTON STATE 13: Stanford, like the rest
of the country for the past few seasons, owns Washington State. The
Cougars, behind surprise standout QB Jeff Tuel, are actually competent
on offense this year with Tuel throwing for at least 200 yards in every
\ game. That said, Wazzu's defense is horrid and the Cardinal
has the fifth-best scoring offense in the country. As 35-point
underdogs this week, I'd be out of my skull to pick the
Cougars in what will surely be a Homecoming blowout.
JACOB JAFFE
STANFORD 53, WASHINGTON STATE 26:
Stanford is comina off a bve. has one of the best offenses in

the country, is playing at home and has pollsters to impress. Washington State has
arguably the worst defense in the country and hasn't won a game in California
since 2006. Everything seems to point in the Cardinal's favor, and it shouldn't have
too much of a problem putting away Washington State. That said, the Cougars
have been much more competitive in recent weeks and might be able to cover the
spread. Despite some surprising success from the Wazzu passing game, Stanford
wins comfortably.
