It was wet. Security had forbid
den my newly purchased
umbrella (it has umbrellas on it
super meta), and as much as I
loved the undeniable sex appeal of
garbage bag ponchos, I was oh-so
relieved when the sun finally start
ed to peek through the Bay Area
gloom Sunday afternoon. As miser
able as standing ankle deep in mud
surrounded by clear plastic-bag
people was, Treasure Island Music
Festival was definitely a fascinating
study in the intersection of hobo
and hipster.
Luckily, the fashionably
adamant few braved the rain in
their Salvation Army coats and best
boots. Joking aside, I managed to
meet some incredibly cool girls
who managed to balance the pre
tension with unique pieces and gra
ciousness. Each of my three sub
jects created great looks around her
coat. From the perfect camel find
to a voluminous bat wing blanket
to that aesthetically definitive green

coat that radiated her personality,
each created the ensemble.
That's not to say that each girl
was just a well-selected coat; I was
most impressed by the little details
that they described as little treas
ures. One girl smiled and swished
her feather drop earrings from a
boutique she works at, and another
had a statement ring per grandma
and some not-so-swishable ear
rings made of authentic rattlesnake
fangs. I usually find that festival
wear tends to blend into some mass
reduction of an Urban Outfitters
catalogue, but despite the occasion
al tight-pants-flannel-flock, I was
impressed by the personal style
statements that shined through the
rain and the wind.
