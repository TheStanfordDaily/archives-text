## The
						maidens of 'Mad Men' 
### â€”liz STARK contact liz: estark12@stanford. edu 
As with the first three seasons
of the now-canonical epic
tale of Dick "Donald
Draper" Whitman, last week's sea
son finale was both an ending and
a beginning. Thematically, we saw
the end of Don's alcoholic, single
purgatory as well as the definitive
end to the Drapers of Ossining.
More important, however, as
implied by the episode's title
"Tomorrowland," we saw a begin
ning that attempts to ignore har
bingers from Sterling Cooper
Draper Pryce's first year while try
ing to reinstate the veneer of peace
from seasons past. Things are about
to get explicit in the most literal of
senses, so don't read on unless you
prefer my words to producer
Matthew Weiner's (and if you do,
why are you reading this column?).
In the finale, we find the main
cast of "Mad Men" forced to actual
ize their plans to reinvent them
selves through a proposal of
marriage, through relocation,
through lies or through sheer
pluck. Dick Whitman has premised
his entire life on this phoenix-like
process of rebirth and new begin
nings, but, now that his two identi
ties have begun to converge, he
must redefine Don Draper rather
than recede into Dick Whitman.
Dr. Faye Miller represents the latter,

as she proves time and time again
that she knows and understands
Dick; for this very reason, Don
chooses to propose to Megan
instead of Dr. Faye.
The reborn Don, who swims
daily and speaks in voice over to
The Stones' "I Can't Get No
Satisfaction," needs to sustain that
veneer with someone like Megan,
fragile and unnatural as it may be.
When Don tells Betty he's marrying
Megan on the final night in
Ossining, it's a return to season
two's penultimate episode, "The
Mountain King," in which Dick
tells Anna about Betty. "I met a
girl," he says. "She's so beautiful and
happy... I just like the way she
laughs, the way she looks at me."
These sentiments are implied in all
of Don's California interactions
with Megan from her adage
about no use crying over spilled
milkshakes to her glamorous L.A.
clubbing look. And just as Dick gets
a divorce from Anna to marry
Betty, he gets a ring from Anna to
propose to Megan. With Anna
gone, Betty is the new, knowing ex
wife a title we never expected to
see her wear so well.
While Don has the masculine
luxury of dumping Faye over the
phone (with Megan presumably lis
tening in), Betty is the captain of

her own Titanic. Despite her mini
mal onscreen presence this season,
we have seen Betty lose all her
power to her husband, her daugh
ter, her therapist and even Glen.
Don's seemingly ambivalent adul
tery, for all the trauma it caused
her, gave Betty the upper hand in
their relationship, eventually result
ing in the knowledge of his true
identity as Dick Whitman. Now,
Betty, surrounded by adults as
opposed to being alone, tells Henry
Francis, "I wanted a fresh start,
okay? I'm entitled to that." To
which he replies, "There is no fresh
start! Lives carry on." His wise
response is a warning to the view
ers of the show any argument
that beginnings are not without
baggage is misguided, particularly
about a show helmed by a man as
complex and character-obsessed as
series creator Weiner.
Take, for example, Joan. Joan is
literally carrying in her uterus the
baggage of her affair with Roger
Sterling, which predates even the
show's pilot. As much as this is a
show about the revolutionary
19605, Joan reneged on her abor
tion for reasons personal more
than moral and will try to con
vince her husband Greg that the
white-haired baby is his. In the
same way that Don invests in

Megan in part to secure a good
future for Sally, Bobby and Gene,
Joan hedges her bets with the next
generation in order to save her
marriage. For Joan, the new direc
tor of agency operations, the new
era means a change in semantics
and nothing more.
Among the show's four
leads, Peggy exemplifies change
achieved through merit. The
other women manipulate their
way, with babies and tantrums for
Joan and Betty respectively, into
power, and Don wants nothing
more than to relinquish some of
his onto the innocent Megan, but
Peggy is ready to carpe diem. She
embodies the Topaz stockings she
books as a client: the same Peggy
Olson underneath it all, donning
the skins of girlfriend, boss,
apprentice and modern woman.
