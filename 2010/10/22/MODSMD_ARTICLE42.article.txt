## Dough soars at 'Howie's Artisan Pizza'

"Pizza" can mean very different
things to different people. From the
ultra-thin slices of New York-style
pizza to the heart-clogging donut with
cheese that Chicagoans call pizza, it is
not always clear what you are going to
get when you walk into an independ
ent pizza operator. Perhaps the confu
sion stems from the fact that the his
tory of the plate is uncertain. The dish
has roots that appear to span at least
ancient Greek, Roman, Babylonian
and Egyptian cultures, although at
least in name it might be most closely
associated with the Romans, who
contributed the word "picea," mean
ing "the blackening of bread in an
oven."
Fortunately for visitors to Howie's
Artisan Pizza, you can be fairly cer
tain that you will find something to
enjoy. In general, expect a dough
roughly on par with something New
York-style and a light approach to
cheese and sauce that lets the other
toppings shine through well.

Howies has a casual sit-down
vibe. The venue could function well
for lunch or dinner with friends. The
decor gives off a bit of a sense of
"chain restaurant," but it fits overall
with the Town & Country Village air.
Many of the pizzas at Howie's
were excellent. The "Sun-Dried
Tomato Pesto & Scallion" pizza was
absolutely fantastic. The sun-dried
tomato pesto was perfectly sweet, and
the dish was refreshingly light. "The
Works" was interesting as well. The
pizza was a great mix of sweet (red
onion and sweet peppers) and savory
(pepperoni, sausage and salami) that
balances an otherwise motley crew of
ingredients. The same wonderful bal
ance was achieved with the "Cherry
Tomato, Smoked Mozz', Salami" pizza,
The plate also effused a particularly
pleasing aroma that is difficult to for
get.
