Your eyes meet. The light of
the Quad delicately outlines
the features on his or her
face. The intriguing stranger steps
forward; you step forward. While
most encounters such as this con
tinue with both parties making
casual small talk, tonight, the lips
are being put to a different use.
Ah, Full Moon on the Quad.
Roxy's a classy lady, apart from
a few smoothed-over scandals in
her past. As such, she knows better
than to reveal her true age but
it's safe to say that this lip-locking
initiation is not new territory for
the Sass. And a few years under her
belt have certainly left Roxy with
some foolproof strategies to make
the most of your mouthful.
So those who can: do. Those
who can't, pay attention then go
out and kiss like it ain't nobody's
business.
First, the preparations: fresh
breath and reinforcements are a
must. For the sake of public health
and general happiness, Roxy wants
to remind everyone that Listerine
is, at least for tonight, man's (and
woman's) best friend. Also be sure
to bring a trusted companion along
for the ride not for smooching
(why stick to one when you can
have many?), but for wing-man
ning. Someone's gotta jump on that
grenade.
Another oft-overlooked tip:
don't bring anything you could eas
ily drop. Roxy speaks from experi
ence here no one, especially
Roxy, wants to miss out on 15 min
utes of make-outs while searching
for a dropped phone in a crowd of

legs. It's less exciting than it sounds.
In terms of technique, a few
pecks of advice go a long way.
When it comes to tongue, the word
of the hour is "refined." Holding
back might not go hand-in-hand
with the Four Loko you chugged
earlier that night, but no one likes a
kiss after which a tongue brush is
needed. In defense of balance, how
ever, Roxy has to add that an empty
mouth with no tongue is nothing
less than disconcerting. Moderation
is sexy.
As for teeth, there's a time and
a place, and it's not here. Roxy has
been caught in the traps of "chom
pers," and the experience was both
figuratively and literally scarring.
Avoid.
The bottom line is: if someone
sucks at kissing, assess can it be
fixed with a quick tip for a more
pleasurable rendezvous? Then drop
a hint and be nice about it. If
someone literally sucks, run away.
Roxy's goals for Monday night
are simple. Show the freshmen
(and sophomores) for whom this is
the first Full Moon that kissing
randos can be all in good fun,
assuming you don't emerge from
the fray with a disease, a traumatiz
ing experience or a creepy grad
stalker. The thrill of the chase in
this night's environment is one
unlike any other so join Roxy
and suspend your judgment, close
your eyes and dive in, lips first.
