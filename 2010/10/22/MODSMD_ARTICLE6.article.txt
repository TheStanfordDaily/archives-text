## RESEARCH 'Big Oil' goes to the Farm Report spills on Stanford ties between research, oil companies 
### TYLER BROWN DESK EDITOR 
Corporate sponsors have too much control over pri
vately funded research, according to a recent report
from the Center for American Progress (CAP). The re
port, titled "Big Oil Goes to College," named the rela
tionship between Stanford's Global Climate and Ener
gy Project (GCEP) and its funders as one such offend
er.
The report evaluated multi-million-dollar, long
term funding agreements between universities and in
dustry sponsors using questions report author Jennifer
Washburn developed based on Cornell University's cri
teria for a "strategic corporate alliance" and attempted
to illustrate the extent to which the corporate funding
contracts placed control of research agreements in the
hands of university faculty.
The report criticizes GCEP's sponsor-directed Man

agement Committee for allegedly "violating longstand
ing university traditions of self-governance and aca
demic autonomy from outside funders" because it con
trols the annual budget and ultimately approves fund
ing for research projects, leaving it the theoretical
power to veto a proposal.
"Traditionally, universities have fought very valiant
ly to establish what we think of as 'academic independ
ence,'" Washburn said. "So they're not supposed to do
mere corporate research for hire."
GCEP director Sally Benson, however, said the
Management Committee has never rejected a propos
al approved by GCEP's earlier-stage peer review com
mittees, leaving no precedent for that behavior in the
future.

The private sector's support, Benson said, was a crit
ical catalyst to GCEP's founding.
"If you look at Stanford, industry support got this all
going before there was government funding for this
kind of research," she said. "My basic view is that this
has been a good thing for the University and will con
tinue to be a good thing."
GCEP is backed by $225 million given over 10 years
by energy giants ExxonMobil, General Electric and

Schlumberger as well as Toyota Motor
Co. and parcels out up to 22.5 million in
green energy research grants each year.
Report: Sponsors 'Unduly
Influence'
The CAP re
port also took issue
with GCEP's first
contract, an agree
ment that allowed in
dustry partners five years'
exclusive use of patents that
emerged from GCEP research. The stipulation
was removed from the contract when it was revised in
2008.

"What we were finding was ... other universities
wouldn't submit proposals to us because they didn't
like those [intellectual property] terms, so we went back
to the sponsors and said, 'You're missing a chance to
support research,"' Benson said.
The report isn't all negative: it gives GCEP's re
search contract good marks for being "well drafted"
and applauds the program for funding "an array of di

verse energy research areas" and reviewing "all the
faculty research proposals that it receives in each grant
cycle."

However, the report also goes on to claim "the re
search selection process is very poorly delineated" as
the"GCEP agreements provide little exposition of how
GCEP will evaluate and select which faculty research
