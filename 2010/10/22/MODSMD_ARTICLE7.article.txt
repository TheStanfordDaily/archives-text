## Campus adapts to package center Students weigh pros and cons of new center 
### DEVIN BANERJEE SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Roble Package Center, which
opened this quarter to ease the bur
den on individual residences of pro
cessing students' mail, is still ironing
out inefficiencies and adapting to stu
dents' needs. Meanwhile, Student
Housing awaits the formal permitting
and construction of the actual facility
while the system operates out of
trucks in a service lane behind Roble
Hall.

Rodger Whitney, the executive di
rector of Student Housing, said in an
e-mail to The Daily that the permit
ting and construction were delayed
because "other, more critical projects
involving spaces needed to house stu
dents were prioritized higher."
The package center processes
mail from private carriers such as
UPS and DHL. Students are instruct
ed to list the address of the Stanford
post office as well as their individual
box numbers. The post office then
sends private-carrier mail to the
package center.
But many students have had little
patience as the system finds its foot
ing.
Daniela Urigwe 'l3, who has used

Roble Package Center multiple
times, found that DHL was "not real
ly on board with the system" yet. She
says DHL did not know or was not
told about the package center, so she
had to drive to the company's San
Francisco office to retrieve her pack
age.

The most common complaint by
students has been the absence of or
delay in notification of package ar
rivals. Pablo Lopez 'l3, who received
a printer at the package center, said
he did not receive an e-mail notifying
him of the package's arrival. He
walked over to Roble, where a center
employee found his package.
"The people were friendly, but de
livering things straight out of the
back of trucks isn't really ideal,"
Lopez said.
Whitney acknowledged early
problems with packages arriving at
the correct location for pickup the
post office for packages sent via
USPS, the FedEx store in Tresidder
Union for FedEx deliveries and the
package center for packages mailed
by other private carriers but said
"educational publicity" seems to be
"smoothing out" those issues.
On a recent day at the package
center, which is open Monday
through Friday from 3 p.m. to 7 p.m.,
seven students received their pack
ages without a problem. At one
point, the package center employee,
who said she was instructed by

Housing not to talk to The Daily,
called a golf cart to deliver a stu
dent's package to Mirrielees be
cause the package was heavy and the
student was on a bike.
What all of the students inter
viewed for this article agreed upon is
that the security of packages has been

increased under the new system. In
the past, private carriers often left
packages outside of residences,
where they subsequently could be
stolen. Residence staff would also
raise eyebrows at package-delivery
staff who would enter residences and
walk the halls looking for the rooms

to which mail was addressed.
Still, both students and Housing
are adapting to the system and to the
package center itself. Whitney said he
anticipates construction of the actu
ally facility "will be completed soon."
"It's rather skeletal," Aditya Singh
'l3 said of the center."But it serves its

purpose."
"It didn't seem very well-organ
ized," Lopez said of his visit. "But I
think they're doing the best they
can."
