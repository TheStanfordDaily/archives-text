## Google to test broadband at Stanford staff homes Google, University build ultra high-speed network 
### ELLEN HUET MANAGING EDITOR 
Google announced Thursday that it
will be partnering with the University to
implement a beta test of its fiber-optic,
ultra high-speed broadband network on
approximately 850 faculty and staff
homes.
The Mountain View-based company
announced in early 2010 plans to unleash
an experimental fiber-optic network on a
community of anywhere between 50,000
and 500,000 homes, setting off a wide
spread rush from more than 1,100 com
munities around the country to become
the chosen locale.
The eventual community of choice
will be announced at the end of 2010, but
in the meantime, Google plans to exe
cute a small-scale version at Stanford to
test the project before it expands to full
size.
The mostly underground fiber-optic
network will provide residences with In
ternet speeds of up to one gigabit per sec
ond, approximately 100 times as fast as
most Internet connections today.
Google selected Stanford as a beta test
location for its "relatively small size" and

because the company headquarters are
"close to campus, so we can keep an eye
on the project," said Google spokesper
son Dan Martin. "We also liked that Stan
ford was very open to plans and experi
mentation on location."
Groundbreaking on campus is sched
uled for early 2011. The exact date when
fiber optic access will be available to resi
dents is yet to be determined.
Google will fund the entire project
with no cost to the University, Martin said.
"This project is to test things we hope
to scale up in the future," Martin said.
"The focus is not immediately on turning
a profit. It's an investment in future suc
cess."
Google and the University have a
three-year contract for the project, after
which details will be discussed as to the
network's future.
The two organizations have been in
talks for "a number of months" since
Google first approached Stanford about
the project, said University spokesperson
Lisa Lapin.
"We're treating Google just like an
other Comcast or AT&T," she said.
"They'll be doing some digging and coor
dinating work with campus utilities to in
stall the system."
"This will make Stanford one of the first
places in the country where you'd have this
kind of speed," Lapin added.
James Sweeney, management science and
engineering professor and chair of the Stanford
Campus Residential Leaseholders (SCRL)
board, also felt the potential benefit from the
state-of-the-art connections was the main at
traction of the collaboration.
"It keeps us on the absolute cutting edge of
connectivity technology," Sweeney said. "We're a
community that includes a broad range of highly
educated people, all of whom consider informa
tion flow very important."
Sweeney noted that some residences on cam
pus that will be included in the project currently
have lower-speed connections like DSL, and that
the increase in speed would greatly change the
resident's Web experiences.
"The experience of everything we do regard
ing the Internet will be enhanced," he said.
"Once you start getting this out to people at this
speed, there are going to be new applications for
this technology, and we'll be positioned to take
advantage of it."

Although Sweeney admitted "construction is
always a nuisance," he said Google intends to ex
periment with new and potentially less invasive
construction techniques, including "micro
trenching," which would dig a narrow trench less
than an inch wide and several feet deep in which
to lay the fibers.
"We anticipate that this will be less disrup

tive," he said. "But, of course, it's not an absolute
guarantee."
The faculty and staff residences included in
the project are located near Peter Coutts Road,
Stanford Avenue and Junipero Serra Boulevard,
as well as southwest of Mayfield Avenue.
