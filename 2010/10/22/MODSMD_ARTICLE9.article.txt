## Google to test broadband at Stanford staff homes Google, University build ultra high-speed network 
### ELLEN HUET MANAGING EDITOR 
Google announced Thursday that it
will be partnering with the University to
implement a beta test of its fiber-optic,
ultra high-speed broadband network on
approximately 850 faculty and staff
homes.
The Mountain View-based company
announced in early 2010 plans to unleash
an experimental fiber-optic network on a
community of anywhere between 50,000
and 500,000 homes, setting off a wide
spread rush from more than 1,100 com
munities around the country to become
the chosen locale.
The eventual community of choice
will be announced at the end of 2010, but
in the meantime, Google plans to exe
cute a small-scale version at Stanford to
test the project before it expands to full
size.
The mostly underground fiber-optic
network will provide residences with In
ternet speeds of up to one gigabit per sec
ond, approximately 100 times as fast as
most Internet connections today.
Google selected Stanford as a beta test
location for its "relatively small size" and

because the company headquarters are
"close to campus, so we can keep an eye
on the project," said Google spokesper
son Dan Martin. "We also liked that Stan
ford was very open to plans and experi
mentation on location."
Groundbreaking on campus is sched
uled for early 2011. The exact date when
fiber optic access will be available to resi
dents is yet to be determined.
Google will fund the entire project
with no cost to the University, Martin said.
"This project is to test things we hope
to scale up in the future," Martin said.
"The focus is not immediately on turning
a profit. It's an investment in future suc
cess."
Google and the University have a
three-year contract for the project, after
which details will be discussed as to the
network's future.
The two organizations have been in
talks for "a number of months" since
Google first approached Stanford about
the project, said University spokesperson
Lisa Lapin.
"We're treating Google just like an
other Comcast or AT&T," she said.
"They'll be doing some digging and coor
dinating work with campus utilities to in
stall the system."
"This will make Stanford one of the first
places in the country where you'd have this
