## EDITORIAL Keeping a watchful eye on government at all levels 
### 
Did you know the ASSU has decided
that a valuable expenditure of its en
ergy is holding press conferences
from 8:30 to 9:00 p.m. every Thursday (except
Dead Week and finals)? Until the editorial
board saw this somewhat baffling e-mail an
nouncement, neither did we. Let's put aside
for a moment that the last thing any senior will
be thinking about on a Thursday evening is
hearing from the leaders of our student gov
ernment.
Calling listening sessions "press confer
ences" is the kind of condescension that turns
individuals off to government. And, shocking
ly, prompt e-mails, phone calls and meetings
remain good, if not better, ways to reach stu
dent publications. The ASSU press confer
ence, trivial to the larger workings of our stu
dent government, says a lot about how our
elected leaders view us and what we know, or
think we know, about them.
Indeed, ASSU can come across as out of
touch, to put it mildly.
But the fact remains that student govern
ment plays a vital role in the campus commu
nity. Whether it is funding the student groups
that form the core of extracurricular life or ac
tively lobbying University officials at the be

hest of the student population, ASSU is in
volved, theoretically, in a great many aspects
of student life.
This week. The Daily editorial board will
be wrestling with topics surrounding the 2010
midterm elections, particularly contests in
California, our home for at least four years.
And as we weigh the merits of propositions
and candidates, the goal is to initiate a lively
discussion about the direction and composi
tion of government. This discourse, however,
should not only take place on the national or
state level.
For the same reasons that we pore over na
tional and state news, so too must attention be
directed toward the Association. The ASSU
(thankfully) does not control the codes to nu
clear weapons, and it cannot spend trillions of
dollars on projects. But voter apathy about
both ASSU and public officials can still pro
duce negative results in a democracy.
The election is now eight days away. Please
make sure that you read those wonderful
voter packets and vote. While doing so, spend
some time reading about the ASSU. Get in
touch with it whether in its so-called press
conferences or not. The school will be a better
place for it.
