## On Relationships 
### Cristopher Bautista 
I feel an extreme anxiety about relation
ships. And this is an understatement. Every
time I meet a cute girl and I hit it off with
her, a whole stream of questions plagues my
mind: Does she like me? Or does she just like
talking to people? Is she expecting me to do
something? Is she a lesbian? (For a mainly het
erosexual guy who hangs out in the queer
community a lot, the last question is important
perhaps the most important.) And then I
end up not doing anything because I'm too
nervous, and before I know it, once more I
have permanently landed myself in the dread
ed friend zone.

For me, my insecurity lies in the fact that I
simply haven't lived the male social experi
ence for that long. While the boys learned
how to talk to girls and the girls learned how
to talk to boys, I just stood there from the out
side looking in, watching it all play out in
front of me. But I was never allowed to try it
out myself, never allowed to enter this sexual
discourse between boys and girls. So I simply
never learned. It wasn't until two years ago
that I figured stuff out and entered this whole
dating scene. But having a bio-guy's usual 20
years of experience against my two means
that there's a lot of catching up to do.

There's this whole idea that I have to ini
tiate, that I have to take charge, that I have to
be the one asking for dates. As much as I
would like to do those things, this isn't some
thing I inherently learned as a kid. I never
grew up as a boy, so I never learned how to
act around girls as a guy. I knew how to act
around girls as me, but sometimes I feel that
acting like me isn't going to get me a date.
Being a man is still something that I've been
getting used to. From years of watching, I
would know right away if one person was hit
ting on someone else. But I'm completely
oblivious when a girl hits on me, something
that causes my friends moments of both em
barrassment and amusement.

But at the same time, I don't want to go
off and experiment and see for myself. I
don't want to make a girl regret what she did
the night before because I decided to fool
around a bit. I've had female friends who
have told me about how they felt like guys
took advantage of them at parties while
they were drunk. And I don't want to be
"that guy." I would hate myself if I did that

to someone.

There's also this extreme anxiety about
not being "manly" enough. As I wrote about
before, I'm not exactly the most masculine
guy, and I sometimes get labeled as gay be
cause of it. In fact, there are some lesbians in

the queer community who are more mascu
line than I am. I like being myself and bend
ing the gender norms ever so slightly. Howev
er, I don't think that's going to get me a girl.
Not to mention that I never think a girl would
want someone like me. I know it's kind of stu
pid, but there's a thought in the back of my
mind that I'm defective because I can't give
anyone kids or anything, and they would
have to put up with the possible crap they'd
get for having a boyfriend who's trans, espe
cially from family members. And I don't want
to do that to a girl who probably just wants a
normal life with a normal boyfriend. I under
stand that what I'm feeling is also common
with other guys, who feel awkward and inad
equate. Mine is just a different anxiety, and
one I hope resonates with a lot of other guys.
What is my view on relationships then? I
guess you could say that I'm horribly old
fashioned I'm the sort of guy who likes
asking a girl out, going on a couple dates, tak
ing it at her pace. I don't plan on having sex
with a girl until I am in a committed relation
ship with her. I feel like that's the right thing
to do. But part of me wonders if I should let
go of this whole idealistic paradigm, especial
ly in the context of this hook-up-focused col
lege environment and the fact that I'm not as
experienced as even some of my freshmen

but I wouldn't have it any other way. I'm hop
ing one day it will pay off Maybe it will, maybe
it won't. I guess we'll see.
