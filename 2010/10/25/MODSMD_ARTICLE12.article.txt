# COMPILERS, STETHOSCOPES AND HEMINGWAY
## Nerd Culture 
### Aaditya Shidham 
America has never been a very intellec
tual nation. Instead, our society began
as a beheaded version of contempo
rary Europe, lacking largely in its relative pro
portion of the educated, professional upper
class. National expansiveness has historically
led to a preference of quantity over elegance,
flair over humility and industrial practicality
over cognition. In hindsight, it makes some
sense that so few of our presidents have ever
held a Ph.D. Attaining a high level of mastery
over any academic discipline has just never
been a very "American" thing to do.
In light of these facts, it makes some sense
that the word "nerd" originated in this won
derful nation of ours. In the 19505, it first ap
peared in Dr. Seuss's "If I Ran the Zoo" and
quickly took on the notion of a bookish indi
vidual that had avid intellectual interests but
didn't pursue social/conventional activities.
He (so often "he," but not always) became the
outsider, the outcast in that society.
In some ways, the four-letter word became
a substitute in our lexicon for an intelligent
person and I am fascinated by this unique
ly American conflation of terms. When did in
telligence become equated with dullness,
bookishness, awkwardness and stuffiness as
well? How on earth did this become a package
deal? When did one's cognition something
that has defined humanity's ability to build
great civilizations, something that Eastern
faiths consider a form of divinity in itself
get the same status in American high schools
as a venereal disease?

I think to begin to look at the answer, we
must understand what was idolized by chil
dren in the last half-century. Cowboys, Barbi
es, baseball greats and movie stars all these

were in the echelon of admiration for their
courage, physical talent or their beauty. These
were all visceral, concrete qualities to admire
qualities that were plainly visible to any
layperson. You didn't need to be an actor to
recognize charm; you didn't need to be a base
ball player to recognize athleticism.
However, to even begin to understand the
nature of the achievement of the academic
celebrities of the last half-century required
some intellect. The admirer of an intellectual
hero would himself need to be smart enough
and persistent enough to be able to read a
technical document (an academic paper, a
patent, what have you), and understand the
genius behind the work to begin to truly ad
mire him. This is when alienation sets in
when the nerd's aspirations and dreams be
come unintelligible to the larger populace.
This is compounded by the un-American
notion that intelligence is a hereditary, static
trait, just like eye color and height so that
"nerds" will forever be unintelligible to the
rest of the world. The rest of American society
and media says, "I don't understand, and I
don't think I am smart enough to understand.
So I don't care to learn about the nature of
your ambition."
Then something happened. The space pro

gram emerged, and everyone was fascinated
with outer space. All of a sudden, the astro
naut joined the cowboy and the movie star as
part of the vast echelon of American heroes.
The achievement of the man on the moon it
self the technicalities of how it all worked
were all still cryptic to a general populace.
But something fundamental about the Amer
ican attitude to intellect changed the day that
Sputnik flew in the night sky. There was some
thing visceral, something real that could be the
product of such intellect and could define a
new kind of American imagination.
After space, American nerds found many
other frontiers, including information tech
nology. Integrated circuits, then the personal
computer, then the Internet, became physical
realties. In the process, Silicon Valley emerged
only a few miles from this university. Self-pro
claimed "nerds" amassed millions, then bil
lions off their creations.

Now, in a 21st-century America, the notion
of "nerd" has turned into a form of endear
ment. Since those halcyon years, nerd culture
has expanded beyond science and technology,
into theater, music, even entertainment. Tina
Fey typifies the beloved nerd of Hollywood.
We may have our first nerdy president. After
all, we're all with Coco.
All these modern nerds seem pretty damn
cool to me. So I must ask: do we even care
about the nerd anymore? Is there anything
about nerd culture that is about the under
dog? Or are we all as adorable as Coco's
flashy, orange hair? I'd like to think we are.
