Male-studies article glossed
over key factors

Dear Editor,
I am writing in response to an article print
ed Oct. 20: "John Wayne's Masculine Identity
Crisis." I do not intend to critique the concept
of male studies itself, as one of the intervie
wees, Prof. Matthew Sommer, has enumerated
the basic issues already. Instead, I will focus on
the problematic ways that the article itself was
presented.
First, the writer made the choice to portray
male studies as the antithesis, or opposite of,
feminist studies. This is a dangerous dichoto

my. "Feminist studies" is not, as is commonly
thought, merely a renaming of "women's stud
ies." It is, in fact, a field of thought that investi
gates society with intersectionality of oppres
sion and identity as guiding principles. Femi
nist studies works against historically patriar
chal, racist and generally privileging narra
tives in academe towards a more self-reflec
tive and activist body of work. There is a rea
son the department is not called "female stud
ies" namely that feminist studies includes
cisgendered men and trans individuals in its
work along with explorations of other kinds of
identity. And for another obvious point,
"male" and "feminist" are not mutually exclu
sive labels.

The article also assumes that male studies
constitutes a study of the masculine. Any
broad work on male-identified individuals
should examine masculinity and such gender
constructs, but to conflate maleness and mas
culinity is ignorant at best. Furthermore, the
writer presumes not only that maleness equals
masculinity, but that masculinity equals John
Wayne, I understand the cultural value of
John Wayne as a hyper-masculine cowboy fig
ure, but if one wants to paint an accurate pic
ture of what studies of masculinity should real
ly examine, John Wayne is an insignificant ex
ample, certainly not worthy of an article title.
IJie writer also seems to believe that male
studies is filling a hole of some sort, that men's

lives are not currently investigated in other
fields adequately. What does it mean exactly to
investigate men's issues? What exactly are
these issues? Is it that men feel constrained by
their gender roles or feel their masculinity is
constantly threatened and in need of confir
mation? This question is already under the
purview of queer studies and performance
studies. Do men of color feel the need to assert
masculinity in the face of white-normativity?
These issues are already investigated by criti
cal race studies. Do men find that they do not
have a past, traceable ancestors with whom to
identify? History texts suggest the opposite.
Certainly men should not be homogenized,
and it is for this reason that the study of men's

lives is diffuse across disciplines. I will be so
bold as to make the claim that very few experi
ence oppression on the basis of maleness
alone, but on the basis of some other identity
that interacts with that male privilege: effemi
nacy, blackness, queerness, or class status, for
example.
The article in question glossed over these
key factors in its investigation, pursuing in
stead a superficially exciting title and conflict. I
would even suggest that such ignorance of
feminist work is symptomatic of why femi
nism continues to be necessary.
