## CONFERENCE Scott announces Pac-12 divisions 
### KABIR SAWHNEY MANAGING EDITOR 
In a press conference with the media on Thursday
morning, Pac-10 Conference Commissioner Larry Scott
laid out the future structure of the conference, as it ex
pands to include Colorado and Utah beginning in the
2011-2012 academic year.
All decisions were made unanimously by the presi
dents and chancellors of the Pac-12's member schools in
meetings in San Francisco earlier this week.
"It was a thorough and rigorous process of analysis,
study, debate and consensus-building regarding the struc
ture of the new Pac-12 Conference," Scott said.
While Scott outlined numerous changes, three issues
were given special consideration the splitting of the
conference into divisions for football, the location of the
new Pac-12 championship game in football and a new rev
enue-sharing model.
The divisional split, subject to months of intense spec
ulation, was finally confirmed on Thursday as a north
south split. Stanford and California will be paired with the
Oregon and Washington schools in the North Division,
while USC, UCLA, the Arizona schools, Colorado and
Utah will comprise the South Division. Each team will
play nine conference games five against every other
team in its division, and four against teams from the oppo
site division.
However, Scott said that, despite being in different di
visions, the annual rivalry games between the four Califor
nia schools will continue. Stanford will play rivalry games
with USC and UCLA, facing both teams on an annual
basis in addition to Big Game against divisional foe Cal.
"Maintenance of the core rivalries in California is a
part of the core culture of the conference," said Michael
Crow, the president of Arizona State and the chairman of
the Pac-10 CEO group.
Stanford will also play two of the remaining four
schools in the South Division on a rotating bask
Aside from football, no other sport will have divisions.
According to Scott, the conference chose to split into divi
sions for football because of an NCAA requirement that
a conference of 12 or more schools has divisions (and
round-robin scheduling within the divisions) in order to
stage a championship game.
Scott also revealed that the Pac-12 championship
game in football will be played at the home stadium of the
divisional champion with the best record in the confer
ence, not at a neutral site (the model followed by other
major college football conferences). If both divisional
champions have identical conference records, then a
tiebreaker system will be used to determine the game's lo
cation — however, beyond the use of head-to-head re
sults as the primary determining factor, no system has yet
been formulated.
Revenue-sharing has also undergone significant
changes. The Pac-10 currently employs an appearance
based model for parceling out media revenue to mem
ber schools the teams that appear on television most
often get the greatest shares of revenue. Historically, this
arrangement has favored the southern California
schools.
However, starting in the 2012-2013 academic year, the
conference will move to equal revenue sharing, the model
employed by most other major conferences. All 12 schools
will aggregate their media rights, starting with negotiations
for a new television contract in 2012.
Scott did stipulate that USC and UCLA would receive
an additional $2 million payout apiece if total conference
revenues failed to exceed $l7O million, in order to ensure
that they "continue to see growth." However, once new
media contracts are negotiated, it's unlikely that confer
ence revenues will fall below this threshold, and it was like
ly only included to secure support from USC and UCLA
for equal revenue sharing.
While significant changes were made to football sched
uling, Scott announced more modest changes to men's
and women's basketball, the confer
ence's other revenue-generating sports.
Teams will continue to play 18-
game conference schedules. In previ
ous years, each team played a home
and-home series against every other
team in the conference, but this model
will change starting in 2011. Each
school will play a home-and-home
against its traditional rival each year
(so Stanford is guaranteed a home
and-home against Cal), additional
home-and-home series against six
teams and single games against the
other four teams. The home-and
home series and single games will ro
tate from year to year.

Unlike the Pac-10's football media
contracts, its basketball contracts are
locked in with Fox Sports over the next
two years. The annual conference
tournaments (both men's and
women's) will be held in the Staples
Center in Los Angeles in 2011 and
2012, and Scott said that decisions con
cerning changes to the basketball tour
naments and regular season would be
made in the future.
Scott also denied that the confer
ence was still actively pursuing expan

sion opportunities. Over the summer,
the Pac-10 seemed poised to expand to
a 16-team "superconference," but
after its agreements with Texas and
other schools in the Big 12 fell apart,
Scott was forced to accept a more

modest expansion, adding Colorado
from the Big 12 and Utah from the

Mountain West.
"We aimed to create a modern 12-
team conference for the long term,"
Scott said. "We are building not just a
national, but a global brand."
