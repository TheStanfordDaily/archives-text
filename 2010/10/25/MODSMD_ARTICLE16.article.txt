# VOLLEYBALL FALLS TO CAL
## 
### CAROLINE CASELLI DESK EDITOR 
Playing in front of a home crowd of
more than 4,600 people, the No. 2 Stanford
women's volleyball team fell to No. 5 Cali
fornia in four sets last Friday. Now at the
season's halfway mark, the Card (16-2,7-2
Pac-10) is second in the Pac-10 standings,
while the Golden Bears (18-1, 8-1) have
taken sole possession of first place.
Stanford won the first set 25-21, but the
Bears came back with a vengeance to take
three consecutive games from the Card,
winning those sets 25-16,25-22 and 25-16 to
take the match.
After losing the first point of the first set,
the Cardinal took an early 4-1 lead, pow
ered by a string of serves from sophomore
defensive specialist Hannah Benjamin and
aggressive blocking and attacking from jun
ior middle blocker Stephanie Browne. But
Cal quickly fought back, aided by several
Stanford missed serves and hitting errors, to
tie the game at 10-10.
The two squads continued to trade
points back and forth, with several kills
apiece from Stanford's senior setter Cas
sidy Lichtman and sophomore opposite
Hayley Spelman. The set remained in a
deadlock until the score read 20-20. Both
squads' star outside hitters, Stanford sen
ior Alix Klineman and Berkeley junior
Tarah Murrey, came alive in the final
stretch of the set, but it was ultimately five
Klineman kills that secured the set victory
for the Card, 25-21.
The second set started out evenly, with
both Lichtman and Cal setter Carli Lloyd
connecting with their hitters. The score re
mained tied at 11-11, but Berkeley posted
seven unanswered points including
three kills from Murrey to take an 18-
11 lead. Stanford attempted to come back
with two kills apiece from freshman mid
dle blocker Carly Wopat, Klineman and
Spelman, but Cal held on to the set, win
ning 25-16.
Klineman opened the third set aggres
sively with a kill and an ace, setting the
tone for the Card's strong 12-6 start. How
ever, a Stanford service error and pair of

Murrey kills helped narrow Stanford's
lead to 13-10, and a Bear ace, two more
Murrey kills and another pair of kills from
sophomore middle blocker Kat Brown
gave Cal an 18-16 lead. Powerful swings
from freshman outside hitter Rachel
Williams and Klineman tied the score at
19-19, but Murrey proved unstoppable yet
again, putting down three crucial kills.

Klineman kills kept Stanford alive for two
set-point plays, closing in on the Bears' 24-
22 lead, but Cal sophomore middle block
er Shannon Hawari put down a ball to
close the set 25-22.
Cal never trailed in the fourth set, and
the only tie was at 7-7. Despite strong offen
sive efforts from Klineman, Wopat,
Williams and Spelman, the Cal offense out-

hit the Card .455 to .235 in the fourth set,
helping the Bears pull ahead to a 19-15 lead.
Cal proceeded to win six of the final seven
points Klineman had one kill for Stan
ford and a Hawaii kill ended the match
in Berkeley's favor, 25-16.
Klineman led the match with 22 kills,
26.5 points and three aces, and she also
earned her eighth double-double of the sea
son with 10 digs. Williams added 11 kills and
seven digs, personal bests for her, and Spel
man put down 10 kills. Lichtman had 51 as
sists, eight digs and four kills, and senior
libero Gabi Ailes tallied 15 digs.
For the Bears, Murrey had 21 kills and 12
digs, and Hawari contributed 11 kills and a
.588 hitting percentage. Lloyd added 52 as
sists, seven digs and five kills, and sopho
more libero Robin Rostratter had a match
high 16 digs as well as two aces. As a team,
Cal outhit the Card .347 to .268, and the
Bears only missed two serves to Stanford's
nine service errors.
Next weekend, Stanford will head to Eu
gene, Ore., to take on Oregon on Friday, be
fore squaring off against Oregon State in
