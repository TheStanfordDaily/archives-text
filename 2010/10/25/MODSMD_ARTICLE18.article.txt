# It's a good time for Bay fans
## 
### Daniel Bohm 
What a time to be a
sports fan in the
Bay Area es
pecially at Stan
ford. In recent
years, there has been no more de
pressed sports area in the country
than the Bay Area (except, of
course, Cleveland, which is peren
nially depressed), but all of a sud
den, things are turning around.
Heck, the Raiders even scored 59
points yesterday.
Of course, this rebirth (birth?)
of sports success in the Bay begins
with the San Francisco Giants.The
Giants are headed to the World
Series who would have thunk it
back in April? Not me, for one. As
I recall, I predicted that both the
Giants and the Rangers would
miss the playoffs. Oh well. Can't
win 'em all.

Seriously, though, even if it was
with smoke and mirrors (also
known as Aubrey Huff and Pat
Burrell), the Giants have
scratched and clawed their way
within four wins of eternal glory.

How rare is this moment for
the Giants? Well, they haven't
won a World Series since 1954,
when they played at the Polo
Grounds ... in New York. To be
living here, just outside San Fran
cisco, while the team has a chance
to bring the city its first title since
Jerry Rice was catching touch
downs is pretty special. Even if
half of today's self-proclaimed Gi
ants fans couldn't have cared less
about the team six months ago, liv
ing in a newly electric environ
ment is great. People high fiving
strangers, class times changing to
accommodate the Giants games
hey, all of a sudden it's a sports
town.

And then there is Stanford
football. Saturday's win, albeit
somewhat lackluster, guaranteed
that the Cardinal will be going to a
bowl game for the second consec
utive year and it was so expect
ed that I didn't feel compelled to
write an entire column about it
like last year!
Not only is Stanford going
bowling again, but that bowl could
easily be the Rose Bowl or anoth
er BCS bowl. Who would have
thought that was possible five
years ago? Again, not me.

Unlike the Giants fans, howev
er, it's not clear who is noticing
Stanford's success. This weekend
was homecoming, but apparently
everyone at this school and all of
its alumni, outside of me and
about 14 other people, are related
to the Wicked Witch of the West
and melt in the rain.
How can this team be 6-1 and
have so few people at any game,
let alone homecoming? And these
are the fans who are supposedly
so into the game and the team that
they rushed the field after a win
just two weeks ago (but I won't get
into that in any more detail than I
already have).
When Jim Harbaugh leaves
Stanford for the University of
Michigan or some NFL team in a
few years, Stanford fans are going
to be sad and call him a traitor
but really, who could blame him?
Harbuagh has done everything in
his power to turn Stanford from a
nothing program to a BCS factor
and fans can't fill up the stadi
um on homecoming. Hell, they
can't even fill up half of the stadi
um on homecoming.
Michigan's stadium holds
more than 110,000 people
more than twice the capacity of
Stanford Stadium and is full
week in and week out, excluding
probably 110,000 other people
who didn't get tickets but wish
they did. Sure, Michigan is a larger
school so it has a larger student
population and alumni base, but I
don't buy the excuse that Stan
ford's small size is a reason it can't
fill a stadium.

I also don't buy the excuse that
Stanford was supposed to blow
out Washington State, so why
waste your time attending the
game. Guess what. USC was sup
posed to blow out Stanford in
2007, but look what happened
then. And the Cardinal didn't rout
the Cougars on Saturday. It was a
marginally close game, thanks to
some Swiss cheese secondary play
by Stanford.
Yes, that was tangential from
my original point that it is a
good time to be a sports fan
around here and it sure would be
nice if a few more fans around
here showed their support.

Daniel Bohm doesn't melt in the
rain. He bleeds Cardinal red.
