# An aging debate looms
## Stanford Roundtable hosts scholars, alumni, executives 
### ALEX YU CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Television journalist Tom Brokaw
moderated the fifth Roundtable at
Stanford on Saturday, guiding a panel
of six leaders in a talk titled, "Genera
tion Ageless: Longevity and the
Boomers."
Panelists from the Stanford faculty
included University President John
Hennessy; psychology professor and
director of the Stanford Center on
Longevity Laura Carstensen and biol
ogy professor Robert Sapolsky. Also
joining the panel were Facebook
COO Sheryl Sandberg, former
Supreme Court justice Sandra Day
O'Connor '5O L.L.B. '52 and AARP
chief executive Barry Rand.
Brokaw steered the baby boomer
discussion through topics ranging
from economics to education to
longevity. The panel agreed that the

baby boomer issues will impact all
generations, particularly because in
creasing life expectancy is transform
ing the demographic landscape.
"We've reached a historical point
where three, four, five and conceivably
six generations may be alive at the
same time," Carstensen said. "Imagine
being born into a family where you
have a complement of not only your
parents, but also your grandparents,
great-grandparents and maybe even
great-great-grandparents, all invested
in the well-being of the youngest
among them."
Sapolsky agreed with Carstensen
on the benefits of the shared experi
ences and "cumulative wisdom" of
multiple generations. Drawing from
her own family experiences, Sandberg
said, "Keeping the generations close,
remembering where you come from is
so important."
But panelists recognized that "cu

mulative wisdom" will come hand-in
hand with cross-generational burdens.
"We need to think about this prob
lem as a multigenerational problem,"
Hennessy said. "We need to engage
young people thinking about it be
cause it's going to be their parents. It's
eventually going to be a financial bur
den on them."
O'Connor, whose husband suf
fered from Alzheimer's disease before
dying, stressed the burden that baby
boomers will soon put on the health
care system.
"After 80, one in two people have
Alzheimer's, so I have a pretty good
chance myself of contracting it," said
O'Connor, 80. "That is a lot of people."
O'Connor exhorted audience
members to work toward finding
means of palliating diseases associat
ed with age.
"In this nation, when we faced
problems with polio, tuberculosis, we

got together as a nation and attacked
it on a broad scale and got the solu
tion," O'Connor said. "We have not
done that for Alzheimer's, and we
must. We really must."
In addition to Alzheimer's, the pan
elists recognized that the health care
system will face other issues as well.
"Obesity is the new smoking,"
Hennessy said. "It will present us with
a budget just as big 30 years from now
if we don't solve it."

Whereas Hennessy and O'Connor
cautioned the audience on specific
health issues, Sapolsky characterized
modern health dilemmas as bewilder
ingly novel.
"What this centers around is the to
tally bizarre diseases we deal with
these days," Sapolsky said. "None of us
worry about cholera. There's hardly
any vaccine on the horizon that will
have a serious impact on our health."
In the end, the panelists produced a

laundry list of problems related to the
longevity of the baby boomers, but they
agreed that, to be forward-looking, so
lutions are necessary. Carstensen sug
gested a wholesale change of American
views of longevity.

"We've added 30 years [to life ex
pectancies], and we've tacked them all
onto the end.The only stage in life that
has gotten longer is old age,"

Former Supreme Court justice Sandra Day O'Connor, a Stanford graduate, spoke
on Saturday at a panel on aging. "In this nation, when we faced problems with polio,
tuberculosis, we got together as a nation and attacked it on a broad scale and got
the solution," O'Connor said. "We have not done that for Alzheimer's, and we must."
Carstensen said. "Let's put some of
those years earlier in life. Let's
stretch out adolescence a little fur
ther, and let's stretch out young
adulthood a little further. We don't
have to do everything all at once."
Hennessy recapitulated the need
to deal with health issues by suggest
ing increased funding for chronic dis
eases.
"We need to focus on search on
the chronic long-term diseases that
we didn't get to worry about because
we died of something else much ear
lier," Hennessy said.
O'Connor reminded the audience
that a discussion is meaningless with
out action, urging: "Let's get down to
practicality."
