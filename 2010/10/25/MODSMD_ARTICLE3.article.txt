## 'Blackout in a can' sparks concerns At Stanford, admins urge students to be cautious 
### BRENDAN O'BYRNE 
Ramapo College in New Jersey banned
Four Loko, an energy drink laced with alco
hol, early this month after school officials
linked the so-called "blackout in a can" to
23 hospitalizations. Although college ad
ministrators, attorneys general and the
FDA have begun investigations to evaluate
the safety of drinks like Four Loko, Stan
ford sees no need for immediate action on
campus.
"If it becomes an issue where we were
seeing problems arise, we'd look into it,"
said Ralph Castro, Alcohol and Drug Edu
cator at Vaden Health Center, "but at this
point, we haven't seen or heard anything
related to that."
Currently, Stanford has no rules banning
or restricting the mixing of alcohol and caf
feinated beverages, and that is likely to re
main true. Castro said he sees measures
banning the drink as the most effective, but
rather prefers to offer comprehensive edu
cation.
"It's easier to give people the skills not
to over-drink." he noted. "We can tell them,
'Don't drink one thing,' but it's really,
'Don't over-drink anything.'"
But that is not to say that the health haz
ards of mixing alcohol and caffeine have
gone unnoticed.
Produced by Drink Four Brewing Com
pany, Four Loko is marketed as a "premium
caffeinated alcohol beverage." According
to its website, the drink was created by
three students from Ohio State who, after
seeing the popularity of mixing drinks like
Red Bull and Vodka, decided to create their
own alcoholic energy-drink.
Sold in a brightly colored, 23.5 ounce
serving, one can of Four Loko contains as
much alcohol as up to four beers along with
caffeine, taurine and guarana. Its fruity
taste and relative cheapness, averaging $2
to $3 per can, makes it especially popular
among young drinkers. Introduced in 2005,
its success has drawn notice and occasional
ire from health advocates and government
organizations.
In fact, a study from November 2009 by
professors at the University of Florida con
cluded that a person who consumes energy
drinks and alcohol is four times as
likely to attempt to drive than a per
son who simply consumes alcohol,
and a 2008 study from Wake Forest
University had similar results, find
ing students who consumed alco
holic energy drinks were more like
ly to receive an alcohol-related in
jury than someone who consumed
solely alcohol.
While the FDA sent a letter to
the manufacturers of alcoholic ener
gy drinks in November 2009, giving
them 30 days to prove the safety of
the drinks, no further action was
taken against the companies or their
products, according to the Los An
geles Times.
But the California Attorney
General's office continues investi
gations on the marketing strategies
of companies that distribute bever
ages like Four Loko, stating in 2008
that "research has shown [these
drinks] are particularly appealing to
underage drinkers."
