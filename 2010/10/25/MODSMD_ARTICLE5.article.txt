## Students to pucker up for Full Moon tonight 
### LAUREN WILSON DESK EDITOR 
Full Moon on the Quad, Stanford's fa
mous kissing tradition, was axed last year
because of worries about swine flu, or the
FIINI virus. But the event, which the
sophomore class cabinet hosts, is making a
comeback.
With two classes facing the event for
the first time, the stakes are higher than
usual, but sophomore class president
Steven Greitzer sees the situation as an
opportunity for a fresh start.
"One of our big goals for this year was
to bring back the classiness of the
night,"Greitzer said. "Back in the begin

ning of the early Full Moon tradition, the
event was actually a very classy and legiti
mate event."
The tradition dates back to the late
1800s, when senior men and freshman
women would queue up in opposing lines
to share a kiss and a rose under the first
full moon of the year. The rite of passage
evolved over the years into a less-struc
tured event where a crowd gathers
around midnight to see performances,
crowd-watch and, for some, make out with
one or many fellow attendees.
Greitzer recognized that the event's
demure origins wouldn't suit the current
Stanford culture but said the sophomore
cabinet is taking steps to at least bring a

sense of structure to Full Moon. One of
those steps is splitting the event in two
first with a big concert from popular
mash-up DJs Super Mash Bros in Old
Union, then a shift to the Quad for the
main affair.

"In past years, it's just been a kind of
chaotic make-out session, but what we've
been trying to do with the Super Mash
Bros concert and the very structured night
is to kind of bring back the legitimacy of
the night and make it more organized
chaos," Greitzer said.
