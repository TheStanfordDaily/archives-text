## Students to pucker up for Full Moon tonight 
### LAUREN WILSON DESK EDITOR 
Full Moon on the Quad, Stanford's fa
mous kissing tradition, was axed last year
because of worries about swine flu, or the
FIINI virus. But the event, which the
sophomore class cabinet hosts, is making a
comeback.
With two classes facing the event for
the first time, the stakes are higher than
usual, but sophomore class president
Steven Greitzer sees the situation as an
opportunity for a fresh start.
"One of our big goals for this year was
to bring back the classiness of the
night,"Greitzer said. "Back in the begin

ning of the early Full Moon tradition, the
event was actually a very classy and legiti
mate event."
The tradition dates back to the late
1800s, when senior men and freshman
women would queue up in opposing lines
to share a kiss and a rose under the first
full moon of the year. The rite of passage
evolved over the years into a less-struc
tured event where a crowd gathers
around midnight to see performances,
crowd-watch and, for some, make out with
one or many fellow attendees.
Greitzer recognized that the event's
demure origins wouldn't suit the current
Stanford culture but said the sophomore
cabinet is taking steps to at least bring a

sense of structure to Full Moon. One of
those steps is splitting the event in two
first with a big concert from popular
mash-up DJs Super Mash Bros in Old
Union, then a shift to the Quad for the
main affair.

"In past years, it's just been a kind of
chaotic make-out session, but what we've
been trying to do with the Super Mash
Bros concert and the very structured night
is to kind of bring back the legitimacy of
the night and make it more organized
chaos," Greitzer said.
Despite reduced funding due to recent

budget cuts, Greitzer insists the cab
inet has been able to do more than
what has been done in the past by
spending carefully. By splitting the
cost with the Stanford Concert Net
work, organizers could bring a big
ger headliner like Super Mash Bros
instead of the usual small student
band.

Along with the customary
mouthwash, mints and refreshments,
roses will also be provided a
throwback to Full Moon's origins. In
an effort to regulate the safety of
Full Moon, the sophomore cabinet
enlisted 50 "sober monitors" as well
as administrators and the Depart
ment of Public Safety to provide se
curity. All entrances to the Quad will
be carefully regulated and students

are required to show a Stanford ID
to enter, organizers said.
Another sophomore class presi
dent, Maxine Litre, emphasized the
no-camera rule, citing a need for
"mutual respect for each other in the
Quad." Greitzer and Litre also boast
a few more surprises that will most
likely occur between 11 p.m. and
midnight but remained mum on the
details.

"We have a couple surprises for
the night that will bring back a little
of the class," Greitzer said.
As for health precautions, Gre
itzer said he wasn't going to worry
too much without the fear of swine
flu.

"We're definitely taking as many
precautionary measures to ensure
the safety and well-being of every
one at the event," Greitzer said. "We
will have a health and wellness area
set up. We'll also have our sober
monitors ready to go to help anyone
out in need."

Sophomore cabinet teamed up
with other student organizations to
put on the event. One such group is
the Stanford Sexual Health Peer Re
source Center. SHPRC will have a
table in the Quad with condoms, dil
dos, trivia and other supplies to raise
sexual-health awareness.
"My hope is that if someone
meets a special someone at Full
Moon that they would be able to
come to us for resources and be safe
during that," said SHPRC co-direc
tor Ellie Green 'll.
