# CARD CONQUERS
## 
### KABIR SAWHNEY MANAGING EDITOR 
Following nearly a decade of fu
tility, Stanford's football team is
bowl-eligible for the second consec
utive year after defeating Washing
ton State 38-28 on Saturday after
noon at Stanford Stadium. The No.
12 Cardinal improves to 6-1 on the
season and 3-1 in the Pac-10, while

the Cougars fall to 1-7 overall and 0-
5 in conference play.
The 6-1 start is Stanford's best
record through seven games in 40
years.
While the game ended in a victo
ry for Stanford, the result was some
what disappointing for the Cardi
nal. Washington State entered Sat
urday's game as the conference's
unquestioned cellar-dweller, having

lost four straight conference games.
Its only victory this season came on
a last-second drive against Montana
State, an FCS team. The Card was
expected to blow out the Cougars
with ease, but Washington State re
fused to cave late in the game and
kept it close to the final whistle.
"We knew it was going to be a
fight," said Stanford head coach Jim
Harbaugh. "This was a good foot-

FOOTBALL

ball team we played. We did more
things right than they did, and we
won the ball game."
Coming off its bye week, Stan
ford seemed sluggish and rusty on
its opening drives. After an early
interception by senior linebacker
Owen Marecic gave the Card the
ball on the WSU seven-yard line
for its opening drive, Stanford
only managed to muster five
yards, settling for a field goal de
spite its starting field position. The
Cardinal rushing attack looked es
pecially weak, as the Cougar front
seven routinely stuffed sopho
more running back Stepfan Tay
lor.
Despite scoring a touchdown on
its next drive, Stanford still didn't
look terribly sharp against a Wash
ington State defense ranked among
the worst in the nation in numerous
statistical categories.

Freshman running back Anthony Wilkerson carries the ball against Washington during Saturday's game. Though sluggish
during the first half, the Cardinal beat the Cougars 38-28, securing its best record, 6-1, through seven games in 40 years.

"It was a little disappointing," said
redshirt sophomore quarterback An
drew Luck. "We were a little sluggish...
it didn't feel like we ever got in a rhythm.
Washington State deserves credit. They
did a good job of putting us in tough sit
uations."
Stanford's defense, on the other hand,
played well early in the game. The much
maligned unit forced the Cougars into
turnovers and punts on their first three
possessions and only gave up one touch
down through the first three quarters.
However, much of that success came
courtesy of a strong run defense that
dominated the line of scrimmage all af
ternoon. Sophomore quarterback Jeff
Tuel, the WSU starter, had a strong day
against a Stanford secondary that sorely
missed junior safety Delano Howell,
who was out with an undisclosed injury.
Tuel ended the day with an impressive
stat line 21-28 passing for 298 yards,
four touchdowns and two interceptions.
"He's a really composed, poised
quarterback who made a lot of accurate
throws in the ball game," Harbaugh said
of Tuel. "He's an impressive quarter
back."
Three of those touchdowns came on
Washington State's last three drives of
the game, as the Cougars attempted to
mount a late comeback as the game
wound down in the fourth quarter. The
final frame began with Stanford leading
31-7, but the final score of 38-28 felt a lit
tle too close for comfort.
Defensive lapses especially hurt
Stanford toward the end of the quarter,
as Washington State receivers found
and exploited gaps in the Stanford sec
ondary. A desperation pass by Tuel

found receiver Marquess Wilson for a
74-yard touchdown as time wound
down in the fourth quarter, but it was too
little and too late to prevent the Cougars
from taking their seventh loss of the sea
son.
After the game, Harbaugh expressed
his unhappiness at the defensive lapses
in the fourth quarter, many of which
happened after he had removed his
starters from the game,
"We're playing with young freshman
safeties in there, and they have to step
up. There are no excuses," he said. "You
have to make the play and at least do
what you're supposed to be doing."
"We came ready to play there
were just mental lapses," said sophomore
linebacker Shayne Skov. "We made a
couple of mistakes. We had a lot of oppor
tunities, especially in that fourth quarter,
but we just let them slip by."
While Stanford's defense faltered
late in the game, its offense continued to
show why it's considered one of the best
units in the country, even after its listless
first-quarter performance. As the Cardi
nal amassed a decent lead, it went to an
effective strategy of short passes and
runs up the middle to eat time off the
clock and keep Tuel off the field.
Luck had yet another strong day
under center, going 20-28 for 190 yards,
three touchdowns and an interception.
However, he still felt that the Cardinal
should have done better given the cal
iber of its opponent.
"We just didn't play up to our stan
dards," he said. "That's what it boils
down to."
Luck's receiving corps played strong
ly, though it is still hamstrung by injuries

to key players. Junior wide receiver
Chris Owusu, who appeared fully recov
ered from a knee injury that had kept
him out of Stanford's early schedule, did
not play against the Cougars and will
likely take some more time to recover
before returning to full health. Senior re
ceiver Ryan Whalen, who has recently
been limited by an elbow injury, came
back strong, catching six passes for 71
yards and a touchdown.
The running attack, led by Taylor,
also picked up considerably after falling
flat on Stanford's early drives.Taylor fin
ished with one of the best days of his
Stanford career, running the ball 27
times for 142 yards and two touchdowns.
True freshman Anthony Wilkerson
added 55 yards on nine carries.
The game was played in front of a
half-empty Stanford Stadium as the
chilly, rainy conditions drove many fans
away as the game wore on. Even the stu
dent section was nowhere close to ca
pacity.

Stanford's win has bowl implications
for both teams. With six wins, the Cardi
nal is now bowl-eligible for the second
consecutive year, while the Cougars
were officially eliminated from earning
a bowl berth.

While Washington State is left to look
forward to next season, Stanford isn't
satisfied with merely earning bowl eligi
bility. The Cardinal still has a daunting
Pac-10 slate ahead, starting next week
end at Washington. The Huskies have
had an inconsistent season, beating USC
and Oregon State while losing to Ari
zona State in Pac-10 play, and will pro
vide a significant challenge to the Card.
"Coach Harbaugh has set a standard
here, and that standard certainly isn't
just being bowl-eligible," Luck said.

utive year after defeating Washing
ton State 38-28 on Saturday after
noon at Stanford Stadium. The No.
12 Cardinal improves to 6-1 on the
season and 3-1 in the Pac-10, while

the Cougars fall to 1-7 overall and 0-
5 in conference play.
The 6-1 start is Stanford's best
record through seven games in 40
years.
While the game ended in a victo
ry for Stanford, the result was some
what disappointing for the Cardi
nal. Washington State entered Sat
urday's game as the conference's
unquestioned cellar-dweller, having

lost four straight conference games.
Its only victory this season came on
a last-second drive against Montana
State, an FCS team. The Card was
expected to blow out the Cougars
with ease, but Washington State re
fused to cave late in the game and
kept it close to the final whistle.
"We knew it was going to be a
fight," said Stanford head coach Jim
Harbaugh. "This was a good foot-

FOOTBALL

ball team we played. We did more
things right than they did, and we
won the ball game."
Coming off its bye week, Stan
ford seemed sluggish and rusty on
its opening drives. After an early
interception by senior linebacker
Owen Marecic gave the Card the
ball on the WSU seven-yard line
for its opening drive, Stanford
only managed to muster five
yards, settling for a field goal de
spite its starting field position. The
Cardinal rushing attack looked es
pecially weak, as the Cougar front
seven routinely stuffed sopho
more running back Stepfan Tay
lor.
Despite scoring a touchdown on
its next drive, Stanford still didn't
look terribly sharp against a Wash
ington State defense ranked among
the worst in the nation in numerous
statistical categories.

Freshman running back Anthony Wilkerson carries the ball against Washington during Saturday's game. Though sluggish
during the first half, the Cardinal beat the Cougars 38-28, securing its best record, 6-1, through seven games in 40 years.

"It was a little disappointing," said
redshirt sophomore quarterback An
drew Luck. "We were a little sluggish...
it didn't feel like we ever got in a rhythm.
Washington State deserves credit. They
did a good job of putting us in tough sit
uations."
Stanford's defense, on the other hand,
played well early in the game. The much
maligned unit forced the Cougars into
turnovers and punts on their first three
possessions and only gave up one touch
down through the first three quarters.
However, much of that success came
courtesy of a strong run defense that
dominated the line of scrimmage all af
ternoon. Sophomore quarterback Jeff
Tuel, the WSU starter, had a strong day
against a Stanford secondary that sorely
missed junior safety Delano Howell,
who was out with an undisclosed injury.
Tuel ended the day with an impressive
stat line 21-28 passing for 298 yards,
four touchdowns and two interceptions.
"He's a really composed, poised
quarterback who made a lot of accurate
throws in the ball game," Harbaugh said
of Tuel. "He's an impressive quarter
back."
Three of those touchdowns came on
Washington State's last three drives of
the game, as the Cougars attempted to
mount a late comeback as the game
wound down in the fourth quarter. The
final frame began with Stanford leading
31-7, but the final score of 38-28 felt a lit
tle too close for comfort.
Defensive lapses especially hurt
Stanford toward the end of the quarter,
as Washington State receivers found
and exploited gaps in the Stanford sec
ondary. A desperation pass by Tuel

found receiver Marquess Wilson for a
74-yard touchdown as time wound
down in the fourth quarter, but it was too
little and too late to prevent the Cougars
from taking their seventh loss of the sea
son.
After the game, Harbaugh expressed
his unhappiness at the defensive lapses
in the fourth quarter, many of which
happened after he had removed his
starters from the game,
"We're playing with young freshman
safeties in there, and they have to step
up. There are no excuses," he said. "You
have to make the play and at least do
what you're supposed to be doing."
"We came ready to play there
were just mental lapses," said sophomore
linebacker Shayne Skov. "We made a
couple of mistakes. We had a lot of oppor
tunities, especially in that fourth quarter,
but we just let them slip by."
While Stanford's defense faltered
late in the game, its offense continued to
show why it's considered one of the best
units in the country, even after its listless
first-quarter performance. As the Cardi
nal amassed a decent lead, it went to an
effective strategy of short passes and
runs up the middle to eat time off the
clock and keep Tuel off the field.
Luck had yet another strong day
under center, going 20-28 for 190 yards,
three touchdowns and an interception.
However, he still felt that the Cardinal
should have done better given the cal
iber of its opponent.
"We just didn't play up to our stan
dards," he said. "That's what it boils
down to."
Luck's receiving corps played strong
ly, though it is still hamstrung by injuries

to key players. Junior wide receiver
Chris Owusu, who appeared fully recov
ered from a knee injury that had kept
him out of Stanford's early schedule, did
not play against the Cougars and will
likely take some more time to recover
before returning to full health. Senior re
ceiver Ryan Whalen, who has recently
been limited by an elbow injury, came
back strong, catching six passes for 71
yards and a touchdown.
The running attack, led by Taylor,
also picked up considerably after falling
flat on Stanford's early drives.Taylor fin
ished with one of the best days of his
Stanford career, running the ball 27
times for 142 yards and two touchdowns.
True freshman Anthony Wilkerson
added 55 yards on nine carries.
The game was played in front of a
half-empty Stanford Stadium as the
chilly, rainy conditions drove many fans
away as the game wore on. Even the stu
dent section was nowhere close to ca
pacity.

Stanford's win has bowl implications
for both teams. With six wins, the Cardi
nal is now bowl-eligible for the second
consecutive year, while the Cougars
were officially eliminated from earning
a bowl berth.

While Washington State is left to look
forward to next season, Stanford isn't
satisfied with merely earning bowl eligi
bility. The Cardinal still has a daunting
Pac-10 slate ahead, starting next week
end at Washington. The Huskies have
had an inconsistent season, beating USC
and Oregon State while losing to Ari
zona State in Pac-10 play, and will pro
vide a significant challenge to the Card.
"Coach Harbaugh has set a standard
here, and that standard certainly isn't
just being bowl-eligible," Luck said.
