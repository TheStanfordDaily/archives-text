# CARD CONQUERS

### KABIR SAWHNEY MANAGING EDITOR 
Following nearly a decade of fu
tility, Stanford's football team is
bowl-eligible for the second consec
utive year after defeating Washing
ton State 38-28 on Saturday after
noon at Stanford Stadium. The No.
12 Cardinal improves to 6-1 on the
season and 3-1 in the Pac-10, while

the Cougars fall to 1-7 overall and 0-
5 in conference play.
The 6-1 start is Stanford's best
record through seven games in 40
years.
While the game ended in a victo
ry for Stanford, the result was some
what disappointing for the Cardi
nal. Washington State entered Sat
urday's game as the conference's
unquestioned cellar-dweller, having

lost four straight conference games.
Its only victory this season came on
a last-second drive against Montana
State, an FCS team. The Card was
expected to blow out the Cougars
with ease, but Washington State re
fused to cave late in the game and
kept it close to the final whistle.
"We knew it was going to be a
fight," said Stanford head coach Jim
Harbaugh. "This was a good foot-

FOOTBALL

ball team we played. We did more
things right than they did, and we
won the ball game."
Coming off its bye week, Stan
ford seemed sluggish and rusty on
its opening drives. After an early
interception by senior linebacker
Owen Marecic gave the Card the
ball on the WSU seven-yard line
for its opening drive, Stanford
only managed to muster five
yards, settling for a field goal de
spite its starting field position. The
Cardinal rushing attack looked es
pecially weak, as the Cougar front
seven routinely stuffed sopho
more running back Stepfan Tay
lor.
Despite scoring a touchdown on
its next drive, Stanford still didn't
look terribly sharp against a Wash
ington State defense ranked among
the worst in the nation in numerous
statistical categories.
