## Researchers shine light on willpower Psych scholars studied Stanford students 
### SU PARK 
You're writing a paper on your lap
top, but before you know it, you're
browsing Facebook. You promise your
self that you'll stick to a healthy eating
and exercising regime, but you end up
eating a bag of candy as you watch a
movie. This lack of control, Stanford re
searchers say, may all depend on your
point of view.
In a study this fall in Psychological
Science, Stanford researchers found
that people who believe they have a
limited source of willpower display a
lower ability to exercise self-control
than those people who believe their
willpower is unlimited. The researchers
believe the implications of these find
ings extend beyond just study habits
and into therapy developments for drug
rehabilitation facilities, diabetics and
healthy eating and exercising regimes.
"The popular and influential theory
in psychology was that willpower is very
limited," said psychology professor
Carol Dweck, one of the study authors.
"But what we found was that willpower
gets depleted only if you believe it
does."
The previous ego-depletion theory
suggested that willpower was a biologi
cally restrained resource. Here's how it
went: as people work on strenuous
tasks, whether studying, working or
cleaning, they use their psychological
resource. When they do not have any
more willpower left to do subsequent
things that is, once they deplete their
resource they need to "take a break"

until this resource is replenished.
"It's a very bottom-up theory," said
psychology professor and study author
Greg Walton. "It's a theory about basic
thought being physiologically based."
Through a series of four experi
ments, the researchers found that this
conventional bottom-up theory was in
need of revision.
In one of the experiments, the re
searchers found that subjects who said
they believed that their willpower was
unlimited performed better on the sec
ond task after they had worked
through a strenuous first task than
those who believed their willpower
was limited.
"People's theories affect their be
haviors," Walton said. "So here, the hy
pothesis, then, is that this research...

might really be operating perhaps as a
function of people's theories about this
resource."
The researchers then tested the top
down theory on Stanford students over
the course of a quarter and found how
students' personal theories about
willpower affected their tendency to
procrastinate.
"First, we measured what theory
they believed in," Dweck said. "At the
beginning and the middle of the quar
ter, the two groups didn't look so dif
ferent, but around finals time, when
your demands on self-control are so
high, the people who believed the lim
ited theory started looking bad. They
were procrastinating or going on
Facebook when they should've been
studying."

The researchers believe
that the difference in people's
conceptions of willpower lies
in how they interpret the '
feeling of fatigue that in- /
evitably comes with some '
amount of strenuous /
work. â€”6
"If you think *
willpower is limited, , \ . ,
that fatigue is a sig- \ >
nal to take a break," '
Dweck said. "But
what we found for the peo
ple who believed willpower
was unlimited was that the
fatigue meant nothing to
them. It didn't say, 'Stop
studying.' The fatigue was irrelevant."
Despite the findings implying that

we do not need breaks,
changing people's per
sonal theories may be a
difficult task.
"It's unrealistic to
tell students they don't
eed breaks because they
link that they do," said
Adina Glickman,
director
/ for academic sup
/ port at the Center
yl for Teaching and
Learning. "A break is
a reward, and it's a
reward system, but I
think it would be
reasonable to tell
students that the possibility exists that
breaks are not necessary and that they

have more control over what they do
with the trajectory of their study."
Dweck went on to clarify that the
findings do not refute the necessity of
all breaks but rather the repetitive
breaks that disrupt one's ability to be
efficient.

"We're not talking about people
working for 10 hours," Dweck said.
"Yes, you do need a break you
can't work night and day. The people
who feel their willpower is not limited
are not saying they never need a break
or they never need a snack, but the
people who think it's limited were
showing deficits after a 10-minute
task."
