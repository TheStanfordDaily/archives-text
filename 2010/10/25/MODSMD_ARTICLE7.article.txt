You're writing a paper on your lap
top, but before you know it, you're
browsing Facebook. You promise your
self that you'll stick to a healthy eating
and exercising regime, but you end up
eating a bag of candy as you watch a
movie. This lack of control, Stanford re
searchers say, may all depend on your
point of view.
In a study this fall in Psychological
Science, Stanford researchers found

limited source of willpower display a
lower ability to exercise self-control

willpower is unlimited. The researchers
believe the implications of these find
ings extend beyond just study habits
and into therapy developments for drug
rehabilitation facilities, diabetics and
healthy eating and exercising regimes.
"The popular and influential theory
in psychology was that willpower is very
limited," said psychology professor
