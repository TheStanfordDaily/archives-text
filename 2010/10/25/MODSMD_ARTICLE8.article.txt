## Center for Teaching and Learning turns 35 Now serves more than 5,000 students a year 
### KATHERINE NABEL 
With its 35th anniversary around
the corner, the Center for Teaching
and Learning is gearing up to cele
brate its work at Stanford.

Established in 1975 through a grant
from the Danforth Foundation, the
Center for Teaching and Learning
(CTL) prides itself on carrying out
four main objectives: faculty develop
ment, teaching assistant (TA) training,
student learning and oral communica
tion education. CTL's purpose is "to
promote excellence in teaching at all
ranks and excellence in student learn
ing inside and outside the classroom,"
according to its website.
To kick off its 35th anniversary,
CTL is planning a reception to honor
award-winning faculty and celebrate

the program's success on Nov. 9. Vice
Provost for Undergraduate Educa
tion Harry Elam will deliver a lecture,
"Is the Lecture Dead?: The Large Lec
ture Course in the Humanities Today."
Preceding Elam's talk will be a
presentation by the winner of a stu
dent speech contest, who will discuss a
significant learning experience with a
teacher. Open to undergraduates and
graduate students, the contest asked
participants to submit their speeches
to a special committee in October.
Later this week, the committee will
choose several finalists to give their
speeches in person in order to decide
the winner.
"We wanted this celebration to be
a thank-you to the faculty who have
worked so hard on teaching and to
donors who have contributed to un
dergraduate education," said CTL di
rector Michele Marincovich. "We are
also extremely grateful to students
who have used the public speaking
and tutoring services."
Every year, CTL provides a wide

range of services to the community, in
cluding teaching consultations, early
career faculty assistance, classroom
observations, departmental support,
teaching assistant (TA) training,
course website development, teaching
portfolios, quarterly TA orientations,
mid-quarter and end-quarter student
evaluations, tutoring and learning
skills assessments and coaching. The
center also publishes teaching hand
books and newsletters and hosts a va
riety of conferences and speakers on
teaching.
"I think the Stanford faculty take
teaching incredibly seriously, and they
really do care about giving students a
good learning experience," Marin
covich said. "The reason we are here
35 years later is because the faculty has
been eager, interested and responsive
to very helpful information about
what students need."
In addition to its resources for fac
ulty, the center prides itself on its aca
demic support for students. The CTL
Peer Tutoring Program offers stu-

dents tutors for departments such as
biology, physics, psychology and
more. Residential tutors in a variety
of subjects are strategically placed
throughout campus so all students are
close to tutors, particularly freshmen
and sophomores. Students can also
take advantage of appointment
based tutoring in various locations on
the Farm. CTL offers academic
coaching to help students ease into
the transition from high school to uni
versity, focusing on skills such as read
ing comprehension, problem-solving
approaches and test preparation, as
well as avoiding test anxiety and pro
crastination.

One unique aspect of the center is
its Oral Communications Program,
which offers graduate and undergrad
uate students a variety of opportuni
ties for development in public speak

ing. The program works with students
to provide feedback and support on
oral presentations. The program helps
students prepare for job interviews
outside the classroom and speaking
projects inside the classroom, utilizing
video recording to give feedback on
delivery and structure, and serves ap
proximately 5,000 students a year.
"For me, it is extremely rewarding
to see people improve as quickly as
they do just with a few tips," said doc
toral student Corrie Potter, an oral
communication tutor. "When doctoral
students are going on the job market,
we can provide really good feedback
on their job talks. And it's free. Not
many universities have that kind of
support."
