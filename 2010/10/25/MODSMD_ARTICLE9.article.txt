Many students stayed in touch long
after they graduated. In the words of
one of them, "You were the first
teacher to open the wider world of
ideas to me." When Georgetown Uni

most influential high school teacher,
they chose Hendry; in 1979, she was
awarded the degree of Doctor of Hu

teachers in the country to be so recog
