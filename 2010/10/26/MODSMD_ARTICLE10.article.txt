## CONTINUED Waning Acceptability 
### Jade Wang 
This week, I write to you a preoccupied
woman. For some time now, I have been
contemplating a decision that seems to
hold surprising bearing on the way I see myself
as a person. Should I, as a co-term, attend Full
Moon on the Quad?

Before you judge me too harshly, let me ex
plain myself as best I can by going through my
history of full moons in October. My freshman
year, I was herded to the Quad along with the
rest of my dorm and spent a few hours wander
ing around with my eyes big as dinner plates.
Needless to say, between the shocked staring
and shy hiding, I experienced minimal making
out that first year. The next full moon is a little
bit more difficult for me to remember; I'll say
that I probably overcompensated for the pre
vious year and leave my description at that. Ju
nior year, carefully considering my two confus
ing and unfulfilling experiences, I opted out en
tirely and spent the evening in my pajamas in
my room. Last year, my senior year, I decided
months in advance that it was going to be my
year, my opportunity to kiss tons of freshmen,
on my terms. I gave myself regular internal pep
talks, assuring myself of my more-or-less aver
age sex appeal and my status as an empowered
feminist. Being prone to overanalyzing and
awkwardness, building up the self-confidence
necessary to be ready to throw myself into the
Quad to be a make-out-machine was no easy
task for me. When the time neared, to further
lock myself into my commitment, I announced
to whomever would listen my plans to go initi
ate some freshmen, assertions of, "I do what I
want!" sprinkled throughout.
My distress was nontrivial when I heard
that Full Moon on the Quad might be canceled
due to swine flu complications. With my prepa
ration already mostly complete, the sudden in
ability to achieve my goal upset me and possi
bly drove logic out of my mind, and I wildly
claimed that I would hold the event in my
room come one, come all. When I became
symptomatic of swine flu and started sporting
a surgical mask, the reality of the situation fi
nally took hold, and I surrendered my senior

year Full Moon on the Quad to another night
spent in my room, this time quarantined.
I feel like I deserve my senior year Full
Moon on the Quad, and if it has to be delayed
one more year, I can just consider myself lucky
that I am still a student and still in the area. The
visceral refusal to truly become a "sketchy
grad student" is strong, however, and makes
me hesitant to attend. Should I leave the
evening's bacchanalia to those who have not
yet walked the Wacky Walk? Perhaps I should,
but a belligerent voice in my head shrieks, "We
were robbed!" whenever I try to cancel my full
moon plans. I am, perhaps, redefining spoiled
entitlement; it seems that I truly believe in my
right to kiss fresh-faced 18 year olds under the
guise of tradition.
As I am writing, it looks like I will be in at
tendance, and by the time this reaches other
eyes, my decision will have been made. Last
week, I wrote a schematic for Freshman Bingo,
with tiers of point categories based on difficul
ty, though whether I will be brave enough to
play remains up for some serious internal de
bate. I've been listening to my lady empower
ment playlist on repeat, looking for inspira
tion, and I have carefully crafted my "No!" list
to avoid the worst ramifications.

Is this a time for me to use my second
chance and assert my right to creep on some
freshman? Or am I relegated to the helmet
wearing ranks of my peers? My lingering in
ability to make good choices makes me hope
that it is the former.
