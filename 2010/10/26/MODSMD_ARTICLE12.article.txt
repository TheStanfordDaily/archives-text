# GIRL YOU KNOW IT'S TRUE
## Juan Gone: The End of Juan Williams' Reign of Terror at NPR 
### Jordan Carr 
NPR'S Juan Williams was fired last week,
in large part because on Bill O'Reilly's
show on Fox News, he said this:

"But when I get on the plane, I got to tell
you, if I see people who are in Muslim garb and
I think, you know, they are identifying them
selves first and foremost as Muslims, I get wor
ried. I get nervous."
Later, Williams defended his comments:
"Yesterday NPR fired me for telling the
truth. The truth is that I worry when I am get
ting on an airplane and see people dressed in
garb that identifies them first and foremost as
Muslims.
"This is not a bigoted statement."

There you have it: saying that scary Muslims
in their scary Muslim clothes (well, technically,
it's scary Islamic clothes) are scary is not bigot
ed.This is the part where, if I were looking to re
fute this point, I'd point out that the 9/11 hijack
ers were not wearing Muslim garb (whatever

that means), or point to a counterexample
(what if it were someone saying they were
afraid of black/Latino/Mongolian people?) de
signed to blow your mind.
But we're not going to do that.
Instead, we're going to accept Mr. Williams'
general proposition, which is that Muslims +
plane = spooky, especially around Halloween.
And well, yes! Plenty of people are very much
afraid of Muslims, especially on planes.
At this point, being surprised that people
have racist opinions is like being surprised that
anyone still smokes cigarettes. The science is
pretty much in on both of those topics, but peo
ple of reasonable intelligence still do them any
way. As fun and easy as it would be to label any
person who makes a bigoted statement as an ig
norant and evil moron who spends all his time
thinking up ways to make things worse for mi
norities, that's not how reality works.
Williams also wrote in his statement that "po

litical correctness can cause people to become so
paralyzed that they don't deal with reality."
Indeed someone who is so afraid of being
labeled a racist that he cannot acknowledge a
regrettable and bigoted statement as a regret
table and bigoted statement just because it hap
pens to be true is failing to deal with reality. Oh,
he's talking about those politically correct wuss
es at NPR who fired him? Never mind then.

For reasons beyond me (do supply your
own!), any whiff of racism is met with much
sharper rebuke from liberals who are usually
more tolerant of moral failings than the conser
vatives that are traditionally regarded as the
sticklers for morality. On one side we have peo
ple saying that bigotry should be scrubbed out
of public life. On the other side we have people
who are saying that there was no bigotry in
claiming that Muslims are scary, because if you
mean well and don't want to be a racist, then it
doesn't count.

I should note here because apparently
this needs to be done that even if you can't
help the way you feel, saying bigoted things is
still bigoted. Even if lots of people feel that way,
it's still bigoted. Even if you wish you didn't feel
that way, it's still bigoted. But hey, that's OK!
Nobody's perfect, and I really doubt Juan
Williams is more prejudiced than anyone else.
But once this situation got out of hand, he had
three choices:

1) Grovel and apologize to NPR, and
maybe keep his job.
2) Accept the firing, but say that having a
bigoted belief does not make you an irre
deemable racist, nor does it make you inca
pable of writing award-winning books about
the civil rights movement in America. It does
not mean you are a bad person. But it does
mean that you are a person and a person
with flaws and that it is a constant struggle to
reconcile your instincts with what you know to

be right. State his hope that any admission of
prejudice no longer meant cowering in fear and
awaiting the punishment, and he could have
emerged with his journalistic integrity and dig
nity.

3) Extend a big oF middle finger to NPR,
who couldn't even bother to fire him in person
after 10 years of employment, and then sign a
three-year, $2 million contract with Fox News.
And we're surprised he chose door No. 3
here? Really?

Have a multimillion-dollar contract waiting for
Jordan for when The Daily fires him? E-mail him
