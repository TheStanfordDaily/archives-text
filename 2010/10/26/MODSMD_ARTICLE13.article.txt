## RESEARCH Researchers weigh pros and cons of sun exposure 
### ALEX YU CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Excessive sun exposure can bring with it life
threatening diseases, particularly skin cancer but
a growing fear of skin cancer may lead to vitamin D
deficiency in overprotective patients or those who
spend too much time indoors.
The dichotomous impact of sun exposure has
become a focus of research for dermatologists at
Stanford. This month's Archives of Dermatology
published a research study conducted by assistant
professor of dermatology Jean Tang M.D. Ph.D. 'O3
on correlations between vitamin D deficiency and a
rare form of skin cancer called basal cell nevus syn
drome (BCNS).
Children's Hospital Oakland Research Institute
scientist Ervin Epstein and Stanford Hospital resi
dent Eleni Linos also joined Tang in completing the
study, which examined the blood of 41 patients with
BCNS to determine vitamin D levels. The results
showed that patients with skin cancer were three
times more likely to be vitamin D deficient than the
normal population.
Tang and fellow researchers concluded in
creased attention to sun protection among skin can
cer patients is causing the rises in vitamin D defi
ciency.

"Our study shows that skin cancer patients who
vigilantly photoprotect are three times at risk for vi
tamin D deficiency," Tang said.
In order to prevent skin cancer, many dermatol

ogists recommend refraining from unnecessary sun
exposure. According to Tang, though, such recom
mendations may have adverse effects by reducing
the amount of vitamin D that skin can produce. Vi
tamin D facilitates the absorption of calcium and
also prevents a number of diseases, including can
cers, heart disease and autoimmune disease.

"For dermatologists, our study highlights the fact
that avoiding excessive sun exposure is important
for decreasing your risk for skin cancer," Tang
noted. "But for some of our patients, especially if
they're frail, especially if they have osteoporosis, es
pecially if they have fractures, dermatologists
should be monitoring their vitamin D levels."
Epstein emphasized the need to compensate for
the decreased rates of vitamin D generation, partic
ularly exhorting dermatologists to pay close atten
tion to vitamin D in their patients.
"We, as dermatologists, are telling all of our pa
tients to avoid sunlight to reduce the incidence of
skin cancer," Epstein said. "The moral of the story is
that dermatologists ought to be telling patients to
take supplemental oral vitamin D."
Skin cancer only constituted one of the condi
tions that correlate with vitamin D deficiency.
Tang's study also found other risk factors that may
lead to vitamin D deficiency, including obesity.
"Right now, we don't know for sure the impor
tance of vitamin D in preventing cardiovascular dis
ease or cancer, but vitamin D has gotten a lot of
press because there's been suggestive evidence that
it could be important in prevention of these dis

eases and more and more people are becoming vi
tamin D deficient "Tang said. "And that is probably
related to obesity and a more indoor lifestyle."
Tang's study had many unique elements not
found in previous studies on skin cancer and vita
min D deficiency. In particular, previous studies did
n't look at BCNS and used fewer subjects.Tang also
stressed that her study utilized well-developed
match control to account for all factors in skin can
cer and vitamin D deficiency.
At Stanford, several dermatological studies are
arising as a result of Tang's research. Linos is work-
