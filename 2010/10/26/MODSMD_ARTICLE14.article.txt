## CARD STAYS PERFECT 
### NATE ADAMS DESK EDITOR 
Opening the back half of the Pac-10
season with a bang, the No. 1 Cardinal
women's soccer team put on a defensive
showcase last weekend as it shut out both
Arizona schools 3-0 on the road. Junior
forward Lindsay Taylor found the net in
each game, while senior forward Christen
Press added her 19th goal of the season to
further cement her position as the na
tion's top scorer. With the pair of victories
over the Sun Devils and Wildcats, Stan
ford (15-0-2,6-0-0 Pac-10) remains unde
feated on the season and perfect in con
ference play.

While the final score might suggest
otherwise, Stanford's opponent last Fri
day seemed a good possibility to be the
first team to knock off the nation's top
ranked squad.The Sun Devils (8-4-2,2-2-
1) came into the match third in the con
ference, hadn't lost to Stanford in Tempe
since 1999 and hadn't dropped a single
game at home in all of 2010.
Stanford, however, was quick to open
the scoring. In just the 16th minute, junior
midfielder Teresa Noyola knocked a
cross pass from Press into the far post,
scoring her eighth goal of the season as
the ball sailed past ASU goalkeeper
Alyssa Gillmore. The assist was the 40th
of Press's career, which ties her with Mar
cie Ward for Stanford's all-time record.
The senior forward also recently passed
Sarah Rafanelli for the Cardinal's all
time marks in points and goals.

Stanford extended its lead in the sec
ond half, with defender Annie Case as
sisting sophomore midfielder Mariah
Nogueira and Taylor in the 62nd and 67th
minutes. Case, a redshirt freshman, was
making just her seventh start of the sea
son as she posted her seventh and eighth
assists.

Case began starting on defense
against Washington State last week, and

head coach Paul Ratcliffe has used the
same starting lineup since that game. An
other change he made around that time
was moving junior Camille Levin to the
forward position after having her play as
a defender for most of the season.

Taylor's goal put the score at 3-0, and
that is how the game would end. The Car
dinal allowed just six shots on the match
while posting 21 of its own.
The Cardinal's tough defense carried
over into Sunday's match against the
Wildcats, which it won by the same score.
The scoring began at the same point in
the game as on Friday, with Press shoot
ing an unassisted blast from the midfield
into the right corner of the net. The Palos
Verdes Estates, Calif, native leads the na
tion with 19 goals on the season.
"It was a picture-perfect goal," Rat
cliffe said.

As it did against the Sun Devils, Stan
ford extended its lead over Arizona not
long into the second half. Noyola set up a
goal for senior defender Allison McCann
in the 61st minute, while Taylor posted
her second goal of the weekend on an

unassisted shot in the 66th. The junior for
ward has eight scores on the season.
The real story of Sunday's match,
though, was once again the defense. Stan
ford outshot the Wildcats 22-8, and Oliv
er needed to make only five saves as she
posted the fifth shutout of her rookie sea
son.

"The defense is incredible," Ratcliffe
said. "The last couple of weeks, they've
really gotten in sync together. And
they've really been knocking the ball
around, not only defensively, but offen
sively as defenders. Annie Case had two
assists on Friday and [sophomore defend
er] Alina [Garciamendez] helped out
today. Even the defense is getting in
volved in the offense."

Stanford certainly looked to be in
good form last weekend, but as the post
season looms, Ratcliffe is still intent on
staying hot and improving the team
where he can.

"It's about staying sharp, staying focused,
and staying healthy and working on our
fitness," he said.

Stanford may be the current leader of the
Pac-10, but with only two weekends of
conference play remaining, it isn't alone
at the top of the standings. Oregon State
is also perfect at 5-0 in the conference and
boasts a 13-1-1 record overall. The No. 19
Beavers have allowed only seven goals all
season, compared to Stanford's 10. The
two conference leaders will face off in the
final weekend of regular season play, on
Nov. 5 at Stanford.

As for next weekend, though, the Cardi
nal will head across the Bay to take on
rival California.The Golden Bears (7-4-5,
2-3-1) lost to the Wildcats last weekend
and forced a tie with the Sun Devils after
pushing both games into overtime. Their
rivalry game with Stanford is scheduled
for 3 p.m. this Saturday in Berkeley.

GAME NOTES: Stanford, the No. 1 team in the na
tion, looks to remain unbeaten when it travels to
rival Cal. The Golden Bears have had an up and
down season, but few things would please them
more than ending the Cardinal's perfect run.

While Stanford won both of its matches in Arizona
last weekend, Cal went 0-1-1.


SIMON WARBY/The Stanford Daily
Redshirt freshman defender Annie Case has been a bright spot for the Cardinal since being inserted into
the starting lineup a few weeks ago. Case had two assists in Friday's win at Arizona State.
