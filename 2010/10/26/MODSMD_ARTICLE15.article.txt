## Cardinal men suffer pair of tough losses 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The men's soccer team fought off injuries
and sickness on a tough weekend road trip, but
still lost two tight matches at UCLA (10-4-1,5-
2-0 Pac-10) on Friday night and San Diego State
(8-5-2,2-4-1) on Sunday. The losses dropped the
Cardinal back below .500 on the season, at 7-8-
0 overall and 3-4-0 in the Pac-10.

The two defeats pushed the team back to
ward the middle of a very crowded Pac-10 and

likely out of the title hunt. With a 5-1-1 confer
ence record, California controls its own destiny
after beating UCLA on Sunday, and the Cardi
nal sits in third place with just three games re
maining in the regular season.
"It was a tough weekend result-wise, and we
have put ourselves in a really tough position,"
said sophomore midfielder Hunter Gorskie.
"We know that we have to take care of business
in the last three games to have a chance to go to
the NCAA Tournament. There are no ifs, ands
or buts about it."

On Friday night in Westwood, over 1,000
fans turned out to watch UCLA battle Stanford
at Drake Stadium. The conditions were a little
wet and cool, but the rain stayed away and the
game quickly opened up as both teams pressed
forward and counterattacked often. The Bruins
had excellent chances off corner kicks in the
first and 12th minutes, as well as a shot that
bounced off the crossbar in the 36th minute.

The game also saw the somewhat surprising
return of injured goalkeeper Jason Dodson for
the Cardinal. A dislocated shoulder and partial

fracture had kept the redshirt freshman out of
action for the past two and a half weeks, and fel
low redshirt freshman Galen Perkins had
stepped up and performed well in his absence.
But head coach Bret Simon said that despite
being pleased with Perkins' play, Dodson had
again shown he was deserving of the starting job
in practice.

"I've been really pleased with Galen's per
formance over the past few weeks. But if all the
goalkeepers are healthy and at their
best, Jason has proven he is the No. 1
keeper," Simon said.
Dodson was forced into three early
saves as UCLA outshot Stanford 8-3
in the first half. But the team was still
playing well despite the shot disad
vantage.

"We came out pretty well and were
keeping the ball and sending numbers
forward, and playing good defense,"
Gorskie said. "We had good energy on
defense, and [standout UCLA mid
fielder] Kelyn Rowe was a non-factor.
It was an evenly matched game."

But in the 72nd minute, the Bruins
made something out of nothing. Eder
Arreola dispossessed senior defend
er Cameron Lamming in the back,
despite Lamming's clamoring for a
foul, and passed off to Evan Raynr.
The UCLA midfielder blasted a shot
from 25 yards into the top right cor
ner of the goal past a helpless Dod
son.

The already quick pace picked up
as the Cardinal scrambled for an
equalizer, but UCLA held on for the
1-0 victory.

Stanford came out a little slower
in Sunday's game at San Diego State
after the tough loss on Friday night,
and the Aztecs capitalized early. In
the 27th minute, a Cardinal pass was
intercepted in a dangerous position
and led to an easy breakaway for San

Diego State's Miles By ass. The highly
recruited freshman forward slotted
the ball past Dodson, and Stanford
was in an early hole.
The team played much better after
the break, and nearly broke through
several times in the final 20 minutes.

"We fought really hard to try and
come back," Gorskie said. "We had
plenty of chances with free kicks and
corner kicks, and in the last 20 minutes
they were really on their heels we
gave it our all."

Stanford outshot the Aztecs 8-3 in
the second half and forced keeper
Brad Byrns into three saves, but in the
end came up a bit short in its sixth one
goal loss.
In a league with a large amount of
parity this year, Stanford has showed
plenty of resiliency. But with only a

few games left, it looks more and
more like the Cardinal might be left
out of the postseason for the seventh
time in eight years.
"There are a lot of good teams
in the Pac-10 this year," Simon said.
"It's possible one team will emerge
in these last few games as the dom
inant team, but everybody is so
close it's more likely they will just
end up beating each other up."

Stanford will have three more
chances to prove it is worthy of an
NCAA Tournament bid, starting
with its final homestand this week
end against Washington and Oregon
State. Both matches will be held at
Laird Q. Cagan Stadium.

SIMON WARBY/The Stanford Daily
Senior defender/midfielder Ryan Thomas and the Stanford Cardinal dropped a pair of games in Southern California last weekend. In order to qualify for the
postseason Stanford needs strong performances in its final three matches of the year. That begins with the offense, which was held scoreless overthe weekend.
