## Cardinal men suffer pair of tough losses 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The men's soccer team fought off injuries
and sickness on a tough weekend road trip, but
still lost two tight matches at UCLA (10-4-1,5-
2-0 Pac-10) on Friday night and San Diego State
(8-5-2,2-4-1) on Sunday. The losses dropped the

the NCAA Tournament. There are no ifs, ands
or buts about it."

On Friday night in Westwood, over 1,000
fans turned out to watch UCLA battle Stanford
at Drake Stadium. The conditions were a little

forward and counterattacked often. The Bruins
had excellent chances off corner kicks in the
first and 12th minutes, as well as a shot that
bounced off the crossbar in the 36th minute.

The game also saw the somewhat surprising
return of injured goalkeeper Jason Dodson for
the Cardinal. A dislocated shoulder and partial

fracture had kept the redshirt freshman out of
action for the past two and a half weeks, and fel
low redshirt freshman Galen Perkins had
stepped up and performed well in his absence.
But head coach Bret Simon said that despite
being pleased with Perkins' play, Dodson had
again shown he was deserving of the starting job
in practice.

"I've been really pleased with Galen's per
formance over the past few weeks. But if all the
