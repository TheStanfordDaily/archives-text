# LAX GROWS WEST
## use AND SDSU TO JOIN MPSF 
### JACK BLANCHAT CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Last weekend, the Stanford women's lacrosse team headed
to Philadelphia, Pa., where it played Maryland, Virginia and
Penn, three giants of the lacrosse world. And while the Card's
trip east was an important gauntlet for the girls from the Farm,
the sport of lacrosse inexorably headed west. In one week, the
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation (MPSF) has grown by two
members, with San Diego State officially joining the MPSF on
Friday and USC's announcement that it will be starting Divi
sion I men's and women's lacrosse programs.
San Diego State's women's lacrosse program has been a
club team since 2003, but the jump to Division I is a big move
for the Aztecs. The program named former Stanford assistant
Kylee White as its head coach. White helped guide the Card to
three MPSF championships. Under her watch, Stanford be
came the first program west of the Mississippi River to earn a
bid to the NCAA Tournament. San Diego State will become
the eighth team to join the MPSF, and will play a full confer
ence schedule starting in 2012.

Perhaps the most significant step in the westward expan
sion of lacrosse as a whole is USC lacrosse teams becoming Di
vision I programs. New USC president C.L. Max Nikias an
nounced the move last Monday.

"Pretty soon we are going to announce that we will intro
duce a women's lacrosse team, Division I, at USC," Nikias said
to USC news source Annenberg TV News. "We are in the
process of recruiting the coach for the team and then we will
make the announcement."

Stanford, Oregon and Cal are all in the MPSF, and USC is
expected to join the conference as well.
Nikias also commented that the Trojans would add a Divi

sion I men's lacrosse team in the next three to five years.
Should the Trojans follow through with the D-I men's lacrosse
program, they would only be the third men's Division I pro
gram west of the Mississippi River (the others are Air Force
and the University of Denver), a huge step toward expanding
the game in California.

According to USLacrosse.com, youth participation in the
game has grown by 138 percent since 2001, and the number of
juniors playing lacrosse is now over 300,000 strong, making
lacrosse the fastest-growing sport in America. US Lacrosse
also reports that there are 447 women's college programs on
either the club or varsity level, and more teams are beginning
to spring up every year.

Part of this expansion is due to Title IX, which mandates
that there must be an equal number of scholarships for both
men's and women's athletes, but, as evidenced by the new pro
grams at San Diego State and USC, the expansion of the game
in California alone is already occurring at a rapid pace. Of the
California schools that are currently in the MPSF, UC-Davis
began a lacrosse program in 1997, followed by Cal in 1999, St.
Mary's in 2000 and Fresno State in 2008.
The lacrosse world seems ready to accept the West, and es
pecially California, into the fold. The major lacrosse hotbeds
historically have been in Washington, D.C., Baltimore and
New England, but as the game creeps west, the gap of talent be
tween the East and West is closing, and both Stanford and Den
ver finished in the top 20 in last year's final rankings.
Coaches at prestigious East Coast programs are also begin
ning to turn westward. After 11 seasons with George Mason,
current Stanford head coach Amy Bokker left her spot in
Washington, D.C., in order to join the Cardinal. Similarly, new


SIMON WARBY/The Stanford Daily
Stanford lacrosse head coach Amy Bokker is one example of
lacrosse spreading to the West Coast. Bokker coached at George
Mason in Washington, D.C., before bolting for the Farm.
San Diego State head coach Kylee
White left Loyola University in
Maryland, which finished last season
ranked 16th in the nation. To them
and others, the lure of beginning a
new program out west is too good to
pass up.

While the economic pinch has put
athletic programs everywhere in a
bind, the growth of lacrosse shows no
signs of stopping. The challenge is to
find enough teams to play Stan
ford had to drop a regular season se
ries with defending national champi
on Maryland because of budget cuts
for both schools.

Ironically, trips to the East Coast
are critical in the growth of lacrosse.
"A weekend like [this past week
end] is huge for our team to prepare
to be one of the best teams in the
country," Bokker said. "The games
that we are playing this weekend give
us a good sense of where we are and
what we need to do to get back to the
NCAA Tournament and take the
next step when we are there."

And while the Card must head
east on the road to a lacrosse champi
onship, it's only a matter of time now
before California lacrosse catches up.
Soon, all lacrosse teams could be left
with only one option: go west, young
man (or woman).
