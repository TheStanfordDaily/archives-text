# Jay Cutler is bad at football
## 
### Zoch Zimmerman Dishing the Rock 
Chicago Bears' quarterback
Jay Cutler has left me feel
ing like a heroin addict.
Watching his psychotic
play is detrimental to my
health, yet I keep investing in the habit,
going as far as drafting not one, not two,
but three of his targets to my fantasy
team.

But I've finally curbed my addic
tion. I've let go of the memories of Cut
ler as a young quarterback in Denver,
shredding defenses with his cannon
arm and willingness to thread the ball
into the tightest of spaces. I've stopped
comparing him to a young Brett Favre,
which, believe it or not, was once a com
pliment.

This is because Jay Cutler is really,
really bad. He is literally throwing the
Bears' season into a death spiral. His
numbers against the Redskins on Sun
day, at home, speak for themselves.
They were: 26-40, for 281 yards and
one touchdown. Oh, and four intercep
tions, one of which was run back for a
92-yard touchdown. He should have
had five, but he threw one pass so er
rantly that it smacked a safety square in
the helmet and was luckily caught by
one of his own linemen.
What's worse is that he made Wash
ington cornerback DeAngelo Hall, a
career underachiever, look like the
Messiah. Hall was responsible for all
four of Cutler's interceptions. One,
maybe two interceptions were legiti
mately good reads by Hall. The other
two were gift-wrapped.

When are we going to finally accept
that the guy who threw 26 interceptions
last year actually sucks? Since he be
came a Bear at the start of last season,

the excuses for his abysmal play have
been abundant. I bought the "he does
n't have chemistry with his receivers
yet" argument last season. 1 mean,
could we really get on a guy whose
most talented receiver went to Abilene
Christian? But now, there aren't any ra
tional explanations.
"He's in Mike Martz's system.
When you throw the ball 40 times
you're bound to make mistakes!"
Martz may be the ballsiest, most

pass-happy offensive coordinator in
the league, and his system is a little wild,
but he encourages efficiency and truck
loads of scoring. Cutler only provides
the latter, and it comes in the form of
points for the opposing team.
"Playing with reckless abandon is
what sets him apart from other quar
terbacks. He wins games by taking
chances. What a risk taker!"

Yeah, Cutler is a risk taker, but so
was Tiger Woods. It's not always a good
thing. What actually separates him
from other quarterbacks is his ability to
recognize double coverage and still
conclude that it is a good idea to throw
to his undersized receiver.
Bears fans have to be dumbfound-

Ed and ecstatic when they wake up and
see that their team still has a winning
record. At 4-3, Chicago is tied for first
place in what was expected to be a chal
lenging NFC North. Two of those four
wins came over Carolina and Detroit,
but they are wins nonetheless.
Still, Cutler is posting a passer rating
of 88.5, which is hovering right around
his career average of 83.9. So a guy
throws one pick for every touchdown
and he's still above his career average.
Can you possibly believe that he still
has star potential?

I don't. If I did, I wouldn't dedicate
an entire writing space to one player on
a team with little meaning to me. But
after watching him perform on Sunday,

I can conclude that he is responsible for
the single worst quarterbacking per
formance that I have ever witnessed.
(For those keeping score, I attend a
Pac-10 school. I have seen Cal's Kevin
Riley and UCLA's Kevin Prince play
quarterback. This honor means that
Cutler played worse than two of the
most dreadful college players in the
country. Yikes.)
Cutler's job should be safe for the
remainder of the season considering
just how awful the Bears' backups are,
but unless something drastically
changes, I am led to believe that NFL
squads will drop the "he was picked
11th in the draft, so he must be good!"
mentality.

If not, then four-interception games
will continue to plague the League and
DeAngelo Hall will continue to be
lieve that he can walk on water.
Nobody wants that.

If you have Jay Cutler on your fantasy
team, Zach Zimmerman may be inter
ested in making a trade. Send him an
