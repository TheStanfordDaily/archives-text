# Jay Cutler is bad at football

### Zoch Zimmerman Dishing the Rock 
Chicago Bears' quarterback
Jay Cutler has left me feel
ing like a heroin addict.
Watching his psychotic
play is detrimental to my
health, yet I keep investing in the habit,
going as far as drafting not one, not two,
but three of his targets to my fantasy
team.

But I've finally curbed my addic
tion. I've let go of the memories of Cut
ler as a young quarterback in Denver,
shredding defenses with his cannon
arm and willingness to thread the ball
into the tightest of spaces. I've stopped
comparing him to a young Brett Favre,
which, believe it or not, was once a com
pliment.

This is because Jay Cutler is really,
really bad. He is literally throwing the
Bears' season into a death spiral. His
numbers against the Redskins on Sun
day, at home, speak for themselves.
They were: 26-40, for 281 yards and
one touchdown. Oh, and four intercep
tions, one of which was run back for a
92-yard touchdown. He should have
had five, but he threw one pass so er
rantly that it smacked a safety square in
the helmet and was luckily caught by
one of his own linemen.
What's worse is that he made Wash
ington cornerback DeAngelo Hall, a
career underachiever, look like the
Messiah. Hall was responsible for all
four of Cutler's interceptions. One,
maybe two interceptions were legiti
mately good reads by Hall. The other
two were gift-wrapped.

When are we going to finally accept
that the guy who threw 26 interceptions
last year actually sucks? Since he be
came a Bear at the start of last season,
