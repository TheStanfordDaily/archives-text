# Pre-major advising gets more focus
## Meetings with pre-major advisers are now required once per quarter for frosh 
### MARISA LANDICHO MANAGING EDITOR 
Before this year's freshmen sign up for classes on Axess,
they must first make sure they don't have a hold on their ac
count. Starting with the Class of 2014, undeclared students
must meet at least once a quarter with their pre-major advis
er. To ensure the plan's adoption, students who neglect to
meet with their advisers will face an enrollment hold that
only their advisers can lift.

"The University believes it is important that undeclared
students have the benefit of regular advice and guidance as
they explore the curriculum and hone in on an area of disci
plinary interest that will become their major," wrote Dean
of Undergraduate Advising and Research (UAR) Julie
Lythcott-Haims 'B9 in an e-mail to The Daily.
Mandating quarterly advising meetings, though new for
freshmen this year, was the norm until 2001, according to
Lythcott-Haims. Undeclared students previously had to
consult with an adviser before submitting a study list, a re
quirement that dropped when the University switched to

the People Soft-based enrollment system. The requirement
has been reintroduced now that the system functionality has
been reworked.

The regular meetings only apply to students who have
yet to declare a major, after which the students are turned
over to the advising structures within their major depart
ment. Students are responsible for scheduling their advising
meetings, which are expected to take place within the first
five weeks of each quarter.

At each of these meetings, the pre-major advisor, who
takes on no more than eight incoming freshmen each year,
does not "approve" course schedules, but instead is tasked
with discussing the student's academic interests and per
formance.

These pre-major advisers are volunteer faculty, staff and
local alumni. Approximately one third of the 233 pre-major
advisers are members of the Academic Council (faculty),
one-third are academic staff, such as lecturers and re
searchers, and one-third are non-academic staff, according
