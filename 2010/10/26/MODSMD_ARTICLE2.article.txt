# Pre-major advising gets more focus
## Meetings with pre-major advisers are now required once per quarter for frosh 
### MARISA LANDICHO MANAGING EDITOR 
Before this year's freshmen sign up for classes on Axess,
they must first make sure they don't have a hold on their ac
count. Starting with the Class of 2014, undeclared students
must meet at least once a quarter with their pre-major advis
er. To ensure the plan's adoption, students who neglect to
meet with their advisers will face an enrollment hold that
only their advisers can lift.

"The University believes it is important that undeclared
students have the benefit of regular advice and guidance as
they explore the curriculum and hone in on an area of disci
plinary interest that will become their major," wrote Dean
of Undergraduate Advising and Research (UAR) Julie
Lythcott-Haims 'B9 in an e-mail to The Daily.
Mandating quarterly advising meetings, though new for
freshmen this year, was the norm until 2001, according to
Lythcott-Haims. Undeclared students previously had to
consult with an adviser before submitting a study list, a re
quirement that dropped when the University switched to

the People Soft-based enrollment system. The requirement
has been reintroduced now that the system functionality has
been reworked.

The regular meetings only apply to students who have
yet to declare a major, after which the students are turned
over to the advising structures within their major depart
ment. Students are responsible for scheduling their advising
meetings, which are expected to take place within the first
five weeks of each quarter.

At each of these meetings, the pre-major advisor, who
takes on no more than eight incoming freshmen each year,
does not "approve" course schedules, but instead is tasked
with discussing the student's academic interests and per
formance.

These pre-major advisers are volunteer faculty, staff and
local alumni. Approximately one third of the 233 pre-major
advisers are members of the Academic Council (faculty),
one-third are academic staff, such as lecturers and re
searchers, and one-third are non-academic staff, according
to Lythcott-Haims. Fewer than 10 are
alumni.

Each freshman is matched to an ad
viser according to academic and intel
lectual interests expressed through the
UAR summertime "Approaching
Stanford" process.
"If a student speaks of specific dis
ciplinary interests, we try to find them
an adviser who is knowledgeable
about those interests," Lythcott-
Haims said. "Of course, many students
come in completely undecided."
The pre-major adviser, along with
the academic director, forms the two
person advising team for an incoming

undergrad.
Pre-major advisers have a more
broad understanding of University
majors and departments, and are in
place to "get to know the student and
take the student under his or her wing
until the student declares a major,"
Lythcott-Haims said.
By contrast, academic directors,
who work with around 450 freshmen
and sophomores grouped by residen
tial complex, are professional advisers
who specialize in the curriculum, aca
demic policies and requirements at
Stanford.

"Both [advisers and academic di
rectors] are equipped to advise and
guide students, which means to a large
extent asking a student good ques
tions, and pointing the student toward
the various opportunities and options
at Stanford that will further and deep

en the student's interests," she added.

This change in the advising struc
ture is just one part of the improve
ments since the Freshman Dean's Of
fice was merged with UAR in winter
of 2009. The reorganization, necessi
tated by budget constraints, reduced
the units in the Office of the Vice
Provost for Undergraduate Education
to four from nine.

As a result, Lythcott-Haims, for
merly the dean of freshmen, became
the head of the University's advising
arm, the UAR office. She has since
stressed the differing roles of ADs and
pre-major advisers and the impor
tance of pre-major advising, particu
larly for undeclared sophomores.
