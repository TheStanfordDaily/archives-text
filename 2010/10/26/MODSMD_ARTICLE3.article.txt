## Q&A with Stanford's oldest known living alum 
### CELESTE NOCHE 
This year's Reunion Homecoming
weekend celebrated graduating
classes as recent as 2010 and as
early as 1940. It also commemo
rated one Stanford alumni's 78th
graduation anniversary. The Stanford Daily
took some time to get to know Lawrence W.
Harris, Jr. '32 otherwise known as Stan
ford's oldest living alum.

When were you born and what city did you
grow up in?
I was born July 23,1911 and grew up in San
Francisco. I went to Galileo High School.

What was Stanford's reputation like when
you were applying as a high school senior?
While I was considering college s in the 19205,
Stanford was in its early stages and still grow
ing as a university.

Why did you choose Stanford?
My uncle, Percy L. King, enrolled in Stanford
in 1891 and was part of the first class, al
though he only attended for two years. Also,

I'd like to acknowledge two high
school teachers [who were also Stan
ford graduates] who helped set a very
favorable image of the University
after I chose Stanford on account of
my uncle: Isabel Duff in history and
Elsa Kluegel in botany.

What did you study?
I received my diploma in economics,
but I most enjoyed my work in the
Department of History.

Which dorms did you stay in while
you were here?
Freshman year I lived in Encina Hall
with all of the male freshmen. Both of
my roommates were from Fresno:
Claude Bernhauer and Stanley Mad
den (later to be senior class presi
dent). We all met together again at our
50th reunion. I then lived in the Chi
Psi fraternity house for sophomore,
junior and senior years.

Were you involved in any extracurric
ular activities?

I was part of the varsity swimming
and water polo teams, and each year I
received a Block "S" as an athletic
award. I contributed and participated
in the Junior Opera, Ram's Head So
ciety and Hammer and Coffin (a pub
lishing society). In addition to these
things, I was elected assistant yell
leader my junior year and then head
yell leader for my senior year.

Is a yell leader's role different today
than it was during your undergradu
ate years?
Yes. We used to only have three yell
leaders. Since the end of World War II
there have been more than three yell
leaders and they also have the Dollies.
We are happy to have the Dollies
now.

Do you have a favorite Stanford
memory?
Everything at the Encina pool, be
cause you had to practice every day
for the swim team. I also enjoyed our
econ courses and several history
courses. I was privileged to know the
professors and enjoy the studies.

What was it like being on campus dur
ing the stock market crash in 1929?
Well, I was just a sophomore. It shook
everybody up. It was very dramatic
and very sudden and unexpected. No
one could do anything because most
every student's life was different.

After coming back to the Farm over
the years, what has been the most sur
prising change
When I started coming back, there
were a lot of new buildings. Then, the
individual departments engineer

ing, education, law, medicine and the
Graduate School of Business had
established themselves as very promi
nent departments.These departments
had not emerged to their greatest
strength until after World War 11.

Are there things you miss about the
Stanford you attended?

I miss the student life of the *2os and
'3os. Also, President Hoover became a
very prevalent trustee for the Univer
sity around that time. His influence
was great.

Were there things you thought need
ed change when you were a student?
I don't think so, because this was the
Farm and during the '2os I was just en
tering. I was grateful for the opportu
nity and looking to do my best.

Is there anything else you'd like to
add?

I would just like to say how fortunate
I was to go to Stanford, for which I am
grateful. I am privileged to be a part of
Stanford life after graduation, partic
ularly my involvement with the Stan
ford Alumni Association and most re
cently in the Stanford Cardinal Soci
ety. I am especially grateful to
Howard Wolf, the vice president of
alumni affairs.

Finally, do you have advice to current
students?

Be aware of what a privilege it is to at
tend Stanford and make the most of
the opportunity.

Mr. Harris now lives in Carmel, Calif.
He has five children, including three
Stanford graduates, and has been
married to his wife, Jane, since 1939.
