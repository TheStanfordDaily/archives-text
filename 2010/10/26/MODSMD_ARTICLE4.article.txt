# STUDENT LIFE
## Stanford vies to be most active Pac-10 school 
### CAITY MONROE DESK EDITOR 
The fourth annual Pac-10 Fitness Challenge kicks off this
week in an effort to encourage students, faculty and staff to
maintain healthy levels of physical activity. The conference
wide initiative promotes an active lifestyle by having partici
pants record the time they spend working out and then compar
ing every school's total at the end of the week.
Stanford has won the fitness challenge every year since it
started four years ago.

"So that's our claim," said senior associate athletic director
Eric Stein. "We have the fittest campus and most active campus
in the Pac-10."

Laptops are set up in Arrillaga's lobby for students to regis
ter on the fitness challenge website throughout this week. After
registering, they can log onto the website and record the time
they've spent exercising.

"It's really about promoting good health and physical activ
ity and keeping that a part of everybody's routine," said Jen
nifer Sexton, coordinator of fitness and wellness programs.
"And friendly competition is always fun it brings the campus
together as a collective to participate in something at the con
ference level."

The fitness challenge extends the benefits of competition
based exercise to students who don't usually get that kind of
motivation for their workouts.

Stein remembers meeting a participant in the contest four
years ago who was in the process of eagerly logging his hours
into a laptop at Arrillaga

"Here was a recreational ath
lete that would probably get hurt
on a football field or crushed on a
basketball field," Stein said. With
this program, "people can go out
on their own and get their workout
in and be part of something that is
really big."
The challenge allows partici
pants to log up to two hours of
physical exercise per day.

"We wanted to make the time
limit reasonable," Sexton said.
"We didn't want to encourage peo
ple overdoing it," she added.
Last year, some 3,200 members
of the Stanford community partic
ipated in the challenge. Sexton
thinks that the contest is more rec
ognized by students this year than
in years past.

"I think one of the things that
we're noticing ... is that by now
people know about it," Sexton
said.

Volunteers for the fitness chal
lenge stationed in Arrillaga say
that participation could still be
higher, though.
"It's going pretty well, but it
hasn't been too busy," said Annie
Fryman "14, who was volunteering
at the station set up in the lobby of
Arrillaga. "A lot of people want

free T-shirts and Luna bars, which
is definitely motivating them to
register."
Regardless of whether or not
the challenge really garners the
desired amount of participation or
enthusiasm, virtually everyone
agreed that Stanford is an espe
cially healthy and physically active
campus.

The fitness challenge is just one
of the many ways that programs at
Stanford are trying to promote
physical health. Sexton also cited
the BeWell program, various
healthy dining initiatives, P.E.
classes, club sports and group fit
ness opportunities.

"I think we've got great re
sources here on campus for stu
dents and faculty and staff," she
said. "Sometimes you get busy and
these things get lost so [those re
sources] are just trying to keep
them in the forefront."

"I know a lot of people who . . .
were not physically active before
and have since made the decision
to become physically active be
cause everyone around them is,"
Fryman said.
"It's almost contagious," she
added.

Amy Harris 'l4 agreed.
"Everywhere you go you see
somewhere biking or running or
running to their sports practice,"
she said.
