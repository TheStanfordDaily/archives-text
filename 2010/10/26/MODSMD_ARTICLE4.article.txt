# STUDENT LIFE
## Stanford vies to be most active Pac-10 school 
### CAITY MONROE DESK EDITOR 
The fourth annual Pac-10 Fitness Challenge kicks off this
week in an effort to encourage students, faculty and staff to
maintain healthy levels of physical activity. The conference
wide initiative promotes an active lifestyle by having partici
pants record the time they spend working out and then compar
ing every school's total at the end of the week.
Stanford has won the fitness challenge every year since it
started four years ago.

"So that's our claim," said senior associate athletic director
Eric Stein. "We have the fittest campus and most active campus
in the Pac-10."

Laptops are set up in Arrillaga's lobby for students to regis
ter on the fitness challenge website throughout this week. After
registering, they can log onto the website and record the time
they've spent exercising.

"It's really about promoting good health and physical activ
ity and keeping that a part of everybody's routine," said Jen
nifer Sexton, coordinator of fitness and wellness programs.
"And friendly competition is always fun it brings the campus
together as a collective to participate in something at the con
ference level."

The fitness challenge extends the benefits of competition
based exercise to students who don't usually get that kind of
motivation for their workouts.

Stein remembers meeting a participant in the contest four
years ago who was in the process of eagerly logging his hours
