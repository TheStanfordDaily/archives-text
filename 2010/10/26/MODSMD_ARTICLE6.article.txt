## Stanford explores ideas of ethics and war in new series 
### BRIANNA PANG STAFF WRITER 
When is war justified? What can
we do in the name of war? What do
we owe to people who fight in war?
Who decides who should fight?
Bringing together different aca
demic units on campus, the McCoy
Family Center for Ethics in Society
has spearheaded a project that is set
to discuss such ethical questions sur
rounding war in a wide range of aca
demic disciplines. The year-long se
ries will continue until mid-May, con
cluding with two culminating drama
performance events. The first event,

"War Photographer," took place on
Oct. 14.

Aiming to bring the issues of war
closer to home, Ethics in Society
Center director and philosophy pro
fessor Debra Satz developed the se
ries to provide a wider understanding
of the ethical issues surrounding war.
"We've outsourced the fighting in
wars to other countries and other
people so that you can walk around
Stanford, and really, there isn't much
presence on campus of people who
are fighting in wars, or have fought in
wars, or have relatives who are fight
ing," Satz said. "We've tended to out
source it to one part of the popula

tion, and there aren't very many
courses on war."

"So, a lot of us thought we should
do more to raise these issues on cam
pus because they're very important,"
she added.

The project will provide a look at
war through different academic lens
es. Though Satz is heading the series,
faculty involved come from a wide
range of departments, including
drama, political science, philosophy
and English.
"ft puts together a very rich menu
of people for the arts, from the social
sciences, from philosophy, and so on,
all speaking on different conflicts and
ethical concerns that are raised in this
topic," said Scott Sagan, political sci
ence professor and co-director of the
Center for International Security and
Cooperation (CISAC), one of the
centers involved in co-sponsoring the
series.

Sagan cited the panel discussion
scheduled for Dec. 2, which will dis
cuss the ethics of the draft. He empha
sized the interdisciplinary approaches
to discussing war topics.
"CISAC is actively engaged in
teaching questions of war and peace,
but we don't have a lot of direct dis
cussion of ethics," he said. "Ethics
come in all the time in these issues, but
since we're mostly scientists and social
scientists, the ethical dimensions are
not directly focused upon. So, I
thought it would be exciting to do
more in these areas."

English professor Tobias Wolff
agreed. Wolff is director of the Cre
ative Writing Program at Stanford, an
other collaborating center in the proj
ect.

"One of the ways in which people
discover the nature of war and the ef
fect it has on people is through litera
ture," Wolff said. "There are many dif
ferent ways of approaching this proj
ect. Literature is a very important
one."

Wolff and the Creative Writing
Program will contribute to the project
by bringing in different writers and
authors of works on war.

Besides bringing together English,
philosophy, and political science, the
series will additionally include Stan
ford Summer Theater. Drama profes

sor and director of Stanford Summer
Theater Rush Rehm became interest
ed in the proj ect because of the "mate
rial."

Though not directly involved in the
planning process, students will be in
volved in one of the two culminating
events of the series: a performance of
"Betrayed," the 2009 play written by
New Yorker journalist George Pack
er. Rehm is in the process of coordi
nating this spring's May 20 show.
"Stanford Summer Theater has

done many political works in the
past," Rehm said. "And I thought that
George Packer's play would be im
portant to be a part of this series."
"We're involved in two wars, we
overtook the country, and we're prob
ably directly responsible for the
deaths of hundreds of thousands of
people, and we're probably just going
to leave the country, or a lot of it, in
shambles," he added. "Packer's play
will bring to light some of the issues in
volved in war."

The other event, a performance of
"The Gurs Zyklus" by Mac Arthur
Foundation "genius" award winner
Trimpin, is scheduled for May 14.
The next event of the series, "The
Changing Face of Photojournalism,
the Changing Face of War," will take
place on Thursday, Oct. 28 from 5:30
p.m. to 7:00 p.m.
