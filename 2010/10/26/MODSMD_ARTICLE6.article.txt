## Stanford explores ideas of ethics and war in new series 
### BRIANNA PANG STAFF WRITER 
When is war justified? What can
we do in the name of war? What do

are fighting in wars, or have fought in
wars, or have relatives who are fight

courses on war."

she added.

The project will provide a look at
war through different academic lens

faculty involved come from a wide
range of departments, including
drama, political science, philosophy
and English.
