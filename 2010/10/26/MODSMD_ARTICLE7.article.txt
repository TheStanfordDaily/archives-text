## Experts debate neuro-imaging in courts 
### ANGELIQUE DAKKAK 
Have you ever wondered about the
methodologies behind lie detection? Is
its application in the courtroom setting
appropriate? In which cases is lie detec
tion machinery flawed? A Monday night
panel discussion held by the Stanford In
terdisciplinary Group in Neuroscience
and Society (SIGNS) attempted to tackle
these issues, covering modern neuro-im
aging in locations outside the lab.
The event, "Neuroscience in the Court
room," debated the merits of lie detection
testing, concluding that there were signif
icant reasons to regard it with skepticism.
The panel commenced with a brief intro
duction of potential and current uses of
neuro-imaging in today's society. Those

uses included prediction of behavior,
ability to read minds, detection of pain,
criminal responsibility, treatment of such
diseases as Alzheimer's and enhance
ment of neural processes through drug
use.The discussion then progressed to the
perspectives of a law professional and
neuroscientist on the use of neuroscience
in the court.

Two mediums for lie detection have
been especially involved in court cases
both past and present: The polygraph and
functional Magnetic Response Imaging
(fMRI). Recently, MRIs were used in
court to attempt to prove a plaintiff's in
nocence when he claimed that he hadn't
committed fraud against the govern
ment. Another case used an MRI to con
firm a woman's claim that a man had do

mestically abused her. In both cases, the
judges did not allow the evidence. Early
cases like these bring the use and appro
priateness of neuro-imaging and neuro
science evidence in court into question,
the panelists said.
Anthony Wagner, panelist and cogni
tive neuroscientist, discussed the reliabil
ity of different forms of lie detection. In
doing so, he partially justified the skepti
cism of judges and other court personnel
in allowing lie detection as evidence in
court cases.

"As of now, there is no relevant data on
the sensitivity and specificity of fMÃŸl
based lie detection," he said.

Rather, the studies compare the condi
