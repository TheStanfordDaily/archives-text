## Stanford appears in 'Knife Music' Stanford depicted in novel about suicide, sex and secrets 
### ZOE LEAVITT SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
One sole mention of an unopened bi
ology textbook is the only studying
that gets done on the campus of
David Carnoy's Stanford.

The Stanford portrayed in Carnoy's recent
novel, "Knife Music,," teems with gun-toting frat
boys, guzzled pills, sexual assault and casual
blackmail with horrific consequences.
"I grew up in Palo Alto and it's kind of a bor
ing place," Carnoy said. "We called it Shallow
Alto. There's some stuff that goes on that you
wouldn't necessarily expect for such an idyllic
place."

In "Knife Music" named after the term
surgeons apparently use for the songs they listen
to as they perform surgeiy a 17-year-old girl
commits suicide after her parents find her diary
describing graphic sex between her and the doc
tor who operated on her the previous year. Is the
diary entry true, and is the doctor then responsi
ble for her death? The detective assigned to her

case believes so, but secrets revealed throughout
the book about her time at a Stanford frat party
the night of the alleged assault may tell a differ
ent story.

Carnoy, who attended high school in Menlo
Park and whose father, Martin, is an education
professor at Stanford, pumps the book full of
local references, from the Dutch Goose pub to
the Stanford Bookstore to the mesh wire chairs
outside Tresidder. While he traded his college up
bringing for an East Coast education at Wes
leyan, some of his own high school experiences
inform the basis of the novel.

"Girls in our high school would go to Stanford
parties to lose their virginity," he said.
However, University officials needn't get too
worried. Having traded his Cardinal upbringing
for an East coast education, Carnoy's Stanford in
"Knife Music'' creates a melting pot of details de
signed to show how the highest GPAs can mask
the darkest extracurriculars.

"I went to Wesleyan, so it's a partial compos
ite of college frat life," Carnoy said about his char
acters. "Wesleyan is a very PC place, and we had
some incidents you wouldn't expect. Some of the

issues can happen anywhere."
"Knife Music" also explores the increasingly
complicated obstacle course of forbidden atten
tion, closed doors and threats of litigation hospi
tal workers navigate every day.
"With doctors you get it both ways. Some
times you get patients that are very uncomfort
able about their bodies, and sometimes you get
the opposite, patients that are a little too comfort
able," Carnoy said.

Even on those mundane hospital days with
out sexual harassment lawsuits or overly excited
patients, Carnoy saw how the health care system
can wear doctors down especially doctors
who spent their most formative years in labs and
classrooms while leaving their lives unexamined.
"A lot more doctors put in all this time becom
ing a doctor and then there's this moment where
they're not sure they should have," Carnoy said.
"A lot of people are making money doing
other things, so to be a doctor in this environ
ment, when you look around at all these startups,
[is difficult]," he said about Silicon Valley's
unique challenges.

Carnoy, meanwhile, is no stranger to startup

culture. As an executive editor for CNET, a
media news website, and author of the technolo
gy column "Fully Equipped," "Knife Music"
presents a departure from his normal style. How
ever, his position at CNET helped him market his
book from a rather unusual position.
After deciding to publish the novel on his
own, Carnoy put it out as an iPhone app. Howev
er, the tech-sawy move wasn't so easy.

"[My app
developer] e-mailed me one day and said the app
was rejected by Apple for having objectionable
content," he said. "They had actually taken a
screen shot of one line in the book they flagged,"
he added with a laugh.

Luckily for the book, some people just could-
