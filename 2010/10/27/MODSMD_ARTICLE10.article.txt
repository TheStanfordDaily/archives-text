# The 						Stanford 'legacy'
## What family connections to the Farm mean, for better or for worse 
### CHRISTINA BROW 
For lawyers, "legacy" is a gift of
personal property by will. Music
aficionados might recognize it as
an album by The Temptations or
Motown. But at Stanford, being a
"legacy" means you have family history
here in addition to some pressures
other students are less familiar with.
Some students had alumni parents who
encouraged them to attend Stanford. For
est Nelson 'l2 felt that pressure from his
mother. From a young age, he was encour
aged to study and pursue academics so
that he could attend the school that his
parents and three aunts did.
Patrick Kelly 'l2 experienced a similar
influence from his family. When he was
only two days old, his grandfather placed a
Stanford visor on his head. Even with the
strong bond between his family and the
Cardinal, Kelly said going to Stanford
"was still my decision."
"I feel like I have to prove myself once
people hear I'm a legacy," Kelly said. "But
I'm here for other reasons."
In contrast to Nelson and Kelly's fami
ly members, Megan O'Neil's mom made a
conscious effort not to influence her
daughter's college decision. In fact, O'Neil
'l3 had planned not to visit anywhere ex
cept Stanford, but her mother encouraged

her to consider other schools as well.
Many students whose parents attended
Stanford feel strong ties to the school.
O'Neil said that since her sisters attended
Stanford, she feels an "automatic connec
tion" to the Farm. Following in the foot
steps of her alumni parents, two sisters,
aunt, uncle and grandfather, O'Neil feels
like she's adding to a family tradition.
"It's cool to be a third-generation stu
dent, but it's also cool that first-generation
students are paving the way for legacies to
come," O'Neil said.
Family lore exposed O'Neil to a num
ber of Stanford traditions before arriving
on campus. Instead of just remembering
last year's Full Moon on Quad, O'Neil can
remember her sisters' stories as well. Sim
ilarly, when she bikes through the Quad,
she remembers one of her father's old
tales.
"One time, my dad drove his red Fiat
into the Quad, where he had a date,"
O'Neil said.
For some, family influence just meant
staying away from a rival school. The only
pressure Ginny Scholtes 'l3 felt was to
avoid USC, she said.
Scholtes forged a strong bond with
Stanford during her yearly visits to north
ern California. Since she was a year old,
she has spent time with the Stanford Sier
ra Club, a program for alumni and their

families on the shores of Fallen Leaf Lake,
just south of Lake Tahoe. Each family is as
signed a cabin, and during the stay, mem
bers sail, row, hike and play sports.
"I want to graduate so that I can get a
cabin," Scholtes said. "My sisters have
kids, and I would like to bring them up to
the lake."
Dean of Undergraduate Admission
and Financial Aid Richard Shaw said lega
cy status has always been just one factor of
many under consideration in the admis
sion process. He said it's a "myth" that be
cause one is accepted as a legacy student,
he or she is less qualified for Stanford. He
called legacy students "exceedingly com
petitive."
And the Faculty Senate this month af
firmed the charge of the University Com
mittee on Undergraduate Admission and
Financial Aid, which says Stanford may
give special consideration to "those appli
cants whose parents graduated from Stan
ford," who are the children of faculty or
staff, who are exceptionally talented, who
belong to an ethnic minority or who lend
"desirable diversity" to the class.
Admission decisions "are reflective of
the kind of classes we want here," Shaw
said. "We're not out of bounds."
