## MS&E program celebrates 10-year anniversary, reflects on progress 
### PATRICIA HO 
Stanford's Management Science
and Engineering (MS&E) depart
ment will continue expanding and
adapting its undergraduate and
graduate programs after celebrating
its 10-year anniversary on Oct. 15.
The department was created in an
effort to combine three smaller areas
of study operations research, en
gineering-economic systems and in
dustrial engineering and engineering
management into a comprehen
sive major, according to MS&E de
partment Chair Elisabeth Pate-Cor
nell.

"The goal of the merger between
the three departments was to ex
plore the synergy among these de
partments and to make it much more
substantial, interdisciplinary and vi
brant," Pate-Cornell said. "I think we
have done just that."
According to department student
services officer Lori Cottle, the num
ber of applicants to the program has
been stable overall, as the depart
ment generally receives about 800
applicants to its master's program
and 250 applicants to its doctoral
program each year.
This year, the department admit
ted 37 percent of applicants to its
master's program and 15 percent of
applicants to doctoral program, re
spectively. In total, 130 undergradu
ate students, 356 masters students
and 121 doctoral students are cur
rently enrolled.
The department also receives a
large number of coterminal degree
applications from Stanford under

graduates, which Cottle attributes to
the department's technical focus.
"We're a good next step for a stu
dent who has done something very
technical and is sure that's where
they want their career to go," Cottle
said.

While reflecting on the depart
ment's progress since its inception,
Pate-Cornell said that although
quantitative factors such as the num
ber of applicants, standardized test
scores and the acceptance rates from
each year are important, the depart
ment primarily measures its success
by the merits of its applicants.
"There is not one single [quantita
tive] measure that would give an in
dication of success," Pate-Cornell
said. Instead, "we look at the quality
of the students that we attract."

Moving forward, the department
will adapt its courses and other pro
grams as needed to ensure that it
continues to provide students with
fundamental technical skills to han
dle a variety of fields.
"Now we are trying to adapt the
areas that we have to the big prob
lems and changes in the world,
whether in energy, health environ
ment, communication, information
systems or national security," Pate-
Cornell said.

Many graduates from the MS&E
department have gone on to become
analysts in a variety of business
fields, including consulting, banking,
finance, product management and
marketing. Several graduates have
pursued careers in engineering and
technology as well, according to the
Career Development Center's re

port on destination employment
from 2006 to 2009.

loana loanovici 'l2, who declared
her MS&E major earlier this year,
said the department provides a com
prehensive foundation for her plans
to work in operations management
after graduation.
"I wanted to have a broader range
of career opportunities after I gradu
ate," loanovici said. "MS&E allows
you to be well-rounded as an individ
ual, and it gives you more freedom,
because I know I'm not confined to
anything."
loanovici also appreciates the
major for its efforts to provide stu
dents with more applied than theo
retical knowledge and skills.
"I felt that MS&E was a special
opportunity because it prepares you
for the real world," loanovici said.
"The classes teach you very impor
tant skills and are very applicable.
When you finish a class, you learn
how to do something new for ex
ample, how to optimize costs, or how
a supply chain works."
Pate-Cornell said she is proud of
MS&E's innovation and creativity,
which lends the department its stay
ing power.

"Ten years later, the department
has blossomed, which is not to say
that there are never any problems,"
Pate-Cornell said. "But we have cer
tainly managed to create programs
that involve the spectrum of topics
and disciplines from social sciences
to operations research."
