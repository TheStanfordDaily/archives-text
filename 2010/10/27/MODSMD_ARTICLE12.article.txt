## Terman library adapts to e-readers, new 'bookless' system 
### GRACE PARK 
Those expecting to see a traditional library would be
surprised to step into the Frederick Emmons Terman
Engineering Library within the Jen-Hsun Huang Engi
neering Center. With its opening this summer, the new
Terman Engineering Library, which used to be located
in the Terman Engineering Center, is bringing to reality
the new concept of a library one that's "bookless."
In this move, the library has cut down the number of
books to about 20,000 from 80,000 and increased the
number of e-books to around 40,000.

After two months of operation, the library is generat
ing positive responses from its student patrons.
"I study here often and I think the library is great,"
said first-year Management Science and Engineering
(MS&E) master's student Luyin Zhao. "Finding the re
served books and self-checkout systems are very conven
ient. I can find all the accommodations I want."

Overall, the four circulating e-readers are usually
checked out; conference rooms around the library are
often full with groups of students and professors. "Any
one can walk in and study only if there's a space," Zhao
said.

Though the new library's bustling popularity can be
come a problem for some, patrons of this library seem to
enjoy the atmosphere, according to Helen Josephine,
head librarian.

"In a sense, now you see people busy reading, but they
are in the lobby of a hotel with all these activities around
them," Josephine said. "Some people really like that feel
ing, maybe because they can concentrate but they don't
feel alone,"

"I study here almost every day," said first-year

MS&E master's student Kalbana Kumar. "The best
thing about the library is that it's quiet, small and al
ways has spaces."

The library has also made many efforts to reach out to
students and faculty. Four librarians, each assigned to dif
ferent departments, are working to ensure that every
thing is running smoothly. They update faculty on new
databases, Search Works and other interfaces for finding
information.

"We have much more interactive sessions with the
school to make sure that the students are aware where
the library is, what staff and resources are available,"
Josephine said. After each term, the library will have sta
tistics on library usage and check what needs to be done
to improve the library.

Meanwhile, although the library is equipped with the
latest technology, not many students are taking full ad
vantages of the resources.

"I think it's great, but I've used only a little part of the
resources in the library," Zhao said.
Other students such as doctoral student Jin Chang
have not adjusted to the e-book system. "I love the at
mosphere in Terman Library," Chang said, "though I'm
not fully comfortable with e-books and e-readers. But if
that's what the trend is, I would like to follow up with
that."

Though the library generally received positive feed
back, Josephine said she continues to seek out patrons'
opinions and concerns about the new library in order to
determine how best to improve its operations.
"We definitely want to keep those communications
open," said Josephine.
