# OPINIONS
## SENT FROM MY IPHONE Full Moon on the Quad Should Be More Decadent and Depraved 
### Peter McDonald 
All I've ever wanted to be in life is
Hunter S. Thompson. This is my at
tempt at Gonzo journalism for Wan
ing Gibbous on the Quad, as you astronomy
buffs so rightly pointed out.
As I am running to push a shopping cart
carrying a sousaphone, as my chemically in
duced feelings of wonder and beauty have
fully engaged themselves, after three long
years, I actually have to hand it to the ASSU.
For an organization that embodies apathy
and deadweight loss, it finally came up with a
good idea. Super Mash Bros, appears to be
working the crowd into an optimal frenzy,
and the Band as pied piper should successful
ly minimize any awkward transition period.
Awkward transition period, that's a suit
able name for the events that followed. The
sophomore class said they wanted to class it
up. I see nothing of the kind. I heard there
were supposed to be roses. I can't find them,
which is fine. After all, in the immortal words
of Andre 3000, "Lean a little bit closer, see,
roses really smell like boo boo boo." Maybe
it's just a function of Stanford (a.k.a. the first
place I met anyone under 40 who enjoyed
golf), but I have noticed that my generation
has a confounding obsession with classiness,
though only in a superficial sense. "Classy" is
a great theme for parties. Drinking Two Buck
Chuck instead of Coors Light really means
you're going places in the world, but the pre
ponderance of middle-class liberal guilt has
taken all the bite out of telling someone
they're like school in July. If anything, it's
usually viewed as a compliment.
Besides, sophomore class, did you miss the
birth of a man called Michael Cera? Awk
wardness is how we define ourselves. Some
kids enter Full Moon looking for their first
kiss. Half the people there can't stop thinking
about their midterms the next day. The other
half will view it as a referendum on their at
tractiveness, even though it's completely
dark outside. It's a strange, awkward, annoy
ing, horrible, beautiful, awesome event. Why
you wanna mess all that up by tryin' ta inject
a silly thing like "class," with all of its socioe
conomic implications, up in here?

Back to the scene. I wish I had been able
to find my extra "Kiss Me, I Donated Blood"
sticker. That might have smoothed things
over. No matter, this is awesome. I'm having
the greatest time. Should probably try to find
some freshmen, but I'm also, like, not feeling
the need to put on my creeper hat. I'm just
gonna try and find people I know. I'd be real
ly happy if someone came up to me and said
they really like my column. That stuff never
gets old. It's really the main buttress of my
ego at this point. Oh, hello lady. Why yes, I
would like to kiss you. I don't think this gets
discussed enough, but kissing tastes weird. It
looks like a lot of people are standing on the
outside. They must be sad. I am wondering
when everyone's gonna wake up and turn
Full Moon into the love-fueled rave it's sup
posed to be. It'd cut through a whole lot of
that awkwardness. We need an Owsley Stan
ley up in this, but for MDMA instead. Just
sayin'.

Earlier this week, whoever the opening
act was got a hold of my e-mail and called

Full Moon a sketchfest. That seems like a
mischaracterization. For something that's on
the mind of everyone here, there are very few
events explicitly dedicated to the satisfaction
of bodily desires. People need a place to go
where they can affirm for themselves that
"yes, I am a sexual being who is looking to
satisfy my desires tonight if the right person
comes along." Sketchy is too loaded a word.
True, some idiots are going to cross some
boundaries because they think they're enti
tled to. Assholes. But letting them take over
the event really does a disservice to everyone
else who is using Full Moon as a chance to
just possibly figure out what the hell they are
ever doing about anything ever.
It's currently 1:30.1 didn't keep tally, but
I'm satisfied. Did not find any of the girls I
might have been looking for. My scooter is
currently lost in that shopping cart. When
texting a friend about how her evening went,
I for some reason mentioned AxeComm.
This girl I do not know wants me to text last
year's Tree because she "really wants to
know where he is." This is dumb, but I'm
bored so I play along. He texts back "I
DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON."
This takes 40 minutes. (Thank God for time
stamps on texts.) All right, enough of this. It's
a long walk back to the Shak. Well done,
Stanford.
