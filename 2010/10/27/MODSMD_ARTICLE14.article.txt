# LOOKING UP
## Do You Ever Not Wonder... ? 
### Nina M. Chung 
It's starting to become clear... that ambi
guity makes me really anxious, as do all ex
ternal variables in my life that I don't and
won't know. And this abstract stress-inducer
comes in many domestic forms. For instance, it
still freaks me out that I misplaced a complete
ly finished diary somewhere in the world four
years ago. Rainy days persistently remind me
of my gorgeous, enormous umbrella that dis
appeared last winter at the Stanford Book
store/Wilbur Dining. And don't get me started
on the locational mystery of well-loved pens I
lent out in high school, because I'm still won
dering.

Then short-term becomes long-term. Last
year, for example, I collapsed at a table in
Building 160 while reading a rejection e-mail
from the only summer opportunity I had ap
plied for after an extremely haughty six
months of openly banking on that job, I felt
total insecurity. Then there was the imminent
disaster when the International Relations de
partment asked me what my "post-Stanford
plans" were, a question that was strategically

shelved for a week, and still not answered in
real life.

And recently, sometime last week, I real
ized much too late that I was playing out that
one shamelessly cliche scene found in most of
the movies I despise: I was (oh, this is embar
rassing) literally waiting by the phone. Ugh,
yeah. For a call that wasn't coming. Inevitably
I was filled with questions, I was anxious and I
was downright grossed out with myself being
in that situation. I wanted answers now.

This is the typical, ambiguous experience
that epitomizes (a) the existence of unanswer
able questions and (b) how it leads to anxiety.

We fumble around asking annoying questions
like: What do they think of me? When did
things change? When will I find out? Did the
lost-and-found people not look hard enough?
But it's an equation with too many variables,
an event characteristic of a world of imperfect
information.There's no objective, omniscient,
third-person narrator (which is unfortunate,
because hearing a calm Morgan Freeman
every day would probably do us all a lot of
good). Ultimately, I don't know your total sit
uation, and you surely don't know mine. And
still our lives collide into each other or tem
porarily run parallel, but the fact is, we confuse
each other like crazy because we'll never
know all the causative details.

So there I was, navigating a frustrating
roundabout of whys and hows and whens,
feeling pretty much left in the dark, with un
ringing cell phone in hand. But I realized
epiphany! that there was one thing I knew
for sure: I was here, being me, and everything
