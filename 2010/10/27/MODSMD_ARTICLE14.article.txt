# LOOKING UP
## Do You Ever Not Wonder... ? 
### Nina M. Chung 
It's starting to become clear... that ambi
guity makes me really anxious, as do all ex
ternal variables in my life that I don't and
won't know. And this abstract stress-inducer
comes in many domestic forms. For instance, it
still freaks me out that I misplaced a complete
ly finished diary somewhere in the world four
years ago. Rainy days persistently remind me
of my gorgeous, enormous umbrella that dis
appeared last winter at the Stanford Book
store/Wilbur Dining. And don't get me started
on the locational mystery of well-loved pens I
lent out in high school, because I'm still won
dering.

Then short-term becomes long-term. Last
year, for example, I collapsed at a table in
Building 160 while reading a rejection e-mail
from the only summer opportunity I had ap
plied for after an extremely haughty six
months of openly banking on that job, I felt
total insecurity. Then there was the imminent
disaster when the International Relations de
partment asked me what my "post-Stanford
plans" were, a question that was strategically

shelved for a week, and still not answered in
real life.

And recently, sometime last week, I real
ized much too late that I was playing out that
one shamelessly cliche scene found in most of
the movies I despise: I was (oh, this is embar
rassing) literally waiting by the phone. Ugh,
yeah. For a call that wasn't coming. Inevitably
I was filled with questions, I was anxious and I
was downright grossed out with myself being
in that situation. I wanted answers now.

This is the typical, ambiguous experience
that epitomizes (a) the existence of unanswer
able questions and (b) how it leads to anxiety.

We fumble around asking annoying questions
like: What do they think of me? When did
things change? When will I find out? Did the
lost-and-found people not look hard enough?
But it's an equation with too many variables,
an event characteristic of a world of imperfect
information.There's no objective, omniscient,
third-person narrator (which is unfortunate,
because hearing a calm Morgan Freeman
every day would probably do us all a lot of
good). Ultimately, I don't know your total sit
uation, and you surely don't know mine. And
still our lives collide into each other or tem
porarily run parallel, but the fact is, we confuse
each other like crazy because we'll never
know all the causative details.

So there I was, navigating a frustrating
roundabout of whys and hows and whens,
feeling pretty much left in the dark, with un
ringing cell phone in hand. But I realized
epiphany! that there was one thing I knew
for sure: I was here, being me, and everything

on the other side of the phone line
was simply . .. not in my jurisdic
tion. Knowing answers about some
one else's circumstances wasn't
going to change this situation. But
letting go of the unknowable, dis
tracting questions was. So I stopped
the self-caused ambiguity anxiety,
and it was the most refreshing
breath of air for my former mental
mess.

In accordance with my thematic
novel of a life, a close friend of
mine, Kevin Morton 'l2, told me an
uncannily related story that has
been running in my head since. We
ran into each other the second
week of school, and he told me how

he had lost his camera somewhere
around a castle while participating
in an archaeological dig in northern
England this past summer. It was
only the first week of a huge, new
experience, but Kevin said the cam
era was surely invisible in tall grass,
there was no way to retrieve it, and
he actually felt freed from the duty
of taking pictures instead of living
them out first-hand. Within mo
ments, my friend Kevin, having one
of the brightest attitudes I've ever
encountered, just let that veteran
camera go.

Three months later, moving
back into Stanford, Kevin received
an e-mail from a woman from the
south of England. Her family had
been playing Hide-and-Seek at a
castle up north when her treasure
seeking son picked up a relic of a
camera. They then spent the sum
mer navigating the Internet to find

its owner via records of marathon
IDs, e-mail addresses of soccer
coaches, high school sports team
sites, Stanford athlete bios and
Kevin's dad's work website. In a
beautiful twist of plot, this family
spent so much more time on that
camera out of compassion than
Kevin ever did in anxiety.
Conversely, I'll admit that I
spent a lot of precious time last
week speculating the unknown. But
I seriously loosened up on the use
less questioning; I let go. And real
ly, it makes all the sense in the
world that I ended up losing noth
ing and gaining a lot more.

Amid all the things we won't ever
know, there is one thing you should
know by now: Nina's e-mail address
is ninamc@stanford.edu. So keep e
mailing. She's loving her reader re
sponses.
