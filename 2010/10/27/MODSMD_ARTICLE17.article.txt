## PAC-10 POWER RANKINGS 
### 
Every week, Jacob Jaffe will give his Pac-10 football power rankings. These represent a
measure of current success, not a prediction of future standings or a measure of talent.
1. Oregon (7-0, 4-0 Pac-10) UP NEXT: at USC
Q The Ducks are the top team in nearly every poll, the only undefeated team in a deep
Pac-10 and probably the most impressive offense in the country. They put on one of
the biggest shows of the year in a 60-13 thumping of UCLA on national television
last week, and they'll have a chance to do the same this week against a fired-up Trojan team.
Oregon appears to be one of the top few teams in the nation, but it will still be tested against
USC.
2. Arizona (6-1, 3-1 Pac-10) UP NEXT: at UCLA
ET3 So much for missing its starting quarterback. With Nick Foles on the sideline, Arizona
I/j\ didn't skip a beat, pounding Washington 44-14. Replacement Matt Scott, who
LJ began 2009 as the starter, did not throw an interception and had a higher passer
rating than Foles has had in a game in his career. Foles could come back against the Bruins
this weekend, but either quarterback will provide a big edge over UCLA's woeful passing attack,
which ranks last among non-triple option offenses in yards per game.
3. Stanford (6-1, 3-1 Pac-10) UP NEXT: at Washington
Stanford drops a spot after one of the most lackluster wins in recent memory. Stepfan
Taylor had a career day running the ball, but it is hard to take a whole lot of positives
out of a 10-point win over Washington State, the closest Pac-10 game the Cougars
have had since their last conference victory two years ago. The Cardinal will need to
be much sharper this week against the Huskies because Seattle is always an intimidating place
for opponents.
4. USC (5-2, 2-2 Pac-10) UP NEXT: vs. Oregon
/frobcut "^ ie Trojans stay put after their bye week, but will likely make a move one way or the
other after their showdown with Oregon. The Ducks embarrassed USC last year in
l3i Eugene, and the Trojans would love to repay the favor at the Coliseum on Saturday.
With no bowl game in sight, this is the game of the year for USC. It will need to find
a defense over the bye, though, because Oregon's offense doesn't make things easy on any
opposing unit.
5. California (4-3,2-2 Pac-10) UP NEXT: at Oregon State
J* Location, location, location. Yet again, the Golden Bears prove that home-field
m swjJ advantage can make a big difference. In Cal's case, it seems to mean everything,
because the Bears have won all four of their home games, outscoring their oppo
nents 189-34. Away from Memorial Stadium, Cal is 0-3, scoring only 16 points per game.
The blowout win over Arizona State last weekend will not mean as much if the trend continues
this weekend in Corvallis.
6. Oregon State (3-3, 2-1 Pac-10) UP NEXT: vs. California
After a grueling first half of the season, which included the end of wide receiver
James Rodgers' season, the Beavers got a much-needed bye last week. Now,
Oregon State gets the luxury of playing Cal at home, where it has not lost this sea
son. A win would make a bowl game very likely, while a loss could leave the
Beavers' holiday schedule wide open.
7. Washington (3-4, 2-2 Pac-10) UP NEXT: vs. Stanford
/jj Washington, Arizona State and UCLA are very hard to separate: all are inconsis
tent 3-4 teams coming off blowout road losses. The Huskies get the nod here sim
y ply because they have won two Pac-10 games, although each came by just one
point. Washington has a chance to jump above the crowd and give itself a good shot at a bowl
game with a home upset of the Cardinal. To do so, though, it will need a strong night from
quarterback Jake Locker, who has been slowed by injuries but is expected to start.
8. Arizona State (3-4, 1-3 Pac-10) UP NEXT: vs. Washington State
Three straight close losses early in the season could derail the Sun Devils' bowl hopes,
yCljjsj which are now slim at best. Arizona State will need to upset a couple of teams in order
to get the seven wins it needs to go bowling. The Sun Devils will welcome Washington
State to Tempe this weekend, which would usually be the cure for any ailments. Now,
though, ASU might be more worried about an upset than any Cougar foe in years.

9. UCLA (3-4, 1-3 Pac-lO) UP NEXT: vs. Arizona
Every week that goes by brings the Bruins farther from their upset of then-No. 7
Texas, and it is showing in their on-field product. UCLA has looked outclassed in
Pac-10 play, and injuries and suspensions aren't helping. Now without their start
ing quarterback Kevin Prince for the rest of the season, the Bruins will have to rely even more
on their running game. The schedule doesn't get a whole lot easier after last Thursday's steam
rolling by Oregon, as UCLA must now host Arizona.

10. Washington State (1-7, 0-5 Pac-10) UP NEXT: at Arizona State
The Cougars got closer to escaping the bottom of the conference than they have
in years this past weekend. A 21-point fourth quarter at Stanford is certainly
impressive, but Wazzu needs to get a real victory to go with its recent moral ones.
This Saturday brings a definite opportunity for the Cougars, because Arizona State
appears very vulnerable. Washington State has a chance to end its 14-game Pac-10 losing
streak, but it will need another strong effort from quarterback Jeff Tuel.
