## Landry Fields '10 to start in NBA debut 
### â€“ Zach Zimmerman 
Former Stanford basketball star
Landry Fields 'lO, who was selected in
the second round of this year's NBA
Draft, was named the starting shooting
guard for the New York Knicks by head
coach Mike D'Antoni earlier today.
The 6-foot-7 Fields averaged just less
than nine points and three rebounds per
game for the Knicks this preseason. A
surprise draft pick at No. 39, Fields
quickly became a favorite among Knicks
fans, who initially booed his selection in
June's draft. He will supplant former
starter Wilson Chandler in New York's
lineup. D'Antoni cited Fields' lack of
mistakes in the preseason and his high
energy style as reasons for making his

decision.
Fields played for four seasons at Stan
ford. He saw his statistics jump when he
was named a starter in his junior season,
but did not receive national recognition
until his senior year. In the 2009-10 sea
son, Fields was among college basket
ball's scoring elite, averaging 22 points
per game. Stanford's lack of depth that
season required Fields to play several
positions, which scouts say helped im
prove his all-around game.
The Knicks open their season tonight
when they visit the Toronto Raptors. Tip
off is scheduled for 4 p.m.
