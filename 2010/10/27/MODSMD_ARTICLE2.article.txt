## Senate rethinks finance New caps proposed for publicly funded exec slates 
### MARGARET RAWSON DESK EDITOR 
The 12th ASSU Undergraduate
Senate decided Tuesday evening on
the spring 2011 ASSU general elec
tion date, received the resignation
of the Appropriations Committee
Deputy Chair and began animated
discussion on a bill to cap campaign
spending for ASSU executive candi
dates.
The spring 2011 general election
will take place April 7 and 8, two
weeks after the beginning of spring
quarter.
Senator Ben Jensen 'l2 submit
ted his resignation Tuesday as
deputy chair of the Appropriations
Committee, citing a heavy course
load and difficulty in attending
meetings.
"The needs of the committee and
my personal needs are not being
met, so in the interest of the commit
tee I feel I should resign," Jensen
said.
Senate Chair Michael Cruz 'l2
told his fellow senators they may
apply for Jensen's position, and
Jensen may choose to join another
committee in place of Appropria
tions. Jensen's replacement will re
quire two-thirds approval by the
Senate.

Executive Campaign Finance
ASSU President Angelina Car
dona 'll and Vice President Kelsei
Wharton 'l2 presented a bill on pre
vious notice containing campaign
spending caps for executive elec
tions, as well as other stipulations
for executive candidates. Most no
tably, the "Bill to Reform Elections
to Create Equal Access to the Exec
utive Office" would cap expendi-
tures for slates receiving public fi
nancing at $750 and would require
slates to submit itemized budgets of
campaign expenses. The ASSU ex
ecutives would allocate $3,000 from
their budget to the Elections Com
mission for public financing for can
didates.

The bill would require slates to
gather 300 signatures in order to re
ceive public financing, with 100 each
from undergraduates and graduate
students an increase of 100 sig
natures from current policy, aimed
to make it difficult for less-serious
slates to receive funding.
"You don't necessarily need to
spend, spend, spend to run a good
campaign," Wharton said, introduc
ing the bill. Without spending caps,
he argued, potential candidates may
be deterred from running.
Cardona spoke of creating a
"culture where people of all back
grounds feel like they have the op
portunity to decide to run."
Zachary Warma 'll, a senator
last year, attended the meeting
specifically to voice numerous con
cerns about the details and philoso
phy of the bill. (Warma is chair of
the Daily editorial board.) The 10th
and 11th Undergraduate Senates
rebuked similar campaign finance
bills, Warma said.

Warma argued that the bill
would unnecessarily politicize the
role of ASSU financial manager and

elections commissioner and ques
tioned the bill's necessity.
"If it ain't broke, don't fix it,"
Warma said, noting that executive
campaign expenditures have de
creased since hitting spending highs
in 2008.

Senator Robin Perani 'l3 argued
in favor of spending caps, citing her
own difficulty in deciding whether
or not to run for Senate despite
monetary concerns that almost
caused her to drop out of the race.
"It's unfair and discriminating
against someone's socioeconomic
status," Perani said.
Warma responded, saying, "If
there are people with different cir
cumstances who want to run, they
will find away."

Discussion of the bill was sus
pended until next week.

Internal Development Chair
Also discussed on previous no
tice was a bill proposing the ap
pointment of a Senate internal de
velopment chair to plan social
events for the Senate. The bill, au
thored by Perani, would select Pat
Bruny 'l3 as this year's inaugural
chair.

Both Perani and Bruny ex
pressed a demonstrated need for
Senators to interact outside of their
official duties.

"Us understanding each other as
people is essential to the way we
work together," Perani said, adding
she hopes the bill, if passed, will af
fect future years.
When Minh Dan Vuong 'll re
minded the Senate to set an appro
priate balance between work and

play. Senator Will Seaton 'l3 said so
cial events will be considered addi
tional to normal working hours.

Green Events Consulting

ASSU executive chair of sus
tainability Theo Gibbs 'll and co
president of Students for a Sustain
able Stanford (SSS) Molly Oshun
'll presented to the Senate Tues
day on Green Events Consulting, a
new ASSU and SSS initiative de-

signed to help student groups
"green" their events. A pilot pro

gram debuting this winter quarter
will grant seven to 10 volunteer stu
dent organizations the opportunity
to meet one-on-one with green
events consultants in an effort to
follow the Green Events Checklist,
a list of guiding criteria for event
sustainability.
The Senate passed all of the
evening's funding bills and budget
modifications.
