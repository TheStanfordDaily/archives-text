# Why student-athletes should not be paid
## 
### Kabir Sawhney 
After a summer of shocking revelations concerning pay
ments by professional agents to prospects still in col
lege, a recent article in Sports Illustrated rocked the
college football world yet again. Josh Luchs, a former
NFL agent, detailed the inner workings of the system
and admitted to paying dozens of college players during his career in
order to persuade them to sign with his representation firm when
they entered the NFL Draft. Luchs' story, combined with the scan
dals at numerous programs, has led to new calls for the NCAA and
the NFL to crack down on agent payments to players.

The Luchs story also
added fresh fuel to an age
old debate in college
sports: whether universi
ties should pay student
athletes.
In his interviews with
SI, Luchs said the vast ma
jority of payments aren't

huge gifts. Agents' commissions are limited to 3 percent, so only the
top 10 or so draft picks will sign large enough contracts to justify big
payouts.
Many of these players took the money not because they were
greedy, but because they needed it to buy food or make car pay
ments, for example. Many college football players don't come from
advantaged backgrounds, and because of their commitments to
football, they can't take part-time jobs to pay for everyday expenses.
Thus, when an agent comes around offering money, players are often
happy to take it.
The answer championed by some commentators is for every
football program to give its players a small stipend so they won't
have to take money from agents. This seems like a logical solution to
the issue at hand. Players will not have as strong an incentive to take
money from agents since their basic needs will be taken care of.
However, I still disagree with the idea of paying college football
players.
For starters, some football players are already paid quite a lot of
money in the form of full scholarships. I pay upward of $50,000 a year
to attend Stanford. Athletes on full scholarships pay nothing while
receiving the same education I do. Of course, these players deserve
the full scholarships; I am merely pointing out that there is a pretty
significant value associated with them.
Athletes are also basically receiving free training to improve their
on-field performance, which pays significant dividends when they
leave for the pros. Under a single scholarship, football players are re
ceiving both a standard education, which they can utilize if they enter
the regular workforce, and a "football education," which is necessary
to make those millions of dollars in the NFL.
In summary, many athletes are already receiving quite a lot for
free. While the value of this education might not compare to the
salaries available in the pros, no one is advocating for college football
players to be paid at the same level as their NFL counterparts.
But it still doesn't solve the problem close to the heart of the agent
issue: the lack of means to pay for basics that drives many athletes to
take the cash.
To me, this problem seems to break down into two distinct cate
gories: what I'll call "basic living needs," like food, housing and books,
and "other expenses," like car payments.
Universities should definitely cover expenses in the first catego
ry for football players. A full scholarship should cover tuition, room
and board, so these athletes should have their meals, rent and school
expenses paid for. If scholarships aren't covering these types of
things, then they should be expanded to include them.
This brings us to the other category of expenses. A recent article
on ESPNLosAngeles.com helped to shed some light on this issue as
well. In it, former USC head coach John Robinson talked about
some of the problems his players faced.
"That was one of the toughest things for me as a head coach, was
the kid who was stressed for whatever reason," Robinson told the
website. "His girlfriend was pregnant, his parents were this or that, he
had a car and couldn't make the payment."
Call me coldhearted.but I really don't have all that much sympa
thy for someone who gets himself into trouble by making poor choic
es. If you don't have the income to make car payments but go ahead
and buy a car anyway asking your university for a stipend to pay for
it is something I just can't endorse. Likewise, if you don't have any
money, getting your girlfriend pregnant is a stupid move.
Maybe college football players should be required to take a class
in personal finance. It might help them manage their money better
and avoid the pressures of agent cash.
It might even be a good idea to allow football players to take out
loans against their future NFL earnings. Similar to a student loan,
they could take out money now and pay it off later. It legally achieves
the same basic idea as the agent payoff cashing in on your future
potential while you're still in college.
So there you have it: my case against giving football players
stipends. They're already receiving a pretty valuable education, both
on and off the field. Their scholarships should cover basic living
needs, and if they don't, universities need to expand them so they do.
And it's not their schools' responsibility to bail them out when they
get themselves in financial hot water.
Even if this solution doesn't staunch the flow of agent cash to ath
letes, we can at

least shift the
blame away
from "the sys
â€¢ tern" and place it
squarely on
greed, both from
the agents and
players, with a sprin
kling of poor deci
sion-making in there for good
measure.
Kabir Sawhney will teach that fi
nance class if it means that football
players will finally pay attention to
him. Request enrollment at ksawh
