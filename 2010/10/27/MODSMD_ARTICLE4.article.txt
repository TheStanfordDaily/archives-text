## Carter visits local bookstore 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€” Melanie Scheible 
Former President Jimmy Carter came to Kepler's
Books in Menlo Park Tuesday to promote his latest
book, "White House Diary."
Hundreds who had bought tickets to the event were
admitted, according to the event coordinator Paul Pe
tersen. More onlookers without tickets peered through
the windows to catch a glimpse of the former president.
Though Carter left office with a 34 percent approval
rating in 1980, those who attended the event were
drawn by their admiration of Carter.
"I thought he was a great president," local resident
Denise Gerber said. "This is the first time I've ever met

a president and I'm honored."
"In my eyes, especially after he left office, he's done
such wonderful things with his life for other people,"
local resident Vicki Brooks said. "He should be a role
model for everybody."
In addition to signing approximately 1,500 books in
two hours, Carter also fielded questions from the press.
Carter said he was rooting for the Giants, and spoke
briefly about how income disparity will become an in
creasingly large problem in the 21st century.
When asked about whom he was supporting in the
California gubernatorial race, Carter cast his support
for Democratic candidate Jerry Brown.
"I liked Brown then, and I like Brown now," Carter
said.
