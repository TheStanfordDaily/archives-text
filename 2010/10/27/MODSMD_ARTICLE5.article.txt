# Researcher talks culture, eating
## Chef, researcher visit Stanford to discuss obesity prevention 
### JULIA BROWNELL SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Claus Meyer, the founder and co
owner of Restaurant magazine's
number one-rated restaurant in the
world, and Arne Astrup, a leading
obesity researcher from the Universi
ty of Copenhagen, sat down with a
group in Tresidder on Tuesday to talk
about the New Nordic Diet as away
to promote healthy eating.
The talk, entitled "Eat Right
Now," was part of a two-day confer
ence, "Future of Flealth Innovation,"
on health innovation in Denmark and
the United States.
Meyer and Astrup spoke on how
they are attempting to address the
problem of obesity in Europe through
their new approach to food, which
they call the New Nordic Diet. The
diet involves using local food in
home-cooked meals that bring peo
ple together to enjoy healthful eating.
In Denmark, that meant embracing
traditional Arctic cuisine.
The diet is the cornerstone of
Meyer's restaurant, Noma, run by
head chef Rene Redzepi. In its 2010
contest, Restaurant magazine voted
Noma the best restaurant in the
world. The menu features local
Nordic food and brings out tradition
al flavors as part of a healthful cuisine.
"We wrote in our first menu that
we wanted to create a brand new
Nordic cuisine that embraced the
Arctic world," said Meyer. "Rene had
trained with the best chefs in the
world, and I had an idea of how to
begin the New Nordic style."
Meyer's culinary work intersected
with Astrup's scholarship on prob
lems of obesity. Astrup is former
chairman of the International Associ
ation for the Study of Obesity and one
of the most cited obesity scholars in
the world. However, in many of his in
tervention studies, people who left the
structured study environment would
tend to regain the weight.
Drop-out patients "tend to regain
and relapse," Astrup said. He blamed
that on the fact that losing weight was
an act of deprivation and hardship for

patients who would forgo delicious
food.

Hence, Astrup began to collabo
rate with Meyer, using his New
Nordic cuisine as away to promote
sustained healthy eating in his ran
domized trials. He wanted to test
whether the New Nordic food would
actually work, and so in one small
study he randomized one group to a
New Nordic cooking class and anoth
er to a control no-class measure. His
observation of classes and final results
made him a believer.
The subjects in the cooking class
"were having a lot of fun," he said.
"For me at that time having a lot of
fun was incompatible with decreasing
your food intake. The drop-out rate
was only 4 percent in the cooking
group, but 25 percent in the control
group ... maybe this could prevent
them [from] going to their old eating
habits."
Astrup is now conducting a multi
site school intervention to help com
bat childhood obesity in Denmark
and around Europe.
Denmark "actually had a diet that
