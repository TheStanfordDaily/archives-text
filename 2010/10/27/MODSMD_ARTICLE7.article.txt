## Flu shot availability increases 
### ANH NGUYENDANG 
Ongoing flu clinics organized by the Vaden
Health Center are administering flu shots free of
charge to Stanford students and their spouses or
domestic partners, faculty, staff and retirees. The
seven clinics so far this year have also offered flu
shots to spouses or domestic partners of staff and
faculty members for $25.
With the flu season fast approaching, Vaden
gives out the shots as an attempt to reduce the in
cidence of respiratory diseases for the individual
students and the Stanford community. This year's
vaccine includes the immunization for H3N2,
HINI and Influenza B.The shots are administered
in temporary clinics set up by Vaden in Wilbur
Dining Hall, Lakeside Dining Hall and Graduate
Community Center, as well as at Vaden.
The collaboration among Vaden, Stanford Uni
versity Occupational Health Center, School of
Medicine physician faculty and medical school
student volunteers made the clinics possible by
hosting the clinics and administering the shots.
Stanford Benefits, BeWell @ Stanford and the

Health Improvement Program (HIP) contributed
in publicizing the free shots to students.
This year, on average, about 300 shots have
been administered at each of the clinics, compared
to last year's total of 2,100 shots, when the limited
supply of flu vaccines meant that only high-risk in
dividuals could receive the shot.

However, according to Clinic Manager Nancy
Masunaga, who spoke on behalf of Vaden Health
Center director Ira Friedman, more vaccines are

available this year compared to last year. Masuna
ga said Vaden's goal is to double the number of
shots given last year.
"We should see a larger number of people im
munized," Masunaga said.
These clinics are funded by two different
sources. The Provost's Office covered the cost of
the shots administered to students and their

this year free of charge at Vaden Health Center's clinics scheduled now through December.
