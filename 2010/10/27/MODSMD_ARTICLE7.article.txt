## Flu shot availability increases 
### ANH NGUYENDANG 
Ongoing flu clinics organized by the Vaden
Health Center are administering flu shots free of
charge to Stanford students and their spouses or
domestic partners, faculty, staff and retirees. The
seven clinics so far this year have also offered flu
shots to spouses or domestic partners of staff and
faculty members for $25.
With the flu season fast approaching, Vaden
gives out the shots as an attempt to reduce the in
cidence of respiratory diseases for the individual
students and the Stanford community. This year's
vaccine includes the immunization for H3N2,
HINI and Influenza B.The shots are administered
in temporary clinics set up by Vaden in Wilbur
Dining Hall, Lakeside Dining Hall and Graduate
Community Center, as well as at Vaden.
The collaboration among Vaden, Stanford Uni
versity Occupational Health Center, School of
Medicine physician faculty and medical school
student volunteers made the clinics possible by
hosting the clinics and administering the shots.
Stanford Benefits, BeWell @ Stanford and the

Health Improvement Program (HIP) contributed
in publicizing the free shots to students.
This year, on average, about 300 shots have
been administered at each of the clinics, compared
to last year's total of 2,100 shots, when the limited
supply of flu vaccines meant that only high-risk in
dividuals could receive the shot.

However, according to Clinic Manager Nancy
Masunaga, who spoke on behalf of Vaden Health
Center director Ira Friedman, more vaccines are

available this year compared to last year. Masuna
ga said Vaden's goal is to double the number of
shots given last year.
"We should see a larger number of people im
munized," Masunaga said.
These clinics are funded by two different
sources. The Provost's Office covered the cost of
the shots administered to students and their

sources paid for the flu shots given to
staff and faculty.
Though Masunaga did not give
the exact cost to run the clinics, she
said the amount varies each year de
pending on the number of staff pres
ent at each clinic. Volunteer medical
students donating their time also mit
igate the costs, Masunaga said.
The frequency of the flu clinics
makes it easy for many students, such
as Zenas Lee 'll, to drop by for a vac
cination.

Lee called the process "quick and
easy."

"I just happened to be at Vaden for
another reason and saw that they
were giving out free flu shots, so I just
got mine right away," Lee said. "It
took maybe about one minute to fill
out the form and then one minute to
get the shot."
Lee also got vaccinated in order to
lessen the chance of an epidemic. "I
know that there's a critical vaccina
tion threshold to prevent the season
al flu from being an epidemic," Lee
said. "I try to do it every year... It
was great that it was free this year."
Aside from getting the flu shots,
Nancy Masunaga recommended that
students cover their coughs and wash
their hands often to prevent the
spread of germs and viruses that
cause respiratory diseases. "If you
have flu symptoms, call the Medical

Advice Nurse as soon as possible to
see if there are medications that
could be helpful to you," Masunaga
said.

Sixteen more flu vaccine clinics
will occur between Wednesday and
Dec. 13 at various locations and
times, according to the University's
flu information website, flu.stan
ford.edu.
