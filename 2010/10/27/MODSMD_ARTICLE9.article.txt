## FULL FRONTAL ON THE QUAD 
### JARON MOORE 
Legend has it that back in the day, when the
first full moon came, two lines of students
would form in front of Memorial Church.
Seniors donning coy smiles held roses in one
line. In the other, freshmen waited to be
kissed and complete their matriculation.
The lines and lips met at midnight, and with the
passing of a rose, the senior class welcomed freshmen
to Stanford under a full moon.

That was more than a century ago. Nowadays, Full
Moon on the Quad has evolved into an event that
bucks all tradition. After a full day of reflection on the
event, students are telling their stories, sometimes in
credulously. As Citlalli Sandoval 'l4 asked, "What
would my grandma say?"
They recall Monday night: to start off, a crowd
forms in front of Old Union. Seniors, some donning
only body paint, hold freshman-dorm bingo cards.
Freshmen wait to hear Super Mash Bros and forget

their midterms.

Steadily the crowd grows as students pile into the
courtyard of Old Union. Super Mash Bros mount the
stage and project a modified Lakers logo onto the
building.
"Stanford, how you feeling?" the performers ask,
receiving a unanimous, barbaric "yawp" in reply, and
the party begins with a video of a space-shuttle
launch.
Frenetic music bounces off the architecture that
houses the dancing undergrade The concert provides
students their first chance to pair off, and between
songs some begin the night's infamous activity a bit
prematurely.
After an hour, the temperature in Old Union is
noticeably nearer to 98.6 degrees. Super Mash Bros
exit the stage.
"Have fun at your makeout session," they say to
the incandescent crowd, and the Leland Stanford Ju
nior University Marching Band takes over where
they leave off.
Pouring out of Old Union and into White Plaza,

students listen to the Band's loud cacophony. Some
sport costumes, others dress casually, and still others
wear nothing at all.
Soon, they're all headed for the Main Quad. While
procuring "consent is sexy" stickers, students wel
come Full Moon on the Quad back to Stanford under
a waning gibbous moon.
Hundreds of participants shuffle in past the lime
green-shirted "sober monitors" tasked with keeping
out crowd members who lack SUfDs. Peer health ed
ucators hand out Hershey's kisses at tables covered in
condoms and mouthwash. Cops roam the perimeter.
The dancing tree sways in the center of the amor
phous group of students from all four classes.
There's no countdown to midnight or any indica
tion of when to begin kissing, but the kissing starts
just the same. Bingo cards composed of dorm names
provide a challenge for certain participants looking
to make out with a freshman from each.

By the end of the night, the ground is covered with
fake roses and the crowd has dwindled. In the morn
ing, the Quad will return to its main function as the

academic nucleus of the University, but for a few
more moments, all tradition is dead.
Or maybe not all tradition. Did this iconoclastic
Full Moon on the Quad event provide freshmen an
adequate welcome to Stanford? A few weigh in.
"The event was hyped up and failed to meet my
expectations," said Daniela Parra 'l4. "Not many
people actually wanted to kiss, and they were just
standing around."
"It wasn't as bad as I expected it to be," said
Amanda McFarlane 'l4. "I was expecting this huge
orgy."
Victoria Virasingh 'l4 wondered, "What's up with
all the naked people?"
"The naked people make it," countered Duncan
Lindsey 'l4. "There's an awesome Stanfordian ridicu
lousness that is necessary to not take ourselves and
everyone else seriously for one night."
And "other than the herpes," said Dan Thompson
'l3, "it was great."
