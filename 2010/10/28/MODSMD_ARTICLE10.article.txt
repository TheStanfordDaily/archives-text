## GSC considers campaign spending bill 
### ANNA SCHUESSLER STAFF WRITER 
At this week's Graduate Student Council
meeting, voting members commended student
group collaboration, the approval of a new Law
School representative and the power of debate.
The meeting opened, as it usually does, with the
evaluation of student group requests for funding,
but this week, the group found it had fewer student
group events to approve for funding than it nor
mally does, as the Diwali festival was being sup
ported by three student groups instead of one. The
GSC has been encouraging collaboration among
student groups during their programming plan
ning in the hopes of streamlining some of the fund
ing it dedicates to student activities. The group was
pleased to see this level of collaboration between
graduate and undergraduate groups, among which
are Sanskriti and the Stanford India Association.

"Can I just commend these groups for working
together on this event?" said Imeh Williams, the
GSC's education representative. The groups plan
ning the Diwali celebration, which is a five-day
Hindu festival of lights, were also recognized for
their willingness to work within the line item caps.
The group welcomed Tom Spahn, a third-year
law student, to its ranks after a brief questioning
period and a group vote. The GSC has been oper
ating without a representative from the Law
School and was excited to have Spahn on board.
"I thought it was a good way to learn about the
University and bridge the gap between the Law
School and the rest of the graduate student body,"
Spahn said. He will be sworn into the GSC at next
week's meeting.

ASSU Executives Kelsei Wharton 'l2 and An
gelina Cardona 'll attended Wednesday night's
meeting to update the GSC on undergraduate
programming and explain their elections bill,

which the two proposed to ASSU Undergraduate
Senate on Tuesday. Designed to make running for
student government positions more accessible for
a greater part of the student population, the bill
would include, among other measures, a $750 cap
on campaign spending for candidates applying for
public financing.

Some expressed hesitation for such a measure,
arguing that the bill would be too invasive to stu
dents' budgets. The majority of the GSC, however,
seemed to support the bill.

"We should have a bill that supports good cam
paigns, not rich campaigns," said Fanuel Muindi, a
proxy for Drew Kennedy.

"The point is about education, it's not about
winning," said council member Krystal St. Julien.
"We're talking about who has the most drive to in
novate and do the most for the school."
