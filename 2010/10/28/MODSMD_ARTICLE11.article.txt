## EDITORIAL Vote no on misleading Proposition 23 
### 
Proposition 23, if passed, would suspend
California AB 32, also know as the Glob
al Warming Act of 2006, until the unem
ployment level in California is below 5.5 per
cent for four consecutive quarters. AB 32 re
quired that by 2020 California drop green
house gas emissions levels to the levels that
were emitted in 1990, which correlated to ap
proximately a 25 percent reduction in green
house gas emissions. The act did not present
specific enforcement mechanisms, but it did
provide for the creation of a state board with
the authority to create and enforce such mech
anisms.
Opponents of AB 32 claim the provisions
for lowering greenhouse gas emissions will
prevent small businesses from expanding and
will prevent the creation of jobs in California.
Keeping with this logic, proponents of Propo
sition 23 have dubbed their campaign the
"California Jobs Initiative."
Proponents of AB 32 laud California for
being one of the first states in the country to
codify a law requiring the reduction of green
house gas emissions. They believe that reduc
ing California's greenhouse emissions is of ut
most importance and have reacted vehement
ly against out-of-state companies that have
contributed financially to the "Yes on 23" cam
paign, most notably the Texas-based oil com
panies Valero andTesoro.
The editorial board unanimously opposes
Proposition 23 because the regulations im
posed by AB 32 are necessary for the well
being California and because the provisions of
the proposition are intentionally misleading.
The debate about Proposition 23 is not a parti
san one; politicians from across the political
spectrum have come out against Proposition
23, including Republican Gov. Schwarzeneg
ger and the two leading gubernatorial candi

dates. Democrat Jerry Brown and Republican
Meg Whitman (although Whitman has said
she would suspend AB 32). Stanford's own
George Shultz, secretary of state to Ronald
Reagan, is co-chairing the "No on 23" commis
sion.
Additionally, the editorial board would like
to direct California voters to "The Most Ex
pensive Thing California Can Do Is Nothing,"
an open letter signed by more than 100 econo
mists in support of AB 32, included among
them Stanford's Nobel Prize-winning profes
sor Kenneth Arrow. This is legislation that has
a broad range of support across the aisle and
across academia. This ill-founded proposition
could only dream of mustering such support.
Proposition 23 is framed to appear as a rea
sonable bill, setting a maximum level of unem
ployment for the state to allow for the green
house gas emission restrictions to remain in
place. However, the unemployment condi
tions provided in Proposition 23 are ludicrous.
The unemployment level in California is 12.4
percent and the state of the economy indicates
that it probably won't change significantly in
the immediate future. Then, the requirement
that unemployment remain below that level
for four consecutive quarters would mean the
emissions regulations would not be allowed to
operate for another year following the eco
nomic recovery. If passed. Proposition 23
would effectively kill AB 32, negating work
that the state emissions board has already
done and derailing popular sentiment for the
reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.
Proposition 23 is an attempt to fool Califor
nians byway of economic deceit into repealing
a law that already had popular acceptance. It is
in the best interest of the environment and the
residents of California to vote no on Proposi
tion 23.
