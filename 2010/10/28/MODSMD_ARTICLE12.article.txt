# FOREIGN CORRESPONDENCE
## An Odd Jump Across the Pond

different writer each week discuss his or her ex
perience abroad.

OXFORD, England One month ago, I
stepped off the plane at London
Heathrow Airport and took the bus to
Oxford University.This was it: the beginning of
a quarter at one of the most prestigious univer
sities in the world, something no one would let
me forget whenever I told them I was headed
to Oxford for a couple months. It's the same
kind of reaction that makes me tell people I go
to school in "northern California... oh, the
Bay Area ..." It's frustrating, because it's not
like I'm trying to brag. But I digress. You know
what that's like.
I've spent the last month adjusting to the
differences between Stanford and Oxford.
Previous students had warned us about Ox
ford's particular quirks, but you really can't un
derstand until you're here and experiencing it
for yourself.
Take the library system. At Stanford, I drop
by Green with a list of a couple books for a
paper, and leave with twice as many as I came
for, a great perk of being able to browse the
shelves. The Bodleian library stacks, which
hold a copy of every book published in the
U.K. for the last howevermany hundred years,
are underground, and the librarians use a train
to go get your books. That's right, a train.
Therefore, no stacks browsing, as much as I'd
like to ride that train. And because the
Bodleian is a reference library, you can't check
out any books. None. They have a copy of every
Harry Potter, but if you want to read one, you
have to have it sent to one of the reading
rooms, and then you can sit there and read it.
When you're done for the day (which you have
to be by 10 p.m., because that's when the li
brary closes), you give the book to the librari
an, who puts it on the reserve shelf. You can go
back and pick it up as long as you have it re
served, and you can renew it, but you cannot
leave with it.
This drives me crazy. Sure, it's nice when
someone has the book I want and I can just go
borrow it if they're not using it. But honestly
how many times has the book I've wanted been
checked out at Stanford? Maybe three times in
the last two years. And then I just recall it and all
is well. At Stanford, I don't mind working in the
library, but tell me I can't work anywhere else
and suddenly that's all I want to do.
Don't get me wrong. I like it here. There are
things that frustrate me, like the library system
or the fact that the dining hall is only open for

45 minutes at lunch, but other things I'm really
enjoying, like my tutorial.
Now, the tutorial system does have its pros
and cons. Basically, I meet with my tutor, a Fel
low in the Oxford Center for Islamic Studies,
every Monday for an hour. In that time, I read
him the paper I wrote the previous week, he
gives me feedback, we discuss for a little bit
and then we talk about what I'm going to do
next week. Each tutor has his or her own re
quirements, but everyone is basically writing a
five- to 10-page paper each week. When I first
heard about this, I thought this sounded insane
... and then I actually thought about it. I got to
pick the exact topic I wanted to study for
me, contemporary issues of gender in Islam, a
topic I'm having trouble finding classes about
at Stanford. Then, I spend my week reading
books about a related topic, and then write a
paper. It's a pretty sweet deal.
Other than my tutorial, I'm only taking one
five unit class, on soccer and English society.
It's taught by Stanford professor Bob Sinclair,
who is British and very passionate about soc
cer. With these two classes combined, I have
four hours of class a week. I spend some of the
rest of my time reading, and the rest however I
want. I can do work whenever it's convenient
for me, and spend any time I want exploring
and experiencing Oxford culture. I like having
this much freedom in my schedule ... but it
will be nice to come back to the familiarity of
the Farm.
Oxford is a very different experience than
Stanford, in both good and bad ways. But I
think that's the whole point of studying
abroad, and what the Bings are trying to ac
complish when they so generously fund these
trips giving us a chance to experience some
thing completely different than what we get in
the Stanford bubble.
