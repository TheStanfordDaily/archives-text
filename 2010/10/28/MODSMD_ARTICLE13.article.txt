# THIS COLUMN IS IRONIC
## Well, Thank God That's Over 
### Shane Savitsky 
Good job, everyone! We made it. Anoth
er Reunion Homecoming Weekend
down. We all woke up Monday morning
to a campus commute hampered only by the
usual limb-mangling bike accidents. No more
trying to dash past confused alums while furi
ously running to math lecture. None of us will
have to experience this madness again until
that horrifying weekend in April when ProFros
descend on Stanford like locusts from some
biblical plague.
I mean, let's face it: Reunion Homecoming
is nothing more than Admit Weekend for
alums. They come back to campus after years
away to gawk at all of the new buildings and
reminisce of days gone by. Yet, really, they just
end up being another obstacle for me to bike
around. I mean, seriously, there are enough
Asian tourists on campus trying to photograph
Stanford students on a daily basis. Do we really
need alumni getting in on the act as well?
I can forgive those alums from the classes of
'6O or '7O who ventured back to the Farm this
past weekend for such a heinous transgression.
After all, I'm pretty sure Herbert Hoover was
still in his junior year while they were on cam
pus. The most irritating technology they had to
contend with during their time here was Sigma
Chi blasting 'The Entertainer" for the thou
sandth time on the campus' sole phonograph.
They really don't know any better.
No, it's those of you from the class of'os that
Em looking at right now. Come on, guys. You
only graduated five years ago. Facebook was
around when you were here. Let's come to
grips with this: your time at Stanford just wasn't
that long ago. Is it that difficult to leave this
place? Half of you probably co-termed, too. I'm
sure you have better things to do at Goldman
Sachs or your consulting firm. It's kind of tough
to relive your glory days doing body shots at
Sigma Nu when you were just there as a
sketchy grad student a few months ago. I know

the real world is hard (or so I hear I don't
want to be there yet), but you don't have to clog
up the Circle of Death when I'm late for class.
When it comes down to it, I'm really not al
lowed to say any of these things. I'm violating
one of the central tenets of being a Stanford
student: know how to network. Why do you
think Stanford is a top-tier school? Sure, we're
smart, but there must be something else that re
ally sets us apart. It takes a little more than
sheer brainpower to overcome the 7-percent
acceptance rate here a stat that's plummet
ing more than the Dow Jones Index every year.
It just so happens that all of us here had that lit
tle something extra: we know how to present
ourselves.

In the end, I like to think this is why Reunion

Homecoming exists. It's not for our alums to
step back on campus and relive their glory days.
("Hey Bob, remember that time our buddy El
drick from the golf team had a foursome with
those girls from the water polo team? Christ,
whatever happened to that guy? He was such a
bro.") No, Reunion Homecoming is here to
make sure we know how to schmooze. More
specifically, it's here to make sure that seniors
haven't forgotten how to schmooze.
Think of things this way: seniors are only
one step away from the real world. Right now,
they're running around trying to snag a job or
get into grad school. Deadlines are bearing
down pretty quickly. Problem is, it's been a
good four years since they had to schmooze
their way into Stanford. They're rusty. They've
been stuck in dead-end internships or the cubi
cles of a research project for the past four years.
By the time senior year rolls around, Stanford
students have just forgotten the benefits of net
working. Here lies the beauty of Reunion
Homecoming, my friends. It affords these sen
iors a chance to hobnob with the Fortune 500
CEOs and Supreme Court justices that Stan
ford churns out at an alarmingly fast pace.
Luckily, as a junior, I still have ample time to
relax. I don't think there's any need to hone my
real-world skills just yet. I still have another
year before my time comes. Sophomores and
freshmen aren't you all still taking IHUM?
Get back to that. You don't really need to worry
about this for a while. But remember: when you
crash into that old guy with a nametag while
biking during some weekend next October,
make sure to get his business card before they
load him into the ambulance. It could really
work out for you.

Dear alums: if you find Shane at all entertaining
or funny and would like to offer him a really great
internship for this summer, then e-mail him atsav
itsky@stanford. edu.

Homecoming
is Admit Weekend
for alums.
