# THE

## Bachelor of Music 
### Lucas Will Johnson 
Stanford, there is away to show you're
truly committed to the arts, and you're
not doing it yet. We have scores of musi
cal students, some cutting edge computer
music research, and we're on our way to hav
ing a world-class concert hall. But for under
graduates, the best we have academically is a
B.A. with a major in music. I say it's time to
step up to the next level and offer an under
graduate performance degree.
Think about it. We could create a bigger
core community of students playing music
full-time. Rather than having just a handful of
majors alongside a lot of recreational players,
we would add in some kids looking to go pro.
They would populate music groups with some
stellar musicianship. At performances, their
skill would raise the level of everyone else
and encourage higher-quality music in gener
al. Not to mention, fully implementing a per
formance degree would probably require a
serious expansion of the music department.
Because at this point, the more resources and
opportunities we have for musicians on cam
pus, the better.
Aside from the obvious improvements to
our music scene, there's a compelling argu
ment in terms of diversity. Stanford admits all
kinds of whiz kids, but doesn't offer degrees
equally across interests. Yes, we have some se
rious musicians. You've seen the ones with in
tensive piano training who practice in the
lounges, or the people who played in intense
youth orchestras and high school marching
bands. But if we had a mini Stanford conser
vatory, it would add a new kind of full-time
specialist student to the mix. We've got the fa
cilities to further train and develop world
class students in endeavors from athletics to
computer science. If we can pursue the pinna
cle of performance in sports, business and
public service, why not in music? There is no
rule saying that universities like ours have to
relegate the arts to a token status.
Yet that is precisely what they do. Yale,
Harvard, Princeton, Stanford, MIT, Berkeley
(to take a brief survey) offer no bachelor per-

formance degrees for music. They all admit
talented students and have plenty of music
options on campus. But none of us elevate our
undergraduate music offerings to a profes
sional level.

This issue gets into the role of an under
graduate education. Is it just to memorize in
formation and gain some analytical abilities,
or is it to learn technical skills for specific pro
fessions? I've heard people say your particu
lar undergrad degree doesn't matter as much
as the specialization you get from grad
school. Stanford encourages a broad ap
proach, with a number of general education
requirements that everyone, no matter their
specialty, must take. But we can clearly obtain
all kinds of technical training too, as evi
denced by the seniors I know accepting jobs
at place like Google, or Toby Gerhart going to

the NFL.
Is money the reason? It's not a mystery
how the GSB was able to fund an entirely
new campus for itself. If Stanford were to
pump out music degrees, those graduates
would never make the same kind of money as
an Arrillaga or a Hewlett on a musician's
salary. Stanford just can't expect the same
kind of return on its investment from its mu
sician alumni.

But imagine also if society's musicians
weren't exclusively trained at cloistered
music academies. How about rooming a fu
ture Wynton Marsalis with the next William
Rehnquist? Admissions departments shape
the networks of the future there might be
unrealized societal benefits from adding
more musicians into the Stanford family.
I'm not suggesting that it would be simple
or cheap to implement a performance degree.
It would require more music faculty, more
classrooms and more practice areas, which
would mean some significant fundraising.
Then there are admissions complications.
Usually an audition is the central component
of an application to a conservatory some
one would have to decide how to factor that
in. And does Stanford then accept more mu
sicians at the expense of the others it would
normally admit? Or do we grow the class?
For regular music majors, would the music de
partment then relegate them to a second-tier
status, giving them less attention? The poli
tics, logistics and fairness of the situation are
not straightforward.
Nonetheless, an undergraduate perform
ance degree, I think, would clearly benefit
music at Stanford and beyond. We would
have performers in greater quantity and qual
ity, giving the arts and humanities more voice,
not only at this powerhouse of technology
and athletics, but among the academy and in
society.

Lucas would still major in public policy any
ways, but he's open to comments at
lucaswj@stanford. edu.

It's time to offer an
undergraduate
performance
degree.
