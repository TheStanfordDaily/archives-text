## It's all about the statistics 
### Jacob Jaffe Fields of Failure 
I love stats. No, not sample propor
tions, Z-scores and standard de
viations. We're talking OPS,
quarterback rating and plus
minus. Who needs median test
score when you can have opponents'
free-throw percentage (a stat that
roughly translates to luck)?
For as long as I can remember, I've
obsessed over the facts and figures in
every sport I watch. Even if I didn't
watch a Bucks game all year, I would
still find it fascinating that no Milwau
kee player had done X, Y and Z against
the Clippers since Kareem Abdul-Jab
bar in 1973, way back when they were
the Buffalo Braves. I routinely told my
uninterested friends and family about
the latest person to reach the 23 home
run-11 steal-61 walk-,985 fielding per
centage milestone or the first multi
homer game by a player with the last
name ending in "son" as part of a week
end day-night doubleheader in inter
league play.
Despite the clear social deficiencies
I have from being so absorbed by statis
tics, I still follow them obsessively.
When I find out that Arizona backup
quarterback Matt Scott had a more ef
ficient game against Washington than
starter Nick Foles has ever had, or that
Stanford has had more players score a
touchdown than any team in the coun
try, I still run around telling anyone I
can find.

So what is the point of all these
stats? What can they really tell you?
Well, there is a saying that you can
make statistics say whatever you want.
To some extent, this is true, although
some arguments (Washington State is a
better football team than Oregon,
Mark Ingram deserved the Heisman
Trophy over Toby Gerhart last year,
Jake Locker is a better quarterback
than Andrew Luck, etc.) require a little
more work for the arguer than others.

Most situations allow for statistical
arguments on both sides, such as who
will win the World Series or whether or
not Brett Favre should keep the start
ing quarterback job. With this in mind,
here are statistical reasons why Stan
ford will beat Washington and reasons
why it won't.
A quick look at the basic stats gives
a significant advantage to the Cardinal.
On the NCAA's website, each team is
ranked in 17 statistical categories
scoring, total, passing, rushing, passing
efficiency and sack averages for both
offense and defense, punting average,
punt and kick return average, tackles
for loss and turnover margin. Of these
17, Stanford ranks in the top half of the
Pac-10 in 12 and is only in the bottom

three in punting, punt returning and
tackles for loss. Meanwhile, Washing
ton is in the top half in just one catego
ry (fourth in sacks allowed) and is in
the bottom three in nine categories, in
cluding all-important scoring offense
and scoring defense.
In fact, the only categories in which
Washington leads Stanford are punt
ing, punt returning and tackles for loss,
and the Huskies are no more than two
spots above the Cardinal in any of the
three. The records of both teams sup
port these statistics, as Stanford is 6-1
(4-0 at home, 2-1 on the road) while
Washington is 3-4 (2-2 at home, 1-2 on
the road).
The Cardinal appears to have a fair
ly significant edge in all the major cate
gories (70 more yards per game, 62
fewer yards per game allowed, 18 more
points per game and nine fewer points
per game allowed). However, looking
more closely, Stanford's statistics are
somewhat inflated by its early season
play, while its recent numbers have
been much weaker.

After its first four games, Stanford
ranked in the top three in the Pac-10 in
11 of the 17 categories, and was in the
top 20 in the nation in 10 of them, in
cluding passing efficiency defense, total
defense and scoring defense. Then the
Cardinal played Oregon, USC and
Washington State, and the defense got
shredded. Stanford allowed 115 points
and 926 passing yards in those three
games, and it has shown in its overall

rankings. The Cardinal is now in the top
20 nationally in only five categories,
and is no better than 58th in passing ef
ficiency defense, total defense and
scoring defense.
These holes in the Stanford second
ary have been widening with the injury
to starting strong safety Delano How
ell, and Washington could expose them
this weekend. Despite middling 2010
stats (eighth in the Pac-10 in passing ef
ficiency), Jake Locker has been much
better of late. Following an embarrass
ing performance against Nebraska in
September (4-20 passing, two intercep
tions), Locker has been in better form,
completing 60 percent of his passes
over the last four games with eight
touchdowns and only one interception
in that span.
The Cardinal defense was able to
shut down Locker last year, but much
of that success was due to Howell, who
picked off Locker twice in that game,
and an injury to Locker. If Howell does
not play, and if the defense plays the
way it has of late, Stanford could be in
for a tough contest. Husky Stadium has
not been kind to opponents over the
years, and the Cardinal is no exception.
Stanford is only 6-21 against Washing
ton since 1977 and lost 12 straight
meetings in Seattle from 1983 to 2003.
On the other hand, you could look
at recent results and see that Stanford
has won at Husky Stadium each of its
last two trips and has beaten Washing
ton four of the past five times the teams
have met.

It's all in the way you look at the
numbers. The oddsmakers have set
their number at seven, the expected
margin of victory for Stanford. But the
numbers that really matter, the points

on the scoreboard, will have to wait
until Saturday.
