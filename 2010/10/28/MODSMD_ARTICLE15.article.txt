## It's all about the statistics 
### Jacob Jaffe Fields of Failure 
I love stats. No, not sample propor
tions, Z-scores and standard de
viations. We're talking OPS,
quarterback rating and plus
minus. Who needs median test
score when you can have opponents'
free-throw percentage (a stat that
roughly translates to luck)?
For as long as I can remember, I've
obsessed over the facts and figures in
every sport I watch. Even if I didn't
watch a Bucks game all year, I would
still find it fascinating that no Milwau
kee player had done X, Y and Z against
the Clippers since Kareem Abdul-Jab
bar in 1973, way back when they were
the Buffalo Braves. I routinely told my
uninterested friends and family about
the latest person to reach the 23 home
run-11 steal-61 walk-,985 fielding per
centage milestone or the first multi
homer game by a player with the last
name ending in "son" as part of a week
end day-night doubleheader in inter
league play.
Despite the clear social deficiencies
I have from being so absorbed by statis
tics, I still follow them obsessively.
When I find out that Arizona backup
quarterback Matt Scott had a more ef
ficient game against Washington than
starter Nick Foles has ever had, or that
Stanford has had more players score a
touchdown than any team in the coun
try, I still run around telling anyone I
can find.

So what is the point of all these
stats? What can they really tell you?
Well, there is a saying that you can
make statistics say whatever you want.
To some extent, this is true, although
some arguments (Washington State is a
better football team than Oregon,
Mark Ingram deserved the Heisman
Trophy over Toby Gerhart last year,
Jake Locker is a better quarterback
than Andrew Luck, etc.) require a little
more work for the arguer than others.

Most situations allow for statistical
arguments on both sides, such as who
will win the World Series or whether or
not Brett Favre should keep the start
ing quarterback job. With this in mind,
here are statistical reasons why Stan
ford will beat Washington and reasons
why it won't.
A quick look at the basic stats gives
a significant advantage to the Cardinal.
On the NCAA's website, each team is
ranked in 17 statistical categories
scoring, total, passing, rushing, passing
efficiency and sack averages for both
offense and defense, punting average,
punt and kick return average, tackles
for loss and turnover margin. Of these
17, Stanford ranks in the top half of the
Pac-10 in 12 and is only in the bottom
