# BOUNCE BACK
## Women's volleyball looks to regain focus 
### KATHERINE KNOX CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The No. 4 Stanford women's volleyball
team (16-2,7-2 Pac-10) has relinquished its
lead of the Pac-10 after falling to Cal in four
sets in Maples Pavilion last Friday night. A
relentless Pac-10 schedule limits recovery
time, however, as this weekend the second
place Card will hit the road to take on No.
18 Oregon (16-5,4-5) and Oregon State (8-
15,1-8).

The pressure of playing on the road, es
pecially on the notoriously nerve-racking
McArthur Court at Oregon, magnifies con
cerns stemming from Stanford's most re
cent loss.

Although Stanford swept both Oregon
teams, 3-0, at home during their first meet
ings this season, recent precedent indicates
that past matches are no indication of the
turnout the second time around. In the
2009 season, the Card was upset by Oregon
in a five-set thriller in Eugene. The loss
marked one of three ever recorded by
Stanford in a 51-match history with the
Ducks.

For the past few years, Oregon's strate
gy has centered on both the versatility of its
offense and the success of its serving game.
Earlier this month, the Ducks estab
lished senior outside hitter Heather Mey
ers and sophomores Kat Fischer and
Alaina Bergsma as their primary attackers
against the Cardinal. Despite equal set dis
tribution between the hitters, Meyers was
the only Oregon player to post a successful
hitting percentage (.440). The rest were
held in check as Stanford senior libero
Gabi Ailes picked up 18 digs to keep the
Duck offense at bay.

The Ducks lead the Pac-10 in aces, while
Stanford continues to struggle in this
realm, as it rounds out the conference in
10th place. While Meyers tops the confer
ence in aces and Fischer ranks third, nei
ther was able to capitalize on this strength
during the last meeting with Stanford, a tes
tament to the polished serve-receive and
side-out offense by the Cardinal.
Stanford was dominant on offense, av
eraging a .443 hitting percentage across the
three sets to the .225 tallied by Oregon. Se
nior outside hitter Alix Klineman racked
up 17 kills as the match's kill leader, while
pin hitters Hayley Spelman and Rachel
Williams posted nine kills apiece. Without
activating their successful serving game,
the Ducks had little defense against the ag
gressive and effectively spread Cardinal of
fense, as orchestrated "by senior setter Cas
sidy Lichtman.

Klineman and Spelman both post hit
ting percentages in the top 10 in conference
rankings, while no Oregon or OSU players
are currently ranked. The Ducks and
Beavers are also tied for eighth in the Pac
-10 for opponent hitting percentage (.219),
while Stanford sits in first place for the in-

verse of that statistic the team's hitting
percentage is .327.
In their last battle with Stanford this
season, the Beavers fared similarly to the
Ducks. However, unlike its rival, unranked
Oregon State has yet to take a match from
the Cardinal in the teams' 51-match histo
ry in conference competition.
Beaver senior Jill Sawatzky leads her
team in kills per set and points per set, yet
the outside hitter was unable to post dou
ble digits in either category during Oregon
State's trip to Maples.

Besides the 25 combined digs picked up
by defensive specialists Alyssa O'Neil and
Becky Defoe, the Cardinal held every
OSU player to single digits in all dimen
sions of the match.The Beavers bottom out
the Pac-10 in digs per set while Stanford
falls in second, with libera Gabi Ailes rank
ing fourth in the conference individually.
Not even OSU's current second-place
ranking in the Pac-10 in blocks per game
proved effective in hindering Stanford's of
fense the Card was able to dispatch dou
ble digits from all three pins, as Williams,
Spelman and Klineman combined for 38
kills in three short sets. Nonetheless, the
Beaver middle blockers freshman
Mona Kressl and sophomore Ashley Ene
liko have both earned current top-10
blocking stats as underclassmen.
Both opponents should logically place a
lot of emphasis on the block after review
ing Stanford's film. Either team could give
the Card a shock if it finds away to slow
down the pin hitters at the net. Nonethe
less, an acutely functioning serve-receive
game should position Stanford to better
utilize its middles. A well-spread offense
would allow Stanford to put pressure onto
Duck and Beaver middles in away that
makes such defensive success extremely
difficult.

"We are now going back to fundamen
tals and working on the little things in
order to improve our whole game,"
Williams said.

The Card will face Oregon at 7 p.m. in
Eugene, Ore,, this Friday before taking on
Oregon State in an orange-and-black Hal
loween special set for 1 p.m. this Sunday in
Corvallis, Ore.

Ducks. However, unlike its rival, unranked
Oregon State has yet to take a match from
the Cardinal in the teams' 51-match histo
ry in conference competition.
Beaver senior Jill Sawatzky leads her
team in kills per set and points per set, yet
the outside hitter was unable to post dou
ble digits in either category during Oregon
State's trip to Maples.

Besides the 25 combined digs picked up
by defensive specialists Alyssa O'Neil and
Becky Defoe, the Cardinal held every
OSU player to single digits in all dimen
sions of the match.The Beavers bottom out
the Pac-10 in digs per set while Stanford
falls in second, with libera Gabi Ailes rank
ing fourth in the conference individually.
Not even OSU's current second-place
ranking in the Pac-10 in blocks per game
proved effective in hindering Stanford's of
fense the Card was able to dispatch dou
ble digits from all three pins, as Williams,
Spelman and Klineman combined for 38
kills in three short sets. Nonetheless, the
Beaver middle blockers freshman
Mona Kressl and sophomore Ashley Ene
liko have both earned current top-10
blocking stats as underclassmen.
Both opponents should logically place a
lot of emphasis on the block after review
ing Stanford's film. Either team could give
the Card a shock if it finds away to slow
down the pin hitters at the net. Nonethe
less, an acutely functioning serve-receive
game should position Stanford to better
utilize its middles. A well-spread offense
would allow Stanford to put pressure onto
Duck and Beaver middles in away that
makes such defensive success extremely
difficult.

"We are now going back to fundamen
tals and working on the little things in
order to improve our whole game,"
Williams said.

The Card will face Oregon at 7 p.m. in
Eugene, Ore,, this Friday before taking on
Oregon State in an orange-and-black Hal
loween special set for 1 p.m. this Sunday in
Corvallis, Ore.

Stanford libero Gabi Ailes, above, will be instrumental in helping the Cardinal find its confidence after
losing a tough match to Cal. The team heads to Oregon for two conference matches this weekend.
