# SENIOR DAY A MUST-WIN FOR CARD
## 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Two tough 1-0 losses on the road
against UCLA and San Diego State this
past weekend dropped the Stanford
men's soccer team (7-8-0, 3-4-0 Pac-10)
below .500 on the season and in the Pac
-10, making this weekend's last homes
tand against Washington and Oregon
State crucial in the push for an NCAA
Tournament berth.
Sunday afternoon against Oregon
State is also Senior Day, marking the last
time Stanford's seven graduating seniors
will suit up at Laird Q. Cagan Stadium.
Head coach Bret Simon said that this
senior class has done a lot to help make
his job easier.
"This is a fantastic group of guys who
are all team leaders, and they make up a
big chunk of what we are as a team," he
said. "I think our team will change dra
matically without them here next year.
All of them have been leaders in prac
tice, and they've made sure the rest of the
team is prepared and focused. They have
all matured and grown as players and
people while they've been here, and they
have made my job a lot more reward
ing."
Three of the Cardinal's four defend
ers are among those leaving the Farm, in
cluding standout Bobby Warshaw. The
senior from Mechanicsburg, Pa., is a fi
nalist for the Lowe's Senior CLASS

award as well as the MAC Hermann Tro
phy, given to the nation's top Division I
player.
The outcome of Friday's game
against Washington (8-4-1, 2-3-0) likely
hinges on Stanford's defense â€”in the
seven Cardinal victories, opponents have
scored just two goals. In the other eight,
Stanford has allowed 14 goals.
For their part, the Huskies had a
seven-game unbeaten streak early in the
season, but slipped heading into Pac-10
play and are currently fourth in the Pac
-10.
In the last meeting between the teams
on Oct. 8, Stanford struggled with the
Huskies' aerial prowess, letting in two
quick goals to open the second half in
Seattle and eventually losing 2-0. Wash
ington leads the all-time series 24-14-4.
Cardinal sophomore defender
Hunter Gorskie said that in order to get
a positive result, Stanford will have to
play within itself.
"We have to really try and impose our
will on them," he said. "We need to play
the ball on the ground and keep it mov
ing. [Washington is] very athletic, and the
last game played into their style because
there were a lot of balls in the air. In order
to win, we have to be patient."
Sunday's game figures to be a little
easier than Friday's,but not by much.The
Beavers (6-6-0,1-4-0) will be coming off
two full weeks of rest since their last
game, and they played Stanford tight in

their last matchup on Oct. 10. The Cardi
nal pulled out a tough 1-0 victory with a
golden goal from senior Dominique
Yahyavi in double overtime. The
Beavers have allowed a league-high 26
goals this year and are the only Pac-10
team not to have been ranked at any
point this season.
Opponents' records and rankings do
not factor into how Simon handles the
game plan.
"We really have to take each game in
dividually and then move on and pre
pare for the next one," Simon said. "This
stretch of four straight weekends with
back-to-back games is really tough, so we
can't really have overarching goals.
"That's how you get off track," he

SIMON WARBY/The Stanford Daily
After losing two close matches in Southern California last weekend, the
Stanford men's soccer team is in desparate need of victories at home this
weekend. The Card hosts conference rivals Washington and Oregon
State this weekend in the final homestand for the Stanford seniors.
