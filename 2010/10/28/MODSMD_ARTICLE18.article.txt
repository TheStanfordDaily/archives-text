## Stanford football among top NCAA graduation scores 
### â€” Kabir Sawhney 
On Wednesday morning, the
NCAA released the latest of its ongo
ing Graduation Success Rate (GSR)
reports.

The GSR measures the percent
age of athletes that a program gradu
ates in six years. The latest data covers
the classes that entered college be
tween 2000 and 2003.

Schools currently in the Football
Bowl Subdivision (FBS, formerly Di
vision I-A) collectively posted a 67
percent GSR. Across all sports, 79
percent of student-athletes graduate
with a degree in six years or fewer.
Graduation rates have steadily
climbed in football, from 63 percent
for the class entering school in 1995
to 69 percent for the class entering in
2003.

Among schools currently ranked
in the top 25 of the BCS standings,
Stanford had the best GSR score,
graduating 86 percent of its players in
this time period. At 44 percent, Okla
homa (Stanford's opponent in last
year's Sun Bowl) had the worst rate
among schools currently in the top
25.

In men's basketball, the other
major revenue sport, graduation
rates were stagnant, staying at an av
erage of 66 percent across all Divi
sion I schools. However, graduation
rates were poor at some of the na
tion's top programs 12 of the
teams in the season's final top-25 poll
had graduation rates below 50 per
cent. California had the lowest score,
with a 30-percent graduation rate,
followed closely by Connecticut with
31 percent. National champion Duke

and runner-up Butler both posted
high scores of 83 percent.
Stanford's basketball program
had a relatively high score of 80 per
cent over the 2000-2003 seasons.
The NCAA also released data on
Stanford's remaining athletic pro
grams. Collectively, Stanford had a
graduation rate of 94 percent among
its student-athletes, while the student
body at-large has a similar rate of 95
percent.

The men's basketball GSR of 80
percent was the lowest of any Stan
ford team. Nineteen programs, in
cluding women's basketball, baseball
and softball, posted perfect GSRs of

100 percent.
Since the NCAA began publish
ing GSR data, starting with the 1998
cohort, Stanford has never scored
below 93 percent as an institution.
The 2003 cohort's score of 94 percent
represents no change from the previ
ous year's score and a decline of one
percent from the 2001 cohort.
