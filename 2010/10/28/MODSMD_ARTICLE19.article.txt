# Stanford men's basketball lands prized recruit Randle
## 
### â€” Zach Zimmerman 
Without having played a single
game in the 2010 season, the Stanford

men's basketball team has already
made a splash in 2011, receiving a
verbal commitment on Wednesday
from point guard Chasson Randle.
Randle, ranked No. 8 at his posi
tion in the 2011 class by ESPNU, is
the latest testament to head coach
Johnny Dawkins' recruiting power.
Dawkins landed a top-20 recruiting
class in 2010, which should remain

among the nation's elite with the ad
dition of Randle.
At 6 feet 1 inch, Randle has
played as an undersized two-guard
in high school, but has been transi
tioning to point guard this season.
He told ESPN.com that Dawkins, re
garded as one of college basketball's
greatest point guards, drew him to
Stanford, along with the Universi

ty's prestigious academics. Randle is
an honors student and boasts a 4.0
GPA.

Randle, a native of Rock Island,
111., is already Rock Island High
School's all-time scoring leader. He
chose Stanford over his two other fi
nalists, Illinois and Purdue.
