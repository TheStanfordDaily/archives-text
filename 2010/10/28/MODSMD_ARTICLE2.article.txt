## School of Medicine dedicates largest stem cell research building in nation 
### ERIN INMAN STAFF WRITER 
On Wednesday, University admin
istrators dedicated the Lorry I. Lokey
Stem Cell Research Building, the
newest addition to the School of
Medicine, before a crowd of almost
400.

The building dedication marked
"an opportunity for transformation,
not only for Stanford, but also for the
state and the nation," said Philip
Pizzo, dean of the Stanford School of
Medicine.

The $225 million building was re
alized with $75 million of financial
support from businessman and phi
lanthropist Lorry Lokey '49, the Cal

ifornia Institute for Regenerative
Medicine and other generous sup
porters. (The Daily building is also
named after Lokey, who donated
money to its construction.)
"Due to its funding, the facility has
the historic opportunity to reduce
human suffering outside of politics,"
said Robert Klein '67 J.D. '7O, the
chair of the governing board of the
California Institute for Regenerative
Medicine (CIRM), which con
tributed $43.6 million to the building.
The 200,000-square-foot facility,
which broke ground two years ago,

The largest stem cell research facility in the U.S., the Lorry I. Lokey Stem Cell Research Building, was dedicated Wednesday with speeches from, left to right, School of Medicine
Dean Philip Pizzo, Chair of the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine Robert Klein, University President John Hennessy, Lokey and Board of Trustees President Leslie Hume.
Hennessy. The sense of urgency sur
rounding its construction was fueled
by the belief that lives are at stake.
Since the first isolation of an adult
human stem cell 22 years ago at Stan
ford, the stem cell field has greatly ex
panded. As stem cell research ex
pands, the field has the potential to
affect the length and quality of
human life, according to Lokey.
"If science tells us our bodies are
meant for a hundred years, why
[can't] we all [get] there eventually?"
he asked. "This life is too rewarding
and good to leave too early."
With the accelerating nature of
the field in mind, the facility was de
signed with flexibility to allow it to
evolve along with the science.

The building houses 33 research
labs, making it the largest stem cell
research facility in the nation. The
labs are designed as integrated
neighborhoods to promote interdis
ciplinary collaboration.
Here, medicine and engineering
can merge to share discoveries and
push the frontier of knowledge, Hen
nessy said.
"In all of human history we have
never had the ability to create a
human cell," Klein said. "In all of the
generations of science, this is a criti
cal new frontier. In 20 years you will
not recognize the practice of medi
cine."
Current Stanford research focus
es on a variety of adult stem cells, em
bryonic stem cells, cancer stem cells
and more. Targeted diseases of re
generative research include acute
myeloid leukemia, type I diabetes,
multiple sclerosis, acute cerebral is
chemia, sickle cell anemia and

Parkinson's disease.
"If in 10 years, 200 million people
have benefited from the research at
this facility, then the $2OO million put
in averages out to a dollar per per
son," Lokey said. "That's not bad."
To stem cell researchers at Stan
ford, the 2004 passing of Proposition
71, which supports stem cell re
search and facilities, was indicative
of the promise of future funding and
security within their field. The
proposition created CIRM, which fi
nances stem cell research and estab
lishes regulatory standards within
the field.
"Through Proposition 71, Califor
nia became a beacon for making life
better for people through discovery
and science," Hennessy said.
"The stem cell revolution has
begun in California," Klein added.
