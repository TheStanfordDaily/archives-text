## 'BE Community' designed for young cancer patients 
### DANA EDWARDS 
Imagine a virtual world in which
young cancer patients can interact and
support one another a social network
that is at once fun, trendy and therapeu
tic, That's the vision of Mette Hoybye and
Henrik Bennetsen, researchers at Stan
ford who are collaborating on the BE
Community, a project they presented

Tuesday at the Future of Health Innova
tion Conference in Tresidder Oak
Lounge.
Hoybye is a visiting researcher at the
Stanford Medical Center. She teamed up
with Bennetsen, CEO and co-founder of
KataLabs, who, in collaboration with the
Stanford Computer Science department
and Humanites Lab, created Sirikata, the
platform on which the BE Community

will run.
Hoybye and Bennetsen are especially
interested in helping adolescent cancer
patients because they face certain chal
lenges that other age groups do not. In re
cent years, while the cure rate for young
children with cancer has increased sub
stantially, young adult patients have not
seen similar progress due both to non
compliance issues with self-administered

treatments and to differing physiological
responses to those treatments.
One of the biggest challenges adoles
cent patients face is social isolation; it
comes at a formative age when socializing
is both desired and critical to develop
ment. "In medical literature, social isola
tion is a threat to health on the same level
as other factors like smoking, drink
ing or obesity," Hoybye said in a
presentation on the community on
Tuesday.
Unique challenges for adolescent
patients require unique solutions.
"Our goal is to make an engag
ing, interesting environment that
meets them wherever they are,"
Bennetsen said, "and the social di
mension is really important."
The name of the project is
telling. The BE Community is a
place for young patients to simply
be, to converse with friends on their
own terms, and to seek refuge and
consolation outside traditional clin
ical settings.
"We want to introduce the BE
Community as a place to be," Hoy
bye said, "to be together, to meet
others with similar conditions and
facing similar challenges . . . and to
try to alleviate the social isolation
following a diagnosis of cancer."
It's not an escape, however, both
Hoybye and Bennetsen insisted.
"It's like giving you another
place to go," Bennetsen said. "It's
no more an escape than playing golf
is an escape. Going on the golf
course allows you to engage in cer
tain behaviors and dress a certain
way; it means something to you.
With the BE Community, because
of certain physical constraints
some patients are hooked up to hos
pital beds giving the kids a digi
tal place to go is the most feasible
option."
A key aspect of the project is its
insistence on using the kinds of so
cial networks that young people al
ready use.
"Do you want to communicate
with people where they are com
fortable and in the manner that they
are already communicating," Ben
netsen asked in the Tuesday presen
tation, "or do you want to force
them to speak your language? We
want to talk to the kids where they
are, on their terms."
In the future, Bennetsen would
like to see the BE Community inte
grated with social media like Face
book and Myspace.
What will make all of this possi
ble is the revolutionary platform,
Sirikata.
"Sirikata is an attempt to build a
very scalable virtual world platform
that's use-case agnostic," Bennet
sen said. "Most of the big platforms
out there are built to deliver a game
experience mainly, which is a tech
nologically uncomfortable fit. We
want it to be more open-ended and
more user-friendly."
What makes Sirikata so com
pelling is its ability to run a multi
user, three-dimensional environ
ment in a web browser, without the
need to install or download any ad
ditional software. This convenient

access is made possible by a recent
re-engineering of the Web's user in
terface, Htmls, which gives Web
browsers new capabilities.
Armed with this technology and
backed up by earlier research con
ducted at Stanford on the efficacy
of games and social media as ad
juncts to clinical cancer treatment,
Mette and Hoybye plan on con
ducting a case study with 500 young
cancer patients in early 2011.
"With the results, we will evalu
ate psychological measures and
more objective measures do
they show up to their appointments,
do they take their medicines, etc.,"
Hoybye said. "We'll then compare
the two groups and see if it suggests
that their engagement with each
other in the BE Community has
some effect on their treatment and
their quality of life."
One question is whether access
to the community will be limited to
cancer patients only.
"With time, when the program
becomes more broadly available,
we can implement privacy and secu
rity measures to prevent potential
harassment from outsiders," Ben
netsen said. Both he and Hoybye
agreed that there is potential for the
BE Community and potential off
shoots to be used for adolescents
with other illnesses, but for the pilot
program and the clinical study, only
those with cancer will be involved.
Hoybye and Bennetsen have
funding from the Danish Child
Cancer Foundation through the end
of this year, and they are optimistic
about future contributions.
"We feel like we're onto some
thing," Bennetsen said, "and we're
hoping others will help us breathe
more life into it."
