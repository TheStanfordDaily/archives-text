## 'BE Community' designed for young cancer patients 
### DANA EDWARDS 
Imagine a virtual world in which
young cancer patients can interact and
support one another a social network
that is at once fun, trendy and therapeu
tic, That's the vision of Mette Hoybye and
Henrik Bennetsen, researchers at Stan
ford who are collaborating on the BE
Community, a project they presented

Tuesday at the Future of Health Innova
tion Conference in Tresidder Oak
Lounge.
Hoybye is a visiting researcher at the
Stanford Medical Center. She teamed up
with Bennetsen, CEO and co-founder of
KataLabs, who, in collaboration with the
Stanford Computer Science department
and Humanites Lab, created Sirikata, the
platform on which the BE Community

will run.
Hoybye and Bennetsen are especially
interested in helping adolescent cancer
patients because they face certain chal

cent years, while the cure rate for young
children with cancer has increased sub
stantially, young adult patients have not
seen similar progress due both to non
compliance issues with self-administered

treatments and to differing physiological
responses to those treatments.
One of the biggest challenges adoles
cent patients face is social isolation; it
comes at a formative age when socializing
is both desired and critical to develop

tion is a threat to health on the same level
