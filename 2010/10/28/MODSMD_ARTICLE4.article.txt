## Does tech use breed or kill empathy? Experts debate the effect of technology on interaction 
### MARIANNE LEVINE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The idea of spending a day without access
to technology is, for most college students,
an unbearable thought. But the increasing
dependence on technology for social com
munication has become a cause of concern
for many who believe technology limits
human connection and creates superficial
interactions through immediate gratifica
tion.
In a June 7 New York Times article, com
munication professor Clifford Nass voiced
his concern that heavy use of technology al
ters the way people interact with each other.
"The way we become more human is by
paying attention to each other," he said in
the article. "It shows how much you care."
Studies have shown that increased de
pendence on technology has resulted in the
diminishing of empathy by limiting the
amount of human interaction that takes
place. According to Jennifer Aaker, a profes
sor at the Graduate School of Business and
a co-author of "The Dragonfly Effect," a re
cent analysis of 72 studies performed on
nearly 14,000 college students between 1979
and 2009 showed a sharp decline in the em-

pathy trait over the last 10 years.
Although studies show that the
increased use of technology has in
fact resulted in a loss of human em
pathy, Aaker argues that technolo
gy may be used as a tool to encour
age and implement social good.
"In 'Dragonfly' we argue that
one mechanism is through fostering
processes and mindsets that culti
vate a radical focus on listening to
others and understanding them be
fore we build solutions ... design
thinking is one such process,"
Aaker said.

ability to connect with his aunt in
Taiwan through common techno
logical interests. Tien believes that
sharing common experiences
through Facebook or online gam
ing can contribute to learning

about others and gaining insight
that would not otherwise be acces
sible in casual conversation.
"I think that while each form of
media has its own dynamics, human
factors and interpretations
dominate the experience," Tien
said.
"Someone surrounded by gen
uine, thoughtful friends will feel
distinctly different about blogs,
Twitter and Facebook than some
one whose company is cynical and
vapid," he added.
Social media networks like
Facebook have been used to pro
mote fundraising and awareness
about global humanitarian issues.
Following Haiti's catastrophic
earthquake in January, FarmVille, a
Facebook application, launched the
"Sweet Seeds for Haiti" campaign,
which raised $487,500 in donations
within three weeks.
Aaker says profit and social
good do not have to be separate en
tities and can, in fact, be used to mu
tually benefit each other.

"It is becoming increasingly
clear that the work of making big
changes in the world is not limited
to massive nonprofits or peace
keeping missions," Aaker said. "It
can come from anywhere, from an
individual with a You Tube account
all the way to a big-budget business.
We live in a world increasingly con
nected through social networks that
make it possible for all of us to make
those big changes the world really
needs." Additionally, Aaker says
that small gestures, such as those en
abled by social media, can ultimate
ly make a big difference.
"Make ripples. Small acts can
create big change," Aaker said.
"Every long journey starts with a
first step.... one act of good can
inspire dozens, hundreds or even
thousands of others to tackle simi
larly small goals that when com
bined yield disproportionate suc
cess."
