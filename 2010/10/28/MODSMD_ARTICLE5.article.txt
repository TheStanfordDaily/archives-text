## Stanford startup gets $5 million Palo Alto's CafeBots funded by venture firm 
### HENRY ZHU 
Cafeßots, a Palo Alto startup found
ed by a group with Stanford connec
tions, recently received initial funding of
$5 million from Silicon Valley venture
capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield &
Byers (KPCB).
The investment is the first for
KPCB's sFund, a $250 million fund ded
icated to social technology and network
ing ventures. KPCB created this fund in
partnership with a trio of successful Sili
con Valley companies Amazon, Face
book and Zynga before naming
Cafeßots as its first recipient on Oct. 21.
Cafeßots was founded by Michael
Munie M.S. 'OB, now a doctoral student,
Thuc Vu M.S. 'O9 Ph.D. 'lO and Stanford
computer science professor Yoav
Shoham. Shoham is the CEO of the
company. Though still in development,
Cafeßots is focusing on what it calls
"friendship relationship management,"
which will let clients look for informa
tion and contacts within their social
worlds.
According to Munie, the idea for
Cafeßots started with some brief con
versations that quickly turned into many
late-night brainstorming sessions and an
eventual collaboration with Bing
Gordon MBA '7B, a partner at
KPCB as well as a board member of
Amazon, Zynga and Ngmoco.
"At the beginning, me, Thuc and
Yoav decided that we wanted to
work with the best VC and we quick
ly focused in on Kleiner Perkins and
Bing Gordon," Munie wrote in an e
mail to The Daily. "Bing has this in
credible ability to understand ad
vanced algorithms while at the same
time getting to level 70 on Far
mVille."

Shoham recently told NBC Bay
Area News. "Kleiner's new sFund
will be a great launch pad for compa
nies like ours that want to bring
groundbreaking innovation to the
social media space."
KPCB has had a history of spot
ting successful innovation. In 2008, it
announced the debut of its iFund, a
$lOO venture capital initiative that

"Social is the new search,"

funds the development of iPhone
and iPod applications. Applications
funded by this initiative include
shopkick, ngmoco, Booyah and
Shazam.

Munie and Vu attribute part of
their success to the collaborative
spirit of Stanford.
"A startup is a big change from
school, but there's something entre

preneurial in the air at Stanford that
has this irresistible draw," Munie
said. "1 loved school, but I love com
ing in to work even more."
"We're proud to follow a great
tradition, including Larry and
Sergey, David and Jerry, and many
others before them," Vu wrote in an
e-mail to The Daily, referring to
Google, Yahoo and other companies.
"[Right now] we're just busy work
ing, and there's not much to say until
we release a product. It has been
very fun and exciting at Cafeßots.
One of the best parts is to work with
very smart people here. 1 hope we'll
be adding more Stanford people be
fore too long."
