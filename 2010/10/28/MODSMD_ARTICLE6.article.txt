## FloMo now serves up kosher food Dining offers new options to Jewish students, plans to expand 
### BRANDON POWELL 
Stanford Dining launched a pilot program on
Oct. 4 that introduced kosher food to Florence
Moore dining hall. The pilot program serves strictly
prepared kosher food in the FloMo dining hall every
Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday from 5:15 to 6:45
p.m.
The program is intended to address the absence
of food options for those who adhere to Jewish di
etary laws.
According to Jacob Portes 'l3, kosher dining in
tern for Stanford Dining, the idea for the program
began with Jarrod Marks 'l2, who expressed his dis
content to Stanford Dining about the unavailability
of kosher food in the dining halls.
"I believe that was the impetus for Stanford Din
ing, who spent the next two years building up a pro
gram," Portes wrote in an e-mail to The Daily.
Portes agreed that the prior state of kosher din
ing at Stanford was lacking.
"Previously, there were no strictly kosher options
in any of the dining halls," Portes said. "The laws of
kashrut (keeping kosher) are pretty involved."
Portes also discussed the existence of kosher din
ing options at other universities across the country,
noting Stanford was slightly behind schedule.
"Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Penn, Columbia, MIT,
Cornell, etc. all have kosher food programs, some for
30 years," Portes said. "Traditionally, Jewish students
didn't even think about applying to Stanford be
cause of the lack of kosher food."
Noah Linfield 'l3, a participating student, said
the project was brought to life by popular student
demand.
"I think the catalyst to the beginning of the pro
gram was a survey that was sent out gauging the po
tential interest of the students, which had very posi
tive results" Linfield said in an e-mail to The Daily.
"Once the administrators saw the positive student
interest in the program, they were excited to move
forward and start developing the program."
Portes expressed delight with the outcome of the
program and the food being served.
"The most important thing is that the food tastes
delicious. Everybody likes it so far," Portes said.
"There are five dishes (salad, soup, cooked vegeta-
bles, starch and meat) served every
night, and you can get second serv
ings and eat the rest of the FloMo
food."
Linfield agreed, noting the
menu's variety.
"We've had steak, chicken, beef
and more," Linfield said. "Everyone
that I've talked to has also been ex
tremely satisfied with the quality of
the food."
But the flexibility may not be per
manent. Portes discussed what the
future of the program might entail.
"We are in the middle of a 'trial
period' when anyone with a meal
plan can have the food without any
extra charge," Portes said. "In the fu
ture, those who want to eat will ei
ther have to commit to eating in
FloMo three times a week
[kosher/non-kosher food] or pay

extra whenever they want kosher."
Linfield expanded on the
prospective development of the
kosher food program.
"The ultimate plan is to convert
an existing kitchen (or possibly
build a new one) and have that din
ing hall be the kosher, halal and
strictly vegetarian dining hall," Lin
field said. "This is a model that can
potentially be exemplary for other
schools, because most other colleges
run the kosher dining through the
Hillel."
Linfield credited the program to
Katherine Heflin 'll, dining intern
over the summer, as well as Stanford
Dining administrators Eric Montell
and Gary Arthur. According to Lin
field, the program is growing quickly.
"There are over 20 students
signed up currently, with that num
ber still increasing," Linfield said. "I
am very optimistic about where the
program is headed."
