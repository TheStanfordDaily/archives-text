## FloMo now serves up kosher food Dining offers new options to Jewish students, plans to expand 
### BRANDON POWELL 
Stanford Dining launched a pilot program on
Oct. 4 that introduced kosher food to Florence
Moore dining hall. The pilot program serves strictly
prepared kosher food in the FloMo dining hall every
Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday from 5:15 to 6:45
p.m.
The program is intended to address the absence
of food options for those who adhere to Jewish di
etary laws.
According to Jacob Portes 'l3, kosher dining in
tern for Stanford Dining, the idea for the program
began with Jarrod Marks 'l2, who expressed his dis
content to Stanford Dining about the unavailability
of kosher food in the dining halls.
"I believe that was the impetus for Stanford Din

Portes agreed that the prior state of kosher din

"Previously, there were no strictly kosher options
in any of the dining halls," Portes said. "The laws of
kashrut (keeping kosher) are pretty involved."
Portes also discussed the existence of kosher din

noting Stanford was slightly behind schedule.
"Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Penn, Columbia, MIT,
Cornell, etc. all have kosher food programs, some for
30 years," Portes said. "Traditionally, Jewish students
didn't even think about applying to Stanford be
cause of the lack of kosher food."
Noah Linfield 'l3, a participating student, said
the project was brought to life by popular student
demand.
"I think the catalyst to the beginning of the pro
gram was a survey that was sent out gauging the po
tential interest of the students, which had very posi

"Once the administrators saw the positive student
interest in the program, they were excited to move
forward and start developing the program."
Portes expressed delight with the outcome of the
program and the food being served.
"The most important thing is that the food tastes
delicious. Everybody likes it so far," Portes said.
"There are five dishes (salad, soup, cooked vegeta-
