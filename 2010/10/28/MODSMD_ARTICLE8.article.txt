## Evading death, one random step at a time 
### YIBAISHU 
For someone who spent 13 months
in Afghanistan, Rene Morkos
looks unexpectedly carefree and
unworn. At age 28, he speaks and
gestures with the hyper-enthusi
asm of a rookie freshman. His giddy smile
reveals two rows of braces.
It's five minutes to seven and CoHo is
permeated with the usual smell of fresh
French fries, with a bustling background
noise of espresso machines and cheerful
dinner chatter. Dressed in a bright aquaT
shirt, Morkos is sitting on the edge of the
stage beside the microphone and loud
speakers.
"Nervous?" a friend from San Francis
co teases him.
"Yeah. I'm fine," Morkos replies. From
the looks of his calm complexion, it's hard
to imagine that he survived all the extrem
ities of life in Afghanistan: dusty weather,
deprivation of material supplies and land
mine explosions.
Morkos is a doctoral student at the
Stanford Center for Integrated Facility
Engineering. Immediately after graduat
ing from the American University of
Beirut in 2005, he got a contract from a pri
vate company to work in Afghanistan as a
ground construction engineer.
Tonight, Morkos is sharing his stories
with Stanford. He looks at his watch, then
without hesitation, begins speaking into
the microphone.
"The big question is why did I go?" he
says, in an attempt to capture the attention
of 50 or so audience members mingled
with CoHo patrons. Most are unaware that
tonight is the reception for Morkos' exhi
bition, "Death and Life; Afghanistan,"
which is sponsored by the Student Orga
nizing Committee for the Arts.
"I didn't suddenly wake up in the morn
ing and say, 'Oh, I want to go to
Afghanistan.' It took me eight months to
think about whether this was the thing I
wanted to do."
Morkos is not a professional artist. He
simply picked up a camera the day before
he set off for Afghanistan and, once there,
started shooting photos. But his narrative
is powerful.
"To understand life you have to under
stand death," he offers. "However, life is
the only concept that we can't explore its
opposite. That means you can't go dead
and then come back. So what are we doing
with that?"
During his stay in Afghanistan, Morkos
led a construction team of 114 people
most of whom were locals to build vari
ous military and civilian facilities. He also
spent time traveling and taking thousands
of photos to document the country's
poverty and misfortunes.
"Afghanistan was much more than an
experiment between life and death,"

Morkos tells the audience. "It's really a
magical place that I have the opportunity
to see ... whether it's sitting with peacocks
and alarm guards at a lake, watching birds
slide by, going on a ride in the mountains,
sleeping with guns under your pillow or
taking an airplane flying over [the] Hi
malayas. It was really a wonderful experi
ence."
Morkos steps down from the stage and
approaches one of the photos on the wall.
About 20 people stand up and follow his
steps. Audiences look caught up with his
words; diners stop their conversations to
watch him.
On the white foam-board mountings
hang gray-hued photos of dilapidated
buildings, dusty markets, deserted tanks
and helpless people.
Bomb explosions and land mines, he
says, were a frequent sight. De-miners,
people paid to disable land mines, earn
$1,500 per month plus bonuses for every
disabled mine. Even in the wealthiest dis
tricts, children play with discarded Russian
tanks on the street.
"I call this picture 'Three people, three
legs,' " Morkos says as he points to an
image of three passengers waiting in a bus
station. One person has one leg and the
second, none. All three people appear
numb and indifferent. "Afghanistan is the
most heavily land-mined country in the
world. Hundreds of people are still injured
or killed every month."
He moves on, the crowd trailing be
hind.
"This is a very powerful image,"
Morkos says in reference to a photo of 30
to 40 girls, all wearing burqas and hijabs,
squeezed in a single tent. "This is a girls'
school.The Taliban allowed no music.They
don't allow education. This school is the
outcome after several compromises."
Next to the picture of the tent school
are several photos of villagers buying and
selling opium, which historically has been
prevalent in Afghanistan and in the world
drug supply.
"People just sell it like this in the mar
ket," he says. "I don't think you can talk
about Afghanistan without addressing the
opium. The whole country just runs on it.
Most of the guys there actually don't know
that the opium is addictive. It stopped chil
dren's coughing in the winter. They gave it
to babies and the babies get addicted."
He moves on to talk about a photo fea
turing miscellaneous small cans and boxes
atop a wooden trolley.
"This is a pharmacy," he says. "When
you buy medication in Afghanistan, it's a
50 percent chance that it's just sugar or
something like that. Your risk of dying ex
ponentially increases. The fuels are old,
medication is old and nothing is reliable."
The photo prompts Morkos to reflect
on the contrast between technology in
Afghanistan versus the U.S.
"It's ironic that the lack of technology

in [Afghanistan] makes you think how
technology changes your life."
He also notes that in Afghanistan, in
order to achieve a simple goal it takes six
tries because resources are scarce and the
living environment is primitive and harsh.
"They are really tough guys," Morkos
continues, referring to the locals he be
friended. "When I was working on a con
struction site outside, I would have four to
five layers, including an $BOO bulletproof
jacket. These guys were just running with
their T-shirts."
"Without knowing about the outside
world, it's really difficult to communicate
with people and let them know what our
village is like and what our thoughts of life
are," he adds. "People would like to be sui
cide bombers for several thousand dollars.
They don't understand our life because
they don't actually get to see our life,"
About 20 minutes into the presenta
tion, Morkos turns to a photo of an explo
sion on the side of the road. He explains
that in this particular instance, a suicide
bomber pulled strings 20 feet away from
him, right next to a grocery store.
"It's about experience," he remarks. "In

a situation, you have a number of options,
but some of the options are wrong. I was
driving down there when I got a phone call.
So I stopped the car. Then I watched them
blow up."
Morkos continues, "Two people are
killed and a taxi driver who loses his nerve
tries to drive away through the checkpoint.
He is shot dead. Five people lost their lives
in 30 minutes."
Morkos concludes his talk with a seri
ous question. "What's life really worth?"
"From this experience I get two things,"
he offers. "I really don't want to die, and
one day I'm really going to. The life there
wore out my nerves, but it helped me un
derstand and appreciate my life. My ladder
of values really changed."
That's why he came to Stanford, he
said. "While I thought it would be cool to
hang out with friends and drink the Satur
day nights away, I only have 40 years left in
my life. So why not choose to do things that
are more meaningful for example,
spending this evening to learn to solve a
difficult problem?"
