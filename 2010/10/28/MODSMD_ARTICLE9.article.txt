# Air instruments only
## What is the Stanford Laptop Orchestra? 
### JENNY THAI CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Nick Kruge stands solemnly, his
right foot poised over the pedal.
His hands are laced around two
long, extendable strings that are
stretched taut in the air, level
with his shoulders.

With a broad sweeping horizontal motion,
Kruge strokes the air, and the sound of an
eerie harp fills the air. Swishing hands back

and forth in bold waves, the pitch and volume
of the invisible harp shifts. A step on the pedal
and suddenly Kruge is no longer playing a
harp but an entirely unique and new instru
ment.

"It's virtual reality, but for your ears,"
Kruge said, pointing at the wooden domed
shaped speaker on the floor. "You can swirl
the sound around, or you could have different
channels play different things."
Kruge, a second-year graduate student in
music, is a member of the Stanford Laptop Or
chestra (SLOrk). According to its website,

SLOrk "is a large-scale, computer-mediated
ensemble that explores cutting-edge technol
ogy in combination with conventional musical
contexts."
Currently under the direction of Ge Wang,
SLOrk was founded in 2008 by a group of
Stanford students, faculty and staff at Stan
ford's Center for Computer Research in
Music and Acoustics (CCRMA).This ensem
ble is composed of more than "20 laptops,
human performers, controllers and custom
multi-channel speaker arrays."
Despite being called an "orchestra,"
SLOrk's goals are different from those of a
traditional ensemble.
"Our goal isn't to recreate traditional
music using computers," said Jieun Oh, a
third-year doctoral candidate studying music
and computer science. She is also one of the
co-directors of SLOrk. "Traditional and com
puter music each have their strengths. Instead,
we are taking advantage of the cool features
that technology has, namely the unique
sounds that a computer can make that tradi
tional instruments can't."
The essence of SLOrk's music starts with
programming code.
"You come up with a concept," said Nick
Bryan, a third-year doctoral candidate and a
fellow SLOrk co-director. "You flesh it out
and create the music by writing code, so that
[eventually] it can be felt by the audience."
One of the most distinctive aspects of
SLOrk is that the performers are not only the
composers and performers of their music, but

they are also the architects of their own instru
ments.
"In a traditional ensemble, you just play
the music you're not writing it," Kruge said.
"What we're doing in SLOrk is like giving an
orchestra a bunch of wood and saws and ask
ing them to make the instruments and com
pose the music afterwards.
SLOrk blurs the line between instrument
and piece by taking advantage of the comput
er's networking capabilities, thereby revolu
tionizing ensemble communication.
"You can type to someone while playing,"
Kruge said. "It's similar to a traditional or
chestra where you make eye contact with
other members to convey a certain message."
"If a player is sounding too bright, the con
ductor can let him know that immediately
without the audience knowing," Oh said.
The network, to which all the SLOrk lap
tops are linked, allows for greater fluidity and
synchronization between ensemble members.
However, part of the mystical quality of
SLOrk's music is that there isn't a set musical
score.
"It's a lot more dynamic than it appears,"
Oh said. "The general reaction we get is, 'Oh,
you just press buttons.' But it's not like that.
The way we interact with the instrument
shapes the piece. The instruments don't have
their own potential until we rehearse in a
group because the piece itself is the instru
ment."

"I mean, we can do that —just press but
tons — but it wouldn't be very fun," Oh

w
added.
The music that SLOrk composes is just as
eclectic as its collection of instrumental acces
sories, which includes joysticks, virtual golf
machines and IKEA salad bowl speakers.
"Different algorithms produce different
moods, which means a variety of music,"
Bryan said. "There's no specific genre of music
that we prefer. We have everything ranging
from rock band-style 'virtual air guitar' to
music more typical to traditional ensembles."
Creating a working piece, let alone a beau
tiful one, requires a considerable amount of
work.
"It's difficult to build an instrument that
doesn't 'break,'" Kruge said. "A successful
piece is its scalability. If it sounds great with
one person and then with 20, then you know
that it's well designed."
Interested students can take the SLOrk
class offered during spring quarter for one to
five units. SLOrk typically holds two concerts,
both of which are in the spring. The class is
open to everyone, not just computer science
majors.
"We get lots of CS students, as well as those
in linguistics, music and symbolic systems,"
Bryan said.
Despite the late-night rehearsals, students
have found the ensemble immensely reward
ing.
"The type of sound you create in SLOrk,
you can't hear anywhere else," Oh said.
