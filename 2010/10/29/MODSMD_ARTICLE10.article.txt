## SENSE AND NONSENSE Altruism Without Virtue 
### Aysha Bagchi 
It seems strange to juxtapose those two
ideas, altruism and virtue. But that's what
I'm about to do. I want to suggest Stan
ford students are, by and large, overflowing
with altruism but lacking in virtue. And I
want to suggest this is a problem, for both al
truism's and virtue's sakes.

Our current generation may be more con
cerned with the world's biggest problems
issues like global poverty, climate change,
health care, education and women's rights
than any generation that has preceded us.
The biggest initiatives on campus are almost
all philanthropic enterprises aimed at tack
ling these problems: Dance Marathon, Alter
native Spring Break, Impact Abroad, Jump
start, Anjna, EPASA and the list continues.
Altruism thrives on campus.
At the same time, virtue is a stale topic. We
don't discuss being all we can be, only doing
all we can do. We are comfortable with the
outward-oriented morality embodied in the
word "altruism," but uncomfortable with the
inward-oriented morality embodied in the
word "virtue." Virtue talk is associated with
attitudes of superiority: if we focus on culti
vating virtues in ourselves, we fear we are
also cultivating arrogance toward those who
live and think differently. It is also associated
with questionable values: virtue talk has
often led to the blind acceptance of societal
sympathies and prejudices as actual repre
sentations of what is good and bad.
It might also be true that students admit
ted to Stanford are simply less likely to be fo
cused on inward-oriented morality because
that is not the type of morality that would
have been highlighted in the application
process. It helps more in admissions to de
vote a lot of time to community service, vol
unteering abroad, starting NGOs and cam
paigning in Washington than to developing
independent standards to live by or consider
ing what are worthy pursuits. That kind of in
ward moral attention would have rewarded
us much more in our personal lives than in
the application process.
There are lots of good things to be said
about elevating the concept of altruism while
abandoning the broader idea of virtue. For
one, commitment to altruism is a safe moral
bet. While there can be a lot of debate about
what it means to be virtuous, the morality of
true service is not in question. Secondly, fo
cusing on virtue may come at the expense of
altruism. Indeed, the image of reflective stu
dents at elite schools one or two generations
ago is often of a cultured few absorbed in
thinking about their own character while ig
noring suffering in the world beyond. Valuing
virtue can be a recipe for too much self-in
volvement.

But I think it is a mistake to reject contem
plation of virtues, to neglect questions about

what kind of behavior both in terms of
public service and our everyday actions
lives up to our ideal selves. Without this kind
of holistic reflection, we can never fully en
dorse both our personal and public selves.
Cultivating virtue is at the core of discover
ing the life that is most worth living.
And altruism itself is much more secure
when it stems from a deeper individual, when
it is one among a set of values we have decid
ed make up the person we want to be. I re
member watching a video op-ed by New
York Times columnist Nick Kristof in May
about how humbled he is by missionaries like
the one he met in rural Sudan, Father
Michael Barton, who looks after four schools
and has been providing education to children
there for 32 years. As I watched Kristof's
video, it struck me that there was something
very different about the altruism Father
Michael exhibits and the altruism of today's
students who have all either volunteered in
East Palo Alto, launched microfinancing ini
tiatives in Peru, administered vaccines in the
Central African Republic or become a Teach
For America volunteer.
Unlike many of these well-meaning serv
ice recruits. Father Michael does not search
for a new life after a couple years. How he
lives and what he does stem from a broader
vision of what it means, to him, to live the
good life. There is no burning out; he does not
grudgingly choose service while secretly
lamenting the career he could have had. His
altruism is but one part of a vision of his ideal
self, and so it isn't going anywhere.
As strange as it sounds, students should
spend a little less time directing our energy to
the world beyond and a little more time
thinking about ourselves in relation to that
world. I don't mean students should stop en
gaging in service; that is often the best way to
prompt reflection on ourselves and on the
value of what we learn in the classroom. But
our primary focus in college should be on im
proving ourselves, not the world, on cultivat
ing a broad set of virtues. That is the way we
will ultimately do ourselves, and the world,
the greatest service.
