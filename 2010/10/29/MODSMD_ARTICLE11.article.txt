# OH, SWEET NUTHIN'!
## Full Psyche 
### Roseann Cima 
About 7 p.m. on Monday night, the
moon was full and I had decided I was
not going out that night. I was damn
excited about not going out. I was going to
take a hot shower. I was going to drink a cup
of peppermint tea. I was going to get a little
work done, maybe write in my diary, maybe
read a little. What an evening, right?
Around 9 p.m., I was well-nestled in bed
with my laptop when I got a text message
from Dutch friends, "Hey, I found out being
painted is a lot of fun! Are you going to make
the squad unsafe anyway?" I chuckled and
texted back, "Being painted IS a lot of fun!
And no. Too late. Too cold. Too Monday." I
took a sip of tea and gloated over my cozi
ness.

And that's when the pop music started.
The headliner was apparently way louder
than whoever came before them. Also, they
were impressive. Impressive rhythms, im
pressive mashups, impressive timbre, impres
sive effect of squelching most of my self-sat
isfied coziness. All of a sudden I was restless.
I was angry. And I was oh so intrigued.
Well-amplified pop music sounds like a
party. And I don't just mean we correlate the
two. Had only electronic music wafted up to
my room I know I wouldn't have launched
into such longing. But human voices were in
volved, and trumpets, and drumbeats like a
thousand people stomping. Think of the cir
cumstances that would have to occur to cre
ate the sheer sound without the intervention
of an amplifier! Think of the concentration of

human talent necessary to create that music
in particular, that loud, without recording
technology. My brain knew it was just some
smart kids with a stereo and turntables play
ing for a mostly static crowd of glass-eyed

freshmen and hawk-eyed graduate students.
But my body heard the biggest dance party of
the century: lively, screaming, synchronized
enthusiasm.
I may have come of age in the Internet-
Killed-the-Buggles post-post-post-live-&-
unamplified world. But if someone in the
next room is watching a You Tube video, and
someone on their screen screams, I'm likely
to jump a little and be put on edge. Another
reminder that I'm not programmed for my
era. So when I hear a scream, I may think
"screen," but my body says, "Danger!" And
when I hear pounding bass, I may think, "an
noying neighbor with subwoofer," but my
body thinks,"TRIBAL DANCE!"
And for all this I need to address what
might be mistaken for a triumph of my mod
ern brain over my primal body. Because I did
not go to Full Moon. I did not booze, get cov
ered in paint, attempt to proliferate my seed,
nor attempt transcendence through the spir
it of the dance, I sat in my room and Gchatted
with Stu about it, which had the impressive
effect of squelching most of my desire to
party. But I don't think that spending the
night with a screen is in essence a victory for
modernity. It's simply a case of confusion and
wanting to commune over it, emotions just as
primal as anything sexual or celebratory, and
more compelling than anything else. In my
case at least.
