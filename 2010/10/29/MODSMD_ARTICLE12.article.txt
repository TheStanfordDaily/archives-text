## No on 23, yes to your future 
### MAYA KORNBERG '14 Daily Fellow 
We're four weeks into the quarter,
and you can get so caught up in
fast-paced, day-to-day routine at
Stanford that sometimes you lose sight of
the bigger picture. The Stanford bubble casts
away much of what is going on around it.
And on a large campus, with so many unique
and talented students, sometimes you don't
think that you, alone, have the power to
leave a lasting influence on your surround
ings. Sure, you can join a club, post flier or or
ganize events, but will it actually change any
thing? And how often do things come
around that are important and influential
enough to truly engage you?
This November, each and every student
who shows up to vote can help decide how
they want their world to look by voting on
Proposition 23. The campaign is one of the
most exciting and powerful environmental
campaigns in the last few years, and all you
have to do to be involved is come out on
Nov. 2 and vote. You can make a lasting dif
ference.

California's Global Warming Solutions
Act of 2006, also known as AB 32, called for
the state to cut carbon emissions to 1990 lev
els by 2020. It established the first-ever
mandatory reporting guidelines for global
warming pollution and set a limit on carbon
emissions. This limit was put into practice by
establishing a price for carbon in addition to
tailpipe-emissions standards, a low-carbon
fuel standard, building energy-efficiency
standards and a statewide renewable elec
tricity standard of 33 percent by 2020. It
spurred the rapid growth of renewable ener
gy industry in California and created hun
dreds of thousands of new jobs. According to
the environmental website Climate
Progress, AB 32 was a vehicle that drove bil
lions of dollars in private-sector investment
in clean energy and created new businesses,
jobs and technologies.
Proposition 23 would suspend the AB 32
law until the unemployment rate falls bel

low 5.5 percent for four quarters, which has
only happened three times in the last 40
years of California history. Proposition 23 is
funded by the huge oil companies such as
Tesoro and Valero, who have framed it as a
"employment" initiative and blame the
Global Warming Solutions Act for recent
job losses. But while the oil companies are
framing Proposition 23 as a project to help
the economy, in actuality it only helps them

and harms the environment. Pollution
would skyrocket, with no limit, and the
proposition would ruin many of the new
businesses and jobs created after AB 32. Ac
cording to Climate Progress, it would sus
pend the crucial price signal that makes
clean energy more profitable than dirty en
ergy, which would damage the emerging
clean tech industries.
The Global Warming Solutions act is a

revolutionary piece of environmental legis
lation. In the Copenhagen talks last Decem
ber, President Obama promised that the
United States would lead the world in a fight
to reduce carbon emission and other harm
ful pollution. California set an example for
the United States and, by extension, the
world. But if California passes Proposition
23, all of this progress will be lost.
College is meant to prepare you for your

professional life. Going to Stanford is an in
vestment in your future. But what prospects
do we have without an environment to live
in? And what future do we have if we do not
own our future and make our own decisions?
The time to start shaping our fate and pro
tecting our environment is right now. Vote no
on Proposition 23 and invest in your future.
