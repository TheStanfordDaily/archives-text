## Palo Alto to revamp bike plan 
### NARDOS GIRMA 
In an effort to expand the bicycle network in Palo
Alto and fix existing holes in the bike system, the city
intends to build more bicycle boulevards road
ways that are designed with the biker in mind, al
though they generally allow motor vehicles. Creating
bicycle boulevards will reduce the number of stops
required for cyclists, say engineers.
The city will be making changes that will reduce
the number of actual stop signs as part of its Bicycle
and Pedestrian Plan, which was originally released in
2003 but is still in the revision process. For cyclists,
stop signs can cause an unwelcome need to stop and
restart while biking, adding extra effort to the trip.
"Bicycles are required by law to stop at stop
signs," said Rafael Rius, the city's transportation proj
ect engineer. "But what we can do is remove or mod
ify a couple of intersections that have two-way stop
signs."
By removing these stop signs, the city hopes to at
tract more bikers and make biking more enjoyable
for residents. While many already consider Palo Alto
a bicycle-friendly town, there is always room for im
provement, Rius said.
"Standards for bicycle sustainability are constantly
changing and improving," he added. "Our city was re
ally good at being bicycle-friendly in the past, but we
need to keep up with other cities who are improving."

Bikers in Palo Alto could have fewer stop signs to worry about as a result of special pathways, called bicycle boulevards, the city plans to construct in the next few years.
Bike boulevards have already
proven their success. The first one in
Palo Alto, which Rius also believes
was the first in the country, was built
on Bryant Street in the 1980s. This
pathway has been so effective, in
fact, that other jurisdictions have
used it as a model.
The city also hopes to make
minor traffic-related enhancements
to Palo Alto's bicycle system, such as
improving underground crossings.
However, safety remains a pri
mary concern for the transportation
division, and these changes will only
be applied to streets that are consid
ered safe enough.
In fact, Palo Alto residents won't
be noticing these changes anytime
soon. The city will start the program
in the next few weeks and the
process of identifying and prioritiz

ing projects will take about six
months. The finalized report could
then be adopted by the city council,
after which the city would start ap
plying for grants.
Although Palo Alto and Stanford
are often considered interconnect
ed, Stanford students won't be feel
ing the effects of the plan on cam
pus.
"Stanford and Palo Alto are
under two separate jurisdictions,"
said Deputy Allen James of the
Stanford Department of Public
Safety. "We're two separate enti
ties."
Funding for these constructing
these bicycle boulevards, which
cost somewhere between $25,000
and $30,000, will come from an al
location of $20,000 from the city's
own budget as well as a $55,000
grant from the Metropolitan Trans
portation Commission received in
2009.
