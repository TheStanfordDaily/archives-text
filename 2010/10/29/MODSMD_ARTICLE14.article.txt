## Palo Alto to revamp bike plan 
### NARDOS GIRMA 
In an effort to expand the bicycle network in Palo
Alto and fix existing holes in the bike system, the city
intends to build more bicycle boulevards road
ways that are designed with the biker in mind, al
though they generally allow motor vehicles. Creating
bicycle boulevards will reduce the number of stops
required for cyclists, say engineers.
The city will be making changes that will reduce
the number of actual stop signs as part of its Bicycle
and Pedestrian Plan, which was originally released in
2003 but is still in the revision process. For cyclists,
stop signs can cause an unwelcome need to stop and
restart while biking, adding extra effort to the trip.
"Bicycles are required by law to stop at stop
signs," said Rafael Rius, the city's transportation proj
ect engineer. "But what we can do is remove or mod
ify a couple of intersections that have two-way stop
signs."
By removing these stop signs, the city hopes to at
tract more bikers and make biking more enjoyable
for residents. While many already consider Palo Alto
a bicycle-friendly town, there is always room for im
provement, Rius said.
"Standards for bicycle sustainability are constantly
changing and improving," he added. "Our city was re
ally good at being bicycle-friendly in the past, but we
need to keep up with other cities who are improving."

Bikers in Palo Alto could have fewer stop signs to worry about as a result of special pathways, called bicycle boulevards, the city plans to construct in the next few years.
