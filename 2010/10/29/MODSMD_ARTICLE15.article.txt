## 10-day UN film festival marks closing weekend 
### ELLEN HUET MANAGING EDITOR 
The world comes to Stanford
through film for 10 days every year
through the United Nations Associa
tion Film Festival (UNAFF), now in
its 13th year of showing internation
al documentary films to the Stanford
campus and greater Bay Area com
munity, including Palo Alto, East
Palo Alto and San Francisco the
aters.
The festival kicked off last Friday
and has been running full speed
since, showing four to nine films a
day, plus holding panel discussions
and receptions with filmmakers on
international topics. The festial has
its closing night this Sunday.
"Friday's topic is war and peace,
Saturday's is environmental issues,
and Sunday's is securities and liber
ties," said Jasmina Bojic, the festival's
founder and executive director.
"Sunday's films are also a bit scary
because it's Flalloween and the topic
is appropriate plus, it's the 13th
year."
In its first year, the festival
spanned three days. Now, it's a 10-
day festival with 60 films, for which
the selection committee received 600
submissions. Thirty-six documentary
filmmakers, including several alum
ni, are visiting campus during the fes
tival for in-person panels and ap
pearances.
The festival, whose theme this
year is "Population Migration
Globalization," receives funding

support from 138 sponsors, Bojic
said, many of which are Stanford de
partments or organizations. For
Bojic, the festival's continued and
successful growth has been a person
ally satisfying progression.
"My vision is already fulfilled in a
sense because I wanted this film fes
tival to be connected to Stanford,
Palo Alto and East Palo Alto, getting
to reach all ethnic groups, and to
have the films into the different de
partments at Stanford," she said. "We
would love to have more financial
support funding is a huge issue,
but we're trying to attract Stanford
alumni interested in film and human
rights issues."
For Ronny Flamed 'lO, a volun
teer with UNAFF who took a film
seminar taught by Bojic last year, the
appeal of the festival's content is its
delicate approach to decidedly sensi
tive and complex topics.
"It is interesting to observe the
approach a filmmaker takes with his
or her 'characters,'" Flamed wrote in
an e-mail to The Daily. "In some
cases, there is a clear distinction in
the roles of protagonist and antago
nist, especially when the film focuses
on the plight of victims of human
rights abuses."
"Meanwhile, other films portray
the ambiguous nature of their char
acters with regard to their values, de

cisions, and actions, demonstrating
the complex interplay of environ
ment and individual, cultural differ
ences and international rights laws,
and the severity of all the factors in
volved in these non-fictional circum
stances," he added.
Twenty movies are still to be aired
throughout Friday, Saturday and
Sunday, along with one panel and a
closing-night party on Sunday. Bojic
pointed to "Rapping in Tehran," the
final movie on Saturday night, and
"Let's Make Money," Sunday night's
closer, as films not to miss.
Hamed served on the jury selec
tion committee and spent the sum
mer selecting films for the festival.
"We, as a collective group, then
went through the difficult and occa
sionally frustrating and emotionally
overwhelming process of limiting the
final list to 60 films," he said. "It was
an arduous task but a very rewarding
and thought-provoking learning ex
perience."
Bojic sees the film festival as a
jumping point for other academic ex
periences, such as opportunities to
talk with film directors as well as en
gage in the new "Camera as Witness"
program, which lets student groups
share the films at group events.
"Sharing these films is an oppor
tunity to discuss the issues behind
them," she said. "There aren't Holly
wood type films where you see them,
then leave and don't care. You think
about these films for a longer time af
terward."
The festival gets its namesake af
filiation from the United Nations As
sociation in Palo Alto.
In all, Bojic thinks that the incen
tive for students to partake in the fes
tival's offerings are high.
"This is the best passport for stu
dents to learn about world cultures,"
she said. "And it's free."
