## Card riding high at fall's end 
### JACK BLANCHAT CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After a long weekend away from the Farm,
the Stanford women's lacrosse team heads to
UC-Davis for a playday to wrap up its fall
schedule. The Cardinal will take on UC-Davis,
St. Mary's and California three familiar foes
for Stanford, as all three teams are Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation (MPSF) opponents.
The Card continued to roll through a diffi
cult fall schedule after completing an undefeat
ed visit to Philadelphia last weekend, going 6-0
against a schedule that included Pennsylvania,
Virginia and Maryland, the defending national
champions.
Coach Amy Bokker raved about her team's
competitive fire and team speed.
"I thought we looked great, we set up a ro
tation that everybody was playing through al
most all of the games, we had great fast breaks
in transition and defensively we made some re
ally nice stops," she said. "It was a great experi
ence on the whole, because a lot of players are
from the East Coast, so parents set up tailgates
and food for us. It's exciting that our fan base is
just as big out on the East Coast as anybody
else's."
Bokker also said that a weekend against the
best teams in the nation had proven to her that
this Cardinal team was ready to compete for
another NCAA championship.
"I think we're right there in the mix, more so
than any other year I've been here, to compete
against the top teams in the nation," Bokker
said.
The head coach gave credit to the midfield
ers for a terrific performance, highlighting jun
iors Emilie and Anna Boeri and senior Leslie
Foard for their "real spark" on the fast break.
Bokker complimented freshman Megan Lern
er for her defense, and said that Lerner and
other players will be fighting for playing time
after an excellent weekend.
"Some of our players who didn't have as much
experience had great weekends, like Jen Lang,
Maria Fortino and Ryan O'Shea, who all
played great," Bokker said, mentioning that
their play had "absolutely" earned them play
ing time this weekend at UC-Davis.
After its whirlwind weekend on the East
Coast, the Cardinal hopes to finish off the fall
season strong in the UC-Davis Halloween
Playday. The Card took on Cal in a scrimmage
game on Oct. 1 in a game on the Farm and tan
gled with St. Mary's and UC-Davis two weeks

later in a playday at Stanford. The Cardinal
emerged victorious in all three matches, and
the Cardinal has not lost a game to any of the
three opponents since an 11-9 loss to Cal in
February 2008.
That said, the Cardinal will still be looking
to improve on its past performances against its
MPSF opponents.
"We want to raise the bar from what we did
last weekend," Bokker said. "We're looking
forward to another chance to put on the uni

form and to get out against teams other than
ourselves. You can practice all you want, but
when you put on that uniform, it's a totally dif
ferent atmosphere."
Stanford defeated Cal twice last year, tak
ing down the Bears with a 12-7 victory in the
regular season and a 9-7 victory at the MPSF
Tournament in Denver.The Cardinal defeated
St. Mary's 21-5 on Senior Day last year, the
biggest margin of victory for the Card all sea
son, outshooting the Gaels 34-14. Stanford de-

feated UC-Davis 17-14 in the Card's final
home game last year to cap off a 15-5 regular
season with a 5-1 conference record.
After this weekend, the lacrosse team will
take a three-month hiatus before returning to
competition on Feb. 5 with a Stanford playday.
The Cardinal hosts its official home opener on
Feb. 13 against No. 11 Notre Dame.
