# Cross country squads headed for Pac-10s
## 
### â€“ Zach Zimmerman 
The No. 1 men's and No. 9 women's cross
country teams head to Seattle this weekend for
the Pac-10 Championships.
The Cardinal men enter the race as the team
to beat, but will have to battle adversity in
order to have success this weekend. Stanford
will be without veteran runners Brendan
Gregg and Benjamin Johnson as they recover
from injury. The team hopes to have Johnson
back in time for nationals, while Gregg is most

likely done for the duration of the cross coun
try season.
Top runners Chris Derrick, Elliott Heath
and Jake Riley, who have comprised the Cardi
nal's top three finishers in every race this sea
son, will try to lead Stanford to its first confer
ence title since 2005.
Sophomore star Kathy Kroeger, Stanford's
top runner in each race thus far, leads the
women's squad. The Cardinal recently jumped

in the rankings and is among the 10 best teams
in the nation for the first time this season.
However, conference rivals No. 2 Oregon
and No. 6 Arizona join Stanford in this group.
Both teams will make the Cardinal's run at its
first Pac-10 crown since 2007 a tough challenge.
The women's race is set to begin at 10 a.m.,
with the men scheduled to start at 11 a.m.

The Stanford men have cruised through their schedule so far, running their way to the nation's top ranking overall. Two of their biggest contribu
tors, Chris Derrick (2837) and Jacob Riley (2841), led the pack as the Cardinal men won their race in the Stanford Invitational a month ago.
