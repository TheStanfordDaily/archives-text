# MEN'S WATER POLO
## Prepping for Santa Clara 
### DASH DAVIDSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The No. 4 Stanford men's water
polo team hits the road again Fri
day, this time to do battle with its
nearby rival, the No. 11 Santa Clara
Broncos. The game will take place at
6 p.m., under the lights at the Bron
co's home pool, Sullivan Aquatic
Center.
The Broncos are one of the
hottest teams in the nation right
now, having won nine out of their
past 10 contests to improve what
was once a mediocre record (they
stood at 8-8 through their first 16
games) to a very respectable 17-9.
Santa Clara is not in the same
confer ence as Stanford, the
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation
(MPSF), but is in the Western Water
Polo Association (WWPA). The
Broncos are 7-5 so far in WWPA
league play, good for second place
in the division behind only UC-
Davis.
The Cardinal takes to the pool
again after a nice weekend win
against Pepperdine this past Sun
day. The game was a blowout, as
Stanford scored early and often and
the defense was tight throughout;
the Cardinal handily won by the
score of 15-6.
Friday will represent the fourth
straight road contest for the Cardi
nal. n fact, due to the oddities
of the water polo schedule, which is
tournament-heavy at the beginning
of the season, through its first 14
games the Cardinal has only played
once at home.
But that one game was an instant
classic, as the Cardinal defeated the
USC Trojans, a water polo power
house that hadn't lost in 15 months.
The Cardinal will be home for three
of its next four games, starting Nov.
6 against Long Beach State.
Stanford has traditionally en
joyed a good deal of success in the
pool against Santa Clara, having de
feated the South Bay neighbors six
