# MEN'S WATER POLO
## Prepping for Santa Clara 
### DASH DAVIDSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The No. 4 Stanford men's water
polo team hits the road again Fri
day, this time to do battle with its
nearby rival, the No. 11 Santa Clara
Broncos. The game will take place at
6 p.m., under the lights at the Bron
co's home pool, Sullivan Aquatic
Center.
The Broncos are one of the
hottest teams in the nation right
now, having won nine out of their
past 10 contests to improve what
was once a mediocre record (they
stood at 8-8 through their first 16
games) to a very respectable 17-9.
Santa Clara is not in the same
confer ence as Stanford, the
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation
(MPSF), but is in the Western Water
Polo Association (WWPA). The
Broncos are 7-5 so far in WWPA
league play, good for second place
in the division behind only UC-
Davis.
The Cardinal takes to the pool
again after a nice weekend win
against Pepperdine this past Sun
day. The game was a blowout, as
Stanford scored early and often and
the defense was tight throughout;
the Cardinal handily won by the
score of 15-6.
Friday will represent the fourth
straight road contest for the Cardi
nal. n fact, due to the oddities
of the water polo schedule, which is
tournament-heavy at the beginning
of the season, through its first 14
games the Cardinal has only played
once at home.
But that one game was an instant
classic, as the Cardinal defeated the
USC Trojans, a water polo power
house that hadn't lost in 15 months.
The Cardinal will be home for three
of its next four games, starting Nov.
6 against Long Beach State.
Stanford has traditionally en
joyed a good deal of success in the
pool against Santa Clara, having de
feated the South Bay neighbors six
times in the past four years, with the
Cardinal having outscored the
Broncos by a combined score of 89-
28 over that stretch.
Stanford has recently played at a
much more consistent level than it
did during its somewhat up-and
down start. This fact has been due to

the steady and excellent play of
some of the team's veteran leaders,
mainly senior captain Sage Wright,
junior driver Jacob Smith and junior
goalie Brian Pingree.
These three players have elevat
ed their games over the past few
weeks, and they have the stats and
accolades to back that statement up:
Sage Wright has scored five
goals in the past two games; Jacob
Smith is fourth in the MPSF with a
2.21 goals-scored-per-game aver
age; Pingree, on top of winning the

MPSF player of the week honors for
his vital role in Stanford's upset of
USC, is fourth in the MPSF with an
average of 7.36 saves per game.
The Santa Clara Broncos, though,
are no slouches when it comes to in
dividual accomplishments, as their
goalie, junior Michael Wishart, has
just been named the WWPA player
of the week.
Wishart anchors the defense for
the Broncos, with offensive leader
ship responsibilities belonging to
junior James Case, who has scored a

prodigious 50 goals so far this sea
son, including an astonishing five this
past weekend against Air Force, and
seniors Stephen Hobbs and Nick
Poggeti, who have both chipped in
with more than 30 goals each.
Friday's game against Santa
Clara is Stanford's final non-confer
ence contest of the year before a
pivotal stretch of conference games
to end the regular season.
