# For NFL, home sweet London?
## 
### Tom Taylor 
This Sunday, the San Francisco
49ers travel across the At
lantic Ocean to play their
home game against the Den
ver Broncos at London's
Wembley Stadium. It will be the fourth
regular season NFL game to be in the
UK since the Miami Dolphins faced the
New York Giants in 2007 and the 12th
time that an NFL game has been hosted
at Wembley.
This could be seen as a sign that
American football is making serious in
roads into the heartland of soccer, as
Wembley is England's national stadium.
But this is an exaggeration of the facts.
The games played in the UK have cer
tainly been a great thing for British NFL
fans, but beyond that core group, it's
hard to see that that much has changed.
Many see the games as an unwanted dis
traction.
It would be an excuse to say that the
England football team's struggles on the
pitch are purely down to the playing sur
face, but the continual abuse of what
should be hallowed turf by anything
from NFL games to car races has meant
the grass has had to be re-laid numerous
times. The team has never been able to
get familiar with a consistent home sur
face, and so has been denied some of
what it means to have home advantage.
At the same time, I've always won
dered how American fans view these
games. The 49ers will play the Broncos
once this year, but no local fans will be
able to watch that game up close and
personal without spending a lot of
money.
On the face of things, it seems that
the ownership of the team is putting po
tential financial rewards from addition
al exposure overseas ahead of the loyal
ty of local fans.
Even worse, they could be risking
on-field success.
In most sports, home advantage has
an accepted influence on results. The
current table for the English Premier
League shows the leaders, Chelsea, to
have won all five home games but only
two of the four games they've played on
the road. At the bottom, the three teams
sitting in the relegation zone have not
won a single game away from home.
Of the three NFL games played at
the new Wembley the "home" team
has lost twice. The statistics from
American bowl games played in the
'Bos and '9os disagree with any per
ceived disadvantage, with seven home
wins and one tie, but those were just
preseason exhibition games and so for
everyone involved they were nowhere
near as important.
Last year, the Niners won six and lost
two at home, and registered the opposite
statistics away, losing six and winning
just two. In contrast, the Broncos
showed no difference between home
and away form, winning four and losing
four in both. From this limited analysis, it
would seem that by choosing to travel,
San Francisco is surrendering its home
advantage, and any extra advantage in a
16-game season can make a big differ
ence.
To see if it is a risk to come to Lon
don, let's look at the results we already
have in a bit more detail:
In 2009, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers
were poor everywhere, so they did not
lose much by playing a home game in
the UK. The New England Patriots, in
comparison, were rock solid at home,
winning all eight, but bad on the road.
Playing in front of a neutral crowd
rather than in Florida might have made
the difference that saw them win.
A year before, in 2008, both the New
Orleans Saints and San Diego Chargers
were better at home than away. The
Chargers, though, managed to push the
Saints to the wire, clawing back at an
early lead to almost upset the home
team.
At the inaugural NFL game in 2007
the Miami Dolphins lost at Wembley
to the New York Giants in the middle
of a disastrous season that saw them
win just one game all year, at home.
The Giants, in contrast, were almost
unstoppable away, their seven wins
making up for less-than-perfect results
at home to put them on the path to
winning the Super Bowl.
With just a sample size of three to
base this all on, it is not yet clear if it is a
good thing or not to come to Wembley.
There may be some indications that the
home team is losing some of its natural
advantage, but with the Giants' form in
2007, they would gladly have played
away rather than at home.
The sports fan in me is against these
games they seem like the ultimate
betrayal of loyal home fans to earn a
quick buck, and the concept of home ad
vantage is just too ingrained in my sport
ing mindset.
