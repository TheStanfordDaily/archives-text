## Undefeated Card takes on rival Cal 
### NATE ADAMS DESK EDITOR 
Playing in its final away game of the regular
season, the Cardinal has a chance to take a big
step toward another Pac-10 title when it takes on
rival Cal in Berkeley this Saturday. No. 1 Stan
ford (15-0-2,6-0-0 Pac-10), now the nation's only
undefeated team, swept the Arizona schools last
weekend and is looking for a victory in its rival
ry game before closing out Pac-10 play against
the conference's other top squad, Oregon State,
next weekend. The Golden Bears (7-4-5,2-3-1)
forced two overtimes and suffered a loss and a

draw in that same
Arizona road trip
last weekend, and
are looking for a
victory to help en
sure a berth in the
NCAA Tourna
ment.
Stanford has
been playing some
of its best soccer of
the year recently,
extending its win
ning streak to 14
games last week
end. The success of
the nation's top
ranked team can be
attributed to a
number of factors,
but there can be no
doubt that the Car
dinal's strongest at
tribute over the last
few contests has
been its defense.

Stanford has shut out four of its last five oppo
nents, allowing a total of only 27 shots in that en
tire span. Over the year as a whole, the Cardinal
has let in just 10 goals.
"The defense is growing in confidence, their
communication is a lot sharper, they're covering
for each other better, reading the game better,"
said Stanford head coach Paul Ratcliffe. "It's
just experience over time."
Of course, the Cardinal's offense hasn't been
slouching, either. Stanford boasts the nation's
top scorer in senior forward Christen Press, and
has the country's third-best offense overall with
3.00 goals per game. One of the biggest contrib
utors for the Cardinal lately, however, has been
Lindsay Taylor.The junior forward scored a goal
in each game last weekend, earning her eighth
score of the season. Taylor was the Pac-10 fresh
man player of the year in her rookie campaign,
in which she scored 16 goals, but struggled
through illness and injury as a sophomore.
"Lindsay's having a great season, I think she's
starting to hit stride right now," Ratcliffe said.
"Her fitness level is very strong and she's going
to keep doing a lot of damage to other teams."
The Golden Bears, meanwhile, have had a
season of ups and downs. Stanford's rival has
suffered only one loss at home, but has yet to win
on the road. After not losing a match in its first
nine outings, Cal has gone 2-4-2 in its last eight.
Currently ranked at No. 44 in the Ratings Per
centage Index, which is intended to compare
teams' results and the difficulty of their sched
ules, the Bears are in line to earn a bid to the 64-
team field of the upcoming NCAA Tournament.
Ratcliffe says he isn't particularly concerned
about Cal's strong history at home this season.
"I think whenever you go away from home,
it's a little more difficult," he said. "You like hav
ing your fan support, and we have such great fan
support here at Stanford. But it's just another
road game for us, it doesn't matter where it is, we
just go in there and play the best we can."
Despite playing at home this weekend, Cal
will be without its top scorer when it hosts Stan
ford this weekend. Senior forward Alex Mor
gan, who has led the Bears in scoring and points
in each of the past four years, will be playing with
the U.S. national team in the CONCACAF

its final obstacles on the road to

with only one loss, but will be
without their top scorer Alex
Morgan this Saturday.
