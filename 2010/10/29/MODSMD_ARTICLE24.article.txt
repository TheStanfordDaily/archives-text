Coyote Grace charmed the
crowd at the CoEIo on
Wednesday night, speaking
up for the queer community and
sharing the gift of their lives and
their music with a bewitched audi
ence. The folk duo from the Bay,
comprised of Joe Stevens and
Ingrid Elizabeth, came to perform
their first gig at Stanford.
The two stood quietly on the
stage at the CoHo, their presence
alone gathering attention and qui
eting the crowd. Stevens' fingers
danced absentmindedly across his
banjo, as Elizabeth stood with her
lips near the microphone, her curly
red hair pinned back with a flower,
and her eyelids painted with glitter.
After introducing their first song,
with which, Elizabeth informed us,
they open every show, her foot
began to stomp a beat. Two
enchanting voices one smooth
and low, the other soulfully pretty
blended together and filled the
CoEIo with a bluesy but warm bal
lad.
By the second song, the beauti
ful pair had enchanted all ears and
eyes in the CoHo, and the only
background sounds that remained

were the cappuccino machines and
quiet calls of order numbers from
the kitchen. As Stevens switched to
a guitar and Elizabeth to an
upright bass, Elizabeth excitedly
mentioned that this was the best
turnout Coyote Grace had seen at a
college coffeehouse. Throughout
the hour-long set, Elizabeth's
charming interjections and Stevens'
honest insight transformed the
performance into something more
intimate than a set of songs. Coyote
Grace's lyrics alone achieve a level
of simultaneously poetic and
unapologetic truth, sliding across
the scale of emotions from tender
to awkward, from isolated to loved.
The story behind handsome
Stevens' low and sexy voice is even
more intriguing Stevens is a
transman, having made the switch
from female to male six years ago.
Today, with a scruffy beard and
deep voice, you couldn't tell unless
he told you, but the journey he's
taken to get here has been a long
and trying one that informs several
of the duo's songs.
Coyote Grace also tossed a few
covers into their set, including a
seductive rendition of the

Springsteen classic "I'm on Fire."
Perhaps the most impactful song of
the night was one written on the
road in Laramie, Wyo., for
Matthew Shephard, 10 years after
his murder. "It could've been you,
it could've been me/In Laramie,"
they sang out sadly, as the girl
beside me wiped tears from
beneath her glasses. Elizabeth had
set a somber tone before the song,
informing us that 50 percent of the
trans community will lose their life
by brutality or their own hand. The

duo's insight transcended queer
issues and reached out to the uni
versal themes of love and transi
tion.
"Love hurts," Stevens spoke
wisely, introducing their next song,
"no matter whom it is you love."
My personal favorite of the night
was a song written by Elizabeth, a
song as cute and quirky as its
singers. As Elizabeth plucked away
at a small guitar, Jack Johnson
style, she sang an adorably raunchy
and fiercely catchy tune about

stalking a cutie at a coffee shop,
smiling the whole time. The duo
ended the night with a straight set
of four gorgeous songs, their chem
istry undeniable.
As the last song ended,
Elizabeth and Stevens graciously
thanked the audience, and the
audience's applause confirmed the
evening as a glowing success.
