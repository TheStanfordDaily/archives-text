Neil Simon's farce "Rumors"
tells the story of one night
in the lives of four differ
ent couples that are attending the
10th anniversary party of their
friends Charlie and Myra. It begins
with Chris and Ken, who arrive at
the party only to discover Charlie
with a bullet hole in his ear and
Myra nowhere in sight, causing
them to think that Charlie had
attempted suicide. As the night
unfolds and the other three couples
begin to arrive, the situation gets
increasingly ridiculous as the two
try to hide the truth of what is
going on from each set of new
arrivals. In a tale involving a trip to
Japan to cure a sickly Chinese
woman, a PBS special on Hitler and
an exploding can of shaving cream,
those who know what happened to
Chris spend the night trying to
keep it from the others, because
given their upper class status, they

are concerned for the potential
repercussions an attempted suicide
and the concealing of an attempted
suicide might have for them.
This show, which originally
opened in New York in the 1980s,
has been revived by Ram's Head
Theatrical Society for Stanford
audiences. Founded in 1911, Ram's
Head is Stanford's second-oldest
student group, and largest perform
ing arts group on campus, and is
best known for the production of
the Gaieties show during Big Game
Week. Each year, Ram's Head gives
almost 120 students the chance to
sing, dance, act, direct, produce and
much more, for their annual audi
ence of over 6,000 people.
In addition to their three tradi
tional performances (Gaieties, win
ter one-acts, and a spring musical),
this year the group has added
"Rumors" to their repertoire as
