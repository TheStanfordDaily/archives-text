Neil Simon's farce "Rumors"
tells the story of one night
in the lives of four differ
ent couples that are attending the
10th anniversary party of their
friends Charlie and Myra. It begins
with Chris and Ken, who arrive at
the party only to discover Charlie
with a bullet hole in his ear and
Myra nowhere in sight, causing
them to think that Charlie had
attempted suicide. As the night
unfolds and the other three couples
begin to arrive, the situation gets
increasingly ridiculous as the two
try to hide the truth of what is
going on from each set of new
arrivals. In a tale involving a trip to
Japan to cure a sickly Chinese
woman, a PBS special on Hitler and
an exploding can of shaving cream,
those who know what happened to
Chris spend the night trying to
keep it from the others, because
given their upper class status, they

are concerned for the potential
repercussions an attempted suicide
and the concealing of an attempted
suicide might have for them.
This show, which originally
opened in New York in the 1980s,
has been revived by Ram's Head
Theatrical Society for Stanford
audiences. Founded in 1911, Ram's
Head is Stanford's second-oldest
student group, and largest perform
ing arts group on campus, and is
best known for the production of
the Gaieties show during Big Game
Week. Each year, Ram's Head gives
almost 120 students the chance to
sing, dance, act, direct, produce and
much more, for their annual audi
ence of over 6,000 people.
In addition to their three tradi
tional performances (Gaieties, win
ter one-acts, and a spring musical),
this year the group has added
"Rumors" to their repertoire as

well.
"Ram's Head put out a notice that they
were looking to do a fourth show, so we
came together and thought, what was this
campus looking for in theater that they
weren't getting?" said director Brendon
Martin 'l3. Together with producer Paul
Brownlee 'l2 (who is on the Board of
Directors for Ram's Head) and a small cast
and crew, Martin and his team have brought
to Stanford a piece of classical comedy.
Involving a traditional box set and ordi
nary (yet well-made and appropriately cho
sen) costumes, the simplicity of the set and

background details really emphasized the
play itself. The evening of the characters
becomes increasingly more hysterical as the
show goes on, and as such, having a some
what basic set really allows the audience to
focus on the plot, instead of getting distract
ed by elaborate costume changes or constant
ly-changing sets.
For many of the actors and actresses
involved in the production, this was their
first farce. Sarah Grandin 'll, who played the
role of Claire, said that although this type of
play was new to her, it was nonetheless "real
ly fun to just throw myself into a piece of

straight classic, traditional theater."
Even more impressive is the fact that the
show was put together in just a little over a
month. Tyler Fitzgerald 'l3, who played
Grandin's husband Ken, said, "the rehearsal
process was only a month long, so we've had
four weeks with this show... it's amazing to
see something come together, in week one
the show pretty much existed already."
Brownlee said that he "wanted to pro
duce something that was entertaining and
funny," and with the help of the actors and
production team, he and Martin have cer
tainly done so.

"Rumors" is showing in Pigott Theater
at 8 p.m. from Thursday through Saturday,
including a matinee show at 4 p.m. on
Saturday. Tickets are $l5 for general admis
sion and $lO for students.
