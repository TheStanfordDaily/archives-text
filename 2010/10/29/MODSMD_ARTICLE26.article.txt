# COMMUNITY, RESPECT AND PARTY
## 
### 
No band can match the stage
presence of Gogol
Bordello, who played
Oakland's Fox Theater on Oct. 14.
There's the Ecuadorian rapper
Pedro Erazo, who climbs into the
crowd and makes eye contact with
everyone in the pit as he spits out
Spanish rhymes; the percussionist
Elizabeth Sun from Hong Kong,
violently bashing away on a march
ing band-style bass drum attached
to the chest; the sage Russian violin
ist Sergey Ryabtsev, dancing across
the stage doing ballet steps to the
tune of his fiddling. And we haven't
even gotten to the lead singer yet.
This is the strength that is
Gogol Bordello. Branded early in
their career as "Gypsy punk rock,"
Gogol's latest album title, "Trans-
Continental Hustle," is a truer
reflection of their style. In addition
to its aforementioned members and
their nationalities, the group also
includes Thai percussionist-dancer
Pamela Racine, Russian accordion
ist Yuri Lemeshev, Ethiopian bassist
Tommy Gobena, Israeli guitarist
Oren Kaplan and the drummer
Oliver Charles, who hails from
Trinidad & Tobago. Last but not

least is the Ukrainian-born Eugene
Hutz, who spent seven years of his
childhood traversing refugee camps
across Eastern Europe — a source
of inspiration for much of Gogol's
music.

The diversity of the band is
reflected in their live music. There's
the ever-popular "Start Wearing
Purple," which Hutz described as a
"traditional Jewish song" at their
show in Oakland. The dub reggae
sound that carries influence in

Ethiopian music was prominent in
the opening song, "Tribal
Connection," while their closing
acoustic rendition of "Alcohol"
offered something for even classical
Spanish and flamenco guitar fans to
drool over. And it's songs like
"Tribal Connection" that really
united the whole audience and
band at the show I attended.

"No can do this, no can do
that, what the hell can you do my
friend in this place that you call
your town! Yah, yah!" belted the
band and the audience during the
opening song. One could assume
that Hutz was referring to his
refugee camp or global traversing
experiences or the blandness of

American suburban or urban life.
Regardless, the song speaks to any
one who's felt the urge for sponta
neous partying.
Gogol Bordello operates with
the ethos that people everywhere

just want to interact, respect each
other and party (as Hutz summa
rizes "Yo! Community, respect and
party") and for whatever reason,
these things just don't happen
enough.
That's where the Gogol show
comes in. The audience was a mix
of immigrants, hipsters, older folks,
frat guys, Jewish kids, 12-year-old
crowd-surfers, Oakland locals and
whatnot all dancing and moshing.
And unlike other moshes, when
someone fell over in the pit, every
one stopped, gave the guy or girl a
hand, clapped and then returned to
chaos. It was a beautiful, benign

chaos. A person even dropped a
phone in the pit and the crowd
stopped to help him find it.
And what's even more beautiful
is how the party of the show con
tinued on after the show was over.

My friends and I left the show
happily running into people we met
in the pit. As we started heading
past the venue in the direction of
the food joint, I noticed there were
a couple cute hipster girls dancing
on the sidewalk across from the
venue to inaudible music. Still in
dancing/concert mode, I felt it was
just too good an opportunity to
pass up. So we took a detour and
dashed over to join them in the
dancing. A guy with a decked-out
motorcycle sound system then
started blasting Michael Jackson for
us from a hooked-up laptop for a
brief but epic dance party.
