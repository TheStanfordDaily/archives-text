## A 						night out with Gogol Bordello

After grabbing some food at
Giant Burger, we went to hang out
side the tour buses while we fin
ished our food in the hopes that we
might snag some photos with our
musical favorites.
And fortunately, the timing was
just right. The violinist Sergey
Ryabtsev, by far the nicest guy in
the group, stopped to chat with us
as we snagged a photo. My Puerto
Rican friend called the guitarist
Pedro Erazo over in Spanish, and
they chatted for a few minutes en
espanol. And then Lemeshev and
Gobena came strolling on over,
uttering the magic words, "You
know, we are all going to a bar
down the street if y'all want to
come with, just follow along."
After some prodding from
Gogol singer Hutz, we headed off
toward the bar with Hutz and the
tour manager. As we walked, we
spoke on the street dance party ear
lier, to which he replied simply,
"Community. Respect." I asked him
if it was really OK that a couple of
fans came and partied with the
band, to which he responded, "Sure
thing, man. Of course, respect."
The night took some twists, but
my friends and I wound up togeth
er in the end. I may not have par
tied it up with the band or even
taken shots with them, but that was
perhaps the best night of communi
ty, respect and partying I've ever
had. I bonded with my buddies as
we ignored our academic obliga
tions in going to the show, moshing
and crowd surfing our troubles
away. I fell in love with the hybrid
immigrant-hipster-Oakland com
munity that formed for a magnifi
cent Michael jackson dance party in
the street. And to top it off, I had
the closest thing to good Chicago
fast food one can find out here on
the West Coast.
What more could one ask for?
Thank you Gogol Bordello,
Oakland and my friends.
