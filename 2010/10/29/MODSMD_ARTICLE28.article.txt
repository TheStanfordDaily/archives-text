Right now, I'm craving classic
pieces with a little bit of per
version thrown in for good
measure. It's a mix of schoolgirl, rebel
lious 'sos rock star, '6os French Brigitte
Bardot and Cambridge, articulated in
luxury materials and clean lines. All
the pieces balance out their sexual
connotations with equal amounts of
design and wit it's a pretty smart
outfit.

Leather shorts:
I'm on the hunt for the perfect pair.
They were all over last year's spring runways,
Chloe, Chanel, Alexander Wang. So last sea
son, maybe? No, it's still California, and I
have no qualms with year-round shorts
wearing. This length also gives you this fall's
Isabel Marant 'sos rock star feel without
actually wearing full-length red leather
pants. The words leather and short next to
each other still elicit some raised eyebrows,
but when done buttery and muted with
clean tailoring, they manage to be edgy and
sleek at the same time.
White Oxford:
I like adding the powerfully androgy
nous shirt to temper the leather shorts. It
adds balance to the sensuality of the leather
but also has its own appeal in its definite
starkness. This pairing is very much inspired
by the Proenza Schouler fall-winter 2010
take on the schoolgirl aesthetic. Although
still clean and white, I also alternatively like
the softer Chloe Peter Pan collar option,
introducing its own paradox with curved

lines against otherwise sharp shapes.
Ladylike heel:
Confession time, I really am just
obsessed with these shoes; Louis Vuitton
fall-winter 2010 was absolute perfection. I
love the exaggerated proportion of the taste
ful, stacked heel paired with the flat bow
that captured the spirit of the early '6os
French feel of the fall show. They were
shown in ostrich, velvet, calf and satin in
two different heights; shorter for the long
legged girl on whom shorts and heels
become absurd, and the sky-high option for
those of us less vertically blessed, but not
lacking in gumption.
Camel coat:
This iconic garment made its tri
umphant return with Phoebe Philo's
momentous comeback at Celine two seasons
ago. It marks the return to luxury dressing
and classic investments that defy trends. And
even though I worship at Philo's minimalist
altar, I love the idea of a slight twist, main
taining the quality and class that accompa

nies the coat, but matching a more interest
ing line to the clean leather shorts and crisp
white shirt.
The Satchel:
Continuing my ode to Proenza, I had to
include the much-coveted PSI invented by
Jack and Lazaro to be the perfect lust-wor
thy object. Not only is it practical, versatile
and really, really pretty, it is the most suc
cessful rendering of the messenger bag
briefcase hybrid in its feminine and luxuri
ous form. The Mulberry version equally
meets the "it" factor, infused with the aura of
coolness of its inspiration, Alexa Chung. The
"Alexa" comes with the connotations of
British school bag gone "it" girl. Clearly the
marketing is working. Who doesn't want to
be an effortlessly fashionable British school
girl?
