## CARD LOOKING FOR STRONGER OUTING 
### KABIR SAWHNEY MANAGING EDITOR 
In a matchup featuring two of the country's top
quarterbacks, the No. 13 Stanford football team
heads to Seattle this week to take on Washington.
The Cardinal (6-1, 3-1 Pac-10) is coming off a
somewhat weak showing against Washington State
(1-7,0-5), the doormat of the Pac-10. Though Stan
ford beat the Cougars at home last weekend, 38-28,
the Card was fairly lackluster throughout the game
and allowed two Cougar touchdowns late on big
passes from WSU quarterback JeffTuel. Discipline
also appeared to slip somewhat, as Stanford was
penalized eight times for 80 yards.
Stanford's passing attack, its biggest weapon in
recent weeks, showed signs of weakness against a
Washington State defense that ranks near the bot
tom of the Football Bowl Subdivision. Redshirt
sophomore quarterback Andrew Luck, who has
been gaining some Heisman hype, finished the day

NOTES ! Stanford will need a win this weekend to bol
ster its hopes of a berth in the Rose Bowl as it heads
north to take on the Huskies. Washington has had an
up-and-down season so far, but could pull back to
five-hundred overall with a win at home this weekend,
where they are 2-2.



with 20-28 passing for just 190 yards.
He did throw three touchdowns, but
also tossed an interception to the
Cougars.
However, the Cardinal appears to
have officially found its top tailback
in true sophomore Stepfan Taylor,
who rushed 27 times for 142 yards
and two scores. Indeed, the running
game carried the Card against Wash
ington State Stanford went to the
air 28 times, but called 47 runs
throughout the afternoon.
While Stanford's offense has dis
tinguished itself as one of the confer
ence's best, sitting second in the con
ference with 42.6 points per game,
the Huskies (3-4, 2-2 Pac-10) have
been a disappointment thus far this
season.
Washington was expected to fi
nally become a factor in the Pac-10
race, but instead has been incredibly
inconsistent. Since opening the sea
son with a loss to Brigham Young, the
Huskies have alternated wins and
losses. Washington's two conference
wins also came by a combined two
points it beat USC in Los Angeles
on a last-second field goal four weeks
ago, and felled Oregon State at home
two weeks ago in double overtime as
the Beavers failed to score on their
final two-point conversion. Both
teams were ranked when they played
Washington.
However, the Huskies have also
lost by decisive margins to confer
ence foes, both at home and on the
road. Washington lost to Arizona
State, 24-14, before getting blown out
at Arizona last week, 44-14. That
might not be good news for the Card,
though if Washington keeps up its
recent pattern of play, it's due for a

win this weekend in the friendly con
fines of Husky Stadium.
By far the most puzzling part of
Washington's struggles this year has
been the subpar performance from
its much-vaunted offense. Led by
NFL prospect Jake Locker (who was
projected as the No. 1 overall pick in
last year's NFL Draft before decid
ing to return for his senior season),
head coach Steve Sarkisian's attack
was supposed to overpower oppo
nents and lead Washington back to
national relevance. Instead, the
Huskies rank near the bottom of the
Pac-10 they are eighth in scoring
offense (24.9 points per game),
eighth in pass efficiency and seventh
in passing offense.
Locker in particular has had an
up-and-down season. Though he has
shown flashes of brilliance, he has
failed to live up to the hype that sur
rounded him entering the season
(highlighted by a somewhat prema
ture "Locker for Heisman" cam
paign in the preseason). Among Pac
-10 quarterbacks. Locker is sixth in
passing yards per game and eighth in
pass efficiency.
All of these signs point to a some
what lopsided matchup this week
end. However, Locker and his of
fense could have a big day against a
Stanford defense that has looked
shaky in recent weeks.
In the Cardinal's last two games,
its passing defense has been abysmal.
USC's Matt Barkley shredded the
Stanford secondary for 390 yards on
28-45 passing and three touchdowns
in the Trojans' Oct. 9 visit to the
Farm. The unit didn't exactly impress
against Tuel and Washington State,
either, as the quarterback gashed

Stanford with 21-28 passing for 298
yards and four touchdowns. Overall,
the Cardinal has given up a com
bined 115 points in its last three
games.
Beyond the stat sheet, the Stan
ford defense simply hasn't looked
like a unit capable of making big
stops in recent weeks. It was unable
to make critical plays late in the
game against the Trojans, and looked
complacent at times against the
Cougars, especially in giving up a
huge 74-yard touchdown with 35 sec
onds remaining.
The secondary could get a much
needed boost if junior safety Delano
Howell, a linchpin of the unit, returns
this week from an undisclosed injury.
Howell sat out the game against
Washington State, but Stanford head
coach Jim Harbaugh has given no in
dication on whether Howell will be
available.
Though Stanford's defense hasn't
been very strong, Washington's de
fense has also struggled in confer
ence play. The Huskies are ninth in
the Pac-10 in scoring defense, and
have given up at least 31 points to
three out of their four conference op
ponents to date.
While the pass defense is re
spectable, giving up 221.3 yards per
game, Taylor could have another big
day against a Washington front
seven that ranks among the worst in
the Pac-10. The Huskies rank ninth
in the conference in rushing de
fense, giving up 202.7 yards per
game. In its last game against Ari
zona, Wildcat running back Keola
Antolin took 14 carries for 114
yards (an average of 8.1 yards per
carry). The Arizona offense simply

ran over the Huskies, notching 234
yards on 43 carries overall.
Looking at the bigger picture for
both teams, a win for Washington
would go a long way toward securing
bowl eligibility. The Huskies need
three more wins to earn a bowl berth,
and while they have five games left to
play, one of them is against No. 2
Oregon in Eugene. If Washington
falls to both the Cardinal and the

Ducks, it will need to win out in order
to take a postseason trip.
Stanford, meanwhile, has already
secured bowl eligibility, but still has
its sights set on a possible Rose Bowl
berth in Pasadena. To stay near the
top of the conference, it will need to
bounce the Huskies, as the Cardinal
still has tough games against No. 15

Arizona, California and Oregon
State remaining.
Stanford will take on Washington
on Saturday at Husky Stadium in
Seattle. Kickoff is scheduled for 4
p.m.

ford beat the Cougars at home last weekend, 38-28,
the Card was fairly lackluster throughout the game
and allowed two Cougar touchdowns late on big
passes from WSU quarterback JeffTuel. Discipline
also appeared to slip somewhat, as Stanford was
penalized eight times for 80 yards.

NOTES ! Stanford will need a win this weekend to bol
ster its hopes of a berth in the Rose Bowl as it heads
north to take on the Huskies. Washington has had an
up-and-down season so far, but could pull back to
five-hundred overall with a win at home this weekend,
where they are 2-2.



with 20-28 passing for just 190 yards.
He did throw three touchdowns, but
also tossed an interception to the
Cougars.
However, the Cardinal appears to
have officially found its top tailback
in true sophomore Stepfan Taylor,
who rushed 27 times for 142 yards
and two scores. Indeed, the running
game carried the Card against Wash
ington State Stanford went to the
air 28 times, but called 47 runs
throughout the afternoon.
While Stanford's offense has dis
tinguished itself as one of the confer
ence's best, sitting second in the con
ference with 42.6 points per game,
the Huskies (3-4, 2-2 Pac-10) have
been a disappointment thus far this
season.
Washington was expected to fi
nally become a factor in the Pac-10
race, but instead has been incredibly
inconsistent. Since opening the sea
son with a loss to Brigham Young, the
Huskies have alternated wins and
losses. Washington's two conference
wins also came by a combined two
points it beat USC in Los Angeles
on a last-second field goal four weeks
ago, and felled Oregon State at home
two weeks ago in double overtime as
the Beavers failed to score on their
final two-point conversion. Both
teams were ranked when they played
Washington.
However, the Huskies have also
lost by decisive margins to confer
ence foes, both at home and on the
road. Washington lost to Arizona
State, 24-14, before getting blown out
at Arizona last week, 44-14. That
might not be good news for the Card,
though if Washington keeps up its
recent pattern of play, it's due for a

win this weekend in the friendly con
fines of Husky Stadium.
By far the most puzzling part of
Washington's struggles this year has
been the subpar performance from
its much-vaunted offense. Led by
NFL prospect Jake Locker (who was
projected as the No. 1 overall pick in
last year's NFL Draft before decid
ing to return for his senior season),
head coach Steve Sarkisian's attack
was supposed to overpower oppo
nents and lead Washington back to
national relevance. Instead, the
Huskies rank near the bottom of the
Pac-10 they are eighth in scoring
offense (24.9 points per game),
eighth in pass efficiency and seventh
in passing offense.
Locker in particular has had an
up-and-down season. Though he has
shown flashes of brilliance, he has
failed to live up to the hype that sur
rounded him entering the season
(highlighted by a somewhat prema
ture "Locker for Heisman" cam
paign in the preseason). Among Pac
-10 quarterbacks. Locker is sixth in
passing yards per game and eighth in
pass efficiency.
All of these signs point to a some
what lopsided matchup this week
end. However, Locker and his of
fense could have a big day against a
Stanford defense that has looked
shaky in recent weeks.
In the Cardinal's last two games,
its passing defense has been abysmal.
USC's Matt Barkley shredded the
Stanford secondary for 390 yards on
28-45 passing and three touchdowns
in the Trojans' Oct. 9 visit to the
Farm. The unit didn't exactly impress
against Tuel and Washington State,
either, as the quarterback gashed

Stanford with 21-28 passing for 298
yards and four touchdowns. Overall,
the Cardinal has given up a com
bined 115 points in its last three
games.
Beyond the stat sheet, the Stan
ford defense simply hasn't looked
like a unit capable of making big
stops in recent weeks. It was unable
to make critical plays late in the
game against the Trojans, and looked
complacent at times against the
Cougars, especially in giving up a
huge 74-yard touchdown with 35 sec
onds remaining.
The secondary could get a much
needed boost if junior safety Delano
Howell, a linchpin of the unit, returns
this week from an undisclosed injury.
Howell sat out the game against
Washington State, but Stanford head
coach Jim Harbaugh has given no in
dication on whether Howell will be
available.
Though Stanford's defense hasn't
been very strong, Washington's de
fense has also struggled in confer
ence play. The Huskies are ninth in
the Pac-10 in scoring defense, and
have given up at least 31 points to
three out of their four conference op
ponents to date.
While the pass defense is re
spectable, giving up 221.3 yards per
game, Taylor could have another big
day against a Washington front
seven that ranks among the worst in
the Pac-10. The Huskies rank ninth
in the conference in rushing de
fense, giving up 202.7 yards per
game. In its last game against Ari
zona, Wildcat running back Keola
Antolin took 14 carries for 114
yards (an average of 8.1 yards per
carry). The Arizona offense simply

ran over the Huskies, notching 234
yards on 43 carries overall.
Looking at the bigger picture for
both teams, a win for Washington
would go a long way toward securing
bowl eligibility. The Huskies need
three more wins to earn a bowl berth,
and while they have five games left to
play, one of them is against No. 2
Oregon in Eugene. If Washington
falls to both the Cardinal and the

Ducks, it will need to win out in order
to take a postseason trip.
Stanford, meanwhile, has already
secured bowl eligibility, but still has
its sights set on a possible Rose Bowl
berth in Pasadena. To stay near the
top of the conference, it will need to
bounce the Huskies, as the Cardinal
still has tough games against No. 15

Arizona, California and Oregon
State remaining.
Stanford will take on Washington
on Saturday at Husky Stadium in
Seattle. Kickoff is scheduled for 4
p.m.

The Cardinal has seen important contributions and big plays on both sides of the ball from an eclectic group of players
this season. Fifth-year senior Austin Yan cy, has played in all seven games and has 16 tackles for the Card.
