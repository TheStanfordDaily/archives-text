## CARD LOOKING FOR STRONGER OUTING 
### KABIR SAWHNEY MANAGING EDITOR 
In a matchup featuring two of the country's top
quarterbacks, the No. 13 Stanford football team
heads to Seattle this week to take on Washington.
The Cardinal (6-1, 3-1 Pac-10) is coming off a
somewhat weak showing against Washington State
(1-7,0-5), the doormat of the Pac-10. Though Stan
ford beat the Cougars at home last weekend, 38-28,
the Card was fairly lackluster throughout the game
and allowed two Cougar touchdowns late on big
passes from WSU quarterback JeffTuel. Discipline
also appeared to slip somewhat, as Stanford was
penalized eight times for 80 yards.
Stanford's passing attack, its biggest weapon in
recent weeks, showed signs of weakness against a
Washington State defense that ranks near the bot
tom of the Football Bowl Subdivision. Redshirt
sophomore quarterback Andrew Luck, who has
been gaining some Heisman hype, finished the day

NOTES ! Stanford will need a win this weekend to bol
ster its hopes of a berth in the Rose Bowl as it heads
north to take on the Huskies. Washington has had an
up-and-down season so far, but could pull back to
five-hundred overall with a win at home this weekend,
where they are 2-2.
