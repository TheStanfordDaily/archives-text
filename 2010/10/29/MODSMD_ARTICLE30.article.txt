# Horror Movie PSA

To commemorate the lives of
the countless pretty young
things lost to a Freddy or Jason
or some other supernatural killer over
the years, Intermission would like to
release a special public service
announcement to all once and future
horror film characters. Here are some
tips to drastically increase your
chances of survival.
First off, you can probably avoid
the entire debacle by calling the police
all that "the phone lines are dead!"
hogwash doesn't work anymore;
everyone and their mom has a cell
phone. Use it or face the consequences
(death).
A common root of the problem is
the whole "curiosity-killed-the-cast"
idea. If it's a dark, stormy night, and
you think it would totally be the sick
est thing ever to crack open your
grandma's old satanic book and mess
around, chances are high that it's
definitively not. Odds are you'll awak
en an ancient murderous force that's
been waiting years for someone stupid
enough to release it so it can slaughter
you and all of your extremely attrac
tive friends. Or maybe you think it
would be cool to steal an old relic
from a malevolent force that will
destroy you if you don't give it back.
Also a dumb idea.
The curiosity thing applies to
pretty much the entire movie if
you hear a scary boom coming from
off in the woods, upstairs or some-

where other than where you are, do
not, repeat, do not go and check it
out. Stay where you are. It will not
gain you man points or street cred.
Unless you know it's an unpleasant
but otherwise harmless ghoul thump
ing around your attic, our statistical
experts here at Intermission calculate
your chance of survival at approxi
mately 5 percent. Sometimes, it pays
to be apathetic. On the other hand, if
you hear an ominous sound coming
from where you are, you should prob
ably get the heck out of there ASAP.
But never ever run upstairs, into the
basement or any place where a psycho
killer could easily trap you inside.
If someone does get killed from
wandering off, that should be a red
flag to the surviving friends not to
split up and explore in small groups
(hello cast of every single "Scream"
movie). This is especially pertinent if
the power suddenly goes out.
However, we all know you guys proba
bly will anyway. The least you can do
then is not take a bath or shower that
leaves you naked and vulnerable
("Psycho"), have sex ("Friday the
13th") that leaves you naked and vul
nerable or do anything else that leaves
you naked and vulnerable.
Also important: make sure you
have a good sense of balance and are
physically fit in general. In
"Zombieland," there's a reason why
Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg) stresses
"Cardio" as number one on his list of
tools for survival. Horror films liter
ally are survival of the fittest. Those
who stumble and fall, generally the
same who flail and wail, are

the surest to be axed first. If your hys
teria prevents you from running capa
bly, try at least to walk briskly. It'll
help have you ever seen Jason
Voorhees or Mike Myers run or even
casually jog for that matter? Stomping
menacingly is their general mode of
transportation.
Another thing: Intermission is
not condoning child abuse by any
means, but if spooky kids start haunt
ing you or crawling out of your TV,
you have a right to kick the little bug
gers in the face.
Next, if you're on a road trip, take
care of your gas tank, bladder, tire
pressure and anything else you can
think of in a crowded, public area.
These are all precautions to keep you
from pulling over in a creepy, deserted
area that is most likely populated by
A) zombies, B) freaky folk from "The
Hills Have Eyes," C) vampires or D)
murderous children who like corn.
Precautions can go a long way.
When buying a house, check the his
tory. Was anyone brutally murdered?
Is there a curse on the house? Did
someone mysteriously go missing?
Does your wise, vaguely ethnic house
keeper sense bad vibes in the house? If
you answer "yes" to any of those ques
tions, do not purchase the home
unless you have a death wish.
Now please, horror movie casts,
take our advice to heart. We tried to
warn you.
