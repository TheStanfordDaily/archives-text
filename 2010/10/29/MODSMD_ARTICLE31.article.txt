Not feeling the Mausoleum on
Saturday night? Do you want to
celebrate on Sunday, but you have
class at 9 a.m. Monday morning?
There are plenty of ways to get
into the spooky holiday spirit with
out having to follow the same
party routine every year. Here are
some suggestions:

Scary Movie Marathon
Staying in with a bowl of popcorn and a
horror film is a great way to freak your
self out on a dark, gloomy night. Some
favorites include "The Ring," 'The
Orphanage," the "Saw" series, "Carrie,"
"The Shining," etc.

Trick-or-Treat
Who says this activity is just for lit
tle kids? If you're feeling the urge to
stick to traditional entertainment,
throw on that costume from
Saturday's party again, grab a bag
and head over to graduate housing
for some old-fashioned fun.

Palo Alto
if you want to get off campus on Sunday
night, try grabbing a couple of friends and
going into Palo Alto for dinner. The best part
about Halloween for those who opt against
trick-or-treating? Shorter lines at restaurants.

Game Night
it sounds pretty boring, but having a game night
can be the perfect solution for a dull night in. For
something spooky to represent Halloween, try
getting together a game of "Mafia." Or, if you or a
friend owns it, "Clue" is also a great mystery
board game for the holiday.

Haunted Houses
Looking for a real scare on Saturday? Try
going to some haunted houses with a
couple of pals for a guaranteed bone
chilling night. Local attractions include
Fear Overload (San Leandro, $2O) and
Winchester Mystery House (San Jose,
$25).

Steam Tunnels
If you're feeling a little adventurous, take
some time to search for the tunnel
entrances (hint: look near The Axe and
Palm) for some traditional Stanford
steam-tunneling and a great game of
flashlight tag.
