Leave it to Clint Eastwood to
ham up the insanely complex
topic of what happens to us
after we die. After grappling with
human loss in such unabashedly
sentimental schlock as "Million
Dollar Baby" and "Changeling,"
Eastwood's finally reached his nadir
with "Hereafter," a withfilm that
attempts to convey the different
ways in which we collectively deal
with the possibility of an afterlife.
"Hereafter" seems curiously empty,
devoid of any greater message
about the human experience at all.
Eastwood's intention here
seems not to answer the question
of where we go after we die, but to
convey that death holds a different

meaning for each of us. If anything,
Clint Eastwood's earlier heroes,
particularly in his Westerns, viewed
death with a sort of unflinching
strength. Here, though, we instead
focus on three people who don't
exactly know how to deal with this
spiritual reality. After drowning in
the Indian Ocean tsunami and
miraculously being resuscitated,
Marie (Cecile de France), a French
telejournalist vacationing in
Thailand, is haunted by intermit
tent visions of this realm beyond.
George (Matt Damon), on the
other hand, is a San Francisco
based psychic handicapped by his
ability to communicate with the
dead. Finally, there's Marcus, a 12-

year-old London-bred boy who's
struggling to justify his twin broth
er's death in a freak accident.
These stories, of course, are
told with the same non-linear,
interwoven cross-cultural structure
employed by Alejandro Gonzalez
Inarritu in most of his films
("Babel," "21 Grams"), albeit with
so little success that Eastwood's
attempt comes off as downright
facile and childish. He presents the
afterlife as something out of a
Lifetime movie heaven is, in his
mind, a bunch of blurry silhouettes
crowded into a room of bright,
indiscernible light. There's no real
sense of interconnectedness
between these people's lives, either;

we spend so much time away from
each individual that we don't feel a
thing for any of these characters,
regardless of the obvious tragedy of
their day-to-day lives.
The actors can't save this pro
saic script, but, then again, who
can? Cecile de France has the kind
of airy, plaintive presence on the
screen that in itself gives the film a
feeling of mediation, yet her per
formance is hardly as complex as it
needs to be. We don't believe for a
second that this is a woman who's
experienced a realm beyond human
understanding, unable to make
sense of this conspicuously materi
alized world.
Had he been given more com

plex source material, Matt Damon
could've penetrated right down to
this character's soul, but he's
instead reduced to an angst-ridden
fulfillment of the "angry young
man" stereotype. Most excruciating,
though, is Bryce Dallas Howard,
who, from the moment she klutzes
onto the screen in a brief support
ing role, provides the sort of unin
tentional comic relief that merely
underlines the film's self-impor
tance.
If there has been one auteur
that has come to stand for a dis
tinctively American way of film
making, it's Clint Eastwood. Yet
there seems to be a general unspo
ken notion among cine-philes that
all of his work should be glorified,
regardless of the fact that he's suc
cumbed to easy pathos as of late,
skimming metaphysical themes
with a surprising lack of subtlety.
"Hereafter" is, perhaps, the most
ill-conceived of his efforts. Sad real
ity, Dirty Harry some topics are
bigger than their directors.
