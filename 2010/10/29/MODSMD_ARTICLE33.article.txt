On Monday, the American
Constitution Society and
the Federalist Society of
Stanford hosted a screening of
"Advise and Dissent," a feature
length documentary on the confir
mation of Supreme Court justices.
While "Advise and Dissent" alleges
to examine the battles behind
Supreme Court confirmations, it
falls short of painting a full picture
and chooses instead to focus on the
confirmations of two conservative
justices, John Roberts, Jr. and
Samuel Alito. This narrowed focus,
matched with lackluster editing, is
ultimately the film's downfall.

"Advise and
Dissent" opened promis
ingly, with a dramatic
overture accompanying
historical footage of the
Supreme Court decision:
that have shaped
America, from school
integration to abortion,
from affirmative action

to gay rights. Depicting
the shift from the more bipartisan,
cooperative 1980s to the staunchly
divided Congress of today, "Advise
and Dissent" sought to present the
dangers of a politicized judiciary.
Using Senator Arlen Specter as the
film's surprisingly fitting protago
nist, "Advise and Dissent" discussed
the "turbulent partisanship" that

makes choosing justices less about,
well, justice, and more about party
lines. The film offered a few
moments of real personality by
using shots that linger just a bit
longer than we're comfortable with,
revealing the qualities behind the
politicians' facades.
But as the documentary pro
gressed, the plot seemed to drag on
longer than the film's 82 minutes,

for lack of real intrigue and wit.
Furthermore, the bias of the film
makers was poorly balanced, and
the agenda behind the film became
evident.
Showing clips of the fanatic and
frightening Third Branch
Conference, a far-right group led by
uncharismatic Manuel Miranda, the
documentary focused half of its
attention on the conservative move
ment hoping to bring right-wing
justices to the Supreme Court.
Miranda is an easy villain for the
film, as he reminisces gleefully on
the influence he perceives the Third
Branch Conference to have on
Washington. But by focusing on
Miranda, "Advise and Dissent" miss
es the big-picture problems: that
stubborn hypocrisy runs rampant
on both parties, and nominating a

liberal justice is just as much a
power struggle as nominating a con
servative.
Unexciting editing paired with
the biased focus of the filmmakers
made for a lackluster documentary,
which had the potential to be great
but fell a few notches short. The sys
tem by which we appoint justices in
this country is a fascinating one,
with many faults to be addressed,
but by focusing solely on the con
servative justices, and not the overall
corruption of the system, "Advise
and Dissent" passes on the opportu
nity to show the joint hypocrisy
which plagues Congress.
