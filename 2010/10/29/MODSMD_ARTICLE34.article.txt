Shakira's seventh album, "Sale el Sol,"
dropped on Oct. 19 and marks a mat
uration in Shakira's career. A bilingual
album which jumps from acoustic rock jams
to Latin dance mixes to piano ballads finds
its coherence in Shakira's distinct and seduc
tive voice.
The album opens with the eponymous
"Sale el Sole," a pretty standard acoustic
rock tune made beautiful by Shakira's voice,
crooning out Spanish with a mix of tender
ness and desperation.
Next, Shakira tells us to "dance or die"
in "Loca," the first of several collaborative
tracks on the album. The highlight of this
hip-shaking, moderately paced dance track
is Dizzee Rascal's raps, set to Latin beats and
complemented by Shakira's famous moans
and sultry rolled R's. "Gordita," featuring
Residente Calle 13, is more of the same, this
time setting Shakira's fierce grunts against
an electronic underpinning. "Antes de la
Seis" brings us to a softer place, with
Shakira's voice stripped to its sensitive core.
The soft piano is complemented by the
swelling of an acoustic guitar, as Shakira
offers her listeners a far more vulnerable
persona.
Before we are completely lulled,
"Addicted to You" hurries back to the hip
swaying dance beat. And then it's back to
tenderness with "Lo Que Mas," a sad ballad
that steps into the realm of the melodramat
ic. One of the best tracks on the album is
"Rabiosa," featuring Pitbull's familiar inter

jections. It's exactly the kind of undeniably
sexy song you'd expect from a
Shakira/Pitbull collaboration, a smart and
seductive dance mix that won't let your hips
sit still. Pitbull's raspy raps mesh well with
Shakira's sultry moans and invitations to
"come get a little closer."
And of course, the album wouldn't be
complete without three versions of Shakira's
smash hit "Waka Waka," written for the 2010
World Cup, an uplifting song which leaves
the listener feeling empowered and ready to
win a soccer match or dance the night away.
Shakira's "Sale el Sol" is a fantastically
diverse album with some awesome collabo
rations and a truly impressive range of emo
tions. While a few songs felt contrived in
comparison to the powerful honesty of the
album as a whole, "Sale el Sol" is overall an
exciting collection of songs which offer the
possibility of seduction and relaxation in
one album. It's a sexy, self-assured and suc
cessful leap from the pop music vibe that
marks her recent hits.
The sheer power of Shakira's vocal
chords is clearly the focus of the album, and
that voice does not disappoint, calling on us
to rock out, to make love, to feel deeply and
above all, to rise up, our hips swaying and
our hearts pulsing to a distinctly Latin
tempo.
