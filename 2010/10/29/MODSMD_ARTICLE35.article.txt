Once upon a time (and isn't this a fit
ting phrase for such a fairy tale fanat
ic?), Taylor Swift was a fresh new
artist, the champion of every fragile female
heart that had been beating between 11 and 17
years. To everyone else, she was a talented
songwriter with a flair for giving people what
they wanted to hear.
Two albums later, Swift has gone a com
bined 23 times platinum and is a worldwide
phenomenon. However, her third album,
"Speak Now," is nothing more than a phenom
enal flop that comes across as little more than a
rework of her freshman and sophomore
albums.
Swiff has two themes she is always eager to
sing about: love and innocence. Somehow,
after four years and dozens of similar songs,
Swiff still lacks the inspiration to write more
than three tracks that deviate from the norm.
"Speak Now" begins weakly with the upbeat
single "Mine," which tells the same story about
holding hands, falling in love and staying
together.
The album ends as feebly as it begins; song
nine, "Enchanted," is yet another tune about
love at first sight through the eyes of a weak
willed girl who pleads, "Please don't be in love
with someone else." The lyrics get even more
pathetically dependent ("So I'll watch you live
in pictures as I used to watch you sleep ... ")
in the 13th track, a slow ballad predictably
titled "Last Kiss."
However, no song on the album is as com
ically terrible as her poor choice for a second
single, "Mean." The track is almost certainly the
obligatory "country" song in this more-pop
than-country album, and the lyrics are remark
ably immature and uninspired ("you, with
your voice like nails on a chalkboard ... why
you gotta be so mean?").

A few glimmers of hope come across in
the album. One of her strongest tracks, "Back
to December," laments the loss of a potential

romance and shows the depth of songwriting
that Swiff has the potential for, if only she
would commit to forging a slightly different
path than that of ineffectively retelling another
version of the same love story.
Similarly, Swiff shows a deviation from
her typical sappiness in "Innocent," "Better
than Revenge" and "Dear John," a trio of accu
satory tracks that slam her enemies, the last of
which boasts a lazy, riff-driven melody ironi
cally reminiscent of alleged former paramour
John Mayer. Nonetheless, the songs might be
more powerful if she would address their obvi
ous recipients directly (or stop talking about
the same people, namely Joe Jonas).
And finally, despite its stereotypical lyrics,
the title track, "Speak Now," showcases the
vocal talents that are often conspicuously
absent from Swiff's biggest hits and live per
formances.
But despite giving listeners a glimpse into
the depths of her psyche and the range of her
talents, Swift has a debilitating tendency to
stick to what is familiar, and that is nothing
more than "girl meets boy, girl falls in love with
boy, boy changes girl's outlook on life so much
that she needs to write a song about it."
Understandably, Swiff has a target audi
ence, but at 20 years old, her time to write for
preteens through preteen eyes will soon run
out eventually, she will have to mature as an
artist. Although "Speak Now" takes a small but
noticeable step towards her evolution of musi
cal style, Swiff has a long way to go to transi
tion from little girl to adult woman.
