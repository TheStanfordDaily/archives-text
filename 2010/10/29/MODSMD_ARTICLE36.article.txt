## Q&A: Surfer Blood 
### â€“ ryan MAC contact ryan : rbmac@stanford. edu 
Jamming in an interview an
hour before their scheduled set
at Treasure Island Music
:ival 2010, the members of
Surfer Blood were just enjoying the
moment. The five-piece band, hail
ing from West Palm Beach, Fla.,
were hardly out of their element,
taking the festival in as spectators
as well as performers. On Sunday,
lead singer JP Pitts and drummer
TJ Schwarz dropped by behind the
main stage to discuss their fast
tracked rise to success, their short
lived college careers and, of course,
surfing. Pitts also gave us one awe
some prediction that he'd meet
Belle and Sebastian, a dream that
he later realized when he joined the
Scottish headliners on stage Sunday
night. We kept this one short for
one, because of Surfer Blood's
upcoming set, but also because
conversation was made impossible
by the overpowering audio glory
that is Broken Social Scene, who
began their set just as the interview
began.

So, I heard you guys sound a lot
like Weezer?
JP Pitts: Fuck you.
TJ Schwarz: <Yelling at Broken

Social Scene taking the stage> Kevin
Drew! Kevinnnnnnnnnn.
JP: Kevinnnnnnnnnnn. You're
beautiful!
TJ: Nice hat.
How are you guys doing today?
TJ: Oh we're great dude. How's The
Stanford Daily doing today?
The Stanford Daily is doing well.
It's a bit cold, isn't it though?
JP: It's not as bad as we thought it
would be.
How is it in Florida?
TJ: Oh, right now it's humid.
So we're a college publication, and
I wanted to start off by asking
about a little story I heard. We
heard that you guys took some
scholarship money for college and
bought some band gear?
<BSS's Kevin Drew overpowering all
sound from the main stage: "San
Francisco how's it going?">
JP: That we did. Well we were like
all going to college, and I think we
were just half-assing it, to be honest
with you. I was playing in bands
and stuff at the time ... and so we
all kinda like just dropped our new
college classes and started touring,
and I'm really glad we
did.

Where were you guys going to
school?
JP: I was going to Florida Atlantic
University for education. High
school education.
TJ: He was going for something
that would support the arts.
<Broken Social Scene breaks out into
"Meet Me In The Basement.">
JP: Aside from playing music,
teaching is my other passion.
So, you guys aren't surfers? What's
the deal behind that?
JP: He is. <Points to TJ>

TJ: I was once, one day, in my age,
one year in my life. Maybe a couple
years. I'm too old for that now.
Every time I see a surfboard, I
crumble inside.
JP: We still make plans to go out
together, but we never do.
TJ: We run on the beach. It's been a
while, but
JP: Yeah, we do some jogging on
the beach.
Any surfing out here though?
TJ: I've done my own private tour
to Encinitas once. Encinitas to San
Diego, stopped by La Jolla. It was
beautiful.
What about Trestles?
TJ: I've never been to Trestles.
No.
JP: I never knew that.
Let's talk about the influence of
The Drums on your guys'
career start. They were your
friends and ...
JP: We owe a lot to The Drums.
They're nice guys. I knew Jacob
[Graham], he was living in Cocoa
Beach, I was living in Orlando, but
we both showed up to a lot of
shows in Orlando. And we were
friends, I guess. He got curious a
few years later and wanted to see
what we were up to, and he found
Surfer Blood on the Internet. And
he was like, "I want to introduce
you to my friend who runs a record
label, he's really awesome."
TJ: Absolutely, lovely people.
JP: Nicest dudes, really good peo
ple.

You guys mentioned the Internet.
That's been a big part in yours
guys' rise, right?
TJ: I think with every band the
Internet is pretty influential, espe
cially in this day and age.
<Broken Social Scene's strings and
horns kick in, making speech futile.>
So who are you guys excited to see
today?
JP: Tonight, Belle and Sebastian!
Belle and Sebastian!
TJ: We finally got to see
Superchunk for a little bit. That
was cool.
JP: [On Belle and Sebastian] They
were one of my favorite bands
growing up, and it's amazing that
they're playing here on the same
day as us.
TJ: They're a beautiful band. I want
to meet them as people too.
Have you met them yet?
TJ: No, but I'm planning to. Um, I
hope it happens.
Kind of like storming their tent, or
what?
TJ: I don't think I'm going to storm
or what I'm going to do. I'm going
to figure out some way to make it
happen.

TJ: I think with every band the
Internet is pretty influential, espe
cially in this day and age.
<Broken Social Scene's strings and
horns kick in, making speech futile.>
So who are you guys excited to see
today?
JP: Tonight, Belle and Sebastian!
Belle and Sebastian!
TJ: We finally got to see
Superchunk for a little bit. That
was cool.
JP: [On Belle and Sebastian] They
were one of my favorite bands
growing up, and it's amazing that
they're playing here on the same
day as us.
TJ: They're a beautiful band. I want
to meet them as people too.
Have you met them yet?
TJ: No, but I'm planning to. Um, I
hope it happens.
Kind of like storming their tent, or
what?
TJ: I don't think I'm going to storm
or what I'm going to do. I'm going
to figure out some way to make it
happen.
