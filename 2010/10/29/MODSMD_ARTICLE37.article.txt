The action-comedy "RED" is
fun. That's really all it is;
any success it has comes
not from its hole-riddled plot,
questionable plausibility and
drawn-out resolution, but the per
formance of its all-star veteran
cast.
"RED" refers not to the color
but to the way in which the CIA
lists its former operatives as
"Retired, Extremely Dangerous."
The film follows the adventures of
Frank Moses, played by the perpet
ually smirking Bruce Willis, a
retired CIA operative who is
forced out of retirement when a
task force is sent to kill him. He
then goes on a cross-country trip
to round up his former CIA gang:
he plucks the wise Morgan

Freeman from a retirement home
in New Orleans, picks up the psy-

chotic, former munitions
specialist John Malkovich
in a Florida swamp and
finds the retired "wet
work" expert FFelen
Mirren idly arranging
flowers. Included on
Willis' tour is a trip to

Kansas City to pick up the delight
ful Mary-Louise Parker ("Weeds"),
his initially reluctant love-interest.
The film drags on with a far
fetched and hackneyed plot involv
ing some sort of conspiracy cover
ing up the movie's fictitious vice
president's involvement in a
Guatemalan massacre and current
CIA agent Cooper's, played by Karl
Urban, pursuit of Moses and his
friends. Our only relief comes
from Parker's strong performance
and the addition of Brian Cox to
the geriatric gang as a vodka-swig

ging Cold War relic.
Overall, the quirky and talent
ed cast of "RED" holds the whole
film together and makes up, some
what, for director Robert
Schwentke's terrible choice of
screenplay. While most of the
action seems quite implausible, the
performances of Parker, Willis and
the rest of the veteran gang are
quite entertaining, making "RED"
at least one of the funnier light
weight comedies in the box office.
