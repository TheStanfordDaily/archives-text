# Generations of GREY'S
## 
### â€” liz STARK contact liz: estark12@stanford. edu 
It's that time of year again: the
foliage is turning, midterms have
laid claim to all of our souls and
Liz is contemplating whether or not
to give up on "Grey's Anatomy."
Shonda Rhimes's gang of neu
rotic beauties and I have been
through a lot together infidelity,
marriage, miscarriage, ferry crashes,
the afterlife, homosexuality, homo
phobia, PTSD, new hair colors and,
most recently, mass murder. It's not
that I feel particularly bonded to
these irrational characters, as I did in
the case of the similar bright star of
a soap, "The 0.C.;" rather, I keep
hoping the relationships and charac
ters will return to a state of balance.
For the months between the season
six finale and this fall's season seven
premiere, "Grey's" was like a pile of
phoenix's ashes. Its audacious two
hour finale episode had a widower
go after Dr. Shepherd, who pulled
the plug prematurely on the man's
wife, and the man kills more than a
dozen innocents along the way. The
energy of those losses has, in accor
dance with science, been preserved

to this season, but I'll reserve judg
ment on the effective conversion of
that energy until the Christmas hia
tus.
To gain some perspective on
how far Grey's has come, or some
would say fallen, and to do some
procrastination similarly befitting of
midterms, I spent this weekend re
watching the first season of the
show, which has been uploaded to
Hulu. There was much discussion
last year about the "perfect" pilot or
the "perfect" first season, and I, wad
ing my way through the first eight
episodes at Seattle Grace, am com
fortable declaring it a near flawless
premiere. All of the characters are
empathetic even Katherine
Heigl's Izzie and the harmony of
medical cases, personal drama and
thematic narration makes for very
tight and affecting hours of televi
sion.
The first season arguably bene
fits from the novelty of the romantic
relationships, the excitement of Mer
and Der or Burke and Yang. I, how
ever, am convinced that the treat-

ment of sex in this season is more
tongue-and-cheek and less exploita
tive than later plots (the season
finale exhibits self-awareness with
STDs taking center stage). Heck, I
even miss crotchety Ellis Grey and
the generational anchoring she pro
vides for the young people and med
icine. The future, diegetic and non
diegetic, is promising in those first
few tales from intern life, even if the
season itself was stunted by the writ
ers' strike (how long ago does that
feel?).
So where are we in season
seven? The short answer is caught up
in adult issues, but, unfortunately,
the show doesn't treat it as such. The
first few episodes featured a psychia
trist evaluating the attendings, resi
dents and interns impacted by the
mass murder, an interaction that
provided structure and a great
opportunity for probing the devel
opment of the characters. Now that
that's over, all of our favorite charac
ters have been left in different states
of recovery.
That choice, seemingly neces-

sary for variation, is in fact hinder
ing the forward progression of the
show. The most obvious example of
this is Cristina, who spent the last
episode repeating "I don't know"
when asked to participate. One
critic I read remarked that "Grey's"
has become notorious for pushing
our loyalty to the brink before
rewarding us with resolution, an
observation that proved true at the
episode's conclusion. Though I can
acknowledge the astuteness of that
analysis, I didn't feel rewarded.
Neuroses such as Cristina's have
taken on a macabre, heavy air, and I
worry that, so long as the narrative
focuses on how broken everyone is,
we will never be able to have a pure
ly silly episode a la seasons one and
two. Rather than pigeonholing char
acters like Torres to sating that audi
ence desire, Rhimes should push all
of the actors to prove their worth, to
prove their ability to improve on the
sacrificed roles of Izzie, George,
Burke, etc.
To say goodbye to a show that
still airs every week is a dramatic
choice. I myself have recently experi
enced this trauma with "Glee." I
think I'll stick around for more
"Grey's Anatomy" this season, but,
depending on the gimmick-to-nar

rative development ratio, I may have
trouble justifying it next season. The
remote is to television programming
as the ballot is to politics, so get out
and rock both equally passionately.
