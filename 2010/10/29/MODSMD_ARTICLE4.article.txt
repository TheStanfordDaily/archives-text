NO. 13 STANFORD (6-1,3-1 PAC-10] AT WASHINGTON (3-4,2-2 PAC-10]

KABIR SAWHNEY
STANFORD 41, WASHINGTON 35: On paper, Stanford and Washington
have a lot of similarities: star quarterbacks, last-second wins over USC and de
fenses with holes so huge you could drive a truck through them. Nevertheless, the
Cardinal is 6-1 while the Huskies are 3-4 for a reason even when it's not at its
best, this Stanford team finds ways to win, while the Huskies have been wildly in
consistent. If it follows the same pattern it has all season, Washington will return to
the form that took it to victories against USC and Oregon State, but this time it
won't be enough to overcome another big day from Stepfan Taylor and the Stan
ford offense.
ZACH ZIMMERMAN
STANFORD 38, WASHINGTON 23: Two weeks ago, I would have guar
anteed a Stanford victory by at least two touchdowns. However, after witnessing
an extremely lackluster defensive effort against Washington State, I'm not so sure.
Washington QB Jake Locker, while having not quite lived up to his preseason
hype, is still a talent and a half, and while his supporting cast may not be com
prised of superstars, it should still find away to shine against a Stanford second
ary that has made relatively average guys look like Jerry Rice. That said, I can't
possibly believe Harbaugh will allow his guys to play with the same lack of intensity
that was displayed against Wazzu.
JACOB JAFFE
STANFORD 37, WASHINGTON 24: Washington's Jake Locker has a few
big pass plays to Jermaine Kearse to expose Stanford's weak spots in the second
ary, and Locker has a few big gains on the ground. The Cardinal defense capital
izes on a few mistakes by Locker, though, and that is enough for a comfortable
Stanford victory. Andrew Luck proves that he is unquestionably a better quarter
back and prospect than Locker, taking the crowd out of the game early and picking
apart a porous Husky defense. Stepfan Taylor continues his success as the Cardi
nal offensive line wears down the Washington defensive front.
