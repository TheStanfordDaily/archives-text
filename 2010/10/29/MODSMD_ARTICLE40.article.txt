The popular
Caribbean/Jamaican cuisine
jerked meat may trace its
name to the Spanish word "char
qui," meaning dried meat.
Alternatively, the term may also be
derived from how the dish was
cooked, specifically by "jerking" or
poking the meat to create holes that
could be filled with spices. The lat
ter root is particularly pertinent to
Coconuts Caribbean Restaurant &
Bar's menu it's filled with holes.

The resort atmosphere perme
ates the restaurant. Coconuts is cov
ered in bright colors and is full of
lively talk. The decor is a bit cheeky
and would make you feel complete
ly at home ordering a colorful
mixed drink.
Coconuts has a family-style
approach to food, where dishes are
meant to be ordered by the group
and shared. Unfortunately,
Coconuts tends to use this concept
as an excuse to downplay the

importance of plating and the dish
es simply look less appetizing
because of that mentality. A prime
example of the consequences is the
"Tun Cornmeal Cakes," which look
too homemade and do not have
nearly enough flavor to compen
sate. The underperforming taste
coupled with the aesthetics of the
dish make it hard to imagine why
anyone would make this a repeat
order.
Even those dishes where some

decent plating is attempted under
perform for other reasons. The
"Shrimp Creole" is surprisingly
bland, despite its ties to an other
wise powerful tradition. The plan
tain tostones that surround the dish
are prepared in away that saps the
fruit of its special qualities, and the
shrimp do not absorb much of the
character of the sauce. Similarly, the
"Spinach Ackee Rolls" are lacking in
taste but are then thrown complete
ly off balance by the sweet coconut
dipping sauce that accompanies
them. The sweetness overwhelms,
and this appetizer almost becomes a
premature and confused dessert.
The heart of Caribbean restau
rants, though, is the exotic meat
selection, not limited to oxtail and
goat. However, there is a reason that
these cuts of meat are not more
common, as special care needs to be
taken to make them worthwhile.
The "Six Hour Braised Oxtail" at
Coconuts is extremely tender and
really does fall off the bone. The
main issue is that there is not much
meat to fall off the series of bones;
the plate ends up as mostly an
extremely rich broth without

enough taste.
Coconuts does have some
redeeming qualities. The jerk wings
in particular are absolutely deli
cious; they are teeming with flavor
from the jerk sauce. It is certainly
understandable why this is labeled
"A Must Have" on the menu,
although it is possible the epithet
also suggests some lack of confi
dence in the other appetizers (and
understandably so).
There are some situations in
which Coconuts might be worth
while. The restaurant would serve
well as part of a "staycation" if you
can't make it to somewhere warmer
in the winter. With no vegetarians
in your group, you might be able to

Palo Alto's Coconuts Caribbean Restaurant & Bar serves family-style. Try the "Jerk Chicken," a restaurant specialty of slow-cooked chicken smoked over allspice, served with plantains and rice and beans.
