The words "Halloween week
end" are more than enough
to send shivers down Roxy's
spine for spooky things, yes, but
mostly for all the exposed skin and
lowered inhibitions that accompany
All Hallow's Eve. It's a time when
identities melt away, and Roxy can
add Fred Flintsone (made her bed
rock) and the Jolly Green Giant
(certainly earned his "giant" title)
to her hookup list.
For one night only, you are
what you pretend to be. It's a veri
table slideshow of possibilities, and
Roxy need not look far to know
how the night will play out in bed.
The costume says it all.
Time for the Roxy Horror
Picture Show.
Bumblebee
Whether a queen bee or a male
worker bee, anyone sporting yellow
and black stripes has to be down
for an orgy. After all, what else
describes hive mentality except a
huge, swarming mass of like-mind
ed folk dead set on procreation?
Roxy's ready to get stung.
Spiderman
Spidey senses, climbing skills,
incredible speed who cares? It's
all about the ability to kiss upside
down with a highly maneuverable
tongue. Roxy's lips pucker up a lit
tle in Pavlovian reaction to a red
and-blue spandex suit.
Body paint
These people are just asking to
be rubbed up against. Roxy, always
looking to please, says: let yellow
and red become orange, and taste
(and feel) the rainbow.

Caveman
Expect grunting, not dirty talk.
But Roxy thinks the club and pure
Neanderthal spirit could make for
an interesting prehistoric romp.
Couples' costumes
It still baffles Roxy that people
would declare to the world on
Halloween that they already know
who they're going home with. For
the most part, matching couples are
already a lost cause, as Roxy doesn't
condone home-wrecking. But just
in case there's one that still tempts
your fancy, Roxy reminds you: just
because there's a goalie, it doesn't
mean you can't score.
Food items
Just asking to be licked.
Anything undead
Two words: rigor mortis.
Roxy's down for any experience
that involves the word "stiffening."
Firefighter
Roxy thinks it's likely he's got a
big hose. She's also hoping that
he'll have a quick response to the
fire brewing in her panties.
Someone, quick, ring her alarm.
Halloween is a beautiful buffet
of potential, where people show
their true colors through the colors
painted on their face. Leave your
self and your real name behind,
and when you wake up in Roxy's
bed, be sure not to forget your wig
on your way out. Happy
Halloween!
