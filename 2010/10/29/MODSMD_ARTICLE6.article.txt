## WORLD & NATION NFL alum brings game to political field 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY MANAGING EDITOR 
Damon Dunn '9B will try to start
his political career with a victory on
Tuesday when the former Cardinal
wide receiver and public policy
major will face incumbent Debra
Bowen in California's secretary of
state election. Dunn, the Republi
can nominee, is running for office
for the first time after a private ca
reer in football and real estate.

Dunn's campaign for the down
ticket seat has received countrywide
attention he was the subject of a
nationally broadcast Fox News pro
file and he's seen, according to
Hoover Institution research fellow
Bill Whalen, as a "breath of fresh
air" for California Republicans, if
not the party in general.
Former Speaker of the House of
Representatives Tip O'Neill once
described Republicans as "idiot
sons of millionaires," Whalen said.
"That's not Damon Dunn. He's not
an idiot. He's not the son of a mil
lionaire, He's a self-made man. Can
didates like that have real value in
California."

Dunn grew up in a trailer in
Texas, on welfare, with a single,
teenage mother; his father died
when he was a toddler. Before he
was 16, he had witnessed the mur
ders of three friends. Growing up in
an area where Dunn said "people
had low expectations and they met
them," he earned a scholarship to
Stanford, played for four seasons in
the NFL, and then started his own
real estate company.
"I've lived this huge swath of the
American experience, and it creates
a unique value proposition when
approaching public policy," Dunn
said. "Most people in elected office
read about this stuff. I've actually
lived it. I've gone to the best schools
in the country, and I've gone to the
worst schools."
Dunn's foray into politics does
not come from a strong partisan
background he's an admitted fan
of Bill Clinton, for example but
rather, from what he saw as a moral
obligation to give back to his com
munity.
"There are no U-Hauls behind a

hearse," he said. "You can't take
anything with you."
Beyond that, he identified what
he saw as areas of improvement in
the secretary's office. The main re
sponsibilities of the job include
overseeing elections and the state's
archives and notaries, but Dunn felt
there was room for expansion and
modification.

"I look at secretary of state office
the same way I look at my business,"
he said. "How are we going to find a
creative niche in the marketplace?"
One of his examples? Manage
ment of business filings.
"The secretary of state is the only
person who gets a notice when a
business shuts down and leaves the
state," he said. "Right now, we don't
do anything with this. Using a
thought process I learned at Stan
ford, I've said there's tremendous
value here. What if we did exit inter
views? What if we found out which
tax policy, which regulatory policy
pushed them out? Then go back to
the state legislature and say, 'We're
losing X jobs, and we're in place to
lose X more.' Then we're putting
strategic pressure on the legislature
to change."
But getting into office and being
able to implement plans such as
these will be a tough task. Whalen, a
California politics and elections ex
pert, was not optimistic about
Dunn's chances at election.
"I think he's done his level best
to spread the message," Whalen
said. "Give him a lot of credit. He's
gone into pockets of California
where Republicans don't campaign.
Bowen has the upper hand because
she's an incumbent, but also be
cause she's a Democrat. The party
has a 13-point registration advan
tage in the state."
Specifically, because so many
people will vote the party line,
Whalen felt that Dunn would have
to ride GOP gubernatorial nominee
Meg Whitman's coattails.
"[The] public is focused on the
top of the ticket," Whalen said.
"What that means for Damon is that
he's at the mercy of what happens at
the top of the ticket. Specifically,
Meg Whitman."
Whalen estimated that Whitman

would have to win by at least five
points for Dunn to have a reason
able chance at victory.The latest Re
alClearPolitics composite poll had
Whitman down an average of 8.8
points to Democratic opponent
Jerry Brown.

Still, it is not a hopeless endeav
or: Whalen estimates that Whitman
has spent between $lO million and
$3O million on her election day get
out-the-vote ground game a
massive financial effort that only
benefits Dunn. And for his part,

Dunn feels as if his message is being
well received across the board, even
within traditionally Democratic
strongholds, such as the NAACR
"I feel good, I feel optimistic," he
said. "We're going to need a strong
turnout, but I think we have the bet

ter candidate. Everywhere I've gone
standing ovations."
The polls open at 7 a.m. on Tues
day, Nov. 2.

I feel good, I feel optimistic. We're going to need a strong
turnout, but I think we have the better candidate.
