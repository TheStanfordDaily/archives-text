## Stanford giving drops in 2009, still tops list of universities 
### SAMANTHA McGIRR DESK EDITOR 
Stanford suffered an 18.5 percent
drop in private fundraising totals in fiscal
year 2009 but still raised more money
than any other college or university, ac
cording to a survey released on Oct. 17 by
The Chronicle of Philanthropy.
The Philanthropy 400 survey, which
ranks organizations that raise the most
money from private sources, reported
that Stanford collected $640 million for
the fiscal year that ended on Aug. 31,
2009. At No. 14, Stanford is the highest
ranked university on the list, with Flar
vard coming in at No. 16 with a total of
$6Ol million.
Private giving to top charities giv
ing from individuals, foundations and
businesses dropped 11 percent in
2009, according to the report. Giving to
colleges dropped 11.9 percent, according
to the results of the Voluntary Support of
Education Survey released earlier this
year.
Rebecca Smith Vogel, senior director
of development and speaking on behalf
of the Office of Development, cited the
current economic recession as one factor
in the drop, but pointed to another factor:
the five-year life cycle of The Stanford
Challenge. The university-wide cam
paign aims at raising funds for initiatives
in such areas as human health, the envi
ronment and undergraduate and gradu
ate education.
"FY 09 fell in the middle of our five
year campaign," Vogel wrote in an e-mail
to The Daily. "There is often a reduction
in the size and number of gifts committed
at this stage of a typical campaign. When
this happens, it usually is because many
donors who are closest to the institution
have made early commitments in the
campaign cycle while others are still
being engaged in the major themes and
needs of the campaign."
According to the Office of Develop
ment, gifts made in 2009 included $247.1
million for research purposes, $55.7 mil
lion for student aid, $29.4 million for pro

fessorships and other faculty support and
$85.3 million for on-campus construc
tion.

In 2009, donors gave a total of $18.4
million to The Stanford Fund (TSF), a
source of discretionary funding that the
president allocates where resources are
most needed. Last year, 82 percent went
to need-based financial aid, 11 percent to
academic programs and 7 percent to stu
dent life. Vogel said TSF funds have en
abled the University to continue offering
extensive financial aid packages during
the recession.

"For the past two years, a significant
portion of The Stanford Fund has been
allocated for need-based undergraduate
financial aid," she said. "This has been ab
solutely critical to Stanford's ability to

meet the increased demand for financial
aid at the same time that the university's
endowment saw a steep decrease."
Vogel remains optimistic about the fu
ture of Stanford fundraising, citing an in
crease in giving from non-alumni parent
donors and increased involvement from
young alumni as two promising trends.
The percentage drop in giving in 2009, she
said, was more likely a consequence of
widespread financial woes than an indica
tor of waning support for the University.
"It's hard to say with any certainty, but
it's probably safe to view the level of the
drop we saw in 2009 as an anomaly that
was in large part the result of the extraor
dinary economic circumstances," she said.
