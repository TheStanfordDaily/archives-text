## Website gets voters caught up on election info Stanford center joins non-profit to raise voter turnout, knowledge 
### CASSANDRA FELICIANO DESK EDITOR 
Unsure about how to vote or what measures
will appear on those ballots on Nov. 2? Califor
nia Choices, a nonpartisan election information
website with Stanford ties, hopes that voters
feeling that way will visit the site before heading
to the polls on Tuesday.
The site, which officially launched in Septem
ber, provides a range of information on this elec
tion's nine ballot measures from the political
stipulations of a given measure to what other
Californians think of it.
The project is a collaborative effort among
San Francisco-based research nonprofit Next
10, Stanford's Bill Lane Center for the Ameri
can West, UC-Berkeley and Sacramento State.
It originated from Next 10 founder Noel Perry's
talk at a conference on constitutional reform
hosted by the Bill Lane Center last year.
"We thought it might be helpful to have a
website where we could bring all these ideas and
proposals together from a non-partisan perspec
tive," Perry said, adding, "California Choices fits
with the work Next 10 is doing trying to make
difficult information more accessible to voters."
Lane Center co-director David Kennedy '63
added that Tuesday's election has even more sig
nificant implications for California voters than

previous elections because of its possible
effects on the state's economic growth,
taxes and even the decisions that
voters will make in later elections.
The ideas behind California
Choices go back to 2004, when
Perry founded Next 10. Even
then, he held deep concerns
about the future of Califor
nia state politics and the
large number of voters
who still remain undecided
just days before an election.
He wanted voters to better
understand the stipulations
of the choices they make in
the polling booth and the
range of options available to

them.
To that end, the information on the website,
researched by scholars from Next 10's three col
legiate partners, features the policy positions of
50 influential organizations, newspapers and po
litical parties as well as steps that individual vot
ers can take to inspire political reform on their
own.
While most of the information comes from
Berkeley researchers, all the faculty members at
the Lane Center and two Stanford graduate stu
dents also contribute. In fact, Kennedy said the
center are working to convince Stanford to hire
more researchers. But he declined to give fur
ther details on the University's position.
"[But] we're not advocating," said Kennedy.
"A lot of thought goes into that, and one way we
approach it is we simply try to record who's
lined up on which side of the issue."
In fact, the website allows voters to share
their views on political reform via uploaded
You Tube videos as well as Facebook and Twitter
a feature that will also help with spreading
awareness about the website, Kennedy said.
Despite Kennedy's claims that publicity re
mains "the biggest challenge" for the site, their
statistics suggest otherwise. The website gar
nered 70,000 visits within the first few days of its
official launch, he said, and it currently averages
up to 3,000 daily, which Perry expects to increase
between now and Tuesday.

In his eagerness to educate as many
Californians as possible, Perry, a for
mer venture capitalist who also acts as
the major funder for Next 10, will be
shouldering the financial responsibili
ties for running California Choices,

most of which is devoted to hiring a
website developer. He declined to give
more specifics about operation costs,
other than "thousands of dollars."
"I hope that voters are able to
better understand the pros and cons
of different propositions by having
read the information [on the web
site]," he said.
