## EoplO l)nUoU)mi Costumes for 2010 
### ADEEB SAHAR

The man your man can smell like is now the man your man can look like. The setup is simple: just wrap a white towel
around your waist and shamelessly flaunt your body. If you don't have much to offer in the appearance department, don't
fear. More crucial to the success of this costume are the suave mannerisms: an eyebrow cocked up the whole night, exten
sive use of the word "ladies" in a low baritone and the ability to change scenery in seconds. This shirtless costume is sure to
win the ladies. Just ask Katy Ferron 'l4, who spoke on behalf of the female population. "Every girl wants a man like the
Old Spice man," she said. j

9. Cleanup Cretoman:
In arguably the biggest news story of the year, the Deepwater Horizon disaster spilled more than 100 million gal
lons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico, igniting enormous public outrage over the damage to the Gulf Coast, tourism in
dustry and wildlife. Take the heat on your Halloween evening as a BP cleanup crewman. Splatter oil on a jumpsuit
and add a creative touch by wearing signs around your neck along the lines of, "We're doing the best we can," or
"Everyone makes mistakes." To avoid the irony, take special care not to repeatedly spill beer this Halloween.
8. Campaign iUPPertteement for proposition 19:

The saving grace of stoners and free-rights proponents everywhere, Proposition 19 legalizes more marijua
na-related activities and allows local governments to regulate these activities. Wear your opinion on this con
troversial proposition on Halloween night, only three days before official voting polls open. Take advantage of
the ability to be creative in expressing your opinion. Assume a stoner look with a sign around your neck urg
ing, "Yes on 19." Or, mimic a drug-cartel leader or sketchy drug dealer bearing a sign that begs, "No on 19."
7. fan ssretoer:

Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer propelled herself into the national spotlight with her stamp of approval on the
highly controversial Support Our Law Enforcement and Safe Neighborhoods Act. The law makes it a mis
demeanor for an alien to be in Arizona without carrying the required documents, which has critics of the
legislation outraged over its implications of racial profiling. Her subsequent gaffes during the Arizona gu
bernatorial debate and her unsubstantiated claims that Arizona's "law enforcement agencies have found
bodies in the desert either buried or just lying out there that have been beheaded" have led to her infa
mous public exposure. Attain the Brewer look by dressing in business attire and orange-ing your skin
into the subtle sheen of a fake tan.

6. Xabp <®aga:
Taking over the pop genre with a wave of chart-topping singles and headline-grabbing antics,
Lady Gaga has rocked the 2010 music industry with her inimitable personality, spirit and fashion. No
one expects (and everyone hopes) you choose a Gaga attire aside from her dress made entirely out
of meat, and there are plenty of other options. Be creative; consider the use of fishnets, boots, geo
metric designs, wacky hairdos, aluminum, animal fur, animal skin, animal feces (wait, what?), capes
and wild makeup. As Megan McKoy 'l4 points out, "The beautiful part about this costume is that
you can basically dress up as anything strange and flamboyant and get away with calling yourself
Lady Gaga."

Chad Ochocinco, wide reciever for the Cincinnati Bengals and host of the VHI dating show
"The Ultimate Catch," seems to stir up controversy every time he opens his mouth or Twitter
account. His Twitter page houses his many random thoughts, insults and emboldened accu
sations as they pop into his head. Think you're addicted to Twitter? The professional foot
ball player can't seem to get enough social media this year, absorbing a fine of $25,000 for
tweeting within 90 minutes of his NFL game.Throw on Ochocinco's jersey and tape strips i
of paper quoting his unique Twitter observations all over the uniform. Your creativity is
sure to score points in a costume competition. ' 1

4. tPje Cast of "Jersey
Let's face it: you won't be the only Snooki at your Halloween party this year. The
laughable caricatures of MTV's reality show "Jersey Shore" are simply too outra
geous with their petty arguments and larger-than-life personalities to be overlooked

as this year's go-to costume. Guys: Throw on an Ed Hardy muscle tee, refuse to re
move your aviator glasses and apply gratuitous amounts of hair gel. Ladies: Show
off a fake spray tan in your choice of a distastefully low-cut, revealing dress. Be-

sides, even if you don't enjoy watching "Jersey Shore," you can still rep it on Hal
low's Eve. Shamika Goddard 'll, who has never seen an episode of the reality
show admits, "I wouldn't be caught dead watching "Jersey Shore," but I would
n't mind bumpin' it up [like Snooki's bob]!"

3. Sntotne Sotison:
Dodson became one of the biggest Internet sensations of 2010, earning
his claim to fame from his use of street vernacular and ardent style of deliv
ery during a local tele vision interview after an alleged attempted rape of his
sister. In true entrepreneurial spirit, Dodson responded to his newfound
popularity by subsequently retailing T-shirts and apparel and releasing his
(surprisingly catchy) single "Bed Intruder Song" in order to raise money
to move his family out of the projects. Dodson even set up a foundation
for juvenile diabetes, a disease that has afflicted both his sister and his
mother. If you don't want to make donations, you can still pay tribute to
one of the most well-known Internet-figures of 2010 by dressing up as him
in his trademark black wife beater with a red-bandana combination.

2. Ctgcr ©llootis, :Posit-i£>canDal:
In 2010, it became known that Tiger Woods was as good a player off
the golf course as he was on it. Evidence surfaced of the golf player's nu
merous affairs; his subsequent divorce from wife Elin Nordegren left
Elin with $750 million dollars and Tiger with an ignominious public
image. Recall this messy 2010 affair by dressing yourself as the new pub
lic image of Tiger Woods, leaving his traditional Nike golf attire wrin
kled and unbuttoned with lipstick smears. Robbie Zimbroff 'l2 agreed
that "this costume should just be used as an excuse to get with as many
women as possible."

I. Wtlloto Hmtttf):
Daughter of Will Smith and Jada Pinkett, Willow Smith burst
onto the musical scene with the release of her hit single "Whip My
Hair" under Jay-Z's Roc Nation label. Comparisons to Rihanna en
sued, and it was only a matter of weeks before the catchy tune of
"Whip My Hair" rang throughout Stanford's dorm halls. Show
some love for the 9-year-old's early musical success by emulating
her out-there sense of fashion as your Halloween costume. Careful,
though. Willow has quickly gained tremendous popularity, so this
costume idea may err on the side of unoriginality. Kevin Roberts 'l3
warns, "As far as whipping your hair, I'm all up for that as long as you
don't break your neck. But I personally wouldn't want to walk
around Stanford looking like a hundred other people who dressed
as Willow Smith."

metric designs, wacky hairdos, aluminum, animal fur, animal skin, animal feces (wait, what?), capes
and wild makeup. As Megan McKoy 'l4 points out, "The beautiful part about this costume is that
you can basically dress up as anything strange and flamboyant and get away with calling yourself
Lady Gaga."

Chad Ochocinco, wide reciever for the Cincinnati Bengals and host of the VHI dating show
"The Ultimate Catch," seems to stir up controversy every time he opens his mouth or Twitter
account. His Twitter page houses his many random thoughts, insults and emboldened accu
sations as they pop into his head. Think you're addicted to Twitter? The professional foot
ball player can't seem to get enough social media this year, absorbing a fine of $25,000 for
tweeting within 90 minutes of his NFL game.Throw on Ochocinco's jersey and tape strips i
of paper quoting his unique Twitter observations all over the uniform. Your creativity is
sure to score points in a costume competition. ' 1

Let's face it: you won't be the only Snooki at your Halloween party this year. The
laughable caricatures of MTV's reality show "Jersey Shore" are simply too outra
geous with their petty arguments and larger-than-life personalities to be overlooked

as this year's go-to costume. Guys: Throw on an Ed Hardy muscle tee, refuse to re
move your aviator glasses and apply gratuitous amounts of hair gel. Ladies: Show
off a fake spray tan in your choice of a distastefully low-cut, revealing dress. Be-

sides, even if you don't enjoy watching "Jersey Shore," you can still rep it on Hal
low's Eve. Shamika Goddard 'll, who has never seen an episode of the reality
show admits, "I wouldn't be caught dead watching "Jersey Shore," but I would
n't mind bumpin' it up [like Snooki's bob]!"

Dodson became one of the biggest Internet sensations of 2010, earning
his claim to fame from his use of street vernacular and ardent style of deliv
ery during a local tele vision interview after an alleged attempted rape of his
sister. In true entrepreneurial spirit, Dodson responded to his newfound
popularity by subsequently retailing T-shirts and apparel and releasing his
(surprisingly catchy) single "Bed Intruder Song" in order to raise money
to move his family out of the projects. Dodson even set up a foundation
for juvenile diabetes, a disease that has afflicted both his sister and his
mother. If you don't want to make donations, you can still pay tribute to
one of the most well-known Internet-figures of 2010 by dressing up as him
in his trademark black wife beater with a red-bandana combination.

In 2010, it became known that Tiger Woods was as good a player off
the golf course as he was on it. Evidence surfaced of the golf player's nu
merous affairs; his subsequent divorce from wife Elin Nordegren left
Elin with $750 million dollars and Tiger with an ignominious public
image. Recall this messy 2010 affair by dressing yourself as the new pub
lic image of Tiger Woods, leaving his traditional Nike golf attire wrin
kled and unbuttoned with lipstick smears. Robbie Zimbroff 'l2 agreed
that "this costume should just be used as an excuse to get with as many
women as possible."

Daughter of Will Smith and Jada Pinkett, Willow Smith burst
onto the musical scene with the release of her hit single "Whip My
Hair" under Jay-Z's Roc Nation label. Comparisons to Rihanna en
sued, and it was only a matter of weeks before the catchy tune of
"Whip My Hair" rang throughout Stanford's dorm halls. Show
some love for the 9-year-old's early musical success by emulating
her out-there sense of fashion as your Halloween costume. Careful,
though. Willow has quickly gained tremendous popularity, so this
costume idea may err on the side of unoriginality. Kevin Roberts 'l3
warns, "As far as whipping your hair, I'm all up for that as long as you
don't break your neck. But I personally wouldn't want to walk
around Stanford looking like a hundred other people who dressed
as Willow Smith."

The man your man can smell like is now the man your man can look like. The setup is simple: just wrap a white towel
around your waist and shamelessly flaunt your body. If you don't have much to offer in the appearance department, don't
fear. More crucial to the success of this costume are the suave mannerisms: an eyebrow cocked up the whole night, exten
sive use of the word "ladies" in a low baritone and the ability to change scenery in seconds. This shirtless costume is sure to
win the ladies. Just ask Katy Ferron 'l4, who spoke on behalf of the female population. "Every girl wants a man like the
Old Spice man," she said. j

9. Cleanup Cretoman:
In arguably the biggest news story of the year, the Deepwater Horizon disaster spilled more than 100 million gal
lons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico, igniting enormous public outrage over the damage to the Gulf Coast, tourism in
dustry and wildlife. Take the heat on your Halloween evening as a BP cleanup crewman. Splatter oil on a jumpsuit
and add a creative touch by wearing signs around your neck along the lines of, "We're doing the best we can," or
"Everyone makes mistakes." To avoid the irony, take special care not to repeatedly spill beer this Halloween.
8. Campaign iUPPertteement for proposition 19:

The saving grace of stoners and free-rights proponents everywhere, Proposition 19 legalizes more marijua
na-related activities and allows local governments to regulate these activities. Wear your opinion on this con
troversial proposition on Halloween night, only three days before official voting polls open. Take advantage of
the ability to be creative in expressing your opinion. Assume a stoner look with a sign around your neck urg
ing, "Yes on 19." Or, mimic a drug-cartel leader or sketchy drug dealer bearing a sign that begs, "No on 19."
7. fan ssretoer:

Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer propelled herself into the national spotlight with her stamp of approval on the
highly controversial Support Our Law Enforcement and Safe Neighborhoods Act. The law makes it a mis
demeanor for an alien to be in Arizona without carrying the required documents, which has critics of the
legislation outraged over its implications of racial profiling. Her subsequent gaffes during the Arizona gu
bernatorial debate and her unsubstantiated claims that Arizona's "law enforcement agencies have found
bodies in the desert either buried or just lying out there that have been beheaded" have led to her infa
mous public exposure. Attain the Brewer look by dressing in business attire and orange-ing your skin
into the subtle sheen of a fake tan.

6. Xabp <®aga:
Taking over the pop genre with a wave of chart-topping singles and headline-grabbing antics,
Lady Gaga has rocked the 2010 music industry with her inimitable personality, spirit and fashion. No
one expects (and everyone hopes) you choose a Gaga attire aside from her dress made entirely out
of meat, and there are plenty of other options. Be creative; consider the use of fishnets, boots, geo
metric designs, wacky hairdos, aluminum, animal fur, animal skin, animal feces (wait, what?), capes
and wild makeup. As Megan McKoy 'l4 points out, "The beautiful part about this costume is that
