# CARDINAL SINS
## A 						Bad First Impression 
### David Spencer Nelson 
Ed. note: Today we introduce our freshman
columnist, David Spencer Nelson.

Introduction to the Humanities (IHUM)
is a necessary program. Students, many
of whom come from math- and science
based backgrounds, should be introduced to
higher humanities classes in their first year
at Stanford. Not only is the program impor
tant academically; it is also an integral part
of gaining continuity in the freshman class,
both socially and intellectually.
Moreover, IHUM offers brilliant lec
tures. Some of the University's best profes
sors teach its courses and offer very com
pelling talks.
But the program is hugely flawed. IHUM
introduces freshman to a picture of the hu
manities not at all like the interactive semi
nars that the English and Philosophy De
partments thrive on. It's too bad, because its
only takes a few run-ins with the program's
arbitrary grading scales and lecture-like dis
cussion sections before many students give
up on IHUM, and, sometimes, the humani
ties in general.
The first thing most students notice when
they sit down in section is that this class is
not just about educating; it's about handing
you a slice of humble pie. Freshmen are told
not to expect good grades, but aren't told
how to get better ones. The seemingly arbi
trary nature of IHUM's grading scales is
alienating to students with a mild interest in
the humanities.
It often feels like the program is designed
more to help you realize your limitations
than to expand them. Students struggling to
break the B-HUM curse are likely to be
come apathetic and stop trying to do much
more than pass.
IHUM is problematic in another way: it
doesn't reflect what the humanities value.
The humanities' greatest strength is open
ness, the possible validity of every interpre
tation. Yet the program is about reception,
not creation.
From my own experience and what I can
gather from my classmates' testimony,
IHUM is centered more around receiving
knowledge from professors than discussing
and independently analyzing texts. From
the instant students walk into section, the
assumption is that students need to be
taught the right answer. Students are treat
ed as empty vessels, like they are inherently
lacking. Students are not active in their own
education. Elsewhere in the humanities, val
orizing one perspective over another is a
sin.The humanities are about giving voice to
ideas and dissecting them, not receiving the
gospel from pontificators. Yet in section, the

perspective of students is always secondary.
What's wrong with IHUM? The answer
is very simple: students don't like illogical
systems without explanations; students
don't like classes that don't offer a path to
success; students don't like classes that don't
involve them or recognize their contribu
tions.
No one wants to be an observer to his or
her own education. Especially in the hu
manities, where there is often no absolute
right answer, students need to be given the
freedom to make interpretations and opin
ions, to engage with the course material on
their own terms. The program's current for
mat makes that difficult, because sections
are more often than not devoted to explain
ing lectures rather than independent discus
sion.
Stanford should introduce students to
the humanities in away that reflects what
the humanities truly are. Like the majority
of English and philosophy classes at Stan
ford, IHUM should be conducted in a semi
nar format. Students should be in small, en
gaged groups. They should be encouraged to
try to gain deeper understandings through
discussion with each other, moderated by a
faculty member.
The program, which at the moment is not
conducted like an introductory class, needs
to become one. Students don't enjoy the for
giveness given in most introductory classes,
especially when it comes to grades. Students
are expected to perform to a standard that
isn't made clear, and they're given precious
little guidance on how to better their efforts.
That's central to the problem: IHUM should
be about helping, not humbling.
What IHUM fails most aren't the stu
dents, but the departments in the humani
ties. It manages to dissuade students in great
numbers from taking more classes in the hu
manities for fear of having another hellish
experience. The departments should take
charge of IHUM and try to improve the over
all experience.
