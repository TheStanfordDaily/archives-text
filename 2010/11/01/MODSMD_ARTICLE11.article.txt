## Vote Jerry Brown for governor of California 
### 
Facing a 12.4 percent unemployment rate and a budget deficit of
$19.1 billion, California's next governor will have to make impor
tant decisions from day one. After examining both candidates'
plans for dealing with the budget, the environment and the economy,
the editorial board recommends that voters choose Democratic nomi
nee Jerry Brown for governor of California.
Though less than comprehensive, Brown's budget plan offers prag
matic ideas for addressing the Golden State's fiscal woes. He promises
to adopt a "pay-as-you-go" funding approach, vetoing any new spend
ing bills that are not financed by additional revenues, and proposing a
constitutional amendment to write the policy into law. He has champi
oned a "rainy day fund," which would collect money during times of
budget surplus to soften the blow of economic downturns. He has also
published specific plans to reduce the structural costs of the state prison
system and Medi-Cal. Brown's proposals will not close the deficit any
time soon, but they do offer a long-term solution to a long-term prob
lem. Any who doubt Brown's commitment to fiscal responsibility need
only to look at his record as governor during the 19705, when he over
saw the largest budget surplus in state history.
Meg Whitman, the Republican nominee, plans to cut $l5 billion
from the California budget by firing 40,000 public employees and cut
ting social programs all while eliminating the capital gains tax to
line the pockets of wealthy investors. The loss of so many jobs in such
a dismal economy would be a dangerous experiment in how to exac
erbate a recession. Furthermore, $9 billion of the $l5 billion Whitman
has pledged to cut has yet to be identified, meaning that thousands
more public employees would have to be fired under Whitman's plan.
Kenneth Arrow, a Nobel Prize winner and Stanford professor of
economics, joined an impressive list of California scholars in signing a
letter concluding that Whitman's budget and economy proposal,
"Meg 2010," "is based on faulty economic theories and on studies that
are fundamentally unsound." Fortunately, the state legislature would
never accede to Whitman's draconian policies. Whitman would have
to devise a new budget plan upon taking office.
We are pleased that both Brown and Whitman support significant in
vestment in renewable energy and have come out in favor of AB 32, Cal
ifornia's emissions-pricing scheme. Whitman deserves credit for standing
behind California's 33 percent renewable energy standard, but Brown
has made the same commitment and offered a much more detailed and
extensive plan for bringing renewable energy and jobs to California.
Under Brown's plan, California would see an additional 20,000
megawatts of renewable energy by 2020, including solar panels on com
mercial buildings and along highways. Financing would be provided for
efficiency upgrades to buildings, which consume approximately 40 per
cent of energy used in the U.S.
Voters this year have an important choice at the ballot box. Meg

Whitman offers radical spending cuts that would be ill advised in nor
mal times and catastrophic for a languid economy like California's.
Jerry Brown offers a long-term commitment to fiscal health that does
not sacrifice the economy and detailed plans to build California's
clean energy future.
