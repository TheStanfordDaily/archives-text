# Legalize it? Examining the sticky issues of Proposition 19
## 
### 
You've probably heard of Proposition 19, the Regulate, Control
and Tax Cannabis Act of 2010, which will go before California vot
ers on Tuesday. T f passed, Proposition 19 would unburden the Cal
ifornia criminal justice system while allowing the state to regulate the mar
ijuana industry. On the other hand, it raises some concerns, like the possi
ble boom of marijuana advertisements geared toward teens.
But what the board finds particularly troubling about Proposition 19
is its contradiction of federal law.
"Oh, come on, dude," you might say. "Legalizing pot is so harmless!"
Perhaps it is. But let's conduct a thought experiment for a moment. Sup
pose a conservative state were debating a proposition that would make it
illegal for a woman to have an abortion. Every Democrat in the country
would be campaigning to put an end to the bill, and in all likelihood, the
same people who are championing Proposition 19 would be on the streets
calling the people of the conservative state traitors to America. Even social
conservatives would likely argue that the better way to contest abortion
would be to overturn Roe v. Wade, not contradict the ruling via a state law.
In the case of Proposition 19, the U.S. attorney general made clear the
Justice Department would "vigorously enforce'' federal laws against mar
ijuana even if the proposition passes.
The majority of the board supports the notion of legalizing marijuana,
but some members, including supporters, feel the proposition is poorly
crafted. According to its terms, employers cannot discriminate against
workers who smoke, but they can reprimand poor performance that re
sults from stoned employees. This led opponents of the bill to claim that a
trucking company could not stop stoned drivers from getting behind the
wheel until an accident occurred. The proposition's vague language
makes it difficult to determine if that's true. Therefore, if Proposition 19
passes, the editorial board strongly supports the California legislature tak
ing steps to clarify and standardize what could be a very sticky situation.
All we ask if that our classmates who choose to support the bill under
stand the full implications of their vote. This isn't just about weed it's
about federalism and the unknown ramifications of an ambiguous propo
sition.
