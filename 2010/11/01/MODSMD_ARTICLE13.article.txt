# COMPILERS, STETHOSCOPES AND HEMINGWAY
## Enumerating and Accounting 
### Aaditya Shidham 
Recently, I have noticed a gaping hole in
our collective academic experience. As
students, our lives are filled primarily
with two things: events and deadlines. There is
that party you need to go to (an event) and that
paper you need to write (a deadline). I realize
this is an enormous oversimplification for most
of you, since we live in a world filled with hy
brids of these two ideas. (For example, where
would we put a SURPS presentation? It is cer
tainly an event, but one with the preparation re
quired for many other types of deadlines.)
Nonetheless, this bifurcation is for the most
part how we live our lives.
Calendars manage many of our day-to-day
events when/where we need to be given a
time of day. This seems to work extremely well
I am alerted on the calendar application on
my iPhone as soon as I need to get off my butt
and head somewhere. It is simple and clean.
But deadlines are not as easy to plan our day
around. Let's look at the options we currently
have:

We could somehow mark off a block of time
on our calendar as a period to get something
done. This works really well for many tasks
for example, we tell ourselves, "I will get gro
ceries after dinner" and that's pretty much
it. This seems to work for meaningless errands
things that you plan for and get out of your
way.

We could also make a daily routine to chip
off tasks that we do regularly taking a show
er, working out, getting breakfast, the usual.
Many have extended this idea to put in month
ly reminders in their calendars to do their laun
dry, check their University balance, cut their
hair the list goes on and on. Most of these

tasks are similar to errands they are simply
repeating ones.
As you can see, many of the mindless repeti
tions of our day/week/quarter have clearly de
fined goals and time periods in which we need
to accomplish them. They are the clerical parts
of our college experience and can be dealt with
as such.
Yet most of the things that are left study
ing for that midterm, writing a research propos
al, reviewing that thing in lecture and fleshing
out that great business idea come to define
the Stanford academic experience. These are
tasks that have real relevance to the richness of
our intellectual lives here. Yet ironically, despite
(and perhaps because) of their inherent dimen
sion and scope, they are the least-defined parts
of our schedules.
What seems to be the answer? Split the work
up into manageable chunks? Learn how to say
no more easily? Be more organized? Work like
a dog regardless? All these seem to be said to us
at different parts of our academic experience,
from middle school on.
Yet I think that the core of the issue is simple
accounting. And no, keeping a list of things to
do is not accounting. It is enumerating. The lat
ter holds all its tasks to a false equivalence be
tween its contents that is usually totally untrue.

"Get bananas" and "read 300 pages of a novel"
just can't be put into one list without losing the
significance of the reading or inflating the sig
nificance of the grocery store.
Yet how are these tasks essentially different?
Time. One task expects much more quality
time over another.

Accounting means to add this dimension of
time to the things we are obligated to get done.
The one constant for all of us is the amount of
hours that are available to us every week. What
a great currency, then, to decide a task's worth
against the hours it requires in a day! Let's say
something important will take 10 hours of your
time this week. Assuming some other time set
aside for classes, extracurriculars, meals, sleep
and the like, you know exactly the time you
have to play with. Any given Sunday, you im
mediately realize the worth of the hour be
tween your lunch and your class every day that
week. By squeezing the crevices of time for
their worth, work splits up into chunks and long
periods naturally. It immediately becomes ap
parent what you can and cannot do. You know
when you must work like a dog and when you
can relax. All the mottos we were ever given
about time management seem to point toward
this extra dimension!
The accounting of time with respect to our
tasks arms us with the tools we need to make in
formed decisions about our weeks, our months
and our years to come at Stanford. Perhaps in
another decade, we'll be ready for a couple
more dimensions.
