## CROSS COUNTRY WINS PAC-10 
### ZACH ZIMMERMAN DESK EDITOR 
For the first time in five years, Stanford has
cemented itself as the center for Pac-10 dis
tance running. On Saturday, the No. 1 men's and
No. 9 women's cross country teams won their
respective races in Seattle at the Pac-10 Cham
pionships, bringing both conference titles back
to the Farm.
The women were up first in the 6,000-meter
race on a rainy day in Washington. Though
ranked in the top 10 nationally, the Cardinal's
chances at victory appeared low as it was set to
face No. 2 Oregon, No. 6 Arizona and No. 20
Washington, the defending champion.
Although the Ducks took the individual
title, Stanford showcased its depth. A second
place finish from sophomore Kathy Kroeger, a
fifth-place result from redshirt junior Stephanie
Marcy and an eighth-place finish by freshman
Jessica Tonn managed to squeak out a victory.
The Cardinal squad was the only team to place
three runners in the top 10 as it clinched its first
Pac-10 title since 2007.
Stanford finished with 62 points, the highest
total by a conference champion since 1989. In
an extremely tight race, Arizona placed second
with 65 points, and Oregon and Washington
tied for third with 68. With the top four teams all
within six points of each other, Saturday's race
was the closest conference championship in
Pac-10 history.
" Our goal going into the race was to win, but
we knew it would be a really tough, really close
race," Kroeger said, after finishing with a time
of 19:49.43. "At a couple points during the race,
they announced current team scores, and we
were consistently among the top teams, so we

knew we had a shot. But ultimately it would
come down to finishing strong in the last mile of
the race. Even after everyone had finished, we
didn't know who had won until they announced
the scores."
Stanford also received scoring performanc
es from junior Georgia Griffin and Alex Gits, as
well as strong finishes from sophomore Alex
Dunne and redshirt junior Madeline Duhon.
Gits, a senior who finished in 26th, discussed the
implications of this meet for the remaining
races of the season.
"We now more than ever have a huge target
on our backs," she said. "The Pac-10 is just as
competitive as the larger upcoming races, so we
know now, going in, we have to repeat our per
formances or better them to see the same re
sults."
In the 8,000-meter men's race, there was
never any doubt once the gun sounded that Stan
ford would take home the title.
The Cardinal was once again led by the Big
Three, a trio comprised of veteran runners Elliott
Heath, Jake Riley and Chris Derrick. While
Heath crossed the finish line in first place with a
time of 23:00.46, his individual conference title
was all but a technicality, as Riley and Derrick
finished with virtually identical scores 0f23:00.57
and 23:00.59, respectively.
"The major goal of this program is to win
championships," Derrick said, "so when we go
out there and accomplish that, it always feels
good."

Possibly more impressive than the finish of the
top three were the performances of the Cardi
nal's secondary runners. Without veterans Ben
jamin Johnson and Brendan Gregg, Stanford
needed to receive stellar runs from Riley Sullivan
and Erik Olson.The two did not disappoint.

Olson and Riley Sullivan finished in 11th
and 15th, respectively, adding to the ninth
place finish of surprise star Miles Unterrein
er and the lOth-place performance of J.T.
Sullivan.
"Our entire second pack of guys really ran a
smart race and that is what ultimately won the
meet for us," Heath said. "I think there are some
other teams out there with some good depth, but
I think there are very few that can match up with
our depth if we continue to make strides as a team
like this weekend."
With all seven runners inside the top 15, Stan
ford easily won with just 25 total points. No. 3 Ore
gon finished in a distant second with 56 points, fol
lowed by No. 22 Cal in third with 86. The champi
onship marked the men's first since 2005.
Up next for the Stanford men and women
are the NCAA West Regionals, which take
place in Eugene, Ore., on Nov. 13.
While the Cardinal will undoubtedly turn its
sights toward the final meets of the year, mem
bers of the cross country program can enjoy the
experience of being the last champions in the
current version of the Pac-10.
"Seeing as this is the last one there will ever
be, it feels really good that it went to Stanford,"
Jake Riley said. "It's a testament to the hard
work we've been putting in all season, and it's
great to have something to show for it."
"It is such an unbelievable feeling," Gits
added. "I remember my freshman year being
overjoyed to be part of a program that wins
championships, and it is such a joy for the rest of
our competitors to know, once again, they can't
keep Stanford out of the equation."

"Our entire second pack of guys really ran a
smart race and that is what ultimately won the
meet for us," Heath said. "I think there are some
other teams out there with some good depth, but
I think there are very few that can match up with
our depth if we continue to make strides as a team
like this weekend."
With all seven runners inside the top 15, Stan
ford easily won with just 25 total points. No. 3 Ore
gon finished in a distant second with 56 points, fol
lowed by No. 22 Cal in third with 86. The champi
onship marked the men's first since 2005.
Up next for the Stanford men and women
are the NCAA West Regionals, which take
place in Eugene, Ore., on Nov. 13.
While the Cardinal will undoubtedly turn its
sights toward the final meets of the year, mem
bers of the cross country program can enjoy the
experience of being the last champions in the
current version of the Pac-10.
"Seeing as this is the last one there will ever
be, it feels really good that it went to Stanford,"
Jake Riley said. "It's a testament to the hard
work we've been putting in all season, and it's
great to have something to show for it."
"It is such an unbelievable feeling," Gits
added. "I remember my freshman year being
overjoyed to be part of a program that wins
championships, and it is such a joy for the rest of
our competitors to know, once again, they can't
keep Stanford out of the equation."
