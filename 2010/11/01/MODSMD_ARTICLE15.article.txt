# VOLLEYBALL TAKES STRAIGHT SWEEPS
## 
### KATHERINE KNOX CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The No. 4 Stanford women's volleyball team (18-2,
9-2 Pac-10) bounced back from a tough loss last week
end with consecutive sweeps of No. 18 Oregon (16-7,4-
7) and Oregon State (8-17,1-10) to open up the second
half of conference play.
Sophomore setter Karissa Cook made her return
debut in Eugene Friday night to help bring down the
Ducks in straight sets, 25-17,25-16,25-22.The return to
a 6-2 setting offense allowed senior setter/opposite
Cassidy Lichtman to resume her utility role. Lichtman

picked up 20 assists,
five digs and five
kills in three sets.
Oregon setter
Lauren Plum
worked for 32 assists,
splitting the offense
between sophomore
outside hitters Kat
Fischer and Alaina
Bergsma and senior
opposite Fleather
Meyers. Meyers, who
has been a primary
hitter for the Ducks
since her freshman
year, was held to a
.115 hitting percent
age on the night, but
still brought Ore
gon's hitting per
centage up to .078.
Low hitting per
centages character
ized the Oregon of
fense in the first set.

The Ducks called a time out after stringing together
three consecutive hitting errors and posted a fourth
upon returning to the court to put Stanford up 18-12.
The Cardinal gained an early lead in the second and
maintained it throughout the set, as senior libero Gabi
Ailes served out two four-point stretches to give Stan
ford its lead. Defense by Ailes, Cook and senior outside
hitter Alix Klineman was supplemented by an unbeat
able block. Freshman middle blocker Carly Wopat col
lected 8 blocks on the match.
Oregon took the lead at 21-20 in the third set, forc
ing Stanford head coach John Dunning to call his first
and only timeout of the match. Cook proceeded to rat
tle off four serves before Klineman put down a kill to
end the match.
Early offensive frustration yielded 28 total hitting
errors from the Ducks to the minimal 10 errors posted
by Stanford. Because Oregon had difficulty siding out
first-strike, the team ended up taking a full 29 swings
more than the Cardinal, who still strung together only
four fewer kills than the Ducks on the match.
With Ailes gathering 23 digs in three sets, Stanford's
defense pushed back the Oregon offense, creating op
portunities to force hitting errors. In addition to having
already broken records for average digs per set, season
digs and career digs for the Stanford volleyball pro
gram, Ailes has picked 1,955 digs to date after totaling
41 for the weekend.
After a day of rest in Eugene, the Card headed
north to Corvallis yesterday morning for a Halloween
battle against a spirited orange-and-black OSU crowd
of 850 fans.
Stanford took an early lead in the first set that was
quickly squandered with a service error, two attack er
rors and a reception error. A block by junior Stephanie
Browne and sophomore Hayley Spelman gave the
Card the boost to force nine hitting errors out of the
Beavers in the first, yielding a swift 25-17 win.
Timely kills by Beaver outside hitters Jill Sawatzky
and Camille Saxton matched six attack errors by the
Cardinal early in the second to keep OSU in contention
throughout the set.The Beavers held four leads mid-set
until a service error by setter Megan Mcßride and an
other block by Browne and Spelman forced OSU to

call a timeout. A pair of kills from freshman outside hit
ter Rachel Williams and Klineman allowed Stanford to
pull ahead and take the set 25-21.
The Beavers continued to spread the offense be
tween Saxton, Dre Shaw, and Ashley Eneliko in the
third, but the setters pushed sets out to Sawatzky dur
ing crucial points in the set. While Sawatzky delivered
14 kills on the match, the Beaver offense was held to a
.127 hitting percentage as Ailes picked up 18 more digs
and the Card put down nine blocks.
Cook and Lichtman each put up 19 assists, enabling
Klineman, Lichtman and Williams to get 31 combined
kills in the three sets. Led by Klineman, who continues
to top the conference charts for kills earned and points
earned, the Card continues to lead the nation in team
hitting percentage.
Stanford remains second to Cal in the conference as
it continues the quest for its fifth consecutive Pac-10
title.
The team returns to Maples Pavilion next weekend
to host UCLA at on Friday at 7 p.m. on Friday and
Southern California on Sunday at 1 p.m.
