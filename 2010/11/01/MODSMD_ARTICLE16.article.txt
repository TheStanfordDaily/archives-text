## Card blanks Oregon State on Senior Day 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The men's soccer team closed out
its home season in style on Sunday,
celebrating Senior Day with a decisive
3-0 victory over Oregon State. The tri
umph helped ease some of the pain of
Friday night's heartbreaking 1-0 loss
to Washington in the rain, a defeat
that likely ended Stanford's postsea
son hopes.
The weekend results pushed the
Cardinal's record to 8-9-0 on the year
and 4-5-0 in the Pac-10, with its final
regular season game against rival Cal
ifornia on Nov. 11.
Oregon State (6-8-0,1-6-0 Pac-10)
offered little resistance during Sun
day's game in front of a small crowd at
Laird Q. Cagan Stadium. Stanford
came out playing some of its most re
laxed and fluid soccer of the season,
which redshirt junior Garrett Gunther
attributed to the new starting lineup.
"It was really easy for us, because
we've played together for so long,"
Gunther said. "We are really comfort
able with each other, and we know
each other's tendencies and weak
nesses, so that just makes everything
simpler."
Head coach Bret Simon started all
six players from the class of 2011, as
well as redshirt senior Thiago Sa
Freire, and remarkably, each was
more or less in his natural position.
The Cardinal wasted little time
taking the lead, as the team came out
firing and broke through in the fifth
minute. Senior defender Ryan
Thomas's corner kick fell to senior de
fender Shaun Culver in the middle of
the box, and Culver left the ball off for
senior forward Dominique Yayhavi.
Yayhavi, Stanford's leading scorer,
finished the play and tallied his sixth
goal of the season.
It was only 10 minutes later that
the Cardinal added to its lead with a
surprising blast from Thomas. Gun
ther played a short ball off another
corner kick that found Thomas in a lit
tle space on the right side, and the de
fender hit a sharply driven ball
through a crowd in front of the goal.
Goalie Steve Spangler could not get
to it, and a sliding attempt by an Ore
gon State defender was too late as
Thomas scored his second career goal.
Sophomore Dersu Abolfathi
capped the afternoon's scoring late in
the first half, as he found himself wide
open in front of the goal only to whiff
on the shot, before gathering himself
and slotting his second attempt past
the keeper.
Stanford maintained possession
for most of the first half, dominating
Oregon State in almost every aspect
of the game. Even though the Beavers
came out with a bit more energy in the
second half, the Cardinal was still the
stronger side. Redshirt freshman
goalie Jason Dodson made a few im
pressive saves before being replaced
by fellow redshirt freshman Galen
Perkins in the 75th minute. Perkins

was able to hold down the Beaver at
tack, preserving the shutout for Stan
ford.
Dodson could not, however, keep a
clean sheet Friday night against Wash
ington (9-5-1,3-4-0) in what would be
the Cardinal's third straight 1-0 loss
and its seventh loss by one goal.
The Cardinal came out strong
against a physical Washington team
that had taken the first matchup of the
season, 2-0 at home.
Stanford caught a huge break in
the 10th minute when Washington's
Taylor Mueller was given a red card
and ejected from the match, leaving
the Fluskies to play 80 minutes with 10
men.
Stanford sent attackers forward all
night long in the rain and forced
Washington into a defensive shell for
most of the night. The Cardinal out
shot the Huskies 12-3 in the second
half, and senior defenders Cameron
Lamming and Bobby Warshaw com
bined for nine shots. But Husky goal
keeper Richey Spencer made several
key saves to keep Washington alive,
and Stanford began to press a little
too hard as time wound down.
In the 84th minute, the Cardinal
was caught with too many men in
front of the ball, and Washington
made it count. Two Husky attackers
combined to lead the break, and a per
fectly played through-ball left Dod
son helpless as senior Matt Van
Houten scored his fifth goal of the
season, three of which have come
against the Cardinal.
"The biggest thing we took away
from the game was that we have to ex
ecute on our chances," Gunther said.
"It's kind of the story of our season.
We never have played a game this
year where we thought we played par
ticularly poorly, but we lost a lot of
games when we didn't finish."
After the loss, Simon said there
wasn't much he could tell the team.
"There's not a whole lot you can
say after a game like that. I thanked
them for working hard and said we
just weren't good enough that night,"
he said.
"We had a lot of chances, and we
didn't finish them, and I thought our
movement with the ball wasn't that
crisp. If you leave the game hanging
like that, it can sometimes be snatched
away."
The loss likely ensured that Stan
ford will miss the postseason for the
eighth time in nine years. Even with a
win in its final game, the Card would
only reach a .500 record, which would
probably not be enough to secure an
at-large bid to the NCAA Tourna
ment field of 48 teams.
However, a game against rival Cal
still remains after the upcoming bye
weekend. The Cardinal will look to
play the role of spoiler against the Pac
-10 leader and send the senior class off
with a win on Nov. 11 in Berkeley.
