# Stanford is missing a sports bar
## 
### Daniel Bohm On My Mind 
So Stanford blew out
Washington. It was prob
ably the Cardinal's most
impressive performance
of the season. The much
maligned defense was stout, the
most overrated player in the coun
try, Jake Locker, was held in check
and Stanford committed to the run
and shoved it down the Huskies'
throats all day.
That is my analysis of the game.
Now, on to my experience of
watching the game. As many of you
know, the Stanford game coincided
with Game 3 of the World Series,
and, like many sports fans, I wanted
to watch both. When you live at
Stanford, that basically means you
have one option go to The Old
Pro.

I have been to The Old Pro
more times than I'd care to admit,
and I'm sure I'll be there plenty
more, but it took until yesterday
for me to realize that it was more
out of necessity than anything else.
I showed up about two hours
before either game started only to
find out it cost $3O just to get in!
There was a $lO cover charge and
$2O that was good for food or drink
credit. If you didn't have $3O (cash
only), you weren't getting in. If you
didn't want to eat, too bad, you
were paying 30 fucking dollars.
And this is supposed to be a col
lege town. Deplorable.
Once you got in, it wasn't as if
they were cutting you deals. $l4 for
a small pitcher of Bud Light. The
pitcher held about 3.5 beers. To put
that in perspective, you can get a 24-
pack of Bud Light at Safeway for
about that much. Eight chicken
wings cost $l2. What happened to a
sports bar being a utilitarian com
munity spot? Where are the
peanuts? Deals? Instead, at night
there is just some guy whose sole
job it is to yell at you to keep walk
ing. How dare you actually TALK
to your friends? Shame.
There was one good thing about
the ridiculous prices. My friends
and I were expecting the place to
be a mob scene given the bevy of
sporting events on Saturday, but it
never got too full. I'm fairly certain
that even the posh people of Palo
Alto were scared away by the ab
solutely egregious door price. And
of course, there were almost no
students. (How dare a sports bar in
a college town cater to college stu
dents? That would be something!)
I guess I shouldn't really be sur
prised by any of this. The Old Pro,
which may be my favorite bar in
Palo Alto (which is like being the
smartest kid at Cal not very dif
ficult), has always been identity
less and pricey. I think it's sup
posed to be a sports bar all the
TVs, the mechanical bull and the
pennants on the wall seem to sug
gest that but come 10 p.m. or so,
hip-hop music starts blaring over
the televisions for people to dance
... at a bar without a dance floor.
But people are still going to go to
The Old Pro. It will be packed on
most every weekend night, because
there isn't a viable alternative in the
area. The Dutch Goose, Oasis, Nut
House and Rosatti's are all much
better sports bar environments but
lack the television capacity of The
Old Pro. If I'm forgetting some
place, please do enlighten me.
On campus, you can watch a sin
gle game at the CoHo, the Tree
house and even Old Union, but
again, they don't give the opportu
nity to watch two games at once.
Some people might say I am asking
too much to have a decent sports
bar at Stanford, but I doubt there
are many, if any, college campuses
in America that have such a putrid
selection of places to watch games.
So like it or not, The Old Pro has
a monopoly. Hopefully it will stop
abusing that privilege, or maybe
some entrepreneurial type will
step up and create some competi
tion because my salary at The
Daily doesn't support $3O covers.

Despite five years at Stanford, Daniel
Bohm hasn't realized that Palo Alto isn't
really considered a college town. Dispel
