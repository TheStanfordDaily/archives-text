## Fernandez may have used alias Dining can't find name in records 
### ANNA SCHUESSLER STAFF WRITER 
A 20-year-old man who was ar
rested on campus on Oct. 19 for al
legedly burglarizing a Palo Alto
home may have used an alias while
working in a Stanford dining hall, Lt.
Sandra Brown of the Palo Alto Po
lice Department told The Daily.
Brown told the San Jose Mercury
News after the arrest that Jose Luis
Fernandez of East Palo Alto worked
in a Stanford dining hall, but Eric
Montell, the executive director of
Stanford Dining, has since said he
cannot find Fernandez's name in
Dining's employment records.
In an e-mail to The Daily, Montell
said Dining's records "did not indi
cate a person by this name having
worked in any of the Stanford Din
ing locations."
Bill Larson, a spokesman for the
Stanford Department of Public
Safety, confirmed the arrest took
place on the Stanford campus but
would not offer further comment, as
the alleged crime is under the juris
diction of the Palo Alto Police De
partment.

Brown said investigators in
volved in Fernandez's case provided

the information that he was affiliat
ed with Stanford Dining. Knowledge
of Fernandez's schedule at a dining
hall, she said, prompted the arrest.

The absence of Fernandez's
name from Stanford Dining em
ployee records might be attributed
to Fernandez's possible use of an
alias. "We have what's known as
AKAs, or 'also known as' names,"
Brown said. "Fie may have been
using an AKA while he was working
at a dining hall."

Fernandez faces jail time if he is
found guilty of the Oct. 8 burglary, in

which he allegedly broke into a cou
ple's home while they slept inside,
stole several items and took off in
the couple's Volkswagen. He was al
ready on probation for similar
charges, and he now faces more seri
ous consequences for his breach of
probation restrictions.
"He was on probation for burgla
ry, and he violated his probation,"
Brown said. "He's going to be in jail
for a long time."
