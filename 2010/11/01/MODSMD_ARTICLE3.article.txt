# STUDENT LIFE
## Campus celebrates 'traditions' Full Moon, Mausoleum Party deemed successes 
### BRANDON POWELL 
Stanford came to life over the
weekend in celebration of the dead,
with parties and events abounding as
students and faculty donned costumes
and makeup for the night (or multiple
nights).
Three junior class presidents
Marie Calgiuri, Cody Sam and Isabelle
Wijangco spoke to The Daily about
the end of Stanford's first official "Tra
ditions Week."
"Traditions Week was born to
make Mausoleum Party and Full
Moon on the Quad more sustainable
events that contribute more to the
Stanford community," Sam said. "It's
not just a party. It's also about philan
thropy, trying to help balance the
budget by selling T-shirts and getting
people more involved in the Stanford
community."
By encompassing Mausoleum and
Full Moon in something regarded as
"tradition," Calgiuri said the junior
presidents could emphasize to stu
dents and faculty that these events
must happen every year.
"It's a really important part of our
school," she said. "Sort of like a land
mark event that we always want to
have."
The three went on to explain what
Traditions Week entailed. Tuesday
began the pre-orders for the Mau
soleum Party T-shirts that read "Party
with Leland."
"At first we thought it was just a
cool phrase, and then we figured peo
ple might actually buy these tanks,"
Sam said. "It hadn't been done before,
so we were really excited about that."
On Wednesday, students could
write notes and send candy and post
cards to their friends abroad. Wij angco
said a major goal for the junior presi
dents is to keep their class unified, es
pecially because so many juniors go
abroad at some point during the year.
An activity like the note-writing, they
hoped, could strengthen the unity of
the junior class.
Thursday brought philanthropy in
the form of 20 pumpkins, donated by
Trader Joe's, in White Plaza, where stu
dents could paint them. Calgiuri said
the pumpkins, along with additional
unpainted ones, were sent to the Lu
cile Packard Children's Hospital for
the children to decorate.
Friday was a pump-up day for Sat
urday's Mausoleum Party.
"We had the Sea People playing in
White Plaza during lunch," Sam said.
"We also distributed all the T-shirts,
just to get people in the mood for a big
party we're investing so much into this
week."
Finally came Mausoleum. Sam was
excited that this year marked the fifth
anniversary of the return of Mau
soleum after its hiatus from 2002 to
2006.
"So, if you saw Mausoleum on the

posters with a5 in place of the's,' it's
because it calls attention to the fifth
anniversary of Mausoleum's return,"
Sam said,"which is why it should mean
a lot to the campus."
Before the weekend, the unani
mous concern voiced by the class pres
idents was the threat of rain. But they
said they were certain the party would
be at the Stanford Mausoleum regard
less of the weather.
"That was kind of by popular de
mand," Calgiuri said. "Our freshman
year, when it rained and the party was
held in Old Union, the general feed
back was that it just wasn't the same."
New to Mausoleum this year was
the chance for students to take pic
tures of themselves and others in cos
tume on the dance floor and have their
pictures projected on a screen at the
party, thanks to the Palo Alto-based
startup Cooliris.
At the party, the costume variety
was expectedly diverse. From Greek
deities to bananas to The Coon from
"South Park" to Ken from "Toy Story
3" to superheroes to burlesque
dancers, it seemed all beings dead,
alive, fictional and inanimate were
in attendance.
On Sunday, the junior class presi
dents expressed satisfaction with the
outcome of the event. Sam said
changes to the bus system, which in
cluded security and ID checks at each
stop, was one issue that was not com
pletely resolved but was still an im
provement upon last year.
"We were actually told by the ad

ministration that this is the smoothest
the bus system had ever gone," Wi
jangco said.
Student reception was also gener
ally positive, though some expressed a
slight disturbance at the scene at the
Mausoleum.
"I found it odd that there were Hal
loween decorations on the Mau
soleum itself," said Susan Haynes 'l4.
"But as a whole, it was a great party."
"To me there was something disre
spectful about 1,000 college kids grind
ing next to a 16-year-old's grave," said
Konstantine Buhler 'l4. "I think Jane's
intention was to have a place where
Leland could rest, not a place for kids
to put a tacky plastic skeleton on his
gate and blast house music."
Some students also drew compar
isons to Full Moon on the Quad, which
took place Monday of last week.
"Strangely enough, the Mau
soleum Party seemed less restrained
than Full Moon," said Linus Mixson
'l4. "Perhaps being in costume made
people feel bolder and less connected
to their actions."
Halloween options were not limit
ed to student parties, as a few events
were designed for the kids of Stanford.
Geoffrey and Patti Baker, resident fel
lows in Larkin, held a mass pumpkin
carving in the Larkin courtyard on Sat
urday, and Arroyo hosted a trick-or
treat party on Sunday with activities
for small kids.
