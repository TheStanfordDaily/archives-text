# STUDENT LIFE
## Campus celebrates 'traditions' Full Moon, Mausoleum Party deemed successes 
### BRANDON POWELL 
Stanford came to life over the
weekend in celebration of the dead,
with parties and events abounding as
students and faculty donned costumes
and makeup for the night (or multiple
nights).
Three junior class presidents
Marie Calgiuri, Cody Sam and Isabelle
Wijangco spoke to The Daily about
the end of Stanford's first official "Tra
ditions Week."
"Traditions Week was born to
make Mausoleum Party and Full
Moon on the Quad more sustainable
events that contribute more to the
Stanford community," Sam said. "It's
not just a party. It's also about philan
thropy, trying to help balance the
budget by selling T-shirts and getting
people more involved in the Stanford
community."
By encompassing Mausoleum and
Full Moon in something regarded as
"tradition," Calgiuri said the junior
presidents could emphasize to stu
dents and faculty that these events
must happen every year.
"It's a really important part of our
school," she said. "Sort of like a land
mark event that we always want to
have."
The three went on to explain what
Traditions Week entailed. Tuesday
began the pre-orders for the Mau
soleum Party T-shirts that read "Party
with Leland."
"At first we thought it was just a
cool phrase, and then we figured peo
ple might actually buy these tanks,"
