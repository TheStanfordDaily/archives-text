## For DM, new strategy, higher goal Organizers seek frosh, more dedicated dancers 
### BRENDAN O'BYRNE 
Organizers of Dance Marathon, the
24-hour dance party that raises money
and awareness to fight HIV and AIDS,
have tweaked their recruitment strategy
this year in an effort to donate $lOO,OOO
toward combating the pandemic.
The group last year raised $87,000,
which was donated to the Boston-based
Partners in Health and the San Francisco
based Bay Area Young Positives. Ninety
percent was matched by the Palo Alto
based organization FACE AIDS, which
was founded by Stanford students in 2005.
This year, organizers are focusing
more intently on fundraising and on re

cruiting dancers who will stay on their
feet for the full 24-hour party.
"We are more about getting engaged
dancers that are really dedicated," said
Louis Lu 'l2, Dance Marathon's public re

lations executive. Lu said recruiting
dancers who will remain standing for the
full 24 hours is important because last year,

Many dancers remained on their feet during the 2010 Dance Marathon, above, but others grew weary and left before the end of the overnight
marathon. This year, students registering for Dance Marathon pledged they would attend, raise $192 and remain standing for 24 hours.

a significant number of dancers ei
ther never showed or left early.
"Last year it was about getting
as many people involved as we
could," Lu said, "but this year, our
goal is to get all the dancers to stay
for the entire 24 hours."

Organizers are also focusing on
freshman registration this year, cit
ing the time constraints of upper
classmen. As part of this push, or
ganizers have visited freshman
dorm meetings dressed in rally gear,
hoping to get freshmen excited
about the event.

And for some freshmen, it's
worked.

"I've heard from people who had
done it before that it's a great
event," said Michael Lipman 'l4,
who registered for the event. "It
seems like a fun way to support a re
ally good organization."
Said Kevin Hurlbutt 'l4, another
freshman who registered: "It seems
like a really fun way to do some
community service. And all of my
friends are going to do it with me, so
it's going to be entertaining for
everybody."

More than 500 dancers have reg
istered for this year's marathon,
which is set to take place in Arrilla
ga Alumni Center on Feb. 12 and 13,
2011. During registration, dancers
pledged to stay for 24 hours, remain
on their feet and raise $192 toward
the overall donation.

The registration deadline for
dancers was Oct. 29, but students
can still sign up to be "moralers,"
who raise $6O and work three-hour
shifts to motivate the marathon
dancers. The deadline to sign up to
be a moraler is Nov. 14.

Dance Marathon organizers also
put together Hackathon, which en
courages students who have com
puter skills to participate in a 24-
hour coding session. Instead of rais
ing $192, hackers donate their tech
related services to nonprofit organ
izations. The deadline for
Hackathon was also Oct. 29, but
Hackathon Director Sam King 'l2
said organizers might allow a late
registration process to fill empty
slots on projects.
