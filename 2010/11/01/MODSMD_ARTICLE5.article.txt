# Caps on spending proposed
## If passed, bill would test ASSU constitution 
### MARGARET RAWSON DESK EDITOR 
The ASSU Undergraduate Senate will continue
debate Tuesday on a much-anticipated campaign fi
nance bill authored by Executives Angelina Cardona
'll and Kelsei Wharton 'l2. The bill, with the potential
to reform the entire executive campaign process,
would set executive-campaign spending caps and de
crease the amount of funds offered through public fi
nancing if it can overcome concerns about enforce
ment and constitutionality.
The bill would set spending caps at $750 for pub
licly financed slates, granting up to $5OO of ASSU
funds per slate, and $l,OOO for slates spending their
own money. The executives would allocate $3,000 of
their budget to campaign expenses, to be split evenly
between publicly financed slates. Currently, the exec
utives allocate $4,500, granting up to $750 per publicly
financed slate and capping those slates' total spending
at $1,500 each.
When first presenting their bill last Tuesday, Car
dona and Wharton spoke of creating a "culture of ac
cessibility" in which no student is deterred from run
ning for office due to monetary concerns. Then, many
senators seemed amenable to the bill on philosophi
cal grounds; some recalled their own difficulties in de
ciding to spend personal funds to run for the Senate,
Zachary Warma 'll, a senator last year, attended
the meeting to discuss several concerns about the
bill's unintended consequences, questioning whether
high levels of spending are truly a problem. (Warma is
now chair of the Daily editorial board.)
The original version of this year's bill cited as ra
tionale that "spending continues to increase annual
ly," but Cardona indicated that section would not ap
pear in an amended version this Tuesday. Since 2008,
the winning slate has not always been the one that
spent the most.

In 2008, the winning ticket, Johnny Dorsey 'O9 and
Fagan Harris 'O9, self-reported
spending $3,597.31. Competitors
David Gobaud 'lO and Greg Gold
gof 'OB spent $3,768.55, The Daily re
ported.
In 2009, Gobaud and Jay de la
Torre 'lO accepted public financing.
Their competitors, Bennett Hauser
'lO and Matt Sprague 'lO, did not
take public money and pledged to
keep their spending under $2,000.
Gobaud and de la Torre went on to
win the election.
In 2010, Cardona and Wharton
self-reported spending $998.91 on
their campaign last spring includ
ing $5OO from the ASSU, Wharton
said on Tuesday. Cardona and Whar
ton, the only slate among six to get
public financing that year, believe
they underspent at least one of their
competing slates.
Still, Cardona said any expecta
tion to spend personal funds could
still represent a hurdle to certain
students.
Recent efforts to create spending
limits have not been successful
the 10th and 11th Undergraduate
Senates did not pass bills containing
caps. In 1999, the ASSU Constitu
tional Council case Hartke v. Young
resulted in the ruling that mandato
ry campaign spending restrictions
represent "a clear abridgement of
free speech," violating Article I, Sec-

tion 3.2, of the ASSU c jlonstitution.
If passed, the Cardona-Wharton
bill could lead to a new case before
the Constitutional Council.
Cardona, who said she consid
ered the Hartke v. Young ruling in
drafting the bill, maintained that a
Constitutional Council case would
be a positive outcome and would
"ease the minds of those worried
about constitutionality."
Legal precedent since 2000 may
be on Cardona's side. In 2007, the
U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals
ruled in Flint v. Dennison against a
University of Montana student,
Aaron Flint, who surpassed school
campaign spending limits. The ruling
stated: "Educational interests out
weigh the free speech interests of
the students who campaigned within
that limited public forum."
"I think it's important to make
the clarification that we're not
telling people how to spend their
money or express themselves . ..
we're just saying how much to spend
overall," Cardona said. "We don't
want to stifle innovation."
Cardona said compared to its
peer institutions, some of which
allow no campaign spending, Stan
ford spends much more on elections.
UC-Berkeley, for example, caps
spending at $l,OOO.
Still, if the bill passes the consti
tutionality test, several concerns re
main about enforcement.
"Their ideals are correct in trying
to provide a level of equity in cam
paigns," Warma said, while going on
to argue the bill would only serve to

"institutionalize financial discrepan
cies" by mandating that non-financed
slates spend 25 percent more than
publicly funded slates, $l,OOO to $750.
Warma also worried the bill
would unnecessarily tie the ASSU
financial manager into the highly
political and emotional campaign
process, affecting "the long-term
health of the institution of the
ASSU."
"You don't want your money
men or women remotely near the
stench of elections," Warma said.
The bill would require each slate
to submit an itemized budget of
campaign expenses before cam
paigning, to be audited by the finan
cial manager after the election.
"An independent auditor could
be a solution to that," Cardona said.
She said she and Wharton are still
seeking feedback on the bill and are
flexible to changes, she said.
Warma also complained of
"needlessly confusing language"
and questioned whether each sena
tor had given the bill three pages
in full a thorough reading.
As of Sunday evening, several
senators were positive about the
bill's prospects.
"I think the bill's going to pass. I
didn't hear one senator strongly op
pose [it]," said Senator Kamil Saeid
'l3; Senator Stewart Macgregor-
Dennis 'l3 expressed a similar sense.
The Senate meets Tuesday at 7
p.m. in the Old Union Nitery.
