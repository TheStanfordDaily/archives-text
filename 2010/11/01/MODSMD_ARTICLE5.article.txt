# Caps on spending proposed
## If passed, bill would test ASSU constitution 
### MARGARET RAWSON DESK EDITOR 
The ASSU Undergraduate Senate will continue
debate Tuesday on a much-anticipated campaign fi
nance bill authored by Executives Angelina Cardona
'll and Kelsei Wharton 'l2. The bill, with the potential
to reform the entire executive campaign process,
would set executive-campaign spending caps and de
crease the amount of funds offered through public fi

financed slate and capping those slates' total spending
at $1,500 each.
When first presenting their bill last Tuesday, Car

ning for office due to monetary concerns. Then, many
senators seemed amenable to the bill on philosophi
cal grounds; some recalled their own difficulties in de
ciding to spend personal funds to run for the Senate,
Zachary Warma 'll, a senator last year, attended
the meeting to discuss several concerns about the
bill's unintended consequences, questioning whether
high levels of spending are truly a problem. (Warma is
now chair of the Daily editorial board.)
The original version of this year's bill cited as ra
tionale that "spending continues to increase annual
ly," but Cardona indicated that section would not ap
pear in an amended version this Tuesday. Since 2008,
the winning slate has not always been the one that
spent the most.

In 2008, the winning ticket, Johnny Dorsey 'O9 and
