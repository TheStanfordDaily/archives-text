## Card shuts down Huskies' offense 
### KABIR SAWHNEY MANAGING EDITOR 
There was no letting up this time for
Stanford.
The No. 13 Cardinal football team
(7-1,4-1 Pac-10) cruised past Washing
ton (3-5, 2-3) on Saturday afternoon,
rolling up 28 first-half points en route
to a 41-0 victory.
The Cardinal won the battle at the
line of scrimmage throughout the
game its offensive line manhandled
the Washington front seven and
opened up huge holes for Stanford's
running backs, getting big blocks both
at the line and downfield. Redshirt
sophomore quarterback Andrew
Luck had excellent pass protection
and plenty of time to make throws to
his receivers.
"The line played excellently today,"
said sophomore running back Stepfan
Taylor, the Card's leading rusher. "The
two touchdowns I got, I was basically
untouched, and they blocked well for
[freshman running back Anthony]
Wilkerson and [sophomore running
back] Tyler Gaffney."
While the offensive line controlled
the line of scrimmage when Stanford
had the ball, the defensive front seven

made sure the Huskies couldn't do the
same. Stanford defensive linemen and
linebackers were in the backfield all
game long, notching three sacks and six
tackles for loss. The unit kept up con
stant pressure on Washington quarter

GAME NOTES; Despite shutting out Washing
ton, Stanford remains at No. 13 in the BCS
rankings. It will put that ranking on the line
next weekend in a big showdown against
No. 15 Arizona.

Quarterback Andrew Luck posted an impressive game Saturday, throwing for 192 yards and a touchdown on 19-26
passing. Luck's running game was perhaps even more impressive, giving the Card 92 yards on five carries.
back Jake Locker, constantly forcing
him out of the pocket and pressuring
him into making poor throws.
Stanford's defensive line was espe
cially impressive. The trio of redshirt
junior defensive end Matt Masifilo,
senior nose tackle Sione Fua and red
shirt senior defensive end Brian Bul
cke kept the Washington offensive line
engaged and freed up the Cardinal
linebacking corps to stuff the Husky
running game.
Masifilo had one of the best games
of his career, making five tackles, in
cluding three solo tackles, and sacking
Locker twice himself.
"We just took the opportunity to
get after them," Masifilo said. Fua and
Bulcke "were dominating the line so
much in front that everything had to
bounce outside to us. We just stressed
playing as a team."
Overall, Stanford's defense limited
the Huskies to just 107 total yards on
offense, the second-fewest yards al
lowed in Stanford history. The rushing
attack was held to 19 yards on 25 at
tempts, and Washington never got past
the Stanford 42-yard line.
Leading the defense were sopho
more inside linebacker Shayne Skov
and redshirt sophomore outside line
backer Chase Thomas. Thomas had
nine tackles and a sack, while Skov
added eight tackles. Both helped the
Stanford defense bounce back from a
few tough outings in its last three
games, it gave up 52 points to Oregon,
failed to stop USC at numerous critical
junctures and gave up three fourth
quarter touchdowns to a one-win
Washington State team.
"Our linebackers were outstand
ing," said Stanford head coach Jim
Harbaugh. "They kept up a lot of pres
sure on Jake and clogged up the run
ning lanes."
"We were making it an emphasis to
stop them on first down, put them in
long-yardage situations and then let
our defensive line play aggressively
and wreak havoc," Skov said. "Any
time the quarterback gets hit that fre

quently, that's tough [for Washing
ton]."
Stanford's much-maligned pass de
fense also played very well. Locker, be
lieved to be one of the top NFL
prospects of the upcoming draft, was
severely limited, earning just 64 yards
on 7-14 passing with no scores and two
interceptions. His vaunted mobility
was also shut down, as he ran the ball
eight times for one net yard (he gained
17 yards but lost 16). Both Stanford in
terceptions killed Washington drives
that looked to be gaining some mo
mentum and ensured that Washington
would be unable to get back in the
game.
While Locker struggled, Luck had
a strong game both through the air
and on the ground. Luck threw for 192
yards and a touchdown on 19-26 pass
ing. He also threw an interception on
a Hail Mary play as time expired in
the first half.
Perhaps a bigger story was Luck's
mobility, as he gained 92 yards on five
carries. His biggest run came on a so
called "read option" play on Stan
ford's first drive of the game. Luck
faked a handoff to Taylor, who drew
the defense to the right, and ran 51
yards down the left side of the field
into the end zone. The play gave the
Cardinal early momentum and
sucked the energy out of a raucous
Husky Stadium crowd.
"The guys had a great block on the
edge, and I cut inside of him," Luck
said. "Stepfan did a great job of carry
ing his fakeout. I don't think people
realized I had the ball, and it was easy
to sprint from there."
"It was just an incredible fake by
Andrew," Harbaugh said. "I thought
Stepfan Taylor had the ball for 20
yards and thought, 'Oh,good,wegota
10,15,20-yard gain with Stepfan," but
then I realized that Andrew Luck's
got the ball, and he's streaking down
the sideline, and I couldn't be more
pleased."

Luck's big run was just one ele
ment of a Stanford running attack

that repeatedly pounded Washington,
moving the ball methodically and
keeping the clock running. Taylor
took 20 carries for 104 yards and two
touchdowns, and Gaffney added 13
carries, 50 yards and a touchdown in
his first game back from a leg injury.
Overall, Stanford gained 278 yards on
47 carries for an average of 5.9 yards
per carry.
More than any other statistic, the
disparity between the two running
games illustrated the gap between the
two teams. The Huskies only ran for
19 yards on 25 carries, or an average of
0.8 yards per carry. The Card also held
a big advantage in time of possession,
holding the ball for 37 minutes and 30
seconds.
For Washington, the loss means a
difficult path to earn bowl eligibility.
The Huskies need to win three of
their last four games to become bowl
eligible, but with their next game
against No. 2 Oregon, that could be a
formula to missing out on the postsea
son.
Meanwhile, Stanford took another
step toward a high finish in the Pac-10
and potentially earning a BCS bowl
berth. However, next week's matchup
against Arizona (7-1, 4-1 Pac-10)
looms large. The two teams are tied
for second in the conference, and the
Wildcats have looked impressive in
conference play so far.
Nevertheless, Harbaugh believes
his team can have success, highlight
ing the improvements it has made
over the course of the season.
"I've thought a lot about what suc
cess is and what makes a successful
year, and to me, it's improvement," he
said. "It's an improvement-equals
success formula. Improvement will
lead to wins, and wins will lead to
championships. We'll move on with
humble hearts and see if we can't make
some improvements when we get
back."

against No. 2 Oregon, that could be a
formula to missing out on the postsea
son.
Meanwhile, Stanford took another
step toward a high finish in the Pac-10
and potentially earning a BCS bowl
berth. However, next week's matchup
against Arizona (7-1, 4-1 Pac-10)
looms large. The two teams are tied
for second in the conference, and the
Wildcats have looked impressive in
conference play so far.
Nevertheless, Harbaugh believes
his team can have success, highlight
ing the improvements it has made
over the course of the season.
"I've thought a lot about what suc
cess is and what makes a successful
year, and to me, it's improvement," he
said. "It's an improvement-equals
success formula. Improvement will
lead to wins, and wins will lead to
championships. We'll move on with
humble hearts and see if we can't make
some improvements when we get
back."

There was no letting up this time for
Stanford.
The No. 13 Cardinal football team
(7-1,4-1 Pac-10) cruised past Washing
ton (3-5, 2-3) on Saturday afternoon,
rolling up 28 first-half points en route
to a 41-0 victory.
The Cardinal won the battle at the
line of scrimmage throughout the
game its offensive line manhandled
the Washington front seven and
opened up huge holes for Stanford's
running backs, getting big blocks both
at the line and downfield. Redshirt
sophomore quarterback Andrew
Luck had excellent pass protection
and plenty of time to make throws to
his receivers.
"The line played excellently today,"
said sophomore running back Stepfan
Taylor, the Card's leading rusher. "The
two touchdowns I got, I was basically
untouched, and they blocked well for
[freshman running back Anthony]
Wilkerson and [sophomore running
back] Tyler Gaffney."
While the offensive line controlled
the line of scrimmage when Stanford
had the ball, the defensive front seven

made sure the Huskies couldn't do the
same. Stanford defensive linemen and
linebackers were in the backfield all
game long, notching three sacks and six
tackles for loss. The unit kept up con
stant pressure on Washington quarter

GAME NOTES; Despite shutting out Washing
ton, Stanford remains at No. 13 in the BCS
rankings. It will put that ranking on the line
next weekend in a big showdown against
No. 15 Arizona.

Quarterback Andrew Luck posted an impressive game Saturday, throwing for 192 yards and a touchdown on 19-26
passing. Luck's running game was perhaps even more impressive, giving the Card 92 yards on five carries.
back Jake Locker, constantly forcing
him out of the pocket and pressuring
him into making poor throws.
Stanford's defensive line was espe
cially impressive. The trio of redshirt
junior defensive end Matt Masifilo,
senior nose tackle Sione Fua and red
shirt senior defensive end Brian Bul
cke kept the Washington offensive line
engaged and freed up the Cardinal
linebacking corps to stuff the Husky
running game.
Masifilo had one of the best games
of his career, making five tackles, in
cluding three solo tackles, and sacking
Locker twice himself.
"We just took the opportunity to
get after them," Masifilo said. Fua and
Bulcke "were dominating the line so
much in front that everything had to
bounce outside to us. We just stressed
playing as a team."
Overall, Stanford's defense limited
the Huskies to just 107 total yards on
offense, the second-fewest yards al
lowed in Stanford history. The rushing
attack was held to 19 yards on 25 at
tempts, and Washington never got past
the Stanford 42-yard line.
Leading the defense were sopho
more inside linebacker Shayne Skov
and redshirt sophomore outside line
backer Chase Thomas. Thomas had
nine tackles and a sack, while Skov
added eight tackles. Both helped the
Stanford defense bounce back from a
few tough outings in its last three
games, it gave up 52 points to Oregon,
failed to stop USC at numerous critical
junctures and gave up three fourth
quarter touchdowns to a one-win
Washington State team.
"Our linebackers were outstand
ing," said Stanford head coach Jim
Harbaugh. "They kept up a lot of pres
sure on Jake and clogged up the run
ning lanes."
"We were making it an emphasis to
stop them on first down, put them in
long-yardage situations and then let
our defensive line play aggressively
and wreak havoc," Skov said. "Any
time the quarterback gets hit that fre

quently, that's tough [for Washing
ton]."
Stanford's much-maligned pass de
fense also played very well. Locker, be
lieved to be one of the top NFL
prospects of the upcoming draft, was
severely limited, earning just 64 yards
on 7-14 passing with no scores and two
interceptions. His vaunted mobility
was also shut down, as he ran the ball
eight times for one net yard (he gained
17 yards but lost 16). Both Stanford in
terceptions killed Washington drives
that looked to be gaining some mo
mentum and ensured that Washington
would be unable to get back in the
game.
While Locker struggled, Luck had
a strong game both through the air
and on the ground. Luck threw for 192
yards and a touchdown on 19-26 pass
ing. He also threw an interception on
a Hail Mary play as time expired in
the first half.
Perhaps a bigger story was Luck's
mobility, as he gained 92 yards on five
carries. His biggest run came on a so
called "read option" play on Stan
ford's first drive of the game. Luck
faked a handoff to Taylor, who drew
the defense to the right, and ran 51
yards down the left side of the field
into the end zone. The play gave the
Cardinal early momentum and
sucked the energy out of a raucous
Husky Stadium crowd.
"The guys had a great block on the
edge, and I cut inside of him," Luck
said. "Stepfan did a great job of carry
ing his fakeout. I don't think people
realized I had the ball, and it was easy
to sprint from there."
"It was just an incredible fake by
Andrew," Harbaugh said. "I thought
Stepfan Taylor had the ball for 20
yards and thought, 'Oh,good,wegota
10,15,20-yard gain with Stepfan," but
then I realized that Andrew Luck's
got the ball, and he's streaking down
the sideline, and I couldn't be more
pleased."

Luck's big run was just one ele
ment of a Stanford running attack

that repeatedly pounded Washington,
moving the ball methodically and
keeping the clock running. Taylor
took 20 carries for 104 yards and two
touchdowns, and Gaffney added 13
carries, 50 yards and a touchdown in
his first game back from a leg injury.
Overall, Stanford gained 278 yards on
47 carries for an average of 5.9 yards
per carry.
More than any other statistic, the
disparity between the two running
games illustrated the gap between the
two teams. The Huskies only ran for
19 yards on 25 carries, or an average of
0.8 yards per carry. The Card also held
a big advantage in time of possession,
holding the ball for 37 minutes and 30
seconds.
For Washington, the loss means a
difficult path to earn bowl eligibility.
The Huskies need to win three of
their last four games to become bowl
eligible, but with their next game
against No. 2 Oregon, that could be a
formula to missing out on the postsea
son.
Meanwhile, Stanford took another
step toward a high finish in the Pac-10
