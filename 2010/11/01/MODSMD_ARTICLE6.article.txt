## Card shuts down Huskies' offense 
### KABIR SAWHNEY MANAGING EDITOR 
There was no letting up this time for
Stanford.
The No. 13 Cardinal football team
(7-1,4-1 Pac-10) cruised past Washing
ton (3-5, 2-3) on Saturday afternoon,
rolling up 28 first-half points en route
to a 41-0 victory.
The Cardinal won the battle at the
line of scrimmage throughout the
game its offensive line manhandled
the Washington front seven and
opened up huge holes for Stanford's
running backs, getting big blocks both
at the line and downfield. Redshirt
sophomore quarterback Andrew
Luck had excellent pass protection
and plenty of time to make throws to
his receivers.
"The line played excellently today,"
said sophomore running back Stepfan
Taylor, the Card's leading rusher. "The
two touchdowns I got, I was basically
untouched, and they blocked well for
[freshman running back Anthony]
Wilkerson and [sophomore running
back] Tyler Gaffney."
While the offensive line controlled
the line of scrimmage when Stanford
had the ball, the defensive front seven

made sure the Huskies couldn't do the
same. Stanford defensive linemen and
linebackers were in the backfield all
game long, notching three sacks and six
tackles for loss. The unit kept up con
stant pressure on Washington quarter
