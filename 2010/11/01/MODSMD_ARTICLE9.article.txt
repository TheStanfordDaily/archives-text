## THE TRANSITIVE PROPERTY Reconstructing My life Narrative
### Cristopher Bautista 
I don't have a past. I can't talk about the days
when I was a little boy, when I played with
trucks and trains and dressed up as a cow
boy for Halloween. I can't talk about my days
playing in Little League. I can't talk about my
awkward growth spurt in high school, about
hearing my name during graduation or read
ing my name on my high school diploma. I
can't see my school pictures and see myself. I
can't talk about those experiences because
they never happened.
it makes me sad, thinking about how there
are parts of my past that I simply can't change.
Regardless of whether or not I decide to recon
struct for myself a more normal childhood
to essentially lie that doesn't change the fact
that I had to grow up as a little girl, with uncom
fortable dresses and Barbie dolls, and to put up
with 20 years of feeling miserable but never
knowing quite why.
The narrative of my life, due to my transi
tion, is incoherent, blurry. Whatever happened
before sophomore year of college in my mind
is simply a nebulous black hole. It was as if I
didn't actually start existing until I finally came
out to myself as a guy. Whenever I have to refer
to a time before my transition from my in
fant years to the end of my freshman year I
get really uncomfortable. I realize that if I want
to continue my life as a man, there are parts of
my life I have to leave behind.
I realize that I probably can't go back to my
high school. I went to a Catholic high school,
and I don't think they'll be a fan of the trans
thing. No one will recognize me if I go back. My
teachers did a lot for me and got me to Stan
ford, and I owe them. But I don't know if I will
ever be able to come back and thank them.
Sure, high school wasn't the best experience
I spent most of it feeling depressed and con
fused but it was still four years of my life
that I essentially have to erase from my life
narrative. And there are people from high
school who refuse to talk to me because of my
transition, something that gets me upset when
ever I think about it.

If I ever find myself a girlfriend would
she know beforehand about my identity as a
trans person, or would this be a secret that I
wouldn't disclose until later? If I meet a girl
at Stanford, she'll be very aware of my transi
tion. But if I meet someone after Stanford, at
work or at grad school, once I look more con
vincingly like a guy, people will assume I was

born male, and the trans issue isn't necessary
to disclose prior to or during the first date.
But when will I tell her? I know I have to,
eventually. Would I tell her when we're final
ly seriously dating, when she sees me less as
this anomaly of nature, as Cristopher the
transguy who can tell her all about being
queer and trans, but just as Cris, her cute and
not short, but fun-sized boyfriend who just
happened to be born as a girl, no big deal? I
know that the time I come out will affect the
dynamics of our relationship, and I'm not
very sure how I would handle it.
When I have kids, will I tell them about
their dad's past? Do I want to give them infor
mation that will confuse them, give other kids
on the playground an excuse to make fun of
them? Or will I have to construct some new
past that is more conventional, more consis
tent with my appearance and identity but is all
a complete lie? Will I even need to tell them
the truth at all? Will my kids live in a society
where that sort of stuff doesn't matter any
more?
I understand in order to become a healthy
person and finally be happy, I need to ac
knowledge that my life prior to my transition
as uncomfortable as it all is to think about
is still part of my life. My past experience,
despite how awkward and painful it was, has
shaped me as a young man, and there are
things I have learned in this life and this body
that I don't think many biologically male men
ever learn. I should be thankful for the chance
to live this life.
But if someone asked me once if I had the
choice to change my biological sex and relive
my life from the beginning, what would I say?
And at the moment, I don't know how I would
answer. And that scares me.
