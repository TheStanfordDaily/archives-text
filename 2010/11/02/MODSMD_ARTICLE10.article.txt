## Former Stanford graduate student Elif Batuman wins prestigious writing award 
### JENNY THAI STAFF WRITER 
Elif Batuman Ph.D 'O7 and
nine other young authors
received the 2010 Whiting
Writers' Awards late last
month at the Morgan Li
brary & Museum in New York City.
The awards, currently set at
$50,000 each, have been given annu
ally by the Mrs. Giles Whiting Foun
dation to exceptionally gifted writers
who show promise in their early writ
ing careers.
The 250-person crowd included
Whiting foundation members, pub
lishing colleagues, award recipients'
editors, family and friends. The
keynote speaker was Peter
Matthiessen, an award-winning
writer, who has written more than 30
books, including "The Snow Leop
ard" and "Shadow Country," both of
which won National Book Awards.
Batuman's winning book, "The
Possessed: Adventures with Russian
Books and the People Who Read
Team," published by Farrar, Straus
and Giroux, is a collection of mem
oirs drawn from experiences during
her years as a Stanford graduate stu
dent. Described as "an antic romp
through literary academia," Batu
man's work was praised for its liter
ary wit and distinctive humor.
"She doesn't take herself too seri
ously, but she takes her enterprise
completely seriously, even while re
maining funny about it," wrote the
Whiting selection committee in a
press release. "She is sly, charming
and erudite. Who would have be

lieved the lives of contemporary
graduate students could match the
models of Dostoevsky and Tolstoy in
obsessiveness, wanderlust and belief
in the power of literature to trans
form the world?"
Making connections across works
of literature is nothing new for Batu
man. Even in her earliest years of
writing, Batuman has enjoyed ex
ploring multiple works and seeking
to find the hidden links among them.
"I learned to write when I was
five," Batuman said. "I've always
liked to write. When I was little, I had
this project to tie up all of the fairy
tales together. You know how there
always seems to be a witch in every
story? I wondered, 'What if the fairy
tales' witches were all the same
witch? I like the idea that everything
might be connected and is one big
story."
Batuman, during her undergradu
ate studies at Harvard, initially wrote
fiction, but her writing interests shift
ed to nonfiction, particularly mem
oirs. She has published articles in The
New Yorker, Harper's Magazine and
n+l. Batuman sees literature of all
genres as possessing the power to re
veal things about the world.
"The world is a mysterious place,"
Batuman said. "We need books to
provide some sense of quest for
meaning."
"The Possessed" is based on Batu
man's miscellaneous "ridiculous ex
periences" along her journey in aca
demia. Many of these consist of com
parative literature conferences and
funded research in pursuits such as
the murder investigation of Russian
author Leo Tolstoy.

"I have a tendency to create my
own job," Batuman said. "One sum
mer, I had gone over to Moscow.
They initially didn't want me, but I
went over there anyway and invent
ed [the job]."
Another zany episode of literary
academia that Batuman highlighted
in "The Possessed" was her un
planned immersion in Uzbek culture
in 2002.
"It was a two-month-long sum
mer program in Samarkand, Uzbek
istan," she said. "I thought I was
going to teach Uzbek but it turned
out I wasn't eligible for the Stanford
teaching position there. I had gotten
the grant money already and could
n't return it. So I ended up going and
when I got there, I was the only stu
dent. Four hours every day, one-on
one tutoring in Uzbek culture and
history. It was really strange and
touching at the same time."
It is Batuman's strange adven
tures where she draws inspiration
from for her own writing, which
brings forth absurd events in a curi
ous blend of creative solemnity.
"Some people see my book as an
academic absurdity," she said.
"I find that ridiculousness human
and likable," she added. "My mood is
solidarity in the face of adversity. You
share this observation that some
thing is absurd and then it's comfort
ing it makes you feel less alone."
Batuman looks forward to work
ing on her next book. In the coming
year, she will be a writer in residence
at Koc University in Istanbul.
