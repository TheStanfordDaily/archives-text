In '"Blackout in a can' sparks con
cerns" (Oct. 25), The Daily reported
in an accompanying graphic that one
can of Four Loko had the equivalent
alcohol content of three beers. The
story stated it held the alcohol con
tent of four beers. A can of Four Loko
is 12 percent alcohol by volume in a
23.5 ounce can,putting it at about 4.7
beers per can of Four Loko, assuming
beer is 5 percent alcohol by volume.

In "Campus celebrates 'tradi
tions"' (Nov. 1), due to an editing
error, The Daily misspelled the
name of Marie Caligiuri, a junior
class president.
