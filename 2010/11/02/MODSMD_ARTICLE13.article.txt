## Panel discusses new financial reform 
### JOANNA XU SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
A panel of experts convened yes
terday afternoon to discuss the
Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and
Consumer Protection Act of 2010
(Dodd-Frank Act), enacted in July
2010. The Rock Center for Corporate
Governance, a joint initiative of the
Stanford Law School (SLS) and the
Stanford Graduate School of Busi
ness (GSB), convened the panel.
Panelists included Neel Kashkari,
managing director at bond house
PIMCO, former assistant secretary of
the Treasury and the first TARP
chief; business professor Darrell
Duffie and law professor Joseph
Grundfest.
When asked to grade the Dodd-
Frank on a scale of one to 10, with
10 most effective, Duffie and
Grundfest granted the bill an "in
complete" while Kashkari rated the
bill a three. All three agreed that the
legislation fails to address certain
important issues.
"'Too big to fail' is insufficiently
addressed," Kashkari said. The act
"doesn't attempt to address Fannie
and Freddie, and at 2,500 pages, it's
only about 2,300 pages too long."
The Dodd-Frank Act attempts to
address the problem of "too big to
fail" the idea that certain financial
institutions were so huge and systemi
cally important that the government
could not let them fail by giving the
government receivership authority.
"However, you have to separate a
normal crisis from an extraordinary
crisis," Kashkari said. "In an extraor
dinary crisis, where the entire system
is at risk, these tools can't work, be
cause if you wind down one institu
tion, you risk destabilizing other insti
tutions."

Duffie, an expert on derivatives
and the financial system, credited
the Dodd-Frank Act for improve
ments in the safety and competi
tion/market efficiency of derivatives
transactions, the main problems of
which occurred in the over-the
counter (OTC) market.

The press has probably overdone
it in terms of reporting on the size of
the role that derivatives actually
played in the financial crisis, Duffie
said.
Nonetheless, the Dodd-Frank Act
made headway in requiring standard
derivatives to be cleared on ex
changes and to be guaranteed by
clearinghouses; a new classification
of derivatives exchanges, called Swap
Execution Facilities, was also created
for smaller order books.
"Such infrastructure improve
ments provide the greatest promise
of improving financial regulation,"
Duffie said.
The panel also discussed the issue
of corporate governance and its role
in the financial crisis. While all three
panelists agreed that failures in cor
porate governance were not the main
cause of the financial crisis, they dis
agreed on the magnitude of its contri
bution.
Grundfest argued that greater
contributors to the crisis were infor
mation failure and the collective fail
ure on the regulatory side in terms of
risk analysis and management.
"The government of the U.S.A. in
the banking sector and in the securi
ties sector had all the necessary au
thority and data to prevent this crisis
from happening," Grundfest said.
"But OTS [Office of Thrift Supervi
sion] ... did not understand the im
plications of the data it had access to."
Kashkari, however, argued that
"it's very hard to be the one wise per
son in a sea of fools," and it may be
unrealistic to expect anyone to be
wise in advance.
In response to a further question
that it is the responsibility of regula
tors to anticipate asset bubbles by
"[taking] away the punch bowl right
when the party gets going," Kashkari
responded that every regulator lives
in a political world and cannot be
prescient.
"You can't legislate wisdom,"
Kashkari added.
