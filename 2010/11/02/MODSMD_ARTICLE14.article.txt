## Kinley discusses finance, human rights 
### ANGELIQUE DAKKAK 
David Kinley, chair of human
rights law at the University of Syd
ney, addressed economists, financiers,
consultants, human rights activists
and students in his talk Monday
morning entitled, "Principle, Pragma
tism or Prostitution? Speaking
Human Rights to Global Finance."
He focused on the possibility of
establishing a relationship of equal
reciprocity between global finance
and human rights.
"The whole thing is very murky,"
he said. "To use Dick Cheney's terms,
of course in a different sense, we are
working in the shadows."
Kinley emphasized that construc
tion of a global economy and finance
will act as an engine to push for
greater attention to human rights
within the sphere of the worldwide
economy.
"A global economy and finances is
not an end, but rather a means to a
better life for as many individuals as
possible," he said.
Yet Kinley said that so far, global
finance and human rights efforts
have not been as cooperative as they
should be, and sometimes seem to di
rectly oppose each other.
Kinley analyzed three major con
cepts: the composition of the global
economy and its relationship with
human rights, the attitudes of both
sides and, ultimately, the effort to
make a connection between both
camps.
Ilie global economy consists of
two parts: a real, tangible economy,
including such things as foreign and
direct investment and taxation that
normal citizens are fairly familiar
with, and a surreal economy, which

consists of such things as derivatives
and remittances, which everyday citi
zens are less aware of, Kinley said. He
described the real economy as hinged
and the surreal as unhinged.
Kinley stressed the importance of
taking action in redistributing funds
to benefit the population at large and
in doing so, advocating for human
rights and a better understanding of
the surreal economy.
Kinley also discussed the attitudes
between global finance and human
rights. At its extreme, the attitude of
global finance is that human rights is
sues are for the state, and because
corporations are private, they are not
accountable for the rest of the popu-

lation.
Kinley said that in order for
human rights ideals to be achieved in
cooperation with global finance, this
attitude needs to change. He said
global finance is still largely discon
nected from reality and from the gen
eral population. The human rights
camp, at its extreme, holds the atti
tude that commerce is inherently
bad. According to Kinley, though, this
view is unrealistic, as there cannot be
pure evil in the economy and pure
good in human rights.
Kinley's final point was about
making a connection between these
two stances.
"The need to augment leadership
is an issue of engaging global finance
and human rights," Kinley said.
"Here, political leadership is key. Po
litical leadership will push the pri
vate sector leadership, causing there
to be less lip service and more real
service."
"I expected the talk to be all
about corporate responsibility," said
Masako Ichichara, a Stanford stu
dent's spouse and a volunteer with a
human rights program. "But it was
news to me that Kinley's point of
view extends beyond the corporate
economy to shareholders and outside
things."
Linda Kimball, manager of invest
ment responsibility at the University,
asked how discussion might change
perceptions of aid and finances in a
global setting.
"How can we get everyone to rec
ognize philanthropy as a good thing
but furthermore to realize that equity
is key?" she asked.
