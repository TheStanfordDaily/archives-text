## EDITORIAL Barbara Boxer is the clear choice for U.S. Senate 
### 
The editorial board's belief that Bar
bara Boxer will do a better job serv
ing the people of California and this
nation in the U.S. Senate than Carly Fiori
na relies primarily on a review of key poli
cy issues.
On the economy, Sen. Boxer supported
the Toxic Asset Relief Program and Re
covery Act that stabilized the economy
and staved off a repeat of the Great De
pression. She wisely defends her vote by
citing sound academic research from
Princeton economist Alan Blinder and
John McCain's former chief economist,
Mark Zandi. Blinder and Zandi estimate
that these interventions saved 8.5 million
jobs and prevented a 12 percent decline in
GDP. Fiorina, however, has called these
economic policies "a failure."
Instead, Fiorina has proposed an end
less array of tax cuts extending all the
Bush tax cuts, eliminating the estate tax,
temporarily eliminating the payroll tax
and eliminating the capital gains tax for
small business that would leave a stag
gering hole in federal budgets. While some
short-term tax cuts might be wise to stimu
late the economy, Fiorina's promises to
rein in piling deficits and debts have been
rendered utterly implausible by pledges
not to raise any taxes or cut any money
from the defense budget, which even polit
ical science professor Condoleezza Rice
would not oppose reducing. The basic
arithmetic of these contradicting sugges
tions does not add up.
In fairness, Sen. Boxer has not indicated
specific steps to curb long-term fiscal
shortfalls, but she has at least refrained
from painting herself into a corner with
impossible promises. Thus, we hope she
will join with the president in compromis
ing on structural tax and spending adjust
ments while continuing to make the criti
cal investments necessary to revitalize the
economy in the short-term and lay the
foundation for long-run growth. Fiorina

has given no indication that she will follow
through on either of these priorities.
On energy and climate, Sen. Boxer has
followed the CIA and the U.S. military in
calling climate change "one of the very im
portant national security issues we face"
and boldly working to overhaul our na
tion's energy policy, including co-author
ing important proposed legislation with
Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts. We are
disappointed to report that Fiorina, how
ever, has said she is "not sure" about the re
ality of climate change and made a televi
sion commercial deriding worries about
"the weather." It does please us that both
candidates support increased federal fund
ing for clean-energy research and develop
ment, but even in this area, Sen. Boxer has
shown much greater commitment. Addi
tionally, Fiorina has opposed the will of
Californians by supporting offshore oil
drilling on the California coastline, even
after the disastrous Gulf oil spill this sum
mer.
On immigration, Fiorina has reasonably
proposed improved visa and guest worker
programs as well as heightened border se
curity, which the Obama administration is
already working hard to impose, but con
sistently deflected questions on what to do
with the undocumented immigrants al
ready in America. Sen. Boxer supports a
path to legalization.
On social issues, we prefer Sen. Boxer's
support for marriage equality and a wide
variety of LGBT rights to Fiorina's oppo
sition. Similarly, we reject Fiorina's views
on the Second Amendment that tend to
border on extremism, including allowing
suspected terrorists to buy assault
weapons.
On virtually every political issue the
U.S. Senate will vote on in the next six
years, Sen. Boxer will make better choices
than her challenger. Thus, we urge you to
fill out your ballot today and vote in favor
of Sen. Boxer.
