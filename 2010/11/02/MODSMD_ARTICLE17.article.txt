## Nanny Diary 
### Jade Wang 
Recently, my car, which already chirps
inexplicably whenever the engine is
on, has been outfitted with a surpris
ingly enormous car seat in the back, consid
ering its passenger is so little. No, I am not ac
tually a parent, and no, I am not going to com
plain about the state of my car for the entire
column (though any offers to pimp my ride
would not be unwelcome). The car seat has
surprised my infrequent passengers, and as it
turns out, joking, "I'm a mom!" is not good
date fodder. Its presence, though, is neces
sary to my new life as a part-time nanny.
I nanny for several reasons: One, the child is
almost always adorable and entertaining. Two,
I like to remind myself that the world is not
made entirely of people between the ages of
18 and 25. And three, the income supplement
helps me make ends meet. The three lost
evenings a week is sometimes hard to bear, es
pecially when midterms roll around or I want
to go out for dinner with someone who is not
approximately one-seventh my age, but I do
often walk away with some great stories.
Nanny-child and I started our relationship
off poorly. The first time I went to pick him up
from preschool, the sight of my face drove
him into an immediate tantrum. I meekly ap
proached the screaming child, already acute
ly aware of the horrified looks the real moth
ers were giving me, while he resolutely de
manded things I could not give him, primari
ly his mother's presence. My attempts at
soothing him by promising him his parents by
bedtime were completely ignored, with the
exception of making his demands more spe
cific with a screamed, "Now!" punctuating
the end of each. Eventually, the daycare staff
took pity on me and led us into a quiet room

where I could give nanny-child some water
and continue to slowly calm him down. Twen
ty minutes of my best nurturing motions
later, I had finally calmed him down, only to
have a well-meaning woman ask him, "Is that
your mom?" remind him of his troubles and
start him off again. It took me nearly an hour
and a great deal of bribery to convince
nanny-child to allow me to drive him to his
house, and by the time we got there, we were
both so tired that we just sat at the dining
table, eyeing each other warily.
Since that first day, nanny-child and I have
gotten along much better, but his somewhat
recent potty training campaign has proven a
little difficult for us. One memorable night,
he sat in his high chair as I made dinner, alter
natively watching TV and demanding up
dates on the food. He got quiet for a few min
utes, and then, mid-oven-reach, I heard him
scream my name. I hustled over as he com
pleted his thought "I peed!" finding
him in his high chair, dripping a little, and
somehow I managed to maneuver him free
while also holding a hot baking dish. His fa
ther came home just as his son was running
around without pants and I was mopping up
the kitchen, still holding the baking dish. I
meekly held up my food offering and then re
capped the situation, and thankfully, dad
took care of matters from there without
questioning my legitimacy as a provider of
childcare.
The fun stories are always the disaster sto
ries, but really, my time spent with nanny
child is mostly pleasant. I masterfully use his
bird obsession to bring a smile to his face and
convince him to be well-behaved, promising
a Google image search of chickens if he

meets our agreement. He sings songs about
me and flamingos on the car ride home, and
he has come to demand my decadent maca
roni and cheese when I have no time to fuss
over a bechamel. He remembers my car's
name and addresses it properly whenever he
sees it. Occasionally, he still whines, but over
whelmingly, he is cute and happy and surpris
ingly emotionally affirming for a 3-year-old
boy.
