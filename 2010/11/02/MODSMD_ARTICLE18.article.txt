# GIRL YOU KNOW IT'S TRUE
## Halloween Costume Review 
### Jordan Carr 
Halloween just passed, and most of the
people here thought it'd be fun to com
memorate the occasion by dressing up
as a Na'vi or a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle.
Some view this as frivolous, but hey, it beats
fighting the Nazis, which is what people our
age would be stuck doing if it were 1943.Th05e
are so not our generation's problems. Instead,
we have the much more important issues of
debating whether or not a Sarah Palin cos
tume is still appropriate in 2010 (it's not now,
but give it two years and it will be again), or,
God forbid, Napoleon Dynamite or Juno.
Given the grave importance of these issues,
I've compiled a handy list of what was big with
costumes in this, the year 2010.

Vampires
"True Blood," "Twilight" and others have
made vampires popular again, but rest as
sured, they are still terrible or, if you're re
ally into punnery, they suck (ha). Dressing as
The Count says one thing to anyone you may
encounter: "I'm pale and unimaginative. Ah,
ah, ah, ah."

"Jersey Shore"
The MTV documentary series "Jersey
Shore" accurately depicts all those stupid Ital
ians who have funny hair and yell a lot. And
they have stupid nicknames for each other
too. What a bunch of idiots they are! Also, the
Snooki one is short, so if you want to mock
short people and let's be honest, they're
kind of bringing it on themselves she pres
ents an easy way to do that too.

"Mad Men"
You should probably stay away from this. It
will only serve as an uncomfortable reminder
that people regularly and remorselessly in
dulged their basest prejudices back then. For
tunately, such stereotyping is no longer social
ly acceptable in America. As such, it's safer to
stick with the guido costumes.

Skanky Rabbit
Year in, year out, the skanky rabbit (e.g. un
derwear and rabbit ears) makes an appear-

ance. Instead, I would suggest a few other less
cliched options: skanky chef, skanky violinist,
skanky optometrist, skanky lampshade,
skanky farmer, skanky skunk, skanky judge,
skanky hobo, skanky Helen Keller, skanky
scuba diver, skanky Eskimo, skanky Hurri
cane Katrina, skanky candy bar (something
about the wrapper...), skanky bald eagle.

Nostalgia
People always love dressing up as these,
but there's a fine line between nostalgic and
forgotten. Explaining that you're a represen
tative of "The Oregon Trail," "Teenage Mu
tant NinjaTurtles," "Power Rangers" or "Cap
tain Planet" may be easy, but if you come
dressed as a VR Trooper, that might be a little
too obscure.

When in doubt, stick to Disney characters,

except Mickey Mouse, who is creepy, and
Donald Duck, who doesn't wear pants. He
may be an anti-Semitic popsicle,but that Walt
Disney left behind a company that can churn
out loveable characters like it's going out of
style, except Lilo and Stitch. Nobody likes Lilo
or Stitch for some reason.

Presidential Masks
Presidential masks are good, but you know
what's better? Vice presidential masks. Why
not show up to the party as Spiro Agnew, Dan
Quayle or Hubert Horatio Humphrey? And
let's be honest, if you're taking costume advice
from a column in a college newspaper, you
probably don't have the stuff to handle the
pressure that comes with being the number
one guy anyway.

Couples Costumes
It's a well-known fact that the only couples
that dress together on Halloween are the ones
who are destined to fail. You've seen them.
They come as salt and pepper or peanut butter
and jelly. Cumulus cloud and nimbus cloud,
H2 and O. Bonnie and Clyde, Thelma and
Louise. Sadist and masochist, happy girlfriend
and whipped boyfriend.
If you find yourself unwittingly dragged
into one of these costume traps ooh, bonus
idea: one of Lindsay Lohan's characters from
"The Parent Trap" and the other one of Lind
say Lohan's characters from "The Parent
Trap"! —then you may as well dress up as
Michael Jackson and Lisa Marie Presley (or
Michael Jackson and Brooke Shields, or
Michael Jackson and basically anyone other
than Bubbles the Chimp) because odds are
your relationship isn't built to last.

Concept Costume
If your costume is so complex that you
have an explanatory essay pinned to your
chest, then it's probably too confusing. Just put
on a fucking lizard suit like the rest of us and
get on with your life, you self-indulgent prick.
