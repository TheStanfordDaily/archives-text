## PERFECT FALL Lacrosse closes fall season undefeated 
### JACK BLANCHAT CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In its final weekend of the fall, the Stan
ford women's lacrosse team took home
four more wins over Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation (MPSF) foes to com
plete an undefeated fall season. The four
wins stretched the Cardinal's record this
fall to an unblemished 14-0, including 10
straight wins in the last two weekends away
from the Farm.
By knocking off California, UC-Davis
and St. Mary's twice, the Cardinal ended
the fall on a high note.
"We played well, rotated everybody
through the lineups, and we executed our
game plan," said head coach Amy Bokker.
"We felt a good sense of control all week
end."
Bokker said the weekend was a good
one for her team to end the fall season, and
highlighted the Card's excellent offense.
"We scored a ton of fast-break goals, so
that was nice to see," Bokker said. "We felt
like we struggled with our draw controls in
Pennsylvania, so that was something we re
ally focused on this weekend, and our tran
sition game was definitely one of the high
lights of the weekend."
The playday at UC-Davis on Saturday
was the last time the Card would take to the
field before the spring championship sea
son begins in February, so the team will
have plenty of time to prepare for its home
opener against Notre Dame on Feb. 13.
Bokker says that the team is going to con
tinue to work hard to improve on last year's
15-5 season during the winter break.
During the offseason, NCAA rules stip
ulate that a team can have organized activ
ities for eight hours per week and only
two of those hours can be spent actually
playing lacrosse.
Bokker sees the break as an opportuni
ty to prepare physically and mentally in
ways other than just practice,
"We'll continue with small group work
until Thanksgiving," Bokker said. "Some

times we'll do film study, but we'll work on
some of the individual skills like eight-meter
shooting, draw controls, some of that stuff."
The fall season is the equivalent of
Major League Baseball's spring training or
the NFL preseason the games don't
count, but they do matter. Bokker simulta
neously praised her team for its excellent
play and made sure to emphasize that the
team will not rest on its laurels.
"We want to put our best product out on
the field, so I think it's nice to say that we
went undefeated," Bokker said,"But we're
not results-driven during the fall; we're
about accomplishing our small goals.
"The only time that scores were kept
was Saturday at Penn, which was the three
best opponents that we played," she contin
ued. "That weekend showed we have the
team speed to play an up-tempo game and
dictate the pace. That puts us in a good
place heading into the spring."
The spring will bring a schedule that fea
tures games against five opponents that fin
ished in the top 20 last season, including a
road trip to Evanston, 111, to end the regu
lar season against Northwestern, last year's
NCAA runner-up.
Bokker said that the team's travel
schedule this fall put it in good condition to
compete for an NCAA title.
"It gave us a taste of what's going on na
tionally and it gives our players a lot of con
fidence that they can compete with some of
the best teams in the country," Bokker said.
"I'm hoping that confidence will carry over
when we start to have those opponents
here [at Stanford]."
It's a long time before the Card needs to
worry about its next opponent, but the
team and the coach already know how they
are going to approach the season.
"Our preseason focus is about us, we
want to come out hard," Bokker said.
"We'll focus in on the other teams as we get
closer to the season."
