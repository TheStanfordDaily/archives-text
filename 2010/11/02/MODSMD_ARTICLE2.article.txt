## Buildings get new Parisian limestone Science-engineering quad uses French material 
### DANA EDWARDS 
The same type of stone used to build
the Notre Dame Cathedral and the Lou
vre now adorns Stanford's newest build
ings.
Lutetian limestone, a high-quality,
cream-gray stone extracted from quar
ries in the Oise region of France, is the
primary facing material in a dozen new
buildings on campua Those buildings in
clude those in the Science and Engineer
ing Quad, and, most recently, the Lokey
Stem Cell Building that was dedicated
last Wednesday.
The new constructions mark a shift
away from the tan walls and red-tiled
roofs that defined early Stanford archi
tecture. Sandstone gave the Main Quad
and Memorial Church their distinctive
look, which is reminiscent of early Span
ish missiona Now, lutetian limestone,
which is paler in shade and harder to the
touch, has become the modem face of
Stanford's cutting-edge research facili
ties.
Lutetian limestone has long been a
hallmark of classical Parisian architec
ture. In the last decade it has seen resur
gence in popularity, attracting attention
from architects outside of Western Eu
rope and taking its place as the material
of choice and something of a status sym
bol for high-profile celebrities. NBA leg
end Michael Jordan and e√üay founder
Pierre Omidyar are among those who
have chosen to include the stone in their
homes.
The appeal of the stone goes beyond
its aesthetics. In many senses, the lime
stone is structurally superior to sand
stone, which degrades over time and
may require periodic refurbishment.
"The high quality of the stone is at
tributed to its hardness (durability as a
cladding material) and its overall consis
tency in range (color and texture),"
wrote David Lenox, University architect
and director of campus planning, in an e
mail to The Daily. "The fossils that are
embedded in the stone provide a unique
layer of interest as well."
Indeed, some layers of the limestone
contain "coquillages," ancient fossils of
shellfish and other marine invertebrates,
former inhabitants of a shallow sea that
covered northern France 45 million
years ago. While Parisian builders in the
19th century eschewed these portions of
