# Cardinal crushes rival Cal
## 
### BROOKE DAVIS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford women's soccer shut out
unranked California on Saturday and
returns home after three road games
with three victories to its name. The No.
1 Card (16-0-2,7-0-0 Pac-10) also took
down Pac-10 foes Arizona State and
Arizona by identical 3-0 scores last
weekend. Stanford's victory over Cal
kept its streak of 3-0 wins alive with two
goals from senior forward Christen
Press and one from junior forward
Lindsay Taylor.
For the majority of the game, the ball
stayed at Stanford's feet, and the first
goal came in the 19th minute. Press fired
a shot that Cal goalkeeper Emily
Kruger narrowly deflected, and the ball
rolled outside for a corner. Sophomore
defender Courtney Verloo stepped in
to take the corner for Stanford and sent
the ball into the box, where the Cal de
fense attempted a clear. Junior mid
fielder Teresa Noyola was there for the
settle and passed the ball off to Taylor,

GAME NOTES: No. 1 Stanford will face one of
its toughest tests when No. 15 Oregon State
comes to the Farm on Friday. The Beavers
have dropped only one match all season
and are undefeated in the Pac-10. Not only
is Stanford's perfect season on the line Fri
day, but the two teams very well may be
playing for the Pac-10 title.
