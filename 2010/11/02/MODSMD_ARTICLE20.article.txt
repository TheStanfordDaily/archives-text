# Cardinal crushes rival Cal
## 
### BROOKE DAVIS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford women's soccer shut out
unranked California on Saturday and
returns home after three road games
with three victories to its name. The No.
1 Card (16-0-2,7-0-0 Pac-10) also took
down Pac-10 foes Arizona State and
Arizona by identical 3-0 scores last
weekend. Stanford's victory over Cal
kept its streak of 3-0 wins alive with two
goals from senior forward Christen
Press and one from junior forward
Lindsay Taylor.
For the majority of the game, the ball
stayed at Stanford's feet, and the first
goal came in the 19th minute. Press fired
a shot that Cal goalkeeper Emily
Kruger narrowly deflected, and the ball
rolled outside for a corner. Sophomore
defender Courtney Verloo stepped in
to take the corner for Stanford and sent
the ball into the box, where the Cal de
fense attempted a clear. Junior mid
fielder Teresa Noyola was there for the
settle and passed the ball off to Taylor,

GAME NOTES: No. 1 Stanford will face one of
its toughest tests when No. 15 Oregon State
comes to the Farm on Friday. The Beavers
have dropped only one match all season
and are undefeated in the Pac-10. Not only
is Stanford's perfect season on the line Fri

playing for the Pac-10 title.

who put the ball in the back of the net
for the Cardinal's first goal of the game.
As the rivals continued to face off,
Stanford kept high pressure on the
Golden Bears' defense. Minutes after
the first goal, in the 25th minute of play,
redshirt freshman defender Annie
Case fired a throw-in to Press's feet.
Press pounded a shot across the net
into the back right corner to raise Stan
ford's goal count to two.
At the end of the first half, the Car
dinal had outshot Cal 11-2, while Car
dinal freshman goalkeeper Emily
Oliver didn't need to get her hands on
a single save. The Golden Bears were
playing Saturday's game without sen

ior forward Alex Morgan, the team's
leading scorer. For Cal's past three sea
sons, Morgan has held the title of lead
ing scorer, and Cal had to do without
her contributions in Saturday's game
while she played with the United
States national team at the Confeder
ation of North and Central American
and Caribbean Football World Cup
qualifying tournament. Stanford soph
omore defender Alina Garciamendez
played for the Mexican national team
in the same World Cup qualifier.
The second half of play varied
slightly from the first, as the Card con
tinued to pressure Cal's defense with
12 more shots.The Golden Bears final
ly put their shots on goal, and Oliver
made her only two saves of the game.
Even though Oliver didn't make a wild
number of saves on Saturday, her pres
ence is always felt and valued by the
team.

"Emily's a very good goalkeeper,"
said Stanford head coach Paul Rat
cliffe. "Whenever she's asked, she
makes big plays."
In the 87th minute, redshirt fresh
man goalkeeper Aly Gleason subbed
in for Oliver. Gleason's time on the
field during Saturday's game marked
her first minutes of collegiate play.
Just a few minutes before the goal
keeper substitution took place, Chris
ten Press scored the final goal of the
game and her 21st of the season. Press
is second in the Stanford record books
in goals scored in one season, as Kelley
O'Hara still holds the record at 26
goals. Using her speed, Press took ad
vantage of a breakaway and beat
Kruger, putting the ball away in an
open net in the 81st minute of play.
Press had 10 shots in the game, fol
lowed by six from Taylor, whose goal in
the 19th minute was her ninth goal of

mn

the season. Overall, Stanford took a
total of 23 shots and held the Bears to
only five, continuing its 3-0 shutout
streak.
"It was a dominating perform
ance." Ratcliffe said. "The entire team
played well. We had a good marking
on the ball, great goals. It was a top
class performance."
The Cardinal will close regular sea
son play and defend its unbeaten sea
son when it faces both Oregon State
and Oregon this weekend. Last sea
son, Stanford had a perfect record of
25-0 before losing 1-0 to North Caroli
na in the final of the NCAA Tourna
ment.
Stanford will play Oregon State at 8
p.m. on Friday and Oregon at 1 p.m. on
Sunday at Laird Q. Cagan Stadium.
