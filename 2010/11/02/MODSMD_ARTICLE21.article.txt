# CARD SINKS BRONCOS
## 
### DASH DAVIDSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
On Friday night at the Sullivan
Aquatic Center in Santa Clara,
Calif., the Stanford men's water
polo team romped its way to a com
manding 17-6 victory over the
Santa Clara Broncos.

The No. 4 Cardinal, now 10-5
overall and 3-1 in the Mountain Pa
cific Sports Federation (MPSF),
will return to competitive league
play this Saturday against No. 8
Long Beach State. The game will
take place at the Avery Aquatic
Center, just the Cardinal's second
home game of the season.

The No. 11 Broncos (17-10), who
compete in the Western Water Polo
Association (WWPA), were thor
oughly blown out by the surging
Cardinal. Stanford has now won its
past three games, outscoring its op
ponents in that span by a combined
score of 50-18, all against quality
opponents.

The team peaked at the right
time, with four vital league games
remaining before the MPSF Tour
nament at Avery Aquatics Center.
Friday's win over the Broncos
was an offensive onslaught, mainly
courtesy of two of Stanford's most
prodigious scorers, senior utility
Jeffrey Schwimer and junior driver
Jacob Smith. Each scored four
goals, paving the way for the Stan
ford blowout.
Several other players con
tributed heavily to the offense, in
cluding sophomore driver Paul
Rudolph, who scored three times.
Sophomore two-meter Ryan
Brown and senior driver Alex Puli
do scored twice each, and sopho
more drivers Tim Norton and
Porter Kalibus added a goal apiece.
To date, the bulk of Stanford's
scoring has come from experienced
veterans, with talented younger play
ers starting to chip in and contribute.
Santa Clara's six goals were
scored by Stephen Hobbs, James
Case, Marcus Akerland, Joshua
Luebke, Nick Poggetti and Patrick
Weiss. These goals came too late for
the Broncos, who had won nine of
their past 10 games before their
contest against Stanford.
A tag-team in the net anchored
the Stanford defense, a rare occur
rence for the Cardinal, which
boasts one of the country's top
goalies in redshirt junior Brian Pin
gree. With the large lead, head
coach John Vargas put redshirt
freshman Hunter Ploch into the net
for the second half.
Both players performed ad
mirably in their critical role as stop
per, each recording four saves and
letting in three goals.
Stanford came out of the gate
hot on Friday, overwhelming the
Broncos from the beginning with
three unanswered goals in the first
period. This trend has become
rather normal for a Cardinal squad
that has gotten off to quick starts in
several of its recent games.
Stanford will need to be just as
sharp in its final five games of the
season, starting Saturday at home
against Long Beach State.
