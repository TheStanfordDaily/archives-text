# The 						Farm is too good to leave

### Zach Zimmerman Dishing the Rock 
As the Stanford football
community, we treat
head coach Jim Har
baugh like our savior. He
has become a national
icon, and, hate him or love him, he has
completely revolutionized and trans
formed the way this nerddom is
viewed by the American public.
Naturally, his name has been associ
ated with several marquee coaching
vacancies on both the collegiate and
professional levels. The University has
tried to pony up enough for a sizable
extension, but at just over $1.2 million
a year, Harbaugh's annual income is
pennies compared to his associates at
more esteemed programs.
His job has been difficult; taking a
bottom-feeder from irrelevance to the
top 10 while battling infamous aca
demic standards and general apathy is
no easy task. The student body has to
be motivated with arbitrary "points" to
come to conference games, and alums
would rather invest in the linear accel
erator than the offensive line.

Harbaugh
has all the job
security he
needs.

At dinner the other night in Seattle,
after Stanford dismantled Jake Locker
and the Washington Huskies in ar
guably its best game of the season, the
conversation turned to Harbaugh's
chances of staying on the Farm after
this season. A buddy of mine put Jim's
chances of leaving after this season at
80 percent. Eighty.
All things considered, this might
not be that outrageous of an estimate.
We know that Harbaugh's favorite
players (and favorite humans), full
back Owen Marecic and quarterback
Andrew Luck, are unlikely to be on
next year's squad. Lhe loss of two of
America's best playmakers casts an
undeniable shadow on next year's sea
son regardless of the impact of the new
and returning talent. In addition, Har
baugh's recent surge in national atten
tion has thrust him into the top tier of
coaching talents and thus, into the top
tier of coaching candidacy at major
programs.
We know he's competitive. We
know he has ties to Michigan, a pro
gram that would not hesitate to throw
away incumbent coach Rich Ro
driguez for a shot at Jim. And we know
that, despite his public adoration, he's
not particularly high on the Palo Alto
football environment.
With all that said, my question is
this: Why would anyone in his position
want to leave this school?
Let's start with the basics. Har
baugh, as you've probably heard, left
11-1 San Diego to come to 1-11 Stan
ford. In three seasons, he took one of
the worst teams in the nation, churned
out eight wins and booked the Cardi
nal a bowl game for the first time since
2001. This season, at 7-1, Stanford now
ranks among the nation's elite and is a
popular pick as the best one-loss team
in the country.
Simply put, in a profession devoid
of job security, Harbaugh is set for life.
We could churn out four consecutive
five-win seasons and Jim could replace
practice with Pilates, and he would still
have a job. Two straight losing seasons
at Michigan puts you on the hottest of
hot seats and, if fired, relegates you to
coordinator positions for the rest of
your career.
Harbaugh gets to live comfortably
in one of the most desired areas in
America, and his family has access to
all that comes with the Stanford com
munity. More importantly, he can
maintain his privacy, something that is
unheard of in a Michigan-type school
that forces every ounce of a coach's life
into the public eye.
While I am undecided on whether I
agree with the sums of money paid to
athletes and coaches at every level, Har

baugh's current salary is insulting. For a
coach of his stature, he deserves, as far
as the precedent goes, at least two to
three million dollars a year. However,
his current seven-figure deal isn't
chump change, and although Stanford
may be hesitant to shell out the neces
sary cash, the program's boosters, how
ever absent they have been, should be
willing to pick up the slack.
(As a tangent, in relation to the
grossly expensive projects that are
constantly happening around campus,
$l5 million to keep the best thing that
has ever happened to Stanford foot
ball is a worthwhile investment. The
University and its alums are making a
laughable mistake by keeping Har
baugh's salary where it is. I have
friends at home in Florida who didn't
know Stanford had a football team
until this year. I would hope that the
bill payers recognize the benefit of a
strong football program and react ac
cordingly.)
Maybe I'm being cautiously opti

mistic. For all I know, Harbaugh and
Luck have already made up their
minds and have made reservations
for the NFL. Maybe Michigan has al
ready picked out Jim's Ann Arbor es
tate and is waiting for Rodriguez's in
evitable loss to Ohio State to formal
ly make the switch.
But I have hope. Eighty percent is
too high. My gut feeling, as foolish as
it may be, is that Harbaugh fends off
the hordes of potential suitors and
sticks with Stanford. Many variables
need to fall into place for this to hap
pen, but I believe they will.
The Cardinal is Jim Harbaugh's
baby. He has done a miraculous job of
reviving one of the most pathetic and
depressing programs in America.
Stanford is finally developing a re
semblance to a football community
and he sees it. It's not all about the
money if it was, he would have
taken $2O million from the Oakland
Raiders and called it a day.
But this isn't Oakland. This is one
of the greatest places on Earth.
Jim is here for the long haul.
