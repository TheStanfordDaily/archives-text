# STUDENTS SET TO VOTE
## Students prepare for Tuesday's elections with campus efforts 
### KURT CHIRBAS 
Today is Election Day, and for many
student activist groups at Stanford who
have spent the past weeks participating in
campaigns and organizing voter-aware
ness efforts, it's the moment of truth.
Students for a Sustainable Stanford
(SSS), an organization on campus focused
on environmental issues, has been phone
banking twice a week in preparation for
the election since the beginning of Sep
tember.
The group teamed up with CREDO
Action, a company co-founded by Stan
ford lecturer Michael Kieschnick, to speak
out against Proposition 23, which if passed
would suspend pollution control laws until

the unemployment rate falls below 5.5 per
cent for four quarters. A week ago, the
group also started campaigning against
Proposition 26, which would require fees
to be subject to the same two-thirds major
ity requirement in legislature as taxes are.
With the end of the election cycle in
sight, SSS decided to increase its efforts,
holding a four-hour phone-bank each day
since last Friday. Over the course of the
season, the group has shifted its strategy
from educating people about Proposition
23 to reminding people to vote, said Hanni
Hanson 'l3, co-leader of the climate
change subgroup of SSS.
In addition to the phone banks, SSS has
held rallies at Valero gas stations, whose
parent company has been a supporter of
Proposition 23, and created an electronic
voter guide, which gives recommendations
on Propositions 21, 23, 25 and 26 on the
basis of their environmental impacts.

"Every item on the ballot is going to be
a complex issue," SSS co-president Molly
Oshun 'll said, "so our hope is really j ust to
inform voters on the environmental con
cerns of these propositions. The purpose is
not necessarily to demand a vote in one
way or another, but to show the repercus
sions of any given bill."
Alok Vain-Menon 'l3, who leads Stan
ford Students for Queer Liberation, a gay
rights organization on campus, participat
ed in phone banks for a different cause this
election cycle.
On Oct. 14 and Oct. 24, Vain-Menon
held phone banks in conjunction with
Equality California, a statewide gay rights
organization, in support of pro-LGBT can
didates.

groups organized the chalking event on Monday to encourage students to voice their motives for voting in Tuesday's election.
civic engagement, created a voter
guide. The guide was composed of in
formation from the non-partisan
website CaliforniaChoices.org as
well as from the state voter guide
site.
"I know personally when I was
filling out my mail-in ballot, I got to
the proposition section, and there
were a few that were really clear and
I knew exactly I felt about those,"
said SIG director Leah Karlins 'll,
"but there were a few others that I
didn't really know anything about,
and I wasn't sure where I stood, and
it wasn't super easy to find resources
that would explain them in an objec
tive way."
"It was the kind of thing that was

very easy for us to take an hour or so
and put together, but students other
wise may not have done on their
own," Karlins said. "We want people
to feel empowered to make a decision
that really encompasses their own
views."
SIG also participated in a voter
mobilization drive with materials it
received from an organization
called "Trick or Vote," which uses
Halloween as a motivation to re
mind people to vote.
Last Thursday, 12 SIG members
went around to residences to distrib
ute 500 "Trick or Vote" door hangers.
"It may not seem as exciting as
the election two years ago," Karlins
said, "but there's a lot of important
issues at stake, so we wanted to en
courage all students to go out and
vote."
Yesterday, a rally entitled "Why
Vote," run by Stanford Democrats,
Students for Barbara Boxer and var

ious LGBT groups, was held in
White Plaza. Students were enticed
by the promise of a slice of pizza to
write down their personal reason for
voting in chalk on the sidewalk.
Responses included "I vote be
cause I can and my grandparents
couldn't," "I vote for the DREAM
Act," and "I vote because I want a
brighter future."
"A lot of times, when you turn on
the news, everyone tells you why
you should vote or what they think
the important issues are," said Stan
ford Democrats member Sarahi
Constantine Padilla 'll. "But they
might not be important to you.
Everyone has a stake in this elec
tion, so we want to give students the
opportunity to say what's at stake
from them."
