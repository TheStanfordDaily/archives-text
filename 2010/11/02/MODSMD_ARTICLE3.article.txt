# STUDENTS SET TO VOTE
## Students prepare for Tuesday's elections with campus efforts 
### KURT CHIRBAS 
Today is Election Day, and for many
student activist groups at Stanford who
have spent the past weeks participating in
campaigns and organizing voter-aware
ness efforts, it's the moment of truth.
Students for a Sustainable Stanford
(SSS), an organization on campus focused
on environmental issues, has been phone
banking twice a week in preparation for
the election since the beginning of Sep
tember.
The group teamed up with CREDO
Action, a company co-founded by Stan
ford lecturer Michael Kieschnick, to speak
out against Proposition 23, which if passed
would suspend pollution control laws until

the unemployment rate falls below 5.5 per
cent for four quarters. A week ago, the
group also started campaigning against
Proposition 26, which would require fees
to be subject to the same two-thirds major
ity requirement in legislature as taxes are.
With the end of the election cycle in
sight, SSS decided to increase its efforts,
holding a four-hour phone-bank each day
since last Friday. Over the course of the
season, the group has shifted its strategy
from educating people about Proposition
23 to reminding people to vote, said Hanni
Hanson 'l3, co-leader of the climate
change subgroup of SSS.
In addition to the phone banks, SSS has
held rallies at Valero gas stations, whose
parent company has been a supporter of
Proposition 23, and created an electronic
voter guide, which gives recommendations
on Propositions 21, 23, 25 and 26 on the
basis of their environmental impacts.

"Every item on the ballot is going to be
a complex issue," SSS co-president Molly
Oshun 'll said, "so our hope is really j ust to
inform voters on the environmental con
cerns of these propositions. The purpose is
not necessarily to demand a vote in one
way or another, but to show the repercus
sions of any given bill."
Alok Vain-Menon 'l3, who leads Stan
ford Students for Queer Liberation, a gay
rights organization on campus, participat
ed in phone banks for a different cause this
election cycle.
On Oct. 14 and Oct. 24, Vain-Menon
held phone banks in conjunction with
Equality California, a statewide gay rights
organization, in support of pro-LGBT can
didates.
