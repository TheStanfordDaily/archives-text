## Americans in Paris: BOSP students report on strikes Those abroad experience unique aspect of French culture, travel 
### ELLORA ISRANI 
Students studying in Paris with the Bing Overseas
Studies Program this fall are getting an authentic taste of
more than escargot and creme brulee as they live and
work in the midst of strikes that have been disrupting the
country since Oct. 12.
As many as 3.5 million French workers took to the
streets this month to protest proposed pension reforms.
As President Nicolas Sarkozy attempts to negotiate be
tween his people and his Parliament, Stanford students
studying abroad in Paris are maneuvering their own lives
around the chaos

throughout the
city.
Yet students
said their every
day commutes
have not been af
fected as much as
one might expect.

"I have noticed
that the Metro is a
bit more crowded
in the mornings
and afternoons,
but nothing to re-

ally complain about," said Fabiola Camacho 'l2 in an e
mail to The Daily.

Students have, however, noted that parts of the city
have become unsafe. For the first few days of strikes,
protests affected the area around Institut Superieur d'-
Electronique de Paris, or ISEP, where Stanford students
in Paris study. It is located near the major railway station
Montparnasse, which makes it a center for protestors.
"The first day of protests, someone threw a firework
right at me as I was walking past the protest it explod
ed about a meter away from me," wrote Max Markham
'l2 in an e-mail to The Daily.
Airplane and train travel has been more deeply affect-

Ed as many flights and trains out of
Paris have been cancelled. This
caused some scheduling issues in the
students' Bing trip to Savoie, as the
students' departing train was
changed at the last minute. On their
return, they found themselves
crammed into an already overfull
train, but most did not seem to mind.
"Despite those changes, the trip
was still amazing," Camacho said.
"And yesterday we went to the Opera
and due to the strikes there was no
set. We still got to see the opera with
out it, and it was still amazing but we
were missing the set."
Strikes are a fixture of French civic
and political life, prompting much of
the public to take a nonchalant atti
tude toward the disturbances. Stan
ford students are following suit.

"No one here stops taking the
metro or makes drastic changes to
their daily routines just because a few
people have decided to stage a
protest," said Jasmine Rodriguez 'l2
in an e-mail to The Daily. "They just
continue about their normal business
like nothing happened. That's the
same attitude that I have taken to
wards these recent events."
Students have also been surprised
by the efficiency with which the coun
try runs despite the strikes.
"I remember there was a strike in
NYC (where I'm from) one winter
during my high school exams .. .
school was cancelled, people didn't go
to work, it was crazy," Markham said.
"In Paris, people just shrug it off and
continue along in their daily routines.
It's like second nature to them."
The commonality of these strikes
does not, however, imply that they are
accepted or approved by the entire
population. Two of three students in
terviewed noted that their host fami
lies are opposed to the strikes.

"They would also rather pretend
that they are not even happening,"
Rodriguez said of the members of her
host family. "Both of them are not in
favor of the strikes and they don't ex
actly have a positive opinion about
those taking part in them."
Despite the complications they
provoke, the strikes have provided in
sight into a common aspect of French
life. Students and professors alike
agree that the viewpoint provided by
traveling to Paris during the strikes
has been unique.
"Students have witnessed some
thing completely new to them, which
has clearly intrigued them and led to
some interesting discussions, includ
ing in my class on French Politics,"
said Patrick Chamorel, professor of
political science, in an e-mail to The
Daily. "In that sense, it is an enriching
experience culturally and one they
are unlikely to forget."
