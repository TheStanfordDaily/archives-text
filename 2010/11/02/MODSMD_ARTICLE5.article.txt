## Stanford medical project offers flu vaccines at polling places 
### CAITY MONROE DESK EDITOR 
Thanks to a new effort to bring politics and
public health together in an accessible way,
voters on Tuesday will now be able to receive
influenza vaccines and cast their votes in one
convenient trip. School of Medicine faculty
and students have been working with local
government officials to provide free or low

cost vaccines at two polling stations in Palo
Alto and San Jose,

"What's unique about this is people can
vote and not get a vaccine or they can get a vac
cine and not vote," said Walter Newman '74,
clinical faculty advisor to the student-initiated
program. "But we obviously encourage both."
So-called "Vote and Vax" programs have
previously been successful in other locations,
but this particular initiative is the first to come

to the Bay Area as well as the first to be led by
a medical school.

Newman has led an influenza vaccination
program for the past 10 years. He first men
tioned the idea of offering those vaccines at
voting booths to two of his medical students
during the 2008 presidential election season.
At that point, it was too late in the season to
start a local effort, but they quickly started
preparing for the next voting cycle.

"We've really been ramping up for two
years getting ready for Stanford Vote and Vax
on Election Day," Newman said.
By setting up vaccine clinics at these con
venient locations, Stanford faculty and medical
students hope to reach sections of the local
population that they might not be able to help
otherwise.
