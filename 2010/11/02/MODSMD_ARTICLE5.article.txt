## Stanford medical project offers flu vaccines at polling places 
### CAITY MONROE DESK EDITOR 
Thanks to a new effort to bring politics and
public health together in an accessible way,
voters on Tuesday will now be able to receive
influenza vaccines and cast their votes in one
convenient trip. School of Medicine faculty
and students have been working with local
government officials to provide free or low

cost vaccines at two polling stations in Palo
Alto and San Jose,

"What's unique about this is people can
vote and not get a vaccine or they can get a vac
cine and not vote," said Walter Newman '74,
clinical faculty advisor to the student-initiated
program. "But we obviously encourage both."
So-called "Vote and Vax" programs have
previously been successful in other locations,
but this particular initiative is the first to come

to the Bay Area as well as the first to be led by
a medical school.

Newman has led an influenza vaccination
program for the past 10 years. He first men
tioned the idea of offering those vaccines at
voting booths to two of his medical students
during the 2008 presidential election season.
At that point, it was too late in the season to
start a local effort, but they quickly started
preparing for the next voting cycle.

"We've really been ramping up for two
years getting ready for Stanford Vote and Vax
on Election Day," Newman said.
By setting up vaccine clinics at these con
venient locations, Stanford faculty and medical
students hope to reach sections of the local
population that they might not be able to help
otherwise.
"This will be the first time that
Stanford is going to the broader com
munity," said Vote and Vax coordina
tor and medical student Shah Ali. Ali
was one of Newman's original stu
dents who became interested in the
Vote and Vax program.
"We vaccinate at the free clinics,"
Ali said. "But this is us going and
meeting with all sorts of people and
vaccinating them, hopefully."
Ali also said that this type of pro
gram "has a track record," reporting
that research has shown that about
30 percent of people vaccinated by
Vote and Vax at the voting booth
were not vaccinated the previous
year.
Because the effort is new this
year, those involved aren't sure what
to expect on Election Day. Accord
ing to Newman, each polling location

will be equipped with 350 vaccina
tions, which will be distributed until
the stations run out.
"We have no idea how it's going
to be received, how many people will
show up, but whatever happens
we're going to have a good time,"
said Ali, who was especially im
pressed by the cooperative effort
made by the Stanford Medical
School and local Santa Clara County
officials and departments.
"For me what was most interest
ing was the collaborative nature of
this program," Ali said. "We worked
hand in hand with local govern
ment."
The "Vote and Vax" initiative is a
result of cooperation between the
Stanford School of Medicine faculty,
medical students, the Santa Clara
County Flealth Department, the
Santa Clara County Registrar of Vot
ers and the Santa Clara County
Board of Supervisors.
