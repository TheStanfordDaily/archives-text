# CRIME & SAFETY
## Groups fight 'geek factor' to promote bike helmets 
### CAITY MONROE DESK EDITOR 
Students now have an extra incentive to prac
tice better bicycle-safety habits while biking
around campus. Parking & Transportation Ser
vices (P&TS) launched its first bike safety dorm
challenge on Oct. 26 in an effort to encourage
students to pledge to follow the rules of the road
and wear a helmet. The dorm with the highest
percentage of participants in the challenge will
win a bus charter to Tahoe.
"This is the first time we've done this chal
lenge," said Brodie Hamilton, director of P&TS,
"and we really want to get all the undergrads en
gaged in this."
To participate in the challenge, students take
educational quizzes online and pledge to wear
helmets when biking. The challenge will run
through the end of fall quarter and the winner
will be announced on Jan. 5. In an effort to mon
itor these bike safety efforts, "Sprocket Man," a
P&TS character championing bike safety, will
conduct random spot checks.
The challenge is one of Stanford's most re
cent attempts to make bike safety a higher prior

ity among students.
"The University has had a number of ongoing
efforts," Hamilton said, citing NSO outreach,
bike safety classes, dorm road shows and White
Plaza bike registration.
"But trying to get students to wear helmets
has been a real challenge," he said.
"So this idea came up over here and it felt like,
'Well, if we get the dorms involved and provide
them with something that they might really be in
terested in winning, that maybe we could get a lot
of people involved,"' he said.
According to Hamilton, there are approxi
mately 30,000 bikes on campus on any given day.
A significant number of bikers are students,
many of whom do not wear helmets.
"I think wearing a helmet is important but not
enough people do it," said Ganesh Raj Ku
maraguru 'l3, a participant in the bike safety
dorm challenge. "I feel like a lot of people want
to do it but don't because it looks funny."
Hamilton agreed, citing a common reason
students give for not wearing helmets.
"Part of it is the geek factor," Hamilton said.
But Hamilton hopes that the dialogue, collab
orative effort and motivation of inter-dorm com-

petition that the new safety chal
lenge will foster might help to
mitigate students' reserva- /
tions about wearing hel- /
mets.
"If everyone was
wearing a helmel
you wouldn't feel so
geeky," he said.
"Let's get every
one wearing a helmet
and it would be a much
safer environment for every
body."

While the charter bus trip to Tahoe is hopeful
ly a good incentive, those involved with bike safe
ty efforts pointed out that the risks of not wear
ing a helmet should also be a powerful motivator.
Carolyn Simmons' 13, a member of the ASSU
Undergraduate Senate's Student Life, Housing
and Education Committee, is working with the
group to promote better bike safety on campus
as well.
"Most of the senators have personal stories
and most of us know someone ... who has got
ten in a serious crash or been in an accident,"

Simmons said,
i Kumaraguru agreed that the
risks of an accident first motivat
ed him to start wearing a helmet.
Hamilton emphasized the se
h rious consequences of particu
-11 larly bad bike accidents.
/ "Why not protect the most
J] important asset that you have.
.. your brain?" Hamilton said.
"Kids are spending a lot of
I money to come to school at
Stanford and you don't want
to lose it all in one accident."

Citing places with especially high traffic like
the "circle of death" at the southeast corner of
the Main Quad, Simmons also emphasized the
importance of bike safety for anyone on the road
not just bikers.
"When you're biking it's not only about your
safety but its also about everyone else's safety,"
she said. "Because ultimately you're not only en
dangering yourself but also other bikers, other
walkers."
