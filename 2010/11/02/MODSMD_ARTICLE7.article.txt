## Supreme Court to hear Stanford-Roche case 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€” Tyler Brown 
The Supreme Court announced Mon
day it will review a lawsuit between the
University and biotechnology firm Roche
Molecular Systems.The suit will test stand
ing interpretations of the Bayh-Dole Act,
a 1980 intellectual property law, by decid
ing whether a university's right to patents
that arise from federally funded research
can be terminated by the researcher
through a separate agreement with a third
party.

The case stemmed from a licensing
dispute between the University and
Roche over the ownership of patents
used in the company's HIV test kits.
School of Medicine professor Mark
Holodniy developed the technology be
hind the kits. As a researcher at the Uni
versity, patents from his work would nor
mally be automatically assigned to Stan
ford. But because of a contract Holodniy
signed, ownership isn't so clear.
While a postdoctoral fellow at Stan
ford, Holodniy worked at Cetus, an
early biotechnology firm where poly
merase chain reactions (PCR) were
first developed. As a condition of his
employment, he signed an agreement
that assigned the rights to inventions
derived from PCR to Cetus, which has
since been acquired by Roche. The fun
damental technology behind Holod
niy's HIV-detection process is PCR.
Stanford argues that the Bayh-
Dole Act negates any act Holodniy
took that might assign ownership of his
invention to Cetus, making Stanford
the whole owner of the disputed
patents. Roche contends that nothing
in the act permits Stanford to void the
agreement between Holodniy and
Cetus, arguing that the University and
Roche hold dual ownership over the
patents.
Arguments for the case, Board of
Trustees of the Leland Stanford Junior
University v. Roche Molecular Sys
tems, 09-1159, will be heard in the com

ing months and a ruling is expected by
the first half of next year.
