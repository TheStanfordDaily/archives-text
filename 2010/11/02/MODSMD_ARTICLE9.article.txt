### SUZANNE STATHATOS 
With his comfortable
ebony pullover and
his silver hair, James
Campbell Ph.D. 'B9
looks the part of a
typical modern academic.Turns out he
transcends the ordinary professor
he is one of Stanford University's
gems.

() "Jim's a chill dude," said Lantana
resident Lauren Gokey 'l3.
"He's really friendly, inviting and
relatable," Helena Cross 'l3 said.
In addition to serving with his wife
as a Lantana resident fellow, Camp
bell director of the Research Insti
tute for Comparative Studies and
Race and Ethnicity, co-chair of the
Study of Undergraduate Education at
Stanford (SUES) committee, history
professor and family man has had a
long career of research and teaching
that has taken him far and wide, from
his humble roots in Morrison, 111, to
Yale, Stanford, South Africa and back
to the Farm again.
Campbell commented on the fact
that he developed a passion for
African-American race relations de
spite growing up in a small town in the
Midwest with a sparse African-Amer
ican population.
"I often pondered that myself,"
Campbell said, describing two pri
mary influences. The first, he said, was
growing up in the 19605.
"Issues of race entered my con
sciousness through television, mostly,"
he said, recalling the assassination of
Martin Luther King Jr. and the riots of
them '6os.
Campbell recalled landing in De
troit in the winter of 1960 and seeing
the physical damage that resulted
from the social conflict.
"I still have an image in my mind of
seeing square miles of city blocks that
had been burned out," he said.
Challenges of the civil rights move
ment and inquiries about what it
means to be an American became part
of Campbell's consciousness despite
his growing up in what he described as
a rural, "white world." Issues of race

became part of his identity.
Campbell recalls discovering an in
terest in race relations as a child when
he went to a local bookstore that had a
display table with books about race
and African-American history.
"I remember reading 'The Autobi
ography of Malcolm X' when I was 10
or 12," he said. "A lot of the books I use
in my classes now, I read as a kid."
Campbell began to see African-
American history as essential to the
discussion of what it means to be
American. He saw the stories of
African-Americans as part of the cul
ture and history of every American.
Although Campbell studied histo
ry at Yale as an undergraduate, he did
n't specialize in African-American
history until he was a graduate student
at Stanford.
"Coming out of the 19705, African-
American history and the study of
slavery was really one of the most ex
citing fields in U.S. history," he said.
The African Methodist Episcopal
Church, or AME Church, which es
tablished missions in South Africa in
the late 19th and early 20th centuries,
became the subject of Campbell's dis
sertation and first book. Campbell
made his first trip to South Africa
doing research on the topic.
He described living in South Africa
as "transforming."
"For one thing, I met my wife
there," he said. "She was, at the time,
also doing a graduate degree in South
African history. But also, it was an ex
traordinarily dynamic and challenging
time."
In particular, the end of apartheid
and the South African government's
self-declared state of emergency left
an impression on Campbell.
There was a fair amount of vio
lence, he said, but also a lot of hope
that this "crusty, reactionary racial
regime was cracking. ... it was a time
where history felt relevant."
While in South Africa, Campbell
developed a deeper awareness of po
litical power and race. When he came
back to the United States, he found
that his experience in South Africa
conditioned him to look at the United

States differently.
"South Africa offers a very stark
example of the ways in which political
power is deployed to establish and
perpetuate racial advantage," he said.
"And I think much the same thing is
true in the United States; but for a va
riety of reasons it is much harder for us
to see."
"In away South Africa is a sort of
Braille version of a racialized econo
my, a version that even the blind can
see," he added.
In the classroom, Campbell uses
South Africa as a case study to help
students better understand United
States history, the economy and the
United States' relations with the rest
of the world.
After Campbell finished his doc
torate in 1989, he taught at Northwest
ern, Brown and Wits University in Jo
hannesburg. Two years ago, he got an
offer to come back to the Farm, which
he said he was delighted to accept.
Campbell said he embraced the fact
that he "teaches in a department
where the people who are now my col
leagues were the people who 20 years
ago were my teachers."
Beyond the classroom, Campbell
contributes to University life in other
ways. This year, he and his wife took
positions as resident fellows in Lan
tana. Like many other Stanford par
ents, Campbell and his wife recently
became empty nesters.
"The youngest of our three chil
dren went off to school," he said, "and
we filled the empty nest with 108 Stan
ford students."
Although Campbell has devoted
much of his life to his passion for race
relations and African-American stud
ies, his role as a resident fellow reflects
an outside interest in promoting the
well-being of his students.
"It's funny when you're a professor
how much you don't know about
what's actually going on in your uni
versity," he said. "It's interesting to see
at least one more facet about what
Stanford students' lives are like."
