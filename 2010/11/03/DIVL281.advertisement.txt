DEAR STAMFORD COMMUNITY,
On October 31,2010 the collective bargaining agreement expired between
workers and Cardinal Cogen. The workers have been negotiating alongside their
Onion with management in order to come to an agreement.
Cardinal Cogen has been proving the University with power for over 20 years.
Workers have worked around the clock 305 days a year in order to provide our
Stanford community with power. The plant produces approximately 40
megawatts of electricity daily. The Stanford community uses roughly about 00%
of the electricity and the remaining 40% is distributed to Pacific Gas & Electric
(PG&E) through their power grid. In addition Cardinal Cogen provides steam which
is used in the Stanford community for heating.
We ask that you Contact Cardinal Cogen's management 650.725.0433 and tell
them you want Cardinal Cogen to agree to a fair contract for workers.
