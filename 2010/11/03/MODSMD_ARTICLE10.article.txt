## STUDENT GOV'T Senate passes exec spending caps 
### MARGARET RAWSON DESK EDITOR 
The 12th Undergraduate Senate
passed perhaps its most divisive
piece of legislation yet Tuesday
evening, approving a bill authored by
ASSU Executives Angelina Car
dona 'll and Kelsei Wharton 'l2 in
stituting an executive campaign
spending cap of $l,OOO.
The third annual attempt to cap
spending, the bill will become part of
the ASSU joint bylaws and affect
spring 2011 elections if passed this
evening by a two-thirds majority of
the Graduate Student Council.
The bill passed Tuesday with 11
senators in favor, two in opposition
and two abstaining. Senators Rebec
ca Sachs 'l3 and Will Seaton 'l3
voted in opposition while Khaled Al
shawi 'l3 and Carolyn Simmons 'l3
abstained.
Cardona accepted several friend
ly amendments to the bill through
out Tuesday's meeting, most notably
an amendment equating the spend
ing caps for publicly financed and
non-publicly financed slates at
$l,OOO.

The bill's original form capped
spending at $750 for publicly funded
slates and $l,OOO for non-publicly
funded slates.
Under the Cardona-Wharton bill,
slates would have to collect 300 peti
tion signatures, including 100 each
from the undergraduate and gradu
ate student bodies, to be eligible for
public financing â€”an increase of
100 signatures.
Sachs recalled the 1999 ASSU
Constitutional Council case Hartke
v.Young, which resulted in the ruling
that campaign spending restrictions
abridge free speech, violating Article
I, Section 3.2, of the ASSU constitu
tion.
Cardona responded by citing
Flint v. Dennison, a 2007 case in the
U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.
The court ruled against Aaron Flint,
a University of Montana student
who surpassed school campaign
spending limits, stating, "Educational
interests outweigh the free speech in
terests of the students who cam
paigned."

Senator Stewart Macgregor-Den
nis 'l3 questioned current ASSU fi
nancial manager Raj Bhandari about

the auditing process of the itemized
budgets all slates will be required to
submit.
In the face of potential violations,
the financial manager would turn ev
idence over to the solicitors general,
who would present the case to the
ASSU Constitutional Council.
Bhandari outlined the difference
between exhaustive and sample au
diting, saying the former would be
"out of the question."
Cardona acknowledged that
more research is needed about the
auditing processes at peer institu
tions to advise what will occur if
spending violations are suspected.
After a straw poll and further
questioning, the Senate moved to a
roll call vote, passing the bill with 11
senators in favor, slightly over the re
quired two-thirds majority.
After the bill passed, Senator
Robin Perani 'l3 suggested that cam
paign spending caps also be consid
ered for Senate elections.
Following the meeting, Zachary
Warma 'll, a senator last year, not
present for the debate, described the
bill as "a step in the wrong direction."
(Warma is chair of the Daily editori
al board.)
Warma outlined his numerous
concerns for the Senate last Tuesday
when the bill was on previous notice.
When ASSU elections "get more
muddled, the 12th Undergraduate
Senate will have no one but them
selves to thank for it," Warma said.
Warma added that the Constitu
tional Council only has the power to
adjudicate cases concerning the con
stitutionality of actions by members
of ASSU governing bodies, not the
average Stanford student, calling any
other conception "insane." According
to Warma, the Constitutional Council
should deal only with issues concern
ing constitutionality, not elections.

Elections Commissioner Stephen
Trusheim 'l3 said in an e-mail to The
Daily that "Article VI of the Consti
tution ... gives overall authority to
determine whether any type of elec
tion is valid to the [Constitutional
Council]," citing sections 2.D.4 and
2.E.4.
Nominations Commission and Sen
ate Committees
The Senate approved the Nomi
nations Commission's second and
final round of nominees to Universi
ty committees Tuesday, also appoint

ing this year's solicitors general
Adam Adler 'l2, Sam Corrao
Clanon 'l3, Lily Dinh 'l2 and Steve
Morris, Jr.'l2.
The Senate passed a bill yester
day shifting internal committee
membership, following the resigna
tion last week of Senator Ben Jensen
'l2 as deputy chair of the Appropria
tions Committee. Pat Bruny 'l3 will
replace Jensen on the Appropria
tions Committee, while Deputy
Chair Madeline Hawes 'l3 will fill
Bruny's position on the Student Life,
Housing and Education Committee

(SLHE). Jensen will continue to
serve on SLHE only.
Bruny was named internal devel
opment chair for the Senate in a sep
arate bill.
The Senate appointed Lina Hi
dalgo 'l3 to the executive cabinet as
co-director, alongside Hawes, of the
ASSU Leadership Development
Program.
The Senate passed all funding bills
for the evening.
