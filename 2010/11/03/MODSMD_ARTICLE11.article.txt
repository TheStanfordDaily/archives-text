# OPINIONS
## SENT FROM MY IPHONE That's it, California. We're done. 
### Peter McDonald 
Are you serious? Are you serious? Cal
ifornia, are you goddamn serious?
Ever since I've been here, I have had to
endure a constant assault of your smug self
satisfaction, your condescension toward the
Midwest, your assumption that we're what's
wrong with America, your fallacious celebra
tion of California as just "being a little bit
more progressive than the rest of the coun
try" and your embarrassing lack of knowl
edge of American geography. And you know
what? I could almost tolerate it if you guys
would just be consistent and live your princi
ples. But now that you've voted no on Prop.
19, I'm not listening to a word you say.
California always thinks that it has a
trademark on the concept of chill. After all,
California is the place for relaxing, good
music, good times, beautiful nature, not al
ways being in a rush and In-N-Out Burger.
Do I really need to spell out the subtext
here? For the love of God, the official
tourism slogan is "Find Yourself Here." No
one has ever found him/her/perself trolling
through wine country. It's that other sub
stance that promotes the dullness and intro
spection you guys shove down my throat.
The Riverside crew I can understand vot
ing against it. I've been waiting for them to
die for a while, but for anyone who voted no
because it's "a poorly written bill" or for eco
nomic reasons about the price of weed, your
soul and any hope you had of not being an
absolute square is dead. You just couldn't
stop your imaginary grown-up masturbatory
parsing of language or big-picture arguments
to actually think about the injustice that you
know is taking place. Barbara Boxer, the
Chronicle, Humboldt County industry heads
and anyone who's ever enjoyed smoking
marijuana but voted against Prop. 19, you
people are savage hypocrites. When faced
with the chance to make history, you chose to
preserve the rule of law instead.
And I probably don't need to remind you
that currently the law is institutionally racist
and classist. I've seen this one firsthand, hav
ing been to the class they assign South Bay
Area residents who get possession citations.
There were four white people out of 40. A
solid 25 percent were straight-up pulled over
for driving while black/brown. I was by far
the most bourgeois person there, and I went
to an inner-city public high school. And for
you medical chaps, the current club-card sys
tem just helps out the upper-middle class kids
who can afford a questionable referral and
dispensary prices.
Just as bad, I have had to suffer through
years of ignorant, patronizing media cover
age (like the attitude promoted by Tuesday
columnist Jordan Carr) and inane weed- and
smoke-related puns in every news article
about this issue (editorial board, I'm talking
to you), all with the subtext of "Hehe, I can't
believe we're ACTUALLY TALKING
about this." Support for Prop. 19 was never
going "up in smoke", the issues aren't
"sticky," and the voters did not "just say no."
Grow up, people.

Listen, there's a reason that in every impe
rialist country the only readily available in
toxicant was alcohol, which research has just
shown to be the most harmful drag, by the
way. Society's been getting fucked up ever
since it stopped hunting and gathering, but
when your only choices are drunkenness or
sobriety, you end up with historical periods
like Puritanism, the Dark Ages and the 1950s
instead of the Enlightenment, the Jazz Age
and Classical Greece and Rome. It's not a co
incidence.
Maybe finally we could celebrate all our
frequent-smoking heroes who aren't Bob
Marley the same way we celebrate Ernest
Hemingway and Winston Churchill and their
alcoholism. Maybe in this high-powered in
tellectual climate, we could publicly acknowl
edge that weed does not make you stupid. In
fact, it's partially responsible for the best
paper I've ever written. Maybe we could cel
ebrate a model of weed smoking that doesn't
involve Adult Swim and Taco Bell. After all,
it's 40 percent of the goddamn population.
But no, California, you can't see past inflat
ed arguments about workplace regulations
that could easily be corrected, or exaggerated
fears about introducing a drag into society
that's already been introduced into society.
You got rid of affirmative action with a
"Civil Rights bill," you passed Prop. 8, you
created McDonald's, and yet you still want to
position yourself as the land of forward
thinking.
I'll take cold weather over this type of in
tellectual hypocrisy any day. By the way, it's
been decriminalized in Ohio since 1975.
Guess we're not as backwoods as you'd like
us to be.

Any Californians who still want to try and de
fend their state? E-mail petermc@stanford.
edu.

Now that you've
voted no on Prop. 19,
I'm not listening
to a word you say.
