# LOOKING UP
## It's An Every Day Thing 
### Nina M. Chung 
As I write these words, with a sparkling
glass of lemon and Pellegrino at a cafe
off campus, I'm anticipating you read
ing them. Because by the time you do (presum
ably Wednesday), I should be feeling much less
time-pressed than I do right now, what with all
the familiar "important" deadlines front-load
ing my week. This past weekend I was maxing
out on my productivity capacity, and the
amount of completed work arising from my
waking hours was through the roof And, even
with necessary stints of eight-hour nights of
sleep (a full eight often makes me more tired),
I was truly exhausted. I was exhausted... but
not remotely unhappy. I wonder if this situation
is more fortunate than I thought.
On Sunday, I took one of my closest friends
to a favorite bakery of mine (The Prolific
Oven please try their chocolate mocha
cake) that he'd never been to. We were eyeing
the cookies, drinking coffee and talking about
the exhaustion-depression phenomenon. And
about how I ask so many of my friends if
they're happy and all I get is "I mean ..." and
hesitation. And about how for the past sever
al quarters, my friend has felt so lost about
what he's doing here, even though he's doing
all of it, all at once, at breathtaking speed. I've
been thinking a lot about the flawed idea that
basic, everyday joy the kind independent of
what happens or doesn't happen is a neces
sary sacrifice for a hypothetical great post-
Stanford future. I hardly hear it, but I see it on
my classmates' faces: much confusion. Some
are driving themselves toward a future they
aren't sure is what they really want or is worth
the current incurred cost of daily pleasure.
But I don't consider the present-future re
lationship to be a trade-off thing. Feeling all
right isn't contingent on anything outside
yourself, so if you currently don't, you're cer
tainly not guaranteed to later. I have that

strong conviction, because I'm here, living.
And sometimes I study my butt off, but the
quality of my every day is a much bigger deal.
Shouldn't it be?

To that end, while the best days have little
to do with any day's actual events, there are
definitely some small, reliably fabulous things
in my Stanford-related life that I simply must
share. I hereby present it in list form. Take a
piece of it seriously! It's an important list.
6:45 a.m. workout, then 7:30 yoga class
Someone told me that for most, "early" means
... TEN O'CLOCK. I don't know what that
feels like. But before you wave it away, briefly
consider: The machines are gloriously free, the
dumbbells are correctly placed, the mats are
open seas of blue, and the weight machines
have observed an entire sweat-free night. And
with a grand, muscle-toning, hand-standing
yoga finale? Namaste!
Breakfast dates
One of my favorite things in the world. Actu
ally, all meals of the day are optimal potential
rendezvous with my friends. But it's spectacu
lar to start the day with someone who makes
you smile. Meet at the dining hall, the Alumni
Cafe (their $2.95 muesli is divine), Coupa by
Green it doesn't matter. I'm a sentimental
sucker for new beginnings (restarting my
Pokemon Game Boy game was my favorite
part, all 20-something times), and a good
friend is good company for that.
Walking to class
"It takes too much time," right? Yes, that's
what happens when you slow down. The little
known fact is that the biking-walking differ-

ence is worlds apart. While walking, the rate of
chance-encounters with people you haven't
seen in months shoots through the roof. It's
truly novel. I abandoned my bike last winter,
when I found myself collapsing amid my 9-5
schedule, and also got to ditch the mental rush
that accompanied it.
The second, open floor of the Bookstore
Because have you ever looked UP? There is
so much air up there! The slanted ceiling soars
with streams of sheer fabric that brighten the
entire space. I didn't even notice them until I
was cafe-blogging about it. Then, looking
down, you have the greatest view of the huge,
awe-struck tour groups that pour in all the
time. Try studying up there. No outlets means
limited laptop use, and it's refreshing.
The cafes off campus
I'm writing this all at Douce France, one of my
favorite cafes in the area, chatting with a
woman from the Netherlands (after handing
her kids some penguin stickers I had on hand).
You see, the best thing about adventuring off
campus is remembering the world out here
that goes on and on, before, during and after
our finals, deadlines and assignments. Despite
the fact that most of us are driven for the ben
efit of the world, sometimes it's a healthy ben
efit to each of us, personally, to remember
we're free to the world two minutes away, too.

Nina has a mental library full of even more great
little things, and you 're welcome to it all! Meet up
