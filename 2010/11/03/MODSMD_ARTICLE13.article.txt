## What should I do this summer? 
### James Chu 
Between midterms and parties,
applying for summer opportu
nities seems a consideration for
next quarter. However, now in my
final (fifth) year at Stanford, I thought
it worthy to share one hard-earned
lesson: autumn quarter is the perfect
time to think about what's out there.
There's no need to actually apply for
anything just yet. However, being de
liberate about seeking opportunities
can yield a wealth of options, and
you'll be much better connected and
prepared come winter quarter.
Starting now helps you get con
nected. Some of the best opportuni
ties are off the beaten path. Indeed,
especially in the nonprofit sector,
roughly only one out of five jobs or in
ternships is found through resume
submission and formal recruiting.
Your chances of being hired or ac
cepted to a fellowship depend in large
part on your connections. In exploring
your options, you inevitably will con
tact people that will be your future
aides and advocates. But developing
relationships takes time.
Starting now also helps you pre
pare, Scouting around now will allow
you sufficient time to comfortably
apply for desired options. Whatever

you pursue, thinking about your sum
mer before the deadlines start rolling
helps you to avoid the frenzy later and
the potential for taking a job "because
there was nothing else." Especially for
summer fellowships, being able to
plan for deadlines, ask for recommen
dations and develop solid proposals
requires effort comparable to two or
three units so spread out the work!
Finally, you'll definitely want to know
what you want when the winter quar
ter slew of "calls for applications"
starts flooding your inbox. Applying
selectively keeps you sane.
Most importantly, being thought
ful and reflective about your summer
plans at this time of year helps you de
velop personally as well as profession
ally. I seem to be advocating "net
working," but in honesty I'm calling
for the exact opposite: build genuine
relationships with people by learning
what they care about and what drives
them! Don't wait till the last minute to
call people just to ask them for help.
The difference between resume
padding and authenticity is ultimately
in how well you know yourself. But
knowing yourself takes concerted ef
fort and time, A fulfilling summer
placement can be life-changing, but

only if you plan ahead to find the right
fit.
Luckily, there are multiple av
enues to learning about summer op
portunities on campus.
First, actively reach out to friends
who had summer experiences you ad
mire. Human beings love talking
about themselves. Alumni perhaps
some reading this newspaper right
now are generally willing to offer
support if they have time. Professors
are frequently crunched for time but
are almost always willing to help you
have some sense of what you want.
Whether returning from an intern
ship or a public service project, your
friends are likely to have a wealth of
ideas about their experience. Even
ask someone in your class about their
summer experience, and if something
clicks, follow up for coffee! I mean,
there can be other incentives in
volved, especially if they're cute.
Second, several organizations
want to help you. The Career Devel
opment Center has a great job data
base, for starters. Departments fre
quently advertise funding opportuni
ties to conduct summer research
just ask the student affairs staff in the
department. Pre-professional groups

generally have officers or members
who are happy to direct you to oppor
tunities. For example, the new Educa
tion and Society Theme House col
lects education-related opportunities
both on and off campus. The Stanford
Premedical Society can connect you
with research opportunities.
Last, I make especial mention of
fellowship programs on campus. Fel
lowships are designed to give passion
ate students an opportunity to ex
plore a field before they have devel
oped significant skills to be hired. Fur
thermore, if you are cash strapped or
on financial aid (as I am), a fellowship
allows you to explore options that are
otherwise limited to those who can af
ford to volunteer. For example, sum
mer research fellowships frequently
lead to longer-term projects. If you
desire to serve and learn more about
service, I highly recommend the Haas
Center Fellowships, ranging from
LGBT rights and working in Africa to
arts education and curriculum design.
Most participants return with life-al
tering experiences.
In any case, start exploring!
