## Agents and athletes: the concern over cash 
### BILLY GALLAGHER 
With college football's constant
shake-ups, the NFL's endless
drama, early glimpses of the
NHL and NBA seasons and
MLB playoffs underway, mid-
October is always ripe with sporting news and
excitement. This October was no exception, but
it was one much darker sports story that stole the
national spotlight.
"I will never forget the first time I paid a play
er," read the stark black and white Oct. 18 cover
of Sports Illustrated, "Confessions of an Agent."
In the story, Josh Luchs, a former NFL agent,
detailed improper gifts he gave collegiate foot
ball players in an attempt to sign them when they
turned pro. While his tale spanned from 1990 to
2005, recent sanctions like those at USC,Florida
and North Carolina, among others, show the
issue of agents on college campuses is still seri
ous today.
Stanford is home to some of the best athletes
in the country. This fall, the Red Zone has
watched potential NFL first-round pick Andrew
Luck and the No. 13 Cardinal football team
steamroll opponents, and the athletic program
as a whole has won the Directors' Cup for 16
straight years. It is those elite athletes particular
ly in football and men's basketball think
Luck or the Lopez twins who can face pres
sure.
But is there a chance that someday these
years of success and national accolades will be
tainted by ineligibility due to agents and im
proper benefits?
Differences between Stanford and other ath
letic powerhouses may be a factor. Although
Stanford houses an elite group of student-ath
letes, its recruiting process differs from other
schools. While elsewhere, athletes are held to
significantly lower academic standards for ad
mission, Stanford's student-athletes have to fill
out the complete application just like every
other applicant. Furthermore, the Office of Un
dergraduate Admission, not the athletic depart
ment, has final say over whether an athlete is ad
mitted or not.
Aside from the plethora of blatant NCAA vi
olations, Luchs' article raised several valid con
cerns held by collegiate athletes who decided to
accept improper gifts. For example, former USC
receiver R. Jay Soward said he took the pay
ments because USC's scholarship didn't provide
enough money for rent and food. Senior Associ
ate Athletic Director Beth Goode said this is not
as much of a problem here at Stanford.
"Full grant aid under NCAA rules can cover
tuition, room, board, required textbooks and
fees all the standard things," she said.
In addition, the cost of attendance includes
"personal expenses" as calculated by the school
at Stanford, this amount hovers around
$2,000 and a secondary fund can reimburse
students for a variety of expenses, from course
supplies to emergency travel.
But not all student-athletes receive the same
financial benefits. Stanford has around 850 ath
letes, but there are 340 full-scholarship equiva
lents divided among 500 student-athletes. Some
students are here on full rides, others are on par
tial scholarships and some receive no athletic
scholarship money at all.
"What we call 'head count sports' are foot
ball, men's and women's basketball and
women's volleyball," said Associate Athletic Di
rector for Development Karen Recht. "What
'head count sport' means is that [if] you give $1
of scholarship money, it counts for a full [schol
arship]. So you might as well give the athlete the
full ride."

The NCAA determines the maximum
number of scholarships that can be given
in each sport. This equates to 85 full schol
arships for football, 13 for men's basket
ball, 15 for women's basketball and 12 for
women's volleyball. Stanford tends to give
close to whatever the NCAA maximum is,
according to Goode.
Goode said the athletic de
partment advises athletes
before meeting with
agents, and she envi
sions an improved
program with a more
proactive approach
that targets particular
student-athletes
based on their profiles.
"An Andrew Luck i
probably going to be
more attractive to
an agent than
some other
third-string
player who's
probably not
going to get
drafted yet by
the NFL," she
said. "So we
could do more of
a targeted ap
proach instead of
a blanket generic
type education."
She hopes cash
offers do not be
come more at
tractive, even for
less affluent
students, and
that some
personal ex
penses should |
be expected in*
a college set
ting.

"While the resources we provide them with
are pretty comprehensive ... there should be an
expectation that going to college, going away
from home, probably costs anybody something,"
she said. "Hopefully, at least at Stanford ... they
know the resources are available and utilize
them."
The athletic department requires all agents to
register with the compliance department and to
provide their credentials, where they're licensed,
by which organizations they have been ap
proved, and other information.
However, Goode said, there is nothing the
athletic department can do if an agent doesn't
register.
"Once we know about it, we can send them
information saying, 'Here's what our policy is,"'
Goode said. "We haven't taken any steps to offi
cially ban an agent or anything like that if they
don't follow those procedures."
She said NCAA enforcement officials at
Stanford are more concerned with the issue of
agents on campus in the wake of recent scandals
at other schools.
"I would say there's a little heightened
awareness to it in terms of trying to find the av
enues for education and controls," Goode said.
"It obviously tends to go with the ebb and flow
of the student athletes too. Right now we're
blessed to have some pretty amazing student
athletes who have some very legitimate pro
prospects. That's going to have to heighten our

awareness."
This is an especially difficult area to monitor
because a lot can happen that is outside of the
athletic department's watch.
"A runner in the dorm is just something we
can't control, and we hope that through educa
tion and other resources that effect is mini
mized," Goode said. "It's a tough area and it's
tough for students because they're trying to
make ends meet."
She is hopeful that financial support for stu
dent-athletes will become more expansive in the
future, making the temptations of agents and
their improper gifts less relevant in the future.
"I think the NCAA has been doing some new
things," Goode said. "They won't help Stanford
students quite as much right now, but there are
some proposals in the legislative process to pro
vide students-athletes a little more access to uni
versity, federal or state need-based or merit
based scholarships."
"[They're] not necessarily driven by agents in
that type of discussion, just doing what's right,"
she added.
