## RESEARCH Obesity program lowers cholesterol 
### ELLORA ISRANI 
Researchers at the Stanford School of
Medicine and Lucile Packard Children's
Hospital have developed a new health-im
provement program shown to have posi
tive effects on cholesterol levels, diabetes
risk and depression symptoms in obese
African-American girls.
A group of 261 8- to 10-year-old girls
was recruited from Oakland, Calif., all of
whom self-reported as African-Americans
and were obese according to their body
mass index (BMl).They were randomly di
vided into two groups. The experimental
group received daily dance classes at Oak
land community centers and in-home edu
cation programs on reducing television
time, while the control group got a mail-out
health education program. The goal was to
reduce BMI and obesity among the girls.
Although this specific goal was not met,
the benefits of the study relating to choles
terol levels, diabetes and depression seem
promising, especially considering the initial
health of the participants for example,
one in five had high cholesterol at the be
ginning of the study.
"Reducing depression really helped be
cause many of them do live in pretty rough
circumstances in Oakland, so to make them
feel better about themselves, that's a really
good step in the right direction," said co-au
thor Donna Matheson, senior research
scholar at the Stanford Prevention Re
search Center.

Many study participants came from
families of low socioeconomic status, which
created several challenges for the re
searchers.
"Just getting the kids to the dance pro
gram is what really traumatized us," Math
eson said. "They don't have moms that are
going to pick them up after school and drive
them all over." Researchers finally combat
ed the issue by buying a van and transport
ing the girls themselves.
Another obstacle faced was the avail
ability and usability of various community
centers for example, a shooting oc
curred outside one of the centers which
caused the daily dance classes to move loca
tions several times.
According to a press release for the
study, the dance programs were "culturally
relevant to the children participating."
"They were learning about the history
of dance and the important contributions
traditional African dance has made to con
temporary hip-hop dance," said lead au
thor Thomas Robinson in the press release.
The dancers put on several performanc
es for their parents and friends.
"To see the number of parents that
would come out and watch their kids per
form, that was really heartening," Mathe
son said. "That's a really special moment..
. I think they didn't have it as often as many
of the upper SES [socioeconomic status]
communities probably do. I think that
brought real pride in what these kids were
doing."

According to co-author Darrell Wilson,
professor of pediatrics at Lucile Packard
Children's Hospital, future studies could
potentially provide clues as to how these
programs could be implemented effective
ly-
"The goal is to find likely combinations
of interventions that can keep children's
and adolescents' weights under control so
we can avoid some of the complications
that are associated with obesity, specifically
in young adults," Wilson said.
The study, conducted by researchers
from the Stanford Prevention Research
Center and Department of General Pedi
atrics, was conducted over two years. Fund
ing came from the National Institutes of
Health as well as the National Institutes of
Heart, Lung and Blood.
' "The next step in the research is to trans
late the connection between fun and health
promotion to many other settings," said a
press release for the study. "Robinson's
team is now evaluating a variety of 'stealth
interventions' for weight-gain prevention
and control: ways to tap people's intrinsic
motivations to engage in behaviors that
also happen to be healthy."
"You always learn a lot of stuff about
the community," said Matheson. "The good
part is the parents really care ... they feel
proud of their kids. The hard part is the time
and the energy it takes to get them there is
sometimes overwhelming."
