# The 						ethics of quoting Harbaugh
## 
### Kabir Sawhney Follow the Money 
When I sat down to
write this column,
my thoughts initial
ly went straight to
the Giants. After all,
they are a great story, bringing San
Francisco its first World Series champi
onship since the team has been located
in the city.
However, too much has been writ
ten about this band of "castoffs" and
"misfits" by others to justify another
sentimental column from yours truly.
As I scanned Twitter for the latest
trends, I stumbled on a feed from Bob
Condotta, one of the Seattle Times'
correspondents for Washington foot
ball. Condotta linked to a story by a
Seattle Times columnist, Bud Withers,
who quoted Stanford head coach Jim
Harbaugh as part of his story.
Where this gets tricky, however, is
that Harbaugh's words may or may not
have been ethically acceptable to pub
lish.
In postgame press conferences at
Stanford Stadium, the media is not al
lowed into the press conference room
(which is adjacent to the locker room)
until after Harbaugh has finished giv
ing his postgame speech to his team
and the players have had a chance to re
move their pads before coming out for
interviews. This is done so that the team
can have a private moment before
coming out and facing the media, a
right to which it is most certainly enti
tled.
However, at Husky Stadium this
past weekend, the setup was somewhat
different. The media was funneled into
an area next to the basketball arena,
right next to the route the players took
into the locker room. The Stanford
players stopped in an area separated by
a curtain from the press conference
area, where other media members and
I were standing. Harbaugh gave his
postgame speech here, just six feet
away from a slew of cameras, micro
phones and notebooks.
As I stood in the tunnel listening to
that speech, I was gripped by an ethical
dilemma, the first in my time covering
Stanford sports should I record
what was being said and quote Har
baugh afterward as having said it?
While he wasn't terribly inflammatory
I'm fairly certain that, had he known he
was being recorded and was not speak
ing in a private setting, he would have
changed what he said. I chose not to
record the speech, and limited myself
to what Harbaugh and his players said
in the press conference, when they had
full knowledge that they were speaking
"on the record."
However, Withers didn't seem to
wrestle with the same sort of dilemma
that I did. Since he has already pub
lished quotes from Harbaugh's
postgame speech on the website of the
Seattle Times, I will republish those
quotes here; however, I did not publish
them in my original game recap, and
would not have published them unless
they were already "out there."

Here's exactly what was in the col
umn:
"'Dominating!' Harbaugh hooted
at his players. 'We kicked their ass every
which way! One hell of a job on both
sides of the line! Dominant, dominant!'
Then Harbaugh referenced Pete Car
roll, Lane Kiffin, Steve Sarkisian and
the UW head coach's defensive coordi
nator, Nick Holt, and said, 'What are
you guys, 5-1,6-1 against that group (in
his four-year tenure)? That's the high
est-paid coaching staff around!"'
When he was speaking to his team,
Harbaugh did not know he was on the
record, and would likely not have con
sented to being quoted. He was also not
speaking in a public setting. To put it
simply, there are some unwritten rules
by which coaches conduct themselves
when speaking with the media, and one
of them is that you don't publicly belit
tle or degrade your opponent. Even if
you win a game 100-0, you at least have
to make a public show of respect.
It's noteworthy that Harbaugh did
not make similar comments 10 minutes
later, when he came outside to talk to
the microphones; he talked a lot about
his team's great performance, but came
nowhere close to saying. "We kicked
their ass every which way!" That's the
type of talk that's permissible in a lock
er room, but not in front of a micro
phone.
Sarkisian, the Washington head
coach, responded the next day, saying,
"I guess when you win 41-0 you get to
say what you want to say, but I have a
firm belief that the football gods get
you in the end."
Clearly, Sarkisian was unhappy be
cause Harbaugh had broken that un
spoken rule no matter how big you
win, you still must publicly show re
spect for your opponent. It's the same
reason coaches get unhappy and spout
off in press conferences when their op
ponent was "running up the score"; it's
just not very sportsmanlike.
So I don't think Bud Withers acted
ethically in printing those statements
from Jim Harbaugh.Taking statements
that were meant to be private and air
ing them publicly is not respected jour
nalism and breaks the trust that exists
between sportswriters and the athletes
and coaches we cover.
Of course, I suppose it helps that
Withers writes for the Seattle Times
and doesn't have to bother with Har
baugh again for a whole year. Har
baugh knows the Bay Area press corps
that covers his team (including myself),
since it's the same set of correspon
dents at every game and practice; thus,
he could make a reporter's life very dif
ficult if he wanted, by refusing to an
swer that person's questions. However,
a reporter tasked with covering the
Washington football team is not under
any such constraints; the coach doesn't
know who he is, and the reporter (in
this case, Withers) doesn't have to get
quotes from Harbaugh again any time
soon.

what was being said and quote Har
baugh afterward as having said it?
While he wasn't terribly inflammatory
I'm fairly certain that, had he known he
was being recorded and was not speak
ing in a private setting, he would have
changed what he said. I chose not to
record the speech, and limited myself
to what Harbaugh and his players said
in the press conference, when they had
full knowledge that they were speaking
"on the record."
However, Withers didn't seem to
wrestle with the same sort of dilemma
that I did. Since he has already pub
lished quotes from Harbaugh's
postgame speech on the website of the
Seattle Times, I will republish those
quotes here; however, I did not publish
them in my original game recap, and
would not have published them unless
they were already "out there."

Here's exactly what was in the col
umn:
"'Dominating!' Harbaugh hooted
at his players. 'We kicked their ass every
which way! One hell of a job on both
sides of the line! Dominant, dominant!'
Then Harbaugh referenced Pete Car
roll, Lane Kiffin, Steve Sarkisian and
the UW head coach's defensive coordi
nator, Nick Holt, and said, 'What are
you guys, 5-1,6-1 against that group (in
his four-year tenure)? That's the high
est-paid coaching staff around!"'
When he was speaking to his team,
Harbaugh did not know he was on the
record, and would likely not have con
sented to being quoted. He was also not
speaking in a public setting. To put it
simply, there are some unwritten rules
by which coaches conduct themselves
when speaking with the media, and one
of them is that you don't publicly belit
tle or degrade your opponent. Even if
you win a game 100-0, you at least have
to make a public show of respect.
It's noteworthy that Harbaugh did
not make similar comments 10 minutes
later, when he came outside to talk to
the microphones; he talked a lot about
his team's great performance, but came
nowhere close to saying. "We kicked
their ass every which way!" That's the
type of talk that's permissible in a lock
er room, but not in front of a micro
phone.
Sarkisian, the Washington head
coach, responded the next day, saying,
"I guess when you win 41-0 you get to
say what you want to say, but I have a
firm belief that the football gods get
you in the end."
Clearly, Sarkisian was unhappy be
cause Harbaugh had broken that un
spoken rule no matter how big you
win, you still must publicly show re
spect for your opponent. It's the same
reason coaches get unhappy and spout
off in press conferences when their op
ponent was "running up the score"; it's
just not very sportsmanlike.
So I don't think Bud Withers acted
ethically in printing those statements
from Jim Harbaugh.Taking statements
that were meant to be private and air
ing them publicly is not respected jour
nalism and breaks the trust that exists
between sportswriters and the athletes
and coaches we cover.
Of course, I suppose it helps that
Withers writes for the Seattle Times
and doesn't have to bother with Har
baugh again for a whole year. Har
baugh knows the Bay Area press corps
that covers his team (including myself),
since it's the same set of correspon
dents at every game and practice; thus,
he could make a reporter's life very dif
ficult if he wanted, by refusing to an
swer that person's questions. However,
a reporter tasked with covering the
Washington football team is not under
any such constraints; the coach doesn't
know who he is, and the reporter (in
this case, Withers) doesn't have to get
quotes from Harbaugh again any time
soon.
