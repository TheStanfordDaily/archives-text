## Prop. 23 defeated by large margin 
### ELLEN HUET MANAGING EDITOR 
California voters voted down Proposition 23 on
Tuesday night by a sound 61 percent, with half of
precincts reporting at press time.
Proposition 23, largely backed by two Texas oil
companies, Valero and Tesoro, sought to suspend
California's AB 32, which was signed into law in
2006 and requires that state greenhouse gas emis
sion levels decrease to 1990 levels by 2020.
The proposition would have postponed imple
mentation of AB 32's regulations until the
statewide unemployment rate currently 12.4
percent dropped to or below 5.5 percent for
four consecutive quarters.
"It's great that Prop. 23 failed," said public poli
cy professor Joe Nation, who co-authored AB 32
when he was a state assembly member. "It means
California will march forward, not backward."
Nation said that had the proposition prevailed,
it would have set the state back and hurt the morale
of those working for climate and energy change.
Proponents of the proposition argued that the
state's weak economy couldn't handle further reg
ulations on businesses, but Nation said tying the en
vironment to the economy was less than helpful.
"It was the only move they could make," he said.
"They saw the opportunity to blame the economy
on AB 32, but the great irony is that most provi
sions of AB 32 have not yet been implemented."
Proposition 23 was trailing in the polls before Elec
tion Day, and Nation said he was "always confident
that Prop. 23 would fail."
Student sustainability and climate groups on
campus spent the weeks leading up to the election

campaigning against the proposition and helping
with voter registration drives.
"This is a huge win, and we're very excited to
have been a part of the campaign," said Molly
Oshun 'll, co-president of Students for a Sustain
able Stanford. The group participated in phone
banks and voter education, while Stanford Solar
and Wind Energy Project (SWEP) also helped
with voter registration.
Oshun said that California, as the first (
state to have passed and upheld a law like
AB 32, will be viewed as an example by the
rest of the country for its greenhouse gas
regulation.
"There's no question that all eyes will be
on California in the next few vears to see

how it goes," she said.
"California's the only state with legislation to
control CO2 in the future," said SWEP president
John Ten Hoeve, a doctoral student in environmen
tal engineering. "If the proposition had passed, it
would have hindered other states' efforts to enact
similar legislation."
Both Oshun and Ten Hoeve said that Califor
nia's overturn of the proposition was an uplifting
action.
"It's hugely encouraging to see people focus
ing on the environment even in times of econom
ic trouble," Oshun said.
Concerns over the cost of AB 32's implementa
tion aren't without basis, however.
"The fact is, it'll probably cost a bit upfront, but
will benefit the state long-term," Nation said.
