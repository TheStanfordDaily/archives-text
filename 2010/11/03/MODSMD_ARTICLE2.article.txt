Local residents cast their votes Tuesday night at the Palo Alto Buddhist Temple. The temple was one of two polling sites featuring "Vote and Vax," a campaign
spearheaded by the School of Medicine to make influenza vaccinations available to voters on Election Day. Vaccines were sold at-cost for $15 each.
