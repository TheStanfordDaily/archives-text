## Prop. 19 falls short with Calif. voters More than half of voters reject pot legalization 
### BRIANNA PANG STAFF WRITER 
Flopes for recreational marijuana
use went up in smoke on Tuesday after
California voters said no to a ballot
measure seeking the legalization of
marijuana. The measure was defeated
by 54 percent of voters with 80 percent
of precincts reporting early Wednes
day.
Opponents feared passage of the
measure, which would have allowed
local governments to regulate and tax
marijuana use, would have led to a
growing problem with enforcement.
While California voters approved
medical marijuana use in 1996, this
year's proposition would have further
strained the federal government's en

forcement efforts, which the U.S. attor
ney general vowed to uphold.
In a debate sponsored by Stanford
NAACP on campus on Monday night,
proponents of "No on 19" and "Yes on
19" debated the pros and cons of legal
izing marijuana.
"The main argument is principle,"
said Zaki Manian, regional director for
the "Yes on 19" initiative. "And the
main principle is the idea of limited
government."
Arguing that governments should
n't have jurisdiction over personal life
choices, Manian emphasized the "basic
American ideal of liberty."
"What is the government even pro
tecting us from?" Manian said. "It
seems that they're protecting us from a
relatively innocuous drug. They're get
ting a lot of power over our lives without
showing that there's real benefit to us."
Manian said marijuana wasn't nec
essarily harmful.
"Alcohol is probably the most
lethal intoxicant when done in combi
nation with motor vehicles," Manian
said. "Very few substances affect your
brain in this lethal combination. I
wouldn't encourage anyone to drive
while stoned, but most scientific stud
ies have shown that people under the
influence of marijuana are not nearly
as dangerous as people under the influ
ence of alcohol."
Manian argued that too many re
sources were wasted on marijuana of
fenders who "probably needed the
drug to get through the day."

"Legalizing it would make it a con
trollable substance," he said.
Daniel Khalessi 'l3 spoke in oppo
sition to the proposition on the two
person panel. Agreeing on the "rela
tively innocuous effects of marijuana,"
he instead emphasized the conflict it
would present with the federal govern
ment.
Comparing marijuana legalization
and the controversial Arizona immi
gration law, SB 1070, as parallel move
ments, Khalessi looked at the struggle
between state and national power.
"Voting 'yes' on Prop. 19 would
strengthen the people supporting the
Arizona immigration law," Khalessi
said. "It undermines the authority of
the attorney general."
"It would essentially show that Ari
zona's laws would be fine," he added.
But it's important to realize that the
challenge to federal authority that gay
marriages present is distinct from the
Arizona immigration and marijuana
legalization struggles, Khalessi said.
"The difference between gay mar
riages and Arizona and Prop. 19 is that
with Prop. 8, you don't get prosecuted
for it," he said. "It's an unalienable right
that you have or don't have. People
who do marijuana or get caught in the
immigration laws can be thrown in jail,
deported and be actually punished for
it. But, you can't be punished for mar
rying someone of the same sex. You
just can't do it."
Even after the proposition's failure
to pass,"Yes on 19" proponents plan to
contend the issue further.
"The movement doesn't end here,"
Manian said.
