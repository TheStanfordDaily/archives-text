Brown Wins Gubernatorial Race
As of midnight, with 52 percent
of precincts reporting. Brown had
won 52.2 percent of the vote to for
mer e√üay CEO Meg Whitman's

42.9 percent.
Brown will take over from Re
publican Arnold Schwarzenegger,
who won a recall election with 1.3
million votes in 2003. Schwarzeneg
ger's approval rating had dropped
below 30 percent by January of this
year.
Brown, a former California gov
ernor, emphasized his political expe
rience throughout his campaign,
while Whitman focused on her busi
ness prowess.
Brown's win "means that [Cali
fornia voters] are looking for experi
ence and for someone who seems to
be extraordinarily enthusiastic
about winning the job," said Joe Na
tion, professor of public policy at

Stanford and former state assembly
member.
While Whitman made more than
700 campaign appearances and
reached out to minorities, Brown's
attempt to mobilize Democratic vot
ers proved effective.
The California gubernatorial
race marks the most expensive polit
ical campaign to date, with the bulk
of the money poured into advertis
ing. Whitman spent more than $l6O
million on her campaign, of which
$141.5 million was her own, accord
ing to the Los Angeles Times. She ex
ceeded New York Mayor Michael
Bloomberg's personal $lO9 million
investment in his reelection as mayor
in 2009, according to The New York
Times.
Brown raised $32 million in addi
tion to the $2B million labor groups
spent on his behalf, according to the
Los Angeles Times.
Brown will be sworn in on Jan. 3.
He will then begin addressing the es
timated $l9 billion budget deficit,
the state's 12.4 percent unemploy
ment rate and its stagnant economy.
Though Brown claims to be a pro
ponent of education, his influence as
governor is limited.
