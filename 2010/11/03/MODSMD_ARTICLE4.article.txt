### ERIN INMAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Democrats took over Sacramen
to's top spots as Attorney General
Jerry Brown won the California gu
bernatorial race and San Francisco
Mayor Gavin Newsom won the lieu
tenant governor's race. Democrat
Barbara Boxer retained her Senate
seat in a tight race against former FIP
chief executive Carly Fiorina '76, the
Republican nominee.
Brown Wins Gubernatorial Race
As of midnight, with 52 percent
of precincts reporting. Brown had
won 52.2 percent of the vote to for
mer e√üay CEO Meg Whitman's

42.9 percent.
Brown will take over from Re
publican Arnold Schwarzenegger,
who won a recall election with 1.3
million votes in 2003. Schwarzeneg
ger's approval rating had dropped
below 30 percent by January of this
year.
Brown, a former California gov
ernor, emphasized his political expe
rience throughout his campaign,
while Whitman focused on her busi
ness prowess.
Brown's win "means that [Cali
fornia voters] are looking for experi
ence and for someone who seems to
be extraordinarily enthusiastic
about winning the job," said Joe Na
tion, professor of public policy at

Stanford and former state assembly
member.
While Whitman made more than
700 campaign appearances and
reached out to minorities, Brown's
attempt to mobilize Democratic vot
ers proved effective.
The California gubernatorial
race marks the most expensive polit
ical campaign to date, with the bulk
of the money poured into advertis
ing. Whitman spent more than $l6O
million on her campaign, of which
$141.5 million was her own, accord
ing to the Los Angeles Times. She ex
ceeded New York Mayor Michael
Bloomberg's personal $lO9 million
investment in his reelection as mayor
in 2009, according to The New York
Times.
Brown raised $32 million in addi
tion to the $2B million labor groups
spent on his behalf, according to the
Los Angeles Times.
Brown will be sworn in on Jan. 3.
He will then begin addressing the es
timated $l9 billion budget deficit,
the state's 12.4 percent unemploy
ment rate and its stagnant economy.
Though Brown claims to be a pro
ponent of education, his influence as
governor is limited.

"Education is driven as much by
the legislature as by the governor,"
Nation said. "The governor is very im
portant, but only one of 120 voices
there" in Sacramento.
Newsom Is New Lieutenant Governor
With 52 percent of precincts re
porting, San Francisco mayor Gavin
Newsom won 58.9 percent of the vote
over incumbent Abel Maldonado in
the race for lieutenant governor.
Newsom spent $2.4 million in his
campaign, while Maldonado spent
$1.5 million, according to the Califor
nia secretary of state.
Newsom's success coupled with
Brown's can be seen as a shift in the
political climate of California as vot
ers favored the Democrats. Addition
ally, Nation said it could be reflective
of people voting more for a party than
for an individual.
Newsom will leave his mayoral
post in San Francisco, where he was a
major proponent of gay rights. As lieu
tenant governor, his ability to affect
gay rights in California is limited as
the issues are driven more now by the
courts than the legislature or the gov
ernor. Nation said.

Boxer Beats Fiorina for Senate
Barbara Boxer, a three-term Demo-

cratic senator, was
also the projected
winner late Tuesday
over her opponent,
Republican busi
nesswoman Carly
Fiorina'76.

With 52 percent
of precincts report
ing, Boxer won 50.2
percent of votes.

While Fiorina
personally spent $6.5 million on her
campaign, her total expenditure of $l7
million was less than that of Boxer's $26
million.
