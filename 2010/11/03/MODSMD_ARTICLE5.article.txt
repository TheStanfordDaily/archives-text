## GOP takes House, Democrats hold Senate Stanford observers weigh in on future of Obama's agenda 
### MARY ANN TOMAN-MILLER 
Republicans seized control of the House of
Representatives on Tuesday, gaining more than
50 seats, well ahead of the 39 needed for a ma
jority. Although the Democrats retain control of
the Senate, the GOP has captured at least six
seats with gains in Indiana, Arkansas, South

Dakota, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and President
Obama's former Senate seat in Illinois. Repub
licans will now have enough votes to sustain any
filibuster and forestall Obama's legislative
agenda and judicial appointments.
"It was not a good night for the Obama agen
da," said political science professor Gary Segu
ra.
"These elections results were based not so
much on what Obama focused on, but because
his policies were too far to the left," said Greg
Hirshman 'll, editor of The Cardinal Principle.
In a measure of just how vulnerable Democ

ratic incumbents were in the midterm elections,
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada
was in a tight contest that ended with a slim vic
tory over tea party candidate Sharon Angle.
Sen. Russ Feingold, Democrat of Wisconsin and
a three-term incumbent, was defeated by new
comer Republican Ron Johnson. Fifteen-term
incumbent Barney Frank, chairman of the pow
erful House Financial Services Committee and
architect of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street
Reform Act, pre vailed in an unexpectedly tough
challenge in his Massachusetts dis
trict from first-time Republican
candidate Sean Bielat.
Many Democrats, however, re
main hopeful that Obama will con
tinue his agenda despite the power
shift in the House.
"I don't think that the strong
showing by Republicans will signif
icantly change the president's
agenda," said Andy Parker 'll,
president of the Stanford Democ
rats. "He is committed to getting
the economy on track, creating jobs
and taking action on issues such as
climate change and immigration."
Segura predicts that in the com
ing months, "the Republicans will
make the wrong move if they try to
balance the budget during a reces
sion like the Japanese did in the
19905."
Although Republicans have
made the repeal of Patient Protec

tion and Affordable Care Act a key
plank in their "Pledge to America,"
they are unlikely to have the votes
needed in either chamber to over
ride a presidential veto of such a
measure.
"It will be difficult for Republi
cans to repeal 'Obamacare,'" Segu
ra said. "They could try a variety of
procedural mechanisms to defund
it."
A key question to emerge from
these elections is whether Obama
will move more toward the center
as Bill Clinton did in 1995-1996 or
whether the president and Con
gress will be unable to cooperate,
Hirshman said.
In the first of the changes to
come, Rep. John Boehner, Republi
can of Ohio, is slated to replace
Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of Califor
nia, as speaker of the House.
