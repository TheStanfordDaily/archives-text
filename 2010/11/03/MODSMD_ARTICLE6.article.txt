# Campus turns out
## County turnout around 39 percent; local parcel tax and bond measures pass 
### IVY NGUYEN ELLEN HUET 
Campus voters faced long lines at
the Graduate Community Center
(GCC) as hundreds cast their ballot
in Tuesday's election, which saw a de
feat of California Propositions 19
and 23 and a shift in the House of
Representatives to Republican con
trol.
The GCC was the sole voting cen
ter on campus.
"We've been open since 7 and
have had lines since then," said elec
tion clerk Debra Dinatale on Tues
day afternoon.
Albert Tomasso 'l4, a first-time
Santa Clara county voter from Con
necticut, said the large number of
propositions and local measures
made voting difficult.
"It seems like it'd be really easy to
make mistakes," Tomasso said. He
had consulted Web references, but
was "disappointed that campus pub
lications only looked at the bigger
propositions."
Many voters were given provi
sional ballots if they were unsure of
which county they were registered in
and did not appear on the Santa
Clara election roster, according to
elections official Miriam Palm. These
ballots are not immediately counted
on Election Day, but are sent to San
Jose for vetting. All ballots are re
quired by law to be counted and
processed within 28 days. If a voter
who filled out the provisional ballot

is registered in Santa Clara, his or her
vote will be counted.
Provisional ballots from voters
not registered in Santa Clara county,
however, will not be counted. This
measure is taken in order to ensure
that voters are only counted once.
"It's a failsafe against people get
ting counted twice," Palm said. "We
can't be sure they didn't vote in an
other county too."
"Hundreds" of students filled out
provisional ballots, Palm said,
though some misunderstood that
votes can only be cast within the
voter's registered county unless by
mail.
"There was one guy earlier from
Santa Monica," Palm said. "His
vote's just not going to count."
According to the Santa Clara
County voter registrar early Wednes
day morning, county turnout was
about 39 percent.
The following is a summary of key
election results as of press time.
Santa Clara Voters Approve Bonds,
Parcel Taxes
Santa Clara County Measure A
received the necessary two thirds of
votes to pass. The measure imposes a
10-year, $29 tax on parcels in the
county and will generate an estimat
ed $l4 million in funds to support the
county's "Healthy Kids" program,
which provides subsidized health in
surance for low-income children.

Voters also approved Measure B,
which adds $lO to fees associated
with registering a vehicle in Santa
Clara County. Funds generated from
this fee increase will go toward re
pairing and maintaining local streets
and improving traffic flow.
Both Santa Clara County Mea
sure E, which establishes a parcel tax
to support Foothill and De Anza
community colleges, and Measure G,
a bond measure allowing San Jose
City College and Evergreen College
to borrow $268 million, passed. Cali
fornia community colleges have suf
fered large budget cuts in Califor
nia's ongoing budget crisis. De Anza
College, serving roughly 22,000 stu
dents each year, is the largest com
munity college in the area.
Funding Props Pass, Marijuana Fails
Proposition 19, a ballot initiative
that would have made California
the first state to legalize and tax
recreational marijuana consump
tion and production, failed.
Proposition 23 was also voted
down. The proposition would have
suspended AB 32, an act requiring
California to reduce its carbon emis
sions to 1990 levels by 2020, until the
state employment rate dropped to
or below 5.5 percent for four consec
utive quarters.
Voters rejected one tax-related
initiative: Proposition 24, which
would eliminate three business
taxes. Proposition 26, which would
require a two-thirds supermajority
vote in the legislature to pass certain
state or local fees, passed.
Proposition 21, which would
have increased vehicle license fees
by $lB to fund state parks, failed.
California state parks have faced
the threat of reduced funding and
closure in previous years due to
statewide budget cuts.
Proposition 27, which would re
turn the task of redistricting to the
California legislature, failed to pass,
while Proposition 20, which allows
congressional district lines to be re
drawn by a committee, passed.
The residents of a state riddled

by years of budget crises and stalled
state budgets also voted to allow
budget and related legislation to be
passed with a simple majority, rather
than the current two-thirds majori
ty, through Proposition 25. Voters
also approved Proposition 22, which
prohibits state government from
taking designated types of local
funds.
Strong GOP Showing Nationwide
The Republican Party had a
strong showing nationwide Tuesday
night as it gained at least 60 seats in
the House. Local incumbents Mike
Honda, Anna Eshoo and Zoe Lof
gren, all Democrats, were re-elect
ed.
Though the GOP gained six
seats in the Senate, the Democrats
held control of the Senate with at
least 51 seats. Incumbent Democra
tic Sen. Barbara Boxer beat Repub
lican rival Carly Fiorina '76 in Cali
fornia to retain her seat, while long
time Sen. Russ Feingold, Democrat
of Wisconsin, lost to Republican
challenger Ron Johnson. Despite
facing intense criticism for his sup
port of Obama's agenda and predic
tions of failure, Senate Majority
Leader Harry Reid, Democrat of
Nevada, won re-election. In Flori
da, Republican candidate Marco
Rubio won, beating former Gov.
Charlie Crist, who ran as an inde
pendent, and Democrat Kendrick
Meek.
The GOP took the governor's
mansion in 10 states. As of press
time, two potential Democrat pick
ups, Oregon and Connecticut, re
mained too close to call. In New
York, Attorney General Andrew
Cuomo, a Democrat, beat Republi
can opponent Carl Paladino by a
30-point lead.
California saw Democrats re
turn to Sacramento as Attorney
General Jerry Brown beatformcr
e√üay CEO Meg Whitman after a
long, nationally scrutinized cam
paign. San Francisco Mayor Gavin
Newsom, a Democrat, won the lieu
tenant governor's race, defeating
Republican incumbent Abel Mal
donado.
