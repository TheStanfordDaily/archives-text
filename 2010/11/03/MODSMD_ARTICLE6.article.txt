# Campus turns out
## County turnout around 39 percent; local parcel tax and bond measures pass

Campus voters faced long lines at
the Graduate Community Center
(GCC) as hundreds cast their ballot
in Tuesday's election, which saw a de
feat of California Propositions 19
and 23 and a shift in the House of
Representatives to Republican con
trol.
The GCC was the sole voting cen
ter on campus.
"We've been open since 7 and
have had lines since then," said elec
tion clerk Debra Dinatale on Tues
day afternoon.
Albert Tomasso 'l4, a first-time
Santa Clara county voter from Con
necticut, said the large number of
propositions and local measures
made voting difficult.
"It seems like it'd be really easy to
make mistakes," Tomasso said. He
had consulted Web references, but
was "disappointed that campus pub
lications only looked at the bigger
propositions."
Many voters were given provi
sional ballots if they were unsure of
which county they were registered in
and did not appear on the Santa
Clara election roster, according to
elections official Miriam Palm. These
ballots are not immediately counted
on Election Day, but are sent to San
Jose for vetting. All ballots are re
quired by law to be counted and
processed within 28 days. If a voter
who filled out the provisional ballot

is registered in Santa Clara, his or her
vote will be counted.
Provisional ballots from voters
not registered in Santa Clara county,
however, will not be counted. This
measure is taken in order to ensure
that voters are only counted once.
"It's a failsafe against people get
ting counted twice," Palm said. "We
can't be sure they didn't vote in an
other county too."
"Hundreds" of students filled out
provisional ballots, Palm said,
though some misunderstood that
votes can only be cast within the
voter's registered county unless by
mail.
"There was one guy earlier from
Santa Monica," Palm said. "His
vote's just not going to count."
According to the Santa Clara
County voter registrar early Wednes
day morning, county turnout was
about 39 percent.
The following is a summary of key
election results as of press time.
Santa Clara Voters Approve Bonds,
Parcel Taxes
Santa Clara County Measure A
received the necessary two thirds of
votes to pass. The measure imposes a
10-year, $29 tax on parcels in the
county and will generate an estimat
ed $l4 million in funds to support the
county's "Healthy Kids" program,
which provides subsidized health in
surance for low-income children.
