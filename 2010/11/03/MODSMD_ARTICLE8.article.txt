## The
						movies' one-man SYMPHONY 
### ARMINE PILIKIAN 
The curtain falls. The house
lights turn on. From the
Stanford Theatre's front
stage emerges the Mighty
Wurlitzer organ, its
sonorous tunes rising until music
captures the entire room. The music
is at once dreamy and immensely
powerful, so powerful it sounds as if
an entire orchestra were on stage.
But it is only one man, with his swift
gestures and dancing fingers, creat
ing this symphony. The star of the
show is David Hegarty, prolific com
poser and master organist.
Hegarty has worked at the Stan
ford Theatre on University Avenue
for the past 12 years of his career as
a theater organist, playing on Satur
day and Monday nights before and
after the 7:30 show. He is one of
three organists at the Stanford The
atre. For the past 32 years, he has
also played at San Francisco's Cas
tro Theatre these days, he serves
as senior staff organist there, per
forming nightly. He plays more than
400 intermission concerts and
around 30 full-length concerts per
year.
One hour before the regular Sat
urday night movie, Hegarty met me
under the red flashing lights of the
Stanford Theatre's marquee. Seated
upstairs on the theater's couches, he
appeared right at home. Dressed in
an elegant brown suit, with his full
white hair and handsome de
meanor, Hegarty looked ready to
perform.
Hegarty is one of few organists
who specialize in theater music, and
he attributes the reason for his pro
fession to Alfred Hitchcock. At the
beginning of his career as an organ
ist, he concentrated on church organ
performances and religious music,
like most other organ players. Then,
one night while waiting to perform
between shows at the Stanford The
atre, he felt deeply inspired by Mik
los Rozsa's music for Hitchcock's
1945 mystery thriller, "Spellbound,"
and vowed to shift his specialty.
"The older I got and the more I
played for theaters, the more I real
ized that that's where my love was,
the theater," Hegarty said.

The Stanford Theatre is the per
fect environment for Hegarty to ex
plore his passion for musical scores
from celebrated classics. The theater
recreates a Hollywood picture
palace, only screening films from the
1920s to the 19605. It first opened in
1925 and is currently operated by the
Stanford Theatre Foundation, run
by David Woodley Packard.
"I love this theater because
Packard's taste in movies is the same
as mine," Hegarty said. "It's a real
gift to this community to have a the
ater that specializes in classic
movies. The idea is to go back in
time."
The theater attracts Stanford stu
dents, cinema lovers and older gen
erations hoping to recapture the
past.
"My favorite part of this experi
ence is the organ playing," said Carol
Tan 'l3, a member of the Stanford
Film Society. "It's so unexpected,
and so very powerful," Hegar
ty said he hopes to enhance the ex
perience of the screenings by care
fully choosing songs that relate to
the films. On Saturday night, for
Hitchcock's 1946 film "Notorious,"
he played the "Notorious" theme
and a snippet from "Funeral March
of a Marionette," the theme song for
the television series "Alfred Hitch
cock Presents."
"I'm particularly interested in
Hitchcock, so I've written out the
themes to most of his films to try to
set up his films appropriately,"
Hegarty said.
Carving a Niche
The theater organ is unique be
cause it can precisely imitate the
sounds of other musical instruments,
including drums, cymbals, chimes
and wood harps. During the silent
film era (pre-1930), the theater or
ganist played throughout the film,
providing the musical score. But
when "talkies" came along, organists
shifted to performing during inter
mission, which is now Hegarty's spe
cialty. Currently, many theater or
ganists choose to specialize in the
silent era.
"But I start where they leave off
preferring music from symphonic
film scores by the great studio com
posers of Hollywood's golden age,"

Hegarty said.
Since the scores for most films
are not published, Hegarty has to
learn pieces by ear. He watches
movies, absorbs the music and he
keeps a thick notebook of themes
he's sketched for numerous films.
He replays or transforms the music,
often creating elaborate organ suites
to capture mood of the film. Hegar
ty arranges movie themes for con
cert performances and actively re
searches film music.
"I have carved out a unique niche
for myself as a concert organist who
plays music from the movies," he
said.
Hegarty was originally inspired
by his father's passion for music. His
father was a talented musician who
played the trombone in dance
bands, played the guitar and sang.
His father bought him an accordion
at age 7, which Hegarty quickly mas
tered. At age 14, Hegarty decided to
start playing on a home organ, and
he fell in love with it. He majored in
organ performance in college and
later received a master of music de
gree.
Near the completion of his doc
toral degree at the University of
Cincinnati, an editor from Lorenz
Publishing who was impressed with
Hegarty's organ compositions of
fered him a job as a full-time editor
and composer. Hegarty took the job
and served as the editor of The Sa
cred Organ Journal before later
publishing with Broadman Press,
Sheet Music Magazine and Hegarty
Music Press, among others.
