( C Y â–  is a fight about
how we participate
in a revolution," said
Tom Steyer M.B.A.
* 'B3. He spoke on
Oct. 20 at a weekly energy seminar
hosted by Stanford's Woods Institute
for the Environment. That week, grad
uate students interviewed private eq
uity entrepreneur, Stanford trustee
and major donor Steyer, as well as for
mer secretary of state and Hoover In
stitution fellow George Shultz, about
their campaign against Proposition 23.
The measure, which failed in Tues
day's election, would have suspended
the Global Warming Solutions Act of
2006, and opponents said it could have
affected the spread of clean energy in
California.
Weekly energy seminars are but
one of myriad functions the Woods
Institute serves. The institute, founded
in 2004, focuses on interdisciplinary
research with the idea that only by
reaching across multiple disciplines
can environmental challenges be
solved.
"Whatever you want to pick, any of
those major environmental chal
lenges, there's no way you can just...
take the knowledge of one discipline
and apply it and come up with a solu
tion," said Woods co-director Jeff Kos
eff M.S. '7B Ph.D. 'B3. "So our philoso
phy is to bring people together who
have very different backgrounds and
disciplinary knowledge [and] put
them together to solve these prob
lems."
Before the Woods Institute was
founded, Koseff, along with several
other faculty members, felt an auspi
cious absence of a group on campus
that could facilitate communication
and action on environmental work
among departments. Starting in the
early '9os, this small group of faculty
continued to push for such an organi

zation until the University granted
their wish in 2004.
"We'd always felt that we wanted
something at Stanford that transcend
ed the departments that we all had,"
Koseff said. "So we needed some
other entity that could pull the differ
ent departments, departmental or dis
ciplinary knowledge together."
The Woods Institute focuses on
five areas of environmental research:
land use and conservation, fresh
water, climate change and energy,
oceans and estuaries and the human
built environment. The group collabo
rates within and outside of the Univer
sity, and has forged alliances with or
ganizations such as Stanford's Pre
court Energy Efficiency Center, the
Stanford Student Green Fund and the
Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
"A lot of what they're trying to do
is leverage all these incredible intellec
tual capitals that we have here at Stan
ford to solve the world's problems,"
said Woods program manager Leigh
Johnson, "and to do that you need
partners."
Support for Student Research
One of the ways students get in
volved with the institute is by taking
advantage of the student grants
Woods funds.
Ocean biogeochemistry graduate
student Kate Lowry 'lO worked in
conjunction with environmental earth
system science professor Kevin Arri
go this summer on a project funded by
the Woods Institute's Interdiscipli
nary Undergraduate Research Pro
gram. The project took her research
group on a 37-day, NASA-funded
oceanography mission to the Arctic
with 50 other scientists and more than
80 Coast Guard members.
Lowry's group was there to con
duct fieldwork on the ecological im
pacts of melting sea ice through the
Bering Strait and Beaufort and
Chukchi Seas. She helped with the
data collection.
"The Woods Institute helped me

prepare for my research both finan
cially and academically," Lowry said in
an e-mail to The Daily. "With funding
from the Woods Institute, Earth Sys
tems, and the Undergraduate Re
search Program, I was able to pay for
my plane ticket and many of the ex
penses related to conducting field
work in freezing Arctic tempera
tures."
The Institute's Mel Lane Student
Program funds five to six student proj
ects each year. With funding provided
by the family of Mel Lane, a deceased
Woods Institute council member, the
program gives out up to $lO,OOO a
year. Funded projects include last
spring's Future Fest, Sustainable Fash
ion Shows and Stanford Scientific
magazine.
Josh Chan 'll, a human biology
maj or with a concentration in environ
mental change and global health, has
worked with the Woods Institute in a
different capacity. Since this past sum
mer, Chan has been a writing intern at
the institute, combining his science
background with writing. Much of
Chan's work entails broadcasting the
Woods Institute's work to the public.
"We know that there are a whole
bunch of scientists doing good re
search here," Chan said. "But, like my
boss has told me many times, it's not
very useful if it stays with scientific
journals and doesn't get out to the
community."
Through his internship, Chan wit
nessed political and social undertones
to environmental dilemmas as he at
tended clean energy summits and pre
pared briefs for Woods fellows, who
were heading to Washington, D.C. to
speak to senators about the public's
perception of climate change.
"That was actually interesting, be
cause when I signed up for the job I
never really realized how much of a
political aspect there was to Woods,"
Chan said.
