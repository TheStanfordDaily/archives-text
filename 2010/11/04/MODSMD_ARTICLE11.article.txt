## EDITORIAL A 						Palo Alto high-speed rail station: finally, bursting the bubble 
### 
In the fall of 2008, California voters ap
proved Proposition IA, an ambitious
plan to construct a high-speed rail
(HSR) network that would allow passen
gers to make the 432-mile journey from Los
Angeles to San Francisco in a mere two
hours and 38 minutes. The plan calls for one
station in the mid-peninsula, located either
in Palo Alto (near Caltrain), Redwood City
or Mountain View. Construction on the rail
line is set to begin before 2012, but resistance
from mid-peninsula communities threatens
to delay the segment linking San Francisco
with San Jose and the rest of the rail net
work. Mid-peninsula communities cannot
legally stop construction of the rail line, but
they do have a say in where or if a local sta
tion is built.
On Oct. 25, the Palo Alto City Council
voted to tell the California High Speed Rail
authority that it does not want to be consid
ered for a station. The council's concerns
echoed those voiced by Stanford on Sept. 20
when the University claimed that "the city
and its surroundings have very little avail
able traffic and parking capacity for such a
facility ... and a station for HSR would not,
in our view, constitute a priority justifying
further reduction of this limited capacity."
The problems associated with a new parking
garage and heavier local traffic are substan
tial, but compared to the benefits an HSR
station offers, they are insignificant.
The presence of a local HSR station
would allow Palo Alto residents and the
Stanford community eight-minute access to
San Francisco International Airport. This is
a vast improvement over the current system,
which requires two train rides, can take well

over an hour and often confuses infrequent
travelers. The station would also provide 20-
minute trips to downtown San Francisco
and a two hour, 21 minute travel time to Los
Angeles.
Silicon Valley, especially Stanford and
Palo Alto, is having trouble providing hous
ing to workers who cannot afford the high
local real estate prices. An HSR station in
the mid-peninsula would give workers an
other transportation choice and significant
ly reduce the gridlock on Interstate 280 and
Highway 101. More traffic around the sta
tion would be a small price to pay for a fast
alternative to car travel and clearer high
ways to boot.
The HSR station would also provide more
direct economic benefits, such as large in
creases in foot traffic to local businesses and
higher property values downtown. Building
the station elsewhere would shift these bene
fits away from Palo Alto to another city,
which is perfectly reasonable. However, alter
native locations cannot offer easy access to
Stanford for students, tourists and professors.
Redwood City and Mountain View cannot
boast an attraction like Stanford, and neither
city has as much difficulty bringing in workers
as Stanford and Palo Alto.
In our opinion, passing up the opportuni
ty to fully integrate Stanford and Palo Alto
with the rest of California because of fears
that a parking structure will be unsightly or
that there will be more traffic around Uni
versity Avenue is woefully shortsighted. If
we want Stanford and Palo Alto to remain
the region's focal point, all parties involved
should work to make an HSR station near
University Avenue a reality.
