# THE 						CAMPUS BEAT
## Listen Through Others' Ears 
### Lucas Will Johnson 
In the Rally to Restore Sanity last Saturday,
Jon Stewart highlighted the desire shared
by many for more civil and constructive
governmental discourse. He broadcast his
message widely, but proposed few methods to
actually change the culture. My column is usu
ally about music, but I think that if we consid
er identities and divisions in musical tastes, it
can help us think about how to start to manage
political divides when solving problems. In
both music and politics, people could benefit
from active attempts to listen and empathize
outside their comfort zones.
Stanford gives us a solid introduction to
the idea of a pluralistic, diverse, artistic com
munity with events like FACES at orienta
tion. We at least begin by acknowledging the
excitement of having disparate music, like
the contrast of Taiko to Calypso. But as we
set up our schedules, it's easy to get into a
routine that doesn't involve exposure to as
much musical variety. With politics, we don't
begin with nearly as much diversity: I've
heard several conservatives lament the
heavy liberal leanings of most of the student
population.
At the same time, when filling out forms
before freshman year, we're asked to rank
our music preferences, because music is (for
some reason) allowed to be a deal-breaker
between roommates. They don't ask about
what kind of posters you might hang up or
what clothes you wear. Music is the impor
tant aesthetic, apparently. We aren't asked
about politics, though, because that's a diver
sity they have to try to encourage.
So why should we be wedded to our music
tastes so strongly? How do they develop any
ways? Middle and high school teach us that
some types of music are "cool," depending on
which people you were friends with or which
gender you are. Identities are formed around
the bands we listen to. In college or later,
your friends might introduce you to a new
style, but there's a reason our parents listen
mostly to oldies. Politics we usually inherit
from our families, though sometimes we ex
plore on our own through academics, politi
cal student groups or internships, all of which
help flesh out our ideas a bit more. But many
people, in college and in life, take what they
were given and don't dig too deeply.
That's because it takes effort to seek out
different music or perspectives. Sometimes
you might bump into them accidentally, but
then it's up to you to actually listen. And I

don't mean that you should sit there politely
and let the music play or the person talk. Nor
am I advocating for debate, full of point,
counterpoint and conflict.
I'm talking about empathy. Take country
music, for example. Dozens of times I've
heard people say, "I like most types of music
... but not country. I HATE country." The
genre is popular enough to have its own TV
channel, so clearly it's not bad music. The
people who complain about it just as often
listen to other types of pop or rock of the
same performance quality. I think the differ
ence is cultural. People don't always under
stand music from lifestyles they don't con
nect with. Some love screamo and hate jazz.
Others can't stand hard-core rap but cry at
operas. When it's not your community, you
don't like it.
Politics are similar there's a lack of em
pathy on all sides. People have different opin
ions, often for mostly cultural reasons. Take
the usual example of guns: the culture of
recreational hunting and personal self-de
fense in rural areas doesn't mesh with an
urban lifestyle that includes gangs instead of
game. Unless people think through the other
side's perspective, we get conflict instead of
understanding or reasonable compromise.
This isn't a new idea. We've all heard the
aphorism about walking around in another
person's shoes. But how often do we actually
do that? It's all too easy to live in your group
of like-minded friends, read your partisan
news sources and listen to the music you like.
What I suggest, then, as a means of prac
ticing what Jon Stewart and his crowd were
asking for, is to use music as away to better
understand and cooperate with others. Pick a
genre you never listen to and give it a chance
for an hour or two. Don't be embarrassed ei
ther if you fall in love with musicals, for
example, go ahead and crank it up, singing
along. And if you're already a music explorer
with eclectic taste because you enjoy the aes
thetic variety, listen for the culture and poli
tics associated with the art. Otherwise, we
creatures of habit will remain in our ways,
only occasionally bumping into new sounds
or thoughts.
