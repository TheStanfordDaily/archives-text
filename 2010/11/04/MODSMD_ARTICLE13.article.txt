# THIS COLUMN IS IRONIC
## Party On, Shane 
### Shane Savitsky 
I've had a revelation over these past few
months: I think I'm getting old. I'm not
quite sure when I started to figure this
out. Maybe it was this summer when I wore a
shirt and tie to work every day. Perhaps it was
the first time I got really excited by the
check-scanning feature on the Wells Fargo
ATMs. Or it could have been the first time I
heard "Whip My Hair." Most likely, though,
it was this past weekend at Synergy's Hal
loween party. As I stood on that packed
sweaty dance floor dressed as serial killer ex
traordinaire Dexter Morgan, a thought
crossed my mind: "I can't do this anymore."
I'm over the Stanford party scene. There. I
said it.
(Your first response to that statement
may have been, "What Stanford party
scene?" If so, please stop reading this column
immediately. You, sir, are a true bastion of wit
and hilarity. That joke has certainly never
been uttered before about the social scene on
this campus, and you will find no humor in
this cliched humor column. Seriously, go
write for SNL or something. That's truly
groundbreaking comedy these days.)
The first years of my Stanford career were
a wonderful and carefree time. The clarion
call of Kesha's "TiK ToK" ringing through
the houses of the Bromuda Triangle would
beckon me to the dance floor like a call to
prayer echoing across the minarets of Mecca.
I treated every Cafe Night at French House
like it was my Last Supper only without
the bread and impending crucifixions. One of
my best friends, who attends Macalester Col
lege in St. Paul, Minn., graced me with a visit
near the end of freshman year. Honestly, the
thought of her school horrified me. She did
n't know what a party was! The fact that she
attended college in the tundra notwithstand
ing, her poor liberal arts college actually
lacked frats. I had to show her a good time,

and off we went to what was then called
Kappa Sig's Luau Party. She had to go. How
would she ever learn to brocialize otherwise?
In my mind, she was a lost soul.
Yet, at the time, I was the lost soul. I feel
like everyone goes through that period dur
ing freshman year. Stanford culture doesn't
help things either. Like China did to the
Dalai Lama, we upperclassmen exile fresh
men to all-campus parties. That's because we
know better. We know that low-key socializa
tion with real conversation is the way to actu
ally have fun here. As you spend more time at

Stanford, you realize that the smaller events
end up being the most memorable: your best
friend's birthday, the party with whatever
group you happen to belong to or just im
promptu dorm room ragers. In addition,
there's also the best invention ever created at
Stanford. (The Internet doesn't count. We
only partly helped to create that.) You know
what I'm talking about: special dinner. If
freshmen are our Dalai Lama at Stanford,
then special dinner is the upperclassmen
Tibet.

Today, the tap of Keystone Light at Kappa
Sig runs drier than the Sahara. Some fresh
men shed a tear, but I couldn't care less. I can
blast "Like a G6" to deafening levels in my
own room. (In a purely ironic sense, of
course. I wouldn't be caught dead with that in
my iTunes library.) I might be over the Stan
ford party scene, but that doesn't mean I'm
done having fun at Stanford. There are plen
ty of ridiculous times to be had; you just have
to know where to look. And trust me, it's not
the Bromuda Triangle.
Honestly, these days I'd rather curl up
with my girlfriend for a nice Saturday night
in. I'm so beat from the week that running
across campus doesn't seem like the most fun
anyway. Plus, actual conversation can be had.
We can catch up on each other's lives in the
midst of a slew of midterms, papers and
events. I'll probably be forced to watch some
Hugh Grant romantic comedy, but we all
have to take one for the team, right?
Okay, fine. You just caught me in a lie. I'd
probably demand that we pick the Hugh
Grant movie on Netflix. (Seriously though,
have you seen "Love Actually?")
See? I told you I was getting old.

If Shane makes you feel like you're living a
teenage dream, then you should definitely e
mail him at savitsky@stanford.edu.
