## Mao Don't Live Here No Mo

£ £ eida xi men." In theory, after you
I—£ have said those words, your Bei
-L-Jjing taxi driver should nod his
head and begin driving. If said incorrectly, as
I managed to do every single time I get in a
taxi, a more precise "Beijing daxue" should
do the trick. "Beijing daxue" translates to
Beijing University or Peking University,
which is where the Stanford Beijing Over
seas Program is based. Think of PKU as the
Stanford University of China, if Stanford was
unquestionably the best college in the Unit
ed States. (Awkward pause.)
As I've learned over the past six weeks,
Beijing is less Chinese than it is cosmopoli
tan. Although a portrait of Mao will still greet
you as you enter the Forbidden City, the
shops of Sanlitun or the towers of eastern
Beijing's Central Business District could be
found in anyone's London, New York or
Paris. The changes that China has gone
through over the past 30 years have been
transformative, and PKU's proximity to
Zhongguancun, China's Silicon Valley, al
lows you to engage in that experience.
Outside of Beijing is a bit of a different
story. Instead of getting a reprieve before the
madness that is weeks nine and 10 of fall
quarter finals preparation, our Thanksgiving
break occurs during China's National Holi
day, which falls during a standard week two.
So after three days of hanyu (Chinese), a
group of Stanford students flew down to
Chengdu in Sichuan province and my limited
language skills were put to the test. As I start
ed walking around the Chengdu Research
Base of Giant Panda Breeding, a Chinese
man approached me and motioned to his
camera. Even though toddler pandas were
frolicking right before us, I turned around,
put on my best smile, listened for the one
two-three before the photo, and then
promptly turned away.
It turns out that this photo would be the
first of more than 30 that were going to be
taken of me that week. The most egregious
ask occurred when a middle-aged woman

gestured for a picture at the feet of a 233-foot
Buddha cut out of a cliff in Leshan. While it
might be reasonable to assume I was more
youthful and arguably better looking than
the 1,000-year-old Buddha, I was still taken
aback by people's attention to my foreign
ness. Even though I knew I was African-
American in a nation that is almost entirely
Han Chinese, it still was a little unnerving at
first to be treated as some sort of attraction
worthy of awe or amusement.
Those first few weeks in China, I could not
overcome my overt feeling of different-ness.
In my United States life, I almost pride my
self on not looking uneasy when I am in pub
lic places. In China, however, I felt it did not
matter if I looked relaxed or confused be
cause my blackness made me stand out. I
made it a habit to walk around Beida with
Stanford friends, or I would throw on my
hoodie with headphones jammed in my ears.
I found myself blocking out what I thought
was an uncomfortable experience.
Nevertheless, I began to realize my feel
ings of different-ness were shared by every
one who has experienced China after grow
ing up in another culture. Although my race
might have made me feel more out of place
than others, ultimately it was I, not the stares
of the Chinese people, who defined how
those differences affected my experience.
My performance of disinterest with my head
phones, hoodie and Stanford block of friends
protected me from my own assumptions
more than it did the assumptions of those
Chinese people I passed. Once I let myself
get immersed in all that China had to offer, I
started to more fully appreciate my time
abroad.
And it has been a fantastic time. In China
I have played with the pandas in Chengdu,
sung on rolling hills of Inner Mongolia (cour
tesy of Dr. Peter and Mrs. Helen Bing) and
hiked backward the 3,000 steps of the Tai
Mountains where Confucius chilled. A Bei
jing-sized amount of time has been given to
the study of the Chinese language. Fortu-

nately, I have a wonderful PKU language
partner, Zhi Li, who has taken four hours out
of her six-day, nine-class school week (which
is the norm at PKU) to help me learn the lan
guage. Somewhere in between all that, 1 have
also been able to have substantive conversa
tions with people about the role of the Chi
nese Communist Party in everyday life, high
lighted by conversations about Liu Xiaobo's
Nobel Peace Prize,
Even though words like "billion" and
"communist" normally come to mind when
China is invoked in various efforts to demon
strate the country's different-ness, I've found
that China is a far more familiar place than
you would expect.
So I stand as a testament to that story of a
foreigner, lost in a new world, who subse
quently loses and finds himself. Maybe
cliche, but not bad for week-six introspec
tion.
