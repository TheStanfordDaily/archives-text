## Football questions linger 
### Jacob Jaffe Fields of Failure 
This is the big one. The first
ever meeting with both teams
ranked. An outside chance at
a Pac-10 title and a shot at
BCS eligibility hang in the
balance. It's the biggest remaining ob
stacle between the Cardinal and an 11-
win season. ABC is airing the game in
primetime, with its top team of Brent
Musberger, Kirk Herbstreit and Erin
Andrews on hand. The winner will like
ly jump into the top 10, while the loser
must aim for the Alamo or Holiday
Bowl.
Yet in a sense, Stanford and Arizona
still bring major question marks into
Saturday's top-15 clash.
Sure, both the Cardinal and the Wild
cats are ranked in the top 13 in both the
polls and the computers. Sure, the teams
are led by two of the nation's top quar
terbacks. Sure, Stanford has already
matched up with the No. 1 team in the
country, holding a first-half lead in
Autzen Stadium and making Oregon
sweat much more than the final 21 -point
margin would indicate. Sure, Arizona
owns one of the biggest nonconference
wins in the country, a thrilling seven
point win over then-No. 9 lowa.
But in many ways, both teams have a
lot to prove. Consider the most talked
about matchup of the game: Stanford's
high-powered offense against Arizona's
stingy defense.
The basic statistics touted by most
analysts paint this battle as a clash of the
titans. The Cardinal offense ranks fifth in
the country in scoring, averaging over 42
points per game, while the Wildcats rank
seventh in scoring defense, allowing
fewer than 15 points per game. As the
saying goes, something's gotta give.
Looking at the schedule, though, nei
ther the Stanford O nor the Arizona D
has been remotely challenged in most of
its contests. Among the Cardinal's first
seven opponents (disregarding FCS
Sacramento State), only one ranks in the
top half of the country in scoring de
fense. That one was Oregon, which shut
Stanford out in the second half after the
Cardinal jumped out to an 18-point first
half lead. Meanwhile, Stanford racked
up points against Wake Forest, Washing
ton State and Washington, who all sit in
the bottom 15 nationally in points al
lowed.
This same phenomenon has influ
enced Arizona's statistics. The Wildcats
have faced four opponents (other than
FCS Citadel) ranked worse than 75th in
scoring offense, allowing only 11 points
per game to them. On the other hand,
Arizona has faced three decent offenses
Cal, Oregon State and lowa. The
Wildcats held Cal to only nine points,
but the Golden Bears have been
abysmal on the road this season, losing
all four games away from Memorial Sta
dium.The other two had relative success
against Arizona's defense, scoring at
least 27 points in each game.
Now, no reasonable college football
fan would say that Stanford has a poor
offense or that Arizona has a poor de
fense, Each unit will likely be the tough
est test the other has faced this season.
But neither unit has been able to consis
tently perform against a strong oppo
nent, which is what makes this matchup
so intriguing.
Apart from this facet, Saturday's
showdown could expose more untested
areas of each team. The Wildcats will be
facing their first real road test of the year.
Coming in, the only games Arizona has
played away from home have been
against Toledo, Washington State and
UCLA. While the Rockets have done
well in MAC play, they were two-touch
down underdogs to Arizona, and the
Cougars and Bruins have set up shop in
the Pac-10 cellar. Stanford represents a
significant step up in competition level.
Overall, Arizona has played five Pac
-10 opponents, including the bottom four
teams in the conference. The only win
ning conference team the Wildcats have
played is Oregon State, and the Beavers
beat Arizona in Tucson. The Wildcats
have ascended to the top 15 without
playing Oregon, Stanford or USC, so
their true ability remains in question.
Meanwhile, Stanford has played
only two teams with winning records,
losing to Oregon and squeaking out a
victory over USC at home. Arizona is
on a different level than the Trojans, so
the Cardinal will certainly need to step
up its play to contend with the Wild
cats.

In addition, both teams have to
deal with their own internal question
marks. Stanford's defense has been in
credibly inconsistent see: two road
shutouts in Pac-10 play, but 38.3 points
per game allowed in a three-game
stretch against Oregon, USC and
Washington State. The performance of
the Cardinal defense, particularly
against the pass, could be the deciding
factor on Saturday night. Arizona has
its own uncertainty at quarterback,
where starter Nick Foles has been
sidelined by a knee injury for the past
few weeks. Backup Matt Scott has per
formed admirably in his absence, but
the Wildcats will need their best offen
sive effort to keep up with Andrew
Luck and the Stanford offense.

For both teams, the spotlight and
pressure are relatively new phenome
na. Arizona has never made the Rose
Bowl, while Stanford's players were still
in elementary school the last time the
Cardinal smelled roses. Ffowever, both
Mike Stoops and Jim Harbaugh have
changed the attitudes at their respective
schools, and both teams figure to be up
for the challenge.
The hype about Arizona-Stanford
will be all about the strengths of both
teams, but it will be each team's weak
nesses, and its ability to improve on
them, that will decide this one.
