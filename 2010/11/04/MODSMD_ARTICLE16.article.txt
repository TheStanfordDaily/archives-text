# FINAL TEST AWAITS
## 
### NATE ADAMS DESK EDITOR 
For all the success that Stanford has en
joyed this year, there's one team that's kept
pace with the No. 1 Cardinal throughout Pac
-10 play. Oregon State has been perfect
through seven conference games, stretching
its overall record to 15-1-1 and its national
ranking to No. 13.
The Stanford women's soccer team (16-0-
2, 7-0-0 Pac-10) remains undefeated and
stands as the nation's unanimous No. 1 team,
which means it will be playing the Beavers in
a de facto conference championship game on
Friday night.
The Cardinal will also host Oregon (7-8-3,
3-3-1) this weekend to wrap up its regular
season.

Friday's game represents the first oppor
tunity for Oregon State's program to win a
Pac-10 title, and it has certainly earned that
chance. Under head coach Linus Rhode, the
Beavers have enjoyed a banner season, par
ticularly on the defensive side. Their only loss
came in a 1-0 match against now-No. 11 UC-
Irvine, and through 17 games the defense, an
chored by junior goalkeeper Colleen Boyd,
has allowed only seven goals. The Cardinal,
backstopped by freshman keeper Emily Oliv
er, has allowed 10 goals through 18 games.
Perhaps the most remarkable thing about
the Beavers' season is how much of a turn
around it is from only a few years ago. Oregon
State posted a combined 2-22-3 record in the
Pac-10 from 2006-08, and after leading his
team to the third round of the NCAA Tour
nament last season, Rhode has this year's
squad in position to do even better.
"Linus has done an incredible job," re
marked Stanford head coach Paul Ratcliffe.
"Last year they were also an exceptional
team, and I can't say enough about how much
respect I have for Linus and his program.
We're excited to play them."
Some of Stanford's more talented oppo
nents this season, like Santa Clara and Wash
ington, have taken a conservative approach
on offense against the Cardinal, focusing on
minimizing the goals they allow rather than
attacking. The Beavers' main strength is cer
tainly their defense, but Ratcliffe thinks the
Oregon State squad is talented enough to

come after the Cardinal with a balanced ap
proach.
"Linus is a smart coach, so I think they'll
play with a very organized system," Ratcliffe
said. "But I also think they have players that
can come after you and try to score. So they'll
open up at times and try to score goals, but
they'll also be very organized and stay togeth
er as a unit."
When the Beavers do attack, forward
Chelsea Buckland is usually their leader. The
redshirt sophomore leads her team with 18
points on eight goals and two assists.
Stanford, meanwhile, boasts the nation's
best scorer in senior Christen Press, who has
found the net 21 times this season and has
scored at least a point in all but one of Stan
ford's matches. Press, a candidate for the Her
mann Trophy, has nine game-winning goals
this season alone. Another player to watch
this weekend is Lindsay Taylor the junior
forward has scored in each of the Cardinal's
past five games, increasing her season goal
total to nine.

Of course, the Beavers aren't the only
team from Oregon that will be visiting this
weekend. The Ducks are having somewhat of

son, going from a 1-8 conference
record in 2009 to a much-improved
3-3-1 mark this season, good for fifth

weekend.They're also riding a three
game winning streak, with victories
coming against Washington State
and the Arizona schools. The Ducks
are anchored on offense by scoring

Oregon may be an improved
squad, but it has a lot of history to

Cardinal on its home turf. When

outscored the Ducks 17-0 in six
matches.
Stanford will kick off the season's
final series on Friday night, when it
