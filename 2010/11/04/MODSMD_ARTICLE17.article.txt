## Wrestling set to host outdoor dual 
### â€” Kabir Sawhney 
The Stanford wrestling team will open its
season with the first outdoor dual meet in
program history this Sunday at 3 p.m. Only a
small number of matches have been held out
doors in NCAA history, as wrestling is a win
ter sport generally held indoors.
The team will take on Northwestern at
Taube Tennis Stadium. An indoor backup site

has been established in case of bad weather.
Stanford will be led by two returning
NCAA qualifiers redshirt senior 157-
pounder Lucas Espericueta and redshirt jun
ior 174-pounder Nick Amuchastegui. Last
season, Amuchastegui placed fourth in the
165-pound weight class at the NCAA Tourna
ment in Omaha, Neb.
