# Lorig finds niche in NFL
## 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY MANAGING EDITOR 
Since before he stepped foot on
the Farm, Erik Lorig's football
career has been unpredictable.
The trend continued through his
time at Stanford and now, in the
NFL with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, it
has manifested itself even further.
Lorig, a rookie seventh-round pick,
made his first career start for the Bucs two
Sundays ago. Flowever, it wasn't at defen
sive end, the position at which he was draft
ed and played through training camp.
Rather, it was at H-Back a hybrid of the
tight end and fullback roles. In the span of
about a month, he went from the practice
squad to the active roster though inac
tive on game days to a starter at a new
position on the other side of the ball. How
did he get there?
A story of this nature may be odd for
most players, but for Lorig, it's nearly par
for the course. His tale dates back to his
college recruitment. Lorig, a 2005 four-star
recruit at tight end and defensive end who
earned multiple high school All-American
nods, was highly sought after by Stanford,
USC, California and UCLA.
His recruiting process was about as
drawn-out as it can get national signing
day is in early February, and despite alleged
ultimatums from the schools, Lorig did not
commit until May, even missing his Admit
Weekend while he pondered his choice.
After his redshirt year, he played offense in
2006 before switching sides in 2007, where
he stayed for the rest of his Cardinal career.
Known for his run defense, he anchored
the Stanford line before suffering a season
ending groin injury early in his senior year.
Despite a hurt pectoral that kept him
out of most offseason workouts, Lorig was
one of three Cardinal players along

with Jim Dray and Toby Gerhart
selected in the 2010 draft. He prac
ticed at defensive end during sum
mer camp but was cut during the
final roster trimmings in September.
The Bucs immediately signed him to
their practice squad and, with a
wealth of odysseys already behind
him, a new journey began.
"We were in the second week of
the season. I was a defensive end and
I was inactive, I wasn't playing. They
needed a tight end and fullback for
the scout team," Lorig said. "So I
took it as an opportunity to show
case what I can do on offense."
The Bucs knew that Lorig had
played tight end at the collegiate
level, but while he did some work at
H-Back for the Cardinal in fact,
USC had recruited him at the posi
tion his experience as a fullback
was minimal at best. Blocking as
signments and adapting to the offen
sive playbook prompted new chal
lenges.
"There's a mentality switch. At
defensive end,it's about motor going
all the time," he said. "When you
switch sides to offense, you have to
bring that mentality of playing really
hard but you have to be more con
trolled and understand the concept
of the play a few inches or feet
could make the block and determine

where the running back inserts.
You're reading linebackers instead
of linemen."
His learning curve was steep.
Lorig began competing with backup
fullback Chris Pressley in early Oc
tober. In Week 6, against the New
Orleans Saints on Oct. 17, Lorig
played about 15 snaps. The next
weekend, Pressley was released and,
with starting fullback Earnest Gra
ham battling a nagging hamstring in
jury, Lorig took over the starting
role.
"It was a good experience," he
said. "I did some good things and did
some bad things. I have a lot of room
to get better there, from what I
watched on the film. I'm taking what
they give me and making sure I do
my job."
Lorig has leaned on Graham,
starting tailback Carnell "Cadillac"
Williams and running backs coach
Steve Logan during the transition,
and they have aided him in digesting
the different techniques and plays.
That's part of the equation the
other is maintaining the motor that
characterized his time as a defensive
player.
"It's a 110-percent game at this
level. If you're not going at that level,
you're not going to perform well," he
said. "It's also about being really
confident in the playbook."
He paused, then added, "And being
competent, too."
