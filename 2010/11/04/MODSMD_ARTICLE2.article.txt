vegan squash patties with tomato

wheat berry and rice salad was an
event medical professor Chris Gard
ner believes was unprecedented: the
gathering of experts from all seven of
Stanford's schools to talk, well, food.
Gardner, a medical school profes
sor, organized the "food summit" to
prod interdisciplinary discussion of
"some of the nation's and the planet's
most challenging and important
crises" and their implications for en
vironment, health, industry and poli
cy. But beyond the day's agenda,
which attracted 350 attendees, the
event offered a snapshot of a matur
ing sustainable food movement at
Stanford, where students' interest
has been on a steady upward climb
for much of the last decade.
"There's something here that res
onates," Gardner said. He described
finding colleagues one by one who
were working on food issues, first at
the Woods Institute for the Environ
ment, then in philosophy, then at
Stanford Law School. Tire recent re
search on obesity and malnutrition in
India, led by Jeremy Goldhaber-
Fiebert of the Woods Institute, is a
classic example of food's intercon
nected nature, he said. Food-related
health issues can involve food securi
ty, he said; in turn, food security can
relate to climate change.
"People are starting to realize
these things are connected," Gardner
said.

Eric Montell, executive director of

Experts from across Stanford came
together at Wednesday's food summit
to discuss strategies for promoting
better health and nutrition on
campus and across the world.
Stanford Dining, said the event was
"a dream come true." Dining faces
challenges finding and building rela
tionships with food producers who
can meet Stanford's sustainability
criteria and the volume demands of
Stanford's 12,000 daily dining-hall
meals, he said.
But "it's an investment we believe
in," Montell said, pointing to Dining's
accumulation of food suppliers in
Marin County, Salinas and Alaska as
a sign of progress.

"People are
starting
to realize these
things are
connected."

Politics weighed on the minds of
some Stanford experts on Wednes
day, a day after midterm elections sig
naled a Republican takeover of the
U.S. House of Representatives. Polit
ical science professor Rob Reich
Ph.D. '9B, who taught the Sophomore
College course "Food and Politics" in
2008, and law professor Buzz Thomp
son J.D. '76 both spoke on Wednes
day, Thompson focusing on farm bill
reform. The initial "basic issue" of the
election results set to influence agri
cultural policy, Reich said, will be the
new Republican chairperson of the
House Agriculture Committee.
Meanwhile, back on the Farm,
Sarah Wiederkehr spoke about the
surge of interest she has experienced
since the University created her posi
tion as farm educator in 2008. At the
time, Earth Systems administrators
said their classes were undergoing a

"population explosion," and the
number of Earth Systems majors was
hitting a record high for the program.
"Classes are popping up left and
right," Wiederkehr said Wednesday.
"I feel like things have really gone
through the roof."
The trend is not unique to Stan
ford, she said, adding that food-relat
ed health issues in the year of health
care reform have only bolstered the
nationwide conversation.
At Stanford, the community farm
near Stock Farm Road where
Wiederkehr teaches agriculture
classes has become so popular that
students and faculty last fall pro

posed a larger, two-acre farm along
Campus Drive. But the proposal is
"still on hold" while awaiting county
permits, Wiederkehr said. The proj
ect is likely to begin this spring at the
earliest.
The students pushing the project
have made one big purchase while
they wait: a tractor, a Kubota 3300
model they hope will move earth at
the new farm. And as for the admin
istration?
"Stanford is on board,"
Wiederkehr said.
