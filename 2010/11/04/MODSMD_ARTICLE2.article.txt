vegan squash patties with tomato

wheat berry and rice salad was an
event medical professor Chris Gard
ner believes was unprecedented: the
gathering of experts from all seven of
Stanford's schools to talk, well, food.
Gardner, a medical school profes
sor, organized the "food summit" to
prod interdisciplinary discussion of
"some of the nation's and the planet's
most challenging and important
crises" and their implications for en
vironment, health, industry and poli
cy. But beyond the day's agenda,
which attracted 350 attendees, the
event offered a snapshot of a matur
ing sustainable food movement at
Stanford, where students' interest
has been on a steady upward climb
for much of the last decade.
"There's something here that res
onates," Gardner said. He described
finding colleagues one by one who
were working on food issues, first at
the Woods Institute for the Environ
ment, then in philosophy, then at
Stanford Law School. Tire recent re
search on obesity and malnutrition in
India, led by Jeremy Goldhaber-
Fiebert of the Woods Institute, is a
classic example of food's intercon
nected nature, he said. Food-related
health issues can involve food securi
ty, he said; in turn, food security can
relate to climate change.
"People are starting to realize
these things are connected," Gardner
said.
