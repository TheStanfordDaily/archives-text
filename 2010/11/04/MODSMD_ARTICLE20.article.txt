# WOMEN'S VOLLEYBALL
## Cardinal searches for revenge 
### CAROLINE CASELLI DESK EDITOR 
After a convincing six-set sweep over the
Oregon schools last weekend, the No. 3 Stan
ford women's volleyball team (18-2,9-2 Pac
-10) looks to bring its dominance back home as
it takes on the Los Angeles schools in a pair of
top-10 matchups.
The Card will face No. 10 UCLA (17-5,7-
4) on Friday and No. 7 USC (19-3, 8-3) on
Sunday. With the California schools currently
holding the top four spots in the conference
standings No. 2 California leads with a 10-
I conference record, followed by Stanford,
USC and UCLA this weekend's matches
could have major implications for the Pac-10
title.
On Friday, Stanford will have the opportu
nity to avenge a heartbreaking five-set loss to
the Bruins in early October. The match
marked the Card's first loss of the season and
knocked the team out of the No. 1 spot in the
national rankings.
"Since dropping a match to UCLA earlier
this season, our team has focused a lot on re
specting the challenges that the Pac-10 throws
at you each week," said sophomore setter
Karissa Cook, who returned to the lineup last
weekend after battling an injury early in the
season. "There are no 'off weeks' to coast
through in our league, and in our practices we
have really focused on matching that same
level of relentless competition that we see
each weekend."
UCLA has won its last four matches, in
cluding a five-set victory last Friday over No.
II Washington (17-5, 6-5). The Bruins
snapped an eight-match losing streak to the
Huskies.
Senior outside hitter Dicey McGraw and
sophomore opposite Rachael Kidder, who
have led the UCLA offense all season, shined
in the match against Washington, with 24 kills
and 17 kills, respectively. However, neither
Kidder nor McGraw ranks among the confer
ence's kills or points leaders, and it is a differ
ent Bruin, junior middle blocker Katie Camp,
who is 10th in the Pac-10 in hitting percentage
(.337).
Defensively, UCLA continues to stand
out. The Bruins lead the Pac-10 in digs with an
average of 15.45 per set, while junior libero
Lainey Gera is the individual digs leader, aver
aging 4.72 per set. Gera tallied 25 digs in the
Bruins' last meeting with the Cardi
nal.
USC, like UCLA, has not lost a
match in its last two weeks of confer
ence play, and also emerged victori
ous in a five-set thriller over Washing
ton last weekend. In addition, the
Women of Troy have the distinction
of being the only team to beat two
one-loss top-five teams Cal and
No. 4 Hawaii this season.
Junior outside hitter Alex Jupiter's
combined 42 kills against Washington
and Washington State last weekend
earned her both Pac-10 player of the
week and AVCA national player of
the week honors. Jupiter finished with
30 kills against the Huskies and a .414
hitting percentage in addition to 14
digs. She has proven herself as one of
the conference's top attackers she
is fourth in the conference in kills and
points per set, with averages of 4.5 and
5.35 and is second in service aces.
Two other juniors, setter Kendall
Bateman and middle blocker Lauren
Williams, have also been imperative
to USC's success. Bateman leads the
Pac-10 and is second in the nation in
assists (12.34 per set), while Williams
boasts the conference's best hitting
percentage at .414.
The Cardinal has fared well
against both squads historically, with
a 40-33 all-time record against the
Bruins and a 54-18 record against the
Trojans. However, with a loss to
UCLA this season already and a
competitive USC squad looming,
both teams will be dangerous.
"Heading into another big week
end, our team is looking to put dis
tance between us and the southern
California schools who are currently
3rd and 4th in the Pac-10 conference
standings," Cook said. "This weekend
is an opportunity for us to get better
as a team and to gain confidence
nearing the end of league play and
heading into the postseason. Cardinal
fans can expect some competitive vol
leyball this Friday night and Sunday
afternoon."
The Card will take on UCLA on
Friday at 7 p.m. and USC on Sunday at
1 p.m. Both matches will be played in
Maples Pavilion.

The Stanford women's volleyball team is looking for redemption this weekend as it hosts UCLA, one of only two teams
to defeat the Cardinal this season, at Maples Pavilion. Stanford is 9-1 against UCLA at home under head coach John
Dunning. The team will then take on USC on Sunday in another match with legitimate Pac-10 title implications.
