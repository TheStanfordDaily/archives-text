# WOMEN'S VOLLEYBALL
## Cardinal searches for revenge 
### CAROLINE CASELLI DESK EDITOR 
After a convincing six-set sweep over the
Oregon schools last weekend, the No. 3 Stan
ford women's volleyball team (18-2,9-2 Pac
-10) looks to bring its dominance back home as
it takes on the Los Angeles schools in a pair of
top-10 matchups.
The Card will face No. 10 UCLA (17-5,7-
4) on Friday and No. 7 USC (19-3, 8-3) on
Sunday. With the California schools currently
holding the top four spots in the conference
standings No. 2 California leads with a 10-
I conference record, followed by Stanford,
USC and UCLA this weekend's matches
could have major implications for the Pac-10
title.
On Friday, Stanford will have the opportu
nity to avenge a heartbreaking five-set loss to
the Bruins in early October. The match
marked the Card's first loss of the season and
knocked the team out of the No. 1 spot in the
national rankings.
"Since dropping a match to UCLA earlier
this season, our team has focused a lot on re
specting the challenges that the Pac-10 throws
at you each week," said sophomore setter
Karissa Cook, who returned to the lineup last
weekend after battling an injury early in the
season. "There are no 'off weeks' to coast
through in our league, and in our practices we
have really focused on matching that same
level of relentless competition that we see
each weekend."
UCLA has won its last four matches, in
cluding a five-set victory last Friday over No.
II Washington (17-5, 6-5). The Bruins
snapped an eight-match losing streak to the
Huskies.
Senior outside hitter Dicey McGraw and
sophomore opposite Rachael Kidder, who
have led the UCLA offense all season, shined
in the match against Washington, with 24 kills
and 17 kills, respectively. However, neither
Kidder nor McGraw ranks among the confer
ence's kills or points leaders, and it is a differ
ent Bruin, junior middle blocker Katie Camp,
who is 10th in the Pac-10 in hitting percentage
(.337).
Defensively, UCLA continues to stand
out. The Bruins lead the Pac-10 in digs with an
average of 15.45 per set, while junior libero
Lainey Gera is the individual digs leader, aver
aging 4.72 per set. Gera tallied 25 digs in the
