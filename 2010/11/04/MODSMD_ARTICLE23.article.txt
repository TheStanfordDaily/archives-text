# PAC-10 POWER RANKINGS
## 
### 
Every week, Jacob Jaffe will give his Pac-10 football power rankings. These represent a
measure of current success, not a prediction of future standings or a measure of talent.
1. Oregon (8-0, 5-0 Pac-10) UP NEXT: vs. Washington
C Surprise, surprise. Oregon ascends to No. 1 in the country and has to play a rested
USC team on the road. Every pundit is projecting another upset and the Ducks trail
several times . . . and yet they still win by three touchdowns. That's the Oregon we've
seen all year, a team that can play below its usual standard against a quality opponent, and
then in the blink of an eye turn a game on its head and coast to victory. It seems less and less
likely that Oregon will lose, or even be in a single-digit game, before the national title game,
and maybe not even then.
2. Stanford (7-1, 4-1 Pac-10) UP NEXT: vs. Arizona
!!■■!! Now that's the Cardinal team that we've been expecting to see. After a few subpar
games, Stanford looked superb in every facet of the game, pummeling Washington in
one of the team's best performances of the decade. The 107 yards allowed were the
second-fewest ever given up by Stanford, and the fewest in a victory. The Cardinal has
no time to rest on its laurels, though, because it faces its toughest remaining test on Saturday.
Stanford will need another strong showing on both sides of the ball in order to win this top-15
showdown and remain in BCS bowl contention.
3. Oregon State (4-3, 3-1 Pac-10) UP NEXT: at UCLA
Although the record might not indicate it, Oregon State is a very dangerous team.
Cruising to a home win over Cal doesn't tell a whole lot about these Beavers, but
the remaining schedule will. Oregon State looks very likely to make another bowl
game after upcoming contests against UCLA and Washington State, but then the
road gets tougher with USC, Stanford and Oregon closing out the year. The Beavers have a
road win over Arizona in hand and still control their own destiny, and no team wants to see
Oregon State at the end of the year.
4. Arizona (7-1, 4-1 Pac-10) UP NEXT: at Stanford
■ i j The Wildcats might very well be the best team in the country to be only fourth-best in
l£}\ its own conference, but such is life in the Pac-10. Arizona sports a sparkling 7-1
I—■ ■—I record, but questions remain after a lackluster win over UCLA. Quarterback Nick
Foles is scheduled to return on Saturday, but many thought he would play last week, so it'll like
ly be a mix of Foles and backup Matt Scott. Whoever is under center will face a daunting task
against Stanford, but a win would go a long way toward a BCS bowl, although Oregon still
remains on the Wildcats' schedule.
5. Arizona State (4-4, 2-3 Pac-10) UP NEXT: at USC
iA. Yet again, the cure for a struggling Pac-10 team is a matchup with Washington State.
yVval This one was supposed to be much tighter after improving performances from the
Cougars, but Saturday was back to the old Wazzu. The Sun Devils destroyed the
yv 1 Washington schools, as they so often do, and now sit at .500 with a chance to boost
their bowl hopes against the Trojans. A win would give them a chance, especially if not enough
teams qualify for a bowl and the NCAA is forced to take a 6-6 team with two FCS wins. A loss
puts them on the brink of elimination from bowl eligibility, with games against Stanford and
Arizona remaining.
6. USC (5-3,2-3 Pac-10) UP NEXT: vs. Arizona State
F° r a w hile/ it looked like another No. 1 team could go down in a conference road
5 game. But then the Trojans were treated to the Oregon Ducks show and could not
fe recover. Still, a 21 -point loss to Oregon is not the worst thing in the world, and USC
• still has very winnable games on its schedule. The question now becomes how moti
vated the Trojans are, with no bowl game to play for and no BCS-shattering blockbuster games
left. We'll get a pretty good glimpse on Saturday against ASU.
7. UCLA (3-5,1-4 Pac-10) UP NEXT: vs. Oregon State
It speaks to the decline of the bottom half of the Pac-10 that the Bruins, losers of
straight and four of five in conference play, check in at seventh. Despite
almost no hope for a bowl game and the loss of starting quarterback Kevin Prince,
UCLA put forth a valiant effort against a very good Arizona team. The Bruins were dominated
statistically, but they still found themselves with the ball and the chance to take the lead in the
fourth quarter. No ranked teams remain on UCLA's schedule, so the Bruins might be able to
take a positive step toward the future in the closing weeks.
8. California (4-4, 2-3 Pac-10) UP NEXT: at Washington State
y. Same old Golden Bears. Another chance to prove itself on the road, and another
# yy p massive egg laid by the country's most bipolar team. Now with four home wins and
four road losses, Cal is going to seriously challenge its trend by traveling up to
Pullman to take on the lowly Cougars. Even with senior quarterback Kevin Riley likely done for
the year, a loss to Washington State would speak volumes about Cal's road woes. A win makes
bowl eligibility very much within reach, but the Golden Bears still have crucial home contests
against Oregon and Stanford.
9. Washington (3-5, 2-3 Pac-10) UP NEXT: at Oregon
Nothing is going right in Seattle. The Huskies got obliterated by Stanford, failing to
score at home for the first time in 34 years. Quarterback Jake Locker, once thought
▼ to be the No. 1 overall pick in the NFL Draft, has looked dreadful and will now sit
for at least a game due to a rib injury. And he'll have to watch his team travel to Autzen Stadium
to take on what most voters believe is the best team in the country. The preseason optimism
has never seemed further away, and a bowl game now looks almost impossible.
10. Washington State (1-8, 0-6 Pac-10) UP NEXT: vs. California
So the Cougars aren't there yet. After 21 fourth-quarter points against Stanford,
' many thought Washington State would turn the corner and finally win a Pac-10
game. Last weekend seemed like the prime opportunity to do it, against a strug
gling Arizona State team with fading bowl hopes. Instead, the Cougars looked as
bad as ever, failing to score while giving up 375 passing yards. Wazzu has another opportu
nity this week against Cal, who hasn't done much of anything right on the road this season,
but the Cougars will likely need to improve on last week's eight rushing yards in order to pull
the upset.

bowl eligibility very much within reach, but the Golden Bears still have crucial home contests
against Oregon and Stanford.
9. Washington (3-5, 2-3 Pac-10) UP NEXT: at Oregon
Nothing is going right in Seattle. The Huskies got obliterated by Stanford, failing to
score at home for the first time in 34 years. Quarterback Jake Locker, once thought
▼ to be the No. 1 overall pick in the NFL Draft, has looked dreadful and will now sit
for at least a game due to a rib injury. And he'll have to watch his team travel to Autzen Stadium
to take on what most voters believe is the best team in the country. The preseason optimism
has never seemed further away, and a bowl game now looks almost impossible.
10. Washington State (1-8, 0-6 Pac-10) UP NEXT: vs. California
So the Cougars aren't there yet. After 21 fourth-quarter points against Stanford,
' many thought Washington State would turn the corner and finally win a Pac-10
game. Last weekend seemed like the prime opportunity to do it, against a strug
gling Arizona State team with fading bowl hopes. Instead, the Cougars looked as
bad as ever, failing to score while giving up 375 passing yards. Wazzu has another opportu
nity this week against Cal, who hasn't done much of anything right on the road this season,
but the Cougars will likely need to improve on last week's eight rushing yards in order to pull
the upset.
Every week, Jacob Jaffe will give his Pac-10 football power rankings. These represent a
measure of current success, not a prediction of future standings or a measure of talent.
1. Oregon (8-0, 5-0 Pac-10) UP NEXT: vs. Washington
C Surprise, surprise. Oregon ascends to No. 1 in the country and has to play a rested
USC team on the road. Every pundit is projecting another upset and the Ducks trail
several times . . . and yet they still win by three touchdowns. That's the Oregon we've
seen all year, a team that can play below its usual standard against a quality opponent, and
then in the blink of an eye turn a game on its head and coast to victory. It seems less and less
likely that Oregon will lose, or even be in a single-digit game, before the national title game,
and maybe not even then.
2. Stanford (7-1, 4-1 Pac-10) UP NEXT: vs. Arizona
!!■■!! Now that's the Cardinal team that we've been expecting to see. After a few subpar
games, Stanford looked superb in every facet of the game, pummeling Washington in
one of the team's best performances of the decade. The 107 yards allowed were the
second-fewest ever given up by Stanford, and the fewest in a victory. The Cardinal has
no time to rest on its laurels, though, because it faces its toughest remaining test on Saturday.
Stanford will need another strong showing on both sides of the ball in order to win this top-15
showdown and remain in BCS bowl contention.
3. Oregon State (4-3, 3-1 Pac-10) UP NEXT: at UCLA
Although the record might not indicate it, Oregon State is a very dangerous team.
Cruising to a home win over Cal doesn't tell a whole lot about these Beavers, but
the remaining schedule will. Oregon State looks very likely to make another bowl
game after upcoming contests against UCLA and Washington State, but then the
road gets tougher with USC, Stanford and Oregon closing out the year. The Beavers have a
road win over Arizona in hand and still control their own destiny, and no team wants to see
Oregon State at the end of the year.
4. Arizona (7-1, 4-1 Pac-10) UP NEXT: at Stanford
■ i j The Wildcats might very well be the best team in the country to be only fourth-best in
l£}\ its own conference, but such is life in the Pac-10. Arizona sports a sparkling 7-1
I—■ ■—I record, but questions remain after a lackluster win over UCLA. Quarterback Nick
Foles is scheduled to return on Saturday, but many thought he would play last week, so it'll like
ly be a mix of Foles and backup Matt Scott. Whoever is under center will face a daunting task
against Stanford, but a win would go a long way toward a BCS bowl, although Oregon still
remains on the Wildcats' schedule.
5. Arizona State (4-4, 2-3 Pac-10) UP NEXT: at USC
iA. Yet again, the cure for a struggling Pac-10 team is a matchup with Washington State.
yVval This one was supposed to be much tighter after improving performances from the
Cougars, but Saturday was back to the old Wazzu. The Sun Devils destroyed the
yv 1 Washington schools, as they so often do, and now sit at .500 with a chance to boost
their bowl hopes against the Trojans. A win would give them a chance, especially if not enough
teams qualify for a bowl and the NCAA is forced to take a 6-6 team with two FCS wins. A loss
puts them on the brink of elimination from bowl eligibility, with games against Stanford and
Arizona remaining.
6. USC (5-3,2-3 Pac-10) UP NEXT: vs. Arizona State
F° r a w hile/ it looked like another No. 1 team could go down in a conference road
5 game. But then the Trojans were treated to the Oregon Ducks show and could not
fe recover. Still, a 21 -point loss to Oregon is not the worst thing in the world, and USC
• still has very winnable games on its schedule. The question now becomes how moti
vated the Trojans are, with no bowl game to play for and no BCS-shattering blockbuster games
left. We'll get a pretty good glimpse on Saturday against ASU.
7. UCLA (3-5,1-4 Pac-10) UP NEXT: vs. Oregon State
It speaks to the decline of the bottom half of the Pac-10 that the Bruins, losers of
straight and four of five in conference play, check in at seventh. Despite
almost no hope for a bowl game and the loss of starting quarterback Kevin Prince,
UCLA put forth a valiant effort against a very good Arizona team. The Bruins were dominated
statistically, but they still found themselves with the ball and the chance to take the lead in the
fourth quarter. No ranked teams remain on UCLA's schedule, so the Bruins might be able to
take a positive step toward the future in the closing weeks.
8. California (4-4, 2-3 Pac-10) UP NEXT: at Washington State
y. Same old Golden Bears. Another chance to prove itself on the road, and another
# yy p massive egg laid by the country's most bipolar team. Now with four home wins and
four road losses, Cal is going to seriously challenge its trend by traveling up to
Pullman to take on the lowly Cougars. Even with senior quarterback Kevin Riley likely done for
the year, a loss to Washington State would speak volumes about Cal's road woes. A win makes
bowl eligibility very much within reach, but the Golden Bears still have crucial home contests
against Oregon and Stanford.
9. Washington (3-5, 2-3 Pac-10) UP NEXT: at Oregon
Nothing is going right in Seattle. The Huskies got obliterated by Stanford, failing to
