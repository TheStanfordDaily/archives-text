## Stanford boasts second-highest number of alumni in new Congress 
### THEO MATTHEWS 
Stanford has the second-most graduates in
Congress, according to a list compiled by U.S.
News & World Report. Eleven Cardinal alum
ni currently serve in the Senate and House of
Representatives, five of whom were re-elected
on Tuesday. Stanford places second only to
Harvard, which dropped its representation to
13 members from 15 after the election.
Among the alumni, seven are senators and
five are representatives. Two are women; nine
are Democrats.
Although the members represent states as
far away as the Illinois, there is a higher con
centration of elected alumni holding office in
the West Coast.

Political science professor Simon Jackman
said the drive to enter public office probably
begins even before college.
"The flicker of political ambition begins
probably as soon as high school and that inter
est matures during the college years," Jackman
said. "The prescribed college path for a career
in politics tends to begin with politicians earn
ing degrees in the humanities or social sci
ences, which is then usually complimented by
a J.D."
The majority of the alumni hold degrees in
political science, history, economics or interna
tional relations.
Sen.Dianne Feinstein '55,D-Calif., who has
served in the Senate since 1992, received her
bachelor's degree in history. She is chair

woman of the Senate Intelligence Committee.
Sen. Judy Biggert '59 earned her degree in
international relations and is one of the two
Republicans in the group. Biggert, a represen
tative from the 13th district in Illinois, is finish
ing up her 12th year in the House. She serves
on various House committees, including the
Committee on Financial Services, Committee
on Education and Labor and Committee on
Science and Technology.
Rep. David Wu '77, a Democrat represent
ing Oregon's first congressional district, has
the only science degree in the cohort, with a
bachelor's degree in biological sciences. Wu
serves on the Education and Labor Commit
tee.
Biggert and Wu were re-elected on Tues

day.
Political science professor Gary Cox, who
teaches a class on Congress, believes there are
a variety of reasons why Stanford might pro
duce more liberal politicians, including the ge
ographical backgrounds of the members of
Congress.
"People that come to this institution tend
to come from more liberal backgrounds or
more liberal parts of the country," he said. "To
figure out what the Stanford effect is, one
would have to have an idea of their beliefs
coming in and what they look like when they
exit."
