## GSC approves executive campaign spending bill Council debates spending cap's effect on free speech 
### ANNA SCHUESSLER STAFF WRITER 
At this week's Graduate Student Council
(GSC) meeting, members discussed new pro
gramming ideas, approved a bill for ASSU ex

ecutive campaign-spending reform and pre
pared for the council's weekend retreat. Over
the weekend, the group hopes to clarify its po
sition with regard to annual budgetary and eth
ical issues and to work on reestablishing its role
as voice of the graduate student population.
Co-chair Justin Brown started the meeting
by swearing in third-year law student Tom
Spahn as the GSC's law school representa
tive. Spahn had been in attendance at the
GSC's most recent meetings; last week, after
Spahn articulated his reasons for pursuing

the position, voting members approved his
nomination.
ASSU President Angelina Cardona 'll
updated the group on Undergraduate Senate
events and discussed the executive cam
paign-spending bill she and Vice President
Kelsei Wharton 'l2 introduced last week, a
bill the Senate approved on Tuesday. Car
dona clarified particular amendments to the
original bill and asked for the GSC's ap
proval of the measure.
Concerns about the bill's potential to limit

freedom of speech were raised, and council
members expressed varying levels of comfort
with the bill. Spahn hedged against the bill,
arguing that such spending caps might too
closely monitor an individual's freedom to
spend money as he or she chooses.
"You are taking away [the candidates']
ability to spend their money, and you are af
fecting their right to free speech," Spahn said.
"This is no different from telling people you
can only put up X number of fly
ers."
Spahn suggested offering a vol
untary cap, in which candidates
would agree to spend within a set of
pre-determined parameters, but
other members disagreed with him.
Many thought that a voluntary cap
would not realistically encourage
student candidates to spend less on
their campaigns, and some felt the
mandatory cap would be necessary
to level the playing field among
candidates with varying socioeco
nomic backgrounds. Social science
representative Salvador Zepeda
argued in favor of an outcome that
would please the most people, re
gardless of the method.
"I think we should vote on prin
ciple rather than the mechanism,"
Zepeda said. "I do think that the
cap limits the ability for students to
spend their own money. I think the
[bill] promotes the social optimum.
And I think I have to vote in favor
of the social optimum."
The group's discussion of the bill
came to a close when Brown re
minded the group that certain
smaller measures of the bill could
be amended even after it saw ap
proval from both the undergradu
ate and graduate governing bodies.
The bill passed by consensus, and
the group moved on to discuss the
Stanford Student Enterprise's
progress on a new store in Tresid
der Union.
Engineering representative
Joanna Lankester, who also heads
the GSC's programming commit
tee, expressed a desire to make the
reimbursement process for student
group checks public. In response to
the slow turnover of checks as they
are processed by administrators,
Tankester suggested that a website
specifically designed to track the
reimbursement process be created.
"If we could have some sort of
system by which reimbursements
can be tracked, it would be a really
efficient way to see that informa
tion without people sending a
bunch of e-mails," Lankester said.
The council decided to discuss
the issue in the future. It approved
all funding bills.
