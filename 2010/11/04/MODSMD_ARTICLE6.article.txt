## Prof, warns against high-speed rail Project unlikely to turn profit, says scholar 
### SAMANTHA McGIRR DESK EDITOR 
California's proposed high-speed
rail system would likely cost taxpay
ers money even in the long term, ac
cording to Stanford management
professor Alain Enthoven.
His Oct. 12 report entitled "The
Financial Risks of California's Pro
posed High-Speed Rail Project"
co-authored by William Grindley, a
former World Bank analyst, and
William Warren, a Silicon Valley fi
nance consultant concludes "that
there is little if any chance the system
will pay for itself."
The proposed California high
speed rail, which would run 800 miles
from Tos Angeles to downtown San
Francisco, has an estimated cost of
$43 billion. The state has thus far re
ceived more than $3 billion in feder
al aid for the project, and state voters
approved more than $9 billion in
funds with Prop IA, passed in 2008.
Enthoven, however, says the proj
ect has been "sold to the voters on
false premises" and points to wide
spread diminished returns on high
speed transit systems.
"The whole history of high-speed
rail projects is one of financial failure
and big cost overruns," Enthoven
said.
The report, independently fi
nanced by the three primary authors
and published online by the Commu
nity Coalition on High-Speed Rail,
cites research by the Congressional
Research Service that counts every
high-speed rail system as a money
loser, with two exceptions: a Paris-to-
Lyon line in France and an Osaka-to-
Tokyo line in Japan. These systems
break even, says Enthoven, in large
part because of their cultural con
text.
"These are large metro areas with
good public transportation," En
thoven said. "These are cultures in
which people don't own their own
cars."
Enthoven dismisses the Califor
nia High Speed Rail Authority's
(CHSRA) proposed ridership figure
of 39 million by 2030 as "pure fanta
sy." For comparison, he points to the
Northeast Corridor's Acela train,
which runs from Boston to Washing
ton, D.C. and served only 3 million
passengers in 2009. Enthoven pre
dicts ridership for the California sys
tem would be "one tenth to one
