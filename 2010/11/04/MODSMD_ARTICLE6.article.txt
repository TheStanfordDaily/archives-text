## Prof, warns against high-speed rail Project unlikely to turn profit, says scholar 
### SAMANTHA McGIRR DESK EDITOR 
California's proposed high-speed
rail system would likely cost taxpay
ers money even in the long term, ac
cording to Stanford management
professor Alain Enthoven.
His Oct. 12 report entitled "The
Financial Risks of California's Pro
posed High-Speed Rail Project"
co-authored by William Grindley, a
former World Bank analyst, and
William Warren, a Silicon Valley fi
nance consultant concludes "that
there is little if any chance the system
will pay for itself."
The proposed California high
speed rail, which would run 800 miles
from Tos Angeles to downtown San
Francisco, has an estimated cost of
$43 billion. The state has thus far re
ceived more than $3 billion in feder
al aid for the project, and state voters
approved more than $9 billion in
funds with Prop IA, passed in 2008.
Enthoven, however, says the proj
ect has been "sold to the voters on
false premises" and points to wide
spread diminished returns on high
speed transit systems.
"The whole history of high-speed
rail projects is one of financial failure
and big cost overruns," Enthoven
said.
The report, independently fi
nanced by the three primary authors
and published online by the Commu
nity Coalition on High-Speed Rail,
cites research by the Congressional
Research Service that counts every
high-speed rail system as a money
loser, with two exceptions: a Paris-to-
Lyon line in France and an Osaka-to-
Tokyo line in Japan. These systems
break even, says Enthoven, in large
part because of their cultural con
text.
"These are large metro areas with
good public transportation," En
thoven said. "These are cultures in
which people don't own their own
cars."
Enthoven dismisses the Califor
nia High Speed Rail Authority's
(CHSRA) proposed ridership figure
of 39 million by 2030 as "pure fanta
sy." For comparison, he points to the
Northeast Corridor's Acela train,
which runs from Boston to Washing
ton, D.C. and served only 3 million
passengers in 2009. Enthoven pre
dicts ridership for the California sys
tem would be "one tenth to one
twentieth" of the CHSRA figures, in
large part because the high-speed
rail will not serve a primarily metro
politan area.
"I think congestion relief and air
quality are legitimate reasons to ex
pand in metropolitan areas," En
thoven said. "But 1-5 is completely
empty. It's not the place to put re
sources if you want to improve con
gestion."
Enthoven further questions the
environmental implications of the
project, pointing out that the con
struction alone will damage proper
ty and release large amounts of car
bon into the air. Rather than build
ing an entire high-speed rail system,
Enthoven believes California legis
lators should direct funds toward the
expansion of current public trans
portation in the state's large cities.
"We ought to use that money to
subsidize public transportation with
in metro areas," Enthoven said." [We
should] put resources into improv
ing Caltrain and [funding] buses to
help people get to Caltrain. We
ought to continue to expand BART,
improve parking at stations, add an
other airport or two."
The CHSRA could not be
reached for comment. Robert

Cruickshank, chairman of the advo
cacy group Californians for High
Speed Rail, said Enthoven may have
a personal stake in the proposed
plan.
"He says quite openly he is a
homeowner near the tracks and he's
worried about his property value, so
I think that needs to be kept in mind
when assessing that report," Cruick
shank said in an Oct. 30 Peninsula
Press article.
Enthoven responds that he is, in
fact, adverse to the idea of the high
speed rail near his residence.
"I'll admit, I don't want it in my
backyard," he said. "I don't want it in
Stanford's front yard, either."
The project is even less tolerable,
he says, because of its unlikely re
turns to the state.
"The high-speed rail will do huge
damages to properties in Palo Alto,
Mountain View, some of Stanford,"
he said. "If you're going to do all that
damage, you better have a powerful
economic and social justification."
