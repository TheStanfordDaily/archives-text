## Sprinting to 50.000 words 
### JENNY THAI STAFF WRITER 
It's that infamous time of the quar
ter: the hazy, dizzying weeks of
tackling midterms, grinding
through p-sets and churning out co
herent thesis statements for papers.
As the quarter reaches its peak in bustling activity, a
small fraction of the Stanford community is taking deep
breaths before plunging straight into their writing.
Those people will breathe easily only after generating
50,000-word novels.
National Novel Writing Month, known as NaNoW
riMo, is a now-worldwide writing event that takes place
during November. Organizers promote it as "30 days
and nights of literary abandon." Aspiring novelists reg
ister online and undertake the daunting task of writing
an entire novel from scratch in one month.
"Fifty thousand words," said creative writing lectur
er Scott Hutchins. "That's the definition of success."
Hutchins, along with creative writing lecturer Tom
Kealey, co-teach English WOT, "Special Topics in Inter
mediate Fiction Writing: Nanowrimo." This quarter is
the first time the course has centered on preparing stu
dents for their writing marathons in November.
One key component of preparation is the reading of
several novels that are of NaNoWriMo length, includ
ing Kurt Vonnegut's "Slaughterhouse Five," Ernest
Hemingway's "The Sun Also Rises" and Chinua
Achebe's "Things Fall Apart."
"We've analyzed what has made them
work and that has been interesting," said
Aaron Peterson 'l3, a student taking the 1
course. "It shows how much you can do with
writing."
What sets the course apart from other cre
ative writing classes at Stanford is its unique way of
providing feedback early in the quarter.
"We reverse the model of typical workshops,"
Hutchins said. "Usually you read a lot before writing
and getting feedback. Here, we've been giving people a
lot of feedback on their outlines before they start the
novel writing."
Early comments from fellow writers are an important
part of the collaborative experience the class fosters, par
ticularly before the novels are underway, so that students
can deal with potential writing obstacles early on.
"There's a huge difference between writing a short
story and writing a novel," said Guillermo Huerta 'O9.
"One thing that's definitely tripped me up is writing in
different voices. It's been nice to get comments back so
I know what to work on."
However, for most students, the writing is an inti
mate process, and the prospect of revealing their rough
story outlines and possible ideas can be intimidating.
"I have trouble sharing my writing with others," said
Chris Rurik 'll. "I want to be secretive about it. I want
people to see the complete form, and not the process.

There's a feeling that I'm trying to create and I'm
afraid when I show it to people before that idea is
realized, they'll look at it differently."
It is this aspect of collaboration that has actually be
come one of this class's greatest strengths.
"There's a lot of camaraderie in our group and a lot
of support, which is essential since we're doing some
thing this big," Peterson said.
This goes for all participants. "It's a fellowship,"
Kealey said. "Other people hold me ac-

countable. Just the fact we're doing it
collaboratively makes it
doable. It's like going to the
gym it's much more suc
cessful if you go with other '
people instead of just yourself."
According to Kealey, the var-

ious novels in the class cover a wide
range of genres, including fantasy, sci-fi, mystery, "real
istic fiction" and magical realism.
"Mine takes place in a medieval world," said
Grant Mathews 'l3. "I have some guiding ideas, but
nothing too specific. It's more focused on character
development and I've been trying to keep the magic
off-stage."
All of the preparation will culminate in daily writing
sprints, which are characteristic of NaNoWriMo writing.
Contrary to the common perception that all fast writing
is bad writing, there is a general consensus in the class
that there is value in rapid, word limit-based writing.
"I want to spend time just writing, to spend time
turning off my internal editor," Kealey said. "1 want
Nto get my characters, the tension out onto the
page and work on crafting characters and the

story arc.
With 50,000 words as the finish line, partici
pants will have to write close to 1,700 words per
day "1,667 words, to be exact," said Mathews,
a NaNoWriMo veteran. "I've previously done it
two whole times. I tried to do it during my first year
at Stanford but that turned out to be an epic failure.
Too many credits, too little time."
The enormous time commitment to NaNoWriMo
may be the primary reason why Stanford students and
faculty rarely attempt the challenge.
"How many faculty are participating in NaNoW
riMo? So far, only two," Kealey said.
There is no wiggle room for procrastination.
"A major challenge is not thinking I can just put it off
a day and trying to make it up the next day," Peterson
said. "It takes a lot of willpower to get that many words
out a day."
Yet the reward at the end of November is well worth
the many hours of frantic, caffeine-induced writing for
participants.
"I've always wanted to write a novel," Rurik said.
"Now I'll know what it'll be like to finish a story."
