# Where do you like it?
## 
### JESSICA WERTHEIM STAFF WRITER 
This past month, legions of women updated
their Facebook statuses with evocative
statements, all beginning with: "I like it on .
..Some of those women included the
ladies of Stanford University.
Examples of said titillating statuses included: "I
like it on the bed," "I like it against the wall" and "I like
it in the back of my car."
The trick behind the phrase was the ambiguous use
of the word "it," which was actually referring the
women's purses or bags. The goal of this viral market
ing was to spread the word about October as Breast
Cancer Awareness Month. "I like it on" was predicat
ed on the wildfire-like spread of a previous, unofficial
Facebook campaign that asked women to change
their statuses to the color or print of their bras.
Gloria Koskey 'll "likes it on the couch."
"The first day [the campaign] went viral, my friend
Facebook-chatted me and told me about how it
worked," she said. "I had done the bra one, where you
put your bra color for breast cancer awareness, so I
figured,'l did the last one. I'll do this one too.'"
"It definitely catches people's attention," Koskey
added. "In order for someone to become interested in
a cause, you need to pique their interest, which I think
this campaign achieved. Maybe after seeing these
Facebook statuses someone Googled the cause, and
maybe that person read an article on breast cancer."
Others had more mixed feelings on the status up
dates.
"I knew that it was a campaign for breast cancer
awareness, but I had no idea it was about purses," said
Kaia Mattioli 'll, who created her own version of the
"I like it on" status, sharing that she "liked it better

when [she] didn't know where everyone else liked it."
"I'm all for raising awareness," said Julie
Hern-ndez 'l2, "and last year's bra color statuses got
people talking about breast cancer awareness. [Even
though] this year's topic didn't seem as relevant as last
year's, it got the job done nonetheless."
The reactions were not limited to Stanford. In a re
cent article on Time.com, Megan Gibson wrote,
"There is nothing wrong with campaigning for breast
cancer awareness (or any disease, for that matter). In
fact, quite the opposite is true the effects of suc
cessful campaigning for the disease has led to a signif
icant reduction in the disease. Yet what exactly does
provocatively saying where you like to keep your
purse have to do with a horrible disease that has chal
lenged millions of lives?"
Others on Stanford's campus had similar respons
es and doubted the effectiveness of the viral market
ing campaign.
"I had no idea that had to do with breast cancer
awareness. I just thought [people] were trying to be
funny," said Robert Burns 'l4. "I guess it was success
ful in being widespread, but the message sort of got
lost in the shuffle."
"I didn't find out about the 'I like it on the' trend
until after if had ended. It wasn't until I read about it
in an article that I found out what the 'it' was referenc
ing," said Jean Ansolabehere 'll. "And even now, I'm
not sure about the connection between breast cancer
and where you keep your purse."
"I think the sexual innuendo of the status update
was sort of a strange idea because breast cancer is
something so serious," she continued. "I don't think
it's necessarily the ideal way to start an open forum
about breast cancer."
