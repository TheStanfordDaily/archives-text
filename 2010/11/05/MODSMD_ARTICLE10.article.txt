## Execs talk solar at Greenbeat 
### NARDOS GIRMA 
On Wednesday and Thursday,
Stanford played host to the 2010
Greenbeat Conference, which
brought entrepreneurs and executives
together to discuss green advance
ments in energy technology. Panel
topics included distributive solar ener
gy, consumer efficiency and an entre
preneurship roundtable specifically
directed toward Stanford students.
One presentation, "The Rise of
Distributed Solar," discussed methods
to improve the quality and appeal of
solar systems via technical enhance
ments and the integration of solar en
ergy into economics in order to con
vince more people to use solar energy.
Danny Kennedy, founder of
Sungevity, an Oakland company spe
cializing in solar homes, said the ex
pansion of solar energy is dependent
upon improving the services that
come with it and making people in
trigued in the experience of having a
solar system.
"[We need to] make it sexy, make
it simple, make it fun," said Kennedy,
citing Apple as an example of a com
pany that has accomplished this goal.
"Give people joy in being owners of a
solar system. Learn from Apple. All
of you feel cool sitting there with
your Apple computers,"
But increasing the solar energy
fan-base requires work on more than

just the economic aspect. In fact, Ron
Van Dell, chief executive of Solar-
Bridge in Austin, Texas, believed solar
systems could be made more appeal
ing simply through technical improve
ments. He described the expensive in
stallation and repair processes that
often discourage consumers from in
vesting in solar energy and said this
could be avoided by making electron
ics last longer.
Another technical solution calls
for generating solar energy locally,
from rooftops rather than in large
scale utilities. Typically the bigger
utilities are constructed on farm
lands or in deserts, efforts that not
only cost more money but are more
labor-intensive. This approach of
distributed solar energy brings the
users as close as possible to the tech
nology, which is more economic
compared to large utilities.
Sponsored by SSE Labs, a project
of Stanford Student Enterprises, and
innovation news site Venture√üeat,
the conference brought together par
ticipants from around the world and
featured the "Innovation Competi
tion" for attending companies. Win
ners were awarded the opportunity to
present their ideas to potential in
vestors at the DEMO conference
next spring, valued at $18,500.
