Posts like the one above can be seen on
likealittle.com, the newest website to be
come popularized by Stanford students'
Facebook newsfeeds. The site was devel
oped by Stanford M.B.A. graduate Evan
Reas 'O9 and two other coders, Prasanna
Sankaranarayanan and Shubham Mittal.
The three have been working together at
Internet start-ups since January.
Likealittle.com is an anonymous way
for students to flirt with each other or
spark connections through the Internet.
All the user has to do is fill in the gender,
hair color and location of his or her object
of admiration, write a message and press
the button labeled "Boom!" Then their

"flirt" is posted in real time.
Reas, Sankaranarayanan and Mittal
were able to further decrease barriers to
online social interaction by allowing users
to remain anonymous. Even if a student
comments on a particular post, his or her
only identifier is a nickname the website
assigns, usually a type of fruit.
The idea came from a website Reas
had seen while studying abroad in Ox
ford.
"Oxford University is even more iso
lated than universities in the United
States because it's tutorial based," Reas
said. "The only social interactions were at
parties and at libraries. And when you're
talking to a stranger and really putting
yourself out there, there is that fear of re
jection where a lot of negative factors
could come into play."
Reas described a particular site he
came across in England that relied on
what he called "location-based flirting."
"So for example, you could flirt in the
library," he said. "The dynamics were the
same as the site we came up with. We
wanted to improve upon that website, use
different technology, in order to facilitate

people interacting with others that they
would not otherwise interact with."
Once the initial idea was fleshed out,
Sankaranarayanan was able to build the
entire website in 12 hours. The founders
have been adding features ever since.
The site was launched on Oct. 25 with a
provisional two-day trial run.
"We knew a bunch of people on cam
pus who we asked to be the initial power
users to get the content going," Reas said.
"For the first two days, the content really
was only from the power users. But after
those initial 48 hours, the site just took off.
There was a large-scale diversity of users,
mostly due to Facebook."
Reas, Sankaranarayanan and Mittal do
monitor the comments users make. Be
cause of a concerned e-mail, they have
also added an abuse button, which users
can use to tell the moderators why they
think a particular post should be deleted.
And if the user has a Stanford e-mail ad
dress, he or she has the power to delete
any post that seems offensive.
Letting the University community
moderate the content seems to be
working.

"In general,
we've had
about 50 posi
tive comments

and one concerned
comment made be-

fore we made the security

changes."
Buzz about the site has

traveled fast. More than 50

schools have expressed interest in
having their own campus version of

likealittle.com, but the creators are hesi
tant to allow those schools unsupervised
access.
"We don't want to be totally open,"
Reas said. Keeping the site "high-quality
and complimentary is really important to
us. We don't want it to turn into a creepy
place where non-university students leave
negative comments."
The site has become an almost
overnight sensation, with some days see
ing hundreds of "flirts" posted. But even
with the amount of success and new users
the site has garnered, Reas, Sankara
narayanan and Mittal stand firm on their
goal for the site.

"We don't want
it to become a FML and a MLIA
where people use it as the place

they get entertained everyday," Reas said,
referring to similarly viral sites. "We hope
people make meaningful connections
through this site. We want it to facilitate
communication and just get people to talk
to each other."
