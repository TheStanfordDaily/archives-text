"W" A -yhile many Stanford
% A J students find enough
% / % / of a challenge in try
\l \J ing to juggle a social
â–¼ life with academics,
some like Christina Phillips 'll add
tackling sustainability on the Farm to
their already-packed schedules.
Phillips, who was named a Stanford
Undergraduate Sustainability Scholar
(SUSS) last spring, has been designing
her own project to analyze the feasi
bility of installing solar panels across
the Stanford campus.
"Does it make sense to put in a
solar installation on campus right
now?" Phillips said, describing the
purpose of her project.
Phillips has been working on her
project with a team of 10 other stu
dents and other student-run sustain
ability groups, such as the Stanford
Wind and Energy Project (SWEP).
She has been applying her academ
ic background in economics to con
ducting cost-benefit and technological
analyses, as well as exploring how the
installation of solar panels would af
fect Stanford's appearance and repu
tation.

Phillips and Iberia Elster 'l3, were
the first two students to receive the
SUSS award, which was launched in
2010.The $2,000 stipend, funded joint
ly by the Program in Writing and
Rhetoric (PWR) and the Office of the
Vice Provost for Undergraduate Edu
cation, provides students with the op
portunity to make their ideas about
sustainability on campus a reality.
The new program's co-directors,
Mark Feldman and Kimberly Moekle,
both lecturers in PWR, created SUSS
not only to educate the campus on the
importance of sustainability, but also
to provide students with the mentor
ship and support needed to pursue
their creative plans.
Along the way, SUSS provides the
students with access to resources and
connections with faculty, alumni and
relative departments to enhance their

individual projects.
SUSS is unique in its connection to
PWR because it emphasizes the im
portance of effective communication
of scientific research and findings.
"There is so much great science
and policy, but oftentimes if that does
not find the right way of being com
municated or expressed, or does not
find the right audience, then nothing
happens," Feldman said.
Broad, enthusiastic support for the

program made getting funding "sur
prisingly easy," Feldman said.The pro
gram kicked off in the spring of 2010,
when students who already had sus
tainability projects in motion were en
couraged to apply.
When Phillips and Elster first re
ceived funding, they began meeting as
a group with SUSS co-directors one to
three times per quarter.They also gave
a public presentation in May at Lagu
nita Court.
The scholars are otherwise given
the freedom to conduct their projects
and try to apply their ideas to campus
as they see fit.
The program is "sustainable" for

the SUSS scholars, Feldman said, be
cause it allows them to pursue their
projects without having to take on
extra academic units, providing stu
dents with a balance between inde
pendence and flexibility.
Phillips is excited about the pro
gram because it enables her to make
an impact on her own while still en
gaging in a global problem.
"It is a great opportunity for us to
not only become a part of the discus
sion, but also to do our own pieces of
analysis," she said.
Elster, an earth systems major, is
focusing her project on both the fash
ion and sustainability of Stanford ap
parel. Building on research for im
proving sourcing of fabric, dies and
labor practices, she is investigating a
"sustainability label" for qualifying
store merchandise. Her project is also
looking into the possibility of organiz
ing a clothing exchange on campus,
Feldman said.
The SUSS co-directors hope to de
velop the program's profile by build
ing its online and media presence.
Feldman and Moekle are planning to
create a blog to document the
progress of the scholars' projects.They
also hope to receive feedback from
community members about what ac
tion they might be willing to take to be
"greener."
Feldman said SUSS has also con
sidered asking students abroad to re
port on how they see the future of sus
tainability in other parts of the world.
The program not only works to
make Stanford a leader in the fight for
sustainability, but also provides an op
portunity for the fresh ideas and "self
starting spirit" of Stanford students to
have an impact, Feldman said.
Phillips described the program as
an opportunity for students to be
proactive about shaping the future of
sustainability. As she put it, "If we are
not asking the questions, then who
is?"
