## EDITORIAL Support Stanford football 
### 
The editorial board would like to take
this opportunity to commend the San
Francisco Giants for winning the World
Series and bringing the Commissioner's Tro
phy to Baghdad by the Bay for the first time.
Giants fans, however, are another story.

side of certain circles, there doesn't appear
to be as much excitement for this team as
there should. Perhaps the issue is the small
size of our school. Perhaps it is the emphasis
on academics. Perhaps it is unfamiliarity
with success. But for whatever reason, Stan
ford isn't supporting its football team to its
best ability. At the Washington State game
(which was Homecoming, by the way), the
stadium had mostly emptied out by half
time. That is not what being a football fan is
about. Being a fan means staying until the
end of games, screaming at the opposing of
fense until you can't speak above a whisper
and singing "Hail, Stanford, Hail" like it is
the national anthem and "Don't Stop Be
lieving" rolled into one.
Big Game, our annual football game
against Cal, is coming up in three weeks. Ad
mittedly, there have been some issues with
the Red Zone points system, both on a con
ceptual and an operational level, but that
shouldn't stop anyone's enthusiasm for the
game. Stanford should get excited for the
game. This is the one week of the year where
our vitriol against the weenies isn't elitist,
but just clean, old-fashioned hate.This is one
of the few times that we can come together
as a university and truly be one.
Enthusiasm for Big Game is a starting
point for establishing true fandom on this
campus. The next level is generating excite
ment for the rest of the season and this week
end is a perfect opportunity. Stanford is play
ing Arizona this Saturday at 5 p.m. in a match
up of top-15 teams competing for a potential
Rose Bowl birth that will be televised nation
ally by ABC. Make signs, paint your faces,
wear costumes to get excited for the game.
But most importantly of all, show up and sup
port your team and your university.

The board has noted a marked increase
in the number of people wearing Giants
memorabilia in public, especially in the last
week.The entire campus and local commu
nity was excited for the World Series; how
ever, for many fans, this was their first ex
posure to the Giants. Some of those watch
ing Game 4 in Old Union believed that
Madison Bumgarner was a Dickens char
acter. (He was actually that night's starter,
who threw a masterful eight innings, for
what it's worth.)
In fairness, a playoff run does bring out
many fringe fans in the participants' cities,
but the contrast between the World Series
and the regular season was especially jarring
on campus. Perhaps it is just a condition of
sports fandom in northern California, where
apathy and multitasking seem to be our pri
mary emotions, that other priorities come
first. It can be difficult to follow a 162-game
season when you are busy trying to get your
start-up off the ground or study for your p
chem midterm. But that doesn't mean that
you should renounce sports. Baseball can be
especially difficult to generate campus inter
est because of the extensive season (April to
the beginning of November), large number
of games and hometown alliances.
There is one team, however, that every
one at Stanford should support. It requires
minimal time commitment and it is the Stan
ford football team.

This year's football team is the best that
Stanford has had in at least 10 years, but out-
