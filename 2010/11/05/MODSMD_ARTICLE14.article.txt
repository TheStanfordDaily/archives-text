## Grades and Learning 
### Aysha Bagchi 
The point of education is deep learning,
learning that is integrated into how we
think and understand, that is multiplied
outside the classroom and placed in moral and
reflective contexts. Letter grades are there to
provide a backdrop incentive for more of that
learning to happen. They are meant to get stu
dents on board who otherwise would not care
and to get us to follow teachers down paths
when we do not yet see the value in following.
What letter grades more often do today is
stunt deep, integrated learning. And they do
this especially because of the type of students
who make it to Stanford and beyond. Today's
students are much more strictly focused on the
incentive structure. The meritocratic system by
which we get here has become much more in
tense and competitive only 2,300 of 32,022
almost entirely excellent students were admit
ted last year. Only 7.2 percent!
When the system is that tough, when any
mistake is seen as a potential disqualifier, uni
versities end up rewarding student focus on
measurements much more than focus on inte
grated and long-term learning. As students, we
become so busy and targeted that we end up
sidestepping the hard work that is not neces
sary for the quick A, the 4.0 transcript and the
lengthy activities list. We learn to memorize
vocab lists and formulae rather than read chal
lenging books or partake in experiments that
develop our understanding. We learn to focus
on the short-term, take few risks, and keep our
heads so continuously beneath the water that
we never even attempt to integrate classroom
content with how we understand.
The basic failing of letter grades in this
process is to orient students toward short
term, surface-level achievement rather than
long-term, integrated learning, to wrongly as
sume that the aims of achievement and learn
ing are aligned. When students are oriented to
ward achieving rather than learning, we act
like Wall Street under regulations: we game
the system left and right and try to be one step
ahead of any regulation that would thwart us.
Because our goal is not aligned with a teacher's
because we aim for the grade and they aim
to achieve learning that improves our weak
nesses and survives beyond the classroom
we too often end up taking classes with easy
As, avoiding the tougher subjects we would
most benefit from and pleasing rather than in
tellectually wrestling with our grade-givers.
This is not a fair description of every student by
any means, but it is true of enough to be a big
concern.
Grades have created college experiences
that are, at times, antithetical to deep learning.
But students still need incentives, and grad
schools and companies need assessment. The

question is whether there is a better system for
achieving our ends. One option would be to re
place letter grades with short paragraphs that
appear on a transcript discussing a particular
student's performance and development. This
would not be feasible in all classes: huge lec
ture courses, especially ones in which students
do not need to attend small sections in order to
achieve course goals, might need to be an ex
ception. But if Stanford could achieve that sys
tem in enough of its classes think all semi
nars, residential education programs and
maybe even IHUM it would do a lot to re
duce student cynicism toward courses and aid
in the integration that is necessary for the
learning that matters most.
Imagine that when a student takes a fresh
man seminar, a teacher writes a paragraph
about her performance that appears on her
transcript at the end and discusses with her
how she did and how she could improve. Her
orientation will be diverted much more effec
tively from focusing on achievement, on a let
ter that can be attained through cynical choic
es and approaches to Stanford, to focusing on
herself and how she could improve. She will
more often view her education as providing a
helpful reflection on where she is and how she
could grow. She will more often take classes
that challenge her, knowing that come
what may she will not be summed up as a
"C".
She may even get sincerely hooked on the
aim of deep learning, learning that works on
weaknesses and opens new worlds. Her moti
vation would spring from not wanting to disap
point her teacher or fall below her personal po
tential. Her presently dormant desire to treat
her education as something more than rungs
up the achievement ladder might be en
livened. Deeper thinkers, students with rich in
tellectual experiences at Stanford and an ap
preciation for both the relations between dif
ferent subjects and the moral contexts that sur
round them would emerge. And some stress
might even be alleviated from a student expe
rience that is too often too busy for reflection.
