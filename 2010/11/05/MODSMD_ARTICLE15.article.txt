Chances are you, being the literate per
son you are, have probably read some
science fiction in your life. Or, less
probably, a geometry text book. So you un
derstand that the zeroth dimension is a point,
the first a line, the second a plane, the third
space, and (through whatever exciting im
agery) the fourth is space-time. And you
know what it means when I say a group of
points, or the entities they represent, (the
pyramids at Giza, the price of a good versus
the supply, the descending quality of M.
Night Shyamalan's movies), is linear.They lie
on a line.
But what about when I say thoughts are
linear? Linear thinking is a progression from
one thought (the conjunct of your premises),
to its logical consequence, then to its logical
consequence, and so on. A train of thought.
This is the skeleton of mathematical proof
and any good expository writing (hopefully
your PWR paper). The creation of docu
ments representing linear thought processes
is both easy and useful. A linear argument,
from a single point of view, is the easiest to
communicate. But linearity can also be re
stricting. Imagine an ant walking along a taut
string as if he could only travel along that
line. Now imagine a multi-dimensional being
folding the string, bringing the two ends to
gether. All of a sudden the ant has teleported
from one point on the line to another.
It is a familiar story, I know. Personally,
I'm indebted to Madeleine L'Engle, and I'm
sure we're both ultimately indebted to E. A.
Abbott. But until recently I hadn't thought of
how these illustrations of spatial linearity re
lated to linearity of reasoning. Every step is
necessary when traveling in only one dimen
sion, even when traveling between thoughts.
Without height as a dimension, there's no
way to leap. Conversation is one place we
might look for instances of mufti-dimension
al ideas. Consider two distinct linear argu

ments together and you've outlined some
thing that has to exist on a plane. You've
added a dimension. This is one appeal of the
dialogue as an argument structure.
It also seems like a lot of literature is ded
icated to transcending linearity. Through
metaphor you can run multiple trains of
thought on the same fuel. And by writing
down your thoughts, documenting your data
points, you lessen the cognitive load of keep
ing track of them. This allows you to look
back and draw new lines, in different direc
tions, on what you've already created.
This is the premise of the game "Sen
tences," developed by George Hokkanen 'l2.
Recommended for 2-3 players. Requires
pencil or pen, paper or whiteboard. The con
cept is simple: start with a sentence, any sen
tence, and think about it. A lot. Strip it down
so far it would make Derrida blush. Define
words, define their definitions, define how
they relate to one another, to the reader, to
you. Take notes. Notation is important. Ex
plore your concepts in this way until you
reach another sentence: another point you'd
like to plot. Build outward from that. Aim for
new sentences to tie into the existing sen
tences in as many ways as possible. Stray
from these rules to taste. In the end, you
should have a structurally interesting
thought-object.
Sound dull? It's not. Because if you like to
think (and I'd like to think most of you do
like to think), this is a fun way to do it. Even
if a certain sentence isn't particularly potent
by itself, the game invigorates it, at least for
the players.This is a thinking game more than
a writing game: a systematized way to sculpt
ideas about anything. Philosophy. Operating
systems. Language. Psychology. I'd love to
see history or chemistry majors set loose on
this.
The first time / played, things took a turn
to metacommentary. I saw the ultimate ob
ject of the game as to represent everything.
Which is the tenth dimension, of course, ac-

cording to a You Tube video I'd seen earlier
that day. Hokkanen remarked that this might
be a good guiding force and wrote on our
note page: We are going to everything.
But we needed a first sentence. Someone
suggested a boat. We liked the imagery.
Sentence (1): We are on a boat getting to a
place.
(2) Stock the yar vessel with fuel'* and guid
ance*.
(3) Buoyed up on the sea of understanding,
pull up the anchor of convention.
(4) Let the wind* fill the sails*, and we're on
our way into the unknown.
Our fuel was language, our guidance,
structure. We were mapping the sea as we
went, so far as we could perceive from the
bow. The winds were ideas, our minds the
sails. How you get to everything:
(5) A rogue wind blows demanding whence
and whither. Whence? What's land?
(6) "We come from ignorance, a dry place...
Whither? "If we're going to everything,
we're mapping bounds of the ocean, right?
We're seeking our limits," I offer.
"Our limits, hm?" Hokkanen says, and
squints at me. "I wonder if we'd ever think to
look up."
Sentence (6 (b)) ... we are going to the end of
the page."
