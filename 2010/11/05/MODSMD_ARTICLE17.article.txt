# SPORTS
## Fans: cheer hard, but play nice 
### Tom Taylor 
Nothing beats going to a
live game: not the most
incisive analysis by TV
pundits, nor the most
amazing graphics or fun
niest adverts. For me, watching sports is
all about the atmosphere, and however
big your TV might be, you just can't get
that at home.
The pressure cooker environment
of a basketball court is a great place to
get it. Smaller than big football or base
ball stadiums, the intimate atmosphere
has supporters within touching distance
of the players. Sealed in by a roof, the
sound has nowhere to escape, and even
the shouts of a single fan easily carry to
the athletes and coaching staff.
I might be relatively new to Ameri
can sports, but I was lucky enough to
spend a lot of time in Maples last year,
fulfilling Sixth Man and Daily commit
ments. Even when stuck up in the
crow's nest with other journalists and
required to show impartiality, I loved
getting carried along by the mood of the
crowd, amused by the inherent silliness
of the LSJUMB, and, of course, thrilled
by the action.
Sometimes, though, there was a
darker side, too. Occasionally, it felt that
a few fans were going too far, being far
too personal or far too offensive in their
taunting of the opposition. Bringing up
family problems that may have leaked
onto the Internet, attacking people's
faith and a few other things that two
strangers wouldn't say to each other in
normal circumstances.
This isn't something isolated to col
lege basketball, and I'm not singling out
either Maples Pavilion or Cardinal fans.
By all accounts, Maples is nowhere near
the craziest court on the college circuit
and the tiny minority that over-stepped
the mark of decency were fans on both
sides. Perhaps it just seems more obvi
ous in that environment. I am sure a few
fans shout all sorts of nasty things at
football players, but the size and shape
of football stadiums keeps the athletes a
little further from the crowd and
drowns out individual voices.
In a college game it also seems more
malicious to attack the players like this.
Many of them didn't go to their respec
tive colleges because of a singular devo
tion to the cause of that university, but
because they could get a good, solid ed
ucation through their ball skills. They
won't be driving home to their mansion
after the game, and if they get badly in
jured, even the best could see their en
tire future snatched away from them.
The vast majority of them won't go pro.
This, right now, is the pinnacle of their
career and there are no million-dollar
contracts waiting in the wings.
The biggest reason not to rip them to
shreds, though, is that this is college, and
they are just kids.
If you're in a mood where you just
have to verbally abuse someone, at least
consider that coaches are actually pro
fessionals, some paid massive salaries
that should easily make up for anything
a fan can say to them but, please,
don't do that, either. And give the refer
ees a break too, they are only human,
and most have to juggle day jobs and
families around on-court commit
ments.
We expect players to look up to both
refs and coaches, but if we can't even do
that, then why should they?
Now before I give the wrong impres
sion, don't get me wrong. As a fan, I
have nothing but contempt for Cal and
their weird-looking bear mascot, and it
felt painful to see them rush the field
our field after last year's Big Game.
From the stands I wall happily join in
with making fun of their teams and their
university. I'll boo individual players,
taunt them when they foul out and try
to put them off when shooting free
throws. I'll complain when the refs
make bad calls that hurt us, cheer when
we benefit from their mistakes and
gladly see opposing coaches leave the
court downtrodden in defeat. That's
what home advantage is all about, and
why Maples will be a great place to
spend your evenings over the next few
months.
There is a line, though. I'm not going
to pick on some poor kid for their trou
bled background or drag up any per
sonal problems they might have. I'll also
grudgingly go silent or even quietly clap
if an opponent hits a half-court shot or a
visiting team simply demolishes us, and
I'll always happily stand up and applaud
any player who recovers from an in
game injury.
So give them hell, but nicely.

Tom Taylor just feels bad from that one
time someone made fun of his shoes in
a middle school soccer match. If you
were that guy, make his day by apolo
gizing at tom.taylor@stanford.edu.
