## Local students act out against suicide 
### BRANDON POWELL 
"Dear Palo Alto," an arts show
case responding to the Palo Alto sui
cides of recent years, will take place
Saturday, Nov. 6, from 7 to 9 p.m. at
Cubberley Community Center The
ater in Palo Alto. Julia Tachibana, the
local and UC-Davis student who cre
ated the event, was inspired by her
personal connection with suicide.
Tachibana's brother, Ben, a soph
omore at Palo Alto High School
when Tachibana was a junior, took
his own life at age 15 in 2003.
Tachibana was further driven to ac
tion by the four suicides at Gunn
High School in 2009.
"I knew I wanted to help, and I
thought about using art, because it's
such a constructive medium,"
Tachibana said. "I thought about de
voting a night solely to art in order to
open up a dialogue about these is
sues."
The event, which is free and open
to all, received aid from a number of
local organizations, including Palo
Alto Medical Foundation, Break
Through The Static, a local nonprofit
devoted to helping teens who have
lost someone to suicide, and the city's
Community Services Division, which
provided the venue free of charge.
The show mostly written and

produced by the student performers
will feature a variety of dancing,
singing and drama, as well as physical
artwork submitted by local teens.
Members of the Stanford Theater
Activist Mobilization Project will
also be performing.
"One of the strategies is youth
outreach and elevating youth voice,"
said Rob de Geus, who manages
recreation activities in the Commu
nity Services Division. "This event
that Julia has come up with is aligned
with some of the goals that we have
with Project Safety Net, so that's why
we wanted to help her make it hap
pen."
Project Safety Net is the commu
nity collaborative that promotes so
cial and emotional health for Palo
Alto youth.
In addition, a special city support
team was assembled to ensure the
topic was dealt with in a safe and ap
propriate manner. But Tachibana ex
pressed confidence in dealing with
such a sensitive issue, and empha
sized the caution she has taken.
"I think have had such a personal
connection with suicide, I've been
able to gauge pretty well what would
and wouldn't be appropriate,"
Tachibana said. "Still, we have to re
member that there will be a wide
range of people in the audience, in

eluding some who have never talked
about it, so we definitely want this to
be a very safe event."
"I just want to stress the point that
although this is a really sensitive
topic, we have to come forward and
talk about it," she added. "If we
don't, who will?"
Molly Butera, bassist for the local
band After Closing Time whose
members attend Gunn, said that they
decided to audition for the event
after seeing flyers around town.
"Music has always been some
thing that lets us release our stress
and puts us in a good mood," Butera
wrote in an e-mail to The Daily, "So
we decided to share that with others
and show them that there are healthy
ways you can release stress and have
fun at the same time."
As with many of the other acts. After
Closing Time will perform primarily
original works.
Tachibana hopes that the event
will let teens know that they are not
alone, and that help is out there.
"I think we also want to lift the
stigma of reaching out for help," she
said. "I myself had to learn that you
won't really get better until you let
people reach out to you."
