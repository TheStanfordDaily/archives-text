# Card to host top-10 foes
## Men's water polo team back at home 
### DASH DAVIDSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford men's water polo
team, in the midst of a strong stretch
that has pushed its ranking all the way
up to No. 4, finally comes home for an
intense weekend of action featuring
games against two tough Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation (MPSF)
foes.
On Saturday at noon, in what will be
just the second home game the Cardi
nal (10-5, 3-1 MPSF) has played all
year, No. 8 Long Beach State rolls into
Avery Aquatic Center, looking to
avenge a 9-8 loss to the Cardinal earli
er this season in the second round of
the SoCal Tournament.
Long Beach State (7-10,0-4 MPSF)
is in danger of missing the annual
Thanksgiving-weekend MPSF Tour
nament for the second year in a row,
certainly an aberration for the 49ers'
stellar coach, Gavin Arroyo, who had
never missed the playoffs before last
season. Long Beach State needs to win
at least two out of its final four confer
ence games to have a chance of making
the field for the very competitive tour
nament.
The 49ers are led on offense by
freshman Nick Rascon, who has
scored 30 goals and has netted at least
one shot in 14 straight games. In goal,
they are anchored by sophomore
Matthew Kubeck, who averages 7.06
saves per contest.
There will be no break for the Car
dinal, however, as it must come back
quickly to take on No. 5 UC-Irvine at
home on Sunday at noon.
The Anteaters (14-5, 3-2 MPSF)
are coming off a big win on Halloween
versus then-No. 7 Pacific. This will be
the first meeting between the two
teams this season.
The Anteaters' win on Sunday was
archetypal of their season to date
the five-goal effort of scoring leader
Griffin Lerman led the team. Steady
play by the defense as a whole, which
is anchored by senior goalie Matt
Johnson, helped as well.
Stanford is coming off three very
one-sided wins. Over its last three
games, the Cardinal has outscored its
opponents by a combined score of
50-18.
The Stanford offense has been ex
tremely impressive in these contests,
especially senior utility Jeffrey

NOTES ! After a long stretch of playing mostly
on the road, the Cardinal will return home to
face a pair of top-10 foes this weekend. First
up is the talented but struggling squad from
Long Beach State: Despite a No. 8 ranking,
the 49ers have dropped four straight games
in MPSF play and are already fighting for
their postseason hopes.


Schwimer and junior driver Jacob
Smith. Schwimer scored four times in
the Cardinal's Friday night victory
over Santa Clara, a season-high for
him. Smith, the Cardinal's leading
scorer this season with 35 goals, added
four goals of his own to match
Schwimer for the team high and boost
his goals-per-game average to 2.33,
good for fourth in the conference.
Stanford will take on Long Beach
State on Saturday and UC-Irvine on
Sunday. Both matches are scheduled to
start at 12 p.m. at Avery Aquatics Cen
ter.
