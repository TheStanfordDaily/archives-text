# Stanford revises proposed changes to Marguerite routes
## 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Samantha McGirr 
Stanford's Parking & Transportation Services (P&TS)
has revised proposed changes for its Marguerite shuttle
lines after receiving more than 290 comments from the
campus community on an earlier proposal.
The latest proposal would affect Marguerite routes
Line A, Line B, Line C, Medical Center Loop (MC) and
Midnight Express. P&TS would implement these changes,
if made, early in 2011.
The proposal includes combining current portions of
Line A and Line C. The new route would be Line C and
would travel between Stanford West and Escondido
Village, with stops including Pasteur Drive and Serra
Mall.
The proposal would rename Line B Clockwise to
Line B1 and rename Line B Counter-Clockwise to Line

82. The route would begin and end at the Palo Alto
Transit Center and circle campus via the Alumni Center
or the Medical Center and Tresidder. It eliminates serv
ice to Pasteur Drive, Blake Wilbur Drive, and Welch
Road due to lane closures and construction, which are
expected to last from spring 2011 to fall 2012.
The proposal would reverse the direction of the current
Medical Center Loop due to lane closures on Welch Road,
expected to last until fall 2012. Aside from the Medical
Center, destinations include Parking Structure 5 and the
newly opened Li Ka Shing Center.
Finally, proposed revisions would expand the Midnight
Express service to travel in both directions, with one direc
tion to be Ml and one to be M2.The route would be con
densed, going from the Oval to the Palo Alto Transit Cen
ter instead of Quarry Road.
P&TS is currently accepting comments and suggestions
on the proposed changes through its online question form
or by e-mail at marguerite@stanford.edu. The comment
period will last through Nov. 21.
