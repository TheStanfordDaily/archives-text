A thin wallet and dining hall ennui are enough to launch Stanford stu
dents into the competitive eating circuit. Intermission compiled the area's
greatest food challenges for those looking to flex their stomachs.

The Pho Challenge

1

Slurp down two pounds of beef and two pounds of noodles within an hour at Pho Garden
in Mountain View, and you get to take the giant bowl home. Otherwise, you pay the $22
price tag.

The Hellfire
Challenge

2

Test your spice tolerance for a free T-shirt at Smoke Eaters in Santa Clara. Masochists who take up
The Hellfire Challenge must eat 12 hot wings in 10 minutes then go another five minutes of
"afterburn" without any drinks or napkins.

Killer Whale Roll

3

San Francisco's Bay Shabu Sushi Sake pits contestants against the four-pound "Killer
Whale Roll," a rice slab of spicy tuna, eel, shrimp, crab, acovado, tempura, sweet potato
and sauce. If you finish in under half an hour, you get on the "Wall of Fame;" if you fail,
you fork over $4O.

Iguana's
Burritozilla

4

The 17-inch, five-pound burrito baby-monster made by San Jose's Iguana's puts the Treehouse to
shame.

J-Bo Challenge

5

Consume $2O-worth of non-beverage menu items from Jack in the Box to win bragging
rights and smug indigestion. Substitute Taco Bell or In-N-Out at will, or hit up all three
for the fast food triple crown. (No, this isn't a real challenge, but you'll probably do it
anyway.)
