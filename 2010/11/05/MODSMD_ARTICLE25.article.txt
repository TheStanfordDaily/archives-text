## INTRODUCING FOXY 
### â€” matt WEBER contact matt: docrock@stanford. edu 
On Friday, Oct. 29, the
patrons of Slim's in San
Francisco were treated to
something far more than a simple
concert. Cincinnati group Foxy
Shazam brought to the crowd a set
filled not only with energetic music
but also with wild quirks and acro
batics, combined to provide a stage
show unrivaled by many of today's
popular acts.
At the beginning of the show,
Foxy Shazam emerged with a larger
than-life stage presence, taking hold

of their instruments as if walking out
onto the stage at Wembley Stadium.
Tearing through songs from their lat
est CD such as "Unstoppable,"
"Count Me Out" and an exhilarating
performance of the album-opening
"Bombs Away," Foxy Shazam also
included a few popular songs from
earlier in their career. It was apparent
that each of the musicians was com
pletely on tempo and in his element,
and the crowd response was over
whelmingly positive as a result.
The music, though fantastic, was

of a lesser focus to me than the visual
performance taking place onstage.
This may seem odd to the average
concertgoer, but Foxy Shazam cer
tainly wouldn't think so. Infusing its
indie rock attitude with the theatri
cality and flamboyance of the glam
era, the band aimed to entertain the
audience by any means possible. Not
only did the group command many
intrigued looks with unusual cos
tumes and unorthodox choices of
facial hair, the members also
employed wild gesticulations and
grandiose motions of the entire body
in order to bring the audience a show
that was as appealing visually as it
was aurally.
The keyboardist, Schuyler
Vaughn White, decided on more
than one occasion to stomp on his
keyboard while playing it with his
hands, and lead singer Eric Sean
Nally grabbed the attention of the
audience by moving all around the
stage and throwing around the
microphone with both his hands and
feet. Between songs, Nally engaged
the audience with jokes, stories and
startling battle cries, introducing
"Unstoppable" as a song he wrote in
prison and "Bye Bye Symphony" as
one written as a child in the bottom
of a laundry basket. The only disap
pointing moment of the show was
the ending, which Nally himself
openly disclaimed as "boring."
Instead of the energetic musical and
visual climax likely expected by most
of the audience, the band came
together without their instruments
and sang a short a cappella piece
before leaving the stage in front of an
audience expecting an encore that
would never come.
If Muse is reminiscent of the
operatic-guitar-rock half of Queen,
the other half, comprised of inspiring
