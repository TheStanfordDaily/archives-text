In her beautiful new musical
entitled "Pawn," Karmia Chan
Cao 'll explores the terror of
war and how one moment really
can change everything.
Sponsored by the Stanford
Theatre Activist Mobilization
Project (STAMP) and the Asian
American Theater Project (AATP),
this original piece of folk rock
music made its first public debut
while still in its very early stages
last May under the name
"Abraham Niu & the Friendly
Fires" at STAMP's "Spring into
Action Play Festival." Although at
this time it was just a simple read
ing of an unfinished script, it was
nonetheless well-received by its
audience, and after spending her
summer working on the piece,
Cao finalized "Pawn."
This haunting show tells the
story of an Asian-Canadian young
man named Abraham Niu (Alex
Kaneko 'l2) as he fights with the
American forces in Kandahar,
Afghanistan. When a life-threaten
ing situation arises, Niu finds him
self suspended in time in what is
called the "pawn shop of time,"
where he must make an impossi
ble decision regarding heroism
and death. The pawn shop itself is
not death and it is not life, it is not
even a place rather, it is an
elongated moment in our lives
where we meet our "couriers," or
those who lead us through life,
protecting us and serving as our
sense of intuition.
While there, Abraham is able
to spend time with his mother
(Sarah Guerrero '11), who shows
him the dark secrets of her past
while begging him not to take

himself away from her. Having
already lost her eldest son, Kai,
during the attacks on the World
Trade Center in 2001, and after
living through incredible hard
ships herself as a result of the
racial discrimination she faced for
being a Chinese immigrant,
Abraham's mother's character pro
vides a new definition of the word
u. »
terror.
Stepping away from our mod
ern understanding of the word
and the popular associations and
connotations that it raises for us
nowadays, this show examines
instead the meaning of the word
on a more personal level. Cao said
that one of her motivations in cre
ating the show was her desire "to
look at terrorism and counter-ter
rorism, and what is the difference
on the unit of a family."
"I just wanted to explore ter
ror in general, and talk about it,"
she added. "Terror long existed
before we defined it as this kind of
terror, and that normal, everyday
terror still exists for lots of people
who live in avid fear, constant fear
and that that needs to be taken
care of."
The heart-wrenching scenes
and songs shared between Niu and
his mother deal heavily with the
fear she has lived with her whole
life and her belief in a higher
power that has helped her through
even her darkest moments.
This was Cao's second origi
nal production. The first, entitled
"Forgetting Tiburon," debuted at
Stanford in April 2009. A pub-

musical and theatrical talents of
Kaneko and Guerrero, and the
