On Nov. 9, Stanford Lively
Arts will welcome Sankai
Juku, a Butoh-inspired
troupe based in Paris. With it
comes the Bay Area premiere of its
show, "Tobari (As if in an
Inexhaustible Flux)." Founder
Ushio Amagatsu leads the troupe

established in 1975 in an
astounding depiction of human
universality, a "primitive impulse"
binding together stories of mythol
ogy and fantasy.
The exploration of such
strange and diverse tensions should
not be surprising. Butoh, after all,

was an art form founded post-
World War 11, a breakaway from
existing forms of Japanese dance.
One of Butoh's founders, Tatsumi
Hijikata, desired the creation of a
profound dance form, one that did
not simply imitate Western styles
or classical Japanese musical

drama. Butoh thus explores the
taboo and the extreme, the psycho
logical and the physical. It ques
tions the status quo, and delves
deep into emotions that drive
human nature. Yet, as critic Mark
Holborn said, Butoh is defined by
its very evasion of definition: it has
no fixed style.
Taking elements from Butoh,
Sankai Juku performs in white
body make-up. Its all-male cast
wears robes, sarongs and shaven
heads, the simplicity of their cos
tuming underscoring the abstrac
tion and complexity of their pieces.
Huffington Post writer Jack
Schimmelman described watching
Sankai Juku's performances as lis
tening to the sound of breath, or
listening to infinity. In his words,
the troupe strips all accessories of
humanity. The audience begins
with nothing, but learns much in
the course of an evening of sad
ness, of anger, of elation, mixed
together in a melting pot of human
emotion.
Nov. 9's "Tobari" adheres to
the troupe's distinct approach to
performance. "Tobari" in Japanese
literally refers to a curtain. Yet,

the performance, which centers on
the central image of stars, deepens
its title's meaning. Founder
Amagatsu interprets the word
"tobari" as a figurative curtain, a
"border between day and night"
that challenges our notions of time.
He notes that we see stars in the
present tense, when in fact the
starlight originated millions of
light years ago. Deviating from
popularized notions of Butoh,
"Tobari" additionally uses bright
colors and variations of speed to
generate tensions between past and
present.
The complexity of time is not
the only richness in "Tobari's" fab
ric. Amagatsu further weaves into
Sankai Juku's performance his phi
losophy of maintaining ambiguity.
While he claims that it is a tenden
cy "very Japanese," the idea of gray
areas and paradoxes is a universal
one. Without attempting to pound
into the audience specific judg
ments or statements, Sankai Juku
presents us with philosophical dif
ficulties that have no answer. For


COURTESY SANKAI JUKU
one, Amagatsu suggests, our individual life
is limited and discontinuous, but life itself
is a continuity. Humans possess, then, both
eternity and impermanence, but how does
dance describe this? How can we conceptu
alize its consequences?
Impression, for Sankai Juku, is more
important than comprehension. In seven
scenes and 90 minutes, "Tobari (As if in an
Inexhaustible Flux)" certainly promises to
challenge our notions of time, space and

way of thinking.
Sankai Juku comes to Memorial
Auditorium on Tuesday, Nov. 9 at 8 p.m.
Tickets are $lO for Stanford students, $2B
- for adults.
