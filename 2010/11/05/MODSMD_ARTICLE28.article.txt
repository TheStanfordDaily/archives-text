Last Friday, the Department of
Art and Art History and the
Department of French and
Italian brought director Lucas
Belvaux and his latest French film,
"Rapt," to Stanford.
"Rapt" is a dark film about
Stanislas, a high-profile French
industrialist who is kidnapped and
held for a ransom too high for his
family to pay. As he suffers through
weeks as a hostage, his associates
and family live through the malign
ing press investigation of his
lifestyle. "Rapt" crosses from horror
to psychological thriller, and ulti
mately transforms into a melan
cholic and realistic tale of family
life.
This melange of genres, a risk
Belvaux takes with the confidence
of an experienced filmmaker secure
in his vision, marks "Rapt" with a
unique artistic touch, lending it a
depth not found in many "scary
movies" today. As we watch
Stanislas, played by the talented
and sullen Yvan Attal, deteriorate
under the oppressive and cruel
treatment of his captors, his once
fit body turns skeletal, his distin
guished features give way to sallow
skin, sunken eyes and emaciated
cheeks. The degeneration of his

body parallels the disintegration of
his public image, as his gambling
habits and mistresses revealed to
the audience in the opening scene,
but unknown to his family are
broadcast across France.
Paris itself lends a downcast
tone to the film's aesthetics. The
shots of the city are grey, almost
monochromatic, the sophisticated,
dour city casting an austere hue on
the visuals of Belvaux's work. The
film is also patently European in
that it makes no indulgences, as an
American film might. "Rapt" does
not pander to its audience, offering
no comedic relief and no breaks in
tension it pursues with a cool
and steady hand the dark impres
sion it intends to leave. "Rapt" is
not without its flaws, playing up
the terror and torture of a severed
finger with somewhat annoying
persistence, but these flaws are
overshadowed by the film's success
es. Delving deep into the psycholo
gy of Stanislas's female intimates,
from his wife, played by Anne
Consigny ("The Diving Bell and
the Butterfly"), to his mother,
played by Francoise Fabian, "Rapt"
offers particularly striking insight
into the weight carried by the
French matriarch.

The finest
moments of the
two-hour film come
at the end, as Belvaux
moves away from the nar
rative of Stanislas's capture
and lends his full attention to life
after unanticipated tragedy. "Rapt"
represents a manifestly European
evolution of the typical thriller or
horror film into something with far
more depth and, consequently,
weight. Leaving the film, which
ends on a somehow content
cliffhanger, it feels as though you
are leaving a contemplative and
interesting art exhibit, rather than a
cheap, mass-produced flick which
flies out of your mind as quickly as
it entered.
Belvaux achieves something
worth noting in "Rapt" and offers a
worthwhile artistic experience for
those interested in French culture,
those intrigued by European film
or those simply looking for a dark
movie with something more to
offer.
