Stanford Hip Hop Congress recently
released a compilation of some of
their new tracks, entitled "Cardinal
Mixtapes Volume 1." Filled with 17 tracks
of their work, this student effort is a strong
foray into the world of hip hop, with a few
minor hiccups. While low production qual
ity detracted from the feel of many of the
tracks, the CD proved that Hip Hop
Congress is passionate about music and has
some innovative art to share with the
world.
The mix tape by Stanford Hip Hop
Congress, a collaboration of student
emcees, includes Alvin "Allure" Addo 'l2,
Gautam "Reckonize" Sharma 'l2, Christian
"CSmooth" Smith 'l2, Mia "Lady
Renaissance" Shaw 'l2, Sam "ProfiT"
Lawrence 'l2, Alberto "FineSse" Guzman
'l3 and Doug Mills 'l3.
The most notable feature of the album
was the interesting, witty lyrics in the
songs. Some songs spoke about the party
ing side of Stanford life, such as "Booty," a
collaboration featuring several of the
album's artists. "The life of a Stanford stu
dent/I'll guess I'll say it/Party, party, party
'til we all get wasted/Shots, shots, shots till we
all butt naked/Ski trip stories that's all on
Facebook" drawls one of the collaborators,
offering a more lighthearted version of life
at Stanford.
Other songs revert to more general hip
hop fare, such as "Fall in Love" by Mills, "f
do anything I can to show you you're my
world/Nothing I'd rather do than spend time
with my girl", he croons, echoing the lines
of many a hip hop song devoted to love.
Some songs had truly odd lyrics, such as
Lady Renaissance's Glenwood Remix. She
raps "Lady please/Compared to you I'm
diarrhea, I just keep it flowing, now there's
an idea", definitely a bizarre way to talk
about creating lyrics.
The background beats were hit or
miss, with some tracks being lifted by
exceptional beats and others being dragged

down by an unprofessional, boring back
ground. Tracks like "A New Day," with vio
lin undertones, "Tomorrow," with ukulele
and "Sunshine," with its echoing back
ground effect, were enjoyable to listen to
and helped enhance the lyrics. Other
tracks, like "Here We Stand" and "What
They Say" used backgrounds that were
unexceptional and almost empty sounding,
taking away from the songs.
The quality of the production varied
over the album, affecting how good the
tracks were. "Booty," "Drop the Match" and
"They Know," for example, had decent pro
duction and background that came togeth
er to make tracks that sound almost radio
ready. Some tracks also made use of auto
tune, which definitely helped them sound
more current. However, the rest seemed a
bit rough around the edges, making it obvi
ous that it was student work, not a profes
sional album.
Despite less-than-perfect production,
the album managed to showcase some real
talent through a few quality songs.
"Tomorrow" by FineSse, combining a chill
ukulele-infused background beat with mel
low lyrics, was an album standout, while
"Drop the Match" by Reckonize and the
Produca mixed a cool beat with climbing
background notes and authentic-sounding
flows to make an intense track. "They
Know," by ProfiT, CSmooth and Allure, uti
lized super-fast lyrics, slower melodic cho
ruses and a solid backbone to create a res
onating hip hop anthem.
Cardinal Mixtapes Volume 1 is a solid
start for a group of talented young hip hop
artists here at Stanford. Utilizing clever
lyrics, fun beats and original ideas, Stanford
Hip Hop Congress overcomes mediocre
production to make a decent album.
