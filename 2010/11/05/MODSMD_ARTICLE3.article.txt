# CARD FACES ARIZONA IN CLASH OF ONE-LOSS TEAMS
## 
### KABIR SAWHNEY MANAGING EDITOR 
It's time to make a statement.
The No. 13 Stanford football team
will play one of its most hyped games of
the season on Saturday, as it welcomes
No. 15 Arizona to Stanford Stadium. With
identical 4-1 conference records, the Cardi
nal and the Wildcats are tied for second in the
Pac-10. The winner of this weekend's game
will hold on to hopes for a BCS bowl berth
while the loser will see its Rose Bowl aspira
tions extinguished.
Despite its high national ranking, Stanford
(7-1, 4-1 Pac-10) lacks a true "statement"
win this season. None of its seven wins
has come against an opponent cur
rently ranked in the top 25 of the
BCS standings. Meanwhile, Stan
ford's only loss came against Ore
gon, currently the top-ranked team
in the country.
The Wildcats (7-1, 4-1)
achieved a big win in the third
week of the season, taking down then-No. 9 lowa, 34-27. How
ever, Arizona has not looked as sharp in Pac-10 play. It fell to
Oregon State at home, 29-27, in early October, barely edged out
a weak California team, 10-9, and struggled last week at UCLA
before pulling out a 29-21 win.
Stanford is coming off a big 41-0 win last weekend in Seattle
over Washington. The Cardinal looked dominant on both sides

NOTESI After routing the Huskies in Washington,
the Cardinal will likely face a much tougher test
this weekend when it hosts Arizona in a clash of
the Pac-lO's one-loss teams. The Wildcats' only
defeat this season came in a 29-27 nailbiter
against Oregon State, and they've won three
straight games since.
