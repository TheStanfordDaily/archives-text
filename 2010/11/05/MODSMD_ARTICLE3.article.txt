# CARD FACES ARIZONA IN CLASH OF ONE-LOSS TEAMS
## 
### KABIR SAWHNEY MANAGING EDITOR 
It's time to make a statement.
The No. 13 Stanford football team
will play one of its most hyped games of
the season on Saturday, as it welcomes
No. 15 Arizona to Stanford Stadium. With
identical 4-1 conference records, the Cardi
nal and the Wildcats are tied for second in the
Pac-10. The winner of this weekend's game
will hold on to hopes for a BCS bowl berth
while the loser will see its Rose Bowl aspira
tions extinguished.
Despite its high national ranking, Stanford
(7-1, 4-1 Pac-10) lacks a true "statement"
win this season. None of its seven wins
has come against an opponent cur
rently ranked in the top 25 of the
BCS standings. Meanwhile, Stan
ford's only loss came against Ore
gon, currently the top-ranked team
in the country.
The Wildcats (7-1, 4-1)
achieved a big win in the third
week of the season, taking down then-No. 9 lowa, 34-27. How
ever, Arizona has not looked as sharp in Pac-10 play. It fell to
Oregon State at home, 29-27, in early October, barely edged out
a weak California team, 10-9, and struggled last week at UCLA
before pulling out a 29-21 win.
Stanford is coming off a big 41-0 win last weekend in Seattle
over Washington. The Cardinal looked dominant on both sides

NOTESI After routing the Huskies in Washington,
the Cardinal will likely face a much tougher test
this weekend when it hosts Arizona in a clash of
the Pac-lO's one-loss teams. The Wildcats' only
defeat this season came in a 29-27 nailbiter
against Oregon State, and they've won three
straight games since.



of the ball; the offense rolled up
yards seemingly at will, while the de
fense bounced back from a string of
poor performances to suffocate
Husky quarterback Jake Locker
and the Washington running game.
Overall, Stanford is third in the Pac
-10 in scoring defense, giving up 21.3
points per game.
Stanford redshirt sophomore
quarterback Andrew Luck contin
ued his strong play against Washing
ton, going for 192 yards on 19-26
passing and adding five carries for
92 yards on the ground. Luck cur
rently ranks first among Pac-10
quarterbacks in both pass efficiency
and total offense, and thanks largely
to his efforts, Stanford is fifth na
tionally in scoring offense.
Last weekend against Washing
ton, Luck made more plays with his
legs than usual. The Cardinal called
several plays that were designed as
runs for Luck, or option runs involv
ing Luck and sophomore running
back Stepfan Taylor.
"We'd like to mix in some of
those good [plays]," said Stanford
head coach Jim Harbaugh.
Of course, the Wildcats have a
star quarterback of their own in jun
ior quarterback Nick Foles. While
Luck leads a talented crop of Pac-10
quarterbacks, Foles is not far be
hind, ranking third in the conference
in pass efficiency and second in pass
ing yards per game.
While Foles has not played since
suffering a knee injury three weeks
ago, his backup, junior Matt Scott,
has played extremely well in his ab
sence, Scott threw for 319 yards last
week against UCLA, and has accu
mulated over 600 yards of offense in
his last two starts. Unlike Foles, who
is more of a traditional pocket pass
er, Scott also has the ability to make
plays with his legs he ran 12 times
for 71 yards against the Bruins, and
went for 65 yards on seven carries
against Washington a week earlier.
Arizona head coach Mike Stoops
has indicated that Foles is healthy
and ready to start this weekend, but
Harbaugh is hedging his bets.
"Both those guys bring some dif
ferences, but there are a lot of simi
larities between the two of them,"
Harbaugh said. "We don't know
who's starting or who's going to be
playing the most in the game. Right
now, we're assuming it's Foles, but
we'll see."
While the quarterback matchup
is compelling, another significant
storyline is the showdown between
Arizona's defense and the Stanford
offense. The Wildcats lead the Pac
-10 in scoring defense and rushing
defense and rank second in pass de
fense. Nationally, Arizona is seventh
in scoring defense.

Arizona's defensive line is espe
cially impressive, boasting two top
tier defensive ends in seniors Ricky
Elmore and Brooks Reed. Elmore
leads the Pac-10 in sacks with eight
for the season (an average of one
per game), while Reed is second in
the conference with 5.5 sacks. Fresh
man defensive tackle Justin Wash
ington has added four sacks.
That line will present the tough
est challenge that the Stanford of
fensive line has seen this season. To
date, the unit has lived up to its
billing as one of the best in the coun
try. Luck has been sacked only three
times all season, and the line has
opened up big holes for Taylor and
the running game.
However, while the Arizona de
fense is strong up front, it has some
weaknesses in the secondary. The
Wildcats' Sept. 18 game against
lowa revealed their weaknesses in

passing defense, as Hawkeye quar
terback Ricky Stanzi threw for 278
yards on 18-33 passing and posted
three touchdowns against one in
terception. The Arizona pass de
fense also came up short in the
Wildcats' only loss of the season to
Oregon State. Beaver quarterback
Ryan Katz shredded the Cats for
393 yards on 30-42 passing, and the
Beavers prevailed despite having
star running back Jacquizz
Rodgers bottled up for 83 yards on
25 carries.
Meanwhile, the Stanford defense
will look to repeat its performance
from last weekend, when it shut out
Washington on the road. Going into
the game, the unit was coming off a
series of weak performances, head
lined by giving up three fourth
quarter touchdowns to lowly Wash
ington State. However, the Cardinal
is eager to prove that its perform

ance against the Huskies was not an
aberration.
"This defense is more talented
than what we have shown the past
couple of weeks, and we made it
extra motivation to get back on
track and show the Pac-10 that this
defense is a force," said sophomore
linebacker Shayne Skov after the
Washington game.
The Card will continue to rely on
a quartet of talented linebackers
Skov, senior Owen Marecic, redshirt
sophomore Chase Thomas and red
shirt junior Thomas Keiser to
keep pressure on the Wildcat back
field and force Foles into mistakes.
Stanford will also look for a
strong performance from its defen
sive line, which was instrumental in
shutting out Washington last week.
Redshirt senior defensive end Brian
Bulcke and senior nose tackle Sione
Fua kept the Huskies' offensive line

engaged all game, which freed up
the linebackers and defensive end
Matt Masifilo to make plays. Masifi
lo finished the game with two sacks
and five tackles overall, while
Thomas added nine tackles and
Skov checked in with eight of his
own.
Like Arizona, the Stanford sec
ondary has not played well so far
this season. Fifth-year senior corner
back Richard Sherman and his
counterpart, junior Johnson
Bademosi, have been routinely beat
on coverages. However, the unit
should benefit from having junior
safely Delano Howell at full health.
Stanford will take on Arizona in
a high-profile Pac-10 battle on Sat
urday at Stanford Stadium. Kickoff
is scheduled for 5 p.m.

Stepfan Taylor, holding the ball above, dives for a first-half touchdown during the Cardinal's 41-0 rout of the Huskies last week. The sophomore running
back has been critical to the Cardinal's success on the ground this season, with a team-leading 728 net yards and an average of 91 yards per
game.
