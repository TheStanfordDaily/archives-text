The Internet can be a bad friend to
emerging bands. They post their music
on MySpace, attract some attention,
play some shows, but by the time they roll out
a record, people have moved on to the Next Big
Thing. Once in a while, there comes a band
that explodes onto the blogosphere and makes
it out alive. One such example is Warpaint. An
all-female quartet hailing from L.A., the band
managed to not only attract attention with
their 2008 EP, "Exquisite Corpse," but retain it
up to the release of "The Fool." Anything but
foolish, the album manages to build a consis
tent dreamlike atmosphere through swirling
guitars and reverberating vocals. An expertly
mixed record, "The Fool" is not a light album.
On the contrary, the instrumentation is fog-like
and thick, the vocals tempting and unsettling.
Listen if you dare.
"Set Your Arms Down" opens with a halt
ing bass line and moans in the background.
Suddenly, high-pitched, falsetto vocals rise out
of the gloom. "We walk through fire/My love is
your flashlight" sings Emily Kokal. The paral
lelism drawn between the lyrics and the song is
palpable: Kokal's voice leads us through the
swirling, foggy instrumentation, made up of
steady guitar lines, syncopated drum beats and
desperate hammerings layered on slow, ambi
ent vocals. The beat becomes grinding and
steady toward the end, while the vocals howl
away. Never has there been a more ominous
entrance.
"Warpaint" is the crown jewel of the
album. After 15 seconds of silence at the begin
ning, a humming can be heard faintly rising.
An arpeggiated guitar chord comes on, the
drums are added to the line and finally bass
and second guitar complete the picture. The
sound of the drums is slightly warlike, very
much like an amped-up marching band. The
vocals, on the other hand, are hard to discern
and emotionally flat, which makes them slight
ly tormenting: they acquire a strange distancing
sound effect during the bridge. Coupled with

the vocal play between Kokal, Theresa Wayman
and Jenny Lee Lindberg, the song becomes an
unsettling, stunning affair.
The apparent single is "Undertow," a bass
driven, dreamy track. While the three voices are
soft, they sound dangerous, not harmless.
"Why do you want to blame me for your trou
bles?/You better learn your lesson yourself,"
Lindberg sings. The production on the track is
incredible: drums burst in and out, the voices
swirl in and out on different channels and the
guitar sound, although beneath low-fi, is mes
merizing in its artistry. Although less unsettling
than the last track, "Undertow" gives the
impression that these girls are not to be messed
with.
The following track, "Bees," is a little bit
more upbeat. Percussion beats off a drum pad,
along with the actual crashing cymbals from
resident drummer Stella Mozgawa, give the
song an extra layer of rhythm, which tones
down the swirling, ethereal sound of the guitars
and vocals. "Baby" is another track that deviates
from the general ambiance of the album. A
mostly acoustic track, the guitar and harmo
nized vocals sound surprisingly simple for the
band, mostly because their lyrics are clear and
distinct, in contrast to the heavily veiled vocals
on the rest of the album.
By the end of the ninth and final track,
"Lissie's Heart Murmur," the sound of the band
has become indelible in the listener's mind.
Their misty, ambient vocals and flowing guitar
line are coupled with a lazy piano line.
Suddenly, the dream world, painstakingly built
throughout the whole album, comes to a para
lyzing stop. The vocals are swirling, the cymbals
are crashing, a single piano key is pressed and
the Warpaint dream, foggy and trancelike, dis
solves instantly. No soft fadeouts or muffled
endings. Just what one expects of the Next Big
Thing.
