Condoleezza Rice's recently
published book,
"Extraordinary, Ordinary People"
carries the subtitle "A Memoir of
Family" an apt way to describe a
work by a major political figure that
evades pressing and contentious
political questions. The memoir fol
lows the lives of Condoleezza Rice
and her parents, Angelena Ray Rice
and John Wesley Rice Jr., until just
before the beginning of George W.
Bush's first term as president, paying
particularly close attention to race,
education and the central role that
Rice's parents played in her growth.
Rice begins the memoir with an
overview of her family history and
the origins of the Rices' dedication to
"educational evangelism" the
founding of schools and faith in the
power of education. Both parents
were teachers in segregated
Birmingham, where the family lived
until Rice was a teenager; her father
also served as a Presbyterian preach
er. Rice recounts her upbringing in
Birmingham against the backdrop of
the civil rights movement and efforts
to integrate the segregated South.
After moving to Tuscaloosa for sev
eral years, the Rices relocated to
Denver in order for her father to
work at the University of Denver.
Rice herself obtained her undergrad
uate degree and her doctorate from
the same school. Her key decision to
stop studying music and begin
studying Soviet politics ultimately

led to Stanford, the National Security
Council and her position of secretary
of state.
Rice is at her most compelling
when she describes her early life in
Birmingham and the monumental
impact of the civil rights movement.
Beyond the massive changes brought
about through the Civil Rights Act
and the Voting Rights Act, she had
personal connections to many
important activists as a result of her
father's involvement in preaching.
She also adeptly shows how her fam
ily's experiences in Birmingham both
before and during the civil rights
movement shaped her political
beliefs, describing the roots of her
views in such away that even those
who oppose her politics can under
stand her ideology's origins.
What's curious about the book,
however, is what Rice omits: George
W. Bush's presidency, which began
after her father's death. Although it is
a logical place to end this "memoir of
family," at times it seems more like
an easy way out, enabling Rice to
dodge more difficult questions about
her roles as national security adviser
and as secretary of state. Her most
controversial decisions in the mem
oir may well take place during her
time as provost at Stanford from
1993 to 1999, clearly outside the
realm of politics.
Yet it is Rice's choice to avoid the

most hotly debated parts of her
career that also makes her a surpris
ingly relatable narrator. The book
reads quickly, thanks in no small part
to her efforts to inject humor into
her writing. On one particularly
memorable occasion, she refers to
her disbelief during her first meeting
in the Oval Office with George H. W.
Bush as a "Condi-in-Wonderland
moment." Although generally an
asset to the narrative, her sense of
humor does have the occasional
effect of confusing the overall tone of
the memoir, which never strikes a
perfect balance between the serious
and the light-hearted.
A fundamentally political book
would have been bolder than this
one, but it certainly would have had
the adverse effect of limiting the
memoir's audience to those who
share Rice's conservative views. Even
the brief section of the book describ
ing her involvement in George Bush's
2000 presidential campaign is
remarkably weak in contrast with the
memoir as a whole. "Extraordinary,
Ordinary People" may not be a mas
terpiece and it leaves critical ques
tions about Rice's career unanswered
but in the end, it does achieve its
goal, offering a largely relatable, open
and intriguing glimpse into the early
life of a powerful and influential
woman.
