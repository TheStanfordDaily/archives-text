Global climate change, pollu
tion, inequality, warfare. The
list of today's plaguing prob
lems goes on and on. When present
ed with such a huge stinking banquet
of the world's ugliness, most people
simply turn their noses away, unable
to gather the courage to face the
intimidating task of coming up with
some plausible solutions. However,
"Humanity on a Tightrope:
Thoughts on Empathy, Family and
Big Changes for a Viable Future"
makes a valiant attempt at addressing
these formidable world issues from
an interesting, but maybe too idealis
tic, point of view.
"Humanity on a Tightrope," to
be released on Nov. 16, is a rich book
that delves into the root of the
world's most pressing problems: the
lack of empathy in mankind. The
whole book revolves around this cen
tral idea of how we human beings as

a whole global family should develop
more empathy toward each other to
ensure a sustainable future.
The authors are familiar faces
on campus. Paul Ehrlich is the Bing
Professor of Population Studies and
a senior fellow at the Woods Institute
for the Environment, and psycholo
gist Robert Evan Ornstein Ph.D. '6B
is a former Stanford human biology
professor. Together, they present the
pressing situation in which the world
is in now: bleak and bloody history,
tension between religious groups and
a general indifference or even strong
antagonism toward "them," people
who are not part of "us."
The book starts with the story
implied by the title. Ehrlich and
Ornstein depict how audiences usu
ally feel anxious when watching the
tightrope performers perform in cir
cuses, because we all have these "mir
ror neurons" in our brains to
empathize with other people, to
feel what others are going
through.
Thus, as Ehrlich and Ornstein
claim, mankind has the

potential to have more empathy for
each other. But in order to reach this
potential, they argue, we will have to
cross the immense cultural gaps first.
Ehrlich and Ornstein first demon
strate empathy's path of growth by
recounting the history of human
evolution before they present a step
by-step process to discuss possible
solutions.
Using psychological studies and
experiments, Ehrlich and Ornstein
make their serious arguments more
understandable and engaging to a
non-academic audience. Many stud
ies are quite interesting, and when
the authors break down their seem
ingly impossible argument into more
comprehensible small parts, the
argument starts to make more sense.
With this, Ehrlich and Ornstein
expose readers to some mind-blow
ing aspects of cultures in the hidden
corners of the world. They are also
able to draw creative connections
between things with rather obscure
relations, such as the Internet's ability
to spread or undermine empathy.
The surprising experimental

results indeed succeed in capturing
the reader's attention, but in the end,
the book is only partially convincing
because the ideal answer presented
simply doesn't match up to the scope
of the issue the book is trying to deal
with. Even Ehrlich and Ornstein, the
authors themselves, freely admit that
"we're discussing what is required to
reach sustainability, not what will be
easy or even possible."
There are, then, two ways of
interpreting the book. Either you can
see the book as pervaded with the
sense of hopelessness, since even
when the most cheerful human

empathy experiment results are illus
trated, we are reminded that humans
are still so far away from stopping
global warming, from maintaining
world peace or from addressing
extreme wealth inequality. Or, you
can view the book as an outline of
the best way of living, the happiest
way of living, because we might just
have been suppressing our natural
sense of empathy for others all along
in the capitalist society. Maybe, if we
do have more empathy for others, we
will be happier.
However, the decision is ulti
mately up to the reader. With a smart
pun of humanity teetering on the
tightrope just as the tightrope per
former, Ehrlich and Ornstein show
case their beliefs in the super-power
of empathy that it can save
humanity and save the world we live
in.
