# Ethereal zombies take over TV

The undisputed winners of
television's Halloweek were as
similar in subject matter as
they were distinct in presentation:
the zombie movie parody episode of
"Community" (yup, still champi
oning it and can feel justified now
that it'll run the full season) and the
series premiere of Frank Darabont's
foray into tragic zombie apocalypse,
AMC's "The Walking Dead." The
premiere, cashing in on Comic-Con
hype, wooed 5.3 million viewers
Sunday night and has at least one of
them hooked (... me).
When I first read the pilot for
this show, I was both inspired by the
audacity of adapting the series of
graphic novels and confident in my
imagination of the show's aesthetic.
My ideas about setting, music and
action sequences all proved, in
observation of the final product,
unimaginative. Ironically, or maybe
just in my opinion, this is one of the
themes of the show's first episode,
the psychology and subsequent
destruction of preconceived notions.
The opening lines, cautiously spoken
by protagonist and hunky sheriff
Rick Grimes, question the silhouette
of a short figure in pink slippers,

"Little girl?only for her to turn
around and reveal a wan zombie
child. He urges himself, "Don't be
afraid," but against all of our best
judgment we are.
Initial comparisons to HBO's
"True Blood" are eradicated within
the first minute of the pilot. Though
I had imagined a much more
Southern, visibly devastated land
scape, Darabont has directed an
eerily normal suburban existence. In
fact, this could be any American
suburb. The emphasis on humanity
and meditation is executed by deli
cate, thoughtful cinematography
that is not afraid simultaneously to
turn the eye of the camera away
from the obviously compelling, a
zombie corpse for example, and to
milk the smallest, most affecting
details. At times, I was frustrated
with the "300"-esque blood-splatter
slow mo, but ultimately the harmo
ny of visual composition, score and
sparse dialogue was truly beautiful.
In a television universe stuffed
with wordy, pithy comedies and
period dramas, "The Walking Dead"
is a breath of fresh air (how inappro
priate is it to describe such a great
show with a cliche? My apologies).

Silence during the ever-valuable tele
vision minutes is a rarity that, when
done well (see Buffy's "Hush"),
endears the audience to the charac
ters and place. Here, the artistic team
marries Bernard Herrmann-esque
suspenseful score to current hipster
ballads; by far my favorite sequence
of the episode comes when, in the
final pan out, zombies attack a horse
corpse and an army tank side-by
side to one such ballad.
The mutt-ish genre of the show
enables such unexpected combina
tions and suggests a compelling sea
son. We get a bit of "28 Days Later,"
a dash of Western and a general
ladle of horror all in one hour. Ah

yes, the horror. I'm unable to do the
makeup justice in words, so I would
encourage you to watch the episode
(in case you weren't sold already) to
witness how chillingly the layers of
the human body are peeled back on
the zombies. These fixtures of the
horror genre are imbued with
humanity throughout, from the
amputated woman dragging herself
across a field to an infected wife and
mother.
The details of the disease have
yet to be fleshed out (ha), but we
know there are factions of survivors,
nomads and loners navigating the
unpredictable topography of zombie
mobs. The comparative narratives of
these groups, all centered on families
fractured by the infection, present a
study in human interaction.
Fundamental ethical questions of

trust, justice and alliance are raised
in various contexts (some even
including zombies) throughout the
episode, pointing to the show's alle
gorical ambitions.
This is a show that could burn
out after one season, but I expect
that, at least for a short period of
time, these 45 minutes will inspire
you to think, create, write and imag
ine.
