Stanford hosted the "food sum
mit" this week to discuss
national issues related to food,
so it seemed like an opportune time
to review Pluto's, a restaurant striv
ing to provide healthful options for
the busy consumer.
Pluto's has a casual and friendly
atmosphere. The decor matches the
vibe with a comfortable setting that
allows the restaurant to move quick
ly without overwhelming. Pluto's is
best as a quick option with friends

for lunch or dinner.
With an almost entirely cus
tomizable menu, Pluto's is difficult
to rate. In one sense, it is hard to
miss completely because you choose
what goes into your meal. On the
other hand, it is also difficult to pro
vide a memorable experience
because Pluto's becomes similar to
eating at home, at least when you've
just been to the grocery store.
The centerpiece of Pluto's is the
salad bar. The ordering process is

not particularly intuitive, but even
tually you will figure out that you
can choose the size, the leafy base
and up to seven toppings. The addi
tional ingredients are fairly standard
but can be augmented by an option
al cut of meat or hearty vegetarian
offering and dressing.
These meat and vegetarian
options are not particularly interest
ing. The tri-tip is not sufficiently
tender and can be chewy at times.
The chicken is well-cooked but not

particularly flavorful. The grilled
Portobello mushroom is a nice
option but can be easily over
whelmed by the bread of a sandwich
or drowned out by the other ingre
dients in a salad.
The bread selection is also dis
appointing. The focaccia is forget
table, the ciabatta can be a bit too
tough and the whole wheat falls
completely flat in both taste and tex
ture. The bread is almost certainly
store-bought or "par baked" (about
80 percent baked in a factory, frozen,
shipped and then finished in-store),
and the sandwiches in general suffer
due to the lackluster options.
Pluto's offers a series of sides to
accompany your salad or sandwich,
generally characterized by extrater

restrial names such as "Orbital
Onion Rings." At least the
"Mushrooms of the Moment" ended
up tasting like a standard mushroom
sauce, and it is unlikely that any of
these sides are actually out of this
world (excuse the pun).
Pluto's mission statement is very
clear provide an inexpensive, fast
and relatively healthy experience
somewhere "between fast food and
full service restaurants." However, it's
difficult to claim that in between
there is "vast nothingness" with, for
example, Sprout Cafe just down the
street. Pluto's can certainly deliver a
wholesome and filling meal on a
student budget. Still, with nothing
unique on the menu and some legit
imate competition in the same
niche, it ends up in the "middle of
the road."
