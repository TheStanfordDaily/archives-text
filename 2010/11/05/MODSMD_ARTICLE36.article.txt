## ROXY SASS Roxy Sass looks for elusive e-love 
### â€“ roxy SASS contact roxy: intermission@Stanforddaily. com 
The World Wide Web is a
tool not Roxy's favorite
kind of tool, but a close
second. And more importantly,
it's a very useful one for flirting.
While some traditionalists may
moan and groan about the tech
led death of interpersonal rela
tionships, Roxy would rather
moan and groan in the company
of other sexy people, no matter
how she meets them.
The ends justify the means,
Roxy argues: as long as it leads to
a fully in-person physical "ren
dezvous," she's all in favor for
using e-methods to flirt. Roxy
gives these methods (and you,
hopefully) a rundown:
Texting
Brevity is the soul of wit, and
concision is the soul of sexy. Why
say more when saying less implies
both mysterious seduction and
strong grammar skills? Roxy
doesn't need a novel of your day
when she booty-texts you. Just a
"Yes, ma'am and I'll bring the
cuffs" will more than suffice. And
as for sexting: it's just more fun to
say dirty talk out loud. There's no
good way, as of yet, to convey
"sexy voice" via text, although
Roxy is optimistic about the
future of technology.
Facebook
Roxy is overwhelmed by the
flirtations options: a subtle, old
school poke in the hopes it'll turn
into a real poking session? The
post-drunk makeout friend
request? Tagging your new crush
as a sexy object in a photo?
Maybe just a simple "like"? In all
situations, though, Roxy knows
best to keep her provocative
exchanges to private messages,
not walls. No one wants to see
you bragging about your new
lover, and more importantly,
broadcasting to the world that

you're anything less than a free
agent just closes off other oppor
tunities.

Whew. Roxy still gets a little
flushed when she recalls the heat
ed e-flirts she shared with
"Boysenberry" the other night. At
Coupa: Male, Brunette. Tall,
handsome, looks like you'd know
how to tell a good joke. Roxy sees
you reading her column. If you're
willing to keep her identity a
secret, she'll show you more than
just a little to like.
Twitter
Twitter? Roxy barely knows
her! But she's thinking that might
make it even more thrilling.
Would you like to meet @roxys
place? On a somewhat related
note, Roxy has always bemoaned
the fact that the past tense of "to
tweet" somehow became "tweet
ed" and not "twat."

Roxy's new pickup line is
telling people she voted them as
"Definitely!" The site, sadly, is

highly ineffective for send
ing a flirty sentiment to
someone in particular, but
Roxy's all for raising incen
tives for sexier profile pic
tures. Who needs a picture
of you and your eight hall
mate bffls? Bikini pic or it
didn't happen.
