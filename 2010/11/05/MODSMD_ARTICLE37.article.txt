## Lanvin for H&M 
### â€” merissa REN contact merissa: merissar@stanford. edu 
For me, Lanvin is luxury. Not
because it is one of the oldest
established couture houses in
Paris, founded in 1909 (the same
year as Chanel). Not because its flag
ship boutique on Rue du Faubourg
Saint-Honore is breathtaking. Not
even because of how it feels, the
instant transportation to the interior
of a jewelry box and being beheld by
the critical eyes of reserved shop
keepers.
No, Lanvin impresses by how
the actual clothes feel and fit, the
craftsmanship, the timelessness.
Lanvin is, and has always been, fun
damentally about women.
Historically the logo is a mother and
daughter, representing clothes for
women that will be passed down
and coveted, transcending trend;
everlasting and precious. Lanvin is
the draping, the fabric, the tailoring.
Since 2001, under Alber Elbaz
as creative director, Lanvin has
brought all focus back to clothes for
women. He is charming, cuddly,
bespectacled and bow-tied and
absolutely genius. Elbaz loves
women utterly and completely, as his
muse and as his artistic inspiration,
and women love him.
He may be less glamorous and
conceptual than other, more diffi
cult-to-wear designers because his
passion is, above all else, making
women feel beautiful. He doesn't
care for pushing boundaries, making
statements or innovation for the
sake of innovation; he creates what
women want season after season.

And soon his fans will be able
to purchase his aesthetic with
Lanvin's new collection for H&M.
Lanvin is the perfect fit for
H&M because of Elbaz. As he put it
himself, this project is all about
"translating the dream of luxury."
The universal factor that ties the lan
guage of Lanvin proper to this col
lection is Elbaz's design philosophy.
The new collection is about
clothes to fit women's lives. Instead
of diluting Lanvin for the masses,
these are dresses designed for
women not only the ones that
have exorbitant amounts of money.
Oftentimes collaborations like this
become generic, polyester messes,
but anchoring this collection are
quintessentially Lanvin-style ele
ments that make this capsule collec
tion successful.
The focus on skin in his most
recent show, spring-summer 2011, is
reinterpreted here in the nude
scoop-neck dresses. Throughout the
whole collection, the silhouettes of
his spring-summer 2010 line featur
ing dramatic one-shoulder ruffles
and asymmetric gathering showcases
his craftsmanship and attention to
each proportion on pleat and drape.
The heels from last spring are also
redone here with satin ankle straps
instead of leather. Some of his other
signatures also make it to H&M, like
his childlike illustrations and love of
elbow-length Audrey Hepburn
leather gloves.
Elbaz is also known for well
executed costume jewelry, which
makes it to the H&M in aesthetic, if
not with real pearls.
Come Nov. 23, you can find me
in a tent in Union Square, ready to
get as close to Lanvin as my budget
will allow.
