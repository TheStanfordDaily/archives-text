NO. 13 STANFORD (7-1,4-1 PAC-10] US. NO. 15 ARIZONA (7-1,4-1 PAC-10]

KABIR SAWHNEY
STANFORD 35, ARIZONA 27: While both Stanford and Arizona boast
identical 7-1 records, the Cardinal has been by far the more consistent of the two
teams. The Wildcats won a big nonconference game over lowa, but lost to Oregon
State and barely squeaked by Cal. Meanwhile, Stanford has steadily shown im
provement, highlighted by its pummeling of Washington last week. Even with quar
terback Nick Foles returning for the Wildcats, I feel like the Cardinal will continue
its upward trajectory. The Stanford offensive line will bottle up Ricky Elmore and
Brooks Reed, and while the Cardinal defense won't play quite as well as it did
against the Huskies, it will be enough to pull out the win.

ZACH ZIMMERMAN
STANFORD 41, ARIZONA 33: Two weeks ago, I would have predicted a
worse outcome for the Cardinal. However, after the two-week absence of Ari-
A zona quarterback Nick Foles due to injury and Stanford's most dominant per
-7 formance of the season last week, I think Andrew Luck and his offense will
prevail in a shootout. The one question mark lies in Stanford's secondary which
will be tested far more this week than it was by an inept Husky passing attack.
Stanford should jump out to a big lead early but don't be surprised if the Wildcats
make a game of it late in the second half. In the end, though, the Cardinal will pre
vail.

JACOB JAFFE
STANFORD 37, ARIZONA 24: Despite its superb stats coming into the
game, the Arizona defense will not be able to contain Stanford's extremely well
balanced offense. The Cardinal offensive line will be able to neutralize defensive
ends Ricky Elmore and Brooks Reed, and the underrated Stanford running game
will do more than just keep the linebackers honest. The Wildcats will be able to
move the ball against the Cardinal, though, whether quarterback Nick Foles is fully
healthy or not. Stanford will hold a one-possession lead for a good portion of the
game before the defense forces a big turnover late, icing the victory.
