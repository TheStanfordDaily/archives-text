## LOCAL Bay Area taxis charge up 
### CASSANDRA FELICIANO DESK EDITOR 
Bay Area taxi cabs are taking a dif
ferent turn in 2011. The cities of San
Francisco and San Jose have partnered
with Better Place, an electric mobility
service provider in Palo Alto, to con
struct four switch stations for a fleet of
up to 70 plug-in taxis, according to an
announcement by San Francisco
Mayor Gavin Newsom on Oct. 27.
The three-year pilot program stems
from a collaborative project between
San Jose, San Francisco and Oakland to
make the Bay Area "the EV [electric
vehicle] capital of the world," said Jeff
Janssen, senior policy advisor to San
Jose Mayor Chuck Reed.
Debuting in 2008, the Bay Area Cli
mate Collaborative has garnered $44
million in funds from several sources,
including the Metropolitan Trans
portation Commission (MTC), in
order to implement four EV projects
across the nine counties of the Bay
Area region.
The group's first step is to educate
people about the significant green ben

efits of EVs, and this particular pro
gram will receive $7 million of MTC
funds and $lOO,OOO from San Francisco.
Janssen said Better Place will be match
ing the MTC contributions with $8 mil
lion, although the company's spokes
woman, Julie Mullins, denied the re
lease of any specific amount.
Since cab drivers cannot stop to
physically plug in and recharge, each
participating city will have two battery
switch stations and six taxis in phase
one, followed by 67 more vehicles in
phase two. Janssen said a fifth station
may be deployed in the Peninsula,
close to Better Place headquarters.
"[We want] to prove that you can
use electric vehicles for everyday use,
and nobody drives more than a cab
driver," Janssen said.
Because taxi cabs hold the record
for the largest carbon footprint,
Mullins said, this vehicle segment acts
as the best educational catalyst. Ac
cording to research conducted by Bet
ter Place, although there are fewer cabs
than personal cars on the roads, cab
drivers cover an average of 90,000
miles per year, approximately nine

times more than most drivers, said
Mullins.
While the Better Place taxi venture
will be the first of its kind in the U.S., the
company has already implemented
similar programs in Israel, Denmark
and most recently in Japan, where taxis
make up two percent of traffic but 20
percent of carbon emissions.
"We were invited by the Japanese
government two years ago to start the
project there, to show research technol
ogy to the Japanese automaker com
munity," Mullins said. "They were so
impressed that they invited us back."
In fact, Better Place has been so suc
cessful at electrifying a city's fleet of
taxis, the company is also bring electric
taxis to Australia at the end of next
year.
But these vehicles are green in other
ways as well they can save cab com
panies money. EVs cost 3 cents per mile
to operate compared to 13 cents per
mile for a gas-fueled taxi, according to a
statement by Melanie Nutter, environ
ment director of San Francisco.
"If you're looking at the price per
mile for gasoline versus the price per

mile for electricity, it's substantially dif
ferent, especially when you're filling up
with a full tank of gas two or three times
a day," Mullins said.
Moreover, if you are a driver in San
Jose, having an electric car could help
drum up business. The city will be pro
viding additional airport permits to
companies that have EVs, which will
allow more taxi cabs to operate at the
airport.
"In San Jose we don't have a lot of
taxi traffic," Janssen said. "Our biggest
source of traffic for cabs is at the airport
so the permit will become a valuable in
centive."
Although Mullins said the project is
in its latter stages finalizing partner
ships with automakers, battery
providers and the like she declined
to include specific details about the list
of prospective companies, except to
confirm a partnership with Yellow Cab
to supply the drivers. But Mullins is
confident that decision will be made in
time for its official debut late 2011.
