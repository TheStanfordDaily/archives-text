## Faculty hear update on Stanford v.Roche Lawsuit is to protect princple, not being in money, says Etchemendy 
### ELIZABETH TITUS EDITOR IN CHIEF 
Stanford's lawsuit against biotechnology firm Roche Mol
ecular Systems is about protecting inventors and University
departments, not revenue, Provost John Etchemendy Ph.D.
'B2 said Thursday.
Etchemendy's comments came at the Faculty Senate
meeting after the U.S. Supreme Court said Monday it would
hear the case involving Stanford. The case will test the Bayh-
Dole Act of 1980, which gives universities the rights to the
federally funded inventions of faculty members.
He urged faculty to review the policy assigning rights to
their inventions to Stanford. "It's not a policy really to pro
tect the University," Etchemendy said. "More than anything
else, it's a policy to protect you."
Etchemendy defended the Bayh-Dole Act, calling it
"good for the nation" because it helped good inventions get
commercialized rather than "lost" within the government, he
said.
The notion that universities profit from the act is misguid
ed, Etchemendy said. Stanford receives $45 million to $6O
million in patent revenue. "We're on the upper end, and that's
on a $3.5 billion budget," Etchemendy said. "It's not a major
source of revenue."
He added that after costs are covered in the Stanford Of
fice of Technology Licensing, one third of patent revenue
goes to the faculty inventor, one third to his or her depart
ment and one third to the department's school.
"This is not the University worrying about income to the
University," said Etchemendy, who is Stanford's chief budg
etary officer. "It's really worrying about income to the depart
ment and the faculty member, and [Stanford is] very, very
worried about the principle."
The case arose from a dispute between Stanford and
Roche over ownership of the patents of HIV test kits. In 1988,
Stanford researcher Mark Holodniy signed over his patent
ownership rights to Stanford, including patents on his re
search that was later used in the test kits. In 1989, he signed
