## Full refund requests are up, dollar amount down in fall 
### ELLEN HUET MANAGING EDITOR 
Special fees refund requests for fall quarter
show a sharp increase in full refunds despite a
decrease in the overall number of requests and
the dollar amount requested in comparison to
the past year.
The ASSU Undergraduate Senate, espe
cially the Appropriations Committee, has
been grappling with different ideas to lower
the refund rate in recent months and last year.
The high volume of refund requests pulls
money back from student groups that receive
special fees. (The Daily receives special fees.)
This quarter saw, among undergraduates,
559 refund requests, 429 of which were full re
funds that asked for all $lll back. This ac
counted for $56,245 requested back, with the
average refund asking for $lOO.
In comparison, spring 2010 saw 959 refunds,
322 of which were full requests; $99,776 was re
funded in total, making the average refund re
quest $lO4.
Although the total number of requests
dropped along with the total amount of money
refunded, Senate Chair Michael Cruz 'l2 and
Appropriations Chair Rafael Vasquez 'l2 re
mained concerned about the sharp rise in full

refund requests.
Last spring quarter saw 36 percent full re
quests, whereas this quarter saw 77 percent of
requests asking for all money back.
"This is a troubling trend," Cruz said. "Ef
forts from last year's Appropriations Commit
tee didn't see effect."
"Partial refunds are usually students re
questing money back from one or a few
groups," he added. "Full refunds are students
that are completely opting out of student life."
Cruz added that while the drop in total re
quests is promising, the number, at 559 re
quests, is still higher than the Senate's goal to
return to earlier years' levels. Fall 2007 had 411
undergraduate refund requests, and fall 2008
had 488. Fall 2009 had 788 requests.
"Some measures have been effective,"
Cruz said. "But this is a hugely larger number
of full refunds. Appropriations still has a lot to
do."
In an attempt to reduce student refunds, the
Senate proposed, then retracted, a bill in early
October that would have required students to
request refunds in person rather than online,
as they are currently available. Last spring, the
Senate also shortened the refund period from
