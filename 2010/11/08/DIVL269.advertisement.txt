Peter Stansky has been an extraordinarily productive author of British history and
biography, and is a vibrant intellectual presence on the Stanford campus. As one
critic put it...
"Stansk/s writing, like his conversation, is full of color, personality,
flair and the Higher Gossip."
He has produced studies of some of the seminal figures in British political and
cultural history from the mid-19th century to the mid-20th: Gladstone, William
Morris, George Orwell, Henry Moore, and Benjamin Britten. He is the author of
Sassoon: The Worlds of Philip and Sybil; Gladstone: A Progress in Politics;
Redesigning the World: William Morris, the 1880s, and the Arts and Crafts; and
On or About December 1910: Early Bloomsbury and Its Intimate World. He has
also edited and co-authored many books, including Journey to the Frontier: Two
Roads to the Spanish Civil War. His most recent book, The First Day of the Blitz:
September 7,1940 , was published in 2008.
Hilton Obcnzinger, a prolific fiction and nonfiction writer and lecturer in the
Department of English and in Continuing Studies, will engage Peter Stansky in
conversation, focusing on the techniques, quirks, and joys of writing history and
biography.
