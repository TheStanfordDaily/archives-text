## EDITORIAL Improving the strength of the CDC 
### 
It's hard to feel sympathy for your class
mates who aspire to be bankers. But if
there is any satisfaction in their misery,
you should know that the circles of hell in
Dante's "Inferno" are purgatory compared
to the recruiting process for Wall Street. If
you find that econ major in your dorm sob
bing in the kitchen and stuffing his face with
donuts at 3 a.m., he's probably had a rough
interview. Unfortunately, the very campus in
stitution designed to ameliorate such ends
the Career Development Center has
weaknesses when it comes to this already
horrendous process.
Quite simply, Stanford undergraduates
are at an enormous disadvantage when it
comes to finance and consulting recruiting.
There are three specific areas the CDC
needs to improve immediately before we
start losing bright economics majors to Har
vard.
First, the website is a disaster. You're al
ways half-suspicious you've signed up for a
full interview slot because of all the glitches
in the system. You can't upload PDFs so you
just have to pray your resume doesn't turn
into Windings. After you've spent hours on
the phone making small talk with analysts at
JPMorgan, proofread your resume until
you've gone blind and ignored all your p-sets
so that you can study DCF models for your

interview, the last thing you want to worry
about is if the CDC website screwed up your
application.
Second, there seems to be a determined
lack of resources with regard to preparation
for case and professional interviews. The
Ivies, to their great benefit, hire and train pro
fessional interview coaches. "Case in Point,"
the must-have guide for every wannabe con
sultant, was written by Harvard career coun
selor. Why couldn't it have been a Stanford
counselor? Why are we always second-best?
A greater investment in such professional re
sources would be a boon to the campus com
munity for both short- and long-term suc
cesses.
Finally, there are staff members at the
CDC who are kind and good-natured, but
we are concerned about some undergradu
ates' perception that the atmosphere around
the center is less than convivial. We Stanford
students are historically known for needless
ly kvetching at times, but we urge the entire
staff to remember the emotionally charged
environment in which career planning plays
out.
The road to finance and consulting is al
ready lonely, dark and deep. At the very least,
the CDC should assist students in overcom
ing the already myriad hurdles that lie before
them.
