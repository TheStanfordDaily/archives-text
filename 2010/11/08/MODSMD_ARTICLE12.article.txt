# THE 						TRANSITIVE PROPERTY
## An Unpleasant Outing 
### Cristopher Bautista 
Last Friday I had to take my senior por
traits. I was excited since these would
be my first school photos as Cristopher.
In elementary school I would feel jealous of
the boys in my class because they got to wear
ties. At 21, in my last year of school, I finally
had my chance. I spent a good time looking
through my closet, and after much delibera
tion I settled on a pinkish red shirt with a ma
roon tie. Sexy.
However, I realized the portrait people
had sent me the e-mail and used my legal
name. I found that there was no way to
change my name at all. When I showed up,
they would look me up under my legal
name. I would be outed. This realization
paralyzed me.
I couldn't sleep that night. I felt scared,
anxious. I wasn't in the mood to educate peo
ple. I was just a regular guy who wanted his
picture taken. When I come out, I want it to
be on my terms. When I write this column, I
speak about my experience to the extent that
I'm comfortable. If someone outs me, or if I
find myself trapped in a position in which I
have to explain my situation, I feel humiliat
ed. Coming out once is stressful enough. I
swear, if I had a dollar every time I had to
come out, I'd probably collect enough money
for surgery.
That morning I headed over to Old
Union. A man sat at a table outside the room
where the portraits were being taken.
"What's your last name?" he asked.
"Bautista," I said.
He looked through the files for a long
while. He paused, scratched his head in con
fusion and looked through the files again.
"You don't seem to be on here, sir. The
only Bautista I have on here is Cristina "
"Yeah, that's me," I muttered. I could
barely form the words.
"Oh!" he laughed, awkwardly. "All right,
Cristina," he said, handing me some paper
work that was already filled out with my legal
name and gender. "You just need to sign a
couple things and we'll let you know when
we'll take your picture," He then said a cou
ple other things I don't remember I just
remember how he kept calling me by my
legal name, as if to try to compensate for his
earlier blunder. Every time he said that name
it chipped away at my sanity, bit by bit. When
someone outs me, I get into a mode of rather
learned helplessness where I just kind of
zone out and I don't listen to what anyone
says. I emotionally shut down. I get quiet. I
don't pay attention to things. And that was
me at that moment. I just wanted to run away.
But I didn't.
"Can I correct my name if it's spelled
wrong?" I asked.
"Of course." He probably figured I just
wanted to correct a letter or two.
I ended up crossing out my legal name in
a thick, dark line and writing "Cristopher
Marc" in huge letters. I scratched out the let
ter "F" under my gender marker and re-

placed it with an "M." I wrote with such a
vengeance that an observer would wonder
how a simple piece of paper could offend
someone so much.
There were other guys waiting their turn.
When the picture guy called out my name
my legal name, first and last those waiting
looked around, a bit confused. I answered,
feeling humiliated, and handed him the cor
rected paperwork. He looked surprised,
scoured over it several times, alternating be
tween looking at me and then back at the pa
pers.
"I'll change your name in the database,"
he said, embarrassed.
At that point I was tired and a bit fed up.
"Thanks," I muttered.
"No problem," he said. He was apologetic
the rest of the session, but I just wanted to
leave. When it was over, I grabbed my jacket
and walked out as fast as I could.
He learned from his mistake, I'm sure, and
will keep this sort of thing in mind in the fu
ture. In retrospect, I'm glad about that. But I
was forced to out myself, forced to correct my
name and gender to a man I didn't know, just
so I could get my stupid picture taken. The
experience was so emotionally exhausting I
got depressed and ended up locking myself in
my room that night hoping that if I quaran
tined myself the sadness would go away. I
don't want to be Cristopher the trans guy all
the time. Sometimes I just want to be Cristo
pher. But it's probably too much to ask in a
world like this.
Funny how a day can be ruined because of
a name. Maybe this week will be better.
Maybe,

Cross your fingers something good will hap
pen to Cristopher this week so he will stop writ
ing depressing columns. E-mail him at
cmsb @stanford. edu.

"What's your last
name?" he asked.
