# CARDINAL SINS
## A
						Step Back 
### David Spencer Nelson 
Thirty years ago, no one could avoid
awkward situations by staring at a cell
phone. Couldn't call someone to bail
out of a party for another. Couldn't log on to
the Internet and do a quick Wikipedia
search to finish an assignment on Nietzsche
before class. Couldn't procrastinate in the li
brary with Facebook and iTunes. Couldn't
peruse news and social media websites while
bored in a dorm. There was nothing to dis
tract you on a long bus ride or keep you oc
cupied during a walk.
Technology has changed the game. We're
constantly connected, whether to our
friends, the Internet or our phones.
A few decades ago, it would have been
truly impossible to avoid time alone. How
ever, now that we have the tools we do, we
have both the ability and inclination never to
go without some crutch. So we have slowly
made ourselves incapable of being alone
without feeling somehow strange. Nowa
days, many of us. myself included, feel down
right uncomfortable during periods of soli
tary disconnection.
As technology has slowly moved into the
social sphere, becoming Ã¼biquitous in mod
ern life, it's hard to find a place it hasn't
reached. The time alone and unstimulated
that was once unavoidable is now becoming
something to look for. It's rare to be separat
ed from cell phones, TVs, social networks
and friends. That's forced a fundamental
change: We spend less time with ourselves
and, therefore, know ourselves less.
This is bad. Those moments in which we
are alone with only our thoughts are some of
the most powerful and some of the most pro
ductive in terms of self-discovery. Self

knowledge and self-awareness are vital to a
satisfying life, I believe, and they can't be cul
tivated in an environment in which we are in
constant contact with other stimuli.
I think, also, that having as many crutches
as we do, we end up less happy with our
selves. We are not forced to face our own lim
itations and problems. We can use tools such
as Facebook and text messaging to help us
alleviate and distract us from our insecuri
ties and doubts, never truly confronting
them. In many ways, technology acts as an
advanced form of repression; something any
psych major will tell you is no good.
Essentially, we have made it possible not
to know ourselves, and, by doing so, to nurse
tremendous insecurity. By avoiding reflec
tion and relying on social media to help us
and distract us in times of difficulty, we never
answer the questions that trouble us or learn
mechanisms to cope with them.
In essence, technology is drugging us. It
has given us a method, much like a drug, to
completely avoid confronting our own
shortcomings. Relatively mindless media
have encroached on every aspect of life, to
the point where solitary pursuits are being
excluded from the normal course of a day.
This is purging reflection from popular soci
ety.
It's important for human beings to know
themselves. In order to find meaning and
satisfaction in life, we need to spend time re
flecting on what we want and who we are.
Being surrounded by friends and having
support systems and some mindless enter
tainment are of course important. But with
out the meaning supplied by reflective
thought, they make for an empty life.

We Stanford students are known for our
drive, our accomplishments and our ability
to stay active and dedicated. However, we
need to match our external efforts at im
provement with internal ones. We have to
ask ourselves why we do what we do, to
question our own motivations and impulses.
Only then can we reach a stable and happy
understanding, and somehow insulate our
selves from the changes of the outside world.

We have to
ask ourselves why
we do what
we do.
