## On Student Grief and Bereavement 
### KRISTIAN BAILEY '14 Daily Fellow 
In a six-month period between the spring of
my junior year in high school and the fall of
my senior year, I experienced three unex
pected losses. One of my classmates, my aunt
and my homeroom adviser of three years died
at the ages of 17,42 and 56, respectively.
While my entire school mourned the loss
es of my classmate and teacher, only a small
number of my friends and my teachers were
aware that my aunt had died, too. As con
tained as I kept my mourning in high school,
I find it even harder to express my grief at
Stanford.
Last Thursday, I attended a Student Grief
and Bereavement Workshop at the Vaden
Health Center. The event, which is co-spon
sored by the Office for Religious Life, Coun
seling and Psychological Services and the
Residence Deans twice a quarter, allowed
undergraduate and graduate students from
all of Stanford's schools to share their stories
of loss in a supportive environment.
As one of seven attendees, the workshop
provided a much-needed respite for me.
Though the "Stanford Bubble" generally
refers to our self-sufficiency and seclusion
from the outside world, I think it also applies
to how the campus, and college students in
general, deals with death and mourning.
During the workshop, I learned that
roughly a quarter of any college campus is
dealing with loss at any given time. Whatever
the percentage is at Stanford, it surprised me
that so few students attended the workshop
on Thursday and that I was the only male stu
dent present.
Maybe the event wasn't publicized well
enough, but I think that even if flyers were
posted in every bathroom stall on campus, at
tendance still wouldn't have been very high.

On a campus where students always seem
happy and laid back and the weather is usu
ally 75 and sunny, it doesn't seem appropriate
to grieve or feel depressed. And particularly
as a freshman, I do not yet feel comfortable
saying to my friends or dormmates, "Actual
ly, I'm not having a good day I miss my
aunt a lot today," rather than smiling and say
ing, "I'm fine." I have also found very little
time to grieve there is always a friend to
hang out with, a meeting or event to attend,
homework to finish and something new
about Stanford to discover and marvel at.
Death is also a taboo topic in our society
as a whole. We are raised to believe that all
people live long, healthy lives and only die
when they are old. We are made to feel as
though there is an appropriate amount of
time for grieving, and after that period we
should have gotten ourselves together.
These notions make dealing with loss partic
ularly difficult.
And in a society that labels men who ex
press their emotions as weak, grieving be
comes an even more internalized process
that is in constant conflict with our external
representations. I think this judgment is a
reason I was the only male to attend the
workshop.
If death became a mainstream topic in our
cultural dialogue, loss and grief would be
much easier to handle. I had many opportu
nities to discuss death and mourning with my
homeroom teacher before he died. Hearing
his experiences with losing loved ones and
his views on death not only helped me cope
with the losses of my classmate and aunt, but
it ultimately made his death less traumatic
and more a fact of life. Instead of becoming
depressed over his death, I dedicated my sen

ior year to celebrating his legacy and my
homeroom bonded to become arguably the
best and happiest one in the school.
But since such a drastic cultural shift does
not seem likely, a few questions remain: How,
if at all, can we as a campus encourage more
open dialogue on death and grieving? What
is the best way to publicize events like the
Student Grief and Bereavement Workshop?
Through flyers? Through Facebook? By
word of mouth? And for those of us who
have not experienced loss, how can we be
supportive of our peers that are grieving?
One of the topics we discussed during the
workshop was the dilemma created when
one says, "You can always talk to me if you're
feeling down." While the sentiments behind
this statement are valid, it puts the onus of
starting the conversation on the griever,
something that can be particularly hard when
one already feels buried in emotion.
So, while I do not have any concrete an
swers for my first two questions, as someone
who has experienced loss, I think being sensi
tive and supportive would suffice to answer
the last question and address the issue of who
starts the conversation about one's grief and
when. We should pay attention to each
other's moods and check on our friends when
they seem unhappy. And though we usually
won't feel the loss as deeply as our friends, I
think simply spending time with them shows
that we care and want to help them cope as
best as we can.

Ed. note: There will be another workshop on Thurs
day, Dec. 2 ats:3op.m. at Vaden.
