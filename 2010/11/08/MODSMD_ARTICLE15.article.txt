### CAROLINE CASELLI DESK EDITOR 
Facing two of the conference's

The two crucial wins, combined
with a loss by No. 2 California (21-2,11-

split the series with UCLA, the first
team to hand it a loss this season.
The Card came out firing, taking
the first point of the match with a kill
from senior outside hitter Alix Kline
man that was sent flying into the stands
by a U CLA defender. Klineman main
tained the intensity, putting an ace
down the line a couple of points later.
Three early blocks from the Stanford
front line frustrated the Bruin offense
and extended the Card's lead to 5-1.
UCLA fought back, finding holes
in the Stanford blocking line to put
down cross-court kills, tying the set at
12-12. Points went back and forth, with
each team killing balls down the line.
With the score knotted at 23-23, a kill
from Klineman and a UCLA attack
into the antenna narrowly sealed a
first-set victory for the Card, 25-23.
Stanford put on a more dominant
performance in the second set, jump
ing out to an early 8-3 lead with strong
attacks from senior setter Cassidy
Lichtman and stellar blocking. A
UCLA serve that hit the tape and fell
untouched on the Stanford side
brought the score within three at 16-
13, but powerful hitting from Kline
