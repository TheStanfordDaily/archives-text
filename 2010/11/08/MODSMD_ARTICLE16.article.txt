# The 						Power of Stanford football
## 
### Daniel Bohm 
It was a fairly standard week here.
The Stanford football team
played a huge game and won
yet Stanford stadium was embar
rassingly empty and The Old Pro
charged a 10-dollar cover on Saturday
night.
I don't want to turn into a one-trick
pony, so I'm going to focus on an oft
underappreciated aspect of Stanford's
success this season: the play of the big
guys on both sides of the ball.
When Stanford is talked about on
the national stage, the discussion tends
to be centered on Andrew Luck. Luck
deserves the accolades he is one of
the best quarterbacks in the nation
but seldom are the hogs in front of him
mentioned (aside from Owen Marecic,
who gets plenty of press, too).
Stanford lost the best running back
in the nation, Toby Gerhart, from last
year's squad, but has continued to pun
ish defenses with the run. The Cardinal
offense is averaging nearly 5.5 yards
per carry and Luck has been sacked
only three times all season.
Defenses get worn down by the
Cardinal offensive line to the point
where even when they know what is
coming and usually it is "power"
there is nothing that can be done to
stop it.
I'd really like to know how many
times Stanford ran power to the right
against Arizona this weekend. Wildcat
defenders are going to have night
mares for weeks of big 71, Andrew
Phillips, pulling from his left guard spot
and clearing out would-be tacklers like
mere flies being swatted to the side.
And then there is the jumbo pack
age. Stanford should have a raffle every
game to guess what number James
McGillicuddy is going to wear. This
week it was 87, but despite wearing a re
ceiver's jersey Saturday, the sixth-year
senior is in the game for one reason
to block. Just ask Arizona safety Joseph
Perkins, whom McGillicuddy sent into
orbit on Stepfan Taylor's fourth touch
down run in Saturday's victory.
As impressive as the offensive line
has been, the defensive line has been
equally strong. Stanford's defense was
predicted to be its weakness this sea
son, but instead it has proven to be a
strength. The Cardinal has pitched two
road shutouts in Pac-10 games, and just
held a very talented Arizona offense to
17 points. Another question mark com
ing into the year was depth along the
defensive line. Sione Fua, Brian Bul
cke. Matt Masifilo and Thomas Keiser
have put that notion to rest.
Much was made in the preseason
about the hiring of Vic Fangio as defen
sive coordinator. Fangio brought Stan
ford which has historically had a 4-3
defensive unit the 3-4 alignment. In
the 3-4, it is the job of the defensive line
men to eat up blockers so linebackers
can run wild and make tackles. Stan
ford fans have become accustomed to
seeing Shayne Skov and Chase
Thomas flying around making tackles,
and that is because the big boys up
front are clogging things up.
The toughest position in the 3-4 is
nose tackle, where you are routinely
double- and triple- teamed. That as
signment rests on Fua, who has played
nothing short of brilliantly all season.
Normally nose tackles don't rack up
any noticeable statistics, but Fua has
four sacks and 5.5 tackles for loss this
season, all while playing many more
snaps a game than most nose tackles.
Stanford hasn't used the 3-4 exclu
sively this year it goes to a four-man
front when in nickel or dime packages
but no matter how many guys have
their hands in the dirt, Stanford's de
fensive line has been quite impressive.
A successful defensive line is the
secondary's best friend. Pressure on the
quarterback means inaccurate passes
and receivers not having time to get out
of their routes. At times this year Stan
ford's secondary has, deservedly so,
come under fire (just ask Robert
Woods of USC). While the Cardinal
does need to upgrade on the back end,
improved defensive line play makes
Stanford's secondary at least passable
(no pun intended).
It would be interesting to see where
Luck would be without such a stellar
offensive line and where the secondary
would be without such strong D-line
production. Would Luck be a Heisman
candidate and a potential No. 1 overall
pick if he were getting sacked at a Trent
Edwards-like rate? Sure, Luck is far

more mobile in and around the pocket
than Edwards, but Luck owes a lot of
his success to his O-line (and I'm cer
tain he knows that).

Daniel Bohm wants you to appreciate
the Card O-line and D-line. Reassure
him that he's not a one-trick pony at
