In "Bay Area taxis charge up"
(Nov. 5), The Daily incorrectly re
ported that the Bay Area Climate
Collective secured $44 million in
funds for four electric vehicle proj
ects. In fact, the BACC was involved
in procuring money for only one of
those four projects, which is separate
from the Better Place battery-swap
project mentioned in the article. The
collaborative efforts between San
Francisco and San Jose to secure $44

million for making transportation
greener is separate from the BACC.

In "Faculty hear update on Stan
ford v. Roche" (Nov. s),The Daily in
correctly reported that the Stanford-
Roche case arose from a dispute over
ownership of the patents of HIV test
kits. It fact, it arose over patented
technology related to HIV test kits.

In "From the Farm to the Hill"
(Nov. 4), The Daily incorrectly re
ferred to Judy Biggert as a U.S. sena
tor. In fact, Biggert is a member of
the U.S. House of Representatives.
