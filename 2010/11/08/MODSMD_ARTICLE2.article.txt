## Luck, Owusu shred Wildcats 
### KABIR SAWHNEY MANAGING EDITOR 
Playing at the center of the national
stage, Stanford's football team made a re
sounding statement on Saturday night.
The No. 6 Cardinal (8-1,5-1 Pac-10) de
feated No. 18 Arizona (7-2,4-2), unleash-

ing offensive fireworks en route to a 42-17
victory. The win keeps Stanford in the dis
cussion for a possible berth in the Rose
Bowl or another BCS bowl.
"We're playing for a championship,"
Stanford head coach Jim Harbaugh said.
"That's our goal —to get to the Rose
Bowl and win a Pac-10 championship.
That's all we're playing for."
The game featured two marquee quar
terbacks in Stanford redshirt sophomore
Andrew Luck and Arizona junior Nick
Foles, leading some to expect the game to
be an offensive shootout. Luck and the
Stanford offense certainly fulfilled those
expectations, tallying 510 yards, including
293 yards on 23-32 passing from Luck.
"We prepared ourselves for a
shootout," said junior defensive back
Michael Thomas. "We had some goals in
mind ... if it came down to a shootout, we
were prepared."
The Stanford offense set the tone early
in the game, scoring a touchdown on a 45-
yard strike from Luck to junior receiver
Chris Owusu, who was streaking wide
open down the left sideline. The score in
dicated that the Card would be able to
move the ball at will against an overhyped
Arizona defense.

GAME NOTES: After this weekend's victory against
Arizona, the Cardinal is now ranked an impressive
6th in BCS standings, behind only one other 8-1
school, No. 5 LSU. Stanford's strong offensive and
defensive lines look to dominate against Arizona
State in Tempe on Saturday.

Chris Owusu, above, led all receivers on Saturday, hauling in nine catches for 165 yards and
one touchdown. The junior looked fully healthy after being slowed by injury in recent weeks.
ranked in a number of defensive sta
tistical categories. Arizona was sev
enth nationally in scoring defense,
10th in total defense and sixth in
rushing defense and was recording
almost 3.5 sacks per game. Stanford
notched yardage marks well above
Arizona's season averages, especial
ly in the running game Cardinal
rushers rolled up 217 yards against a
run defense that had previously sur
rendered an average of 88.4 yards
per game. Sophomore running back
Stepfan Taylor, while held to a rela
tively low 82 yards, scored four
touchdowns.
Stanford was able to move the ball
against Arizona chiefly because it
neutralized a Wildcat defensive line
that features two of the best defen
sive ends in the conference, Ricky El
more and Brooks Reed. The Stanford
offensive line contained both players
all night, surrendering no sacks and
giving Luck plenty of time to allow
his receivers' routes to develop and
make plays. Elmore and Reed each
had just one tackle on the night.
"I think our line took it personally,
and they were excited about going
against the best ends in the confer
ence," Harbaugh said. "Our guys
wanted to prove something as well.
More so than any other week, I think
they had a mindset of proving some
thing tonight."
In the receiving game, Owusu led
all receivers for both Stanford and
Arizona, hauling in nine catches for
165 yards and a touchdown.
"Chris had a wonderful evening,"
Harbaugh said. "He had a big play to
get our first points on the board. He
did a double move, made it at about
16 yards, and then got about 10 yards
of separation."
Owusu also made a diving catch to
preserve a Stanford drive early in the
fourth quarter. He dived forward to
gain a little separation from two Ari
zona defensive backs and kept his
hands under the ball to preserve the
completion.
"That might be the best catch I've
ever seen in person from the side
line," Harbaugh said. "I thought that
was an unbelievable catch."
While Stanford's offense moved
easily against an exposed Arizona de
fense, the Stanford defense contin
ued to play well. After a string of
rough outings, the Card bounced
back last week, shutting out Washing
ton on the road. Facing an elite quar
terback in Foles, the Cardinal rose to
the challenge again, severely limiting
the Wildcat offense. Despite rolling
up 428 yards, Arizona only mustered
17 points.
Stanford's defense also played
well in the clutch. Though Arizona
looked good on the stat sheet in piling

up yards, it went just 7-16 on third
down conversions and 1-3 on fourth
down conversions. The Cardinal de
fense also played well in the red zone
the Wildcats only converted three
of five red zone opportunities. Stan
ford killed three Arizona drives with
clutch plays one drive ended in an
interception by senior cornerback
Richard Sherman, one with a fourth
down pass deflection on the Stanford
five-yard line by redshirt junior line
backer Thomas Keiser and one on an
intentional grounding from Foles as
he was being sacked for a big loss by
sophomore linebackers Shayne Skov
and Chase Thomas.
"Foles is a great quarterback, one
of the best quarterbacks in the na
tion," said junior safety Delano How
ell. "It was great to play against one of
the best."
Uncharacteristically, the second
ary led Stanford on the stat sheet.
Howell and Sherman had 11 and 10
tackles respectively, and Michael
Thomas and senior safety Taylor
Skaufel added six tackles apiece.
The win over Arizona vaulted the
Cardinal into the No. 6 spot in the
BCS standings, up from No. 13 last
week. The team is the second-highest
ranked one-loss team, behind No. 5
LSU.
Stanford had the opportunity to
impress a large number of poll vot
ers during the primetime, nationally
televised game. A BCS bowl game is
no guarantee, however, even if the
Cardinal manages to win out. There
are many scenarios that could see
Stanford in the Rose Bowl, a differ
ent BCS bowl or a lesser bowl, like
the Alamo or Holiday Bowl.
Stanford's apparent lack of sig
nificant fan support could be an ob
stacle in earning an at-large BCS
bowl berth. Barring two losses by
current Pac-10 leader Oregon, an at
large berth is the only way Stanford
could get into the BCS. However,
Stanford Stadium didn't fill up any
where near its capacity against Ari
zona. Significant chunks of the
upper bowl were empty.
When asked about the lack of fan
support, Harbaugh said, "All we
were really concerned about was
coming in here and getting a win.
We'll keep coaching and playing
we're not worried about anything
else."
Harbaugh also addressed Stan
ford's position in the polls.
"I'm not a guy who concerns him
self with polls and things like that,"
Harbaugh said. "But, speaking on
behalf of my guys and Stanford foot
ball, this is a one-loss team that's
only lost to the No. 1 ranked team in
the country. It's probably about time
they got some recognition."

That's all we're playing for."
The game featured two marquee quar
terbacks in Stanford redshirt sophomore
Andrew Luck and Arizona junior Nick
Foles, leading some to expect the game to
be an offensive shootout. Luck and the
Stanford offense certainly fulfilled those
expectations, tallying 510 yards, including
293 yards on 23-32 passing from Luck.
"We prepared ourselves for a
shootout," said junior defensive back
Michael Thomas. "We had some goals in
mind ... if it came down to a shootout, we
were prepared."
The Stanford offense set the tone early
in the game, scoring a touchdown on a 45-
yard strike from Luck to junior receiver
Chris Owusu, who was streaking wide
open down the left sideline. The score in
dicated that the Card would be able to
move the ball at will against an overhyped
Arizona defense.

GAME NOTES: After this weekend's victory against
Arizona, the Cardinal is now ranked an impressive
6th in BCS standings, behind only one other 8-1
school, No. 5 LSU. Stanford's strong offensive and
defensive lines look to dominate against Arizona
State in Tempe on Saturday.

Chris Owusu, above, led all receivers on Saturday, hauling in nine catches for 165 yards and
one touchdown. The junior looked fully healthy after being slowed by injury in recent weeks.
ranked in a number of defensive sta
tistical categories. Arizona was sev
enth nationally in scoring defense,
10th in total defense and sixth in
rushing defense and was recording
almost 3.5 sacks per game. Stanford
notched yardage marks well above
Arizona's season averages, especial
ly in the running game Cardinal
rushers rolled up 217 yards against a
run defense that had previously sur
rendered an average of 88.4 yards
per game. Sophomore running back
Stepfan Taylor, while held to a rela
tively low 82 yards, scored four
touchdowns.
Stanford was able to move the ball
against Arizona chiefly because it
neutralized a Wildcat defensive line
that features two of the best defen
sive ends in the conference, Ricky El
more and Brooks Reed. The Stanford
offensive line contained both players
all night, surrendering no sacks and
giving Luck plenty of time to allow
his receivers' routes to develop and
make plays. Elmore and Reed each
had just one tackle on the night.
"I think our line took it personally,
and they were excited about going
against the best ends in the confer
ence," Harbaugh said. "Our guys
wanted to prove something as well.
More so than any other week, I think
they had a mindset of proving some
thing tonight."
In the receiving game, Owusu led
all receivers for both Stanford and
Arizona, hauling in nine catches for
165 yards and a touchdown.
"Chris had a wonderful evening,"
Harbaugh said. "He had a big play to
get our first points on the board. He
did a double move, made it at about
16 yards, and then got about 10 yards
of separation."
Owusu also made a diving catch to
preserve a Stanford drive early in the
fourth quarter. He dived forward to
gain a little separation from two Ari
zona defensive backs and kept his
hands under the ball to preserve the
completion.
"That might be the best catch I've
ever seen in person from the side
line," Harbaugh said. "I thought that
was an unbelievable catch."
While Stanford's offense moved
easily against an exposed Arizona de
fense, the Stanford defense contin
ued to play well. After a string of
rough outings, the Card bounced
back last week, shutting out Washing
ton on the road. Facing an elite quar
terback in Foles, the Cardinal rose to
the challenge again, severely limiting
the Wildcat offense. Despite rolling
up 428 yards, Arizona only mustered
17 points.
Stanford's defense also played
well in the clutch. Though Arizona
looked good on the stat sheet in piling

up yards, it went just 7-16 on third
down conversions and 1-3 on fourth
down conversions. The Cardinal de
fense also played well in the red zone
the Wildcats only converted three
of five red zone opportunities. Stan
ford killed three Arizona drives with
clutch plays one drive ended in an
interception by senior cornerback
Richard Sherman, one with a fourth
down pass deflection on the Stanford
five-yard line by redshirt junior line
backer Thomas Keiser and one on an
intentional grounding from Foles as
he was being sacked for a big loss by
sophomore linebackers Shayne Skov
and Chase Thomas.
"Foles is a great quarterback, one
of the best quarterbacks in the na
tion," said junior safety Delano How
ell. "It was great to play against one of
the best."
Uncharacteristically, the second
ary led Stanford on the stat sheet.
Howell and Sherman had 11 and 10
tackles respectively, and Michael
Thomas and senior safety Taylor
Skaufel added six tackles apiece.
The win over Arizona vaulted the
Cardinal into the No. 6 spot in the
BCS standings, up from No. 13 last
week. The team is the second-highest
ranked one-loss team, behind No. 5
LSU.
Stanford had the opportunity to
impress a large number of poll vot
ers during the primetime, nationally
televised game. A BCS bowl game is
no guarantee, however, even if the
Cardinal manages to win out. There
are many scenarios that could see
Stanford in the Rose Bowl, a differ
ent BCS bowl or a lesser bowl, like
the Alamo or Holiday Bowl.
Stanford's apparent lack of sig
nificant fan support could be an ob
stacle in earning an at-large BCS
bowl berth. Barring two losses by
current Pac-10 leader Oregon, an at
large berth is the only way Stanford
could get into the BCS. However,
Stanford Stadium didn't fill up any
where near its capacity against Ari
zona. Significant chunks of the
upper bowl were empty.
When asked about the lack of fan
support, Harbaugh said, "All we
were really concerned about was
coming in here and getting a win.
We'll keep coaching and playing
we're not worried about anything
else."
Harbaugh also addressed Stan
ford's position in the polls.
"I'm not a guy who concerns him
self with polls and things like that,"
Harbaugh said. "But, speaking on
behalf of my guys and Stanford foot
ball, this is a one-loss team that's
only lost to the No. 1 ranked team in
the country. It's probably about time
they got some recognition."

Playing at the center of the national

sounding statement on Saturday night.
The No. 6 Cardinal (8-1,5-1 Pac-10) de

cussion for a possible berth in the Rose
Bowl or another BCS bowl.
