## Luck, Owusu shred Wildcats 
### KABIR SAWHNEY MANAGING EDITOR 
Playing at the center of the national
stage, Stanford's football team made a re
sounding statement on Saturday night.
The No. 6 Cardinal (8-1,5-1 Pac-10) de
feated No. 18 Arizona (7-2,4-2), unleash-

ing offensive fireworks en route to a 42-17
victory. The win keeps Stanford in the dis
cussion for a possible berth in the Rose
Bowl or another BCS bowl.
"We're playing for a championship,"
Stanford head coach Jim Harbaugh said.
"That's our goal â€”to get to the Rose
Bowl and win a Pac-10 championship.
That's all we're playing for."
The game featured two marquee quar
terbacks in Stanford redshirt sophomore
Andrew Luck and Arizona junior Nick
Foles, leading some to expect the game to
be an offensive shootout. Luck and the
Stanford offense certainly fulfilled those
expectations, tallying 510 yards, including
293 yards on 23-32 passing from Luck.
"We prepared ourselves for a
shootout," said junior defensive back
Michael Thomas. "We had some goals in
mind ... if it came down to a shootout, we
were prepared."
The Stanford offense set the tone early
in the game, scoring a touchdown on a 45-
yard strike from Luck to junior receiver
Chris Owusu, who was streaking wide
open down the left sideline. The score in
dicated that the Card would be able to
move the ball at will against an overhyped
Arizona defense.

GAME NOTES: After this weekend's victory against
Arizona, the Cardinal is now ranked an impressive
6th in BCS standings, behind only one other 8-1

defensive lines look to dominate against Arizona
State in Tempe on Saturday.

Chris Owusu, above, led all receivers on Saturday, hauling in nine catches for 165 yards and
one touchdown. The junior looked fully healthy after being slowed by injury in recent weeks.
