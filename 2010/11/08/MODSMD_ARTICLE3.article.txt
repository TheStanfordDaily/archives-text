JOHNATHAN POTO/The Stanford Daily
With nine goals this season, junior forward Lindsay Taylor (17) is tied with junior midfielder Teresa Noyola in second
place on Stanford's scoring list. The team leader, senior Christen Press, scored twice on Friday to vanquish OSU, 2-0.
Despite Oregon State's vaunted
defense the Beavers (15-3-1, 7-2-
0) had only allowed seven goals all
season going into Friday night's
match it didn't take long for Stan
ford to open the scoring. On a third
minute barrage from the Cardinal of
fense, senior forward Christen Press
took a pass from sophomore Rachel
Quon on the right side of the box and
powered a low shot into the far left
corner of the Beaver net, past the div
ing Oregon State keeper, Colleen
Boyd. For Press, the national scoring
leader, the goal marked her 22nd
score of the season.
The Beavers responded with in
creased pressure on the defensive
side, and in the 15th minute they were
nearly able to level the score. Fresh
man forward Jenna Richardson, sec
ond on the Beavers in scoring, fired a
nearly point-blank shot toward the
Cardinal net, but freshman Stanford
keeper Emily Oliver took the full
force of the blast with her upper body,
knocking the ball away. At the end of
the half, the Beavers were outshoot
ing the Cardinal, 6-5.
Oregon State continued to pres
sure heavily in the second frame, with
Oliver coming up huge on a few key
saves. On a free kick in the 51st
minute, Courtney Wetzel sent a laser
of a shot past the Stanford wall that
would have blasted into the back of
the net if not for a diving Oliver, who
leaped to her right to make a two
handed save with her body fully off
the ground. Another missed chance
for the Beavers came in the 65th
minute, when OSU scoring leader
Chelsea Buckland fired a shot from
inside the box that Oliver gobbled up.
For the Cardinal, a team that has
allowed just 10 goals all season, the
endurance of the OSU pressure at
times posed a serious threat.
"I think they're a really hard
working, physical team," Press said of
the Ducks. "They put some pressure
on us and I respect it a lot that they
didn't shut down. There was definite
ly a while there where it was 1-0 and it
looked like it was going to be 1-1 pret
ty soon."
No player felt that pressure more
than Oliver. In order to counter the
Beaver offense and stay in focus, the
freshman keeper said she relied on
taking a leadership role on defense.
"It's a lot about organizing for me,"

Oliver said. "Just to keep staying in the
game mentally and just keeping every
body where they're supposed to be
helps me stay in my position. Kind of
just through organizing them, that kind
of helps me stay in tune mentally."
Stanford responded by opening
up its passing game, and in the 71st
minute Press was finally able to give
her team some insurance. Taking a
pass from sophomore midfielder
Mariah Nogueira while streaking in
on the left side, Press charged through
a trio of Beaver defenders and fired a
shot from the top of the box, beating
Boyd in the bottom right corner. The
goal made it 2-0 in favor of the Card,
and equalized the shooting for both
teams at 11. Stanford would hold on
for the shutout, the team's 10th of the
season.
It feels fantastic," head coach Paul
Ratcliffe said of the win. "It was a
hard-fought victory, and we really
earned the Pac-10 title tonight."
After securing a share of the con
ference title against the Beavers, the
Cardinal went on the clinch the Pac
-10 championship outright with a 3-0
victory over Oregon (7-10-3,3-5-1) on
Sunday, the team's annual Senior
Day. The victory sealed Stanford's

second consecutive conference title
and undefeated season.
Prior to the game, Stanford hon
ored its graduating class goalkeep
er Kira Maker, forward Morgan Red
man, midfielder Allison McCann and
Press with an on-field ceremony.
Despite the wind and rain on Sunday
afternoon, a sizeable crowd was pres
ent to congratulate the seniors and
their families. All four of the seniors
started the game, with Maker playing
all 90 minutes in goal.
The Cardinal opened the scoring
early, with junior forward Camille
Levin taking a pass from Redman
outside the top of the box before con
trolling for a moment and blasting a
shot inside the left post for her first
goal of the season. About 90 seconds
later, Quon rebounded a shot from
Teresa Noyola that had knocked off
the crossbar by heading it directly
into the right corner. It was the sopho
more's second goal of the year.
The Ducks increased their pres
sure in the second half, firing off five
shots after getting just one in the first,
but the Cardinal was still able to ex
tend its lead. Just over 16 minutes into
the frame, Noyola launched a free
kick from 22 yards out that sailed di

rectly into the left corner. The goal,
her ninth this year, tied her with Lind
say Taylor for second place on the
team to Press's 23.
With its second consecutive con
ference title secure, Stanford is now
set to make its 13th straight appear
ance in the NCAA Tournament. The
selection show is scheduled for this af
ternoon, and will determine the Car
dinal's seeding and first-round oppo

for the Beavers came in the 65th
minute, when OSU scoring leader
Chelsea Buckland fired a shot from
inside the box that Oliver gobbled up.
For the Cardinal, a team that has
allowed just 10 goals all season, the
endurance of the OSU pressure at
times posed a serious threat.
"I think they're a really hard
working, physical team," Press said of
the Ducks. "They put some pressure
on us and I respect it a lot that they
didn't shut down. There was definite
ly a while there where it was 1-0 and it
looked like it was going to be 1-1 pret
ty soon."
No player felt that pressure more
than Oliver. In order to counter the
Beaver offense and stay in focus, the
freshman keeper said she relied on
taking a leadership role on defense.
"It's a lot about organizing for me,"

Oliver said. "Just to keep staying in the
game mentally and just keeping every
body where they're supposed to be
helps me stay in my position. Kind of
just through organizing them, that kind
of helps me stay in tune mentally."
Stanford responded by opening
up its passing game, and in the 71st
minute Press was finally able to give
her team some insurance. Taking a
pass from sophomore midfielder
Mariah Nogueira while streaking in
on the left side, Press charged through
a trio of Beaver defenders and fired a
shot from the top of the box, beating
Boyd in the bottom right corner. The
goal made it 2-0 in favor of the Card,
and equalized the shooting for both
teams at 11. Stanford would hold on
for the shutout, the team's 10th of the
season.
It feels fantastic," head coach Paul
Ratcliffe said of the win. "It was a
hard-fought victory, and we really
earned the Pac-10 title tonight."
After securing a share of the con
ference title against the Beavers, the
Cardinal went on the clinch the Pac
-10 championship outright with a 3-0
victory over Oregon (7-10-3,3-5-1) on
Sunday, the team's annual Senior
Day. The victory sealed Stanford's

second consecutive conference title
and undefeated season.
Prior to the game, Stanford hon
ored its graduating class goalkeep
er Kira Maker, forward Morgan Red
man, midfielder Allison McCann and
Press with an on-field ceremony.
Despite the wind and rain on Sunday
afternoon, a sizeable crowd was pres
ent to congratulate the seniors and
their families. All four of the seniors
started the game, with Maker playing
all 90 minutes in goal.
The Cardinal opened the scoring
early, with junior forward Camille
Levin taking a pass from Redman
outside the top of the box before con
trolling for a moment and blasting a
shot inside the left post for her first
goal of the season. About 90 seconds
later, Quon rebounded a shot from
Teresa Noyola that had knocked off
the crossbar by heading it directly
into the right corner. It was the sopho
more's second goal of the year.
The Ducks increased their pres
sure in the second half, firing off five
shots after getting just one in the first,
but the Cardinal was still able to ex
tend its lead. Just over 16 minutes into
the frame, Noyola launched a free
kick from 22 yards out that sailed di

rectly into the left corner. The goal,
her ninth this year, tied her with Lind
say Taylor for second place on the
team to Press's 23.
With its second consecutive con
ference title secure, Stanford is now
set to make its 13th straight appear
ance in the NCAA Tournament. The
selection show is scheduled for this af
ternoon, and will determine the Car
dinal's seeding and first-round oppo
nent.

JOHNATHAN POTO/The Stanford Daily
With nine goals this season, junior forward Lindsay Taylor (17) is tied with junior midfielder Teresa Noyola in second
place on Stanford's scoring list. The team leader, senior Christen Press, scored twice on Friday to vanquish OSU, 2-0.
Despite Oregon State's vaunted
defense the Beavers (15-3-1, 7-2-
0) had only allowed seven goals all
season going into Friday night's
match it didn't take long for Stan
ford to open the scoring. On a third
minute barrage from the Cardinal of
fense, senior forward Christen Press
took a pass from sophomore Rachel
Quon on the right side of the box and
powered a low shot into the far left
corner of the Beaver net, past the div
ing Oregon State keeper, Colleen
Boyd. For Press, the national scoring
leader, the goal marked her 22nd
score of the season.
The Beavers responded with in
creased pressure on the defensive
side, and in the 15th minute they were
nearly able to level the score. Fresh
man forward Jenna Richardson, sec
ond on the Beavers in scoring, fired a
nearly point-blank shot toward the
Cardinal net, but freshman Stanford
keeper Emily Oliver took the full
force of the blast with her upper body,
knocking the ball away. At the end of
the half, the Beavers were outshoot
ing the Cardinal, 6-5.
Oregon State continued to pres
sure heavily in the second frame, with
Oliver coming up huge on a few key
saves. On a free kick in the 51st
minute, Courtney Wetzel sent a laser
of a shot past the Stanford wall that
would have blasted into the back of
the net if not for a diving Oliver, who
leaped to her right to make a two
handed save with her body fully off
the ground. Another missed chance
for the Beavers came in the 65th
minute, when OSU scoring leader
Chelsea Buckland fired a shot from
inside the box that Oliver gobbled up.
