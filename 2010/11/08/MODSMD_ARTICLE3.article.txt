# PAC-10 CHAMPIONS
## Press leads Card to conference title 
### NATE ADAMS DESK EDITOR 
It's been a season of successes for
the Stanford women's soccer team,
but last weekend's final series certain
ly helped to end the year on a particu
larly high note. With a pair of shutout
victories over the Oregon schools at
home, the No. 1 Cardinal (18-0-2,9-0-
0 Pac-10) clinched sole possession of

the Pac-10 Conference title and its
second consecutive undefeated regu
lar season.
In a tight match on Friday night at
Laird Q. Cagan Stadium, Stanford
was able to capitalize on an early goal
and survive an extended Oregon
State assault to ultimately hand the
Beavers their first loss of the confer
ence season. The 2-0 win was Stan
ford's 16th victory in as many chances

and secured a share of the conference
title, which the Cardinal went on to
clinch on Sunday.
