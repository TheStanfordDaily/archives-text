## Hopkins' squid program teaches sea stewardship Humboldt squid engage kids, biology professor finds 
### ERIN INMAN STAFF WRITER 
Squids for Kids, a growing outreach program run
through Stanford's Hopkins Marine Station, is teaching
good ocean stewardship to kids.
"A lot of kids have eaten seafood but haven't really
thought of what that means," said Julia Stewart, the pro
gram coordinator and a graduate student in biology at
Stanford. "To be able to see an animal, touch it and think
about it moves towards ocean awareness."
The program started when William Gilly, a biology
professor at Hopkins, gave a lecture and dissection work
shop at a science camp in Cambria, Calif., two years ago.
After someone suggested that Humboldt squid be
sent to the home institutions of some of the conference
attendees, the program took off. The novelty of the Hum
boldt squid garnered attention through word of mouth,
while the website helped promote inquiries from other
institutions.
"The teachers were all astounded because they use
little squid for dissection," Gilly said. "They're small,
mangled, deformed and colorless." In contrast, Hum
boldt squid are not just novel to most people, but also
"charismatic," according to Gilly. Their relatively larger
size, and hence larger organ systems, makes them opti
mal for dissections when compared to other, smaller
squid.
The squid is a "novel platform for increased aware
ness in students about ocean health," Gilly added. It al
lows people to "connect with the ocean on a different
level," Stewart said.
Since the program's inception, any teacher who can
use the squid in a "rational way" is eligible to receive one,
Gilly said. Thus far, 60 to 75 Humboldt squid have been
distributed to elementary, middle and
high schools, as well as universities.
The squid are either left over from
squid collected for research in the
Gilly lab or from sport fishing in the
area.

With the expansion of the curricu
lum, the program hopes to expand its
target base. By sending 100 squid a
year, Gilly speculates they could
reach 4,000 students.
"It's a universal 'gee whiz, 'wow'
experience," Gilly said, for the people
of wide-ranging ages and back
grounds who are involved.
The program sends the squid with
a dissection guide of the external and
internal anatomy geared toward jun
ior-high and older students. The les
son plan is designed for after-school
programs or for incorporation into
teachers' existing lesson plans.
Stewart is now developing a cur
riculum that can be applicable to any
age group so that any desiring teacher
may use the lesson.
"I hope to bring it into a bigger pic
ture," Stewart said. "We can use the
squid as away to talk about conserva
tion and bigger-scale processes and
how they relate to the ecosystem."
To do this, Stewart hopes to in
clude a broad range of topics, includ
ing anatomy, physiology, pollution
and fishing, that can be expanded de
pending on the age group.
Currently Squids for Kids is apply
ing for annual grants to pay for ship
ping costs.
Both Gilly and Stewart said they
would like the program to be sustain
able in the long term. "But we're tak
ing it step by step for now," Stewart
said.
