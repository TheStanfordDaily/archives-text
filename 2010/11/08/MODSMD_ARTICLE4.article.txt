Squids for Kids, a growing outreach program run
through Stanford's Hopkins Marine Station, is teaching
good ocean stewardship to kids.
"A lot of kids have eaten seafood but haven't really
thought of what that means," said Julia Stewart, the pro
gram coordinator and a graduate student in biology at
Stanford. "To be able to see an animal, touch it and think
about it moves towards ocean awareness."
The program started when William Gilly, a biology
professor at Hopkins, gave a lecture and dissection work
shop at a science camp in Cambria, Calif., two years ago.
After someone suggested that Humboldt squid be
sent to the home institutions of some of the conference
attendees, the program took off. The novelty of the Hum
boldt squid garnered attention through word of mouth,
while the website helped promote inquiries from other
institutions.
"The teachers were all astounded because they use
little squid for dissection," Gilly said. "They're small,
mangled, deformed and colorless." In contrast, Hum
boldt squid are not just novel to most people, but also
"charismatic," according to Gilly. Their relatively larger
size, and hence larger organ systems, makes them opti
mal for dissections when compared to other, smaller
squid.
The squid is a "novel platform for increased aware
ness in students about ocean health," Gilly added. It al
lows people to "connect with the ocean on a different
level," Stewart said.
Since the program's inception, any teacher who can
use the squid in a "rational way" is eligible to receive one,
Gilly said. Thus far, 60 to 75 Humboldt squid have been
