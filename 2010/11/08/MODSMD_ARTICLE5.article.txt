# Students engineer recyclable laptops with global twist
## On two campuses, students fight electronic waste 
### SAMANTHA McGIRR DESK EDITOR 
A group of mechanical engineering graduate stu
dents have created a "recyclable laptop" that can be
completely disassembled by hand in under 30 seconds.
As part of a corporate-sponsored design class, Me
chanical Engineering 310, "Project Based Design, En
gineering and Development," the Stanford students
collaborated with students at Finland's Aalto Universi
ty to design and build the "Bloom" prototype laptop
over the course of a year.
At the beginning of 2009, Autodesk, the team's as
signed sponsor, asked the students to create a fully re
cyclable consumer-electronics product using the com
pany's design software.
After the team decided on a laptop as their product
of choice, they set about addressing the ways in which
traditional laptops are not eco-friendly. According to
team member Aaron Engel-Flall 'O9 M.S. 'lO, this
meant making it easy to remove the "bad apples"
components such as the circuit boards from the rest
of laptop.
"Almost everything in a laptop is theoretically recy
clable," Engel-Flall said. "It's mostly metal, plastic and
glass. The problem is that the metal, plastic and glass
are completely integrated [with the rest of the laptop],
and we need to separate them before they can be recy
cled."
The Bloom can be disassembled by hand in 30 sec
onds and in 10 steps. A traditional laptop, on the other
hand, requires three tools and about 120 steps and can
take up to 45 minutes to disassemble.
Additionally, the Bloom contains an envelope with
prepaid postage behind the screen, which customers
can use to send circuit boards to a specialized recycling
facility.
Engel-Flall and his Stanford team members, Rohan
Bhobe 'O9 M.S. 'O9 and Kirstin Gail 'O9 M.S. 'O9, spent
the first six months of the academic year conducting
user testing and research to determine why people do
not currently recycle their electronics, specifically their
laptops, and what would make them more likely to do
so. Then they collaborated with four students at Aalto
University in Finland on the actual design and con
struction. Engel-Hall said the 10-hour time difference
between California and Finland actually helped the
group as they neared their deadline.
"We would work around the clock and then, as we
were going to bed, they were waking up, and we'd
