## Recent grad's death under investigation 
### ELLEN HUET MANAGING EDITOR 
San Francisco officials are investigating the death of
a Stanford alumna, Jia Hou 'O7, who graduated with a
degree in psychology.
Hou died on Oct. 29 in San Francisco at age 25, said
Alan Pringle of the city-county Office of the Medical
Examiner last week. On Sunday, a spokesman for the
office said the case was still under investigation and
would be for at least several more weeks.
Word of Hou's death had spread last week to some
of the staff who worked in Freshman-Sophomore Col
lege (FroSoCo) when Hou lived there, including resi
dent fellows Andrew Dimock and Sharon Palmer and
former college assistants Cisco Barron 'O4 and LaCona
Woltmon 'O4. They all declined to comment.
Quincy Tanner 'OB, who lived in FroSoCo with Hou
during the 2004-2005 school year, said Hou's death was
"really shocking" and recalled Hou
as someone dedicated to fitness and
culinary arts.
"She ran marathons quite fre
quently," Tanner said, adding that
Hou introduced him to running
Campus Drive. Tanner and Hou
shared an interest in gourmet cook
ing, which Hou often put to creative
use in Ricker Dining, Tanner said.
Bundy Chanock, a San Francisco
paramedic who met Hou during her
Stanford years and stayed close with
her after graduation, said Hou was

going to culinary school in San Fran
cisco at the time of her death.
"Her number-one dream was to
have a job in a four-star restaurant as
chef," Chanock said. "Her second
was to be a private chef."
The medical examiner's office in
vestigates suspected homicides, sui
cides, accidental deaths and other
unusual deaths. A San Francisco Po
lice Department spokesperson de
clined to give information on the
case and referred The Daily to the
medical examiner.
