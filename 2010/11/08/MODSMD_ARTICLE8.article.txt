## Grant aids muscular dystrophy research 
### KATHERINE NABEL 
A $2.3 million grant this fall from
the California Institute of Regenera
tive Medicine (CIRM) is the most re
cent installment of stem cell research
money poured into Stanford labs.
Since 2004, Stanford has received
about $175 million from CIRM, ac
cording to the School of Medicine, In
late October, the CIRM awarded ge
netics professor Michele Calos $2.3
million for her work on Duchenne
muscular dystrophy (DMD). The
grant was part of a $67 million effort
to mobilize stem cell research in Cal
ifornia.
One of the most common and se
rious forms of muscular dystrophy,
DMD affects one in every 3,500 new
born boys. This disease causes irre
versible, widespread muscle degener
ation and is, in most cases, fatal. Muta
tion of a vital muscle protein, dys
trophin, is one of the key causes of
DMD. Absence of this muscle-main
taining protein causes weakening of
the muscles in the hips, pelvic area,
thighs and shoulders.
"To begin to approach a therapy
for this condition, we must provide a
new supply of stem cells that carry
the missing protein that is lacking in
DMD," Calos said. "These cells must
be delivered to the body in such away
that they will engraft in the muscles
and produce new, healthy muscle tis
sue on an ongoing basis."
Like most retrogressive diseases,
DMD eventually leads to destruc
tion of most of the muscles in the
body. DMD is caused by an x-linked
recessive inheritance, and patients
with DMD typically die before the
age of 30.
Calos hopes a cure for DMD will
stem from a therapy that could cor
rect this muscle mutation by repro
gramming skin and fat cells into new,
healthy stem cells.
"We start with mice that have a
mutation in the same gene that is af
fected in DMD," Calos said. "We re
program some of their adult cells, add
the correct gene and grow the cells in
incubators in a manner that will pro
duce muscle stem cells."
Calos and her team then evaluate

the effect of transplanting these cor
rected muscle stem cells into DMD
mice and the mice's ability to gener
ate new muscle tissue.
Medical School spokeswoman
Krista Conger praised the efforts of
Calos's team and their mouse model
development.
"If successful," Conger said, "the
researchers will develop standard
procedures to test and ensure the
safety of all cells for eventual use in
humans in DMD and possibly other
degenerative disorders."
And the funding provided by
CIRM will certainly aid Calos's ef
forts. Established in November 2004
with the passage of Proposition 71,
the California Stem Cell Research
and Cures Act, CIRM has provided
$3 billion in funding to California
universities and research institutions
to date.
With the opening of the nation's
largest stem cell center, The Lorry I.
Lokey Stem Cell Research Building,
last month, the Stanford School of
Medicine is continuing to make
strides in its stem cell research efforts.
The 200,000-square-foot building will
house more than 600 scientists hop
ing to collaborate with one another.
Irving Weissman, director of the
Stanford Stem Cell Biology and Re
generative Medicine Institute, said of
the building, "What is important is
that it will give people the opportuni
ty to apply stem cell thinking to dif
ferent problems, including regenera
tion, aging and cancer."
While Calos' research is not yet at
a stage to involve clinical trials, she
hopes her mouse research will pro
vide the insight necessary to begin
work in humans.
"In order to make this process
into something that could be used in
the clinic, we will develop standard
procedures for making and testing
the cells to ensure that they are ef
fective and safe," Calos said. "In this
way, this project could lead to a new
stem cell therapy that could improve
the clinical condition of DMD pa
tients."
