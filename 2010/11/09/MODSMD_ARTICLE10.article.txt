## EDITORIAL In support of the University's pioneering stem cell research 
### 
As reported in The Daily, this past
October saw the grand opening of
the Lorry I. Lokey Stem Cell Re
search Building. The most recent addition
to the University's School of Medicine, this
$225 million, 200,000-square-foot project,
now the largest stem cell center in the na
tion, was received with fitting aplomb. In its
construction, the University further
demonstrated its commitment to staying
on the avant-garde of pioneering technolo
gy. The University's work is not going un
noticed, and rightfully so. Reported yester
day, the California Institute of Regenera
tive Medicine awarded $2.3 million to ge
neticist Michele Carlos for her work on
Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD).
The motto of Stanford University is
"Die Luft der Freiheit weht" the wind
of freedom blows. At the school's founding,
the Stanford family dedicated the Univer
sity to the education and improvement of
California's sons and daughters. With its
bold support of stem cell research, the Uni
versity is embodying both the motto and
the ideals instilled by the Stanfords.
When much of the country lets the stain
of partisan fervor shrouded in religious

dogmatism consume, and thus hinder, the
actual science of stem cells, Stanford has
chosen to instead lead on the issue. The
winds of scientific freedom thankfully still
blow here on the Farm. The potential of this
research could improve the lives not only
of Californians, but also of citizens around
the globe. Researchers at Stanford are al
ready studying the potential effect of stem
cells on leukemia, type I diabetes, multiple
sclerosis, sickle cell anemia and Parkinson's
disease, to name just a few.
There are legitimate concerns the edito
rial board has with aspects, both trivial and
otherwise, about the decisions made by
various functionaries within the
labyrinthine University structure. Howev
er, developments such as the ones listed
above should serve as a reminder to both
the board and the campus that the institu
tion that we inhabit is world-class and help
ing to shape the future in bold and exciting
ways. Coupled with the recent completion
of the Huang Center, the Gunn SIEPER
building and the soon-to-be-completed
Knight Management Center, the editorial
board very much believes the future of this
great university will only continue to grow.
