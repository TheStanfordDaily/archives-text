## Greed, For Lack Of a Better Word 
### 
I have noticed an unusual air grip fellow
upperclassmen as they go through the re
cruiting process for positions with some
of the most prestigious names in the finan
cial and consulting fields. Students aspiring
for careers in those industries, the two that
perhaps offer the most streamlined post
graduate paths for today's students, are com
monly being slandered for a lack of original
ity and commitment to service. Our school's
pre-professional crowd and student organi
zations have been hit with a wave of cynicism
akin to the phrase "followers of the mob."
Standing in marked contrast to Stanford's
strong roots in public service, careers in in
vestment banking have been subject to
forceful bashing on campus. And, alas, the
irony of it all: our most talented lot gloating
with five-figure offers after having dispar
aged Goldman Sachs as home wreckers and
perpetrators of the financial crisis.
Stanford students, like college students
anywhere else, like to be reassured that they
are diverse creatures or rather, clear outliers
in the pack. At first I was naively surprised
to see Stanford students using buzz words
such as "sustainability" or "development"
(arguably the most ambiguous words for ex
pressing career interests) and attracting
envy and respect from their peers. Appar
ently doing anything at all, besides the
cliche of finance or consulting, of course,
could potentially convey an authenticity of
character. Surprisingly, however, students in
less prestigious universities (for lack of a
better word) don't seem to share Stanford's
disapproving outlook on glamorous career
paths. In my experience, students attending
state schools are particularly less contemp

tuous of the financial services industry and
favor openly articulating their interest in
pursuing pre-defined career paths. Similar
ly, their majors and coursework have not
been handpicked and tailored to conceal
practical interests by means of fancy engi
neering degrees, which rarely abstract from
building foundations in business operations.
There is something shameful about going
to Stanford and failing to emerge having
carved out differentiated life aspirations.
Stanford students' growing repudiation of
lucrative careers in finance and consulting
may be part of an emerging trend of the
same intellectual elitism once exclusively
used to caricature Ivy Leaguers.
Stanford's select few headed for star-stud
ded careers in either consulting or i-banking
have woefully been placed at the forefront of
Stanford's long-standing battle to bury de
fined paths to success. Not surprisingly, the
years preceding the financial crisis witnessed
pre-medical and pre-law students facing sim
ilar antipathy. Stanford faculty, most notice
ably former vice provost John Bravman, en
couraged students to be bold while planning
careers, while President John Hennessy con
cludes almost every address with the shared
theme of service. Opportunities such as
Teach for America, which are able to com
bine public service as well as retain exclusiv
ity, have seen a tremendous surge in appli
cants. While both public service and lambast
ing the greed fueling the recession have
moved our student body as a collective, noth
ing matters more than differentiation or indi
vidual branding to the Stanford student.
