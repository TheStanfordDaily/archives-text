Let cyclists use the tunnel

Dear Editor,
Please don't forget Stanford's responsibil
ity in the tragic death of cyclist Lauren Ward
on Nov. 4. Because Stanford Management
Company is the largest landowner and the
source of much of the automobile traffic in
the area, Santa Clara County has been trying
to get them to build a pedestrian/bicycle trail
under Highway 280 just south of Alpine
Road for 10 years.
Less than a mile south of where Lauren was
killed, Stanford owns a cow tunnel under
Highway 280. The local community has been

begging Stanford to open this tunnel to the
public as an alternative pedestrian and bicycle
undercrossing. We sincerely believed that
Stanford would be required to open this tunnel
as mitigation for the development rights they
received from the county in the year 2000.
Many people who work at the University,
the hospital, the Stanford business parks and
downtown Palo Alto who live in Portola Val
ley and Woodside would find bicycling to
work safe and enjoyable if Stanford would
only allow them to use this cow tunnel.
