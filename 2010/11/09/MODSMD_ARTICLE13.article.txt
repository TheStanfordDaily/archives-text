## Socially Handicapped 
### Jade Wang 
It's time for me to face the music I'm
kind of awkward. I can't think of conver
sation fodder fast enough to fill those
silent gaps, and I often wave to that person on
the street who's actually waving to the per
son behind me. My voice gets a little shaky
when I'm excited. I use phrases like "face the
music" only partially ironically.
Awkwardness is a favorite topic at Stan
ford. We seem to have an entire choreo
graphed dance routine for this conversation,
beginning with mimicking marine reptiles
and spiraling into an entire menagerie of
awkward. Acknowledging the awkwardness
is both passe and an ineffective means of al
leviating it. Pushing through is difficult and
potentially emotionally scarring. Given these
less-than-appealing options, what's a girl to
do? I might speak too quietly under normal
circumstances and too loudly when I'm excit
ed, but I still want to converse with other
human beings, volume-control problems
notwithstanding. Luckily, the Internet and
assorted technologies are there to support
me through these difficult times and provide
me social crutches. Social crutches are items
or services that give a social pardon and
allow me to avoid an awkward situation.
For example, months ago, my non-ridicu
lously-sized headphones broke, and before I
super-glued them (and also my fingers) back
together, I was forced to walk campus sans
ear buds. I didn't anticipate the strangeness.
I'm hardly hip enough to be lost in musical
nirvana all the time, but life without the ear
buds was profoundly unpleasant.
I think I use the headphones as some kind
of awkward person crutch. With the head
phones on, I don't have to ask that acquain
tance in White Plaza how her quarter and
possibly year are so far. A short wave is suffi
cient, because nobody wants the inconven

ience of ripping the ear buds out for an awk
ward four-second conversation. I pretend not
to hear the random yelling people or political
activists seeking my time, money or signa
ture, which would ordinarily make me feel
rude, but I don't feel so bad with the head
phones on.
I am also becoming increasingly depend
ent on text messages for basic communica
tion. By no means would I be considered a
good phone conversationalist even on a good
day, but my increasing reliance on text mes
saging has made me, if possible, even worse at
leaving phone messages. While texting is suc
cinct and allows for review before its final
submission, my phone messages are always
meandering messes. Politeness dictates me to
flounder with one-sided conversation before
I ask the single question that is the purpose of
my call. Sometimes, I am forced to leave sev
eral messages in a row with a series of self
corrections, each more frazzled than the for
mer. I held off on purchasing a real texting
plan for what felt like a long time, so I faced
my social awkwardness with a stubbornness
born only of having no other options. Since
I've given in, however, I'm even more afraid
of real phone conversations than before and
gravitate toward text-based communication
whenever possible.
My inability to walk to class or make a sim
ple phone call without a social crutch is mild
in comparison to my utter incompetence at
flirting. After I caught myself actually
twirling my hair on one occasion, I banned
the activity from my arsenal entirely. The ad
vent of Likealittle, like a flirty or creepy Twit
ter, has made me reconsider my stance.
Social crutches worry me a bit. My very
first-world problem of having too many op
tions for communication and leisure time
that I have forgotten how to speak to humans

is, admittedly, ridiculous. But, losing my self
confidence and ability to relate to other peo
ple in real life may be cause for concern. I oc
casionally consider weaning myself off the
crutches, but my plans never become reality.
I'm not going to take any drastic action un
less I actually become a bona fide hermit. If I
do, chances are, the only plea for help I'll be
able to manage is a chat status update, so
keep an eye out.

Don't worry, Jade doesn't get overwhelmed by
receiving e-mails. The only way to receive an
overanalyzed response is bye-mailing her at
jadew@stanford. edu.

It's time for me to
face the music
I'm kind of
awkward.
