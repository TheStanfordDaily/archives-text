# GIRL YOU KNOW IT'S TRUE
## Eight Celebrities More Interesting than George Clooney 
### Jordan Carr 
There is nothing that gets Stanford stu
dents more excited than Darfur. I
mean really, how else to explain the
overwhelming interest in yesterday's event
on the topic. Sure, professional handsome
man George Clooney is speaking, but there's
no way Stanford students were lined up
around the block just to see the guy from
"Leatherheads."
But just in case we actually do care about
celebrities (and not boring, unsexy African
genocides), here are a few more big names
and the righteous causes they could drone on
and on about in exchange for allowing us to
soak up their magic fame-glow.
Kevin Bacon, Gates Foundation
We've all played six degrees of Kevin
Bacon so surely he could come here and talk
about the Gates Foundation's new pilot pro
gram Six Degrees from Kevin Bacon for se
lected high-achieving students. Participants
are given full scholarships on the condition
that they enroll in an innovative
M.A./D.D.S./M.8.A./J.D./Ph.D./G.E.D. pro
gram. The program is hard work, but it's still
more fun than trying to remember who his
co-stars in "The Woodsman" and "Hollow
Man" were.
The Three Non-Bono Guys from U2, Potato
Famines
Tired of hearing that attention hog Bono
always talking about how much he's doing to
make things better in Africa? So are the
other three guys from U2 (for what it's worth,
they are: Larry Mullen, Jr., Adam Clayton
and of course, The Edge), which is why they
have been inspi(red) to stay home and solve
the very real problem facing their native land
of Ireland: that their entire national existence
is still dependent on potato farming.

Natalie Portman, Fighting Poverty Through
Microfinance
Oh wait, this one actually happened three
years ago. Still, it's better than the time Fla
vor Flav lectured on fighting tardiness
through macro-clocks.
Lil Wayne, Presidential History
Listen, in prison, there are two choices:
convert to Islam or hide in the library and
read a ton of presidential biographies. No
body knows why that is, but prison is a
frightening and mysterious place. In any
event, the upshot is that Lil Wayne is now a
certified expert on Tha (Jimmy) Carter Ad
ministration. Now that Wayne is a free man,
he would surely be willing to give a lecture
comparing the Iran hostage crisis to the time
he realized he could write a song about
blowjobs and nobody would know the dif
ference if they thought he was talking about
lollipops.
Lady Gaga, Heart Disease
Heart disease is the leading killer in the
United States, and yet it doesn't get nearly
the publicity that it deserves. And if there's
one thing Lady Gaga can do, it's create a
spectacle. Maybe we'd all pay more atten
tion to heart disease if its spokeswoman was
riding a giant mechanical flamingo that

breathes fire or whatever it is she does at her
shows.
John Boehner, Skin Cancer Awareness
A trip out here would give the new Speak
er of the House the opportunity to taunt the
vanquished Nancy Pelosi in her own backyard
as well as visit El Camino's "A Tan for All Sea
sons" for a photo op. He's very tan, you see.
Keith Richards, Drug Awareness
For all the talk of the Rolling Stones gui
tarist's drug abuse over the years (after
spending a decade on the Most Likely to Die
list, Richards' immortality was eventually
ceded), he has made it into his mid-60s and
shows no sign of slowing, except for that he
looks 15 years older than his age and was
spurred to quit cocaine four years ago after
falling out of a tree in Fiji, but not before he
snorted his dad's ashes.
His recent memoir "Life" is a bestseller that
has gotten a lot of attention for its references to
Mick Jagger's "tiny todger," and other potshots
at superstars Elton John? "An old bitch."
John Lennon? "A silly sod." Prince? "An over
rated midget." Let's have him lecture us on the
secret to his longevity, as revealed in his book:
using only the "finest, finest cocaine and the
purest, purest heroin." So, um, kids, don't do
drugs. But if you do, get the good stuff.
Kesha, Mental Health Awareness
Are you a blonde, white girl who wakes up
in the morning feeling like P. Diddy? There's
a chance you may have dissociative identity
disorder. Get that checked out. TiK ToK,
you're on the clock.
