## Secondary improving for Card 
### Zach Zimmerman Dishing the Rock 
My weekend was un
doubtedly better than
yours for one reason: I
made my first career
appearance on Sky
cam. The suspended camera that fol
lows the ESPN crew on Saturday nights
is one of my favorite sports creations of
all time. Inventor Garrett Brown has to
feel snubbed by the Nobel Prize com
mittee.
While I could never have envisioned
accomplishing such a lofty life goal, my
two seconds of fame placed runner-up
in the list of I-can't-believe-that-just
happened moments during the
matchup between Stanford and Ari
zona.
This is because the Cardinal second
ary played well for the second week in a
row.
I've harped on the safeties and cor
ners for the entire season. They have
been the whipping boys on the field and
in the media. We have blamed them for
nearly every ounce of team failure this
year.
Deservedly so? Maybe.Through the
Washington State game two weeks ago,
the defense had been torched through
the air.Excluding Sacramento State, the
secondary had only given up 231.6 pass
ing yards and 1.4 touchdowns per game.
While these stats appear decent, they
fail to account for countless opposing
drives that consisted of quick pass after
quick pass after quick pass that disman
tled and exposed the entire defense.
More telling is the fact that three of
Stanford's top five tacklers (safety De
lano Howell and corners Johnson
Bademosi and Richard Sherman) are
members of the secondary. For weeks
on end, opposing teams found expo
nentially more success throwing quick
outs to their receivers than they did run
ning the football. I can't even begin to
count the times I've vocally and I
mean really vocally questioned the
decision to give receivers six yards of
cushion on every play.
After letting Washington State's Jeff
Tuel, of all people, go off for 298 yards
and four touchdowns, I couldn't help
but shiver at the sound of two pending
matchups with Jake Locker and Nick
Foles, who, despite injuries and mild dis
appointment, are two of the best quar
terbacking talents in the nation.
And what did the Cardinal second
ary do? First, it went into Seattle and
forced Locker, once a potential first
overall pick in the NFL Draft whose
value was upwards of $5O million, into a
7-14 passing performance for just 64
yards and two interceptions. It held
Husky receiver Jermaine Kearse, who
came into the game with 10 touch
downs on the year, to just four recep
tions for 53 yards. Although the defen
sive line deserves credit for making the
quarterback literally run for his life,
Stanford's secondary blanketed the
UW receivers and elicited one of the
worst performances of Locker's career.
Then Arizona, a top-15 team with a
top-10 defense and a potent passing at
tack, came into town looking to make a
statement and vault itself into BCS con
tention. Foles, who many pegged during
the preseason as a better quarterback
than Andrew Luck, was expected to
pick the secondary apart. We thought
the damage was inevitable, the question
was just how severe.
Foles threw 20 incompletions, one
interception and was held to just 248
yards. This same guy annihilated Ore
gon State to the tune of 440 yards and
three touchdowns. Suffice it to say, the
Stanford secondary was up to the task.
The implications are obvious. When
the secondary does its job, Luck and the
rest of the offense perform better. Dur
ing the heart of the defense's struggle,
the offense had to play mistake-free
football. It needed to score on every
possession, as punts routinely led to
points. But now, defensive holds at the
beginning of the game produce big
leads early, and this, in turn, allows for
more creativity and risk-taking, things
that make one of the nation's best of
fenses just that much more potent.
With three games remaining, the
Card looks poised to make a BCS bowl
appearance. While I'm sure most of you
will bombard me with our mathemati
cally slim chances for getting an at-large
bid if we fail to make the Rose Bowl, I'd
have to politely disagree and say that a
top-six BCS team that wins out will ulti
mately be chosen one way or another.
