### KABIR SAWHNEY MANAGING EDITOR 
With three strong performances in the
NorPac Tournament in Davidson, N.C.,
over the weekend, the Stanford field
hockey team (14-5, 5-1 NorPac) took
home its fourth consecutive conference
title. Sophomore defender Becky Dru
won the tournament's MVP award.
The Cardinal opened the tournament
on Thursday against Appalachian State
(3-12,1-5), the fifth time in six years the
two teams have faced off in the tourna
ment's opening round. With four straight
wins over the Mountaineers in NorPac
Tournament play entering last weekend,
the Card continued its success, notching a
10-3 win.
The scoring was evenly distributed for
Stanford with four players Dru, sopho
more forward Kelsey Lloyd, sophomore
forward Katie Mitchell and senior mid
fielder Xanthe Travlos netting two
goals apiece. The Cardinal offense simply
overpowered the Mountaineers, firing off
41 shots against just nine for Appalachian
State.
On Friday, Stanford faced off against
Longwood (7-13,4-2) in the tournament's
semifinals.
This time, the Cardinal offense gave
the team an early lead it scored three
goals in the first 25 minutes. Stanford
never looked back, with junior goalkeep
er Alessandra Moss making two saves in
the cage to notch her first shutout of the
season in the 3-0 win.
Like its match against Appalachian
State, Stanford found balance on offense,
without relying on a single scorer alone to
generate points. Dru, senior forward
