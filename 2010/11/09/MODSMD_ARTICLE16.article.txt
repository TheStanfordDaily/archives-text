# NORPAC CHAMPS
## 
### KABIR SAWHNEY MANAGING EDITOR 
With three strong performances in the
NorPac Tournament in Davidson, N.C.,
over the weekend, the Stanford field
hockey team (14-5, 5-1 NorPac) took
home its fourth consecutive conference
title. Sophomore defender Becky Dru
won the tournament's MVP award.
The Cardinal opened the tournament
on Thursday against Appalachian State
(3-12,1-5), the fifth time in six years the
two teams have faced off in the tourna
ment's opening round. With four straight
wins over the Mountaineers in NorPac
Tournament play entering last weekend,
the Card continued its success, notching a
10-3 win.
The scoring was evenly distributed for
Stanford with four players Dru, sopho
more forward Kelsey Lloyd, sophomore
forward Katie Mitchell and senior mid
fielder Xanthe Travlos netting two
goals apiece. The Cardinal offense simply
overpowered the Mountaineers, firing off
41 shots against just nine for Appalachian
State.
On Friday, Stanford faced off against
Longwood (7-13,4-2) in the tournament's
semifinals.
This time, the Cardinal offense gave
the team an early lead it scored three
goals in the first 25 minutes. Stanford
never looked back, with junior goalkeep
er Alessandra Moss making two saves in
the cage to notch her first shutout of the
season in the 3-0 win.
Like its match against Appalachian
State, Stanford found balance on offense,
without relying on a single scorer alone to
generate points. Dru, senior forward
Katherine Swank and freshman forward

Sophomore Becky Dru was named MVP of the NorPac conference tournament. Despite being listed as
a defender, Dru scored five goals and had three assists in Stanford's tournament championship.
Emily Henriksson each scored a
goal, while Travlos pitched in two as
sists and Dru added one of her own.
With its win over Longwood, the
Cardinal advanced to its fourth
straight conference final, where it
faced a familiar foe in rival Califor
nia (10-9,5-1). Stanford has squared
off against the Golden Bears in the
last four NorPac Tournament finals,
and coming into Saturday's match, it
was riding a three-game win streak
against Cal in tournament play. The
Card extended that streak to four
with a 2-0 victory to earn its fourth
consecutive conference crown.
Against the Golden Bears, there
would be none of the scoring balance
that had characterized Stanford's
early tournament wins. Dru took the
game into her own hands, scoring
two goals in the first 20 minutes to
give the Card another early lead.

Travlos added an assist on Dru's sec
ond goal.
The performance in the title
game sealed the NorPac Tourna
ment MVP award for Dru. She fin
ished the tournament with five goals,
three assists and 20 shots to her
name.
However, the real story for Stan
ford in the Cal match was the
strength of its defense. The Cardinal
held a 16-3 advantage in shot at
tempts, and Moss made two saves to
take her second shutout in two days.
Next up for the Cardinal is a play
in game for the NCAA Tournament.
The NorPac Conference doesn't re
ceive an automatic berth for its
championship into the tournament,
so Stanford will take on the Atlantic
-10 champion University of Massa
chusetts Minutewomen today to de
termine who will move on. Stanford
has won two of its last three NCAA
play-in games, including a 3-2 over
time victory over Boston University
last year.
Stanford will take on Massachu
setts with an NCAA Tournament

berth on the line at 10 a.m. PST on
Tuesday in Amherst, Mass.
