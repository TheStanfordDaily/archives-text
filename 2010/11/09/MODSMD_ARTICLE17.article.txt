## Women's soccer earns No.1 seed 
### â€” Nate Adams 
A day after sealing the Pac-10 title, the Cardi
nal learned today that its undefeated effort in the
regular season has put the team in excellent posi
tion to pursue its next goal, a national champi
onship. Top-ranked Stanford (18-0-2, 9-0-0 Pac
-10) has earned a No. 1 seed in the 64-team NCAA
Tournament field, a rank that grants the team
home-field advantage for the first two rounds.
Stanford will begin its postseason against
Sacramento State (9-9-1) at Laird Q. Cagan Sta

dium on Friday at 7 p.m. That match comes on
the heels of a 4:30 p.m. contest between Santa
Clara (12-6-2) and Long Beach State (14-5-2),
which Stanford will also host. The winners of
those games will play each other on Sunday at 1
p.m.
Fresh off its second consecutive undefeated
season and riding a 17-game winning streak, the
Cardinal enters the tournament as the unani
mous No. 1 team. The other No. 1 seeds are Port
land, Maryland and North Carolina. Stanford
fought through two overtimes to force a draw
with 2009 champion North Carolina in August

and defeated Portland, 2-1, in late September.
The Tar Heels defeated Stanford in last season's
NCAA Tournament final. The Cardinal hasn't
faced Maryland this season.
Sacramento State earned its way into the
NCAAs for the second time in school history
after defeating a powerful Northern Arizona
team, 1-0, in the final game of the Big Sky Con
ference Tournament. The only other time the
Hornets advanced to the national tournament,
Stanford defeated them, 7-0, in the first round.
