# Cards captain of consistency
## 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
On Sept. 7, 2007, a freshman midfielder on the Stan
ford men's soccer team came off the bench in the
23rd minute of a 1-0 loss to Wisconsin and finished
the game with one shot that sailed wide. It was the
otherwise unremarkable second game of a season in
which the Cardinal would finish 7-6-5 overall. It was also the first
and only time in his Stanford career senior defender and captain
Bobby Warshaw did not start a match for the Cardinal.
In four years on the Farm, the 21-year-old Warshaw has com
piled a heady soccer resume 18 goals, five assists, 41 total points,
three-time team scoring leader and two-time All-Pac-10 selection.
In the four years and 73 games Warshaw has played, the team has
won 31 times. Warshaw has 10 game-winning goals.
Last season, Warshaw became just the fifth Stanford men's soc
cer player ever to be named to the NCAA Division I All-Ameri
can first team. He is also a Hermann Trophy semifinalist and a fi
nalist for the Lowe's Senior CLASS Award, with a good chance of
being named an Academic All-American for the second consecu
tive year.
The list goes on, but when asked what being named to so many

All-American teams and trophy lists
meant to him, Warshaw replied in his
typical blue-collar fashion.
"All of that doesn't mean that
much to be honest, because it's more
about winning games and champi
onships than awards for me," he said.
"It's an honor and I respect it and re
ally appreciate all of them, but to win
any award and not make the NCAA
Tournament is a really crappy feel
ing. So if I could win games and not
awards, I would take that in a heart
beat."
Unlike previous Stanford stand
outs, Warshaw has had the difficult
task of making multiple position
changes.
As a highly-touted recruit from
Mechanicsburg, Pa., Warshaw quick
ly found a spot in the Cardinal's line
up as an attacking midfielder, consis
tently getting forward and becoming
the first freshman to lead Stanford in
scoring since 1991. But after some
shuffling the next year, head coach
Bret Simon needed Warshaw to play
as a forward, away from his natural
midfield position. Facing a tradition
ally difficult transition, Warshaw
started every game and again led the
team in goals with three.
The next year, however, saw the
departures of several key defenders,
and Simon asked Warshaw to move
all the way back to central defense.
The team took off, led by a defense
that allowed just 18 goals, and War
shaw still found ways to score, lead
ing the team with a career-high six on
just 21 shots.
"Soccer is soccer," Warshaw said.
"It's the same sport no matter what
position you're at. I'm not a forward,
not a midfielder. I believe I'm a soc
cer player. Yes, I'd like to be part of
more of the creativity and excite
ment up the field, but if it helps us
win games, then I'm happy to stay

back. And no matter what, I'm going
to do the best that I can."
The best that Warshaw can do has
been a great deal, but when you ask
teammates what about Bobby
makes him so good, it isn't his techni
cal skills, but rather his competitive
fire.

"I believe he has this little thing
inside of him, something extra that
makes everything a competition,"
said redshirt senior Thiago Sa Freire.
"Add in the fact that he is by far the
hardest worker I have played with
on any level, and Bobby is just all
about excellence."
Simon said that a lot of what the
team does begins and ends with War
shaw.
"He always trains so hard, it real
ly sets the tone for the training and
everything we do on and off the
field," he said. "He's the catalyst, if
you will, and his willingness to out
work people is something that leaves
a mark on a team for quite a number
of years."
Redshirt freshman goalie Jason
Dodson also commented on War
shaw's seemingly religious commit
ment.
"Bobby definitely has a conta
gious work ethic and his attention
and commitment to detail is remark

able," he said. "He won't accept any
thing less than perfection. But he
also brings an energy you can feed
off of. He's always going, and it's al
ways something you can get behind
as a team."
Sophomore midfielder Hunter
Gorskie said that much of the impact
of the player whom teammates af
fectionately refer to as "Bob" came
off the pitch.
"He's a great guy to hang out with
and a great friend off the field, and a
lot of what he does is trying to make
it so people are doing the right things
all the time," Gorskie said. "He is all
about the game and not letting op
portunities get away."
The focus on a winning attitude is
perhaps the hallmark of Warshaw's
time at Stanford.
"The biggest thing for me has
been rebuilding a winning mentality,
an atmosphere of winning and being
good," he said. "If you get into a pat
tern where you make a bad pass in
training and you tell yourself it's OK,
or if you lose a game in practice you
say, 'That's OK, that's just what we
do,' you have to learn that it's not
OK."
Being a perfectionist on the field,
however, hasn't stopped Warshaw
from acknowledging that much of
college soccer is about the bonds
that it forms. When given the chance
to name his favorite experience at
Stanford, Warshaw didn't hesitate.
"The guys, the teammates, that's
the best part. In any sport you're
going to win games and lose games,"
he said. "The results and scores will
change, but your friends and team
mates at lunch and at parties and at
practice that's what will be re
membered."
Thursday afternoon at Cal, War
shaw and his "family" will have one
last chance to show off the talent and
leadership that have MLS teams
calling to check on one of Stanford's
brightest soccer stars.
