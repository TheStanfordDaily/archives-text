# Holding court at home
## Water polo extends home win streak 
### DASH DAVIDSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The No. 4 Stanford men's water
polo team had two big days at home
this past weekend, vanquishing a pair
of top opponents in Long Beach
State and UC-Irvine.
The Cardinal (12-5, 5-1 MPSF)
added to its streak of strong perform
ances at Avery Aquatic Center, with
its two victories over the weekend
contributing to a home winning
streak that currently stands at 13
games and dates all the way back to
the 2008 season. That streak bodes
well for the end of Stanford's season,
as the Mountain Pacific Sports Fed
eration (MPSF) Tournament will be
hosted at Avery Aquatic Center over
Thanksgiving break.
Saturday afternoon's contest saw
No. 8 Long Beach State taking to the
pool against the Cardinal. An unusu
ally high amount of physicality char
acterized the game the first quar
ter alone had 11 penalties called on
the two teams.
Stanford stayed strong in the face
of aggressive play by the 49ers. It
managed to keep its composure, exe
cute on penalty shots, take advantage
of unbalanced goal-scoring situa
tions and hang on for a hard-fought
11-6 victory.
Junior driver Jacob Smith had an
other big day for the Cardinal, scor
ing four times. Senior utility Jeffrey
Schwimer, Smith's main partner for
carrying the offense over Stanford's
past few games, did not disappoint ei
ther, scoring three goals of his own.
Senior driver Sage Wright, junior
driver Ryan Kent and sophomore
driver Paul Rudolph rounded out
the scoring for the Cardinal. Red
shirt junior goalie Brian Pingree was
staunch in the net, holding down the
49ers with eight saves.
