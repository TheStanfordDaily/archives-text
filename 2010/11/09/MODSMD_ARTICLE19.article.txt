# Holding court at home
## Water polo extends home win streak 
### DASH DAVIDSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The No. 4 Stanford men's water
polo team had two big days at home
this past weekend, vanquishing a pair
of top opponents in Long Beach
State and UC-Irvine.
The Cardinal (12-5, 5-1 MPSF)
added to its streak of strong perform
ances at Avery Aquatic Center, with
its two victories over the weekend
contributing to a home winning
streak that currently stands at 13
games and dates all the way back to
the 2008 season. That streak bodes
well for the end of Stanford's season,
as the Mountain Pacific Sports Fed
eration (MPSF) Tournament will be
hosted at Avery Aquatic Center over
Thanksgiving break.
Saturday afternoon's contest saw
No. 8 Long Beach State taking to the
pool against the Cardinal. An unusu
ally high amount of physicality char
acterized the game the first quar
ter alone had 11 penalties called on
the two teams.
Stanford stayed strong in the face
of aggressive play by the 49ers. It
managed to keep its composure, exe
cute on penalty shots, take advantage
of unbalanced goal-scoring situa
tions and hang on for a hard-fought
11-6 victory.
Junior driver Jacob Smith had an
other big day for the Cardinal, scor
ing four times. Senior utility Jeffrey
Schwimer, Smith's main partner for
carrying the offense over Stanford's
past few games, did not disappoint ei
ther, scoring three goals of his own.
Senior driver Sage Wright, junior
driver Ryan Kent and sophomore
driver Paul Rudolph rounded out
the scoring for the Cardinal. Red
shirt junior goalie Brian Pingree was
staunch in the net, holding down the
49ers with eight saves.

MEN'S WATER POLO

11/7 vs. UC Irvine W 7-2

UP NEXT

UC DAVIS
(15-8)

11/12 Davis, Calif.
6 RM. EST

GAME NOTES: Stanford enters the final week
of its season on a season-high five-game
winning streak. The Cardinal hopes to ride
that wave of momentum into the upcoming
MPSF tournament. UC Davis comes in hav
ing lost its last two matches.

Sunday, in the rain, the Cardinal
battled No. 5 UC-Irvine, with second
place in the MPSF standings on the
line. Stanford used its best defensive
showing in weeks to hold down the
Anteaters for a 7-2 victory.
Despite rainy conditions, the Car
dinal got off to a hot start and never
looked back. The Stanford squad
scored three goals in each of the first
two quarters of the game, while man
aging to hold UC-Irvine off the
board completely until the five
minute mark of the third period.
Stanford continued to use the
same formula for success, with
Smith, Schwimer and Wright han
dling most of the offensive output
and Pingree locking down the de
fense.
Both factors in the formula came
through on Sunday, with Smith and
Wright netting three goals each,
Schwimer accounting for the other
one and Pingree performing won
derfully, totaling 11 saves in perhaps
his best game since his dominant
showing of 14 saves against USC on
Oct. 9.
With these two in-conference
victories, Stanford is securely in sec
ond place in the MPSF standings,
trailing only top-ranked California.
These two teams may very well be
No. 1 and No. 2 in the conference
when they meet for the final game of
the season the final tune-up be
fore the MPSF Tournament kicks off
on Nov. 19 in Berkeley.
In order to make that a possibili
ty, Stanford needs to take care of
business against UC-Davis, which is
not in the MPSF, and Pacific, which
is currently ranked No. 7 in the
country. The Card will travel to
Davis, Calif., to take on the Aggies
on Friday.
