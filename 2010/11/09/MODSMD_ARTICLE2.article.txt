### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€” Ryan Mac 
A resident in Casa Italiana has
been hospitalized with a bacterial form
of meningitis, according to residents
and staff members of the Italian
themed Row house.
Ira Friedman, director of Vaden
Health Center, spoke to the house's
residents last night regarding the iso
lated case, offering the option of re
ceiving antibiotics as a precautionary
measure against possible exposure.
Staff members did not release the
name of the infected student.
Jack Jorgensen 'l2, financial man
ager at Casa Italiana, described the res
idents' meeting with Friedman, calling
the talk "an overview" of the situation.
"There really is nothing we have to
do right now," he said. "They offered,
as they do with other cases of infected
people ... antibiotics to those who had
close contact with the resident as a pre
cautionary measure, but that was up to
students to decide."
Jorgensen went on to confirm that
students did not express a desire to
move out of the house in light of the sit
uation.
According to the Center for Dis
ease Control, "meningitis is a disease
caused by the inflammation of the pro
tective membranes covering the brain
and spinal cord." The illness can devel
op due to viruses or bacteria, but only
the bacterial form is treatable with an
tibiotics.
Fever, headache and a stiff neck
characterize the onset of meningitis,
later followed by nausea, vomiting,
sensitivity to light or altered mental
states. The bacterial form of the disease
can be transferred through the air or
by contact with infected throat secre
tions.
About 10 percent of those infected
with meningitis die of the disease.
