# Clooney, Prendergast talk Sudan
## Students attend Cubberley event 
### ALEX YU CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The political geography of Africa
may change radically on Jan. 9,2011. As
a result of referendums stemming from
the 2005 Comprehensive Peace Agree
ment in Sudan, southern Sudan will
vote on its independence, deciding
whether to remain part of the north or
become its own state.
January's referendum was the topic
of discussion on Monday night at Cub
berley Auditorium, where approxi
mately 400 people gathered to listen to
John Prendergast, co-founder of the
anti-genocide Enough Project, and
George Clooney, actor and United Na
tions "Messenger of Peace," discuss the
upcoming referendum and the future
of the Sudanese state.
Stanford STAND, a student anti
genocide group, which in June received
national attention for its campaign
against "conflict minerals" in the De
mocratic Republic of Congo, co-part
nered with Crothers Memorial Hall,
the global citizenship academic theme
dorm, to sponsor this event.
The Freeman Spogli Institute invit
ed Prendergast, who has written 10
books on Africa, as a visiting professor

from Nov. 1 to 12. During his visit,
sponsored by the Charles Riddell
Fund, he has given a number of talks,
his first entitled "The Good News from
Africa: Success Stories and their Impli
cations" on Nov. 4.
Along with STAND, political sci
ence professor Stephen Stedman,
Crothers resident fellow, also coordi
nated with Prendergast to organize
Monday's event.
Stedman moderated Monday's
talk, introducing Clooney and Pren
dergast to the audience. Crothers
theme associate and STAND member
Alice Bosley 'll, STAND co-president
Mia Newman 'l2 and STAND co-pres
ident Marloes Sijstermans 'll joined
Stedman in guiding the talk. Prender
gast began discussion by describing the
current conflict with the Sudanese ref
erendum.
"Now, here we are, 60 days away
from the conclusion of [the 2005 Com
prehensive Peace Agreement]," Pren
dergast said. "The fact is that the north
does not want to give up the south be
cause it has most of the oil."
Newman guided the conversation
to discuss the notion that southern

Sudan is the victim of northern Sudan's subjugation.
Prendergast affirmed the multifaceted nature of the situ
ation in Sudan but stressed that the majority of human
rights violations can be credited to the oppressive Su
danese government located in northern Sudan.
"There is a lot of blood on a lot of hands in southern
Sudan," Prendergast said. However, "the vast preponder
ance of the human rights violations were committed by
the forces of the government of Sudan and the associat
ed militia."
Grounding the conversation in realistic terms for
politicians, Clooney implied the need to incentivize Unit
ed States intervention in Sudan by highlighting the im
mense benefit of interceding the conflict: the opportuni
ty to tap into the Sudanese oil wells.
Sudan "also happens to be a place where we could use
some oil," Clooney said. From the perspective of United
States politics, he added, "we could dip into that oil well
as well."
Prendergast discussed the possible objectives U.S. in
tervention could have. "What the government in Sudan
spends all their time talking about is when can they get to
roll back all the American sanctions, to get off the terror
ist list, to remove all the scarlet letters on their vests that
the U.S. has been putting on them for years," Prendergast
said. "The Sudanese government cares about these
sometimes symbolic economic and political points of iso
lation."
In Prendergast's opinion, though, the real potential to
invoke change in Sudan emerges at the local level, partic
ularly at politically active institutions such as Stanford.
"If you want to make a change somewhere, you have
to have the political will," Prendergast said. "Political will
has been generated over the last number of years be
cause of schools like Stanford, which has generated stu
dent movements with respect to Darfur and south
Sudan."
Clooney concluded the discussion, expressing opti
mism in placing the future of Sudan in the hands of the
individual and exhorting the audience to speak out
against allowing ambivalence to exacerbate the Sudan
conflict.
"We have always in our lifetime caught these things
after they happened," Clooney stressed. "We were late to
Rwanda. We were late to Bosnia. We were late to Darfur.
You have an opportunity that has never happened be
fore: to stop it before it happens ... your voice right now
can save lives."
