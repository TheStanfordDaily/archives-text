## University encourages juniors to declare 
### CAITY MONROE DESK EDITOR 
Axess has been open for winter course
enrollment since Oct. 24, but currently un
declared juniors are unable to register due
to the hold placed on their accounts pre
venting winter quarter enrollment. Though
technically required to choose a major by
the end of sophomore year, a handful of

juniors delay this deadline until the end of
fall quarter of junior year.
At the beginning of fall quarter this
year, 471 juniors had yet to officially choose
a major, which was down from the 505 un
declared juniors in the fall of 2009. As of
Monday, there were 218 undeclared jun
iors.
The account holds, which will be lifted
once the students declare their majors, is a

final attempt to encourage students to
move from academic exploration to a par
ticular focus. It is also meant to provide stu
dents with the necessary push to seek de
partmental or Undergraduate Advising
and Research (UAR) advising instead of
continuing to put off the paperwork in
volved in declaring a major.
"The ones who have come to talk
to me have known what it is they
want to declare mostly they have
just had a lot of inertia," said UAR
academic director Kristin Black. "I
think it was actually a good thing that
they had a hold on their account so
that they would go and talk to their
department."
A host of new or intensified ef
forts to help students declare are
available for students well before the
ultimate hold on undeclared juniors'
accounts. According to Dean of Un
dergraduate Advising Julie Lythcott-
Haims 'B9, those efforts include Ma
jors Night, Sophomore Symposium,
an academic "agora" and the new
freshman requirement of regular
meetings with pre-major advisors.
Lythcott-Haims hopes these ef
forts will help more students declare
their majors during their sophomore
year.
"I hope that over the next couple

of years we'll drive that undeclared
junior number down to as close to
zero as possible," she said.
Stanford offers more than 80 ma
jors and considerably more sub
fields. Such variety is conducive to
academic freedom and exploration,
but it can make the selection process
daunting.
Daniel Ong 'l2, who declared his
major in computer science just last
week, had difficulties deciding on a
major after taking classes in a variety
of disciplines all of which he en
joyed.
"When you come to Stanford,
they give you a lot of latitude ...
when you explore classes you find
out the stuff you like and are able to
do," he said.
Ong, who started out interested in
political science, has pursued a few
potential majors. This doesn't bother
him, though, because of the less-ex
tensive minor requirements of many
of those departments.
"The minor system is pretty awe
some too," he said. "When you go
down a few wrong routes you can
still graduate with minors."
Black agreed that spending the

first few quarters at Stanford unde
clared helps open students' minds to
new areas of interest. She was quick
to emphasize, though, that waiting
too long can prevent students from
fulfilling the potential of their under
graduate education.
"I want students to get connected
to a department so they can start get
ting the benefits of actually having a
major," she said. "There are a lot of
resources through a department and
once you've declared you have ac
cess to those resources much better
than before you declare."
Lythcott-Haims also emphasized
the importance of choosing a "disci
plinary home" in order to take ad
vantage of the resources each de
partment has to offer.
"The study of the major is a cen
tral facet of the undergraduate expe
rience," Lythcott-Haims said. "A stu
dent who has not found a discipli
nary home by the start of the junior
year risks not being able to take ad
vantage of what it means to have a
major."
Lythcott-Haims cited the oppor
tunity to get to know faculty, the pos
sibility of doing research and the

sense of belonging to a "community
of scholars by participating in events
sponsored by the department, for
mal advising, and informal mentor
ing" as some of the benefits afforded
to those with a declared major.
