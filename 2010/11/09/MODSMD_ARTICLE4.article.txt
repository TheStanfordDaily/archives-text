## University encourages juniors to declare 
### CAITY MONROE DESK EDITOR 
Axess has been open for winter course
enrollment since Oct. 24, but currently un
declared juniors are unable to register due
to the hold placed on their accounts pre
venting winter quarter enrollment. Though
technically required to choose a major by
the end of sophomore year, a handful of

juniors delay this deadline until the end of
fall quarter of junior year.
At the beginning of fall quarter this
year, 471 juniors had yet to officially choose
a major, which was down from the 505 un
declared juniors in the fall of 2009. As of
Monday, there were 218 undeclared jun
iors.
The account holds, which will be lifted
once the students declare their majors, is a

final attempt to encourage students to
move from academic exploration to a par
ticular focus. It is also meant to provide stu
dents with the necessary push to seek de
partmental or Undergraduate Advising
and Research (UAR) advising instead of
continuing to put off the paperwork in
volved in declaring a major.
