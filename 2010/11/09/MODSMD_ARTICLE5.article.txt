## Event looks at race, gender, sexuality Stanford Students for Queer Liberation hosts 'Intersections' 
### MARGARET RAWSON DESK EDITOR 
A Monday lunch discussion on "Immi
gration as a Queer Issue" marked the be
ginning of "Intersections," a series of
events this week sponsored by Stanford
Students for Queer Liberation. "Intersec
tions," currently in its first year, is being
billed as "a week of exploring and celebrat
ing the intersections of race, gender and
queer sexuality."
The week of events aims to highlight the
connectedness of these issues, said Alok
Vaid-Menon 'l3, co-president of Stanford
Students for Queer Liberation, previously
known as the Emma Goldman Society.
"Most gay rights organizing doesn't
bring up race," Vaid-Menon said. "We're
trying to dispel the notion that racial jus
tice and gay rights are separate causes. You
can't fight for one without talking about
the other."
The event aims to "bring a lot of people
into the room, into the audience, that might
not interact otherwise," said Holly Fetter
'l3, co-president of Stanford Students for
Queer Liberation.
"Intersections" will include a discussion
on indigenous queer identity, a panel of
local transgender-identified activists of
color and an open forum for discussion,
among other events. The weeklong series is
co-sponsored by 24 other student
groups, Fetter said.
As a few dozen students sat at
tentively Monday in El Centro
Chicano, Neil Grungras, founder
and executive director of the Orga
nization for Refuge, Asylum and
Migration (ORAM), and Chris
Barnett of Out4lmmigration spoke
about their work to help LGBT in
dividuals escape persecution.
"We are one big family ... we
need to start taking responsibility
for one another," Grungras said.
The ORAM, founded in 2008,
advocates for refugees fleeing sex
ual and gender-based persecution
worldwide.
Grungras stressed that the
biggest obstacle for LGBT
refugees is finding protection.
Many LGBT refugees become
stuck in hiding in countries of tran
sit because they face difficulty in
coming to the United States.
Seventy-five countries criminal
ize same-sex relations, of which
seven apply the death penalty,
Grungras said. The process of com
ing out and seeking a safe haven
can be both extremely frightening
and deeply shaming, he added.
"Things are improving because
we're talking about the issue,"
Grungras said.
When asked about his work ad
vocating for refugees, a community
often aided by the Catholic
Church, Grungras spoke about
"finding a common ground to alle
viate suffering," rather than cutting
ties with the Church by pushing too
hard for language concerning
same-sex marriage.
Grungras said his emphasis to
the Catholic community is "we just

want a home," and refugees should
be granted this right without re
gard to sexual orientation.
Eric Griffis 'l2 and Imani
Franklin 'l2 were two students in
attendance.
"It's really important to empha
size that these issues don't fit into
strict categories," Griffis said after
the discussion.
Franklin expressed her desire to
find away to reach out to different
people with these events.
"I hope students outside of the
queer community and communi
ties interested in immigration were
present," Franklin said.
"I hope we weren't speaking too
much to the choir," she added.
Michael Picasso 'l2 commented
on the goal of the week and why he
thinks integration of different top
ics is important.
"As a queer person of color, it's
very important to talk about how
mainstream issues are affecting
queer people differently . . . and
how queer issues affect queer peo
ple of color differently."
Fermin Mendoza 'll said the
event was "very reaffirming" for
him as an immigrant and queer
person and reflected on his identi
ty as a queer immigrant in a
Catholic family.
"It's hard being stuck in both
worlds," he said. "This is inspiring
me to build bridges between both
communities."
"Intersections" includes
lunchtime and evening events
Tuesday through Friday and will
culminate in a vogue dance per
formance and panel by local
dancers from the House of Revlon
Friday at 7 p.m. in the A3C ball
room. An unannounced, direct ac
tion event will also take place on
Monday, Nov. 15.
