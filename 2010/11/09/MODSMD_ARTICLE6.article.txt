## Stanford gets high sustainability marks 
### CAROLINE CHEN STAFF WRITER 
For the third year in a row, Stanford re
ceived an A- in the Sustainable Endow
ment Institute's annual Green Report
Card, earning it an "Overall College Sus
tainability Leader" designation. The re
port card reflects a surge in sustainability
initiatives on campus, but both the admin

istration and student leaders believe there
is much room for improvement.
Stanford's scores in the annual report
card have been steadily rising over the last
five years. This year, it earned an A in eight
out of the nine categories, and the overall
A- grade places Stanford on par with Har
vard and Princeton, while Yale earned an
A and Cal a B+.
Notably, Stanford raised its climate and

energy score from a B to an A this year. Fah
mida Ahmed, director of the Office of Sus
tainability, credited this improvement to the
school's new energy and climate plan,
which was released in late 2009. According
to the fact sheet online, the plan proposes
that by 2020, Stanford will reduce its
greenhouse gas emissions 20 percent from

1990 levels and its domestic water
consumption by 18 percent.
"We now have a path that we will
follow to reduce our emissions sys
tematically and progressively,"
Ahmed said.
Stanford received a C in the en
dowment transparency category,
which is the same grade it has gotten
in that category since 2007. This ap
pears to be a trend among Stanford's
peer universities, many of which have
similar reports with straight As except
for a C or D in endowment trans
parency.
"That's a complex issue to try to
tackle," said Molly Oshun, 'll, presi

dent of Students for a Sustainable
Stanford (SSS). "But given the size
and influence of our university, en
dowment transparency has the po
tential to influence a lot of invest
ment policies across the country and
across the globe. So I think moving
that step forward ... would be a real
ly big improvement."
TTie report also suggests that Stan
ford has been focusing its sustainabili
ty efforts more on large-scale projects
than at an individual level. In re
sponse, student groups on campus are
working to engage the student popu
lation this year with a number of im
portant new initiatives. SSS has just
started a Green Events Consulting
Program, which will pair up trained
SSS students with student organiza
tions to help make campus events
more sustainable. This spring, the
Green Alliance for Innovative Action

and the ASSU are collaborating with
the Student Organizing Committee
for the Arts to produce a three-day
arts festival focused on local and glob
al sustainability challenges.
There are also long-term goals to
create a green-living themed dormi
tory on campus, complete with sus
tainable technology, and SSS has
also proposed to add a "sustainable
civilizations" option to the Global
Citizenship GER requirement.
Their proposal is currently under re
view.
Overall, the leaders in the sus
tainable Stanford movement are op
timistic.
"There is exponential growth in
student interest," said Theo Gibbs
'll, ASSU executive chair of sustain
ability initiatives. "Students are
thinking about [sustainability] more
because there are a lot of classes

touching on these issues, and student
initiatives have a high visibility on
campus."
Ahmed agreed about growing in
terest on campus.
"I see interest everywhere," she
said. "I see faculty more open to col
laboration, and staff working harder
than ever to make sure everything
they do is integrated with the princi
ples of sustainability. People know
that sustainability is a priority for the
University."
Ahmed urged students not to be
complacent about their part in pro
moting a green Stanford.
"No student should feel helpless,"
Ahmed said. "Individual action com
bined can make a huge impact. Every
action counts. Every bit counts."
