## New extension causes privacy concerns on Web RCCs discuss University's stance toward 'Firesheep' add-on 
### VIVIAN SHEN 
A recently released extension for the Mozilla
Firefox Web browser highlights a serious security
flaw in many major websites, including Facebook,
Amazon and Twitter. The extension, Firesheep, al
lows any user to impersonate another person on
these websites and potentially induce heavy social
consequences.
"It's not really hacking into other people's ac
counts because you don't steal passwords," said
Zahan Malkani 'l2, residential computer consultant
(RCC) in East Florence Moore Flail. "This is essen
tially assuming other people's identities."
"To log in to one of these sites you need to log in
and identify yourself, which creates a unique identi
fier," he said. "But, you don't need to identify your
self again at any page, and people in the same net
work with this plug-in can take your previously cre
ated unique identifier and be you."
Because most Stanford students work on the

same wireless network and the traf
fic is unencrypted or not scram
bled in away that only the sender
and receiver can understand any
one can grab someone's unique
identifier authentication cookie as
he or she interacts with the server.
"It's like having a conversation in
a public coffee house," said Rincona
da RCC Brian White 'l2. "And any
one can hear other conversations
and use that information."
This general problem has been
around since the beginning of these
websites, except before it would take
a particularly skilled programmer to
work around the security flaws and
actually obtain information. Now,
Firesheep makes it simple for any
one with the same wireless connec

tion to access other people's ac
counts, allowing them to use any
one's accounts on certain websites as
if he or she were the actual owner.
Though the ramifications of the
extension are mostly social conse
quences, an attack could seriously
damage someone's reputation or
compromise personal information.
For example, someone could imper
sonate another person on Facebook
and change his or her status, or go
through personal messages the
possibilities are extensive. As of now,
there have been no reported cases of
severely malicious use of this plug-in
most of the incidents have been
more minor jokes or pranks — but it
is still dangerous to be vulnerable to
such a large community using the
same wireless network.
"The most shocking thing is that
it's so easy to exploit," White said.
"The potential damages are obvious
ly pretty major concerns, but the true
fear is that these websites have such

major security flaws."
There are multiple ways to pre
vent such attacks from happening.
On the website company's side, the
company could encrypt all traffic be
tween the user and the server to pro
tect other users from accessing it.
However, this is a costly and lengthy
process, so students cannot expect to
rely on the companies for safety.
There are also simpler steps that
the user may take to protect him or
herself. There is currently a Firefox
extension that a user can down
loaded that requires sites to use a se
cure connection through HTTPS in
stead of the regular HTTP and en
crypts every page visited. Using a
wired connection would prevent
such attacks as well. Simply remem
bering to log off these sites in ad
dition to not logging onto any of
these websites at all would also
help prevent attacks, because the
unique identifier is deleted once a
session is over.

The University administration
has already taken a firm stance
against the use of the plug-in, White
said.
"Basically, the administration
equates using the plug-in to identity
theft," said White. "It's a really stupid
reason to get suspended from Stan
ford. They're sending the message
that this isn't something to be played
with lightly."
Jose Valdez, a network adminis
trator for academic computing serv
ices, also emphasized the severity of
an infraction of this kind.
Forgery or other misrepresenta
tion of one's identity through elec
tronic communication, like other
types of communication, is a Funda
mental Standard violation, Valdez
said in an e-mail to The Daily, adding
that prosecution under state or fed
eral laws may apply.
