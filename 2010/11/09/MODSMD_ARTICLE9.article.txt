f f w disagree with you, but I'm pretty sure
you're not Hitler."
"I prefer facts, nuance and intellectual debate."
"One of us, or perhaps neither of us, may be right."
"Death to nobody."
These were a few signs waved at the Rally to Restore
Sanity and March to Keep Fear Alive, attended by at least
a handful of Stanford students on Oct. 30 in Washington,
D.C.
Any event that claims to be like "Woodstock, but with
the nudity and drugs replaced by respectful disagree
ment," is bound to be different than your average gather
ing. Television satirists Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert
took on this challenge. Stewart, well known for political
satire on "The Daily Show," dared America to join him in
Washington, D.C., to promote rationality. Attendance
topped 215,000, according to some estimates.
Colbert, host of "The Colbert Report," immediately
opposed this, announcing the March to Keep Fear Alive.
The day of, he tried to scare the audience with a false at
tack by killer bees. The amusing tete-a-tete between Col
bert and Stewart involved arguments about who is "more
American" and whether or not citizens should cower in
fear. Guest performers also stole the stage, from Sheryl
Crowe to the Discovery Channel's Mythßusters.
Students from Stanford in Washington had a special
section reserved nearer to the stage, Adam Adler'l2, who
interns at the Capitol, made his way there six hours be
fore the event. After small talk and mingling, he said
everyone was genuinely thrilled to participate.
"Since we came as fans of' The Daily Show,' we shared
the same moderate approach to rallying," Adler said.
The attendees were diverse, with members of differ
ent political parties and ethnicities.
"Talking to people from all over kept conversation in
teresting," Adler noted.
Adler contributed by making a sign prioritizing fears,

with bears and girls listed as severe threats.
"Leading up to rally, I worried that Stewart would be
controversial," he said. "He did a good job of not attack
ing specific political figures or views."
What began as a mockery of Glenn Beck's Rally to
Restore Honor this summer actually shed light on how
individuals go about political movements, according to
Adler. The rally showed how humor is funniest when it
contains truth, and humor reveals societal assumptions
that seem ludicrous when we stop to think, he said.
Joshua Khani 'll flew to D.C. from Stanford to see
Stewart and Colbert in action. He explained that he pur
sues reason in political discourse by encouraging open
mindedness. In his opinion, individuals must judge a situ
ation by its context, not by personal preconceptions, he
said.
"It seems silly to blame-shift," Khani said. "The para
dox of selfishness is that when we justify harming others,
we excuse others to harm us."
He pointed to the media's role in propagating radical
ism.
"The media targets groups of people and creates a
fear that wasn't there before, but we're all using some sort
of reason to get where we are," Khani said. "Issues arise
when everyone acts as if others don't have good inten
tions at heart."
A concluding speech by Stewart was a call to action,
using the analogy of a busy highway for worldwide team
work.
"Yet these millions of cars must somehow find away
to squeeze one by one into a mile-long, 30-foot wide tun
nel," he said, highlighting that society is based on com
promise. "And they do it, concession by concession. You
go. Then I'll go."
The final words struck a chord with Khani, who be
lieves that this mutual understanding is continually
achievable.
"It's only when you cause all this shouting that there's
aggression towards one another," he said. "We already
have this ability to interact peacefully, so just work with
it."
