The Daily e-mailed faculty a short ques
tionnaire that strayed beyond their
work at Stanford. Here is a glimpse into
the personalities behind your profes
sors.
Joshua Landy
Hometown: Cambridge, Eng
land. But I've lost the accent, ap
parently.
Undergrad alma mater and
major: French and German,
Cambridge.
Grad school and degree:
Comparative Literature, Prince
ton.
Hobbies: football (which for
some reason in these parts is
pronounced "soccer").
#1 on your playlist:
looks like a three-way tie right
now between "Bad Ro
mance," "Dance Music"
(The Mountain Goats) and
"Comfortably Numb."
Currently reading: Joseph O'Neill, "Nether
land."
Favorite book: There's only one contender
here: Marcel Proust, "In Search of Lost Time."
You wouldn't mind being a character in:
a Sherlock Holmes film (preferably the Robert
Downey, Jr. version).
If you could live in any time period, it
would be: 1850s France, except with indoor
plumbing and penicillin.
You have never: given up hope that Liverpool
will win their 19th league title.
If you hadn't gone into academia, you'd
be: doomed.
w
u
Department: French & Italian.
Classes taught: In addition to my Fall IHUM
("The Art of Living"), I regularly teach "Philosophy
and Literature" (winter) and, periodically, a class
called "Getting Through Proust."
Primary research interest/project: My
work is mostly about the value of literature for
life. Some literature is, of course, mere enter
tainment, but some of it allows us to become
better at specific mental activities, some of it
helps us to discover who we are and some of it
fills us with a sense of what it would be to live a
beautiful life.
