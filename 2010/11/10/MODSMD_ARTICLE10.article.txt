# LOOKING UP
## Escape Ticket For One â€“ It's Easy 
### Nina M. Chung 
Sometimes, what I crave more than any
thing else in the world is to be in it by
myself. I have serious moments where
suddenly, the only company I want is my
own, and my definition of freedom becomes
one of not being found. I think I've learned
how to be alone.
Actually, I've always been like this, just not
so securely. Back in high school, my need for
societal separation seemed completely
freakish. "I don't really feel like hanging out
tonight for some reason," I'd respond to a
friend inviting me over to hang out with a ton
of people I may or may not have wanted to
socialize with. But mine would be a hesitant
ly drawn-out statement because, of course,
most of my friends wouldn't see any logic
there. Apparently, being surrounded by peo
ple was just the natural, taken-for-granted,
preferred option when compared to being on
your own.
Why, though? Maybe it's a fundamental
attitude or priority difference. For me, spend
ing meaningless time with people didn't au
tomatically outweigh doing something alone.
I loved my friends and walking in crowds and
huge gatherings and stomach-killing bounce
off-each-other laughter, and I definitely still
do. I also love, though, being completely on
my own, in sole charge of my time and state
of mind. And, when I really think about it, my
life's most surreal moments of total content -
edness usually happened when I was by my
self. (For example, I was once driving home in
my then-new car, blasting and singing to my
music like crazy ... when I was struck by the
lightning thought of how lucky I was to be
driving independently in this unbelievably

happy 16-year-old life. I started tearing/cry
ing, and it was a seriously dangerous emo
tional hit-and-run. And it confirmed my self
aware emotionality. And then I wrote about
it in the Stanford application.)
This realization has only solidified in a
place where being alone is necessarily self
enforced: College is inescapable society. It's
interesting, isn't it how in college, solitari
ness is an unnatural state we have to pur
posefully create, generally in the name of
studying? But when else is it "ok" to be will
ingly alone? Why does it seem so socially un
acceptable? It brings to mind the classic ice
breaker: Are you an extrovert or an intro
vert? For sure, most of us have learned the
positive extrovert definition and the nega
tive introvert one. Extrovert: happy, popular,
chatty, social butterfly. Introvert: antisocial,
reflective, diary-writing, analytical, the color
blue, moody. I'd say that's the general set of
connotations for the two personality types,
and I'm amused by how ridiculous they are. I
was a victim of that extrovert-hype, so I used
to openly consider myself one. Now, I'm on
the fence, but I'm so much more conscious of
my introverted side. I know without a doubt
that most of my recharge sessions come from
... me. I have my family and some fabulous
best friends that I occasionally turn to for a
kind of perspective rejuvenation. In general,
though, I rely on knowing how to be on my
own, and I'm grateful for that. Otherwise, I'd
be living a life where I constantly avoided
myself, and I can't think of many more sad
identity crises than that.
A lot of my friends and people I know are
dealing with something else at Stanford, too.

And it's interesting because even though
they are my good friends, they still feel it
loneliness. They feel lonely while living in
huge dormitories, eating at people-filled
huge round tables, sleeping in six-person
suites, going to packed lecture classes and
biking in the traffic of hundreds of others.
Clearly, then, loneliness has nothing to do
with how many people are next to us. It's not
solved by how many people we talk to or how
many people we hook up with or how many
people we see every day. Otherwise, loneli
ness would be solved. I suspect it has some
thing to do with definitions again.
College sets us up to be alone. We're, you
know, mostly on our own here. No large pop
ulation number changes the fact that most of
us gained some degree of independence en
tering Stanford "alone." And I think the
loneliness starts when we assume that that
word means the same as "lonely." But how
many other physical states exist that are
equated instantly with an emotional one?
Isn't it a bit restrictive? I just can't imagine
living a life where my own presence makes
me feel like I know no one. Ultimately, get
ting to appreciate my own company helped
me get over the loneliness thing. Now isn't
life just the most ironic thing?
