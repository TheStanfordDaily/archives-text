## No. It's Bad News for Africa 
### ANGELO IZAMA Knight journalism Fellow 
That the contest for content about Africa
is controversial is nothing new. But in the
world of popular media aided by conflict
activists, such content usually offers up little
more than incomplete portrayals about the re
alities of life on a vast continent of close to a bil
lion people.
Sadly, such complexities seem to elude John
Prendergast of the Enough Project, who (iron
ically with George Clooney in tow) used Holly
wood movies as a mechanism to anchor his
rather lightweight discussion about the "good
news" in Africa.
Looking at the posters announcing Pren
dergast's program, one might imagine that he
was offering a self-critique of his own celebrity
within the activist world. In one poster, Pren
dergast is pictured as a paternal Jesus figure
next to two anonymous African kids. (Suffer
the little children to come unto me, indeed.)
Hubris or not, romantic images such as these
raise real questions as to how far "outsiders"
can go to extend help to the needy especial
ly in situations of dire political conflict.
Unfortunately, despite its "charm," most
conflict activism in the West has painfully little
to show byway of successes. As a long-standing
journalist who has made a career covering con
flict in the Great Lakes Region of Central
Africa, my sense is that such activism fails in
part because those who direct it know very lit
tle about the politics, players and appropriate
policy mechanisms that, if undertaken, could
create real political space within this region of
the world.
Having observed student life at Stanford
this fall, my sense is also that such activism can
lull well-meaning advocates into a false sense
of "doing something purposeful" whether
they are, in fact, or not. The result is a danger
ous "placebo effect" that allows activists the
luxury of not taking full responsibility for the
myriad political consequences of their actions.
Last Thursday, when Prendergast known
as JP to his friends gave the S.T. Lee Lecture
on the "Good News from Africa," he expressed
a strong conviction that activists should not be
held responsible for the successes or failures of
policies for which they advocate. It was a
shocking pronouncement from a man who has

spent his professional life engaged in efforts to
make the world a better place. It's almost like
saying, "We wrote the play, the actors suck
and the audience is bored to tears, but heck,
who cares! Our hearts are in the right place,"
And sadly for the continent of my birth, all
evidence seems to suggest that it's the place
to go to study the spectacular failures of a
great many policies a tragic comedy.
Activists like Prendergast should be held
more accountable for the consequences of
their policies, but the fact that they aren't
speaks volumes about the bereft state of po
litical discourse on Africa that currently ex
ists within the United States. Given Prender
gast's access to the levers of power in this
country something that allows him to hold
policymaking hostage his brand of conflict
activism, as the Glenn Beck of interventions,
overtakes other more informed views, and ul
timately marginalizes those who could serve
as important allies. Worse, such activism gives
a false impression that serious things are
being done about serious problems.
More than anything, it seems as if the idea of
"Africa as crisis" attracts conflict activism, but
without the benefit of the serious political
scholarship that one finds about places like the
Middle East, for example (I have seen 21-year
olds shipped to Uganda to write policy recom
mendations for groups like the Enough Project
policy recommendations that were then de
livered to important lawmakers in D.C.)
Byway of example, one can look to the lat
est tactic deployed by Prendergast and his
minions at the Enough Project an effort to
target two important U.S. constituencies: con
gressmen and consumers. By picketing law
makers in Washington and launching product
campaigns to purchase "rape free" laptops,
groups like the Enough Project give us a
prime example of how misguided and ill-in
formed these groups can be. The intended
aim of Enough's campaign is to cut off the fi
nancial economies that some militias in east
ern Congo use to continue their campaigns of
pillage, rape and plunder. But given the fact
that many of these rebel and militia groups
only obtain a fraction of their revenue from
minerals, if the mineral trade were to some
how stop, these groups would readily find
other sources to finance their activities (from
the taxation of local land and domestic agri
cultural produce to the illicit weapons trade).
"Conflict mineral" campaigns like
Enough's tend to overstate their impact and

oversimplify the complex political and security
alliances that structure conflict in places like
eastern Congo. If Africa has friends like these,
does she need enemies? Enough said!
