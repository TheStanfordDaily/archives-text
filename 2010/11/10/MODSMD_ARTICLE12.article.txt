# Liberty and Justice For All... Unless You're Oscar Grant
## 
### IMANI FRANKLIN '13, BELINDA TANG '14 MATT MILLER '12 The Stanford NAACP Political Action Committee 
In the early morning hours of Jan. 1, 2009,
Oscar Grant was shot in the back by a po
lice officer while allegedly resisting arrest
on the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART).
Grant, a black Bay Area resident, was subse
quently hospitalized, where he died the next
morning. Videos of the incident show that
Grant was already being physically restrained
when he was fatally shot. Johannes Mehserle,
the offending officer, was charged with mur
der but pleaded not guilty, arguing that he
mistook his gun for a taser. He was eventually
found not guilty of second-degree murder and
instead, was found guilty of involuntary
manslaughter. On Nov. 5,2010, Mehserle was
sentenced to two years in prison and may be
released from custody after seven months.
The Stanford University College Chapter of
the National Association for the Advancement
of Colored People (NAACP) finds this ruling
grossly inadequate and stands in agreement
with the U.S. Justice Department, which has
currently begun a civil rights case against
Mehserle. Following the killing, the trial has
sparked massive rage and protests in Oakland
and in surrounding communities. Since the No
vember ruling, there have been nearly 150 peo
ple arrested for riots and protests related to the
Grant killing. Especially in Oakland, an area al
ready rife with racial tensions between police
men and residents, community members
viewed this incident of police brutality with
outrage and disgust, and the verdict of the case
even more so.
One thing is pretty clear: this was a case of
unwarranted police brutality. Much of the
video evidence suggests there was no need to
shoot or even tase Grant, as another officer
was already restraining him when he was shot.
Experts have also testified that it is very diffi

cult to confuse a taser with a gun, as guns are
much heavier. Moreover, tasers are designed
in a very different way than guns for the ex
plicit purpose of avoiding confusion. In light
of this evidence, the sentence given to
Mehserle was unjust given the severity of the
crime he committed. What message are we
sending when many animal cruelty laws dole
out harsher sentencing than the one Mehserle
received?
From Rodney King in 1991 to Oscar Grant
in 2010, our generation has seen repeated cases
of unjust police brutality. But let's not forget
some obvious facts. King and Grant were
black; the policemen were white. King and
Grant held low societal standings; the police
men had complete authority.
However, Grant was not so fortunate to es
cape with his life, and we find it unjust that one
man in a position of authority can essentially
get away with killing another by labeling it an
accident (despite evidence to the contrary).To
our dismay but not to our surprise, this type of
institutionalized racial injustice and state-sanc
tioned human rights violation is being propa
gated in the courts.
According to the Oakland Tribune, Mesher
le's defense attorney Michael Rains said, "He
will appeal the jury's involuntary manslaughter
verdict with a hope to both clear Mehserle's
record of a crime and to prevent other police
officers from enduring a criminal trial for mak
ing a mistake on the job." If the troubling posi
tion of Rains becomes the judicial norm and a
fatal error by police has no legal ramifications,
we in the Stanford NAACP are not only con
cerned for the safety of minorities nationwide
but for any person in America whose human
rights will be at stake.
It is unsettling enough that policemen, the
"upholders of safety in society," kill people.
But, as we sleep in our warm Stanford beds
tonight, perhaps we should be even more sick
ened by the fact that policemen can then walk
free after a couple years with a possible legal
"thumbs up." As we bike past serene palm
trees, perhaps we should feel a little queasy
that, if you are a white police officer, there is
currently little legal consequence for shooting
a handcuffed black man in the back. If that is
the world and the country we live in, perhaps
liberty and justice is not for all.
