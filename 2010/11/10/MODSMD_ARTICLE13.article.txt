## FANS RALLY FOR BCS BID 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY MANAGING EDITOR 
It has become a common meme in the
days after Stanford's dominating win
over previously one-loss Arizona: the
Cardinal could finish 11-1, have a top-five
ranking and still be left out of one of the
five BCS bowl games. Due to new Rose Bowl
rules, the No. 2 team in the Pac-10 in this
case, Stanford does not automatically fill in
for the No. 1 team in the conference in this
case, Oregon if the top squad goes to the na
tional championship game. Rather, a qualify
ing team (criteria: must have a top-14 ranking)
from a non-BCS conference (for example,
Boise State orTCU) will get the spot, as long as
a non-BCS school is not playing for the title. If
one does play for the title, the Rose Bowl can
make its own choice, but there is still no guar
antee for the second place Pac-10 team.
Confused? Understandable. The essence
is this: if the season plays out as it's described
above, and Stanford finishes 11-1 and second
in the Pac-10, it will have to fight for one of the
at-large BCS spots.
Normally, a team from a major conference
with that resume would be a shoo-in for a
BCS bowl game. But, as no shortage of media
outlets has pointed out, Stanford is a special
case. Michelle Smith of AOL Fan House ex
plains: "Frankly, despite the star power of An
drew Luck, the Cardinal will lack appeal for
the simple reason that they aren't going to
travel very well. They couldn't get more than
43,000 tickets sold for one of the biggest
games in this program's recent history."
Smith's reference is to Saturday's game
against then-No. 15 Arizona, where empty
seats were apparent throughout Stanford Sta
dium. With a potential controversy budding
with the caveat, of course, that the Cardi
nal wins out fans have taken to social
media to promote Stanford football as a
whole, as well as to rally support for a BCS
bid.
This is not the first time the Cardinal faith
ful have taken to campaigning. Last season,
fans, largely through Facebook, Twitter and
The Bootleg (a Stanford fan site), organized a
letter writing campaign to Heisman Trophy
voters in support of Toby Gerhart. Now, fans
want to try a similar tactic this year to pro
mote Stanford's BCS bowl bid.
"It's almost like writing your Congress
man we ought to be writing bowl officials
and local sportswriters," said Brian Bird 'O3.
Bird, along with friends Wade Gupta 'O3,
Michael Hawks 'O3 and Ryan Martino, own
Toby The Van, a large conversion van that,
since its introduction at the first game of the
2010 season, has become a staple of Stanford
tailgates. The vehicle, which, with a built-in tap
system, DirecTV and a DJ-style stereo sys
tem, almost has a persona of its own, has been
used to promote Cardinal football across the

West Coast and over social media
Foursquare, Twitter, Facebook and a website.
Now, Bird said, the group is trying to utilize
Toby The Van to rally support around Stan
ford's BCS bowl chances.
"We're committed to do everything we
possibly can," Bird said.
He is not operating in a vacuum.
Avishai Weiss 'OB M.S. 'O9 started a Face
book event on Sunday afternoon called
"Stanford fans will go to a BCS Bowl." His
goal was for Cardinal supporters to show that
they would travel to a postseason game. With
in six hours, the event had 1,000 attendees. By
Monday at around 9 p.m., 3,000 people had
confirmed attendance, with the number still
climbing up toward 4,000 at the time of publi
cation. While he isn't aiming for a specific
number of people to participate, he does
think that if the number of attendees reaches
into five figures that it would "send a mes
sage."
"It's what Facebook is ideal for," Weiss
said. "I was thinking of doing a website with a
catchy name, but I only have so many people
in my Stanford network. Facebook has so
many people with Stanford affiliations."
Weiss pointed to posts from a wide array
of people including Dean of Freshmen
and Undergraduate Advising Julie Lythcott-
Haims 'B9 telling their own stories of fan
dom as evidence that Stanford's support base
is widespread.
It's a sentiment that lines up with the
thoughts of Ben Laufer 'l2, the football
team's student manager.
"We sold out our allotment last year at the
Sun Bowl, and I am confident that Stanford
fans from far and wide will rally for the bowl
game this season," he wrote in an e-mail to
The Daily.
Indeed, last year's Sun Bowl, where the
Cardinal took on the Oklahoma Sooners, sold
out before game day for the first time in its 76-
year history.
"Even though Norman, Okla., is signifi
cantly closer to El Paso [the site of the Sun
Bowl] than Palo Alto is, just about half the
fans were Cardinal supporters," Laufer wrote.
"Stanford has alumni world-wide, many of
whom cannot travel to Palo Alto for every
home game, but can and do make the
effort to attend the bowl game."
Laufer guaranteed that Stanford would
"fill seats and hotels" this season, too, and
Bird was equally enthusiastic.
"We'll be there, no matter what the bowl
game is," he said. "If we have to take a week
off work to drive to Miami [for the Orange
Bowl], we're going to do it."
