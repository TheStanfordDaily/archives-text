# PAC-10 POWER RANKINGS
## 
### 
Every week, Jacob Jaffe will give his Pac-10 football power rankings. These represent a
measure of current success, not a prediction of future standings or a measure of talent.

1. Oregon (9-0, 6-0 Pac-10) UP NEXT: at California

Every week, Oregon seems to find a new way to scare the rest of the country. Last
weekend, it was the insane speed the Ducks used to turn a terrible start into another
blowout. Granted, Oregon was at home against the Jake Locker-less Washington

Huskies, but any team that can score 50+ points on an off night is something to be feared.
Now if Oregon finishes out the regular season without any slip-ups, it will be in the title game.
Losing backup quarterback Nate Costa for the year could hurt the Ducks if anything happens
to Darron Thomas, but the same can be said of almost any contending team losing its starting
quarterback.

2. Stanford (8-1,5-1 Pac-10) UP NEXT: at Arizona State

Stanford's blowout win over Arizona solidified the Cardinal's spot at No. 2 in the con
ference, but even more importantly, it showed the rest of the country (which could not
ignore a primetime top-15 game on ABC) that Stanford is one of the best teams in the
nation. The polls and computers agreed, vaulting the Cardinal up to No. 6 in the BCS

standings. Stanford will be favored in its three remaining contests, but none of them is a
pushover by any means. A BCS bowl is becoming more plausible, but Stanford needs to take
care of its own games first before it worries about bowls.

3. USC (6-3, 3-3 Pac-10) UP NEXT: at Arizona

This was not a good week for the middle of the Pac-10, and nowhere is this more
clear than the placement of the Trojans at No. 3 in the conference. USC was lucky
to beat a mediocre Arizona State team at home, relying on former Lou Groza
Award-winner Thomas Weber to miss a field goal in order to preserve the victory.

The Trojans did win, though, and now have the opportunity to play spoiler against Arizona and
Oregon State the next two weeks. Each win USC gets is one win the rest of the Pac-1 0 can't
have, so the Trojans' success lessens the number of bowl-eligible teams in the conference.

4. Arizona (7-2,4-2 Pac-10) UP NEXT: vs. USC

All the talk of a first-ever Rose Bowl trip went down the drain when the Wildcats got
embarrassed at Stanford. The offense looked out of sync with Nick Foles coming
back from injury, and the defense was exposed in a big way against the best offense

it has faced this season. Arizona is still a very good team, but not an elite team, and there is a
lot for the Wildcats to play for if they can get back to their winning ways. The rest of the sched
ule is not a cakewalk, though, as USC, Oregon and Arizona State lie ahead.

5. California (5-4,3-3 Pac-10) UP NEXT: vs. Oregon

It wasn't pretty, and it wasn't impressive in the slightest, but at least the Golden Bears
have won a road game by beating Washington State in Pullman. New starting quar
terback Brock Mansion was less than stellar, throwing two interceptions and no

touchdowns, while only completing half his passes. Luckily, this was enough against the
Cougars, who seems to be regressing back toward terrible mode after a few competitive weeks.
Cal is now just one win from bowl eligibility, but the next two contests against Oregon and
Stanford will not make that easy. On the bright side, though, Cal does not have to leave
Berkeley for the rest of the season.

6. UCLA (4-5, 2-4 Pac-10) UP NEXT: Bye

Instant replay was the Bruins' friend last weekend, and all of a sudden, a bowl game
■ is looking reasonable. Kicker Kai Forbath proved once again that he has a legitimate
claim as UCLA's best player, bouncing back from a missed field goal to nail a 51-

yarder as time expired to knock off Oregon State. Now the Bruins get a shortened bye, as they will
face Washington next week on a Thursday night. In this year's Pac-10, games against Washington,
Arizona State and USC are all very winnable, and UCLA needs just two to go bowling.

7. Oregon State (4-4,3-2 Pac-10) UP NEXT: vs. Washington State

Just like Arizona, the Beavers proved that they won't be a factor in the Pac-10
race. Early season losses to still-undefeated juggernauts TCU and Boise State are
forgivable, but last-second losses to Washington and UCLA are less so. Now
Oregon State needs to regroup quickly just to make a bowl game. Luckily for the

Beavers, Washington State is coming to town this week, so a bounce-back win appears likely.
Less lucky is the following three-game stretch of USC, Stanford and Oregon, of which the
Beavers will need at least one win to reach the postseason.

8. Arizona State (4-5, 2-4 Pac-10) UP NEXT: vs. Stanford

A field goal. That's all that separated the Sun Devils from the top half of the Pac-10
and a decent chance at a bowl game. Unfortunately for Arizona State, that field
goal was missed by Thomas Weber, who was once the best kicker in the country.
Weber also had an extra point blocked and returned for two points in Saturday's

game against USC, helping the Trojans eke out a one-point win. Now the Sun Devils are on
the brink, needing to win out to ensure bowl eligibility. While they are mulling one of the worst
lows of their season, their opponent this weekend, No. 6 Stanford, is riding its biggest high of
the year after crushing Arizona.

9. Washington (3-6, 2-4 Pac-10) UP NEXT: Bye

Well, at least the beginning wasn't too bad. Without its starting quarterback against
the best team in the country, the Huskies held tough for a quarter and a half, holding
the Ducks to only three points in the first 24 minutes. Unfortunately for Washington,

that's when Oregon woke up and decided to put the game away. The Ducks dropped 50 more
points on UW in the remaining 36 minutes, and the Huskies were left in the dust. Now
Washington can regroup before its last three games against UCLA, Cal and Washington State.
To reach a bowl game, the Huskies must win all three, which is certainly plausible.

10. Washington State (1-9,0-7 Pac-10) UP NEXT: at Oregon State

While the Cougars played another Pac-10 foe close, it's past the time when this
can be considered a moral victory. Washington State fell at home to the road
averse Cal Golden Bears, and they did not even go down fighting. Promising
quarterback Jeff Tuel was stifled by the Cal defense, completing only 36 percent

of his passes for under 100 yards. The Cougars as a team could not even manage 200 yards
of total offense, and now a Pac-1 0 win in 2010 looks to be a pipe dream. Now Wazzu can
only hope to spoil the bowl hopes of either Oregon State or Washington in its final two games.

Beavers, Washington State is coming to town this week, so a bounce-back win appears likely.
Less lucky is the following three-game stretch of USC, Stanford and Oregon, of which the
Beavers will need at least one win to reach the postseason.

8. Arizona State (4-5, 2-4 Pac-10) UP NEXT: vs. Stanford

A field goal. That's all that separated the Sun Devils from the top half of the Pac-10
and a decent chance at a bowl game. Unfortunately for Arizona State, that field
goal was missed by Thomas Weber, who was once the best kicker in the country.
Weber also had an extra point blocked and returned for two points in Saturday's

game against USC, helping the Trojans eke out a one-point win. Now the Sun Devils are on
the brink, needing to win out to ensure bowl eligibility. While they are mulling one of the worst
lows of their season, their opponent this weekend, No. 6 Stanford, is riding its biggest high of
the year after crushing Arizona.

9. Washington (3-6, 2-4 Pac-10) UP NEXT: Bye

Well, at least the beginning wasn't too bad. Without its starting quarterback against
the best team in the country, the Huskies held tough for a quarter and a half, holding
the Ducks to only three points in the first 24 minutes. Unfortunately for Washington,

that's when Oregon woke up and decided to put the game away. The Ducks dropped 50 more
points on UW in the remaining 36 minutes, and the Huskies were left in the dust. Now
Washington can regroup before its last three games against UCLA, Cal and Washington State.
To reach a bowl game, the Huskies must win all three, which is certainly plausible.

10. Washington State (1-9,0-7 Pac-10) UP NEXT: at Oregon State

While the Cougars played another Pac-10 foe close, it's past the time when this
can be considered a moral victory. Washington State fell at home to the road
averse Cal Golden Bears, and they did not even go down fighting. Promising
quarterback Jeff Tuel was stifled by the Cal defense, completing only 36 percent

of his passes for under 100 yards. The Cougars as a team could not even manage 200 yards
of total offense, and now a Pac-1 0 win in 2010 looks to be a pipe dream. Now Wazzu can
only hope to spoil the bowl hopes of either Oregon State or Washington in its final two games.










Every week, Jacob Jaffe will give his Pac-10 football power rankings. These represent a
measure of current success, not a prediction of future standings or a measure of talent.

1. Oregon (9-0, 6-0 Pac-10) UP NEXT: at California

Every week, Oregon seems to find a new way to scare the rest of the country. Last
weekend, it was the insane speed the Ducks used to turn a terrible start into another
blowout. Granted, Oregon was at home against the Jake Locker-less Washington

Huskies, but any team that can score 50+ points on an off night is something to be feared.
Now if Oregon finishes out the regular season without any slip-ups, it will be in the title game.
Losing backup quarterback Nate Costa for the year could hurt the Ducks if anything happens
to Darron Thomas, but the same can be said of almost any contending team losing its starting
quarterback.

2. Stanford (8-1,5-1 Pac-10) UP NEXT: at Arizona State

Stanford's blowout win over Arizona solidified the Cardinal's spot at No. 2 in the con
ference, but even more importantly, it showed the rest of the country (which could not
ignore a primetime top-15 game on ABC) that Stanford is one of the best teams in the
nation. The polls and computers agreed, vaulting the Cardinal up to No. 6 in the BCS

standings. Stanford will be favored in its three remaining contests, but none of them is a
pushover by any means. A BCS bowl is becoming more plausible, but Stanford needs to take
care of its own games first before it worries about bowls.

3. USC (6-3, 3-3 Pac-10) UP NEXT: at Arizona

This was not a good week for the middle of the Pac-10, and nowhere is this more
clear than the placement of the Trojans at No. 3 in the conference. USC was lucky
to beat a mediocre Arizona State team at home, relying on former Lou Groza
Award-winner Thomas Weber to miss a field goal in order to preserve the victory.

The Trojans did win, though, and now have the opportunity to play spoiler against Arizona and
Oregon State the next two weeks. Each win USC gets is one win the rest of the Pac-1 0 can't
have, so the Trojans' success lessens the number of bowl-eligible teams in the conference.

4. Arizona (7-2,4-2 Pac-10) UP NEXT: vs. USC

All the talk of a first-ever Rose Bowl trip went down the drain when the Wildcats got
embarrassed at Stanford. The offense looked out of sync with Nick Foles coming
back from injury, and the defense was exposed in a big way against the best offense

it has faced this season. Arizona is still a very good team, but not an elite team, and there is a
lot for the Wildcats to play for if they can get back to their winning ways. The rest of the sched
ule is not a cakewalk, though, as USC, Oregon and Arizona State lie ahead.

5. California (5-4,3-3 Pac-10) UP NEXT: vs. Oregon

It wasn't pretty, and it wasn't impressive in the slightest, but at least the Golden Bears
have won a road game by beating Washington State in Pullman. New starting quar
terback Brock Mansion was less than stellar, throwing two interceptions and no

touchdowns, while only completing half his passes. Luckily, this was enough against the
Cougars, who seems to be regressing back toward terrible mode after a few competitive weeks.
Cal is now just one win from bowl eligibility, but the next two contests against Oregon and
Stanford will not make that easy. On the bright side, though, Cal does not have to leave
Berkeley for the rest of the season.

6. UCLA (4-5, 2-4 Pac-10) UP NEXT: Bye

Instant replay was the Bruins' friend last weekend, and all of a sudden, a bowl game
■ is looking reasonable. Kicker Kai Forbath proved once again that he has a legitimate
claim as UCLA's best player, bouncing back from a missed field goal to nail a 51-

yarder as time expired to knock off Oregon State. Now the Bruins get a shortened bye, as they will
face Washington next week on a Thursday night. In this year's Pac-10, games against Washington,
Arizona State and USC are all very winnable, and UCLA needs just two to go bowling.

7. Oregon State (4-4,3-2 Pac-10) UP NEXT: vs. Washington State

Just like Arizona, the Beavers proved that they won't be a factor in the Pac-10
race. Early season losses to still-undefeated juggernauts TCU and Boise State are
forgivable, but last-second losses to Washington and UCLA are less so. Now
Oregon State needs to regroup quickly just to make a bowl game. Luckily for the

Beavers, Washington State is coming to town this week, so a bounce-back win appears likely.
Less lucky is the following three-game stretch of USC, Stanford and Oregon, of which the
Beavers will need at least one win to reach the postseason.

8. Arizona State (4-5, 2-4 Pac-10) UP NEXT: vs. Stanford

A field goal. That's all that separated the Sun Devils from the top half of the Pac-10

10. Washington State (1-9,0-7 Pac-10) UP NEXT: at Oregon State

While the Cougars played another Pac-10 foe close, it's past the time when this
can be considered a moral victory. Washington State fell at home to the road
averse Cal Golden Bears, and they did not even go down fighting. Promising
