# Cam Newton: innocent until proven guilty
## 
### Kabir Sawhney Follow the Money 
As I'm sure many of you reading
this have heard by now, Auburn
quarterback Cameron Newton
has been mired in a swirl of con
troversy over the past couple of
weeka Newton, considered by many to be the
frontrunner for the HeismanTrophy while lead
ing the Tigers to an undefeated record, was first
alleged to have sought payments of up to
$200,000 during his recruitment from junior col
lege.
Then, on Monday night, reports surfaced
that Newton was allegedly facing censure and
possible expulsion from the University of Flori
da due to academic violations before he trans
ferred at the end of his sophomore year.Newton
spent the first two seasons of his collegiate ca
reer with the Gators, but (according to a Sports
Illustrated interview) transferred because of his
low position on the Florida depth chart and
charges of laptop theft.
Yet, the key word in what I just wrote was not
"payments" or "expulsion" or "academic viola
tions"; rather, it was "alleged." To this point,
nothing has been proven, and neither the
NCAA nor the Southeastern Conference has
taken any disciplinary action to revoke New
ton's remaining eligibility or otherwise prevent
him from playing.
Auburn head coach Gene Chizik has shown
no indication that he plans to sit Newton, which
is a strong vote of confidence given the disas
trous consequences that just one rogue athlete
can unleash upon an entire program (see Bush,
Reggie). Of course, the fact that Auburn is in the
thick of a national title hunt has something to do
with it, too, but Chizik must weigh the dual prob
abilities of a championship and of facing pro
gram-crippling sanctions
So Newton might be guilty of taking money
or cheating on papers or both. Or he might not
be. The plain fact is that we don't yet know and
must wait for the results of NCAA investiga
tions to truly find out.
In light of all this I find the media's collective
rush to judgment to be extremely troubling. A
number of columnists have bashed Newton, au
tomatically assuming that he must be guilty of
everything he has been accused of
It might be partly because the recent scan
dals across college football have conditioned us
to assume that guilt,but what happened to inno
cent until proven guilty? Until someone can
show me conclusive proof that Newton took
money or cheated academically, until these alle
gations are confirmed, I refuse to condemn
Newton and urge my colleagues in the media to
do the same.
Let's start with the recruiting violations. Ac
cording to ESPN.com, which broke the story, an
agent who said he represented Newton called a
former Mississippi State quarterback to say it
would "take some cash to get Cam" (the Bull
dogs were trying to recruit Newton at the time).
For starters, I want proof that this agent repre
sented Newton; I could call the Raiders right
now and tell them that I represented Tom Brady
and that they should give me $1 million to get
him to suit up in the silver and black. Second, I
want to see cash changing hands, or at least
someone saying on record that it did, and details
about the transaction. I can't condemn Newton
based on allegations and the statement, "Well, a
third of SEC players are on the take, so he must
be, too."
As for the allegations of academic fraud, the
Fox Sports report that broke the story was in
credibly flimsy. Here's the first sentence for you:
"Auburn quarterback Cameron Newton
had three different instances of academic cheat
ing while attending the University of Florida
and faced potential expulsion from the Univer
sity, according to a source."
So this entire story, this whole whirlwind of
condemnation on the assumption that,yes, Cam
Newton cheated at Florida, is based wholly off
one anonymous source ? You have to be kidding
me.
While I could write an entire column on the
overuse of anonymous sources in sports jour
nalism, suffice it to say that I don't believe allega
tions stemming from a single unidentified
source have enough basis to be credible. The
words "according to the source" are used six
times throughout the Fox Sports report, with no
indication of where this source is from or why he
or she asked not to be identified.
Even as a student journalist, if I give a source
anonymity, I will list that source's position or job
and the compelling reason(s) as to why they are
not identified. I guess the Fox Sports reporters
who broke the story are just crossing their fin
gers and hoping that no one comes along and ac
tually, you know, asks them to verify any of the
so-called "truth" they are peddling.
More broadly, the sports media has rushed to
judgment in the past and gotten memorably
burned; just ask the slew of columnists who
blasted the Duke lacrosse team, shoving aside
concerns about silly things like "what actually
happened," "the reliability of the accuser" and
"police misconduct." The allegations of rape
turned out to be false, and CBS's "60 Minutes"
conducted an extremely thorough, six-month
review of the case, basically showing sports jour-

nalists how real journalism is done.
So, as the Newton allegations are
endlessly replayed on Sports Center and
dissected by ESPN's talking heads,
please keep in mind that they are still just
allegations. While the principle of inno
cent until proven guilty has taken a beat
ing of late, it still has some life left in it; I
can only hope that my fellow sportswrit
ers don't continue to take a sledgeham
mer to it based on a collective rapid judg
ment mentality.
