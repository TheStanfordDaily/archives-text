## Research shows role-reversal helps students Reteaching lessons help students learn better 
### CASSANDRA FELICIANO DESK EDITOR 
According to Stanford re
searchers, one way to improve the
quality of education is to turn things
upside down. The Teachable Agents
project, currently in progress at Stan
ford's AAA Lab, suggests that stu
dents learn best when they're teach
ing someone else, even if the other
person doesn't really exist.
The study, a collaborative effort
with Vanderbilt University's Teach
ing Agents Group, has its roots in an
idea developed by AAA Lab direc
tor Daniel Schwartz and his col
leagues at Vanderbilt University,
Gautam Biswas and John Bransford.
They wanted to create a software
that used the "protege effect" the
phenomenon that individuals learn
better when they're teaching others
versus studying on their own in
second life.
The latest version features virtual
agents that students can customize
much like an avatar and interactive
activities where users can quiz their
"students," such as Betty's Brain
a program that uses a correctable
concept map to represent Betty's
thoughts and answers.
While the cognitive benefits of
this method of learning have long
been accepted, Schwartz said he and
his team also discovered that the
software had emotional advantages.
"It doesn't hurt them [the stu
dents] very much if they get some
thing wrong," he said. "They feel kind
of sorry for it, and they feel like they
let it down, so they try harder."
Although parents of the elemen

tary school students who participat
ed in the AAA studies expressed
concerns that the games would dis
tract students from homework,
Schwartz said the software should
not induce any form of addictive be
havior.
"It's not the sort of thing where
you spend thousands of hours on it,"
he said. "It's the thing where after six
to eight hours, it's done its job. It
doesn't replace things. It makes them
better ... it's not a video game."
The popularity of the software
among school officials is already tak
ing flight. Researchers have worked
with schools in four Peninsula
schools Milpitas, Menlo Park, Los
Altos and Sunnyvale and
Schwartz said he is starting to get re
quests from school districts in San
Diego.
But the researchers are a bit hesi
tant to accept the offers right away,
because introducing the program to
San Diego would require a larger
scale implementation. Right now,
Schwartz said, the research team does
not have the manpower to help get
the project started in an entire school
district. In fact, the work that they
have done with schools is limited to a
few classrooms or grades at a time.
"It will take some thought,"
Schwartz said.
For now, the researchers are
working on ways to assure that the
software can "exist without constant
footwork," that is, without the need
for researchers to be there every step
of the way to assure that nothing
goes wrong.
Teachable Agents is funded by a
grant from the National Science
Foundation and the Department of
Education.

Students teach lessons to virtual "students," such as the ones pictured in this
screen shot of the game. This game was tested at local schools in Milpitas, Los
Altos, Menlo Park and Sunnyvale and has been requested by other schools.
