## Professor emeritus van Andel dies in Cambridge 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€” Matt Bettonville 
Stanford professor emeritus Tjeerd
Hendrik van Andel died at age 87 on
Sept. 17. Van Andel began at Stanford
with a professorship in oceanography in
1976 and also served as professor of geo
physics and human biology until his re
tirement from Stanford in 1987.
According to an obituary in the
Stanford Report, van Andel, born in
Rotterdam, Netherlands, held a life
long interest in exploring the past. Be
fore coming to Stanford, he worked as
a sedimentologist in Amsterdam and a
marine geologist and geochemist at
Oregon State University. While at
Oregon State, he helped with interna
tional deep-sea explorations that used
the geology of the previously unex
plored ocean floor to develop theories
of plate tectonics and periods of cli
mate change in Earth's history, accord
ing to the Stanford Report.
His ocean investigation continued
during his Stanford professorship
when, in 1977, he was part of an expe
dition off the coast of Ecuador that
made the first observations of ocean
floor hydrothermal vents. In addition
to his work in geology, he also worked
in geo-archaeology at Stanford, lead
ing Stanford's 1978 Archaeological
and Environmental Survey to Greece,
according to an obituary from Cam
bridge University.
Outside his contributions to geolo
gy, van Andel was known for his care
ful, scientific mind and sense of humor.
"He really had an ability to dissect a
conversation and look at all sides of is
sues," said professor of geological and
environmental sciences Gordon Brown
in an interview with the Stanford Re
port.
Van Andel's wife, Kate Pretty, prin
cipal of Homerton College in Cam
bridge, England, said in van Andel's
eulogy that he displayed a "blunt,
tough and enormously energetic" atti
tude toward science, but "would laugh
until he cried at Monty Python." Out
side the classroom, van Andel was also
an artist, gourmet cook and writer.
This balance between light humor
and passion for his sciences attracted
many students to his courses at Stan
ford, according to the Report, often
prompting non-geology majors to ex
plore the subject in order to take van
Andel's classes.
Van Andel's retirement from Stan
ford brought him to the University of
Cambridge to continue his work in ge
ology. More of van Andel's major
achievements in his career include au
thoring "New Views on an Old Plan
et," a history of Earth's geology, win
ning the 1978 Francis P. Shepard Medal
in Marine Geology and earning fel
lowships with the American Geophys
ical Union in 1980 and the American
Association for the Advancement of
Science in 1981, according to the Re
port.
Van Andel's funeral took place in
Cambridge on Sept. 30.
