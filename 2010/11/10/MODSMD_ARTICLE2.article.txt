## Roche Supreme Court case to test Bayh-Dole Act 
### TYLER BROWN DESK EDITOR 
The fight between Stanford and biotechnology firm Roche
Holdings AG is heating up as the U.S. Supreme Court is set to
hear the patent dispute. The lawsuit could upset current inter
pretations of the Bayh-Dole Act of 1980, which defines the own
ership of patents that arise from research at federally funded in
stitutions.
The case questions whether an inventor employed by a con
tractor that decides to retain ownership of a patent can negate
that contractor's ownership under Bayh-Dole by assigning his
rights to the invention to another party. It started in 2002 when
the University sued Roche for royalties on HIV screening kits
sold by the company that used technology developed by School
