## Roche Supreme Court case to test Bayh-Dole Act 
### TYLER BROWN DESK EDITOR 
The fight between Stanford and biotechnology firm Roche
Holdings AG is heating up as the U.S. Supreme Court is set to
hear the patent dispute. The lawsuit could upset current inter
pretations of the Bayh-Dole Act of 1980, which defines the own
ership of patents that arise from research at federally funded in
stitutions.
The case questions whether an inventor employed by a con
tractor that decides to retain ownership of a patent can negate
that contractor's ownership under Bayh-Dole by assigning his
rights to the invention to another party. It started in 2002 when
the University sued Roche for royalties on HIV screening kits
sold by the company that used technology developed by School

of Medicine professor Mark Holodniy.
The Bayh-Dole Act allows federal
contractors to retain the title to inven
tions developed with federally funded
research, meaning potentially significant
income for universities. Universities are
required by the Act to grant royalty-free
licenses to the government, share rev
enue from patent licenses with the in
ventor and give preference to small busi
nesses to market subsequent products.
In 1989, as a research fellow in Stan
ford's Department of Infectious Dis
ease, Holodniy was simultaneously em
ployed as a visiting researcher at Cetus
Corporation, a Berkeley biotechnology
firm acquired by Roche in 1991. His
work exposed him to a DNA amplifica
tion technology called polymerase
chain reactions (PCR) that was invent
ed at Cetus in the early 1980s.
As a condition of his employment,
Holodniy signed a "Visitors Confiden
tiality Agreement" with Cetus in 1989,
requiring him to assign the rights to
Cetus to any intellectual property that
arose from technology he used at
Cetus.
The year before, as an employee of
the University, Holodniy was required
to sign a "Copyright and Patent Agree
ment" assigning the rights to his inven
tions to Stanford.
Stanford earned $65.1 million in
royalties from 517 licensing agreements
in fiscal year 2008-2009, according to
the Office of Technology Licensing
(OTL). Among those agreements, 39
brought in more than $lOO,OOO. But that
income is a relatively small percentage
of last year's $1.13 billion sponsored re
search budget.
Stanford's patent policy dictates that
the titles to all inventions developed at
the University, regardless of their fund
ing source, be assigned to the Universi
ty. Stanford deducts 15 percent of all
royalties to cover the OTL's administra
tive costs and the patent's filing fees,
after which income is divided evenly be
tween the inventor, the inventor's de
partment and the inventor's school.
The University has not made any
policy changes in response to the case,
said senior University counsel Patrick
Dunkley.

Taking Sides on Bayh-Dole
Provost John Etchemendy Ph.D. 'B2
defended the Bayh-Dole Act at the
Nov. 5 Faculty Senate meeting, adding
that the University itself is not worried
about income from royalties, but that
"it's really worrying about income to
the department and the faculty mem

ber, and [the University is] very, very
worried about the principle."
The Obama administration showed
support for Stanford with an October
amicus brief filed by acting solicitor gen
eral Neal Katyal. The brief argues that
the appeals court's decision "upend[s]
the Bayh-Dole Act's hierarchy of rights''
and urges the Supreme Court to "correct
the court of appeals' serious misunder
standing of the Bayh-Dole Act's frame
work" for patent ownership.
A host of universities and education
organizations, including the Massachu
setts Institute of Technology, the Amer
ican Association of Universities and the
Wisconsin Alumni Association, have
also filed briefs supporting Stanford.
Lawyers for Roche said in a brief
that a ruling in Stanford's favor would
harm collaboration between industry
and nonprofits like universities.
"The government, like Stanford, ap
pears to believe that discoveries con
ceived on the back of private invest
ment may be snatched away retroac
tively if a university ... decides to incor
porate them into federally-funded proj
ect," they wrote.

Adrian Pruetz, an attorney defend
ing Roche, would not comment on
pending litigation.
Law professor Mark Lemley, an ex
pert in intellectual property law, de
clined to comment on the case, adding
that he has "an employer on one side
[of the case] and a client on another."
The most recent ruling by the Feder
al Circuit Court held that the patents
were assigned to Holodniy before the
University, and therefore the Cetus
agreement gave Stanford and Roche
dual ownership rights.
"Ultimately, the Federal Circuit's
opinion turns on its head one of the
Bayh-Dole Act's principal objectives
establishing a uniform and clear
path for establishing title to inventions
arising from federally funded research
at universities," said Stanford in the pe
titioner's reply brief.
The University will file its first brief
in the case itself Dec. 16. Dunkley ex
pects the Court will hear the case in
March of next year.
