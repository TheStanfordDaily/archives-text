# Casa evacuates after pipeline leak
## No one injured after accidental pipeline damage 
### ELIZABETH TITUS EDITOR IN CHIEF 
A construction worker hit a gas line
while building a fence behind La Casa Ital
iana on Tuesday morning, prompting an
evacuation of students in the house and
neighboring house Xanadu. No one was in
jured, but the incident left officials and
workers disagreeing about how clearly the
gas line was marked and who was responsi
ble for marking it.
The accident happened just before 9:15
a.m., said foreman Tim Castrillo of Sierra
Lumber of San Jose. He was using a shovel
to dig a hole for a fence post in a gravelly
area behind Casa Italiana that will be used
for bike parking. About two feet down, Cas
trillo hit a one-inch plastic pipe that delivers
gas to the house. Castrillo called Palo Alto
Fire Department, which responded imme
diately, according to battalion chief Geo
Blackshire.
The first PG&E representatives arrived
to clamp off the line at about 9:40 a.m., fol
lowed by more PG&E representatives to
repair the pipe around 10:10, Blackshire
said.
Meanwhile, firefighters entered Casa
Italiana to conduct air tests and assess the
risk of an explosion. They found no danger
but smelled a light gas odor and evacuated
residents, some of them still sleeping, as a
precaution.
Firefighters "knocked on my door,
opened the door and said, 'Sorry to wake
you, but you have to evacuate, and you have
to close the windows,"' said first-floor resi
dent Claudia Preciado 'l2 one of the
house's 52 tenants, according to resident as
sistant Blake Miller 'll.

The house's emergency assembly point
was behind the house near the site of the gas
leak, so residents gathered across the street
at Sigma Nu, Miller said. (Later, some resi
dents went to the CoHo to sign the giant
card they had made for one of their own,
who was recently hospitalized with menin
gitis.) The gas was back on after lunch,
Miller said.
PG&E will conduct a routine investiga
tion, said spokesman Matt Nauman.The ac
cident prompted plans by Larry Gibbs, vice
provost of environmental health and safety,
to issue a reminder to top project managers
in Residential and Dining Enterprises and
in the University about the importance of
checking for utility lines before digging.
"It's a good reminder to reinforce with
all contractors," Gibbs said.

A Protocol Reminder
Officials and the worker dispute how
well the pipeline was marked and who was
responsible for those markings. Gibbs ex
plained how construction crews usually
avoid accidents like the one Tuesday at Casa
Italiana, which was built in 1976 and under
went a capital improvement project this
summer.
"Anytime anyone digs into the ground,
they are supposed to go through this process
called USA," which stands for "under
ground service alert," Gibbs said. The
process means identifying the locations of
buried utility lines by marking the ground
with spray paint and flags. Online USA re
sources can help find underground lines,
Gibbs said.
"It's common practice," he added. "Most
everyone does that."
And the responsibility of marking the lo

cations of utility lines ahead of work is "real
ly on the contractor who's doing that work,"
Gibbs said. "That's their responsibility."
Behind Casa Italiana, yellow spray paint
on the parking-lot asphalt next to the grav
elly area signals the gas pipeline, and Gibbs
said he recalls flag markers being in the
gravelly area before the work.
But Castrillo said it was unclear exactly
where the pipe ran as it approached the
house. That is why, to take extra precaution,
he used a shovel rather than power equip
ment to dig, said Bob, a retail supervisor at
Sierra Lumber who declined to give his last
name for what he called personal reasons.
The supervisor added that older
pipelines are more difficult to locate on
USA websites or with tracking equipment.
Contractors can call USA organizations,
who will ask PG&E to mark pipeline loca
tions a day or two before the project begins,

he said.
"There's a lot of old pipe out there at
Stanford, that's for sure," the supervisor
said. Nauman, the PG&E spokesman, did
not know how old the pipeline was.
As to whether Sierra Lumber called a
USA organization to find the utilities ahead
of building the fence, the supervisor called
the question "irrelevant," because the
pipeline was "previously marked prior to us
going out to dig these post holes." He said he
didn't know who marked the locations.
Gibbs said spray paint or flags marking
the more exact location of the pipeline in
the gravelly area behind Casa Italiana might
have been "obliterated" during earlier land
scaping work.
Meanwhile, Rodger Whitney, executive
director of Student Housing, contended the

markings were appropriate. "The gas
lines and other utilities in the area had
been appropriately marked, as is man
dated before digging occurs in a situa
tion such as this," Whitney said in an e
mail to The Daily. He did not respond to
The Daily's questions about who was
responsible for the markings.
Ultimately, Gibbs said, it's unusual
for hand-digging to cause damage like
this, "but the main thing is I think we
had a very good response, by everyone
from Palo Alto Fire to DPS [the De
partment of Public Safety] to PG&E."
Whitney also commended the re
sponse: "While the volume of utility
supply lines on our campus mean that
these things do happen from time to
time, the key is having the correct pro
tocols to respond, and ours worked
very smoothly today," he said.
The number-one reminder from
PG&E, Nauman said, is that "it's im
portant people check before they dig."
Gas leaks at Stanford happen infre
quently, Blackshire said. The Universi
ty Safety and Security Report lists no
gas-leak responses in its 2007-2009 fire
log. Matt Geenen, the Student Housing
building manager for the lower Row
and the fraternity cluster between
Lomita Drive and Campus Drive, said
he had never dealt with one in his six
years on the job.

The Contractor
Castrillo and the Sierra Lumber re
tail supervisor said their customer was
John Arrillaga '6O, billionaire and Uni
versity donor.
"All of our work related to the Uni
versity," including other fence and deck
projects on the Row and in Escondido
Village, "has been one way or another
connected to John," the supervisor. "He
makes a line where he wants the fence
line to go," said the supervisor.
"We're working for John Arrillaga,"
Castrillo said.
Arrillaga's close involvement in
campus landscaping projects has long
been rumored among students, but
University officials on Tuesday were
tight-lipped about the identity of the
contractor.
Geenen said Arrillaga was "a donor
who helped fund" the larger landscap
ing project around Casa Italiana, Bob
and Storey, including the Casa Italiana
fence. Geenen said he didn't know if
Arrillaga was the contractor.
Gibbs also said he didn't know who
the contractor was. Responding to
Daily questions via e-mail, Whitney did
not address the newspaper's questions
about who the contractor was or who
hired Sierra Lumber to build the fence,
Arrillaga did not return a message
Tuesday afternoon at the office of his
Palo Alto property management firm,
Peery/Arrillaga.
