### MARGARET RAWSON DESK EDITOR 
The ASSU Undergraduate Senate heard
presentations Tuesday from Parking &
Transportation Services (P&TS) on pro
posed Marguerite changes and the Study of

(SUES).The Senate approved a bill creating
the volunteer position of an economic policy
consultant to serve the needs of the Senate
Appropriations Committee.
Study of Undergraduate Education at Stanford
Sue McConnell, biology professor and co
chair of the Study of Undergraduate Educa
tion at Stanford, began her presentation by
describing the work of the task force thus far,
including dorm visits to gather student opin
ion and its wide parameters.
McConnell stressed that the task force,
currently in its second year, is able to exam
ine undergraduate education conceptually.
She urged the senators, "Think as though
anything is possible ... forget about the cur
rent requirements."
"For you guys, liberal education is not a

luxury at all it is a necessity," McConnell
continued, describing the basic questions the
task force is asking concerning whether liber
al education is a privilege.
Students today will have "to navigate a
terrain more complicated than the world of
my parents," McConnell said.
McConnell outlined the task force's over
lapping aims for undergraduate education:
student "acquisition and creation of knowl
edge," development of "intellectual and prac
tical skills," education toward "living a cre
ative, responsible and reflective life" and "in
tegration and synthesis of knowledge, skills
and abilities across disciplines."
Following the presentation, senators had
the opportunity to propose changes and ask
questions.
Robin Perani 'l3 spoke in favor of "more
prestige" around interdisciplinary studies.
"There's a stigma," Perani said.
"If you're talking to the d-school, then
you're on the right track," Perani added,
commenting on the Institute of Design at
Stanford's effort to teach hard skills with hu
mans in mind.

"How should we balance requirements

versus choice?" asked McConnell.
"Choice is always good," Kamil Saeid 'l3
later responded.
When asked about the Introductory to
Humanities program (IHUM) for freshmen,
McConnell declined to comment on specific
programs due to ongoing reviews.
"We don't want to throw out babies with
bath water if they're working really well,"
McConnell said. "We've heard a lot about

IHUM from [students] ... we've heard that
loud and clear."
Stewart Macgregor-Dennis 'l3 offered his
advice: "Look at the SLE [Structured Liber
al Education] model I think it works."
The Senate also discussed issues concern
ing general education requirements, basis of
grading and unit inequity across majors.
