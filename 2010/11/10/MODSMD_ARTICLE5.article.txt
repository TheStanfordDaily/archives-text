## Native American Cultural Center begins Christmas toy drive 
### PATRICIA HO 
Stanford's Native American Cultural Cen
ter is set to help host the annual Dolores
Sanchez Memorial Christmas toy drive for
Muwekma Ohlone children with the tribe's
Education and Youth Committee from Nov.
29 to Dec. 3.
The drive is named in honor of the late Do
lores Sanchez, a former Muwekma Ohlone
elder whose close relationship with tribal chil
dren inspired the event, according to Denni
Woodward, associate director of the cultural
center.
"She was just wonderful with children,"
Woodward said. "Her primary goal was to
help current and future generations of chil
dren."
This year, the cultural center has seen an
increase in the number of departments con
tributing to the project, according to Winona
Simms, associate dean and director of the cul
tural center.
"We want to reinforce the value of sharing

and giving," Simms said. "I think that's a beau
tiful thing, because sometimes we can forget
to be grounded in the fact that our people
have a lot of need, and education is away of
getting to a level to where you can give back."
Despite the struggling economy, Wood
ward is hopeful that the drive will meet its goal
of providing presents for more than 200 chil
dren.
"I watch the efforts of programs like Toys
for Tots, and 1 think people generally tend to
try and be generous during the holiday sea
son," Woodward said. "These programs are
continuing, so we'll just keep our fingers
crossed that people keep giving."
The drive will also contribute to the cultur
al center's overall efforts to provide education
and awareness of the Muwekma Ohlone
tribe, which is traditionally indigenous to San
Francisco, San Mateo, northern Santa Clara
and Alameda counties.
"It's respectful to acknowledge your host,
and I think that's why we have a continued re
lationship," Woodward said. "When we come

here, it's important to meet the people whose
land we're on."
Stanford's ongoing relationship with the
tribe dates back to 1988 and is reflected in
Stanford's choice to name the Native Ameri
can theme house Muwekma-tah-Ruk, which
means "home of the people." Additionally,
Stanford collaborates with the Muwekma
Ohlone during several annual events, such as
the First Nations' Campus Welcome and the
Stanford Powwow, according to Woodward.
Simms added that gaining a full under
standing of Stanford's relationship with local
tribes is an important part of the cultural cen
ter's educational efforts for students.
"We learn about their legal strife in trying
to get recognition and some of their more cur
rent issues," Simms said. "They share that with
our incoming frosh and transfer students so
that they get grounded in the history of where
they're going to school and are connected
with native communities in this area."
