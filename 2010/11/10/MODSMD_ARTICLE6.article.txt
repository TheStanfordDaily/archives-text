## Meningitis case remains isolated Vaccines against the disease still not required of students 
### RYAN MAC SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Despite the recent hospitalization of a La
Casa Italiana resident for bacterial meningitis,
cases of the disease on college campuses are
rare.
As the Associated Press reported last month,
flare-ups of the disease are at an all-time low. A
survey of more than 200 college campuses, which
represented a population of more than 2 million
students, revealed there were 11 recorded cases
of bacterial meningitis in the last academic year.
Yet, when the illness does strike, the results
can be devastating. Three of the 11 students who
contracted the disease in the last year died, and
the Center for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) estimates that 10 percent of all bacterial
meningitis cases prove fatal.
It's a concern that prompted Dr. Ira Fried
man, director of Vaden Health Center, to visit
Casa Italiana on Monday night after a resident
was hospitalized with the rare illness. The resi
dent, a female senior, was sent to an undisclosed
hospital on Sunday for a suspected case of bacte
rial meningitis.
School officials declined to comment on the
current condition of the student, citing patient
privacy laws.
At universities especially those that guar
antee four years of housing to undergraduates,
like Stanford high-volume living quarters
and close contact between students can create
auspicious conditions for disease transmission.
Given bacterial meningitis' deadly and fast-act
ing reputation, school officials left little to
chance on Monday, arriving at Casa Italiana
after dinner with prepared statements, antibi
otics and a plethora of handouts.
Friedman said the hospitalized student is sus
pected to have a bacterial type of meningitis
