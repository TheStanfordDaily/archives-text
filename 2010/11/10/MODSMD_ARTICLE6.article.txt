## Meningitis case remains isolated Vaccines against the disease still not required of students 
### RYAN MAC SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Despite the recent hospitalization of a La
Casa Italiana resident for bacterial meningitis,
cases of the disease on college campuses are
rare.
As the Associated Press reported last month,
flare-ups of the disease are at an all-time low. A
survey of more than 200 college campuses, which
represented a population of more than 2 million
students, revealed there were 11 recorded cases
of bacterial meningitis in the last academic year.
Yet, when the illness does strike, the results
can be devastating. Three of the 11 students who
contracted the disease in the last year died, and
the Center for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) estimates that 10 percent of all bacterial
meningitis cases prove fatal.
It's a concern that prompted Dr. Ira Fried
man, director of Vaden Health Center, to visit
Casa Italiana on Monday night after a resident
was hospitalized with the rare illness. The resi
dent, a female senior, was sent to an undisclosed
hospital on Sunday for a suspected case of bacte
rial meningitis.
School officials declined to comment on the
current condition of the student, citing patient
privacy laws.
At universities especially those that guar
antee four years of housing to undergraduates,
like Stanford high-volume living quarters
and close contact between students can create
auspicious conditions for disease transmission.
Given bacterial meningitis' deadly and fast-act
ing reputation, school officials left little to
chance on Monday, arriving at Casa Italiana
after dinner with prepared statements, antibi
otics and a plethora of handouts.
Friedman said the hospitalized student is sus
pected to have a bacterial type of meningitis
known as meningococcal disease.
Bacterial forms of meningitis are
more potent than viral and fungal
types of the disease and should "al
ways be considered a medical emer
gency," according to the CDC.

Friedman: Disease Not Likely to
Spread
Friedman, who has made similar
visits to residences in the past for
other health concerns, wrote in an e
mail to The Daily that his visit to 562
Mayfield Ave. was meant to "share in
formation about the ill student's sus
pected disease and to explain that
close physical contact or intimate ex
posure increases the risk of catching
the illness."
On their Monday visit, Vaden offi
cials gave Casa Italiana residents the
option of taking preventative antibi
otics. The Santa Clara County Public
Flealth Department also contacted
outside students who have are known
to have been in close contact with the
infected resident.
Despite the precautions, Fried
man did not believe there was a high
risk of transmission. In a study by the
CDC, households that experienced a
single case of bacterial meningitis
only had a three to four percent like
lihood of secondary cases among
other residents.
Dr. Sara Cody, deputy health offi
cer for Santa Clara County, reaf
firmed Friedman's statements on the
relative difficulty of transmission,
stating that college dorms only expe
rience a slightly higher risk of disease
spread. The bacteria, normally trans
mitted thorough direct contact of res
piratory droplets and throat secre
tions, were not "not going to live on a
surface or spoon or sofa," she said.
"Spit and snot, that's the bottom
line," Cody added.

Meningitis Vaccine Still Not Re
quired
Some students arrive at Stanford
already vaccinated against meningi
tis, although it is not a required immu
nization for incoming students. Many
doctors and public health officials be
lieve a vaccine is the easiest way to
protect from a disease that can result

in long-term disabilities, such as brain
damage, loss of limbs and deafness.
"It's not a very frequent disease,
but when it happens it's very, very
devastating," said Diane Peterson, as
sociate director for immunization
projects at the Immunization Action
Coalition (lAC). The lAC works to
limit the spread of infectious diseases
by providing educational materials to
doctors and the public on the effec
tiveness of immunization.

"There is no downside to being
vaccinated, just an assurance that you
won't get this horrible disease," she
said.

Still, there are skeptics. Some op
pose vaccinations in general for per
sonal or religious reasons. Others
have doubts about the bacterial
meningitis vaccine in particular, citing
the cost-effectiveness as a reason why
a state or university should not re
quire it. Among them is Friedman.
"I don't think it would be a good
policy to require the vaccine," he said
in an interview with The Daily in
2004. "A vaccine should be required
only when its benefits far outweigh its
costs, in dollars and otherwise. This is
not the case for the meningococcal
vaccine. That's why public health au
thorities support an educational ap
proach."
In an e-mail to The Daily on Tues
day, Friedman did not completely
backtrack on his earlier statement but
did say that that Vaden "encourage[s]
students to be vaccinated, as most are
when they arrive here,"
Peterson echoed that sentiment.
"The vaccination [for bacterial
meningitis] is one of the more pricey
ones, but gosh, what's the value of a
life or an arm or a leg?" she asked.
A vaccine for meningococcal dis
ease costs $l2O at Vaden.
Lexi Peters 'll, a resident at Casa
Italiana, said she had received a vacci
nation against bacterial meningitis
many years ago and was relatively un
concerned with the spread of the dis
ease in the house after the Vaden in
formation session. She said that stu
dents were not worried about moving
out, given that there was only one iso
lated case of infection.
Marie Oamek, manager of hous
ing information and communication,
gave no indication that students
would be moved to new residences.
The infected student may be given
the option of "medically appropri
ate" private quarters if she returns,

Oamek said.
In the meantime, Peters said resi
dents have already tried to make light
of the situation in a week where their
house experienced a disease scare on
Monday and a brief evacuation fol
lowing a gas leak Tuesday morning.
"People are joking that there's
bad karma with Casa because no one
wants to unnecessarily panic," she
said. "This is a serious and unfortu
nate event, but we're just continuing
with daily life as best as possible."
