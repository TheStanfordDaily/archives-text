## TRIVIA TRAINING Team builds on 'Quiz Bowl canon' to win at the buzzer 
### ADEEB SAHAR 
The proctor clears his throat, then begins the ques
tion: "Round one: toss-up. One party of this name
ran Jonathan Blanchard for president in 1884.
Lesser known representatives of another party by
this name are Bates Cooke and Benjamin..."
A firm press of the buzzer button interrupts the proctor
mid-question, and Eastern languages and cultures graduate
student Jenevive Andreas correctly answers, "Anti-Masonic
Party."
Though these sorts of questions might stump the general
population, this example of American history trivia is just
one of many subjects that pose little challenge to the mem
bers of the Stanford Quiz Bowl Club.
But what is Quiz Bowl? Contrary to popular belief, Quiz
B owl is not a club where members meet to take quizzes, grin
ning in delight as they analyze sample experiments for or
ganic chemistry, the silence surrounding them broken only
by the scratch of a pencil on a Scantron card.
Actually, Quiz Bowl is a trivia-based competition where
a team earns points for buzzing in the correct answer to a
"toss-up" question before the other team. Answering a toss
up correctly brings a team to a bonus round, where all the
members of the team can collaborate before submitting a
final answer.
The layout for tournaments is simple: four members of
one team sit next to one another at a table. In front of each
member are corded buzzers. Their opponents, facing them,
sit at a table across from them ordered in the same fashion.
The proctor, who is responsible for reading the questions and
awarding points, is seated at his own table connecting the two
teams.
Before the teams are ready to face off against one anoth
er, however, there is much practice and energy invested in
preparation.
Often, Quiz Bowl tests obscure knowledge, which isn't al
ways easily acquired. In order to successfully answer such
questions, Quiz Bowlers rely on what is known as the "Quiz
Bowl canon."
"The canon is the set of [subjects] that are widely asked
about in Quiz Bowl," said club member Bill Rowan '11." Cer
tain authors or artists, like Shakespeare or Monet, you know
are part of the canon. Questions about these sorts of people
are common."
While most Quiz Bowlers take mental note of these re
curring subjects, some of the most committed players active
ly study in preparation for tournaments.
"Some people I know have a bunch of questions at home
and will actually read them and study them in their spare
time," Rowan said. "Another method [of studying] is if you
get a question wrong, you'll write it down on a sheet of paper,
keeping a list of things to come back to later to study. Later,
you'll look it up on Wikipedia. Others just study the 50 au
thors that come up most often and their top five most popu

lar books."
In this way, many members broaden their knowledge
about many different fields, whether through studying out
side the club or simply competing in practice or tournaments.
"If nothing else, you're exposed to many subjects you
wouldn't otherwise be exposed to," said chemical engineer
ing graduate student Joey Montoia. "Over time, you can in
tegrate that knowledge into your cognitive map."
Regardless of whether members choose to devote a lot of
time to Quiz Bowl outside club meetings or are just interest
ed in broadening their trivia knowledge, Quiz Bowl isn't in
tended to cause stress. The laidback nature of the team and
the relaxed social atmosphere of tournaments and practice
are regarded by some members as the most valued aspect of
the game.
"Quiz Bowl is much more chill than most clubs or any
athletic sport," Rowan said. "Even attendance for practice is
optional, whether you play for interest and come out once in
a while or are a competitive player and come to every prac
tice."
To accommodate the Stanford Quiz Bowlers' varying
motivation levels and personalities, there are four correspon
ding Quiz Bowl tournaments. North Academic Quiz Tourna
ments (NAQT) and Academic Competition Federation
(ACF) tournaments are the most competitive, with qualify
ing rounds and playoffs held at Stanford, Berkeley and UC-
Los Angeles. Teams competing in these matches vie for a
spot at the national title tournament, which last year was held
in Maryland.
Unlike most sports programs or some high-profile clubs,
success for most schools' Quiz Bowl teams varies from year
to year because they tend not to recruit, and strong players
all eventually graduate. But as undergraduate Quiz Bowlers
move on to graduate school, there is a transfer of talent from
the team they started on as undergrads to the team they end
up on as grad students.
"Just as in professional sports there will be players who
get traded from team to team," Rowan said."There are some
really good players who will go to grad school, and in a sense
they've traded to a different team because grad students are
eligible to play."
While these perpetual shakeups are a concern for top
teams vying for national recognition, the intramural tourna
ments and the Freshmen Quiz League offer a casual niche
for on-and-off players to get their trivia fix and are the most
popular with players.
President of Stanford Quiz Bowl Club Alborz Behjnood
'l3 recalled the role Freshman Quiz League played in shap
ing his memorable freshman year.
"For me, [Freshman Quiz League] was a great experience
because I got to know people in my dorm who competed
with me, and I got to meet people from different dorms, hang
out, laugh and make fun of dumb answers we made," Be
hjnood said. "It was a good experience both to get introduced
to club members and other freshmen with similar interests,
whether they came for fun or the competitive aspect or the
social aspect."
