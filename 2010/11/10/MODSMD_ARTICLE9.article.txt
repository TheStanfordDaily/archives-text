## SENT FROM MY IPHONE Who You Tryin' to Get Crazy With, Ese? Don't You Know I'm Four Loko? 
### Peter McDonald 
Currently, it's banned in one state, al
most banned in two others, the subject
of a pending federal investigation and
is contraband on numerous college campus
es. Some people call it "blackout in a can,"
others "cocaine in a can," but that's an insult
to both blackouts and cocaine. It's usually
characterized as either the Devil's backwash
or the nectar of the bros, but Four Loko is so
much more than that. Four Loko is the epit
ome of generational struggles, the latest in
carnation of college drinking as bogeyman, a
testament to American capitalism, a poten
tial destroyer of society, but most important
ly, Four Loko is sold at Ernie's on El Camino
as well as at the 7-lls off Waverley in Palo
Alto and in Menlo Park (who have some of
the dullest clerks I've ever met, by the way),
for $2.69 a can, and holy shit will you feel
cracked out and on top of the world if you're
not huddled over a trash can.
It's been out since 2005, but it took a few
reports of people going to the hospital after
nights of irresponsible drinking that includ
ed consumption of Four Loko (remember,
don't go Twelve Loko), but once they did,
people went Eight Loko with hysteria.
Media outlets, including our own Stanford
Daily, have labeled it "blackout in a can"
while simultaneously saying that it contains
"up to three or four beers in a can." Let's
clear the air right now, because only 6-year
olds black out from three beers. Four Loko
has 4.8 AlcoholEdu-approved "standard
drinks" in it, or 5.6 Coors Lights. Functional
ly, it's a bottle of bum wine with caffeine in it.
The brainchild of three Ohio State alums
who thought buying vodka and Red Bull
separately was just too expensive, it now oc
cupies the shelves of every gas station, mini
mart and liquor store across the country (ex
cept the CVS in Town & Country. Get with
the times, guys.). It's really the American
Dream come to life. Never have I been
prouder to be from Columbus, Ohio. O-H!
The Helen Lovejoys over in the Senate
keep claiming that the packaging is designed
to appeal to children, which is one of the
dumber things I have heard this year. Never
has a can's packaging more appealed to the
bro/broski/broseph demographic than Four
Loko's. That 12 percent alcohol by volume
(displayed seven times) is a badge of honor,
and it gets right at the way the cash-strapped
college student's mind works when staring
down the beer aisle, and that's because Four
Loko is truly a beverage for our generation.
It's such a product of our time that even
Gawker doesn't get it.
Today's college student is constantly busy
with no time to waste, and that includes
drinking, as well. Our older siblings may

have perfected the art of the Power Hour,
but even that takes an entire hour. You can
comfortably drink a Four Loko in 15 min
utes or less. We also hate uncertainty. If
you're not careful, a casual drinking of a six
pack can sometimes lead to unexpected so
briety, even as late as 11:45 p.m. That uva-fla
vored Four Loko in your hands, that right
there is insurance that no matter what else
happens, at least you won't be too sober to
walk home alone after striking out all night.
But above all else, in this age of Obama, our
generation hates class barriers, and Four
Loko is egalitarian. First-gen students and
fifth-generation legacies alike can unite in
the celebration of Four Loko, because while
people disagree on the taste of various alco
hols, taste has never been the issue with Four
Loko.
If I learned anything in 10th grade AP Art
History, though, it's that the problem with
beauty is that it's largely ephemeral.
MADD, parents' groups and fun-hating
deans all across the country have finally
started to martial their forces to put a stop to
it. Michigan was the first state to ban it out
right, most likely because three Buckeyes
came up with a multi-million dollar idea.
Four Loko's days may be numbered, but it
doesn't matter because the caffeine, ginseng
and taurine-laced 12 percent ABV flood
gates are open, and there's no closing them.
Fellow competitors Joose and Core both
have drinks that are exactly the same and
the de-caffeinated corporate impostor
known as Tilt also upped its content to 12
percent. It's officially a Hydra.
The president of Ramapo College said,
"There's no redeeming social purpose to be
served by having the beverage," and he's
right, but who said there had to be one? Four
Loko is single-handedly supercharging the
college experience nationwide, increasing
the drunk baseline and giving people better
college stories. That sounds like a public
service to me. So mosey on over to Ernie's or
7-11, but just remember two things, kids.
Watch yo'selves when you do, and never
EVER go Twelve Loko.

Have a perfectly logical response to write out
the concern the health of college students
everywhere? E-mailpetermc@stanford.edu.
