# Your Version.com: The Pandora for your real-time Web content
## 
### ASHLEY MENZIES 
Pandora has long maintained its place as a
top source for personalized music. Users
simply type in their favorite artists or songs,
and the site generates a playlist of songs tai
lored to their musical tastes. Now imagine
this idea of personalized recommendations applied
to your online news content.
Dan Olsen M.B.A. '9B, CEO of Your Version and
Stanford Graduate School of Business alumnus, has
founded a website that does exactly this. A user, in
lieu of using a search engine, a bookmark or an RSS
feed, may simply go to one website and all the news
he or she cares about will appear.
Olsen describes Your Version as the Pandora of
real-time Web content. What he has termed a "dis
covery engine" pulls together the most recent and
relative online sources related to the user's interests
without any searching, including news, blogs, tweets
and videos.
"You sit back and our product just pushes it back
to you," Olsen said.
How Does It Work?
Users type their interests into the Your Version
"discovery engine," which then produces articles that
are both recent and relevant to their topics. The site

gives the user control via a "recency"-relevancy slid
er in the top left corner of the page. Depending on the
user's intent, he or she can shift a dial more toward
more recent or more relevant content.
The site also encourages sharing content and pro
vides tools to simplify the process. Users can share links
via Facebook, Twitter or e-mail. Your Version provides
Web browser tools for Chrome, Safari and Firefox.The
site automatically shortens URLs to 140 characters,
which is the character limitation on Twitter.
"I love the link-shortening feature of the
Your Version toolbar for Firefox, and I love that it
tracks your preferences over time and
e-mails you interesting stories,"
said Stephanie Werner 'll, a for
mer marketing intern at
Your Version, in an e-mail to
The Daily.
Using these browser tools,
users can share whatever
content from any website,
as long as they're logged
in to Your Version. To
share content via Face
book takes about five seconds.
As Werner pointed out, the
site also sends out an optional
weekly e-mail tailored to the user's

interests. It provides the top 10 stories of the week, as
well as a free iPod and iPad app so users can access
Your Version anywhere they go.
Why Your Version?
Olsen came up with the idea for the site after real
izing that several websites gain so much personal
data about their users, yet never use any of it. He be
lieves that even though Open Table a restaurant
reservation booking site provides a great service
to its customers, it misses the oppor
tunity to provide personalized rec
ommendations based on users' his
tory. To Olsen, Amazon does a great
job at this, with its "More Items to
Consider" and "New For You"
suggestions, among others.
Olsen decided to capitalize
on the idea of information gath
ering to help people access the
news they care about. He thought,
"Why don't we help people solve
the information overload prob
lem?"
The Official Google Blog
noted that there are "a trillion
unique URLs, and the number
of individual web pages out

there is growing by several billion pages per day."
Olsen said that it becomes challenging for people
to sort through the material relevant to their inter
ests.
"The way to solve this information overload chal
lenge for users is to serve what is highly relative to
them," Olsen proposed. "The tool needs to get smart
about you."
Your Version also harnesses collective intelli
gence. In other words, it aggregates all of the data
from users, while adding human intelligence to make
the content more personalized. In particular,
Your Version gathers a large amount of attention
data the interaction between the user and the site.
The Your Version staff has conducted 80 one-on
one usability tests. In each test, a staff member watch
es the respondent interact with the site and tracks po
tential difficulties.
A number of Stanford students have interned
with the start-up to help ensure a positive customer
experience.
"I had a great time working at Your Version," said
Orr Keshet, a computer science coterminal student.
"The working environment is fun and you are always
working on something interesting. There is never a
dull moment."
Since its launch in 2009 at the TechCrunchso Con
ference, Your Version has won the People's Choice
Awards at multiple start-up events: TechCrunchso,
SF New Tech, the Play Berkeley Digital Media Con
ference, SNAP Summit's Fail Con and SF Beta.
Stanford students are starting to catch the vision.
"I like Your Version because it enables me to eas
ily follow my key interests," said Cassandra Espinoza
'll. "It could be very useful to other students."
