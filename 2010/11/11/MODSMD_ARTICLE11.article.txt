## US-India ties 'anemic,' says scholar Economic potential untapped, argues visiting FSI scholar 
### ELLORA ISRANI 
Ahead of President Obama's speech to India's
parliament on Monday about the promising poten
tial of the U.S.-India relationship, Anja Manuel '96,
visiting scholar at the Freeman Spogli Institute for
International Studies, postulated a very different
theory: for all the hype, U.S.-India relations are far
from where they could be.
Manuel published an article entitled "Weak Ties"
last week in Foreign Policy magazine, calling the eco
nomic relationship between the two superpowers
"anemic."
"On the surface, all the elements are in place for
an economic love affair between the United States
and India," wrote Manuel. "Yet the economic rela
tionship between these two natural partners remains
far below potential."
"The U.S.-India economic relationship is already
quite strong, but given the amount of rhetoric you
have about it. .. you hear both sides saying again
and again how wonderful the bilateral business-to
business ties are, and I think we shouldn't be too self
congratulatory," Manuel said in an interview with
The Daily.
In the article, Manuel suggests several potential
steps for both sides that could provide economic and
diplomatic benefits. For example, Prime Minister
Manmohan Singh and the Indian Parliament could
attempt to liberalize the "license raj" the govern
mental red tape complicating foreign business in

volvement in India while the United States could
attempt to equalize the disparity between last year's
foreign direct investment in China, $15.8 billion, and
in India, $3.5 billion.
However, Manuel cautions against being too crit
ical of the Washington-New Delhi ties, which she
called "very, very good."
"India is only going to become a closer and closer
partner of the United States in the next five, 10, 15
years," Manuel said. "[We will have] closer and clos
er economic ties, closer and closer people-to-people
ties, including lots of Indian students studying here.
There are very few American students studying in
India. I bet that will change. I bet in a decade you'll
have a Stanford program in India."
Manuel points to three recent presidential visits
to India President Clinton in 2000, President
Bush in 2006 and now President Obama in 2010
as a clear indication of the strength of the diplomat
ic relationship between the two nations.
"Three presidential visits in a decade is a lot,"
Manuel said. "Before then it took, like, 50 years for
three U.S. presidents to show up in India."
Still, the definition of the U.S.-India partnership
has varied widely under the three presidents. During
the Bush administration, significant focus was placed
on the Indo-U.S. civilian nuclear agreement, which
Manuel herself helped to negotiate. However,
Obama's cabinet is taking a much broader approach.
"The Obama administration has been extremely
engaged, it's just that they're engaged on a huge
number of issues," Manuel said, including multiple
dialogues: "one on energy and one on education and
all these different things. But none of them are all-
consuming in away that when I was
doing this in the Bush administra
tion, the civilian nuclear deal was a
huge priority."
This diversity of interaction
could present both benefits and
challenges.
"Stuff has sort of gone more
under the radar," Manuel said.
"And that's both OK, because
that's how allies work together .. .
on the other hand, what worries me
about the diplomatic relationship is
that when you try to do too much,
the danger is that you don't get any
thing done."
Another major obstacle in eco
nomic and diplomatic connections
has been the tense relationship be
tween India and Pakistan. India has

encouraged the United States to
declare Pakistan a terrorist state,
although the U.S. has so far refused
to do so.
"We are more natural partners
with India because it's a democracy,
it's a very open society, you have
lots of Indian students in the U.S.,
and you have lots and lots of Indi
an-Americans in the U. 5.," Manuel
said. "It's a different relationship
from the one we have with Pak
istan, which is an essential partner
for us, in particular an essential
partner in Afghanistan and in the
war on terror."
Despite these issues, Manuel af
firms the promising nature of the
U.S.-India relationship.
"India has definitely moved to
the front of what people are think
ing about in the U. 5.," said Manuel.
"It will be a natural partnership."
