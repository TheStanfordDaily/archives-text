## THE 						CAMPUS BEAT Make Time for Music 
### Lucas Will Johnson 
Amid all the classes to take, clubs to
join, friends to run around with and
all other sorts of general collegiate
mayhem, it can be easy to run out of time for
the arts. As midterms rolled around, we put
things on pause to make room for studying.
Our calendars are booked, and the free time
we have we use to relax. As I've been writing
this column about improving the music situ
ation on campus, I've realized that a simple
way to build it up is if people just make more
time for it.
Give up your studies! Devote your life to
your instrument! No students here clearly
have certain priorities. But it's still useful to
think about how the priorities play out. Ar
guably, we're mostly here to learn, right? We
have amazing faculty who impart all varieties
of important knowledge and research into
our little heads. We need time to do the read
ings, to go to lecture, to finish the problem
sets. With only four years, we pile up the units
each quarter to fit in as many classes as possi
ble. And that's not even enough seniors al
ways bemoan the fact that they ran out of
time to take the dozens of other classes that
looked interesting. Not to mention that peo
ple generally try to get good grades.
But academics aren't the only way to
learn. Though music is a specific subject, play
ing an instrument is its own satisfying type of
learning. Aside from the fun of creating
music, instruments can supplement our stud
ies in other areas. Being taught how to manip
ulate these little musical machines can
demonstrate all kinds of concepts, from emo
tion to physics to culture. And if you join a
musical group, you get to deal with all sorts of
group dynamics and management issues.
Clearly you can learn from music if you
want to add that means of learning into your
life. But we're not just in college to learn; you
could learn most things from books. College
also gives us a community of friends and
peers to enjoy. One of the most exciting parts
about showing up at Stanford was the possi
bility of meeting, knowing and making friends
with some crazy-awesome people. Burying
yourself in academics at the expense of
friends isn't all that rewarding, and (if you
take a cynical career perspective) it denies

you a big networking opportunity.
Luckily, having fun with friends doesn't
have to be a reason to ignore the arts and
music either. As I've talked about before, a lot
of students here are pretty amazing musi
cians. If you play an instrument, you can join
a group, or put one together. Even if you don't
play, you can attend your friends' concerts
and performances. I'm not suggesting people
aren't doing this we have tons of music
groups, and we've all heard a friend shout, "I
see you [insert name]!" at student shows.
But there are several times when I've seen
music take a back seat. When that instrument
sits under the bed, collecting dust. When those
two hours during that concert on a Friday
seem essential for studying even though the
test is Monday. When a full schedule equates
to a student group and classes without any
music lessons.
There are plenty of good reasons to study,
and I don't mean to suggest sacrificing for the
sake of the arts. But all the time spent procras
tinating or wasting time out of laziness
those are prime moments to pull the instru
ment out of the closet and be creative. Face
book and You Tube don't need you. When
you're 40, you'll more fondly remember jam
ming with your friends or that awesome con
cert you went to.
I know I'm just another person pleading
for more participation and appreciation of
the arts. And I know that we're all ridiculous
ly busy it's not like music is neglected on
campus. But in college and in life, it's easy to
get caught up in the routine and push some
things down the priority ladder. So don't let
music go too much by the wayside.
