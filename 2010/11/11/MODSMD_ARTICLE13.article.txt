## A 						Day in the Life of a Hijabi 
### MAIEL-SADANY '11 
£ £ ~Y~ou know you don't have to wear
Y that thing anymore. You're in
America!" said the elderly
woman to my friend, pointing to her head
scarf. Little did she know that this friend had
both grown up in "America" and made the
very personal decision to wear the hijab, or
Islamic headscarf, despite protest and lack of
support from a number of her own family
and friends.
As human beings, we often take in the vi
sual cues around us and very naturally jump
to conclusions. Although there is no doubt
that there are women today who are forced
to dress a certain way and are limited in soci
etal participation in a highly subjugated man
ner, it is also very true that females of a vari
ety of races, backgrounds and ages embrace
the decision to wear the hijab.
I choose to cover because it's a command
ment directed to women in the Holy Quran.
I hate how people stare. I love matching my
scarves with the rest of my outfits; I've
learned so much about color coordination in
the process. I get so annoyed with students
who think I'm going to be quiet in section
and not have opinions of my own; it's like
their mouth drops in shock when they hear
that I have a voice and it's actually quite loud.
I love not having to worry about my hair
when I'm running late for class.
Wherever I go, it's like I'm a walking "ex
pert" or "spokesperson" for Islam and Mus
lims (because we're all the same, right?). I
wonder if I'd have more friends if I didn't
wear hijab. I love the sense of empowerment
I get and how all my interactions and rela
tionships are based on how I think and act,
not necessarily what I look like. It's nice to be
regarded as a human, not an object. I hate
how some people abuse religion to carry out
violence and then it ends up hurting me. It's
so frustrating how a country like France
thinks it has the right to regulate and limit
how a woman can express herself. It's already
tough sorting out issues of religion and cul
ture as a college student, and I appreciate
how my friends really respect me for having

my values and beliefs while being able to
keep an open mind. It's not oppressing; it's
liberating.
Hijab means many different things to
many different women. Among the most
common interpretations behind the com
mandment to wear hijab is the requirement
that women dress in a modest way that cov
ers all but their faces, hands and oftentimes
feet. The commandment is based on the Is
lamic emphasis on the concept of modesty as
well as specific verses from the Quran and
Prophetic traditions. For mainstream schol
ars and Muslims, the headscarf is a physical
boundary that facilitates modest and profes
sional interaction between genders, not isola
tion; many verses in the Quran indicate the
importance and equity of women in society
and their duty to be active and involved
members within the political, social and eco
nomic realms of the local, national and glob
al communities in which they reside.
Despite the prevalence and recognition of
the importance of wearing hijab in many
Muslim societies, it is also agreed upon that
the headscarf is a very personal decision and
aspect of a practitioner's relationship with
God, a relationship that cannot be enforced
or dictated by any man or woman. Dr. Jamal
Badawi of the North American Fiqh Council
emphasizes that although he views hijab as a
required tenet in Islam, it was never in the
Prophetic approach to implement "compul
sion or force" in these matters.
I'll never forget what one colleague once
said to me on this issue: "I may not agree with
or completely understand your decision to
wear hijab, but I would die defending your
right to make that choice.
