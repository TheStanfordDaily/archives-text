# THIS COLUMN IS IRONIC
## OMGeorge! 
### Shane Savitsky 
On Monday night, I found myself in
Cubberley Auditorium with 400 of my
closest friends to see George Clooney
up close and personal. All of the ladies
around me gabbed about his chiseled fea
tures and his perfect body. I have to admit:
there wasn't a hair out of place. This is one
good-looking dude. His handsomeness is so
distracting that I think the girl next to me
who snapped pictures the entire time didn't
even hear a word he said. In fact, I'm not sure
most people there heard anything he had to
say. They were all too busy imagining sunning
themselves on the patio of his villa on Lake
Como.

Personally, I couldn't wait to hear his sure
to-be hilarious stories about working on the
"Ocean's Eleven" series or how it feels to
have been named People Magazine's Sexiest
Man Alive twice. The problem is, he didn't
talk about any of that. He talked about
Africa. Here I am, expecting badass tales of
his drunken debauchery at the Academy
Awards and he starts preaching to me about
Sudan. Way to be a downer, George. If he's
going to talk about humanitarian things, he
could at least talk about the good stuff. You
know, like the $6l million his Hope for Haiti
telethon raised earlier this year. At least
we're seeing resul wait, there's a cholera
outbreak in Port-au-Prince? Oh. Damn.

Honestly, I don't understand how George
Clooney is an expert on Africa. I guess he
won an Oscar for "Syriana" and that movie
might have been set in Africa. I remember
something about oil. There was definitely a
desert in there somewhere. I'm going to as
sume that they have deserts and oil in Africa,
thus it doesn't seem far-fetched that in re
searching his role, George somehow figured
out everything there is to know about
African politics. Or maybe he still thinks he's
Batman and he has to save the world. Actual-

ly, that explanation makes more sense.
My first tip-off that this talk wouldn't be
George relating how to pick up supermodel
after supermodel should have been that it
was co-sponsored by STAND and Crothers.
STAND is a national student anti-genocide
organization. I'm told its name actually does
n't "STAND" for anything anymore, but if it
did, it would probably be something like Stu
dents Telling Africa Not to Die.Then we have
Crothers as the "global citizenship" focus
dorm. Are we really tossing these theme dis
tinctions out this easily now? It's starting to
get a little ridiculous, Stanford. Maybe we can
designate West Flo as the "aboriginal Aus
tralian" theme dorm next. (Don't get me
started on how Storey, the human biology
theme house, has a prime location on the
Lower Row. Come to think of it, I don't think
Sigma Nu has done anything relevant for a

while, so can we make their house the politi
cal science theme house? Not for selfish rea
sons or anything ...)
Then again, I guess I shouldn't be sur
prised that Monday's talk would be an ac
tivist discussion of the upcoming referendum
in Sudan. This is Stanford we're talking about
where we're constantly bombarded with a
stream of e-mails for this charity group and
that activist event. It wouldn't surprise me to
hear that there's some group out there on
campus dedicated to stopping polio among
Inuit children in northwest Alaska. Just
seems like something we here at Stanford
would do, right? Personally, I think a more
worthwhile cause would be helping to fund a
stint in rehab for Kesha, but that's just be
cause I don't want to deal with her anymore.
For me, I think Stanford's overwhelming
activism only made the George Clooney
event more amusing. We pride ourselves on
being so forward-thinking when it comes to
social issues, yet the only way to get 400 peo
ple together to hear about this Sudan matter
was to have one of the world's biggest movie
stars on hand. I understand that even we at
Stanford can't possibly care about all of these
issues. You were probably still worried about
freeing Tibet. Maybe you were trying to pro
mote political freedom in Iran. Perhaps you
were raising awareness about genocide in the
Congo. Or were you still texting the Red
Cross on your iPhone to donate more money
for earthquake relief in Haiti?
You know what? Who cares about any of
that? George Clooney was here on Monday!
And he was looking good. Damn good.
That's all that matters.

There are few people on this planet more at
tractive than George Clooney. Shane knows he
isn't one of them, so make him feel better by e
mailing him at savitsky@stanford.edu.

This is one
good-looking
dude.
