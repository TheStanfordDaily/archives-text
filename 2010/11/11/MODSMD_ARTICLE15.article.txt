## Out of Context 
### Rachel Kolb 
Did I come to Oxford out of a desire to
reinvent myself? This is a question
that kept sliding through my head
when I arrived in Britain in time for Freshers'
Week, the Oxford version of NSO. It was as if
I'd entered freshman year all over again,
marveling at stone buildings, towering spires
and a world that seemed fresh and new.
Don't get me wrong: I hadn't come to Ox
ford to escape Stanford.The decision to leave
my life on-campus had been a difficult one.
But it was still enticing to realize how much I
was learning and changing through my trav
els. I could be anything here. It was the same
feeling I'd had during those hazy September
days two years ago, but tempered less by ap
prehension and more by wonder.
For the first time, I saw how much I had
matured in those two years, and how much
my peers had also. Besides being older and
more confident, the greatest difference was
our sense of Stanford identity. Even if we
began as strangers, we all knew the Farm. If
all else failed, we could always talk about
Stern or Roble or Kimball, or compare notes
on classes and clubs and very likely discover
and discuss mutual friends. During one
evening in London, I sat through a 30-minute
conversation about favorite restaurants in
Palo Alto. Although it at first felt comforting
to disclose my Stanford self to these new
friends, I soon found it restrictive. I had come
to Oxford to discover myself outside the bub
ble but, eight time zones and 5000 miles
away, that bubble still persisted.
We were all bound by the context of being
Stanford Students, with a capital S. This phe
nomenon, for me, was not unlike that of re
turning home for the holidays and seeing old
high school friends, or returning to any group
in which I have a fixed role. During these in
teractions, I often find conversation lapsing
into the same patterns of reminisce. We dis
cuss the same things we did in our friend
ship's heyday, the same events, the same peo
ple. As for the foreign territory of our present
selves? Only categorized and summed up

into a neatly rehearsed elevator speech. We
are perpetually stuck in our past lives, be
cause that is the only common context that
we share.
Packaging myself into a prescribed "con
text" seemed to be the best way to make
small talk in this city of dreaming spires, but
it was not what I wanted from my time
abroad. I did not want to reinvent myself at
Oxford, but I did want to see how my identi
ty would hold up in, say, London rather than
Palo Alto.
In many ways, this is indeed what has hap
pened. My experiences have allowed me to
discover and reaffirm things about myself
and other people. But, surprisingly, these re
flections have even arisen from seemingly
unrelated situations like my Oxford tutorial.
Having done the reading and having written
the required weekly essay, I remember walk
ing into my first tutorial with a sense of min
gled anticipation and dread. I expected to
have the logic of my argument picked apart,
my thesis dismantled, each paragraph and
sentence challenged.
But I had forgotten: this was not PWR 1.
Instead, my Oxford don merely read the
essay through, then launched our meeting
into a broader philosophical discussion. My
written argument was only the starting point,
not an end in itself. I realized with some as
tonishment that she had given me the com
pliment of taking my writing skills for grant
ed.
Taking each other's identities for granted
not ignoring them, but building on them
instead of dwelling on surface details are
these not the qualities we seek in our closest
relationships? Our closest friends are the
friends with whom we are not bound by con
text or circumstance, the ones with whom we
are free to be simply ... ourselves. A friend
ship is like an intellectual conversation: free
flowing, not bound by the rules of rhetorical
argument, not even required to have a single
unified thesis.

Perhaps it is appropriate that I should end

up reflecting so much on friendship, being so
far from the people with whom I am used to
sharing my life. Being at Oxford has brought
me to question my own approach to the rela
tionships that make our time at Stanford so
memorable. Why do we limit ourselves to a
certain context, within a certain group? Is it
because the full stretch and sprawl of our
identity is too overwhelming, too tedious or
too difficult to express? Are we afraid to
allow the people around us to see us as more
than physics or English majors, or singers or
swimmers, or even Stanford students? As
hard as we try, none of these labels can de
note us truly.
In the end, all I can say is this: once I re
turn to the Farm, I can only hope that my
time abroad will challenge me to examine
the context, the assumptions and the labels
with which I define myself.
