In "Meningitis case remains iso
lated" (Nov. 10), information attrib
uted to Marie Oamek should have
been attributed to Rodger Whitney,
executive director of Student Hous
ing. The Daily incorrectly attributed
the information to Oamek, manager
of housing information and commu
nication, who provided Whitney's
comments to The Daily.

In "Fans Rally for BCS Bid"
(Nov. 10), The Daily incorrectly im
plied that, traditionally, the No. 2
Pac-10 team would automatically
get a Rose Bowl bid if the No. 1 team
in the conference went to the BCS
title game. In fact, while the No. 2
Pac-10 team would have been
strongly favored for the spot, it was
never a guarantee.
