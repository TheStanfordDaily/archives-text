## FINAL FACE OFF Card plays Cal in last game 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The men's soccer team has dealt with
adversity all season long. Several injuries to
key players kept head coach Bret Simon
from finalizing a consistent roster early on
in the season, and four straight heartbreak
ing losses two of which came in over
time knocked the Cardinal from its pre
season perch at No. 13 in the national rank
ings.
Stanford fought its way back to .500 en
tering Pac-10 play and stunned then-No. 13
UCLA with a late goal at home. But a late
three-game slide saw the team's NCAA
Tournament dreams all but disappear head
ing into the final week of conference play.
Tonight, the Cardinal will head across
the Bay to take on its rival, No. 8 California
(11-2-3, 7-1-1 Pac-10), in the last regular
season game of 2010. At stake for Stanford
(8-9-0, 4-5-0) on Veterans Day is mostly
pride, as a postseason bid is all but impos
sible, but Simon says that it won't be diffi
cult for the players to get fired up for the
match.
"This is a big rivalry game, no ques
tion," Simon said. "It's a measuring stick, as
well, because Cal is the highest-rated team
on the West Coast, so this should give us a
chance to see where we're at. It's also im
portant to make a statement for our seniors
as well as for our younger players."
It won't be easy to send the class of 2011
off in style, however. Cal enters the game on
a three-game winning streak and has lost
only once in its last 13 matches. The last time
the teams met, on Oct. 2, Cal came out of
Laird Q. Cagan Stadium with a 3-0 win that
was much closer than it appeared on paper.
Sophomore midfielder Hunter Gorskie
said that the toughest part of this final game

might be playing away from Stanford, even
if Berkeley is just across the Bay.
"Going to play at their home facility
might be the biggest challenge because it's
always tough to play on the road," he said.
"But it will definitely be a scrap, a fight, and
if we are ready for it then we should be
okay."
It will be redshirt senior midfielder Thia
go Sa Freire's last game in a Stanford uni
form, and he commented that although this
year's record isn't stellar, the Card is still a
quality team capable of pulling off the
upset.
"Cal is definitely a great team, but we're
a real good team too," he said. "This is our
last chance to prove ourselves. We are going
to go out there and play our game, and may
the best team win."
History is not on the Cardinal's side
the last Stanford team to win in Berkeley
was the 2000 squad that reached the NCAA
quarterfinals. NCAA player of the year
Ryan Nelsen and fellow All-American Lee
Morrison headlined that team.
"It would be real sweet to knock them
off," Gorskie said. "Obviously we want to go
out strong and maybe try to get back at
them."
It will take a strong effort to exact re
venge on the Golden Bears, but the game
might come at the perfect time for an upset.
Cal has played in an astounding five straight
overtime games, four of which went into
double overtime. However, if the Golden
Bears win, they will clinch the Pac-10 title
outright and earn an automatic berth to the
NCAA Tournament.
Kickoff at Edwards Stadium is slated for
2 p.m. this afternoon.
