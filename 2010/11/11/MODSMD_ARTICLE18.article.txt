# PAC-10 EXPANSION
## Stanford Athletics expects financial gain 
### HENRY ZHU 
After grappling with budget difficulties for
the past two years, Stanford Athletics is set to
receive a significant boost in revenue as the
new Pac-12 Conference's media deals are
renegotiated in 2011.
With the full integration of Colorado and
Utah to the existing Pac-10 set for the 2011-12

academic year, the Pac-12 has made aggres
sive moves to increase the conference's at
tractiveness to media networks.
Along with the addition of the new schools,
the Pac-12 will employ a new revenue-sharing
plan, which will go into effect starting in the
2012-13 academic year. Though yet to be ne
gotiated, the new media deals are expected to
earn upward of $175 million, which will be dis

tributed evenly among the schools in the con
ference.
Currently, the Pac-10 uses an appearance
based model to parcel out revenue: the
schools that appear on television the most re
ceive the biggest shares. This arrangement has
historically favored the Southern California
schools; USC and UCLA tend to ap
pear on television more often than
the other eight schools.
When asked if this new revenue
will keep the Stanford athletic de
partment financially stable, Brian
Talbott, the chief financial officer of
Stanford Athletics, was cautiously
optimistic.
"It depends on what the actual
amount of the deal ends up being,
but the expectation is there to be a
big boost to the budget for many
years to come," Talbott said.
He added that the predefined
revenue split was a superior model
for Stanford.
"This is absolutely better," Tal
bott said. "It's much easier to budget
when you know the amount of
money you're getting at the begin
ning of the year."
Still, it's hard to quantify exactly
how much Stanford Athletics will re
ceive as the conference expands. In
addition to bringing in two new

schools, the Pac-12 Championship
Game in football will bring in addi
tional revenue for the conference.
Stanford's athletics department
has recently had to aggressively cut
costs to stay profitable without cut
ting any of its 35 varsity sports,
though the fencing team had to raise
$250,000 by itself to keep its varsity
status.The 2010-11 budget for athlet
ics operations and financial aid cur
rently stands at $85.7 million, repre
senting 9 percent of the University's
budget for administrative and auxil
iary units.
Across the Bay, UC-Berkeley has
had to cut five of its varsity athletic
teams, which will impact 163 stu
dent-athletes and 13 full-time coach
es at Cal.
"It's a course of last resort for any
athletic department to do anything
like this," Talbott said. "Our new TV
deal will hopefully help prevent
something like this from happening
and bring financial stability [to Stan
ford Athletics]."
Though Stanford may not have
been in desperate need of money, the
incoming revenue will be very help
ful.

"We are largely dependent on our

endowment and gifts, and both of
those sources suffered as a result of
the economic downturn," Talbott
said. "The additional money from
the TV deal will certainly help us
bounce back."
Indeed, losses in the athletics en
dowment (which is separate from
Stanford's general endowment)
were especially damaging for the
athletics department. A 27 percent
drop in fiscal year 2009 in the endow
ment caused a $5 million shortfall,
since much of the department's fi
nancial aid for athletes was covered
by endowment payouts.
Stanford Athletics, a self-con
tained entity that runs independent
ly on the revenues it generates, has
not yet figured out whether it will be
able to contribute any surplus back
to the University's general budget,
according to Talbott.
"We'll have to wait until we see
what the actual TV deal is," he said.
"The current TV deal has provisions
to allow us to renegotiate. We will
have a good idea hopefully before
the start of next football season."
