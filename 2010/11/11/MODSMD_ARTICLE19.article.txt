# CONFIDENT CARD HITS THE ROAD
## Stanford begins crucial road trip without starting middle blocker Stephanie Browne 
### KATHERINE KNOX CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The No. 2 Stanford women's volleyball team (20-2,11-2
Pac-10) will embark on its longest road trip of the season this
weekend as it heads north to take on the Washington State
Cougars (6-16,0-12) and the No. 11 Washington Huskies (18-
5,7-5) on Friday and Saturday. The Cardinal approaches the
weekend fresh off a pair of wins in Maples Pavilion last week
end that allowed the team to reclaim a tie atop the conference
standings with No. 4 California (21-2,11-2).
Three returning All-American seniors have contributed
significantly to the Cardinal's success thus far. Outside hitter
Alix Klineman, libero Gabi Ailes and setter/opposite Cassidy
Lichtman have led the Card to the top of the Pac-10 in both
hitting percentage and assists per set, as well as second in digs
per set.
The Card has been able to better utilize Lichtman as both
a setter and an opposite hitter since the return of sophomore
setter Karissa Cook. After earning her 11th double-double of
the season, Lichtman was recognized as Pac-10 player of the
week for the first time in her Stanford career.
The Cardinal seniors will enter Bohler Gym in Pullman
this Friday to take on the Cougars for the last time this season.

The No. 2 women's volleyball team heads to Washington this weekend to clash
with a pair of conference foes in the Cougars and Huskies. The Cardinal will be
without Stephanie Browne, above, who was injured against UCLA last weekend.
Pac-10 in every conference statistic
aside from service aces, where they
rank seventh (Stanford, in compari
son, ranks ninth).
Nonetheless, Washington State
does post impressive statistics from its
primary outside hitter junior Mea
gan Ganzer is third in the Pac-10 in
both kills per set (4.80) and points per
set (5.45). Ganzer posted 12 kills on 38
swings against the Card at Maples last
month, but was held to a less-than
stellar .105 hitting percentage by the
Stanford defense. Ailes picked up 19
digs in three quick sets.
The Huskies, though perennial con
ference contenders, have not met their
traditional success in the Pac-10 this

season. Until beating the Cougars in
Pullman last weekend, Washington had
dropped five consecutive matches on
the road, relegating the team to fourth
place in the conference standings.
The Huskies remain on the brink
of the top 10 in the AVCA Coaches'
Poll because they remain undefeated
in Hec Edmundson Pavilion this sea
son. Although Stanford brought down
the Huskies in four close sets earlier
this season, 24-26,25-17,25-16,32-30,
the Card has fallen in its last two visits
to Seattle the team has posted a 4-
5 record on the road against Washing
ton under current head coach John
Dunning.
Freshman middle blocker Carly
Wopat anticipated the importance of
playing "our calm and collected game
without letting being on the road in
terfere with what we can do."
With redshirt junior middle block
er Stephanie Browne sidelined by in

jury, Wopat has become Stanford's
team leader in blocks per set.
Led by senior outside and opposite
hitters Becky Perry and Kindra Carl
son, as well as senior setter Jenna Hag
glund, Washington's fast pin-to-pin of
fense may pose trouble for the Stan
ford block. Although the Card posted
10 blocks against the Huskies last
month, Carlson's .184 hitting percent
age was significantly lower than her
season average of .312, making her
less of a priority than usual.
Carlson and Perry rank eighth and
ninth in the Pac-10 in points earned
per set, making Washington the only
team in the conference to have two
players in the top 10. Perry picked up
24.5 points with 24 kills in the loss to
Stanford at Maples last month. How
ever, Stanford's Klineman leads the
conference in this statistic, bringing in
an average of 6.26 points per set for
the Card. The senior put up 32 kills

against the Huskies at Maples in the
first half of conference play.
The match should yield a battle at
the net, with Stanford posting the
highest hitting percentage in the na
tion at .319 and Washington posting
the lowest opponent hitting percent
age in the Pac-10 at .158.
Wopat said that the Card would
emphasize "putting up a solid block
and getting touches, so Gabi [Ailes]
can dig everything that gets by."
Ailes and Husky libera Jenna Or
landi both put up digging averages in
the conference's top three.
"The end game," Wopat added, "is
to out-pass-and-serve them."
Stanford will take on the Cougars
this Friday at 7 p.m. in Pullman, before
traveling to Seattle the next day to
face the Huskies at 7 p.m.
