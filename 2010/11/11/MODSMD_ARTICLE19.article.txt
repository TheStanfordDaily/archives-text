The No. 2 Stanford women's volleyball team (20-2,11-2
Pac-10) will embark on its longest road trip of the season this
weekend as it heads north to take on the Washington State
Cougars (6-16,0-12) and the No. 11 Washington Huskies (18-
5,7-5) on Friday and Saturday. The Cardinal approaches the
weekend fresh off a pair of wins in Maples Pavilion last week
end that allowed the team to reclaim a tie atop the conference
standings with No. 4 California (21-2,11-2).
Three returning All-American seniors have contributed
significantly to the Cardinal's success thus far. Outside hitter
Alix Klineman, libero Gabi Ailes and setter/opposite Cassidy
Lichtman have led the Card to the top of the Pac-10 in both
hitting percentage and assists per set, as well as second in digs
per set.
The Card has been able to better utilize Lichtman as both
a setter and an opposite hitter since the return of sophomore
setter Karissa Cook. After earning her 11th double-double of
the season, Lichtman was recognized as Pac-10 player of the
week for the first time in her Stanford career.
The Cardinal seniors will enter Bohler Gym in Pullman
this Friday to take on the Cougars for the last time this season.
