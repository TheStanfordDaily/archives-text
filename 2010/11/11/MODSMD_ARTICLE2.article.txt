# Crusader against sex trafficking speaks
## Former victim discusses experiences, current work 
### MARIANNE LEVINE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
On Wednesday, Somaly Mam, one of Time
magazine's 100 most influential people, spoke
out at the Women's Community Center against
human sex trafficking, drawing on personal ex
perience as well as a lifetime spent combating
the practice's spread.
At a young age, Somaly Mam was sold into
sexual slavery by a man pretending to be her
grandfather. After witnessing the murder of her
best friend, Mam escaped the brothel. In 1996,
she established the Cambodian non-profit or
ganization Agir Pour les Femmes en Situation
Precaire (AFESIP), dedicated to saving young
girls sold into sexual slavery. The victims range in
age from 4 to 12, and the organization has res
cued more than 6,000 young women since its
founding.
In 2007, the Somaly Mam Foundation was es
tablished by two Americans to advocate for the
victims of sexual trafficking and allow their voic
es to be heard in the world community.
Viviana Arcia 'l3, the chair of women's issues
for ASSU and one of the event's organizers, says
Mam understands the importance of the sur
vivor's perspective.
"She's a representative of victim-centered
activism ... that is, letting survivors choose their

own path and method of healing,
which sadly many activists working
with abused women do not do," Arcia
said. "They [the survivors] are the ex
perts, they are the only ones that truly
understand their situation and Mam
is conscious of the fact that these girls
need to be viewed and treated as au
tonomous people who have agency."
The event began with the perform
ance of the traditional Cambodian
blessing dance. The five dancers were
victims of sex trafficking, and began
to cry as they recounted their difficult
pasts.
"I am happy to meet you all. I
never thought today was possible,"
said one performer through a transla
tor. "I look at you like brothers and
sisters that care about me. I have a fa-

ther that is despicable and I was sold
by my own sister so I never felt love,"
Sex trafficking is not limited to
Cambodia. Bill Livermore, the CEO
and the executive director of the So
maly Mam Foundation, spoke on the
global nature of the problem.
"The UN estimates 12.5 million
slaves in the world today," he said,
adding that 17,000 people are traf
ficked into the U.S. every year.
"This is a problem of historical
proportions," he said. "It's devastat
ing. $32 billion is made in slavery. It is
the second most profitable crime

after drugs."
Livermore described the two main
functions of the Somaly Mam Foun
dation: empowering survivors and en
suring that a strict rule of law is en
forced.
The Somaly Mam Foundation
helps to fund shelters throughout
Cambodia and encourages victim re
habilitation through dance therapy.
The Voices for Change program,
one program of the Foundation in
which survivors help counsel recent
victims, has also been successful. Ac
cording to Livermore, the program

has encouraged more women in
brothels to seek assistance. Intake
rates at Cambodian shelters have in
creased from 60 percent to 90 percent
within the past two years. Mam said
the victims gain a sense of solidarity
that helps them recover.
"What I needed when I was young
was a mother," Mam said. "But I did
n't have a mother. My life started bad.
It's like all of their lives. We had been
born without parents, without love.
We were born in very bad luck."
The Somaly Mam Foundation en
courages its members to voice their
opinions about the center.
"I always believe the idea comes
from the center," Mam said. "Every
year we have the girls get together.
They tell us what they want the center
to do. They are not soft at all. Empow
er the survivor. Don't start tomorrow.
Start now."
