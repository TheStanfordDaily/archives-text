# Be wary of the letdown
## 
### Jacob Jaffe Fields of Failure 
Woo! We just won a big
game over a top-X
team. Everyone's
talking about us, and
we're all the way up
to No. Y in the polls! If we win out and
ABC happens, we'll go to the Z Bowl.
Go us! After last week, how could we
possibly be challenged by a team like
Q? They're nowhere near as good as
the team we just beat!
Ever heard something to that effect
(with the possible replacement of actu
al numbers and words for the letters)?
The number of different teams every
year that fit this mold is astounding, and
the reason so many different teams
have these moments is that they are
often followed by massive letdowns.
Take South Carolina, for example.
The Gamecocks hosted what nearly
everyone believed to be the best team
in the country, then-No. 1 Alabama, in
early October with College Game Day
on hand and the nation watching. The
"other" USC came up with a huge two
touchdown win, catapulting it from No.
19 to No. 10 in the polls and bringing
thoughts of an SEC title to Columbia,
S.C. A road trip to Lexington the fol
lowing week to take on Kentucky, los
ers of three straight, appeared to be just
the next step in one of the Gamecocks'
best seasons.
Until they lost.
All the momentum from that big
win, all the plans for glory, all the hype
and media attention were gone in the
blink of an eye. South Carolina is back
to having a pretty good season, current
ly sitting at No. 23 with a chance to win
the pathetic SEC East on Saturday at
Florida. But the Gamecocks could
never match the euphoria from that big
win, nor could they match the agony of
the following defeat.
This is the way of college football.
Missouri beat then-No. 1 Oklahoma at
home and jumped up to No. 6 in the
BCS and No. 4 in the computers with a
chance to go undefeated the Tigers
then followed up their high with two
lows, dropping their next two games on
the road, falling to No. 21. Arizona had
to escape Cal at home with a fourth
quarter bomb the week after beating
then-No. 9 lowa. Those same
Hawkeyes nearly lost to lowly Indiana
this past weekend after blowing out
previously unbeaten Michigan State.
The list goes on and on. The fact is,
it's hard to come back from a big victo
ry and win again the next week, partic
ularly on the road.
Why do I bring this up? Well, as you
might have heard, Stanford blew out
then-No. 15 Arizona on Saturday in a
primetime game on national television.
You might have heard that Stanford is
all the way up to No. 6 in the BCS stand
ings and has a very legitimate claim as
the best one-loss team in the country.
And chances are, you've heard the sce
narios that could lead to Stanford play
ing in the Rose Bowl if it wins out.
What you likely have not heard or
cared as much about is that the Cardi
nal has a game this weekend. And just
like every other game in college foot
ball, it's not a gimme (if you don't be
lieve me, watch the highlights of James
Madison-Virginia Tech, and look at
where both teams are now).
Stanford is playing Arizona State
this Saturday, and the timing seems to
favor the Cardinal. While Stanford is
riding the wave of momentum from the
Arizona win, the Sun Devils are trying
to recuperate from a heartbreaking
one-point loss at USC.
Arizona State is 4-5, with half its
wins coming against FCS opponents.
Its only Pac-10 victories are against the
Washington schools, and it is among the
worst teams in the country in turnover
margin. The Sun Devils rank fifth or
worse in the Pac-10 in 12 of the 17
major statistical categories.
On the other hand, Stanford has
one of the best offenses in the country.
The Cardinal is fifth nationally in scor
ing, seventh in passing efficiency and
tied for second in fewest sacks allowed.
Stanford has the best third-down con
version rate, the highest time of posses
sion and the most red zone opportuni
ties and conversions in the country.
And it has a better defense in yards al
lowed and points allowed than ASU.
So Stanford has this one in the bag,
right? In a word, no. Oddsmakers set
the betting line for this game at only

seven, and it has since gone down to
five. That's right, the sixth-best team in
the country is supposed to win by less
than a touchdown against a sub-,500
team that hasn't been to a bowl game
since 2007.

The Cardinal will have to play in
Sun Devil Stadium, and as South Car
olina and Missouri can attest, road
games are not always kind to the new
kids on the block. Stanford has not won
inTempe since 1999, and the Sun Dev
ils will be entirely motivated to keep
that streak alive. Arizona State needs
to win out in order to assure itself of a
bowl game, and it figures to be eager to

erase last week's loss.
Winning out should not be on Stan
ford's mind. True, every media outlet
that mentions the Cardinal is talking
about the chances it could be left out of
a BCS bowl. But the decision will be
moot if Stanford can't win this week,
and history shows that's no guarantee.
"Taking it one game at a time" might
be the most overused clich? in history,
but it gets said so often for a reason.
Of course, the Cardinal could an
nounce itself to the rest of the country as
a legitimate contender and blast the Sun
Devils as the stats say it should on its way
to an 11- or 12-win season. But this one
still has "trap game" written all over it.
