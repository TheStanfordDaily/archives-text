## Stanford looks to extend winning streak 
### DASH DAVIDSON KABIR SAWHNEY 
On Friday night, the No. 4 Stanford men's water
polo team will look to continue a five-game win
ning streak when it battles No. 13 UC-Davis, be
fore taking on No. 7 Pacific on Sunday.
The first game will take place at Schaal Aquat
ics Center at 6 p.m. So far this year, the Cardinal is
1-1 in Friday night contests, losing a squeaker to
No. 3 UCLA on Oct. 15 and dominating No. 11
Santa Clara on Oct. 29.
Stanford (12-5,5-1 MPSF) will certainly not be
happy to, once again, be leaving Avery Aquatic
Center and heading on the road its last 13 home

games have all ended in victory for the Cardinal,
although due to odd scheduling, a mere three
home contests have taken place this season.
UC-Davis, a member of the Western Water
Polo Association (WWPA),has had a very success
ful season to date. The Aggies (15-8,12-IWWPA)
are currently sitting pretty in second place of the
WWPA standings.
The Aggies had a tough game this past week
end, suffering their first league loss, 6-1, to No. 9
Loyola Marymount. With this loss, Davis lost its
perfect record in the league as well as its hold on
first place. The squad will be looking to rebound in
a big way against Stanford.

On offense the Aggies are led by a couple of
prolific goal scorers: junior Aaron Salit, who has
netted a whopping 43 goals, and senior Cory Lyle,
who has scored 31 times. The Aggie defense is sta
bilized by junior Kevin Peat, who has accumulated
186 saves on the year, to the tune of 10.6 per game.
Stanford will look to play spoiler in Friday's fes
tivities, and it hopes to keep the wave of momen
tum that it has accumulated in its recent stretch of
inspired play alive.
Friday marks the 12th and final out-of-confer
ence game for Stanford this season so far, the
