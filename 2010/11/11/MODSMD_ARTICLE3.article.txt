## Happiness increases with age New study says older people have more joy 
### DANA EDWARDS 
The stereotype of the grouchy
old-timer may be a thing of the past.
People become happier as they
get older, according to an Oct. 25 ar
ticle in the journal Psychology and
Aging detailing the results of a 10-
year study led by a Stanford profes
sor.
Laura Carstensen, psychology
professor and director of the Stan
ford Center on Longevity, led the
study, which was co-authored by
postdoctoral fellows Bulent Turan
Ph.D. 'O9, Susanne Scheibe and re
searchers from other universities.
The study collected data over 10
years in order to examine the fluctu
ating levels of happiness in individu
als as they aged a decade.
"There is a lot of evidence sug
gesting that as people get older, they
get more positive emotionally, but
none of it is conclusive," Turan said.
"This is the first study examining the
issue in a longitudinal assay."
The study included 184 Bay Area

participants, ranging from ages 18 to
94. The subjects were carefully se
lected to represent a wide variety of
ages, education levels, ethnicities and
socioeconomic statuses.

"We took great pains to make it
very representative of the Bay
Area," said Hal Ersner-Herschfield
Ph.D. 'O9, another co-author.
The subjects were asked to carry
pagers for one week every five years
once at the beginning of the study,
once at the five-year mark, and once
at the 10-year mark.
"We paged them randomly, five
times a day, and every time they were
paged they had to rate their emo
tions on a scale of one to seven."
Turan said. "We looked at the aver
age of all the positive and negative
emotions, not the intensity but the
frequency. We subtracted the fre
quency of positive emotions from
the frequency of negative emotions.
Then we looked to see if, as people
got older, their positive emotional
frequency got higher."
The researchers employed the ex
perience-sampling method (ESM),
which they argue produces more ac
curate results than asking partici
pants to generalize about their emo
tional health.

"Compare, for example, the dif-

ferent types of information that indi
viduals draw upon to answer the fol
lowing questions," the authors wrote,
"(a) 'How much anger do you feel at
this moment ?' and (b) 'To what de
gree are you an angry person?' In the
former, the respondent draws on im
mediate feeling states. The latter de
mands an averaging of emotional
tendencies and a comparison of
those tendencies to what he or she
expects is typical of other people."
The researchers found that, on
average, the people became more

positive over the course of 10 years.
The study was not meant to iden
tify the causes of this increased hap
piness, said Carstensen, but she
points to other research that sug
gests a growing sense of mortality
may change a person's perspective
on life.

"This particular study doesn't ad
dress 'why?'" Carstensen wrote in an
e-mail to The Daily. "It simply de
scribes changes in emotional lives
over time. Other experimental re
search in our laboratory, however,
suggests that time horizons influence
experience. Paradoxically perhaps,
longer time horizons are associated
with greater angst than shorter ones,
and of course time horizons shrink
with age."

"The reason people get more pos
itive as they get older is expressed
well by the socio-emotional selectiv
ity theory," Turan said, referring to a
theory developed by Carstensen.
"When you see that you don't have
much life left, you change your prior
ities. You're more interested in emo
tional well-being rather than life
goals you may have previously had."
The author suggested that these
findings might contradict popular
opinion.

"Young people are regularly told,
'These are the best years in life,"'
Carstensen said. "Emotionally
speaking, that's simply not so."
