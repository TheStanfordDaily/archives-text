## GSC discusses VSO funding, new bus routes 
### KATHLEEN CHAYKOWSKI DESK EDITOR 
The Graduate Student Council (GSC) con
sidered three requests for funding, discussed
budget concerns regarding the funding of Vol
untary Student Organizations (VSOs) and an
nounced updates on current student program
ming at Wednesday night's meeting.
Co-chair and medical student Jessica Tsai

began the meeting by thanking council mem
bers for organizing last weekend's council re
treat. A primary topic at the retreat was the
state of the council's funding for VSOs, accord
ing to Tsai.
Fourth-year genetics student and deputy
funding chair Erik Lehnert said that the coun
cil has decreased its reserve amount "to basi
cally what we want to contain it at... so there
might be a time in April when we say, 'OK,

close shop. We're done funding here.'"
"I recommend having these conversations
with every group that comes," he added, saying
the council will need to consider whether or
not it will continue to fund full dinners at guest
speaker events.
Engineers for a Sustainable World and the
Hong Kong Student Association were award-
ed $1,200 and $5BO respectively for
upcoming events. Voting on the Chi
nese Women Collective at Stanford
(CWCS) request for $175 to host a
workshop with a Chinese makeup
artist is being postponed until next
week until more information is
known about the qualifications of the
artist.
The council confirmed that the
CWCS could spend the $l6O it had
previously been awarded to cover the
cost of food at a skin-care event at
Stanford Shopping Center. The
CWCS had expressed concerns that
the funds could not be used because
the Shopping Center is not technically
part of Stanford campus, but the GSC
voted to permit the use of funds be
cause, in the words of Lehnert, the
Shopping Center is "still Stanford
owned property."
Ward Thomas, transportation oper
ations supervisor at Stanford Parking
and Transportation Services (P&TS),

presented the Marguerite route
changes proposed for early 2011 and
discussed the proposal with council
members.
The changes are projected to re
duce fuel consumption by 30,000 gal
lons and distance traveled by 10,000
miles over one year, with expected im
plementation around Jan. 19, Thomas
said.
Thomas emphasized that the
changes are not only an attempt to cut
spending, but also to reduce route re
dundancy and congestion. The
changes would alter 11 of the current
15 routes, and most would be minor, al
though more extensive changes are
planned for the A line, B line, C line,
Midnight Express and Shopping Ex
press routes.
Raj Bhandari M.S. 'lO, the CEO of
Stanford Student Enterprises, report
ed on construction progress of the new
ASSU Student Store. The new outfit
will be in Tresidder Student Union at
the former site of the Ticket Office,
"The Jan. 3 deadline may be de
layed a little because of flooring is
sues," Bhandari said.
He said the store still plans to hold
its annual Thanksgiving Sale.

Kelsei Wharton 'l2, ASSU vice
president, reminded the council about
events on campus related to Domestic
Violence Awareness Month. He also
discussed ways student government
could increase Red Zone support at
men's and women's basketball games,
possibly through raffles or class com
petitions.
Mary Van der Hoven, doctoral stu
dent in earth sciences and the council's
Thanksgiving coordinator, announced
the menu for graduate students'
Turkey Day. Van der Hoven said gravy,
pumpkin pie and stuffing will all be
homemade and wine will be offered to
graduate students. Volunteers will be
needed to assist with carding and dis
tributing wristbands, she said.
Tsai closed the meeting by encour
aging council members to participate
in the "Rivals for Life" blood drive, to
which 24 graduate students donated
blood last year.
An ASSU joint legislative meeting
is scheduled for Nov. 30, and the last
meeting of winter quarter is set for
Dec. 1.
