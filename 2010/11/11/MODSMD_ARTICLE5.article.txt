## Early-action apps see 7 percent rise Early process likely to become more competitive; says admission chief 
### BRANDON POWELL 
The Office of Admission is reviewing applica
tions for admission that were submitted under
the restrictive early action program, whose dead
line was Nov. 1.
Bob Patterson, director of admission, said the
office has received approximately 5,950 applica
tions under the early-action program, a 7 percent
increase from last year.
Despite the increase in applicants, Patterson
said the number of acceptances would remain
roughly the same as last year, when 760 offers of
admission were given to early applicants.
"Universities and colleges are continuing to
see an increase in application^]... but we're not
seeing an increase in enrollment," Patterson said.
"With an increased applicant pool and the same
class size, it's going to be a little more competi
tive."
The restrictive early-action process is a means
by which college applicants can apply to Stanford
before the normal Jan. 1 deadline and find out
their admission status in mid-December. Appli
cants are either accepted, rejected or deferred.
Those accepted have until May 1 to respond to
the admission offer.
"We encourage students to apply if they know
Stanford is their first choice," Patterson said. "We
also encourage students to apply if they feel pre
pared and ready to submit their application."
There is no disadvantage to applying early,
and the only advantage would be finding out the
decision earlier, Patterson said.
"If we're going to admit a student in restric
tive early action, we would admit the same stu
dent in regular decision," Patterson said.
In reference to deferrals when a student's
admission decision is postponed to the regular
decision round Patterson said
the admission office usually prefers
to give students an answer right
away.
"We defer students when we
want to see additional information
from them and when we want to
look at them in the context of the
entire applicant pool," Patterson
said, "but our philosophy is that we
want to let as many as we can know
our final decision."
Matt Lopez 'l4 was admitted
under restrictive early action last
year and expressed gratification for
that aspect of the admission
process.
"REA is a great way to attract
students that are eager and inter
ested in Stanford without scaring
them away with the commitment of
having to enroll if they get in,"
Lopez said. "For me, it was a great
relief to find out that I was admit
ted so early, and it gave me all the
more reason to choose to enroll
here."
