A dean at the Stanford School of Medicine has received a
grant from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to re
search why few women attain professorships in medicine.
Hannah Valantine, professor and senior associate dean for
diversity and leadership in the School of Medicine, was
awarded the NIH grant to conduct a study exploring the caus
es and possible solutions for the low numbers of women be
coming full professors.
Women represent 50 percent of graduates from medical
schools and about 45 percent of assistant professors in the
field of academic medicine. But only 18 percent of full profes
sors are women.
"I've addressed many of the structural issues that limit the
advancement of women in academic careers, including issues
around work-life balance and the collision of the biological
time clock with the academic time clock," Valantine said.
"But recently my attention and interest have begun to be fo
cused on the psychological factors that come into play."
The $2 million grant, one of six NIH Director's Pathfinder
Awards bestowed this August, aims to promote diversity in
the scientific workforce. It will enable Valantine and her team
to conduct a variety of experiments over the course of three
years, focusing especially on the phenomenon known as the
"stereotype threat" a concept pioneered by Claude
Steele, a former Stanford professor and how it affects
women faculty in the medical field.
