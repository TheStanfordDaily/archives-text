## Grant to address low numbers of female med profs Stanford researcher will examine why few women attain professorships 
### WILLA BROCK 
A dean at the Stanford School of Medicine has received a
grant from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to re
search why few women attain professorships in medicine.
Hannah Valantine, professor and senior associate dean for
diversity and leadership in the School of Medicine, was
awarded the NIH grant to conduct a study exploring the caus
es and possible solutions for the low numbers of women be
coming full professors.
Women represent 50 percent of graduates from medical
schools and about 45 percent of assistant professors in the
field of academic medicine. But only 18 percent of full profes
sors are women.
"I've addressed many of the structural issues that limit the
advancement of women in academic careers, including issues
around work-life balance and the collision of the biological
time clock with the academic time clock," Valantine said.
"But recently my attention and interest have begun to be fo
cused on the psychological factors that come into play."
The $2 million grant, one of six NIH Director's Pathfinder
Awards bestowed this August, aims to promote diversity in
the scientific workforce. It will enable Valantine and her team
to conduct a variety of experiments over the course of three
years, focusing especially on the phenomenon known as the
"stereotype threat" a concept pioneered by Claude
Steele, a former Stanford professor and how it affects
women faculty in the medical field.
Steele's studies have shown that if
a person is reminded of a negative
stereotype associated with a group
they belong to before performing a
task, their ability to succeed at the
task decreases.
"Very specific pathways in the
brain are activated as a consequence
of this feeling of fear, of succumbing
to this negative stereotype associat
ed with your identity group," Valan
tine said. "The anxiety areas of the
brain are activated, and the areas
that are responsible for spatial cog
nitive function are diminished, so
that the performance actually comes
out worse."
The goal of Valantine's study is to
identify the situations that may trig
ger this stereotype threat in women
faculty, and then to design interven
tions to address them. Co-investiga
tor and pediatrics professor Christy
Sandborg expects one of the triggers
is a sense of isolation.
"You see the majority of men in
leadership, and you say, 'Well, I

don't belong here,"' she said. "And
if it's hard, you're thinking you're
not succeeding because you don't
belong."
A possible intervention to ad
dress this insecurity, she said, would
be to invite members in leadership
positions from different back
grounds to speak to assistant profes
sors about the hardships they too en
countered while building their ca
reers.
"It normalizes that feeling of iso
lation and not belonging," Sandborg
said, "and says that it's not because
you're a woman or a man or any
thing, it's just because everybody
feels that way."
The results of the study will ap
pear in three stages: the first based
on qualitative data from the test sub
jects such as questionnaires and
diary entries; the second on more
long-term effects, such as the num
ber of grants received and number of
promotions to leadership positions;
and the third on any change in reten
tion rates over next five years of
women faculty in medical academia.
Valantine's immediate team in
cludes eight people from many dif
ferent departments.
"We're taking a multidisciplinary

approach to the issue that requires
psychologists, sociologists, psychia
trists, neuro-imaging specialists, epi
demiologists and people who are
skilled at programming for career
and faculty development," she said.
The team epidemiologist and
medicine professor, Marilyn Winkle
by, believes it is important to discov
er the root causes of this loss of
women in medicine.
"It's especially concerning at the
academic research institutions like
Stanford and the Ivy Leagues, be
cause, in essence, you're losing some
of the brightest and most talented
women," she said. "And if the U.S. is
really going to maintain its competi
tiveness in science and medicine, you
need these women."
Above all, Sandborg says, the
study is intended to enact real
change within professorial ranks.
"I hope that we actually will be
able to design relatively straightfor
ward interventions that we then can
deploy pretty easily to actually im
prove the way things are," Sandborg
said. "We're going to use this, if it
works."
