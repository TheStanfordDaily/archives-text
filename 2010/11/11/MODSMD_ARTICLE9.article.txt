## With KaeMe, no orphan left behind

r r -W" -you're told that your child can
/ have the opportunity to go to a
V private boarding school run by
someone who appears wealthy,"
A said John Stevens. "It's no charge
until he's 18 if you sign one piece of paper it
turns out that this paper is a consent for adoption. I
think that is a literal kidnapping."
Stevens and two other Stanford entrepreneurs
have built the organization KaeMe which means
"remember me" in the Ghanaian dialect of Twi
to help Ghana's government reverse practices they
see as egregious in Ghanaian orphanages.
Now, KaeMe is in the midst of its largest re
cruiting effort ever, hoping to accelerate the com
pletion of a database of Ghanaian orphans. They
hope to send three groups totaling 40 volunteers
to Ghana this summer.
Stevens, a Stanford-trained cardiothoracic sur
geon, learned about the state of Ghana's orphan
age system when he and his wife Marci traveled to
Ghana in 2002. With intentions of building an or
phanage of their own, they were instead inspired
by observations of many mismanaged orphanages
and ultimately decided to work with the govern
ment to improve the existing system.

After working for years to improve orphan
ages in the Attawa District, Stevens shared his ex
periences with Quest√üridge founder, Ashoka Fel
low and Rhodes Scholar Michael McCullough
M.D. 'B9.
On partnering with McCullough, Stevens, him
self the founder of multiple for-profit corpora
tions, said, "I realized that Michael had a set of
skills which I woefully lacked and that we could do
far more together than either of us alone."
To Steven's network of government contacts,
McCullough added the expertise of colleague Jen
nifer Miller and the organizational structure of
the nonprofit BeAGoodDoctor.org. McCullough
and Miller cofounded BeAGoodDoctor.org in
order to centralize fundraising and management
for their smaller nonprofits: 5.C.0.P.E., the
Courage Project and clinical internship organiza
tions in Honduras, Nepal and Dharamsala.
Before the two committed to Steven's idea,
Miller led three students on a fact-finding mission.
Officials explained to them that at the time, in
2008, the most immediate problem was miscalcu

lated Western generosity.
"Churches, clubs, governments ... even Cana
dian actresses send money to Ghana to fund their
own orphanages, without understanding the re
sponsibilities of monitoring them," Miller said.
McCullough further described the phenome
non of detrimental generosity.
"If you are an entrepreneurial Ghanaian
working for an orphanage funded by a remote
donor say, a church in Oklahoma and want
to keep this money coming in, you have dangerous
incentives to label children orphans who are not
actually orphans, and [you] will hesitate to find
them homes."
Miller's team surveyed approximately 9 per
cent of the orphanage population and found that
fewer than 50 percent of those children had actu
ally been orphaned. The rest were given up by
poverty-stricken families, often under hollow
promises of schooling, food, clothing and medical
treatment.
"The orphanage where I found my daughter
Perpetua was clearly one of the better orphan

ages," Stevens recalled. "Even then, she was hun
gry every day and was beaten on a regular basis."
The formulation of KaeMe coincided with ef
forts by Ghana's government to take control over
reckless institutions, as well as with an internation
al movement to improve the lives of orphaned
and abandoned children. Ghana's government
passed the Care Reform Initiative in 2006, raising
the country's policy on care, education and reset
tlement of orphans to standards set by UNICEF
and the International Hague Conventions.
"When we went in there and started asking
questions to government officials, they were being
asked the same questions by UNICEF," Stevens
said. "The organizational structure we provided
had answers to these questions."
With these foundations in place, McCullough
and Miller began searching for undergrads who
could carry out the groundwork in Ghana.
"My skill is in finding a group of highly talent
ed, socially conscious and diverse students
people who I know are capable of accomplishing
tasks which usually demand much more age and
experience," McCullough said.
