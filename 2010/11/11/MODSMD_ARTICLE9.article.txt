## With KaeMe, no orphan left behind

r r -W" -you're told that your child can
/ have the opportunity to go to a
V private boarding school run by
someone who appears wealthy,"
A said John Stevens. "It's no charge
until he's 18 if you sign one piece of paper it
turns out that this paper is a consent for adoption. I
think that is a literal kidnapping."
Stevens and two other Stanford entrepreneurs
have built the organization KaeMe which means
"remember me" in the Ghanaian dialect of Twi
to help Ghana's government reverse practices they
see as egregious in Ghanaian orphanages.
Now, KaeMe is in the midst of its largest re
cruiting effort ever, hoping to accelerate the com
pletion of a database of Ghanaian orphans. They
hope to send three groups totaling 40 volunteers
to Ghana this summer.
Stevens, a Stanford-trained cardiothoracic sur
geon, learned about the state of Ghana's orphan
age system when he and his wife Marci traveled to
Ghana in 2002. With intentions of building an or
phanage of their own, they were instead inspired
by observations of many mismanaged orphanages
and ultimately decided to work with the govern
ment to improve the existing system.

After working for years to improve orphan
ages in the Attawa District, Stevens shared his ex
periences with Quest√üridge founder, Ashoka Fel
low and Rhodes Scholar Michael McCullough
M.D. 'B9.
On partnering with McCullough, Stevens, him
self the founder of multiple for-profit corpora
tions, said, "I realized that Michael had a set of
skills which I woefully lacked and that we could do
far more together than either of us alone."
To Steven's network of government contacts,
McCullough added the expertise of colleague Jen
nifer Miller and the organizational structure of
the nonprofit BeAGoodDoctor.org. McCullough
and Miller cofounded BeAGoodDoctor.org in
order to centralize fundraising and management
for their smaller nonprofits: 5.C.0.P.E., the
Courage Project and clinical internship organiza
tions in Honduras, Nepal and Dharamsala.
Before the two committed to Steven's idea,
Miller led three students on a fact-finding mission.
Officials explained to them that at the time, in
2008, the most immediate problem was miscalcu

lated Western generosity.
"Churches, clubs, governments ... even Cana
dian actresses send money to Ghana to fund their
own orphanages, without understanding the re
sponsibilities of monitoring them," Miller said.
McCullough further described the phenome
non of detrimental generosity.
"If you are an entrepreneurial Ghanaian
working for an orphanage funded by a remote
donor say, a church in Oklahoma and want
to keep this money coming in, you have dangerous
incentives to label children orphans who are not
actually orphans, and [you] will hesitate to find
them homes."
Miller's team surveyed approximately 9 per
cent of the orphanage population and found that
fewer than 50 percent of those children had actu
ally been orphaned. The rest were given up by
poverty-stricken families, often under hollow
promises of schooling, food, clothing and medical
treatment.
"The orphanage where I found my daughter
Perpetua was clearly one of the better orphan

ages," Stevens recalled. "Even then, she was hun
gry every day and was beaten on a regular basis."
The formulation of KaeMe coincided with ef
forts by Ghana's government to take control over
reckless institutions, as well as with an internation
al movement to improve the lives of orphaned
and abandoned children. Ghana's government
passed the Care Reform Initiative in 2006, raising
the country's policy on care, education and reset
tlement of orphans to standards set by UNICEF
and the International Hague Conventions.
"When we went in there and started asking
questions to government officials, they were being
asked the same questions by UNICEF," Stevens
said. "The organizational structure we provided
had answers to these questions."
With these foundations in place, McCullough
and Miller began searching for undergrads who
could carry out the groundwork in Ghana.
"My skill is in finding a group of highly talent
ed, socially conscious and diverse students
people who I know are capable of accomplishing
tasks which usually demand much more age and
experience," McCullough said.

One of McCullough's goals is to
expand the role students play in the
organization and to mentor these
students to success in both their im
mediate and greater life goals. In ad
dition to a multitude of Fulbright and
Truman Fellowship winners, four of
KaeMe's previous leaders have gone
on to win Rhodes Scholarships.
"I want our student leaders to
leave with the same momentum in
their own lives as they bring into
leading these projects," McCullough
said.
Last June KaeMe directed eight
students five from Stanford in
gathering medical and familial
records and producing video inter
views of Ghanaian orphans.
"Through the volunteers' work,

we are creating an electronic data
base of the orphans, along with a net
work of people who are becoming
educated about the issues," Stevens
said.
The goal of the electronic data
base is to help Ghana's Department
of Social Welfare (DSW) make in
formed decisions about what should
be done with each of the more than
4,000 children in orphanages, as well
as to assist the DSW with implemen
tation.
To minimize costs to the govern
ment, DSW workers accompany vol
unteers to each orphanage, sharing
the transportation resources funded
by KaeMe. Once there, student vol
unteers collect and record relevant
information from school reports, hos
pital records and caregiver notes.
DSW workers talk to the heads of or
phanages, informing them of new
regulations that must be met to avoid
being shut down. In addition, DSW
workers establish a permanent
means of contact with these orphan
ages.
Workers also conduct a formal, in
formational video interview of each
orphan. Student volunteers follow up
with an informal second interview,
meant to illuminate the personality
of each child.
Volunteers must constantly weigh
their own cultural standards against
their desire to maintain respect for
locals. On one occasion, after wit
nessing a pre-school-aged child in di
apers rubbing himself along the
ground, the group of volunteers de

liberated extensively about whether
or not to inform a caregiver.
Volunteer Faradia Pierre 'l2 re
called another orphan's opinion
"that the child would just get his bot
toms dirty so they might as well give
them to the other children."
"This may offend our sentiments,"
Pierre added, "yet in a relatively poor
country such as Ghana, pragmatism
often reigns."
In spite of struggles, Pierre and
her student colleagues successfully
added more than 600 children from
more than 15 orphanages to the data
base, all in a single summer.
According to Stevens, the current
emphasis on volunteers will shift as
the completion of the database nears.
"We also want to support the or
phans in the transition to a new
home. This means improving schools,
hospitals and community centers."
McCullough hopes that within
five years, KaeMe's efforts will help
the Ghanaian government find fami
lies for the majority of orphans and
reduce the number of orphanages to
40.
"What we are facilitating is for
each individual community to be
self-sufficient and capable of caring
for and finding homes for their or
phans," McCullough said. "Whatever
a child's specific health or education
needs are, they will have people in
place to meet those needs."
The hard work of the volunteers
in Ghana and the commitment by
KaeMe's founders to be more effi
cient, reliable and targeted to the
needs of Ghana's people are helping
bring the organization's goals into
fruition.
Stevens puts it best, saying, "We're
a partner with the government. We're
not coming in as a kind of western
people that know it a11... .we know
that we're ignorant of so many won
derful things that the Ghanaian peo
ple have to offer. Can we solve all the
problems? No way. Can we make a
difference in a lot of kids' lives? For
sure."
