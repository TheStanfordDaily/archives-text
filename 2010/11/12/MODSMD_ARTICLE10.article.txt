Likealittle.com is the new big thing on
the Virtual Stanford Scene. It's an open,
anonymous missed connections forum
for all the people you lock eyes with in a
crowd and lose. (Or maybe hook up with at a
party and forget the name of.) This column is
mostly a defense of the fact that I peruse it.
Occasionally. (Oh come on, I don't need an
other guilty pleasure.)
It's one salve for the crowded but cluttered
campus the school can be, where it's easy to
collide with someone and impossible to get
them to stop and chat, let alone schedule a
date. Every once in a while, it looks like two
people actually do find each other, which is
pretty delightful to witness. There are quite a
few freshmen lusting after RAs, which is al
most always adorable and amusing. And
there's lots of flirting between individuals in
relationships or near-relationships: "We're
playing Starcraft together and I just can't be
lieve how lucky I am!" (More or less equiva
lent to breeding a species of albino shouting
gorilla to summit skyscrapers and bellow
your love to the city below.)
The thing is that there's a surprisingly low
percentage of explicitly creepy, one-sided
crushes. Part of this is due to moderately low
traffic (so far as the Internet goes) and mod
erately good moderating. But there's also a
pretty intense feeling of community. The site
is institutionally and geographically bound
ed, and relatively popular within those con
straints. People you know, in person, whose
opinions you care about, will read the things
that you write here. And even though they
won't know it's you, what you end up posting
will probably be affected by their audience.
The site reeks of community. Strangers
help strangers hook up with friends of friends.
"That guy I danced with at Mausoleum,
with the vest and stuff."
"Like, a shiny vest!"
"Yeah!"
"I don't know his name, but I can find it out
for you: he's my friend's cousin!"
Not a case of distant Internet-stalking.
This is people connecting through people.
Which is pretty ... quaint.
On another occasion, one guy posted
about one girl who looks like some celebrity
and eight more people respond that they
don't know her, but lose their minds whenev-

er she walks by. My first thought: creepy. Ob
jectifying. Ugh. But then I thought, wait,
there's this one person that all these people
swoon over. And there's nothing wrong with
swooning. And its kind of nice to watch them
commune over her beauty. She's a little bit
like our Garota de Ipanema. White Plaza be
comes a Brazilian mercado! (Which makes
me Stan Getz ... What, you can't hear the be
guiling saxophone riffs in this column?)
And last weekend, a friend wrote me,
"Look what I found!" because he saw a post
that could've been about another friend of
mine: the panda on Halloween, "if only I had
some bamboo :(." I wrote back, "Look what I
did!" and posted about another mutual
friend's Halloween costume. (Rather uncon
ventional, is all I'll say.) The Panda wrote me
later that day all excited and directed me to it.
She did it wrong and I ended up at the Ipane
ma post instead. Looked up the celebrity and
decided it was definitely one of her friends.
When we sorted it out, I got to show her the
panda post and take all the credit for my own
contribution. If that doesn't scream commu
nity and by association, a legitimate use of
my time I don't know what does.
It's also great how this makes talking and
thinking about aesthetic features of strangers
a little more normalized. Because I do that.
Occasionally.

Dislike likealittle a lot? Rosie'll listen at

The site reeks of
