# SENSE AND NONSENSE
## What's the Use of the Humanities? 
### Aysha Bagchi 
A couple weeks ago, Cornell Universi
ty President David Skorton made a
call for national support for the hu
manities in light of declining funding and at
tention. I learned about his campaign when I
attended a Faculty Senate meeting last
week, where President Flennessy when
asked by a faculty member whether he
would participate and what he might say
said only that he was aware of the campaign.
I imagine further words from Stanford's
president must ultimately be coming, but I
was a little disappointed to see no passion
bubble forth when the topic arose. So maybe
we really do need to ask ourselves: what's
the use of the humanities?

Let me start with the professional world,
the main focus of humanities skeptics. Here's
where their analysis can go wrong: If we
picked out a specific professional aim and
worked backward to figure out the precise
steps to lead us there, rarely would our an
swer be to read Shakespeare, to research the
historical forces behind the fall of the Ot
toman Empire, to critically evaluate an argu
ment by Nietzsche, When we tie ourselves to
a precise professional objective and lay out
the assembly line to get us there, the human
ities quickly fall by the wayside. But this is not
because they are useless; it is because their
use is hidden when we limit our vision to such
precise targets.

The humanities broaden and deepen in
profound ways because they work on less
predictable, and more foundational, human
capacities: imaginative power, empathy, in
tellectual humility, emotional intelligence,
critical reading, effective writing, employing
analogies to make sense of phenomena, rea
soning outside of strict, systematic models.
Developing these capacities is a daunting
project, but the study of history, literature,
philosophy, art and many other humanities
disciplines mold them inch by inch.
And these capacities are foundational to
everything in our society, both professionally
and in a political community. They are the
way that CEOs become visionaries, that nov

elists develop insight, that warring communi
ties begin to earnestly appreciate the histori
cal narratives that have shaped their differ
ences. Indeed, here we can see that the stark
lines between specialized fields are a bit arti
ficial. Humanistic capacities are involved in
the creativity engineers illustrate when they
move beyond problem sets, the human un
derstanding CS majors show when they de
sign a marketable website, the inference
making and reasoning abilities that are nec
essary at the upper limits of any field of re
search and the passion motivating produc
tive pursuits. The humanities engage these
capacities and experiences head-on. When
combined with the necessary training, they
place students leaps ahead of anyone who is
limited to models and mechanistic thinking.
Yet it can seem pretty silly to seek to jus
tify the humanities by appealing to econom
ic and political concerns, not because the ar
guments are untrue, but because they seem
to desperately devalue the humanities.
When I imagine economic interests, for ex
ample, as being the only legs the humanities
stand on, it is as if universities have em
braced King Lear's description of the aims
of his final years of life, as if we are seeking
(and forgive my dourness) an "unburdened
crawl toward death."

Two of a university's most vital aims today
are relieving physical and social burdens
from the human condition through knowl
edge creation and preparing students for fi
nancially enabled lives. But these aims are
tied to a yet deeper one: of humans attaining
a standard in life in which we have the chance
to live our own versions of the good life.
When we remove burdens through econom
ic and social advancement, we are enlivening
those central yearnings at the heart of the
human experience, giving ourselves a chance
to satisfy them.
To be stirred by the beautiful, to feel ful
fillment through helping another, to open
new windows of fascination, to contribute to
what we know, to live a single moment for its
own sake and reflectively embrace our lives,

to go far beyond an unburdened crawl to
ward death; humanity's truest aims are fo
cused on these kinds of human experiences.
At institutions meant to deepen human un
derstanding of life and contribute to the
world, how can we forget the disciplines that
aim at enriching our human experience?
Robert Musil once described the soul as
"that which sneaks off at the mention of alge
braic series." The humanities at least go be
yond those series, seeking to remind us that
the subjective human experience survives
alongside objective models of behavior and
phenomena. In this sense, one might think of
the humanities as the soul of a university, that
which motivates all the rest. Maybe some
parts of the soul are getting too expensive.
But if that is true, we are really in a mess.
