## Knowledge Before Action 
### Nina Papachristou 
Actually, the news from Africa is both
good and bad.The good news is, there
are enough people who care about
conflicts on the continent for there to have
been a pretty heated debate this week be
tween John Prendergast of the Enough Pro
ject and Ugandan journalist Angelo Izama.
The bad news is, there will always be a differ
ence in views between Western NGOs who
believe in the power of popular movements
to make a difference in conflict situations
and the people living in and with the conflicts
who want to make sure their opinions are in
corporated into the resolution.
Well, whatever. Not many people were at
this debate, and even fewer people were
probably able to follow the two panelists'
back-and-forth on international NGO poli
tics, a field constantly facing ethical and tech
nical challenges, as well-intentioned, sympa
thetic people try to effect positive change in
places where they will always be outsiders.
What does this mean for Stanford stu
dents? As members of a university communi
ty, we are in a prime activism position, be
cause a) most of us are newly exposed to a
world beyond our hometown, state, or coun
try and b) there are multiple opportunities
for us to get involved, from petition-writing
to awareness-raising.
But, Izama asks, are any of the noble ven
tures that members of American popular
movements undertake, such as ending trade
in conflict minerals, actually making a differ
ence? Are they, in fact, harming the efforts of
locals to develop their own solutions to com
plicated political and socioeconomic issues
that foreigners will never completely under
stand? For example, when campaigners
across the U.S. and the Western world call for

sanctions on Zimbabwe's government be
cause of political uncertainty, is this really
helping the people of Zimbabwe achieve
transparent governance? Might it not precip
itate a further collapse of an economy whose
inflation reached 89 percent in 2008?
This debate can never be resolved, be
cause as of now, a tool for quantitatively
measuring how political or military conflicts
are resolved hasn't appeared on the market.
We can't know for sure whether divestment
campaigns on American campuses in the
1980s really did help end apartheid in South
Africa, or whether pressure from Western
policymakers on the trade in blood diamonds
was the primary factor in ending Liberia's
civil war in 2003. What we do know for sure,
as Eritrean/Kenyan HiyabelTewoldemedhin
'll put forth so eloquently in reflecting on
the debate, is that "advocacy groups can be
helpful in bringing attention to a specific
issue, but their priorities should not necessar
ily automatically become the priorities of
such a powerful entity as the U.S. govern
ment." In other words, the role of NGOs is to
promote awareness about a certain issue,
leaving the policymaking up to the policy
makers.

So what do we, as young activists eager to
feel that we are doing something that makes
a "difference" (a vague term I hesitate to use)
in the world, do to ensure that we achieve
positive change without subscribing to an
oversimplified view of multifaceted political
issues? We stop and think. If it were you and
your friends conscripted into the Lord's Re
sistance Army in northern Uganda, or lying
on the ground in Eastern Congo after being
gang-raped by your own country's army,
you'd want the people offering you help to be

as informed as possible of your situation and
its causes before they decide on a solution to
your plight. Before you donate that $lO or
two hours of your time to send a Kenyan girl
to school, or to provide mosquito nets to
Nigerians, let's hope you've done a little re
search on traditional education systems in
British-ruled colonies such as Kenya, or the
implications of climate on malaria epidemics.
As Hiyabel pointed out to me, "Stanford
teaches us to question everything we hear"
and that should include what we hear
about foreign conflicts, which deserve the
same barrage of pointless pontificating by
pundits, historical research by academics and
in-depth analysis by those of us who enjoy
debating the efficiency of NGO interven
tions, as our own domestic issues.
