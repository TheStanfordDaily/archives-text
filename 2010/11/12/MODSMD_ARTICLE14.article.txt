### IVY NGUYEN DESK EDITOR 
This report covers a selection of incidents from
Nov. 5 to Nov. 8, as recorded in the Stanford Depart
ment of Public Safety Bulletin.
FRIDAY, NOV. 5
■ At 12:00 p.m., the Department of Public Safety dis
covered a possible unreported sexual assault which
occurred sometime on Nov. 1 at an unknown loca
tion in one of the Row house dormitories.
■At 12:20 a.m. a suspect was arrested in the Main
Quad, transported to San Jose Main Jail and
booked for public intoxication and criminal threats.
■ A person at Arrillaga Alumni Center reported that
someone sent a suspicious letter to a professor in re
sponse to an alumni solicitation for donations. Sud
denly, working a job in fundraising and develop
ment seems less appealing.

SATURDAY, NOV. 6

unlocked bike was stolen from the front of 132 Run
ning Farm Ln.
■ Between 5:22 p.m. and 5:40 p.m., two people were
involved in a dispute at Stanford Stadium. Neither
party requested a citizen's arrest, eventually replac
ing their anger with the joy of Cardinal victory.
■ At 7:14 p.m., a stolen vehicle was recovered at Theta
Delta Chi. Authorities also reportedly found a flan
nel shirt in the back seat, closing the case.
■ At 11:03 p.m., an unknown male called in a possible
rape under the influence of drugs in the room next
to him. The call originated from Cedro in Wilbur
Hall and was thought to be a hoax.
MONDAY, NOV. 8
■ Between 4 p.m. Nov. 7, and 9 a.m. Nov 8, an un
locked bike was stolen from the bike racks outside
of Terra. Lock, n. a mechanism for keeping a door,
lid, etc., fastened, typically operated only by a key of
a particular form. Try one today!
