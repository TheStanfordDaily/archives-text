# STUDENT LIFE
## $500K project surveys students 
### CASSANDRA FELICIANO DESK EDITOR 
Last week, e-mail requests from
Ira Friedman, director of the Vaden
Health Center, hit student inboxes,
asking students to answer a question
naire on relationship abuse on cam
pus. The survey, which has more than
50 questions and enters participants
into a raffle to win an iPad, is part of a
SSOOK project initiated three years
ago.
The grant, from the U.S. Depart
ment of Justice, marks the second
round of funding devoted to this col
laborative effort between the Univer
sity's Health Promotion Services
(HPS) and the Center for Relation
ship Abuse Awareness (CRAA), a
Palo Alto-based nonprofit. The first
cycle, which lasted two years, ended in
2008 and amounted to $300,000.
Both phases sought to achieve the
same three goals, said HPS director
Carole Pertofsky, who also supervises
the partnership response, training
and education.
Several steps have already been
taken to accomplish the first two
goals. Strong ties with YWCA have
been established, giving victims ac
cess to a campus office and a 24/7 hot
line as they decide how to approach
the situation.

"Students have complete control,"
Pertofsky said. "They decide whether
to proceed and file a Judicial Affairs
charge or even file a criminal charge."
The partnership has also garnered
an army of students to join the fight
against sexual violence, including 20

student interns at CRAA to help with
outreach efforts at dorms and Greek
houses as well as a number of student
organizations like Men Against
Abuse Now (MAAN).
"I wasn't here before the grant,"
said CRAA intern and two-year
MAAN president Ted Westling 'l2.
"But from what I heard, there wasn't
as much open and thoughtful discus
sions about it. There weren't as many
projects or supporting victims of vio
lence."
MAAN, a 12-member all-male
group, meets weekly to discuss issues
and facilitates student education ef
forts by putting on events like film
screenings and panels.
This is not to say that education
was completely non-existent on cam
pus HPS addresses these issues in
"The Real World: Stanford," a student
production performed during New
Student Orientation. But there's
much more that can be done, Pertof
sky explained.
"We also realize that we don't real
ly know, we don't have good data on
what are the beliefs and attitudes in
terms of the general student body
about sexual violence," she said.
Most of the statistics that HPS uses
comes from national averages, which,
according to Pertofsky, is not always
exemplary of campus culture because
Stanford represents a very sophisti
cated demographic. She noted that
many students are already committed
to ending sexual violence, citing the
high attendance at "Take Back the
Night," the annual candlelight proces
sion in the spring.

"I think what we really need to do
is to understand where to target our
education efforts," Pertofsky added.
"So that we're not talking to students
about issues they're already aware of
but hitting on what's important to
[them]. The purpose of the survey is to
really get a very detailed understand
ing of what our campus needs are in
terms of education."
One of the attitudes that the part
nership is working to change involves
tendencies to first question what the
victim of sexual violence has done to
provoke the perpetrator. A large part
of the education endeavors is to "stop
asking that as the first question, and
start asking: he made a choice, how is
he made accountable for committing
a crime," Pertofsky said.
But it doesn't end there. Trans
forming the cultural norms of such a
large community takes time, which is
why a second round of funding was
needed.
"There are a number [of cases] re
ported to the Stanford Police every
year," Westling said. "Only about 40
percent of sexual assaults are ever re
ported so there are probably far more
happening than we have documenta
tion of."
Pertofsky said HPS and CRAA are
looking into establishing additional
resources, details of which are yet to
be disclosed. But she confirms that, al
though she doesn't have exact num
bers, the survey has been receiving the
desired response rate.
