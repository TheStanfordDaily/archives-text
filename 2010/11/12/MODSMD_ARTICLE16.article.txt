## Christen Press: A Cardinal icon 
### BROOKE DAVIS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
If you blink, you just might lose sight of the ball somewhere
between Christen Press's foot and the back of the net. The
senior forward is Stanford's leading scorer, and is known to
be able to fire a shot from nearly anywhere on her oppo
nent's half and test the keeper.
"My favorite shot is a side volley that goes really low," said
Press, the nation's leading scorer. "But I rarely do that in games,
just practice."
She may not take her favorite strike as much as she'd like to,
but that hasn't kept Press from pocketing ball after ball this sea
son.
It's no surprise that Press was named Pac-10 player of the year,
as she has truly left her mark this season with 23 goals and seven
assists to her name. Press receives praise from awards, teammates
and coaches alike, but puts most of the pressure on herself instead
of feeling it from outside sources.
"I think it's safe to say that most of it comes from within," she
said. "The pressure is more just because I want to win and I want
to be successful."
Press's insatiable drive began before coming to Stanford, as a re
sult of years of competitive play and the people she met along the
way.
"I have a fitness coach, Ed Daniels, from my club who was
truly an inspiration to me." Press said in an e-mail to The Daily.
"He has a unique lifestyle that opened my eyes to the real world
of fitness. He taught me that I always have more energy and that
I can always get better, that I should never be satisfied. Those last
words are definitely something I carry with me all the time."
Press's parents echo her intensity and remain enthusiastic sup
porters of her soccer career. Even though her parents never
played the game themselves, they caught the contagious soccer
fever.
"My parents are pretty unique soccer parents," Press said.
"They never played, but as soon as I took to the sport, they be
came the biggest soccer fans in America. Not just of women's col
lege soccer, but at every level. My mom is constantly sending me
You Tube videos of her favorite European players."
Press's parents are also ultimate fans of their daughter's soc
cer career, and more than a few of her big moments can be found
on You Tube.
"My parents scream their heads off at every game, and only the
Lord knows that they are never satisfied," Press added. "All this
is to say that my parents have had an extremely significant impact

on where I am today, from inspiration to pressure, they pick me
up when I am down and are the reality check when I am up."
Although she has now made a name for herself, not only on the
Stanford campus, but in the nation as well, Press had to work her
way up to the top, which is always a daunting experience.
"My freshman year was a notably tough time, as transitioning
was extremely difficult for me," Press said.
So how did a maladjusted freshman evolve into the team
leader she is today? Press knew she wanted a challenge not only
in soccer, but also in her life in general as well. "I always say col
lege is what you make of it," Press said. "I chose Stanford because
it was a place that made the resources available to me to have a
great career here and could push me in all aspects of my life,"
As time passed, Press became a comfortable member of a team
with high goals that matched her own.
"I found my place on the team through connecting with the girls
on the same dream to win a national championship," she said.
Last year, the Card lost in the finals of the NCAA Tournament
to North Carolina by just one goal. Instead of letting the loss get
to them, the players turned to their inner drive and kept their
eyes on the prize.
"Because of that loss," Press said, "my team and myself go
above and beyond the call of duty to ensure that we are in the po
sition to give our best effort."
She never loses sight of her ultimate goal, which she's worked
for since her start.
"All of my dreams have come true here, except for the one that
