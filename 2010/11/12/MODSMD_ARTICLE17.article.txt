## No.1 Card kicks off postseason 
### NATE ADAMS DESK EDITOR 
After cruising through the 2010 season without
dropping a single contest, it's never been more im
portant for Stanford to keep that streak alive. The
Cardinal (18-0-2, 9-0 Pac-10) enters the NCAA
Tournament on the heels of its second consecutive
perfect Pac-10 season and stands as the unani
mous No. 1 team in the country. One of four top
seeds in the 64-team field, Stanford will play host
to the opening two rounds this weekend.
Stanford kicks off the tournament on Friday at
7 p.m., taking on the 16th-seeded Sacramento
State Hornets (9-9-1). The winner of that match
will survive to play on Sunday afternoon against
either Santa Clara (12-6-2) or Long Beach State
(14-5-2), who face each other at Laird Q. Cagan
Stadium on Friday at 4:30 p.m.
The Cardinal is no stranger to the NCAA
Tournament. The team is making its 13th consec
utive appearance in the Big Dance and has ad
vanced past the first round in each of its past four
tries. In its two most recent appearances, it got
much further than that, reaching the Final Four
before being eliminated in 2008, the team lost
in the semifinals to Notre Dame, and last season
the Cardinal dropped a 1-0 heartbreaker in the
title game to North Carolina after entering the
match with a perfect record.
While there's always a certain amount of frus
tration that goes along with coming so close to a
championship only to fall short at the finish, Stan
ford head coach Paul Ratcliffe says the experience
from those near-misses is invaluable.
"It certainly gives you added confidence, that
you've been through the experience before and
you know what to expect," Ratcliffe
said. "But it still takes looking at it
game by game. You need to look at
each game and play your hardest and
put out a good effort."
Rather than any specific advice,
Ratcliffe says the biggest inspiration
the younger players are taking from
their experienced teammates is their
attitude in postseason practice.
"It's really just their intensity in
preparation," he said. "We've trained
hard this week and the team is looking
sharp, and for me it's just that intensity
that the younger players can learn
from them."
Among the freshmen learning
from the team's postseason veterans is
goalkeeper Emily Oliver. With six
shutouts and the nation's third-best
goals-against average at 0.299, she has
been a key part of Stanford's success
and has earned her place as the team's
go-to starter in lieu of senior Kira
Maker. In her most recent outing,
Oliver shut out Oregon State to seal a
share of the Pac-10 title.
"Emily had a fantastic perform
ance against Oregon State, which was
one of our stronger opponents, so she
really separated herself that she's the
best goalkeeper for me right now,"
Ratcliffe said. "But in saying that, if
there are any concerns, Kira filled in
on Senior Day [against Oregon] and
had a fantastic performance as well, so

we really have a luxury right now in
that we have some really good goal
keepers."
Ratcliffe may be happy with his
keepers on the defensive side, but
Stanford's most prominent player this
season is no doubt on offense. Senior
forward Christen Press enters the
tournament leading the nation in
points per game (2.65), goals (23) and
total points (53). With 39 assists, she's
also just one away from Stanford's all
time record of 40, set by Marcie Ward
in 2004. In recognition of her incredible
season, Press was named the Pac-10
player of the year earlier this week. In
the same release, the conference also
named Ratcliffe as the Pac-10 coach of
the year for the third consecutive sea
son.
As the Cardinal's first opponent in
the tournament, the Hornets are riding
high after defeating top-seeded North
ern Arizona, 1-0, to win the Big Sky
Conference Tournament. Senior for
ward Leah Larot, a San Jose native,
leads Sacramento State's offense with
10 goals and 21 points as her team
heads for the second NCAA Tourna
ment appearance in program history.
"Sacramento State is a good team,"
Ratcliffe said. "The key is that we have
to jump out on them early and be ag
gressive, but I don't expect to blow
them out. It's a game that we'll have to
earn the victory and prove that we're
the better team.
The Hornets' last appearance in the
NCAAs came in 2007, when they also
played the Cardinal in the first round.
Stanford won the game handily, defeat
ing Sacramento State 7-0.

This year's Stanford squad has ex
perience against other teams in the
tournament as well. The Cardinal has
played 13 of the 64 teams in the tourna
ment field this season, going a com
bined 11-0-2. The two draws came
against Boston College and North Car
olina, a pair of teams that were in the
top five at the time.
After watching the Broncos and
49ers square off at 4:30 p.m., Stanford
will open up its postseason run against
Sacramento State at 7 p.m. tonight.The
winners of the doubleheader will then
face each other on Sunday at 1 p.m. All
games will take place at Laird Q.
Cagan Stadium.
