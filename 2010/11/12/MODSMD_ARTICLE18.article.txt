## Cross country set for NCAA Regionals 
### 
Fresh off the Pac-10 Champi
onships two weeks ago, the Stanford
men's and women's cross country
teams will continue down the home
stretch on Saturday as they head to
Eugene, Ore. for the NCAA West
Regional. The ultimate goal of the
meet will be qualification for the
NCAA Championships, which are
scheduled for Nov. 22 in Terre Haute,
Ind.
The men's team will rely on the
veteran trio of Elliott Heath, Jake
Riley and Chris Derrick again in Eu
gene. The runners took the top three
spots at the Pac-10 8,000-meter title
race.
Despite its strong showing at Pac
10s, the men's team fell from the No.
1 overall ranking in the nation. Stan
ford is now ranked second behind
Oklahoma State, which won the Big
12 title on Oct. 30.
Meanwhile, the success of the
women's team against the confer
ence's best was recognized in the
rankings, as the Card shot up from
No. 9 to No. 4. Sophomore Kathy
Kroeger will again lead the Stanford
women as they try to shore up quali
fication for the NCAA Champi
onships.
