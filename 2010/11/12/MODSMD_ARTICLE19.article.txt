In an early start to conference
competition, the Stanford wrestling
team (0-1) will head to Bakersfield,
Calif., for its first Pac-10 dual against
Cal State Bakersfield on Saturday.
Ail-American Nick
Amuchastegui will headline the Car
dinal this weekend. The redshirt jun
ior placed fourth at last year's
NCAA Tournament and won a
major decision in Stanford's opening
dual at home against Northwestern.
Amuchastegui, senior Zack Giesen
and sophomore Ryan Mango are all
currently ranked in the top 20 na
tionally in their respective weight
classes.
Stanford's last outing, in front of
a big crowd at Burnham Pavilion,
ended in disappointment for the
Cardinal as it fell to Northwestern,
18-16.Though the teams evenly split
the matches, the Wildcats won three
major decisions to Stanford's one,
giving it two extra points that ulti
mately formed the winning margin.
This weekend's dual represents
the season opener for the Roadrun
ners. Bakersfield is in its first season
under new head coach Mike Men
doza.
Stanford and Cal State Bakers
field will open Pac-10 play this Satur
day. The meet is scheduled for 4 p.m.
on Saturday in Bakersfield.
