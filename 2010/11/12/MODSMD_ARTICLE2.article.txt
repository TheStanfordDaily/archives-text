# Bitter end in Berkeley
## Card defeated in season's final game 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
On a sunny afternoon in Berke
ley, Stanford battled back from an
early 1-0 deficit to tie the score be
fore halftime, but after losing a play
er to a red card, the shorthanded
squad couldn't hold off a strong Cal
ifornia side in the final game of the
regular season. The No. 8 Golden
Bears (12-2-3,8-1-1 Pac-10) scored a
pair of goals after Stanford goal
keeper Jason Dodson was ejected
halfway through the second half and
won the match, 3-2.
Stanford (8-10-0,4-6-0) scored in
the final minute of regulation, but
couldn't overcome two outstanding
goals from little-used Cal substitute
Alec Sundly.
Early on, Stanford was clearly the
stronger team, and had several ex
cellent chances in the first half. Red
shirt junior midfielder Garrett Gun
ther had a chance in the 22nd
minute, but his left-footed volley
went wide.
Minutes later, senior forward Do
minique Yahyavi was stopped by
diving Bear goalkeeper David Bing
ham. The junior saved the Bears all
match long, making several difficult
stops and totaling 10 saves in all.
Head coach Bret Simon was very
impressed with Bingham's play.
"David played great, he really
kept them in the game," he said.
But Cal cashed in on its first good
opportunity of the half when a nifty
piece of footwork by Cal's Chris Or
tega on the sideline resulted in a cor
ner kick. A twisting ball off the set
piece was met by the unmarked
freshman Sundly, who sent a header
past the helpless Dodson for his first
career goal.
The large crowd of 2,415 thought
its team might have secured the
game there, as the Golden Bear de
fense had only allowed just five
goals in nine Pac-10 games, but the
Cardinal offense just had to get into
gear.
With seven minutes to go in the
half, Cal couldn't clear a Stanford
corner kick and the ball bounced to
redshirt junior Taylor Amman. The
forward found his sophomore coun
terpart Adam Jahn, who promptly
blasted the ball into the far corner
from 20 yards for his third goal of the
year and the equalizer.
It looked like the game might be
heading for overtime, which would
have made it six overtime games in
row for Cal, as both teams settled in
during the second half. But in the
68th minute, a seemingly innocuous
counterattack turned deadly when
Tommy Ryan couldn't catch up to a
beautifully played through ball for
Cal. Dodson was forced off his line
and slammed into the onrushing for
ward Davis Paul without attempting

GAME NOTES: After entering training camp
ranked at No. 13, the Cardinal ended a
somewhat disappointing season with a loss in
Berkeley yesterday. Despite a solid outing
against the Bears, the Cardinal was forced to
play shorthanded for much of the match due
to a red card to its goalkeeper, and was un
able to equalize the score. The team will try to
recover for next season, in which seven
starters and 24 total players are due to return.
