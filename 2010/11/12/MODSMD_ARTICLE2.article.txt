# Bitter end in Berkeley
## Card defeated in season's final game 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
On a sunny afternoon in Berke
ley, Stanford battled back from an
early 1-0 deficit to tie the score be
fore halftime, but after losing a play
er to a red card, the shorthanded
squad couldn't hold off a strong Cal
ifornia side in the final game of the
regular season. The No. 8 Golden
Bears (12-2-3,8-1-1 Pac-10) scored a
pair of goals after Stanford goal
keeper Jason Dodson was ejected
halfway through the second half and
won the match, 3-2.
Stanford (8-10-0,4-6-0) scored in
the final minute of regulation, but
couldn't overcome two outstanding
goals from little-used Cal substitute
Alec Sundly.
Early on, Stanford was clearly the
stronger team, and had several ex
cellent chances in the first half. Red
shirt junior midfielder Garrett Gun
ther had a chance in the 22nd
minute, but his left-footed volley
went wide.
Minutes later, senior forward Do
minique Yahyavi was stopped by
diving Bear goalkeeper David Bing
ham. The junior saved the Bears all
match long, making several difficult
stops and totaling 10 saves in all.
Head coach Bret Simon was very
impressed with Bingham's play.
"David played great, he really
kept them in the game," he said.
But Cal cashed in on its first good
opportunity of the half when a nifty
piece of footwork by Cal's Chris Or
tega on the sideline resulted in a cor
ner kick. A twisting ball off the set
piece was met by the unmarked
freshman Sundly, who sent a header
past the helpless Dodson for his first
career goal.
The large crowd of 2,415 thought
its team might have secured the
game there, as the Golden Bear de
fense had only allowed just five
goals in nine Pac-10 games, but the
Cardinal offense just had to get into
gear.
With seven minutes to go in the
half, Cal couldn't clear a Stanford
corner kick and the ball bounced to
redshirt junior Taylor Amman. The
forward found his sophomore coun
terpart Adam Jahn, who promptly
blasted the ball into the far corner
from 20 yards for his third goal of the
year and the equalizer.
It looked like the game might be
heading for overtime, which would
have made it six overtime games in
row for Cal, as both teams settled in
during the second half. But in the
68th minute, a seemingly innocuous
counterattack turned deadly when
Tommy Ryan couldn't catch up to a
beautifully played through ball for
Cal. Dodson was forced off his line
and slammed into the onrushing for
ward Davis Paul without attempting

GAME NOTES: After entering training camp
ranked at No. 13, the Cardinal ended a
somewhat disappointing season with a loss in
Berkeley yesterday. Despite a solid outing
against the Bears, the Cardinal was forced to
play shorthanded for much of the match due
to a red card to its goalkeeper, and was un
able to equalize the score. The team will try to
recover for next season, in which seven
starters and 24 total players are due to return.

to play the ball. He was immediately
given a red card and ejected from the
game.
The visibly upset keeper left the
field and had to be replaced by red
shirt freshman Galen Perkins. But
more inopportune for the Cardinal
was having to play with 10 men after
the ejection. Senior Daniel Leon
came off the field for Stanford and
Perkins saved the ensuing free kick,
but the damage was done.
The Cardinal was on its heels, and
five minutes later Cal won a corner
kick. Servando Carrasco made the
most of it, sending his headed shot off
the post and in past Perkins.
With just a few minutes left in the
second half, Stanford was pressing and
looking for another equalizer, but hav
ing to play with 10 men was taking its
toll on the players. Cal took advantage
when a set of passes left Sundly open
again from 25 yards. He didn't miss,
and Perkins had no chance to stop the
screaming shot into the top corner.
Just like that, it was 3-1, but the
Cardinal wasn't finished yet.
Desperately sending men forward
with a minute to play, Stanford won a
throw-in on the near sideline, and sen
ior defender Ryan Thomas sent a
deep ball into the box. After bouncing

around off several players, fellow sen
ior defender Bobby Warshaw's bicy
cle attempt failed, but the ricochet
found Cameron Lamming. The senior
defender managed to find a small bit
of free space and capitalized with his
first goal of the year.
But it was too little too late, as Cal
held on for the narrow victory and
wrapped up its third Pac-10 champi
onship in program history.
"Who would have thought it? Sund
ly scored some great goals, and con
gratulations to him and Cal," Simon
said. "I thought we played well enough
to win today, but we were a man short,
and we were pressing to get another
goal. It was just very difficult."
With an 8-10-0 overall record,
Stanford is all but eliminated from
contention for an at-large berth into
the NCAA Tournament.
The loss was a difficult end to a
tough season for the Cardinal, which
came into camp as the No. 13 team in
the country but lost four straight and
couldn't quite recover. The team will
return seven starters and 24 players
next year, as it tries to regain its foot
ing in the brutal Pac-10.

match long, making several difficult
stops and totaling 10 saves in all.
Head coach Bret Simon was very
impressed with Bingham's play.
"David played great, he really
kept them in the game," he said.
But Cal cashed in on its first good
opportunity of the half when a nifty
piece of footwork by Cal's Chris Or
tega on the sideline resulted in a cor
ner kick. A twisting ball off the set
piece was met by the unmarked
freshman Sundly, who sent a header
past the helpless Dodson for his first
career goal.
The large crowd of 2,415 thought
its team might have secured the
game there, as the Golden Bear de
fense had only allowed just five
goals in nine Pac-10 games, but the
Cardinal offense just had to get into
gear.
With seven minutes to go in the
half, Cal couldn't clear a Stanford
corner kick and the ball bounced to
redshirt junior Taylor Amman. The
forward found his sophomore coun
terpart Adam Jahn, who promptly
blasted the ball into the far corner
from 20 yards for his third goal of the
year and the equalizer.
It looked like the game might be
heading for overtime, which would
have made it six overtime games in
row for Cal, as both teams settled in
during the second half. But in the
68th minute, a seemingly innocuous
counterattack turned deadly when
Tommy Ryan couldn't catch up to a
beautifully played through ball for
Cal. Dodson was forced off his line

GAME NOTES: After entering training camp
ranked at No. 13, the Cardinal ended a
somewhat disappointing season with a loss in
Berkeley yesterday. Despite a solid outing
against the Bears, the Cardinal was forced to
play shorthanded for much of the match due
to a red card to its goalkeeper, and was un
able to equalize the score. The team will try to
recover for next season, in which seven
starters and 24 total players are due to return.

to play the ball. He was immediately
given a red card and ejected from the
game.
The visibly upset keeper left the
field and had to be replaced by red
shirt freshman Galen Perkins. But
more inopportune for the Cardinal
was having to play with 10 men after
the ejection. Senior Daniel Leon
came off the field for Stanford and
Perkins saved the ensuing free kick,
but the damage was done.
The Cardinal was on its heels, and
five minutes later Cal won a corner
kick. Servando Carrasco made the
most of it, sending his headed shot off
the post and in past Perkins.
With just a few minutes left in the
second half, Stanford was pressing and
looking for another equalizer, but hav
ing to play with 10 men was taking its
toll on the players. Cal took advantage
when a set of passes left Sundly open
again from 25 yards. He didn't miss,
and Perkins had no chance to stop the
screaming shot into the top corner.
Just like that, it was 3-1, but the
Cardinal wasn't finished yet.
Desperately sending men forward
with a minute to play, Stanford won a
throw-in on the near sideline, and sen
ior defender Ryan Thomas sent a
deep ball into the box. After bouncing

around off several players, fellow sen
ior defender Bobby Warshaw's bicy
cle attempt failed, but the ricochet
found Cameron Lamming. The senior
defender managed to find a small bit
of free space and capitalized with his
first goal of the year.
But it was too little too late, as Cal
held on for the narrow victory and
wrapped up its third Pac-10 champi
onship in program history.
"Who would have thought it? Sund
ly scored some great goals, and con
gratulations to him and Cal," Simon
said. "I thought we played well enough
to win today, but we were a man short,
and we were pressing to get another
goal. It was just very difficult."
With an 8-10-0 overall record,
Stanford is all but eliminated from
contention for an at-large berth into
the NCAA Tournament.
The loss was a difficult end to a
tough season for the Cardinal, which
came into camp as the No. 13 team in
the country but lost four straight and
couldn't quite recover. The team will
return seven starters and 24 players
next year, as it tries to regain its foot
ing in the brutal Pac-10.

Backup keeper Galen Perkins, above, did everything he could to keep
Stanford's hopes alive against Cal last night as he replaced starter
Jason Dodson after a second-half red card. The shorthanded Cardinal couldn't keep pace with the No. 8 Golden Bears, however, ultimately falling by a score of 3-2 in the team's final contest of 2010.
