# MEN'S BASKETBALL
## Card looks to turn heads 
### ZACH ZIMMERMAN DESK EDITOR 
In his third season as head coach
of Stanford men's basketball, head
coach Johnny Dawkins is attempting
to defy the odds and accomplish a
very overdue goal bringing
Maples Pavilion, and Cardinal bas
ketball, back to life.
Stanford has gone without an
NCAA Tournament appearance
since 2008, a season that ended with
a devastating loss to Texas in the
Sweet 16 and the departure of two
campus icons, the 7-foot twins Brook
and Robin Lopez, along with head
coach Trent Johnson. Now, one year
removed from any postseason com
petition (the Card earned a CBI
berth in 2009), the Cardinal will rely
on just a handful of returning players
and a slew of promising freshmen in
hopes of making March memorable
again.
Leading the team this year will be
junior shooting guard Jeremy
Green. Playing second fiddle to
then-senior and current NBA starter
Landry Fields, Green quietly aver
aged 16.6 points and 3.8 rebounds

per game and earned a place on the
All-Pac-10 second team. However,
he hit just 38 percent of his field
goals, a number that will undoubted
ly need to rise if the Cardinal hopes
to succeed.

Center Jack Trotter and point
guard Jarrett Mann, also juniors, join
Green as the team's only returning
starters. Trotter, while still over
matched against strong and skilled
post men, played with far greater
comfort and confidence than was
present in his freshman year. He fin
ished the season averaging seven
points and 4.5 rebounds per game,
and was second to Fields in total
blocks.
Mann, meanwhile, continued to
struggle with his shot, but grew into
his role as a facilitator and was
among the conference's leaders in
assists per game with 4.5. However,
he averaged nearly one turnover for
every assist and will need to work on
his decision-making and jump shot
in order to play a key role in the
starting rotation.

Fans from 2008 will see a familiar
face in the lineup this year, as junior
and fan favorite Josh Owens makes

his comeback after missing all of last
season with an undisclosed heart ail
ment. Owens will provide much
needed frontcourt depth and athleti
cism, and despite the inevitable rust
that comes with injury, he should re
ceive serious playing time at the
power forward position.
Junior Andrew Zimmermann,
who is entering his second year in
Cardinal red after transferring from
Santa Clara, will share these min
utes. He is regarded highly by
Dawkins, and has been named a
team captain alongside Green and
Owens. Zimmermann is a gritty
player that thrives as a rebounder
and post-defender, but is continuing
to develop an outside game.
Stanford's returners will un
doubtedly need to step their game
up a notch for the Card to make it
out of the Pac-10 cellar, but perhaps
the most important component of
this year's squad is the top-20 re
cruiting class that Dawkins lured to
the Farm.
The freshman bunch, ranked No.
16 by Rivals, spans four positions
and should make an immediate im
pact.

Dwight Powell, a 6-foot-ll Cana
dian import, leads the group. The
power forward is a highly touted re
cruit whose highlight reel has had
Stanford fans eagerly awaiting his ar
rival. He has the ability to play as a
traditional four with his knack for
scoring in the low post. He also excels

Junior Jack Trotter, one of three
returning starters for the Card this
season, showed a lot of growth last
year as he posted seven points and
4.5 assists per game.
