# MEN'S BASKETBALL
## Card looks to turn heads 
### ZACH ZIMMERMAN DESK EDITOR 
In his third season as head coach
of Stanford men's basketball, head
coach Johnny Dawkins is attempting
to defy the odds and accomplish a
very overdue goal bringing
Maples Pavilion, and Cardinal bas
ketball, back to life.
Stanford has gone without an
NCAA Tournament appearance
since 2008, a season that ended with
a devastating loss to Texas in the
Sweet 16 and the departure of two
campus icons, the 7-foot twins Brook
and Robin Lopez, along with head
coach Trent Johnson. Now, one year
removed from any postseason com
petition (the Card earned a CBI
berth in 2009), the Cardinal will rely
on just a handful of returning players
and a slew of promising freshmen in
hopes of making March memorable
again.
Leading the team this year will be
junior shooting guard Jeremy
Green. Playing second fiddle to
then-senior and current NBA starter
Landry Fields, Green quietly aver
aged 16.6 points and 3.8 rebounds

per game and earned a place on the
All-Pac-10 second team. However,
he hit just 38 percent of his field
goals, a number that will undoubted
ly need to rise if the Cardinal hopes
to succeed.

Center Jack Trotter and point
guard Jarrett Mann, also juniors, join
Green as the team's only returning
starters. Trotter, while still over
matched against strong and skilled
post men, played with far greater
comfort and confidence than was
present in his freshman year. He fin
ished the season averaging seven
points and 4.5 rebounds per game,
and was second to Fields in total
blocks.
Mann, meanwhile, continued to
struggle with his shot, but grew into
his role as a facilitator and was
among the conference's leaders in
assists per game with 4.5. However,
he averaged nearly one turnover for
every assist and will need to work on
his decision-making and jump shot
in order to play a key role in the
starting rotation.

Fans from 2008 will see a familiar
face in the lineup this year, as junior
and fan favorite Josh Owens makes

his comeback after missing all of last
season with an undisclosed heart ail
ment. Owens will provide much
needed frontcourt depth and athleti
cism, and despite the inevitable rust
that comes with injury, he should re
ceive serious playing time at the
power forward position.
Junior Andrew Zimmermann,
who is entering his second year in
Cardinal red after transferring from
Santa Clara, will share these min
utes. He is regarded highly by
Dawkins, and has been named a
team captain alongside Green and
Owens. Zimmermann is a gritty
player that thrives as a rebounder
and post-defender, but is continuing
to develop an outside game.
Stanford's returners will un
doubtedly need to step their game
up a notch for the Card to make it
out of the Pac-10 cellar, but perhaps
the most important component of
this year's squad is the top-20 re
cruiting class that Dawkins lured to
the Farm.
The freshman bunch, ranked No.
16 by Rivals, spans four positions
and should make an immediate im
pact.

Dwight Powell, a 6-foot-ll Cana
dian import, leads the group. The
power forward is a highly touted re
cruit whose highlight reel has had
Stanford fans eagerly awaiting his ar
rival. He has the ability to play as a
traditional four with his knack for
scoring in the low post. He also excels

returning starters for the Card this
season, showed a lot of growth last
year as he posted seven points and
4.5 assists per game.
on the perimeter with rare three
point shooting and passing ability. At
just 215 pounds, he'll need to bulk up
to prevent himself from becoming a
defensive liability. However, he
should still see action in a shallow
frontcourt that is begging for play
makers.
Anthony Brown is the other
ESPN 150 name that could make an
instant impact. Although incredibly
young, the 6-foot-6 small forward
from Huntington Beach, Calif., in
stantly becomes one of Stanford's
best perimeter players, and may start
from opening day. His jump shot ri
vals that of any player on the team,
and he is an above-average passer.
While replacing Fields' contribution
at the position is hard to imagine,
Brown could quickly become the
next Cardinal star and fill the void.

Power forwards John Gage and
Josh Huestis and center Stefan Nas
tic bring unique skill sets as big men.
All three have notable midrange
games and will help stretch the floor
with their length and touch. That
said, both Gage and Nastic are still
very raw, and will need to develop
strength on the defensive end before
seeing significant playing time.
Huestis is a bit of a sleeper after
obliterating the competition during
summer camps and tournaments be
fore his senior season. He is the two
time Gatorade Player of the Year in
Montana, and was dominant in high
school. However, at just 6-foot-7, he
doesn't have the body of a true four,
and may find trouble in the post
against bigger opponents. Keep an
eye on how Dawkins handles the
Huestis situation and expect him to
switch between the three and four
throughout the season.
Rounding out the list of new play
ers is 5-foot-ll Aaron Bright. De
scribed as a true point guard, Bright
brings something to the team that
has been missing for years in Stan
ford's floor generals good deci
sion making. Bright has a superb feel
for the game, and is able to pass and
finish with both hands. He's under
sized, but could eventually take over
as the team's primary point guard as
the season progresses.
While no one is questioning the
talent of the freshmen class, the Car
dinal has a difficult task ahead. The
Pac-10 is looking to rebound from an
abysmal season and should see

growth at the top of the conference.
Washington, Arizona and UCLA
all traditional powerhouses
should improve dramatically, while
regular season conference champion
Cal is expected to decline rapidly
after losing much of its talent.
Although the heart of Stanford's
season begins when it opens up Pac
-10 play against Cal on Jan. 2, it will
face a few very difficult tests early in
the year. The team travels to Indi
anapolis on Dec. 18 to take on na
tional runner-up Butler, a team that
almost edged out reigning champion
Duke last April. Just four days later,
the Card heads to Stillwater, Okla. to
face Oklahoma State, a Big 12 pow
erhouse that boasts one of the coun
try's best home-court advantages.
While those games will ultimate
ly gauge Stanford's ability to hang
with the nation's elite, the Cardinal
must instead remained focus on its
season opener against San Diego
this Monday. The Toreros struggled
last season, but diehard basketball
fans may remember their upset over
Connecticut in the 2008 NCAA
Tournament. The Cardinal will need
to bring its best effort in order to
avoid falling into a 0-1 hole after just
one game.
Tipoff for the Nov. 15 game is
scheduled for 7 p.m. at Maples Pavil
ion, where the new-look Cardinal
will take the court for its first regular
season matchup.
