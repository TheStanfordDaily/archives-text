# USA: If you teach us, we will win

It's no secret that U.S. sports have de
signs on world domination. Basket
ball has already had some relative
success, with a world championship
having been played since 1950. The
NFL has recently played in-season games
outside its borders in an attempt to broaden
its fan-base, and I'm sure baseball would
love to inject a bit more world into the
"World Series."
Apart from the simple boost to nation
al pride of your pastime gaining serious re
spect and recognition abroad, there are a lot
of good reasons to want this. It can bring
huge investment to the game both in terms
of money and the raw talent of young for
eign athletes. There might be arguments
against the destabilizing effect of massive
injections of cash into European soccer, but
few fans will bemoan their clubs' acquisi
tion of Latin American skills.
However,before you dive headfirst into
all of this, be careful what you wish for.
Last week the England cricket team ar
rived in Australia to defend the Ashes,
which for fans of the two teams is the most
important international series in the world
game.The strange name of this tournament
dates back to a satirical obituary bemoan
ing the death of English cricket when it first
lost a game on home soil to Australia in
1882, and keeping that theme going, the tro
phy they will be fighting over is a tiny um,
just six inches high, that reputedly contains
the ashes of a cricket bail (the small piece of
wood that sits atop the stumps).
There is, quite predictably, much more
at stake then simply sporting honors be
tween two sides that represent a former
colony and its former colonial power. For
Australia, it represents a chance of revenge
for all the wrongs committed in the past,
while for England, it offers some glimmer of
reliving its former colonial glory.
Despite its much smaller population,
though, Australia has more than held its
own in the history of the Ashes. It holds a
narrow 31-29 lead over England, recently
held the trophy for a 16-year streak (ending
in 2003) and hasn't lost on home soil since
the late 1980s.Evenif has appeared wobbly
in the last few months, it is also easily the
class act in world cricket, holding a winning
record against every other Test nation
(which are basically the best countries in
cricket) and having won the World Cup
four times (including the last three straight).
Cricket seems the quintessential Eng
lish game. Its modem form dates back far
longer than soccer (16th century compared
to 19th century) and, at least to the English,
sparks memories, real or imagined, of
sleepy summer days in country villages.
But that's not really hue any more.
Cricket is no longer an English game. The
most dominant national team is Australia,
the best Test side is India. The biggest and
brightest league is the Indian Premier
League,andlndiaandPakistanaccountfor
over a billion fans. Given recent political ri
valry and even war, games between those
two countries have far more riding on them
than the Ashes.
If U.S. sports ever manage to repeat the
export success of their British counterparts
