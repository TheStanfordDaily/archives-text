# WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
## Title hunt begins After losing in the NCAA final last year, the Card has plenty to aim for in 2010 
### NATE ADAMS DESK EDITOR 
After 10 straight regular season Pac-10 titles and three
consecutive Final Four appearances, the expectations for
this year's Cardinal women couldn't be much higher.
Stanford enters the season ranked at No. 2 and No. 3 in
the AP and coaches' polls, respectively, and was unani
mously voted by Pac-10 coaches as the conference's top
team.
If its first two preseason games are any indication, the
team is on track to impress once again. Stanford routed
Vanguard, 116-65, and UC-San Diego, 100-52, in exhibi
tion play earlier this week, seeing huge contributions
from new and old players alike. The Cardinal will kick off
its regular season at home this Sunday when it takes on
Rutgers at 2 p.m.
The Cardinal boasts 11 returners from last year's na
tional runner-up team, which lost to Connecticut, 53-47, in
the finals. Among the team's veterans are three of last
year's go-to starters, all of whom head coach Tara Van-
Derveer put in the opening lineup in that loss against the
Huskies. Together with the other returning players and
the team's incoming freshmen, they'll have to fill the void
left by the departure of former starters Jayne Appel and
Rosalyn Gold-Onwude. Appel scored 13.2 points per
game last season and is Stanford's all-time leader in re
bounds, while Gold-Onwude was a leader at the point
guard position and boasted 33 percent shooting from be
yond the arc.
"Obviously we had great success last year, and we do
miss all the players that aren't playing this year," Van-
Derveer said. "They left some big shoes to fill, but thank
fully we've got some big feet."
Returner and All-American Nnemkadi Ogwumike led
the team in points per game last season with 18.5 and was
named the Pac-10 player of the year for her efforts. The
junior forward has been limited to just 13 minutes of play
over the team's two exhibition matches due to a sore left
ankle, but managed to go 4-for-4 from the field and pull
down three rebounds.
Joining Ogwumike as returning starters are seniors

Kayla Pedersen and Jeanette Pohlen, both of whom were
named to the All-Pac-10 first team last season. At 6-foot
4, Pedersen is a powerful presence in the forward position,
and has already put up big numbers this season. She
scored a game-high 25 points against Vanguard on 9-for
-13 shooting, including 2-for-2 on three-pointers, before
putting up 13 points in just 20 minutes against UC-San
Diego three days later.
Pohlen, stepping in as the team's most experienced
guard, has had a pair of solid outings as well. She scored a
total of 25 points over 42 minutes in both games, bolstered
by her 5-for-6 shooting for threes. Adding to her contribu
tions in the first two contests, Pohlen posted four assists in
each game.
"I'm really excited with how our team started off with
the exhibition games, and how our team is coming togeth
er," Pohlen said. "We have a lot of different lineups right
now, and I could be playing the two-guard this year a little
bit too, which is nice. We just have a lot of people who are
very versatile. As far as a leadership role, I'm very excited
to step up and show some leadership my senior year."
Eight other members of last year's squad will join the
Cardinal's three returning starters. Among them is red
shirt sophomore Sarah Boothe, who missed all of last sea
son with a foot ailment, but started in both of the team's
exhibition games and scored a total of 24 points in 43 min
utes. Another player to watch is sophomore forward
Joslyn Tinkle, who started against Vanguard and scored a
total of 24 points in 47 minutes across both games, along
with a total of 14 rebounds.
Rounding out the roster for this year's Cardinal is a trio
of talented freshmen. Toni Kokenis, a guard out of Oak
Brook, 111., has already impressed this year with her speed
and athleticism. Against UC-San Diego, she kick-started
the Cardinal offense with a steal and a layup before going
on to post three assists and four points. Guard Sara James,
a California native, posted 16 points in the win against Van
guard, including a 4-for-7 effort from beyond the arc.
Perhaps this year's biggest addition to the Cardinal
roster, however, comes in the form of Chiney Ogwumike.
The younger sibling of Nnemkadi, Chiney has done noth
ing but impress this year, posting a pair of 24-point efforts
in both exhibition contests in a total of 48 minutes. The
guard, a product of Cypress,Tex., like her older sister, also
recorded game highs in rebounds during both games,
with 16 against Vanguard and eight against UC-San
Diego.
With its talented additions and experienced veterans,
including a healthy Boothe, the Cardinal's biggest
strength this season may be its versatility.
"It's really just a puzzle in figuring out what pieces go
together,"VanDerveer said about the depth of her roster.
"It'll just take some time through practice and seeing
how people do in games, and we'll have some big tests re
ally quickly. We have a lot of different options, and we'll
see how different peoples' roles are solidified. Right now
we don't have a completely set starting lineup."
The Cardinal's first regular season matchup will come
this Sunday, when it takes on Rutgers at 2 p.m. The Scar
let Knights hosted Stanford in their home opener last
season, falling 81-66. The team's offense is spearheaded
by redshirt junior Khadijah Rushdan, a preseason All-
Big East honorable mention who led her team in assists
last season with 116 and steals with 56. Rutgers head
coach C. Vivian Stringer is third on the NCAA's list for
most career wins and last year was named to the Naismith
Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, Together with Van-
Derveer, who is fifth on the list, the pair has a combined
1,636 victories.
"We go way back," VanDerveer said of Stringer. "She's
a fabulous coach and an even better person. When we're
not playing them, I'm rooting for her.
The rest of Stanford's nonconference season should
prove to be a tough test, with games scheduled against No.
17 Texas and No. 5 Xavier, before finishing off the calen
dar year at home against No. 1 Connecticut on Dec. 30.
"We have the anti-cupcake schedule," VanDerveer
said. We are playing everybody and anybody. Obviously
Connecticut and Xavier [are tough]. Rutgers is a great
team to start with, and they're an excellent program."
Despite the relentless schedule, VanDerveer is hopeful
that her team will play strong and win over new and old
fans alike this season.

"This is a really exciting time right now for sports, with
the Giants doing so well, our football team doing so well,
and obviously women's volleyball, all the different
sports," she said. "We just want to be part of that. We want
people to come and see our team and say, 'Wow, they're a
special team.'"
Stanford will kick off its regular season against Rutgers
this Sunday. The game is scheduled for 2 p.m. at Maples
Pavilion.

Rutgers at 2 p.m.
The Cardinal boasts 11 returners from last year's na
tional runner-up team, which lost to Connecticut, 53-47, in
the finals. Among the team's veterans are three of last
year's go-to starters, all of whom head coach Tara Van-
Derveer put in the opening lineup in that loss against the
Huskies. Together with the other returning players and
the team's incoming freshmen, they'll have to fill the void
left by the departure of former starters Jayne Appel and
Rosalyn Gold-Onwude. Appel scored 13.2 points per
game last season and is Stanford's all-time leader in re
bounds, while Gold-Onwude was a leader at the point
guard position and boasted 33 percent shooting from be
yond the arc.
"Obviously we had great success last year, and we do
miss all the players that aren't playing this year," Van-
Derveer said. "They left some big shoes to fill, but thank
fully we've got some big feet."
Returner and All-American Nnemkadi Ogwumike led
the team in points per game last season with 18.5 and was
named the Pac-10 player of the year for her efforts. The
junior forward has been limited to just 13 minutes of play
over the team's two exhibition matches due to a sore left
ankle, but managed to go 4-for-4 from the field and pull
down three rebounds.
Joining Ogwumike as returning starters are seniors

Kayla Pedersen and Jeanette Pohlen, both of whom were
named to the All-Pac-10 first team last season. At 6-foot
4, Pedersen is a powerful presence in the forward position,
and has already put up big numbers this season. She
scored a game-high 25 points against Vanguard on 9-for
-13 shooting, including 2-for-2 on three-pointers, before
putting up 13 points in just 20 minutes against UC-San
Diego three days later.
Pohlen, stepping in as the team's most experienced
guard, has had a pair of solid outings as well. She scored a
total of 25 points over 42 minutes in both games, bolstered
by her 5-for-6 shooting for threes. Adding to her contribu
tions in the first two contests, Pohlen posted four assists in
each game.
"I'm really excited with how our team started off with
the exhibition games, and how our team is coming togeth
er," Pohlen said. "We have a lot of different lineups right
now, and I could be playing the two-guard this year a little
bit too, which is nice. We just have a lot of people who are
very versatile. As far as a leadership role, I'm very excited
to step up and show some leadership my senior year."
Eight other members of last year's squad will join the
Cardinal's three returning starters. Among them is red
shirt sophomore Sarah Boothe, who missed all of last sea
son with a foot ailment, but started in both of the team's
exhibition games and scored a total of 24 points in 43 min
utes. Another player to watch is sophomore forward
Joslyn Tinkle, who started against Vanguard and scored a
total of 24 points in 47 minutes across both games, along
with a total of 14 rebounds.
Rounding out the roster for this year's Cardinal is a trio
of talented freshmen. Toni Kokenis, a guard out of Oak
Brook, 111., has already impressed this year with her speed
and athleticism. Against UC-San Diego, she kick-started
the Cardinal offense with a steal and a layup before going
on to post three assists and four points. Guard Sara James,
a California native, posted 16 points in the win against Van
guard, including a 4-for-7 effort from beyond the arc.
Perhaps this year's biggest addition to the Cardinal
roster, however, comes in the form of Chiney Ogwumike.
The younger sibling of Nnemkadi, Chiney has done noth
ing but impress this year, posting a pair of 24-point efforts
in both exhibition contests in a total of 48 minutes. The
guard, a product of Cypress,Tex., like her older sister, also
recorded game highs in rebounds during both games,
with 16 against Vanguard and eight against UC-San
Diego.
With its talented additions and experienced veterans,
including a healthy Boothe, the Cardinal's biggest
strength this season may be its versatility.
"It's really just a puzzle in figuring out what pieces go
together,"VanDerveer said about the depth of her roster.
"It'll just take some time through practice and seeing
how people do in games, and we'll have some big tests re
ally quickly. We have a lot of different options, and we'll
see how different peoples' roles are solidified. Right now
we don't have a completely set starting lineup."
The Cardinal's first regular season matchup will come
this Sunday, when it takes on Rutgers at 2 p.m. The Scar
let Knights hosted Stanford in their home opener last
season, falling 81-66. The team's offense is spearheaded
by redshirt junior Khadijah Rushdan, a preseason All-
Big East honorable mention who led her team in assists
last season with 116 and steals with 56. Rutgers head
coach C. Vivian Stringer is third on the NCAA's list for
most career wins and last year was named to the Naismith
Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, Together with Van-
Derveer, who is fifth on the list, the pair has a combined
1,636 victories.
"We go way back," VanDerveer said of Stringer. "She's
a fabulous coach and an even better person. When we're
not playing them, I'm rooting for her.
The rest of Stanford's nonconference season should
prove to be a tough test, with games scheduled against No.
17 Texas and No. 5 Xavier, before finishing off the calen
dar year at home against No. 1 Connecticut on Dec. 30.
"We have the anti-cupcake schedule," VanDerveer
said. We are playing everybody and anybody. Obviously
Connecticut and Xavier [are tough]. Rutgers is a great
team to start with, and they're an excellent program."
Despite the relentless schedule, VanDerveer is hopeful
that her team will play strong and win over new and old
fans alike this season.

"This is a really exciting time right now for sports, with
the Giants doing so well, our football team doing so well,
and obviously women's volleyball, all the different
sports," she said. "We just want to be part of that. We want
people to come and see our team and say, 'Wow, they're a
special team.'"
Stanford will kick off its regular season against Rutgers
this Sunday. The game is scheduled for 2 p.m. at Maples
Pavilion.

Nnemkadi Ogwumike, No. 30 above, soared above the
competition in her second year with the Cardinal. The junior forward averaged 18.5 points per game last season.
After 10 straight regular season Pac-10 titles and three
consecutive Final Four appearances, the expectations for
this year's Cardinal women couldn't be much higher.
Stanford enters the season ranked at No. 2 and No. 3 in
the AP and coaches' polls, respectively, and was unani
mously voted by Pac-10 coaches as the conference's top
team.
If its first two preseason games are any indication, the
team is on track to impress once again. Stanford routed
Vanguard, 116-65, and UC-San Diego, 100-52, in exhibi
tion play earlier this week, seeing huge contributions
from new and old players alike. The Cardinal will kick off
its regular season at home this Sunday when it takes on
