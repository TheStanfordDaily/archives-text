This year's first "Four Minute
Reading," held in the
Ujamaa lounge on Monday,
was a wonderful opportunity for
developed and developing
Stanford authors to showcase four
minutes of their writing. A crowd
of students, a sprinkling of creative
writing teachers and a few
intrigued passersby snacked on
ample food and drink as they
patiently awaited the performers.
The evening started off
strong, with renowned Spoken
Word poet Jamaica Osorio per
forming first. She originally
planned to read four minutes of
her short story about teen suicides,
but she decided that would be a bit
too depressing. Instead, she per
formed a piece about racial insen
sitivity, with controlled gestures
and flawless intonation. Although
not exactly cheery, her reading
proved intensely captivating and
rendered the audience breathless.
Next up was Samantha Toh
'll, a writer for The Daily, who
read an empowering poem about
self-awareness and acceptance. She
described her physical features,
denying them generic qualities and
gifting them unique beauties.
Then Gabrielle Gulo 'l2 read

some of her short story, a devastat
ing account of a girl learning
about the death of her friend's
mother through a letter. Another
emotionally charged reading, by
Miranda Mammen 'l4, followed,
with a first-person account by a
daughter describing her mother's
appearance after a car accident,
vividly detailing what she imag
ined the wrecked car must have
looked like on the freeway, with its
smashed groceries and responsibil
ities left undone.
In the interest of a good
laugh, or a good dozen laughs,
Claire Woodard 'l2 read a poem
that explored the moans and
groans of next-door neighbors
having acoustically driven sex.
With a reference to John Lennon's
"Come Together," and a climax
detailing the divine lovemaking of
an abbot, Woodard took her seat
with a satisfied audience.
Willys Devoll 'l3 read a snip
pet of his short story about a
crazed writer and his confused
protegee discussing aesthetics and
defecation during lunchtime. It
was a thoughtful and humorous
analysis of the written word and
the dark corners it can lead one
into. Helena Bonde' 11 read a mix

ture of poetry and narrative about
an elf lost and disoriented on an
island, employing beautiful
imagery while showcasing rhyth
mic prowess.
Frank Rodriguez 'l2 gave us a
four-minute glimpse into his short
story, a work based on lack Kirby,
the comic book artist behind
Captain America. His descriptions,
particularly of a loaded and omi
nous gun, were simply gut
wrenching. Chris Rurik'll fol
lowed with a piece that he had
worked on just that day, on the
subway, and a quick excerpt from a
more developed work of fiction.
The event concluded with the
beginning, "The Fall," a poem
about Adam and Eve by fennifer
Schaffer 'l4, also a writer for The
Daily. Her piece created a minia
ture Garden of Eden between two
lovers, suspended in ecstatic love
the morning after, eventually
wrenched back to reality with the
irritating cry of an alarm clock.
And with that, the transcendent
evening came to an end.
