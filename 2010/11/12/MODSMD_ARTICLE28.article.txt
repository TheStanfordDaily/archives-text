## Night out: SOCA Arts Party 
### — jennifer SCHAFFER contact jennifer: jmschaff@stanford. edu 
Saturday night was a seductive
evening for anyone flirting
with the arts scene at
Stanford, as Student Organizing
Committee for the Arts (SOCA)
threw the übiquitously named Arts
Party at Elliott Programming
Center. In a gently lit room that
smelled of boxed wine, artsy types
mingled to the stellar sounds of
some of Stanford's best student
bands. Nimbleweed performed
folksy, acoustic covers of classic
party songs, from AC/DC's "You
Shook Me All Night Long" to Flo
Rida's "Club Can't Even Handle
Me," as students swayed back in
forth holding plastic cups filled
with homemade sangria. On either
side of the room, partygoers got
their hands dirty with art.
At one table, crafty students
eagerly popped open the provided
shaving cream and paints to make
scraps of marbled paper. On the
opposite end of the room stood a
large poster board with a sign that
read "Paint me!" and several took
up the chance to contribute their
brushstrokes to the communal
painting. One girl, dolled up in
dark purple beret, sat before the
painting for half an hour, painstak
ingly adding a Tempera face to the
board. As Nimbleweed closed out
their set and the next band pre
pared for theirs, Vampire Weekend
blasted out of the speakers. The
smartly dressed crowd filled
with girls in vintage dresses and
boys in fashionable shoes collec
tively bobbed their heads to the
beat, and some wandered over to
the snacks table to nibble on cher
ries and slices of brie.
The Elliott Programming
Center, located on Lake Lag, was a
fitting venue for the night, just
large enough for the crowd but
small enough to foster the kind of
intimacy necessary for conversa
tion, with bright white Christmas
lights softly illuminating the log
cabin-esque room. Next up to per
form was well-loved campus band
The Sea People, and the crowd
gathered close as they rocked out to

the fast-paced set. The Sea People's
energy was crazy-high; their gui
tarist whipped his floppy dark hair
and the crowd into a frenzy,
and the lead singer swayed back
and forth as she sang prettily into
the microphone. The pleasure of
their performance was simply con
tagious, and partygoers began to
dance around the room. In one
corner danced a boy in suspenders,
glasses and checkered Vans and
another with sagging pants and a
gold chain; elsewhere, a tall girl in a
vintage dress was spun around by
an equally stylish friend clad in
black. The crowd was a motley
crew and a breath of fresh air from
the homogenous, scantily-clad
masses that tend to dominate
Stanford's Saturday-night social
scene.
After The Sea People's exciting
performance, the evening's coordi
nators shuffled the crowd to one
side of the room, clearing out space
for dance ensemble DVB to per
form a hot routine to a mix of
familiar frat party hip-hop. The
evening then took on a coffeehouse
vibe as dreamy-eyed soloist
Stephen Henderson 'll sang and
strummed an acoustic cover of Jeff
Buckley's haunting "Hallelujah."
The night's closing act was the
always kick-ass duo Sex Ray Vision.
Once again, the crowd went wild,
dancing freely with hearts throb
bing and temples sweating, and
when charismatic rapper Brian Yoo
'll announced they were done, the
crowd begged for one more song. It
was the mark of a killer party no
one wanted it to end. The Arts
Party was a smash success, a color
ful night full of creativity, cool cats
and first-class performances that
left everyone asking for an encore.
