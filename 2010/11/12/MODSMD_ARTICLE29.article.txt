Over-sexed, over the top and over
whelming to the uninitiated, Gaieties is
ready to make its rude (and lewd) jab
at UC-Berkeley. Beginning Wednesday, Nov. 17,
"Gaieties 2010: The Last Temptation of Cal"
promises to top the Dalai Lama, if its trailer is to
be believed.
The posters for this year's show ominously
read, "Blood in the fountains," but otherwise the
plot details have been kept secret, as is custom
ary. But from Intermission's sneak peek of the
show, we can say that "The Last Temptation of
Cal" lives up to its raunchy reputation.
Put on by the Ram's Head Theatrical
Society, the student-written, student-performed
comedic musical dates back to 1911. Known for
its winking insanity and unabashed nudity,
Gaieties has made its bawdy skewering of Cal,

and Stanford itself, a Big Game week tradition.
The plot generally follows some version of bad
Cal seizing, destroying and/or attacking
Stanford, though each year the production tries
to one-up itself in absurdity levels.
Particularly impressive this year is the
comedic timing of the cast, starring Chris Lang
'll, Geffan Pearlson 'l4, Phillip Bowen 'll, Alex
Walker' 13 and Mary Beth Corbett 'l2. The
show is stocked with lines like, "I was taking a
break from IHUM to, you know, save Stanford,"
which land with precise delivery. The question
able accents and physical humor will win
laughs, provided the blink-and-you-may-miss-it
zingers don't get swallowed by Memorial
Auditorium.
Gaieties, however, would be nothing with
out its script (just try and keep a straight face
when one character muses, "That's why my iPad
pussy app was going wonkers."). Gaieties' all
student writing staff of 10, led by head writer
Nick DeWilde 'lO, began writing this year's
show last spring, while producer Rachel Lindee
'l2 and director Emily Goldwyn 'll made their
edits through the summer. As of Tuesday's
rehearsal, lines were still being refined.
As usual, student groups, pop culture and
Stanford quirks provide fodder for Gaieties'
fast-paced dialogue, with Greek organizations
and a cappella groups bearing the brunt of the
jokes this year. The production is one big inside
joke, chock full of references to dining hall food,
freshmen, chat lists, CoHo stink and those

pesky abbreviations. And many of the charac
ters are based on true stories, so if one of those
actors looks familiar on stage, you know why.
The show itself is an exercise in attention
splitting, as often the background hijinks are
funnier than the main action. Rather than a
generic chorus, the performers take on different
campus characters during each scene for hilari
ous results. "Are you nursing? Keep that, I love

that," said director Goldwyn to one pair of
industrious actors during rehearsal.
A show highlight, the requisite ffat party
scene is brilliantly choreographed. It's worth
going to multiple showings just to see what the
entire cast gets up to on stage.
Yes, the show is offensive. Gaieties prides
