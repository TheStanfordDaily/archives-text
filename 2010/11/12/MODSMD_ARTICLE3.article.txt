Maintaining focus and intensity will be a key
theme for the Stanford football team this week, as
it hits the road to face Arizona State.
The No. 6 Cardinal (8-1,5-1 Pac-10) is coming off "l
its biggest win of the season, a 42-17 undressing of '
then-No. 15 Arizona.The victory put Stanford into the
discussion for a possible at-large berth into a BCS bowl
game and catapulted it back into the top 10 in all the
major rankings for the first time since its Oct. 2 loss to
now-No. 1 Oregon.

However, the Sun Devils (4-5,2-4) can be a dangerous
team, and have the good fortune of playing the Cardinal
inside the friendly confines of Sun Devil Stadium. Ari
zona State needs to win out in order to become bowl el
igible, since two of its four victories are over FCS teams
and, per NCAA rules, only one of those wins can count
toward bowl eligibility. Given the Sun Devils' despera
tion, this weekend's matchup could have the makings of
a classic "letdown game" for Stanford.
Stanford head coach Jim Harbaugh believes that,
despite that possibility, his team won't get distracted
and overlook the Sun Devils.
"We're going to come in fired up, too," he said. .
"Both teams are very hungry to win the game, and we '
understand that. We have great respect for Arizona
State and the kind of football team they are. i
They've lost four games by a total of 16 points flk
they could easily be 7-2 or 8-1.
"We have to worry about being exact, being . *
detailed and being ready for this ballgame," he
continued. "Right now we're in that process
getting mentally ready, getting physically ready
and getting our minds right to play."

"We have a saying around here ... you've got an 18 to

NOTES; After standing tall in a 42-1 7 victory
over a formidable Arizona team, the No. 6
Cardinal will head to the desert this weekend
to take on the Wildcats' in-state counterpart.
At 4-5, the Sun Devils are desperate for a win
to keep their bowl hopes alive, while a win for
the Cardinal would do a lot to boost its
chances at earning a nod for a BCS game.

Three of The Daily's football gurus give their takes on Saturday's game

NO. 6 STANFORD

KABIR SAWHNEY
STANFORD 35, ARIZONA STATE 10: Every week, Stanford's offense
has fulfilled and surpassed expectations, scoring points in bunches against the
conference's toughest teams. I fully expect Andrew Luck and the Cardinal to roll up
points against an Arizona State defense that has held only one conference oppo
nent to less than 30 points. On the defensive side, I have consistently discounted
Stanford, only to watch it shut out Washington and throttle Arizona. The Cardinal
defense will continue to play at a high level against Steven Threet and the Sun
Devil offense.

STANFORD 34, ARIZONA STATE 1 :My colleague talked two

days ago about the possibility of a letdown, and if it happens, it will be
this week. Arizona State is a very underrated team, and its record is not
indicative of its talent. The Sun Devils played Oregon better than any

team thus far, and nearly beat a highly touted Wisconsin team. Nonetheless,

Stanford is the better team, and being favored by less than a touchdown is in
sulting. The defense has already withstood its toughest tests, and the offense,
now healthy, is firing on all cylinders. Expect another big day from receiver Chris
Owusu, who should run rampant on Arizona State's secondary.

JACOB JAFFE
STANFORD 40, ARIZONA STATE 24: This is a prime game for the Car
dinal to get upset. Stanford is coming off its biggest win of the season, and now
has to travel to Tempe to take on an underrated Arizona State team. Head coach
Jim Harbaugh won't let that happen, though, and a slow start won't be enough to
derail the Cardinal. Sun Devil quarterback Steven Threet will throw a few more cru
cial interceptions, Andrew Luck will have another Heisman-esque performance
and Stanford will pull away in the second half to keep its BCS hopes alive.
