# HEAT IT UP
## BOWL GAMES ON THE LINE AT ASU 
### KABIR SAWHNEY MANAGING EDITOR 
\
Maintaining focus and intensity will be a key
theme for the Stanford football team this week, as
it hits the road to face Arizona State.
The No. 6 Cardinal (8-1,5-1 Pac-10) is coming off "l
its biggest win of the season, a 42-17 undressing of '
then-No. 15 Arizona.The victory put Stanford into the
discussion for a possible at-large berth into a BCS bowl
game and catapulted it back into the top 10 in all the
major rankings for the first time since its Oct. 2 loss to
now-No. 1 Oregon.

However, the Sun Devils (4-5,2-4) can be a dangerous
team, and have the good fortune of playing the Cardinal
inside the friendly confines of Sun Devil Stadium. Ari
zona State needs to win out in order to become bowl el
igible, since two of its four victories are over FCS teams
and, per NCAA rules, only one of those wins can count
toward bowl eligibility. Given the Sun Devils' despera
tion, this weekend's matchup could have the makings of
a classic "letdown game" for Stanford.
Stanford head coach Jim Harbaugh believes that,
despite that possibility, his team won't get distracted
and overlook the Sun Devils.
"We're going to come in fired up, too," he said. .
"Both teams are very hungry to win the game, and we '
understand that. We have great respect for Arizona
State and the kind of football team they are. i
They've lost four games by a total of 16 points flk
they could easily be 7-2 or 8-1.
"We have to worry about being exact, being . *
detailed and being ready for this ballgame," he
continued. "Right now we're in that process
getting mentally ready, getting physically ready
and getting our minds right to play."

NOTES; After standing tall in a 42-1 7 victory
over a formidable Arizona team, the No. 6
Cardinal will head to the desert this weekend
to take on the Wildcats' in-state counterpart.
At 4-5, the Sun Devils are desperate for a win
to keep their bowl hopes alive, while a win for
the Cardinal would do a lot to boost its
chances at earning a nod for a BCS game.

NO. 6 STANFORD

KABIR SAWHNEY
STANFORD 35, ARIZONA STATE 10: Every week, Stanford's offense
has fulfilled and surpassed expectations, scoring points in bunches against the
conference's toughest teams. I fully expect Andrew Luck and the Cardinal to roll up
points against an Arizona State defense that has held only one conference oppo
nent to less than 30 points. On the defensive side, I have consistently discounted
Stanford, only to watch it shut out Washington and throttle Arizona. The Cardinal
defense will continue to play at a high level against Steven Threet and the Sun
Devil offense.

ZACH ZIMMERMAN
STANFORD 34, ARIZONA STATE 1 :My colleague talked two

days ago about the possibility of a letdown, and if it happens, it will be
this week. Arizona State is a very underrated team, and its record is not
indicative of its talent. The Sun Devils played Oregon better than any

team thus far, and nearly beat a highly touted Wisconsin team. Nonetheless,

Stanford is the better team, and being favored by less than a touchdown is in
sulting. The defense has already withstood its toughest tests, and the offense,
now healthy, is firing on all cylinders. Expect another big day from receiver Chris
Owusu, who should run rampant on Arizona State's secondary.

JACOB JAFFE
STANFORD 40, ARIZONA STATE 24: This is a prime game for the Car
dinal to get upset. Stanford is coming off its biggest win of the season, and now
has to travel to Tempe to take on an underrated Arizona State team. Head coach
Jim Harbaugh won't let that happen, though, and a slow start won't be enough to
derail the Cardinal. Sun Devil quarterback Steven Threet will throw a few more cru
cial interceptions, Andrew Luck will have another Heisman-esque performance
and Stanford will pull away in the second half to keep its BCS hopes alive.

24-hour window to enjoy any given
win," said senior center Chase Beeler.
"After that point, you have to lock
right back in and you have to jump
right back on preparing like you
haven't done anything, like it's the first
week of the season."

Though it isn't among the Pac-10's
elite teams, Arizona State's sub-.500
record can be partially attributed to
simple bad luck. The Sun Devils have
twice lost a game by a single point. On
Sept. 18, they fell 20-19 to Wisconsin on
a blocked extra point with four min
utes left in the fourth quarter.
Last weekend against USC, Arizona
State was again the victim of special
teams miscues the Trojans first
blocked an extra point and returned it
to the end zone (which is worth two
points), then ASU kicker Thomas
Weber missed a 41-yard field goal with
1:34 left in the game that would have
given his team a 36-34 lead.
The Sun Devils possess a strong
passing attack that should allow them
to compete against any team in the
conference. Led by quarterback
Steven Threet, Arizona State has the
16th-best passing offense in the nation
and is 37th in scoring offense. Threet, a
transfer from Michigan, has played
well in his first season as head coach
Dennis Erickson's starter, sitting at
second in the conference in passing
yards per game. Compared to other
Pac-10 schools, Arizona State's passing
offense has certainly been impressive
despite a plethora of strong-armed
quarterbacks, the Sun Devil passing at
tack is currently rated second in the
Pac-10.
However, Arizona State lacks a
strong rushing game to complement
Threet. The Sun Devils are eighth in
the conference in rushing offense
their top backfield threat, freshman
Deantre Lewis, is only gaining 57.3
yards per game on the ground, good
for 10th in the conference,
ASU should provide another solid
test for a rejuvenated Stanford de

fense, which has put up very good per
formances in its last two outings. Two
weeks ago, the Cardinal went to Seat
tle and shut out Washington, 41-0, be
fore holding highly touted quarter
back Nick Foles and Arizona to 17
points last weekend.
The defense's performance on the
stat sheet wasn't spectacular against
the Wildcats, as Arizona was able to
gain 428 yards for the game. However,
Stanford killed three Arizona drives
with clutch plays an interception by
senior cornerback Richard Sherman, a
sack that knocked Arizona out of field
goal range to force a punt and a pass
deflection on fourth-and-goal at the
Stanford five-yard line. Wildcat punter
Keenyn Crier was kept busy, with five
punts throughout the game.
Stanford will also rely on its offense
to generate a lot of points, as it has all
season. Led by redshirt sophomore
quarterback Andrew Luck, the offense
has been remarkably consistent, scor
ing between 37 and 42 points over its
last four games. The Cardinal currently
ranks fifth nationally in scoring offense,
and should be able to move the ball
against a Sun Devil defense that ranks
in the middle of the Pac-10 in most sta
tistical categories.
Luck's performances over the past
few weeks have begun to generate
some Heisman buzz as well, a fact that
his teammates are aware of.
"We knew he was that Heisman
caliber player all along, so it doesn't re
ally change our thought process or
mentality," Beeler said. "We'll protect
for him we'll see to it that he goes
untouched, regardless of how he's per
forming."
Beeler and the rest of Stanford's of
fensive line have certainly done their
part this season for the Cardinal. Luck
has been sacked just three times
through nine games, and was not
sacked against Arizona, which features
one of the conference's best defensive
lines.
Stanford's rushing attack has also

been strong this season, helped by the
success of the offensive line. Sopho
more running back Stepfan Taylor,
who has emerged as Stanford's feature
back, is currently fifth in the confer
ence in rushing with 90 yards per game.
However, Harbaugh said he is still
open to employing a rotation of backs,
which the Card used to open the sea
son. Last weekend against Arizona,
sophomore Tyler Gaffney and true
freshman Anthony Wilkerson both
saw significant playing time.
"There's definitely a healthy com
petition going on, for touches, carries
and playing time," Harbaugh said.
"How they practice determines a lot of
that, and it's also determined on Satur
day, by who's got the hot hand."
Saturday's game has bowl implica
tions for both teams. Arizona State is
fighting to keep its postseason hopes
alive, since a loss would technically
eliminate the team from bowl eligibili
ty. However, ASU would still have a
chance at a bowl game even with six
wins, since it could be granted a waiver
if there are not enough eligible teams
to fill the 35 bowls.
Meanwhile, Stanford needs to win
out to keep its BCS bowl hopes alive.
With an 8-1 overall record, the Cardi
nal is already assured of its second
straight bowl game, but has its sights
set on the Rose Bowl or another pres
tigious postseason game.
Despite the Card's lofty ranking, it
could take a little more to push it into a
BCS at-large berth, since Stanford has
a reputation for not being able to trav
el well and send a lot of fans to games.
Harbaugh has no plans to persuade
the football powers to put his team into
a BCS game.
"We're not in the campaigning
business," he said.
Stanford will take on Arizona State
in Tempe on Saturday. Kickoff is sched
uled for 4:30 p.m. PST.

Maintaining focus and intensity will be a key
theme for the Stanford football team this week, as
it hits the road to face Arizona State.
The No. 6 Cardinal (8-1,5-1 Pac-10) is coming off "l
its biggest win of the season, a 42-17 undressing of '
then-No. 15 Arizona.The victory put Stanford into the
discussion for a possible at-large berth into a BCS bowl
game and catapulted it back into the top 10 in all the
major rankings for the first time since its Oct. 2 loss to
now-No. 1 Oregon.

However, the Sun Devils (4-5,2-4) can be a dangerous
team, and have the good fortune of playing the Cardinal
inside the friendly confines of Sun Devil Stadium. Ari
zona State needs to win out in order to become bowl el
igible, since two of its four victories are over FCS teams
and, per NCAA rules, only one of those wins can count
toward bowl eligibility. Given the Sun Devils' despera
tion, this weekend's matchup could have the makings of
a classic "letdown game" for Stanford.
Stanford head coach Jim Harbaugh believes that,
despite that possibility, his team won't get distracted
and overlook the Sun Devils.
"We're going to come in fired up, too," he said. .
"Both teams are very hungry to win the game, and we '
understand that. We have great respect for Arizona
State and the kind of football team they are. i
They've lost four games by a total of 16 points flk

NO. 6 STANFORD

KABIR SAWHNEY
STANFORD 35, ARIZONA STATE 10: Every week, Stanford's offense
has fulfilled and surpassed expectations, scoring points in bunches against the
conference's toughest teams. I fully expect Andrew Luck and the Cardinal to roll up
points against an Arizona State defense that has held only one conference oppo
nent to less than 30 points. On the defensive side, I have consistently discounted
Stanford, only to watch it shut out Washington and throttle Arizona. The Cardinal
defense will continue to play at a high level against Steven Threet and the Sun
Devil offense.

ZACH ZIMMERMAN
STANFORD 34, ARIZONA STATE 1 :My colleague talked two

days ago about the possibility of a letdown, and if it happens, it will be
this week. Arizona State is a very underrated team, and its record is not
indicative of its talent. The Sun Devils played Oregon better than any

team thus far, and nearly beat a highly touted Wisconsin team. Nonetheless,

Stanford is the better team, and being favored by less than a touchdown is in
sulting. The defense has already withstood its toughest tests, and the offense,
now healthy, is firing on all cylinders. Expect another big day from receiver Chris
Owusu, who should run rampant on Arizona State's secondary.

JACOB JAFFE
STANFORD 40, ARIZONA STATE 24: This is a prime game for the Car
dinal to get upset. Stanford is coming off its biggest win of the season, and now
has to travel to Tempe to take on an underrated Arizona State team. Head coach
Jim Harbaugh won't let that happen, though, and a slow start won't be enough to
derail the Cardinal. Sun Devil quarterback Steven Threet will throw a few more cru
cial interceptions, Andrew Luck will have another Heisman-esque performance
and Stanford will pull away in the second half to keep its BCS hopes alive.

24-hour window to enjoy any given
win," said senior center Chase Beeler.
"After that point, you have to lock
right back in and you have to jump
right back on preparing like you
haven't done anything, like it's the first
week of the season."

Though it isn't among the Pac-10's
elite teams, Arizona State's sub-.500
record can be partially attributed to
simple bad luck. The Sun Devils have
twice lost a game by a single point. On
Sept. 18, they fell 20-19 to Wisconsin on
a blocked extra point with four min
utes left in the fourth quarter.
Last weekend against USC, Arizona
State was again the victim of special
teams miscues the Trojans first
blocked an extra point and returned it
to the end zone (which is worth two
points), then ASU kicker Thomas
Weber missed a 41-yard field goal with
1:34 left in the game that would have
given his team a 36-34 lead.
The Sun Devils possess a strong
passing attack that should allow them
to compete against any team in the
conference. Led by quarterback
Steven Threet, Arizona State has the
16th-best passing offense in the nation
and is 37th in scoring offense. Threet, a
transfer from Michigan, has played
well in his first season as head coach
Dennis Erickson's starter, sitting at
second in the conference in passing
yards per game. Compared to other
Pac-10 schools, Arizona State's passing
offense has certainly been impressive
despite a plethora of strong-armed
quarterbacks, the Sun Devil passing at
tack is currently rated second in the
Pac-10.
However, Arizona State lacks a
strong rushing game to complement
Threet. The Sun Devils are eighth in
the conference in rushing offense
their top backfield threat, freshman
Deantre Lewis, is only gaining 57.3
yards per game on the ground, good
for 10th in the conference,
ASU should provide another solid
test for a rejuvenated Stanford de

fense, which has put up very good per
formances in its last two outings. Two
weeks ago, the Cardinal went to Seat
tle and shut out Washington, 41-0, be
fore holding highly touted quarter
back Nick Foles and Arizona to 17
points last weekend.
The defense's performance on the
stat sheet wasn't spectacular against
the Wildcats, as Arizona was able to
gain 428 yards for the game. However,
Stanford killed three Arizona drives
with clutch plays an interception by
senior cornerback Richard Sherman, a
sack that knocked Arizona out of field
goal range to force a punt and a pass
deflection on fourth-and-goal at the
Stanford five-yard line. Wildcat punter
Keenyn Crier was kept busy, with five
punts throughout the game.
Stanford will also rely on its offense
to generate a lot of points, as it has all
season. Led by redshirt sophomore
quarterback Andrew Luck, the offense
has been remarkably consistent, scor
ing between 37 and 42 points over its
last four games. The Cardinal currently
ranks fifth nationally in scoring offense,
and should be able to move the ball
against a Sun Devil defense that ranks
in the middle of the Pac-10 in most sta
tistical categories.
Luck's performances over the past
few weeks have begun to generate
some Heisman buzz as well, a fact that
his teammates are aware of.
"We knew he was that Heisman
caliber player all along, so it doesn't re
ally change our thought process or
mentality," Beeler said. "We'll protect
for him we'll see to it that he goes
untouched, regardless of how he's per
forming."
Beeler and the rest of Stanford's of
fensive line have certainly done their
part this season for the Cardinal. Luck
has been sacked just three times
through nine games, and was not
sacked against Arizona, which features
one of the conference's best defensive
lines.
Stanford's rushing attack has also

been strong this season, helped by the
success of the offensive line. Sopho
more running back Stepfan Taylor,
who has emerged as Stanford's feature
back, is currently fifth in the confer
ence in rushing with 90 yards per game.
However, Harbaugh said he is still
open to employing a rotation of backs,
which the Card used to open the sea
son. Last weekend against Arizona,
sophomore Tyler Gaffney and true
freshman Anthony Wilkerson both
saw significant playing time.
"There's definitely a healthy com
petition going on, for touches, carries
and playing time," Harbaugh said.
"How they practice determines a lot of
that, and it's also determined on Satur
day, by who's got the hot hand."
Saturday's game has bowl implica
tions for both teams. Arizona State is
fighting to keep its postseason hopes
alive, since a loss would technically
eliminate the team from bowl eligibili
ty. However, ASU would still have a
chance at a bowl game even with six
wins, since it could be granted a waiver
if there are not enough eligible teams
to fill the 35 bowls.
Meanwhile, Stanford needs to win
out to keep its BCS bowl hopes alive.
With an 8-1 overall record, the Cardi
nal is already assured of its second
straight bowl game, but has its sights
set on the Rose Bowl or another pres
tigious postseason game.
Despite the Card's lofty ranking, it
could take a little more to push it into a
BCS at-large berth, since Stanford has
a reputation for not being able to trav
el well and send a lot of fans to games.
Harbaugh has no plans to persuade
the football powers to put his team into
