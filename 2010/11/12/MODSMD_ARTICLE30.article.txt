# Students reconstruct the 'Hijabi Monologues'

This past Saturday, nine Stanford stu
dent and staff members took to the
stage to deliver heartfelt, meaningful
monologues on the experiences of the
"hijabi," a Muslim woman who chooses to
wear the traditional headscarf, the hijab.
Unusually, these were not personal experi
ences of the students, though their convic
tion and emotional intensity never revealed
this fact. Stanford Theatre Activist
Mobilization Project's (STAMP) production
of the "Hijabi Monologues," in conjunction
with the Muslim Student Awareness Network
(MSAN), departed from STAMP'S usual
trend of drawing material from Stanford stu
dents and their experiences.
"STAMP has done several different
monologue projects in the past... however,
in the 'Hijabi Monologues' the script itself is
not native to Stanford," said Heidi Thorsen
'l2, STAMP'S producer of the show. "The
monologues are not, for the most part, a
compilation of different individuals' stories,
but rather the work of one writer, Sahar
Ullah."
As STAMP focuses on social theater rele
vant to the Stanford community, Thorsen
said, "There was a much greater concern and
emphasis on how we would make these sto
ries our own." The production team also had

the unique experience of working directly
with the author of the monologues, Sahar
Ullah, who participated in a panel discussion
after the show on Saturday.
"We were under a legal obligation to
keep the monologues already in the script,
though we could add monologues of our
own if they were approved," said Aditya
Singh 'l3, one of the two directors of the
show. "While we did have some extra mono
logues initially, we eventually discarded them
as they were too tangential and we wanted to
keep the script coherent."
In the panel discussion, Ullah explained
that even the official canon of the
"Monologues" expands organically as she dis
covers new stories that can be well-incorpo
rated into the show. Nor does the show suffer
from a lack of diversity in its content. At
times, drastically different consecutive mono
logues nearly gave me whiplash with their
abrupt change of tone, yet I found this style
effective in driving home the huge variation
in the experiences of the hijabis who tell their
stories.
Starting with a short monologue, "I'm
Tired," Kate Hyder 'll talked about the con
stant pressure to represent an entire world
religion, to deal with people insisting she
must be oppressed by her choice of clothing.

The monologues soon spiraled into narra
tives that were at times heartbreaking and
hilarious, shocking and relatable.
Monologues like "Knock on the Door,"
about a young Muslim American woman's
father's wrongful arrest after 9/11 and "My
Son's Wedding," a mother's lament at her
son's premature death, dealt with extremely
difficult experiences, whether specific to
Muslim women or universal. There were light
monologues as well, for instance about the
many pickup lines hijabis are likely to receive.
Perhaps the most fun and a perfect
penultimate monologue to the much more
serious final monologue, "The Hijabi
Protectors" excellently acted by Hana Al-
Henaid 'l4, is Ullah's own story of the goofy,
nerdy boys of her senior class in high school
who decided to take it upon themselves to be
her hijabi protectors and keep other boys
from touching her. This monologue, like an
earlier one where she describes trying to find
a place to pray during a football game, is
light and entertaining, but also feels astonish
ingly real and normal, a simple slice of life
for a young woman.
Ullah said in the panel that this is in fact
the goal of the monologues, to show the real
