"Harry Potter" hysteria has spread to every corner of
Stanford University and has now infiltrated campus events as
well.
The annual "Frosh Formal," which will be held in the
Arrillaga Alumni Center tonight from 10 p.m. to 1 a.m., has
been renamed the "Yule Ball" after the famous dance held at
Hogwarts School during the Triwizard Tournament in book
four, "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire."
The current Frosh Council selected this theme from around
a dozen amusing and trendy ideas such as "I'm on a Boat" and
"Casino Royale." Frosh Council representative Arif Gilani
explained that the council "wanted a theme that encompassed
our entire freshman class."
"So let's be real... Who doesn't like Harry Potter?" he
added.
Not only was "Yule Ball" a fun and relevant choice, it's also
perfect that Frosh Formal, as Professor McGonagall would say,
"is first and foremost, a dance."
Frosh Council publicized "Yule Ball" with flyers, a Facebook
group and an entertaining promo video that emphasized the
theme as well the subtitle of the event, "Ballin' at the Yule Ball."
"The decorations and atmosphere will allow you to experi
ence the magical world of Harry Potter," assured frosh represen
tative Dhruv Amin. Students can expect a beautifully decorated
venue, a full dance floor and an array of desserts in the lobby
for when their feet get tired.
On behalf of Frosh Council, Arif Gilani promises that "the
Yule Ball truly will be where magic happens."
