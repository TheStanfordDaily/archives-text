# Harry Potter
## How will you celebrate the arrival of 'The Deathly Hallows?' 
### â€” lauren WILSON contact lauren: lhwilson@stanford. edu 
With Thanksgiving break and the first
installment of "Harry Potter and the
Deathly Hallows" hitting theaters
Nov. 19, there are bound to be some folks flying
out to the magical lands of Orlando to check out
The Wizarding World of Harry Potter. To prep
for that, Intermission has kindly provided an
official breakdown of what could very well be the
greatest experience of any true "Potter" fan's life.
Entering Hogsmeade is guaranteed the clos
est we Muggles will ever get to experiencing the
magical world of Harry, Hermione and Co. It's
truly magical. The rooftops are perpetually cov
ered in snow. The Hogwarts Express toots a wel-

come while blasting steam,
and, like the real
Hogsmeade, it's constant
ly bustling with hordes ol
people. Shopping-wise,
the first stores you hit
are Zonko's, the toy shop

and Honeydukes, the candy store, which
are connected. Zonko's carries various memora
bilia and wizard toys mentioned in the novels
as well as more common, vintage-looking toys
like a tin robot or wooden duck. If you look
up while you cross into Honeydukes, you'll
see extendable ears dangling from the ceiling.
The colors in the candy shop are as vibrant
and delicious as the goodies it sells. Here you
can get your Cauldron Cakes, treacle tarts,
Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans and
Chocolate Frogs which natu-

rally come with a holo-

graphic trading card.
For more standard

souvenirs, there's Filch's Emporium nestled in
the base of the Hogwarts castle and Dervish and
Banges outside the Dragon Challenge rollercoast
er. If you're willing to wait in line, there's a quick
five-minute "wand-selecting" process inside
Ollivanders that faithfully recreates the "wand
chooses the wizard" scene from "Harry Potter
and the Sorcerer's Stone." From there, you're
shepherded into D & B. The more impatient may
use the general entrance by the Owl Post. Be
forewarned: anything you buy from The
Wizarding World is going to cost exorbitant
amounts of money. A simple robe runs about
$lOO each, while wands go for a little over $3O.
When you get hungry, swing by the Three
Broomsticks for a meal. For a theme park, the
prices aren't too bad around $lO-15 a meal.
The Hog's Head pub is located on the opposite
side of the Three Broomsticks for those looking
for a drink. You can buy pumpkin juice and
Butterbeer at the pub, or from the little snack
carts littered about The Wizarding World.
Butterbeer comes in two options: cold is slightly
cheaper but frozen is a slushier form that's worth
the extra 50 cents, especially in the humid
Florida weather. The pumpkin juice tastes like a
pumpkin-spiced thick cider, while the Butterbeer
is a frothy, butterscotch cream soda concoction.
As for the rides, Dragon Challenge is the
same Dueling Dragons rollercoaster that's been
around since Island of Adventure's opening in
1999, though now it's been refurbished as hom
age to the Triwizard Tournament. Riders can
choose to take on either the Chinese Fireball or
the Hungarian Horntail. Flight of the Hippogriff
is also a revamped version of an older ride.
Formerly the Flying Unicorn, it's meant to mimic
Care of Magical Creatures professor Hagrid
teaching students to ride hippogriffs. It's a nice
attraction for younger visitors who may be too
scared or short to go on the other rides.

The Wizarding World is jam-packed with
painstaking detail and references that will
undoubtedly please any "Harry Potter" fan.
Hermione's Yule Ball dress from the fourth book
is on display in one of the shop windows, piles of
Gilderoy Lockhart's latest books are stacked in
another. There's a Gringotts sign over the ATM,
and visitors can hear Moaning Myrtle whine
while they use the restroom. However, nothing
can hold a candle to Harry Potter and the
Forbidden Journey, the crown jewel of The
Wizarding World. There isn't another ride like it
in the world; it's probably the best amusement
park ride you'll ever experience, at least for now.
Even waiting in line is fun. You basically get a

walking tour of Hogwarts, and it's the real deal
the house points, magic tools like the Pensieve
and, most importantly, talking portraits. The
Forbidden Journey takes riders through
Hogwarts and allows them to experience the
Forbidden Forest, a Quidditch match, the
Chamber of Secrets and more. It's an incredibly
complicated combination of simulation screens,
real-life props like a mechanical Whomping
Willow and other special effects like heat from a
dragon's breath. It gets pretty scary too. If you
don't at least jump a little when a pack of demen
tors start popping out, you're lying. Riders des
perate to go again should take advantage of the
single rider's line, which can bypass the long wait.
You're probably going to leave The
Wizarding World with junk you'd never thought
you'd buy like the aforementioned wands (literal
ly $3O sticks) or a $25 picture to prove you went
on the Forbidden Journey. While you'll probably
leave with a bank account that looks more like
the Weasleys' than Harry's, I guarantee you won't
be complaining.

leave with a bank account that looks more like
the Weasleys' than Harry's, I guarantee you won't
be complaining.
