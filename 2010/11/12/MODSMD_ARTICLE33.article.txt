# Robber Barons explore first-world angst

For their fall show, the
Stanford student sketch
comedy group Robber
Barons has opted to tackle the
tragedies of a more obscure
minority group: the few, the
proud and the whiny that suffer as
privileged youth. In "First World
Problems," the Robber Barons
excel at highlighting the absurdi
ties of the socioeconomically
secure, only falling flat when they
stray too far from the theme.
The topic is a smart choice, as
no generation likes to hear about
itself quite as much as ours. One
poster proclaims the harrowing
truth, "Some people still have to
use the iPhone 3G". Another
mourns the fact that "Every five
minutes, a child goes without
dessert".
"They may seem fortunate,"
announced a deadpan Lauren
Kelly 'l3 at the top of the show,
"but unfortunately they don't feel
that way." From the opening
infomercial to the closing group
number that puts every "Glee"
ending to shame, the comedy
group takes on cell reception,
theme houses, blogging and built
to-fail relationships all topics
that the student body can relate to
and laugh over.
The best skits stick to the
familiar: Sophie Carter-Kahn 'l3

and Kelly are memorable as a
spacey blogger and reluctant wit
ness, respectively, aided by fast
paced writing that spawns one of
the most hilariously tragic
acronyms. The writers earn laughs
again with devilishly upbeat Sam
Corrao Clanon 'l3, who pulls out
a perfect radio voice for a split
personality performance.
Even the more outlandish
setups are reined in by everyday

characters. The tribute to "2001: A
Space Odyssey" has the men of
Robber Barons (clad in . . . you
really need to just see for yourself)
return to the middle-school
mindset in an alpha-male display.
On a similarly fanciful premise,
the Ancient Greek theme house
skit is anchored by the dude-ish
yet naive characters played by
Carlo Pasco 'l3 and Alex Connolly
'll, who evoke overeager fresh
men all across campus.
The Robber Barons fare less

well at portraying couples
either together or in the midst of a
nasty divorce. Often the married
life skits become too abstracted
from an audience that is, for the
most part, sans-wedding ring.
Those first world problems
haven't yet hit the student popula
tion, so the comedy doesn't hit
home as much as, say, a texting
your-mom joke.
In terms of physical comedy,
director Connolly and head writer
Cameron Poter' 11 stand out in
"First World Problems" for their
timing and facial expressions.
And while they aren't an a
cappella group, the Robber Barons
are nonetheless charming in their
resounding musical finish, with
the off-key yet soulful chorus. "We
are first world/We are rich chil
dren/We are the ones who like to
hoard the world's resources."
Experience "First World
Problems" Friday, Nov. 12 and
Saturday, Nov. 13 at 7:30 p.m. and
9:30 p.m. in the Nitery. Admission
is free for students with SUID, $lO
