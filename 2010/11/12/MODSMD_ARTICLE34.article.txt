Next week, Stanford and Cal
will face off on the football
field, but tonight, they meet
on the dance floor as friendly foes.
The two schools' ballroom teams will
jumpstart the countdown to next
Saturday's game at Allegro Ballroom
in Emeryville for the first ever Cal-
Stanford Big Dance (not to be con
fused with Stanford's annual all-night
Big Dance in the spring). Potentially
the first of many such gatherings, this
year's inaugural event stands to be
incorporated into the decades-long
tradition of rivalry and gaiety associ
ated with Big Game week.
The Cal-Stanford "Big Dance"
was conceived and planned by the
staff of Allegro Ballroom, a non-prof
it dance studio and special-event
venue, in conjunction with the
Stanford Ballroom Dance Team and
the UC-Berkeley Ballroom Dancers.
Though the two teams frequently
cross paths at competitions, tonight's
proceedings are meant to bring them
together to mix, mingle and be merry
in a laid-back and convivial atmos
phere, and to promote ballroom
dancing on both campuses.
The evening will consist of social
dancing, school spirit and, of course,
some friendly competition: team
members will participate in the
straight-leg cha-cha while attempting
to keep a straight face, lest they be
disqualified for cracking a smile; and
women will take the lead and sweep
the men off their feet in the role
reversal rumba.
A comic spin on ballroom clas
sics, this repertoire of "fun dances" on
the docket for tonight is a lightheart
ed and good-humored take on con-

ventional competition pieces. In lieu
of strict technique and meticulous
partnership, couples will focus on fun
and be judged accordingly on their
propensity for parody and ability to
think outside the ballroom box.
Sprinkled in among the "fun
dances," both teams will have an
opportunity to put on mini showcas
es to highlight the best dancers from
both sides of the Bay. One such show
case will even feature a mixed roster,
when a Stanford lead and Berkeley
follow pair up for a joint perform
ance, Tony and Maria style.
The evening's victor, to be
declared by the judges of Allegro
Ballroom, will return to its respective
campus bearing a trophy. It will be
theirs to display proudly until the
teams reconvene for another round of
jovial competition in honor of the
next Big Game week.
Book-ended by general dancing
and festivities, the event is open to
students, alumni and the local com
munity, be they social dance enthusi
asts or curious spectators. There will
be ample opportunity for inspired
audience members to break out their
own moves following the main event.
Tickets can be purchased at the
door tonight at Allegro Ballroom in
Emeryville, $5 for ballroom team
members, $9 for non-members.
School spirit is encouraged, so be sure
to leave all blue and gold attire at
home and represent with some
Cardinal red.
