With Dreamworks' heavy marketing
and its cast of comedy all-stars
including Will Ferrell, Tina Fey,
Brad Pitt, Jonah Hill and David Cross
("Arrested Development"), "Megamind" has
garnered a lot of buzz. And it indeed lives up
to the hype as a fresh, witty take on the stan
dard superhero-versus-supervillain movie.
The movie's own catchphrase on the poster
captures its essence: "A superhero movie with
a mind of its own."
The movie cuts the mainstream super
hero elements out of the picture the moment
it starts, while the main character, Megamind
(Will Ferrell), is still an adorable baby.
With an enormous black hole swallow
ing his planet, little Megamind's parents rush
him into the space capsule with their last
words: "You are destined for ...," but a con
fused Megamind fails to catch the key part of
his parents' blessing and is thrown onto

Earth to figure out his destiny. And destiny
indeed has its own plans. It sends his arch
nemesis, Metro Man (Brad Pitt), another
alien baby with superpowers, to a wealthy
foster family with a huge mansion in Metro
City. Little Megamind, on the other hand,
gets flown into the city jail, where he devel
ops a questionable worldview and moral
compass.
When the time comes for young
Megamind to go to school, he realizes he's
the one awkward kid who simply doesn't
blend in. Embarrassed and frustrated by the
other kids in class, especially young Metro
Man, Megamind embraces evil to gain atten
tion, also igniting the rivalry that drives the
film.
Predictably, each challenge Megamind
poses to Metro Man ends in humiliating fail
ure, though Megamind manages to find joy
and fulfillment through his attempts. But one

day, he unexpectedly succeeds, and suddenly,
he finds himself lost and without purpose.
Where does he go from there?
The movie definitely brings in the
laughs. There are countless hilarious
moments between the awkward supervillain
and his fishy sidekick Minion while they exe
cute his plans. More giggles are induced with
Metro Man's debatable singing talents and
Megamind's ridiculous belongings, like his
weird-looking robot pets and "Black Mamba"
supervillain costume.
Every superhero-versus-supervillain
movie involves saving the beauty. In this case,
the beauty is Metro Man's girlfriend Roxanne
(Tina Fey), a TV news reporter. As a super
predictable villain, no matter how hard he
tries, Megamind just cannot intimidate the
fearless Roxanne even a little bit. However,
mutual dislike is the start of many a love
story. You see where I'm going. Nonetheless,

the romance in the film is never cliche, which
adds to the fun.
"Megamind" is a movie full of fun,
adventure, romance, good versus evil, ridicu
lousness, surprises and, of course, scenes of
skyscrapers falling, superheroes fighting,
damsels in distress and Metro City in con
stant peril. In the end, all it comes down to is
the struggle between good and evil within
everyone's heart. The movie doesn't forget to
teach some nice moral lessons to the younger
ones in the crowd. One last note to
movie-goers: Don't miss the last funny bit of
the movie. Stay until the very end of the
credits to watch it!
