Presh off last summer's success with "The
Hangover," director Todd Phillips' lat-

.X. est comedic effort, "Due Date,"
unfortunately comes up short. His new
film, which centers on the journey and
unlikely pairing of the high-strung and
volatile architect Peter Highman (Robert
Downey, Jr.) and the socially inept but
well-meaning aspiring actor Ethan

Tremblay (Zach Galifianakis), lacks both the
inspiration and innovation that made "The
Hangover" so memorable.
As the title suggests, the crux of the film is
for Highman to get from Atlanta to Los
Angeles in time to witness the birth of his first
child. But of course, it's not that simple.
Tremblay first bumps into Highman (both lit
erally and figuratively) curbside at the airport,
and again when the two board the same flight.
Confusion and miscommunication ensue, and
not even 10 minutes in, both are placed on the
No Fly List. With his belongings still on the
plane, Highman has no choice but to join
Tremblay on a chaotic road trip west in a red

Subaru rental, which later becomes a bor
rowed Range Rover and finally a stolen border
patrol truck.
Whereas in Phillips' previous works the
punches keep rolling and the energy is kept
high throughout, in "Due Date," the evolution
of the pair's means of transportation serves as
an analog for the development of the plot:
occasional high points punctuated by definite
lulls. This may just be a pitfall of the road trip
movie, as the low points occur mostly in the
filler scenes focusing on the two men in the
car going between destinations. The one
exception, however, is when Tremblay decides
to hotbox the Range Rover, and in a cannabis
induced stupor mistakes the "Mexico" sign at
the Juarez-El Paso border crossing point for

"Texaco." But even so, the resulting situation
relies mostly on racial stereotyping and slap
stick for laughs, without bringing anything
new to the screen.
For their parts, Downey and Galifianakis
make the most of what they were given, which
quite frankly is not much. The screenplay, a
collaborative effort between Alan R. Cohen,
Alan Freedland, Adam Sztykiel and Phillips,
generates minimal character depth, and
instead, "Due Date" relies heavily on visual
cues to let the audience know who's who.
From the moment Highman and Tremblay lay
eyes on each other outside the Atlanta airport
(with the former giving the latter a scornful
glance up and down), we know the two men
are polar opposites. Highman rolls up in a
black town car wearing a trim suit, Bluetooth
earpiece and aviator sunglasses to shield him
from the world. Tremblay, on the other hand,
is dropped off in a worn Volvo station wagon
looking like an overgrown gnome with a
bushy beard obscuring half his face and a size
able beer belly protruding over the waist of a
pair of acid-wash jeans, several sizes too small.
No words are needed here to express how

strikingly different they are, and
in fact, there is little of substance
that passes between the two char
acters. While they form a tenuous
bond over their missing fathers
(Highman's left when he was a
boy; Tremblay's is recently
deceased), it, like many other
promising parts of the movie, is
thwarted by hackneyed comedic
tropes. We do get some laughs
out of Tremblay's father, whose
ashes are kept in a coffee can, but
alas, it's nothing we haven't seen
before.
In the end, it feels as though
the problem with "Due Date" is
simply that it tries too hard to
please. Unlike "The Hangover,"
which pushed the envelope with
its bawdiness and profanity, "Due
Date" comes across as pre
dictable, strained and far less
original. That's not to say that it
is a complete flop it does have
its funny moments, but you can
see all those in the trailer. Take
my advice: save your money and
watch that instead.
