						Thermals swing by San Francisco 
### â€” Jennifer SCHAFFER contact jennifer: jmschaff@stanford. edu 
Next Monday, high-energy
punk band The Thermals
will rock the Independent
in San Francisco. Eight years after
forming The Thermals in Portland,
lead singer and guitarist Hutch
Harris and bassist Kathy Foster are
going stronger than ever, along
with drummer Westin Glass who
joined two years ago.
Harris and Foster, originally
from San Jose, have been living in
Portland for 12 years. "It's rad," said
Harris of the Portland music scene,
"You know, Modest Mouse and The
Shins and The Decembrists ...
there's so many awesome bands up
in Portland who kind of know each
other, it's been a really strong music
scene for a long time."
It's those musical connections
which helped The Thermals break
into the business. After getting to
know Ben Gibbard, of Death Cab
for Cutie and The Postal Service
fame, through a friend, Hutch

passed him a copy of The
Thermals' newly recorded first
album. "We were just giving copies
away to everyone," Harris recalled.
"Not even to get a record deal, just
to give it away to people." Gibbard,
who had been working on The
Postal Service's record for Sub Pop
Records, was a fan of the demo,
and passed it on to Sub Pop execs,
who were quick to get in touch
with The Thermals.
"Kathy and I had been making
bands and recording stuff and
sending it to Sub Pop for years, but
there was something really immedi
ate about that first Thermals
recording that people really liked,"
Harris said. "It was really fresh,
especially then. Lo-fi is really big
right now, but not a lot of people
were doing 10-fi in 2001 or 2002.
The songs were really fast and
exciting and immediate."
The Thermals' most recent
album, "Personal Life," came out

this September. "Half of you loves
it, and half of you is nervous to see
how people like it," Harris com
mented. When asked if he thought
it was their best album yet, he shyly
replied, "That's more for other peo
ple to judge than it is for us to
judge."
After five weeks on the road
performing around the country
their fifth trip of the year The
Thermals are about to embark on a
smaller tour, including San
Francisco, Los Angeles, San Diego
and Oakland. Harris says the band
has a great dynamic and loves tour
ing together. Last year, The
Thermals took "seven or eight trips
. . . including Europe and China.
We just tour all the time, we like it.
We have a good time, we're always
just laughing our asses off," he
chuckled.

The Thermals are particularly
excited to perform in San Francisco
again. "San Francisco's always awe

some to play," Harris said,
"And we have so many family and
friends there, from growing up in
San Jose."
When the trio is back in
Portland, they continue to make
music together while working on
their own side projects, Foster's
Love Always and Harris's
Forbidden Friends. "You need to
take a break from the main project,
but you also need to stay creative
and be creative in other ways,"

Hutch said. "All three of us love to
do a lot of visual arts stuff, too,
painting and collage and computer
stuff."
So what are Hutch Harris's
plans for The Thermals' future?
"Just keep going. We never really
stopped."
