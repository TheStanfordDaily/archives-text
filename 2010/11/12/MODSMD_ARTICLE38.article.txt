# Steve Aoki heats up Big Game week
##

If any of you out there were
still doubting how memo
rable Big Game week will be
this year (freshmen especially),
doubt no longer, Stanford
Concert Network (SCN) has
come through BIG. SCN is
bringing Steve Aoki and Kid
Sister to Stanford for a concert
Tuesday, Nov. 16.
Electro-house artist Steve
Aoki will bring the energy to
Stanford with well-known tracks
like "I'm in the House" and his
remix of "The Pursuit of
Happiness," as well as the primal
scream of "Warp 1.9".
Female rapper Kid Sister is a
bit more of a wild card. She's
most known for her Kanye West
collaboration "Pro Nails."
However, despite her low celebri
ty status, Sister should put on a
unique performance at the very
worst.
Both artists, combined with
the natural energy and Stanford
students' tendency to drop work
during Big Game week, are
poised to make this year's con
cert a great success. As SCN pub
licity director Kevin Chow'l3
notes, "expect crowd-surfing,
confetti, craziness."
Some students also have the
chance to open for Kid Sister and

Steve Aoki with Stanford's DJ
competition, which began last
Tuesday and runs through Nov
14. The contest pits six Stanford
DJ groups against one another
other for the opening slot. The
winner will be determined by
popular vote.
In attempt to get their sound
out, each of the six groups,
"DATAKISS," "Astroßanch," "Rob
Noam Deniz," "DJ iN,"
"Thelonius" and "DJ SG" have
released a mix online. The mixes
illustrate a wide range of styles
and approaches, from Noam Ben
David's self-described "sexual
intercourse between Electro
House and remixed popular
music" to DATAKISS's "Dutch
house music with a couple
ridiculously tasty bass lines." Yet,
the only way to really get a feel is
to take a listen.
These students promise to
add their own dynamic to the
SCN show, and their genres hint
at a growing trend around the
Stanford campus.
"A couple years ago, you
would be shot if you played any
thing besides Top 40 or Journey.
Now, people are starting to like
the banging beats of electro," said
Evan Huck 'll of Astroßanch.
One conceivable problem

with the contest, however, lies in
the length of the mixes, 20 min
utes apiece. Not necessarily bad
in and of itself, it only becomes
an issue when we take into con
text how little free time Stanford
students have. This has, in some
ways, seriously affected the valu
ating criteria.
As DJ SG lamented,
"Whenever we asked people like
'Oh, did you vote?'... It wasn't
like 'I really liked that DJ so I
voted for him,' it was like 'I know
that DJ' or 'l've heard about him
I think,' that has a huge influence
who wins this contest." In other
words, the main issue may not be
talent but popularity.
Yet the overriding feeling of
the competition and the concert
as whole is very positive.
"Ultimately, Steve Aoki is
awesome everyone needs to
come to the show. It will be epic
no matter who opens," said Tony
Jin'l3 (or DJiN).
