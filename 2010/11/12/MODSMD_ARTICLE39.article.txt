By far the greatest strength of
artist Kid Cudi is his effortless
synthesis of alternative and
hip-hop music. His biggest hits, such
as "Day 'n' Nite," epitomize his musi
cal style, blending meaningful lyrics
with ridiculously catchy beats that
simultaneously attract the most
urban and suburban of listeners.
However, with his second studio
album, "Man on the Moon II: The
Legend of Mr. Rager," Cudi focuses
very intensely on his intended theme
with mixed results. Although Cudi
presents a strong front with a well
organized, cohesive album, many of
the individual songs are stumbling
blocks in an otherwise unhindered
path to success.
"Man on the Moon II: The
Legend of Mr. Rager" sounds as
nightmarish as its name: the album is
decorated with haunting, high-

pitched synth, hypnotic piano riffs
and tragic violins. The result is a
work that creates an eerie, futuristic
feel with every song and possesses a
strong sense of structure.
Similar to his first studio album,
Cudi organizes "Man on the Moon
II" into five acts that effectively repre
sent different divisions of his own
psyche and also build a framework
that greatly helps construct the
tracks. However, the quality of music
between and within each act varies
greatly throughout the album.
"Act 1: The World I Am Ruling"
gives the album a strong start with
two songs to its name. The second,
"REVOFEV," is perhaps the best of
the album; the track jumps out as a
skillful fusion of rock and hip-hop
with a non-conformist mood as Cudi
asks, " Let's go, I heard they found a
solution/Where will you be for the rev

olution?"
Cudi also shines when relating
his most difficult struggles. "Act 4:
The Transformation" dips into his
past and his journey to the top, and
the act emerges with two of the
album's strongest lyrical accomplish
ments, "MANIAC" and "Mr. Rager."
In these tracks, Cudi gives listeners a
candid look into his troubled life
while urging them to "paint a black
hole blacker."
Nevertheless, "Man on the
Moon II" has several weaknesses.
Throughout the album, Cudi proves
to be a more powerful artist alone
than in a group which is no small
feat considering the featured artists
(Cee Lo Green, Mary J. Blige, Kanye
West, etc.) he chooses to work with.
Without exception, the collabora
tions are the weakest tracks and do
nothing but drag down a work that

could have been a masterpiece.
A few entire acts are also unfor
tunate missteps in the album. "Act 2:
A Stronger Trip" adds nothing to the
album and is simply a collection of
good beats and comparatively mean
ingless lyrics although, to be fair,
they are particularly good beats,
especially that of the piano-driven
fifth track, "Marijuana." "Act 5: You
Live & You Learn" reflects Cudi's
complex perception of himself, but is
bad in the opposite way a strange
mix of thought-provoking lyrics and
horrible-sounding tracks.
The worst mistake, however, is
"Act 3: Party On." The act contains
another of the strongest tracks of the
album, "Ashin' Kusher," an upbeat
song that truly reflects a party
lifestyle. However, the rest of Act 3 is
nothing more than a clump of oddly
superficial songs.
While "Man on the Moon II" is
an album worth owning, it leaves a
few things to be desired. Next time
around, by placing more of his focus
on individual songs and evoking a
mood, Cudi will be able to break out
of his small sophomore slump and
return to creating the meaningful
music he is known for.
