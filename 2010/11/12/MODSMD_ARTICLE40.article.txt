A hamburger is among the
most popular dishes in the
world. McDonald's has
claimed it sells "more than 75 ham
burgers per second, of every
minute, of every hour, of every day
of the year." Americans in particu
lar enjoy their share we consume
some 14 billion hamburgers annu
ally. In such a saturated market
(saturated here referring to the
amount of competition, not the
meat), it can be difficult to stand
out; The Counter, however, towers
over others.
The Counter almost feels like a
modern-day "The Max" from
"Saved by the Bell," with its skate
boards on the wall. The restaurant
has quite a bit of motion and chat
ter going on to accompany the fun
atmosphere; those looking to slow
things down should sit outside.
The Counter is mainly BYOB
build your own burger. The
selection of meats, cheeses, buns,
toppings and sauces are wide and

delicious basically across the
board. It would be difficult for
even the pickiest eaters not to be
able to concoct something they
truly enjoy here.
The pre-made Signature
Burgers are great examples of
some potent combinations. The
"Counter Burger" comes with a
heaping pile of crispy onion
strings, and the meat is cooked just
right. It is not necessarily packed
with flavor unto itself but is nicely
accompanied by a sun-dried toma
to vinaigrette. The buttery bun is
delicious and does just enough in
its supporting role. The "Old
School" is similar in the sense that
it is a relatively straightforward but
highly dependable burger that is
greatly enhanced by the red relish
dipping sauce. Unlike some of the
other options that thrive even with
out their accoutrements, these two
need their sauces a bit more. It's
not a flaw with the burgers though,
The Counter just defaults to the

customer's opinion about the right
amount of sweet on as savory a
dish as a burger.
The Counter's non-beef
options are probably better than
their staple offerings. The "Unique
Veggie" burger is shockingly good.
The homemade patty has a soft tex
ture reminiscent of hash browns
due to the starchy components
such as corn, rice and potato. It is a
far cry from the imitation beef pat
ties available at supermarkets, and
it moves in the right direction it
provides a great salty and savory
balance at least on par with beef
burgers without trying to be some
thing it isn't. The roasted red pep
pers add a perfect amount of sweet
to the burger. The dish is incredi
ble with or without the Dijon bal-
