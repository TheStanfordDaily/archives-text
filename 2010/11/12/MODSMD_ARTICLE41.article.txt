## College goes retro in 'Glory Daze' 
### – lauren WILSON contact lauren: lhwilson@stanford. edu 
College shows usually don't last that
long. Judd Apatow's underappreciated
"Undeclared" was canceled after just
one season while the combination of J.J.
Abrams and Keri Russell kept "Felicity" afloat
for only four seasons. "Gossip Girl" has
adjusted its characters' shift to college life by
pretty much never showing them in class or at
school, instead opting for city shots and
swanky parties. The reigning college show of
the moment, ABC Family's "Greek," is on its
way out with its fourth and final season pre
miering this January.
Why is it so hard for college shows to sur
vive? Well, those four years are some of the
most tenuous times for kids as they try to
solidify their identity and prepare for the real
world. This naturally leads to a lot of philo
sophical discussion and soul searching. More
often than not, they just come off as preten
tious and whiny not the best qualities espe
cially if TV writers are trying to get audiences
invested in their characters.
So it's a bit bold of TBS to add the one
hour college dramedy "Glory Daze" to its
schedule, and a period piece at that the
pilot takes place in 1986 at the fictional Hayes
University in Indiana. "Glory Daze" focuses on
freshman Joel (Kelly Blatz) and his first year of
college exploits with his buddies. There's con
servative prepster Jason (Drew Seeley), jock
Brian (Hartley Sawyer) and hyperactive Eli

(Matt Bush you might recognize him from
the übiquitous AT&T commercials a couple
years back). Bush particularly shines as the
dorky Jewish kid eager to shed his loser image
and get laid. "Saturday Night Live" veteran
Tim Meadows is another highlight as acerbic
Professor Haines.
Pilots are generally hard to judge since it
takes a while for shows to find their footing,
and that held true for "Glory Daze." The show
opts for broad, stereotypical characters

Brad Garrett cameos as Joel's well-meaning if
a little overbearing father while Joel's room
mate Zack (Josh Brener) is your stereotypical,
mildly creepy oddball. Pledge recruiter Mike
(Callard Harris) is the standard charismatic
party animal with a heart of gold, essentially
"Glory Daze's" answer to "Greek's" Cappie.
The pilot's fraternity rush premise is just
crude humor and "Animal House" redux, and
'Bos nostalgia pops up in little references like
the aspirations of Jason's girlfriend to some

day work for then-Senate Majority Leader Bob
Dole.
These elements should turn off viewers
who have so many more sophisticated options
on TV. Yet, somehow "Glory Daze" grows on
you and draws you in. The cliches roll off the
back, which allows viewers to welcome the
warm familiarity of the characters. It's the
same kind of loving tolerance set aside for old
'Bos classics which are still revered despite
their oftentimes admittedly hackneyed tripe.
However, "Glory Daze" can't run on the
fumes of nostalgia if it expects to last. It's
already got a predictable "Some Kind of
Wonderful" set-up: Joel's dream girl Christie
(Julianna Guill) is already dating another evil
Omega Sig prepster. Gee, I wonder how long it
will take for the middle class hero to defeat the
mean rich kid. In any case, I'm willing to give
"Glory Daze" a chance, but the premature
cancellations of other new shows like "Lone
Star" should be a kick in the creators' butts.
Right now TBS has "Glory Daze" as a lead-in
for the much buzzed-about "Conan," which
should help in the ratings, but it has a long
ways to go if it wants to avoid the demise of
its collegiate predecessors.
