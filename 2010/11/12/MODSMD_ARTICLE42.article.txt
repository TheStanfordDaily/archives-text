"Ask not what your country
can do for you, ask what you can
do for your country's serving men
and women." More like what you
can do foyour country's serving
men and women, Roxy says.
Roxy is all about service.
Veterans Day, which honors the
men and women in our armed
forces, past and present, is also all
about service. It's a match made
in heaven.
And for those committed to
service while still college students,
ROTC Sass salutes you. (It makes
more sense if you pronounce it
"Rot-C," as some do.) She's a big
fan of the work you do, and, in
thanks, would like to show you
how the plot of "An Officer and a
Gentle-Roxy" might play out with
a little imagination.
But Roxy is only one person,
and this needs to be a campus
wide movement. This Veterans
Day weekend, Roxy encourages all
students to give a little extra TLC
to students in Stanford's ROTC
program for the good of the
country. After all, the benefits of
hooking up with military folk
extend far beyond a more relaxed
and satisfied national fighting
force...
First, the logistical practicali
ties. Roxy knows as soon as she
hears "ROTC" that the specimen
in question has a sweet six-pack
and a good respect for obeying
orders bedroom orders includ-

Ed, she hopes. Roxy also knows
that when her militarily inclined
bedfellow has to get up at 5 a.m.
to haul ass to Santa Clara for
training, Roxy gets to do her walk
of shame in the peace and isola
tion of the early morning, with
enough time back in her own bed
to catch a full REM cycle before
class. And a lifestyle of early
mornings trains a person to be
highly alert even with little sleep
which opens up opportunities
for other bed-oriented activities
during night hours.
And then, of course, the
indisputable fact: ROTC members
are so attractive that it should
really be spelled SEX-C. These
student officers possess weapons
of mass seduction and unlike
Dubya, Roxy's been able to find
them without any trouble. Who
else can hold both innuendo
laced and policy-based discus
sions about missile launches?
Roxy wants to learn how to salute
your flag (pole).
So, everyone have a sexy and
respectful Veterans Day weekend.
These people serve our country;
the least you can do is service
them. It's the call of duty, and
Roxy's ready to answer.
