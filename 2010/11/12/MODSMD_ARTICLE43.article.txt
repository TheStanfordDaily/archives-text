# Fashion 'MOVE!' disappoints

Cecilia Dean, founder and edi

David Colman and Klaus
Biesenbach of The Museum of
Modern Art (MoMA) came together
to curate "MOVE!," a two-day
Halloween weekend of art and fash
ion. The event was held in the New
York MoMA's PSI, the museum's des
ignated space for live art. Each artist
was matched with a designer charged
to produce anything they could
dream up together.
"The point was to do something
action-based and dynamic," Dean said
in an interview. "We didn't want to
hang things on a wall or put dresses
on a mannequin."
All the collaborations were
between artists of the varied disci
plines: visual, performance, dance and
theater artists paired up with New
York-based fashion designers. Some
notable collaborators were Kalup
Linzy and Diane von Furstenberg,
Rob Pruitt and Marc lacobs, Olaf
Breuning and Cynthia Rowley, Brody
Condon and Rodarte, Rashaad
Newsome and Alexander Wang, and
Dan Colen and Proenza Schouler.
As much as I find the intersec
tion between art and fashion fascinat
ing and important to explore, many of
the collaborations seemed unbal
anced. Most of the partnerships
picked one or the other, namely art.
The clothing became a costume for
the performance piece, which should
not be confused with fashion.
In the case of Alexander Wang
and Rashaad Newsome, 18 women
performed in an orchestra made up of
snaps and breaths. The fact that they
were clothed was about as involved as
Alexander Wang got to be. Similarly,
the Mulleavy sisters (Rodarte), with all
of their design talent, put white sacks
over performers moving in space with
big metal rods. Diane von
Furstenberg, creator of the wrap dress,
gave a sparkly one to Linzy, the per
formance artist known for acting out
soap operas in drag.
Injustice aside, this hierarchy of
art was just absurd. The format of this
exhibit put the artists in a weird posi
tion of separating out fashion as just
the garment and the art part as the
performance, which places the artistic
innovation on the movement itself,
rendering the clothes irrelevant.
Some of the more interesting
pieces managed to stray from the cos
tumed performance route with vary
ing degrees of success. Cynthia
Rowley and Olaf Breuning took their
assignment perfectly literally, pouring

paint onto garment: art + fashion!
Rowley designed over 40 pieces to be
worn and covered in paint, which was
doused onto each subject by Breuning
himself, perched atop a ladder. While
not exactly groundbreaking, the piece
was deliberate in paring both disci
plines down to paint and dress and
showed the process in an interactive
way.
Moving outside of the studio,
Dan Colen and Proenza Schouler
placed garments throughout New
York City embedded with video cam
eras, which live-streamed its feed into
the MoMA space, documenting the
life of the piece for two days. Here
fashion, as it exists in the world, was
transported back into viewable art,
making the most intellectual state
ment on the relationship between art
and fashion, instead of oversimplify
ing and attempting to differentiate the
two.
My main issue with the exhibit as
a whole was its insistence on the dif
ference between art and fashion. As if
saying here, at the MoMA for two
nights only: art and fashion are
together now for the first time.
Fashion is art, is influenced by art, is
informed by art and is surrounded by
art. Fashion shows are their own sin
gular performance art pieces. Art is
present in the craft of the garment
and in the design of the presentation.
Throughout the history of fash
ion, designers have been taking inspi
ration from art and interacting with
artists of all disciplines in creating
their own collections. This is not a
new, isolated or forced instance; it is as
it has always been. The exhibit called
itself dynamic, interactive, art plus
fashion, but that isn't just paint on a
dress, it is fashion itself out in the
world. Art in fashion is real, it lives, it
moves: me, you, we are the art object.
