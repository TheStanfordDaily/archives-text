## UNIVERSITY LBRE proposing to uproot farm for new driving range 
### ELLEN HUET MANAGING EDITOR 
The Stanford Community Farm might see it
self relocated in the next year to make room for a
new driving range, according to University offi
cials and members of the farm.
The farm, currently located near Searsville
Road and the Emergency Safety Facility, spans
about one acre and is nestled next to the practice
golf course. In plans to redevelop west campus,
new housing projects may displace the current
driving range, and University officials are propos
ing placing the new driving range on the current
farm site.
Under the University's general use permit
from Santa Clara County, the current driving
range is zoned for housing use, said Charles
Carter, director of Land Use and Environmental
Planning.
"One of the major housing sites on west cam
pus is the current driving range," Carter said. "At
some point it'll have to expand to keep up with
housing needs."
"Athletics has proposed to relocate the driving
range to the practice golf facility that surrounds
the Community Farm," Carter added.
Representatives from Land, Building and
Real Estate (LBRE) and the farm met on Oct. 25
to discuss the possibility of relocation. LBRE
asked the farm to compile more information
about the farm's demographics, uses, needs and
more for the next meeting to be held in coming
weeks.

Since the proposal is still in early stages, LBRE
officials are vague about the timeline and possi
ble locations in play, while farm members ex
press concerns about the possible outcomes of
relocation.

"It's a little touchy," Carter said. "Nothing spe
cific has been approved by the Board of Trustees
yet. But in looking at the long-range picture, this
is likely to play out."
Daniel Murray, a member of the farm and a
third-year doctoral student in modern thought
and literature, said that the University had not yet
made any definitive statements if the farm will be
relocated and if so, where its new location might
be.
"Some options that were presented and dis
cussed are the Searsville lot (the current location
of the horse track and stables) or a location out
side of the central campus," Murray wrote in an e
mail to The Daily. "The University appears to be
proceeding carefully in their discussions with the
farm, but we have no real idea where the plans
stand. For all we know the relocation of the farm
is a done deal and we are the last to know."
Carter said that there are "no specific sites
yet."
"I did mention to the farm that as campus de
velops, it's going to be harder and harder to find
land in central campus for that particular use," he
said.
Murray said that if the farm were to move,
maintaining a location on the central campus
would help the farm increase its involvement in
the larger Stanford community.
"At this point we very much hope that the farm
can stay either in its current location or elsewhere
on the central campus, rather than move to a
satellite location," he said. "Such a move will
greatly decrease the connection with the Stanford
community and the possibility for involvement of
busy faculty, staff and students."
For Matt Rothe, who has worked a plot in the
garden with his wife for almost four years, a move
would disrupt the land use at the farm.
"I'd personally prefer to stay where we are,

given the time and money we've invested in de
veloping the fertility of our soil, erecting struc
tures like raised beds, and growing perennial
plants that in many cases take years to mature and
can't be moved," Rothe wrote in an e-mail to The
Daily.
But, he added, he remains hopeful that if the
farm is moved, the University would take the
chance to provide additional resources to the
farm, which has all its plots spoken for and has a
waiting list of more than 40 faculty, staff and stu
dents who would like to get involved but cannot
because of space constraints.
As for a potential timeline of a move, Carter
said that there's "not a concrete timeline," though
farm members say that in discussions, LB RE pro
posed a possible date in spring 2011 for reloca
tion, which caused some concern.
"At the farm, we feel that this [possible spring
relocation date] will be too early as any new area
will take a great amount of soil and infrastructure
preparation before moving the Farm can hap
pen," Murray said. "We feel that we need a longer
timeline if a move were to happen and would
need considerable resources to do so."
Although plans are far from final. Carter said
that it seems unlikely that a new driving range
would be placed anywhere else on campus.
"I don't know that there are any other [possi
ble locations for the driving range]," he said, ex
plaining that the range would need to be near the
practice golf course and that other locations in
west campus are limited by building permits.
Carter could not comment on funding sources
for potential housing projects that might replace
the current driving range, saying that housing
project funding usually comes from University
endowment and donors.
