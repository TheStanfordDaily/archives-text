## Bike sharing program to launch in five Bay Area cities 
### DANA EDWARDS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Metropolitan Transportation
Commission (MTC) plans to imple
ment a pilot bike-sharing program in
the Bay Area in an effort to reduce
pollution. The project will deploy
1,000 bicycles at up to 100 kiosks in
San Francisco, Redwood City,
Menlo Park, Palo Alto and San Jose
in the next year or so.
Kiosks will be installed at Cal
train stations along the peninsula
transportation corridor, as well as in
strategic locations throughout the
cities.
Initially, 50 kiosks with 500 bicy

cles will be stationed in San Francis
co around Market Street, the Fi
nancial District, the Civic Center
and a few other locations. The re
maining kiosks and bikes will be
placed along the peninsula near
major universities, downtown areas,
business parks, and other busy lo
cales. Each kiosk will hold around 10
bikes.

The system will work much like
car-sharing programs such as Zipcar.
Commuters will pay an annual sub
scription fee, allowing them to
"check out" bikes from kiosks using
radio frequency-equipped smart
cards. For no additional charge, they
will be able to use the bikes for a
short period of time up to an hour

before "checking in" at a kiosk
near their final destination.

An incremental charge will be
administered for going over the al
lotted time. Electronic reser
vation will also be an option, and
payment amounts will be deter
mined at a later date.
"You won't take your bike with
you on the Bart or the Caltrain," said
Aaron Richardson, spokesperson
for the Management District.
"Rather, the program is away of
completing the commute."
The chief goal of the program is
to get cars off the roads to curb car
bon emissions in the Bay Area,
where, according to an October 27
press release by the MTC, trans
portation accounts for more than
half of air pollution.
"The project aims to demonstrate
how regional bike-sharing can im
prove air quality through the esti
mated reduction of approximately
3.1 tons per year in criteria pollu
tants and 1583 tons per year in
GHGs from the initial deployment,"
Richardson wrote in an e-mail to
The Daily.
In addition to environmental
benefits, the program has other po
tential draws.
"Bike sharing that works region
ally as well as in San Francisco will
provide greater connectivity and
make the system more useful," said
Mayor Gavin Newsom in the press
release. "As bicycling increases in
San Francisco and the Bay Area, key
projects like this will encourage oth
ers to add bicycling to their travel so
lutions."
The program could also promote
physical health by adding more car
diovascular activity to the com
muters' daily routines.
Funds were made available to the
program through the Climate Initia
tives Competitive Grants Program,
implemented by the MTC in June
2010, which called for innovative so
lutions to reduce greenhouse gas
emissions in the Bay Area.
As of now, the program has over
$7 million in funding from the MTC,
the Bay Area Air Quality Manage
ment District (BAAQMD) and
other partners.
The bikes will be procured "fol
lowing a formal competitive bidding
process to select a vendor or ven
dors," Richardson wrote. He said he
wasn't sure what types of bikes
would be provided, but he added
that GPS units may be installed to
deter theft.
Similar programs exist through
out the nation and the world in
Chicago and Denver, among other
cities but the deployment will be
the "first of its kind in California and

the largest regional effort in the na
tion," Richardson said.
That only accounts for the initial
deployment. If the pilot is success
ful, the MTC, in conjunction with
the BAAQMD, plans to expand the
program to all nine counties in the
region.
"The project will provide a range
of 'lessons learned,' demonstrate vi
ability of bike-sharing in the Bay
Area and under what conditions it
can be most successful (i.e., demo

graphics, terrain, size of project
within each hub) that will be useful
to the region and cities along trans
portation routes that are consider
ing bike-sharing," wrote Richard
son.
The pilot program is still in its
early stages, but Richardson expects
that the bikes will be in place and
ready to ride by the end of 2011.
