## Gaming until the sun comes up How Local Area Network (LAN) parties bring Stanford students together 
### CHRISTINA BROW 
It's 2 a.m. on a Friday night in
Ricker Dining. As FroSoCo
students pass by the entrance,
they take a peak inside to see
where the music they hear is
coming from. What do they find?
Clusters of Stanford students
sprawled across tables with their
computers, snacks and Ethernet
cords, gaming to their hearts' con
tent.
These FroSoCo students stum
bled across the most recent of the
Stanford Local Area Network
(LAN) parties, which offer away for
students to enjoy gaming in what
might otherwise be a solo activity.
A coordinator of the party,
Michael Christensen-Calvin 'l2 de
scribed LAN parties as, "when a
bunch of people bring their comput
ers and games and play."
The gaming usually takes place in
dining halls, where students connect
their computers and play online
games in teams of two to five.
Christensen-Calvin and Michael
Rosenbloom 'l2 organize quarterly
gaming parties on campus and are
working to make LAN parties an of
ficial ASSU student group.
"We're trying to become an
ASSU-funded group, which would
allow our ResComp LAN group to
have more than one party per term,"
Christensen-Calvin said. "As of right

now, we only get $lOO every quarter.
With more money, we could not only
have more parties, but also more
food and even Red Bull."
Rosenbloom described some of
the other ideas that he and Chris
tensen-Calvin have considered im
plementing with more ASSU fund
ing.
"With the money, we might plan
tournaments," he said. "This would
give the parties a more competitive
aspect with prizes. Also, we could
raise money for Child's Play, a chari
ty that provides games for hospi
tals."
Christensen-Calvin said he
spreads word about the LAN parties
by using list serves, and news of the
parties spreads virally.
"LAN parties are the best oppor
tunities to bring many people to
gether to play," said Melissa Suss
mann-Martinez 'l3. "If you're on the
same team, it's easier to talk to each
other in person and strategize."
Albert Lai 'l2 also felt that the
gaming experience is enhanced by a
group environment.
"When you play team games at
LAN parties, you can see the other
person face to face rather than call
ing, which makes the game more
fun," Lai said.
A current gaming favorite on
campus is League of Legends, Suss
mann-Martinez said, describing the
game as similar to Defense of the
Ancients (DotA), a version of War

craft 111. Other popular games in
clude Halo, Super Smash Bros.,
Rock Band and Star Craft.
Paisley Zelaya 'l3 described her
favorite game, Star Craft.

"It's a real-time strategy game,"
she said. "I started playing it in sixth
grade. It's so old, yet still cool. I'm
not really into shooter games, and
Star Craft is a game for everyone."
But a night of gaming isn't for the
faint of heart, as staying up to play
games often means not taking any
breaks to sleep.
"This unofficial LAN part last
year went from 9 p.m. to 5 a.m.,"
Christensen-Calvin. "It was a lot of
fun."

Wong 'lO, considered
Ithe founder of LAN parties at Stan
ford, said she started organizing
LAN parties two years ago in order
to make them a more regular option
on campus. She saw LAN parties as
away to bypass the need for stu
dents to have to find other gamers to
play with on their own, which can
sometimes be a challenge.
"I started these parties with the
intention of dispelling the stigma of
gaming," she said. "When one thinks
of gaming, one imagines a person sit
ting in his or her room in front of a
computer screen, playing a game by
him or herself. I want LAN parties to
be a social event that removes pres-
about going to a frat party."
Rosenbloom said LAN parties
help break down the perception of
gaming as antisocial and create an
for people with a com
mon interest in gaming to meet each
other.
t "LAN parties bring together
people that usually don't get togeth
er," he said. "The purpose of LAN
parties is to get all of the people, so

cial and shy, to play the games."
Although LAN parties can have
technical winners, Christensen-
Calvin said his main goal is to simply
let students have fun.
Stephanie Young 'l4 said she ap
preciated the relaxed environment
at the parties. "Students at Stanford
are very good at video games, but
they're not too intense," she said.

Lai described why he appreciates
the social environment of the par
ties.
"It's nice not to spend the entire
time in your dorm gaming by your
self," he said. "Sometimes it's nice to
geek out."
