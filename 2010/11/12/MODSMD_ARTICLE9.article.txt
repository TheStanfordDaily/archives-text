## EDITORIAL Three things the new Congress can get done 
### 
In the aftermath of vicious election rheto
ric following two years of intractable
gridlock, it is difficult to see anything but
political disagreement. But in between,
there still exist several areas of ideological
overlap between Republicans and Democ
rats. On these issues, the next two years offer
a stark choice between continuing the poli
tics of gridlock and developing actual policy
solutions. If governing can trump politics,
here are three issues the 112 th Congress
should pursue.
Energy Investment. Republicans and
several coal-state Democrats resoundingly
shot down cap-and-trade proposals to
make dirty energy more expensive. But the
next best alternative, making clean energy
cheaper through various incentives and
greatly increased federal funding for re
search and development, might have a bet
ter chance. While this idea still has a long
way to go among many Republicans, sup
port has sprouted from several sources.
The conservative American Enterprise In
stitute recently released a report advocat
ing $25 billion per year in federal funding
for clean energy development. Several Re
publican senators, including Lamar
Alexander of Tennessee, Orrin Hatch of
Utah, Richard Lugar of Indiana and Lind
sey Graham of South Carolina have voiced
support and introduced bills in this direc
tion, and the U.S. military has consistently
called for moves to clean energy. If others
value economic, security and climate con
cerns more than denying President Obama
a political victory, they might be willing to
come on board as well.
Tax Reform. Virtually every economist
would agree that the corporate tax code is
remarkably inefficient. Despite a marginal
tax rate way above the world average, the
U.S. takes a far lower percentage of revenue
from the tax due to a series of loopholes and

deductions. Removing deductions and re
ducing the marginal rate could encourage
business investment, improve the economy
and increase tax revenues. This idea will be a
win-win unless politics get in the way.
Reducing Long-Run Deficits. This one
will be tricky, but its importance cannot be
overstated. When President Obama's bipar
tisan fiscal commission releases a final list of
proposed spending cuts and tax increases on
Dec. 1, many of the provisions are likely to
be unpopular. Already, political objections
are cropping up. Democratic groups like the
Progressive Change Campaign Committee
have demonized any adjustments to Social
Security as "a policy disaster and a monu
mental political blunder." Similarly, many
Republicans have made untenable and
mathematically impossible pledges to re
duce deficits with no tax increases or cuts to
defense spending.
But if a bipartisan group commissioned
by a Democratic president suggests a pack
age of 75 percent spending cuts and 25 per
cent tax increases, this might be the best
chance we will get to restore our nation's fis
cal health. On defense spending, several Re
publican senators, including Tom Coburn of
Oklahoma, Rand Paul of Kentucky, Mark
Kirk of Illinois, Johnny Isakson of Georgia
and Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania have fol
lowed the lead of Secretary of Defense
Robert Gates and chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff Mike Mullen in calling for
substantial cuts of up to $lOO billion per
year. On entitlements, the Democrats on this
commission have shown flexibility and
openness to reform. With the parties split
ting power in Congress, the opportunity to
make difficult choices might never be better.
Party leaders must identify the areas
where agreement can be reached and push
relentlessly for compromise, because Amer
ica literally cannot afford more inaction.
