Two months after publishing the 2010 Knight-Risser Prize winning story "Chain-Saw
Scouting," the Seattle Post-Intelligencer closed its presses and laid off most of its
newsroom. Thus it joined a list of U.S. newspapers—l 66 since 2008 —that have shut
down, including the 2005 prize-winning Rocky Mountain News. As the decline of news
papers intensifies, who will move to fill the gap in hard-hitting investigative reporting on
environmental and resource issues in the West? Former P-l reporter Lewis Kamb and a
panel of journalists discuss the evolving landscape of non-profit startups, independents,
crowd-funding, blogs, educational partnerships and surviving news organizations.
Wednesday, Nov. 17, 4:15-6:oopm
Paul Brest Hall East, Stanford University
Munger Graduate Residence, Building 4
555 Salvatierra Walk
The discussion will be followed by a public reception.
