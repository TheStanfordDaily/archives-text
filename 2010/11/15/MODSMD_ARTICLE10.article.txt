## EDITORIAL Let's beat the Bears 
### 
This weekend almost wreaked havoc
on the infamous Bowl Champi
onship Series. When No. 2 Auburn
and No. 3 TCU came from two touchdowns
behind to earn hard-fought victories and
No. 1 Oregon squeaked by with a two-point
win after Cal missed a short fourth-quarter
field goal, the powers of college football
breathed a sigh of relief. If those three teams
had gone down, the projected national
championship game would likely have been
undefeated Boise State against . . .
whichever one-loss team the voters and
computers happened to like best.
In the end, the chance to play for the title
will be decided off the field by a system that
has astounded us with its capriciousness.
Consider that over the last four weeks,
Boise State has fallen from No. 3 to No. 4
while winning four blowouts by a com
bined 150 points. And how exactly are we
so sure Oregon deserves to be ahead of a
Bronco team that throttled the Ducks last
year and returned all but one starter?
Why so much confusion? Because the
system that determines the winners and los
ers in college football is just a glorified
guessing game. That's why we've had a
shared national championship and an unde
feated team (Utah in the 2009 Sugar Bowl)
destroying the No. 4 team in a bowl game
without getting a chance to play for it all.
That's why we have utterly inane conversa
tions about style points (e.g., praising coach
es for running up the score mercilessly on
inferior opponents) and speculate about
BCS bowl games looking for teams that
"travel well" when deciding who deserves

an at-large bid.
It is in this context that our beloved
Stanford Cardinal (9-1, No. 6 BCS) comes
into its final two games of the season
against Cal and Oregon State. With only
one loss on the road to the nation's top
ranked team, the Cardinal, who several
ESPN pundits called the best one-loss
team in the country, has earned the right to
play in a marquee bowl game. If a couple of
bounces had fallen differently for the top
three teams on Saturday, the Cardinal
would have been in a position to argue it
deserved a shot to play for the title. In
stead, Stanford is left hoping that a set of
archaic rules and biased voters don't rele
gate it to the Alamo Bowl.
Of course, the Cardinal must win its
final two games against a tough Oregon
State team and this Saturday in Berkeley
against a Cal squad coming off a near
upset of Oregon. And we as a university
must be there to support them. Yes, the
games are over Thanksgiving break, and
there might be some high expectations of
Red Zone points for Big Game, but every
one who can go to these games must do so.
This has been one of the best seasons of
Stanford football in memory, and if the en
thusiasm of our fans is one metric that will
affect the team's chances to play in the
right bowl, it would be a shame if we con
strained their success. The weak fan sup
port in our biggest home win against Ari
zona earned us the derision of the sports
world. This weekend is Cal don't let it
happen again. Let's show up, let's be loud
and let's beat the Bears.
