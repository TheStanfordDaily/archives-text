# THE
						TRANSITIVE PROPERTY
## Remembering Our Dead 
### Cristopher Bautista 
This Friday marks the 12th annual In
ternational Transgender Day of Re
membrance. On this day, people from
across the world gather and remember all
those transgender people who have been
killed this year due to hate and prejudice.
According to the official International
Transgender Day of Remembrance website,
the official count during the year of 2009
was 98 murders however, the actual
number is much higher than that, simply be
cause many murders are not reported.
This time of the year is always difficult
for me. The first TDoR vigil I attended was
during my sophomore year, in 2008. I re
member it clearly we were still reeling
from the passing of Prop 8. It was well past
sunset, and we gathered in the sculpture
garden by Roble. We stood in a circle and
passed around a list of the transgender peo
ple who had been killed that year. One by
one, we read each name, their date of death
and how they were murdered.
I was on the verge of coming out to my
self then. And I was terrified. I remember
how scared I was then, listening to name
after name, murder after murder. These
were not just names. These were people
who were just trying to live their lives, peo
ple who deserved to be happy, who de
served to be loved, who deserved a good
job, a decent education, a family people
like me. But they were dead, because some
one thought they didn't deserve to live.
I admit I am lucky. I have lived within an
hour of San Francisco all my life. I go to a
school that accepts me, who knows me by
my preferred name. I am able to write this
column. I have family and friends who love
me. Who knows, if the circumstances
weren't right, if I had lived someplace else,
met the wrong people, found myself in one
bad night, one slip-up, one encounter with
someone a bit too ignorant or a bit too
drunk I could have easily become one of
those names read out loud by candlelight.
But I'm not. I'm still here. I'm still alive.
And I know it's weird to say this, but at
times, I'm surprised that I've lasted this
long. Why was I left here, when so many
other people were taken away? It seemed
so random.
This is a society that assumes a gender
binary, that assumes this strict divide be
tween male and female, that men must act
this way, and women must act this way, and
anything that mixes the two is weird, unnat
ural, shouldn't exist. It is a mindset that per
vades the subconscious of our culture, and
it is this mindset that kills gender-variant
people and those who do not so neatly fit

into those little checkboxes marked "male"
and "female." I remember back as a sopho
more, at that vigil, I felt helpless, that there
was nothing I could do to stop these mur
ders. In retrospect, I suppose it was this mo
ment in my life, as this scared little 19-year
old, that motivated me to write this column.
As I grew older, I realized that if some cos
mic force is keeping me alive, then I'm not
going to waste a moment. People like Bran
don Teena, Gwen Araujo, Rita Hester and
countless others who have been forgotten
can no longer speak for themselves, be
cause they are no longer here. But I'm still
here. And I'm going to keep writing. I'm
going to keep talking. The only way any
one's going to shut me up is if I'm dead.
(And I'm not planning that anytime soon,
trust me.)
In 38 states, it is still legal to fire or not
hire an individual due to gender identity. The
Employment Non-Discrimination Act still
does not include transgender rights. And
every year, more and more trans people are
getting killed for simply being who they are.
It doesn't have to be this way. There's still so
much that needs to be done. As much as I
would like to, I can't do all this alone. Sol ask
you to use gender-neutral pronouns. Think
about the forms you have to fill out on a
daily basis. If you are presented with those
stress-inducing M/F checkboxes, don't check
either, or if you see there is a third box that
states "decline to state" or "other," check
that instead. Bring up this column in a con
versation today or this week. And when you
talk about LGBT rights, don't forget the last
letter in the acronym. I remember a friend of
mine telling me that the "T" in "LGBT"
stands for "terrific" because hell, we are
terrific people, and terrific people deserve to
be happy.
I know this week is Big Game week, and
I'm excited as you about Stanford shanking
Cal this Saturday. However, I ask that you
take one moment and remember. It will
mean a lot.
