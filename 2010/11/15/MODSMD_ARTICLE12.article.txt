## The 						Problem of Four Loko 
### David Spencer 
Four Loko is the alcohol craze that's
sweeping the nation. At 12 percent
ABV, one 24-ounce Four Loko is a
powerful drink, the equivalent of about four
or five normal beer cans. With caffeine, tau
rine, guarana and a massive amount of sugar,
Four Loko has some unpredictable effects
along with its sheer alcoholic power. Also, at
$2.50 a can, it's very attractive to college stu
dents and easy to consume in large quanti
ties.
It is said that the combination of alcohol
and caffeine, along with sugar that masks the
taste of alcohol, makes drinkers less aware of
their own inebriation and therefore more
likely to attempt to drive or make other reck
less decisions. Mixing alcohol, a depressant,
with caffeine, a stimulant, has been linked to
excessive consumption and alcohol poison
ing, irresponsible behavior and drunk driving.
The effects of Four Loko aren't well known,
but the drink has been slowly accumulating a
reputation for the hijinks it causes, as the web
site Four Loko Stories can attest.
As its popularity has increased, Four Loko
has been blamed for a growing number of un
pleasant incidents on college campuses. Es
pecially in the last few months, there has
been an incredibly strong reaction to the
growing popularity of the drink. Numerous
universities, among them Brandeis, North
eastern and Boston Universities, have
warned their students about the dangers of

Four Loko and similar alcoholic energy
drinks. Others, like the University of Rhode
Island and Ramapo College (NJ), have
banned the drink altogether. Ramapo had 17
students and 6 visitors hospitalized because
of Four Loko before it took steps toward re
moving it from campus. At the moment, it
seems likely that Four Loko bans will spread
across collegiate America.
The knee-jerk reaction to substances one
judges dangerous is to ban them. However,
this is an incomplete solution. Especially at
universities, which serve, if not to prepare
students for the realities of adult life, at least
to equip them to use adult freedom to its best
ends, banning substances that students will
face in later life is a poor answer to problems
like the Four Loko problem. The answer for
universities like Stanford is, fittingly enough,
education.
Stanford is known for having an alcohol
policy that, uniquely and rightly, treats its stu
dents like responsible adults. That treatment
should extend to the issue of Four Loko.
Much like it doesn't ban books, Stanford
shouldn't hastily ban Four Loko. Stanford
teaches students to understand the value of
books with hateful and dangerous rhetoric,
and, just the same, Stanford should equip stu
dents with the skills to enjoy beverages like
Four Loko (if they want to), which can be
dangerous, in a responsible manner. Banning
drinks like Four Loko implies that students

don't have the necessary skills to deal with
these substances.
That implication itself shows a need for ed
ucation. Stanford students will most likely
graduate into a world where alcoholic energy
drinks are legal or available. We should know
how to drink them or at least know why we
should abstain from them.
Stanford has not been affected by the Four
Loko craze so strongly. However, the popu
lar, sugary drink will probably breach the
Stanford bubble soon enough. Stanford
should not succumb to the knee-jerk urge to
ban it. Rather, Stanford should react know
ing that, armed with the proper information,
its students can learn to use Four Loko in a
safe way.
The University should never take it upon
itself to deny us any of the privileges of an
adult in the United States. It should not be a
parental figure in the lives of its students.
Stanford's administration should only inter
est itself with ensuring that all students have
the tools to safeguard their own well being.
Stanford students themselves should be en
trusted with the decision of whether or not
they wish to consume Four Loko and similar
substances. The University's mission should
be to arm them with the necessary knowl
edge to decide and act as informed people.
