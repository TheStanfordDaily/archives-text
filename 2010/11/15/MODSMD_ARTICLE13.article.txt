## Repealing "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" Does Not End Military Discrimination 
### CHARLES LEDBETTER, graduate student, with contributions from JANANI BALASUBRAMANIAN '12 Written on behalf of Stanford Students for Queer Liberation 
Forty years after Stanford University's
phase-out of the Reserve Officers'
Training Corps (ROTC), based on mass
protest, punitive clauses in student contracts
and concerns about the academic compatibil
ity of its courses, a Stanford University Facul
ty Senate ad hoc committee is investigating
the possibility of reintroducing ROTC to the
University, pursuant to the repeal of "Don't
Ask, Don't Tell," (DADT) the U.S. military
policy mandating the discharge of service
members known (or discovered) to be homo
sexual. The Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Ap
peals has ordered a stay on implementing
DADT's repeal, leaving the issue in legal
limbo.
In reading the available information on
DADT for Stanford University, the proposal's
sponsors apparently have little interest in the
outcome of DADT and provide no material
link between the repeal of DADT and the re
instatement of ROTC in the actual proposal.
From the outset, the implication that ROTC
would be reinstated on the condition that
DADT is repealed is patently false.
In fact, in the Senate minutes, Dr. Stephen
Krasner urges fellow Senate members to rein
state ROTC regardless of the fate of DADT:
"If we go forward with this [ROTC], I would
urge the committee to not make it hostage to
what happens to 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell.'" The
link between DADT and ROTC at Stanford is
at best, artificial, and at worst, misleading.
Not only do Senate members demonstrate

an indifference to DADT, even as they co-opt
its language, they also betray barely concealed
contempt for proponents of its repeal.
Dr. David Kennedy states: "The premise
that underlies our bringing this question to the
Senate is the assumption that the 'Don't Ask,
Don't Tell Policy", which has been a serious im
pediment to reopening this discussion at all,
will probably go away within the next year or
two, and the field will be open to have a rea
sonable discussion." (Italics added.)
Does a "reasonable discussion" mean that
a bunch of liberal. Bay Area intellectuals
won't be so hung up on institutional discrimi
nation in the military? Had the presenters any
interest in human rights, they would realize
that the repeal of DADT does not end recruit
ment discrimination against LGBT people.
Transgender individuals are categorically ex
cluded by outdated medical regulations. In ad
dition to this kind of outmoded de jure dis
crimination, the military disproportionately
recruits the poor, people of color and recent
immigrants to say nothing of the endemic
gender discrimination highlighted in recent
high-profile abuse cases.
In this regard, the "serious impediment" to
reinstating ROTC, that is that the military will
no longer practice discriminatory practices
which conflict with Stanford's anti-discrimi
nation policies, is false. Until the military suc
cessfully addresses its endemic official and un
official forms of discrimination, then ROTC,
which is subject to the military's recruitment

criteria, will violate Stanford's commitment to
"prohibit discrimination, including harass
ment, against students on the basis of sex, race,
age, color, disability, religion, sexual orienta
tion, gender identity, national and ethnic ori
gin" (Statement of Non-Discrimination Poli
cy).
Accordingly, Stanford Students for Queer
Liberation holds the following position on
ROTC:
We oppose the reintroduction of ROTC at
Stanford for two reasons. First, we adamantly
oppose any dialogue on this issue until DADT
has been repealed at the federal level, as this
legislation is in direct opposition to Stanford's
non-discrimination policies and mission. Sec
ond, as an organization that supports a radical
queer political framework, we oppose ROTC
as a representation of militarism. The United
States military is an institution steeped in
racism, sexism and other oppressive systems
in both its recruiting practices and everyday
functions, and thus we do not feel it in our in
terests to support the ROTC program even
after the repeal of DADT. We hope that other
social justice-oriented student groups will find
common ground on this issue and similarly
work against the militarization of our campus.
