## SWEET SIXTEEN UP NEXT 
### NATE ADAMS BROOKE DAVIS 
Stanford women's soccer is headed to the
round of 16 in the NCAA Tournament after tak
ing down Sacramento State and Santa Clara in
two very different games over the weekend.
After more than 30 shots, Stanford was able
to break through for a goal against Sacramento
State in Friday's tournament opener. Freshman
Sidney Payne knocked in the winning score and
assisted on two later goals for the top-seeded
Cardinal, while classmate and goalkeeper Emily
Oliver secured the 3-0 shutout. All of Stanford's
goals Payne's, along with two more from
freshman Taylor McCann and sophomore Nina
Watkins came from freshmen or players off
the bench.
Stanford (20-0-2) had more than its share of
chances in the first half, when the Cardinal out
shot the Flornets (9-10-1) by a margin of 19-2.
But for every look that Stanford had, it either
just missed the mark or was turned away by Hor
net keeper Savannah Abercrombie.
Stanford coach Paul Ratcliffe, who led Stan
ford over Sacramento State by a score of 7-0 in
2007, had nothing but praise for the Hornets' de
fensive tenacity.
"I was very impressed with Sacramento
State; I think [head coach] Randy [Dedini] or
ganized his team with a great game plan," he
said. "Their team really battled hard and made it
a really tough game, and obviously their goal
keeper was really tremendous in the first half
and in the second half. She made some spectac
ular saves."
It took an unusual play for the Cardinal to fi
nally break through. In the 65th minute, sopho
more defender Rachel Quon sent a cross from
the right side into the box, where Payne made a
quick spin move before tapping it past Aber
crombie with a back-heel. For Payne, who was
subbed in just a few minutes earlier, it was the
second goal of her freshman season. Along with
Quon, junior defender Camille Levin was cred
ited with an assist.
The goal came in a flash, and Payne said she
relied mostly on instinct to make the game-win
ning reaction.
"I think I hit it with my back-heel," she said.
"I just tried to make contact and get the goal."
Ratcliffe was happy to defend his choice of
substituting Payne, who he says has been making
great strides in practice.
"Sydney's been training very, very well, and
she's been getting better and better as a player,"
he said. "I knew she could go in and score the
goal; there was no doubt in my mind that she
could break the ice for us, and she did."
With eight minutes to go, McCann knocked
in some insurance for Stanford. After recovering
a Payne rebound in the box amidst a flurry of de
fenders, McCann powered a shot that deflected
off a sliding Hornet defender into the right side
of the goal.
A few minutes later, after knocking a center
ing pass onto the box, Watkins fired a header
from a few yards out to beat Abercrombie on the
left side. It was the first goal of Watkins' colle
giate career.
"It's great to have players that can come in,
especially freshmen, and have a big impact and
score goals for us," Ratcliffe said. "It's great for
the team spirit, and it's a credit to the freshmen
that they've worked so hard this year and been
so tremendous for us."
The tournament continued as the Card took
on local rival Santa Clara (13-7-2) on Sunday af
ternoon in a rematch of last year's hard-fought
Sweet Sixteen matchup. Tensions were high, and
the game was full of pressure and physicality, but

in the end, Stanford managed to defeat the
Broncos, 2-1, and secure its place in the next
round of the tournament.
Stanford started the game on the attack and
kept the pressure on, resulting in an early goal.
In the 19th minute, redshirt freshman Annie
Case drove down the left side before sending in
a pinpoint cross to Marjani Hing-Glover. The
forward, who was in the starting lineup with
sophomore Courtney Verloo out due to injury,
expertly timed her jump and hit a crisp, left-foot
ed volley past Santa Clara goalkeeper Bianca
Henninger from the top of the box.
"I wanted to prove myself and show what I
can do." Hing-Glover said.
"Marjani had a great weekend," said senior
forward Christen Press. "We call her shot "the
'Jani Rocket," and it just rocketed right into the
net."
Stanford remained the aggressor, but Santa
Clara was still very much in the game. The Bron
cos only had two shots in the first half, but Me
leana Shim's free kick off the crossbar was a
warning. Both teams played very physically, rid
dling the field with free kicks and falling players.
In the 15th minute, Press was taken down by
Santa Clara defender Margueritte Aozasa, who
grabbed Press's ponytail and yanked her to the
turf. Despite the high pressure, Stanford kept the
score at 1-0 at the half.
Just four minutes into the second half, it was
2-0 in favor of the Cardinal. Junior Lindsay Tay
lor swung in a corner kick, and sophomore cen
ter back Alina Garciamendez beat her marker
to power a low header into the net. It was the
first goal of the season for the Mexican national
teamer, and it would prove to be vital.
Despite dominant play from Stanford after
the second goal, the game's next goal was scored
by Santa Clara. Kendra Perry received the ball
at the top of the box, turned and hit a low left
footed drive past Oliver into the corner of the
goal. Just like that, Santa Clara had a lifeline.
"We had a lot of chances," Ratcliffe said. "We
didn't execute, and their goalkeeper made some
great saves. We let them hang around, and they
scored a goal late, and it became a game."
The goal shifted the momentum, and Stan
ford went from cruise control to hanging on.
Stanford's defense was able to hold on, preserv
ing the 2-1 victory and a spot in the Sweet Six
teen.

The Cardinal will host UCLA in the round of
16 at 7 p.m. on Friday at Laird Q. Cagan Stadi
um.

Junior midfielder Kristy Zurmuhlen (18) looks for a header. After defeating Sacramento State
and Santa Clara, Stanford will host UCLA in round-three play of the NCAA Tournament.

Stanford women's soccer is headed to the
round of 16 in the NCAA Tournament after tak

two very different games over the weekend.
After more than 30 shots, Stanford was able
to break through for a goal against Sacramento

But for every look that Stanford had, it either

the game was full of pressure and physicality, but

in the end, Stanford managed to defeat the
Broncos, 2-1, and secure its place in the next
round of the tournament.
Stanford started the game on the attack and
kept the pressure on, resulting in an early goal.
In the 19th minute, redshirt freshman Annie
Case drove down the left side before sending in
a pinpoint cross to Marjani Hing-Glover. The
forward, who was in the starting lineup with
sophomore Courtney Verloo out due to injury,
expertly timed her jump and hit a crisp, left-foot
ed volley past Santa Clara goalkeeper Bianca
Henninger from the top of the box.
"I wanted to prove myself and show what I
can do." Hing-Glover said.
"Marjani had a great weekend," said senior
forward Christen Press. "We call her shot "the
'Jani Rocket," and it just rocketed right into the
net."
Stanford remained the aggressor, but Santa
Clara was still very much in the game. The Bron
cos only had two shots in the first half, but Me
leana Shim's free kick off the crossbar was a
warning. Both teams played very physically, rid
dling the field with free kicks and falling players.
In the 15th minute, Press was taken down by
Santa Clara defender Margueritte Aozasa, who
grabbed Press's ponytail and yanked her to the
turf. Despite the high pressure, Stanford kept the
score at 1-0 at the half.
Just four minutes into the second half, it was
2-0 in favor of the Cardinal. Junior Lindsay Tay
lor swung in a corner kick, and sophomore cen
ter back Alina Garciamendez beat her marker
to power a low header into the net. It was the
first goal of the season for the Mexican national
teamer, and it would prove to be vital.
Despite dominant play from Stanford after
the second goal, the game's next goal was scored
by Santa Clara. Kendra Perry received the ball
at the top of the box, turned and hit a low left
footed drive past Oliver into the corner of the
goal. Just like that, Santa Clara had a lifeline.
"We had a lot of chances," Ratcliffe said. "We
didn't execute, and their goalkeeper made some
great saves. We let them hang around, and they
scored a goal late, and it became a game."
The goal shifted the momentum, and Stan
ford went from cruise control to hanging on.
Stanford's defense was able to hold on, preserv
ing the 2-1 victory and a spot in the Sweet Six
teen.

The Cardinal will host UCLA in the round of
16 at 7 p.m. on Friday at Laird Q. Cagan Stadi
um.

Stanford women's soccer is headed to the
round of 16 in the NCAA Tournament after tak
ing down Sacramento State and Santa Clara in
two very different games over the weekend.
After more than 30 shots, Stanford was able
to break through for a goal against Sacramento
State in Friday's tournament opener. Freshman
Sidney Payne knocked in the winning score and
assisted on two later goals for the top-seeded
Cardinal, while classmate and goalkeeper Emily
Oliver secured the 3-0 shutout. All of Stanford's
goals Payne's, along with two more from
freshman Taylor McCann and sophomore Nina
Watkins came from freshmen or players off
the bench.
Stanford (20-0-2) had more than its share of
chances in the first half, when the Cardinal out
shot the Flornets (9-10-1) by a margin of 19-2.
But for every look that Stanford had, it either
just missed the mark or was turned away by Hor
net keeper Savannah Abercrombie.
Stanford coach Paul Ratcliffe, who led Stan
ford over Sacramento State by a score of 7-0 in
2007, had nothing but praise for the Hornets' de
fensive tenacity.
"I was very impressed with Sacramento
State; I think [head coach] Randy [Dedini] or
ganized his team with a great game plan," he
said. "Their team really battled hard and made it
a really tough game, and obviously their goal
keeper was really tremendous in the first half
and in the second half. She made some spectac
ular saves."
It took an unusual play for the Cardinal to fi
nally break through. In the 65th minute, sopho
more defender Rachel Quon sent a cross from
the right side into the box, where Payne made a
quick spin move before tapping it past Aber
crombie with a back-heel. For Payne, who was
subbed in just a few minutes earlier, it was the
second goal of her freshman season. Along with
Quon, junior defender Camille Levin was cred
ited with an assist.
The goal came in a flash, and Payne said she
relied mostly on instinct to make the game-win
ning reaction.
"I think I hit it with my back-heel," she said.
"I just tried to make contact and get the goal."
Ratcliffe was happy to defend his choice of
substituting Payne, who he says has been making
great strides in practice.
"Sydney's been training very, very well, and
she's been getting better and better as a player,"
he said. "I knew she could go in and score the
goal; there was no doubt in my mind that she
could break the ice for us, and she did."
With eight minutes to go, McCann knocked
in some insurance for Stanford. After recovering
a Payne rebound in the box amidst a flurry of de
fenders, McCann powered a shot that deflected
off a sliding Hornet defender into the right side
of the goal.
A few minutes later, after knocking a center
ing pass onto the box, Watkins fired a header
from a few yards out to beat Abercrombie on the
left side. It was the first goal of Watkins' colle
giate career.
"It's great to have players that can come in,
especially freshmen, and have a big impact and
score goals for us," Ratcliffe said. "It's great for
the team spirit, and it's a credit to the freshmen
that they've worked so hard this year and been
so tremendous for us."
The tournament continued as the Card took
on local rival Santa Clara (13-7-2) on Sunday af
ternoon in a rematch of last year's hard-fought
Sweet Sixteen matchup. Tensions were high, and
the game was full of pressure and physicality, but

in the end, Stanford managed to defeat the
