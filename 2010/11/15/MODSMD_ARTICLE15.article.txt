## Cross country secures qualification for NCAA Championships 
### â€” Zach Zimmerman 
The Stanford cross country teams took care
of business on Saturday, performing admirably
at the NCAA West Regional and virtually
clinching spots at the NCAA Championships.
The No. 2 men are locks for nationals on Nov.
22 after finishing second overall at regionals. The
team approached the 10,000-meter course with a
different strategy than it has used in past races,
electing to stick together instead of sending its
three stars Jake Riley, Chris Derrick and Elliott
Heath to the front of the pack. Stanford placed
just two points behind winner Oregon with 65 total
points. The Cardinal beat the Ducks two weeks
ago at the Pac-10 Championships in Seattle.
Derrick led the way for Stanford, finishing in
seventh overall, although Heath and Riley fin
ished just fractions of a second behind his time of
30:14.57 in eighth and ninth place, respectively.
Redshirt freshman Andrew Berberick and red
shirt sophomore Miles Unterreiner also ran well
for the Card, finishing in 21st and 22nd, respec
tively.
The women, up to No. 4 in the national rank
ings after a gutsy conference championship per
formance, placed third at the 6,000-meter region
al, behind rivals Washington and Oregon. Sopho
more Kathy Kroeger, who has led the Cardinal
in every race thus far this year, once again set the
pace for Stanford, finishing in fifth place overall
with a time of 20:13.47. Kroeger, along with red
shirt junior Steph Marcy (11th) and sophomore
Alex Dunne (17th), helped propel the Cardinal
to a final score of 86 points.
While a third-place finish does not guarantee
an automatic bid to the NCAA Championships,
the Cardinal has all but locked up an at-large bid
to contend for a national title.
The NCAA Championships will be held in
Terre Haute, Ind., on Nov. 22.
