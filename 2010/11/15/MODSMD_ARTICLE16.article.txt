# WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
## Cardinal starts season off right 
### NATE ADAMS DESK EDITOR 
Though it struggled to get into a smooth of
fensive rhythm, No. 3 Stanford women's bas
ketball was able to pull away from visiting
Rutgers after a scrappy first half on Sunday af
ternoon, eventually sealing a 63-50 victory in
its season opener. Junior forward Nnemkadi
Ogwumike played all 40 minutes for Stanford
(1-0) and led both teams with 20 points, while
her younger sister Chiney, a freshman, con
tributed a game-high 12 rebounds in just 21
minutes.
Stanford got off to a strong start thanks to
some quick rebounds and strong shooting
from beyond the arc, but the team's accuracy
floundered a bit after the opening minutes.
Following a free throw from Chiney Ogwu
mike that opened the scoring for the Cardinal,

sophomore Joslyn Tinkle sank a three from a
full step beyond the arc. The Missoula, Mont.,
native added another three just a few minutes
later, while Chiney Ogwumike, who Cardinal
coach Tara VanDerveer tapped as a starter in
her first regular season game in a Stanford uni
form, pulled down six rebounds in under five
minutes, helping Stanford spurt out to a 10-4
lead.

The Scarlet Knights (0-2) bounced back to
within 12-11 on a Nikki Speed jumpshot just a
few minutes later, and continued to answer
Stanford shot for shot. Monique Oliver gave
Rutgers its first lead of the game at 17-16 mid
way through the half, and the visitors would
continue to hang tough in the opening frame.
Both teams had some difficulty finding the
hoop in the middle stretch of the half, with
Stanford missing seven consecutive three
pointers in the 10 minutes following Tinkle's

last basket from long range. The Cardinal was
shooting 9-for-23 overall at that point, with
Rutgers shooting at a similar 9-for-22 clip.
"Jeanette [Pohlen] is a very capable three
point shooter, as is Kayla [Pedersen], but I
think we didn't do as much as we needed to do
in terms of creating good shots for them," Van-
Derveer said about her team's first-half of
fense. "[We need to] recognize how to move
the ball and give them better shots."
Pohlen and Pedersen, both seniors this
year, each finished the game shooting just 1-
for-5 from beyond the arc.
The biggest edge for the Cardinal, and the
difference that allowed it to maintain some
control going into halftime, was in rebound
ing. When it headed into the locker room with
a 32-29 lead, Stanford was out-boarding Rut-
gers 25 to 15 and had converted 11
second-chance points. A team-high
10 of those rebounds came from
Chiney Ogwumike.
VanDerveer went with the same
starting five in the second half, and
thanks to a more aggressive ap
proach, they were immediately able
to extend the Cardinal lead and hold
on for the win. Tinkle opened the
scoring from the field once again, this
time with a two-pointer. Nnemkadi
Ogwumike followed that with a
layup, and Pedersen dropped a noth
ing-but-net three from deep on the
left side that electrified the crowd
and gave Stanford a 39-29 lead less
than three minutes into the half.
The Cardinal found success by
continuing to force the ball in close.
Tinkle drove in for a layup with just
over eight minutes remaining to
make it 52-40, and Pedersen
stretched the score to 54-40 on a shot
from the edge of the paint a moment
later, giving the Cardinal a lead of 14.
"We got more aggressive in the
second half, and that helped us a lot,"
VanDerveer said. "We started out re
ally concerned about putting the ball
on the floor, and they hit some shots.
Then we had to tighten it up ... as we
got more aggressive in the second
half, we looked better."
Rutgers was only able to pull as
close as 10, making it 60-50 on a
three-pointer from April Sykes be
fore Nnemkadi Ogwumike closed
out the scoring with a layup and a
free throw from a foul on the play.
By game's end, Nnemkadi Ogwu
mike, Pedersen and Pohlen Stan
ford's three returning starters had
each played a full 40 minutes, most
surprising for Nnemkadi Ogwumike,
who was limited to just 13 minutes in
her team's first two exhibition games
by a sore left ankle. The reigning Pac
-10 player of the year said she was kept
off the court only as a precautionary
measure, and that she's ready to play
as often as needed.

The win wasn't pretty at times, but
there's still plenty for the Cardinal to
be encouraged about. Tinkle scored
10 points en route to a solid perform
ance as a starter, and Chiney Ogwu
mike made huge contributions, par
ticularly on rebounds.
"I think she did very well in terms
of being aggressive," Nnemkadi said
of her younger sister. "I think she han
dled herself very we 11... she com
posed herself nicely, and did whatever

she could when she was on the court."
Adding to the positive takeaways,
Pedersen was confident that the 2010
squad was off to a good start in terms
of coordination on the court. In a year
that Stanford boasts a versatile rota
tion that can change positions or
zones often, she was encouraged to
see it working well in game one.
"I think our communication was
outstanding," she said. "Everybody
knew who was guarding who, what
defenses we were in, what offenses
we were in, so I think everybody

stepped up."
With the victory, VanDerveer
takes a small step toward Rutgers
coach C. Vivian Stringer in the histo
ry book. The Stanford coach is fifth in
all-time wins with 758, compared to
Stringer's third-place mark of 843.
Stanford will hit the road this
weekend, playing its next two games
at Utah on Friday and Gonzaga on
Sunday.

that Stanford boasts a versatile rota
tion that can change positions or
zones often, she was encouraged to
see it working well in game one.
"I think our communication was
outstanding," she said. "Everybody
knew who was guarding who, what
defenses we were in, what offenses
we were in, so I think everybody

stepped up."
With the victory, VanDerveer
takes a small step toward Rutgers
coach C. Vivian Stringer in the histo
ry book. The Stanford coach is fifth in
all-time wins with 758, compared to
Stringer's third-place mark of 843.
Stanford will hit the road this
weekend, playing its next two games
at Utah on Friday and Gonzaga on
Sunday.

Junior forward Nnemkadi Ogwumike (30), reigning Pac-10 Player of the Year,
played a full 40 minutes in Sunday's game against Rutgers, leading the No. 3
Card to a successful season-opener 63-50 victory over the Scarlet Knights.
Though it struggled to get into a smooth of
fensive rhythm, No. 3 Stanford women's bas
ketball was able to pull away from visiting
Rutgers after a scrappy first half on Sunday af
ternoon, eventually sealing a 63-50 victory in
its season opener. Junior forward Nnemkadi
Ogwumike played all 40 minutes for Stanford
(1-0) and led both teams with 20 points, while
her younger sister Chiney, a freshman, con
tributed a game-high 12 rebounds in just 21
minutes.
Stanford got off to a strong start thanks to
some quick rebounds and strong shooting
from beyond the arc, but the team's accuracy
floundered a bit after the opening minutes.
Following a free throw from Chiney Ogwu
mike that opened the scoring for the Cardinal,

sophomore Joslyn Tinkle sank a three from a
full step beyond the arc. The Missoula, Mont.,
native added another three just a few minutes
later, while Chiney Ogwumike, who Cardinal
coach Tara VanDerveer tapped as a starter in
her first regular season game in a Stanford uni
form, pulled down six rebounds in under five
minutes, helping Stanford spurt out to a 10-4
lead.

The Scarlet Knights (0-2) bounced back to
within 12-11 on a Nikki Speed jumpshot just a
few minutes later, and continued to answer
Stanford shot for shot. Monique Oliver gave
Rutgers its first lead of the game at 17-16 mid
way through the half, and the visitors would
continue to hang tough in the opening frame.
Both teams had some difficulty finding the
hoop in the middle stretch of the half, with
Stanford missing seven consecutive three
pointers in the 10 minutes following Tinkle's

last basket from long range. The Cardinal was
shooting 9-for-23 overall at that point, with
Rutgers shooting at a similar 9-for-22 clip.
"Jeanette [Pohlen] is a very capable three
point shooter, as is Kayla [Pedersen], but I
think we didn't do as much as we needed to do
in terms of creating good shots for them," Van-
Derveer said about her team's first-half of
fense. "[We need to] recognize how to move
the ball and give them better shots."
Pohlen and Pedersen, both seniors this
year, each finished the game shooting just 1-
for-5 from beyond the arc.
The biggest edge for the Cardinal, and the
difference that allowed it to maintain some
control going into halftime, was in rebound
ing. When it headed into the locker room with
a 32-29 lead, Stanford was out-boarding Rut-
gers 25 to 15 and had converted 11
second-chance points. A team-high
10 of those rebounds came from
Chiney Ogwumike.
VanDerveer went with the same
starting five in the second half, and
thanks to a more aggressive ap
proach, they were immediately able
to extend the Cardinal lead and hold
on for the win. Tinkle opened the
scoring from the field once again, this
time with a two-pointer. Nnemkadi
Ogwumike followed that with a
layup, and Pedersen dropped a noth
ing-but-net three from deep on the
left side that electrified the crowd
and gave Stanford a 39-29 lead less
than three minutes into the half.
The Cardinal found success by
continuing to force the ball in close.
Tinkle drove in for a layup with just
over eight minutes remaining to
make it 52-40, and Pedersen
stretched the score to 54-40 on a shot
from the edge of the paint a moment
later, giving the Cardinal a lead of 14.
"We got more aggressive in the
second half, and that helped us a lot,"
VanDerveer said. "We started out re
ally concerned about putting the ball
on the floor, and they hit some shots.
Then we had to tighten it up ... as we
got more aggressive in the second
half, we looked better."
Rutgers was only able to pull as
close as 10, making it 60-50 on a
three-pointer from April Sykes be
fore Nnemkadi Ogwumike closed
out the scoring with a layup and a
free throw from a foul on the play.
By game's end, Nnemkadi Ogwu
mike, Pedersen and Pohlen Stan
ford's three returning starters had
each played a full 40 minutes, most
surprising for Nnemkadi Ogwumike,
who was limited to just 13 minutes in
her team's first two exhibition games
by a sore left ankle. The reigning Pac
-10 player of the year said she was kept
off the court only as a precautionary
measure, and that she's ready to play
as often as needed.

The win wasn't pretty at times, but
there's still plenty for the Cardinal to
be encouraged about. Tinkle scored
10 points en route to a solid perform
ance as a starter, and Chiney Ogwu
mike made huge contributions, par
ticularly on rebounds.
"I think she did very well in terms
of being aggressive," Nnemkadi said
of her younger sister. "I think she han
dled herself very we 11... she com
posed herself nicely, and did whatever

she could when she was on the court."
Adding to the positive takeaways,
Pedersen was confident that the 2010
squad was off to a good start in terms
of coordination on the court. In a year
that Stanford boasts a versatile rota
tion that can change positions or
zones often, she was encouraged to
see it working well in game one.
"I think our communication was
outstanding," she said. "Everybody
knew who was guarding who, what
defenses we were in, what offenses
we were in, so I think everybody

stepped up."
With the victory, VanDerveer
takes a small step toward Rutgers
coach C. Vivian Stringer in the histo
ry book. The Stanford coach is fifth in
all-time wins with 758, compared to
Stringer's third-place mark of 843.
