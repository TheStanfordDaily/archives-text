## Cardinal starts season off right 
### NATE ADAMS DESK EDITOR 
Though it struggled to get into a smooth of
fensive rhythm, No. 3 Stanford women's bas
ketball was able to pull away from visiting
Rutgers after a scrappy first half on Sunday af
ternoon, eventually sealing a 63-50 victory in
its season opener. Junior forward Nnemkadi
Ogwumike played all 40 minutes for Stanford
(1-0) and led both teams with 20 points, while
her younger sister Chiney, a freshman, con
tributed a game-high 12 rebounds in just 21
minutes.
Stanford got off to a strong start thanks to
some quick rebounds and strong shooting
from beyond the arc, but the team's accuracy
floundered a bit after the opening minutes.
Following a free throw from Chiney Ogwu
mike that opened the scoring for the Cardinal,

sophomore Joslyn Tinkle sank a three from a
full step beyond the arc. The Missoula, Mont.,
native added another three just a few minutes
later, while Chiney Ogwumike, who Cardinal
coach Tara VanDerveer tapped as a starter in
her first regular season game in a Stanford uni
form, pulled down six rebounds in under five
minutes, helping Stanford spurt out to a 10-4
lead.

The Scarlet Knights (0-2) bounced back to
within 12-11 on a Nikki Speed jumpshot just a
few minutes later, and continued to answer
Stanford shot for shot. Monique Oliver gave
Rutgers its first lead of the game at 17-16 mid
way through the half, and the visitors would
continue to hang tough in the opening frame.
Both teams had some difficulty finding the
hoop in the middle stretch of the half, with
Stanford missing seven consecutive three
pointers in the 10 minutes following Tinkle's

last basket from long range. The Cardinal was
shooting 9-for-23 overall at that point, with
Rutgers shooting at a similar 9-for-22 clip.
"Jeanette [Pohlen] is a very capable three
point shooter, as is Kayla [Pedersen], but I
think we didn't do as much as we needed to do
in terms of creating good shots for them," Van-
Derveer said about her team's first-half of
fense. "[We need to] recognize how to move
the ball and give them better shots."
Pohlen and Pedersen, both seniors this
year, each finished the game shooting just 1-
for-5 from beyond the arc.
The biggest edge for the Cardinal, and the
difference that allowed it to maintain some
control going into halftime, was in rebound
ing. When it headed into the locker room with
a 32-29 lead, Stanford was out-boarding Rut-
