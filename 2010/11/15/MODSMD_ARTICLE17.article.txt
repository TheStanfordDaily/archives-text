# It doesn't get bigger than Big Game
## 
### Daniel Bohm 
Pause for a second, Stanford
fans, exhale and be glad
that the Card survived its
trip to the desert. Now get
ready for Big Game,
Don't think about how the Sun
Devils nearly put a wrench in Stan
ford's magical season anymore. Don't
think about how the offensive line that
I applauded so aggressively last week
was consistently beat at the point of at
tack against Arizona State. Don't even
consider Stanford's shaky play in the
red zone or Nate Whitaker's missed
field goal. Don't do it, because if the
Cardinal plays like that next week at
Cal, it will lose.
Instead, be glad that the defense
held strong all game and that the Car
dinal remained the anti-Vontaze Bur
fict and kept its composure in the face
of a team hungry for an upset. Did you
notice how calm Andrew Luck looked
leading Stanford down the field in the
fourth quarter?
Still, if Stanford has a repeat per
formance next week, the Axe will re
main in Berkeley.
Cal may be 5-5 on the season, but it
has been exceptionally impressive at
home. The Golden Bears will be play
ing for bowl eligibility, and they would
love nothing more than to ruin Stan
ford's BCS-bound season. Not to men
tion the fact that Cal has owned the Big
Game in the past decade, winning
seven of the last eight.
The Golden Bears' home-road
splits this year are nothing short of
stunning. Cal has been an awfully rude
host, going 4-1 at home, with its only
loss coming last weekend against No. 1
Oregon (more on that in a second). In
home games, Cal has outscored its op
ponents 202-49. On the road, however,
Cal is 1-4 (the only win being over no
longer-hapless Washington State) and
has been outmatched by a total of 158-
81. Too bad Stanford has to travel to
Memorial Stadium on Saturday.
Most impressive for Cal, however,
may be its 15-13 loss this past weekend
against Oregon. The Cal defense man
aged to slow down the Ducks' offense,
making it not look straight out of a
video game for the first time all season.
Cal was able to stay in the game de
spite starting backup Brock Mansion
at quarterback. I can't say I've watched
him play, but Mansion was deemed
worse than Kevin Riley, so he can't be
great. (For reference, go to You Tube,
type in "Kevin Riley Oregon State,"
and watch the first video).
What is scary is that in the abstract,
Oregon is very similar to Stanford on
offense. Most football fans will proba
bly read that and say "huh?" Sure, Ore
gon runs the spread out of the shotgun
and Stanford utilizes a pro-style of
fense, but both offenses rely on just a
few simple tactics to win. For example,
the vast majority of what Oregon runs
is a slight variation, whether a different
formation or a different motion, of a
few plays (zone read, speed option and
wide receiver screens).
Stanford's offense is quite complex,
but it, too, relies on the ability to run a
few plays very well (namely, power). As
we saw against Arizona State, if Stan
ford can't run the ball, there will be a lot
of third and longs, and although Luck is
great, that is not a winning recipe,
Jeff Tedford and the other Cal
coaches showed Saturday that they
could draw up a scheme to stop Ore
gon. If they are able to do that with
Stanford, it could mean another low
scoring game (Cal will almost un
doubtedly struggle to move the ball on
Stanford).
Sure, comparing Stanford's offense

to Oregon's is probably dumb, be
cause Stanford can likely out-muscle
Cal's defense, which probably isn't as
physical as Arizona State's. Still, we
saw last year that the Golden Bears'
defense can give Stanford's offense
enough trouble to make a game of it.
Regardless, it is the biggest Big
Game for Stanford in a long, long
time, and it should be great. It is too
bad Big Game isn't the final game of
the year, like it used to be, and falls on
the first weekend of Thanksgiving
break, as many students, I am certain,
will have already headed home for the
break.
Whether you are going to the
game or not, if you are on campus,
enjoy the week. Have fun with all the
build-up to Saturday; there is nothing
better than a campus rallying around
a single game for a single team. There
are few weeks as fun as Big Game
week (although professors seem to al
ways find away to make it less fun than
it could be), so get out there and enjoy
it this is as important as it gets for
Stanford on Saturday.

This might just be Daniel Bohm's fa
vorite week of the year. Let him know
you're going to Big Game at
