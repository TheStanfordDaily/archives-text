# FIELD HOCKEY
## Field hockey finished in NCAA first round 
### MARGARET RAWSON DESK EDITOR 
An otherwise impressive season for
Stanford field hockey came to a close in
Chapel Hill, N.C., on Saturday morning, as
the No. 19 Cardinal fell, 3-1, to No. 2 North
Carolina in the first round of the NCAA
Tournament.
Stanford (15-6,5-1 NorPac) saw action

in the NCAA Tournament for the third
time in the past four seasons, and has ap
peared in the tournament 10 times in the
program's history. However, the Cardinal
has never won a game in the NCAA Tour
nament, despite making its first postseason
appearance in 1985.
Stanford finished 15-6 overall, including
its fourth consecutive championship in the
NorPac Tournament .

This year's 15-win season marks the
third-highest win total in school history,
with last year's 17-win record an all-time
high.
Saturday's game against defending
NCAA champion North Carolina (20-2,4-
IACC) proved tough for the Card.
Jaclyn Radvany broke the ice for North
Carolina in the 10th minute, with a follow
up shot after her first attempt hit the cross

bar. At 16:09, Marta Malmberg gave the
Tar Heels a 2-0 lead, scoring on a penalty
corner. Elizabeth Stephens scored seven
minutes later for North Carolina off an ini
tial block by Stanford junior goalkeeper
Alessandra Moss.
To counter North Carolina's aggressive
attack, Moss had a career-high 17 saves for
the game on Saturday, off 25 shots
from the Tar Heels.
Scoring slowed in the second half,
and Stanford was able to hold the Tar
Heels at three until a late push dur
ing the last 10 minutes provided a
glimmer of hope for the Card.
Senior Katherine Swank scored
off an assist by senior Xanthe Trav
los at the 62:03 mark, and a few min
utes later, an apparent score off a
penalty corner offered more hope.
Officials disallowed the goal, how
ever, leading to a final score of 3-1.
Swank was the first Stanford
player to score in the NCAA Tour
nament since Melissa Stai's goal in
2000.
Sophomore Becky Dru, one of
Stanford's top offensive threats,
was completely shut down by the
Tar Heel defense, Dru powered the
Cardinal to its title in the NorPac
Tournament, but could not find the
net against North Carolina despite
leading all Stanford players with
three shots. For the season, Dru led
the Cardinal in numerous statistical
categories, including goals with 13,
assists with 10, points with 36 and
shots with 88.
