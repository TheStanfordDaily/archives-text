## 'Office' writer, alum draws fans on Farm Carrie Kemper '06 says show draws on common experiences 
### MARGARET RAWSON DESK EDITOR 
When Greg Daniels and Paul
Lieberstein spoke at Stanford in
2003 about their experience writing
for "The Simpsons" and "King of the
Hill," Carrie Kemper 'O6 was in the
audience. Things came full circle for
Kemper, now a staff writer for "The
Office," Friday afternoon when she
joined Daniels, executive producer
and developer of "The Office," and
Lieberstein, executive producer,
writer and cast member, on a panel to
discuss "Boy-Men at 'The Office'
the Petty Comedy of the Dysfunc
tional Workplace," hosted by the
Program in American Studies.
Scores of "Office" enthusiasts
filled a lecture hall in the geology
building Friday to hear Daniels,
Lieberstein and Kemper talk about
their work, jumping between topics
from how characters develop on the
Emmy-award winning comedy series
to the show's future after Steve
Carell's scheduled departure at the
end of the current season.
Kemper, an American Studies
major and editor in chief of The Stan
ford Chaparral while at Stanford,
commented on the success of "The
Office" as pulling from common life
experiences such as a tough economy.
"People are able to make fun of
their own lives," Kemper said of the
NBC sitcom chronicling the Scran
ton, Penn., paper company Dunder
Mifflin, now owned by Sabre due to
hard times.
The show is also known for its pi
oneering use of the "mockumen
tary" format.
"Sitcoms were ready to be mar
ried to the reality show format,"
Lieberstien said.
Daniels said of the show's success
that different audience members
watch for different reasons.
"Most people come for Toby,"
Kemper added, referencing Lieber
stein's role as the beloved and ordi
nary human resources representa

tive Toby Flenderson.
Lieberstein later commented on
his experience bridging producing,
writing and acting.
"Being on set so much has influ
enced the way I write ... and helped
me as a producer, too," Lieberstein
said, describing how actors "float
around in the dark" when they re
ceive limited direction.
Kemper, commenting on the sym
posium's theme of immature men,
described how certain characters,
such as Dwight Schrute, played by
Rainn Wilson, and Michael Scott,
played by Carell, are boys in adult
bodies.
"What have you got against
men?" quipped Lieberstein.
Daniels said that "boy-men" are a
staple of comedy and, when asked
about a narrative behind "The Of
fice," said, "We all have enough to eat
here in America now. Maybe we're

frivolous."
When asked about Carell's im
pending departure from the show,
Lieberstein said, "We're not going
off the air."
Discussing the collaborative
process of writing an episode,
Daniels said, "ft all boils down to one
thing: if the person running things lis
tens to the other people."
The panel also commented on the
nature of careers in television writ
ing and production. When asked
about advice for aspiring writers and
producers, the trio showed a
You Tube clip of girls tripping over
hurdles in a track race, followed by
the tagline "The courage to contin
ue."
"Good luck," Kemper said as the
clip ended.
Jokes aside, Lieberstein elaborat
ed on his career path from an eco
nomics major at Hamilton College.

"I never thought this was avail
able to me," he said.
About specific strategies to get
in the mindset of a different human
being when writing, Daniels asked,
"What if that ugly behavior were
part of our characters?" He added
that he finds it easier to write for the
parts of Dwight Schrute and
Michael Scott than Erin, the secre
tary played by Kemper's older sis
ter, Ellie.
Kemper commented that she
finds it easier to write for her sister
because she can imagine her delivery
of the lines. Clearly, comedy runs in
the family, as younger brother Billy
Kemper'll currently edits The Stan
ford Chaparral.
The first episode Kemper wrote
for "The Office," titled "The Ultima
tum," will air Jan. 6.
