Stanford's 113 th Big Game Week
will be celebrated with festivities begin
ning on Monday and lasting until the
annual rivalry game against UC-Berke
ley on Saturday.
The first Big Game in 1892 resulted
in a 14-10 victory for Stanford, and ever
since, the annual game has been the
cause of a week's worth of entertain
ment. Big Game Week staple Gaieties,
this year entitled "The Last Temptation
of Cal," will be performed in Memorial

many other events throughout the
week.
The Axe Committee will begin a

chairman Jake Smith 'l2.
The marquee event of Big Game
Week 2010 is the DJ competition and

ni Center. Aoki graduated from UC-
Santa Barbara and has established his
own record company, Dim Mak, along
with a clothing line. Aoki's fellow head
liner, Kid Sister, is a female rapper from
Chicago.
"Steve Aoki is a popular party DJ,"
said Kevin Chow 'l3, the publicity di
rector of the Stanford Concert Net
work (SCN), which is putting on the
event. "He is known for having exciting
shows where he crowd-surfs and sprays
beverages on the audience."
SCN contacted Aoki's agent, who
informed them Aoki was on a college
tour and would be available to perform
at Stanford during Big Game Week
along with Kid Sister. The SCN core
came up with the idea of adding a cam
pus-wide guest DJ contest.
"Originally we wanted to do a live
DJ competition, but the idea was last
minute, and we made a Web page in
stead," Chow said.
For the competition, six DJs up
loaded then mixes to the concert web
site and allowed students to select their
favorite one. The DJs garnered suffi
cient buzz, and as of Friday had re
ceived more than 1,000 votes and 4,500
plays of the six mixes. Chow said. The
winner will be announced during the
show on Tuesday, he said.
Also on Tuesday is the "Rivals for
Life" blood drive, themed "There Will
Be Blood." It will take place from 11
a.m. to 7 p.m. at Arrillaga Sports Cen
ter. Both the Stanford and Cal blood
banks will host a competition to deter
mine which school can donate the most
blood to the UC-San Francisco blood

bank. A bone marrow typing drive
sponsored by Lambda Phi Epsilon will
also take place on Tuesday and
Wednesday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. in
White Plaza.
Stanford student organizations face
off in the name of school rivalry as well.
Big Sing pits Stanford a capella groups
against groups from Cal and will take
place Tuesday at 8 p.m. at 155 Dwinelle
Hall on the Berkeley campus. The staff
of The Daily is set to battle the staff of
The Daily Californian in a flag football
showdown, Ink Bowl, at the UC-
Berkeley campus on the day of Big
Game.
Fan Central events for the freshman
and junior classes are scheduled to take
place on Wednesday at 12 p.m. in White
Plaza. The sophomore and senior class
es are scheduled to gather for Fan Cen
tral on Thursday at the same time and
location.
The Big Game rally will occur on
Thursday night at 10 p.m. in Old
Union courtyard and will bring the
football players out for recognition by
their peers, Smith said. This, aside
from the last showing of Gaieties on
Friday night at 8 p.m., will close the
week's events and prepare the stu
dent body for the main event at Cali
fornia Memorial Stadium on Satur
day at 12:30 p.m.
According to ASSU Senate Chair
Michael Cruz 'l2, the ASSU and Axe

um. The Senate is also planning a
viewing party for students who will
