## In Pearl Memorial Lecture, Blitzer and Bohrman examine 'war on terror' coverage

CNN anchor Wolf Blitzer and
CNN senior producer David
Bohrman '76 spoke to Stanford stu
dents and community members in the
fifth annual Daniel Pearl Memorial
Lecture in Dinkelspiel Auditorium on
Sunday night. Entitled "The War on
Terror: From the Headlines to the
Back Pages," the talk focused on the
progression in America's focus from
terrorism to the Iraq war to the econ
omy over the past 10 years.
Pulling examples from elections
and exit polls, Blitzer discussed the
ebb and flow of optimism and fear in
American politics. The speakers used
video clips of CNN's election cover
age to illustrate the change in voters'
values following 9/11, which Blitzer
called "the most important story of
the new millennium."
"Following the 20th century, which
was the most horrific century in the
history of the world... I was con
vinced that as we're moving into a
new millennium, things [were] going
to be better," Blitzer said. "Now we
have the first 10 years to reflect, and
I'm not exactly sure things are a whole
lot better."
The personal experiences of the
speakers carried plenty of material

for reflection. Blitzer, host of "The Sit
uation Room" on CNN, has served as
a CNN reporter for the past 20 years.
Bohrman has worked closely with
Blitzer over the past 10 years as
CNN's senior vice president of pro
gramming. Looking back over the
past decade, Blitzer offered his own
insights on causes and effects of polit
ical change.
Despite the profound change 9/11
enacted on American society, Blitzer
said, Americans cast their ballots
based on whatever issue most affect
ed them personally at the time of the
elections.
By the 2006 midterm elections,
CNN's polls showed corruption re
placing the war and terrorism as vot
ers' first concerns. But even corrup
tion's import lessened in the face of
the failing economy during the 2008
election.
"The country [was] getting so
caught up in their lives and in the
economy," Bohrman said, "but what
was being given up was focus on the
'war on terror' and on war itself."
Despite the somber subject, the
speakers focused on hopeful mo
ments as well, showing video clips of
cheering voters on the night of the
2008 presidential election.

"It was one of those moments I knew would
be recorded forever."

In the fifth annual Daniel Pearl Memorial Lecture on Sunday, CNN anchor Wolf Blitzer, above, and senior producer
David Bohrman '76 discussed the fading coverage of the 'war on terror' over the decade.
"ft was a national moment, and it
was a rare global moment of unity
that was pretty exciting," Bohrman
said.
"It was one of those moments I
knew would be recorded forever,"
Blitzer said.
While the pair cautioned against
taking the recent midterm elections
as strong indicators for the 2012 pres
idential race, they said President
Obama may need to enact further re

form in order to be re-elected.
"Over years, over decades, the
economy is always the bread-and
butter issue that voters are most con
cerned about," Blitzer said.
"All these big companies are doing
well, relatively speaking, but they're
not hiring," Blitzer said in response to
an audience member's question, de
scribing the "new normal" that hin
ders America's economic growth.
Though Bohrman and Blitzer did
not speak much on journalism, the
reason for the talk, an annual remem
brance of Daniel Pearl, remained in
audience members' minds in the form
of a large photograph of Pearl pro
jected on the wall behind the stage.

Pearl, who graduated from Stan
ford in 1985, was kidnapped and mur
dered in Pakistan in 2002 while inves
tigating the link between shoe
bomber Richard Reid and A1 Qaeda.
Following his death, Pearl's family
founded the Daniel Pearl Founda
tion, which sponsors programs on
journalism, Judaism, music and peace
across the country. University Presi
dent Flennessy sits on the honorary
board of the foundation, along with
Bill Clinton, Eli Wiesel and others.
"While Daniel's story makes us
afraid because of the horrors of our
time, it also forbids us from fear be
cause of what Danny represented
when he was alive and what he con

tinues to represent after his death,"
said Pearl's father, Judea, in an intro
duction to the talk.
"By honoring Danny, we honor
the whole community of journalists
and media pioneers who dedicate
their talents to helping us see the
world through prism of truth and un
derstanding," he said.
The fifth annual Daniel Pearl
Memorial Lecture was sponsored by
Hillel, the Office for Religious Life,
the Office of the President, the Daniel
Pearl Foundation and the ASSU
Speakers Bureau.
