# Broadcasters talk the decade in news
## In Pearl Memorial Lecture, Blitzer and Bohrman examine 'war on terror' coverage 
### ZOE LEAVITT SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
CNN anchor Wolf Blitzer and
CNN senior producer David
Bohrman '76 spoke to Stanford stu
dents and community members in the
fifth annual Daniel Pearl Memorial
Lecture in Dinkelspiel Auditorium on
Sunday night. Entitled "The War on
Terror: From the Headlines to the
Back Pages," the talk focused on the
progression in America's focus from
terrorism to the Iraq war to the econ
omy over the past 10 years.
Pulling examples from elections
and exit polls, Blitzer discussed the
ebb and flow of optimism and fear in
American politics. The speakers used
video clips of CNN's election cover
age to illustrate the change in voters'
values following 9/11, which Blitzer
called "the most important story of
the new millennium."
"Following the 20th century, which
was the most horrific century in the
history of the world... I was con
vinced that as we're moving into a
new millennium, things [were] going
to be better," Blitzer said. "Now we
have the first 10 years to reflect, and
I'm not exactly sure things are a whole
lot better."
The personal experiences of the
speakers carried plenty of material

for reflection. Blitzer, host of "The Sit
uation Room" on CNN, has served as
a CNN reporter for the past 20 years.
Bohrman has worked closely with
Blitzer over the past 10 years as
CNN's senior vice president of pro
gramming. Looking back over the
past decade, Blitzer offered his own
insights on causes and effects of polit
ical change.
Despite the profound change 9/11
enacted on American society, Blitzer
said, Americans cast their ballots
based on whatever issue most affect
ed them personally at the time of the
elections.
By the 2006 midterm elections,
CNN's polls showed corruption re
placing the war and terrorism as vot
ers' first concerns. But even corrup
tion's import lessened in the face of
the failing economy during the 2008
election.
"The country [was] getting so
caught up in their lives and in the
economy," Bohrman said, "but what
was being given up was focus on the
'war on terror' and on war itself."
Despite the somber subject, the
speakers focused on hopeful mo
ments as well, showing video clips of
cheering voters on the night of the
2008 presidential election.

"It was one of those moments I knew would
be recorded forever."
