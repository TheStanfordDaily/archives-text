# ASU GOES DOWN
## 
### KABIR SAWHNEY MANAGING EDITOR 
With talk of a "letdown game" swirling
around it all week, the No. 6 Stanford football
team headed to Tempe on Saturday to take on
a dangerous Arizona State squad. Despite an
uncharacteristically weak day from the offense,
the Cardinal managed to pull out a win, defeat
ing the Sun Devils (4-6,2-5 Pac-10) by a final
score of 17-13.
Stanford (9-1,6-1) entered the game after a
big win over then-No. 15 Arizona last weekend,
and the magnitude of that game led some com
mentators to predict that the Cardinal would
not come out against the Sun Devils in top
form, leaving itself vulnerable to an upset.
Through the first half, an upset looked like a
distinct possibility, with neither team gaining
any ground and both defenses holding strong.
The half ended in a 7-7 tie, after Stanford senior
kicker Nate Whitaker missed a field goal with
16 seconds left.
The third quarter continued to see strong
defensive play from both teams. After trading
punts to open the second half, Stanford finally
took a lead on a Whitaker field goal, only to

watch the Sun Devils march down the field on
their next drive for a touchdown. A 39-yard run
from running back Cameron Marshall got Ari
zona State into the red zone, and an eight-yard
touchdown pass from quarterback Steven
Threet to wide receiver Kerry Taylor gave the
Sun Devils their first lead of the game at 13-10

(kicker Thomas Weber missed the extra point).
The fourth quarter started with a grim out
look for the Cardinal. After trading punts fol
lowing the Sun Devil touchdown, Stanford was
driving into Arizona State territory with its first
drive of the fourth quarter. Redshirt sopho
more quarterback Andrew Luck threw an in

terception at the ASU six-yard line, giving the
Sun Devils an opportunity to increase their
lead.
However, the Cardinal defense came up
with a stop, forcing Arizona State to punt from

GAME NOTES: The Cardinal will travel across the Bay for
the 113 th Big Game Saturday. Cal held No. 1 Oregon
to only a 15-13 loss this weekend and has won every
other home game this season; however, Stanford looks
to dominate on Saturday, led by redshirt sophomore
quarterback Andrew Luck.

Stanford senior wide receiver Doug Baldwin (89) carries the ball for Stanford against ASU. The Cardinal narrowly edged past the Sun Devils to keep
its hopes of a BCS berth alive. Arizona State, with a 4-6 overall record, was officially eliminated from bowl eligibility following Saturday's game.
Starting with the ball on its own
15-yard line, Stanford put together
one of its classic drives, grinding out
85 yards in 10 plays while taking 5:22
off the clock, ending with a one-yard
touchdown run from senior two-way
player Owen Marecic. Whitaker
drilled the extra point, giving the
Card a 17-13 lead with just over five
minutes remaining in the game. Stan
ford's running game finally started to
find some space against a suffocating
ASU front seven, with sophomore
Stepfan Taylor and freshman Antho
ny Wilkerson gaining chunks of
yardage.
Stanford's defense held up on the
next ASU drive, with sophomore line
backer Shayne Skov sacking Threet
on third down to force the punt before
the Sun Devils could even move the
chains once.
Stanford used its final drive to kill
the clock and preserve the win. The
Cardinal running game, especially
Wilkerson, continued to grind out
yards. Indeed, on his final run of the
game, Wilkerson got behind the ASU
defense and had a clear shot at the end
zone, but slid down at the Arizona
State four-yard line to keep the clock
moving. Two kneel-downs by Luck
ended the game, giving the Card the
win.
Arizona State came into the game
needing to win out to secure bowl el
igibility, and its desperation showed,
especially on defense. Led by line
backer Vontaze Burfict, the Sun
Devil defense swarmed the line of
scrimmage, putting pressure on the
Stanford backfield. ASU's front
seven completely stuffed Stanford's
vertical running game. The Cardinal
offensive line, which had dominated
Arizona's much-vaunted defensive
line just a week ago, couldn't find
similar success against the Sun Dev
ils' run defense.
The Sun Devils also distinguished
themselves from earlier Stanford op
ponents in mounting a credible pass
rush. Luck was hurried and hit far
more often than usual, and was
sacked once in the second quarter,
just the fourth sack surrendered by
the Cardinal all season. While Luck
would throw for 292 yards on the
game, he ended with no passing
touchdowns and one interception.
The one bright spot for Stanford's

offense was Wilkerson's play. The
true freshman led the Cardinal in
rushing with 10 carries for 65 yards,
even though he did not enter the
game until the final five minutes of
the third quarter. Taylor, who had
spearheaded Stanford's running at
tack over the last several games,
failed to make any headway against
ASU, finishing with 16 carries for just
39 yards (a lowly 2.4 yards per carry).
Overall, Stanford's rushing attack
tallied a low 3.0 yards per carry, in
cluding 18 carries for only nine yards
in the first half.
Stanford was once again without
the services of junior receiver Chris
Owusu, who was held out of the game
with an undisclosed injury. Owusu has
missed a number of games due to var
ious injuries already, but looked fully
healthy last week against Arizona
while racking up 165 receiving yards
on nine catches.
Defensively, Stanford continued
to play well, holding the Sun Devils
to 268 yards of total offense. Threet
was held to just 158 yards on 16-26
passing, despite entering the game
near the top of the Pac-10's stat sheet.
The Cardinal front seven also man
aged to limit ASU's (admittedly
weak) rushing attack to 110 yards on
23 carries.
As it did last weekend against Ari
zona, the defense's impact went be
yond the stat sheet, with clutch plays
to nullify big ASU drives. Junior safe
ty Delano Howell picked off Threet
in the first quarter, and freshman cor
nerback Barry Browning recovered
a fumble at its own goal line early in
the second quarter when junior de
fensive back Michael Thomas
knocked the ball loose from a diving
Threet.
"When you have the best quarter
back in the nation, a Heisman candi
date on the other side of the ball, you
just have do your job and keep them
out of the end zone," said senior cor
nerback Richard Sherman in a
postgame press conference. "No mat
ter how long it takes, he's going to get
it done."
With a 4-6 overall record and two
games remaining, Arizona State is of
ficially eliminated from bowl eligibil
ity — two of the Sun Devils' wins
came over FCS opponents, and only
one of those can count toward eligi
bility. However, if Arizona State wins
out, it may still gain a waiver to play in
a bowl game if there are not enough
eligible teams to fill all the bowl slots.
By beating ASU, Stanford kept its
hopes of a BCS berth alive. With a 9-

1 overall record, the Cardinal should
be ranked in the top 10 of the final
BCS standings if it wins out, but nu
merous factors could see Stanford in
the Rose Bowl, another BCS bowl or
a lesser bowl, most likely the Alamo
Bowl. It will also help the Card that
its only loss came to No. 1 Oregon,
which survived against California in
Berkeley on Saturday with a 15-13
victory.

Up next for Stanford is the 113 th
Big Game against Cal (5-5,3-4) across
the Bay at Memorial Stadium in
Berkeley. The Golden Bears have
looked unbeatable at home they
won every home game this season by
big margins prior to playing the
Ducks, and only lost by two points to
Oregon at home, which is no small
feat against the country's top team.
Stanford will take on Cal Saturday
at 12:30 p.m. in Berkeley.

ASU, finishing with 16 carries for just
39 yards (a lowly 2.4 yards per carry).
Overall, Stanford's rushing attack
tallied a low 3.0 yards per carry, in
cluding 18 carries for only nine yards
in the first half.
Stanford was once again without
the services of junior receiver Chris
Owusu, who was held out of the game
with an undisclosed injury. Owusu has
missed a number of games due to var
ious injuries already, but looked fully
healthy last week against Arizona
while racking up 165 receiving yards
on nine catches.
Defensively, Stanford continued
to play well, holding the Sun Devils
to 268 yards of total offense. Threet
was held to just 158 yards on 16-26
passing, despite entering the game
near the top of the Pac-10's stat sheet.
The Cardinal front seven also man
aged to limit ASU's (admittedly
weak) rushing attack to 110 yards on
23 carries.
As it did last weekend against Ari
zona, the defense's impact went be
yond the stat sheet, with clutch plays
to nullify big ASU drives. Junior safe
ty Delano Howell picked off Threet
in the first quarter, and freshman cor
nerback Barry Browning recovered
a fumble at its own goal line early in
the second quarter when junior de
fensive back Michael Thomas
knocked the ball loose from a diving
Threet.
"When you have the best quarter
back in the nation, a Heisman candi
date on the other side of the ball, you
just have do your job and keep them
out of the end zone," said senior cor
nerback Richard Sherman in a
postgame press conference. "No mat
ter how long it takes, he's going to get
it done."
With a 4-6 overall record and two
games remaining, Arizona State is of
ficially eliminated from bowl eligibil
ity — two of the Sun Devils' wins
came over FCS opponents, and only
one of those can count toward eligi
bility. However, if Arizona State wins
out, it may still gain a waiver to play in
a bowl game if there are not enough
eligible teams to fill all the bowl slots.
By beating ASU, Stanford kept its
hopes of a BCS berth alive. With a 9-

1 overall record, the Cardinal should
be ranked in the top 10 of the final
BCS standings if it wins out, but nu
merous factors could see Stanford in
the Rose Bowl, another BCS bowl or
a lesser bowl, most likely the Alamo
Bowl. It will also help the Card that
its only loss came to No. 1 Oregon,
which survived against California in
Berkeley on Saturday with a 15-13
victory.

Up next for Stanford is the 113 th
Big Game against Cal (5-5,3-4) across
the Bay at Memorial Stadium in
Berkeley. The Golden Bears have
looked unbeatable at home they
won every home game this season by
big margins prior to playing the
Ducks, and only lost by two points to
Oregon at home, which is no small
feat against the country's top team.
Stanford will take on Cal Saturday
at 12:30 p.m. in Berkeley.

With talk of a "letdown game" swirling
around it all week, the No. 6 Stanford football
team headed to Tempe on Saturday to take on
a dangerous Arizona State squad. Despite an
uncharacteristically weak day from the offense,
the Cardinal managed to pull out a win, defeat
ing the Sun Devils (4-6,2-5 Pac-10) by a final
score of 17-13.
Stanford (9-1,6-1) entered the game after a
big win over then-No. 15 Arizona last weekend,
and the magnitude of that game led some com
mentators to predict that the Cardinal would
not come out against the Sun Devils in top
form, leaving itself vulnerable to an upset.
Through the first half, an upset looked like a
distinct possibility, with neither team gaining
any ground and both defenses holding strong.
The half ended in a 7-7 tie, after Stanford senior
kicker Nate Whitaker missed a field goal with
16 seconds left.
The third quarter continued to see strong
defensive play from both teams. After trading
punts to open the second half, Stanford finally
took a lead on a Whitaker field goal, only to

watch the Sun Devils march down the field on
their next drive for a touchdown. A 39-yard run
from running back Cameron Marshall got Ari
zona State into the red zone, and an eight-yard
touchdown pass from quarterback Steven
Threet to wide receiver Kerry Taylor gave the
Sun Devils their first lead of the game at 13-10

(kicker Thomas Weber missed the extra point).
The fourth quarter started with a grim out
look for the Cardinal. After trading punts fol
lowing the Sun Devil touchdown, Stanford was
driving into Arizona State territory with its first
drive of the fourth quarter. Redshirt sopho
more quarterback Andrew Luck threw an in

terception at the ASU six-yard line, giving the
Sun Devils an opportunity to increase their
lead.
However, the Cardinal defense came up
with a stop, forcing Arizona State to punt from

GAME NOTES: The Cardinal will travel across the Bay for
the 113 th Big Game Saturday. Cal held No. 1 Oregon
to only a 15-13 loss this weekend and has won every
other home game this season; however, Stanford looks
to dominate on Saturday, led by redshirt sophomore
quarterback Andrew Luck.

Stanford senior wide receiver Doug Baldwin (89) carries the ball for Stanford against ASU. The Cardinal narrowly edged past the Sun Devils to keep
its hopes of a BCS berth alive. Arizona State, with a 4-6 overall record, was officially eliminated from bowl eligibility following Saturday's game.
Starting with the ball on its own
15-yard line, Stanford put together
one of its classic drives, grinding out
85 yards in 10 plays while taking 5:22
off the clock, ending with a one-yard
touchdown run from senior two-way
player Owen Marecic. Whitaker
drilled the extra point, giving the
Card a 17-13 lead with just over five
minutes remaining in the game. Stan
ford's running game finally started to
find some space against a suffocating
ASU front seven, with sophomore
Stepfan Taylor and freshman Antho
ny Wilkerson gaining chunks of
yardage.
Stanford's defense held up on the
next ASU drive, with sophomore line
backer Shayne Skov sacking Threet
on third down to force the punt before
the Sun Devils could even move the
chains once.
Stanford used its final drive to kill
the clock and preserve the win. The
Cardinal running game, especially
Wilkerson, continued to grind out
yards. Indeed, on his final run of the
game, Wilkerson got behind the ASU
defense and had a clear shot at the end
zone, but slid down at the Arizona
State four-yard line to keep the clock
moving. Two kneel-downs by Luck
ended the game, giving the Card the
win.
Arizona State came into the game
needing to win out to secure bowl el
igibility, and its desperation showed,
especially on defense. Led by line
backer Vontaze Burfict, the Sun
Devil defense swarmed the line of
scrimmage, putting pressure on the
Stanford backfield. ASU's front
seven completely stuffed Stanford's
vertical running game. The Cardinal
offensive line, which had dominated
Arizona's much-vaunted defensive
line just a week ago, couldn't find
similar success against the Sun Dev
ils' run defense.
The Sun Devils also distinguished
themselves from earlier Stanford op
ponents in mounting a credible pass
rush. Luck was hurried and hit far
more often than usual, and was
sacked once in the second quarter,
just the fourth sack surrendered by
the Cardinal all season. While Luck
would throw for 292 yards on the
game, he ended with no passing
touchdowns and one interception.
The one bright spot for Stanford's

offense was Wilkerson's play. The
true freshman led the Cardinal in
rushing with 10 carries for 65 yards,
even though he did not enter the
game until the final five minutes of
the third quarter. Taylor, who had
spearheaded Stanford's running at
tack over the last several games,
failed to make any headway against
ASU, finishing with 16 carries for just
39 yards (a lowly 2.4 yards per carry).
Overall, Stanford's rushing attack
tallied a low 3.0 yards per carry, in
cluding 18 carries for only nine yards
in the first half.
