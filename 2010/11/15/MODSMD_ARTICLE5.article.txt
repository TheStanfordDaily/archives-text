# ASU GOES DOWN
## 
### KABIR SAWHNEY MANAGING EDITOR 
With talk of a "letdown game" swirling
around it all week, the No. 6 Stanford football
team headed to Tempe on Saturday to take on
a dangerous Arizona State squad. Despite an
uncharacteristically weak day from the offense,
the Cardinal managed to pull out a win, defeat
ing the Sun Devils (4-6,2-5 Pac-10) by a final
score of 17-13.
Stanford (9-1,6-1) entered the game after a
big win over then-No. 15 Arizona last weekend,
and the magnitude of that game led some com
mentators to predict that the Cardinal would
not come out against the Sun Devils in top
form, leaving itself vulnerable to an upset.
Through the first half, an upset looked like a
distinct possibility, with neither team gaining
any ground and both defenses holding strong.
The half ended in a 7-7 tie, after Stanford senior
kicker Nate Whitaker missed a field goal with
16 seconds left.
The third quarter continued to see strong
defensive play from both teams. After trading
punts to open the second half, Stanford finally
took a lead on a Whitaker field goal, only to

watch the Sun Devils march down the field on
their next drive for a touchdown. A 39-yard run
from running back Cameron Marshall got Ari
zona State into the red zone, and an eight-yard
touchdown pass from quarterback Steven
Threet to wide receiver Kerry Taylor gave the
Sun Devils their first lead of the game at 13-10

(kicker Thomas Weber missed the extra point).
The fourth quarter started with a grim out
look for the Cardinal. After trading punts fol
lowing the Sun Devil touchdown, Stanford was
driving into Arizona State territory with its first
drive of the fourth quarter. Redshirt sopho
more quarterback Andrew Luck threw an in

terception at the ASU six-yard line, giving the
Sun Devils an opportunity to increase their
lead.
However, the Cardinal defense came up
with a stop, forcing Arizona State to punt from

its hopes of a BCS berth alive. Arizona State, with a 4-6 overall record, was officially eliminated from bowl eligibility following Saturday's game.
