## 'Gang of Four' advocates for nonproliferation 
### DEVIN BANERJEE SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
the 1993 START II treaty between the two
nations. If ratified, New Start would limit the
nations' nuclear weapons stockpiles to nearly
two-thirds of their current sizes.

Four former statesmen Flenry
Kissinger, Sam Nunn, George Shultz and
William Perry '49 M.S. '5O addressed an
audience of Stanford students on Friday on
the prospects and challenges of global nu
clear nonproliferation. The gathering
marked the fourth conference held at Stan
ford by the four men, who have come to be
known in their advocacy as the "Gang of
Four."
After a screening of "Nuclear Tipping
Point," a documentary produced by the
Washington, D.C.-based Nuclear Security
Project detailing the men's efforts, the panel,
moderated by Phil Taubman '7O, took ques
tions from the audience.
Asked what must be done in the U.S. to
begin a process toward nuclear nonprolifera
tion and disarmament, Perry said, "The first
thing that needs to be done is the United
States needs to ratify the New Start treaty."
New Start was signed by President Obama
and Russian President Medvedev in April as
a follow-up to the 1991 START I treaty and

In Japan on Sunday, Obama told
Medvedev the U.S. administration is commit
ted to ratifying the treaty during the lame-duck
session of Congress that begins this week.

Asked what actions, if any, the U.S. should
take regarding the security of Pakistan's nu
clear arsenal a common concern in the
field of national security due to declared at
tempts by terrorist networks to obtain nu
clear material each of the four men had an
answer.
"They have their nuclear weapons very
well hidden and secured, to protect them not

only from the Indians but also from the Unit
ed States," Perry said. He would not recom
mend a U.S. military operation in Pakistan to
secure the weapons, he said.
"But we should do what we can to prevent
a nuclear exchange in the Asian subconti
nent," Kissinger added. "This is not some
thing we will observe quietly."

Shultz said the U.S. should engage India
and Pakistan diplomatically and "regional
ize" the answers. "Fortunately, India is less
and less preoccupied with Pakistan and more
aware of its global role," he said.
Nunn said the U.S. should share with
India and Pakistan lessons learned between
the U.S. and Soviet Union during the Cold
War.

Asked what Stanford students can do to
promote nuclear nonproliferation, Perry re
turned to the current legislative prospects:
New Start and the Comprehensive Test Ban
Treaty. The latter was signed by the U.S. in
1996, but its ratification is stalled in the Sen
ate.

"If they fail to be ratified, it will be be
cause the American public doesn't under
stand them," said Perry, who suggested that
students show "Nuclear Tipping Point," the
documentary, to their friends to spread
awareness of the threat posed by nuclear
weapons.

Shultz led the organization of three previ
ous conferences at Stanford on the men's
cause. The first was held at the Hoover Insti
tution in October 2006 on the 20th anniver
sary of the summit in Reykjavik, Iceland, be
tween Presidents Reagan and Gorbachev.
(As Secretary of State, Shultz sat next to
Reagan there.) The following two meetings
were held in October 2007 and September
2009.
