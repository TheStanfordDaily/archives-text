## Hospital names new CEO 
### â€” Elizabeth Titus DAILY NEWS STAFF 
Amir Dan Rubin is set to become president and
chief executive of Stanford Hospital & Clinics on
Jan. 3, the hospital board of directors announced on
Friday.
Rubin, the chief operating officer of the
UCLA Health System in Los Angeles, succeeds
Martha Marsh, who announced in February she
would retire after eight years as Stanford Hospi
tals CEO.
He joins Stanford in the midst of a multi-bil
lion dollar hospital expansion project, which is
still in the approval process at Palo Alto City
Hall. Stanford expects approval of a new $2 bil
lion inpatient facility by the city in 2011; an envi

ronmental impact report for the entire project
went before the city council in May and has been
the basis of some concern in Palo Alto over the
traffic impacts of the project.
Board chair Mariann Byerwalter lauded
Rubin in a statement as an "outstanding execu
tive to lead Stanford Hospital at this transforma
tive time in our history."
Rubin, a Los Angeles native, graduated from
UC-Berkeley and holds two master's degrees
from the University of Michigan. He joined the
UCLA Health System in 2005 and has been in
volved in four hospital projects, including the
$1.5 billion UCLA medical center, Silicon Val
ley/San Jose Business Journal reported.
"Stanford has the ability to change the face of
health care," Rubin said in a statement. "To be part
of an organization that can have such a broad im
pact on humanity is unique and truly inspiring."
