# OBITUARY
## John Tinker, 1958-2010 
### â€” Nicholas Jenkins, Department of English, faculty director of PWR 
After a protracted struggle with cancer, John
Tinker, a long-time lecturer in Stanford's Pro
gram in Writing and Rhetoric (PWR), died on
Nov. 4 at his home in San Francisco at the age of
52.

A special kind of pathos fills the heart when
somebody as involved with writing as John Tinker
was dies. Moments like these remind us that, al
though many of us spend our lives in the midst of
language, no words can ever fill the hole an indi
vidual leaves when they pass away. However, as
those who knew John and took classes with him
or worked with him as a col-

league privately sort through
and ponder over their reminis
cences of their departed teacher
and friend, it is important to
record for the collective memory
how much John Tinker gave to
Stanford and to the culture of
writing and scholarship here of
which we are all parts.
John graduated with a bache-

lor of arts and highest honors in 1990 from UC-
Berkeley. His doctoral dissertation, filed through
the Stanford English department in 1996, was on
"William Beckford: The First English Homosex
ual," with Terry Castle as his dissertation advisor
and John Bender and Bliss Carnochan as readers.
He maintained his interest in the beginnings of
gay culture and the relation between style and
subculture in later years, teaching, for example,
courses on the Gothic novel and writing articles
such as "William Beckford" (2000) and "Vagrant
Sympathies: From Stylistic Analysis to a Peda
gogy of Style" (2003).
At the same time as he kept working on
"style," gay culture and the novel, John Tinker
broadened his interests into other scholarly
areas as well. He joined PWR (or Writing and
Critical Thinking, as it was then called) in 1997.
John was the person who developed PWR's now
long-standing partnership with the Cantor Arts
Center. He was a co-founder of the Hume Writ
ing Center and emerged as a crucial figure in the
evolution of the Writing Center here at Stan
ford, serving as its assistant director between
2004 and 2007 and producing scholarship on the
Center's activities, such as "Generating New
Cultures of Writing: Collaborations between the
Stanford Writing Center and High School Writ
ing Centers" (2006).
Indeed, he was a significant figure in the writ
ing-center world more generally, and he served
for a number of years as a regional representa
tive of the International Writing Centers Associ
ation and as president of the Northern Califor
nia Writing Centers Association. Even as John
was battling with a fatal disease, he remained an
active and uplifting presence in the worlds he
cared about. His last public presentation was
"Invention and Eloquence: Rhetoric in the Mu
seum," a videotaped presentation delivered at a
conference in New Orleans in 2008. Subsequent
ly, he remained for many at Stanford students
and faculty alike the real-life personification
of a subtle, modest, personal eloquence and in
vention in the face of direly adverse circum
stances.
John Tinker will never be replaced. His loss is
irrecoverable. But the Program in Writing and
Rhetoric will do its level best to make sure he is al
ways remembered here with the admiration and af
fection he rightly inspired. There will be a plaque in
the Hume Writing Center to mark his contribu
tions in a permanent and (appropriately) written
form. But the liveliest and happiest tribute John
could have conceived of will be the presence in the
Hume Writing Center of classes of Stanford under
graduates raising their essays to a new level of
power and generally getting a kick out of writing.
