## EDITORIAL The
						Senior Gift Campaign and giving back to the Farm 
### 
A glossy brochure, the University web
site, a VIS tour, and Stanford Maga
zine all rattle off facts and figures
highlighting the pre-eminence of the Farm
the number of award winners, the new build
ings, the sheer amount of land we own and so.
Stanford University has become a world-class
institution for myriad factors, not the least so
for hard dollars and cents. The University
boasts an endowment of more than $l2 bil
lion. The names Knight, Yang, Munger, Bing,
Lokey and Arrillaga adorn newly glistening
buildings. Though rather crass a remark, it is
undeniable that money quite a lot of it
makes life go 'round here on the Farm.
These funds, however, do not appear out
of nowhere. It is quite logical that one of the
largest buildings on campus is the Alumni
Center. Be it the phone calls our parents
began getting after we said we would enroll
here or the letters we receive from our
friends' student groups, fundraising and do
nating are part and parcel of the Stanford ex
perience. For seniors, the anticipated young
alumni fundraising calls will only reinforce
the brutal reality of meager paychecks in the
real world.
Fundraising pleas can be monotonous and
even annoying. However, there is a move
ment afoot that the editorial board would like
to single out for its tangible effect on campus
life: the Senior Gift Campaign. The money

raised does not go toward the endowment. It
will help bring another incredible group of
students to campus. In fact, more than 80 per
cent of all money raised will go straight to fi
nancial aid. The rest will go to fund student
groups and our unique academic programs,
including freshman seminars, Sophomore
College, overseas studies and undergraduate
research fellowships. All are opportunities
that made our Stanford experience priceless.
When visions of the Stanford Calling Cen
ter and insidiously designed invitations sit in
the backs of our minds, the Senior Gift Cam
paign is a tangible way to give back. With
more than 77 percent of the student body re
ceiving some degree of financial aid to attend
Stanford, contributing to the Senior Gift is
giving those who come after us the same in
credible opportunities we have received here
on the Farm. This becomes no longer a matter
of hard, cold cash. This is a means by which
one can help further the aims of this great
school and those lucky enough to attend.
Though the percent of graduating seniors
who donate has consistently lagged behind
those of our peer institutions, the editorial
board strongly urges the Class of 2011, re
gardless of socioeconomics, to find away to
donate to the Senior Gift Campaign. There
are many ways to better the long-term
prospects of the Farm, but here is a chance to
do so now.
