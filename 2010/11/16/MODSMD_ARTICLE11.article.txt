# OP-ED
## ROTC is our choice. Let's make the right one. 
### SAM WINDLEY LL.M. '11 
While the debate over the prospect of
ROTC returning to campus continues
in print, the majority of the Stanford
student body has yet to take ownership of this
issue. But with the ad hoc Faculty Senate com
mittee having already set a deadline for com
munity submissions (Nov. 22), now is the time
for all students to get informed and make their
views heard.
One impediment to student involvement in
the debate thus far has been the framing of ar
guments in terms of Stanford having an "obli
gation" to permit ROTC to return (Kyle O'-
Malley and Evan Storms writing in the Stan
ford Review on Nov. 7) or what Stanford
"owes" students enrolled in ROTC (the Stan
ford Daily editorial board on Sept. 29). To be
absolutely clear: Stanford is a private institu
tion and has absolutely no obligation, legal or
otherwise, to either permit or prohibit ROTC's
presence on campus.
This is an important and exciting fact. It
means that we, as students, have complete free
dom to decide whether or not we want to per
mit the military of this country to have an
ROTC presence on our campus. Obviously
there's no guarantee that the University's final
decision will reflect student opinion, but we can
surely be confident that our views, if expressed
openly and articulately, will play a significant
role in the administration's decision-making
process.
So the question we must all consider is clear:
should we permit the military to have an
ROTC presence on campus? The answer will
logically depend on what the effects of on-cam
pus ROTC would be and, if the effects of on
campus ROTC would be positive overall,
whether Stanford's resources could instead be
allocated in ways that would have greater posi
tive overall effects.
Of course, if the effects of on-campus
ROTC would be negative overall, as my re
search has led me to suspect, there is no need to
consider the opportunity cost of allocating
Stanford's resources to this cause. However, if
your own research leads to a different conclu
sion with respect to the effects of on-campus
ROTC, don't forget to also consider the fact
that, by allocating resources to ROTC, Stan
ford would not be in a position to allocate re

sources to some other, potentially more benefi
cial, project.
As for the probable effects of on-campus
ROTC, one way to approach the issue is to ask
why the military would ostensibly jump at the
chance to establish an ROTC training center
on our campus. Would this enable them to sig
nificantly increase the number of scholarships
they grant? Probably not.The number of schol
arships is largely determined by the military's
need for officers (which, incidentally, is current
ly quite low in all branches other than the
army). And even if it would increase the num
ber of scholarships or cause more students to
join, I'm not sure that convenience should be
the dispositive factor in students' decisions to
dedicate nine to 12 years of their lives to the
military.
Would it enable the military to train ROTC
candidates more efficiently? Again, probably
not. While it may be less convenient for the stu
dents being trained, it is surely more efficient
for large numbers of students to be trained in a
single location than in multiple smaller training
centers. (One exception might be if Stanford
was to bear a significant portion of the cost of
establishing the on-campus center, which
would, in my view, be a highly questionable use
of University resources.) So what would be the
military's motivation for coming here?
Michael Schwartz, professor of sociology at
S.U.N.Y. Stony Brook, offered the following ex
planation last year: The military hopes a "high
ly visible presence on (especially a high pres
tige) campus ... will provide the opportunity
for the military to integrate itself into campus
life," He continues: "ROTC programs on ...
campus allow the military to burnish its image
while presenting its distinct point of vie w about
national and global issues to the campus."
Observations such as these leave me seri
ously doubting the positive effects of on-cam
pus ROTC. But whatever your conclusions, I
urge you to take ownership of this issue. Do
your own research, talk to other students and
make your voice heard, while also remaining
open to changing your opinion if presented
with new information. The future character of
our campus depends on it.
