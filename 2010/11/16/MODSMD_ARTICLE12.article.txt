## Hype Machine 
### Jade Wang 
Let's keep this between friends, but for a
woman whose primary hobbies include
cooking and reading, I love partying a
whole lot. I'll admit, I write to you now in the
post-raging haze of sore muscles and hoarse
voice, but it's an affirming sort of tired, and I've
promised my body countless times that we'll
be healthier from now on. I think it goes with
out saying that I love the actual party portion
of the process, but, before my most recent bo
nanza, I found myself greatly enjoying the
planning, preparation and hype.
Looking through my Daily column history,
a study in nerdy neuroticism and the occasion
al venture into debauchery, it's no surprise that
I feel as if I were built for party planning. I get
to make numerous lists and timelines, but the
subject matter is far more interesting than the
usual problem sets and exam schedules. For
this party, I made the usual guest list spread
sheets and agonized over the hors d'oeuvre
choices for longer than was strictly necessary. I
scoured music blogs like it was my job for the
playlist, which was carefully timed to wind
down when I promised our neighbors we
would. I rearranged furniture with all too
much thought given to the flow of crowds and
likelihood that our living room could turn into
a dance floor. (Verdict? Can it ever.)
I love planning, and I love parties, but I've

recently found a new part of the process that's
amazingly fun the hype. It's strange; I never
considered myself social or community man
ager material, in fact opting for the sadder iter
ation in that group and communing mostly
with groceries. I am so actively bad at circulat
ing and meeting new people at parties that I
generally just park in a corner, preferably by
some pita chips, and wait it out. But I may have
turned into a hype machine these past few
weeks. I talked up the party I threw with a
nearly religious fervor, promising potential
guests the rendezvous of their dreams. My fel
low hostesses and I refined our theme and in
vented a tagline, which punctuated the strate
gically timed invitation and reminder e-mail. A
legitimate graphic designer professionally
shopped the flier, and the invitation text was
edited carefully by, well, a Daily columnist.
Lest you think I did not try hard enough, I'll
own up to the biggest and most embarrassing
bit we made a promotional video. Admit
tedly, I had to be convinced by roommates who
are more fun than I am, but I actually relished
my time in the spotlight and am waiting impa
tiently for the video to go viral.
I enjoyed the hyping process a lot more
than I thought I would. It leveraged many of
my skills: advanced planning, over-thinking my
actions, giving things catchy names and being

friendly and unthreatening. It reminded me of
the feeling I used to love, circa 2005, when I was
serious about high school debate, of all things.
It was convincing people that they wanted
whatever I was talking about, and reframing as
appropriate for the individual and the time. I
used to get this slightly deranged look that was
my "tell" when I thought I had won a debate,
something between a pucker and a smirk. I
found myself pucker-smirking as I sold this
party, and as soon as I noticed, I felt a little soul
less. It does sound a little disturbing my ne
farious plan to make people come to my party
using rhetoric (or something), but I promise,
this time at least, my intentions were pure. It's
a party! Of course people wanted to come;
sometimes they just need a little convincing,
and I was happy to oblige. Hype it's a satis
fying challenge, and it just feels right.
In my excitement, in fact, I may have start
ed the hype for the next soiree I am hosting. All
I do is party? I'm not sure how it happened, but
I seem to have convinced even myself.
