# GIRL YOU KNOW IT'S TRUE
## Where Your Favorite TV Shows Will Be Five Years from Now 
### Jordan Carr 
Fox just renewed "The Simpsons" for a
23rd season, meaning that it is contractu
ally obligated to pass 500 episodes, which
is, well, a lot. Not many shows run that long
"Lassie" and "Gunsmoke" are the only other
primetime shows to pass the 500-episode bar
rier. Given the way "The Simpsons" have had
to redefine the show's timeline flashbacks
to Marge and Homer's courtship have taken
place in both the 1970s and early 1990s it is
interesting to wonder where the plots of vari
ous other television programs will be five
years from now.
"The Office"
The elusive filmmakers behind the show fi
nally show the workplace-based documentary
they've been working on for the past two
decades and have a private screening in the
Dunder Mifflin conference room. Dunder
Mifflin employees who had been excited
about the movie are very upset by their nega
tive portrayal in the film. In his triumphant re
turn, Regional Manager Michael Scott (Steve
Carell) tries to get the documentarians to cut
out all the parts that make him look stupid. As
things get awkward, Jim looks into the camera
and makes a face.
"Glee"
Just kidding, this show will obviously be off
the air within a year or two.
"Desperate Housewives"
No longer able to trade on the "sex appeal"
(?) of its stars, "Desperate Housewives" be
comes more and more about menopause, back
pain, diabetes and other old lady problems. A
few episodes into season 12, the producers of
the show begin to broadcast "Golden Girls"
reruns in place of new "Desperate House
wives" episodes, and nobody notices.

"Entourage"
Rumors of its impending finale notwith
standing, in five years, everyone's favorite
show about what it's like to be good-looking,
short and successful in Hollywood will have
the making of "Entourage " episodes down to
a science. Ari Gold (Jeremy Piven) will walk
fast and yell hurtful things. Stanford MBA
Lloyd Lee will prance around effeminately
and give Aria motivational speech. Eric "E"
Murphy will walk fast and try to physically in
timidate other 5-foot-4-inch men. Johnny
Drama will fail to pick up a woman and suffer
a career setback that ultimately turns in his
favor. Turtle's plot will revolve around secur
ing a pair of fancy sneakers.
The show's ostensible protagonist, Vincent
Chase will appear just once in the episode,
talking on the phone while either preparing to
or just finishing having sex with some name
less, topless woman.
"Outsourced"
By the time its sixth season rolls around,
"Outsourced" will be by far the most popular
show on television for the simple reason that
Indian people are uniquely worthy of our de
rision and mockery. I mean, over there they
name people (get this) Manmeet.That means
penis in our entirely different language. Hilar
ious!

"Conan"
After TBS forces embattled late night talk
show host Conan O'Brien to step aside so that
George Lopez can take his time slot, Conan's
new show, "O'Brien" will ride a swell of popu
lar support to a highly rated opening night,
which will be immediately followed by every
one going back to not caring about him.
"Mad Men"
As Don Draper (Jon Hamm) and his fel
low advertising hotshots lead their firm Ster
ling Cooper Draper Pryce Campbell & Hol
loway into the 19705, the issues of racism, sex
ism and anti-Semitism that had in large part
defined previous seasons disappear the in
stant a new decade begins.
Desperate for plots, the show's writers hap
hazardly scan the Wikipedia page for 1970 and
as a result, most episodes surround characters
milling about the newly-invented watercooler
and discuss such events as Tonga gaining inde
pendence, Edward Heath being elected as
prime minister of the United Kingdom and
NBC anchor Chet Huntley retiring from full
time broadcasting.

"Dancing with the Stars"
After America suddenly realizes that ball
room dancing is boring enough to do, let alone
watch, ratings lag until sitting President Sarah
Palin follows in her daughter's footsteps and
has a child out of wedlock appears on the pro
gram as a contestant.Though her first perform
ance initially excites a base of supporters, even
tually her insistence on always leading her
partner in a line dance routine to "God Bless
the USA" and claim that any judge who gives
her bad marks is "Muslimist" begins to grate.
