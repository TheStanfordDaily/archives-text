## Here's who to root for, Card fans 
### Zach Zimmerman Dishing the Rock 
I have to admit: I'm having difficul
ty writing this column with fingers
that currently feature mere rem
nants of nails and mauled cuticles.
Last weekend's game against Ari
zona State was horrifying. A team with
just two wins against FBS opponents
nearly ended Stanford's BCS dreams
and sent a Shockwave through Cardinal
fans that screamed, "The season ain't
over yet!"
I was fortunate enough to have been
inTempe for the defensive slugfest and
was thus deprived of the world-class tel
evision commentary that my friends
back at school described as "awful,"
"homer" and "hilarious."
What I did catch wind of was that
those watching the Stanford game on
TV were also tuned in to the surprising
thriller between No. 1 Oregon and Cal
ifornia, a game that should have been
decided after two quarters but came
down to just two points. My girlfriend
let me know that the majority of the
people she was watching the game with
were cheering for Cal to come away vic
torious.
I understand the logic. Our second
half implosion in Eugene is what's pre
venting us from competing for a spot in
the national title game. The Ducks ru
ined our mightiest football dreams, so
watching them lose to an unranked
motley crew like Cal is sweet revenge.
You know what's even sweeter?
Spending the holidays in Pasadena in
stead of San Antonio, Texas.
For the football illiterate, the BCS
makes no sense. For those fluent in the
language of the game, it makes even less
sense. But you don't need to understand
the formula to correctly serve your role
as a Stanford football fan.
Here's the deal. We aren't going to
play for a national championship. Is the
Cardinal mathematically eliminated?
No, but neither am I from securing the
Lakers' starting point guard job. What
we want is a berth in the Rose Bowl, a
game that we haven't visited since 2000
and haven't won since 1972.That was 18
years before I came into the world.
To make this happen, Oregon needs
to win out. Unless there's another
drug/frat theft scandal or mass exodus
of players to Ole Miss's Park and
Recreation Management graduate pro
gram, the Ducks won't lose again.
The team that needs to lose is No. 2
Auburn, whose Heisman frontrunner
quarterback Cam Newton is caught in a
whirlwind of controversy. The Tigers
have admittedly been impressive this
season, but they still need to travel to
Tuscaloosa to take on Alabama, the
reigning national champion and a team
that, despite two losses, can still beat
anyone in the nation.
If Auburn loses, it will open up a spot
in the title game for non-qualifying
schools Boise State and TCU. We just
need one of those two to compete for
the championship, and if and it still is
a HUGE if â€”Stanford wins out, the
Card will fill Oregon's void in the Rose
Bowl.
So if you royally screwed up your
cheering last weekend, you can redeem
yourself in the final few weeks of the
college football season. Love the
Ducks. Cherish them, pray for their suc
cess, do whatever needs to be done to
ensure that their potent offense doesn't
self-destruct in the final game of the sea
son against an Oregon State team that
was just pummeled by Washington
State.
Do the exact opposite to Auburn. If
you know voodoo, go to town. On Nov.
26, cheer for Alabama like Alabama
cheers for NASCAR. For just one day,
take back the hexes you put on Mark
Ingram last year as he stole a Heisman
from Toby and the Farm. We love the
Crimson Tide.

But most importantly, cheer for the
Cardinal. Even rf you haven't been to a
single game this season and can't distin
guish Andrew Luck from Andrew
Bynum, it's never too late to start. Read
Dan Bohm's column from yesterday to
understand just how important this
weekend's game is with Cal, and know
that even if Stanford wins by four
touchdowns, the season finale against
Oregon State at home is no gimmie. If
the Card is 10-1, any excuses that have
been used in past games for empty seats
at Stanford Stadium will no longer be
valid.
I understand that it's difficult to
build a football culture in just two years
and that, in Silicon Valley, it's hard to re
ally grasp the importance of football at

an academic institution like Stanford.
But a Rose Bowl appearance comes
with benefits that would trickle down
into every nook and cranny of this uni
versity. It's a priceless experience for a
budding program.
The Alamo Bowl is not, and a return
trip to Texas this year would be a devas

tating finish to a magical season.
Let's celebrate the New Year with a
Rose Bowl victory.
