# A 						SOLID START
## Men's basketball wins season opener 
### ZACH ZIMMERMAN DESK EDITOR 
Only a handful of the members of the
Stanford men's basketball team were
around for last year's season-opening loss
to San Diego. That didn't stop one of the
youngest squads in the Pac-10 from seek
ing revenge.
The Cardinal began its season in strong
defensive fashion on Monday night, sti
fling the Toreros en route to a sloppy 64-48
win at Maples Pavilion.
The first half went according to plan
for the Cardinal, who used stingy perime
ter defense to hold San Diego to just 19
points. Although head coach Johnny
Dawkins is faced with the challenge of a
youthful team, it worked to his advantage
last night as the Stanford squad looked
noticeably quicker on both ends of the
floor.
"I really liked our effort defensively for
most of the game," Dawkins said. "Our
guys were alert. I thought we played 30
minutes of really solid defense"
Stanford was faced with early adversity
as star junior guard Jeremy Green picked
up two quick fouls in just over three min
utes on the floor. Fortunately for Stanford,
its new-look bench filled in admirably.
Junior forward Andrew Zimmermann
led the way in the first half with 10 points
off the bench, including a tip-in off junior
guard Jarrett Mann's missed jumper as
time expired. Sophomore guard Gabriel
Harris, who saw limited playing time in his
freshman season due to foot injuries, hit
three of his four attempts from the floor
and tacked on seven first-half points.

Zimmermann attributed his success to
hard training in the off-season.
"It's putting in work in the summer just
to gain that confidence," he said.
The story early, however, was the Stan
ford defense. After San Diego sophomore
forward Chris Manresa knotted the game
at 7-7 with a layup, the Cardinal went on an
18-0 run, holding the Toreros scoreless for
nearly eight minutes.
Freshman forward Josh Fluestis
recorded two of Stanford's four first-half
blocks, the second of which landed in the
crowd. The Cardinal forced 12 turnovers
in the opening period, and coughed the
ball up just three times.
Huestis' classmate Dwight Powell,
Stanford's most highly touted recruit,
was impressive early in his debut. While
he scored just five points, he played the
surprising role as a 6-foot-11 facilitator,
dishing out three assists among several
crafty passes that produced a positive re
action from the relatively full Sixth Man
section.
"Dwight is very versatile," Dawkins
said. "He can play the perimeter, he can
play inside. We want him to play both
[small forward and power forward] for us
as he keeps progressing."
Stanford entered the break with a 35-
19 lead with five Cardinal freshmen seeing
action.
The 16-point lead quickly shrank to 10,
as San Diego came out firing at the start of
the second half. Junior guard Darian Nor
ris hit two consecutive three-point shots
and brought the game back to 35-25.
"You give them credit," Dawkins said.
"They did a great job of making adjust
ments, especially starting the second half."
Stanford junior center Jack Trotter ex
tended the Cardinal lead back to 12 after
drilling two technical free throws as a re
sult of a battle in the post with Torero red
shirt sophomore big man Chris Gabriel.

San Diego got within eight points on a
basket by Manresa, but never fully closed
the gap. Timely assists by Mann to Owens
and Zimmermann in addition to contin
ued hot shooting by Harris put the game
out of reach.
Zimmermann and Harris scored 14
and 12 points, respectively. While Harris
was expected to improve with a year in the
Stanford system under his belt, Dawkins
couldn't help but smile when asked if the
second-year guard's performance was ex
pected.
"I would be lying if I said it was,"
Dawkins said. "He's definitely improved
as a shooter."
Norris and Devin Ginty led the
Toreros, contributing 10 apiece. Neither
team shot well from the floor, with Stan
ford winning an ugly offensive battle on
just 40.7 percent shooting.
What Dawkins' team lacked in offense
it made up for in defense, forcing 20
turnovers and winning the rebounding
battle 40 to 27.
Stanford used 12 men over the course
of the game, with substitutions aplenty.
While Dawkins acknowledges the depth
of the team, he is hesitant to commit to a
set lineup.
"That's a game-by-game thing," he
said. "I like the fact that we have more
depth. It keeps fresher guys on the floor
and keeps the level of intensity up."
The Cardinal will look to keep its ener
gy high when it plays host to Virginia (2-0)
this Thursday. The Cavaliers have started
the season strong, winning decisively in
their matchups against William & Mary
and South Carolina Upstate.
Tipoff between the undefeated teams
is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. at Maples Pavil
ion.
