# Winning in Washington
## 
### CAROLINE CASELLI DESK EDITOR 
Faced with a grueling schedule of back-to-back
evening matches and several hundred miles of travel in
between, the No. 2 Stanford women's volleyball team
showed no sign of fatigue, bringing down Washington
State (6-18,0-14 Pac-10) and No. 11 Washington (18-7,7-
7) on the road last weekend.
On Friday the Card (22-2,13-2) headed to Pullman to
take on Washington State, the only team yet to win a
Pac-10 match this season. Though the Cougars put up a
fight Stanford lost a tight second set they did not
find that elusive victory against the Cardinal, which re
grouped to take the match, 25-20,23-25,25-19,25-13.
With a missed serve by the Cougars followed by two
aces from Stanford's freshman middle blocker Carly
Wopat, the Card jumped out to a 3-0 lead in the first set
and never looked back, taking the set, 25-20.
Washington State caught Stanford off guard at the
opening of the second set, and the Cardinal trailed 6-2
after several attack errors and strong hitting and serving
from the Cougars. Stanford did not tie the score back up
until 22-22, but the momentum remained in Washington
State's hands a block and kill helped seal the second
set in the Cougars' favor, 23-25.
However, the second set proved to be an anomaly,
with the Card decisively taking early leads and main
taining them in the next two sets, winning them 25-19
and 25-13, respectively.
Four Stanford players had kills in double digits: sen
ior outside hitter Alix Klineman, the match leader with
18, senior setter Cassidy Lichtman with 13, sophomore
opposite Hayley Spelman with 12 and redshirt sopho
more middle blocker Jessica Walker with 10. As a unit,

the Cardinal front line was extremely efficient, outhit
ting the Cougars .408 to .258. Senior libero Gabi Ailes
led the defense with 16 digs and became the first Cardi
nal and only seventh Pac-10 player ever to tally 2,000 ca
reer digs.
For Washington State, junior outside hitter Meagan
Ganzer posted 17 kills, and sophomore opposite Rachel

The Stanford volleyball team powered through a road
trip last weekend, defeating both Washington and
Washington State. Stanford will now travel to Cal to try
to avenge one of its two losses this season.
Todorovich added another 12.
Sophomore middle blocker Conley
Kipp led the match with five blocks,
and freshman setter Sara Biondi had
43 assists.
The Card had little time to rest,
traveling across the state to face
Washington the following evening.
The Huskies, fresh off their first
home loss of the season to No. 4 Cal
ifornia the night before, challenged
Stanford all night, but ultimately fell
to the Cardinal in four close sets.
Stanford opened the match with a
hitting error, which set the tone for
the Cardinal's first-set woes. Al
though the score was tied at 17-17,
consecutive missed serves and un
forced hitting errors by Stanford
helped Washington to a 25-21 first set
win.
The Cardinal came out stronger
after the break, with each remaining
set coming down to the final few
points. In the second set, neither
team led by more than three points,
and a missed Washington serve and
hitting error ultimately gave the
Card a 26-24 decision.
Stanford held a two to three point
lead over the Huskies for the majori
ty of the third set, until relinquishing
the lead at 21-20. Nonetheless, back

to-back Washington hitting errors
followed by kills from Spelman and
Klineman secured a 25-22 third set
for the Card.
Like the second set, Stanford's
and Washington's point differential
was never more than three in the
fourth set. However, when the match
appeared to be headed to a fifth set
the Huskies had set point at 22-24
the Card, powered by four consec
utive kills from Klineman, rallied to
win the set and the match, 26-24.
Lichtman recorded her second
triple-double of the season, with 30
assists, 12 kills and 10 digs, while
Klineman posted a match-high 24
kills as well as 10 digs for her 11th
double-double this year. Defensive
ly, sophomore setter Karissa Cook
had a career-high 20 digs, and Ailes
recorded a season-best 27 digs.
Senior outside hitters Kindra
Carlson and Becky Perry led the
Huskies with 20 kills and 15 kills, re
spectively. Carlson also had 14 digs,
three blocks and an ace in the match.
Senior setter Jenna Hagglund tallied
14 digs and 54 assists, becoming only
the 10th setter in Pac-10 history to
record 5,000 career assists.
On Friday, the Card will face Cal
in Berkeley. The match, which has
Pac-10 title implications, will be held
at 7 p.m. in Haas Pavilion.
