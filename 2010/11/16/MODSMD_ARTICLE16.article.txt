# Winning in Washington
## 
### CAROLINE CASELLI DESK EDITOR 
Faced with a grueling schedule of back-to-back
evening matches and several hundred miles of travel in
between, the No. 2 Stanford women's volleyball team
showed no sign of fatigue, bringing down Washington
State (6-18,0-14 Pac-10) and No. 11 Washington (18-7,7-
7) on the road last weekend.
On Friday the Card (22-2,13-2) headed to Pullman to
take on Washington State, the only team yet to win a
Pac-10 match this season. Though the Cougars put up a
fight Stanford lost a tight second set they did not
find that elusive victory against the Cardinal, which re
grouped to take the match, 25-20,23-25,25-19,25-13.
With a missed serve by the Cougars followed by two
aces from Stanford's freshman middle blocker Carly
Wopat, the Card jumped out to a 3-0 lead in the first set
and never looked back, taking the set, 25-20.
Washington State caught Stanford off guard at the
opening of the second set, and the Cardinal trailed 6-2
after several attack errors and strong hitting and serving
from the Cougars. Stanford did not tie the score back up
until 22-22, but the momentum remained in Washington
State's hands a block and kill helped seal the second
set in the Cougars' favor, 23-25.
However, the second set proved to be an anomaly,
with the Card decisively taking early leads and main
taining them in the next two sets, winning them 25-19
and 25-13, respectively.
Four Stanford players had kills in double digits: sen
ior outside hitter Alix Klineman, the match leader with
18, senior setter Cassidy Lichtman with 13, sophomore
opposite Hayley Spelman with 12 and redshirt sopho
more middle blocker Jessica Walker with 10. As a unit,

the Cardinal front line was extremely efficient, outhit
ting the Cougars .408 to .258. Senior libero Gabi Ailes
led the defense with 16 digs and became the first Cardi
nal and only seventh Pac-10 player ever to tally 2,000 ca
reer digs.
For Washington State, junior outside hitter Meagan
Ganzer posted 17 kills, and sophomore opposite Rachel
