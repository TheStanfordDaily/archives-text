# MEN'S WATER POLO
## Cardinal water polo splits a pair 
### DASH DAVIDSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford men's water polo
team had a busy weekend, pulling
away from UC-D avis late to surge to
a 12-4 victory at Davis on Friday
night. On Sunday, the Cardinal
couldn't keep up its momentum,
falling just short against Pacific, 10-
9. No. 4 Stanford (13-6, 5-2 MPSF)
was involved in two senior games
this weekend, spoiling the fun at
Davis with its victory and then hav
ing its own celebration marred by
the loss to Pacific.
No. 13 UC-Davis (16-8) provid
ed the Cardinal a tough and tight
game for the first three periods of
the match, before finally ceding and
getting outscored 5-0 in the final
quarter. This victory continued an
impressive streak for Stanford: it
was the Card's fifth straight win by
more than five goals and its sixth
straight victory overall.
Junior driver Jacob Smith paced
the offense with a hat trick, moving
his goals-per-game average to 2.47,
which is good for third in the Moun
tain Pacific Sports Federation
(MPSF). Junior utility Peter Sefton

(two goals) and a host of other play
ers who netted a goal apiece joined
Smith in the scoring parade.
In goal, redshirt junior Brian Pin
gree presided over a defense that
routinely stifled the Aggies, afford
ing them only eight shots on goal in
the game, with Pingree saving four
of them. The Stanford defense was
particularly staunch when the game
was the closest, at the end of the
third quarter and throughout the
fourth, holding the Aggies scoreless
for the final 11:20 of the game.
Sunday brought about the hon
oring of Stanford's four seniors
Alex Pulido, Jeffrey Schwimer, Eric
Clapper and team captain Sage
Wright for their final home game
at Avery Aquatic Center.
Sunday should have been a day
of celebration for these four seniors,
but Pacific got in the way, playing the
role of spoiler on a bright and hot
Sunday afternoon.
The Tigers (15-9,3-4 MPSF) are
ranked No. 6 in the country and
pulled off an upset of Stanford, 10-9,
beating the Cardinal for the first
time since the 2006 season.
They accomplished this victory
largely through the offensive efforts
of senior Joey Gullickson, who re
peatedly beat the Stanford defense
on his way to scoring a game-high five
goals.
The play of sophomore driver
Paul Rudolph, who netted three goals
and Wright, who added two of his
own, led the Stanford offense.
The defense, spotty for much of
the beginning of the game, tightened
up down the pivotal stretch run, and
allowed Stanford to claw its way back
in the game by holding Pacific score
less over the final six minutes of the
game.
With six minutes left, in front of a
large crowd containing mainly Stan
ford supporters and a solitary section
of rowdy Pacific fans, the Cardinal
trailed 10-6. From that point
on, Stanford turned up the heat on
the Tigers, cutting the deficit quickly
to 10-8 in the span of a minute. Its
next goal, though, was not scored
until a mere 59 seconds remained in
the game. A comeback was still not
entirely out of the question until, with
20 seconds left and Pacific intensely
trying to run out the clock, a defen
sive foul was called on what appeared
to be a clean Stanford steal.

The Stanford players were con
fused and upset and shouts of "what
was that?" could be heard from the
stands. The game ended shortly after
this foul call, as Pacific simply held
the ball, making short, easy passes,
until the clock showed zeros.The Car
dinal remained agitated by the call
after the game ended, with most play
ers leaving the pool deck quickly
after the final whistle. Head coach
John Vargas shouted at the referees
as the call was made, but it was to no
avail.
Next up for the Cardinal is the an
nual Big Splash on Friday night in
Berkeley. The Golden Bears are
ranked No. 1 in the country and top
the MPSF standings. Friday's game
will go a long way toward determin
ing Stanford's ranking in the season
ending MPSF Tournament, which be
gins on Nov. 26 at Avery Aquatic Cen
ter. With a win, the Cardinal could
rise to the No. 2 ranking, but it could
fall to No. 5 with a loss.
