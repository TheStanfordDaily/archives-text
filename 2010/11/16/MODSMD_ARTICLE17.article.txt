# MEN'S WATER POLO
## Cardinal water polo splits a pair 
### DASH DAVIDSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford men's water polo
team had a busy weekend, pulling
away from UC-D avis late to surge to
a 12-4 victory at Davis on Friday
night. On Sunday, the Cardinal
couldn't keep up its momentum,
falling just short against Pacific, 10-
9. No. 4 Stanford (13-6, 5-2 MPSF)
was involved in two senior games
this weekend, spoiling the fun at
Davis with its victory and then hav
ing its own celebration marred by
the loss to Pacific.
No. 13 UC-Davis (16-8) provid
ed the Cardinal a tough and tight
game for the first three periods of
the match, before finally ceding and
getting outscored 5-0 in the final
quarter. This victory continued an
impressive streak for Stanford: it
was the Card's fifth straight win by
more than five goals and its sixth
straight victory overall.
Junior driver Jacob Smith paced
the offense with a hat trick, moving
his goals-per-game average to 2.47,
which is good for third in the Moun
tain Pacific Sports Federation
(MPSF). Junior utility Peter Sefton

(two goals) and a host of other play
ers who netted a goal apiece joined
Smith in the scoring parade.
In goal, redshirt junior Brian Pin
gree presided over a defense that
routinely stifled the Aggies, afford
ing them only eight shots on goal in
the game, with Pingree saving four
of them. The Stanford defense was
particularly staunch when the game
was the closest, at the end of the
third quarter and throughout the
fourth, holding the Aggies scoreless
for the final 11:20 of the game.
Sunday brought about the hon
oring of Stanford's four seniors
Alex Pulido, Jeffrey Schwimer, Eric
Clapper and team captain Sage
Wright for their final home game
at Avery Aquatic Center.
Sunday should have been a day
of celebration for these four seniors,
but Pacific got in the way, playing the
role of spoiler on a bright and hot
Sunday afternoon.
The Tigers (15-9,3-4 MPSF) are
ranked No. 6 in the country and
pulled off an upset of Stanford, 10-9,
beating the Cardinal for the first
time since the 2006 season.
