# Splash attracts more students
## Program brings local middle- and high-school students to Stanford 
### ELLORA ISRANI CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
This weekend, more than a thousand mid
dle and high school students descended on
Stanford campus to take part in Splash, a
semiannual, two-day event run by Stanford
Educational Studies Program that offers spe
cialized classes taught by Stanford students
and faculty.
The 257 classes this year included options in
sciences, arts, mathematics and engineering
and hobbies. Offerings ranged from "How
Your Brain Lies To You, and How To Think
More Clearly" to "To Hell with Volunteering"
to "The Art of Hair Curling with a Hair
Straightener."
"As a core group we don't dictate what
gets taught," said Scott Meyer, a Splash par
ticipant at M.I.T. and one of the program's
initiators at Stanford. "It's kind of whatever
gets offered to us."
The most popular classes are "a mix be

tween the things that you would assume to be
popular and the truly random," said physics
graduate student Michael Shaw, a co-founder
and director of the program at Stanford. "There
was a student last Splash who was signed up for
ice cream making, which is one of the hardest
classes to get into, and she cut that class to go to
a series of physics lectures."
An especially popular class, which Shaw
teaches every year, is "On Black Holes, Singu
larities and the Event Horizon: A Journey into
the Abyss," which enrolls about 120 students
per session.
"He has figured out the formula for what
gets those kids to come," Meyer said.
Enrollment this time reached 1,400 stu
dents, the largest number ever among the West
coast campuses that run Splash programs and
the first time Stanford topped 1,000. Although
final attendance figures are not in yet, Shaw
predicts about 80 percent participation.
Despite the popularity of the program,
Splash faces a number of challenges every

year. Registration has been front-loaded
in fact, the program had 600 registered partic
ipants within six hours of opening its online
system but more volunteers from Stan
ford, especially undergraduates, are needed
to help with the program, according to Ben
Shank, a fourth-year physics grad student and
Splash's financial manager for the last three
years.
"We are teacher-limited," Shank said. "We
need more Stanford students to help us deal
with high school interest."
Shank said the program is interested in
pursuing collaboration with more Stanford
departments in order to increase class variety
and offerings. For example, piano classes were
offered for the first time this year as a result of
collaboration with Braun Music Center.
Regardless of the challenges, the future re
mains promising for Splash. Enrollment is
growing at 50 percent per year, and students are
coming from as far as Reno and San Diego.
"We constantly get barraged with people

saying, 'Why didn't we hear about this? Why
didn't you tell us sooner?'" Meyer said. "And
we're making all the effort we can."
Splash co-president Dana Leeman, a third
year graduate student in cancer biology, said
one of the most rewarding aspects of the pro
gram was the positive feedback received from
students brought in from underprivileged com
munities.

"A lot of them have never seen a college
campus before or have never been in classes
taught hands-on," Leeman said. "Kids said they
enjoyed learning for the first time, or consid
ered for the first time going to college... we're
hoping to find more money for that kind of out
reach."
