A Stanford music professor is co-founder of the
company holding the spot this week for No. 1 best
seller among paid iPad apps.
Magic Fiddle is the latest installment in an effort
from Smule, a company co-founded by assistant music
professor Ge Wang, to bring music to the masses, no

said.

fun with music but also to have people try something
new, Wang said.
"We tried to make this for everyone," Wang said,
"or at least for anyone who has interest in playing
music or likes music."
Smule gives back to the University through its re
search on mobile devices and social interactions, a
study based in the Center for Computer Research in
Music and Acoustics. The research looks at what mo
bile social experiences can be created by using cloud
computing and new devices to bring the global com
munity together to make music.
Smule's research and work have expanded rapidly
in recent years, leading Wang to teach a new course at
Stanford called "Mobile Music," in which the design
aesthetics and technical aspects of developing social
mobile device platforms are explored.
With Magic Fiddle, Smule hopes to bring musical
performance closer to the carefree associations of
