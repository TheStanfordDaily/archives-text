## Smule's Magic Fiddle gains popularity Assistant music professor Ge Wang's company creates new iPad app

A Stanford music professor is co-founder of the
company holding the spot this week for No. 1 best
seller among paid iPad apps.
Magic Fiddle is the latest installment in an effort
from Smule, a company co-founded by assistant music
professor Ge Wang, to bring music to the masses, no
matter one's musical background.
Smule, the company that produced iPad and
iPhone applications such as Ocarina and Leaf Tro
mbone, created the Magic Fiddle from an idea born after
virtuoso pianist Lang Lang, in an encore performance
at a concert, performed a piece on a Smule-created
piano app instead of the piano on stage.
"Why not try to take advantage of all this new tech
nology for people to do something different?" Wang
said.
The purpose of the Magic Fiddle is not only to have
fun with music but also to have people try something
new, Wang said.
"We tried to make this for everyone," Wang said,
"or at least for anyone who has interest in playing
music or likes music."
Smule gives back to the University through its re
search on mobile devices and social interactions, a
study based in the Center for Computer Research in
Music and Acoustics. The research looks at what mo
bile social experiences can be created by using cloud
computing and new devices to bring the global com
munity together to make music.
Smule's research and work have expanded rapidly
in recent years, leading Wang to teach a new course at
Stanford called "Mobile Music," in which the design
aesthetics and technical aspects of developing social
mobile device platforms are explored.
With Magic Fiddle, Smule hopes to bring musical
performance closer to the carefree associations of
playing an app. That is not to say that
the Magic Fiddle is only a game
those with experience, including Stan
ford's St. Lawrence String Quartet,
can use their previous knowledge
while using the application.
The Magic Fiddle differs from pre
existing musical applications because
the application is more of an expres
sive musical instrument that has game
like aspects, leaving more space for
creativity and flow, Wang said. Instead
of having the song pre-recorded, the
player creates the music off the iPad
a detail that closes the gap between
technology product and musical in
strument.
The application comes with a story
book, which teaches the user how to
play. First, it shows how to hold the
iPad correctly, perched on the left
shoulder; then, it teaches about notes

and eventually introduces songs. The
iPad is far from a traditional violin
there are things that the iPad cannot
provide, like the tactile feedback of an
actual instrument but the musical
selections strive to recreate the musi
cal experience.
Magic Fiddle's songbook is full of
classical music. Although the music is
limited to one genre, Wang felt that the
classical music is the usual repertoire
associated with the violin and it re
mains a constant favorite among the
users. In the future, more song choices
will also be available.
The application also asks you to
name the fiddle, creating a bond be
tween musician and instrument. Wang
wanted to expose more people to the
practice of making music.
"We want [to] make musical expe
riences for people that take away inhi
bition," Wang said. "Why don't we
have the fiddle teach you how to play
itself?"
