## Study examines neurons and movement Stanford researchers' findings shed light on 'movement planning' 
### ERIN INMAN STAFF WRITER 
"Imagine you're a golfer, set up to tee, get
ting ready to swing," said electrical engineer
ing researcher Mark Churchland. "Some
thing goes on inside your brain. Getting
ready to hit the ball, to be motionless, means

something."
Despite the observed motionless nature
of your body, your brain is full of movement.
Neurons are firing, taking you from a base
line state to a starting state. Now, a Nov. 4
publication by a group of Stanford re
searchers in "Neuron" has explored the activ
ity of cortical neurons responsible for move
ment planning and execution.
Krishna Shenoy, associate professor of en
gineering, was the paper's senior author,
while Churchland was the lead author. A
graduate student, Matthew Kaufman, and

two other researchers, John Cunningham,
and Stephen Ryu, are also authors of the
paper.
The previously held belief postulated that
neurons would "vote" for movements they
preferred, according to Churchland. If you
wanted to reach right, these right-reaching
neurons would be very active during the
physical rightward reach.
"Then what does it mean to be getting
ready to move right?" Churchland said.


Robert Putnam
"Maybe the right [reaching neurons]
are a little bit active. Maybe they vote
just a little bit."
This theory relied on a correlation
between neural activity before and
during movement for a group of neu
rons assuming a preferential move
ment.
The study found that a neuron's

"preferred movement" could differ
during preparation and movement.
Neurons could be very active in a
rightward movement but not active
before. Conversely, a neuron could be
very active in the planning and inac
tive in the movement.
The study drew on data the re
searchers collected seven years ago.
Churchland said that at the time, ex
amining the data for neural planning
analysis was confusing.
"It'd be like an astronomer collect
ing data on the position of planets and
stars in the sky before he knew they

were planets," he said. Just as an as
tronomer collecting the data is un
aware of the "underlying pressure"
the planets moving around the sun
so were the researchers unaware
of the mechanisms of neural activity
during planning.
"We try to collect really good rich
data sets such that when our thinking
improves, we have good data sets to
analyze," Kaufman said.
The team originally conducted re
search in this manner, recording the
activity of a monkey's individual cor
tical neurons while preparing to "swat

a fly" in a video game.
When the team returned to the
data sets with some idea of what they
were looking for, the "underlying
pressures" became more apparent.
The paper concluded that while
preparatory and movement activities
are linked, cortical neural activity is
mechanistic rather than representa
tional. This means that the neural ac
tivity in planning works like a pendu
lum schematic as opposed to prefer
ential voting or representation, as
previously believed.
To swing a pendulum rightward,

an initial leftward push is necessary.
Just as the pendulum maintains a con
sistent dynamic movement despite
shifting directions and times, the cor
tical neurons direct a specific move
ment despite the seemingly shifting
neural activity, Churchland said.
"It's hard not to be interested in
the brain when we know so little
about it," Churchland said. "The two
obvious places to start are where in
formation enters the brain through
the visual cortex and where it leaves
the brain in the motor cortex."
"Understanding how the brain

creates movement can allow us to
move one stage earlier," Churchland
added. "How do you decide to
move?"
Churchland explained that re
search in cortical neural planning also
means progress for the field of neural
prosthetics. Neural prosthetics, cur
rently being developed in monkeys,
would be able to link functioning
muscles and a motor cortex, bypass
ing an impaired spinal cord.
