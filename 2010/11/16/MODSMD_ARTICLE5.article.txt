## Study examines neurons and movement Stanford researchers' findings shed light on 'movement planning' 
### ERIN INMAN STAFF WRITER 
"Imagine you're a golfer, set up to tee, get
ting ready to swing," said electrical engineer
ing researcher Mark Churchland. "Some
thing goes on inside your brain. Getting
ready to hit the ball, to be motionless, means

something."
Despite the observed motionless nature
of your body, your brain is full of movement.
Neurons are firing, taking you from a base
line state to a starting state. Now, a Nov. 4
publication by a group of Stanford re
searchers in "Neuron" has explored the activ
ity of cortical neurons responsible for move
ment planning and execution.
Krishna Shenoy, associate professor of en
gineering, was the paper's senior author,
while Churchland was the lead author. A
graduate student, Matthew Kaufman, and

two other researchers, John Cunningham,
and Stephen Ryu, are also authors of the
paper.
The previously held belief postulated that
neurons would "vote" for movements they
preferred, according to Churchland. If you
wanted to reach right, these right-reaching
neurons would be very active during the
physical rightward reach.
"Then what does it mean to be getting
ready to move right?" Churchland said.
