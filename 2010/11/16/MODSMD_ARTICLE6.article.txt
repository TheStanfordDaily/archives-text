## Putnam discusses religion's role in American society 
### MILES UNTERREINER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Harvard Kennedy School professor of public
policy, award-winning academic and prolific au
thor Robert D. Putnam spoke Monday evening in
Hewlett Auditorium to a packed audience of stu
dents and community members looking to hear
about the changing role of religion in American so
ciety.
Putnam, who has also earned the London Sun
day Times' endorsement as "the most influential
academic in the world today," began by pointing to
an apparent paradox in American civic society:
while Americans tend to be both religiously di

verse and religiously devout a combination
that has proven explosive elsewhere in the world
Americans also tend to exhibit high levels of re
ligious tolerance.
"Although the culture wars are very real,
Americans of all stripes are often very open-mind
ed across religious lines," said Putnam. "Places that
are religiously devout, as we are, and religiously di
verse, as we are they tend to be places of may
hem."
Putnam's statistical and social science research
has taken him from evangelical icon Rick War
ren's Saddleback megachurch in Orange County
to "small, fading Episcopal churches in Boston" to
Jewish synagogues in Evanston, 111., to Mormon

wards on the outskirts of Salt Lake City. He pro
ceeded to highlight throughout his lecture a partic
ularly peculiar facet of American exceptionalism.
"Compared to other industrialized nations, the
U.S. has a high rate of weekly church attendance,"
he said.
In fact, measured by attendance at weekly serv
ices, "the average American is more religious than
the average Iranian."
Nonetheless, warned Putnam, "religion, taken
in high doses... can be toxic to democratic unity"
a prospect he went on to demonstrate by chart
ing a wealth of religious data across the decades,
beginning in the 19505.
Weaving together strands of polling data on

subjects from attitudes toward
premarital sex to yearly Bible
sales to individual attitudes to
ward adherents of different

faiths, Putnam told a story of both declining reli
giosity and increasing polarization. He showed
more and more Americans identifying themselves
as members of no religion whom he humorous
ly termed the "nones" and as members of right
wing, passionately evangelical movements.
The result: a historically unprecedented corre
lation between one's politics and one's religion,
which have never before been connected in any
statistically significant manner.
"Historically, there had been pro
gressives in the pews, and a lot of un
churched conservatives," Putnam said.
But "especially after 1990, we saw a
shaip increase in correlation between
your politics and your religion... that,
historically, is not normal."
With increasing numbers of the
highly religious voting Republican and
the avowedly secular voting Democra
tic a statistic that had been reversed
or negligible as recently as 1965 Put
nam cautioned that religion and poli
tics may be intersecting in the U.S.
today to produce a highly polarized
and divisive "God gap" in political alle
giance.
"We're in two camps: the grace
sayers and the non-grace-sayers," he
said.
Despite high levels of religiosity
and political polarization, Americans
tend to have positive views of reli
gious diversity to have many friends
outside of their own faith tradition, to
believe by an overwhelming margin
that people of other faiths than their
own can still go to heaven, and to hold
that "there are basic truths in many re
ligions," rather than that "one religion
is true, and all others are not," he said.
"Americans are pretty open about
other religions," said Putnam, citing sta
tistical evidence suggesting that Jews
and Catholics, almost universally re
viled a century ago by nativist Protes
tant organizations, are now regarded as
the most well-liked faith communities
in America today.
"Putnam's emphasis on religious
tolerance in America as compared to
elsewhere was encouraging and en
lightening," said event attendee Josh
Valdez 'l3. "In demystifying other reli
gions and viewpoints, we begin to em
brace others and their differences."
"I was surprised by the study results
because they were totally contradictory
to what I would have guessed," said Jor
dan LimogesT3."With the prominence
of religion in the media, I would agree
that we are very polarized, but the fact
that we are also veiy tolerant caught me
off guard... I think it presented an op
timistic view of the future."
