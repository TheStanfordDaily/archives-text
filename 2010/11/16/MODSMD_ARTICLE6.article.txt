## Putnam discusses religion's role in American society 
### MILES UNTERREINER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Harvard Kennedy School professor of public
policy, award-winning academic and prolific au
thor Robert D. Putnam spoke Monday evening in
Hewlett Auditorium to a packed audience of stu
dents and community members looking to hear
about the changing role of religion in American so
ciety.
Putnam, who has also earned the London Sun
day Times' endorsement as "the most influential
academic in the world today," began by pointing to
an apparent paradox in American civic society:
while Americans tend to be both religiously di

verse and religiously devout a combination
that has proven explosive elsewhere in the world
Americans also tend to exhibit high levels of re
ligious tolerance.
"Although the culture wars are very real,
Americans of all stripes are often very open-mind
ed across religious lines," said Putnam. "Places that
are religiously devout, as we are, and religiously di
verse, as we are they tend to be places of may
hem."
Putnam's statistical and social science research
has taken him from evangelical icon Rick War
ren's Saddleback megachurch in Orange County
to "small, fading Episcopal churches in Boston" to
Jewish synagogues in Evanston, 111., to Mormon

wards on the outskirts of Salt Lake City. He pro
ceeded to highlight throughout his lecture a partic
ularly peculiar facet of American exceptionalism.
"Compared to other industrialized nations, the
U.S. has a high rate of weekly church attendance,"
he said.
In fact, measured by attendance at weekly serv
ices, "the average American is more religious than
the average Iranian."
Nonetheless, warned Putnam, "religion, taken
in high doses... can be toxic to democratic unity"
a prospect he went on to demonstrate by chart
ing a wealth of religious data across the decades,
beginning in the 19505.
Weaving together strands of polling data on

subjects from attitudes toward
premarital sex to yearly Bible
sales to individual attitudes to
ward adherents of different

faiths, Putnam told a story of both declining reli
giosity and increasing polarization. He showed
more and more Americans identifying themselves
as members of no religion whom he humorous
ly termed the "nones" and as members of right
wing, passionately evangelical movements.
The result: a historically unprecedented corre
lation between one's politics and one's religion,
which have never before been connected in any
