## Group rates diversity in law firms Student group serves as resource for future lawyers

Representation of minorities and
women in law firms decreased nation
wide last year, but members of Build
ing a Better Legal Profession
(BBLP), a student-run campus organ
ization that releases its own reports
on women and minorities in law firms,
says those nation-wide averages are
not the most informative way to learn
about a firm's diversity.
The National Association for Law
Placement (NALP) announced on
Nov. 4 that the proportion of minori
ties in firms decreased to 12.4 percent
from 12.59 percent last year; the pro
portion of women in firms decreased
to 32.69 percent from 32.79 percent
during the same period.
"It doesn't really make sense to
talk about the industry average," said
law professor and BBLP steering
committee member Michele Dauber.
"It's not even a significant drop, in
dustry-wide. The industry has gener
ally been stagnant, and that's bad, be
cause we want to see growth."
According to BBLP data, the ma
jority of law firms actually retained a
proportionate amount of minority
and female associates, but the average
across the profession was skewed by a
small fraction of firms with particular
ly high attrition rates among these de
mographics.
"About half of the firms received
A's in terms of attrition," Dauber said,
adding that an A is given if women or
minorities are retained at equal or
higher rates than men. "But minori
ties and women have lost ground in
key firms that have behaved ap
pallingly badly. These bad actors drive
down the average for everybody
else."
The figures that do indicate low re
tention rates have raised questions as
to whether discrimination plays a role
in legal employment practices.
"The numbers show wide varia
tion in retention rates of women and
minorities," BBLP co-president
Jamillah Bowman said. "In some
firms, it appears that discrimination
does exist, or at least that firms are
being reckless about their employ
ment practices and the types of envi
ronments they are creating."
Dauber said that because all firms
have historically had trouble retain
