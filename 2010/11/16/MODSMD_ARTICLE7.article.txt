## Group rates diversity in law firms Student group serves as resource for future lawyers 
### STEVEN SMALLBERG 
Representation of minorities and
women in law firms decreased nation
wide last year, but members of Build
ing a Better Legal Profession
(BBLP), a student-run campus organ
ization that releases its own reports
on women and minorities in law firms,
says those nation-wide averages are
not the most informative way to learn
about a firm's diversity.
The National Association for Law
Placement (NALP) announced on
Nov. 4 that the proportion of minori
ties in firms decreased to 12.4 percent
from 12.59 percent last year; the pro
portion of women in firms decreased
to 32.69 percent from 32.79 percent
during the same period.
"It doesn't really make sense to
talk about the industry average," said
law professor and BBLP steering
committee member Michele Dauber.
"It's not even a significant drop, in
dustry-wide. The industry has gener
ally been stagnant, and that's bad, be
cause we want to see growth."
According to BBLP data, the ma
jority of law firms actually retained a
proportionate amount of minority
and female associates, but the average
across the profession was skewed by a
small fraction of firms with particular
ly high attrition rates among these de
mographics.
"About half of the firms received
A's in terms of attrition," Dauber said,
adding that an A is given if women or
minorities are retained at equal or
higher rates than men. "But minori
ties and women have lost ground in
key firms that have behaved ap
pallingly badly. These bad actors drive
down the average for everybody
else."
The figures that do indicate low re
tention rates have raised questions as
to whether discrimination plays a role
in legal employment practices.
"The numbers show wide varia
tion in retention rates of women and
minorities," BBLP co-president
Jamillah Bowman said. "In some
firms, it appears that discrimination
does exist, or at least that firms are
being reckless about their employ
ment practices and the types of envi
ronments they are creating."
Dauber said that because all firms
have historically had trouble retain
ing minority and female talent to
begin with, BBLP aggregated the mi
nority groups together, making attri
tion statistics less sensitive to small
changes.
"I think we've been generous to
the firms and given them quite a bit of
leeway," she said. "Most firms did a
pretty good job of keeping women
and minorities, and some firms threw
their minorities under the bus. I don't
think they deserve a break there."
The BBLP leadership hopes its re
ports can effect change throughout
the field.
"I think that certainly the statisti
cal disparities that we've put out show
that there is something here that both
law students and law firms should be
conscious of," said BBLP communi
cations co-director Holly Ragan. "I
would hope that in seeing these num
bers, the companies with the lowest
numbers will look at what they can do
to remedy these problems."
According to its mission state
ment, BBLP exists in part to provide
students entering law school and the

work force with critical information
about the legal workplace.
"The groups that are reporting
these numbers are either for-profit or
receiving funding from for-profit
groups," Dauber said. "BBLP is non
profit, founded and run by Stanford
law students and faculty and receives
no money from law firms. We are in
dependent and free of law firm influ
ence. It's a very Stanford-y thing. We
mash up data, political influence and
technology and have an interdiscipli
nary mix of students working togeth
er for social change."
Bowman said that this informa
tion can help minority students in
light of the recent reports of declin
ing diversity.
"The primary goal of BBLP is to
promote transparency in the legal
profession to help students around
the country to make informed deci
sions, and at least know the proper
questions to ask when they go to in
terview for firms," Bowman said. "In
this case, they can talk to female or
minority associates [of the firms re
porting lower retention rates of mi
norities and women] and ask about
