## DECIPHERING ANT COMMUNICATION Stanford professor Deborah Gordon digs into the complex behaviors that govern ant colonies 
### MOLLY K. VORWERCK 
Deborah M. Gordon, a
professor and research
scientist working in Stan
ford's Department of Bi
ology, is one of those
unique professionals whose work
seems to reflect her own life.
In this case, the efficient bustle of
an ant colony, her specific field of in
terest, mirrors her work, which in
cludes writing two books, conducting
five research projects, raising two chil
dren and fulfilling obligations as a uni
versity professor. Gordon's range of
activity is leagues beyond scoping out
the freshest cake crumbs at a neigh
borhood picnic, like a busy ant might.
Indeed, no sign of hectic disorgan
ization marks her appearance or man
nerisms during an interview with The
Daily. Sitting comfortably in her desk
chair with her arms crossed, Gordon
is the epitome of professionalism.
However, based upon the vast amal
gam of entomology books and papers
strewn across her desk, it is evident
she is hard at work. Although her col
lection of ant-specific literature indi
cates an entrenched passion for the
insect, her personal story provides a
different view.
Gordon said that as a child, she
had no particular interest in ants, or
even insects for that matter. In fact,
she was afraid of cockroaches. Yet she
enjoyed the outdoors and reveled in
any chance she got to visit the wilder
ness, a rarity since she grew up in
Miami Beach,Fla., and was raised in a
very urban environment by parents
who had a limited appreciation for
the natural world.
"My parents thought of nature as
decoration," she said. "But when I was
a child I would go to a wilderness
camp in North Carolina. I thought it
was wonderful to be out in the forest.
But I didn't think of it as something to
be studied. I thought of it as a very be
nign, safe place."
Today, a love of nature may ex
plain her interest in biology, but why
ants?
"My family likes to tell a story that
when I was a baby, my older brother
set me down on a fire-ant mound.
They like to joke that was the begin
ning of my interest in ants," she said,
smiling.
Although she received a bache
lor's degree in French at Oberlin Col
lege, where she was also a student of

music theory, Gorden hat yet to find
her true passion until her senior year
of college, when she took a course in
comparative anatomy.
The course "was a revelation to me
because it allowed me to understand
that there was order and pattern in
nature in the same way there are in
things that people create," she said.
Following this epiphany, Gordon
pursued her master's in developmen
tal biology at Stanford.
"The interesting thing to me was
how we can understand a complex bi
ological system without any central
control," she explained. "An embryo,
like an ant colony, has nothing in
charge. No central authority says to
one cell, 'You go be brain,' and to an
other, 'You go be bone,' and yet some
how, it develops."
"I was looking for a system where I
could think about how the interac
tions among the parts make the whole
thing work, but I wanted to be able to
see everything," she continued. "I ac
tually chose ants [because their]
colonies are complex systems like an
embryo's. So I chose to work on ants
for a very abstract reason."
Gordon came to Stanford in 1991
after doing post-doctoral work at
Harvard, Oxford and The University
of London and earning her doctorate
in zoology at Duke.
The most interesting part of her re
search, she said, is learning about how
an ant colony works.
"No one tells anybody what to do,
there's nobody in charge," Gordon
said. "Ants can only perceive what's
right around them. Most species of
ants can't see, and they all operate
mostly by smell. Each ant uses only
very local information about what to
do. So when you put it all together,
you get the complex behavior of an
ant colony."
Although she loves her research,
as evident in the myriad ant artwork
that lines her walls and covers her
desk, her greatest pride and joy are
her children Sam, 15, and Eleanor, 12.
In fact, Eleanor produced most of
the drawings on her walls. Gordon
pointed to a red stick-figure sketch
her daughter made as a little girl, in
which Gordon is juggling a number of
purple balls. The picture rings true;
with all of her ongoing projects and
commitments, it's a wonder she has
any time at all.
Her students and fellows have
nothing but compliments for Gor

don's guidance and work ethic,
"[Gordon's] clear thinking and ac
curacy in her work are very important
qualities," said Noa Pinter-Wollman,
one of Gordon's post-doctoral fel
lows. "She's an amazing writer ... she
has a very good way of coming up
with experiments, as well as possesses
an ability to hone in on what's impor
tant."
A fifth-year graduate student
working under Gordon studying so
cial insects, Shelby Sturgis said that
the most valuable thing he's learned
from her was how to go about being a
scientist.
"I'm a Ph.D. student, and the first
thing we had to do was come up with
our own experiments," he said. "There
is a lot of trial and error in research,
and Professor Gordon really helps
streamline that process."
Currently, Gordon is working on
three projects, including one she's
been doing since she was in graduate
school. She is tracking the popula
tions of about 300 ant colonies over a
25-year lifespan; studying how native
ant species are resisting the invasive
Argentina ant ("the ant in your bath
room," she said) at Jasper Ridge; and
observing ant-plant mutualism in the
Mexican tropical dry forest. She also
conducts behavior experiments and
does genetic work in the lab and has
written two books, including the wide
ly reviewed "Ants at Work."
Despite her numerous accolades,
Gordon said that the most gratifying
part of her research is when the ants
surprise her. An instance of this is
when she learned that ants use the
rate of interaction to determine their
next actions, since there is no central
control system in their colonies.
"It's like they are sending each
other little Twitter messages that have
no content; they just use the rate at
which they receive them to decide
what to do next," she said. "It's a sys
tem of communication where the in
teraction itself is the whole message.
It's not like 'Antz' or A Bug's Life'
where a foreman simply blows a whis
tle and tells the ants to all go do some
thing. That never happens."
And her advice to aspiring ant bi
ologists?
"Go out and look," she said. "Be
fore you read about ants, go out and
watch some!"
