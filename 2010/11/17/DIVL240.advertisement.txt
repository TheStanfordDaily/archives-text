Stanford Continuing Studies Presents
Speak, Memory
The literature of memory is vast from Homer to Garcia Marquez, from Wordsworth
to Oliver Sacks and spans many genres: memoir, novel, autobiography, history,
poetry, and neuroscience. Much of the writing is lyrical and emotional, but it can
also be funny, speculative, puzzled, and puzzling, because memory remains a massive,
unfathomed, and almost unmapped continent.
This year, in collaboration with the Stanford Institute for Creativity and the Arts,
Continuing Studies offers you three evenings one each quarter of dramatic
readings, modeled on NPR's popular "Selected Shorts," featuring writings on and
about memory. We have borrowed the title of our series from Vladimir Nabokov's
luminous memoir, and have recruited accomplished actress Kay Kostopoulos to
direct the programs.
This Fall's program includes a classic story by Jorge Luis Borges, "Funes the Memorious,"
about a man who could not forget anything; Oliver Sacks' account of the pianist
Clive Wearing, whose amnesia, brought on by a brain infection, prevented him from
remembering anything for more than about four seconds; and an excerpt from Anne
Tyler's gently humorous and deeply compassionate new novel, Noah's Compass.
