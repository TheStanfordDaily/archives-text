## Four LOKO: CHEAP DRINKS UPS & DOWNS 
### BRENNEN CLOUSE 
■ t's been dubbed "blackout in a can" and
"liquid cocaine." It looks just like an ener
gy drink in a red and grey camouflage-de
signed aluminum can, except for an "alco
- holic beverage" label encircling the top.
I The drink is fruit punch-flavored Four Loko, a caffeinat
ed alcoholic drink newly popular at colleges across the
United States. Stanford is no exception to the Four Loko
craze. Kathy Vu '13 said she first heard about the drink from
a friend, though she has yet to try it.
"My friend told me about a new energy drink with alco
hol that she wanted to try," Vu said.
A combination of alcohol and carbonated, fruit-flavored
soda, the drink's flavor is a mixture of juice and cheap beer.
"It reminds [students] of an energy drink, and it's really
cheap, and it has a lot of alcohol," she said.
Four Loko's hype has grown from word-of-mouth mar
keting. But on Monday, the Massachusetts Alcoholic Bever
ages Control Commission filed an emergency regulation to
restrict the sale of caffeinated alcoholic beverages such as
Four Loko, starting Nov. 22. Four states — Washington,
Michigan, Oklahoma and Utah — have already banned the
drinks, and their distributors have agreed to halt shipments
to Connecticut.
In response to threats from regulators, Four Loko maker
Phusion Projects announced yesterday it would no longer
add caffeine to its alcoholic drinks. The Food and Drug Ad
ministration is expected to take action on caffeinated alco
holic drinks as soon as today.
But regardless of the drink's potential dangers, its popu
larity is apparently high — Four Loko has more than
100,000 fans on Facebook.
Students said that Four Loko's risk adds to the students'
fascination with the drink.
"I think it's also a matter of pride and bragging rights,"
said Maren Botz-Zapp '13.
Paul Brownlee '12, who has tried Four Loko, agrees.
"It's unpredictable," he added. "And it's all in one can."
At $3 a can, its low cost relative to its alcohol content is
an added plus for the college crowd.
"We're college students and we don't want to spend that
much money," Botz-Zapp said. "You'll be set for a weekend
... honestly, it's a quick and easy way to get really, really
drunk."
The recent news about the product's dangers and hospi
talizations has spurred some schools to ban the drink. Ralph
Castro, alcohol and drug educator at Vaden Health Center,
told The Daily that Stanford would "look into" the drink if
it became a "problem" on campus, which he said it hasn't so
far.
Stanford students have said they are well aware of the
dangers, even before the drink was banned at Ramapo Col
lege in October. Botz-Zapp said she first saw one of the
brightly colored cans lying around in her freshman dorm
last year.
"I had heard about them and heard rumors about how
horrible they were for you," she said. "I think students are
aware of the dangers of drinking that kind of stuff, but they
also choose to ignore it for their own reasons."
Brownlee thinks students at Stanford are smart about
consuming it.
"At least at Stanford, people know it has more caffeine
than you're probably willing to drink at once," he said.
