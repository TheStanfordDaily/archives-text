## EDITORIAL Court's ruling should not undermine Bayh-Dole Act's purpose 
### 
It should come as no surprise to readers
that Stanford perennially ranks among
the nation's top universities in patent
quality, number of patents and patent rev
enue. Though patent revenue makes up only
about 1.5 percent of Stanford's budget, it
provides a critical incentive to innovate at
both the departmental and individual levels.
Unfortunately, Stanford's Copyright and
Patent Agreement (CPA) has proven itself
incapable of defending the University's intel
lectual property, which has forced a drawn
out legal battle that has now reached the
Supreme Court. The scope of the case has ex
tended far beyond Stanford and will have
significant implications for research universi
ties nationwide.
Involved is the Bayh-Dole Act, which
gives federally funded research universities
the patent rights to inventions made at
those universities. The court case began
when a Stanford researcher in the late 1980s
signed a rights agreement with Stanford,
then with Cetus Corporation, a biotechnol
ogy company later acquired by Roche. In
1991, Cetus was purchased by Roche Mole
cular Systems, which began producing HIV
detection kits incorporating Holodniy's
patented work.
. In 1992, Stanford responded by claiming
that since the research was funded in part by
the National Institutes of Health, it had sole
title to the resulting patents under the Bayh-
Dole Act. The act gives the government the
option to claim title to any invention result

ing from its funding or to allow the funded in
stitution to do the same. The University at
tempted unsuccessfully to agree to licensing
terms with Roche and sued the firm for
patent infringement in 2005.
Recently, a federal appeals court ruled
against Stanford, pointing out that the Uni
versity's CPA is not an assignment of rights
but an "agreement to assign" such rights, and
that Stanford cannot use it to claim title to
the researcher's work. The court also argued
that the Bayh-Dole Act does not automati
cally void his assignment of rights to Cetus,
and therefore Stanford has no right to his
patents.
The editorial board hopes that the
Supreme Court's eventual ruling will not
threaten the current university patent-licens
ing system. According to a brief filed by more
than 40 universities, university licensing
added $457 billion and 279,000 jobs to the
U.S. economy between 1996 and 2007. Neal
Katyal, the U.S. acting solicitor general,
claimed that a district court's ruling in Stan
ford v. Roche created "serious uncertainty"
about university patent titles and threatens
the government's ability to promote the pub
lic interest.
The Bayh-Dole Act was passed to ensure
that government-funded research would
serve the public good. The law has accom
plished this and had the wonderful side effect
of fueling research at universities like Stan
ford. The court's decision in this case must
not undermine the law's noble purpose.
