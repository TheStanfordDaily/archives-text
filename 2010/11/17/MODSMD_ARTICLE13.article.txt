## Open up Your Hate, Stanford, and Let It flow Into Me 
### Peter McDonald 
Alright, fellow students and Stanford
sports fans, it's time to get with the pro
gram. We have the sixth-ranked team
in the country, and I don't see any of you kids
acting like it. Sure, you've been showing up
and cheering loudly at football games, but
that's not what makes Stanford fans respect
ed, that's not what gets us BCS at-large bids
(for serious, guys, the Alamo Bowl sucks). If
you people ever want to become a premiere
college football program and stay that way,
you're gonna have to start trafficking heavily
in the only emotion that anyone in college
football respects: hatred. The clean distilled
kind you find at Oregon, Ohio State and any
where in the SEC.
You may think that you've got nothing to
hate because you're in the best place in the
world or because it's stupid to hate someone
just because you go to a different school.
Wrong on both accounts. Shake off that trepi
dation that makes you say "Stanford" with a
note of shame in it and replace it with all the
privileged entitlement you can muster, be
cause no matter if you're a first-generation
transgender disabled blacktino or if your par
ents have a building named after them, you got
to rep Stanford by treating the rest of the col
lege football world like it just dinged your
yacht and tracked its dirty-ass shoes across
your Oriental rug and onto your Italian leather
sofa before you promptly booted its ass out of
your house. For six days out of the week, please
keep being that awesome, humble, altruistic
person you are. On Saturdays, though, it's time
to dust off that theory of Social Darwinism and
live it to its unabashed fullest because really
now, which other top-25 team has a $l5 billion
endowment, an 8 percent acceptance rate, two
current Supreme Court justices and knows
how to win without making a mockery out of
its admissions department?
Don't listen to any Daily sports columnists
or members of the athletic department who
tell you to treat the other team and its fans
with respect and class. College football is our
nation's weekly outlet for moral depravity.
You hate teams because arbitrary hatred is
fun, and that's also why we publicly celebrate
events that would now be termed grand theft
and probably a Fundamental Standard viola
tion (i.e. stealing the Axe). Anyone that claims
that college athletics is still about sportsman
ship is dumber than the homeless man's no
tion that he doesn't have to work for a living
(See? See how fun this can be?).
Which brings me to this upcoming (Big)
Game. You need to replace that erudite pas
sivity with some Tea Party-level activism, be
cause Kal is not just your typical welfare recip
ient worthy of hatred (that's Washington
State); Kal is the welfare queen with eight kids
by nine different fathers, two Cadillac pay
ments and an unashamed crack problem.
They play in a rat-infested dump-heap until

next season when they're forced into a base
ball stadium. They are the Cub Scouts as a
football team, with a pedophilic bear as a mas
cot and a student-run band that goes out of its
way to reinforce every band geek stereotype
imaginable. Their athletics department is so
horribly mismanaged that they no longer have
a baseball or gymnastics team. They have not
been to the Rose Bowl in over 50 years; their
last attempt was foiled by a Texas PR cam
paign. In fact, the proudest moment in the en
tire history of Kal is a freak play that prevent
ed them from having a losing season. The way
they intimidate is to tell people to "Take off
that reeeeed shirt."Their fans' lives are as mis
erable as any you'll find in the Big Ten but they
still can't sell out their stadium. They got no
spine, no smarts, no teeth and no tradition.
They're not really a football program; they're
a bunch of overgrown high-schoolers that got
uppity while we were busy handling our
Buddy Teevens and Walt Harris issues. God
willing, Andrew Luck, the Great Red Hope,
will quiet the weenies down and remind them
of their place as our future secretaries. I sure
would not like to have to go over there myself
and teach them boys a lesson myself. Things
might get out of hand.
You see that, kids? That's the kind of ha
tred and entitlement you need to bring to Cal
ifornia Memorial Stadium, Oregon State and
all worthy opponents beyond. If you need
help, I suggest a Four Loko and some Pocket
Shots, but take notes because that's the hatred
that brings you Heismans, BCS at-large bids, a
Jim Harbaugh that ain't goin' no-where and a
long-deserved riot on University Avenue, or
as I like to call it, real college football. It's sup
posed to burn your soul just a little bit.

Spread the hate at petermc@stanford.edu. Oh,
and go Card, because Kal sucks.

You hate teams
because arbitrary
hatred is fun.
