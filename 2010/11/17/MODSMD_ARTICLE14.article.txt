# LOOKING UP
## When Going Back Is Best 
### Nina M. Chung 
Why are people so fascinating to
watch? Again, the novelty of lives
around me infringes upon my im
pending deadlines (currently, the one for this
column). So, I keep interrupting myself by
glancing above the computer screen to
sneakily observe everyone. The habits, the
appearances and the parts of a stranger's day
of which we sometimes get a glimpse it's
all a window into a casual unknown world.
It's intriguing because it's so ... unfamiliar.
And, to some degree, it's this fondness for
the unfamiliar that makes me so dedicated to
the search for unvisited places: new restau
rants, new cafes, new places to study on and
off campus. I've spent a lot of my time creat
ing that personal definition of "adventure." It
was exemplified in the quest my darling
roommate from last year and I created to ex
plore the Bay Area in which we dined at 26
new restaurants (at least) whose names start
ed with each subsequent letter of the alpha
bet, A to Z. It was the most delicious urban
exploration project ever. There were so
many are-we-lost/is-that-a-ticket scares, un
expected landmark discoveries and crazy
culinary discoveries (black sesame and taro
gelatol). We'd know the name of our destina
tion, but everything in between was always
beautifully vague. (We didn't have a car, so
transportation logistics were enjoyably
fuzzy, too.) For 26 letters, my dear Ms. Edie
and I, often joined by parties of good friends,
ventured into the geographical unknown. A
lot of unfamiliar became familiar, and then
became favorites.
Lately, though, I've realized an unforeseen
side effect of my love affair with the unfamil

iar: a neglect of what I do know. Somehow, I
have so many favorite places, and many
fewer repeat visits. In economic terms, I gen
erally seem to view going back as the oppor
tunity cost for going somewhere new, and the
opportunity cost always seems relatively
large. Actually, at this very moment, I'm writ
ing at a new cafe marked out for being a local
Mountain View favorite. And, as they say,
their coffee is good (even if it's in the process
of getting cold right now). So, yay! I'm
pleased! and that's the short-term benefit.
The long-term benefit is feeling like I'm
doing my best to get to know a place I likely
won't return to very much when I grow
up/graduate.
But I think my increasingly endless mis
sion to seek out the local unseen is adding
to the exhaustion of this quarter for me. It's
combining with the sense that my course
load is slowly and almost unnoticeably
lowering my average energy levels. And I
feel like I've done so much growing this
quarter, which hasn't even hit a full three
months yet. After the events of my past
summer, I'm wondering if maybe I've just
developed a personality that sees every
thing as a major new revelation. (That's
probably it, although I guess I've always
known I was optimistic and dramatic.) But
now I feel a bit. . . tired. I'm a bit tired by
all the surprises, even though I've gained
from them all.
I can't deny my attraction to novelty. But
maybe I'm exaggerating it a bit. Maybe I'm
over-exaggerating my need for it. I think my
subconscious response to that is, conversely,
getting super excited about returning to

some highly familiar faces and habits back
home. I'm definitely lucky in the fact that all
the "homes" around which my life centers
are places I've always loved going back to.
But I've never felt more ready than I do now
to head back to my tiny, reliably unchanging
little beach town. Of course, it's not the loca
tion that matters; fundamentally, I'm looking
forward to reuniting with a few certain things
and people I know very well.
Most likely, my impulse for over-action has
been in overdrive. This morning, at breakfast,
several friends from my dorm and I were
talking about how realistic it was to just sit
and not overthink and be in the moment. I
think it's difficult and totally possible. I think
it has a lot to do with being content with what
we already know and are lucky to have.
Adventuring out to the new and unfamil
iar will always be a passion of mine. But I
might be making myself more tired by con
stantly looking around for everything I
haven't seen yet. There are so many things in
my life I'm crazy about, so maybe it's a bit
crazy I keep struggling to find more. I've de
cided to attempt some stillness, remember
what I love and have a little rendezvous with
those. After all, I already searched and found
them. Now doesn't it seem so fabulously sim
ple!
