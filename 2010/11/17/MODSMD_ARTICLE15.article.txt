## WHERE DID ALL THE FANS GO? 
### BRENDAN O'BYRNE 
Despite the many successes of Stan
ford's football team this year, one
glaring bruise on the reputation of
the program has been its low atten
dance levels, evident in the consis
tently far-from-full Stanford Stadium. Though
lost revenue is one concern, Stanford's inability to
fill the stands is a problem that matters to more
than just the ticket office.
Operating under current Bowl Champi
onship Series (BCS) procedures, a team's record
and performance on the field are the most impor
tant factors that determine which bowl a team
will end up in. However, other factors, like a
team's ability to sell tickets, do matter as well.
Bowl organizers not only want a great football
game, they want a packed stadium. Stanford's no
torious lack of attendance at home games this
year, despite fielding a top-10 team, could have
negative consequences on its bowl hopes.
Despite what some consider lackluster atten
dance, Stanford football ticket sales are up signif
icantly from 2008, when the Cardinal had a simi
lar home schedule to this year's, facing Arizona,
USC and Washington State. Compared to 2008,
the Stanford Ticket Office sold more than 10,000
additional tickets per game for the Arizona and

Washington State games this season and also
beat its USC tally by over 1,000.
However, some in the sports media have said
that these improvements are not enough. On
ESPN and Mercury News sports blogs, writers
have noted the lack of attendance at recent
games, especially the high-stakes game against
then-No. 15 Arizona. Noticing the thousands of
empty seats, ESPN blogger Ted Miller asked,
"What's a team got to do to get some love from
the locals?"
If anyone has the answer to that question, it's
Rich Muschell, the assistant athletic director and
director of ticket sales for Stanford. While he ac
knowledged that the students are doing a great
job supporting Cardinal football and that the
Red Zone has been full for every home game
since school started, it's all the other seats in the
stadium that Stanford is struggling to fill.

"Where we are really trying to make a differ
ence is reaching out to the broader Bay Area
market," Muschell said when asked about specif
ic steps his office is taking to boost sales. "God
love the Stanford alums who buy season tickets,
but there just aren't enough of them in the area.
We are trying to reach out to the general football
fan."
Muschell also described other steps that the
athletic department has taken to increase sup
port and attendance, such as offering special dis
counts and deals and advertising in multiple
Costcos in the Palo Alto area, in hopes of attract
ing more local residents to games.
"We have a great facility, and we keep our
ticket prices competitive," he said. "The level of
attendance has been growing over the last couple
years, so it's a work in progress."
Some have noted that the officially reported

ticket sales and actual attendance vary widely.
The Washington State game had a reported at
tendance of 36,679, but it was clear that there
were far fewer people actually in the stadium.
Muschell noted that this discrepancy is consis
tent with general ticketing principles, not Stan
ford being deceptive or inaccurate.
"We report total tickets sold,not official atten
dance numbers," Muschell said. "And we report
those numbers directly to finance, so we don't
mess with them at all."
Another problem that may contribute to the
empty seats is this year's schedule. Stanford alter
nates home and away games with its Pac-10 op
ponents each year (though this practice will
change next season with the new Pac-12 arrange
ments), and this season is what Muschell de-

Though the Red Zone student section usually at least comes close to capacity, Stanford Stadium has had empty seats at almost every home
game this season. The only sellout thus far, an Oct. 9 game against USC, was full partially due to a large number of traveling Trojan fans.
scribes as a "lean year." While USC
consistently draws a crowd, partly be
cause its fans travel in such large num
bers, Washington State and Oregon
State tend to be less popular matchups.
Whatever the cause of the atten
dance woes, the unfortunate fact is that
Stanford is doing exceptionally poorly
when compared to other teams around
the country, particularly other top-10
programs.
Official NCAA statistics from 2009
for home game attendance give Stan
ford an average of 82.8 percent capac
ity, well below a number of other
major-conference programs. Califor
nia had similar numbers at an 82.6 per
cent average, and Oregon filled its sta
dium to 108 percent of capacity at an
average game. The other four teams
currently above Stanford in the BCS
standings also outpaced the Cardinal
in attendance: LSU and Boise State
each sold out their stadiums for every
game, and Auburn wasn't far behind
with average attendance of 96.8 per
cent. TCU is relatively lower, only fill
ing its stadium to 86.7 percent capacity
at an average game.
With only one more home game this
season, a Nov. 27 matchup against Ore
gon State at the tail end of Thanksgiving
break, the attendance rankings are like
ly to remain lower than most other
BCS-ranked teams.
Muschell admitted that the holiday
will make attendance for the game un
predictable.
"Your guess is as good as mine," he
said.
