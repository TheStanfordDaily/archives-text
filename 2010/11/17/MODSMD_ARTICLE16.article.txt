# Stanford nearing 100th championship
## 
### Jacob Jaffe Fields of Failure 
It's Big Game week, and for a few days,
everyone and their IHUM TF is sud
denly a football fan. Rose Bowl scenar
ios and Cal's home/road splits are
bandied about like they're SAT scores.
Stuffed bear limbs are strewn about White
Plaza, the Big Everything is pitting every pos
sible student group from Cal and Stanford
against each other and the colors blue and
gold are such a Taboo on campus that the Ax
eComm might very well set up its own team of
Snatchers to apprehend the traitors.
With such football fervor on campus, it's
easy to overlook the rest of the sports world. I,
as well as many other Daily columnists, am
somewhat guilty of this football-centric atti
tude. And while football is certainly worthy of
our attention, sports fans everywhere would
be missing some amazing sporting achieve
ments if they focused only on Big Game.
Considering Stanford football is currently
ranked No. 6 in the country, it would be easy to
believe that no other sport on campus could
compare to its success. Oddly enough, though,
five of the seven other fall sports teams on
campus are ranked even higher. Men's cross
country, women's cross country, women's soc
cer, women's volleyball and men's water polo
find themselves in the top four nationally in
their respective sports, and all have the chance
to bring home a national title this season.
A national championship in a Division-I
sport is a truly remarkable achievement, but
the next Cardinal team to bring home the
crown will have added significance.

Stanford presently owns 99 NCAA
team championships, so the 100 th could
be just around the corner. Only UCLA
has eclipsed the 100 NCAA team titles
mark, but at 106, the Bruins are very
much in reach.
For a school that prides itself so
much on having success across all sports,
winning 100 titles would be enormously
meaningful. Stanford already has the
most women's team titles in the country
with 39, and it has a huge lead in individ
ual titles with 421 (only USC comes
within 100 of that number). The Direc
tors' Cup could basically be named the
Stanford Cup after the Cardinal
brought it home each of the last 16 years.
The NCAA and ESPN even created a
new award, the Capital One Cup, which
is specifically geared toward stopping
Stanford from winning every year.
The 100 th title is one of the few ac
complishments that has eluded the

Cardinal to this point, but it doesn't fig
ure to last too much longer.
First crack at No. 100 comes in less
than a week, and it'll be a double wham
my. Both cross country teams will be
competing at the NCAA Champi
onships in Terre Haute, Ind., this Mon
day. Both come in with impressive re
sumes and Pac-10 titles under their belts.
The men feature the outstanding
trio of Elliott Heath, Jake Riley and
Chris Derrick, who swept the top three
spots at Pac-lOs. Coming off last year's
disappointing finish at nationals as the
No. 1 team, the red-hot Card comes into
this year's race ranked No. 2 but with
every shot at bringing home the cham
pionship.
The women have exceeded expec
tations this season, rising all the way to
No. 4 nationally and winning a very
tough Pac-10. They made nationals as
an at-large team after placing third in
the West Regional, but they will certain
ly be in contention next week, led by
Kathy Kroeger, who has been the Car
dinal's top finisher in every race this
season.
Women's soccer, women's volley

ball and men's water polo will all have
chances to win titles in December, but I,
for one, have no intentions of waiting
until then to celebrate No. 100.
We'll all be watching this Saturday
when Stanford and Cal battle in Memo
rial Stadium. And if the Cardinal brings
the Axe back to its rightful home, we'll
all be celebrating through the weekend.
But do yourself a favor and wake up
Monday morning and watch the races
on NCAA.com. Whatever you may
think you know about cross country,
you don't know. There's nothing like
watching a race unfold as the Cardinal
runs for a title, and this time it'll be even
more special.
Cheer on Stanford this weekend,
from football in the Big Game to cross
country in nationals, and everything in
between. We just might bring more
than an Axe back to Stanford's trophy
case.
