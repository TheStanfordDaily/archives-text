# Stanford nearing 100th championship
## 
### Jacob Jaffe Fields of Failure 
It's Big Game week, and for a few days,
everyone and their IHUM TF is sud
denly a football fan. Rose Bowl scenar
ios and Cal's home/road splits are
bandied about like they're SAT scores.
Stuffed bear limbs are strewn about White
Plaza, the Big Everything is pitting every pos
sible student group from Cal and Stanford
against each other and the colors blue and
gold are such a Taboo on campus that the Ax
eComm might very well set up its own team of
Snatchers to apprehend the traitors.
With such football fervor on campus, it's
easy to overlook the rest of the sports world. I,
as well as many other Daily columnists, am
somewhat guilty of this football-centric atti
tude. And while football is certainly worthy of
our attention, sports fans everywhere would
be missing some amazing sporting achieve
ments if they focused only on Big Game.
Considering Stanford football is currently
ranked No. 6 in the country, it would be easy to
believe that no other sport on campus could
compare to its success. Oddly enough, though,
five of the seven other fall sports teams on
campus are ranked even higher. Men's cross
country, women's cross country, women's soc
cer, women's volleyball and men's water polo
find themselves in the top four nationally in
their respective sports, and all have the chance
to bring home a national title this season.
A national championship in a Division-I
sport is a truly remarkable achievement, but
the next Cardinal team to bring home the
crown will have added significance.
