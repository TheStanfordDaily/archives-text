# Blood donations up
## 266 units of blood collected from Tuesdays blood drive 
### DANA EDWARDS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The ArriUaga Center basketball courts were transformed
yesterday into the site of one of the Bay Area's largest blood
drives
For the last three years, Stanford and Cal have taken part
in "Rivals for Life," a contest to see which school can collect
the most units of blood over the course of a day. Held during
Big Game Week, the competition capitalizes on intensified
school spirit as Stanford unites to beat Cal in the Saturday
football game.
"Not only can you help save a life today, but you can help
us beat Cal," Stanford Blood Center account manager Elisa
Manzanares said in an appeal to potential donors.
Cal won the first "Rivals" blood drive in 2007, but Stan
ford has prevailed in the last two years. Last year, Stanford
won by a close margin of 260 to Cal's 251 units of blood.
Manzanares said Tuesday's turnout was good, with
roughly 266 units collected. The results, however, remain un
official until the blood is processed in a lab to determine the
exact volume of usable specimens.
Over the past few weeks, Manzanares sent out e-mails to
all the resident assistants (RAs) on campus, who in turn en
couraged their respective dorms to donate by writing on
whiteboards, engaging students in conversation or making
announcements during dorm meetings.
"It's because of the RAs that I think we win,'' Manzanares

said. She added that among students, the freshman class has
participated most widely in all the blood drives to date, while
seniors and graduate students have had the weakest
turnouts. University staff members, however, have come out
in the greatest numbers of all.
"Our staff and faculty contribute about 40 percent of the
units collected," Manzanares said.
Stanford has been able to win the competition the last two
years despite the fact that its population is less than half of
Cal's. Eric Stein, senior associate athletic director for recre
ation and wellness, attributes this success to Stanford's efforts
at publicizing and collaborating on the event.
"It's exciting that we have a team effort where we're
working with students, faculty and staff to try to create the
biggest blood drive in the entire Bay Area," Stein said. "It's
been a great process. We've opened up the Rec Center. While
it used to be done on smaller venues on campus, today to see
two courts and every single station being utilized is fantastic.''
At the event, in the middle of the courts, about a dozen
nurses in white lab coats hovered over several rows of donors
in reclining chairs.
According to Manzanares, blood donations are necessary
for patients who can require many units at a time, depending
on the severity of their conditions. A cancer patient needs
one or two units per week (a unit is equivalent to one pint of
blood, the amount supplied by a regular donor), while an au-

tomobile accident victim can require up
to 50 units at one time.
The Stanford Blood Center is a non
profit that collects several hundred units
a day roughly as much as "Rivals for
Life" yields at its center and in its mo
bile "Bloodmobiles" deployed through
out the Bay Area. The center is unique
because in addition to supplying blood
to hospitals for use in transfusions, it also
provides platelets to local companies
who conduct cutting-edge research to
develop new life-saving therapies and
treatments, Manzanares said.
Despite the success of the blood

drive and the efforts of the Stanford
Blood Center in general, there is still an
overall shortage of platelets locally and
nationwide.
"Only two to three percent of the
population in the Bay Area donate,"
Manzanares said. "It's not that they
don't care, but that the society is too fast
paced."
She'd like to see more people show
ing up and, just as importantly, donors
coming in for repeat visits. "If all donors
donated twice a year, we wouldn't have
nearly as much of a shortage," Man
zanares added.
This Thursday Cal hosts its blood
drive, after which a winner will be de
clared all in time for the Big Game.
