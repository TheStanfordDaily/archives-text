## New fed grant revives pre-med program Pre-med program restarts after three years on hiatus 
### KATHERINE NABEL 
In 2007, the Stanford University School of
Medicine shut down its Health Careers Oppor
tunity Program (HCOP), a six-week residential
summer program, due to a lack of federal fund
ing. However, with a new three-year, $3 million
grant from the U.S. Department of Health and
Human Services, the program is now back up
and running.
By creating partnerships with local commu
nity colleges, California State Universities and
the University of California, HCOP Director
Dr. Ronald Garcia focused his last three years
on renewing federal support for the program
and reaching out to students from varying aca
demic backgrounds. His goal is to encourage as
many students as possible to pursue careers in
medical, dental, physician assistant and public
health studies.
"For Stanford, the summer HCOP is the
jewel in the crown of the program," Garcia said.
"The summer HCOP demystifies the medical
school admission process and provides a chal
lenging educational and social community. Stu
dents leave the program with confidence and
direction."
According to Medical School spokeswoman
Sarah Ipaktchian, HCOP "provides students
with premedical advising, mentorship from

Stanford medical school faculty and staff and
instruction in health research, anatomy, cell
biology, minority health issues and demo
graphic healthcare disparities."
To fill its program, HCOP targets stu
dents who have struggled with economic or
educational barriers on their path to aca
demic success. Many of the students who ma
triculate in the program are the first in their
families to attend college, come from under
resourced school systems, know English as a
second language or are low-income, in addi
tion to other barriers to success. Garcia said
the experience is particularly helpful for
community college students who have limit
ed access to advising on the medical school
admissions process.
Juan Miguel Sandoval, a graduate of the

program, is currently a second-year medical
student at Stanford's School of Medicine and
said HCOP changed his life. The program,
Sandoval said, provided him with "guidance,
mentorship and knowledge about how to
navigate the system."
"The program literally took the blindfold
off and empowered me with a plate full of in
valuable experiences and resources that
changed the course of my college career,"
Sandoval said.
Through the program, Sandoval was able
to participate in workshops on the Medical
College Admissions Test (MCAT), personal
statement and American Medical College
Application Service (AMCAS). He was able
to take medical school-level courses in
anatomy and cell biology and shadow Stan
ford's top physicians in the specialty of his
choice.
Sandoval regards HCOP as "the spring
board that launched [his] research career."
Because of his introduction to research
through the program, Sandoval was able to

pursue projects on developing malaria para
sites at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg
School of Public Health and studying viral
entry mechanisms of the hepatitis C virus
and the Kaposi's sarcoma virus at the Na
tional Institutes of Health. Sandoval is also
the first in his family to graduate from col
lege.
"My participation in the program was a
true eye-opening experience and without
the training, activities and knowledge I
gained through many aspects of the pro
gram, I am not sure if I would have taken
my career through the path I have," said
Sandoval. "I believe that HCOP was the
key element in my success as an undergrad
uate and in my matriculation into medical
school."
Applications for Stanford's Health Ca
reers Opportunity Program are now avail
able online for summer 2011.
