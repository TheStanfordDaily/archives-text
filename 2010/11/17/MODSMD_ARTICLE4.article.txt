## Admins consider axing in-house draw 
### MARGARET RAWSON DESK EDITOR 
The ASSU Undergraduate Senate dis
cussed proposed changes to the residential
draw system Tuesday after hearing a presen
tation from Rodger Whitney, Sue Nunan,
Melissa Mocker and Linda Dorset of Resi
dential and Dining Enterprises (R&DE).
"Our feedback overall has been very pos
itive about the changes to the draw in the
past couple years," said Whitney, executive

director of Student Housing, before outlin
ing two proposed plans to further streamline
the process.
The first proposal would combine resi
dence selection and room selection. Draw
groups would be given a "gate time," in order
of draw number, to go online and look at
available rooms across residences to make
their selection. This option would eliminate
the current in-house draw.
The second proposal, largely favored by
senators, would keep residence selection the

same, while in-house draw and room selec
tion would be automated using online gate
times, with an in-person meeting optional
for residents.
"The majority of complaints we've gotten
over the past few years have been about the
in-house draw process," Nunan said, refer
ring to issues of organization and efficiency.
Whitney acknowledged several practical
issues with the first proposal, such as the
stress of coordinating with other students to
choose rooms within the allotted 15-minute

gate time and expressed his fear of "making
the 'drawma' of spring even worse than it is
now."
Senator Pat Bruny 'l3 weighed in, sug
gesting to "keep the system but work on the
in-house draw."
Elections Commissioner Stephen
Trusheim 'l3, a staff member in Roble, de
scribed the merits of the current in-house
draw system, if run well by dorm staff, to
allow residents to meet one another and
gather more information before choosing
their rooms.
The Senate also discussed whether draw
groups should be limited to six people, rather
than the current maximum of eight, and the
process of house pre-assignment.
Whitney said typically only 7 percent of
draw groups exceed six people, while around
20 percent of students choose to draw indi
vidually.
The Senate passed two bills Tuesday con
cerning meeting attendance. The first aimed
to better mandate full attendance by senators
at entire body meetings by formalizing a roll
call method to document tardiness and early
departures. The second allowed flexibility of
committee meeting attendance, permitting
committee chairs to request the presence of
the Senate chair or deputy chair or appoint a
committee member to serve in their absence.
On Tuesday, the Senate confirmed the

freshmen Senate associates and the Nomina
tions Commission's third round of ap
pointees to University committees.
The senators also discussed and made
slight alterations to Big Game Week spend
ing from the Senate traditions fund. The Sen
ate allocated $1,200 for an additional bus to
Berkeley, $650 for T-shirts and other give

aways at an on-campus viewing party and
$450 for other viewing party expenses, includ
ing food. An extra $450, and any funds not
spent, will funnel back to the general discre
tionary fund.
Advocacy Committee co-chairs Robin
Perani 'l3 and Kamil Saeid 'l3 presented
Tuesday a budget for Camp Anytown, a com
munity-building retreat for freshmen in Jan
uary. The weekend-long retreat this year will
aim to create a diversity council, which would
fundraise for a fall retreat in future years. The
Senate allocated a maximum of $2,000 from
general discretionary funds and Senate ad
vertising funds to the retreat.
Rebecca Sachs 'l3, Senate parliamentari
an, reminded the Senate Tuesday of its re
sponsibility to use the Senate internal and
public e-mail lists appropriately and to not
post formal business on the internal list. The
senators discussed the current policy and ex
pressed a desire to be more careful in the fu
ture, though many expressed that only minor,
accidental mistakes had occurred.
The Senate approved all funding bills of
the evening.
