## Admins consider axing in-house draw 
### MARGARET RAWSON DESK EDITOR 
The ASSU Undergraduate Senate dis
cussed proposed changes to the residential
draw system Tuesday after hearing a presen
tation from Rodger Whitney, Sue Nunan,
Melissa Mocker and Linda Dorset of Resi
dential and Dining Enterprises (R&DE).
"Our feedback overall has been very pos
itive about the changes to the draw in the
past couple years," said Whitney, executive

director of Student Housing, before outlin
ing two proposed plans to further streamline
the process.
The first proposal would combine resi
dence selection and room selection. Draw
groups would be given a "gate time," in order
of draw number, to go online and look at
available rooms across residences to make
their selection. This option would eliminate
the current in-house draw.
The second proposal, largely favored by
senators, would keep residence selection the

same, while in-house draw and room selec
tion would be automated using online gate
times, with an in-person meeting optional
for residents.
"The majority of complaints we've gotten
over the past few years have been about the
in-house draw process," Nunan said, refer
ring to issues of organization and efficiency.
Whitney acknowledged several practical
issues with the first proposal, such as the
stress of coordinating with other students to
choose rooms within the allotted 15-minute

gate time and expressed his fear of "making
the 'drawma' of spring even worse than it is
now."
Senator Pat Bruny 'l3 weighed in, sug
gesting to "keep the system but work on the
in-house draw."
Elections Commissioner Stephen
Trusheim 'l3, a staff member in Roble, de
scribed the merits of the current in-house
