## Lecture series discusses technical side of oil spill 
### KURT CHIRBAS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Shortly after the Deepwater Horizon oil
rig exploded in the Gulf of Mexico on April
20, Roland Home, a professor in the Depart
ment of Energy Resources Engineering,
started hearing his phone ring more often.
"As a petroleum engineer at Stanford, as
soon as the event happened, I started getting
calls from newspapers who wanted to know
what it meant and what I thought about it,"
Home said. "I was kind of obliged to figure
out exactly what had happened, so I could re
spond intelligently to people who asked."
That research was put on public display
Tuesday evening when Home spoke in
Hewlett Auditorium as the first lecturer in a
two-part series entitled, "The Deepwater
Horizon Disaster and the Future of Oil
Drilling in the Gulf of Mexico." The series
aims to answer three fundamental questions
about the catastrophe: how did it happen, why
are we drilling in the Gulf of Mexico at all and
what are some of the long-term consequences
of the spill?

Tuesday's talk focused on tackling the first
of these.
Pamela Matson, dean of the School of
Earth Sciences and the driving force behind
the lecture series, started off the night by pro
viding an overview of the catastrophe.
Eleven workers were killed in the explo
sion. An estimated 185 million gallons of
crude oil were spilled into the Gulf of Mexico
when the well was capped almost two months
later, but it took another two months for the
federal government to declare the well effec
tively dead on Sept. 19.
Home structured his lecture in four parts.
He talked about the technology behind deep
water oil drilling, described some of the ques
tionable issues surrounding this practice, list
ed the principal events that caused the gulf
spill to happen and stated some of the meas
ures being taken to prevent a similar spill
from happening in the future.
He said that the goal of the talk was not to
fault any one party for the spill but instead to
discuss the technical issues that caused it to
happen in the first place.
When Home used a slide from a
presentation by Halliburton, an oil field
corporation, he said that he changed
the wording slightly because it was ac
cusing someone else for being respon
sible.
"I took the name of who they were
accusing out," Home said. "We are in
terested only in the technical issues
here. I'm not intending to talk about
who is [to] blame for anything tonight,
so you can make your own decisions
about that."
Home said that one-eighth of the oil
used by Americans comes from deep
water drilling in the Gulf of Mexico,
making it difficult to cut out on deep
water drilling completely. He also said
that in the last ten years, there have
been almost 2,000 deepwater wells
drilled in the Gulf of Mexico. One has
led to a catastrophe.
"You'll notice I didn't say only one,"
Home said, "because I don't want to
imply that one is a small number... it
should be none out of 2,000. What we
need to leam from this accident is how
to prevent this from ever happening
again."
Anthea Doridis, a resident of Palo
Alto, came to the presentation to get a
better understanding of the oil spill.
"It's one of the biggest oil spills in
American history, so I wanted to under
stand why it happened," Doridis said.
Alfred Sporrman, a professor
chemical engineering and environmen

tal engineering, said he was impressed
that Home gave an objective overview
of the catastrophe.
"It was really good to see an expert
opinion who puts all of these different
facts together, which you don't see in
newspapers," Spormann said.
The second part of the series will
take place on Nov. 30 at 7:30 p.m. in
Hewlett Auditorium with Mark
Zoback, professor in the Department
of Geophysics, speaking about the role
of oil production in the Gulf of Mexico,
and Meg Caldwell, co-director of the
Center for Ocean Solutions and faculty
member at the Law School, talking
about the impact of the spill and regula
tory reform.
