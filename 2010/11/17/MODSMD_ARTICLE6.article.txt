## Lecture series discusses technical side of oil spill 
### KURT CHIRBAS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Shortly after the Deepwater Horizon oil
rig exploded in the Gulf of Mexico on April
20, Roland Home, a professor in the Depart
ment of Energy Resources Engineering,
started hearing his phone ring more often.
"As a petroleum engineer at Stanford, as
soon as the event happened, I started getting
calls from newspapers who wanted to know
what it meant and what I thought about it,"
Home said. "I was kind of obliged to figure
out exactly what had happened, so I could re
spond intelligently to people who asked."
That research was put on public display
Tuesday evening when Home spoke in
Hewlett Auditorium as the first lecturer in a
two-part series entitled, "The Deepwater
Horizon Disaster and the Future of Oil
Drilling in the Gulf of Mexico." The series
aims to answer three fundamental questions
about the catastrophe: how did it happen, why
are we drilling in the Gulf of Mexico at all and
what are some of the long-term consequences
of the spill?

Tuesday's talk focused on tackling the first
of these.
Pamela Matson, dean of the School of
Earth Sciences and the driving force behind
the lecture series, started off the night by pro
viding an overview of the catastrophe.
Eleven workers were killed in the explo
sion. An estimated 185 million gallons of
crude oil were spilled into the Gulf of Mexico
when the well was capped almost two months
later, but it took another two months for the
federal government to declare the well effec
tively dead on Sept. 19.
Home structured his lecture in four parts.
He talked about the technology behind deep
water oil drilling, described some of the ques
tionable issues surrounding this practice, list
ed the principal events that caused the gulf
spill to happen and stated some of the meas
ures being taken to prevent a similar spill
from happening in the future.
He said that the goal of the talk was not to
fault any one party for the spill but instead to
discuss the technical issues that caused it to
