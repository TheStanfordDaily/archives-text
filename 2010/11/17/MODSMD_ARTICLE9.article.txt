# CULTIVATING 'COMUNIDAD'
## Latino groups push discrimination awareness, community collaboration 
### EDITH PRECIADO 
f w f I had come to this country and come straight
I to Stanford I would have felt a lot more wel-
I come, but I went to the real world," saidTadeo
I Melean '13. "That included a lot of discrimina
-A^tion."
Melean, whose family emigrated from Bolivia to Mis
souri in 2001, said the discrimination his family faced once
arriving in the United States went "from subtleties ... to
people actually yelling at me to go back home or telling me
to recite the Pledge of Allegiance."
But the brunt of unpleasant experiences, he said, was

borne by his mother because of her thick accent. "She often
gets weird looks, or they'll ask questions that are not direct
ly addressing her legal status, but they'll obviously be re
garding that," Melean said. "Or we'll be speaking Spanish
at a grocery store and people will... tell us to learn Eng
lish. The nativist feeling in this country is still very much
alive,"
Melean said Stanford generally seems to be a "safer en
vironment," where discrimination against Latinos is less
obvious, but isn't precluded.
Today, Melean is just one member of Stanford's diverse
Latino community, which blends a social atmosphere with
activism on campus to create a forum where members can
explore their shared history, argue for political points im
portant to them and build connections to other groups at
the University.
Activism and the National Stage
"Coming to Stanford, you assume that people are open
minded and see the world in a different way, but when
they're like 'Oh, you're making a big
deal because you're Latina,' ... that's
the scarier part," said MEChA com
munity liaison Alexandra Salgado
'll.
"We often feel that because we're
educated, because we're in California
and because we're all kind of liberal,
that [discrimination] doesn't happen
here, but I think it happens more
often than we realize," Stacy Villalo
bos'll added.
So how is discrimination reflected
in Stanford's Latino community?
Students interviewed for this arti
cle said they believed discrimination
has recently increased at the national
level.
Villalobos said using the term "il
legal immigrant" in legislation, such
as Arizona's recent immigration law,
is a cover for racial animus.
MEChA co-chair Aracely Mon
dragon 'l3 added that in San Diego,
her hometown, efforts to prevent en
trance into the U.S. are apparent.
"You see a lot of [U.S. Immigration
and Customs Enforcement] check
points ... set up randomly on streets,
[to] stop cars, ask for drivers' licenses,
check paperwork," Mondragon said.
Last year, numerous Latino stu
dent groups at Stanford simulated a
border checkpoint, stopping anyone
wearing red to protest Arizona's im
migration legislation.
"We tabled for the DREAM Act at
the beginning of the year, when it
came up to vote —we put tables
around campus so that people could
call their senators and ask them for
support," Mondragon said.
But while students emphasized
the success of that and similar events,
they said the way they are set up
could affect the events' effectiveness.
"It all depends on how actions are
organized," Salgado said. "Some peo
ple would take [pamphlets] and read
them, but most... would be like,
"Move! You're in my way! I'm gonna
crash into you! "You wonder ... '[are
we] raising awareness or annoying
people?"'

The Latino 'Comunidad'

The existence of groups that ap
peal to Latinos bolsters intra-com
munity and multicultural under
standing, Salgado said.
Some students interviewed for this
article said they didn't expect to
spend a lot of time with Latino groups
during their undergraduate years, but
they all found a wealth of outlets that

allowed them to explore their roots
and issues significant to Latinos.
Ballet Folklorico co-chair Bianca
Alvarez 'll said that because she
came from a predominantly white
high school, she had always felt differ
ent. But at Stanford, she found a wel
coming "comunidad," as students in
volved in El Centra Chicano some
times refer to themselves.
"When I don't have a place to go, I
come to Centra, I hang out with a lot
of Ballet people," she said.
Aside from providing a forum
where Latino students can discuss
their ethnic roots, these groups also
introduce students to political issues
they might not have otherwise known
about. These interactions often arise
from collaboration between MEChA
and organizations like Stanford Stu
dents for Queer Liberation and the
Pilipino American Student Union.
"I can't imagine campus without
MEChA or the Black Student Union
," Salgado said. "We make people
know that when something is bad for
our community ... we act upon it and
we're not complacent."
Latino groups on campus said
they also try to address the misper
ception that Latino groups restrict
their membership to those within the
Hispanic community.
"What's unfortunate is that some
think that if you're not Latino, you
can't join," Mondragon remarked.

"We encourage non-Latinos to join,
especially if you want to learn more
about the community."
Even for ethnic-themed resi
dences like Casa Zapata, some peo
ple misperceive what it takes to be an
"adequate" member.
"My freshman year, one of my
good friends actually said at one
point,'l don't want to go into Zapata!
I'm not Mexican enough!'" Alvarez
said. "My sorority [emphasizes] the
fact that we're Latina-interest, but
not Latina-exclusive."
Alvarez also said that El Centro
Chicano, which attracts a predomi
nantly Mexican group, is making an
effort to appeal to the greater Stan
ford community by purchasing flags
and food from all of Latin America.
Although students said there is
work to be done promoting discrimi
nation awareness on campus, they
note that collaboration among stu
dents groups is a step in the right di
rection. Similarly, they add that more,
different Latino nationalities within
the "comunidad" and the few non-
Latino members are assets to the
community.
"One of the co-chairs [of Ballet]
this year ... he's from Germany," said
Alvarez. "He stayed because of the
dynamics of the group."

different Latino nationalities within
the "comunidad" and the few non-
Latino members are assets to the
community.
"One of the co-chairs [of Ballet]
this year ... he's from Germany," said
Alvarez. "He stayed because of the
dynamics of the group."

f w f I had come to this country and come straight
I to Stanford I would have felt a lot more wel-
I come, but I went to the real world," saidTadeo
I Melean '13. "That included a lot of discrimina
-A^tion."
Melean, whose family emigrated from Bolivia to Mis
souri in 2001, said the discrimination his family faced once
arriving in the United States went "from subtleties ... to
people actually yelling at me to go back home or telling me
to recite the Pledge of Allegiance."
But the brunt of unpleasant experiences, he said, was

borne by his mother because of her thick accent. "She often
gets weird looks, or they'll ask questions that are not direct
ly addressing her legal status, but they'll obviously be re
garding that," Melean said. "Or we'll be speaking Spanish
at a grocery store and people will... tell us to learn Eng
lish. The nativist feeling in this country is still very much
alive,"
Melean said Stanford generally seems to be a "safer en
vironment," where discrimination against Latinos is less
obvious, but isn't precluded.
Today, Melean is just one member of Stanford's diverse
Latino community, which blends a social atmosphere with
activism on campus to create a forum where members can
explore their shared history, argue for political points im
portant to them and build connections to other groups at
the University.
Activism and the National Stage
"Coming to Stanford, you assume that people are open
minded and see the world in a different way, but when
they're like 'Oh, you're making a big
deal because you're Latina,' ... that's
the scarier part," said MEChA com
munity liaison Alexandra Salgado
'll.
"We often feel that because we're
educated, because we're in California
and because we're all kind of liberal,
that [discrimination] doesn't happen
here, but I think it happens more
often than we realize," Stacy Villalo
bos'll added.
So how is discrimination reflected
in Stanford's Latino community?
Students interviewed for this arti
cle said they believed discrimination
has recently increased at the national
level.
Villalobos said using the term "il
legal immigrant" in legislation, such
as Arizona's recent immigration law,
is a cover for racial animus.
MEChA co-chair Aracely Mon
dragon 'l3 added that in San Diego,
her hometown, efforts to prevent en
trance into the U.S. are apparent.
"You see a lot of [U.S. Immigration
and Customs Enforcement] check
points ... set up randomly on streets,
[to] stop cars, ask for drivers' licenses,
check paperwork," Mondragon said.
Last year, numerous Latino stu
dent groups at Stanford simulated a
border checkpoint, stopping anyone
wearing red to protest Arizona's im
migration legislation.
"We tabled for the DREAM Act at
the beginning of the year, when it
came up to vote —we put tables
around campus so that people could
call their senators and ask them for
support," Mondragon said.
But while students emphasized
the success of that and similar events,
they said the way they are set up
could affect the events' effectiveness.
"It all depends on how actions are
organized," Salgado said. "Some peo
ple would take [pamphlets] and read
them, but most... would be like,
"Move! You're in my way! I'm gonna
crash into you! "You wonder ... '[are
we] raising awareness or annoying
people?"'

The Latino 'Comunidad'

The existence of groups that ap
peal to Latinos bolsters intra-com
munity and multicultural under
standing, Salgado said.
Some students interviewed for this
article said they didn't expect to
spend a lot of time with Latino groups
during their undergraduate years, but
they all found a wealth of outlets that

allowed them to explore their roots
and issues significant to Latinos.
Ballet Folklorico co-chair Bianca
Alvarez 'll said that because she
came from a predominantly white
high school, she had always felt differ
ent. But at Stanford, she found a wel
coming "comunidad," as students in
volved in El Centra Chicano some
times refer to themselves.
"When I don't have a place to go, I
come to Centra, I hang out with a lot
of Ballet people," she said.
Aside from providing a forum
where Latino students can discuss
their ethnic roots, these groups also
introduce students to political issues
they might not have otherwise known
about. These interactions often arise
from collaboration between MEChA
and organizations like Stanford Stu
dents for Queer Liberation and the
Pilipino American Student Union.
"I can't imagine campus without
MEChA or the Black Student Union
," Salgado said. "We make people
know that when something is bad for
our community ... we act upon it and
we're not complacent."
Latino groups on campus said
they also try to address the misper
ception that Latino groups restrict
their membership to those within the
Hispanic community.
"What's unfortunate is that some
think that if you're not Latino, you
can't join," Mondragon remarked.

"We encourage non-Latinos to join,
especially if you want to learn more
about the community."
Even for ethnic-themed resi
dences like Casa Zapata, some peo
ple misperceive what it takes to be an
"adequate" member.
"My freshman year, one of my
good friends actually said at one
point,'l don't want to go into Zapata!
I'm not Mexican enough!'" Alvarez
said. "My sorority [emphasizes] the
fact that we're Latina-interest, but
not Latina-exclusive."
Alvarez also said that El Centro
Chicano, which attracts a predomi
nantly Mexican group, is making an
effort to appeal to the greater Stan
ford community by purchasing flags
and food from all of Latin America.
Although students said there is
work to be done promoting discrimi
nation awareness on campus, they
note that collaboration among stu
dents groups is a step in the right di
rection. Similarly, they add that more,
different Latino nationalities within
the "comunidad" and the few non-
Latino members are assets to the
community.
"One of the co-chairs [of Ballet]
this year ... he's from Germany," said
Alvarez. "He stayed because of the
dynamics of the group."
