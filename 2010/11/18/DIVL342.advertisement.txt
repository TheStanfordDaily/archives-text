8 Things You Need to Know to Survive
the 21 st century: A View From Indonesia
H.E. Dr. Dino Patti Djalal
Ambassador of the Republic of Indonesia
to the United States of America
What will the 21st century be like? Should
human beings expect the worst —or the best?
After addressing these questions, Dr. Djalal will
recommend what nations and individuals must
do, in his view, to adapt to what promises to be an
amazing period in human history.
Dr. Djalal is an author, activist, film producer,
former presidential adviser, and Indonesia's new ambassador to the
United States. He will speak at Stanford fresh from the November
2010 summit between Indonesian President Yudhoyono and US
President Obama in Jakarta. Since September Dr. Djalal has been his
country's ambassador to the US, arguably the youngest Indonesian
ever to hold that position. He has published widely on topics
ranging from foreign policy to leadership skills. From 2004 to 2010
he was President Yudhoyono's top staff adviser, speech-writer, and
spokesperson on foreign affairs. His 2000 doctorate is from the
London School of Economics and Political Science.
