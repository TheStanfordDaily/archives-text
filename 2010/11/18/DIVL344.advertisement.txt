MILK PAIL MARKET
77*- heart/oar /wag //'tt/e store, that has es/eryth>a^
Why is it hard to find local
products in big stores ?
Stores are MARKETING GIANTS, but Pto
they make anything ? What they do is find HUGE
companies that have production capacity, and
then those production companies make STORE
BRAND products for the MARKETING GIANTS. It's
not likely that Costco has a winery where Kirkland
branded wine is produced, or Walmart has a soda
pop factory, or Whole Foods owns a Soy Milk Plant.
Even Trader Joe would be hard to find making Pasta
in his own plant in Italy. The Milk Pail believes in being
real... we believe in allowing hard working owners of
small food factories the chance to market their own
products under their own label at our store I

the caves all year round.

Is it true the Milk
fail has 24 cows ?
Many of you know that in the 1970"s
the Milk Pail was a "Micro Milk Process
ing Plant" Inside where the cheeses
are now sold were two 300 galon VAT
MILK PASTEURIZERS, a small milk
homogenizer and a milk separator to
remove the cream from the milk. Today
the Milk Pail keeps its history alive by having cows on Paul's farm in Or
land. CA Just recently faul began making Fromage Blanc cheese in his
new CHEESE ROOM using milk from the Mit Pad Cows! We hope to turn
Pauls farm into a sustainable dairy operation by selling his Fromage
Blanc to Restaurants and Stores that support "Shop Local" principle*
