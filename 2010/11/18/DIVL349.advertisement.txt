or two generations of Iranians, their most
personal moments of the sublime, and their
most public periods of national exuberance, their
joys of love and pains of separation have been
inseparable from the tender and thunderous
voice and music of Mohammad-Reza Shajarian.
Today his reputation extends far beyond Iran's
borders. Considered one of the great fifty voices
in the world, he is an artist of myriad talents.
He is a master calligrapher and carpenter,
acclaimed song-writer and composer, and the
best embodiment of an artist for whom art is not
a commodity for commerce, but an existential
expression of all that is good and evil in us.
His remarkable command of Persian poetry-

both classical and modern â€”has allowed him to
turn the lyrics of his songs into the voice of the
voiceless, and a map for the trials and tribulation

despotism, democracy, dogmatism and freedom.
For Iranian music, he has been a relentless
guardian of tradition and a refreshing force for
innovation and change. Whether it is in new
musical instruments he has invented, and or
innovative renditions of classical arrangements,
he combines genius and talent with dedication,
discipline and erudition, and the result has been
a body of work singular in its depth, beauty,
innovation, and finally unfailing dedication to
justice and freedom.
