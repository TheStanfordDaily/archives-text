## THE
						CAMPUS BEAT Play Music? Compose Too 
### Lucas Will Johnson 
Imitation is the finest form of flattery, so the
saying goes. In western music, imitation is
an incredibly dominant part of the culture.
Even though the arts are a creative endeavor,
musicians are usually taught to copy other
musicians. When you take instrument lessons,
they don't start by asking you to make some
thing up. Instead it's, "Here's some sheet
music learn this piece that someone else
wrote."
Contrast that with writing. The entire disci
pline is based on you expressing your own
thoughts. You might borrow a quote or an
idea, but you're encouraged to say it in your
own way. Or think about art sure you might
see someone practicing a technique by copy
ing a painting in a museum, but an artist's port
folio is entirely his or her own work. In all ex
pressive mediums, we learn the technique so
that we can join the fun, and we learn the
repertoire so we can progress from what came
before. But for some reason, new musicians
aren't asked to write their own music as a core
of the training philosophy.
Part of it is because music has historically
relied on live performance. We've only been
able to record sounds for the last century or so.
Instrumentalists were needed to communi
cate the music that composers wrote, so most
often the training focused on being a jukebox.
Perhaps more importantly, though, people
love music they recognize. Take a local exam
ple: the LSJUMB. Even though creativity and
spontaneity is practically the mission, they
only ever play cover songs. Band members
arrange the charts, but that's a very particular
type of creativity, and not everyone in the
band does it.
I'm not suggesting that the music world is
devoid of composers, just that invention is not
part of the standard musical toolkit. The jazz
tradition encourages people to build a melody
on the spot, and there are an overwhelming
number of songwriters and bands. But in for
mal instrumental training, the emphasis is
heavy on technique and repertoire.
Which is too bad, because I think it institu
tionally discourages many people from writ
ing music. Composition can seem like a talent
that only a select few Beethovens possess, so a
lot of instrumentalists shy away from it. Either
that or it's only for those in the "complex"
realm of jazz.
How exactly might we shift toward encour
aging every musician to compose? You create
an environment where it's omnipresent. Put
up white boards with staves in practice rooms;
have a variety of facilities where different
kinds of ensembles can organically form and
devise their own sound; make the technology
for recording and transcribing widely avail-

able to everyone; create more ways to show
case compositions; etc, etc.
I'm imagining some violin player, after
practicing for a half hour, fiddling around until
she comes up with something cool, which she
jots down on a nearby white board before
going back to practicing. Later she comes back
to it and extends it into an entire piece. Or
three people who play some bizarre combina
tion of instruments want to try out the sound
of their ensemble. So they set up a month's
worth of jam sessions in some room and put
out a little set of recordings at the end. For
anyone, it's easy to take a class on sound
recording or composition, and every music
lesson includes a few minutes of improv work.
Rather than one CD of 20 student composi
tions per year, there are several released at
dozens of concerts.
Because, though performing is a rush,
there's such a satisfaction in creation. It's the
"Wow! I made that!" feeling from producing
all types of outputs, like computer programs,
short stories, small feats of mechanical engi
neering or published original research. We
create exciting environments of innovation in
technical disciplines to improve the material
aspects of life, so why can't we build similar
settings for musical innovation?
It's not like there would be a lack of demand
for the music people would come up with. The
culture of music listening involves finding new
songs all the time: you like what's on your iPod,
but discovering another good artist is always re
freshing. And at college, people are pretty en
thusiastic about their friends' creative work, so
composers could find audiences.
Fortunately, recording equipment has be
come cheap enough in recent years that a lot
more people are able to make music. But the
paradigm of music lessons hasn't caught up
with the technology. Musicians will still learn
cover songs, orchestras will still put
Tchaikovsky on their programs, and that's
awesome. But if every musician were a com
poser, perhaps a few more would feel the flat
tery of imitation and the rest of us could enjoy
an even wider world of music.
