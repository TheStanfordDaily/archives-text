## I'm abroad and I'm not coming back ... this year. 
### Zahra Axinn 
When I was counting down the days to
my departure for Oxford, f was sad to
leave. During my last month of sum
mer, f stayed at home in San Francisco, f spent
a lot of time dashing back and forth between
Stanford and the City. Being around campus
during NSO, f saw my friends. While f was say
ing goodbye to all of them, I started to think
about how much f would miss them and I felt
an ache for Stanford and the Bay even though
I hadn't left yet.
Despite the preemptive homesickness, I was
itching for a change. I had spent the better part
of two years in the Stanford bubble and the bet
ter part of my life in the Bay. When I applied
and got into the BOSP in Oxford, it was still
winter quarter of last year, so I knew that I
would be abroad before I even knew what
classes f was going to take in the spring. The
idea of going to Oxford was both exhilarating
and scary, f was going to be living in England! I
was going to be working harder than ever, f was
moving away from home.
After pining over the people and places that
meant home to me, I packed my bags in one day
and left for the UK. I arrived in Oxford in one
piece. Quickly, t got picked up by the whirlwind
of Oxford's intense and fast-paced Michaelmas
term, which lasts only eight weeks. I found my
self living in a new mini-bubble called the Stan
ford Ffouse, which might be the best living situ
ation I've had "at Stanford" thanks to a great
group of people (and access to open kitchens
for the first time in college!). The other Stan
ford students in the house are people who I
have come to trust as friends and respect as
scholars, athletes, musicians and writers. I ar
rived knowing fewer than four people out of
the 47 individuals living in the house. I've real
ized quickly how lucky I have been to meet all
of them because if I weren't here in Oxford, I
honestly would never have crossed paths with
many of them on campus.
Oxford beyond the Stanford House is bet
ter than I could have imagined. I'm working on
a tutorial in postcolonial literature, which is
pushing me to become a better reader and
writer every day perfect for my English
major. I'm also taking a Shakespeare course
right here in England, something that is hard to
believe at times. I've had the chance to pursue
extracurriculars the Oxford water polo
team and the singing group I've joined have
been amazing so far. Stanford students have the
chance to be a part of one of three colleges here

at Oxford I'm in Magdalen (pronounced
"Maud-lin") and it's great, because we get the
opportunity to mingle with Oxford students as
much as we want.
I originally signed up to stay in Oxford for
two quarters somewhat apprehensively. How
would I like it? Would being far away from
home be tough? Once I got here, I quickly real
ized that the opportunity to study and live
abroad was something I couldn't take lightly.
How often does anyone get the chance to be at
more than one elite university as an undergrad
uate? Hardly ever. I decided that I would com
mit to being at Oxford until March, and then, I
also applied and got into the Paris program for
spring quarter. I've accepted the spot and will
be abroad for the entirety of the 'lO-'ll aca
demic year. I realized early on that this meant
sacrificing my whole junior year on campus,
and missing out on seeing some of my closest
friends graduate with the class of 2011.1 know
that there will be times when I'll wish I could be
back in California, but I also know how much I
stand to gain from being here in Europe for
longer than just three months. As this first quar
ter starts to wind down, I feel like I'm just get
ting started. I'm already having a great time,
and I can't wait to see what's going to happen
next.
