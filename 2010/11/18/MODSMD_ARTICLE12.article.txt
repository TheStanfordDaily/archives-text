# THIS COLUMN IS IRONIC
## Home Is Where the Heart (and 'The Office') Is 
### Shane Savitsky 
Ah, Thanksgiving break is almost upon
us. It's that wonderful time of year
where you get to head home for a
week and "relax" except it's still the middle
of the quarter, finals are looming and you have
a ton of work to do. As for my Thanksgiving
plans, I'll be flying cross-country to sleep in my
own bed and reap the benefits of some home
cooked meals instead of the dining hall's mo
notony. (Seriously, if I have to stare down
FloMo's hummus bar one more time, I might
lose it.) I also have to start working on a 20-
page paper that's due during Dead Week.
Thanks, Stanford!
Where exactly am I heading home to for
Thanksgiving, you ask? It's kind of a touchy
subject because when I tell you, you're invari
ably going to respond with the exact thing I
don't want to hear. It's both a blessing and a
curse. If you meet me, we can easily make con
versation and bond over the topic of my
hometown, but I'm probably just going to re
sent you for it.
I think it's best to explain this predicament
with an anecdote. It was spring quarter of my
freshman year and I found myself in my first
PoliSci 1 section. As per Stanford tradition, we
had to go around the table and awkwardly in
troduce ourselves. (You know you can only
talk to these people under two conditions: (1)
in section and (2) drunkenly bonding over
your section at some party.) My turn arrived
and I said something like, "Hi, I'm Shane. I'm
a freshman. I'm not sure what I want to major
in yet. And I'm from ... Scranton, Pennsylva
nia." Boom. Invariably, someone had to say,
"No way! Do you know Dwight Schrute?"
And after months of the same jokes, I could
only snap back, "I don't associate with fiction
al characters." Obviously, I didn't make too
many friends in that section.

So there we are: I'm from Scranton, Pa.
home of "The Office," It's been said that
Scranton is where you want to be when the
world ends because everything happens 20
years later there. I promise that's not true.
Well, it might be kind of true, but think of
things this way it'll never be as yuppie as
downtown Palo Alto. That can only be a good
thing.
Let's get a few misconceptions about
Scranton out of the way really quickly: Scran
ton is most definitely not the worst place you
can imagine I'd argue that distinction now
belongs to the Jersey Shore. It was the political
center of the United States during the 2008
election. All of the bros out there will appreci
ate that Dave Matthews Band plays 10 min
utes from my house every summer. Plus,
Scranton has the most delicious pizza on
earth. Unfortunately though, Michael Scott
does not exist. Dwight Schrute does not exist.
Jim Halpert does not exist (though some
would argue that I'm as charming and attrac
tive as he is). I'm pretty sure there's a paper
company somewhere in Scranton, but I doubt
it's as cool as Dunder Mifflin.

And there's the really ironic thing. Some
how, this TV show has made my hometown
which was chosen precisely because it's so
boring cool. Honestly, maybe I should stop
resenting "The Office" comparisons so much.
If this little TV show can make everyone at
Stanford somehow love where I come from,
then that can only be a good thing, right?
So in a few short days, I'll be escaping the
pre-finals stresses of the Stanford bubble for
the relative tundra of Scranton, Pa. (high
today: 45 degrees). It might not be anywhere
near as exciting as the Bay Area, but it's still
home. Plus, it's far less pretentious than a lot of
Stanford (Theta special dinner, I'm looking at

you). We all need to get some space and es
cape to our own little enclaves, if only for
week. I think a lot of people can say that about
their hometowns albeit without a popular
NBC sitcom getting in the way.
That's not to say that I don't love the Farm.
It's just good to have a break sometimes. After
all, as one of my best friends from home, Mr.
Joseph Daniel, likes to say: "Scranton is the
best place on Earth to come home to, but it's
also the best place to leave,"
