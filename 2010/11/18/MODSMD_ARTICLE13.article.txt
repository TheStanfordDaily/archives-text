Stop Writing About Four Loko

Dear Editor,
Lately, I've been reading far too many ar
ticles about the dangers of drinking Four
Loko, which many news outlets would have
you believe is "Agent Orange" in a 24-ounce
can. The problem is, everyone is viewing this
debate from the wrong perspective. When
referring to whether Stanford University
should ban Four Loko, David Nelson, in a re
cent Daily column ("The Problem of Four
Loko," Nov. 15), stated, "[t]he University
should never take it upon itself to deny us
any of the privileges of an adult in United
States." In that sentence, we see a stereotyp
ical libertarian attitude fused with the rebel
lious nature of youth. In another statement,
he writes, "[a]s its popularity has increased,
Four Loko has been blamed for a growing
number of unpleasant instances."
David Nelson, along with many others,
has completely missed the big picture. Four
Loko is popular because of the attention it
receives, not in spite of it. In other words, it
became popular because of its negative
media attention. Basically, Four Loko is the
Kim Kardashian of alcoholic drinks. Think
about it: The amount of media coverage this
drink receives is completely disproportion
al to the number of students who consume
the drink and the severity of the risk it
poses; i.e., like Kardashian, it should not be
as famous as it is.
If you think Kim Kardashian's sex tape
hurt her career, you're either sadly mistaken
or not watching it correctly. In the same man
ner that the sex tape made people want to see
more of her, universities banning Four Loko
make students want to drink it. The reasoning
is simple: it is human nature to want to do
what a parental figure does not want you to
do. Writers like Nelson are mistaken to treat
this like a political issue and start referencing
their inherent rights as Americans. The Four
Loko debate is a cultural and generational
one. When Tipper Gore and Hillary Clinton
launched their campaign against gangster
rap, NWA laughed all the way to bank. Simi
larly, the more you talk about Four Loko, the

more you make it cool. The key to an under
ground marketing campaign is creating a
buzz and garnering media attention. Every
anti-Four Loko story in The Daily or on CNN
is the equivalent of a Four Loko advertise
ment by Don Draper. Ask the Catholic
Church how its abstinence campaign worked
out, or ask D.A.R.E. how many kids "passed
on grass" as a result of its anti-drug campaign.
Yes, the drink is dangerous, but it is not as
dangerous as people think. Finally, it's not
even the only drink of its kind. Spark and

Sisco have similar effects, and don't think 24
ounces of Red Bull and vodka is any safer
than Four Loko. Again, Kim Kardashian was
not the only rich heiress with a sex tape; she
just played the media the right way. Don't
think Four Loko is not benefiting from the
same type of attention. I will drink three Fri
day night; you should too! Don't you want to
be cool?
