## REVENGE AT BIG SPIKE Stanford, Cal clash in battle for Pac-10 
### KATHERINE KNOX CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The No. 2 Stanford women's vol
leyball team (22-2,13-2 Pac-10) will
head across the Bay this Friday to
take on No. 4 California (23-2,13-2)
in Berkeley. The winner of Big
Spike will gain sole position atop
the Pac-10 standings, as the teams
are currently tied for the lead with
two losses each.
In addition to their tied records,
the Golden Bears and the Cardinal
match up closely in both individual
and team statistics. Stanford senior
outside hitter Alix Klineman cur
rently leads the Pac-10 with an aver
age of 5.55 kills per set, while Cal's
primary attacker, Tarah Murrey, is a
close second with 5.21 kills per set.
Murrey and Klineman also lead the
conference in hitting attempts, which
will put pressure on the middles of
both teams to get from pin to pin.
Klineman put down 22 kills dur
ing the meeting with the Bears in
Maples last month, but Stanford
still fell to Cal, 21-25, 25-16, 25-22,
25-16. The Cardinal squad still leads
the nation with a .321 team hitting
percentage, while Cal ranks second
in conference.
For the Golden Bears, senior set
ter Carli Lloyd dictates a fast and
aggressive pin-to-pin offense that
runs Murrey in both the front and
back row, while pressuring the op
posing block to keep an eye on first
tempo middle sets. Middle blocker
Shannon Hawari and opposite hit
ter Correy Johnson both hit over
.500 on 31 cumulative swings during
Cal's last meeting with the Cardinal,
putting down 19 combined kills in

addition to the 21 Murrey earned.
Stanford senior libero Gabi
Ailes broke the 2,000 career digs
mark in Washington last weekend
and the Card remains second in the
Pac-10 in digs per set. However, Cal
is not as strong on defense the
team ranks eighth in the Pac-10 in
digs per set.
Nonetheless, defensive short
comings are often compensated for
by the blocking successes of Hawari
and middle blocker Kat Brown,
who occupy the top two rankings in
blocks per set in the Pac-10. Lloyd
rounds out the top 10, which is an
uncharacteristic statistic for a setter
to excel in. Overall, the Bears lead
the Pac-10 with 3.02 blocks per set.
"Cal really surprised us with
their blocking and defense last time
we played them," Klineman said.

"They also exposed some of our
blocking weaknesses, so we've been
focusing on blocking technique in
practice for a while now."
The emphasis is reflected in a
statistical improvement in blocking
statistics the Card has risen to
third in the Pac-10 in blocks per set.
The development of freshman mid
dle blocker Carly Wopat has been
fundamental to Stanford's success
at the net. With the injury to redshirt
junior middle blocker Stephanie
Browne, Wopat has become the
Cardinal's blocking leader with 1.08
blocks per set.
Browne and Wopat contributed
12 combined kills during Stanford's
last meeting with Cal, while fresh
man outside hitter Rachel Williams
and sophomore opposite Hayley
Spelman added 21 more kills com
bined. Redshirt sophomore Jessica
Walker will replace Browne on the
court this Friday in Berkeley.
Yet the biggest difference be
tween the last match and the im
pending one is the reemergence of
sophomore setter Karissa Cook and
the 6-2 offense. With Cook on the
floor, senior setter/opposite Cassidy
Lichtman can swing on the right
side when Spelman reaches the
back row, adding a sixth offensive
threat to the Cardinal lineup.
"Playing Cal is a huge challenge,
and also really exciting," Klineman
said. "It's our rival, it's for the Pac
-10 championship, it's in their gym ..
. a lot is on the line."

First serve is set for Friday at 7
p.m. in Berkeley's Haas Pavilion.
