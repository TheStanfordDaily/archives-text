## Card seeks important victory in Big Splash 
### DASH DAVIDSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The No. 5 Stanford men's water
polo team (13-6,5-2 MPSF) will head
up to Berkeley on Friday evening to
take on No. 1 California (20-2,7-0) in
the annual Big Splash.
Cal, the top team in the nation
since Stanford knocked off then-No.
1 USC on Oct. 9, is coming off a
strong win over Pacific on Saturday
the same Pacific team that defeat
ed the Cardinal on Sunday. The
Golden Bears have won an impres
sive 12 straight games, including a
victory over two-time defending
NCAA champion USC, with their
last loss coming on Oct. 2 to UC-
Irvine.
The Bears have already defeated
Stanford twice this year, both closely
contested affairs that took place in
the opening weeks of the season.
Thanks to the defeat of Pacific and
the Tigers' subsequent victory over
Stanford this past weekend, Cal has
already secured the No. 1 seed at next
week's Mountain Pacific Sports Fed
eration (MPSF) Tournament, which
will take place at Stanford's Avery
Aquatic Center.
Cal's best player, and quite possi
bly the best player in the country, is
junior attacker Ivan Rackov. Rackov

has compiled an impressive resume
this season that includes 63 goals in
21 matches, for an MPSF-leading
per-game average of 3.00 goals. He
also is the only player in the confer
ence to win the MPSF player of the
week award twice this season.
On defense, the Golden Bears are
anchored by sophomore goalie
Justin Parsons, who has recorded 140
