# PAC-10 POWER RANKINGS

### 
Every week, Jacob Jaffe will give his Pac-10 football power rankings. These represent a
measure of current success, not a prediction of future standings or a measure of talent.
1. Oregon (10-0, 7-0 Pac-10) UP NEXT: Bye

Whew. For the first time all year, the Ducks looked human. Oregon was not the offen
i sive juggernaut it had been all year, and the entire country saw its vulnerability. The
game, and the national title race, could have been altered greatly if Cal kicker

Giorgio Tavecchio could have waited for the snap on a short field goal. On the other hand,
you could say that Oregon played about as poorly as it could, on the road, and still found a
way to win. It remains to be seen if any other team will be able to contain the Duck offense
that well, but the nation certainly knows now that Oregon has a defense, too.

2. Stanford (9-1,6-1 Pac-10) UP NEXT: at California

Just like Oregon, Stanford showed it can win without style points or a strong offensive
showing. It is even more surprising to see the Cardinal win with defense, but that is just
what happened in Tempe on Saturday. Still, that kind of effort on offense (0.5 yards
per carry in the first half) will not get the job done in most games. Stanford can be glad

to escape Arizona State with a win, but it has a lot of work to do if it wants to get back to the
form it had in blowout wins over Washington and Arizona. That all starts with a rivalry game
so important to both teams' bowl hopes that it truly deserves the title of Big Game.

3. USC (7-3, 4-3 Pac-10) UP NEXT: at Oregon State

Being ineligible for postseason play doesn't seem to have taken anything away from
the Trojans' effort this season, which is certainly a reason why USC finds itself in a tie
for third in the conference. The men of Troy were the latest victors over previously hot
Arizona, bringing their win total to seven. With games against Oregon State, Notre

Dame and UCLA— none of whom is over .500 left on the schedule, a nine-win season is
very possible if not likely, and USC could still make it to 10 wins.

4. California (5-5, 3-4 Pac-10) UP NEXT: vs. Stanford

Yes, the Golden Bears lost, but the way they hung in the game right until the very end
' against arguably the best team in the nation speaks volumes about what they can
* bring to the table as long as that table is at Memorial Stadium. Still, in the top-

heavy Pac-10, if you can hold Oregon to 15 points, you can beat anyone. And now, Cal has
a perfect scenario: two more games, both at home, with one being a rivalry game that has the
potential to spoil Stanford's season. Even with weak quarterback play from new starter Brock
Mansion, the Bears are still a formidable foe.

5. Arizona (7-3,4-3 Pac-10) UP NEXT: Bye

What the Wildcats wouldn't give to go back in time two weeks. Back then, they were
riding a three-game winning streak and were very much in the thick of the Rose Bowl
race. They had a vaunted defense that was particularly staunch against the run, and

they were getting starting quarterback Nick Foles back from injury in time for the stretch run.
Now, after just two weeks, Arizona has lost twice in a row while giving up four rushing touch
downs to Stanford's Stepfan Taylor and 160 yards on the ground to USC's Marc Tyler. The
Wildcats desperately need this bye week in order to regroup for their final two games, which
will not be easy at Oregon and vs. Arizona State.

6. UCLA (4-5, 2-4 Pac-10) UP NEXT: at Washington (Thurs.)

While the Bruins were taking their bye week, the bottom of the Pac-10 got even
fcmore muddled. Yet, despite a weak start and a season-ending injury to starting
quarterback Kevin Prince, UCLA has a decently good chance of going bowling

again. The Bruins must win at least two of their final three games at Washington, at Arizona
State and vs. USC to keep playing over the holidays, and each of those games is certainly
winnable. Or losable. That's the way of this year's Pac-10.

7. Arizona Stale (4-6, 2-5 Pac-10) UP NEXT: Bye

Another team in the "moral victory" category, the Sun Devils once again found them
selves just short of a big win. The way Arizona State has managed to lose close games
so often this season whether from missed field goals, blocked extra points, stupid
personal fouls or just poor fourth-quarter play has to bring into question if the Sun

Devils lack that final step, or if they are just playing at their peak to even make the games close.
Either way, it looks like fans in Tempe will have to wait another year for a bowl game.

8. Washington (3-6,2-4 Pac-10) UP NEXT: vs. UCLA (Thurs.)

This past bye week could be crucial if it means the return of quarterback Jake
y Locker from injury, because the Huskies could certainly use their top playmakerfor
the final three games of the season. Washington has three winnable matchups

ahead, but it will need to win all three in order to accomplish its preseason goal and make a
bowl game. Thursday night's game against UCLA is almost an elimination game for bowl eli
gibility, and a win in that one could lead to a similar situation at Cal next week.

9. Washington State (2-9, 1-7 Pac-10) UP NEXT: Bye

Yep, you read that right. That's Washington State, with a number besides 10 next
to its name. That's also Washington State without a bagel in the Pac-10 wins col
umn. And the Cougars earned it. Playing against a perennially strong second-half
team, Wazzu absolutely dominated the Beavers in Corvallis. The defense, which

came into the game as one of the most pathetic units in the country, performed remarkably,
shutting out a good Oregon State offense in the first half. A big road win (the team's first out
side the state of Washington since 2006) has to send positive messages to the athletic depart
ment, fans and players, and it figures to be a sign of things to come for a program looking to
get back on its feet.

10. Oregon State (4-5, 3-3 Pac-10) UP NEXT: vs. USC

Sure, the Beavers are probably not the worst team in the Pac-10. After all, they are
, currently the only team that could still sneak into the top two in the conference besides
* Oregon and Stanford. But getting pushed around at home by one of the nation's

worst teams doesn't bring up thoughts of conference placement. It brings up questions about every
thing from the importance of James Rodgers to the quality of his brother Jacquizz to the readiness
of quarterback Ryan Katz to the play of the lines to the general talent of the team. Unfortunately for
Oregon State, its next three contests are a murderer's row vs. USC, at Stanford, vs. Oregon
and the Beavers need at least two wins in that span to salvage a bowl game.

Either way, it looks like fans in Tempe will have to wait another year for a bowl game.

8. Washington (3-6,2-4 Pac-10) UP NEXT: vs. UCLA (Thurs.)

This past bye week could be crucial if it means the return of quarterback Jake
y Locker from injury, because the Huskies could certainly use their top playmakerfor
the final three games of the season. Washington has three winnable matchups

ahead, but it will need to win all three in order to accomplish its preseason goal and make a
bowl game. Thursday night's game against UCLA is almost an elimination game for bowl eli
gibility, and a win in that one could lead to a similar situation at Cal next week.

9. Washington State (2-9, 1-7 Pac-10) UP NEXT: Bye

Yep, you read that right. That's Washington State, with a number besides 10 next
to its name. That's also Washington State without a bagel in the Pac-10 wins col
umn. And the Cougars earned it. Playing against a perennially strong second-half
team, Wazzu absolutely dominated the Beavers in Corvallis. The defense, which

came into the game as one of the most pathetic units in the country, performed remarkably,
shutting out a good Oregon State offense in the first half. A big road win (the team's first out
side the state of Washington since 2006) has to send positive messages to the athletic depart
ment, fans and players, and it figures to be a sign of things to come for a program looking to
get back on its feet.

10. Oregon State (4-5, 3-3 Pac-10) UP NEXT: vs. USC

Sure, the Beavers are probably not the worst team in the Pac-10. After all, they are
, currently the only team that could still sneak into the top two in the conference besides
* Oregon and Stanford. But getting pushed around at home by one of the nation's

worst teams doesn't bring up thoughts of conference placement. It brings up questions about every
thing from the importance of James Rodgers to the quality of his brother Jacquizz to the readiness
of quarterback Ryan Katz to the play of the lines to the general talent of the team. Unfortunately for
Oregon State, its next three contests are a murderer's row vs. USC, at Stanford, vs. Oregon
and the Beavers need at least two wins in that span to salvage a bowl game.

1. Oregon (10-0, 7-0 Pac-10) UP NEXT: Bye

Whew. For the first time all year, the Ducks looked human. Oregon was not the offen
i sive juggernaut it had been all year, and the entire country saw its vulnerability. The
game, and the national title race, could have been altered greatly if Cal kicker

Giorgio Tavecchio could have waited for the snap on a short field goal. On the other hand,
you could say that Oregon played about as poorly as it could, on the road, and still found a
way to win. It remains to be seen if any other team will be able to contain the Duck offense
that well, but the nation certainly knows now that Oregon has a defense, too.

2. Stanford (9-1,6-1 Pac-10) UP NEXT: at California

Just like Oregon, Stanford showed it can win without style points or a strong offensive
showing. It is even more surprising to see the Cardinal win with defense, but that is just
what happened in Tempe on Saturday. Still, that kind of effort on offense (0.5 yards
per carry in the first half) will not get the job done in most games. Stanford can be glad

to escape Arizona State with a win, but it has a lot of work to do if it wants to get back to the
form it had in blowout wins over Washington and Arizona. That all starts with a rivalry game
so important to both teams' bowl hopes that it truly deserves the title of Big Game.

3. USC (7-3, 4-3 Pac-10) UP NEXT: at Oregon State

Being ineligible for postseason play doesn't seem to have taken anything away from
the Trojans' effort this season, which is certainly a reason why USC finds itself in a tie
for third in the conference. The men of Troy were the latest victors over previously hot
Arizona, bringing their win total to seven. With games against Oregon State, Notre

Dame and UCLA— none of whom is over .500 left on the schedule, a nine-win season is
very possible if not likely, and USC could still make it to 10 wins.

4. California (5-5, 3-4 Pac-10) UP NEXT: vs. Stanford

Yes, the Golden Bears lost, but the way they hung in the game right until the very end
' against arguably the best team in the nation speaks volumes about what they can
* bring to the table as long as that table is at Memorial Stadium. Still, in the top-

heavy Pac-10, if you can hold Oregon to 15 points, you can beat anyone. And now, Cal has
a perfect scenario: two more games, both at home, with one being a rivalry game that has the
potential to spoil Stanford's season. Even with weak quarterback play from new starter Brock
Mansion, the Bears are still a formidable foe.

5. Arizona (7-3,4-3 Pac-10) UP NEXT: Bye

What the Wildcats wouldn't give to go back in time two weeks. Back then, they were
riding a three-game winning streak and were very much in the thick of the Rose Bowl
race. They had a vaunted defense that was particularly staunch against the run, and

they were getting starting quarterback Nick Foles back from injury in time for the stretch run.
Now, after just two weeks, Arizona has lost twice in a row while giving up four rushing touch
downs to Stanford's Stepfan Taylor and 160 yards on the ground to USC's Marc Tyler. The
Wildcats desperately need this bye week in order to regroup for their final two games, which
will not be easy at Oregon and vs. Arizona State.

6. UCLA (4-5, 2-4 Pac-10) UP NEXT: at Washington (Thurs.)

While the Bruins were taking their bye week, the bottom of the Pac-10 got even
fcmore muddled. Yet, despite a weak start and a season-ending injury to starting
quarterback Kevin Prince, UCLA has a decently good chance of going bowling

again. The Bruins must win at least two of their final three games at Washington, at Arizona
State and vs. USC to keep playing over the holidays, and each of those games is certainly
winnable. Or losable. That's the way of this year's Pac-10.

7. Arizona Stale (4-6, 2-5 Pac-10) UP NEXT: Bye

Another team in the "moral victory" category, the Sun Devils once again found them
selves just short of a big win. The way Arizona State has managed to lose close games
so often this season whether from missed field goals, blocked extra points, stupid
personal fouls or just poor fourth-quarter play has to bring into question if the Sun

Devils lack that final step, or if they are just playing at their peak to even make the games close.
Either way, it looks like fans in Tempe will have to wait another year for a bowl game.

8. Washington (3-6,2-4 Pac-10) UP NEXT: vs. UCLA (Thurs.)

This past bye week could be crucial if it means the return of quarterback Jake
y Locker from injury, because the Huskies could certainly use their top playmakerfor
