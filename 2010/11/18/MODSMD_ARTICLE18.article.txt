# Big Game by the numbers
## 
### Jacob Jaffe Fields of Failure 
Two more davs.Two more days
until Big Game, when all the
trash talk, rituals and obscene
plays give way to a single
football game. Two days until
the destination of the Axe is decided,
and two days until Stanford's Rose
Bowl dreams face one of their final tests.
We all know what rides on this game.
Everything from bragging rights to bowl
berths to record books hangs in the bal
ance, and it'll all be decided in one after
noon in the remnants of what must have
once been a decent stadium in Berkeley.
This is a rivalry game, and as every
one knows, in rivalry games, "you can
throw records and statistics out the win
dow." I don't know about you, but I find
it hard to defenestrate theoretical ob
jects. So, for everyone who needs stats to
toss aside with bold claims of "It doesn't
matter, it's a rivalry game!" here you go.
Speaking of things that don't matter
to this game, let's look at the history of
the series. Stanford has won 55 of the 112
Big Games, while Cal has won 46. Yep,
11 duels between these teams have
ended in draws. Thank the Lord Jeffs we
don't need to worry about that any
more. Of games played in Berkeley, the
Cardinal holds a slim 23-21-6 advantage.
Recent history has favored the Golden
Bears, though, as Cal has won seven of
the past eight Big Games. Before that,
Stanford had won the previous seven
consecutive battles for the Axe.
Slightly more relevant than the bat
tle between Chad Hutchinson and
Justin Vedder are the current teams and

the seasons they 're having. Stanford
comes in 9-1 on the season, while Cal is
5-5, but really, who cares about records,
right? It's not like the better team usual
ly wins football games. You can easily
trump that with broad statements like
"It's a rivalry game."
If records are worthless, than who in
the world would care about stats? Who
would care that Cal is 4-1 at home and 1-
4 on the road? No one. Since football is
so unpredictable, Cal's pattern of wins
and losses makes no sense. Ok, sure, Cal
has lost to every team ranked above it in
the conference and beaten every team
below it. But these are just words. Here
are some numbers: Cal's wins have
come against teams with a combined
record of 19-31 (including a 5-5 FCS
team) while its losses have come against
teams with a combined record of 37-12.
No team it has beaten has a winning
record, while every team but 4-5 Ore
gon State that it has lost to is currently
ranked in the APTop 25.
What carries Cal in its victories, and
the reason the Golden Bears got so
close to upsetting top-ranked Oregon

last weekend, is defense. Stanford head
coach Jim Harbaugh called it the best
defense the Cardinal will see all year,
and compared preparing for it to
preparing for an NFL team. Ignoring for
a moment that Harbaugh said similar
things about Arizona's defense before
Stanford exploded for 42 points, he does
have a point. Cal is ranked in the top 15
nationally in total defense, passing effi
ciency defense and sacks. And, of
course, it only allowed one offensive
touchdown to the best scoring offense in
the country.
On the other hand, the maligned,
and at some points ridiculed, Stanford
defense ranks lower than Cal in every
statistical category... except points al
lowed. But again, that's just a worthless
stat. Go throw it in the trash where it be
longs.
All right, so Stanford doesn't give up
as many points as Cal.That's all because
of the schedule, right? Well, of the Car
dinal's six common opponents with the
Bears, three scored more against Stan
ford, while three scored more against
Cal. The one remaining team on Cal's
schedule after Big Game is Washington,
who put up a goose egg against Stan
ford, while the remaining game on Stan
ford's schedule is against Oregon State,
who dropped 35 points on Cal two
weeks before losing to Washington

State.
Yeah, yeah, but these are just num
bers. Big-time players show up big when
it counts, like in rivalry games. Big-time
players like Cal quarterback Brock
Mansion, who has filled in for the inept
Kevin Riley by showing why he was the
backup in the first place. Mansion has
completed 47 percent of his passes with
one touchdown and two interceptions
in three games. But he's older (and
therefore more able to handle the pres
sure) than Stanford quarterback An
drew Luck, who at age 21 has shown
that he's hardly prepared for the stress
of a big game.
Since you need to round out that pile
of garbage, meaningless statistics, let's
look at both teams' offenses. Obviously
it doesn't mean anything, but Stanford is
at least 35 spots above Cal nationally in
passing efficiency, passing offense, sacks
allowed, rushing offense, total offense
and scoring offense. Can't imagine any
of those coming into play.
To summarize, Stanford has no pos
sible advantage over Cal, because it's a
rivalry game and statistics are worthless.
Have fun throwing them out the win
dow.
