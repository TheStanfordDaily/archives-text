# Put up or shut up, SEC

Big Game will be a big game,
so everyone should go out
and watch Stanford foot
ball beat down those Kal
weenies. If we win, it will be
a very big deal.
There, my two sentences about this
week's Big Game. I would have written
the obligatory column about our
matchup against the Dirty Bears, but
my fellow columnists have already
spelled out pretty much everything you
need to know.
Instead, it's time for the anti-BCS
rant that has been stuck in my head for
the past couple of weeks. A lot of these
types of arguments have been bandied
about, including how the BCS is a car
tel and how it stiffs the little guy and
makes college football unfair. While I
have a lot of contentions with the BCS
itself, the organization with which I re
ally have a bone to pick is the esteemed
Southeastern Conference, or the SEC.
Let me start by saying that I have a
great deal of respect for the SEC. It has
some of the nation's most successful
and respected programs, has won nu
merous national championships (in
cluding the last four BCS titles) and has
large, passionate fan bases that pack
stadiums every Saturday.
Nevertheless, the SEC epitomizes
the "old boys network" that keeps non
automatic qualifier (non-AQ) schools
like Boise State and TCU out of the na
tional championship picture and small
er schools like Stanford from being se
rious contenders for at-large BCS
berths. All of the criticisms about the
Broncos and the Horned Frogs that
they don't play tough schedules and
couldn't beat an AQ-conference cham
pion on a neutral field have some of
their loudest proponents inside the

SEC.
First of all, I find both of these argu
ments to have questionable validity at
best. Admittedly, it's probably true that
a slate of SEC opponents is tougher
than Boise State's WAC conference
schedule, but I'm sure the Broncos
would jump at the chance to play
through, say, a Pac-10 season (not that
they're ever going to get that chance).
It's also impossible to say that they
"couldn't" beat the SEC champion: If
we knew who was going to win in any
hypothetical scenario, why bother
playing the games at all? Utah also
buried Alabama in the Sugar Bowl at
the end of the 2008 season, and since
SEC memories clearly stretch back to
that run of four national titles, I'm sure
the conference remembers that con
test.
The SEC as a whole has also figured
out how best to "game" the BCS sys
tem: play an eight-game conference
schedule and beat up on four noncon
ference patsies. Under the current

bowl system, playing tough teams out
of conference is a losing proposition:
you get little to no reward for winning
them, but losing can knock you out of
the national title discussion. Similarly,
there's no reward for playing a ninth
conference game, as both the Pac-10
and Big Ten are planning to do when
those conferences expand to 12
schools.
I'm sure Boise State and TCU
would gladly take the opportunity to

play one of the SEC's marquee pro
grams in their out-of-conference
schedules, but no SEC team will ever
schedule either school because the
downsides of losing far outweigh the
rewards for winning. I want the SEC to
put its money where its mouth is: if
these teams are so bad and play such
weak schedules, why don't you just put
them on your out-of-conference slate?
To illustrate the curious phenome
non that is SEC scheduling, let's take a
look at its West Division champion and
current national-title contender,
Auburn. The Tigers play eight SEC
foes (not counting their rematch with
South Carolina in the conference title
game) and four nonconference oppo
nents Arkansas State and
Louisiana-Monroe from the Sun Belt
Conference, FCS Chattanooga and
Clemson from the ACC. Even Clem
son, Auburn's only non-conference
BCS opponent, plays in one of the
weaker AQ conferences, and has only
compiled a 5-5 overall record and a 3-4
record in the ACC so far this season.
Auburn doesn't get punished in the
polls for playing extremely weak out
of-conference opponents (witness its
current No. 2 ranking), but its confer
ence simultaneously rails against the
non-AQs for failing to play adequately
difficult (read: SEC-level) foes.
Cautionary tales also exist of teams
who schedule tough non-AQs and get
punished for it the best example this
year is Oregon State, who scheduled
both Boise and TCU. As one might
have expected, the Beavers lost to both
teams, knocking them out of the rank
ings. Oregon State is currently 4-5 over
all and is looking at a tough road to gain
bowl eligibility had they followed
the SEC model and scheduled
Louisiana-Monroe and Portland State,
the Beavers would likely already be
bowl eligible with a 6-3 record.
The SEC needs to put up or shut
up: either schedule the non-AQ pow
ers during the regular season or pipe
down about how soft they are. Unfor
tunately for the football-loving public,
we're not likely to see these matchups
any time soon, since the BCS Grand
Poohbahs have decided that it's per
fectly okay for an SEC team to play a
bunch of weak opponents and get re
warded for it, but a team from Boise,
Idaho can't do the same thing and ex
pect to get away with it.

Schedule the
non-AQ powers
or pipe down
about how soft
they are.
