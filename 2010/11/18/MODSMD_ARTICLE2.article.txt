# Palo Alto named most expensive college town
## Average home costs almost $1.4 million, according to survey 
### SAMANTHA McGIRR DESK EDITOR 
Palo Alto is the nation's most expensive college
town, according to a recent survey by Coldwell Banker
Real Estate.
The new College Home Listing Report, released on
Nov. 11, ranked college towns in order of affordability
using the average home listing price of four-bedroom,
two-bathroom properties listed for sale between April
and September 2010. With its average listing price of
just under $1.4 million, Palo Alto claimed the title of
most expensive market. Honolulu and Los Angeles
came in second and third, respectively.
There are a variety of factors that make real estate in
Palo Alto pricier than in other college towns, according
to Carole Feldstein, a Coldwell Banker real estate
agent based in Los Altos.
"Palo Alto offers highly rated schools, a university
environment, easy access to San Francisco," she said.
"There are also business opportunities in a variety of
fields. Not all areas that have colleges have [a place like]
Silicon Valley in such close proximity."
Tiffany Griego '9B, associate director of Stanford's
Office of Real Estate, attributes the high prices to an
imbalance of supply and demand.
"There's strong demand for executive housing in the
region, given the close proximity of high-quality jobs,"
she said. However, "federal, state, and city laws protect
open space in the city so there's limited space for new
development."
According to Griego, home prices in the neighbor
hoods directly contiguous with Stanford have increased
approximately 30 percent in the past 10 years. In 2000,
a three-bedroom, two-bathroom, 1,500-square-feet
house in the immediate Stanford area cost about $1.3
million. In 2010, such a house comes in at around $1.7
million.
Although this is the first year Coldwell Banker has re
leased an affordability ranking exclusively for college
towns, Palo Alto ranked as the fourth most expensive mar
ket overall in its 2009 Home Price Comparison Index, with

an average four-bedroom, two-and-a
half-bathroom house coming in at
just under $1.5 million.
The expensive real estate market
in Palo Alto does pose difficulties in
the hiring and retaining of Universi
ty faculty, said Jan Thomson, direc
tor of Faculty Staff Housing.
"The fact that housing prices
here are higher is certainly a chal
lenge for the University," she said.
"We've been fairly successful in
dealing with it in the past, and we're
optimistic about our ability to han
dle it in the future."
Although Thomson said home
prices on campus "compare favor
ably" to Palo Alto home prices, she
pointed to University-sponsored
housing assistance programs, in
cluding loan and allowance pro
grams, designed to attract and re
tain faculty. According to Thomson,
there are currently 650 single-fami
ly homes and 200 condominiums on
campus leased by faculty and senior
staff. In addition, the new Olmsted
Terrace development includes 39

homes for faculty with reduced
prices of $700,000 to $900,000.
"For the homes at Olmsted Ter
race, we've created a new, more re
strictive ground lease to drive down
the price of homes," she said.
Key features of the lease include
cap depreciation, a non-extendable
time limit of 51 years, and an agree
ment to sell the property directly
back to the University.
Palo Alto is not the only area
market covered in dollar signs. The
report named the Pac-10 as the
most expensive football bowl subdi
vision conference; homes in the re
gion have an average price listing of
just over $570,000.
Although real estate in Palo Alto
like the markets in most other
cities took a hit during the recent
economic downturn, Feldstein em
phasizes the general strength of the
market.
"Home prices have had a lot to
do with general economic trends,"
she said. "In the past 10 years, there
have been some increases and some
price adjustments, but home prices
have always been historically strong
in Palo Alto."
