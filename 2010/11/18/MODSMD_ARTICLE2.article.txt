# Palo Alto named most expensive college town
## Average home costs almost $1.4 million, according to survey 
### SAMANTHA McGIRR DESK EDITOR 
Palo Alto is the nation's most expensive college
town, according to a recent survey by Coldwell Banker
Real Estate.
The new College Home Listing Report, released on
Nov. 11, ranked college towns in order of affordability
using the average home listing price of four-bedroom,
two-bathroom properties listed for sale between April
and September 2010. With its average listing price of
just under $1.4 million, Palo Alto claimed the title of
most expensive market. Honolulu and Los Angeles
came in second and third, respectively.
There are a variety of factors that make real estate in
Palo Alto pricier than in other college towns, according
to Carole Feldstein, a Coldwell Banker real estate
agent based in Los Altos.
"Palo Alto offers highly rated schools, a university
environment, easy access to San Francisco," she said.
"There are also business opportunities in a variety of
fields. Not all areas that have colleges have [a place like]
Silicon Valley in such close proximity."
Tiffany Griego '9B, associate director of Stanford's
Office of Real Estate, attributes the high prices to an
imbalance of supply and demand.
"There's strong demand for executive housing in the
region, given the close proximity of high-quality jobs,"
she said. However, "federal, state, and city laws protect
open space in the city so there's limited space for new
development."
According to Griego, home prices in the neighbor
hoods directly contiguous with Stanford have increased
approximately 30 percent in the past 10 years. In 2000,
a three-bedroom, two-bathroom, 1,500-square-feet
house in the immediate Stanford area cost about $1.3
million. In 2010, such a house comes in at around $1.7
million.
Although this is the first year Coldwell Banker has re
leased an affordability ranking exclusively for college
towns, Palo Alto ranked as the fourth most expensive mar
ket overall in its 2009 Home Price Comparison Index, with
