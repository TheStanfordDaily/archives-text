## GSC discusses Turkey Day, funding recs Members plan Thanksgiving, debate timeline for funding 
### ANNA SCHUESSLER STAFF WRITER 
Graduate students geared up for the upcoming
Thanksgiving vacation at this week's Graduate Stu
dent Council (GSC) meeting. Environmental sci
ences doctoral student Mary Van der Hoven, this
year's Thanksgiving coordinator, anticipates at least
1,200 attendees at this year's dinner. Based on esti
mates from last year's dinner, 20 percent of the din
ner's food will be catered to vegetarian diners.
Stanford Student Enterprises (SSE) chief execu
tive Raj Bhandari M.S. 'lO reported that the Stanford
Student Store held a Thanksgiving sale earlier on
Wednesday.
"We tried to flash-flier everyone the day before
because we thought that would be more effective,"
Bhandari said. The store plans to have a holiday sale
in three weeks.
The GSC approved eight nominees for various
University committees recommended by the ASSU
Nominations Commission. After a unanimous vote to
recommend the nominees, GSC co-chair Jessica Tsai
reminded council members to encourage their peers
to participate in student government.
Also joining the GSC was Jamie Pontius-Hogan
from the Judicial Affairs Office. Pontius-Hogan up
dated the meeting's attendees about the office's re
cently initiated self-review. Representatives of the Ju
dicial Affairs Office plan to bring in an outside con-
sultant, conduct a self-study and
form an internal review panel. A
survey of faculty and students about
the Honor Code is forthcoming as
part of the review.
"We're doing a lot with bench
marks," said Pontius-Hogan. "We're
bringing in ideas from other univer
sities."
Out of a shared interest among
GSC members to investigate the in
tricacies of funding procedures,
GSC co-chair Justin Brown ap
pointed Addy Satija and Adeel Arif
to head a committee looking to poll
student groups' financial officers
about their experiences with obtain
ing funding. This motion corre
sponds with questions that several
council members have raised about
the group's recommendations for
funding.
"I think we should be really open
to just saying, 'Hey, can we postpone
that until spring quarter? We're not
saying 'no' outright, but we're just
delaying the decision," said educa
tion representative Imeh Williams.
Williams questioned the validity
of funding for vaguely defined end
of-the-year events that are recom
mended for funding during the fall
quarter. While other council mem
bers shared his concerns, some sup
ported long-term planning by stu
dent groups.
"We do really want to encourage
people to come with us with annual
budgets," said Krystal St. Julien, a
graduate student in biochemistry.
