## Stanford invention to keep babies warm 
### KATHLEEN CHAYKOWSKI DESK EDITOR 
Embrace, a Stanford-grown San Fran
cisco social enterprise, has developed a
baby warmer designed to keep newborns
warm during the first few days of life.
This warmer is the first product devel
oped by Embrace co-founders Jane Chen
M.B.A: 'OB, Rahul Panicker 'O4 M.S. 'OB,
Naganand Murty M.S. 'OB and Linus
Liang M.S.'O9, who started the project to
gether as graduate students in Stanford's
Entrepreneurial Design for Extreme Af
fordability course.
The warmer is still in clinical trials and
will be released for the first time to the
market in early 2011 in India, where 40
percent of the world's low birth-weight
babies are born, before the product is re
leased internationally.
The warmer helps prevent the serious
consequences of lack of warmth, includ
ing increased risk of infection and the po
tential for organs to shut down, diabetes,
heart disease, low IQ and, in many cases,
death. Underweight or premature babies
are particularly susceptible to dying from
lack of warmth because they have less
body fat than other babies. Every year
about 4 million babies born premature or
underweight die during the first four
weeks of life.
Embrace's warmer is expected to cost
between $lOO and $2OO. Typical incuba
tors in developed countries can cost as
much as $20,000, and those in developing
countries can cost $l,OOO to $2,000.
The warmer consists of a nylon sleep
ing bag with an interior pouch for a wax
filled heating pad. The pad is filled with
phase-changing wax that melts at about
37 degrees Celsius human body tem
perature and remains at a constant
temperature for four to six hours, accord

ing to Raj an Patel 'O9, Embrace's fulltime
product design manager. It can be heated
with an electric heater or with warm
water.
A lack of seams on the inside of the
warmer facilitates sterilization and the
warmer features a flap at the baby's feet

that can be quickly opened to let nurses
check body temperature,
Panicker said mothers he has worked
with in the trials are often reluctant to
take the baby out of the warmer because
the device has enabled them to get unin
terrupted periods of rest for the first time

after a "fairly exhausting" delivery.
"Basically the babies sleep extremely
well like this," Panicker said. "It's like a
warm cocoon. They feel like they're in
their mother's womb."

A baby warmer developed by Embrace, a Stanford-born enterprise, is designed to keep newborns warm during their first few days of
life. The warmer, above in 2009, is currently in clinical trials and is expected to be released for the first time in India in early 2011.
While some entrepreneurs take
current products and strip them
down to make them more cost-effi
cient, Embrace takes a different ap
proach.
"We didn't just take existing incu
bators and cost-reduce," said CEO
Chen of Embrace's design process.
"We tried to think about the product
in an entirely different setting for
example, the needs of rural moth
ers."
The warmer first began as an in
clinic and transport device for doc
tors and nurses. However, observa
tion of the unmet needs of rural fam
ilies in Nepal led the team to tackle
developing a second, at-home model
for mothers in rural areas.
While the basics of the two warm
ers will be the same, the at-home pro
totype will be heated with warm
water instead of electricity, have
more built-in safety features to min
imize the potential for misuse, and
will be less expensive than its in-clin
ic counterpart.
Mothers in rural areas will some
times attempt to warm their babies

by wrapping them in blankets, sur
rounding them with warm water bot
tles, or placing them under light
bulbs. None are usually sufficient so
lutions, and the light bulbs some
times shatter over the babies.
The at-home version will also
have more wax in its warming pouch
so that constant temperatures can be
maintained for longer time periods,
in case of an emergency trip to the
hospital.
In addition to selling and renting
warmers to hospitals and families,
Embrace will likely cater to govern
ment and NGOs that train commu

nity health care workers, which have
both expressed interest in the prod
uct.

"Almost every day we get e-mails
from Africa or Asia and that they
have an NGO and that they're eager
to try the device," Patel said.
Embrace plans to use profit from
the baby warmer to help fund the
creation of a line of highly affordable
medical devices for rural areas and
the developing world. Chen said Em
brace is also considering moving into
a hybrid model with for-profit and
nonprofit components.
To Panicker, there is one simple

reason the warmer has made it this
far: the complete dedication of the
founders to stick with the project,
which has meant moving to different
countries and giving up higher-pay
ing jobs.
"The team was willing to quit
their jobs and move countries to do
this full time as opposed to, 'I think
I'll do this part time and see where
this goes,'" Panicker said. "Few glob
al issues are tackled through part
time effort."
