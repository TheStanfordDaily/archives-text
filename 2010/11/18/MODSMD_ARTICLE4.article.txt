## Stanford invention to keep babies warm 
### KATHLEEN CHAYKOWSKI DESK EDITOR 
Embrace, a Stanford-grown San Fran
cisco social enterprise, has developed a
baby warmer designed to keep newborns
warm during the first few days of life.
This warmer is the first product devel
oped by Embrace co-founders Jane Chen
M.B.A: 'OB, Rahul Panicker 'O4 M.S. 'OB,
Naganand Murty M.S. 'OB and Linus
Liang M.S.'O9, who started the project to
gether as graduate students in Stanford's
Entrepreneurial Design for Extreme Af
fordability course.
The warmer is still in clinical trials and
will be released for the first time to the
market in early 2011 in India, where 40
percent of the world's low birth-weight
babies are born, before the product is re
leased internationally.
The warmer helps prevent the serious
consequences of lack of warmth, includ
ing increased risk of infection and the po
tential for organs to shut down, diabetes,
heart disease, low IQ and, in many cases,
death. Underweight or premature babies
are particularly susceptible to dying from
lack of warmth because they have less
body fat than other babies. Every year
about 4 million babies born premature or
underweight die during the first four
weeks of life.
Embrace's warmer is expected to cost
between $lOO and $2OO. Typical incuba
tors in developed countries can cost as
much as $20,000, and those in developing
countries can cost $l,OOO to $2,000.
The warmer consists of a nylon sleep
ing bag with an interior pouch for a wax
filled heating pad. The pad is filled with
phase-changing wax that melts at about
37 degrees Celsius human body tem
perature and remains at a constant
temperature for four to six hours, accord

ing to Raj an Patel 'O9, Embrace's fulltime
product design manager. It can be heated
with an electric heater or with warm
water.
A lack of seams on the inside of the
warmer facilitates sterilization and the
warmer features a flap at the baby's feet

that can be quickly opened to let nurses
check body temperature,
Panicker said mothers he has worked
with in the trials are often reluctant to
take the baby out of the warmer because
the device has enabled them to get unin
terrupted periods of rest for the first time

after a "fairly exhausting" delivery.
"Basically the babies sleep extremely
well like this," Panicker said. "It's like a
warm cocoon. They feel like they're in
their mother's womb."

life. The warmer, above in 2009, is currently in clinical trials and is expected to be released for the first time in India in early 2011.
