## Harry Potter Accio Harry Potter movie number seven 
### MARWA FARAG 
When it comes to
tonight's midnight re
lease of part one of
"Harry Potter and the
Deathly Hallows," the
key word seems to be "excited."
Students across campus have been
preparing for the release, hyped by mar
keters as "the motion picture event of a gen
eration," by catching up on the past six
movies in the series or re-reading J.K. Rowl
ing's best-selling books.
"There has been a spike in the check-out
of Harry Potter movies in the past few days
... everything's out the door," said Jim
Kent, media microtext coordinator at
Green Library.
The Harry Potter movies have been the
highest grossing film series of all time since
the release of the first movie, "Harry Potter
and the Sorcerer's Stone," in 2001. College
age fans have identified with the characters
of the movie, Harry, Hermione and Ron,
who are now starting their final year at
Hogwarts.
"We kind of grew up with Harry Potter,
so we want to see the story all the way
through," said Issra Omer 'l4, in a view
echoed by Nardos Girma 'l4, who said, "It
looks like a very epic movie and we grew
up with it... we're the Harry Potter gen
eration."
But to some, the appeal that the series of
children's books holds to college students is
puzzling.
"I just don't understand why it's so pop
ular," said Ellen Enciso 'l4.
The plot of the film follows a trio of
friends skipping school to save the wizard
ing world by tracking down and destroying
"Horcruxes," magical objects that render
the evil Lord Voldemort immortal. If this
seems slightly childish, it is because its basis
is a children's book.
Megan Lerner'l4, however, believes that
the series transcends questions of age.
"You're never too old for Harry Potter,"
she said.
"Once I found out Harry Potter wasn't
real, I stopped liking it," countered Jason
Middleton 'l4.
"Wizardry is immoral, too," he added.
Last Friday, multitudes of students clad
in robes and sporting lightning bolts on their
foreheads flew their broomsticks to Cub
berley Auditorium for an advance screen

ing. The anticipation was palpable.
"I have been waiting for this since I was
eight years old," said Lindsey Wilder 'l4.
"I'm super, super, super pumped I
cannot wait!" added Morgan McCluskey
'l4, a member of the Stanford Quidditch
team.
"I've been looking forward to seeing
this movie for the past two years ... the
movies aren't as good as the books are, but
I always have hope they'll follow the spirit
of the books that I love so much," said Elena
Hurtado 'l4, an avid fan.
Many fans were dismayed by Warner
Bros.' decision to split the final book into
two movies, the second of which is slated for
release in July 2011.
"I don't see a reason for the seventh book
to be released in two parts except for the fact
that Warner Bros will be making money off
of it," lamented Kevin Hurlbutt 'l4.
Ginny Scholtes 'l3 disagreed.
"I think it's good that it was split up into
two ... for the seventh book; so many of the
details are necessary and couldn't have been
fit into one long movie well."
While the mystery surrounding where
the producers would choose to end the
first part has worried many fans, early re
views more or less commend the well
chosen ending.
Adam Thorne 'l4, who watched the ad
vanced screening, felt that the movie adap
tation did not stray too far from the book.
"It's awesome that we got to see it early.
I thought it followed the book extremely
well and it left off at a good spot. I also liked
how good-looking Hermione was in it."
The lure of romance in Harry Potter,
while secondary to the main plot, seems to
be a large factor that continues to attract
young adults.
"I definitely want to see the movie,"
said Kenneth Shields 'l4. "There's some
thing magical about it and you feel con
nected to it because it combines childhood
fantasies with teenage ambitions and hor
mones."
Stanford students all over the Farm are
gearing up to watch Harry Potter's war
against darkness, evil and normal teenage
behavior tonight. No matter their motives,
their enthusiasm is shared by many. Harry
Spitzer 'l2 summed it up well.
"This will be the greatest eff-ing movie of
all time," he said.
