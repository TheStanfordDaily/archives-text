# Ride Along
## One writer spends a Saturday night tagging along with Stanford's Department of Public Safety

£ L ~T"hy don't I take party
% A J car?" asks Officer Eric
% / % / Fenton of the Stanford
\l \J Department of Public
T Safety at the start of his
second overtime shift, on his day off.
Striding out into the brisk Saturday night,
he runs through a mental checklist of patrol car
procedure: check the lights, sound the siren,
scan the radio, stow the guns. At 10 p.m., he
drives out onto the road to begin patrolling
and heads in the direction of the all-campus
parties.
By day, he and his colleagues patrol traffic
safety and report stolen bikes, laptops and cell
phones, among other petty offenses. By night,
and especially on weekends such as today, they
frequently take on the role of campus babysit

ters. Fenton and other officers' roles come
after a year when liquor-law arrests on campus
nearly doubled, according to the 2009 campus
safety report.
Minutes after 10 p.m., Fenton spots a Ford
Explorer with a faulty brake light and radios in
that he'll be pulling it over within a few blocks.
Fie flips on the flashing lights. Dark silhouettes
in the SUV swivel in their seats to see the
source of the police lights, and there's a mo
ment of hesitation before they signal they're
pulling over.
Fenton focuses a bright beam of light on the
Explorer before opening his door and strolling
up to the car. A camera records his actions
through the windshield.
"How's everything going?" he asks. "Did
you know that you've got a brake light out?"
He learns that the vehicle belongs to one of
the intoxicated passengers that the driver of

fered to drop home safely. After running
her license, Fenton thanks the driver and
reminds her to have the owner fix the brake
light when he can.
Pulling into a parking lot, Fenton
opens a laptop in the cruiser. Reaching up
to turn on the red, night vision-sensitive light,
he squints at the screen left too bright by a day
shift officer. He carefully reports the informa
tion of his traffic stop on a special departmen
tal form buried deep in the files of the comput
er. Closing the netbook, he glances at his watch
and decides it's time to check on the happen
ings at Xanadu.
Cars drive cautiously and pedestrians
stare suspiciously as Fenton parks behind the
house. He exits the car and strides around to
the sidewalk in front of the waves of students
entering Xanadu. He peers at the entrance of
the party, checking that the hosts are requir
ing an SUID for entry. One such host in a wig
and trucker hat —in line with the party's
"Dekes of Hazzard" theme spots him and
stumbles over with a friend taking care not to
spill his beer.

"Is everything going all right, sir?" he asks.
"Everything's fine," Fenton answers. "Just
making sure you guys are checking for IDs, not
letting anybody in who could go upstairs and
steal some laptops or anything."
"Oh. Yes, sir. We're checking." He leans in
closer. "We've let a few slip by if they're really
cute, if you know what I mean, but I got two
boys posted on the stairs as well."
His friend, listening attentively, perks up.
"You called that one girl a whore!"
"Whoa. I've got nothing against women,"
he says, adjusting his wig. "My mother is a
woman. And she's an angel!"
Fenton laughs and decides to check out the
back of the party; his report could affect
Xanadu's ease and ability to throw parties in
the future. For the most part, he's satisfied, and
he gets a Powerbar from the trunk before start
ing the engine.
Spotting a fellow officer parked in an adja
cent lot he drives alongside and lowers his win
dow. They chat for a few minutes in police jar
gon with a jocular tone. The radio is a constant
hum in both cars: background noise which

both seem to ignore as they laugh together, yet
Fenton stops mid-sentence when a pertinent
call comes from dispatch.
Someone has pressed the help button on
one of the blue emergency towers on Mayfield.
Fenton heads in the direction of the tower
without finishing his description of the dilapi
dated handgun he'd offered to fix.
Upon arriving at the tower, Fenton finds no
one and rationalizes that it was a false alarm.
Fie marks it on the form on his laptop. Check
ing the time, he realizes he only has an hour left
of patrolling and heads back to the parties on
the Row.
More drunks approach him as he surveys
the party procedures.
"In Oklahoma, cops are out to get you,"
says one. "Y'all are cool here."
Pleased that the parties are following proto
col, Fenton asks if they need him to stay on any
longer, and at 1:45 a.m. on his day off, he's told
that he can head back to the station to unload the
patrol car and head home.
