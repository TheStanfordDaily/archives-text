### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€” Ivy Nguyen 
Retired art professor Nathan
Oliveira passed away Nov. 13 the age
of 81 from complications of pulmonary
fibrosis and diabetes.
According to an obituary in the
Stanford Report, Oliveira was born in
Oakland in 1928. the only child of a
poor Portuguese immigrant couple.
Oliveira earned his bachelor's de
gree in fine arts from Mills College in
1951 and a master's in fine arts the fol
lowing year from the California Col
lege of the Arts and Crafts in Oakland.
After a stint working at the Richmond

Art Center and San Francisco's Art In
stitute, he joined the Stanford faculty
in 1964, teaching painting and print
making until his retirement in 1995.
Over the years, Oliveira has won
numerous honors and awards, includ
ing awards from the American Acade
my and Institute of Arts and Letters
and an election to the American Acad
emy of Arts & Sciences. In an interview
with Stanford Magazine in 2002,
Oliveira said that of all of these honors,
he was most proud of receiving the de
gree of Commander in the Order of In
fante D. Henrique, given to him by the
president of Portugal to honor those
who have contributed to Portuguese
culture.
As an artist, Oliveira was most well
known for his contributions to the
Bay Area Figurative Movement,
though he has also done extensive
work in other areas, such as monotype
printing. His work is in the collections
of museums all over the world.
Hilarie Faberman, curator of mod
ern and contemporary art at Cantor
Arts Center, has worked closely over
the years with Oliveira to create sev
eral exhibitions featuring his work.
"He's really among the top two or
three most brilliant practitioners of
the monotype," Faberman said in the
2002 Stanford Magazine article. "If
anyone can conjure up secret worlds
out of paper and ink, it's Nate."
Associate director of Cantor Arts
Center Mona Duggan also sang
Oliveira's praises as a teacher. Many
students were drawn to Stanford be
cause of Oliveira, Duggan said.
"He was just as remarkable as a
professor as he was an artist," Duggan
told the Stanford Report.
The museum's history with
Oliveira goes far back; it has organ
ized several exhibitions of his work,
among them "To Edgar Allan Poe, a
suite of lithographs,"in 1971; "Nathan
Oliveira Recent Work," 1987; and
"Nathan Oliveira: The Windhover" in
1995, according to Duggan.
The museum also holds 51 of
Oliveira's works in its collection, ac
cording to curator for education Pa
tience Young. At least one of
Oliveira's works is always in display at
the museum, and those who frequent
the contemporary gallery will recog
nize his work entitled "Seated Man
With Blue Face and Red Hand."
"His passing is a loss for us all,"
Young said. "He was an important
artist, a memorable teacher, a great in
spiration to Stanford students and the
community, a kind, caring, gentle and
generous person."
A memorial is being planned for
Jan. 12, 2011 with details to be an
nounced later.
