Cover Up at Night
Close your blinds or drapes at night to keep out the cold.
Heat With the Sun
Open your blinds during the day to allow in the warmth.
Turn Down the Heat
When you're sleeping or away, turn down your
thermostat. Each degree saves 2% in heating energy.
Keep Windows Closed
Submit a Fixlt request for too much heat instead of
opening windows, so you don't heat the outdoors.
Do the same for drafty windows that leak unwanted
cold air. https://fixit.stanford.edu
Get Cozy
Put on a sweater and warm socks, grab a blanket,
and dry your hair before turning up the heat.
Use a Laptop Computer
They need 90% less energy than desktop computers.
Give Your Computer a Nap

using your computer turn off the monitor and shut it
down or put it in sleep mode.
