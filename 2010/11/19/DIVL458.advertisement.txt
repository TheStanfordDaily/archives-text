A Spiritual Masterpiece: The Gupta Period Buddha Image of India
Sculpture from the Gupta Period (4th- 6th century ce) of India is usually
considered the supreme aesthetic and spiritual accomplishment of Indian art
history. It is also during this period when a type of Buddha image was created
at Sarnath, where the Buddha gave his First Sermon, which is thought to have
changed the way the Buddha was imagined not only in India but throughout
the Buddhist world.
In this seminar, Robert L. Brown, Professor of Art History at UCLA will
explore the reasons why Gupta-period sculpture became so highly regarded by
modern viewers, and why the Sarnath Buddha image had such a profound
influence both inside and outside of India.
