# EYES ON THE AXE
## PRIDE AND MORE ON THE LINE

With the 113 th Big Game set for kickoff to
morrow, the stakes could not be higher for ei
ther team.
The No. 6 Stanford football team is experi
encing some of its greatest success in recent
memory. The Cardinal (9-1,6-1 Pac-10) has its
best record through 10 games in 59 years, and is
shooting for the program's first Rose Bowl ap
pearance since 2000. Stanford managed to sur
vive a scare on the road at Arizona State last
weekend, pulling off a 17-13 win despite a weak
rushing attack.
Across the Bay, California (5-5, 3-4) has
had a roller coaster ride of a season thus far.
The Golden Bears have been one of the na
tion's more puzzling teams, since they look
nearly unstoppable inside Strawberry Canyon
but utterly hapless away from it. Cal has won
every one of its home games by blowout mar
gins, except for last weekend's close 15-13 loss
to No. 1 Oregon.
Even then, the Bears managed to do what
no other team, including the Cardinal, could do:
slow down the Ducks and keep them from
rolling up video game-like numbers on offense.
Meanwhile, they have lost every road game ex
cept for a 20-13 victory at Washington State two
weeks ago.

NOTES ! Stanford has enjoyed a stronger season than
its biggest rival in 2010, but the Bears and the Car
dinal both have plenty on the line in tomorrow's Big
Game. Cal is looking to earn bowl eligibility with its
sixth win, while Stanford needs a victory to keep its
hopes alive for a berth in a BCS bowl game.
