# EYES ON THE AXE
## PRIDE AND MORE ON THE LINE 
### KABIR SAWHNEY MANAGING EDITOR 
With the 113 th Big Game set for kickoff to
morrow, the stakes could not be higher for ei
ther team.
The No. 6 Stanford football team is experi
encing some of its greatest success in recent
memory. The Cardinal (9-1,6-1 Pac-10) has its
best record through 10 games in 59 years, and is
shooting for the program's first Rose Bowl ap
pearance since 2000. Stanford managed to sur
vive a scare on the road at Arizona State last
weekend, pulling off a 17-13 win despite a weak
rushing attack.
Across the Bay, California (5-5, 3-4) has
had a roller coaster ride of a season thus far.
The Golden Bears have been one of the na
tion's more puzzling teams, since they look
nearly unstoppable inside Strawberry Canyon
but utterly hapless away from it. Cal has won
every one of its home games by blowout mar
gins, except for last weekend's close 15-13 loss
to No. 1 Oregon.
Even then, the Bears managed to do what
no other team, including the Cardinal, could do:
slow down the Ducks and keep them from
rolling up video game-like numbers on offense.
Meanwhile, they have lost every road game ex
cept for a 20-13 victory at Washington State two
weeks ago.

NOTES ! Stanford has enjoyed a stronger season than
its biggest rival in 2010, but the Bears and the Car
dinal both have plenty on the line in tomorrow's Big
Game. Cal is looking to earn bowl eligibility with its
sixth win, while Stanford needs a victory to keep its
hopes alive for a berth in a BCS bowl game.


This Big Game will have significant
bowl implications for both Stanford
and Cal.

The Cardinal still has hopes for an
invitation to a prestigious BCS bowl,
but would see those hopes extin
guished with a loss to Cal. Stanford's

best chance is to receive an at-large
berth, since the Pac-10's automatic
berth will go to Oregon if it wins the
conference. Officials from the Rose
Bowl were present at Stanford's last
home game against then-No. 15 Ari
zona, and Sugar Bowl representatives
made the trip to Tempe last weekend to
see the Card take on the Sun Devils.

With a win over Stanford, the Gold
en Bears will gain bowl eligibility and
be guaranteed another trip to the post
season. Cal could even get into one of

the bowls higher in the Pac-10's pecking
order due to the dearth of bowl-eligible
teams in the conference this season.

However, even if Cal falls to Stan
ford, it still has a strong chance to earn
bowl eligibility, with a home game
against Washington to close out its sea
son next weekend.

After its lackluster performance
last weekend, the focus will be square
ly on the Stanford offense to reach the
same level that it achieved against Ari
zona and Washington, when it scored

over 40 points in each game. Led by
redshirt sophomore quarterback An
drew Luck, the unit only mustered 17
points against the Sun Devils and com
mitted two turnovers, one on an inter
ception and the other on a Luck fum
ble.

Despite those miscues, Luck had
another strong game against the Ari
zona State secondary, throwing for 292
yards on 33-41 passing. He leads the
conference in passing efficiency with a
159.7 rating and in total yardage (run
ning and passing) with 288.4 yards per
game.
The biggest reason for Stanford's
struggles against ASU was its failure to
get its running game going early in the
contest. The Cardinal offense has re
lied on the run all season to set the pace
for the offense, utilizing the offensive
line to dominate at the line of scrim
mage and open up running lanes for
Stanford's talented rotation of tail
backs. Forcing opponents to respect
the run also opened up the passing at
tack for Luck and his receivers.
The Sun Devil front seven provided
a blueprint for stopping that dimension
of Stanford's offense, as linebacker
Vontaze Burfict and the rest of his unit
established control of the line of scrim
mage early in the game. Stanford soph
omore Stepfan Taylor, the featured
back in Stanford's offense, was severe
ly limited, going for only 39 yards on 16
carries. Overall, Stanford rushed 42
times for just 128 yards, a 3.0 yards-per
carry average.
That blueprint for stopping the
Card is certainly one that the Bears
could be capable of executing. Cal used
a similar game plan to limit Oregon,
and has a stud linebacker of its own in
Mike Mohamed, who is 10th in the
conference with 7.7 tackles per game.
Against Oregon, Cal did a good job of
stuffing the run, only giving up 162
yards on 55 carries, good for a measly
2.9 yards-per-carry average.The Bears'
defense has also been spectacular at
home; the highest point total it has sur
rendered in Memorial Stadium is 17, to
Arizona State, and it held three of its
five home foes (including Arizona) to
single-digit points.
However, Cal is vulnerable on of
fense after losing starting quarterback
Kevin Riley to injury for the season. In
two starts, backup Brock Mansion has
looked fairly underwhelming, throw
ing two picks in a 12-24,171-yard per
formance in his first outing against
lowly Washington State. Against the
Ducks, Mansion completed only 10 of
28 passes for 69 yards, and added -1
yards on two rushes.
The Golden Bears do have a re
spectable rushing attack, led by run
ning back Shane Vereen, who is aver
aging nearly 100 yards per game.
Vereen has 13 touchdowns on the sea
son and averages 5.2 yards per carry.
Stanford fans will likely remember
Vereen from last season's Big Game at
Stanford Stadium, when he gashed the
Cardinal for 193 yards on 42 carries
and scored three touchdowns, leading
the Bears to a 34-28 victory.
Stanford will need another strong
performance from a defensive unit that
has undergone a renaissance in recent
weeks. Since giving up 28 points to
Washington State on Oct. 23, the Car
dinal has shut out Washington and held
Arizona and Arizona State to 17 and 13
points, respectively. Though Stanford
has not looked as good on the stat
sheet, it has a propensity for making
key plays and momentum-killing stops
at critical points in the game.
The defense has also dominated op
posing offensive lines, especially with
the play of senior linebacker Owen
Marecic and sophomore linebacker
Shayne Skov.The defensive line, led by
redshirt junior Matt Masifilo, has also
done a strong job of engaging opposing
offensive lines and freeing up the line
backing corps to make plays.
With postseason hopes on the line
for both teams, Stanford will take on
Cal in the 113 th Big Game on Saturday
at 12:30 p.m. at Memorial Stadium in
Berkeley.
