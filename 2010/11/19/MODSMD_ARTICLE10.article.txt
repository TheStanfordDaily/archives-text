## Handing over summer to the humanities

"We had at that point a tiny pro
gram for undergraduate research op
portunities," she said. "We were com
ing upon the 100 th birthday of the
University."
The drive for undergraduate re
search funding became a big item in
the Centennial Campaign, Chappell-
Lougee said. "The first thing we de
cided was to put money under this
program in hopes it would contribute
to a change in undergraduate aca
demic culture."

Spending a summer in Paris
writing a novel sounds like
the premise of a romance
novel. Being paid to do it
sounds downright mythical.
Yet, one Stanford student has been
given the opportunity to do just this.
Others have gotten the chance to
study Hugo Chavez's social programs
in Venezuela and the relationship be-

tween the belief in reincarnation and
organ donations in Taiwan.
How? The Chappell-Lougee
scholarship, a grant sponsored by Un
dergraduate Advising and Research
for sophomores wishing to pursue in
dividually designed research projects
in the humanities, qualitative social
sciences or creative arts, gives accept
ed scholars up to $5,600 to pursue
their research.

The Chappell-Lougee scholarship
was named after the professor and
her father, Harold Chappell, to honor
her work as dean from 1982 to 1987
and to commemorate his life goal of
helping economically disadvantaged
students pursue higher education.
A unique perk of the Chappell-
Lougee scholarship is its focus on self
directed research, a motivating factor
for many sophomores who apply. De
vney Hamilton 'l3 described the
scholarship as "a really unique chance
to dive in that lets you learn by doing
it yourself." Hamilton will be submit

Students in the past have likewise
drawn on cultural experiences of their

projects. Miles Osgood 'll, a Chap

Paris drafting a novel about a college

used his Mongolian background to
translate works by Plato into Mongo

Travelling abroad, however, is not
a necessity for the scholarship. Past
projects have included a creative art
project inspired by a Native Ameri

study researching law and education
