## EDITORIAL The 						age of no privacy 
### 
In 1966, Associate Justice William Dou
glas presented the dissenting opinion in
Osborn v. United States, in which he ob
served, "We are rapidly entering the age of
no privacy."Today Douglas' words ring truer
than ever; with the rise of social networking
sites like Facebook and Twitter, people are
no longer living their lives in private, but
rather recording them and storing them on
these Web-based platforms. That data be
comes semi-public information. Even with
the most stringent privacy settings, the com
panies that maintain those websites also
maintain multiple copies of your pictures
and notes. Despite the lack of concern that
some people have for privacy, there are seri
ous implications for turning over so much
personal data to companies without under
standing how they use it.
Recently, Stanford began displaying stu
dents' room numbers by default on Stan
ford Who, the public, online campus directo
ry. The University did not notify students of
the change to default settings. We consider
this a serious violation of student privacy.
If you have used Stanford Who before,
you know that it is a useful service for find
ing e-mail addresses and phone numbers for
University affiliates. However, finding most

of this information does not require a
SUNet ID; it is available to anyone with an
Internet connection. A student's room num
ber will only disappear if the student opts
out by changing his or her privacy settings
via the Axess Student Center online.
The editorial board believes default ac
cess to such information should at least re
quire a modicum of security, such as a
SUNet ID.

Moreover, the board has failed to find a
compelling reason for this setting change.
While Stanford considers students' room
numbers as "directory" information under
the federal Family Educational Rights and
Privacy Act, this use of student information
is particularly troubling because it bridges
the gap between the virtual and physical
worlds, potentially endangering
students.The University allows students to
opt out to protect their personal informa
tion, but puts that option in Axess, which
tends to obfuscate what should be simple
tasks.

The University should seriously recon
sider this shift and it should make it easier
for students to control what personal infor
mation they would like to make public by
default.
