I just don't know what to do with this one. A
friend of mine last month came out of the
post office and was assaulted by a young
lady with a clipboard. Not unusual. The girl
wanted to talk about the legalization of mari
juana, which my friend supported, and she did
too, naturally. But her point in
clipboarding/campaigning/hailing down
strangers was not to spread the Word about
the Herb, but to make sure people knew how
to vote correctly on the proposition. She was
even collecting phone numbers to send out
text message reminders on election day: vote
no on 19,"because no means yes!" Some peo
ple were apparently very confused.
My friend gave her a fake phone number
(or possibly yours?), went home, looked this
up and was very upset. In case you don't
know, Prop. 19 was in favor of the legalization
of marijuana: the girl was lying. I'm a little sur
prised nobody's been arrested. But I'm more
surprised I can't find anything about this on
the Internet. Granted, it's not an easy search,
seeing as how there are (lots and lots of) peo
ple out there who think that either "smoking
marijuana does not cure cancer" or "the legal
ization of marijuana would not lead to the
apocalypse" is "misinformation."
But something this egregious should be
floating to the top of a "Prop. 19 Misinforma
tion No" query. This must've been a cam
paign. She just can't have been alone. Nobody
tries to affect an election on a vote-by-vote
level (talking to people individually) without
enlisting lots of help, even if the methodology
is crude fraud and sabotage. Actually, espe
cially in that case, because a good 10 to 30 per
cent of the people you lie to will at some point
realize you were lying.
The nerve! For an organization to even at
tempt something like this? It's a little scary to
think of how much they actually influenced
the election. Most of the people who would
vote yes aren't actually people who'd talk
about it, and wouldn't necessarily double
check if they thought they knew how they
were voting (nor trust the ballot if they'd been
emphatically cautioned by an attractive girl

with a clipboard that the way they wanted to
vote was actually counterintuitive). Has this
happened before? Where you weren't bullied
out of your vote, or you didn't care enough
not to inform yourself, but somebody was just
plain lying to you about the ballot?
This is completely different from the case
in which the voter's knowledge of the issue is
heavily and actively censored to the point
that he can't make an informed decision.
Everyone in this case can access the truth.
Everyone the girl talked to had easy access to
the truth. She wasn't about to stop them from
going home and looking online. She was just
handing them the lie, making the lie the easi
er thing and swaddling it in a social interac
tion.

That this was attempted, possibly success
fully, might be a sad indicator of the current
political culture of young people. Obama, et
cetera, has made voting cool, but "cool" as a
concept, as an abstract force, is a socially in
stantiated thing. If enough cool people say it's
cool, it's cool. It doesn't have to do with opti
mizing the good or moral principles. The
voter motivated by either of these forces
checks the website, looks up news clips or at
least reads the fucking proposition before
checking the box. The voter motivated by fear
just keeps his head down and does what he's
told. But a voter motivated by cool just wants
to feel like a part of something hip, young and
alive. And a friendly little text message on
Election Day, making sure you're someone in
the know, does just that.

Did this happen to you? Rosie wants to hear
about it! rcima@stan ford.edu
