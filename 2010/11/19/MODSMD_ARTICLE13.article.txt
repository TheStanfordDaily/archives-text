Keep Big Game respectful

Dear Editor,
On Nov. 20, Stanford and Cal will square
off in the 113 th annual Big Game at Califor
nia Memorial Stadium, an event that has
been a Bay Area tradition. Our two universi
ties share a strong football and academic her
itage, as well as a spirited and storied rivalry.
It is important that the traditional goal of
the Big Game be reinforced this year: a spir
ited competition on the field and an enjoy
able experience for those in the stands. Un
fortunately, in past years, the spirit of Big
Game has been damaged by the irresponsi
ble behavior of some that resulted in fracas
and property damage.
We again ask this year that you refrain
from engaging in "pranks" and other activ
ities that may draw law enforcement and
security personnel and resources away

from responding to more pressing matters.
We feel that those attending the Big Game
should not have to fear for their safety;
therefore, we must emphasize that fans who
engage in incidents of field trespass, physi
cal assault and/or property damage will be
ejected from the stadium. Students found
responsible for these types of activities will
face disciplinary action at their respective
institutions; such action may include sus
pension or dismissal.
Please respect more than a century of Big
Game tradition and celebrate your school
spirit, pride and sportsmanship in a safe, pos
itive and friendly manner. Enjoy the game!
With warm regards,

ROBERT J. BIRGENEAU
