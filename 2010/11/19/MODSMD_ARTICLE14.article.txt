# SENSE AND NONSENSE
## Masters of Our Fate 
### Aysha Bagchi 
President Hennessy ended his freshman
convocation speech this year with a
quote from William Ernest Henley's
1875 poem, "Invictus," which reads: "It matters
not how strait the gate. How charged with pun
ishments the scroll, I am the master of my fate:
I am the captain of my soul."
His message to students was that opportu
nities will surround us during our time at Stan
ford, but we are ultimately the masters of our
fates. It is for us to forge our paths and make
the most of our time here.

I was interested to hear a faculty member
object to President Hennessy's final words a
couple weeks ago, concerned, I think, with
sending a message to incoming students that
the University is solely an enabler, that it pro
vides the fuel to speed us along our present tra
jectories but not the detours and pit stops that
might expose alternative paths, increase our
awareness and deepen our current capacities.
The fear is that encouraging students to have a
very strong sense of personal autonomy when
it comes to our education contributes to stu
dent resentment to any type of requirements.
My immediate reaction was to think that
the "masters of our fate" ship has already
sailed (in fact, I'm thinking it's probably some
where near Antarctica right now). If ever a
president could be speaking to the choir, it is in
telling an incoming Stanford class made up so
predominately of enterprising students that
they are the masters of their fate.
And in some sense, this strong feeling of
personal autonomy that stems from students'
self-motivation is our biggest strength. Indeed,

real success is never merely the product of co
ercion; it springs from a personal drive to go
beyond what others demand of us, from think
ing of ourselves as agents who forge our own
futures. The accompanying resentment in
many students to paternalism in our education
is wrapped up in the drive behind the remark
able things that students do.
Nonetheless, there really are frightening
consequences to students adopting a blanket
attitude of resistance to any form of education
al paternalism. Our current system sometimes
fails to shift trajectories, deepen capacities and
open new windows in the ways students need
most. As a friend once pointed out to me, there
were lawyers in the Bush administration who
went through both undergraduate and gradu
ate educations at some of the most prestigious
universities in the country and yet did not be
lieve in evolution. I experienced my own sur
prise last year when I met a Stanford upper
classman who was majoring in biology and did
not believe in macroevolution.

It is often tempting to think that these obvi
ous failures in cultivating an earnest scientific
approach to the world are the fault of educa
tion requirements (if only she'd been taught
the scientific method, or been given a class on
evolution, then she would understand!). For
students who remain sympathetic to their
classes, requirements help. But they achieve
the least with just those students in whom we
hope they would achieve the most. They in
crease the resentment that impairs deep learn
ing and give students a chance to illustrate all
the innovative ways in which we can meet re-

quirements without meeting their aims.
For better and for worse, we students tend
to think of ourselves as masters of our fate. In
this context, the University's goal should be to
turn us into adventurers. To do that, students
need to be guided into new waters, but also to
appreciate the value in venturing afar and to
know that sharks (i.e. bad grades) will not eat
us on the way. Most importantly, we need a
genuine thirst for new horizons. And there is
little chance of instilling that in us if we are
chained and rowing below deck.
