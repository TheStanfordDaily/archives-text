## Why does Vaden always ask if I'm pregnant? 
### JESSICA TSAI, BRYAN CHEN ZACK WETTSTEIN Vaden Student Advisory Committee 
Have you ever wondered how Vaden
Health Center gets feedback from stu
dents? Or how you can provide input
on services and new directions you'd like to see
implemented at Vaden? That's why we're here.

We are members of the Vaden Student Ad
visory Committee, an ASSU-appointed com
mittee that has been charged to serve as a well
informed link between Vaden and the student
body, providing advice to the director of the
Vaden Health Center. The committee provides
feedback on Vaden's services and programs,
suggests new directions to ensure alignment
with students' core values and needs and works
to educate and inform the student body about
Vaden services and programs. In short, our goal
is to improve health care for students on cam
pus and ensure that student feedback is relayed
directly to Vaden.
The Vaden Student Advisory Committee
consists of three undergraduate students, three
graduate students, Vaden staff members and
the Vaden director. Current projects of the
committee include improving bike safety
through a coordinated effort with other on
campus organizations, increasing awareness of
mental health issues and resources on campus
and improving communication between Vaden
and the student body.
The three of us are writing on behalf of the
committee to provide answers to commonly
asked questions by the student body about
Vaden.
Have you ever wondered ...

Why do they always ask me if I'm pregnant?
We can see how this could be an odd ques
tion if you're coming in because of a bike acci

dent, but it's actually a standard question when
providing comprehensive, primary medical
care to ask all women of child-bearing years the
date of their last menstrual period at the begin
ning of the visit.
1) Regular menstruation is an indicator of
good health, just like having normal blood pres
sure (which the clinicians also check at each
visit). Many women skip periods because they
are stressed, over-exercise or have poor nutri
tion, which is detrimental to their health. The
providers at Vaden pick up on this at a routine
visit because they inquire about their last men
strual period in an effort to encourage a healthy
lifestyle.
2) If the clinicians are going to prescribe
medication or take an x-ray, they are obligated
to ask if there is any chance of pregnancy, as
there can be potential harm to a baby from
these procedures.
3) Women often come in because of missed
periods, and it would be an obvious oversight if
the provider didn't inquire about a possible
pregnancy as the cause.
Can I form an on-going relationship with a doc
tor at Vaden?
Yes! Clinicians really enjoy when students
develop an ongoing relationship with them.
They love to educate students about their
health, help students through illnesses and
challenges and ultimately celebrate their suc
cess. It is especially important if they have an
ongoing or chronic medical condition to have
the continuity of seeing the same provider,
rather than starting over with a new provider at
each visit. Of course there may be times when a
student is injured or ill and needs to see a doc-

tor right away. In that case, it is fine to see any
available clinician. Since Vaden is equipped to
handle electronic medical records, it's easy for
clinicians to stay up-to-date with a student's
records.
Why do I need insurance if I've already paid the
Health Fee?
Insurance is needed for those rare, unpre
dictable situations in which you need care out
side of Vaden. It's a safety net that we all appre
ciate when we need it, even though we don't
often do.
The Campus Health Service Fee of $167 is
charged quarterly to your account and allows
students to come to Vaden for primary care
services at no cost. The fee covers visits with cli
nicians and any labs or x-rays that are ordered.
Your insurance is billed if you need specialty
care, in which case you would be referred to the
Stanford Hospital & Clinics, or if you do not go
to Vaden for primary care services (and instead
go on your own to a contracted provider within
your insurance plan).
Did you know?
1) Vaden medical services handle more than
40,000 outpatient visits per year.
2) More than 1,780 flu shots have been given
for free to the Stanford community this year
alone. Have you gotten yours? If not, there's
still time to get one. For schedules, visit: flu.stan
ford.edu.
