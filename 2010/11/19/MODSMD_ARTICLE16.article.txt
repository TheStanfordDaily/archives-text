## Students lead effort for farm workers Group solicits signatures at Trader Joe's 
### CASSANDRA FELICIANO DESK EDITOR 
Six members of the Stanford Farm
Project (SFP) in Hawaiian-themed
shirts braved the cold outside Trader
Joe's in Palo Alto yesterday, asking
shoppers to join the fight for farm
workers in Florida with the tagline,
"When was the last time you got a
raise?" The farm workers they intend
ed to help haven't received one in 30
years.

The canvassing event was a joint
effort by Stanford Labor Action
Coalition (SLAC) and SFP, students
groups dedicated to supporting work
ers' rights and the development of fair
and sustainable food systems, respec
tively. Daniel Murray, a third-year
graduate student in modern thought
and literature and a member of both
groups, coordinated the event.
Murray and the group solicited sig
natures from shoppers for a petition
addressed to the manager of Trader
Joe's their contribution to the first
National Supermarket Week of Ac
tion. The Coalition of Immokalee
Workers (CIW) and the
Student/Farmworker Alliance (SFA),
a national network of youth based in
Florida, led the week-long, nation
wide event, which ends on Sunday.
"Many farm workers are denied
safe, healthy working conditions, are
paid poverty wages, suffer intimida
tion and in some cases are victims of
modern-day slavery," Murray said.
Stanford's letter urged Trader
Joe's to join forces with CIW, a farm
worker organization based in
Immokalee, Fla., as part of a land
mark agreement to extend ClW's
"fair food principles" to 90 percent of
the state's tomato farm workers. The
partnership would aim to ensure that
workers earn minimum wage.
According to the letter, the tomato
farm workers, who produce 95 per
cent of the country's tomatoes, are
paid 50 cents for every 32 pounds, a
level that has remained the same
since 1980. At this rate, a worker must
pick more than 2.25 tons of tomatoes
to reach the equivalent of the mini

mum wage in a typical 10-hour work
day.

The groups allege workers are also
often denied a number of workers'
rights, including overtime pay, health
insurance, sick leave, paid vacations,
pension and the ability to form unions
to improve working conditions.
The choice by SFP to canvass at
Trader Joe's CIW is also targeting
Publix, Ahold, Kroger and WalMart
is motivated by a sense of duty as
well as its close proximity to campus.
"As students who shop at Trader
Joe's and as Trader Joe's is part of our
community, we feel that we have a re
sponsibility to struggle in solidarity
with these farm workers to ensure
that Trader Joe's continues to im
prove their sustainability and labor
standards," Murray said, adding that
the success would result in a formal
agreement on Trader Joe's part to
"guarantee that they will be buying
from farms that agree with the fair
food policy."
Murray said Trader Joe's is reluc
tant to sign what would be a landmark
agreement because it already buys
from growers who meet those condi
tions. But SFP and SLAC remain es
pecially skeptical, Murray said, be
cause Trader Joe's officials are silent
on the exact details of where they get

their produce.
The canvassers stayed for an hour
and at the end of the night had a col
lection of at least 50 signatures. Mur
ray also coordinated a canvassing ef
fort last Sunday, for which three stu
dents showed up.
"It's good to test the waters, to fig
ure out what we're doing," Murray
said. "It's tough this time of year. A lot
of students are freaking out about
classes."
Within five minutes of their can
vassing Thursday night, the Trader
Joe's store manager asked them to
move away from the front of the store.
The manager said the Town and
Country Village, where Trader Joe's is
located, has a "designated zone" for
such activities as canvassing.

But the canvassers remained un
deterred.

"Though our action was small,
when combined with all of the actions
happening around the country this
week, the impact is much greater and
our voices are much louder," Murray
said. "We hope that Trader Joe's will
listen, but if they won't this time, we
will be back out there, and we will be
stronger."
