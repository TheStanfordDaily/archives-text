## PLAYOFF REMATCH FOR CARD, BRUINS 
### NATE ADAMS DESK EDITOR 
If there's one thing to be said about the Car
dinal's early success in the 2010 playoffs, it's that
all the big moments have involved the team's tal
ented youth. In their first two do-or-die contests
last weekend, the Pac-10 champions enjoyed
game-winning goals from freshman forward
Sydney Payne and sophomore defender Alina
Garciamendez, who combined for a relatively
low nine goals on the entire season. Out of the
five total goals scored in those games, none have
come from national goals leader Christen Press
and two have been from first-time scorers on the
collegiate level.
Regardless of where it comes from, the No. 1
Cardinal (20-0-2) will look to continue its win
ning ways tonight when it hosts UCLA (13-7-2)
in the round of 16.
Stanford head coach Paul Ratcliffe, who re
cently received his third consecutive Pac-10
coach of the year honor, said he isn't concerned
with the minor shift in goal production.
"I'm not surprised about [our young play
ers]," he said. "I think this is totally normal, and
the great thing is that Christen is still playing
fantastic soccer. But other people are stepping
up and being able to score, and as long as the
team keeps winning, it's not an issue at all. I
think it's great to see the younger players
emerging and making a big impact, I think it's
going to be harder for the other teams to match
up with us."
Stanford has made use of its talent on the
bench throughout the season, and Ratcliffe
says there's plenty of reason for that to contin
ue even deep into the single-elimination tour
nament.
"I'm looking at the quality right now of the
training sessions, and who's looking sharp," he
said. "A lot of the younger players are really
starting to emerge and impress me, so I wouldn't
be surprised to see them getting minutes this
weekend and making a huge impact."
There's no doubt, though, that the Cardinal's
go-to scorer this season has been Press. With 23
goals and seven assists, she's averaging more

than two points per game. But the senior for
ward hasn't found the back of the net in her
team's last three contests not a particularly
long drought, but a notable one given her usual
pace of production.
"It's not discouraging for me," Press said, "be
cause I hope that even if my role is just to pull de
fenders away, if I'm able to do that and open up
channels for other people, then I can definitely
try to consider that productive. But at the same
time, there were obviously opportunities where
I could've scored, so, you know, I'm always try
ing to get better."
For her phenomenal regular season, Press
was named the Top Drawer player of the year
earlier this week. She earned a share of the
award last season alongside former teammate
Kelley O'Hara, and is the first player to earn the
award in consecutive years. The national scoring
leader in 2010, Press also broke Stanford records
in career goals (68) and points (176) this season,
and tied is tied for the mark in assists (40).
In case she needed any, Press may find some
added inspiration to continue finding the net
when her team faces the Bruins. In a heated
match in the national semifinals last season,
Press played the hero with a golden goal three
minutes and 25 seconds into overtime.
The Bruins were a dominant team in 2009,
competing down to the wire for the Pac-10 title
and going 21-2-1 before Stanford knocked them
out of the national tournament. Though
UCLA's record isn't quite as impressive this sea
son, they've earned notable victories in the
NCAAs so far. After sneaking past BYU on
penalty kicks, the Bruins earned a 2-1 victory
over fourth-seeded UCF to advance to the
round of 16.
"I think UCLA is a fantastic team," Ratcliffe
said. "Any team that can get to the Sweet 16 has
proven, with this year's team, I mean, that
they're a really strong opponent. I think it's
going to be a challenging match."
Stanford faces the Bruins tonight at 7 p.m. at
Laird Q. Cagan Stadium.The winner will face ei
ther Marquette or Florida State next weekend.

She may have yet to score in the playoffs, but Christen Press, above, has been an offensive
machine this season. The senior forward leads the nation with 23 goals scored in 2010 alone.
