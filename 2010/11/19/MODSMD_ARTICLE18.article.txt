# Strong start continues over Virginia
## 
### ZACH ZIMMERMAN DESK EDITOR 
While stingy defense was enough to earn a
season-opening win against San Diego, the
Stanford men's basketball team knew it would
take a much-improved offensive effort to de
feat a tough nonconference opponent.
The Cardinal responded by unleashing its
arsenal of three-point shooters against Virginia
on Thursday night, winning 81-60 in a game
that saw a combined 47 attempts from outside
the arc.

Stanford (2-0) was led by junior guard Jere
my Green, who overcame a disastrous season
opener against San Diego by scoring 21 points,
a mark that led five Cardinal players in double
figures. Green was 8-for-13 from the floor, in
cluding 5-for-9 from deep.
"I feel like tonight I was just a little more pa
tient and let the game come to me," Green said.
"My teammates stepped up and helped me
through it."
"He's a three-point specialist," added Stan
ford head coach Johnny Dawkins.
Freshman guard Aaron Bright was also
solid from distance, making all four of his
three-point attempts to finish with 12 points. In
just his second collegiate game, Bright was vis
ibly more comfortable and confident than in
his debut.

"I've always had confidence in myself,"
Bright said. "It definitely felt good though, I'm
not going to lie. It feels good to have that barri

er lifted."
Junior forward Andrew Zimmerman and
freshman forward Anthony Brown hit two
triples apiece for Stanford, which finished the
day 13-for-23 beyond the arc.
However, it was not always easy going for
the Card, which took its time finding an offen
sive rhythm.
Stanford started the game in an offensive
funk, forcing Green to take the scoring load
upon his shoulders. With limited off-ball move
ment and off-balance jumpers, the Cardinal fell
into a 13-7 hole just six minutes after tipoff.
Virginia (2-1) came out firing from the
perimeter, beginning with two straight shots
from distance by senior guard Mustapha Far
rakhan and freshman guard Joe Harris. The
Cardinal was slow in switching off of screens,
yielding open looks from the perimeter with
Virginia's quick passing around the arc.
"Give Virginia a lot of credit. They shot
lights out," Dawkins said. "Sixty percent from
twos, 55 percent from the three-point line
they were really executing very well."
However, the Cavaliers failed to capitalize
on Stanford's sluggish start and kept the Card
in the game by committing several turnovers in
succession. At one point, Virginia head coach
Tony Bennett was left shaking his head after
his team committed its fifth travel of the half.

After a somewhat shaky performance in his debut, freshman guard Andrew Bright, above,
delivered in a big way against Virginia, going 3 for 3 from beyond the arc.
with 10 points in the first period, in
cluding a string of three-pointers
and off-balance jumpers.
Bright also joined the distance
party, hitting three triples of his own
in the opening period including a
tie-breaking three in transition as
time expired —to finish the half
with nine points. Bright served as
the team's primary ball handler for
the majority of the half, with Stan
ford head coach Jonny Dawkins
electing to play turnover-prone jun
ior guard Jarrett Mann off the ball.
Stanford entered the break lead
ing 37-34, overcoming an impres
sive 60 percent first-half shooting
performance by the Cavaliers with a
57.7 percent rate of its own.
The Cardinal's offensive momen
tum carried over into the start of the
second half with a quick 5-0 run be
hind two buckets and a free throw
from junior forward Josh Owens,
who was limited in the first half after
picking up two quick fouls.
A Bennett timeout sparked the
Cavaliers as Harris hit three
straight attempts from beyond the
arc and single-handedly brought his
team back within a point.

Stanford responded once again,
this time with freshman forward
Anthony Brown. Brown sank two
threes from opposite wings in suc
cession, sending Maples Pavilion
into a frenzy and giving the Cardi
nal an eight-point lead.
Dawkins was again pleased, but
cautiously optimistic with the per
formance of Brown, Bright and the
rest of the freshman class.

"It's a process," Dawkins said.
"Both kids gave us a big lift off the
bench. These kids are freshmen, and
they are going to have their ups and
downs. I'm glad they had their ups
tonight. If they continue to work as
hard as they've been working, they'll
continue to see improvement.
The three-point barrage contin
ued for Stanford, as Bright, Zim
mermann and Green each took
turns hitting from range. Powell
tacked on a hard-earned layup to
extend the lead to 64-50.

Zimmermann followed by doing
his best Leßron James impression,
thunderously blocking a layup at
tempt from behind, which led into a
transition bucket for Brown. A Har
ris miss at the other end was re
bounded by Brown, who went
coast-to-coast for a layup plus the
foul, extending Stanford's lead to
69-50 and putting the game effec
tively out of reach.
The second half was highlighted

by an 18-3 run by Stanford that saw
all 18 points come as a result of
three-pointers.
Farrakhan led the way for Vir
ginia with 14 points, but did so on 4-
for-10 shooting. The Cavaliers were
unable to bounce back as glimpses
of momentum were instantly shut
down by 18 total turnovers. The
Cardinal's perimeter defense im
proved dramatically as the game
wore on, with Virginia shooting just
29.6 percent from the floor in the
second half.
Bright said Green played a big
role in the team's defensive resur
gence.
"They were shooting really well
in the first half," Bright said.
"[Green] got on all of us for de
fense."
The Cardinal has now forced 38
turnovers in just two games, and al
though it's still early, the team looks
like a force to be reckoned with on
both ends of the floor.

Stanford will suit up next against
Arkansas Pine-Bluff. The Sunday
game at Maples will end the Card's
three-game homestand before the
team embarks on a trip to Anaheim
for the 76 Classic.
Tipoff for this Sunday's game is
scheduled for 5 p.m.

coast-to-coast for a layup plus the

69-50 and putting the game effec
tively out of reach.
The second half was highlighted

by an 18-3 run by Stanford that saw
all 18 points come as a result of
three-pointers.
Farrakhan led the way for Vir
ginia with 14 points, but did so on 4-

down by 18 total turnovers. The
Cardinal's perimeter defense im
proved dramatically as the game
wore on, with Virginia shooting just
29.6 percent from the floor in the
second half.
Bright said Green played a big
role in the team's defensive resur

"They were shooting really well
in the first half," Bright said.
"[Green] got on all of us for de
fense."
The Cardinal has now forced 38
turnovers in just two games, and al
though it's still early, the team looks
like a force to be reckoned with on
both ends of the floor.

Stanford will suit up next against
Arkansas Pine-Bluff. The Sunday
game at Maples will end the Card's
three-game homestand before the
team embarks on a trip to Anaheim
for the 76 Classic.

While stingy defense was enough to earn a
season-opening win against San Diego, the
Stanford men's basketball team knew it would
take a much-improved offensive effort to de
feat a tough nonconference opponent.
The Cardinal responded by unleashing its
arsenal of three-point shooters against Virginia
on Thursday night, winning 81-60 in a game
that saw a combined 47 attempts from outside
the arc.

Stanford (2-0) was led by junior guard Jere
my Green, who overcame a disastrous season
opener against San Diego by scoring 21 points,
a mark that led five Cardinal players in double
figures. Green was 8-for-13 from the floor, in
cluding 5-for-9 from deep.
"I feel like tonight I was just a little more pa
tient and let the game come to me," Green said.
"My teammates stepped up and helped me
through it."
"He's a three-point specialist," added Stan
ford head coach Johnny Dawkins.
Freshman guard Aaron Bright was also
solid from distance, making all four of his
three-point attempts to finish with 12 points. In
just his second collegiate game, Bright was vis
ibly more comfortable and confident than in
his debut.

"I've always had confidence in myself,"
Bright said. "It definitely felt good though, I'm
not going to lie. It feels good to have that barri

er lifted."
Junior forward Andrew Zimmerman and
freshman forward Anthony Brown hit two
triples apiece for Stanford, which finished the
day 13-for-23 beyond the arc.
However, it was not always easy going for
the Card, which took its time finding an offen
sive rhythm.
Stanford started the game in an offensive
funk, forcing Green to take the scoring load
upon his shoulders. With limited off-ball move
ment and off-balance jumpers, the Cardinal fell
into a 13-7 hole just six minutes after tipoff.
Virginia (2-1) came out firing from the
perimeter, beginning with two straight shots
from distance by senior guard Mustapha Far
rakhan and freshman guard Joe Harris. The
Cardinal was slow in switching off of screens,
yielding open looks from the perimeter with
Virginia's quick passing around the arc.
"Give Virginia a lot of credit. They shot
lights out," Dawkins said. "Sixty percent from
twos, 55 percent from the three-point line
they were really executing very well."
However, the Cavaliers failed to capitalize
on Stanford's sluggish start and kept the Card
in the game by committing several turnovers in
succession. At one point, Virginia head coach
Tony Bennett was left shaking his head after
his team committed its fifth travel of the half.

After a somewhat shaky performance in his debut, freshman guard Andrew Bright, above,
delivered in a big way against Virginia, going 3 for 3 from beyond the arc.
with 10 points in the first period, in
cluding a string of three-pointers
and off-balance jumpers.
Bright also joined the distance
party, hitting three triples of his own
in the opening period including a
tie-breaking three in transition as
time expired —to finish the half
with nine points. Bright served as
the team's primary ball handler for
the majority of the half, with Stan
ford head coach Jonny Dawkins
electing to play turnover-prone jun
ior guard Jarrett Mann off the ball.
Stanford entered the break lead
ing 37-34, overcoming an impres
sive 60 percent first-half shooting
performance by the Cavaliers with a
57.7 percent rate of its own.
The Cardinal's offensive momen
tum carried over into the start of the
second half with a quick 5-0 run be
hind two buckets and a free throw
from junior forward Josh Owens,
who was limited in the first half after
picking up two quick fouls.
A Bennett timeout sparked the
Cavaliers as Harris hit three
straight attempts from beyond the
arc and single-handedly brought his
team back within a point.

Stanford responded once again,
this time with freshman forward
Anthony Brown. Brown sank two
threes from opposite wings in suc
cession, sending Maples Pavilion
into a frenzy and giving the Cardi
nal an eight-point lead.
Dawkins was again pleased, but
cautiously optimistic with the per
formance of Brown, Bright and the
rest of the freshman class.

"It's a process," Dawkins said.
"Both kids gave us a big lift off the
bench. These kids are freshmen, and
they are going to have their ups and
downs. I'm glad they had their ups
tonight. If they continue to work as
hard as they've been working, they'll
continue to see improvement.
The three-point barrage contin
ued for Stanford, as Bright, Zim
mermann and Green each took
turns hitting from range. Powell
tacked on a hard-earned layup to
extend the lead to 64-50.

Zimmermann followed by doing
his best Leßron James impression,
thunderously blocking a layup at
tempt from behind, which led into a
transition bucket for Brown. A Har
ris miss at the other end was re
bounded by Brown, who went
coast-to-coast for a layup plus the
foul, extending Stanford's lead to
69-50 and putting the game effec
tively out of reach.
