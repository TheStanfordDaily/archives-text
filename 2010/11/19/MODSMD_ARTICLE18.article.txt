# Strong start continues over Virginia
## 
### ZACH ZIMMERMAN DESK EDITOR 
While stingy defense was enough to earn a
season-opening win against San Diego, the
Stanford men's basketball team knew it would
take a much-improved offensive effort to de
feat a tough nonconference opponent.
The Cardinal responded by unleashing its
arsenal of three-point shooters against Virginia
on Thursday night, winning 81-60 in a game
that saw a combined 47 attempts from outside
the arc.

Stanford (2-0) was led by junior guard Jere
my Green, who overcame a disastrous season
opener against San Diego by scoring 21 points,
a mark that led five Cardinal players in double
figures. Green was 8-for-13 from the floor, in
cluding 5-for-9 from deep.
"I feel like tonight I was just a little more pa
tient and let the game come to me," Green said.
"My teammates stepped up and helped me
through it."
"He's a three-point specialist," added Stan
ford head coach Johnny Dawkins.
Freshman guard Aaron Bright was also
solid from distance, making all four of his
three-point attempts to finish with 12 points. In
just his second collegiate game, Bright was vis
ibly more comfortable and confident than in
his debut.

"I've always had confidence in myself,"
Bright said. "It definitely felt good though, I'm
not going to lie. It feels good to have that barri

er lifted."
Junior forward Andrew Zimmerman and
freshman forward Anthony Brown hit two
triples apiece for Stanford, which finished the
day 13-for-23 beyond the arc.
However, it was not always easy going for
the Card, which took its time finding an offen
sive rhythm.
Stanford started the game in an offensive
funk, forcing Green to take the scoring load
upon his shoulders. With limited off-ball move
ment and off-balance jumpers, the Cardinal fell
into a 13-7 hole just six minutes after tipoff.
Virginia (2-1) came out firing from the
perimeter, beginning with two straight shots
from distance by senior guard Mustapha Far
rakhan and freshman guard Joe Harris. The
Cardinal was slow in switching off of screens,
yielding open looks from the perimeter with
Virginia's quick passing around the arc.
"Give Virginia a lot of credit. They shot
lights out," Dawkins said. "Sixty percent from
twos, 55 percent from the three-point line
they were really executing very well."
However, the Cavaliers failed to capitalize
on Stanford's sluggish start and kept the Card
in the game by committing several turnovers in
succession. At one point, Virginia head coach
Tony Bennett was left shaking his head after
his team committed its fifth travel of the half.
