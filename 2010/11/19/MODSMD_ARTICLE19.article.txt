						Big Game history lesson

### Tom Taylor 
In its 113-year history, there has
always been far more at stake
between cross-Bay rivals Stan
ford and California than just a
wood chopping tool, but per
haps this year's Big Game could be a
critical one.
Looking back at the history of the
112 games between the two, there
have been some pretty important en
counters, from the first ever game in
1892 to the return to normality after
the Second World War.
Over this time, the whole
pageantry and lore of the rivalry also
grew step by step. The Axe first ap
peared in 1899, but after being stolen
by California for 31 years and subse
quently recovered by Stanford, it
wasn't until 1933 that it became the
official trophy of the Big Game. Oski
made his first appearance in 1941,
and, after Stanford dropped its origi
nal mascot in 1972, the Leland Stan
ford Junior University Marching
Band (LSJUMB) debuted the Tree in
1975.
After breaking from its saner
roots, the LSJUMB also caused one
of the most bizarre upsets at the end
of a football game, now infamously
known as "The Play," in 1982. Rush
ing the field in celebration of a Cardi
nal victory a few seconds too early,
they allowed Cal to score a game
winning touchdown amid the confu
sion.
But, apart from historical curiosi
ty, none of those necessarily hold spe
cial significance for the football
teams, at least in the only thing that
should really matter to them: success.
To look for those games, we need
to consider the relative form of the
two sides in the eras the games were
played, and see what the effect of
wins, or losses, were. Basically, look
for the games that were crucial turn
ing points in the teams' success.
In the 19205, Cal was on a high, not
dropping a single game in a five-year
streak that saw it win the 1921 Rose
Bowl. Stanford, meanwhile, strug
gled, scoring just seven points against
the Bears from 1920 to 1923, and by
1924, California had defeated the
Cardinal in five straight games.
But that year marked the begin
ning of Glenn "Pop" Warner's tenure
as Stanford coach, and his arrival se
cured both equality in the Big Game
(a 20-20 tie) and the Pac-10 title. It
also marked the beginning of the end
for Cal's dominance. Head coach
Andy Smith signed off the next year
with a loss, and his next two succes
sors did not come close to his record.
When Stub Allison came to
Berkeley in 1935, Cal had won just
once in the last 10 years. A hugely im
proved first season was marred by
just one loss, 13-0 to Stanford, but
turning this around in 1936, the Card
would not score a single point against
Cal for three years, years in which
Berkeley won two Rose Bowls.
Claude E. Thornhill's Stanford swift
ly went from winning the 1936 Rose
Bowl to mediocrity.
Clark Shaughnessy quickly enact
ed revenge in his very short period,
just two years, in charge at the Farm.
As Allison's team began to falter,
Shaughnessy set out on a formidable
10-0 Rose Bowl-winning 1940 sea
son.
For the next 30 years, the Cardinal
returned to relative obscurity, and
