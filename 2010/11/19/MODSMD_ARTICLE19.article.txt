# A 						Big Game history lesson
## 
### Tom Taylor 
In its 113-year history, there has
always been far more at stake
between cross-Bay rivals Stan
ford and California than just a
wood chopping tool, but per
haps this year's Big Game could be a
critical one.
Looking back at the history of the
112 games between the two, there
have been some pretty important en
counters, from the first ever game in
1892 to the return to normality after
the Second World War.
Over this time, the whole
pageantry and lore of the rivalry also
grew step by step. The Axe first ap
peared in 1899, but after being stolen
by California for 31 years and subse
quently recovered by Stanford, it
wasn't until 1933 that it became the
official trophy of the Big Game. Oski
made his first appearance in 1941,
and, after Stanford dropped its origi
nal mascot in 1972, the Leland Stan
ford Junior University Marching
Band (LSJUMB) debuted the Tree in
1975.
After breaking from its saner
roots, the LSJUMB also caused one
of the most bizarre upsets at the end
of a football game, now infamously
known as "The Play," in 1982. Rush
ing the field in celebration of a Cardi
nal victory a few seconds too early,
they allowed Cal to score a game
winning touchdown amid the confu
sion.
But, apart from historical curiosi
ty, none of those necessarily hold spe
cial significance for the football
teams, at least in the only thing that
should really matter to them: success.
To look for those games, we need
to consider the relative form of the
two sides in the eras the games were
played, and see what the effect of
wins, or losses, were. Basically, look
for the games that were crucial turn
ing points in the teams' success.
In the 19205, Cal was on a high, not
dropping a single game in a five-year
streak that saw it win the 1921 Rose
Bowl. Stanford, meanwhile, strug
gled, scoring just seven points against
the Bears from 1920 to 1923, and by
1924, California had defeated the
Cardinal in five straight games.
But that year marked the begin
ning of Glenn "Pop" Warner's tenure
as Stanford coach, and his arrival se
cured both equality in the Big Game
(a 20-20 tie) and the Pac-10 title. It
also marked the beginning of the end
for Cal's dominance. Head coach
Andy Smith signed off the next year
with a loss, and his next two succes
sors did not come close to his record.
When Stub Allison came to
Berkeley in 1935, Cal had won just
once in the last 10 years. A hugely im
proved first season was marred by
just one loss, 13-0 to Stanford, but
turning this around in 1936, the Card
would not score a single point against
Cal for three years, years in which
Berkeley won two Rose Bowls.
Claude E. Thornhill's Stanford swift
ly went from winning the 1936 Rose
Bowl to mediocrity.
Clark Shaughnessy quickly enact
ed revenge in his very short period,
just two years, in charge at the Farm.
As Allison's team began to falter,
Shaughnessy set out on a formidable
10-0 Rose Bowl-winning 1940 sea
son.
For the next 30 years, the Cardinal
returned to relative obscurity, and
though the Golden Bears under
Pappy Waldorf were strong in the late
'4os, the lack of a strong cross-Bay
rival takes some of the edge off of the
importance of its victories in the Big
Game back then. When Waldorf's
team slipped back in the 'sos, it was in
no way a consequence of any real
Stanford resurgence in the Big Game.
The same argument doesn't hold
in 1972. Then, Stanford had won
back-to-back Rose Bowls, but had
just lost its coach, John Ralston. It
was a great opportunity for Cal to
help break any momentum that the
Cardinal may have built up, and that
is exactly what it did.
From this hastily researched ver
sion of history, the years 1924,1936,
1940 and 1972 stand out as turning
points where the Big Game result
marked the resurgence of one team
at the cost of the other, and 2009 was

almost on this list.
Stanford still had outside hopes of
the Pac-10 title resting on winning its
final conference game and a little bit
of luck from elsewhere, and fans were
excited by the chances of its star run
ning-back, Toby Gerhart, scooping up
the Heisman Trophy. The Card was
guaranteed its first bowl game and
winning record since 2001, and the
Bears were looking at their seventh
straight bowl game.
The Cal victory put the brakes on
Stanford's much-improved season,
and could have been even more sig
nificant were it not for this year.

Stanford will walk on to the field
at Memorial Stadium with a season
record of 9-1 and a No. 6 BCS rank
ing that makes it a clear favorite to
play in one of the highly prized BCS
bowl games. Head coach Jim Har
baugh's team has improved each
year, and star quarterback Andrew
Luck is in serious contention for the
Heisman Trophy and will find it very
hard to turn down a potential selec
tion in the first round of the NFL
Draft to stay for two more years on

the Farm.
California, in comparison, sits at
5-5 in a thoroughly mid-table posi
tion and far outside the national top
25. A win against Stanford, though,
would ensure the Golden Bears are
again bowl eligible and also make
Jeff Tedford the most successful Big
Game coach ever, with eight wins.
Success breeds success, and fail
ure breeds failure. Cal fans will want
the cruel glory of destroying the high
flying aspirations of their rivals. Flar
baugh will want to build on what he
has achieved so far at the Farm to at
tract more talented players and cre
ate a golden era for the Cardinal
football program.
Tomorrow's game could be a
major step on that path, or when his
best laid plans are pulled apart. Cali
fornia vs. Stanford 2010 is definitely a
Big Game,

Tom Taylor is really hoping that you'll
forget that he knows very little about

and could have been even more sig
nificant were it not for this year.

Stanford will walk on to the field
at Memorial Stadium with a season
record of 9-1 and a No. 6 BCS rank
ing that makes it a clear favorite to
play in one of the highly prized BCS
bowl games. Head coach Jim Har
baugh's team has improved each
year, and star quarterback Andrew
Luck is in serious contention for the
Heisman Trophy and will find it very
hard to turn down a potential selec
tion in the first round of the NFL
Draft to stay for two more years on

the Farm.
California, in comparison, sits at
5-5 in a thoroughly mid-table posi
tion and far outside the national top
25. A win against Stanford, though,
would ensure the Golden Bears are
again bowl eligible and also make
Jeff Tedford the most successful Big
Game coach ever, with eight wins.
Success breeds success, and fail
ure breeds failure. Cal fans will want
the cruel glory of destroying the high
flying aspirations of their rivals. Flar
baugh will want to build on what he
has achieved so far at the Farm to at
tract more talented players and cre
ate a golden era for the Cardinal
football program.
Tomorrow's game could be a
major step on that path, or when his
best laid plans are pulled apart. Cali
fornia vs. Stanford 2010 is definitely a
Big Game,

In its 113-year history, there has
always been far more at stake
between cross-Bay rivals Stan
ford and California than just a
wood chopping tool, but per
haps this year's Big Game could be a
critical one.
Looking back at the history of the
112 games between the two, there
have been some pretty important en
counters, from the first ever game in
1892 to the return to normality after
the Second World War.
Over this time, the whole
pageantry and lore of the rivalry also
grew step by step. The Axe first ap
peared in 1899, but after being stolen
by California for 31 years and subse
quently recovered by Stanford, it
wasn't until 1933 that it became the
official trophy of the Big Game. Oski
made his first appearance in 1941,
and, after Stanford dropped its origi
nal mascot in 1972, the Leland Stan
ford Junior University Marching
Band (LSJUMB) debuted the Tree in
1975.
After breaking from its saner
roots, the LSJUMB also caused one
of the most bizarre upsets at the end
of a football game, now infamously
known as "The Play," in 1982. Rush
ing the field in celebration of a Cardi
nal victory a few seconds too early,
they allowed Cal to score a game
winning touchdown amid the confu
sion.
But, apart from historical curiosi
ty, none of those necessarily hold spe
cial significance for the football
teams, at least in the only thing that
should really matter to them: success.
To look for those games, we need
to consider the relative form of the
two sides in the eras the games were
played, and see what the effect of
wins, or losses, were. Basically, look
for the games that were crucial turn
ing points in the teams' success.
In the 19205, Cal was on a high, not
dropping a single game in a five-year
streak that saw it win the 1921 Rose
Bowl. Stanford, meanwhile, strug
gled, scoring just seven points against
the Bears from 1920 to 1923, and by
1924, California had defeated the
Cardinal in five straight games.
But that year marked the begin
ning of Glenn "Pop" Warner's tenure
as Stanford coach, and his arrival se
cured both equality in the Big Game
(a 20-20 tie) and the Pac-10 title. It
also marked the beginning of the end
for Cal's dominance. Head coach
Andy Smith signed off the next year
with a loss, and his next two succes
sors did not come close to his record.
When Stub Allison came to
Berkeley in 1935, Cal had won just
once in the last 10 years. A hugely im
proved first season was marred by
just one loss, 13-0 to Stanford, but
turning this around in 1936, the Card
would not score a single point against
Cal for three years, years in which
Berkeley won two Rose Bowls.
Claude E. Thornhill's Stanford swift
ly went from winning the 1936 Rose
Bowl to mediocrity.
Clark Shaughnessy quickly enact
ed revenge in his very short period,
just two years, in charge at the Farm.
As Allison's team began to falter,
Shaughnessy set out on a formidable
10-0 Rose Bowl-winning 1940 sea
son.
For the next 30 years, the Cardinal
returned to relative obscurity, and
though the Golden Bears under
Pappy Waldorf were strong in the late
'4os, the lack of a strong cross-Bay
rival takes some of the edge off of the
importance of its victories in the Big
Game back then. When Waldorf's
team slipped back in the 'sos, it was in
no way a consequence of any real
Stanford resurgence in the Big Game.
The same argument doesn't hold
in 1972. Then, Stanford had won
back-to-back Rose Bowls, but had
just lost its coach, John Ralston. It
was a great opportunity for Cal to
help break any momentum that the
Cardinal may have built up, and that
is exactly what it did.
From this hastily researched ver
sion of history, the years 1924,1936,
1940 and 1972 stand out as turning
points where the Big Game result
marked the resurgence of one team
at the cost of the other, and 2009 was

almost on this list.
Stanford still had outside hopes of
the Pac-10 title resting on winning its
final conference game and a little bit
of luck from elsewhere, and fans were
excited by the chances of its star run
ning-back, Toby Gerhart, scooping up
the Heisman Trophy. The Card was
guaranteed its first bowl game and
winning record since 2001, and the
Bears were looking at their seventh
straight bowl game.
The Cal victory put the brakes on
Stanford's much-improved season,
and could have been even more sig
nificant were it not for this year.

Stanford will walk on to the field
at Memorial Stadium with a season
record of 9-1 and a No. 6 BCS rank
