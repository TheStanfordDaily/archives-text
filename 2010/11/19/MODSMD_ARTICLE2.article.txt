# BIG GAME PREDICTIONS

KABIR SAWHNEY
STANFORD 26, CAL 14: Unfortunately for Stanford, this game will be
held in Berkeley, where the Golden Bears have played like possessed men all
season. Cal's defense proved its mettle against Oregon, holding the high-flying
Ducks to just 15 points, and while it won't have as much success against Andrew
Luck and the Stanford offensive line, the Cardinal won't score its usual 35+
points. However, Brock Mansion is even worse than Kevin Riley, and behind him,
Cal will be able to do little offensive damage against Stanford's reinvented de
fense.

ZACH ZIMMERMAN
STANFORD 40, CAL 14: Stanford looked vulnerable for the first time
since its loss at Oregon when it struggled against Arizona State on the road. Like
the Sun Devils, Cal is a team whose record isn't indicative of its talent. The Gold
en Bears are exponentially better at home, and they have owned the Cardinal in
recent showdowns. That said, I can't imagine Stanford losing to an inferior team
after last year's devastating defeat at home. Andrew Luck and the offense haven't
struggled for two weeks in a row all season and I don't expect that to change this
weekend. Stanford blasts Cal in Berkeley, returning the Axe to the Farm.

JACOB JAFFE
STANFORD 34, CAL 21 : On paper, Stanford is a far better
team than Cal. But football isn't played on paper, and rivalry games
have away of bringing out the best in some teams and the worst in
others. Still, Stanford is every bit as motivated as Cal to put up a
strong performance, for revenge, bowl position and, of course, the
rivalry. Despite a few big plays, the Golden Bears won't have

enough offense to keep up with Stanford's high-powered attack,
which will manage to bounce back against a fairly stout Cal
defense.
