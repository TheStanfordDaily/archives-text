# Card heads on first trip
## 
### JACK BLANCHAT CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After knocking off Rutgers on Sunday in
the season opener, the No. 3 Stanford women's
basketball team heads away from the Farm this
weekend for two tough road games.The Cardi
nal tangles with Utah on Friday night, then
heads north to play Gonzaga on Sunday after
noon.

For the 10th year in a row, the Cardinal
opened its season with a win, defeating Rut
gers 63-50 last Sunday. The Card's next test
comes against two familiar opponents.
Stanford and Utah have played each other
in six out of the last seven years, and the two
teams will both be members of the new Pac-12
next year. The Cardinal took home a 60-41 vic
tory last year in Maples Pavilion, and is unbeat
en in 11 games all-time against the Utes.
Last year, Utah finished with a 23-12 over
all record and was the runner-up in the Moun
tain West conference after falling to San Diego
State in a 70-60 overtime defeat.The Utes went
on to the Women's NIT tournament, where

they lost to Cal in the second round.
Gonzaga, on the other hand, was on the re
ceiving end of the Cardinal's biggest scoring
output last season. Led by senior Kayla Peder
sen's 30 points and junior Nnemkadi Ogwu
mike's 29 points, Stanford cruised to a 105-75
victory last year, the most points the Cardinal
scored in a single game all season.
Minus the loss to Stanford, Gonzaga had a
dominant season last year. The Bulldogs lost
only five games all season, won their third West
Coast Conference title in the last four years
and had a 20-game winning streak snapped in
the Sweet 16 of the NCAA tournament by
Xavier. Xavier's win over Gonzaga sent them
to their matchup with Stanford in the Elite
Eight, where the Card escaped 55-53 thanks to
Jeannette Pohlen's coast-to-coast, buzzer
beating layup.
Even against two dangerous teams like the
Utes and Zags, Stanford fans can expect to see
plenty of new looks on the floor this weekend,
as Head Coach Tara VanDerveer expects to
use all many different rotations in order to find
the strongest starting lineup and the best rota

tions off the bench.
The Cardinal used six different lineups
against Rutgers, which VanDerveer said was
"not enough." After losing seniors Jayne
Appel and Rosalyn Gold-Onwude to gradua
tion last year, the Cardinal seems to have
found a few answers to who will help take over
for the two fan favorites.
Sophomore forward Joslyn Tinkle started
only two games last year in lieu of an injured
Jayne Appel, but the 6-foot-3 forward raised
eyebrows and expectations when she
dropped two three-pointers in the first three
minutes of Sunday's game against Rutgers.
The Missoula, Mont, native had a solid 10
points and six rebounds in Sunday's matchup
against Rutgers. Coach VanDerveer praised
the poise and calm of her new starter.
Tinkle says the team's anxiety was "typical
butterflies," but the sophomore is using her
calm and confidence to help take over the
holes left from last year's team.
"It's not so hectic [as a sophomore], you're

After a fiercely competitive first half against Rutgers last Sunday, Stanford was able to pull away and
win its opener. The Card will need to stay strong this weekend as it faces Utah and Gonzaga.
more comfortable and at ease, you
have a more definite role on the
team," she said. "I think knowing that,
it's a big goal to be one of those go-to
players. That's something I keep
working on every day to be a big-time
contributor to this team."

Tinkle says she's playing the role of
a small forward or shooting guard this

year instead of taking over Appel's
spot at center, and that her own versa
tility as well as her teammates'
gives the Cardinal a huge advantage
down the road.
"Me and Nnemkadi [Owgumike]
and Kayla [Pedersen] all have the
ability to step out whenever we need
to," she said. "It's a compliment that
we can mix it up depending on who
our opponent is."
VanDerveer said that versatility is a
positive thing, but it has some conse
quences for the players like Tinkle
who are stepping into new roles this

season.
"It'll take some time [to set a start
ing lineup], and it might ire based on a
couple things," she said. "All three
freshmen played exceedingly well, but
they don't have the margin for error.
They're getting thrown into the deep
end of the pool."
But even with an opening win, a
No. 3 national ranking and a starting
spot on the floor. Tinkle isn't afraid to
say that there is room for improve
ment.
"We have a lot to work on," she
said. "Rutgers definitely hung in there
with us, and we need to exceed the ex
pectations that we have for our
selves."
Tinkle says those expectations are
clear, and that setting the bar high will
help the Cardinal both achieve their
goals this year and fill the holes from
last year.
"Coming here, they expect the best
from you, they want to see all aspects
of the game," Tinkle said. "With the
presence of Jayne and Rosalyn being
gone, all of us can share that role, and
everyone wants to step up and equal
ly contribute."
Stanford will take on Utah tonight
at 6 p.m. PST in Salt Lake City, before
traveling to Spokane, Wash., on Sun
day to play Gonzaga at 2 p.m.
