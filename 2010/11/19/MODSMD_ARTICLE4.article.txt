## UNIVERSITY Room numbers on Axess? Registrar says display of room numbers 'inadvertent' 
### ELLEN HUET MANAGING EDITOR 
Stanford Who, the searchable public directory of Stan
ford's students, faculty and staff, now displays students' resi
dences and room numbers by default due to an unintended
change by the University registrar's office over the summer.
The change in default display information was not a re
sult of a change in registrar policy, according to University
Registrar Thomas Black. Rather, he said, there was a change
between Student Housing and People Soft to account for a
compliance issue with SEVIS, the federal Student and Ex
change Visitor Information Services.
"That change inadvertently accounted for the change in
display in Stanford Who," Black said in an e-mail to The
Daily.

IT communications director Nancy Ware also confirmed
that a change in the information sent from Housing account
ed for the new information displayed on public listings for
students.
Schools may publicly disclose "directory" information
about students, including address, under the federal Family
Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974. The law re
quires that schools give students 18 and older a "reasonable"
amount of time to ask the school not to release directory in
formation, according to the U.S. Department of Education.
Black and Ware both noted that under the law, Stanford
considers students' room numbers as directory information.
Black said students were not notified of the change in dis
played information "because the change was an inadvertent
byproduct of aforementioned compliance change we were
programming over the summer."
"We are currently taking steps to address the concerns
being raised," Black added.
Information on Stanford Who can be accessed from any
Internet connection, with a "Stanford-only" listing option
for those who would like to keep certain information privy
only to those with a SUNet ID.
To edit which information is publicly displayed, students
can log into Axess, go to the "Student Center" tab, scroll to
the bottom and click on "Privacy Settings."
Black said he hopes students educate themselves about
their information's availability.
"We encourage students to review the information on
their privacy options and make decisions accordingly," he
said.
