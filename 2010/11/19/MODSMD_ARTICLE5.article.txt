## Caltrain study starts longer analysis 
### PATRICIA HO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The lead author of a recent study on suicidal and ac
cidental deaths on Caltrain tracks identifying time and
location patterns, Jan Botha, hopes the study's results can
be applied to other commuter rail quarters around the
country.
The study comes as a prerequisite to determining the
causes of some railroad suicides. Botha, a transportation
engineering professor at San Jose State University, used
data from August 1992 to December 2009 in an effort to
ensure that the sample was large enough to be statistical
ly significant and also to account for inevitable changes
in the train system and surrounding environment over
time.
"The reason why we picked such a long period is be
cause if you divide the number of years into the number
of deaths, they are still very rare events," Botha said,
adding, "Our results wouldn't be too meaningful if we
did it over a period [of] 10 years, because things change.

like the roads, traffic flow and population. All of that
changes."

Botha's research is part of a larger study conducted
by the Mineta Transportation Institute, according to
Mineta executive director Rod Diridon. It will con
tribute to the first phase of the Mineta study, which focus
es on the causes of these incidents.

"We'll be doing a whole panel of additional studies
leading to a study that will recommend remedial action,
not only for Caltrain, but other systems around the na
tion," Diridon said. "We'll look at the issue from every
perspective imaginable, from physical structures, barri
ers, warning signals, lights, signs, and all the way to psy
chological issues."

While the study cannot evaluate the success of cur
rent suicide prevention methods, it recommends that
"Caltrain continue to monitor suicides to detect patterns
and attempt to mitigate the circumstances where the sui
cides could be prevented, if such prevention methods
would be feasible from economic and other viewpoints."
Botha said that while the study provides analysis of

the historical range of Caltrain deaths, it cannot provide
explanations of the causes for suicides.
"At no point did we attempt to speculate or make
conclusions about the cause of the suicide, because we
are not experts in that," Botha said. "We only made con
clusions about the patterns, what we can see."
Results show that the peak periods of suicides corre
late with high-operating periods on the train and that
they tend to cluster at the beginning of the month. While
researchers couldn't find a distinctive trend for the
month or year that the deaths occurred, the study deter
mined that most occur on weekdays, especially Mondays
and Fridays.

Botha's team, which consists of two graduate students
from San Jose State, also found that some deaths tend to
occur more frequently in certain areas over others.
"Very few deaths were close to San Francisco be
cause the system is in a tunnel there," Botha said. "There
was a uniform suicide frequency in the area north of San
Jose, simply because it's older and
denser. But if you look at what happens
south of San Jose, there are very few
suicides and deaths because of the
smaller population."

Suicides were concentrated at the
25-mile distance between Burlingame
and Sunnyvale stations, while only one
suicide occurred south of San Jose.This
could be explained by these areas'
older neighborhoods, which suggests a
stronger integration of the railroad
with the community in these areas.
Additionally, both suicides and un
intended deaths tended to occur far
ther away from stations. Twenty per
cent of the total suicides occurred at
Caltrain stations and two-thirds of the
suicides occurred within one half of a
mile from stations. On the other hand,
a larger number of suicides occurred
near a road crossing, as 43 percent oc
curred within one tenth of a mile away
and almost two-thirds occurred within
three tenths of a mile.
Not all Caltrain deaths can be cate
gorized as "suicides."
"Suicides are relatively uniform
pattern, whereas the unintended
deaths have spikes, which means that
there may be ongoing problems,"
Botha said. "This may be because there
are more people crossing there, or
there might be a site obstruction."
In some cases of unintended deaths,
these spikes were eliminated as im
provements were made on the prob
lems causing these accidents, Botha
said.
But Botha's study is only the begin
ning.
We have to find the causes first,"
Diridon said. "I think [Botha] has done
a good job of getting started in that di
rection."
Caltrain spokeswoman Christine
Dunn said prevention efforts remain a
top priority, an endeavor that gained
even more importance after the 19 in
cidents last year. New methods include
more signs around stations that display
a suicide hotline.
Moreover, Diridon emphasized
that suicide is a community-based issue
that is not limited to this particular case
study.
"This issue is a concern all across the
nation, not just here at Caltrain," Diri
don said. "In fact, we sometimes forget
that Caltrain is one of the best-run train
systems in the country, in terms of per
formance, passengers carried and
other measures."
