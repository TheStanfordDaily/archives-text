## ROTC group awaits Stanford's response 
### KATE ABBOTT SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
An open letter to the Stanford
community asking for feedback on
the potential return of ROTC to cam
pus received fewer than 20 e-mail re
sponses and six phone calls as of
Thursday morning, according to
Ewart Thomas, a professor of psy
chology and the chair of an ad hoc
committee on ROTC.

The letter, sent last Thursday, is the
most recent example of gauging com
munity opinion in the mounting de
bate over whether or not the program
should return to campus. The Faculty
Senate formed the committee in
March after professors William Perry
'49 M.S. '5O and David Kennedy '63
recommended that discussions be re
visited.

"We all agreed that we need to
know what the Stanford community
feels about ROTC," Thomas wrote in
an e-mail to The Daily. "We decided to
start the letter with our impressions of
the key issues surrounding ROTC . . .

in the hope that that would encourage
responders to give us feedback about
the issues we think are important."
"It would be great to see students
share their opinions on the ROTC
issue with the Faculty Senate," said
Ann Thompson 'll, a cadet in the

Army branch of the program. "Stu
dents I've met over the past four
years have been very curious about,
and almost always supportive of,
ROTC."

The issues highlighted in the letter
include academic credit and instruc
tor selection for ROTC courses. The
letter also provides an overview of
the history of ROTC at Stanford.

The committee met three times
this quarter and consists of several
professors, Vice Provost for Student
Affairs Greg Boardman and two stu
dents, one of whom participates in
UC-Berkeley's Navy ROTC pro
gram. When asked about responses to
the open letter, Boardman deferred
comment to Thomas, who said the let
ter was the first step in gauging com
munity input.

"In January, the [committee] will
have a 'town hall' style meeting with
students and another meeting with
faculty," Thomas said. "Also, the com
mittee is gathering information about
how a few other universities arrange
their ROTC programs. After that,
we'll digest the information gathered
and try to make a recommendation."
Students currently participating in
ROTC cross-town programs travel to
Santa Clara University, San Jose Uni
versity and UC-Berkeley for train
ing and do not receive academic
credit. All three ROTC branches
were removed from Stanford in
1973 amid antiwar sentiment and
concerns that courses would not
meet academic standards.
"The context for examining the
ROTC-at-Stanford issue in 2010 is
similar to the context of 40 years
ago, inasmuch as (a) any proposed
Stanford-ROTC program would
have to pass muster 'as a compati
ble and worthwhile academic en
deavor,' (b) the value of such a pro
gram to Stanford and the nation is
still viewed by some as 'high' and
by others as 'low,'" the letter states.
The letter also says "the present

context differs from the earlier one"
because of voluntary service and be
cause the federal "don't ask, don't
tell" policy is a considerable road
block to bringing ROTC back to
campus.

Thomas said the majority of re
sponses thus far are positive to
ward ROTC.

"The respondents typically do
not specify exactly what this means,
and the committee is not yet at the
point of knowing what sort of pro
gram might be feasible," Thomas
said. "We will have to examine
whether course credit can be given
for ROTC courses, but we haven't
done so as yet."
The committee is accepting
community feedback until Nov. 22.
It expects to report its findings in
the spring.
