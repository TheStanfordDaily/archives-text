## ROTC group awaits Stanford's response 
### KATE ABBOTT SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
An open letter to the Stanford
community asking for feedback on
the potential return of ROTC to cam
pus received fewer than 20 e-mail re
sponses and six phone calls as of
Thursday morning, according to
Ewart Thomas, a professor of psy
chology and the chair of an ad hoc
committee on ROTC.

The letter, sent last Thursday, is the
most recent example of gauging com
munity opinion in the mounting de
bate over whether or not the program
should return to campus. The Faculty
Senate formed the committee in
March after professors William Perry
'49 M.S. '5O and David Kennedy '63
recommended that discussions be re
visited.

"We all agreed that we need to
know what the Stanford community
feels about ROTC," Thomas wrote in
an e-mail to The Daily. "We decided to
start the letter with our impressions of
the key issues surrounding ROTC . . .

in the hope that that would encourage
responders to give us feedback about
the issues we think are important."
"It would be great to see students
share their opinions on the ROTC
issue with the Faculty Senate," said
Ann Thompson 'll, a cadet in the

Army branch of the program. "Stu
dents I've met over the past four
years have been very curious about,
and almost always supportive of,
ROTC."

The issues highlighted in the letter
include academic credit and instruc
tor selection for ROTC courses. The
letter also provides an overview of
the history of ROTC at Stanford.

The committee met three times
this quarter and consists of several
professors, Vice Provost for Student
Affairs Greg Boardman and two stu
dents, one of whom participates in
UC-Berkeley's Navy ROTC pro
gram. When asked about responses to
the open letter, Boardman deferred
comment to Thomas, who said the let
ter was the first step in gauging com
munity input.

"In January, the [committee] will
have a 'town hall' style meeting with
students and another meeting with
faculty," Thomas said. "Also, the com
mittee is gathering information about
how a few other universities arrange
their ROTC programs. After that,
we'll digest the information gathered
and try to make a recommendation."
