Last month, a large, tarp-like material
greeted students and faculty as they
stepped off the elevator on the fourth
floor of the Communication Department
in Building 120 a sign that construc
tion for the new state-of-the-art Virtual
Human Interaction Lab (VHIL) that
began in September was on track.
Jeremy Bailenson, an associate pro
fessor in communication who heads the
lab, began the planning stage during his

eight-month sabbatical last year, meeting
once a week with a team of 15 archi
tects, programmers and World Viz, LLC,

The 1,100-square-foot room, twice the
size of the old lab that opened seven
years ago, will allow the simultaneous
stimulation of three different senses: spa
tialized sound, touch and 3-D imagery.
The feat will be accomplished by new
