## Virtual lab construction underway in Bldg. 120 
### CASSANDRA FELICIANO DESK EDITOR 
Last month, a large, tarp-like material
greeted students and faculty as they
stepped off the elevator on the fourth
floor of the Communication Department
in Building 120 a sign that construc
tion for the new state-of-the-art Virtual
Human Interaction Lab (VHIL) that
began in September was on track.
Jeremy Bailenson, an associate pro
fessor in communication who heads the
lab, began the planning stage during his

eight-month sabbatical last year, meeting
once a week with a team of 15 archi
tects, programmers and World Viz, LLC,
the leading virtual reality creators to
design a new lab that will provide high
quality multisensory stimulation.
The 1,100-square-foot room, twice the
size of the old lab that opened seven
years ago, will allow the simultaneous
stimulation of three different senses: spa
tialized sound, touch and 3-D imagery.
The feat will be accomplished by new

three human senses at once: virtual touch, 3D imagery and spatialized sound.
equipment such as floor shakers, which allow
researchers to simulate earthquakes; a 24-
speaker surround sound so that "sounds can
move around you for a very compelling virtu
al experience"; and a screen that allows par
ticipants to see in 3-D without the use of
glasses.

The new lab is projected to debut by Feb
ruary, but Bailenson said construction fre
quently pushes back the date of completion.
Projects for the new space are already in the
works, the most important of which focuses
on environmental behavior.

The study on environmental behavior
will examine how people are affected by vis
ceral perception of the environmental con
sequences of their behavior. It will involve
giving participants the opportunity to go
through the process of waste disposal, from
actually throwing something away to driving

garbage tracks.
"It lets someone feel the consequences of
energy use," Bailenson said. "They'll know
what it feels like to live in a world with global
warming."
Construction for the VHIL is being fund
ed by the University and the National Sci
ence Foundation. Bailenson couldn't say how
much the lab will cost because it's still under
construction.
