## U.S. lags behind in advanced math 
### DANA EDWARDS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The U.S. ranks 31st among industrial
ized nations in advanced math scores,
making its scores comparable to Latvia,
Italy and Spain, according to a November
study conducted by a team of Stanford
and Munich researchers.
The report, "Teaching Math to the Tal
ented," examined existing data from two
tests administered to eighth graders in the
U.S. and internationally in 2005 and 2006.
While it's the second, not the first, inter
national comparison of math scores, it dif
fers from the previous effort in significant
areas.
Eric Hanushek, a senior fellow at the
Hoover Institution and one of three co
authors of the report, said the study is in
response to President Obama's "call to
action to secure the future of our econo
my."
"In the study, we're looking at ad
vanced-level math scores. These will cor
respond pretty well to the potential pool
of people who will be scientists and engi
neers," he said.
In the U.S., 6.04 percent of the report's
subjects were classified "advanced,"
meaning they scored at least 617.1 on the
Program for International Student As
sessment (PISA) test. Taiwan, Hong
Kong, Korea and Finland led the pack at
more than 20 percent, and 12 other na
tions more than doubled America's per
centage.
Hanushek said the study is more accu

rate than the previous study because it's
based on a wider pool of test data. The
previous study drew upon data from the
Trends in Mathematics and Science Study
(TIMMS), which Hanushek says artifi
cially inflates rankings for U.S. students
because 22 higher-scoring nations didn't
participate. The U.S. ranked 14th in that
study.

Hanushek and the other researchers
instead looked to data from the 2005 Na
tional Assessment of Educational
Progress (NAEP) and the 2006 PISA to
arrive at what they believe to be more ac
curate conclusions.

The NAEP is only administered do
mestically, but it covers a much wider pool
of test-takers and includes more demo
graphic information for the U.S. than does

the PISA, Hanushek said. Re
searchers compared NAEP data
from American eighth graders to in
ternational PISA data from the same
age level.
"We took the NAEP definition of
an advanced student and figured out
what proportion of U.S. students
scored at the advanced math level
six percent," Hanushek said. "We
then went to the PISA data and found
what PISA score corresponded to six
percent of U.S. students."
The method also allowed re
searchers to compare the scores of in
dividual states. Massachusetts came
in first with 11 percent scoring at the
advanced level placing it 14th in
ternationally while Mississippi
came in last with only 1.4 percent at
the advanced level, roughly at the
level of Turkey and Thailand.
California ranked 34th in the

country with 4.5 percent, below the
national average of 6.04. Silicon Val
ley was on par with Greece and Por
tugal.

Hanushek said the team thought
low scores in the U.S. might be in part
attributable to statistically significant
groups predisposed to academic dis
advantage. Even when they isolated
students with at least one college-ed
ucated parent, they found only 10.3
percent reached the advanced level, a
group still outperformed by all test
takers from 16 nations.

"That pinpoints the issue that we
have to improve: our schools,"
Hanushek said. "We can't just pre
tend that it's all because of the par
ents."

Deborah Stipek, dean of the Stan
ford School of Education, agreed that
the root of the problem lies almost
entirely in the schools.
"On average, elementary school
teachers perpetuate poor teaching,"
Stipek said. She attributes this to the
low status and low pay of American
teachers compared to those in other
countries.

"In Finland and Japan, teachers
are extremely high-status and well
paid," she said. "Here, they are paid
very poorly relative to other profes
sions in the country that require the
same level of education."
For example, she said, "people
who have strong backgrounds in
math can go into stronger, more lu
crative positions than teaching."
Fundamental changes must be
made to the teaching profession in
the U.S., both Hanushek and Stipek
argued, for any significant improve
ments to be seen. In California, the
state's role as a leader in technologi
cal innovation is at stake, Hanushek
said.
"I have told our governor that if
California is going to continue to be
the center for innovation, it's proba
bly going to have to import from
other states and other countries," he
said. "Right now, we're just not pro
ducing a competitive group of stu
dents."
