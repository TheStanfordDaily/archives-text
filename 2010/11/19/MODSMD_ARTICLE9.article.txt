## U.S. lags behind in advanced math 
### DANA EDWARDS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The U.S. ranks 31st among industrial
ized nations in advanced math scores,
making its scores comparable to Latvia,
Italy and Spain, according to a November
study conducted by a team of Stanford
and Munich researchers.
The report, "Teaching Math to the Tal
ented," examined existing data from two
tests administered to eighth graders in the
U.S. and internationally in 2005 and 2006.
While it's the second, not the first, inter
national comparison of math scores, it dif
fers from the previous effort in significant
areas.
Eric Hanushek, a senior fellow at the
Hoover Institution and one of three co
authors of the report, said the study is in
response to President Obama's "call to
action to secure the future of our econo
my."
"In the study, we're looking at ad
vanced-level math scores. These will cor
respond pretty well to the potential pool
of people who will be scientists and engi
neers," he said.
In the U.S., 6.04 percent of the report's
subjects were classified "advanced,"
meaning they scored at least 617.1 on the
Program for International Student As
sessment (PISA) test. Taiwan, Hong
Kong, Korea and Finland led the pack at
more than 20 percent, and 12 other na
tions more than doubled America's per
centage.
Hanushek said the study is more accu

rate than the previous study because it's
based on a wider pool of test data. The
previous study drew upon data from the
Trends in Mathematics and Science Study
(TIMMS), which Hanushek says artifi
cially inflates rankings for U.S. students
because 22 higher-scoring nations didn't
participate. The U.S. ranked 14th in that
study.

Hanushek and the other researchers
instead looked to data from the 2005 Na
tional Assessment of Educational
Progress (NAEP) and the 2006 PISA to
arrive at what they believe to be more ac
curate conclusions.

The NAEP is only administered do
mestically, but it covers a much wider pool
of test-takers and includes more demo
graphic information for the U.S. than does
