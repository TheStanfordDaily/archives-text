# HIGH STAKES
## BCS hopes are on the line for Stanford, while Cal tries for bowl eligibility and third straight Big Game win PREVIEW| 113th Big Game 
### KABIR SAWHNEY MANAGING EDITOR 
With the 113 th Big Game set for
kickoff today, the stakes could
not be higher for either team.
The No. 6 Stanford football
team is experiencing some of its
greatest success in recent memo-

ry. The Cardinal (9-1,6-1 Pac-10)
has its best record through 10
games in 59 years, and is shooting

for the program's first Rose Bowl
appearance since 2000. Stanford
managed to survive a scare on the
road at Arizona State last weekend,
managing to pull off a 17-13 win despite
a weak rushing attack.
Across the Bay, California (5-5,

3-4) has had a roller coaster ride of a
season thus far. The Golden Bears
have been one of the nation's more
puzzling teams, since they look
nearly unstoppable inside Straw
berry Canyon but utterly hapless
away from it. Cal has won every
one of its home games by blowout

margins, except for last weekend's close
15-13 loss to No. 1 Oregon.
Even then, the Bears managed to do
what no other team, including the Cardi
nal, could do: slow down the Ducks and
keep them from rolling up video game
like numbers on offense. Meanwhile, they
have lost every road game except for a 20-
13 victory at Washington State two weeks
ago.
This Big Game will have significant
bowl implications for both Stanford and
Cal.
The Cardinal still has hopes for an in
vitation to a prestigious BCS bowl, but
would see those hopes extinguished with
a loss to Cal. Stanford's best chance is to
receive an at-large berth, since the Pac
10's automatic berth will go to Oregon if it
wins the conference. Officials from the
Rose Bowl were present at Stanford's last
home game against then-No. 15 Arizona,
and Sugar Bowl representatives made the
trip to Tempe last weekend to see the
Card take on the Sun Devils.


With a win over Stanford, the Golden Bears
will gain bowl eligibility and be guaranteed an
other trip to the postseason. Cal could even get
into one of the bowls higher in the Pac-10's
pecking order due to the dearth of bowl-eligi
ble teams in the conference this season.
However, even if Cal falls to Stanford, it still
has a strong chance to earn bowl eligibility, with
a home game against Washington to close out
its season next weekend.
After its lackluster performance last week
end, the focus will be squarely on the Stanford
offense to reach the same level that it achieved
against Arizona and Washington, when it
scored over 40 points in each game. Led by red
shirt sophomore quarterback Andrew Luck,
the unit only mustered 17 points against the
Sun Devils and committed two turnovers, one
on an interception and the other on a Luck
fumble.
Despite those miscues, Luck had another
strong game against the Arizona State sec
ondary, throwing for 292 yards on 33-41 pass
ing. He leads the conference in passing efficien
cy with a 159.7 rating and in total yardage (run
ning and passing) with 288.4 yards per game.
The biggest reason for Stanford's struggles
against ASU was its failure to get its running
game going early in the contest. The Cardinal
offense has relied on the run all season to set
the pace for the offense, utilizing the offensive
line to dominate at the line of scrimmage and
open up running lanes for Stanford's talented
rotation of tailbacks. Forcing opponents to re
spect the run also opened up the passing attack
for Luck and his receivers.

The Sun Devil front seven provided a blue
print for stopping that dimension of Stanford's
offense, as linebacker Vontaze Burfict and the
rest of his unit established control of the line of
scrimmage early in the game. Stanford sopho
more Stepfan Taylor, the featured back in Stan
ford's offense, was severely limited, going for
only 39 yards on 16 carries. Overall, Stanford
rushed 42 times for just 128 yards, a 3.0 yards

per-carry average.

That blueprint for stopping the Card is cer
tainly one that the Bears could be capable of ex
ecuting. Cal used a similar game plan to limit
Oregon, and has a stud linebacker of its own in
Mike Mohamed, who is 10th in the conference
with 7.7 tackles per game. Against Oregon, Cal
did a good job of stuffing the run, only giving up
162 yards on 55 carries, good for a measly 2.9
yards-per-carry average. The Bears' defense
has also been spectacular at home; the highest
point total it has surrendered in Memorial Sta
dium is 17, to Arizona State, and it held three of
its five home foes (including Arizona) to single
digit points.
However, Cal is vulnerable on offense after
losing starting quarterback Kevin Riley to in
jury for the season. In two starts, backup Brock
Mansion has looked fairly underwhelming,
throwing two picks in a 12-24,171-yard perfor
mance in his first outing against lowly Wash
ington State. Against the Ducks, Mansion com
pleted only 10 of 28 passes for 69 yards, and
added -1 yards on two rushes.
The Golden Bears do have a respectable
rushing attack, led by running back Shane
Vereen, who is averaging nearly 100 yards per
game. Vereen has 13 touchdowns on the season
and averages 5.2 yards per carry. Stanford fans
will likely remember Vereen from last season's
Big Game at Stanford Stadium, when he
gashed the Cardinal for 193 yards on 42 carries
and scored three touchdowns, leading the
Bears to a 34-28 victory.
Stanford will need another strong perfor
mance from a defensive unit that has under
gone a renaissance in recent weeks. Since giv
ing up 28 points to Washington State on Oct. 23,
the Cardinal has shut out Washington and held
Arizona and Arizona State to 17 and 13 points,
respectively. Though Stanford has not looked
as good on the stat sheet, it has a propensity for
making key plays and momentum-killing stops
at critical points in the game.
The defense has also dominated opposing

offensive lines, especially with the play of se
nior linebacker Owen Marecic and sophomore
linebacker Shayne Skov. The defensive line,
led by redshirt junior Matt Masifilo, has also
done a strong job of engaging opposing offen
sive lines and freeing up the linebacking corps
to make plays.
With postseason hopes on the line for both
teams, Stanford will take on Cal in the 113 th
Big Game on Saturday at 12:30 p.m. at Memo
rial Stadium in Berkeley.

its five home foes (including Arizona) to single
digit points.
However, Cal is vulnerable on offense after
losing starting quarterback Kevin Riley to in
jury for the season. In two starts, backup Brock
Mansion has looked fairly underwhelming,
throwing two picks in a 12-24,171-yard perfor
mance in his first outing against lowly Wash
ington State. Against the Ducks, Mansion com
pleted only 10 of 28 passes for 69 yards, and
added -1 yards on two rushes.
The Golden Bears do have a respectable
rushing attack, led by running back Shane
Vereen, who is averaging nearly 100 yards per
game. Vereen has 13 touchdowns on the season
and averages 5.2 yards per carry. Stanford fans
will likely remember Vereen from last season's
Big Game at Stanford Stadium, when he
gashed the Cardinal for 193 yards on 42 carries
and scored three touchdowns, leading the
Bears to a 34-28 victory.
Stanford will need another strong perfor
mance from a defensive unit that has under
gone a renaissance in recent weeks. Since giv
ing up 28 points to Washington State on Oct. 23,
the Cardinal has shut out Washington and held
Arizona and Arizona State to 17 and 13 points,
respectively. Though Stanford has not looked
as good on the stat sheet, it has a propensity for
making key plays and momentum-killing stops
at critical points in the game.
The defense has also dominated opposing

offensive lines, especially with the play of se
nior linebacker Owen Marecic and sophomore
linebacker Shayne Skov. The defensive line,
led by redshirt junior Matt Masifilo, has also
done a strong job of engaging opposing offen
sive lines and freeing up the linebacking corps
to make plays.
With postseason hopes on the line for both
teams, Stanford will take on Cal in the 113 th
Big Game on Saturday at 12:30 p.m. at Memo
rial Stadium in Berkeley.

With the 113 th Big Game set for
kickoff today, the stakes could
not be higher for either team.
The No. 6 Stanford football
team is experiencing some of its
greatest success in recent memo-

ry. The Cardinal (9-1,6-1 Pac-10)
has its best record through 10
games in 59 years, and is shooting

for the program's first Rose Bowl
appearance since 2000. Stanford
managed to survive a scare on the
road at Arizona State last weekend,
managing to pull off a 17-13 win despite
a weak rushing attack.
Across the Bay, California (5-5,

3-4) has had a roller coaster ride of a
season thus far. The Golden Bears
have been one of the nation's more
puzzling teams, since they look
nearly unstoppable inside Straw
berry Canyon but utterly hapless
away from it. Cal has won every
one of its home games by blowout

margins, except for last weekend's close
15-13 loss to No. 1 Oregon.
Even then, the Bears managed to do
what no other team, including the Cardi
nal, could do: slow down the Ducks and
keep them from rolling up video game
like numbers on offense. Meanwhile, they
have lost every road game except for a 20-
13 victory at Washington State two weeks
ago.
This Big Game will have significant
bowl implications for both Stanford and
Cal.
The Cardinal still has hopes for an in
vitation to a prestigious BCS bowl, but
would see those hopes extinguished with
a loss to Cal. Stanford's best chance is to
receive an at-large berth, since the Pac
10's automatic berth will go to Oregon if it
wins the conference. Officials from the
Rose Bowl were present at Stanford's last
home game against then-No. 15 Arizona,
and Sugar Bowl representatives made the
trip to Tempe last weekend to see the
Card take on the Sun Devils.


With a win over Stanford, the Golden Bears
will gain bowl eligibility and be guaranteed an
other trip to the postseason. Cal could even get
into one of the bowls higher in the Pac-10's
pecking order due to the dearth of bowl-eligi
ble teams in the conference this season.
However, even if Cal falls to Stanford, it still
has a strong chance to earn bowl eligibility, with
a home game against Washington to close out
its season next weekend.
After its lackluster performance last week
end, the focus will be squarely on the Stanford
offense to reach the same level that it achieved
against Arizona and Washington, when it
scored over 40 points in each game. Led by red
shirt sophomore quarterback Andrew Luck,
the unit only mustered 17 points against the
Sun Devils and committed two turnovers, one
on an interception and the other on a Luck
fumble.
Despite those miscues, Luck had another
strong game against the Arizona State sec
ondary, throwing for 292 yards on 33-41 pass
ing. He leads the conference in passing efficien
cy with a 159.7 rating and in total yardage (run
ning and passing) with 288.4 yards per game.
The biggest reason for Stanford's struggles
against ASU was its failure to get its running
game going early in the contest. The Cardinal
offense has relied on the run all season to set
the pace for the offense, utilizing the offensive
line to dominate at the line of scrimmage and
open up running lanes for Stanford's talented
rotation of tailbacks. Forcing opponents to re
spect the run also opened up the passing attack
for Luck and his receivers.

The Sun Devil front seven provided a blue
print for stopping that dimension of Stanford's
offense, as linebacker Vontaze Burfict and the
rest of his unit established control of the line of
scrimmage early in the game. Stanford sopho
more Stepfan Taylor, the featured back in Stan
ford's offense, was severely limited, going for
only 39 yards on 16 carries. Overall, Stanford
rushed 42 times for just 128 yards, a 3.0 yards

per-carry average.

That blueprint for stopping the Card is cer
tainly one that the Bears could be capable of ex
ecuting. Cal used a similar game plan to limit
Oregon, and has a stud linebacker of its own in
Mike Mohamed, who is 10th in the conference
with 7.7 tackles per game. Against Oregon, Cal
did a good job of stuffing the run, only giving up
162 yards on 55 carries, good for a measly 2.9
yards-per-carry average. The Bears' defense
has also been spectacular at home; the highest
point total it has surrendered in Memorial Sta
dium is 17, to Arizona State, and it held three of
its five home foes (including Arizona) to single
digit points.
However, Cal is vulnerable on offense after
losing starting quarterback Kevin Riley to in
