# HIGH STAKES
## BCS hopes are on the line for Stanford, while Cal tries for bowl eligibility and third straight Big Game win PREVIEW| 113th Big Game 
### KABIR SAWHNEY MANAGING EDITOR 
With the 113 th Big Game set for
kickoff today, the stakes could
not be higher for either team.
The No. 6 Stanford football
team is experiencing some of its
greatest success in recent memo-

ry. The Cardinal (9-1,6-1 Pac-10)
has its best record through 10
games in 59 years, and is shooting

for the program's first Rose Bowl
appearance since 2000. Stanford
managed to survive a scare on the
road at Arizona State last weekend,
managing to pull off a 17-13 win despite
a weak rushing attack.
Across the Bay, California (5-5,

3-4) has had a roller coaster ride of a
season thus far. The Golden Bears
have been one of the nation's more
puzzling teams, since they look
nearly unstoppable inside Straw
berry Canyon but utterly hapless
away from it. Cal has won every
one of its home games by blowout

margins, except for last weekend's close
15-13 loss to No. 1 Oregon.
Even then, the Bears managed to do
what no other team, including the Cardi
nal, could do: slow down the Ducks and
keep them from rolling up video game
like numbers on offense. Meanwhile, they
have lost every road game except for a 20-
13 victory at Washington State two weeks
ago.
This Big Game will have significant
bowl implications for both Stanford and
Cal.
The Cardinal still has hopes for an in
vitation to a prestigious BCS bowl, but
would see those hopes extinguished with
a loss to Cal. Stanford's best chance is to
receive an at-large berth, since the Pac
10's automatic berth will go to Oregon if it
wins the conference. Officials from the
Rose Bowl were present at Stanford's last
home game against then-No. 15 Arizona,
and Sugar Bowl representatives made the
trip to Tempe last weekend to see the
Card take on the Sun Devils.
