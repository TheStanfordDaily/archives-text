Troy has officially fallen.
The No. 14 Stanford football team ham
mered another nail into the coffin of once
proud USC on Saturday night, defeating the
Trojans by a final score of 37-35.
While the game ended in victory for the Car
dinal (5-1,2-1 Pac-10), that outcome was uncer
tain until the final few seconds of the game. De
spite being a significant underdog, the Trojans
(4-2, 1-2 Pac-10) played hard throughout the
contest, matching the Stanford offense point
for point behind quarterback Matt Barkley.
Stanford eventually won the game on a last
second field goal from senior kicker Nate
Whitaker, who drilled a kick from 30 yards out
as time expired to send the Card to victory.
Whitaker had earlier missed an extra point
wide left, which might have proved decisive.
"I had to make it," Whitaker said of the final
kick. "I had a chance to redeem myself, and I
made it. I'm definitely glad I got a chance it
would have been a rough night otherwise.
"This is the biggest kick I've ever had," he
added. "I couldn't have done it without the
team there, giving me that chance."
The win allowed Stanford to bounce back
from a tough loss last weekend at then-No. 4
Oregon. The defeat saw the Cardinal lose its
top-10 ranking and marked its first loss of the
season.
"We were definitely aware of our shortcom
ings last week," said redshirt sophomore quar
terback Andrew Luck. "We didn't dwell on it,
and we tried to improve upon it. This had to be
our half we can't have another debacle like
we did last weekend."
On the flip side, USC was deprived of a re
venge opportunity for last season, when the

Cardinal defeated the Trojans 55-21 in the Col
iseum in Los Angeles.
The two teams were fairly evenly matched
throughout this game, with the offenses trading
scores back and forth all night.
USC drew first blood in the first quarter
when, taking over after a Stanford punt, it put
together an impressive drive behind a duo of
running backs senior Allen Bradford and
freshman Dillon Baxter. Bradford provided the
bulk of the carries for the Trojans, while Baxter
served well as a secondary tailback primarily
out of the "wildcat" formation he scored the
Trojans' first touchdown of the game by knifing
through the Stanford front seven virtually un
touched on his way into the end zone.
The Cardinal responded quickly, scoring a
touchdown of its own on a pass from Luck to ju
nior receiver Chris Owusu.

The two teams continued to trade points and
possession throughout the first half. Stanford
squandered opportunities to pull ahead twice,
as two fumbles deep inside USC territory cost it
dearly. However, the Cardinal defense was also
opportunistic, managing to force a fumble of its

own early in the second quarter that prevented
the Trojans from adding to their tally.
The score at halftime a 14-14 draw was
indicative of the kind of close battle the teams
were waging. Nevertheless, Luck saw room for
improvement.
"We were a little disappointed as a unit at
halftime," he said. "We had a couple of suicide
plays, fumbling the ball. We had the motivation
to come out and put points up on the board
every time we went out there."
Stanford's offense came out early in the
third quarter and looked ready to dominate the
rest of the game. After getting the ball back on
a USC punt, the offense took the ball and
pounded the Trojans with their power running
game, scoring a touchdown on a long, 14-play
drive that went 93 yards down the field. After a
made extra point, Stanford took a 21-14 lead.
USC's offense took the field and responded
in kind, scoring a quick touchdown on a 61-yard
pass from Barkley to freshman receiver Robert
Woods to knot the score at 21 apiece. Woods
would eventually grab 12 receptions on the
