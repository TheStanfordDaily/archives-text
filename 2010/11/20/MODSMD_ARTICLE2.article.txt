# THE 						SEASON SO FAR
## 
### KABIR SAWHNEY MANAGING EDITOR 
With only two games left in Stanford's
historic season, including today's game
against rival Cal, it's worth taking a look
back and seeing how the Cardinal got to its
current position.
Stanford enters today's game with a 9-1
overall record, including a 6-1 record
against Pac-10 Conference opponents.
Stanford has its best record through 10
games since 1951, its first season under
Chuck Taylor.
The Card's only loss came on Oct. 2 in
Eugene, Ore., where it fell 52-31 to an Ore
gon team that has since risen to No. 1 in the
BCS standings. Stanford's signature win
came on Nov. 6 at home, where it defeated
then-No. 15 Arizona, 42-17. The Cardinal
enters this weekend at No. 6 in the BCS
standings; it was No. 12 in the original BCS
standings, first calculated in the season's
eighth week.
Stanford was just outside the AP Top 25
in the preseason rankings, and it
currently sits at No. 7 in that poll.
To date, this Stanford team has
been defined by its two brightest
stars, head coach Jim Harbaugh
and redshirt sophomore quarter
back Andrew Luck. Harbaugh has
taken the program to heights few
thought possible when he first came
to the Farm before the 2007 season,
and he is often called the hottest
coach in the country. Luck has
emerged as a Heisman Trophy can
didate and a potential No. 1 choice
in next April's NFL Draft, all while
piling up big numbers against op
posing secondaries.
Before watching the Card take
on the Golden Bears this after
noon, let's take a look at Stanford's
games so far.

Sept. 4 vs. Sac State, W 52-17

Stanford opened its season at
home against FCS Sacramento
State and thoroughly dominated
the Hornets, setting the tone for the
rest of the season. With 529 total
yards, including 316 passing yards
and a career-high four touchdowns
from Luck, Stanford's offense
showed why it was so hyped head
ing into the season. On defense, the
Cardinal debuted its new scheme,
imported from the NFL by first
year defensive coordinator Vic
Fangio, and it worked extremely
well as the Hornets were held to
167 total offensive yards. However,
Stanford lost two key players to in
juryâ€” starting tight end Levine
Toilolo saw his season ended by an
ACL tear, and senior running back
Jeremy Stewart suffered an ankle
injury that caused him to fall out of
Stanford's tailback rotation.

Sept. 11 at UCLA, W 35-0

This game was defined by Stan
ford's defense, which shut out the
Bruins' much-hyped "Pistol" offen
sive scheme. The victory was also
Stanford's first in Pasadena since
1996. Stanford's pass defense,
which was considered its weakest
point heading into the season, com
pletely shut down the Bruins' pass
ing attack, allowing just 81 yards
overall on 11-21 passing from two
UCLA quarterbacks, Kevin Prince
and Richard Brehaut. The defense
also forced four turnovers, on two
fumble recoveries and two inter
ceptions. The game was also note
worthy for the emergence of sopho
more Stepfan Taylor as Stanford's
primary option at running back.
Taylor took 20 carries in the game,
while the next highest total from
any back was just eight carries.

Sept. 18 vs. Wake Forest, W 68-24

Stanford's second home game of
the season saw it completely blow
out the Demon Deacons, with its
offense scoring more or less at will
against a weak Wake Forest de
fense. Stanford scored a touch
down on its first eight possessions
and scored 10 touchdowns overall
(with two extra points missed by se
nior kicker Nate Whitaker). The
Cardinal rolled up 535 yards of total
offense, including 303 yards on the
ground. Luck had a stellar game as
well, throwing four touchdown
passes and scoring himself on a 52-
yard quarterback scramble.

Sept. 25 at Notre Dame, W 37-14

Stanford's victory over Notre
Dame vaulted it into the national
spotlight, since it was a nationally
televised game against one of the
nation's most storied programs.
The game was a showcase for Tay
lor, who took 28 carries for 108
yards against the Fighting Irish.
Whitaker was also a big star for
Stanford, kicking five field goals
against his former team. Flowever,
the game's biggest story was proba
bly Stanford senior Owen Marecic,
one of a very small number of play
ers in major college football to play
regularly on both offense and de
fense. Marecic scored two touch
downs in the game on consecutive
plays, one on a one-yard touch
down run and the second on an in
terception returned for a score.

Stanford's run defense was also
stellar, holding the Irish to just 44
yards on 23 carries.

Oct. 2 at No. 4 Oregon, L 52-31

With both teams ranked in the
top 10 and ESPN's College Game-
Day crew in town, the Cardinal's
matchup with the Ducks in Eugene
was easily one of Stanford's biggest
games in years. The game was
billed as a de facto Pac-10 champi
onship game, and the winner would
put itself in the driver's seat to the
Rose Bowl.
While Stanford jumped out to an
early 21-3 lead in the first quarter, it
couldn't sustain its momentum
against Oregon's high-octane of
fense, and its defense finally
cracked. While the Cardinal carried
a 31-24 lead into the locker room at
halftime, from there it was all Ducks,
with Oregon scoring four touch
downs in the second half against no
points from Stanford. Though Luck
threw for 341 yards, he also threw
two picks and was contained well by
Oregon in the second half.

Oct. 9 vs. USC, W 37-35

Stanford's game against rival
Southern California certainly went
down to the wire, as the Cardinal
took the game on a field goal from
Whitaker as time expired in the
fourth quarter. The two offenses
traded scores throughout the game,
with USC quarterback Matt
Barkley throwing for 390 yards and
three touchdowns and Luck match
ing him with 285 passing yards and
three touchdowns of his own. The
game was a story of redemption for
Whitaker; he missed the extra point
on Stanford's go-ahead touchdown
with 9:27 remaining in the fourth
quarter, but given a second chance
with the game on the line and the
Card facing a one-point deficit, he
drilled the 30-yarder.
Oct. 23 vs. Washington St., W 38-28
While Stanford beat hapless
Washington State as expected, the
close final score made many Stan
ford fans nervous about their
team's prospects. Stanford looked
sluggish and unmotivated on the
field, with the offense never seem
ing to really get into a rhythm. The
defense continued its string of
shaky performances, giving up
three fourth-quarter touchdowns
to the Cougars. WSU quarterback
Jeff Tuel made mincemeat of the
Cardinal secondary, throwing for
298 yards and four touchdowns on
21-28 passing. The win did secure
bowl eligibility for Stanford, while
officially eliminating the Cougars
from a postseason bid.

Oct. 30 at Washington, W 41 -0

Stanford came out after the
Washington State game and an
swered its critics with a dominating
performance against the Huskies.
Its offense continued its strong
play, but the real story was Stan
ford's defense, which held Wash
ington quarterback Jake Locker to
a mere 64 yards passing and one
yard rushing and notched its second
road shutout of a Pac-10 opponent
this season. The Cardinal dominat
ed the line of scrimmage on both
sides of the ball; its offensive line
opened up huge holes for the run
ning game, which went for 278
yards on 47 carries, while Stanford
defenders were constantly in the
Washington backfield making life
difficult for Locker and his running
backs.

Nov. 6 vs. No. 15 Arizona, W 42-17

With the country watching on
primetime television, Stanford en
gineered another dominating per
formance against a hyped Arizona
team. The Wildcat defense, consid
ered the best in the conference
heading into the game, had no an
swer for Luck, Taylor and true
freshman running back Anthony
Wilkerson, who were able to con
sistently gain yardage and make
plays against Arizona. On the line
of scrimmage, the Stanford offen
sive line neutralized Arizona's po
tential All-American defensive
ends, giving up no sacks through
the entire game. Meanwhile, on de
fense, the Cardinal didn't stifle the
Wildcats, but made key plays and
forced big turnovers at critical junc

tures in the game. Perhaps most
tellingly, the Wildcats converted
just three of five red zone opportu
nities and were 1-3 on fourth down.

Nov. 13 at Arizona State, Wl7-13

Stanford certainly escaped a
trap game against the Sun Devils,
pulling out a win despite looking
nothing like it had against Arizona.
Many pundits had predicted a let
down throughout the week, and
though Harbaugh insisted that his
team would remain motivated, it

certainly looked for a little while
like ASU was primed to pull the
upset. Led by linebacker Vontaze
Burfict, the Sun Devils were able to
control the line of scrimmage on
defense, making it difficult for the
Stanford running game to gain any
traction. With its rushing attack
neutralized, the Card often found
itself in third-and-long situations,
and it showed on the score sheet.
Nevertheless, the Stanford defense
saved it from its second loss of the

season by making opportunistic
plays and key stops against Sun
Devil quarterback Steven Threet.

So that's Stanford's season so
far. With a 9-1 record, it will put its
No. 6 national ranking and Rose
Bowl hopes on the line today as it
takes on the Golden Bears, further
defining this historic season.
