# THE
						SEASON SO FAR
## 
### KABIR SAWHNEY MANAGING EDITOR 
With only two games left in Stanford's
historic season, including today's game
against rival Cal, it's worth taking a look
back and seeing how the Cardinal got to its
current position.
Stanford enters today's game with a 9-1
overall record, including a 6-1 record
against Pac-10 Conference opponents.
Stanford has its best record through 10
games since 1951, its first season under
Chuck Taylor.
The Card's only loss came on Oct. 2 in
Eugene, Ore., where it fell 52-31 to an Ore
gon team that has since risen to No. 1 in the
BCS standings. Stanford's signature win
came on Nov. 6 at home, where it defeated
then-No. 15 Arizona, 42-17. The Cardinal
enters this weekend at No. 6 in the BCS
standings; it was No. 12 in the original BCS
standings, first calculated in the season's
eighth week.
Stanford was just outside the AP Top 25
