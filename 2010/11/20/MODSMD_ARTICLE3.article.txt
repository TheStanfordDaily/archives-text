NO. 6 STANFORD

KABIR SAWHNEY
STANFORD 26, CAL 14: Unfortunately
for Stanford, this game will be held in Berkeley,
where the Golden Bears have played like pos
sessed men. Cal's defense won't have as much
success as it did against Oregon, but the Cardi
nal won't score 35+ points. However, Brock
Mansion is even worse than Kevin Riley, and
behind him, Cal will be able to do little offensive
damage against Stanford's reinvented defense.

ZACH ZIMMERMAN
STANFORD 40, CAL 14: Cal will be a
scary team coming off a heartbreaking loss to
Oregon. Stanford looks more vulnerable than
ever, but the Cardinal is just too good. Stanford
takes back the Axe.

JACOB JAFFE
STANFORD 34, CAL 21 : On paper,
Stanford is a far better team than Cal. But foot
ball isn't played on paper, and rivalry games
have away of bringing out the best in some
teams. Stanford is every bit as motivated as
Cal to put up a strong performance, for re
venge, bowl position and, of course, the rivalry.
Despite a few big plays, the Golden Bears
won't have enough offense to keep up with
Stanford's high-powered attack.

WYNDAM MAKOWSKY
STANFORD 17, CAL 14: Cal's season

is a tale of two teams. The one that plays on the
road is 1 -4, while the one that plays at home is
4-1. Stanford should win, albeit in a nail-biter,

but the Golden Bears present a trap unlike any
that the Cardinal has faced this season.
NATE ADAMS
STANFORD 31, CAL 17: Both teams
will be hungry for points after scoring in the
teens last weekend, but it will be Stanford that
jumps out ahead thanks to an overpowering of
fensive line that gives balanced options to a tal
ented quarterback. Cal might hang tough in its
effort for a sixth win, and its young quarterback,
Brock Mansion, will show some spark. But it will
be Andrew Luck, Stepfan Taylor and company
standing victorious in Memorial Stadium.

DANIEL BOHM
STANFORD 24, CAL 10: This is the
biggest Big Game Stanford has played in eons.
After last week's lackluster performance, Jim
Harbaugh will have his players ready against a
very talented Cal team. The Golden Bears' de-

fense can give Stanford's offense some trou
ble, but I just can't see Cal's Brock Mansion-led
offense doing enough to retain the Axe.
CAROLINE CASELLI
STANFORD 34, CAL 24: After narrowly
losing to No. 1 Oregon last weekend, with its
defense notably holding the nation's top-scor
ing offense to 15 points, the Bears showed yet
again that home-field advantage is a huge fac
tor in their success (or failure). With the offen
sive prowess of Andrew Luck and his arsenal,
combined with Owen Marecic's awesomeness,
and the much-improved Stanford defense, the
Axe will return to its rightful home on the Farm.

MARGARET RAWSON
STANFORD 24, CAL 1 7: The Golden
Bears will have home-field advantage, but the
Axe is coming back to Stanford. Cal performed
well last weekend against Oregon, but showed
the extent of what it can accomplish against a
top team. The outcome may be close, but An
drew Luck will lead the Cardinal to victory.
