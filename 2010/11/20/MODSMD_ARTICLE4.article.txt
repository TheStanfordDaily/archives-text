# HEISMAN CALIBER
## LUCK CAPABLE OF WINNING PRESTIGIOUS TROPHY 
### LIZZY COLLINS 
TThe Heisman Trophy is awarded to the most out
standing college football player, and, for the sec
ond year in a row, a Stanford player is among the
top contenders. Redshirt sophomore Andrew
Luck is one of the nation's top quarterbacks, and
while his performance this season has made him eligible for
college football's most esteemed prize, his competition is
fierce.

Luck, quarterback of the
No. 6 Stanford football team,
is definitely in the race to win
the Heisman. However, ac
cording to football analysts,
the road ahead is steep. Over
the course of the 2010 season,
Auburn quarterback Cam
Newton, Boise State quarter
back Kellen Moore and Ore
gon tailback LaMichael
James have distinguished
themselves and are currently
the leading candidates for the
Heisman.

"You have the top three,
and (Luck) is probably at the
top of the second tier," said
Chris Huston on his website,
HeismanPundit.com.

Stats play a major role in
determining the skill of a
player, and, though Luck's
stats are impressive, they are
not phenomenal. Luck has
thrown 22 touchdowns and
seven interceptions on the
season, but he is in fourth
place because his numbers
lack the "wow" effect.

Currently at the top of the
Heisman trophy race is New
ton, the leader of No. 2
Auburn. At 6-foot-6, 250
pounds, Newton is arguably
the most talented and danger
ous player in college football,
although allegations of im
propriety during his recruit
ment out of junior college
may take him out of the run
ning. For now, he remains the
leader of the pack.
Also atop the Heisman

race are James and Moore. James is the nation's leading
rusher and an explosive tailback for top-ranked Oregon.
Moore, the top-rated passer in the country and the leader of
No. 4 Boise State, has gained great recognition for his preci
sion and poise on the playing field.

But Luck's contribution to the Stanford football team is
just as noteworthy. Leading the Cardinal to a record of 17-
5 in games he has started over the past two years, Luck is
the main reason for his
team's success. Luck, without
the help of star player and
former Stanford running
back Toby Gerhart, has led
Stanford to its best start and
highest ranking in almost half
a century.
"None of this is happening
without Andrew Luck," said
head coach Jim Harbaugh.
Making the jump to the
first tier is not impossible. If
Stanford wins its final two
games and Luck plays his best
football, then the opportunity
to bring home the Heisman
would appear tangible. He is
in a tough position and will
have to deliver flawless and
remarkable performances
over the next two weeks in
order to contend for the Heis
man Trophy, but the under
taking is doable.
"He's not having the most
Heisman-worthy season sta
tistically," ESPN analyst Rece
Davis told ESPN.com. "But,
that doesn't change my belief
that he's the most complete
quarterback in college foot
ball."

Andrew Luck deserves ac
colades for his achievements
this season. His chance of win
ning the Heisman Trophy is
slim, but he is certainly worthy
of remaining in the conversa
tion for college football's most
prestigious award.
