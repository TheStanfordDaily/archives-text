# POSTSEASON HOPES
## STANFORD COULD END UP IN ROSE BOWL, ALAMO BOWL OR OTHER BCS 
### JACOB JAFFE DEPUTY EDITOR 
For nearly a decade, Stanford football
spent the holidays recovering with family
and watching bowl games on television.
Now, the No. 6 Cardinal is closing out its
second consecutive winning season, and a
bowl berth is merely a formality.
Bowl placement, though, is far from a
formality, and with two games to play,
Stanford's bowl fate has yet to be decided.
Upcoming contests against California and
Oregon State will go a long way toward
determining the Cardinal's bowl destina
tion, but the final decision could rest in the
hands of outsiders. With that in mind,
here are possible bowl scenarios for Stan
ford football, along with the likelihood of
each, going from most to least likely.
Rose Bowl
The Granddaddy of Them All is the
aspiration for most Cardinal fans, and it
becomes more and more likely with each
passing week.
Scenario: Stanford would need to beat
both Cal and Oregon State, and then get
some help, in order to spend New Year's
in Pasadena. If No. 1 Oregon lost both of
its remaining contests (vs. No. 22 Arizona

and at Oregon State), the Cardinal would
be the outright Pac-10 champion, and
therefore get a spot in the Rose Bowl (as
suming Stanford does not finish in the top
two in the final BCS standings).
A more likely scenario involves the
Cardinal entering the Rose Bowl as an at
large BCS selection. The only way this can
happen is if Oregon is playing for the na
tional title, leaving a spot open for Stan
ford. BCS rules require the Rose Bowl to
take a qualified school from outside the
BCS conferences if one is available,
meaning No. 3 TCU or No. 4 Boise
State would have to get in ahead of
Stanford. The chance for the Cardinal is
if TCU or Boise State is in the national
title game against Oregon, the Rose
Bowl will be free to select Stanford to
take on the Big 10 representative. This
would happen if No. 2 Auburn loses one
of its final two contests (at No. 11 Al
abama and vs. No. 17 South Carolina in
the SEC Championship Game), which is a
distinct possibility.
Likelihood: As unlikely as it seemed a
few weeks ago, the Rose Bowl is now a
very good possibility for Stanford, as long
as the Cardinal doesn't trip up against the
Golden Bears or Beavers. Most experts
expect Auburn to struggle against Alaba
ma in Tuscaloosa, and a loss there would
put either TCU or Boise State in the title
game, making Stanford's appearance in
Pasadena almost assured.

Alamo Bowl
If Stanford stumbles or is shut out of
the BCS, it will likely head to San Antonio
for the Alamo Bowl.
Scenario: A loss against Cal or Oregon
State would eliminate the Cardinal from
BCS contention, but the Cardinal could
also get left out of a BCS game at 11-1.
Stanford has the No. 2 spot in the Pac-10
all but locked up, and the best Pac-10
team that isn't in a BCS game will play in
the Alamo Bowl.
Likelihood: Cal and Oregon State will
not make things easy for Stanford, so a
loss in either game is not out of the ques
tion. Also, if Auburn and Oregon win out,
the Cardinal could very well be headed
for Texas in December yet again.
Fiesta Bowl, Orange Bowl or Sugar Bowl
With Stanford in the top 10 of the BCS
standings, an at-large selection to a BCS
bowl would appear to be a possibility, al
though this is where national perception
comes into play.
Scenario: If Stanford wins its next two
games and the Cardinal doesn't make the
Rose Bowl or title game, an at-large spot
in one of the other BCS games is up for
grabs. The Cardinal's on-field resume cer
tainly qualifies it for a spot in a premier
bowl game, but other factors might pre
vent Stanford's selection. The Fiesta
Bowl will choose the Big 12 champion
