# A 						history of the Bay's biggest football rivalry
## 
### Tom Taylor 
In its 113-year history, there has always been far
more at stake between cross-Bay rivals Stan
ford and California than just a wood chopping
tool, but perhaps this year's Big Game could be
a critical one.
Looking back at the history of the 112 games be
tween the two, there have been some pretty important
encounters, from the first ever game in 1892 to the re
turn to normality after the Second World War.
Over this time, the whole pageantry and lore of the
rivalry also grew step by step. The Axe first appeared
in 1899, but after being stolen by California for 31
years and subsequently recovered by Stanford, it
wasn't until 1933 that it became the official trophy of
the Big Game, Oski made his first appearance in 1941,
and, after Stanford dropped its original mascot in
1972, the Leland Stanford Junior University March
ing Band (LSJUMB) debuted the Tree in 1975.
After breaking from its saner roots, the LSJUMB
also caused one of the most bizarre upsets at the end
of a football game, now infamously known as "The
Play," in 1982. Rushing the field in celebration of a
Cardinal victory a few seconds too early, they allowed
Cal to score a game-winning touchdown amid the
confusion.
But, apart from historical curiosity, none of those
necessarily hold special significance for the football
teams, at least in the only thing that should really mat
ter to them: success.
To look for those games, we need to consider the
relative form of the two sides in the eras the games
were played, and see what the effect of wins, or losses,
were. Basically, look for the games that were crucial
turning points in the teams' success.
In the 19205, Cal was on a high, not dropping a sin
gle game in a five-year streak that saw it win the 1921
Rose Bowl. Stanford, meanwhile, struggled, scoring
just seven points against the Bears from 1920 to 1923,
and by 1924, California had defeated the Cardinal in
five straight games.
But that year marked the beginning of Glenn
"Pop" Warner's tenure as Stanford coach, and his ar
rival secured both equality in the Big Game (a 20-20
tie) and the Pac-10 title. It also marked the beginning
of the end for Cal's dominance. Head coach Andy
Smith signed off the next year with a loss, and his next
two successors did not come close to his record.
When Stub Allison came to Berkeley in 1935, Cal
had won just once in the last 10 years. A hugely im
proved first season was marred by just one loss, 13-0 to
Stanford, but turning this around in 1936, the Card
would not score a single point against Cal for three
years, years in which Berkeley won two Rose Bowls.
Claude E. Thornhill's Stanford swiftly went from win
ning the 1936 Rose Bowl to mediocrity.
Clark Shaughnessy quickly enacted revenge in his
very short period, just two years, in charge at the Farm.
As Allison's team began to falter, Shaughnessy set out
on a formidable 10-0 Rose Bowl-winning 1940 season.
For the next 30 years, the Cardinal returned to rel
ative obscurity, and though the Golden Bears under
Pappy Waldorf were strong in the late '4os, the lack of
a strong cross-Bay rival takes some of the edge off of
the importance of its victories in the Big Game back
then. When Waldorf's team slipped back in the 'sos, it
was in no way a consequence of any real Stanford
resurgence in the Big Game.
The same argument doesn't hold in 1972. Then,
Stanford had won back-to-back Rose Bowls, but
had just lost its coach, John Ralston. It was a great
opportunity for Cal to help break any momentum
that the Cardinal may have built up, and that is ex
actly what it did.
From this hastily researched version of history, the
years 1924,1936,1940 and 1972 stand out as turning
points where the Big Game result marked the resur
gence of one team at the cost of the other, and 2009
was almost on this list.
Stanford still had outside hopes of the Pac-10 title
resting on winning its final conference game and a lit
tle bit of luck from elsewhere, and fans were excited by
the chances of its star running-back, Toby Gerhart,
scooping up the Heisman Trophy. The Card was
guaranteed its first bowl game and winning record
since 2001, and the Bears were looking at their sev
enth straight bowl game.
The Cal victory put the brakes on Stanford's
much-improved season, and could have been even
more significant were it not for this year.
Stanford will walk on to the field at Memorial Sta
dium with a season record of 9-1 and a No. 6 BCS
ranking that makes it a clear favorite to play in one of
the highly prized BCS bowl games. Head coach Jim
Harbaugh's team has improved each year, and star
quarterback Andrew Luck is in serious contention for
the Heisman Trophy and will find it very hard to tmn
down a potential selection in the first round of the
NFL Draft to stay for two more years
on the Farm.

California, in comparison, sits at
5-5 in a thoroughly mid-table posi
tion and far outside the national top
25. A win against Stanford, though,
would ensure the Golden Bears are
again bowl eligible and also make
Jeff Tedford the most successful Big
Game coach ever, with eight wins.
Success breeds success, and fail
ure breeds failure. Cal fans will want
the cruel glory of destroying the high
flying aspirations of their rivals. I lar
baugh will want to build on what he
has achieved so far at the Farm to at
tract more talented players and cre
ate a golden era for the Cardinal foot
ball program.
Today's game could be a major
step on that path, or when his best
laid plans are pulled apart. California
vs. Stanford 2010 is definitely a Big
Game.

you'll forget that he knows very little
about American football. Educate
him on the game's finer points at

encounters, from the first ever game in 1892 to the re
turn to normality after the Second World War.
Over this time, the whole pageantry and lore of the
rivalry also grew step by step. The Axe first appeared
in 1899, but after being stolen by California for 31
years and subsequently recovered by Stanford, it
wasn't until 1933 that it became the official trophy of
the Big Game, Oski made his first appearance in 1941,
and, after Stanford dropped its original mascot in
1972, the Leland Stanford Junior University March
ing Band (LSJUMB) debuted the Tree in 1975.
After breaking from its saner roots, the LSJUMB
also caused one of the most bizarre upsets at the end
of a football game, now infamously known as "The
Play," in 1982. Rushing the field in celebration of a
Cardinal victory a few seconds too early, they allowed
Cal to score a game-winning touchdown amid the
confusion.
But, apart from historical curiosity, none of those
necessarily hold special significance for the football
teams, at least in the only thing that should really mat
ter to them: success.
To look for those games, we need to consider the
relative form of the two sides in the eras the games
were played, and see what the effect of wins, or losses,
were. Basically, look for the games that were crucial
turning points in the teams' success.
In the 19205, Cal was on a high, not dropping a sin
gle game in a five-year streak that saw it win the 1921
Rose Bowl. Stanford, meanwhile, struggled, scoring
just seven points against the Bears from 1920 to 1923,
and by 1924, California had defeated the Cardinal in
five straight games.
But that year marked the beginning of Glenn
"Pop" Warner's tenure as Stanford coach, and his ar
rival secured both equality in the Big Game (a 20-20
tie) and the Pac-10 title. It also marked the beginning
of the end for Cal's dominance. Head coach Andy
Smith signed off the next year with a loss, and his next
two successors did not come close to his record.
When Stub Allison came to Berkeley in 1935, Cal
had won just once in the last 10 years. A hugely im
proved first season was marred by just one loss, 13-0 to
Stanford, but turning this around in 1936, the Card
would not score a single point against Cal for three
years, years in which Berkeley won two Rose Bowls.
Claude E. Thornhill's Stanford swiftly went from win
ning the 1936 Rose Bowl to mediocrity.
Clark Shaughnessy quickly enacted revenge in his
very short period, just two years, in charge at the Farm.
As Allison's team began to falter, Shaughnessy set out
on a formidable 10-0 Rose Bowl-winning 1940 season.
For the next 30 years, the Cardinal returned to rel
ative obscurity, and though the Golden Bears under
Pappy Waldorf were strong in the late '4os, the lack of
a strong cross-Bay rival takes some of the edge off of
the importance of its victories in the Big Game back
then. When Waldorf's team slipped back in the 'sos, it
was in no way a consequence of any real Stanford
resurgence in the Big Game.
The same argument doesn't hold in 1972. Then,
Stanford had won back-to-back Rose Bowls, but
had just lost its coach, John Ralston. It was a great
opportunity for Cal to help break any momentum
that the Cardinal may have built up, and that is ex
actly what it did.
From this hastily researched version of history, the
years 1924,1936,1940 and 1972 stand out as turning
points where the Big Game result marked the resur
gence of one team at the cost of the other, and 2009
was almost on this list.
Stanford still had outside hopes of the Pac-10 title
resting on winning its final conference game and a lit
tle bit of luck from elsewhere, and fans were excited by
the chances of its star running-back, Toby Gerhart,
scooping up the Heisman Trophy. The Card was
guaranteed its first bowl game and winning record
since 2001, and the Bears were looking at their sev
enth straight bowl game.
The Cal victory put the brakes on Stanford's
much-improved season, and could have been even
more significant were it not for this year.
Stanford will walk on to the field at Memorial Sta
dium with a season record of 9-1 and a No. 6 BCS
ranking that makes it a clear favorite to play in one of
the highly prized BCS bowl games. Head coach Jim
Harbaugh's team has improved each year, and star
quarterback Andrew Luck is in serious contention for
the Heisman Trophy and will find it very hard to tmn
down a potential selection in the first round of the
NFL Draft to stay for two more years
on the Farm.

California, in comparison, sits at
5-5 in a thoroughly mid-table posi
tion and far outside the national top
25. A win against Stanford, though,
would ensure the Golden Bears are
again bowl eligible and also make
Jeff Tedford the most successful Big
Game coach ever, with eight wins.
Success breeds success, and fail
ure breeds failure. Cal fans will want
the cruel glory of destroying the high
flying aspirations of their rivals. I lar
baugh will want to build on what he
has achieved so far at the Farm to at
tract more talented players and cre
ate a golden era for the Cardinal foot
ball program.
Today's game could be a major
step on that path, or when his best
laid plans are pulled apart. California
vs. Stanford 2010 is definitely a Big
Game.

you'll forget that he knows very little
