## MEN'S WATER POLO Driving for an MPSF title 
### DASH DAVIDSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford men's water polo team is in the final stretch of what
has, to this point, been a very successful regular season. The Cardinal
(13-6, 5-2 MPSF) is currently in a tie for third place in the highly com
petitive Mountain Pacific Sports Federation (MPSF). After a nail-bit
ing loss to No. 6 Pacific on Sunday afternoon at Avery Aquatic Cen
ter, Stanford's national ranking of No. 3 is liable to slip just a little bit.
This season has seen a fair share of ups and downs for the veteran
Stanford squad, and the team's maturity has definitely contributed to the
cohesive level of success it has achieved in this topsy-turvy season.

Redshirt freshman two-meter Brogan Miller goes for a shot. Stanford is ranked third in the nation and sits at third
in the MPSF standings, with the conference tournament set for next weekend at Stanford's Avery Aquatic Center.
The beginning of the school
year brought two tournaments
the NorCal and SoCal Invita
tionals which annually kick
start the water polo season into
gear. Stanford struggled at both
of these tournaments, uncharac
teristic given its normally strong
tournament play. The Cardinal
finished fourth at the NorCal
and sixth at the SoCal. Both
tournaments ended with losses
to rival California.
Just after the Cardinal's sec
ond loss to Cal at the SoCal Invi
tational on Oct. 3, Stanford
achieved its biggest win of the
season, at home against USC. The
Trojans entered as the No. 1 team
in the land and were in the midst
of two winning streaks 18
straight victories overall and 17 in
a row against Stanford. Mean
while, the Cardinal was reeling
after its tough outings at the invi
tationals, but was at home for the
first time all season.
Stanford redshirt junior

goalie Brian Pingree had a com
ing-out party in that game, and
Stanford ended up winning, 5-3,
dethroning USC and buoying it
self back into the top five in the
national rankings. For his ef
forts, Pingree was named the
MPSF player of the week.
At that point in the season,
the Cardinal was 6-4, with its
year marked by inconsistency.
Since the win over USC, the Car
dinal has gone 7-2, playing cohe
sively and in a clutch manner,
with several impressive victories
over tough foes. The USC game
was definitively the hinge upon
which the Stanford men's water
polo season has pivoted from
mediocre to excellent.
Stanford will start its postsea
son after Thanksgiving, at the
MPSF Tournament. If Stan
ford defeats Cal on Nov. 19 in
Berkeley, which came after
this newspaper went to press, it
could position itself well for a
high seed. The tournament will
take place on Nov. 26-28 at
Stanford's Avery Aquatic
Center.
