## MEN'S WATER POLO Driving for an MPSF title 
### DASH DAVIDSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford men's water polo team is in the final stretch of what
has, to this point, been a very successful regular season. The Cardinal
(13-6, 5-2 MPSF) is currently in a tie for third place in the highly com
petitive Mountain Pacific Sports Federation (MPSF). After a nail-bit
ing loss to No. 6 Pacific on Sunday afternoon at Avery Aquatic Cen
ter, Stanford's national ranking of No. 3 is liable to slip just a little bit.
This season has seen a fair share of ups and downs for the veteran
Stanford squad, and the team's maturity has definitely contributed to the
cohesive level of success it has achieved in this topsy-turvy season.

in the MPSF standings, with the conference tournament set for next weekend at Stanford's Avery Aquatic Center.
