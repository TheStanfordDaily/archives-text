# BATTLES ON THE EAST COAST
## FIELD HOCKEY MAKES RUN TO NCAA TOURNEY BUT FALLS EARLY TO UNC 
### DANIEL BOHM DESK EDITOR 
For the third time in four years, Stanford
won the NorPac Tournament, won an
NCAA Tournament play-in game and lost
in the first round of the of the tournament to
one of the nation's best teams.
The Cardinal (15-6,5-1 NorPac) won the
regular season league title and then defeat
ed Longwood, Appalachian State and rival
Cal to win the conference tournament. The
NorPac Conference champion is not guar
anteed a spot in the NCAA Tournament
field, but instead must win a play-in game to
qualify. Stanford was sent east to take on
Atlantic-10 champion Massachusetts (15-7,
7-0 Atlantic 10) for a shot at the field.
In the play-in game in Amherst, Mass.,
the Cardinal extended its season-high win
streak to six games with a 2-1 victory.
Sophomore Kelsey Lloyd broke a 1-1 tie
with a goal in the 44th minute.
Stanford's victory earned it a rematch
with No. 2 North Carolina the Cardinal
lost to the Tar Heels 2-1 earlier in the sea
son. This time around, North Carolina won,
3-1, after pulling out to an early 3-0 lead in
the first half. Stanford's only goal was a sec
ond-half strike from redshirt senior forward
Kat Swank.
The loss not only ended its season, but
also moved Stanford to 0-10 all time in
NCAA Tournament games.
Still, this season will likely be seen as a
success as Stanford defeated ranked teams
(No. 8 Wake Forest, No. 18 Massachusetts)
