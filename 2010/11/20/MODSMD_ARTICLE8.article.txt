# BATTLES ON THE EAST COAST
## FIELD HOCKEY MAKES RUN TO NCAA TOURNEY BUT FALLS EARLY TO UNC 
### DANIEL BOHM DESK EDITOR 
For the third time in four years, Stanford
won the NorPac Tournament, won an
NCAA Tournament play-in game and lost
in the first round of the of the tournament to
one of the nation's best teams.
The Cardinal (15-6,5-1 NorPac) won the
regular season league title and then defeat
ed Longwood, Appalachian State and rival
Cal to win the conference tournament. The
NorPac Conference champion is not guar
anteed a spot in the NCAA Tournament
field, but instead must win a play-in game to
qualify. Stanford was sent east to take on
Atlantic-10 champion Massachusetts (15-7,
7-0 Atlantic 10) for a shot at the field.
In the play-in game in Amherst, Mass.,
the Cardinal extended its season-high win
streak to six games with a 2-1 victory.
Sophomore Kelsey Lloyd broke a 1-1 tie
with a goal in the 44th minute.
Stanford's victory earned it a rematch
with No. 2 North Carolina the Cardinal
lost to the Tar Heels 2-1 earlier in the sea
son. This time around, North Carolina won,
3-1, after pulling out to an early 3-0 lead in
the first half. Stanford's only goal was a sec
ond-half strike from redshirt senior forward
Kat Swank.
The loss not only ended its season, but
also moved Stanford to 0-10 all time in
NCAA Tournament games.
Still, this season will likely be seen as a
success as Stanford defeated ranked teams
(No. 8 Wake Forest, No. 18 Massachusetts)

and ended the year as conference
champions. It also showed that field
hockey is not just an East Coast
sport Stanford also forced na
tional power Syracuse to overtime
and lost a close game to Michigan
State.

Stanford will, however, lose
three starters to graduation: de

fenders Heather Alcorn and
Camille Gandhi and midfielder and
the team's second-leading scorer
Xanthe Travlos.

There are a number of bright
spots returning to next year's squad,
namely sophomore Becky Dru,
who led the team in scoring with 13
goals and 10 assists this season. Also
back will be the team's third-lead
ing scorer, junior forward
Stephanie Byrne.
