Playing at the center of the national
stage, Stanford's football team made a re
sounding statement on Saturday night.
The No. 6 Cardinal (8-1, 5-1 Pac-10) de
feated No. 18 Arizona (7-2,4-2), unleashing
offensive fireworks en route to a 42-17 victo
ry. The win keeps Stanford in the discussion
for a possible berth in the Rose Bowl or an
other BCS bowl.
"We're playing for a championship,"
Stanford head coach Jim Harbaugh said.
"That's our goal to get to the Rose Bowl
and win a Pac-10 championship. That's all
we're playing for."
The game featured two marquee quarter
backs in Stanford redshirt sophomore An
drew Luck and Arizona junior Nick Foles,
leading some to expect the game to be an of
fensive shootout. Luck and the Stanford of
fense certainly fulfilled those expectations,
tallying 510 yards, including 293 yards on 23-
32 passing from Luck.
"We prepared ourselves for a shootout,"
said junior defensive back Michael Thomas.
"We had some goals in mind ... if it came
down to a shootout, we were prepared."
The Stanford offense set the tone early in
the game, scoring a touchdown on a 45-yard
strike from Luck to junior receiver Chris
Owusu, who was streaking wide open down
the left sideline. The score indicated that the
Card would be able to move the ball at will
against an overhyped Arizona defense.
The Wildcats entered the game highly
ranked in a number of defensive statistical
categories. Arizona was seventh nationally
in scoring defense, 10th in total defense and
sixth in rushing defense and was recording
almost 3.5 sacks per game. Stanford notched
yardage marks well above Arizona's season

averages, especially in the running game
Cardinal rushers rolled up 217 yards against
a run defense that had previously surren
dered an average of 88.4 yards per game.
Sophomore running back Stepfan Taylor,
while held to a relatively low 82 yards,
scored four touchdowns.
Stanford was able to move the ball
against Arizona chiefly because it neutral
ized a Wildcat defensive line that features
two of the best defensive ends in the confer
ence, Ricky Elmore and Brooks Reed. The
Stanford offensive line contained both play
ers all night, surrendering no sacks and giv
ing Luck plenty of time to allow his re
ceivers' routes to develop and make plays.
Elmore and Reed each had just one tackle
on the night.
"I think our line took it personally, and
they were excited about going against the best
ends in the conference," Harbaugh said. "Our
guys wanted to prove something as well. More
so than any other week, I think they had a
mindset of proving something tonight."
In the receiving game, Owusu led all re
ceivers for both Stanford and Arizona, haul
ing in nine catches for 165 yards and a touch
down.
"Chris had a wonderful evening," Har
baugh said. "He had a big play to get our first
points on the board. He did a double move,
made it at about 16 yards, and then got about
10 yards of separation."
Owusu also made a diving catch to pre
serve a Stanford drive early in the fourth
quarter. He dived forward to gain a little
separation from two Arizona defensive
backs and kept his hands under the ball to
preserve the completion.
"That might be the best catch I've ever
seen in person from the sideline," Har
baugh said. "I thought that was an unbeliev
able catch."
While Stanford's offense moved easily
against an exposed Arizona defense, the

Stanford defense continued to play well.
After a string of rough outings, the Card
bounced back last week, shutting out Wash
ington on the road. Facing an elite quarter
back in Foles, the Cardinal rose to the chal
lenge again, severely limiting the Wildcat of
fense, Despite rolling up 428 yards, Arizona
only mustered 17 points.
Stanford's defense also played well in the
clutch. Though Arizona looked good on the
stat sheet in piling up yards, it went just 7-16
on third-down conversions and 1-3 on
fourth-down conversions. The Cardinal de

fense also played well in the red zone the
Wildcats only converted three of five red
zone opportunities. Stanford killed three
Arizona drives with clutch plays one
drive ended in an interception by senior cor
nerback Richard Sherman, one with a
fourth-down pass deflection on the Stanford
five-yard line by redshirt junior linebacker
Thomas Keiser and one on an intentional
grounding from Foles as he was being
sacked for a big loss by sophomore line-
