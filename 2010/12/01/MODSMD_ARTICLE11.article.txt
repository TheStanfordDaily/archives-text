# Security company is quiet on Big Game crowd control
## 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Kabir Sawhney Brianna Pang 
Landmark Event Staffing Services,
which provided security for last Satur
day's Big Game, this week declined to
comment on how its guards dealt with
Stanford fans on the field after the
game.
Midway through the fourth quar
ter of the Berkeley game, security
guards were deployed in front of the
Stanford fan section in the southeast
corner of California Memorial Stadi
um, where Stanford supporters pre
pared to rush the field as the clock
wound down.
According to Marc DeCoulode,
lieutenant of investigations with the
University of California police depart
ment at Berkeley, the guards were

there for safety purposes, and it is
"standard procedure" at Cal football
games to have them in place. He said
that if Cal's football team had been in
a position to win the game, similar
measures would have been enacted to
prevent Cal fans from rushing onto
the field.
Some guards attempted to physi
cally restrain and deter Stanford fans
from joining in the Axe celebration on
the field, said students who were there.
Jackson Dartez 'l3 was among the
students who headed for the field as
the game ended.
"We were at the football players
when a security guard came out of
nowhere, ran at me, grabbed me and
then threw me down and said, 'Sir,
you cannot be on the field. Go back
into the stands now,'" Dartez said.
"They pushed me back toward the
stands."
Dartez said he was not injured and

does not plan to file a complaint.
Guards tried to contain the Stanford
Band in the fourth quarter by getting
the drum major and the Dollies off the
field, said one band member.
"The band was annoyed because
they were coercing the drum major
back into the stands," said Tyler
Berbert 'l3, who plays mellophone.
"The Dollies were also annoyed be
cause that's what they do. They dance
on the field."
A You Tube video surfaced Satur
day evening purporting to show a
Stanford student being restrained by
the neck by two men dressed in black
who some believed were security
guards, though their identities are un
clear in the video. In a blog post on
Sunday, George Malkin 'l3 of The
Unofficial Stanford Blog identified
the student as Sam Pressman 'll, who
declined to comment for this story.
Public arrest records for Nov. 20

from UCPD show that Pressman was
arrested at Memorial Stadium after
the game for public drunkenness, one
of four arrested for public drunken
ness that afternoon. Pressman was
held in custody until sober, then re
leased.
DeCoulode said he was unaware
of any violence by UCPD officers or
by Landmark staffers.
"I haven't heard any complaints of
violence on Saturday," he said.
Cal Athletics referred The Daily to
UCPD for comment.

pany with offices in Oakland, Calif.,
was hired by Cal to provide security,
ticket taking and ushering services
during the game. Landmark says on
its website it also provides event serv
ices to Stanford Athletics.
