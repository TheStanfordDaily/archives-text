# WASC team comes to campus for Farm's reappraisal
## 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Cassandra Feliciano 
A five-member review team from the Accrediting
Commission for Senior Colleges and Universities con
cludes its three-day visit today, marking the critical sec
ond leg in Stanford's three-stage reaccreditation process
that began in January 2007.

Representing the Western Association of Schools and
Colleges (WASC), the committee offers accreditation to in
stitutions offering undergraduate and graduate educations
in California, Hawaii, Guam and the Pacific Basin. Its mem
bers include faculty and administrators from UC-Irvine,
MIT, Princeton, Caltech and the University of Hawaii.
The team attended presentations from administrative
officials and two open forums on Wednesday, one each
for faculty and students, to give the Stanford community
a chance to comment on the school's effectiveness. Some
of the major points of assessment and discussion include
the University's financial status, residential education, re
search, undergraduate advising and student affairs.
As part of the second cycle dubbed the "capacity
and preparatory review" Stanford has also submitted a
35-page report evaluating undergraduate programs in for
eign language and writing and rhetoric. The report, which
included 12 data exhibits and 28 appendices, focused on
the progress of first- and second-year students taking the
most popular languages on campus, French, Spanish and
Chinese, as well as the effectiveness of the first-year writ
ing program and writing-in-the-major programs.
Although the end date for reaccreditation is not ex
pected until late 2012 or early 2013, the University has al
ready taken steps to assure that it complies with the asso
ciation's core standards, endeavors chronicled on the
Stanford Reaccreditation by WASC website.
As early as the fall of 2008, the Stanford Accreditation
Steering Committee, a 50-person group specifically created
to guide the University during the accreditation process,
surveyed a cross-section of the current junior class and has
been conducting quarterly meetings with these students to
hear about their experiences on the Farm.
According to the website, WASC has four core stan
dards: 1) defining the University's purpose and setting
appropriate educational objectives; 2) achieving these
educational objectives through "teaching and learning,
scholarship and creative activity, and support for student
learning;" 3) developing methods to sustain these objec
tives; 4) "creating an organization committed to learn
ing."
The final cycle, "educational effectiveness review,"
will take place in fall 2012. Stanford was last accredited in
2000.
