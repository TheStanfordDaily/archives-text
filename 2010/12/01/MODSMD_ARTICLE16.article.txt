## BOSP assesses Beijing language waiver effects 
### LAURYN WILLIAMS 
While the Bing Overseas Study
Program (BOSP) waived its lan
guage requirement last February to
boost enrollment for its fall 2010 and
spring 2011 programs in Beijing, pro
gram officials say they do not antici
pate doing the same for other pro
grams this year.
Though the Beijing program had
not been among the most popular in
the past few years, applications to
participate in the upcoming spring
quarter program have resurged.
According to BOSP student rela
tions specialist Lee Dukes, full en
rollment may have been caused by
the waived language requirement
and the addition of Stanford faculty
member Thomas Fingar M.A. '69
Ph.D. 'll, a former U.S. State Depart
ment official, to the program.
When it decided to waive the Bei
jing language requirement, BOSP
consulted faculty on campus, staff
stationed in Beijing and students to
factor in their interests. The feedback
of students participating in the pro
gram without the language require
ment this fall will be key in determin
ing the effectiveness of the new for
mat.
Meanwhile, the most popular

overseas programs for Stanford stu
dents have traditionally been in Aus
tralia, Kyoto and Oxford. The first
round applications for the Oxford
program for the fall 2010 quarter ex
ceeded those of any other program,
receiving 75 applications for 47 spots.
These programs constantly see high
application numbers, but the new
programs in Cape Town and Madrid
have received much interest from
students recently.
"Cape Town has a service learn
ing component that is attractive to
students and it is also our only pro
gram in Africa," Dukes said. And
many students meet the language re
quirement for the Madrid program
before they enter Stanford for their
freshman year.
In the past year, Florence has also
seen a decline in enrollment, filling
32 spots in fall 2010 and 28 spots in
winter 2011 for a program with a 40-
student capacity.
"Many students come to Stanford
with Spanish or French so it is easier
to go to Madrid, Paris or Santiago,
but not many students come to Stan
ford with Italian," Dukes said in an e
mail to The Daily.
BOSP's one-quarter programs
use a two-round system for applica
tions. According to the BOSP web
site, students are encouraged to
apply to their first choice program
during the first round of applications
as they are only allowed to apply to
one program. Results from the first
round are announced two weeks
after each specific program's dead
line.
Students who do not receive their
first round choice may apply to an
additional program during the sec
ond round provided all vacancies
were not filled during the first round
of selection.
Capacity for enrollment differs
between programs but usually
ranges from 24 openings in Cape
Town to 48 in Australia. For fall and
winter 2010-11, BOSP accepted
nearly 80 percent of applicants.
According to Dukes, BOSP
would prefer enrollment to be at ca
