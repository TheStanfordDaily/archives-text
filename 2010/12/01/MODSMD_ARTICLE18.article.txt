# Westboro pickets on campus

### â€“ Caity Monroe 
When a handful of members of the radical
Westboro Baptist Church arrived on campus
on Jan. 30 to picket the corner of Mayfield
and Campus, the Stanford community was
ready to respond with messages of unity and
acceptance. A counter-protest organized by
the Jewish Student Association, Hillel and 22
co-sponsors from Stanford and Palo Alto at
tracted an estimated 800 to 1,000 people, ac
cording to police.
The counter-protest featured anti-hate
signs and performances by Talisman, Blake
Parkinson 'lO playing "Amazing Grace" on
bagpipes, and the Stanford band. The crowd
also read a declaration titled "Stanford Unit
ed" out loud.
The event, which was advertised with the
goal "to affirm our common values, regard
less of WBC's presence," was largely smooth
and peaceful, though three of the tires of the
group's vehicle were slashed.
Those in attendance were pleased by the
counter-protest's turnout as well the message
it sent about the values of the Stanford com
munity.
"While I really abhor what the Westboro
Baptist Church stands for, it resulted in a pos
itive opportunity for the University, to have
so many students come together to support
each other and make a statement for toler
ance and against hate," said University
spokeswoman Lisa Lapin.
