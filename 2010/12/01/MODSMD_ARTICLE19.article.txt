# Major curriculum study begins

The Study for Undergraduate Education
at Stanford (SUES) launched in February as
part of a comprehensive, top-level effort by
the University to reexamine the undergradu
ate curriculum.
The study, headed by history professor
James Campbell and biology professor Susan
McConnell, is attempting to achieve two ob
jectives: articulating the goals and mission of
undergraduate education on the Farm, and
translating that philosophy into a set of prac
tical recommendations regarding Universi
ty-wide educational requirements.
Though setting requirements for earning
a major will remain under the control of indi
vidual departments, SUES will address other
issues regarding the undergraduate academ
ic experience, including the role of programs
such as Introductory Seminars, Introduction
to the Humanities and the Program and
Writing and Rhetoric and current require
ments for writing, breadth, citizenship and
foreign language.
The University's last similar effort was
conducted in 1994. Since its announcement,
SUES has presented to the Faculty Senate
and polled student opinions at a town hall
meeting in May. Since then, the study has

moved forward with its review of the under
graduate curriculum as its subcommittees,
centered on topics such as writing, the fresh
man year and breadth requirements, contin
ue to meet. The study is also continuing to so
licit student opinions, with Vice Provost of
Undergraduate Education Harry Elam
sending an e-mail Nov. 19 to upperclassmen
asking them for a "frank assessment" of their
IHUM experiences.
