# BCS BOUND
## Victory propels Stanford to No. 4 
### KABIR SAWHNEY MANAGING EDITOR 
The Stanford football team stat
ed its case for a BCS bowl berth in
emphatic fashion on Saturday night,
defeating Oregon State, 38-0, in the
final game of its regular season. The
Cardinal will now be forced to wait
for a week before learning its final
bowl destination, as the final games
of college football's regular season
don't wrap up until next weekend.
No. 6 Stanford (11-1,8-1 Pac-10)
now has the most wins in the pro
gram's history, which stretches back
to the founding of the University in
1892.
In a game that Stanford head
coach Jim Harbaugh described as
"thorough all the way around," the
Cardinal dominated the Beavers on
both sides of the ball. Stanford's of
fense rolled up yards on Oregon
State's defense, with a balanced at
tack generating yardage through the
air and on the ground.
Sophomore Stepfan Taylor led
the running attack he gained 124
yards on 14 carries, punctuated by a
long 62-yard touchdown run in the
third quarter. With his performance,
Taylor went over 1,000 yards rush
ing on the season, becoming only the
sixth Stanford back to accomplish
that feat. Overall, Stanford gained
165 yards on the ground.
However, the story of the day on
offense was the passing game. Red
shirt sophomore quarterback An
drew Luck turned in a complete
game, annihilating the Oregon State
secondary with a 305-yard, four
touchdown performance. Of course.
Luck was helped by his receivers,
who turned in some great plays of
their own.
One such play came late in the

second quarter, when Luck com
pleted a pass over the middle to sen
ior receiver Doug Baldwin. Baldwin
caught the ball on the left hash
mark, eluded one defender's grasp
and juked around two more players
on his way into the right corner of
the end zone. Overall, Baldwin
scored two touchdowns on the day
on five receptions for 97 yards.
"Andrew gave me the eye saying
it was okay to go up behind [the line
backer]," Baldwin said. "I got the
ball in the perfect place, and I just let
my instincts take over after that."
Stanford also got another great
catch-and-run from sophomore tail
back Tyler Gaffney. On the first play
of the fourth quarter, Gaffney lined
up as a wide receiver on the right
side. Luck hit him with a short
screen, and Gaffney simply raced
past the defense up the right side of
the field. He eluded a final tackier
inside the 10-yard line and went into
the end zone for a touchdown. The
52-yard play was Luck's longest pass
of the game.
Stanford's defensive play was

also very impressive. The game
marked the third time the Cardinal
has shut out a Pac-10 opponent this
season Stanford also pulled the
feat against UCLA in its first confer
ence game of the season and against
Washington at the end of October.
"Our defensive coordinator, Vic
Fangio, can't get enough praise,"
said redshirt sophomore linebacker
Chase Thomas. "A shutout is the
best compliment you can give the
defense."
Thomas had an excellent game
himself, leading the Stanford de
fense in a number of statistical cate
gories. He led the team in sacks with
2.5, tackles for loss with 3.5 and
overall tackles with nine, as well as
forcing a fumble and deflecting a
pass.
With Stanford among the coun
try's best teams at 11-1, the Cardinal
must now contemplate the various
possibilities that could see it land in
one of the prestigious BCS bowls.
While Stanford is ranked highly in
every major poll, including the BCS
standings, it is not guaranteed a spot
in a BCS bowl unless it finishes in
the top four of the BCS standings or
wins the Pac-10 an impossibility
due to Oregon's position at the top
of the conference.
However, both the players and
Harbaugh believe that the team is
worthy of a BCS invitation.
"I think we are the best one-loss
team in the country," Thomas said.
"Our offense is really hard to stop
right now, they're so reliable, and
our defense made so many strides
from last year. I don't see why we
shouldn't go to a BCS game."
"Our guys have stated the case
on the field," Harbaugh said. "We're

GAME NOTES: With big wins over its last two
opponents, Stanford finishes the season
with an 11-1 record, including an 8-1

assured of a berth in a BCS bowl. Most
analysts are projecting Stanford to land in
the Orange Bowl or the Fiesta Bowl.

not lobbyists, we're not campaigners.
"We've impressed the heck out of
11 teams we played this season," he
continued. "The voters should be im
pressed this is one heck of a foot
ball team."
While some coaches publicly
stump for their teams to be included
in bowl games, Harbaugh reiterated
that he has no plans to do something
similar.
"I think we've done all the lobby
ing we can do on the field," he said.
Unlike Stanford, Oregon State is
still trying to gain bowl eligibility.
The Beavers need just one win to be
come eligible, but their only remain
ing game is a rivalry game next
weekend against the country's No. 1

team: Oregon.
"Our only deal left for this team is
to do everything we can to prepare
for that game next week and win it,"
said Oregon State head coach Mike
Riley.
Luck also garnered a lot of
postgame praise, both for his per
formance against the Beavers and
throughout the season. With his per
formance, Luck is over 3,000 passing
yards for the season, only the fourth
Stanford quarterback to reach that
mark in a single season. His four
touchdown passes also give him 28
for the season, a total which breaks
the mark held by John Elway and
Steve Stenstrom for the most by a
Stanford quarterback in history.
Luck is also currently in the run
ning for the Heisman Trophy, pre
sented to the country's top college
football player, and Harbaugh
gushed with praise after the game.
"He's the best player, he's the

most valuable player, on maybe the
best team in the country," Harbaugh
said. "He has done everything a guy
could do in this season that plays the
quarterback position ... I really feel
like Andrew is head and shoulders
above them all.
"[He has] the quality of playing
great when the game is on the line,"
Harbaugh added later. "That quality
separates the great ones from the
very good ones. He's got it. It's an 'it'
thing, maybe, but he's got it."
However, Luck himself wasn't
quite as effusive when discussing his
candidacy.
"I don't really have an opinion on
what my chances are," he said. "My
whole philosophy toward it has been:
If I'm good enough to win it, I'll win it;
if I'm not, I'm not. I'll just let my play
do the talking."

third quarter. With his performance,
Taylor went over 1,000 yards rush
ing on the season, becoming only the
sixth Stanford back to accomplish
that feat. Overall, Stanford gained
165 yards on the ground.
However, the story of the day on
offense was the passing game. Red
shirt sophomore quarterback An
drew Luck turned in a complete
game, annihilating the Oregon State
secondary with a 305-yard, four
touchdown performance. Of course.
Luck was helped by his receivers,
who turned in some great plays of
their own.
One such play came late in the

second quarter, when Luck com
pleted a pass over the middle to sen
ior receiver Doug Baldwin. Baldwin
caught the ball on the left hash
mark, eluded one defender's grasp
and juked around two more players
on his way into the right corner of
the end zone. Overall, Baldwin
scored two touchdowns on the day
on five receptions for 97 yards.
"Andrew gave me the eye saying
it was okay to go up behind [the line
backer]," Baldwin said. "I got the
ball in the perfect place, and I just let
my instincts take over after that."
Stanford also got another great
catch-and-run from sophomore tail
back Tyler Gaffney. On the first play
of the fourth quarter, Gaffney lined
up as a wide receiver on the right
side. Luck hit him with a short
screen, and Gaffney simply raced
past the defense up the right side of
the field. He eluded a final tackier
inside the 10-yard line and went into
the end zone for a touchdown. The
52-yard play was Luck's longest pass
of the game.
Stanford's defensive play was

also very impressive. The game
marked the third time the Cardinal
has shut out a Pac-10 opponent this
season Stanford also pulled the
feat against UCLA in its first confer
ence game of the season and against
Washington at the end of October.
"Our defensive coordinator, Vic
Fangio, can't get enough praise,"
said redshirt sophomore linebacker
Chase Thomas. "A shutout is the
best compliment you can give the
defense."
Thomas had an excellent game
himself, leading the Stanford de
fense in a number of statistical cate
gories. He led the team in sacks with
2.5, tackles for loss with 3.5 and
overall tackles with nine, as well as
forcing a fumble and deflecting a
pass.
With Stanford among the coun
try's best teams at 11-1, the Cardinal
must now contemplate the various
possibilities that could see it land in
one of the prestigious BCS bowls.
While Stanford is ranked highly in
every major poll, including the BCS
standings, it is not guaranteed a spot
in a BCS bowl unless it finishes in
the top four of the BCS standings or
wins the Pac-10 an impossibility
due to Oregon's position at the top
of the conference.
However, both the players and
Harbaugh believe that the team is
worthy of a BCS invitation.
"I think we are the best one-loss
team in the country," Thomas said.
"Our offense is really hard to stop
right now, they're so reliable, and
our defense made so many strides
from last year. I don't see why we
shouldn't go to a BCS game."
"Our guys have stated the case
on the field," Harbaugh said. "We're

continued. "The voters should be im

While some coaches publicly

in bowl games, Harbaugh reiterated
that he has no plans to do something
similar.
"I think we've done all the lobby
ing we can do on the field," he said.
Unlike Stanford, Oregon State is
still trying to gain bowl eligibility.
The Beavers need just one win to be
come eligible, but their only remain
ing game is a rivalry game next
weekend against the country's No. 1

team: Oregon.
"Our only deal left for this team is
to do everything we can to prepare
for that game next week and win it,"
said Oregon State head coach Mike
Riley.
Luck also garnered a lot of
postgame praise, both for his per
formance against the Beavers and
throughout the season. With his per
formance, Luck is over 3,000 passing
yards for the season, only the fourth
Stanford quarterback to reach that
mark in a single season. His four
touchdown passes also give him 28
for the season, a total which breaks
the mark held by John Elway and
Steve Stenstrom for the most by a
Stanford quarterback in history.
Luck is also currently in the run
ning for the Heisman Trophy, pre
sented to the country's top college
football player, and Harbaugh
gushed with praise after the game.
"He's the best player, he's the

most valuable player, on maybe the
best team in the country," Harbaugh
said. "He has done everything a guy
could do in this season that plays the
quarterback position ... I really feel
like Andrew is head and shoulders
above them all.
"[He has] the quality of playing
great when the game is on the line,"
Harbaugh added later. "That quality
separates the great ones from the
very good ones. He's got it. It's an 'it'
thing, maybe, but he's got it."
However, Luck himself wasn't
quite as effusive when discussing his
candidacy.
"I don't really have an opinion on
what my chances are," he said. "My
whole philosophy toward it has been:
If I'm good enough to win it, I'll win it;
if I'm not, I'm not. I'll just let my play
do the talking."

The Stanford football team stat
ed its case for a BCS bowl berth in
emphatic fashion on Saturday night,
defeating Oregon State, 38-0, in the
final game of its regular season. The
Cardinal will now be forced to wait
for a week before learning its final
bowl destination, as the final games
of college football's regular season
don't wrap up until next weekend.
No. 6 Stanford (11-1,8-1 Pac-10)
now has the most wins in the pro
gram's history, which stretches back
to the founding of the University in
1892.
In a game that Stanford head
coach Jim Harbaugh described as
"thorough all the way around," the
Cardinal dominated the Beavers on
both sides of the ball. Stanford's of
fense rolled up yards on Oregon
State's defense, with a balanced at
tack generating yardage through the
air and on the ground.
Sophomore Stepfan Taylor led
the running attack he gained 124
yards on 14 carries, punctuated by a
long 62-yard touchdown run in the
third quarter. With his performance,
Taylor went over 1,000 yards rush
ing on the season, becoming only the
sixth Stanford back to accomplish
that feat. Overall, Stanford gained
165 yards on the ground.
