# Cardinal Care mandate for international students overturned
## 
### â€“ Cassandra Feliciano 
Stanford's international community re
sponded with resounding opposition when
changes to Cardinal Care, introduced in Feb
ruary, denied them the option to waive a
$3,000 annual fee a choice still available to
domestic students with proof of alternative
health coverage. The university's 3,200 inter
national students won the fight a month later.
In a March report by The Daily, Fabian
Sahl, a graduate student in international pol
icy studies who led the opposition to the new
healthcare policies, described these require
ments as "discriminatory because it assumes
that domestic students can better evaluate
whether their coverage is adequate or not."
Choosing to use their own insurance
providers, instead of Stanford's, had econom
ic benefits for students like Sahl, who was
covered by a German plan. He paid $2,000
less annually.
Vaden Health Center director Ira Fried
man said that although 80 percent of interna
tional students already use Cardinal Care,
the other 20 percent often encounter prob
lems such as being refused in-patient mental
health treatment or being required to trans
fer to a more distant county hospital during
emergencies.
Lobbying endeavors, which included a pe
tition with more than 500 signatures that Sahl
helped collect, compelled Vaden to revoke
the revisions to Cardinal Care for an "opt
out" choice for international students upon
the receipt of a completed form from their
personal insurance providers.
The modifications to Cardinal Care,
which also included an optional insurance
plans for the dependents of Stanford stu
dents, took effect at the beginning of this
quarter.
