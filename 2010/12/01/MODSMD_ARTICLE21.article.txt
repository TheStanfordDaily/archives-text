# Faculty studies possible ROTC return

### â€“ Kate Abbott 
In March, Professors William Perry and
David Kennedy recommended that Stanford
re-open discussions on ROTC and its place
on campus. The Faculty Senate formed an ad
hoc committee, which includes professors
and students, one an active Navy ROTC
member, to investigate the issue.
ROTC was removed from campus in 1973
after concern that the academic quality of the
program's courses did not meet Stanford's
standards. Students now travel to other uni
versities to participate. The ban against

ROTC remains in part because of the feder
al "don't ask, don't tell" policy, which the
University and many of its peer institutions
call discriminatory.
Since March, the ad hoc committee has
met several times to conduct research and
further its discussions, according to chair
Ewart Thomas. The committee sent an open
letter to the Stanford community in mid-No
vember and received fewer than 30 respons
es to its request for feedback.
Thomas said that the committee expects
to host a town hall during winter quarter that
will be open to students. It is expected to
make its recommendation in the spring of
2011.
