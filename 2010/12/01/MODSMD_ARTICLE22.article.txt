# Judicial Affairs overhauls sexual assault process
## 
### â€“ Elizabeth Titus 
In April, President Hennessy signed onto
a new pilot procedure for how Judicial Af
fairs handles sexual assault cases at Stanford.
The Board on Judicial Affairs, which devel
oped the pilot, aimed to make the process for
hearing accusations of rape, harassment, dat
ing violence and stalking among students
faster and more private.
"In every case that I have been involved
in, once the alleged victim learned about the
Judicial Affairs process, she was extremely
fearful and anxious," wrote law professor
Michele Dauber, an advocate for Judicial Af
fairs reform, in February. "Those who
pressed ahead were incredulous that this was
our process."
Among the most significant changes to
the current process is the elimination of the
requirement that alleged victims and sus
pects attend the same panel hearings during
a case and, in some instances, answer ques
tions about the alleged misconduct in each
other's presence.
The pilot will be reviewed in fall 2011. It
now overlaps with a new University review
of the Judicial Affairs office, which will in
clude the first review of the Student Judicial
Charter since its creation in 1997. Stanford
staff and external consultants will report at
the end of the school year.
