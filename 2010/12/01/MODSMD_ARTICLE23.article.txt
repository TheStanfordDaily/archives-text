## 
### â€“ Caity Monroe 
Stanford made measureable steps for
ward in financial recovery this year. In May,
Provost John Etchemendy Ph.D. 'B2 dis
cussed the University's annual budget report
for 2010-2011 with the Faculty Senate. He
highlighted that despite financial declines,
the University chose not to cut its financial
aid programs, which accounted for over half
of what the University collected in student
tuition.
Etchemendy said that some signs of re
covery could be found in the reactivation of
various construction projects around cam
pus.
In October, Stanford Management Com
pany (SMC) chief executive John Powers
highlighted this year's endowment gains, re
porting a 9.6 percent increase over the previ
ous fiscal year with a value of $13.8 billion as
of Aug. 31,2010. During the economic losses
suffered the previous year, the endowment
dropped from $17.2 billion to $12.6 billion.
SMC also announced a 14.4 percent gain by
its merged pool, the University's principal in

vestment pool.
Stanford's investment gains are also more
pronounced than those of many of its peer in
stitutions. Harvard, Yale and MIT reported
11, 8.9, and 10.2 percent investment returns,
respectively, in the year-long period that
ended June 30,2010.
