# Federal court overturns gay marriage ban
## 
### â€“ Samantha McGirr 
While California watched the state debate
over Proposition 8, Stanford took its own
role in the process, with a law school alumnus
and a professor playing key roles throughout
the year.
On Aug. 4, gay rights advocates scored a
major victory when federal judge Vaughn
Walker J.D. '7O overturned Proposition 8, the
2008 initiative banning same-sex marriage in
California. Walker, a San Francisco judge,
called the ban unconstitutional. His ruling
was appealed.
California voters narrowly approved the
ban on gay marriage in 2008, with 52 percent
voting for Proposition 8. Stanford students
overwhelmingly opposed the ban, with 87
percent voting against it, according to a 147-
person exit poll conducted by The Daily at
the Graduate Community Center on Elec
tion Day.
Gary Segura, a political science professor
who testified on the civil rights implications
at the Proposition 8 trial, said Walker's deci
sion has the "potential to be a landmark
case."
"Ultimately, if the Supreme Court up
holds Walker's decision, this could be the
most important case for gay rights," he said.
On Dec. 6, a panel of three judges will de
cide the case's fate in the U.S. Ninth Circuit
Court of Appeals. The case could be ap
pealed to the Supreme Court.
