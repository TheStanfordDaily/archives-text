# Pac- 10 expands
## 
### â€“ Kabir Sawhney 
Under new commissioner Larry Scott,
and with the approval of the presidents and
chancellors of member schools, the Pac-10
Conference aggressively pursued expansion
opportunities this summer.
The conference will be officially rebrand
ed as the Pac-12 when the two schools join in
all sports for the 2010-2011 academic year.
The biggest changes will be in football, the
sport that drove the expansion negotiations.
Next season, the Pac-12 will be split into two
divisions, North and South, and will have a
championship game in football between the
division champions, hosted by the school
with the best overall conference record.
The North division will be comprised of
Stanford, California, Oregon, Oregon State,
Washington and Washington State, while the
remaining schools USC, UCLA, Arizona,
Arizona State, Colorado and Utah will be
in the South division. Teams will play nine
conference games per season, five against di
visional opponents and four against the op
posite division. Stanford is guaranteed to
play the Southern California schools every
year, in order to preserve those rivalries.
The Pac-12 is also expected to command a
much more lucrative television deal during
the next round of negotiations, and will move
to equal revenue distribution in 2012. Stan
ford Athletics is expecting a significant in
crease from current conference payouts due

to the new deal.
