# Stanford nabs two NCAA team titles, Directors' Cup

### â€“ Jacob Jaffe 
By the end of spring, Stanford had
wrapped up two NCAA team titles, an IRA
team title and two individual titles on its way
to winning the Directors' Cup for the 16th
consecutive year.
The first championship of the season
might have been the most heartwarming, as
Stanford's men's volleyball team completed
a "worst to first" turnaround, winning the na
tional title on its home court at Maples Pavil
ion. Despite the death of longtime assistant
coach A1 Roderigues in March, the Cardinal
persevered, earning the triple distinction as
MPSF regular season champions, MPSF
Tournament champions and NCAA Tourna
ment champions. Just three years after finish
ing 3-25, Stanford men's volleyball reigned
supreme, sweeping both its NCAA Tourna
ment opponents in dominant fashion.
Next came the tennis tournaments in
Athens, Ga., where Cardinal tennis made its
presence felt. While the men's team fell in the
Sweet 16, the women could not be stopped,
earning their 16th national title with a
thrilling 4-3 victory over Florida. In individ
ual rounds, Stanford performed remarkably
well, as sophomore Bradley Klahn won the
men's single title and the duo of junior Hilary
Barte and senior Lindsay Burdette won the
women's doubles title.

The Cardinal women's lightweight crew
team won the IRA National Championships
for the first time. This summer Stanford won
the Directors' Cup as the nation's best over
all athletics program for the 16th consecutive
year.
