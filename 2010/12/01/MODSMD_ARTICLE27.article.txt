# Football goes 11-1

Stanford's football program is in the midst
of the best season in its history, reaching 11
wins for the first time ever, and is on the cusp
of its second appearance in a BCS bowl (and
the school's first-ever at-large berth). The
historic season comes in Stanford head coach
Jim Harbaugh's fourth season at the helm,
and Harbaugh has become the hottest coach
ing commodity in the country.
Stanford's season has been keyed by the
play of redshirt sophomore quarterback An
drew Luck, a leading candidate for the Heis
man Trophy and only the fourth 3,000-yard
passer in Stanford history. Another key to the
Cardinal's big year has been the much-im
proved defense. Under first-year defensive
coordinator Vic Fangio, an NFL veteran, the
defense switched to a new scheme this year,
has shut out three Pac-10 opponents and held
its last five opponents to less than 18 points
each.
The Cardinal's visit to Eugene marked its
only loss of the season, as Stanford jumped
out to an early lead but failed to contain the
Ducks' high-flying offense in the second half,
falling 52-31.
The 113 th Big Game saw Stanford break
a streak of futility against its traditional rival,
hammering the Golden Bears 48-14 in
Berkeley and taking revenge for last year's
heartbreaking home loss.
