## Housing wait list has fewer students on hold this year for rooms 
### ELLEN HUET MANAGING EDITOR 
This year's housing shuffle as stu
dents return from abroad and others
vacate for winter quarter is proceed
ing more smoothly than last year,
with fewer students who have guar
anteed housing still waiting to be as
signed a spot for winter quarter.
Since housing spots are often va
cated between the announcement of
winter housing in mid-November
and the beginning of winter quarter,
Student Housing makes ample use of
a waiting list to make sure students
receive assignments by the first week
of the quarter while leaving as few
empty beds as possible.
The waiting list this year is "fewer
than 50" guaranteed students, ac
cording to Rodger Whitney, execu
tive director of Student Housing. This
time last year, the number was closer
to 75, Whitney said.This year, 360 un
dergraduates applied for winter
quarter housing.
For students still unassigned, three
walk-in meetings are held through
out December in which students sub
mit lists of preferences and pick hous
ing as it becomes available.
Whitney said Housing anticipates
having all students who are guaran
teed housing and willing to live any
where assigned to housing by the last
meeting on Dec. 29; all guaranteed
students are required to be assigned
by the Friday of the first week of class
es.

"In recent years, the winter quar
ter assignment process has greatly
improved," Whitney wrote in an e
mail to The Daily. "By providing
space in Oak Creek and Escondido

Village, we are able to keep some
groups together, which is an option
we were unable to offer in the past."
Housing has kept the same num
ber of spaces in Oak Creek apart
ments as it did last year, Whitney said.
Currently, Oak Creek is fully as
signed.
Francisco Maravilla 'l2, who is re
turning from Florence and was as
signed to Oak Creek, said he was
"fairly satisfied" with his assignment,
"aside from the unfortunate distance
of Oak Creek from campus." Mar
avilla used a third-tier draw this year
and said that although Oak Creek
wasn't high on his list, he saw the
draw system as effective.
Unassigned students often wait
until late December to get assigned
housing, but Housing is working on
making that process faster by adding
more walk-in meetings. Whitney said
the number of students requesting
housing is closely tied to the number
of students studying overseas, and
added that Housing chooses not to
assign all students right away to leave
space for late cancellations.
"If we assigned everyone during
the first round of assignments we
would need to add additional bed
spaces and then would ultimately end

up with vacancies in the system," he
said. "Since these additional bed
spaces are often placed in common
spaces, we prefer to keep the resi
dents housed in student rooms and
keep the common spaces available to
the whole community."
