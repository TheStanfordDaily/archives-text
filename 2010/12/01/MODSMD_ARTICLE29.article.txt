## Palo Alto takes a stance on alarms 
### CAITY MONROE DESK EDITOR 
Palo Alto's city council voted to re
strict the use of ionization smoke
alarms on Nov. 8 in an effort to im
prove fire safety. This decision makes
Palo Alto the second California city to
favor photoelectric technology in de
tecting fires, following a similar deci
sion in Albany in July. Yet this move
has faced significant opposition and
debate remains about whether or not
the move actually constitutes better
fire safety practices.

While studies have shown that ion
ization alarms may be more effective
in detecting fast-starting flash fires,
they have also shown that photoelec
tric alarms do a better job of detecting
slow-burning or smoldering fires.
"Many fires start off in a smolder
ing phase," said Palo Alto Fire Mar
shal Gordon Simpkinson, who en
couraged the council to restrict the
use of ionization alarms. "Those are
the types of fires that occur late at
night when people are asleep."
Simpkinson cited studies that
show that ionization alarms will
sound an average of 15 minutes after
a photoelectric alarm in cases of smol
dering fires.
"It's a very significant difference if
you have to be able to safely get your
self out of a fire and especially if
you've got children in the home or
you've got elderly people that are
slower moving," he said. "You need
that extra time to get everybody out
safely."
Simpkinson said ionization alarms
are also more likely to produce false
alarms, or "nuisance alarms." often
triggered in kitchens by burnt food,
such alarms have negative conse
quences beyond simple irritation.
Homeowners often take the batteries
out of the alarm, and later forget to
put them back in, leaving the area
without a functioning smoke detec
tor.
"That's the main reason we advise
people to use photoelectric," Simp
kinson said. "Iliat's why they don't
have these nuisance alarms that are
happening."
Simpkinson also emphasized

other important fire safety measures,
including replacing fire alarms more
than 10 years old, checking the batter
ies of detectors currently in use and
increasing the number of alarms in
any given household.
The city council decided to require
the use of either a dual-sensor alarm
or the use of both types of alarms in
areas where nuisance activation is un
likely. In areas where nuisance activa
tion is more likely kitchens, for ex
ample the city will require photo
electric alarms only. These regulations
will apply to builders, landlords and
homeowners making major renova
tions.
But not everyone agrees that more
stringent alarm regulations will trans
late to better fire safety.
Heather Caldwell, a communica
tions manager for the company
Kidde, which produces both types of
alarms, explained the company's op
position to restricting the use of ion
ization alarms and described the dif
ferent benefits of both technologies.
"Studies have also found that...
both are effective in providing ade
quate escape time to occupants in real
life home fire conditions," she said.
Gene Gantt works for an advocacy
firm in Sacramento and is a member
of the California Fire Prevention Of
ficers. Gantt spoke on behalf of presi
dent of the Northern Section Fire Pre
vention Officers Lorin Neyer at the
Nov. 8 city council meeting and ar
gued against the restriction of the use
of the alarms.
"The concern is that if jurisdictions
on their own are banning or asking
people not to use a specific type of
technology ... we believe that's
wrong," Gantt said.
Gantt himself remains uncon
vinced by the evidence put forth by
Simpkinson and others arguing
against ionization alarms.
"Personally I question much of the
science that's being used by the pro
ponents of banning ionization smoke
detectors," he said.
The state fire marshal's office is
putting together a committee to com
pare the effectiveness of the two dif
ferent technologies. Starting in De
cember, that committee will spend six

months investigating the differences
between the alarms and coming up
with recommendations.

"Instead of knee-jerking and ban
ning the technology of ionization ...
you know, wait," Gantt said. "Sit back
and wait and see ... what the final
outcome is going to be on it."
For now, Stanford is doing just
that.
According to Rodger Whitney, ex
ecutive director of student housing,
while Stanford uses both types of
alarms, 99 percent of Stanford hous
ing's smoke detectors are ionization.
The idea that ionization alarms are
more likely to be activated by things
like burned food could ultimately be
relevant for Stanford.
"A lot of times [smoke detectors]
are activated by... burned toast...
things of that nature," he said, adding:
"We have a lot of those, particularly in
graduate housing because they have a
kitchen facility."
But Stanford Fire Marshal Joseph
Leung said that unlike Palo Alto,
Stanford will wait for the verdict from
the state fire marshal's office before
making any changes to current fire
alarm use.
Whitney said Santa Clara county
code requires ionization detectors,
but that Stanford uses some addition
al photoelectric detectors in certain
locations.
"Photoelectric smoke detectors
are occasionally recommended for
specific situations by our consultants,
and are used when the County ap
proves those plans," he wrote in an e
mail to The Daily.
Leung himself has yet to be con
vinced of the superiority of photo
electric alarms.
"In my opinion both types of de
tectors have their place. It really de
pends on what type of fire you're de
tecting they're both effective,"
Leung said. "At this point, to say that
photoelectric work better, I think it's
premature to say that. I'll wait until
the final findings of the state fire mar
shal before we decide what's best for
Stanford."
