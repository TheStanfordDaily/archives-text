## Hecker shares findings from North Korean trip 
### DEVIN BANERJEE SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
For six years, management science and
engineering professor Siegfried Hecker
has offered Stanford, Washington and the
U.S. scientific community a window into
the secretive world of North Korea's nu
clear program. The 67-year-old former di
rector of Los Alamos National Laboratory
travels as a nonofficial diplomat, returning
each time with insights, photographs and
discussion points for U.S.-North Korea re
lations.
But on Nov. 12, during his seventh visit
to the clandestine nation and his fourth to
its Yongbyon nuclear complex, Hecker
was "stunned" to find that the impover
ished state had accelerated construction of
a state-of-the-art uranium enrichment fa
cility complete with 2,000 steel-rotor cen

trifuges producing low-enriched uranium.
If enriched further, the uranium could
be used to produce nuclear weapons.
"If you enrich a little and have that ca
pability, you can easily enrich more,"
Hecker told an invite-only room Monday
at Stanford's Center for International Se
curity and Cooperation (CISAC), where
he serves as co-director. "That's really the
primary concern."
Hecker was joined on the trip by visit
ing scholar Robert Carlin and emeritus
professor John Lewis, both of CISAC.
Though their guides at Yongbyon said the
uranium will power a new light-water reac
tor to generate civilian nuclear energy, not
produce weapons, the team's findings cap
tured international attention upon their
return.
