## Hecker shares findings from North Korean trip 
### DEVIN BANERJEE SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
For six years, management science and
engineering professor Siegfried Hecker
has offered Stanford, Washington and the
U.S. scientific community a window into
the secretive world of North Korea's nu
clear program. The 67-year-old former di
rector of Los Alamos National Laboratory
travels as a nonofficial diplomat, returning
each time with insights, photographs and
discussion points for U.S.-North Korea re
lations.
But on Nov. 12, during his seventh visit
to the clandestine nation and his fourth to
its Yongbyon nuclear complex, Hecker
was "stunned" to find that the impover
ished state had accelerated construction of
a state-of-the-art uranium enrichment fa
cility complete with 2,000 steel-rotor cen

trifuges producing low-enriched uranium.
If enriched further, the uranium could
be used to produce nuclear weapons.
"If you enrich a little and have that ca
pability, you can easily enrich more,"
Hecker told an invite-only room Monday
at Stanford's Center for International Se
curity and Cooperation (CISAC), where
he serves as co-director. "That's really the
primary concern."
Hecker was joined on the trip by visit
ing scholar Robert Carlin and emeritus
professor John Lewis, both of CISAC.
Though their guides at Yongbyon said the
uranium will power a new light-water reac
tor to generate civilian nuclear energy, not
produce weapons, the team's findings cap
tured international attention upon their
return.
U.S. officials told The New York Times,
which broke the findings in a front-page
story on Nov. 20, that they think North
Korea, like Iran, will say its reactor is for
energy but will actually use it to develop
weapons.
Hecker said construction of the reactor,
which is in its early stages, is not a new find
ing, as was widely reported after the trip.
"They told us in [February] 2009 they were
going to build a light-water reactor," he
said.
The real shock came during the team's
visit to the enrichment facility, a structure
formerly used for preparing nuclear fuel
rods before North Korea dismantled it
under a 2008 agreement with the Bush ad
ministration to end its weapons program.
Between April 2009, when North Korea
expelled U.N. inspectors from the site, and
the team's visit last month, the blue-roofed
building was gutted, renovated and fitted
with 2,000 centrifuges standing six feet tall,
which enrich uranium so that it can fuel a
reactor.
"I didn't believe they would have an in
dustrial-scale facility ready and available,"
Hecker said. "We looked through the win
dows into the hall, and our jaws just
dropped."
Hecker said a North Korean official
turned to the team and said, "No one be
lieved us when we announced this in 2009,"
before looking at him and adding, "includ
ing you, Dr. Hecker."
Current assessments by Hecker and

other top scientists who have visited Yong
byon say North Korea has between eight
and 12 nuclear weapons. Despite the belief
by U.S. officials and political pundits that
the new uranium enrichment facility is the
first stage of a full-fledged weapons pro
gram, Hecker isn't worried that the facility

will be used to make bombs.
Of the two paths to a nuclear weapon
obtaining plutonium from spent reactor
fuel and enriching uranium to weapons
grade North Korea has already en
gaged in the former, and Hecker believes
that if the country's leadership were seri
ous about producing more weapons, "they
could resume all plutonium operations
within approximately six months and
make one bomb's worth of plutonium per
year for some time to come" instead of
building a uranium enrichment plant.
Yongbyon's five-megawatt gas-graphite
reactor, which was used to produce pluto
nium until it was shut down in July 2007,
"appeared dormant," Hecker wrote in a
report following his visit.
Instead, Hecker's worries are about
North Korea's ability to export nuclear
technology to other rogue states Iran
and Syria, for example. Exporting cen
trifuge technology, he says, is easier to
cloak than exporting reactor technology.
Hecker also worries about the safety of
the new reactor. Yongbyon officials told
him they conducted seismic tests on the lo
cation and have a regulatory agency on
site, but Hecker said he's "not so sure."
John Lewis, who has visited North
Korea 20 times since 1986, said Monday
that regardless of the true intent behind
developments at Yongbyon, the U.S. must

"stay the course on denuclearization."
Lewis also said American diplomats
and foreign-policy makers should not
think of North Korea as "a weapon" but
should mind the country's modernization.
Mobile phones, flat-screen TVs and per
sonal computers are booming among the
population, Lewis and Hecker said. Stu
dents are required to practice colloquial
English, and one of the factories the team
visited was even blaring American rock
music.
"What is going on is mind-blowing,"
Lewis said. "If you think sanctions are
working, forget it. This is not a country cut
off-
Lewis and Hecker believe North Korea
revealed its developments at Yongbyon
not only because they would eventually be
impossible to hide from satellite images,
but also because the country wants to
prove to the world that it is not about to
collapse. "One of the things we learned is
that we should not underestimate the
North Koreans," Hecker said.
And why reveal them to these men
specifically? "They trust us," Hecker said.
"They trust us to give an honest report.
Then they have to take their chances with
what our assessment is."

the secretive world of North Korea's nu
clear program. The 67-year-old former di
rector of Los Alamos National Laboratory
travels as a nonofficial diplomat, returning
each time with insights, photographs and
discussion points for U.S.-North Korea re
lations.
But on Nov. 12, during his seventh visit
to the clandestine nation and his fourth to
its Yongbyon nuclear complex, Hecker
was "stunned" to find that the impover
ished state had accelerated construction of
a state-of-the-art uranium enrichment fa
cility complete with 2,000 steel-rotor cen

trifuges producing low-enriched uranium.
If enriched further, the uranium could
be used to produce nuclear weapons.
"If you enrich a little and have that ca
pability, you can easily enrich more,"
Hecker told an invite-only room Monday
at Stanford's Center for International Se
curity and Cooperation (CISAC), where
he serves as co-director. "That's really the
primary concern."
Hecker was joined on the trip by visit
ing scholar Robert Carlin and emeritus
professor John Lewis, both of CISAC.
Though their guides at Yongbyon said the
uranium will power a new light-water reac
tor to generate civilian nuclear energy, not
produce weapons, the team's findings cap
tured international attention upon their
return.
U.S. officials told The New York Times,
which broke the findings in a front-page
story on Nov. 20, that they think North
Korea, like Iran, will say its reactor is for
energy but will actually use it to develop
weapons.
Hecker said construction of the reactor,
which is in its early stages, is not a new find
ing, as was widely reported after the trip.
"They told us in [February] 2009 they were
going to build a light-water reactor," he
said.
The real shock came during the team's
visit to the enrichment facility, a structure
formerly used for preparing nuclear fuel
rods before North Korea dismantled it
under a 2008 agreement with the Bush ad
ministration to end its weapons program.
Between April 2009, when North Korea
expelled U.N. inspectors from the site, and
the team's visit last month, the blue-roofed
building was gutted, renovated and fitted
with 2,000 centrifuges standing six feet tall,
which enrich uranium so that it can fuel a
reactor.
"I didn't believe they would have an in
dustrial-scale facility ready and available,"
Hecker said. "We looked through the win
dows into the hall, and our jaws just
dropped."
Hecker said a North Korean official
turned to the team and said, "No one be
lieved us when we announced this in 2009,"
before looking at him and adding, "includ
ing you, Dr. Hecker."
Current assessments by Hecker and

other top scientists who have visited Yong
byon say North Korea has between eight
and 12 nuclear weapons. Despite the belief
by U.S. officials and political pundits that
the new uranium enrichment facility is the
first stage of a full-fledged weapons pro
gram, Hecker isn't worried that the facility

will be used to make bombs.
Of the two paths to a nuclear weapon
obtaining plutonium from spent reactor
fuel and enriching uranium to weapons
grade North Korea has already en
gaged in the former, and Hecker believes
that if the country's leadership were seri
ous about producing more weapons, "they
could resume all plutonium operations
within approximately six months and
make one bomb's worth of plutonium per
year for some time to come" instead of
building a uranium enrichment plant.
Yongbyon's five-megawatt gas-graphite
reactor, which was used to produce pluto
nium until it was shut down in July 2007,
"appeared dormant," Hecker wrote in a
report following his visit.
Instead, Hecker's worries are about
North Korea's ability to export nuclear
technology to other rogue states Iran
and Syria, for example. Exporting cen
trifuge technology, he says, is easier to
cloak than exporting reactor technology.
Hecker also worries about the safety of
the new reactor. Yongbyon officials told
him they conducted seismic tests on the lo
cation and have a regulatory agency on
site, but Hecker said he's "not so sure."
John Lewis, who has visited North
Korea 20 times since 1986, said Monday
that regardless of the true intent behind
developments at Yongbyon, the U.S. must

"stay the course on denuclearization."
Lewis also said American diplomats
and foreign-policy makers should not
think of North Korea as "a weapon" but
should mind the country's modernization.
Mobile phones, flat-screen TVs and per
sonal computers are booming among the
population, Lewis and Hecker said. Stu
dents are required to practice colloquial
English, and one of the factories the team
visited was even blaring American rock
music.
"What is going on is mind-blowing,"
Lewis said. "If you think sanctions are
working, forget it. This is not a country cut
off-
Lewis and Hecker believe North Korea
revealed its developments at Yongbyon
not only because they would eventually be
impossible to hide from satellite images,
but also because the country wants to
prove to the world that it is not about to
collapse. "One of the things we learned is
that we should not underestimate the
North Koreans," Hecker said.
And why reveal them to these men
specifically? "They trust us," Hecker said.
"They trust us to give an honest report.
Then they have to take their chances with
what our assessment is."

Hecker's team saw this building transformed from a dismantled fuel fabrication
facility into an "ultra-modern" uranium enrichment plant. Inside are 2,000 cascading
centrifuges that enrich uranium to fuel an energy-generating reactor.
