# THE TRANSITIVE PROPERTY
## The Best Birthday Present Ever
### Cristopher Bautista 
Dead Week of fall quarter is always an
interesting time for me. Fall quarter
Dead Week of sophomore year, I was
going through the whole aftermath of coming
out to myself the shock, terror, elation, de
pression, disgust basically every emotion
you could possibly feel, switching from one to
another literally every half hour or so. On
Dec. 5,2008, a day I see as my trans birthday, I
finally came out to my best friends as trans
gender and decided that I would live full-time
as Cristopher starting winter quarter. You
know, it's pretty difficult to focus on finals and
essays when you're going through perhaps the
biggest self-realization of your life. Even now,
two years later, it still hurts to think about.
It's strange to think how far I've gone, al
most exactly two years later. On Thursday, I'm
finally heading over to the Superior Court in
Fremont to get my legal name change final
ized. I'll officially be Cristopher Marc Soriano
Bautista, and it'll say so on my school ID, my
school transcripts and my driver's license. I've
waited a long time for this, and to know that
I'll finally be recognized as me by the state
to say the least, I'm pretty excited.
It's also two months since I've started T. (I
did my last injection by myself. You can't call
yourself manly until you've stabbed yourself
in the thigh with a rather menacingly long and
thick needle.) In terms of physical changes, I
can't really say much at the moment, besides
that I feel hungry all the time (which was cool
at first, but now has gotten kind of annoying).

But I'm pretty much still waiting for the
testosterone to really kick in. I'm expecting
my voice to break by the time winter quarter
starts. (I'm also hoping to sport a wicked soul
patch soon, but that's probably not going to be
for a couple more months. Sadness.)
Things are getting really frustrating, too.
My brain is rewiring itself. I find that my men
tal processes are different, more intense.
Everything's still there, I'm sure of it but I
feel the T is rearranging everything in my
head, so I'm not very sure where everything is
anymore. It's going to take me a while to get
used to it again. In terms of schoolwork, things
are exasperating because I just can't focus. I
don't think the same way anymore, and I have
to get used to things. This isn't a very good
mindset to have, especially with it being Dead
Week and finals. But hopefully, I'll get through
it in one piece.
Looking back on this quarter, I probably
would have changed a couple things. To say
that I was overwhelmed this quarter would be
a huge understatement. In terms of my transi
tion, this is perhaps the busiest couple months
in my life legally changing my name and
starting testosterone were both huge events.
Not to mention I was also a resident assistant
of an all-frosh dorm and took 18 units. Should
I have dropped a class or two? Yeah. Should I
have taken a back seat when planning dorm
events? Maybe. At times I wonder if I should
have taken the quarter off altogether. But
then again, despite how stressful this quarter

has been, I've met so many
great people and done so many things that
honestly, I probably would do the same thing
over again if I had the chance.
I'll admit that part of the reason why I
wrote this column was so I would be making
goals for myself that aren't just on me, but on
everyone else. If I told not just myselfj but all
of Stanford, that I was going to the superior
court to file my name change paperwork, then
hell, I have to go to the superior court. If in one
column I promised Stanford that I would take
testosterone, then I have to schedule that ap
pointment at Vaden before my next deadline
so I could write about it.
To you as my readers, then, I have to thank
you for keeping me on schedule. I wouldn't
have taken this many steps if I had just myself
to account for. It's strange that in writing 800
words a week, I've gained a greater support
network than I could have ever imagined.
Thanks for all the e-mails. I might not have
been able to answer them all, but I've read
them all, and they've gotten me through some
tough days.
It's been a crazy ride. Thanks for everyone
for being there for me, and a special thanks to
everyone outside of the Stanford bubble who's
reading this column. I don't think I could have
a better trans birthday present. Have a good
break, everyone. See you next quarter.
