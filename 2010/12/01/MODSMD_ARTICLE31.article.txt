## Deflating the Latex Bubble 
### Judy Romea 
Earlier last week, as I was enjoying the
healthy amount of procrastination that
the Thanksgiving break afforded me, I
stumbled across a Yahoo article highlighting
what would become the source of yet another
media frenzy surrounding the Catholic Church's
controversial stance on the use of condoms. The
issue this time was the following statement made
by Pope Benedict XVI in his book-length inter
view with German journalist Peter Seewald:
"There may be a basis in the case of some
individuals, as perhaps when a male prostitute
uses a condom, where this can be a first step in
the direction of a moralization, a first assump
tion of responsibility, on the way toward recov
ering an awareness that not everything is al
lowed and that one cannot do whatever one
wants. But it is not really the way to deal with
the evil of HIV infection. That can really lie
only in a humanization of sexuality."
Taking this statement completely out of
context, several news organizations, such as the
Associated Press, Yahoo and The New York
Times, confused readers all over the world,
particularly young adults, and reignited the de
bate over college students' favorite rubber.
Within a few hours (as I, of course, continued
to procrastinate), Facebook postings by
friends at Stanford and other college campus
es of various articles with comments like "Con
troversy or hype?" or "Finally..." filled my
screen. I found myself engaging in a debate
with a complete stranger on the status of a
Facebook friend of mine at Cal State Sacra

mento. A few days later, I discovered the Scope
blog of the Stanford School of Medicine pre
sented a post entitled "Pope, plus science, offer
great news on AIDS prevention." So as I was
reading The Wall Street Journal later on that
week in an effort to avoid further procrastina
tion on my Poli Sci 1 policy brief, I was amused
to come across this headline, which seemed to
sum up the whole situation rather well: "Pope's
Comments Set Off Firestorm."
No duh.
As I continued to buy into this firestorm and
read on about the alleged controversy, it be
came clear to me: there was no controversy at
all. It was pure hype a common conse
quence of sensational journalism. The media is
depressingly fixated on Catholicism and con
dom use because it simply cannot comprehend
why or how an institution as large and power
ful as the Catholic Church could possibly con
tinue to regard contraception as immoral. But
this media fixation is one which results in mere
ly the blurring of the truth and the confusing of
the general public, including Stanford students.
So what exactly is the truth? According to
George Weigel, foreword contributor to Pope
Benedict XVl's latest book, "Light of the
World," the pope did not say that "condom use
can be justified in some cases to help stop the
spread of AIDS," as The New York Times re
ported. The Holy Father meant to say that the
use of a condom by a male prostitute infected
with AIDS is simply a step toward recognizing
the overall immorality of disordered sex, Sa-

cred Heart Major Seminary professor Janet E.
Smith argues. Recognizing that a person could
be physically harmed from such an act is a step
toward understanding that the act itself is
harmful. In this book, the pope went on to say
that the use of condoms is neither "a real nor
moral solution" to the spread of AIDS. In
stead, the surest way to avoid the spread of
HIV/AIDS is through abstinence and fidelity.
Controversial as these arguments may be,
and whether or not you agree with the
Catholic Church's teaching on sexual morality,
one thing is crystal clear: nothing has changed
in the church's teaching on contraception.
Sorry to burst everyone's latex bubbles, but the
church is far from condoning the use of con
doms. She has not, will not and cannot change
her position on condoms because the basis of
sexual moral ethic is natural law, which essen
tially does not change regardless of place, time
or public pressure. The media should try to
grasp this concept to avoid yet another ridicu
lous firestorm, and members of the general
public including Stanford students
should make sure not to confuse one state
ment from an entire book as a revolutionary
change in Catholic sexual morality.
So, all in all, last week's media frenzy was
thus just that: a frenzy a frenzy which wast
ed people's time and effort, causing people like
me to procrastinate work on my policy brief.
