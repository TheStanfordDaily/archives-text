## Don't You Wish Your IHUM Were Hot Like SLE? 
### Kristian Bailey 
My freshman experience has been vastly
different than most as, lam proud to
admit, lam one person of the roughly 5
percent of the freshman class who decided to
participate in SLE, Stanford's yearlong Struc-
tured Liberal Education program.
Having completed only one third of this 30-
week-long journey, I wanted to do a brief
"midterm" assessment of my SLExperience, in-
side and outside the classroom. Below are some
high and low points of the quarter.
1) Becoming extraordinarily and irresistibly
erudite
As one of about 90 SLEople, I clearly am al-
ready further along the path to intellectual, philo-
sophical and spiritual enlightenment than the
roughly 1,600 IHUMans in my grade. Having
conquered numerous works by Plato and Aristo-
tle, "The Odyssey," "The Bhagavad Gita" and a
few books in the Hebrew Bible, I obviously have
a firm grasp on the meaning of life.
All jokes aside, and much as I wish it were
otherwise, SLEople are not magically knowl-
edgeable individuals who know everything ever
about the world and possess all the information
necessary to navigate life without any trouble,

In fact, we have discussed the fact that being
well-read does not translate to being a better
person or living a more fulfilling life in a number
of different settings. It matters more what we do
with the information imparted from the texts,
From my position at the beginning of this
structured liberal education, it seems that SLE
equips its students to contemplate life's "big" or
"hard" questions more thoroughly and pro
vides us with multiple historical and philosoph
ical lenses through which we can view these
questions. Asking and striving to answer these
questions are what ultimately create a more
meaningful experience, both at Stanford and
beyond,
This quarter, most of our texts either sought
to define justice, good and education, or dis
cussed these topics in terms that provoked us to
consider what they really meant. These exami
nations are the big questions that I have consid
ered so far: what is justice and what does it mean
to be just? What does a good education entail?
To what degree do we have free will, or to what
degree, if any, are we working toward a fixed
destiny?
The biggest highlight of the quarter came
when I figured out the singular answer to all of

these questions! Having read a number of So
cratic dialogues, the surest thing I can say I have
learned so far is this: I know nothing. I am igno
rant about what really "is," about what the
essence of anything and everything is.
But in all honesty, recognizing that much of
what I think I know is wrong had the same effect
on me that it did on Socrates' interlocutors: it
made me curious about the truth. This inquisi
tiveness made tackling our daunting reading list
an ultimately rewarding task (despite the num
ber of times I wanted to keel over while reading
Plato's "Republic").

2) Special attention
Among the many offensive things said and
done during Gaieties, I should have been most
affronted by the number of jabs made at SLE.
Yet I and my fellow SLEeks reveled in the par
ody. Our program, which represents onlyS per
cent of the class, gained enough attention to be
come a major part of the plotline. (From what
little I understood, SLE, portrayed as a Harry
Potter cult, eventually defeated Lucifer, saving
Jesus Christ, a new freshman at Stanford, from
