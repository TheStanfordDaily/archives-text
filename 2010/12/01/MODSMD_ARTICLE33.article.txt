## SENSE AND NONSENSE Making the DREAM a Reality 
### Aysha Bagchi 
The DREAM Act (Senate Bill 729 and
House Bill 1751) could come up for a
vote as early as Thursday. If passed, the
act would allow undocumented college stu
dents and young people serving in the military
who were brought to the U.S. before the age of
16 to apply for temporary legal status with the
potential for U.S. citizenship.
The bill was first introduced by Democrat
ic and Republican Senators Richard Durban
of Illinois and Orrin Hatch of Utah in 2001, yet
nine years later, undocumented youth are still
waiting for a chance to come out of the shad
ows. House Democrats have the votes to push
the bill through before a Republican Congress
takes over in January, and if the House passes
it, moderate Republicans in the Senate will
feel political and, dare I hope, moral
pressure not to block the DREAM. This week
is a genuine chance.
The DREAM Act is a single issue that al
most inevitably gets caught up in a wider de
bate. The act would affect only 800,000 undoc
umented students in the U.S. (out of 11 million
undocumented people), but critics who are
skeptical of wider immigration reform correct
ly perceive the difficult reality: students are not
islands.They were brought to the U.S. by fami
ly members, often parents who work hard to
give their children the best lives they can. Legal
residency for the children of undocumented
people in the U.S. would make yet another
powerful argument for comprehensive immi
gration reform.
Yet opposition to broader reform is any
thing but a legitimate moral stance against the
DREAM Act, and anything but American.
The United States is predicated on some sim
ple, cherished ideals. Most centrally, it has built
its political identity on a value for the individ
ual.The U.S. has traditionally stood for the idea
that honest, industrious individuals will have
protection whenever others would do them
harm and will have tangible opportunities to
reach for their dreams. That individualistic
spirit is at the heart of the U.S.'s ability a
truly remarkable one to adamantly be ar
guing about a Guantanamo inmate's right to a
trial or the unacceptability of the death penal
ty if even one innocent person is wrongly con
victed. The United States stands for proudly
safeguarding the individual.
And yet the United States has proven will
ing, at least for these past nine years, to allow in
dividuals to be trapped in a desperate no man's
land by failing to pass the DREAM Act. To pre
vent high school valedictorians who were
brought to the U.S. as children and know no one

in their country
of birth (and
there are so
many who meet
that description)
from reaching

for their dreams is both bad economic policy
and a shameful departure from our ideals.
I was in Arizona with some other students
last March talking about immigration reform
with the deputy who works for Sheriff Joe
Arpaio. He began by saying he was against re
form, but then he kept on talking about immi
gration policy with no interruption or
prompting from his listeners and by the
end, he had talked himself into the opposite
position: some sort of pathway to legal status
for the 11 million here was the only real an
swer, but it would have to come with solutions
about future immigration and acknowledg
ment of those who have waited in line. If com
prehensive immigration reform is an obvious
one, the DREAM Act is crystal clear. If we re
flect for two moments on the status of undocu
mented students brought to the U.S. as chil
dren, there is little beyond decriminalization
that can appeal to Sarah Palin's most cherished
value for "American common sense."
I have seen President Hennessy speak on a
handful of topics at a few events over my Stan
ford career. The most encouraging, and most
human, moment I ever saw from him came the
only time I have talked with him personally,
which was in a meeting two years ago about
the DREAM Act. To our group of five stu
dents (including two Stanford DREAMers,
both of whom will be graduating in this year's
senior class but see a very different "real
world" ahead), he expressed his deep personal
support for the act and disappointment that it
had not yet been passed. After some emotion
al stories (and maybe a little prompting from
some passionate students!), he agreed to pub
licly endorse the act.
As Stanford's president perceived, the
DREAM Act is a Stanford issue and a human
one. It is not the type of thing for which we
should stand idly by. And this week, we have a
real chance. So call your representative, call the
representatives who are on the fence and tell
your peers to do the same. Let everyone know
that you support the DREAM, and that we
have a special chance these next few days to
make it a reality.
