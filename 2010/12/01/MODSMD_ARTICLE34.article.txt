Friends, as of this moment, 8:25 p.m. on
Sunday Nov. 28, 2010, my Facebook
news feed is still feeling the fallout from
the hydrogen bomb dropped on it a scant
three hours ago, a hydrogen bomb with a No.
4 painted on the side. BCS MOTHERFUCK
ERS! Facebook news feed explosions are
nothing new, but just like our defense, what
impressed me most about this particular
blowing-up was the consistency. With the ex
ception of two people who were weirdly ex
cited about "Inception" playing at FLiCKS,
every single status update from the Stanford
network was a celebration of our newfound
automatic bid-bestowing BCS ranking, a.k.a.
the reason to break my boycott of Arizona.
This is a little bit mind-blowing, because as
a whole, Stanford students don't approach
anything with this level of universal enthusi
asm. By week nine of fall quarter, you all start
to realize that the so-called Stanford commu
nity is nothing more than a giant e-mail list.
Ujamaa walks out of Gaieties but won't tell
anyone why, including the staff of the show.
That co-op or Greek organization you were
so excited about last year is fully mired in ad
ministrative drama by now. You're all about
to forsake everyone you know for the next
two weeks to study for finals because nothing
is more important than schoolwork, only to
end up convincing yourself that Robot Uni
corn Attack is actually a supplemental read
ing.

And when it's all over, there's no time to
celebrate as a student body. Our Housing
Overlords doth sayeth that your ass better be
out of their dorms by Saturday, Dec. 11 at
noon. There are no awesome campus-wide
parties, just everyone staying up until 4 a.m.
drinking and packing, with no goodbyes. You
want to go home until you remember why
you were so eager to leave for college in the
first place, and that's when the roots of that
mental health crisis that nobody wants to talk
about anymore start to take hold. It's proba
bly worth noting that the two colleges happi
er than us, according to the Princeton Review,
one of which is in Rhode Island, don't kick
their students out until the Monday after fi
nals end.
It's no wonder that by the time winter
quarter rolls around, everyone's off in their
own little world, but there's just a little bit of
hope because the Red Zone is 4,000 strong, or
60 percent of the undergraduate student
body, a percentage that is more than everyone
who's not Washington State, where there is
absolutely nothing else to do on a Saturday, or
U$C.

For the
U$C and Ari
zona games,
4,000 Stanford
students were

able to determine that their midterms next
week didn't need any more studying, that
some random lecture delivered to an empty
room wasn't more interesting and they were
able to devote four-plus hours of their time to
congregate and cheer and boo and gasp and
jump to "All Right Now" all at the same time.
On a campus where pretty much everyone
complains of a feeling of isolation, we were
able to spend four hours on a few Saturdays
living life together, and that was badass. For
those of you who still think you're too smart
to care about sports, you should know that
that sense of community is why so many of
the more pathetic/sincere parts of the country
treat football games like church.
However, if we're going to anoint football
games as the replacement for Counseling and
Psychological Services, there are going be a
few administrative issues. For one thing, you
kids missed your appointments at the Oregon
State and Washington State games. You're
still literal fair-weather fans who can't be
bothered to check the football schedule be
fore you book your return flight home. Also,
you haven't fully embraced the concept of
Football Saturday. If you really want the ac
tions of oversized men-children to be tran
scendent, you need to tune out all other dis
tractions for the entire day. I would suggest a
Four Loko if you needed assistance but...
sadf ace. Also, I admit that a preponderance of
all words uttered about football are mind
numbingly inane, and that embracing football
means accepting the humorless anachronistic
paramilitary world of college athletics at face
value, but there will always be things in life to
try your faith.
Two weeks ago, I told you that college
football was all about hate. Now I want you to
love it, but don't worry. After all, the opposite
of love is not hate, it's indifference, and sleep
deprived indifference is what I see in the eyes
of most people on this campus past week
three, and indifference is the cardinal sin in
college sports. Normally, my news feed is full
of solipsistic, dispassionate complaints about
schoolwork at this point in the quarter, but
today it's been a steady stream of the number
four. All praises due to Harbaugh. Please
don't go to Michigan.
