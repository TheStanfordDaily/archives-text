### ANGELINA CARDONA '11 ASSU President 
Recently, I received an anonymous
e-mail from a student about his
feelings of isolation and loneli
ness. He agreed to let me share informa
tion from his letter, thanking me for
speaking out about these issues. Howev
er, he should not thank me, for I and
many other students have dealt with sim
ilar feelings, and I think one of the best
things that can be done is to break the si
lence that tends to fall around these is
sues.
Freshman year, I discovered the infa
mous "Stanford duck syndrome," where
on the surface everyone looks calm but
underneath is paddling like mad to stay
afloat. I would soon discover that I, too,
was a duck.
Last year, in a blog post, a grad stu
dent wrote, "I look around at everyone
well-dressed, put together and on top
of their game, and I feel inferior. How is
it that for everyone else, this stuff is ef
fortless, but for me it's such an intense
struggle? The secret truth is, everyone is
struggling."
Like many others, there have been
times in this college whirlwind when I
have wondered how the admission of
fice thought I was on par with my
peers. There have been times when I
have felt academically inadequate,
emotionally exhausted or socially out
of place. At first, I felt alone in these
feelings, but during "Branner Spills,"
an open forum where dorm-mates
would answer any question, it became
clear that even members of my staff
had at times felt this way, too, and
shared similar fears. Their honesty and
vulnerability stuck with me.
The anonymous student wrote, "I
think I can be fun sometimes, and I sure
know a lot of people, but I don't have any
real friends... I want someone to feel
comfortable enough around me, or to
think that I'm fun enough, that they
don't feel weird about randomly getting
in touch... I feel socially awkward and
out-of-place and community-less."
In many ways, we are all ducks, but
the good news is that ducks fly together
("Mighty Ducks" reference FTW).The
best thing we can do as a community is to
be honest about our feelings and share
our triumphs and struggles. In order to
cure the "duck syndrome," when some
one asks you how you are doing, if you
feel comfortable, tell him or her the truth.
Additionally, it is important to prioritize

your life and make time for the things
you truly enjoy doing. It is all too easy to
get caught in the grind.
It is also important to recognize when
to seek help. When the problem be
comes concerning, or even to be proac
tive about your health, tap into the spec
trum of resources available. An open and
eager ear is there for you from any resi
dent assistant, community assistant, peer
health educator, residence dean, Bridge
peer counselor or Counseling and Psy
chological Services professional. These
are phenomenal resources, used by
many, that can dramatically enhance
your Stanford experience. We are also
fortunate to be supported by an admin
istration that values these issues and that
I encourage to continue to improve and
expand these services.
For those of you who are transition
ing to your first year on the Farm and
may not be sure where you fit in, you are
not alone. For those of you who are strug
gling to balance dissertations or clinical
rounds, and perhaps a family of your
own, you are not alone. For those of you
who are not yet comfortable sharing a
part of your personal identity, you are not
alone. For those of you who are com
pletely unsure of what the next step is
after graduation, you are definitely not
alone. For those of you who are going
through a situation that I may not have
mentioned here, please know that you
too are not alone.
Whether you simply read this op-ed
and put it down, or whether these words
spring you to action to call or text your
friends and acquaintances to let them
know you are there for them and care
about them, I hope you remember that
we are not alone. We are one communi
ty that shares many similar fears, hopes
and aspirations.
