# Here's the Deal
## 
### JOHN OLENCHALK A.B. '77 Stanford football team, '73-76 
Dear Harbs (and Hennessy, Board of
Trustees and Bowlsby),
First, let me thank you and congratu
late you for your historic achievements
in only four years at Stanford. You slew
Troy and walked your talk. You did
everything here in four years we thought
might take at least five to seven years, if
ever. You had the audacity of hope, the
Enthusiasm Unknown To Mankind, the
passion and the vision to make it all hap
pen, and take us from self-imposed

death's door, to BCS, even National Title
contention.
Now come the hard decisions... Do
you continue to dance with the girl who
stood behind you through all the grow
ing pains? And does she step up her
game to keep you? After all, it takes two
I, for one, if you left tomorrow, would
thank you for a great ride and restoring
our hope in the Stanford football pro
gram, and wish you well. I hope that you
stay for at least three more years and fin
ish what you started, then decide. The
other bitches will always be there, as will
the bright lights that attract them with
the promise of good times, the 100,000-
seat bling and the national media harlots
who will never show you the love you de
serve while you're here. The NFL? Real
ly? Do you want stability and quality
time for your new family? You are more
likely to get that in D-l, but the lure of
competition at the highest level probably
isn't something you can ignore forever..
. But now?
So here's the deal if Stanford
doesn't step up with a three year deal of
at least six million dollars, and I would
hope closer to eight million, then they
aren't trying hard enough and don't ap
preciate what they've got. Period. It ain't
all about the money. But it's an objective
measure of commitment.
Attendance? Jim, you have to un
derstand, Stanford's run off more fans
over the years because there's never
been a commitment to the average fan
to keep consistently competing at the
highest level possible. We still don't trust
our President and BoT to empower our
AD to take full advantage of your skill
set and our new facilities. We are like the
Oakland A's a farm club for both
management and player talent, willing
to let them leave town when their game
becomes too expensive to keep, and al
ways looking over their shoulder for the
bargain, off-price non-retail, talented
beginner. It takes time and continuity
for the fan base to come back, and it will.
Even the disadvantageous demograph
ics can be overcome once they "get it."
Of course, a more aggressive smart tar
get marketing campaign might help too.
(What other school has had, for two
years in a row, arguably the Heisman
Trophy candidate and not even the
same player?)
So it's not just your decision Jim, it's
also time for the school to chart a new
course and decide to support excellence
rather than to run another on the job
training experiment... for at least 3

more years... besides, who knows, the
place may grow on you and the grass
on the other side of the hill? It turns
brown t00...
And if Michigan comes? Follow your
heart... nobody could blame you for
that...
No matter what happens, thanks
again for all you have done.Truly magnif
icent, and against all the odds, as only we
who truly know Stanford will testify...
