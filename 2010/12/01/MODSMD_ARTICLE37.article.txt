### ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE SUBGROUP Students for a Sustainable Stanford 
Drought. Rapidly increasing con
sumption. Ever-more complex
utilities systems. Water use is
one of the most pressing issues facing
the Bay Area today. Our neighbors
across Highway 101 in East Palo Alto
are increasingly strained by water allo
cation problems. As members of Stu
dents for a Sustainable Stanford, we are
concerned about current inequities in
East Palo Alto's water supply. On Dec,
14, the San Francisco Public Utilities
Commission (SFPUC) will determine
the allocation of the Bay Area's water
supply for the next eight years. Low-in
come communities such as East Palo
Alto will likely lose out.
Historically, the burdens of water
scarcity have fallen disproportionately
on low-income and under-served com
munities. The SFPUC periodically sets
regional water allocation quotas, which
in the past have given these communities
less than their projected needs in order
to compensate for increased consump
tion across the region.
Water may be among the most
threatened resources in California, but
scarcity does not justify neglecting com
munities like East Palo Alto. As the De
cember deadline looms, concerned citi
zens must urge the SFPUC to set a
precedent for a more equitable alloca
tion of water in the Bay Area in order to
reverse past environmental injustices.
As things stand, the planned distribu
tions are in urgent need of revision.
On Sept. 30, the SFPUC released draft
guidelines detailing its water alloca
tion targets. According to the draft, the
water quotas the commission allo
cates may be far below projected need
in several low-income communities.
To use water beyond their assigned
quotas, communities would have to
pay steep fees. Under this plan, Palo
Alto expects to receive 110 percent of
its expected need, while East Palo
Alto expects to be allocated only 58
percent. If this draft goes into effect,
East Palo Alto would spend the next
eight years limited by a water alloca
tion far below what it requires.
East Palo Alto is already under
heavy economic and environmental
pressures. The median household in
come hovers at around $45,006 annual
ly, slightly more than half of San Mateo
County's median, $84,879. The city has
also endured many environmental in
justices in its past. The county dump
once resided here, as have auto disman
tling facilities, several large factories and
a hazardous-waste recycling plant
all producing pollution, pesticides, her
bicides and overall dangerous living
conditions.

Nevertheless, East Palo Alto has the
lowest per-capita water usage in the en
tire Bay Area and is a model for water
conservation strategies in low-income
communities. Many contaminated sites
have been cleaned up, the hazardous
waste plant has been dismantled and a
string of open spaces and park facilities
have appeared in recent years. The com
munity deserves to be rewarded for its
conservation efforts, not punished by
high water costs.
We in the environmental justice sub
group of Students for a Sustainable Stan
ford are advocating for fairer water allo
cation quotas in the Bay Area. The cur
rent proposal places an unfair financial
burden on East Palo Alto residents. In
other communities, such as Palo Alto, it
discourages water conservation through
excessive allocations that grant more
water than residents actually need.

Before the final decision on Dec. 14,
Students for a Sustainable Stanford is
leading an effort here on campus to pub
licize our position and to advocate for
more equitable water distribution. By
raising awareness of this issue, we also
hope to promote conservation efforts in
communities like ours that are living
with an abundance of water. To learn
more about this issue, please visit our

tion addressed to the SFPUC showing
your support for improving water alloca
tion quotas in the Bay Area.
