# LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
## Ram's Head apologizes 
### 
Dear Editor,
We, the board of directors of
Ram's Head Theatrical Society, want
to apologize to you, particularly the
Class of 2014, for any hurt caused by
this year's Gaieties. Big Game Gai
eties, a tradition dating back to 1911,
has always intended to unite the cam
pus against Berkeley, not divide Stan
ford students or make any of them
feel unwelcome. While any harm was
unintentional, Ram's Head takes full
responsibility for this year's final
product and wants to address the
community's responses in an effective
and compassionate manner.
Ram's Head would like to engage
in a dialogue with the entire Stanford
community about Gaieties of the past,
present and, most importantly, future.
It is time for our organization and the
student body to re-evaluate the place
of Gaieties in the Stanford experience.
Next quarter, we will hold a town hall
meeting to discuss where this year's
Gaieties caused hurt and how we can
refocus for next year and beyond. We
invite all members of the community
to join us, but especially those students
who have been personally offended.
Ram's Head is committed to address
ing the impact of this year's show and
to redefining the Gaieties experience
for all those involved.
We believe that, above all, Gaieties
is an event for the Stanford communi
ty, a humorous love letter to this uni
versity and the amazing students who
give it its heart. We apologize for
alienating members of the communi
ty this year, and we thank you for your
willingness to share your opinions
and ideas with us about the future of
this Stanford tradition.
