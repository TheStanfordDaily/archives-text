# Keep it going

### 
Dear Editor,
I woke up Sunday morning, fol
lowing Stanford's resounding victory
over Oregon State, to find Stanford
with a record of 11-1 its best ever
record in football. As I absorbed the
historic magnitude of this accom
plishment for Stanford football, I re
alized that Stanford's international
reputation as an elite academic insti

tution was fully intact.
Despite reaching the pinnacle of
college football success, there hadn't
been the slightest diminution in Stan
ford's academic standing or prestige.
Moreover, as I delved further into the
impact of this remarkable achieve
ment in college athletics, I discovered a
student body and alumni that thor
oughly rejoiced in the accomplish
ment, as well as beamed with profound
pride in their beloved university.
I said to myself, "Wow, it is possi
ble, and even a good thing, for Stan
ford to be successful in football." In
stead of detracting from Stanford's
elite academic standing, football has,
in fact, enhanced the institution and
its family of students, faculty, alumni
and friends. Stanford has always ex
celled and been best in class in every
thing it does, and there is no reason
why that shouldn't apply to football.
Let's hope we keep it going. Re
taining Coach Harbaugh will go a
long way toward sustaining this excel
lence.
