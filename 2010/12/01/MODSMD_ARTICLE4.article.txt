## Ujamaa walks out of Gaieties show 
### ELLEN HUET MANAGING EDITOR 
In response to content they found offensive and insensitive,
four staff members and 32 residents of Ujamaa walked out of the
last Gaieties performance of Big Game Week on Nov. 19,
prompting plans of talks between the two parties to discuss con
cerns and how to move forward.
Ujamaa resident assistant (RA) Robbie Zimbroff 'l2 called
the portrayals of certain characters in the show "limited," saying
they "made people feel undervalued" and didn't fairly represent
the Stanford community. Zimbroff and Yvorn Aswad-Thomas
'll, another Ujamaa RA, pointed to the show program's "lexi
con" list, portrayals of Native Americans as visibly intoxicated
and an ad-libbed line about dressing up for a party as "Rosa-
Parks black" as a few examples that led to the group walking out
of the performance about 45 minutes into the show.
But both Zimbroff and Aswad-Thomas said it wasn't just spe
cific moments but an overall inappropriate attitude that the
walkout meant to highlight.
