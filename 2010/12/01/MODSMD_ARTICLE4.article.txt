## Ujamaa walks out of Gaieties show 
### ELLEN HUET MANAGING EDITOR 
In response to content they found offensive and insensitive,
four staff members and 32 residents of Ujamaa walked out of the
last Gaieties performance of Big Game Week on Nov. 19,
prompting plans of talks between the two parties to discuss con
cerns and how to move forward.
Ujamaa resident assistant (RA) Robbie Zimbroff 'l2 called
the portrayals of certain characters in the show "limited," saying
they "made people feel undervalued" and didn't fairly represent
the Stanford community. Zimbroff and Yvorn Aswad-Thomas
'll, another Ujamaa RA, pointed to the show program's "lexi
con" list, portrayals of Native Americans as visibly intoxicated
and an ad-libbed line about dressing up for a party as "Rosa-
Parks black" as a few examples that led to the group walking out
of the performance about 45 minutes into the show.
But both Zimbroff and Aswad-Thomas said it wasn't just spe
cific moments but an overall inappropriate attitude that the
walkout meant to highlight.

Members of the Stanford Band watch the dress rehearsal for this year's Gaieties,
"The Last Temptation of Cal." Residents and staff from Ujamaa walked
out of the show's performance on Nov. 19 after 45 minutes.
"A lot of content throughout the
show was insensitive and put off a lot of
kids," Zimbroff said. Aswad-Thomas
added that the show was "alienating,"
saying it "showed a kind of blindness we
have when engaging in issues of diversi
ty ... a lot of residents felt strongly of
fended by the images in the show."
This year's Gaieties producer,
Rachel Lindee 'l2, emphasized that the
lexicon spoofed on all groups on cam
pus, not just selected ones, and that in
writing and editing the script for the
show, she and director Emily Goldwyn
' 11 focused on being mindful of the "fine
line" between Gaieties' tradition of
being a "politically incorrect, hilariously
over-the-top musical extravaganza," ac
cording to the Ram's Head Theatrical
Society website, and being unnecessari
ly offensive.
"It was important for us that while
our show crosses boundaries, as is tradi
tion of Gaieties, it did not overstep them

in a hurtful or mean-spirited manner,"
Lindee wrote in an e-mail to The Daily.
The Ram's Head board of directors
has been in talks with Ujamaa staff and
has scheduled a meeting to discuss con
cerns, Lindee said. In a letter to the edi
tor of The Daily, the board apologized
for offending audience members and
said it would hold a town hall in winter
quarter on the same topic.
Zimbroff and Aswad-Thomas were
both in favor of continued talks.
"We don't want this to have been a
passive disagreement," Zimbroff said.
"The goal is to have people reflect on
their own and collective ways we can
create and reshape the understanding
of the Stanford community."
"Gaieties is meant to unite Stanford
together," Aswad-Thomas added.
"How can it achieve that goal if people
don't want to go to this show because
they feel they won't be represented?"
Before being performed, the script
for Gaieties undergoes approval by the
Ram's Head board and various Univer
sity officials. This year, according to
Lindee, the script was sent to Dean of
Religious Life Scotty McLennan and to
"an ASSU officer who had a cameo in

the show."
Zimbroff added that he felt it was the
responsibility of the administration to
reflect on the issue.
Zimbroff and Aswad-Thomas felt
the show's portrayals of certain groups
could be damaging to diversity efforts
on campus, especially to freshmen, but
Lindee said the show addresses diversi
ty in its own way.
"The fact of the matter is that dis
turbing and divisive stereotypes do exist
on campus," she said. "The way Gaieties
deals with them is by portraying these
stereotypes in an outlandishly over-the
top manner, not only to generate discus
sion, but also to combat them by unify
ing the entire student body through
laughter." Lindee also added that Gai
eties strives to be "even-handed" in its
portrayals, making an effort not to ex
clude or include any group unfairly.
But intentions are separate from
perceptions, Aswad-Thomas noted.
"The words I use might seem funny,
but some of my fellow Cards might not
see it that way," he said.
