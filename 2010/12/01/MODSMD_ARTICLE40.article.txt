# Don't soak the coach
## 
### 
Dear Editor,
As a proud Stanford alumna and
staff member, it was a thrill to rush the
field after Saturday's victory over
Oregon State and bask in the Cardi
nal's glorious 11-1 season.
Yet amid the throngs of celebrants,
there was one noticeable absence in
the moments after the victory: heroic
head coach Jim Harbaugh, who had
to make a quick getaway after getting
doused with ice water on an indis
putably frigid Palo Alto night.
Sure, the players meant it as a com
pliment. But the fallout was that a
chilled Harbaugh couldn't stick
around to celebrate with his fans and
players, let alone have his moment to
shine under flashbulbs and cameras.
Harbaugh's rushed reaction was
n't sour grapes, just sound judgment.
(Some may recall the death of former
Long Beach State coach George
Allen in 1990, which was linked to a
Gatorade "victory bath.")
When Stanford wins at the Fiesta
Bowl, the Rose Bowl or wherever fate
takes the Cardinal to cap this magical
season, let's see the team hoist Har
baugh on its shoulders and carry him
off the field so he can soak up the
glory, not the Gatorade.
