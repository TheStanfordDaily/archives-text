## Taking Five on the Farm Coterming means time for academic depth and a fresh take on campus life 
### CHRISTINA BROW 
Undergraduate students and gradu
ate students form two distinct seg
ments of the Stanford student
population. But for coterminal
degree students, the line is less
clearly defined.
() "We're kind of like pseudo-grad stu
dents," said Nikil Viswanathan 'll, who is
pursuing a master's degree in computer
science. "Academically, we take grad courses.
But socially we are still very much tied to the
undergrad community."

Viswanathan and students like him
aren't alone in their decision to coterm.
According to Celeste Fowles Nguyen,
assistant in degree programs in the Uni
versity registrar's office, approximately

427 students were approved to coterm
during 2009-2010.

The coterminal degree program at
Stanford allows undergraduates to work

on master's degrees while they com
plete their Stanford bachelor's de
grees. According to associate dean
of Undergraduate Advising and
Research (UAR) Randy Williams,

coterming gives students an opportunity
to pursue advanced studies in an academic in
terest.
Many students choose to coterm with
their career goals in mind.
Maya Mathur 'l3, for example, plans
to coterm in statistics after completing
an undergraduate major in psychology.
"Stats and psych go really well together,"

Mathur said. "An M.A. in stats will help me as an empir
ical psychologist who needs a solid stats background."
Similarly, Sean Ramey 'll, is planning to coterm next

year in mechanical engineering with a focus on control
systems. He hopes his degree will further prepare him
for a career in defense systems and robotics.
"The engineering coterm is a continuation of under
grad years with classes that are like job training," Ramey
said. "You develop new skills and take classes that focus
on your interest."
Although many coterms admitted that an M.A. has
the potential to yield monetary benefits, students also
choose to coterm because they don't want their intel
lectual career to end with their undergraduate diplo
ma.

Teresa Robbins 'll, who completed her undergradu
ate degree at Stanford in biology, decided to coterm in
Latin American studies because she always had a strong
interest in Mexican immigration and culture.
"I want to help some of the Mexican population as a
doctor and explore another field of study besides sci
ence," Robbins said.
Lance Choy, director of the Career Development
Center (CDC), said a coterm can sometimes yields ben
efits in the job search. However, both Williams and Choy
said a coterm is not necessarily a student's best choice.
Williams suggested that in some cases, an honors thesis
or a graduate program might be more appropriate.
"There are many factors one must take into account
when deciding to coterm," Choy said, citing career, value
of education and academic interests as possible factors.
According to Judith Romero, a spokeswoman for the
School of Law, students should avoid approaching a
coterm degree as a resume booster.
"You should base your decision on the merits of the
program as it relates to your area of interest and what
you intend to do with the degree," Romero said in an e
mail to The Daily. "Don't take it on because you think it
will give you a leg up in the admissions process."

Coterm: An Undergrad or Grad?
Even though coterms are not technically undergrads
in their fifth year, this doesn't stop them from participat

ing in undergraduate student life. Viswanathan still
spends time with undergraduates as a resident assistant
(RA) in the freshman dorm Soto.
"I still see a lot of my undergraduate friends very
often through various activities such as captaining our
IM Frisbee team... by going to football games and by
eating at Row houses," Viswanathan said.
James Chu 'll, who is coterming in sociology, also re
mains connected to undergraduate life through his
staffing position in the EAST residence.
"I'm still in dorm housing, so it feels just like an un
dergrad [experience]," Chu said.
To Robbins, one of the perks of coterming is having a
flexible schedule. She is not a member of as many activ
ities as she was during her undergraduate years, which al
lows her more free time to focus on activities like Habla,
Stanford Immigrant Rights Project and having fun on
weekends.
Some coterms feel closer to the graduate student
community. Robbins said her social life is more like that
of a graduate student's.
"Since I'm not a senior, I don't have all of these social
obligations, like pub nights and parties," Robbins said.
Many coterms make a point of remaining close to
friends from their Stanford years. "When I coterm, I
plan to live in Munger with my draw group, who are also
coterming," Ramey said.
Viswanathan described how coterms seem to feel less
academic pressure than grad students.
"We coterms tend to look really happy while gradu
ate students look stressed and sad," he said.
While some coterms end their undergraduate careers
and begin a new chapter, others consider themselves un
dergraduates with more time. What coterms do seem to
agree on is that they are fortunate to have been both un
dergraduate and coterminal students at Stanford.
"We are super lucky to have good friends around
campus and know what's going on," Viswanathan said.
