Tnside a fourth-floor room
on the Quad, bookshelves
overflow to the floor,
where literature mingles

M with black
boxes from
archives around
the country.
Above the
hodgepodge is a
corkboard with
nametags, pho
tos and its most
precious item: a

handmade award for "Best
Dad." Communication profes
sor Fred Turner sat behind a
desk next to the window, gazing
through the window at Memori
al Church, his "favorite place on
campus, without question."
Turner's shelves are stacked
with books from graduate
school, books he has taught from
and others he is referencing for
the book he is writing. The topics
in his collection range from so
cial psychology to 1930s Ger-

many to World War II and the
Cold War and then move into
the 1950s and 19605, where there
"was a lot of art oriented around
perception, and about changing
your perception so as to free
your soul," he said.
A handful of colorful books
from the 1940s to 1960s stand
out from the others. They help
inspire Turner during the six
hours every day he spends writ
ing about history.
"The thing about doing his
torical writing and research is
that everyone you are writing
about is dead and so it feels a lit
tle bit like writing about ghosts,"
he said. "Except when you keep
things like this around, you re
member those ghosts once
walked the earth, and they make
them more real for you."
At one point, he stopped and
picked out a book from the shelf,
Charles Morris' "The Open
Self."
"[This is] one of my favorite
books, about trying to free peo
ple to live in a much more ...
racially, gender-wise, religiously,
diverse society in 1948, which
is a time we associate with kind
of being closed down," he said.
Also in his collection is Turn
er's latest book,"From Counter
culture to Cyberculture: Stewart

Brand, the Whole Earth Net
work, and the Rise of Digital
Utopianism," which explores
how the computer, associated
with the terrors of war, was
frightening in the 19605, but be
came a tool for the creation of
Utopian ideas in the 19905. The
book he is currently writing is a
prequel to this one, focusing on
how "the rebellion against mass
media technologies and the
fears that mass media would
make us fascists in the 1930s ...
[evolved] into the psychedelia of
the 19605."

A Journalist in a Sea of Change
Turner earned his bachelor's
degree in English and American
literature from Brown Universi
ty and his master's in English
from Columbia. Shortly after
graduating from Columbia, he
took off for Berlin, where he
worked as a lighting technician
at a punk theatre and gave Eng
lish lessons. Not particularly sat
isfied with that occupation, he
returned to the United States to
work as a freelance journalist in
Boston from 1986 to 1996. He
wrote for The Boston Globe
Sunday Magazine, Providence
Business News and The Boston
Phoenix, among other publica
tions.
In 1989, while covering a
story about an American sup
port movement for the Chinese
students in Tiananmen Square,
he felt that the story he was cov
ering concerned a big cultural

event in China that he could not
touch on in his 750 words of
daily reporting.
"As a journalist, I got to be a
really good sailor," Turner said,
offering a metaphor for his early
career. "I got to watch the chop
on the water really well, I could
always see where the little
waves were coming, little trend
here, little movement there, but
I always had the feeling that
there were these lower, slower,
deeper, cultural currents way
down below and I slowly began
to realize that I kind of wanted
to be an oceanographer, not a
sailor."
The self-insight led him to
slow down his news-writing ca
reer and write a book, "Echoes
of Combat: Trauma, Memory,
