# Writing of the past, reading into the future
## Fred Turner reflects on cultural history, discusses creative destruction in journalism

sor Fred Turner sat behind a
desk next to the window, gazing
through the window at Memori
al Church, his "favorite place on
campus, without question."
Turner's shelves are stacked
with books from graduate
school, books he has taught from
and others he is referencing for
the book he is writing. The topics
in his collection range from so
cial psychology to 1930s Ger-

many to World War II and the
Cold War and then move into
the 1950s and 19605, where there
"was a lot of art oriented around
perception, and about changing
your perception so as to free
your soul," he said.
A handful of colorful books
from the 1940s to 1960s stand
out from the others. They help
inspire Turner during the six
hours every day he spends writ
ing about history.
"The thing about doing his
torical writing and research is
that everyone you are writing
about is dead and so it feels a lit
tle bit like writing about ghosts,"
he said. "Except when you keep
things like this around, you re
member those ghosts once
walked the earth, and they make
them more real for you."
At one point, he stopped and
picked out a book from the shelf,
Charles Morris' "The Open
Self."
"[This is] one of my favorite
books, about trying to free peo
ple to live in a much more ...
racially, gender-wise, religiously,
diverse society in 1948, which
is a time we associate with kind
of being closed down," he said.
Also in his collection is Turn
er's latest book,"From Counter
culture to Cyberculture: Stewart

Brand, the Whole Earth Net
work, and the Rise of Digital
Utopianism," which explores
how the computer, associated
with the terrors of war, was
frightening in the 19605, but be
came a tool for the creation of
Utopian ideas in the 19905. The
book he is currently writing is a
prequel to this one, focusing on
how "the rebellion against mass
media technologies and the
fears that mass media would
make us fascists in the 1930s ...
[evolved] into the psychedelia of
the 19605."

A Journalist in a Sea of Change
Turner earned his bachelor's
degree in English and American
literature from Brown Universi
ty and his master's in English
from Columbia. Shortly after
graduating from Columbia, he
took off for Berlin, where he
worked as a lighting technician
at a punk theatre and gave Eng
lish lessons. Not particularly sat
isfied with that occupation, he
returned to the United States to
work as a freelance journalist in
Boston from 1986 to 1996. He
wrote for The Boston Globe
Sunday Magazine, Providence
Business News and The Boston
Phoenix, among other publica
tions.
In 1989, while covering a
story about an American sup
port movement for the Chinese
students in Tiananmen Square,
he felt that the story he was cov
ering concerned a big cultural

event in China that he could not
touch on in his 750 words of
daily reporting.
"As a journalist, I got to be a
really good sailor," Turner said,
offering a metaphor for his early
career. "I got to watch the chop
on the water really well, I could
always see where the little
waves were coming, little trend
here, little movement there, but
I always had the feeling that
there were these lower, slower,
deeper, cultural currents way
down below and I slowly began
to realize that I kind of wanted
to be an oceanographer, not a
sailor."
The self-insight led him to
slow down his news-writing ca
reer and write a book, "Echoes
of Combat: Trauma, Memory,


Turner
and the Vietnam War" chronicling
how Americans remember the
Vietnam War. After watching it sell
relatively lethargically, "like an aca
demic book," Turner concluded he
had a more academic mind than a
journalistic one and decided to pur
sue a doctorate in communication
at UC-San Diego. Before joining
Stanford as a faculty member in
2003, he taught communication at
Harvard's John F. Kennedy School
of Government and at MlT's Sloan
School of Management.
Today, Turner dips his toes in
many fields: He is the Department
of Communication's director of un
dergraduate studies and an associ
ate professor in the Department of
Art and Art History, by courtesy,
and affiliated faculty in the Depart
ments of American Studies, Mod
ern Thought and Literature, Sci
ence, Technology and Society
(STS), Symbolic Systems and
Urban Studies.
He is set to take on a new role
starting next fall as the director of
the STS program. His most imme
diate plans for the department are
"to build on the intersection of cul
tural and social thought with sci
ence and engineering thought
that's been the hallmark of [STS]
for 20 years."

"Think about where we're liv
ing,"Turner said. "We're in the mid
dle of Silicon Valley. This region
right now is changing culture
around the world in away that
maybe London changed it in the
18th century or New York changed
it in the 19th century. The things
that are being built around us are
changing the way we interact... I
mean, we are sitting 100 yards from
where the first Google algorithms
were written."
"That's an intersection that stu
dents need to know about to be lib

erally educated in the 21st century,"
he added.
Turner described examples like
the website eHarmony.com, which
"transform the process of falling in
love into a process of applying, cre
ating yourself as a brand . . . turn
ing yourself literally into a product.
That's a really interesting phenom
ena and that's something that we
need to be studying here,"
Turner believes that different
disciplines have much to learn from
one another. He emphasized
"thinking about what it means to be
human in a highly technological
era."
"There are modes of teaching
and learning that are deployed in
each context that are rarely de
ployed in others," he said.
Overall, Turner wants to "see
technology and science taken more
seriously as agents of cultural
change by humanists" while having
the "rich humanistic tradition of
thinking about what it means to be
a person brought into discussions
about how we design things and
what we design things for."
Turner on Technology
One effect of the interactions
between humans and technology is
especially close to Turner's heart:
how digital media is transforming
the newspaper.
"When I was working as a jour
nalist, I wrote many of my stories . .
. on a typewriter," Turner said.
"You had to bring your work into
the office or use a telephone to call
it in."
Turner expressed some hope for
the technological transformation of
journalism because it allows news
to be gathered, produced and dis
tributed "almost simultaneously"
by any individual. He believes that
this allows more people to speak
about important public issues, but
that at the same time established
brick-and-mortar newspapers are
suffering to the detriment of society.
The Boston Phoenix, one of the
papers Turner wrote for in the

1980s and 19905, used to have 120
pages. Today, it has 33. For Turner,
large print newspapers withering
away means "highly qualified pub
lic discourse by expert social critics,
expert artistic critics, critics of film,
of the arts, of music, tends to disap
pear from public discourse."
"If you called a source and said,
'Hi, this is Fred Turner from The
Boston Phoenix,' they actually paid
attention to you," he said.
Thinking back to Watergate,
Turner said that the current trend
in news moving away from
strong media institutions that once
had resources to monitor the gov
ernment and big businesses
causes journalism to lose some of
its power.
"If [Woodward and Bernstein]
hadn't had The Washington Post's
money and prestige and ability to
publicize their case behind them, if
they hadn't had The Washington
Post's lawyers, Nixon could have
run them out of town."
"If you're going to do journalism
that is watchdog work, if your job is
to afflict the comfortable and com
fort the afflicted, then you need to
be able to cover large institutions
with big resources, like the Penta
gon, like big businesses," he added.
"Single people can't do that."
And as a single individual pon
dering the fate of print media, even
Turner needs a break.
Around 10 a.m., Turner pushes
back from his keyboard and walks
to Memorial Church, occasionally
stepping in to listen to the organist
practicing. While leaving, he likes to
take a look at the four words in
scribed on the facade's mural: love,
faith, hope and charity.
"It's a nice counterpoint to some
of the other things in Silicon Valley,
which might include ambition,
greed," he said. '"Love, faith, hope
and charity' strikes me as a pretty
good motto, and I like to go read it
about once a day."

Utopianism," which explores
how the computer, associated
with the terrors of war, was
frightening in the 19605, but be
came a tool for the creation of
Utopian ideas in the 19905. The
book he is currently writing is a
prequel to this one, focusing on
how "the rebellion against mass
media technologies and the
fears that mass media would
make us fascists in the 1930s ...
[evolved] into the psychedelia of
the 19605."

A Journalist in a Sea of Change
Turner earned his bachelor's
degree in English and American
literature from Brown Universi
ty and his master's in English
from Columbia. Shortly after
graduating from Columbia, he
took off for Berlin, where he
worked as a lighting technician
at a punk theatre and gave Eng
lish lessons. Not particularly sat
isfied with that occupation, he
returned to the United States to
work as a freelance journalist in
Boston from 1986 to 1996. He
wrote for The Boston Globe
Sunday Magazine, Providence
Business News and The Boston
Phoenix, among other publica
tions.
In 1989, while covering a
story about an American sup
port movement for the Chinese
students in Tiananmen Square,
he felt that the story he was cov
ering concerned a big cultural

event in China that he could not
touch on in his 750 words of
daily reporting.
"As a journalist, I got to be a
really good sailor," Turner said,
offering a metaphor for his early
career. "I got to watch the chop
on the water really well, I could
always see where the little
waves were coming, little trend
here, little movement there, but
I always had the feeling that
there were these lower, slower,
deeper, cultural currents way
down below and I slowly began
to realize that I kind of wanted
to be an oceanographer, not a
sailor."
The self-insight led him to
slow down his news-writing ca
reer and write a book, "Echoes
of Combat: Trauma, Memory,


Turner
and the Vietnam War" chronicling
how Americans remember the
Vietnam War. After watching it sell
relatively lethargically, "like an aca
demic book," Turner concluded he
had a more academic mind than a
journalistic one and decided to pur
sue a doctorate in communication
at UC-San Diego. Before joining
Stanford as a faculty member in
2003, he taught communication at
Harvard's John F. Kennedy School
of Government and at MlT's Sloan
School of Management.
Today, Turner dips his toes in
many fields: He is the Department
of Communication's director of un
dergraduate studies and an associ
ate professor in the Department of
Art and Art History, by courtesy,
and affiliated faculty in the Depart
ments of American Studies, Mod
ern Thought and Literature, Sci
ence, Technology and Society
(STS), Symbolic Systems and
Urban Studies.
He is set to take on a new role
starting next fall as the director of
the STS program. His most imme
diate plans for the department are
"to build on the intersection of cul
tural and social thought with sci
ence and engineering thought
that's been the hallmark of [STS]
for 20 years."

"Think about where we're liv
ing,"Turner said. "We're in the mid
dle of Silicon Valley. This region
right now is changing culture
around the world in away that
maybe London changed it in the
18th century or New York changed
it in the 19th century. The things
that are being built around us are
changing the way we interact... I
mean, we are sitting 100 yards from
where the first Google algorithms
were written."
"That's an intersection that stu
dents need to know about to be lib

erally educated in the 21st century,"
he added.
Turner described examples like
the website eHarmony.com, which
"transform the process of falling in
love into a process of applying, cre
ating yourself as a brand . . . turn
ing yourself literally into a product.
That's a really interesting phenom
ena and that's something that we
need to be studying here,"
Turner believes that different
disciplines have much to learn from
one another. He emphasized
"thinking about what it means to be
human in a highly technological
era."
"There are modes of teaching
and learning that are deployed in
each context that are rarely de
ployed in others," he said.
Overall, Turner wants to "see
technology and science taken more
seriously as agents of cultural
change by humanists" while having
the "rich humanistic tradition of
thinking about what it means to be
a person brought into discussions
about how we design things and
what we design things for."
Turner on Technology
One effect of the interactions
between humans and technology is
especially close to Turner's heart:
how digital media is transforming
the newspaper.
"When I was working as a jour
nalist, I wrote many of my stories . .
. on a typewriter," Turner said.
"You had to bring your work into
the office or use a telephone to call
it in."
Turner expressed some hope for
the technological transformation of
journalism because it allows news
to be gathered, produced and dis
tributed "almost simultaneously"
by any individual. He believes that
this allows more people to speak
about important public issues, but
that at the same time established
brick-and-mortar newspapers are
suffering to the detriment of society.
The Boston Phoenix, one of the
papers Turner wrote for in the

1980s and 19905, used to have 120
pages. Today, it has 33. For Turner,
large print newspapers withering
away means "highly qualified pub
lic discourse by expert social critics,
expert artistic critics, critics of film,
of the arts, of music, tends to disap
pear from public discourse."
"If you called a source and said,
'Hi, this is Fred Turner from The
Boston Phoenix,' they actually paid
attention to you," he said.
Thinking back to Watergate,
Turner said that the current trend
in news moving away from
strong media institutions that once
had resources to monitor the gov
ernment and big businesses
causes journalism to lose some of
its power.
"If [Woodward and Bernstein]
hadn't had The Washington Post's
money and prestige and ability to
publicize their case behind them, if
they hadn't had The Washington
Post's lawyers, Nixon could have
run them out of town."
"If you're going to do journalism
that is watchdog work, if your job is
to afflict the comfortable and com
fort the afflicted, then you need to
be able to cover large institutions
with big resources, like the Penta
gon, like big businesses," he added.
"Single people can't do that."
And as a single individual pon
dering the fate of print media, even
Turner needs a break.
Around 10 a.m., Turner pushes
back from his keyboard and walks
to Memorial Church, occasionally
stepping in to listen to the organist
practicing. While leaving, he likes to
take a look at the four words in
scribed on the facade's mural: love,
faith, hope and charity.
"It's a nice counterpoint to some
of the other things in Silicon Valley,
which might include ambition,
greed," he said. '"Love, faith, hope
and charity' strikes me as a pretty
good motto, and I like to go read it
about once a day."

Tnside a fourth-floor room
on the Quad, bookshelves
overflow to the floor,
where literature mingles

M with black
boxes from
archives around
the country.
Above the
hodgepodge is a
corkboard with

precious item: a

handmade award for "Best
Dad." Communication profes
sor Fred Turner sat behind a
desk next to the window, gazing
through the window at Memori
al Church, his "favorite place on
campus, without question."
Turner's shelves are stacked
with books from graduate
school, books he has taught from
and others he is referencing for
the book he is writing. The topics
in his collection range from so
cial psychology to 1930s Ger-

many to World War II and the
Cold War and then move into
the 1950s and 19605, where there
"was a lot of art oriented around
perception, and about changing
your perception so as to free
your soul," he said.
A handful of colorful books
from the 1940s to 1960s stand
out from the others. They help
inspire Turner during the six
hours every day he spends writ
ing about history.
"The thing about doing his
torical writing and research is
that everyone you are writing
about is dead and so it feels a lit
tle bit like writing about ghosts,"
he said. "Except when you keep
things like this around, you re
member those ghosts once
walked the earth, and they make
them more real for you."
At one point, he stopped and
picked out a book from the shelf,
Charles Morris' "The Open
Self."
"[This is] one of my favorite
books, about trying to free peo
ple to live in a much more ...
racially, gender-wise, religiously,
diverse society in 1948, which
is a time we associate with kind
of being closed down," he said.
Also in his collection is Turn
er's latest book,"From Counter
culture to Cyberculture: Stewart

Brand, the Whole Earth Net
