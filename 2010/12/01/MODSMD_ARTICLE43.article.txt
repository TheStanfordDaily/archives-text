# Questioning DADT

£ -w —on't ask, don't tell"
(DADT) was a compro
■ mise implemented during
the Clinton Administration
M amid a debate over the role
of gays in the military, limiting the military's
ability to ask service members about their sex
ual orientation but allowing for gay members'
discharge if such information came to light.
Nearly two decades later, the policy is drawing
fire on Capitol Hill and on Stanford's campus.
"I have a number of good friends who are
gay who have been ex-officers in the military,
who have been kicked out," said political sci
ence graduate student Jim Golby, who is also a
major in the U.S. Army. "And I think it's a
shame."
Since 1993, approximately 14,000 gay men
and women have been discharged due to their
sexual orientation, according to The New York
Times. When the policy was instated, support
for openly gay service members was low.
But now, as the debate over the status of gay
service members heats up again, polls for the
first time suggest public support for a more
open policy. And on Tuesday, a new Pentagon
study reported the risk to the military's effec
tiveness by repealing the policy is low.
Law professor Jane Schacter explained typi

cal arguments on both sides of the debate.
Proponents of the policy place "special em
phasis on the need for units, especially in com
bat, to be tightly bonded and unified" she said.
"They have also argued that civilians should
defer to the judgments of military officials on
this question because they have a better under
standing of the special characteristics of the
military."
The policy's opponents argue that "preju
dice drives these arguments, not data or evi
dence," Schacter said. They "have pointed to
militaries around the world that have success
fully integrated openly gay soldiers .. . and said
the military is, in fact, harmed by the loss of the
many well-qualified gay soldiers."
Several gay service members have filed law
suits since DADT was enacted. They have ar
gued the policy is unconstitutional because it
violates equal protection, due process and the
First Amendment, Schacter said.
None of these lawsuits has prompted broad
changes in policy, but "a few recent decisions
may signal a new direction," Schacter added.
California District Court Judge Virginia
Phillips wrote recently that the policy "in
fringes the fundamental rights of United States
service members" and violates their rights of
due process and freedom of speech.
The ruling is being appealed. Meanwhile, the
Supreme Court has ruled that the policy will re
main in effect while the appeal proceeds.

But some changes in the policy's implemen
tation are materializing. In a federal district
court case in Washington, it was ruled "uncon
stitutional to discharge [Maj.] Margaret Witt
from the military" Schacter said.
The judge "employed a new standard that
the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals had im
posed, requiring the military to show specific
proof that the individual gay soldier discharged
had undermined military effectiveness or unit
cohesion," Schacter added.
On Stanford's campus, students fall on both
sides of the issue.
"If a corporation in the United States had a
policy like this they would be roundly criti
cized," wrote sophomore Dan Thompson in an
e-mail to The Daily. "It's even worse that this
discrimination is supported by the state."
On the other hand, sophomore Connor Lan
man 'l3 says "there should be no distractions in
such a structured, focused organization."
"Fighting a war, you can't be afraid of the
fact that your comrade is a homosexual or not,"
Lanman said. "Maybe at some point I'd like to
see it repealed, but not in the midst of conflicts
overseas."
One way or another, "if the government's
going to change the plan, we want to make sure
we have as good of a plan as possible to smooth
the transition," Golby said.
