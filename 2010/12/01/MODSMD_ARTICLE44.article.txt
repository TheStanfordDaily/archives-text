# A 						Loaf Sold, a Stomach Fed
## Student organization sells traditional Jewish bread to help raise money for charity

If there's something Stanford students will support
without hesitation, it is probably food. Carbohy
drates are even better. This perhaps explains how
Challah for Hunger, providing bread in a variety of
flavors to the masses, has found its niche on campus.
Challah for Hunger, an organization started at the
Claremont colleges, now has chapters at universities
around the country, all of which bake and sell challah
each week, donating their proceeds to charity. Challah, a
Jewish bread eaten on the Sabbath and holidays, is cus
tomarily braided, a tradition Challah for Hunger keeps.
A little less orthodox in their choice of challah flavors, its
challah loaves can be anywhere from plain and poppy seed
to chocolate chip, olive rosemary or, recently, pumpkin. The
chocolate chip loaves are especially popular, selling out
quickly at the group's stand at Tresidder on Fridays or even
by Thursday nights, when they emerge from the oven.
The Stanford chapter of Challah for Hunger was co
founded by seniors Helen Helfand and Eva Orbuch dur
ing the spring of their sophomore year. Orbuch had
worked with the UC-Los Angeles chapter's head at a
summer camp and she was inspired to start a Stanford
group.
"It seems that while in the Jewish community there was
an emphasis on social justice, there were no concrete op
portunities for service," she said. "I wanted to provide that
for the Jewish community and the wider community."
"As the social action chair for the JSA [Jewish Students
Association], I had been searching for away to get lots of
Jewish students at Stanford involved in social action,"
Helfand added. "Up to that point I had organized a few
events, but they mostly attracted the same small crowd,
and I really wanted to create something that the whole
community was excited about."
Originally baking at Columbae and selling in White
Plaza, Challah for Hunger has shifted to the Hillel kitchen
and Tresidder as it has expanded from a tiny, grassroots
start.
"We're officially under the JSA, who subsidizes our in
gredient costs ... so that all our profits can go to charity,"
Orbuch said. "Hillel has also been really supportive in
lending us their kitchens and the space."
And as the endeavor has grown, more space has be
come necessary for a much-expanded group.
"We started with 40 loaves every week and now we
bake 160," Orbuch said. "The pre-ordering system has al
lowed us to bake in greater volume, as many Row houses
and dorms will order a big batch with kitchen funds."
Although Challah for Hunger may sell baked goods for
charity, Orbuch said, "We are not just a bake sale." Half of
the proceeds each week go to Challah for Hunger's nation
al cause, the American Jewish World Service's Darfur ini

tiative, while the other half of the proceeds go to various
charities in the area or around the globe. But Orbuch em
phasizes the group's advocacy component as well.
"We have opportunities for political advocacy at the
selling table every week, and we're hoping to ramp up this
aspect of the organization," she said. "People are interest
ed in our product, but we are also about education and
raising awareness." She mentioned collaboration with
Stanford STAND and possible work with the Stanford
Project on Hunger and Dance Marathon.
Volunteer coordination Ali Mclnnis 'l3 deals with the
challenges of producing 160 loaves of bread every Thurs
day.
"It's a lot more work than I thought," she said. "To
make so many loaves you need a lot of people, and the time
it takes can depend on how much people know about bak
ing, and whether they're there to work or just chill."
"It's difficult because no one gets paid or has an incen
tive to do it, so we're a social group that has to run a bit like
a business," she continued. "We have responsibilities to our
customers, especially as we are switching to pre-selling
rather than pre-ordering, so we cannot give people the
wrong type; they've already paid."
Stanford's chapter has found a creative way to work
around the problem of lack of volunteers by having stu
dent groups co-sponsor on many weeks. These groups can
choose the charity to which half the profits go in exchange
for helping out with baking and selling. Past co-sponsors
have included various fraternities, Project Love, FAITH
and STAND.
Stanford's Challah for Hunger is considering donating
its profits that do not go to AJWS to a local organization
on a regular basis, as many other chapters do.
Mclnnis's volunteer base comes from the entire Stan
ford community, not just Jewish students. She emphasizes
this interfaith component.
"I myself am not Jewish, and got involved last year in a
co-sponsoring event," she said. "I think this is a different
type of service, which emphasizes education and advocacy
as well. It's also interesting for people to learn about chal
lah and its traditional use in Judaism."
Orbuch agrees that Challah for Hunger's popularity is
not religiously exclusive.
"People come because it's fun, and community build
ing. We like doing thing with our hands and it's a chance to
bake that you don't get if you don't live in a co-op or Row
house," she said.
And although the social action and interaction draw
volunteers and buyers alike, an even greater appeal lies in
the bread itself.
"There is a huge desire on campus for fresh-baked chal
lah," Helfand said. "Buying a loaf definitely makes you the
most popular person in the dorm."
