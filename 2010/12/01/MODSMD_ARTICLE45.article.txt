# Shedding Stereotypes
## For Ije Ude, 13 years means a lifetime of experience 
### HELEN ANDERSON 
If you're like the majority of Stan
ford students, you're probably
planning on graduating four
years after you first set foot on
campus as a bright-eyed fresh
man. This was how Ije Ude TO, now the
director of the Service Internship Pro
gram at the Haas Center for Public
Service, planned her college career
too. But, in her words, "life kind of got
in the way." After spending 13 years in
New York City putting her human bi
ology major to use in the real world,
she returned to Stanford last January
to finish her last two quarters.

As an international student from
Nigeria, Ude initially experienced sig
nificant culture shock coming to Stan
ford. She spent her first three years of
college coming to terms with both her
preconceived notions about the Unit
ed States California in particular
and the United States' assumptions
about her.

"Nigeria... used to be a British
colony, so it still has the feeling of the
British," Ude said. "It's more class
based. Class is the prominent status
that people talk about or issue that
people feel more comfortable focusing
on. I feel like America is very much
race-based, in terms of how things are
run and just that kind of undercur
rent."

Ude found that she surprised her
classmates with her normality, particu
larly her lack of an accent.
"People had their idea of what they
thought an African person was like, or
should act like, or should sound like,"
she said. "So I didn't really fit that and
people had a hard time placing me."
Despite this nagging sense of not
quite fitting in, she loved her studies,
especially the interdisciplinary nature
of the human biology major, which she
said allowed her to "pull together" her
interests.

When she started feeling financial
pressures during her senior year and
was unable to continue to pay for
school, she took these interests to New
York City, where she began working in
a teen health clinic.

"What I loved about Hum Bio was
that it looks at the social context for
certain health problems," Ude said. "I
was really interested in public health at
that time."
She stayed at the clinic for about
two years, working as an HIV coun
selor and sexual health educator, both
one-on-one and in classrooms.
"Over and over again, [I had] both
young women and young men disclos
ing to me these histories of violence
and sexual abuse," Ude said. "And so
that kind of steered me in the direction
of doing violence prevention, violence
intervention work."
At first she worked for nonprofits
doing educational youth empower
ment or community empowerment
that dealt with violence issues. But she
soon became drawn to social-justice
organizations that were trying to get to
the roots of violence looking at the
conditions that children are raised in
that allow violent acts to happen.
After about five or six years, Ude
shifted her focus again. This time, she
was doing a two-year fellowship in
which she got to develop her own proj
ect. She ended up working in an inter
national high school in Brooklyn,
where many of the students were
refugees from poor countries.
"I did a year-long project with them
involving art, using digital storytelling,
to have them share their stories of vio
lence and survival and then use it as a
community organizing tool to talk
about violence in communities," she
said.
This experience sparked Ude's in
terest in therapy. She decided that she
wanted to go to graduate school, and
this was one of the motivating forces
that led her back to Stanford to finish
her undergraduate degree last year.
But she never thought of her 13-year
hiatus as a break from her education.
"The work that I was doing was
very much connected to the stuff I had
learned as an undergrad, so I felt like it
was really a continuation of my educa
tion anyway," Ude said. "It was a long
time apart, but it really helped me clar
ify [what I wanted to do]."
Back in classes, she had a new per

spective not only through her work
in New York, but also through her new
role as a parent. But sometimes she felt
it was wisest not to impose her experi
ences on her fellow classmates.

"I felt like a couple of times I had to
hold my tongue, because we'd be in
class and people would be sharing
their vision of the work they wanted to
do, and it was really idealistic," she said.
This was something she had gone
through herself particularly when it
came to her previously idealized per
ception of what working for nonprofits
would be like as opposed to the corpo
rate world but resisted the tempta
tion to preach about what she had
learned, knowing that her classmates
would learn best through their own ex
periences.

"I had to balance just letting people
have their ideas, knowing that they
were going to figure it out, and I didn't
need to burst their bubble," Ude said.
"I could share what I had to share but
let it be."

Ude is now working at the Haas
Center, partnering with urban studies
students to help them through the in
ternship process. Her goal is not just to
get internships for these students, but
also to help the students reflect on
their experiences afterward. She wants
them to have experiences that were as
meaningful as her experience in New
York so that they can "come back to
campus with a renewed focus and
apply that to the rest of their academic
career."

In the future, Ude hopes to use her
counseling experience to increase the
effectiveness of community work be
cause she belie ves the well-being of the
people engaging in public service is
just as important as the wellbeing of
those that they are helping.
"I feel like that's one of the missing
pieces," she said. "There's not enough
support for staff or for activists or for
people who are doing work on the
ground... and that impacts the quali
ty or the sustainability of the work
they're actually doing."

should act like, or should sound like,"
she said. "So I didn't really fit that and
people had a hard time placing me."
Despite this nagging sense of not
quite fitting in, she loved her studies,
especially the interdisciplinary nature
of the human biology major, which she
said allowed her to "pull together" her
interests.

When she started feeling financial
pressures during her senior year and
was unable to continue to pay for
school, she took these interests to New
York City, where she began working in
a teen health clinic.

"What I loved about Hum Bio was
that it looks at the social context for
certain health problems," Ude said. "I
was really interested in public health at
that time."
She stayed at the clinic for about
two years, working as an HIV coun
selor and sexual health educator, both
one-on-one and in classrooms.
"Over and over again, [I had] both
young women and young men disclos
ing to me these histories of violence
and sexual abuse," Ude said. "And so
that kind of steered me in the direction
of doing violence prevention, violence
intervention work."
At first she worked for nonprofits
doing educational youth empower
ment or community empowerment
that dealt with violence issues. But she
soon became drawn to social-justice
organizations that were trying to get to
the roots of violence looking at the
conditions that children are raised in
that allow violent acts to happen.
After about five or six years, Ude
shifted her focus again. This time, she
was doing a two-year fellowship in
which she got to develop her own proj
ect. She ended up working in an inter
national high school in Brooklyn,
where many of the students were
refugees from poor countries.
"I did a year-long project with them
involving art, using digital storytelling,
to have them share their stories of vio
lence and survival and then use it as a
community organizing tool to talk
about violence in communities," she
said.
This experience sparked Ude's in
terest in therapy. She decided that she
wanted to go to graduate school, and
this was one of the motivating forces
that led her back to Stanford to finish
her undergraduate degree last year.
But she never thought of her 13-year
hiatus as a break from her education.
"The work that I was doing was
very much connected to the stuff I had
learned as an undergrad, so I felt like it
was really a continuation of my educa
tion anyway," Ude said. "It was a long
time apart, but it really helped me clar
ify [what I wanted to do]."
Back in classes, she had a new per

spective not only through her work
in New York, but also through her new
role as a parent. But sometimes she felt
it was wisest not to impose her experi
ences on her fellow classmates.

"I felt like a couple of times I had to
hold my tongue, because we'd be in
class and people would be sharing
their vision of the work they wanted to
do, and it was really idealistic," she said.
This was something she had gone
through herself particularly when it
came to her previously idealized per
ception of what working for nonprofits
would be like as opposed to the corpo
rate world but resisted the tempta
tion to preach about what she had
learned, knowing that her classmates
would learn best through their own ex
periences.

"I had to balance just letting people
have their ideas, knowing that they
were going to figure it out, and I didn't
need to burst their bubble," Ude said.
"I could share what I had to share but
let it be."

Ude is now working at the Haas
Center, partnering with urban studies
students to help them through the in
ternship process. Her goal is not just to
get internships for these students, but
also to help the students reflect on
their experiences afterward. She wants
them to have experiences that were as
meaningful as her experience in New
York so that they can "come back to
campus with a renewed focus and
apply that to the rest of their academic
career."

In the future, Ude hopes to use her
counseling experience to increase the
effectiveness of community work be
cause she belie ves the well-being of the
people engaging in public service is
just as important as the wellbeing of
those that they are helping.
"I feel like that's one of the missing
pieces," she said. "There's not enough
support for staff or for activists or for
people who are doing work on the
ground... and that impacts the quali
ty or the sustainability of the work
they're actually doing."
