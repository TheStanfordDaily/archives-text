## CHASING A TITLE Stanford earns berth in third consecutive Final Four 
### NATE ADAMS DESK EDITOR 
Another year, another run at the Col
lege Cup.
The Stanford women's soccer team
will stand alone as the only No. 1 seed in
the Final Four next weekend after
punching its ticket to Cary.N.C., with a 5-
0 victory over Florida State on Friday.
Overcoming a talented Seminoles de
fense, the Cardinal (22-0-2) opened the
floodgates in the second half, with five
goals scored from as many players and a
pair of record-tying marks from senior
Christen Press. For the 2009 runner-up
Cardinal, the trip will mark its third con
secutive College Cup appearance.
Despite the final result, the matchup
with the second-seeded Seminoles (16-
6-1) had every reason to be a close
match. Florida State had outscored its
opponents in the NCAA Tournament's
first three rounds by a combined margin
of 8-1 a mark identical to Stanford's.
The Seminoles were making their 11th
consecutive playoff run, persevering
through a bevy of injuries, and they had
lost by multiple goals only once all sea
son.
But Florida State had never faced the

Cardinal, and in Friday's meeting, at
least, Stanford was able to find an offen
sive rhythm and run circles around FSU.
"I think we've probably not been
under that quality of pressure all season
long, even though we have played a top
quality schedule," said FSU head coach
Mark Krikorian.
To an extent, the Seminoles were able
to disrupt Stanford's possessive style of
offense in the first half, occasionally in
tercepting passes in the midfield and
mounting brief counterattacks. But even
if most of its chances came on long pass
es into a crowded box, the Cardinal was
able to establish an increasing measure
of control.
"Whenever you get numbers in the
box, I think it's a good opportunity to
score," said Stanford head coach Paul
Ratcliffe about his team's first-half pres
sure. "It's something we train for a lot,
and we want to see it happen."
Stanford's first chance was a good
one, with Press pausing in the box before
high-kicking a lofty centering pass from
junior Camille Levin in the fifth minute.
Seminole goalkeeper Kelsey Wys man
aged to deflect the shot off the crossbar,
but the missed opportunity marked the
first of many for the Cardinal, which out

shot FSU 22-6 on the contest.
Most of the Cardinal's first-half
chances had the same flavor, including
an llth-minute chip from sophomore
defender Courtney Verloo after she re
covered a chaotic corner kick from jun
ior Lindsay Taylor, who followed that at
tempt with a point-blank header off a
soaring pass from sophomore Mariah
Nogueira seven minutes later.
Stanford's first goal came on a similar
play, with Press dumping the ball into the
box from deep in the right corner in the
31st minute. Nogueira found the ball in
traffic and managed to head it past Wys
while streaking in front of the goal from
right to left. The goal was Nogueira's
fifth of the season and her first of the
tournament. For Press, the score had a
bit of added significance with her 41 st
assist, she broke Stanford's all-time
mark set by Marcie Ward in 2004.
Stanford headed to the tents at half
time with an 11-3 shooting advantage
and a 1-0 lead.
Showing even a bit more spark then it
had in the opening frame, the Cardinal
was able to charge the net and string to
gether some picture-perfect chances in
the second half.
After holding off a dangerous FSU

set piece in the 48th minute, Taylor was
able to double the Stanford lead by tak
ing a cross from Levin while storming
into the box on the left side. After drib
bling at full stride for a few steps, she
fired it in from just a few yards in front of
the left post.The goal marked the 10th of
the season for Taylor, who is tied with
classmate Teresa Noyola for the second
highest goal tally on the team.
"During halftime, it was just [about]
staying confident, keep playing good
soccer," Ratcliffe said about his team
stepping up its pace on offense. "And
let's get another goal. Get another goal
to put the game out of reach, basically.
And then they just kept coming."
Stanford all but put away the game a
few minutes later, with Press releasing a
30-yard blast from beyond the left cor
ner of the box. The shot took a sharp
bounce off the pitch before ricocheting
past Wys and into the left side of the net.
Aside from giving her team a 3-0 lead,
the goal tied Press with 2010 graduate
Kelley O'Hara for the Stanford record
for goals in a single season (26).
Noyola added a fourth goal in the
78th minute, knocking in a first-time shot

off a pass from Kristy Zurmuhlen at
the top of the box.
At that point, the substitutes came
pouring in and the starters includ
ing the senior Press went march
ing out. Press, the national leader in
goals and the anchor of a top-ranked
offense, couldn't help but soak in the
moment as she stepped off her home
field for the final time.
"I was nostalgic, sitting there and
watching my team," she said. "Every

one was so excited to be going to the
College Cup. It was a huge crowd and
there was a lot of energy, so yeah, I felt
a little nostalgic watching everyone."
Marjani Hing-Glover added a
final nail to the coffin in the 86th
minute, clinching Stanford's trip east
with a 15-yard shot from mid-stride
on the left side of the box.
That sealed the win for Stanford,
who will depart for North Carolina
later this week.The Cardinal is sched
uled to kick off its third consecutive
College Cup against Boston College
on Friday afternoon.
Stanford played the Eagles on the
road to open the 2010 season, and
ended the match in a 1-1 draw. Rat

cliffe hopes that his team's recent
trips to the College Cup will provide
an edge when they meet again.
"I think this team has gained expe
rience from going to the Final Four a
couple of times," Ratcliffe said. "So I
hope that experience is invaluable.
We'll go out there with confidence
and try to finish the job."
The Cardinal will face Boston Col
lege at either 1 or 3:30 p.m. PST on
Friday, and the winner of that match
will play either Notre Dame or Ohio
State in the national championship
game at 9 a.m. PST on Sunday.

"During halftime, it was just [about]

soccer," Ratcliffe said about his team
stepping up its pace on offense. "And
let's get another goal. Get another goal
to put the game out of reach, basically.
And then they just kept coming."

Another year, another run at the Col
lege Cup.
The Stanford women's soccer team
will stand alone as the only No. 1 seed in
the Final Four next weekend after
punching its ticket to Cary.N.C., with a 5-
0 victory over Florida State on Friday.
Overcoming a talented Seminoles de
fense, the Cardinal (22-0-2) opened the
floodgates in the second half, with five
goals scored from as many players and a
pair of record-tying marks from senior
Christen Press. For the 2009 runner-up
Cardinal, the trip will mark its third con
secutive College Cup appearance.
Despite the final result, the matchup
with the second-seeded Seminoles (16-
6-1) had every reason to be a close
match. Florida State had outscored its
opponents in the NCAA Tournament's
first three rounds by a combined margin
of 8-1 a mark identical to Stanford's.
The Seminoles were making their 11th
consecutive playoff run, persevering
through a bevy of injuries, and they had
lost by multiple goals only once all sea
son.
But Florida State had never faced the

Cardinal, and in Friday's meeting, at
least, Stanford was able to find an offen
sive rhythm and run circles around FSU.
"I think we've probably not been
under that quality of pressure all season
long, even though we have played a top
quality schedule," said FSU head coach
Mark Krikorian.
To an extent, the Seminoles were able
to disrupt Stanford's possessive style of
offense in the first half, occasionally in
tercepting passes in the midfield and
mounting brief counterattacks. But even
if most of its chances came on long pass
es into a crowded box, the Cardinal was
able to establish an increasing measure
of control.
"Whenever you get numbers in the
box, I think it's a good opportunity to
score," said Stanford head coach Paul
Ratcliffe about his team's first-half pres
sure. "It's something we train for a lot,
and we want to see it happen."
Stanford's first chance was a good
one, with Press pausing in the box before
high-kicking a lofty centering pass from
junior Camille Levin in the fifth minute.
Seminole goalkeeper Kelsey Wys man
aged to deflect the shot off the crossbar,
but the missed opportunity marked the
first of many for the Cardinal, which out

shot FSU 22-6 on the contest.
Most of the Cardinal's first-half
chances had the same flavor, including
an llth-minute chip from sophomore
defender Courtney Verloo after she re
covered a chaotic corner kick from jun
ior Lindsay Taylor, who followed that at
tempt with a point-blank header off a
soaring pass from sophomore Mariah
Nogueira seven minutes later.
Stanford's first goal came on a similar
play, with Press dumping the ball into the
box from deep in the right corner in the
31st minute. Nogueira found the ball in
traffic and managed to head it past Wys
while streaking in front of the goal from
right to left. The goal was Nogueira's
fifth of the season and her first of the
tournament. For Press, the score had a
bit of added significance with her 41 st
assist, she broke Stanford's all-time
mark set by Marcie Ward in 2004.
Stanford headed to the tents at half
time with an 11-3 shooting advantage
and a 1-0 lead.
Showing even a bit more spark then it
had in the opening frame, the Cardinal
was able to charge the net and string to
gether some picture-perfect chances in
the second half.
