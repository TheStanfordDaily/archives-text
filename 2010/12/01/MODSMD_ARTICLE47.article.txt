# Let students go to BCS
## 
### Daniel Bohm 
The following is an open
letter to Stanford Presi
dent John Hennessy and
other members of the
school's administration.

Dear President Hennessy,
I am writing you today request
ing that you stand behind the Stan
ford football team. I'm not talking
about singing the alma mater with
the players after Saturday's win or
participating in Gaieties. I am ask
ing you to come out and say that
Stanford students will be excused
from classes on Jan. 3, 2011, to at
tend the Orange Bowl, if that is in
deed the bowl game that the Cardi
nal football team is playing in. And
although it is highly unlikely, if
Stanford is invited to the Sugar
Bowl, I would love to hear that stu
dents will be free to attend, even
though it is on Jan. 4,2011.
Stanford needs the support of its
leader. I am sick and tired of hear
ing that Stanford has a lackluster
fan base and that it will not be able
to fill its allotted seats at a bowl
game. I'm sure you are tired of
hearing those sentiments as well.
The bowl committees need to know
that Stanford is committed to sell
ing its seats that the university is
invested in the football team
and they need to know now, before
the bowls are selected.
As you probably know, Stanford
is ranked fourth in the current BCS
standings, which gives the Cardinal
an automatic bid to a BCS bowl.
However, in the unlikely event that
we fall to No. 5 next week, I don't
want there to be any doubt in the
minds of bowl chairmen that they
want Stanford at their bowl and
that Stanford will fill seats like it
did at last year's Sun Bowl.
This is also an important oppor
tunity to show support to a football
program that many pundits are say
ing is bracing to take some serious
hits. Stanford has one of the best
coaches in the nation in Jim Har
baugh, but many people think it is
just a matter of time before he
leaves the Farm for greener pas
tures where fans live and die with
their football team. Show Coach
Harbaugh that Stanford can be a
great football school with a pas
sionate fan base.
Stanford also has the best quar
terback in the country in Andrew
Luck. He is a redshirt sophomore
eligible for the NFL Draft. Let's fill
up a bowl game stadium and show
Luck that he should stay at Stan
ford one more year and get his de

gree. I'm asking you to give us stu
dents a chance.
I know that Stanford is one of
the best academic schools in the
world, and that canceling classes
for a football game may ruffle
some feathers, and it may even ap
pear to undermine the academic
drive of the campus. However, col
lege as I'm sure you know,
given all of the amazing extracur
ricular activities offered at Stan
ford is about learning both in
and out of the classroom. This is a
special opportunity that students
should be able to enjoy without
worrying about falling behind
back on campus.
There is precedent for cancel
ing classes for big football games.
Just last year, the University of Al
abama excused students and fac
ulty from three days of class in
order to allow them to travel to
and from the BCS National Cham

pionship Game. Yes, there are
complications that come from
canceling class especially in
Winter Quarter when we already
lose Mondays to Martin Luther
King, Jr., Day and Presidents' Day
but I believe this is well worth
it. Also, if I recall correctly, just a
few years ago instruction began in
all quarters on Tuesday and not
Monday.
Unfortunately, none of us can
control whether or not alumni and
local Stanford fans show up for
home games or decide to travel to
bowl games. You, however, do
have the power to make it possible
for students to support their class
mates on the gridiron. So please.
President Hennessy, throw your
support behind the Stanford foot
ball team. Come out screaming
that Stanford deserves to be in a
BCS bowl and that Cardinal red
will be seen in the stadium.

Sincerely,
Daniel Bohm
