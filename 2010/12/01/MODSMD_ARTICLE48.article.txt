# FOOTBALL: 113TH BIG GAME
## Golden Bear Beatdown 
### KABIR SAWHNEY MANAGING EDITOR 
The Axe is coming back to Stanford.
The No. 6 Cardinal football team won Stan
ford's annual rivalry game handily, defeating Cal
ifornia by a final score of 48-14. Stanford (10-1,7-
1 Pac-10) scored 31 points in the first half to zero
for the Golden Bears (5-6,3-5), playing a strong
game on both sides of the ball throughout.
Tension between the two teams bubbled to
the surface early in the game, as both benches
emptied during the coin toss and faced each
other down at the center of the field. The players
exchanged taunts and provocations, and both
teams were flagged with personal foul penalties.
Stanford sophomore wideout Jamal-Rashad Pat
terson was ejected after aiming a blow at Cal de
fensive back C.J. Moncrease, who provoked Pat
terson by spitting at him.
"It's a rivalry game," said senior cornerback
Richard Sherman. "Tempers flare. They were try
ing to show their enthusiasm, and we were trying
to show our enthusiasm. Even before that, in
warm-ups, it kind of escalated early on."
Stanford set the tone early in the game, on
Cal's first drive. On the third play of the game,
Cal quarterback Brock Mansion fumbled the
ball, and it was pounced on by redshirt junior de
fensive end Matt Masifilo to give Stanford its first
possession of the game deep inside Cal territory.
When asked whether it mattered that his team
turned the ball over on its first drive, Cal head
coach Jeff Tedford said, "Absolutely. No ques
tion. You don't fumble a snap and give them the
ball down in the red zone to start the game. There
were a lot of plays to be made, but we didn't play
well enough to win."

However, Stanford was unable to fully capi
talize on its early opportunity. Indeed, the Card
failed to gain any offensive yardage on its first
drive it gained 15 yards on a pass interference
penalty. A field goal from senior kicker Nate
Whitaker gave Stanford its first points of the day.
On its next drive, the Golden Bears appeared
ready to match Stanford and recover from their
early miscue. After a kickoff return to the Cal 34-
yard line, Mansion and running back Shane
Vereen led the Golden Bears deep into Stanford
territory. However, Mansion lofted up a pass into
the Cardinal red zone that was easily picked off
by Sherman at the Cardinal's own five-yard line.
"Turnovers cost us down in the red zone us
getting in the red zone and turning the ball over
and then turning the ball over in their end
zone to give them a short field," Tedford said.
After the Sherman interception, Stanford
redshirt sophomore quarterback Andrew Luck
marched his offense down the field, scoring its
first touchdown of the game on a short run from
sophomore running back Stepfan Taylor. The
biggest play of the drive was a scramble that Luck
turned into a 58-yard gain down the left sideline,
dodging and battering through several Cal de
fenders before finally running out-of-bounds all
the way down at the Cal 21-yard line. The run in
cluded a memorable stiff-arm on Cal defensive
back Sean Cattouse.
"It was just a lesson for me," Cattouse said.
"At the last second, I got caught between making
that big hit and wrapping him up."
Stanford proceeded to score touchdowns on
its next five drives, more or less imposing its will
on Cal's porous defense. The Cardinal employed
a highly balanced attack, mixing its signature
power running game with throws from Luck at

short and long range. Its 467 total offensive yards
were almost perfectly split 235 passing yards
and 232 rushing yards. The performance was es
pecially notable because it followed a weak
showing last weekend against Arizona State,
where the Card could only muster 17 points.
"They knew what they had to do," redshirt
sophomore linebacker Chase Thomas said about
his team's offense, "They made a lot of adjust
ments early and they weren't stopped after that."
Stanford's defense also played well, forcing
three turnovers and playing opportunistically.
The Cardinal held the Bears to 6-of-14 third
down conversions and forced one turnover on
downs, limiting the offense to 299 yards overall.
Mansion, who started the season as Cal's backup
quarterback, had a rough day under center, going
19-37 for 173 passing yards, including two inter
ceptions and one touchdown pass.
"We put a lot of pressure on [Mansion],"
Thomas said. "He doesn't have that much experi
ence I think he was exposed in the game. He
had a couple interceptions; he fumbled a snap; he
seemed pretty rattled. I think that helped us out."
Comparatively, Luck had a very strong game
to lead the Stanford offense, going 16-20 for 235
yards and two touchdowns, with no interceptions.
Luck was also first on the team in rushing with
three carries for 72 yards.
After the game, Stanford head coach Jim Har
baugh called Luck the "best college football play
er in the country," and his teammates had similar
words of praise.
"He's the greatest player I've ever seen," Tay
lor said. "He makes it a lot easier it's hard to
play defense out there against him; he can run

Redshirt sophomore quarterback Andrew Luck shredded Cal's defense in last Saturday's Big Game, both through the air and on the ground. Luck's signature
play of the game was a 58-yard run in the first half, for which he gained instant You Tube fame by simply running over Cal safety Sean Cattouse.
