Stanford football is 11-1 and

standings.
I know you've probably heard this
by now, even if you haven't read a sin
gle sports story, ESPN headline, Face
book status or tweet, but you can't
possibly say, read or hear it enough to
fully grasp the enormity of that state
ment. So I'll say it again.
Stanford football is 11-1 and
ranked No. 4 in the BCS standings.
Just four years ago tomorrow, the
Cardinal wrapped up a 1 -11 campaign
that saw more third-down punts than
home victories for a team opening a
newly renovated stadium. Thoughts
of becoming a national power were
nowhere to be found the immedi
ate thoughts were how to become a
respectable program again. The first
step toward that goal was the hiring of
head coach Jim Harbaugh, and the
rest, as they say, is history.
And it really is history that we're
experiencing right now. As in Toby
Gerhart coming within a few clueless
SEC homer votes of a Heisman Tro

Gerhart with a committee that has
totaled over 2,500 yards and 32
touchdowns, led by Stepfan Taylor's
1,000-yard, 15-touchdown season. As
in Stanford's first ever 11-win season
and highest-ever BCS ranking.
The "Worst to First" mantra of last
year's Stanford men's volleyball
team could certainly be applied to
this year's football team, if not for un
defeated Oregon standing in the Car
dinal's way. However, the achieve
ment of the 2010 Stanford football
team goes far beyond its record and
statistics.
For the first time in recent memo
ry, Stanford football is a big name
around the country. Media members
from even the most biased corners of
the country have been forced to ac
knowledge the quality of the Cardi
nal, and few teams have been as high
ly touted by pundits as Stanford.
More than that, though, Stanford
football is finally making waves at a
more important location Stan
ford. The days of 85,000-person sell
outs are long gone from Stanford Sta
dium, but this year, the campus start
ed to come around to the fact that it
