### Jacob Jaffe Fields of Failure 
Stanford football is 11-1 and
ranked No. 4 in the BCS
standings.
I know you've probably heard this
by now, even if you haven't read a sin
gle sports story, ESPN headline, Face
book status or tweet, but you can't
possibly say, read or hear it enough to
fully grasp the enormity of that state
ment. So I'll say it again.
Stanford football is 11-1 and
ranked No. 4 in the BCS standings.
Just four years ago tomorrow, the
Cardinal wrapped up a 1 -11 campaign
that saw more third-down punts than
home victories for a team opening a
newly renovated stadium. Thoughts
of becoming a national power were
nowhere to be found the immedi
ate thoughts were how to become a
respectable program again. The first
step toward that goal was the hiring of
head coach Jim Harbaugh, and the
rest, as they say, is history.
And it really is history that we're
experiencing right now. As in Toby
Gerhart coming within a few clueless
SEC homer votes of a Heisman Tro
phy, and Andrew Luck likely follow
ing that up with a similar trip to
Times Square for this year's ceremo
ny. As in Luck setting Stanford's sin
gle-season passing touchdowns
record with 28 TDs to 10 different re
ceivers with another game still to
play. As in the Cardinal replacing
Gerhart with a committee that has
totaled over 2,500 yards and 32
touchdowns, led by Stepfan Taylor's
1,000-yard, 15-touchdown season. As
in Stanford's first ever 11-win season
and highest-ever BCS ranking.
The "Worst to First" mantra of last
year's Stanford men's volleyball
team could certainly be applied to
this year's football team, if not for un
defeated Oregon standing in the Car
dinal's way. However, the achieve
ment of the 2010 Stanford football
team goes far beyond its record and
statistics.
For the first time in recent memo
ry, Stanford football is a big name
around the country. Media members
from even the most biased corners of
the country have been forced to ac
knowledge the quality of the Cardi
nal, and few teams have been as high
ly touted by pundits as Stanford.
More than that, though, Stanford
football is finally making waves at a
more important location Stan
ford. The days of 85,000-person sell
outs are long gone from Stanford Sta
dium, but this year, the campus start
ed to come around to the fact that it

has a football team, and a good one
at that. Sure, the football fans always
cared, and sure, the attendance still
leaves a lot to be desired. But the
buzz around campus, from football
fans and the sports-illiterate alike,
has grown exponentially. People all
over campus are projecting Stan
ford's bowl position and waiting on
tenterhooks to update their Face
book statuses at the exact moment
when Stanford's BCS ranking is an
nounced.

The Stanford football fever has
been spreading all season long, and
it's infecting people who seemed im
mune to its effects for years. A cynic
might call this fair-weather fandom,
but 1 see it as a larger group to share
this magical season with. And look
ing back (and ahead) at this season,
it's hard not to get caught up in the
emotion of watching this team suc
ceed.
ft takes so much to contend na
tionally, from recruiting to strategies
to training to health to hard work to
good fortune to spectacular plays.
Looking at a team's season like this,
it just brings into sharper focus how
incredible the achievements of Stan
ford's other teams have been over
the years.
Other sports sometimes take a
back seat to football in the press, and
that's the unfortunate reality of the
world of sports. Particularly in a year
like this, when Stanford football has
ascended to unknown heights, it's
not surprising that other consistent
ly great Cardinal teams haven't
quite received their due.
But forgetting about the rest of
Stanford sports would be forgetting
about some of the most impressive
accomplishments you will ever see.
Take women's soccer, for example.
A second consecutive undefeated
regular season has already been fol
lowed up by a third straight appear
ance in the College Cup for the Car
dinal women. Consider how many
teams in any sport around the coun
try would trade anything to be one
of the four best teams in the nation,
and these ladies have done it three
years running. Just two wins sepa
rate Stanford from its first national
title, something only seven different
Division I programs have won.
Stanford women's volleyball re
cently claimed a share of its fifth
consecutive Pac-10 title and will
head to the NCAA Tournament for
the 30th straight season, marks that
would be unheard of in almost any
other conference in any other sport.
The Cardinal will be the No. 3 over
all seed and will look to make the
Final Four for the 19th time in 29
years and seventh time this decade
when it opens tournament play this
weekend.

Women's basketball has just
begun its 2010-11 season, but the
pieces are already in place for an
other run to the Final Four. Stanford
has won 10 consecutive Pac-10 titles
and has made the past three Final
Fours, and this year looks poised to
go at least as far.
The list goes on and on. Despite
the enormous pressure of contend
ing nationally year after year, Stan
ford has made an annual habit of
ranking among the nation's best in
several sports.
We've been lucky to witness the
revival of Stanford football, and we
can only dream that it will one day
match the long-term success of
these other fantastic programs. For
now, though, let's just sit back and
revel in the amazing sporting feats
happening right here on the Farm.

that saw more third-down punts than
home victories for a team opening a
newly renovated stadium. Thoughts
of becoming a national power were
nowhere to be found the immedi
ate thoughts were how to become a
respectable program again. The first
step toward that goal was the hiring of
head coach Jim Harbaugh, and the
rest, as they say, is history.
And it really is history that we're
experiencing right now. As in Toby
Gerhart coming within a few clueless
SEC homer votes of a Heisman Tro
phy, and Andrew Luck likely follow
ing that up with a similar trip to
Times Square for this year's ceremo
ny. As in Luck setting Stanford's sin
gle-season passing touchdowns
record with 28 TDs to 10 different re
ceivers with another game still to
play. As in the Cardinal replacing
Gerhart with a committee that has
totaled over 2,500 yards and 32
touchdowns, led by Stepfan Taylor's
1,000-yard, 15-touchdown season. As
in Stanford's first ever 11-win season
and highest-ever BCS ranking.
The "Worst to First" mantra of last
year's Stanford men's volleyball
team could certainly be applied to
this year's football team, if not for un
defeated Oregon standing in the Car
dinal's way. However, the achieve
ment of the 2010 Stanford football
team goes far beyond its record and
statistics.
For the first time in recent memo
ry, Stanford football is a big name
around the country. Media members
from even the most biased corners of
the country have been forced to ac
knowledge the quality of the Cardi
nal, and few teams have been as high
ly touted by pundits as Stanford.
More than that, though, Stanford
football is finally making waves at a
more important location Stan
ford. The days of 85,000-person sell
outs are long gone from Stanford Sta
dium, but this year, the campus start
ed to come around to the fact that it

has a football team, and a good one
at that. Sure, the football fans always
cared, and sure, the attendance still
leaves a lot to be desired. But the
buzz around campus, from football
fans and the sports-illiterate alike,
has grown exponentially. People all
over campus are projecting Stan
ford's bowl position and waiting on
tenterhooks to update their Face
book statuses at the exact moment
when Stanford's BCS ranking is an
nounced.

The Stanford football fever has
been spreading all season long, and
it's infecting people who seemed im
mune to its effects for years. A cynic
might call this fair-weather fandom,
but 1 see it as a larger group to share
this magical season with. And look
ing back (and ahead) at this season,
it's hard not to get caught up in the
emotion of watching this team suc
ceed.
ft takes so much to contend na
tionally, from recruiting to strategies
to training to health to hard work to
good fortune to spectacular plays.
Looking at a team's season like this,
it just brings into sharper focus how
incredible the achievements of Stan
ford's other teams have been over
the years.
Other sports sometimes take a
back seat to football in the press, and
that's the unfortunate reality of the
world of sports. Particularly in a year
like this, when Stanford football has
ascended to unknown heights, it's
not surprising that other consistent
ly great Cardinal teams haven't
quite received their due.
But forgetting about the rest of
Stanford sports would be forgetting
about some of the most impressive
accomplishments you will ever see.
Take women's soccer, for example.
A second consecutive undefeated
regular season has already been fol
lowed up by a third straight appear
ance in the College Cup for the Car
dinal women. Consider how many
teams in any sport around the coun
try would trade anything to be one
of the four best teams in the nation,
and these ladies have done it three
years running. Just two wins sepa
rate Stanford from its first national
title, something only seven different
Division I programs have won.
Stanford women's volleyball re
cently claimed a share of its fifth
consecutive Pac-10 title and will
head to the NCAA Tournament for
the 30th straight season, marks that
would be unheard of in almost any
other conference in any other sport.
The Cardinal will be the No. 3 over
all seed and will look to make the
Final Four for the 19th time in 29
years and seventh time this decade
when it opens tournament play this
weekend.

Women's basketball has just
begun its 2010-11 season, but the
pieces are already in place for an
other run to the Final Four. Stanford
has won 10 consecutive Pac-10 titles
and has made the past three Final
Fours, and this year looks poised to
go at least as far.
The list goes on and on. Despite
the enormous pressure of contend
ing nationally year after year, Stan
ford has made an annual habit of
ranking among the nation's best in
several sports.
We've been lucky to witness the
revival of Stanford football, and we
can only dream that it will one day
match the long-term success of
these other fantastic programs. For
now, though, let's just sit back and
revel in the amazing sporting feats
happening right here on the Farm.
