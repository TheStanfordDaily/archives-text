# BACK ON TOP OF THE PAC â€“ 10
## 
### CAROLINE CASELLI KATHERINE KNOX 
After a whirlwind week filled with a
devastating Big Spike loss to No. 2 Cali
fornia in Berkeley, followed by back-to
back sweeps of the Arizona schools at
Maples Pavilion, the No. 4 Stanford
women's volleyball team managed to
come out on top, earning its fifth consec
utive Pac-10 title and the No. 3 overall
seed in the NCAA Tournament.
On Nov. 19, Stanford (24-3,15-3 Pac
-10) headed to Berkeley (25-3,15-3 Pac
-10) hoping to avenge a loss to the Gold
en Bears earlier this season. The stakes
were especially high both squads en
tered the match with identical 13-2 con
ference records, and with only two
matches remaining afterward against
unranked Arizona State and No. 20 Ari
zona. The winner of the Big Spike would
seemingly emerge as the 2010 Pac-10
champion.
Playing in front of a crowd of more
than 4,300, the Card came up short, nar
rowly winning the first set, 28-26, but
falling to Cal in the following three, 25-
17, 25-17,25-20. Stanford outhit Berke
ley .450 to .349 in the first set, but hit no
better than .190 in the remaining three
while Cal's offense heated up. Defen
sively, Cal had 13 blocks to Stanford's
five.
"Cal is a great team, and they played
their best game against us," said senior
setter/opposite Cassidy Lichtman. "We
did not start strong in any of the sets and
we struggled a lot defensively."
Lichtman registered 12 kills, 24 assists
and 10 digs to earn her third triple-dou
ble of the season, and senior outside hit
ter Alix Klineman had 24 kills and 11
digs for her 12th double-double of the
year.
For Cal, senior setter Carli Lloyd
posted 56 assists, 13 digs and four blocks.
Junior outside hitter Tarah Murrey
matched Klineman's 24 kills, and fresh
man outside hitter Adrienne Gehan and
sophomore opposite Correy Johnson
tallied 12 kills apiece.
With little time to recover, Stanford
closed the Pac-10 schedule in six sets
with back-to-back sweeps over No. 20
Arizona (20-11, 9-9) and Arizona State
(13-18,7-11) over Thanksgiving break.
The Card finished off the Wildcats in
straight sets Wednesday night, despite 30
combined kills from Arizona outside hit
ters Courtney Karst and Tiffany Owens.

Stanford hit .384 on the night led by
Spelman, who put down 10 kills
against Arizona's .284 hitting percent
age.
Each of Stanford's six starting hitters
contributed six or more kills, a testament
to the ability of the Cardinal setters
both Lichtman and sophomore Karissa
Cook to utilize the entire offense,
which created defensive difficulties for
Arizona.
Both teams posted high digging aver
ages, but Cardinal senior libera Gabi
Ailes led the match, adding 15 digs to her
already record-breaking career total. At
the end of the weekend, Ailes had
reached 2,086 career digs, dwarfing the
Stanford program's previous career
record of 1,597.
However, it was the nine blocks post
ed by Stanford that gave the team the
defensive advantage over the Wildcats.
Freshman middle blocker Carly Wopat
contributed four blocks, while Arizona
totaled three blocks overall. Wopat re
mains Stanford's leading blocker for the
season.
The Wildcats' statistics were strong
considering Stanford's evident offensive
advantage throughout the match. Ari
zona State which had just come off a
major upset at Cal two nights before
was less successful on both offense and
defense in Maples on Friday night.
The Card, whose conference title
hopes were revived in light of Cal's loss,
came out fired up for Friday's match, as
a win would ensure a share of the Pac-10
crown.
"We know that anything can happen
in the Pac-10 in any given match so we
went into the match with the mindset
that the championship was not going to
be decided until the last match was
played," Lichtman said. "Actually seeing
the results when Cal lost, though, was
awesome. We were pretty excited to play
on Friday."
The match marked the last home
conference match for Stanford's seniors:
Klineman, Lichtman and Ailes. The
three All-Americans have been impera
tive to Stanford's success this season,
leading the Card in kills, assists and digs,
respectively. Their senior night was one
to be remembered, as Stanford held the
Sun Devils to a .174 hitting percentage,
while Klineman, Lichtman and redshirt
sophomore middle blocker Jessica
Walker all hit over .500 on the night.
With the victory over Arizona State,

the Card clinched a share of the Pac-10
title, the fourth conference champi
onship for this year's senior class.
"Winning the Pac-10 once is an
achievement. Winning it every year is
unbelievable," Lichtman said. "Each
year it feels like it comes down to the last
match because there are so many good
teams. It says so much about the consis
tency of our program that we've been
able to come out on top every time,"
With the Pac-10 season complete,
Stanford will appear in its 30th straight
NCAA Tournament as the No. 3 overall
seed, and the top seed in the Dayton
Region. The Card will host the first two
rounds of the tournament, with its first
match on Friday against Albany (22-8).
Albany, which was riding a seven
match win streak until losing its final
match of the season, claimed the Amer
ica East Conference title on Nov. 20, its
fifth title in the last seven years. The
Great Danes are led by senior outside
hitter Teresa Coppiellie, the 2010
America East player of the year, and
junior defensive specialist Laurie Gon
zalez. Coppiellie recorded 13 double
doubles this season and led the confer
ence with 4.17 kills per set, while Gon
zalez led the conference in digs (5.13 per
set).
On Saturday, the winner of the Stan
ford-Albany match will play the winner
of the other first-round matchup at
Maples on Friday between Colorado
State (25-4) and Cal State Fullerton (26-
5). Should Stanford emerge victorious
from the first two rounds, the Card
would travel to Dayton, Ohio for the
Dayton Regional on Dec. 10 and 11,
where it could face Pac-10 foe USC (25-
4), the tournament's sixth overall seed,
and second-highest in the region.
"We are really excited for the post
season to start," Lichtman said. "It's al
most like having a blank slate and I think
it helps renew our focus. Mentally, it's
somewhat refreshing to know that we
have new teams to play and we feel like
we have a good path set up for us. Physi
cally I think we're all just desperately
trying to stay healthy enough and to im
prove a little bit in our last few prac
tices."
Stanford will face Albany on Friday
at 7 p.m. in Maples Pavilion.
