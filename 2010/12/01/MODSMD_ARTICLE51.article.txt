# WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
## Card sweeps South Carolina, Texas 
### JACK BLANCHAT CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Turkey, chicken and beef. All three
were part of a good Thanksgiving week
end for the No. 3 Stanford women's bas
ketball team. The Cardinal polished off
South Carolina 70-32 on Friday night,
then topped Texas 93-78 on Sunday after
noon, stretching the team's record to a
perfect 5-0.
In Friday's contest with the Game

cocks (2-4), the Cardinal revved up early
and dominated the entire game. The Car
dinal stormed out to a 35-11 lead by half
time and cruised in the second half to the
38-point victory, the largest margin of
victory for the Cardinal so far this season.
Senior guard Jeanette Pohlen led the
way against South Carolina, with 14
points on four three-pointers. All five
Cardinal starters finished with at least
nine points; senior forward Kayla Peder
sen finished with 11 points, forwards

Nnemkadi Ogwumike and Joslyn Tinkle
each had 10 points and freshman Chiney
Ogwumike chipped in nine.
When all was said and done, the Car
dinal had captured its first truly domi
nant victory of the year. In the two games
prior to Stanford's romp of the Game
cocks, the Card had squeaked out a nine
point victory over Utah and a six-point
victory over Gonzaga.
Both of the uncharacteristically close
games fell on Stanford's first road trip of

the season, and the Cardinal came back
to Maples looking to play a dominant
game a game that had eluded the
team until Friday.
"We're still trying to find our identi
ty," Pohlen said. "We have a lot of really
athletic players who can contribute of
fensively and defensively. We're trying to
put it all together."
The Cardinal's huge margin of victory
wasn't due to massive scoring from
the offense, but instead a stingy de
fense that held South Carolina to a
meager 21.8 percent shooting from
the floor, including a stretch of al
most 10 minutes during which the
Gamecocks failed to score a single
point.
Stanford brought that power
into Sunday's game against the
Longhorns, but Texas gave the Card
all it had before fading down the
stretch.
The game started in an unusually
auspicious fashion for the Cardinal
when the Texas coaching staff failed to
turn in the starting lineups before
tipoff, leading to a technical foul on the
Horns. The technical sent Pedersen to
the free-throw line, where she drained
both shots to give Stanford a 2-0 lead
before the game had even started.
When the game got underway,
Texas came out firing, draining
three consecutive three-pointers
while jumping out to a 9-6 lead just
four minutes into the game. Stan
ford responded with a 28-9 run over
the next 11 minutes to grab a 34-18
lead after freshman guard Toni Ko
kenis knocked down a three follow
ing a Pedersen steal.
Stanford stretched the lead to as
high as 18 points in the first half
thanks to huge contributions off the
bench from Kokenis, who had seven
points in the first period of play, and
junior forward Sarah Boothe, who
added eight points early on.
But even after Boothe made a
jumper to push the lead to 18 with
2:50 to go in the first half, the Long
horns refused to quit. An aggressive
full-court press from the Horns led
to three Stanford turnovers, while
Texas guards Ashleigh Fontenette
and Chassidy Fussell scored five

points apiece in the last two minutes
and 30 seconds of the half to cut
Stanford's lead to 49-39 at the
break.
In the second half, the Long
horns continued their aggressive
play, cutting the Stanford lead to six
points just two minutes into the final
period, and causing both Nnemkadi
Ogwumike and Pedersen to pick up
their third personal fouls with over
17 minutes remaining in the game.
Luckily for the Cardinal, the
cream rose to the top when the team
needed it most. After the Longhorns
got within striking distance, Stan
ford's "Big Three" Pedersen,
Nnemkadi Ogwumike and Pohlen
put the team on their backs.
In the next 14 minutes of the
game, the "Big Three" scored 28 of
the 38 points that stretched the Stan
ford lead to 23, allowing the Cardinal
to cruise to the 93-78 final.
When the final buzzer sounded,
Nnemkadi Ogwumike had 22 points,
Pedersen had 19 points (and 12 re
bounds), and Chiney Ogwumike and
Boothe each had 14 points. Kokenis
and Pohlen had eight points each,
and Pohlen added six assists to lead
the team.
After a tough, physical game in
which four players had three or more
fouls, head coach Tara VanDerveer
praised her team for rising to the oc
casion, and complimented Kokenis's
play.
"I think the story for me today
was Toni... Her speed and quick
ness helped her get into the things
that we wanted to do," VanDerveer
said. "You saw some mistakes be
tween Toni and Chiney [Ogwumike],
but we need [Toni's] speed, we need
her quickness and we need her de
fense."
VanDerveer even invoked the
name of Stanford's biggest star in
her commendation of the freshman.
"With Andrew Luck, as great of a
player as he is, he redshirted his
freshman year," VanDerveer said.

"We're throwing Toni right in there,
and today she had to be out there on
her own and she really stepped up."
VanDerveer also said that her
team is closer to finding the identity
it has been searching for, and her star
players echoed those sentiments.
"After these last two games, I
would say that we definitely are clos
er, but not closer to the end, so to
speak," said Nnemkadi Ogwumike.
"We're focusing on doing the little
things right."
Boothe noted that the collective
team effort, combined with a sense
of trust among the players, was in
strumental in the Cardinal hitting its
stride.
"Now we have faith in each other
that whoever's on the court, we can
get the job done," she said. "Even if
[the Big Three] just need a break,
you know you have someone on the
bench... who can get the job done,"
"Honestly, we have seven
starters," VanDerveer agreed. "Toni
and Sarah, in my mind, are starters
for us."
With final exams looming, Stan
ford won't play again until Dec. 12,
when the Cardinal will square off
with Fresno State in Maples Pavil
ion.
VanDerveer, who needs just two
more victories to reach 800 career
wins, was hardly enthused with the
interim between games, but conced
ed, "I have no choice, so I like [the
break]."
Pedersen, however, had a
brighter outlook on what the upcom
ing couple of weeks will mean for the
team: another opportunity to im
prove.
"We're going to look at those two
weeks of practice and see what ways
can we get better," she said. "We're
hungry to practice; we're hungry to
push each other; we're hungry to get
better."

Both of the uncharacteristically close
games fell on Stanford's first road trip of

the season, and the Cardinal came back
to Maples looking to play a dominant
game a game that had eluded the
team until Friday.
"We're still trying to find our identi
ty," Pohlen said. "We have a lot of really
athletic players who can contribute of
fensively and defensively. We're trying to
put it all together."
The Cardinal's huge margin of victory
wasn't due to massive scoring from
the offense, but instead a stingy de
fense that held South Carolina to a
meager 21.8 percent shooting from
the floor, including a stretch of al
most 10 minutes during which the
Gamecocks failed to score a single
point.
Stanford brought that power
into Sunday's game against the
Longhorns, but Texas gave the Card
all it had before fading down the
stretch.
The game started in an unusually
auspicious fashion for the Cardinal
when the Texas coaching staff failed to
turn in the starting lineups before
tipoff, leading to a technical foul on the
Horns. The technical sent Pedersen to
the free-throw line, where she drained
both shots to give Stanford a 2-0 lead
before the game had even started.
When the game got underway,
Texas came out firing, draining
three consecutive three-pointers
while jumping out to a 9-6 lead just
four minutes into the game. Stan
ford responded with a 28-9 run over
the next 11 minutes to grab a 34-18
lead after freshman guard Toni Ko
kenis knocked down a three follow
ing a Pedersen steal.
Stanford stretched the lead to as
high as 18 points in the first half
thanks to huge contributions off the
bench from Kokenis, who had seven
points in the first period of play, and
junior forward Sarah Boothe, who
added eight points early on.
But even after Boothe made a
jumper to push the lead to 18 with
2:50 to go in the first half, the Long
horns refused to quit. An aggressive
full-court press from the Horns led
to three Stanford turnovers, while
Texas guards Ashleigh Fontenette
and Chassidy Fussell scored five

points apiece in the last two minutes
and 30 seconds of the half to cut
Stanford's lead to 49-39 at the
break.
In the second half, the Long
horns continued their aggressive
play, cutting the Stanford lead to six
points just two minutes into the final
period, and causing both Nnemkadi
Ogwumike and Pedersen to pick up
their third personal fouls with over
17 minutes remaining in the game.
Luckily for the Cardinal, the
cream rose to the top when the team
needed it most. After the Longhorns
got within striking distance, Stan
ford's "Big Three" Pedersen,
Nnemkadi Ogwumike and Pohlen
put the team on their backs.
In the next 14 minutes of the
game, the "Big Three" scored 28 of
the 38 points that stretched the Stan
ford lead to 23, allowing the Cardinal
to cruise to the 93-78 final.
When the final buzzer sounded,
Nnemkadi Ogwumike had 22 points,
Pedersen had 19 points (and 12 re
bounds), and Chiney Ogwumike and
Boothe each had 14 points. Kokenis
and Pohlen had eight points each,
and Pohlen added six assists to lead
the team.
After a tough, physical game in
which four players had three or more
fouls, head coach Tara VanDerveer
praised her team for rising to the oc
casion, and complimented Kokenis's
play.
"I think the story for me today
was Toni... Her speed and quick
ness helped her get into the things
that we wanted to do," VanDerveer
said. "You saw some mistakes be
tween Toni and Chiney [Ogwumike],
but we need [Toni's] speed, we need
her quickness and we need her de
fense."
VanDerveer even invoked the
name of Stanford's biggest star in
her commendation of the freshman.
"With Andrew Luck, as great of a
player as he is, he redshirted his
freshman year," VanDerveer said.

"We're throwing Toni right in there,
and today she had to be out there on
her own and she really stepped up."
VanDerveer also said that her
team is closer to finding the identity
it has been searching for, and her star
players echoed those sentiments.
"After these last two games, I
would say that we definitely are clos
er, but not closer to the end, so to
speak," said Nnemkadi Ogwumike.
"We're focusing on doing the little
things right."
Boothe noted that the collective
team effort, combined with a sense
of trust among the players, was in
strumental in the Cardinal hitting its
stride.
"Now we have faith in each other
that whoever's on the court, we can
get the job done," she said. "Even if
[the Big Three] just need a break,
you know you have someone on the
bench... who can get the job done,"
"Honestly, we have seven
starters," VanDerveer agreed. "Toni
and Sarah, in my mind, are starters
for us."
With final exams looming, Stan
ford won't play again until Dec. 12,
when the Cardinal will square off
with Fresno State in Maples Pavil
ion.
VanDerveer, who needs just two
more victories to reach 800 career
wins, was hardly enthused with the
interim between games, but conced
ed, "I have no choice, so I like [the
break]."
Pedersen, however, had a
brighter outlook on what the upcom
ing couple of weeks will mean for the
team: another opportunity to im
prove.
"We're going to look at those two
weeks of practice and see what ways
can we get better," she said. "We're
hungry to practice; we're hungry to
push each other; we're hungry to get
better."

Turkey, chicken and beef. All three
were part of a good Thanksgiving week
end for the No. 3 Stanford women's bas
ketball team. The Cardinal polished off
South Carolina 70-32 on Friday night,
then topped Texas 93-78 on Sunday after
noon, stretching the team's record to a
perfect 5-0.
In Friday's contest with the Game

cocks (2-4), the Cardinal revved up early
and dominated the entire game. The Car
dinal stormed out to a 35-11 lead by half
time and cruised in the second half to the
38-point victory, the largest margin of
victory for the Cardinal so far this season.
Senior guard Jeanette Pohlen led the
way against South Carolina, with 14
points on four three-pointers. All five
Cardinal starters finished with at least
nine points; senior forward Kayla Peder
sen finished with 11 points, forwards

Nnemkadi Ogwumike and Joslyn Tinkle
each had 10 points and freshman Chiney
Ogwumike chipped in nine.
When all was said and done, the Car
dinal had captured its first truly domi
nant victory of the year. In the two games
prior to Stanford's romp of the Game
cocks, the Card had squeaked out a nine
point victory over Utah and a six-point
victory over Gonzaga.
