## Card sweeps South Carolina, Texas 
### JACK BLANCHAT CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Turkey, chicken and beef. All three
were part of a good Thanksgiving week
end for the No. 3 Stanford women's bas
ketball team. The Cardinal polished off
South Carolina 70-32 on Friday night,
then topped Texas 93-78 on Sunday after
noon, stretching the team's record to a
perfect 5-0.
In Friday's contest with the Game

cocks (2-4), the Cardinal revved up early
and dominated the entire game. The Car
dinal stormed out to a 35-11 lead by half
time and cruised in the second half to the
38-point victory, the largest margin of
victory for the Cardinal so far this season.
Senior guard Jeanette Pohlen led the
way against South Carolina, with 14
points on four three-pointers. All five
Cardinal starters finished with at least
nine points; senior forward Kayla Peder
sen finished with 11 points, forwards

Nnemkadi Ogwumike and Joslyn Tinkle
each had 10 points and freshman Chiney
Ogwumike chipped in nine.
When all was said and done, the Car
dinal had captured its first truly domi
nant victory of the year. In the two games
prior to Stanford's romp of the Game
cocks, the Card had squeaked out a nine
point victory over Utah and a six-point
victory over Gonzaga.
Both of the uncharacteristically close
games fell on Stanford's first road trip of

the season, and the Cardinal came back
to Maples looking to play a dominant
game a game that had eluded the
team until Friday.
"We're still trying to find our identi
ty," Pohlen said. "We have a lot of really
athletic players who can contribute of
fensively and defensively. We're trying to
put it all together."
