### CAROLINE CASELLI DESK EDITOR 
After dazzling the crowd on the Farm
with three blowout wins to open the sea
son, the Stanford men's basketball team
headed south for the Thanksgiving
weekend, winning one game and drop
ping two at the 76 Classic in Anaheim,
Calif. With an overtime victory over De-
Paul on Sunday, the Card ended a two
game slump and improved to 4-2 over
all.
On Nov. 19, before hitting the road,
Stanford faced visiting Southwestern
Athletic Conference (SWAC) opponent
Arkansas-Pine Bluff at Maples Pavilion.
Impressive three-point shooting par
ticularly from senior guard Allen Smith
enabled Arkansas-Pine Bluff (0-6) to
hang with Stanford throughout the first
half, but foul trouble and the Card's size
plagued the Golden Lions in the second
half After a mere seven-point halftime
lead, Stanford pulled away, winning the
game 92-49.
"I think it was a really good game for
us to play," said Stanford head coach
Johnny Dawkins. "From the standpoint
that we were able to have a lot of guys
come into the game and compete, and
that we were able to get better from this
experience."
Early on, Smith was the Golden
Lions' offense, hitting six three-pointers
three of which came on consecutive
shot attempts in the first half alone,
accounting for 18 of the team's 28 points.
Smith finished with a game-high 23
points, despite being held to just five in
the second half.
"We lost him too many times ... so
we decided to stay home on him the en
tire second half and try to make it more
difficult for him to find open looks,"
Dawkins said of the defensive adjust
ments in the second half. "Our guys did a
good job being very disciplined in doing
that."
Dawkins managed to work every

uniformed player into the lineup, with 12
players putting up points for the Card.
Junior guard Jeremy Green led the team
with 21 points on 6-of-13 shooting. Red
shirt junior forward Josh Owens had 14
points and nine rebounds, and freshman
forward Dwight Powell added 12 points.
"It's always exciting to get out there
it definitely felt good," said Powell
after the game. "It has been a good week,
but moving forward we have a lot of
stuff both as a team and me individu
ally to get ready for."
After a dominant start on the home
front, Stanford readied itself for its first
road trip of the season to the 76 Classic
in Anaheim.
On Thanksgiving Day, the Cardinal
opened tournament play against Mur
ray State (3-3), the defending Ohio Val
ley Conference champion, at the Ana
heim Convention Center. Stanford
trailed the Racers by 14 points in the first
half, but made a late comeback attempt,
only to fall short, losing the game 55-52.
Powell posted a career-best 16 points
in the loss including 12 of the Card's
18 first half points and shot 7-of-10.
Green remained scoreless until the
game's final minute, when he downed
three shots from behind the arc. Owens,
who fouled out with 5:28 left to play, con
tributed 10 points and five rebounds.
Murray State senior guard B.J. Jenk
ins had 15 points, including two free
throws in the game's last 30 seconds that
helped the Racers withstand the Card's
late game surge.
One day later, Stanford fell to Tulsa
(4-2), which only lost once in the 76 Clas
sic, during the first round to eventual
tournament winner Nevada. The Gold
en Hurricane took control of the game
midway through the first hall) and main
tained a comfortable double-digit lead
for the duration of the evening, beating
the Card 65-53.
Stanford's shooting was a tepid 25.9

game. The Card's free throw shooting,
which has been a challenge in the
team's preliminary games, was a re
spectable 83.3 percent, improving on
Stanford's previous best of 66.7 per

Green had 18 of his game-best 20

Hurtt added another 19, along with
five rebounds and three assists. Junior
forward Steven Idlet had a game-best
10 rebounds.

Stanford finished the tournament
on Sunday with an exciting overtime
victory against DePaul (1-4). The
game was evenly matched throughout
regulation the score reached a tie
11 times and a jump shot from Je
remy Green evened the score at 67-67
to send the teams to overtime. DePaul
narrowed Stanford's lead to one at 71-
70, but the Card outscored the Blue
Demons 14-7 in overtime for a final
score of 81-74.

leader in scoring, with 19 points on 8-
16 shooting. Freshman wing Anthony
Brown scored 14 points off the bench,

from the free-throw line, as well as 10
boards and five assists.
The Cardinal experienced a scare
when Green collapsed as he was leav
ing the court post-game, suffering
from dizziness and difficulty breath
ing. After being treated on the scene
by paramedics, Green was taken to a
local hospital, where he was deter
mined to be in stable condition. The
collapse was attributed to exhaustion,

as Green was reportedly battling sick
ness all week. He returned to the Farm
with the team on Sunday.
