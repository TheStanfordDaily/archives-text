### DASH DAVIDSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In what can only be described as a fantastic game, the USC
men's water polo team earned a trip to the NCAA Tourna

On Saturday, in its fourth matchup of the year against top
ranked and top-seeded Cal, Stanford pulled off a rousing
upset, knocking off its rival and propelling itself to its first
MPSF final since 2004.
"It's a great feeling," Vargas said after the Cal match. "The
guys worked hard and they did an outstanding job all the
