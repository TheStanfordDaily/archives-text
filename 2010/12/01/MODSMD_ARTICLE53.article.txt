# CLOSE, BUT NOT QUITE
## Men's water polo falls in triple OT to USC in MPSF Tournament final; season likely over 
### DASH DAVIDSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In what can only be described as a fantastic game, the USC
men's water polo team earned a trip to the NCAA Tourna
ment by defeating Stanford, 8-7, in overtime on Sunday.
Stanford head coach John Vargas, reacting to the loss after
the game, had nothing but praise for how his team played.
"The guys fought hard; they did a good job. I'm proud of
the guys," Vargas said.
What's frustrating for Vargas and his team is the prospect
of what could have been.
In all likelihood this was the final game of the season for
the Stanford men's water polo team. There is only one at
large entry to the NCAA Tournament, and it almost certain
ly will go to No. 1 California. If Stanford had been able to net
a goal before the Trojans in the sudden death period, as it
came ever so close to on a breakaway by senior captain Sage
Wright, or if it had been able to hold off USC's assault at the
end of regulation, the Cardinal would right now be preparing
to head to Berkeley with a chance to play for the NCAA title.
However, Stanford came up just a little bit short in its at
tempt to pull off an upset of a weekend. On Friday, the fourth
seeded Cardinal came from behind to defeat fifth-seeded
UC-Irvine by a score of 8-7, courtesy of a clutch goal late in
the fourth quarter by senior utility Jeffrey Schwimer.
On Saturday, in its fourth matchup of the year against top
ranked and top-seeded Cal, Stanford pulled off a rousing
upset, knocking off its rival and propelling itself to its first
MPSF final since 2004.
"It's a great feeling," Vargas said after the Cal match. "The
guys worked hard and they did an outstanding job all the

guys on the team. A well-deserved
win, I feel, and so we're happy to get
to the finals, but our job's not done."
The game on Sunday was a roller
coaster affair, with ups and downs for
both teams. Three times over the final
three periods Stanford found itself
down by a goal; three times it fought
its way back to tie the game dra
matically scoring twice in the final 10
seconds of a period.
The match featured several ster
ling individual performances
goalie Brain Pingree and driver Sage
Wright for Stanford among them.
It also featured perhaps the rowdi
est and largest water polo crowd of the
season, as contingents from at least
four different schools USC, Cal,
UCLA and Stanford were all in at
tendance and were all loudly cheering
and jeering. Resounding chants alter
nately sprouted up surrounding specif
ic players, such as when USC fans de
rided Cardinal goalie Brian Pingree

and then Stanford fans drowned them
out with an overwhelming chorus of
"Pingree's house,"
Vargas noticed the crowd, saying,
"It was a great crowd; we love it."
The loss was perhaps most diffi
cult for the three seniors on the Car
dinal squad: Wright, Schwimer and
driver Alex Pulido.
Wright, who Vargas called "very
special" and "incredible," took the
time to reflect on the final game of his
collegiate water polo career.
"First you feel like, what just hap
pened? And then, you know, those
close plays flash through your mind.
But then you see your teammates,
and that's what makes the season and
makes the team and makes the
sport," Wright said after the loss.
The season very well might be
over for the Stanford men's water
polo team, but as Wright says, it really
is not all about winning and losing.
Besides, if its season is fated to have
ended late Sunday afternoon at
Avery Aquatic Center, the Cardinal
left it all out in the pool.
