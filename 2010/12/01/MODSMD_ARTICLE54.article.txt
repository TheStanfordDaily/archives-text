# Stanford's Bowl Scenarios
## Orange or Fiesta Bowl most likely 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY MANAGING EDITOR 
Another week of college football
is in the books, and the new, penulti
mate BCS standings of the regular

season have been released. The
news: wonderful for Stanford.
The Cardinal sits at No. 4; that

slot ensures that Stanford will re
ceive a guaranteed bid to a BCS
bowl game. (See provision six
under "Automatic Qualification.")

Of course, this positioning has to hold, and there is
still one weekend of football left to be played. However,

we can state with complete confidence that it is

virtually impossible for Stanford to be

leapt in the BCS rankings next weekend.

The Cardinal expanded its lead
over No. 5 Wisconsin this weekend,
going from a .0075 margin to a .0228
difference. That's wide enough to be
considered "comfortable." Addition
ally, Stanford's computer average
ranking was fourth; Wisconsin's was
seventh and No. 6 Ohio State's was
ninth. With all three schools having

completed their regular seasons, there is no reason for
there to be much movement in any direction. Although,
theoretically, anything can happen-all of the voters in

the Coaches' and Harris Polls can embed various

cocktails of narcotics before casting their bal
lots, or something like that-it is almost accepted

fact that Stanford will maintain its No. 4 ranking in '

next week's final BCS rankings.
It boils down to this: Stanford will be
playing in one of the five BCS bowls. But
which one? If you want the short version:
start packing for either Glendale (Fiesta
Bowl) or Miami (Orange Bowl), because
those are the most likely options. Here are the

scenarios:
1. Oregon beats Oregon State; Auburn beats South
Carolina; and Connecticut OR Pittsburgh wins the Big

East
2. Oregon beats Oregon State; Auburn beats
South Carolina; and West Virginia wins the Big

iiast
3. Oregon beats Oregon State; South
Carolina beats Auburn; and West Vir
ginia, Connecticut OR Pittsburgh wins
the Big East
4. Oregon State beats Oregon;
Auburn beats South Carolina; and Con
necticut OR Pittsburgh wins the Big East
5. Oregon State beats Oregon; Auburn

the Big East

beats South Carolina; and West Virginia wins

6. Oregon State beats Oregon; South
Carolina beats Auburn; and West
Virginia, Connecticut OR Pitts
burgh wins the Big East

Let's examine the options

under each of the six:

1. Oregon beats Oregon State;
Auburn beats South Carolina; and
Connecticut OR Pittsburgh wins

the Big East

Likely Bowl Game: Orange.

Possible Bowl Games: Fiesta, Orange, Sugar.

If Oregon and Auburn both win, that locks in

the title game and, by extension, the Rose

Bowl, as TCU would be automatically

selected for the open spot usually re
served for the Pac-10 team. This
takes two bowls off the table. How
ever, there is an obscure provision
that could get Stanford into the
Rose Bowl. Jon Wilner explains:
"Now, there is a little
known rule buried deep within the
BCS manual that gives the confer

ence commissioners the authority to overrule

any bowl selection based on what's essentially a 'good of
the game' clause.

"I'm not sure the honchos have ever gone
down that path and seriously doubt they would this
year to get Stanford into the Rose and sendTCU to
I another BCS game."

As he says: not much of a possibility.
It makes sense on two levels-Pac-10 tradition
and Stanford's large southern California
alumni base-but it would be such a drastic
and unprecedented move that it appears
quite unlikely.The potential use of the "good
of the game" clause comes into play in sce

narios one, two, four and five, but this is the lone time
we're going to mention it.

So: Rose Bowl and the title game are out. That

leaves the Fiesta, Orange and Sugar Bowls. The

order of selection for the bowls this year is:
Sugar, Orange then Fiesta.

The Sugar Bowl is the traditional
landing spot of the SEC champion, but
since Auburn would be playing in the
title game, it would likely fill the spot
with another team from the conference.
That would be either Arkansas or LSU.
Since the Sugar Bowl would have lost its
