# England's World Cup case
## 
### Tom Taylor 
Despite the continuing suc
cess story that is Cardinal
football, the world's biggest
sports story this week has
got to be the unveiling of the
candidates to host two upcoming FIFA
World Cups: England, Belgium/Nether
lands, Russia and Spain/Portugal in 2018,
and Australia, Japan, Qatar, South Korea
and the United States in 2022.

I could easily write a long column ar
guing why England and Australia should
get the right to host these tournaments, or
explain why I dread that Spain/Portugal
and Qatar may instead win sufficient
votes, but that would achieve nothing
more than echoing the increasingly bi
ased and bitter process the whole bidding
procedure has become.
Noneofthepotential victors on Dec. 2
will be able to come out of this with their
heads held high knowing they have ran a
clean and fair race; at best, they will only
be able to claim that they did nothing
worse than their competitor's. Lingering
doubts about an opaque process that has
seemingly encouraged corruption and
collusion will be hard to banish.
So instead I want to ask the question:
What do we really want from a World
Cup?
Last summer's tournament was paint
ed as a major milestone for the African
continent, a great opportunity that would
help unite all the people of South Africa
and bring prosperity to everyone: black or
white, rich or poor. Yet two of my lasting
memories of the World Cup are of seeing
reports of street vendors being excluded
from the areas near the stadiums in order
to protect the rights of major sponsors, and
of the fact that the official tournament ball,
the Jabulani, was so expensive that even
middle-class kids in the Western world
would struggle to get their hands on one.
Roll the clock back two years to the
Beijing Olympics and the story is even
worse. One of the justifications for giv
ing China the 2008 Games was that it
would act as a major incentive to im
prove its human-rights record, and Chi
nese authorities even pledged that this
would be the case. In reality, the tourna
ment became the complete opposite,
and abuses were committed in the very
name of the Olympics: forcibly ejecting
people from their homes to make way
for sporting facilities; detaining large
numbers of dissidents in the lead up to
the games; and generally doing any
thing to create an idealized image of the
country in the restrictive tourist bubble
around the event.
FIFA continues with its inspiring
rhetoric and grand visions of changing
the world when talking about the World
Cup, and the bidding nations never fail to
echo this in their sycophantic efforts to
please, but should we really believe that a
simple sporting event has such power?
The 1936 Berlin Olympics didn't exactly
do much for world peace.
One of the major criticisms leveled at
the 2018 English bid has been the actions
of the British press. In recent months, The
Sunday Times published an investigation
of corruption that led to the suspension
of several high-ranking FIFA members
—including two from the Executive
Committee and just days before the
actual vote, a BBC Panorama documen
tary on corruption within the governing
body was due to air.
In response, commentators from
other countries have remarked that this
would never be allowed in their home
lands, and some political pressure has
even been put on these media outlets
from within the UK.
How can we really place our faith in
the World Cup when freedom —in this

case freedom of the press —is seen as
such a threat to it?
Perhaps instead of trying to actively
use the World Cup to make the world a
better place, we should be using it simply
to celebrate positive changes that have al
ready taken place.
On this basis the tournament in South
Africa comes out in a completely differ
ent light. The country may have failed to
live up to the promises of its transition to
democracy and in many ways is still just as
divided as ever, yet few would argue that
life is not better than under the cruel yoke
of apartheid.The relatively peaceful tran
sition, without a civil war, in the early '9os
is certainly something worthy of winning
this major international prize.
Though unable to claim the same sort
of political transformation, England too
has something to celebrate.
In the late 'Bos, soccer hooliganism
seemed to be destroying the sport in its
ancestral homeland. English clubs re
ceived a lengthy European ban after the
Heysel stadium disaster in 1985 and al
most a hundred fans died at Hillsbor
ough in 1989. But then everything
changed, tough rules were brought in
that revolutionized the game in the UK,
and suddenly even families with young
children began to return to the once-vi
olent stadiums. There may still be isolat
ed incidents, but the transformation has
been so complete that reports and im
ages of fans of foreign teams engaged in
violent or racist demonstrations now
seems pretty shocking stuff for the once
bad-boy nation of the world game.
Instead of elusive dreams for the fu
ture, this is what the English bid should
have concentrated on: its hard-won cam
paign against violence and intolerance
and how it has already changed the
world.

cer hooligans from the 'Bos. Reminisce
