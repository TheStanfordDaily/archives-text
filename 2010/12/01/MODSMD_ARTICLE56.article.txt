# CROSS COUNTRY
## Falling behind at nationals 
### ZACH ZIMMERMAN DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford men's and women's
cross country teams fell short in their
quests to win Stanford's 100 th team
title after respective subpar perform
ances at the NCAA Championships
for the second consecutive year. The
men's team finished in fourth place,
while the women could only muster a
13th-place finish.
Liberty's Sam Chelanga ran his
trademark-style race, and blazed out to
a strong lead to win the men's individ
ual title for the second straight year
with a time of 29:22.2. Arizona's
Stephen Sambu, the eventual runner
up, followed him closely for the major
ity of the race, finishing just behind one
of the best collegiate distance runners
in recent memory in 29:26.5. While
Chelanga and Sambu had gold and sil
ver wrapped up long before the race
was over, the real chess match took
place behind the top two, as the nation
al powerhouses engaged in a strategic
battle for the team title.
The No. 1 Cardinal men, who had
been dominant in every race leading
up to the Nov. 22 meet in Terre Llaute,
Ind., elected once again to group its top
runners â€”juniors Chris Derrick and
Jake Riley and senior Elliott Heath
together in hopes of securing three
spots in the top 10. Plagued by injuries
to veteran junior runners Brendan
Gregg and Benjamin Johnson, Stan
ford would need its stars to run at their
absolute best.
Derrick and Riley came through,
finishing fifth and sixth with times of
29:44.7 and 29:45.0, respectively. Un
fortunately, Heath struggled in the

final cross country race of his collegiate
career, as he fell behind his teammates'
pace and finished with a disappointing
time of 30:35.5, good enough for 42nd.
Senior J.T. Sullivan and freshman
Erik Olson rounded out the top five
for Stanford, finishing in 100 th and
132 nd, respectively.
Oklahoma State repeated as na
tional champions, followed by Florida
State, Wisconsin and Stanford.
The Cardinal women fared even
worse at the top, with sophomore
Kathy Kroeger, the team's No. 1 run
ner in every race this season, unable to
complete the 8,000-meter course due
to injury. Stanford turned to redshirt
junior Steph Marcy for a much-needed
boost, but her team-best finish of 55th
was not enough to vault the Cardinal
into the top 10.
Sophomore Alex Dunne and fresh
man Jessica Tonn finished in 85th and
96th, respectively, earning valuable ex
perience at nationals while boosting
the Cardinal with top-100 finishes. Ju
nior Georgia Griffin and senior Alex
Gits completed the scoring for Stan
ford, who ended the season in near
tragic fashion after capturing the Pac
-10 title just weeks earlier.
The Villanova women joined the
Oklahoma State men as repeat nation
al champions, earning the top team
spot ahead of Florida State, Texas Tech
and Georgetown.
With the cross country season com
plete, Stanford's distance runners will
turn their focus to the indoor track and
field season, which is scheduled to
begin just after winter break.
