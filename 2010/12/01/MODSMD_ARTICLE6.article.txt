## RESEARCH Professor, APA dispute ghostwriting charge Schatzberg and co-author maintain they did not use industry ghostwriters 
### ELIZABETH TITUS EDITOR IN CHIEF 
A watchdog group this week urged the National Institutes of
Health to put an end to "ghostwriting," alleging that scientific
publications by some federally funded researchers were actually
written by drug and marketing companies including one book
co-written by Stanford psychiatry professor Alan Schatzberg.
The Washington group, Project on Government Oversight,
bases its allegations on documents made public in a lawsuit
against GlaxoSmithKline related to the drug Paxil, as The New
York Times first reported on Tuesday.
The documents include a draft of the book "Recognition
and Treatment of Psychiatric Disorders: A Psychopharmacolo
gy Handbook for Primary Care," which was published in 1999
by American Psychiatric Publishing, Inc. (APPI), a branch of
the American Psychiatric Association (APA). The draft was
"developed" by two writers for the medical publishing compa
ny Scientific Therapeutics Information (STI) of New Jersey
under an "educational grant" from drug company SmithKline
Beecham Pharmaceuticals (now GlaxoSmithKline), according
to the document. Schatzberg and Charles Nemeroff, at the time
chairman of psychiatry at Emory University, are the book's au
thors, the draft said.
Also among the documents was a 1997 letter from STI editor
Sally Laden to Nemeroff describing the company's timeline for
completing the book. The timeline included several dates when
drafts of the book would go to the co-authors and the "sponsor"
for comments, "sign-off" and "final approval."
"You and Alan [Schatzberg] are in good hands with Diane
[Coniglio, an STI writer]," Laden wrote to Nemeroff
Schatzberg is the former president of the APA, which issued a
statement on Tuesday condemning the ghostwriting allegations
as untrue.
"Unrestricted" grants, such as the one SmithKline Beecham
awarded for the book, "support specific projects" but do not
allow companies to control books' content, the APA said.
"From our perspective, timeline and details in the letter were
never approved by APPI [the publisher] or the authors," the
statement added.
"This type of editorial assistance was quite common, especial
ly the use of editorial experts to compile and check facts in books
on pharmacology," said Ron McMillen, chief executive of APPI,
in the statement. "To say the book was ghostwritten is not true."
He added the authors and the publisher did not sign a contract
until two years after the letter from Laden, and that the book was
peer-reviewed by eight physicians.
Schatzberg, Nemeroff and STI did not return requests for
comment.
Schatzberg, the chairman of psychiatry and behavioral sci
ences at Stanford for 19 years before stepping down this sum
mer, faced congressional scrutiny in 2008 when Sen. Chuck
Grassley (R-Iowa) raised questions about Schatzberg's stock
holdings in a drug company related to the professor's federally
funded research. Stanford attorneys at the time said the Univer
sity took "appropriate steps" to prevent a conflict of interest.
Schatzberg ultimately resigned as principal investigator for the
grant.
Since then, the Stanford School of Medicine has revised the
ethics policy it implemented in 2006, called the Stanford Industry
Interactions Policy. Earlier this year it prohibited adjunct clinical
faculty volunteer teachers who often work in private practices
from giving paid speeches written by drug and medical-device
companies.
The policy also forbids faculty, students and staff from engag
ing in ghostwriting: "in other words, individuals may not publish
articles under their own names that are written in whole or ma
terial part by industry employees," it says.
As medical school spokesman Paul Costello pointed out,
Stanford's ghostwriting policy would not have been in effect in
1999, when the book was published. He added that Schatzberg
and the APA "strongly deny that the manuscript was ghostwrit
ten."
On Tuesday, doctors spoke critically to The Times about
SmithKline Beecham's alleged influence on the book. And
members of the watchdog group, including former Grassley
staffer Paul Thacker, pointed to other examples of what they
called ghostwriting among federally funded researchers.
But Schatzberg told The Times that's not what happened
here. SmithKline Beecham was not involved in the book's con
tent and the 1997 letter was "a theoretical proposal that bears lit
tle, if any relationship to what actually happened," he said in an
e-mail, adding: "An unrestricted grant does not give the compa
ny any right of sign-off on content and in fact they had no sign
off in content."
