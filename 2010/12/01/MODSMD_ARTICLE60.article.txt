## Kappa Sig preps for benefit concert

Fundraising has never sounded this good.
The fraternity Kappa Sigma will host the
Save the Music Benefit Concert on
Thursday, Dec. 2, bringing Talisman, The Sea
People and Stanford Hip Hop Congress to Old

Union for a Dead Week music interlude.
The fraternity, along with corporate spon
sors Stanford Bookstore, HP-Intel, Dell,
Heffernon Insurance, Future Freshman and
Treehouse, are donating all proceeds to the
VHI Save the Music Foundation. Founded in
1977, the foundation had donated over $45
million-worth of musical instruments to stu
dents in public school systems across the U.S.
with the rationale that music is an integral part

of child development.
The Stanford con
cert, free to attendees,
will feature 20-minute

sets from eight student acts.

Set to perform are bands Whale Rider, Charlie
Brown, The Sea People and Stanford Hip Hop
Congress, a cappella groups Everyday People
and Talisman, and solo acts from Colin Casey

'l2 and Jamaica Osorio 'l2.
"The idea of it is to, number one, raise
money for the VHI Save the Music Foundation
and also celebrate the strength and diversity of
music at Stanford," said Casey, also the head

organizer of the event. "One of the great parts
of the school is that there are so many people
that play music and take part in music."
This is the first benefit for the fraternity,
though Casey organized a CoHo music night
last year as an Apple campus rep. In recent

years, many Kappa Sig members have been
dedicated to music, and the idea of incorporat
ing the Stanford community in a fundraising
concert "emerged organically," according to
Casey.

The Save the Music Benefit Concert will
take place Thursday, Dec. 2, from 7:30-11 p.m.,
in the Old Union courtyard. Admission is free,
though donations are encouraged, with the

bulk of the fundraising dollars coming from
the corporate sponsors.
