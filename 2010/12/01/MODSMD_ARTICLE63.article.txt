As November gives way to
December, Christmas lights
begin to dot the streets,
Starbucks breaks out its festive red
cups and the annual holiday crop of
"Nutcracker" productions springs up.
For decades, the iconic images of
a mysteriously expanding tree, a rat
king and his posse of mice, an
enchanting swirl of snowflakes and
an intoxicating land of sweets have
been entwined with an American
Christmas tradition. The notes of
Tchaikovsky's score beckon audi
ences into a two-act tale of holiday
reverie...
Drosselmeyer's Christmas gift to
Clara is a nutcracker doll, one that
transforms first into a life-sized sol
dier to defeat the advances of a men
acing army of mice and later into a
prince. He whisks Clara away on a
journey through twirling snowflakes
to the majestic land where flowers
waltz merrily and Arabian coffee,
Chinese tea, Spanish chocolate and
the dazzling Sugar Plum Fairy take
human form and treat her to vibrant
dances.
This American tradition derives
from a Russian ballet, premiered at
the Mariinsky Theatre in St.
Petersburg in 1892 to a mediocre
reception. Marius Petipa and Lev
Ivanov, the same choreographic duo
that revived "Swan Lake" three years
later, were responsible for the origi
nal, adapted from E.T.A. Hoffman's
story of "The Nutcracker and the
Mouse King."

San Francisco Ballet designed
our nation's first "Nutcracker" in
1944, but it was George Balanchine's
1954 production for New York City
Ballet that truly marked the begin
ning of an era. Televised in 1957 and
again in 1958 a time when ballet
in the U.S. was still in its infancy— it
captured the imaginations of youth
ful viewers across the country and
never let go.
New York City Ballet has
mounted "The Nutcracker" each hol
iday season without exception since
its premiere. Major ballet companies
from coast to coast perform dozens
of "Nutcracker" permutations
between every Thanksgiving and
New Year. As the economy falters and
dance ventures struggle to stay afloat,
annual "Nutcracker" runs continue
to be a revenue powerhouse. The
repertory staple helps to fund the
remainder of most companies' sea
sons.
Many a choreographer has set
out to reinterpret the ballet or associ
ate it with a particular cultural her
itage, incorporating contemporary
movement and themes. Hip-hop, tap
and even burlesque have made their
"Nutcracker" debuts. And, of course,
"The Nutcracker" is an institution in
ballet schools across the nation.

Aspiring dancers grow up with the
ballet, from the day they first scurry
around the stage in the Act I party
scene, to the years they don tutus for
the mirlitons or waltz of the flowers,
and culminating with the experience

of stepping out of the wings as Dew
Drop, Snow Queen or Sugar Plum.
Through the years, "The
Nutcracker" has become a
Christmastime tradition. Its influ
ence has extended beyond the stage
and slowly trickled into popular cul
ture. Film versions have starred
Macaulay Culkin (1993), an animat
ed Barbie (2001) and, now in the
aters, Elle Fanning and Nathan Lane.
Tchaikovsky's instantly recognizable
melodies drift endlessly from depart
ment store speakers and accompany
holiday-themed ads this year's
Planter's peanuts commercial fea
tures a wooden nutcracker doll and
his wounded peanut colleagues.
For those who have seen only
one ballet in their lifetime, it was
more than likely "The Nutcracker." A
two- (rather than four-) act format
provides a more palatable point of
entry into the canon of classical bal
let than most other works. The sim
ple plot, bright scenery and efferves
cent dancing speak to audiences of
all ages. More than anything, its
magic is irresistible. "The
Nutcracker" no longer belongs solely
to a ballet repertory; it has been
enveloped by the holiday traditions
that mark the American Christmas
season. 'Tis the season to see "The
Nutcracker."
