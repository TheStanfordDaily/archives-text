## Stanford sophomore plays lead in feature film 
### – mayukh SEN contact mayukh: mayukh@stanford. edu 
For Carly Kohler 'l3, acting is
just a hobby.

"I can't imagine majoring in
drama," she giggled. "I love
Shakespeare, but I can't, like, kiss
someone I don't know on stage or
anything like that."
A psychology major here at
Stanford, Kohler has something to
her name most Stanford students
don't have a lead role in a fea
ture film. "Behind the Door of a
Secret Girl" chronicles the life of a
depressed, self-mutilating Native
American teenager named Sammy,
played by Kohler herself, and her
struggle to live on a reservation
under her meth-addicted mother
and her mother's drug-pushing
boyfriend.
The film has won seven awards
at various film festivals, and it was
most recently screened at the 2010
American Indian Film Festival in
San Francisco. The director, janessa
Starkey, lived through the same
kind of brutal experience Sammy

endures in the film; Starkey chan
neled her own suffering into a 24-
page short film that later grew into
a full-length feature. Kohler's
father, actor and filmmaker lack
Kohler 'B3, took Starkey under his
wing as a sort of prodigy, shaping
her creative vision.
Although Carly Kohler began
acting at the age of four, "Secret
Girl" marked her first experience
with screen acting.
"It's a difficult role," she admit
ted. "I was worried that I would
become too over-the-top with
histrionics, but I made sure the
film wouldn't become too monoto-

nous with its depressing parts."
Internalizing this role was a
taxing process. Kohler was, in par
ticular, worried about living
Starkey's personal history out on
screen, though she increasingly
found herself drawing from what
she witnessed among friends and
family growing up, to the point
that Kohler didn't feel that her

character's experiences were foreign
to her.
Kohler is, of course, not your
typical Stanford student. She cer
tainly stands out from the crowd
with a streak of electric blue run
ning through her hair, she's all at
once striking, perplexing and beau
tiful. A member of the Yurok and
Karuk tribes, Kohler is heavily
involved with Stanford's American
Indian, Alaskan Native and
Hawaiian on-campus organiza
tions. She's also on Stanford's rugby
team and part of the a cappella
group Counterpoint. Balancing
school life with acting was particu
larly grueling during the end of
Kohler's freshman year, though the
experience of touring film festivals,
she claimed, was ultimately more
rewarding than she anticipated.
"It was really amazing, meeting

all these filmmakers," she said.
"They all came from different walks
of life."
Kohler hopes that this film
will, if anything, dispel some of the
nation's deep-seated stereotypes of
American Indians. By tackling such
rampant problems as drug abuse
and depression that Kohler wit
nessed firsthand among Native
youth groups, "Secret Girl" pene
trates issues merely skimmed over
in other forms of media. The por
trayal of Native Americans in
mainstream American film, such as
"Pocahontas" and "Twilight," has
often bordered on the offensive, she
mentioned, hammering in precon
ceived notions of the American
Indian population.
"I mean, even 'Avatar' just rein
forced so many prejudices about

Native Americans," she said.
"That was a film that continued
to romanticize Native culture,
portraying us as people who are
in touch with nature and all
that. We're always portrayed
from a white man's perspective."
The role, Kohler claims, has
given her a new sort of perspec
tive on her own sense of self —
evident just by observing her
poise and easy confidence. And
she'll be keeping the blue hair.

"It was for the part," she
smiled, taking strands in her
fingers and rubbing them
against each other. "But I liked
it, so I decided to keep it. It
makes me feel like an individ
ual."
