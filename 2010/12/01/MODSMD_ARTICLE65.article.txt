Winter break is coming up, and that means plenty of
good old-fashioned down time. Sure, you could
always catch up with your little sister or shovel the
driveway with your old man, but let's be honest, there's some
thing we're looking forward to more than food or family. With
no classes to worry about and nasty weather keeping us inside,
the holiday season is practically begging to be spent with a
controller in your hand.
Gaming is bigger than ever this year, but don't worry if
you think you're late to the party or you're not hardcore
enough to join in on the fun there's a bevy of great distrac
tions out there for even the least gizmo-inclined among us. So
in honor of going all the way home just to spend time alone,
here are a few games to keep you busy. And the best part?
They're all cheap, and you've probably already got
a laptop (or a smartphone) that can run them.

Portal
If Halo or Call of Duty is too fast
and furious for you or you've never
even heard of them you still owe it
to yourself to check out this darling of
a game. Like those intense shooters,
Portal has you exploring the world
from a first

person perspective. But the simi
larities stop there: instead of blast
ing aliens or sniping terrorists, the
focus is on solving environmental
puzzles based on realistic physics
and a unique little device that can
create, well, portals.
You're tasked with escaping from
a research facility run by an ever-pres
ent (and consistently hilarious) artifi
cial intelligence, all while using your
"portal gun" in increasingly inventive
ways to move from one area to anoth

er. By tapping the left mouse button,
you can tag a wall with a wormhole of

sorts, then tag another surface that
acts as an entrance (or exit) to the
other portal. It's as simple (and com
plicated) as that. Objects, including

yourself, pass through the portals with
their momentum conserved, meaning
you could jump to a portal three sto
ries below you only to have it catapult
you sideways out of a wall high above.
The pacing and humor will drive
you along without overwhelming you,
and the controls remain simple while
the puzzles get gradually tougher.
Even my dad managed to slog his way
through this one with plenty of laughs
along the way, and felt pretty good
about himself at the end of it all.
Portal is a finely tuned piano, but you
don't need any lessons to make beau
tiful music.

Available for PC and Mac, Xbox
360 and PS3
Plants vs. Zombies
Get ready to do a lot of tapping
(or clicking, as the case may be). This
quirky little strategy game pits you
against wave after wave of undead foes
whose only weakness as we all
know is the leafy power of the
plant kingdom. You'll have to manage
your limited solar energy to sow the
appropriate seeds in your besieged

backyard, which is divided into rows
and columns. As the zombie army
ambles forward, your plant posse will
fire off pea-bullets, blow up under
their feet, freeze them in place or sac
rifice itself in order to delay the
oncoming horde. You'll have an enor
mous and varied arsenal of botanical
buddies by game's end, all of which
(along with the equally eclectic array
of zombies) are oozing with charm.
But be careful as you hold off
these tenacious terrors through dark,
light and watery environments you
might find yourself blasting away "just
one more wave" when the clock
strikes midnight at your mom's lame
New Year's party.
Available for PC and Mac, Xbox
360 and iPhone
Peggie
If you're noticing a "P" theme so
far, then bear with me. This gem of a
puzzler comes from the same folks
who made Plants vs. Zombies and
Bejeweled (the appropriately P-named
Pop Cap games), and carries the same
polish and charm. What's more, it's
easily the simplest and most gratifying
game on this list. To play, all you need
to do is aim, shoot and watch. There's
a marble-cannon at the top of the
screen and a unique array of blue and
orange "pegs" on the board below. If
the marble hits a peg, it disappears
after a brief delay. A guide helps to
line up your shots and maximize the
effect of ricochets, which can be a joy

to watch as the music and sound
effects ramp up with every peg you
hit. Add in a cast of silly animal assis
tants and their accompanying super
powers, and you've got a perfect game
for a quick hit of fun whenever there's
a moment to spare.

Prince of Persia (2008)
You won't be playing this one on
your phone or dinky notebook, but if
you've got the means, then Übisoft's
recent revamp of this classic series
demands a look from game junkies
and newcomers alike. The art in
Prince of Persia is evocative of water
color in motion, and there's a distinct
ly blissful Zen in simply moving about
the world.
It helps that the action and plat
forming are simpler than anything
else out there, the combat is infre
quent and simple and the stakes for
failure are low. Thanks to responsive
controls and environmental cues,
there's a flow to moving and fighting
akin to a rhythm game. Even if you
should make a mistake and slip olf a
ledge, you'll be quickly rescued by
your female companion, Elika. Thanks
to her help, in fact, it's nearly impossi
ble to die in Prince of Persia. Besides
always having your back, Elika pro
vides a charismatic and likeable coun
terpart to the charming-rogue person
ality of the prince: the banter between
them doesn't slow down the action
and adds considerable depth to their
increasingly deep relationship, and
you can't help but grow attached to
Elika as you work together to bring
life back to a cursed and tainted
world.
Available for PC, Xbox 360 and
PS3

Winter break is coming up, and that means plenty of
good old-fashioned down time. Sure, you could
always catch up with your little sister or shovel the
driveway with your old man, but let's be honest, there's some
thing we're looking forward to more than food or family. With
no classes to worry about and nasty weather keeping us inside,
the holiday season is practically begging to be spent with a
controller in your hand.
Gaming is bigger than ever this year, but don't worry if
you think you're late to the party or you're not hardcore
enough to join in on the fun there's a bevy of great distrac
tions out there for even the least gizmo-inclined among us. So
in honor of going all the way home just to spend time alone,
here are a few games to keep you busy. And the best part?
They're all cheap, and you've probably already got
a laptop (or a smartphone) that can run them.

Portal
If Halo or Call of Duty is too fast
and furious for you or you've never
even heard of them you still owe it
to yourself to check out this darling of
a game. Like those intense shooters,
Portal has you exploring the world
from a first

person perspective. But the simi
larities stop there: instead of blast
ing aliens or sniping terrorists, the
focus is on solving environmental
puzzles based on realistic physics
and a unique little device that can
create, well, portals.
You're tasked with escaping from
a research facility run by an ever-pres
ent (and consistently hilarious) artifi
cial intelligence, all while using your
"portal gun" in increasingly inventive
ways to move from one area to anoth

er. By tapping the left mouse button,
you can tag a wall with a wormhole of

sorts, then tag another surface that
acts as an entrance (or exit) to the
other portal. It's as simple (and com
plicated) as that. Objects, including

yourself, pass through the portals with
their momentum conserved, meaning
you could jump to a portal three sto
ries below you only to have it catapult
you sideways out of a wall high above.
The pacing and humor will drive
you along without overwhelming you,
and the controls remain simple while
the puzzles get gradually tougher.
Even my dad managed to slog his way
through this one with plenty of laughs
along the way, and felt pretty good
about himself at the end of it all.
Portal is a finely tuned piano, but you
don't need any lessons to make beau
tiful music.

Available for PC and Mac, Xbox
360 and PS3
Plants vs. Zombies
Get ready to do a lot of tapping
(or clicking, as the case may be). This
quirky little strategy game pits you
against wave after wave of undead foes
whose only weakness as we all
know is the leafy power of the
plant kingdom. You'll have to manage
your limited solar energy to sow the
appropriate seeds in your besieged

backyard, which is divided into rows
and columns. As the zombie army
ambles forward, your plant posse will
fire off pea-bullets, blow up under
their feet, freeze them in place or sac
rifice itself in order to delay the
oncoming horde. You'll have an enor
mous and varied arsenal of botanical
buddies by game's end, all of which
(along with the equally eclectic array
of zombies) are oozing with charm.
But be careful as you hold off
these tenacious terrors through dark,
light and watery environments you
might find yourself blasting away "just
one more wave" when the clock
strikes midnight at your mom's lame
New Year's party.
Available for PC and Mac, Xbox
360 and iPhone
Peggie
If you're noticing a "P" theme so
far, then bear with me. This gem of a
puzzler comes from the same folks
who made Plants vs. Zombies and
Bejeweled (the appropriately P-named
Pop Cap games), and carries the same
polish and charm. What's more, it's
easily the simplest and most gratifying
game on this list. To play, all you need
to do is aim, shoot and watch. There's
a marble-cannon at the top of the
screen and a unique array of blue and
orange "pegs" on the board below. If
the marble hits a peg, it disappears
after a brief delay. A guide helps to
line up your shots and maximize the
effect of ricochets, which can be a joy

to watch as the music and sound
effects ramp up with every peg you
hit. Add in a cast of silly animal assis
tants and their accompanying super
powers, and you've got a perfect game
for a quick hit of fun whenever there's
a moment to spare.
Available for PC and Mac, iPhone,
Xbox 360, PS3 and DS
Prince of Persia (2008)
You won't be playing this one on
your phone or dinky notebook, but if
you've got the means, then Übisoft's
recent revamp of this classic series
demands a look from game junkies
and newcomers alike. The art in
Prince of Persia is evocative of water
color in motion, and there's a distinct
ly blissful Zen in simply moving about
the world.
It helps that the action and plat
forming are simpler than anything
else out there, the combat is infre
quent and simple and the stakes for
failure are low. Thanks to responsive
controls and environmental cues,
there's a flow to moving and fighting
akin to a rhythm game. Even if you
should make a mistake and slip olf a
ledge, you'll be quickly rescued by
your female companion, Elika. Thanks
to her help, in fact, it's nearly impossi
ble to die in Prince of Persia. Besides
always having your back, Elika pro
vides a charismatic and likeable coun
terpart to the charming-rogue person
ality of the prince: the banter between
them doesn't slow down the action
and adds considerable depth to their
increasingly deep relationship, and
you can't help but grow attached to
Elika as you work together to bring
life back to a cursed and tainted
world.
Available for PC, Xbox 360 and
PS3
