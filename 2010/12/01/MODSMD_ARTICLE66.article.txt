"Great enthu
siasm, terrible tim-

ingsays Sean
(Stanley Tucci) to Ali
(Christina Aguilera) as she
hounds him backstage, begging for a
job in Steven Antin's latest,
"Burlesque." This line adequately
sums up the film it's an enthusias
tic musical featuring very catchy
music, but it fails to match that with a
good plot or decent writing.

The movie centers on Alice "Ali"
Rose (Aguilera), an aspiring per
former from a small lowa town who
drops everything to move to L.A. to
pursue her dream. There, she quickly
happens upon Burlesque, an upscale
but faltering Burlesque theater run by
sassy former star Tess (Cher). As Ali
works her way up at the theater, first
as a waitress and eventually as a
dancer, Tess struggles to keep the the
ater afloat after amassing enormous
debt. Ali also struggles with her new
found fame, made even more trouble
some by her budding relationship
with her new roommate, Marcus
(Cam Gigandet).
The plot is incredibly cliche, but
serves its purpose as a springboard for
the movie's many musical numbers,
which are appropriately glitzy and
entertaining. Most of the songs fea
ture Aguilera, whose powerhouse
vocals lend the dance scenes tons of
energy and attitude.
Although Aguilera successfully
carries the musical numbers, her
attempts at acting are sub-par at best.
Her character swings between kind
hearted, ambitious and obnoxious
from scene to scene, a fact only
enhanced by Aguilera's awkward tim
ing.
Cher, on the other hand, is enjoy
able as an aging performer fighting to
retain ownership of the club. She
brings natural energy and snark to the
role, and is much more believable in
dramatic moments than Aguilera.
Meanwhile, an underused

Stanley Tucci slips comfortably back
into his "The Devil Wears Prada" role
as the bitchy gay assistant with a heart
of gold. His barbed one-liners aren't
as sharp as they were in "Prada," but
that's clearly the fault of writing, not
acting. Even with sub-par material,
Tucci is a breath of fresh air among
the rest of the overdramatic cast.
The original music in
"Burlesque" is quite catchy, even if
most of the songs are carried by
Aguilera's excellent, enthusiastic vocal
performance. She shines especially in
"Express," an upbeat track featured in
the middle of the film. However, the
original music is awkwardly juxta
posed with some generic pop hits and
classics like "Diamonds Are a Girl's
Best Friend" that make the sound
track seem unoriginal at times.
"Burlesque" doesn't shy away
from the obvious influence of many
other films, which often makes it seem
amateurish and cliche in comparison.
The film strives for the glitz and
drama of Rob Marshall's "Chicago,"
while falling short of "Chicago's" well
done satire of celebrity and scandal. It
also tries to recreate the fantasy of Baz
Luhrmann's "Moulin Rouge!" without
the rich story and setting that made
that film so great. It even fails to live
up to "Showgirls" in terms of its quali
ty as a "so-bad-it's-good" film. While
"Showgirls" reveled in off-the-wall
plots and terrible acting that made it a
cult classic, "Burlesque" awkwardly
straddles the line between serious
musical and campy escapist film, leav
ing viewers in a decent but far-from
classic no man's land.
