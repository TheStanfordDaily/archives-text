In April 2003,27-year-old out
doorsman Aron Ralston hiked
the sandstone trails of Blue John
Canyon, near Moab, Utah, only to
become trapped by a dislodged
boulder that crushed his right hand
and pinned him to an extremely nar
row canyon wall. Without a cell
phone and without a companion, he
quickly recognized that he was utter
ly on his own. He didn't even leave a
note to say where he'd be going.
Under the exuberant guidance
of Danny Boyle (the director respon
sible for "28 Days Later,"
"Trainspotting" and Oscar-winning
"Slumdog Millionaire"), what might
have been an arid docudrama based
on Ralston's bestselling memoir
"Between a Rock and a Hard Place,"
is instead "127 Hours" a gripping,
visually engaging piece of story
telling.
The film, as per Boyle's style, is
bright and frenetic. Scenes swelling
with people and noise are juxtaposed
with scenes of objects out of a still
life and wide, silent shots of the hori
zon. The screen is often split twice
and thrice to add emphasis and draw
connections between disparate
images. The difficulty of Aran's isola
tion, which elsewhere might have
hinged purely on the actor's talent, is
in part alleviated by the kinetic ener
gy driving Boyle and his cinematog
raphers, Enrique Chediak and
Anthony Dod Mantle. The two cine
matographers, it appears, went wild
in the beauty of Utah's sprawling
natural landscape. The confines of
the space do not stifle the story but
rather allow the production team the
opportunity to think creatively
inside the box. They succeed magnif
icently, for they fashion an incredibly
compelling illusion of movement in
spite of the static location.
To be sure, the performance

that James Franco delivers as Aron
Ralston would have been enough to
carry the film had nothing else been
up to par. His staggering range of
emotions exceeds the challenge
posed by"l 27 Hours," which in
many ways is a one-man show. He
moves from affable to solemn,
despairing to stunned, with dexterity
and nuance. Each moment is execut
ed with absolute precision and it's
not only the extremes that Franco
captures, but the subtle middle
ground. Franco knows what drives
Ralston, when he's rational and
when he's lost it and when he's navi
gating the dim route in between.
The story, adapted for the
screen by Boyle and Simon Beaufoy,
also works to enliven the otherwise
static setting and lone character. We
see Ralston's memories, his regrets,
his hallucinations and his premoni
tions, wherein the other people in his
life offer distinct perspectives on who
Ralston is: the brother of a young
woman who is to be married, a guy
who is, perhaps, doomed to loneli
ness, and the future father of a little
boy. We also see Ralston interacting
with himself through a video cam
era. He begins by addressing the
unfortunate person who finds the
camera and Ralston's remains, but
transitions to apologizing to his par
ents and, finally, coming to the stark
realization with a somber "oops"
that he is the only one to blame
in this situation.
Until that moment when the
boulder falls on Aran's arm, the story
plays out like a horror movie.
Ralston, joined quickly by two pretty
hikers, talks about how the earth is
always moving. Boyle draws our
attention to his hands as they glide
along the great surfaces of boulders
and canyon passes. We watch in fear,
waiting for the painful moment we

know is coming, but unsure of when
it will strike. The tension is visceral.
While Boyle's active style of
filmmaking and Franco's keen intel
ligence and comical energy, along
with A. R. Rahman's ("Slumdog
Millionaire") triumphant score, go
to great lengths to craft each brilliant
moment of "127 Hours," a little
more is to be desired. Ralston's folly
of selfishness is overlooked, and the
gravity of his plight, while played out
on a sensual level, does not soar to
existential heights. In this way, "127
Hours" falls somewhat short of "Into
the Wild," in which the protagonist
Christopher McCandless plunges to
greater, more profound depths that
affect the audience's hearts rather
than their nervous systems.
This complaint is, however,
slight. Ralston's story is different
from McCandless', for Ralston him
self maintains a certain sanity, a
shocking streak of practicality, which
sets him apart. The fact that Ralston
has the presence of mind to break
both his radius and his ulna, and
then sever his soft tissues and ten
dons with a dull knife, changes the
scope of the story. Boyle isn't inter
ested in a romantic search for self
that basks in awe of the numinous,
but a hard and fast tale of survival
and lust for 1ife."127 Hours" is a grit
ty film that thrives on the tensions
set by man vs. self and man vs.
nature.
By throwing these conflicts
together, Boyle depicts a social image
of man, who, as it turns out, is
unable to face the natural world
alone. He also shows, with manic
bravura, to what great lengths a
human being will go to live.
