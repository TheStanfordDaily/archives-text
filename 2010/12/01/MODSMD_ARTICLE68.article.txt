These days, Kanye West is clearly not the
hero that everyone wants to cheer on.
After a slew of politically incorrect state
ments and actions over the past few years, West
promptly retreated out of the spotlight when
the public turned against him, instead redirect
ing his focus and reevaluating his career.
The result of this self-imposed isolation is
an absolutely genius fifth album that even
West's strongest opponents cannot deny is
exceptional. Yes, West knows and acknowledges
that he is a "jerk-off," but "My Beautiful Dark
Twisted Fantasy" proves that he's a jerk-off that
produces fantastic music.
"Fantasy" delivers exactly what its name
insinuates a haunting album that delves
right into the heart of Kanye West's thoughts.
And at a time where much of the world is root
ing against him, West wisely decided to produce
a work that skips the superficial themes that
many of his peers construct entire albums
around. Instead, West is eager to push every
boundary, spill every secret and tell listeners
about every last part of his convoluted mind so
they can finally get his side of the story.
In just over an hour, "Fantasy" includes
tracks that touch on topics as diverse as racism
("Gorgeous"), women ("Hell of a Life"), uncer
tainty ("Lost In The World") and his favorite
subject: how good of an artist he is (just about
every song). Never fear, West is still West he
actually goes as far as to call himself a "super
hero [who needs] his theme music" —but part
of his success in "Fantasy" comes with his
determination to jump right into controversial
issues that many artists wouldn't come within
20 feet of.
For instance, one of the most powerful
tracks is the closing one, "Who Will Survive in
America," which is not so much a song as it is a
sermon about the two-sided nature of America.
West calls the country inhospitable to the com
mon man, urging," Build a new route to China
if they'll have you/Who will survive in America?'

West's boldness to speak his mind whether
anyone agrees with it or not is one of the
many elements that make him stand out from
the crowd.
Another of these elements is West's appre
ciation of art, and this manifests itself in
"Fantasy" as a synthesis of myriad musical gen
res. Although some of his past work, particular
ly his 2008 album "808s & Heartbreak," dabbled
in modern styles like synth, "Fantasy" takes a
broad approach, flawlessly unifying dichoto
mous techniques such as choirs, '9os grooves,
African drums and orchestra-driven beats. This
synthesis also extends itself to featured artists,
as well. For example, the fifth track, "All of the
Lights," somehow manages to successfully
incorporate Rihanna, Alicia Keys, Elton John,
Kid Cudi and Fergie, while still delivering pow
erful lyrics.
And as far as lyrics are concerned, West is
arguably the best in the industry. Forgoing the
designer name-dropping that many hip-hop
artists create meaningless songs out of, West is a
master at telling stories within a four-minute
period. For instance, the slow, piano-heavy
track "Blame Game," featuring John Legend,
tells the tale of a failed relationship between an
aloof star and a woman who couldn't handle
the spotlight. West laments, "We've become pub
lic enemies/We walk away like strangers in the
street gone for eternity"
With multiple strengths helping it along,
"My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy" is an
album that will have West rightfully anticipat
ing that elusive "Album of the Year" Grammy
Award that he so desperately wants. As far as
listeners are concerned, there should only be
one conclusion to logically come to: Buy this
album. Seriously.
