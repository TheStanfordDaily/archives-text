"Body Talk" is a slowly but surely con
cocted work that celebrates the drama of
being a girl. Robyn's third release and the
culmination of her efforts for 2010, it draws
five tracks each from the earlier "Body Talk
Pt. 1" and "Body Talk Pt. 2," adding five new
stellar songs to the mix. Covering the
heartache and despair of unrequited love,
the spunk of female empowerment and the
playfulness of being a girl, it all adds up to a
wonderfully energizing dance floor LP.
Bring on the pop.
Arguably Robyn's biggest hit of the
year, "Dancing On My Own" starts the
album off. Originally off "Body Talk Pt. 1,"
the single finds her at her strongest vocally
while exposing her emotional vulnerability.
While the spirited vocals ring out loud
above the upbeat synth and bass lines, the
lyrics tell another story. As the reject in the
club, she sings of herself dancing: "I'm giv
ing it my all, but I'm not the girl you're taking
home" Never has a pop dance anthem felt as
personal or heartbreaking before. Expect
smeared mascara on the dance floor.
Not to worry, though. "Don't Fucking
Tell Me What To Do" kicks in a couple of
songs later to show who's boss. A playful,
repetitive electro-house tirade, the track
starts off listing all of the annoyances that
are killing her, starting off with her drinking
and including her PMS (female empower
ment, anyone?). "Kickdrum," she demands
halfway through the song, and the drum
pad jumps for her. An awesome track that
has you nodding the whole way through,
reminiscent of Daft Punk's "Technologic," it
culminates with the title rant, presumably
meant for her man.
"Indestructible," the first of the new
tracks, brings in the hope and optimism of
new love to gloss over the earlier letdowns
conveyed in the album. With a string instru
ment arrangement mixed in over the synth

lines, the track feels softer and less edgy
than the earlier electro on the record. "7
never was smart with love/I let the bad ones
in and the good ones go/But I'm gonna love
you like I've never been hurt before ," she sings
throughout the chorus, although the energy
of the line is somewhat sabotaged after
being followed by one of the least ingenious
lines in the album: " This is hardcore."
Another new track, "Call Your
Girlfriend" is one of the high points off the
album. As Robyn sings to her lover to leave
his girlfriend to be with her instead, one can
see countless stories and lost hopes of "the
other woman" come shining through. What
seems like a straightforward pop song with
a strong groove and synthesized vocals is
actually an incredibly elaborate emotional
development, which is at times desperate, at
times seductive and coy, but mostly sad in
its familiarity.
As the album comes to a close with the
upbeat and slightly childish "Stars 4-Ever," it
becomes clear that this is the album that
Robyn had wanted to release all throughout
the year, but had not been able to conclude.
The tracks are now in the order intended,
with enough electro and even a bit of dub
step interspersed throughout the album to
keep her dance pop anthems from becom
ing too sweet, and her collaborations with
Snoop Dogg ("U Should Know Better") and
Royksopp ("None of Dem") are masterful.
And although mass commercial success has
shirked Robyn this year, the intimacy in her
songs promises to captivate more than one.
Girls, put on your heels: it's time to dance to
Robyn.
