Kesha's second album, "Cannibal," revives
the middle-finger-raising, boyfriend
trashing, glitter-loving frenzy of her debut.
For her haters, this is a second serving of base
humor and overproduced Auto-Tune. For her
fans, the album is another mindless escape into
the nightlife. Consider that it might be so bad that
it's good.
The eight-song mini-LP opens with the fast
paced "Cannibal." Against thumps fit for the jun
gle, Kesha shouts "Rawr" and raps about devour
ing hot boys. The chorus hooks you in when she
slows down to declare, "7 am a cannibal ' with
synth-pop keyboarding in the background.
The new single off the album, "We R Who
We R" is more synth beats and electro-pop. This is

a cry for individuality and being "forever young."
The mantras about youthful indiscretion make for
a can't-get-it-out-of-your-head thrill. She asks you
to make light of the night and join the lawlessness.
"Sleazy" continues the don't-care, don't-need
you theme. A fierce rhythm built by snare and
bass drums energizes the song. Her voice is nasally
and almost whiny, but somehow it works. As
always, there's the catchy chorus sung to offset the
rapping. At points she seems to scat, "Rat tat tat
tat on your dumdum dum." Subtly inserted sexual
innuendos (" ... gonna make me come... um,
over to your place. l ") are ridiculously adequate for
this generation's laugh-out-loud moments.
The star of the release is the tune "Blow,"

about an intense party. Only the
place she imagines would have both
"dirt and glitter cover the dance floor"
There's a steady dance beat with a
good balance of rap and singsong. A
healthy dose of Auto-Tune softens
the jagged edges of Kesha's voice.
A gende melody with near-poet
ic lyrics suddenly appears in the track
list. "The Harold Song" is a welcome
surprise, recounting adventures with
a lost love. It's an insight into Kesha's
insecurity and regrets, the closest to
intellectual gratification one can ask
from her work. Slow, soft drums set a
marching pace to her wish for mov
ing on. Anyone can relate to her need
to not be alone in the dark. Far-away
sounds of "oh" are comforting
mourns, strangely. Although this
song might be better fit for Kate
Nash or Ingrid Michaelson, even
Lady Gaga has her slow pieces.
"Crazy Beautiful Life" returns us

to the forget-it-all, find-meaning-in
dancing messages of before. She sings
in tune with the synthesizer, defend
ing the night-owl life. The loud
pounding makes a simple but seduc
tive rhythm and then slows to echo
ing keyboard notes.
Kesha has something against
overly sensitive boys. "Grow a Pear" is
a whine-fest about... whining. It
definitely isn't a favorite from the
album. She wants a guy who "acts
like a chick" to "grow a vag," and she
ends up at a new level of crudeness.
The lyrics aren't that intriguing, with
just enough thought for a corrupt
nursery rhyme. The bass is turned up
for the pulsating rhythm of this song.
The tide "C U Next Tuesday" is a
nod to texting culture. Another bass
beat joins whimsical synth keyboard
ing for an even harmony throughout.
She sings in a playful, childlike way,
inducing a lovely drowsiness. I would

call the sound "good, clean fun" like
The Beach Boys if it weren't desirous
of adulterous one-night stands.
The ending track is a remix of
"Animal" from Kesha's release. This
is best described as dream elec
tropop, somewhere in between Owl
City and Imogen Heap. The
Billboard remix is appropriate for her
idealistic pipe dreams mentioned.
She wants to go "into the magic" and
take us with her.
Don't expect Kesha the philoso
pher. She delivers on her image: party
anthems for losing yourself on the
dance floor. At the very least, this is a
guilty pleasure for you to sink your
teeth into.
