Kesha's second album, "Cannibal," revives
the middle-finger-raising, boyfriend
trashing, glitter-loving frenzy of her debut.
For her haters, this is a second serving of base
humor and overproduced Auto-Tune. For her
fans, the album is another mindless escape into
the nightlife. Consider that it might be so bad that
it's good.
The eight-song mini-LP opens with the fast
paced "Cannibal." Against thumps fit for the jun
gle, Kesha shouts "Rawr" and raps about devour
ing hot boys. The chorus hooks you in when she
slows down to declare, "7 am a cannibal ' with
synth-pop keyboarding in the background.
The new single off the album, "We R Who
We R" is more synth beats and electro-pop. This is

a cry for individuality and being "forever young."
The mantras about youthful indiscretion make for
a can't-get-it-out-of-your-head thrill. She asks you
to make light of the night and join the lawlessness.
"Sleazy" continues the don't-care, don't-need
you theme. A fierce rhythm built by snare and
bass drums energizes the song. Her voice is nasally
and almost whiny, but somehow it works. As
always, there's the catchy chorus sung to offset the
rapping. At points she seems to scat, "Rat tat tat
tat on your dumdum dum." Subtly inserted sexual
innuendos (" ... gonna make me come... um,
over to your place. l ") are ridiculously adequate for
this generation's laugh-out-loud moments.
The star of the release is the tune "Blow,"
