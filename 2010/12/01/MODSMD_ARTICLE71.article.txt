## Keith Richards' 'Life' is raw, poetic, charged 
### â€“ mayukh SEN contact mayukh: mayukh@stanford. edu 
Perhaps it's no surprise that a
musician's autobiography
would be filled with the same
sort of lyricism that defined his
career. Keith Richards' "Life," the
star's long-awaited tell-all, sounds a
bit like the music he creates
direct, rapturous and a little
bruised. He gives every fiber of his
being to us and presents it as the
truth, demanding that we accept it.
Richards, aided in his writing
by journalist James Fox, crafts his
words into a looking glass. We walk
through his life, his past, exactly as
he remembers it. It's an autobiogra
phy that's curiously devoid of any
new-age drivel or explicit self
reflection, instead filled with a
recreation of an earlier time that's
surprisingly vivid. Creating an
invariable sense of time and place,
we suddenly become part of the
cultural Zeitgeist that defined that
era. Slowly, we realize how absorb
ing that kind of world is, how easily
one can be swept up in it.
Richards' writing illuminates
the obvious that even rock stars,
in all their deified glory, come from
somewhere. His recollections of
childhood reveal exactly why some
one from his upbringing just had to

play music. He, too, writes fondly of
the men and women who inspired
him and there were many.
"He was one of those Texan
guys who could sail through any
thing, including his whole tragic
life," Richards reminisced about Roy
Orbison. "We watch the opening
number. And out walks this totally
transformed thing that seems to
have grown at least a foot with
presence and command over the
crowd."
A life like Richards' can easily
become monochromatic when
retold. There are times, just rarely,
when his experiences take on a sort
of blurred cyclicality, beginning to
blend together. But this is a minor
quibble. For the most part, Richards
reveals his experience with such
passion, such urgency, that his rock
star life which can easily be
reduced to vignettes of coke binges
and road shows becomes tangi
ble, and the public figure suddenly
takes on human form. He slips
between tones with surprising flu
idity and ease. At times sarcastic, at
others sincere, he communicates
how his life's been filled with
assuming so many faces, so many
different identities: the oft-wor-

shipped rock messiah, the confi
dant, the loner.
Like Richards' guitar playing,
his prose seems saturated with
melancholy. For one, he's as humble
and honest about his own personal
flaws as he is about those of others,
most infamously Mick Jagger. His
recollections of the women he loved
are as achingly damp as they are
electric. To Richards, love became a
necessity, unbounded by typical
notions of time and space.
"A lot of times I've ended up in
bed with a woman and never done
anything, just cuddled and slept,"
he recalled. "And I've loved loads of
them. I've always been so impressed
that they actually loved me in
return."
Keith Richards is a legend.
Fittingly, he has crafted his narra
tive into exquisite, immaculate
form. We cannot touch him. But
"Life" has so much feeling, so much
nakedness, that he creates the illu
sion that we can touch this god, this
paragon of musical brilliance, and
share a part of his experience.
