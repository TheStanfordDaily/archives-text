Mike "The Situation" Sorrentino's
recently published book, "Here's the
Situation," is exactly what you would
expect it to be. The "Jersey Shore" star's pen
chant for self-promotion is on full display in his
guide to life, love and, of course, the art of GTL.
Reading "Here's the Situation" is something
like watching a train wreck. The book takes
trashiness, sexism and superficiality to appalling
new levels. When he's not gloating about his
sexual conquests or glorifying his self-described
"astonishing physique," particularly his abs, The
Situation simply revels in his own fame.
The advice that The Situation presents in
his book covers nearly all aspects of life, from
education to sex, or "smooshing." According to
The Situation, weekly workout regimens are to
be strictly followed, except on Thursdays. Axe is
the only acceptable scent for men. If you're
stranded in the New Jersey Pine Barrens on your
way to Seaside Heights and need to wash cloth
ing by hand, just use your abs as a washboard.
You should know how to recognize various
types of "grenades," usually unattractive women
who destroy chances of hooking up with their
more attractive friends. He even shares his opin
ions on food: the ideal lasagna is nine layers of
cheese, sauce, noodles and beef.

Also scattered throughout the book are
"Sitch Ab Facts," in which The Situation credits
his abs with various medical, theatrical and
crime-fighting skills. To further illustrate his

celebrity status, The Situation offers up personal
stories from his own life, spending several pages
describing his first "fame bang" and his difficulty
choosing among 14 or more willing sexual part
ners at once.
It's not a surprise that "Here's the Situation"
reads very quickly. The book is written in "Jersey
Shore" lingo, and The Situation addresses his
reader as "bro" or "dawg." Furthermore, a signif-

icant portion of the book's 133 pages consists of
pictures rather than words. Sometimes they clar
ify The Situation's advice: he offers a useful step
by-step guide to "beating up the beat" as well as
suggestions about how to hold different alco
holic beverage containers in order to best show
off muscles. Other illustrations, such as the out
rageously sexist peek into the brain of a
"grenade," stand alone, without explanatory text.

The most terrifyingly fascinating picture is,
without a doubt, The Situation's handy pictorial
guide to revealing abs on such occasions as talk
show appearances, meetings with religious lead
ers and funerals.
Amazingly, though, this book has a saving
grace. It is obviously ghostwritten whoever
wrote it is simply too intelligent to be The
Situation himself, as it seems highly unlikely that
he is actually familiar with the Mohs scale of
mineral hardness and the ghostwriter's tone
is so sarcastic that he or she seems to be poking
fun at The Situation throughout the book.
Whether juxtaposing his insistence that women
should not be compared to meat with a drawn
out comparison of women to different kinds of
steak, or simply noting that "the entire contents
of [The Situation's] brain" can be found in this
guide, the ghostwriter employs the very superfi
ciality that made The Situation famous against
him without seeming excessively cruel.
These underlying currents of sarcasm and
irony transform "Here's the Situation" into a
self-aware mockery of the whole "Jersey Shore"
phenomenon. It's widely recognized that The
Situation himself is basically a walking monu
ment to narcissism; thankfully, this book recog
nizes it, too.

Scattered throughout
the book are 'Sitch Ab
Facts/ in which The
Situation credits his
abs with various med
ical, theatrical and
crime-fighting skills.
