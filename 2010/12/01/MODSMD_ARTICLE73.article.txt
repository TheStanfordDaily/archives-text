## FALL 2010 TV Looking back on what we watched 
### â€“ liz STARK contact liz: estark12@stanford. edu 
Maybe it's me, maybe it's the lure of
Stanford football, but this fall's tele
vision offerings have failed to
impress. More charitably, the new shows of
this year took risks, good and bad, that they
ultimately couldn't sustain or couldn't sell to a
literalist American audience. It's like a first
date: you idealize it, are charitable in your ini
tial post-game analysis, but are ready to jump
ship three minutes into date number two. An
analysis of what's hot and not will determine
both my winter break television consumption
and the trends for next year's new content.
Perhaps the most contentious topic of dis
cussion has been how to judge whether last
year's pet programs have improved or

regressed. I know that, when it comes to
"Glee," I'm like a broken record produced by
Ryan Murphy, but I sincerely believe that the
show has finally revealed its incomplete skele
ton. Addictively flashy narrative distractions
such as Darren Criss singing "Teenage Dream,"
Gwyneth Paltrow pushing "Forget You"
through her nasal cavity and the cast watering
down "Rocky Horror" have jacked up ratings
at the potential expense of alienating the core
fan base and digging the show an even deeper
hole of logical impossibility.
Even columnist's pet "Community" has
yet to stake out major goals for the season,
instead taking parody to new heights in "Basic
Rocket Science" and "Epidemiology." The
often-forgotten "Cougar Town" has embraced
the stigma of its name with admirable sarcasm
and continues to nail its portrayal of mid-40s
life (in fact, I find the college-age plotlines for
Travis the least enjoyable). And then there's
"Modern Family," which in my opinion has
been plodding along from week to week and
giving every character equal time. The com
mon thread seems to be that these ensemble
comedies have shifted from group dynamics to
the lives of the individuals, a subtle change that
reads to me as a cop-out.
Just as the arrival of these shows last year
"redefined" the genre of the family sitcom, this
fall has ushered in a new era of buddy detec
tive shows. On FX, "Terriers" has thrived, deftly
combining elements of mystery and drama
with the natural humor of its charismatic male
leads. Another under-the-radar Fox show, "The
Good Guys," features Bradley Whitford of
"The West Wing" and Colin Hanks of "Tom"
as Dallas detectives disparate in age and world
view. "The Defenders" from CBS brings Jim

Belushi and Jerry O'Connell together in the
sudsy world of Las Vegas law, and with names
like that, this "comedy-drama" errs more on
the side of the former.
Notably, these are male-dominated com
binations. TNT's "Rizzoli & Isles" has been
renewed for a second season on the strength of
its female leads, one a detective and the other a
medical examiner; however, ABC cancelled
"The Whole Truth" when the pairing of a male
prosecutor and a female defense attorney did
n't click with audiences (see also the stilted
comedy of Arnett and Russell on "Running
Wilde," the early end to "My Boys" for failed
experiments in mixed gender). The inherent
levity of male bonding has endeared itself to
the most lucrative demographics.
Shows such as these have proven to be the
safe bets they were surely developed as, but a
juxtaposition of paid and basic cable program
ming highlights the benefits of informed risk
taking. This fall, HBO and Showtime rolled
out new projects such as "Boardwalk Empire"
and "The Big C" while hyping stalwarts such as
"Weeds," "Dexter," "Eastbound and Down" and
"Bored to Death." The returners have not
inspired much enthusiasm in their consider
able fan bases, and I just couldn't get into life
on the "Boardwalk." The period-piece nature
was almost too immersive, too cinematic for
me to return after the first few episodes. "The
Big C" initially bored me with upper-middle
class white problems, but has proven adventur
ous.
Nevertheless, the innovations of the fall,
and very likely the future of television, are
available on basic cable. The Shakespearean
biker-gang saga of "Sons of Anarchy," the inge
nuity of "The Walking Dead" and the incom

parable humanity of "Mad Men" make the case
that paid cable budgets are not necessary or
sufficient conditions for art.
Finally, the admittedly oft-neglected genre
in this column, reality television, cried out for
attention this fall. "Dancing with the Stars"
unexpectedly, though perhaps not uninten
tionally, thrust itself into the political arena as
the war of talent versus notoriety between
Jennifer Grey and Bristol Palin came to a head.
There's nothing like an inquiry into the ethics
of reality television production to remind us of
human fallibility.
Similarly, "Jersey Shore" continued to take
the world by storm, dominating Thursday
nights and cementing MTV's cultural rele
vance. I personally have been caught in the
spell of Tyra Banks, as I have followed the 15th
cycle of "America's Next Top Model" to Italy,
where either Chelsea or Ann will further wors
en America's reputation abroad when one of
them undeservingly graces the pages of Vogue
Italia. The self-congratulatory attitude of the
judges regarding this prize has certainly
attracted attention, though perhaps not in the
way Tyra had hoped.
Love ABC Family's "25 Days of
Christmas" ode to clay animation as I do, I
look forward to catching up on sleep, vegeta
bles and television this winter break as part of
a healthy diet. I will do my best also to expand
my repertoire to continue to bring you a
simultaneously negative but adoring perspec
tive on America's greatest pastime, couch
sports. Happy holidays, everyone!
