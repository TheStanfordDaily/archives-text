## Alpha Phi selected as new campus sorority, will recruit in spring 
### CAROLINE CHEN STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford Inter-sorority Council
(ISC) voted Tuesday night to introduce a
new chapter, Alpha Phi, to campus, increas
ing the number of Panhellenic Sororities to
seven.
Alpha Phi was selected in a 4-2 vote over
Delta Gamma by each of the six current
Panhellenic sororities on campus. The ISC
noted in its recommendation of Alpha Phi
that it was a chapter with "an in-depth un
derstanding and appreciation of the unique
Greek community on the Stanford campus,
as well as willingness and excitement to as
similate to the environment already estab

lished here."
The decision to add a new sorority was a
response to increased interest during rush.
Currently, about 16 percent of undergradu
ates join a fraternity or sorority, according to
the Stanford Common Data. Among sorori
ty members, about 87 percent are affiliated
with one of the six current Panhellenic
sororities: Alpha Epsilon Phi, Chi Omega,
Delta Delta Delta, Kappa Alpha Theta,
Kappa Kappa Gamma and Pi Beta Phi.
"More and more girls have decided to
rush in recent years, which has meant bigger
pledge classes and more girls who don't get
bids at all," said Anna Martinelli 'll, outgo
ing president of Chi Omega. "Stanford does
n't like the idea of girls not getting into

sororities, and a new sorority means smaller
pledge classes and fewer girls disappointed
at the end of the year."
"It's a particularly big issue for housed
sororities," said Brittany Wheelock 'll, pres
ident of ISC. "There isn't enough room, so
seniors can't live there, though they should
be able to."
The decision to extend the Panhellenic
sororities on campus was made last spring,
according to Amanda Rodriguez, Greek
program advisor for Residential Education.
The announcement was made public to all
National Panhellenic Conference organiza
tions in May, and Stanford received 12 appli
cations from interested sororities.
ISC sought to add a sorority that had val

ues in line with the Greek community on
campus.
"Stanford has a very unique Greek com
munity, which is more similar to areas in the
North and places like Brown or Columbia,
as opposed to the South," Wheelock said.
"Stanford is more focused on academics and
sports, and Greek life comes second."
Martinelli echoed Wheelock, saying they
were looking for a sorority that emphasized
having well-rounded students and didn't ask
its members to "sell their souls to the organ
ization."
In addition, the sorority would have to be
willing to be un-housed. Currently, three of
the six Panhellenic sororities are housed,
and a new chapter would not immediately

get housing.
With these criteria in mind, the sororities
narrowed the applicants to two options,
Delta Gamma and Alpha Phi.
While the majority of the Panhellenic
sororities were excited by the prospect of
lowering pledge class numbers, there were
concerns that bringing a new sorority on
campus might hurt the growth of Alpha Ep
silon Phi. AEPhi is a relatively new chapter
on campus, founded in 2007, and currently
has 37 members.
However, AEPhi supported the decision
to start the extension process. Lisa Abdilova
'll, president of AEPhi, emphasized that the
chapter was not overly concerned
with numbers.

"A new ISC chapter promotes
Greek life, and AEPhi is in full sup
port of that," she said via e-mail.
Rodriguez also stressed that the
ISC worked closely with AEPhi to
ensure their concerns would be ad
dressed.
"There have been on-going con
versations with Alpha Epsilon Phi
leadership before we explored exten
sion and throughout the extension

process," said Rodriguez via e-mail.
She also stressed that Alpha Phi,
as a new sorority with its own char
acter, would potentially attract stu
dents who may not have originally
have been interested in joining a
sorority, and thus would not detract
from the number of students seek
ing to joining AEPhi.
The Alpha Phi national head
quarters will be notified today of the
ISC's decision. If it accepts the offer,
Alpha Phi will send representatives
from other chapters in the area to
help with recruitment during spring
rush.
