## BOSP considers future expansion 
### ELLORA ISRANI CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
As the Bing Overseas Studies
Program (BOSP) continues to re
cover from the economic downturn
that severely slashed its resources
and forced significant cutbacks
over the last several years. Univer
sity officials are beginning to look
toward the possibility of new cen
ters, seminars and requirements
that will define the program's fu
ture.
A first step on this path was the
appointment of Robert Sinclair,
professor of materials science and
engineering, who became the direc
tor of BOSP this quarter.
"The way things work at Stan
ford is that if there are new initia
tives or new ideas, then it works best
if the consensus is built up from all
the possible constituencies," Sin
clair said. "We're currently going
through that process right now."
Sinclair said he has given pre
sentations to the BOSP advisory
council, department office, execu
tive council and Vice Provost for
Undergraduate Education Harry
Elam. Because of the large number
of groups that must be consulted, it
will take significant time and effort
before students see major changes
to the program, including any new
centers, he said.
BOSP is returning to pre-eco
nomic downturn levels, according
to the director. Speaking of return
ing to a "sustainable" level, Sinclair
said the monetary commitment for
a new center would be far from
trivial, with the final numbers de
pending heavily on whether the
center is endowed by a major gift,
as well as the cost of physical setup
and support.The approximate cost
of a three-quarter center is $1.5
million a year.

"You can gauge from that what
the startup would be and what the
long-term commitment would be,"
he said. "The one-quarter pro

gram, which is often more viable in
the beginning, is less, but it's not
proportionately less."
In the meantime, the program is
instead focusing on re-instating
the Overseas Seminar Program
cut a year ago because of budget
constraints. Currently, the plan is
to reintroduce the program in 2012
at half its level before the econom
ic downturn and fully the follow
ing year. Seminars are much more
logistically and financially feasible
for the still-recovering program,
Sinclair said.

"Trial seminars" would occur in
"key places," including locations
where BOSP hopes to open up full
blown centers in the future, he said.
Expectations for expansion will
play a significant role in determin
ing the course of the seminars.
"The procedure in the past has
been to open it up to faculty pro
posals, and we'll do that to some ex
tent, but there will be some targeted
locations which faculty and staff
will think about to try some of the
new locations we might consider in
the long term," he said.
Sinclair called program officials'
top choices, which include India
and the Middle East, "almost self
evident."

"There are so many choices,"
Sinclair added. "Personally, the
School of Engineering has had
good associations with Bangalore .
.. it would help promote at the
same time the involvement of tech
nical and engineering students.
There wouldn't be a language re
quirement so there are lots of ad
vantages there. If you look at fi
nance you've got to think about
Mumbai, if you think culture
there's Delhi and Calcutta, but
we're taking into consideration the
difficult situation that technology
students have, so Bangalore in the
end is close to the top of the list."
In his enthusiasm for a center in
Bangalore, Sinclair also dispelled a
common student speculation: that
technical and engineering majors
cannot go abroad because of their re
quirement-heavy curricula.
"The situation is not dire," he said.
"It's not as bad as we sometimes
think, but there are a fraction of engi
neering students who aren't able to fit
it into their schedules as easily as
other majors and so we want to pro
mote engineering and technical stu
dents to go abroad."
An obstacle the program faces is
globalizing the program without de
tracting from the centers already op
erating. Sixty-six percent of Stanford
students who go abroad through
BOSP go to Western Europe, but Sin
clair said that he would like to change
the trend.

"I personally would like to see a
more balanced program and more
globalization, and I think the Uni
versity would also," he said. "That
having been said, the centers are all
superb and serve a great purpose, so
we wouldn't want to have an impact

on what they're doing because they
are really to the benefit of a lot of our
students."
Despite these difficulties, BOSP
continues to flourish in various
other ways. Applications to other
centers remain extremely competi
tive, especially at Oxford and
Kyoto, the latter of which enjoys a
two-to-one application-to-spot
ratio.
Sinclair said the fiscal con
straints under which BOSP oper

ates will continue to be the main de
terminants of its future direction.

"There are some changes that are
possible, but we do have to remem
ber that these are still really con
stricting financial times so I would
say that any changes that are going to
happen are going to be gradual,
maybe not even in my time as direc
tor," Sinclair said.
