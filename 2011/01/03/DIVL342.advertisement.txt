ASNAMST 189. The Vietnamese Experience in America
Usually, courses on the Vietnam War, have often concentrated on the American perspective, and therefore
have often overlooked the experience of the Vietnamese people. After the Fall of Saigon in April 1975 there has
been and continues to be, a large influx of Vietnamese refugees into the United States. As a result, the
experience of the Vietnamese refugees provide an excellent vantage point from which to view the dynamics of
the larger social, political, and economic relations of American society.

NATIVEAM 120/ CSRE 120. Native American Writers, 1880-1920
The period of time-1880 to 1920-is a time when many important events in American Indian history occurred, Hoxie's historical work
provides a framework for analyzing what effects these policies had on American Indian people. His work does not provide an American
Indian perspective; he stated at the onset, that this was not an objective in this study. His main objective was to present a study that
shows Indians' relations with whiles as a "dash of two complex cultures" from a white point of view (Hoxie xxi). Three American Indians
writing during this time period provide the needed Indian perspective lacking in Hoxie's work.
