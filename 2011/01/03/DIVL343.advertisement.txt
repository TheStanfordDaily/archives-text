The Bita Daryabari Endowment for Persian Literature
at Stanford University at the Iranian Studies Program is
proud to offer a course titled, "The Iranian Cinema: Image
and Meaning," through the Comp Lit Department. The
course will be taught by Mr. Bahram Beyzaie, Visiting
Lecturer for the Iranian Studies Program.
COURSE TITLE:
THE IRANIAN CINEMA: IMAGE AND MEANING
COURSE DESCRIPTION:
This course will focus on the analysis of ten Iranian films with the view of
conducting a discourse on the semiotics of Iranian art and culture. Each session
will be designated to the viewing of a film by a prominent Iranian film-maker.
Students are expected to prepare for class by having previously examined
other available films by the film-maker under consideration.
Special attention will be given to the two conventions of Iranian cinema, the
traditional-allegoric and the more modern-realistic styles. Discursive analysis
within the construct of an open forum will be conducted with special attention
to metaphoric and aesthetic aspects of the films, including the particular
styles of the chosen film-makers, their varied skills and insights. From such
considerations will issue discussions on the diversity of Iranian cinema, its styles
and structures, its prototypes and stereotypes, as well as discourse implicating
matters of directing and acting, cinematography and image iconography, and
the presence of transparent or over-coded signs and symbols. The topics
enumerated above will be examined in light of social and historical influences
and impacts.
