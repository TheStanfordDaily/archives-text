# STETHOSCOPES, COMPILERS AND HEMINGWAY
## Just Plane Humanity 
### Aaditya Shidham 
This column comes to you from
the sky. No, really: I write
these very words as I leave the
smelly factory air of Newark and
board a plane to come home to this
beloved campus. And the familiar
experience, 15,000 feet in the sky,
brings to mind my own evolving re
action to the idea of flight.
Many times, when I was little, I
had this frenzied need to jump from
the rooftops and fly. I had a dream
where I slowly grew wings on my
back, right behind my arms, and
took off just as the full moon rose. I
could see the New York skyline as
the wind swept my face. I felt myself
break not only the bonds of gravity,
but also the bonds of time as I saw
that the entire world had frozen
below me. I had swept down to just
inches above the asphalt of the
streets, and I could see a man sleep
ing in a bed, another in the process
of laughing at a joke, another, deep
in thought, brows furrowed with
concentration. I was brilliant
it was brilliant, for nothing but that
one second of time mattered any
more. I wanted to see that world
that way, so freely and effortlessly. I
wanted to freeze time so that I
could look into a man's eyes and be
able to discover his entire life
through that look.
Herman Hesse once wrote that a
man's personal story is sacred be
cause, in each one, a redeemer is
nailed to the cross. I think I can add
to this: I believe that a man's dreams
become crucified, over and over
again, as they come into contact
with the knowledge of the world.
But many pretend that the crucifix
ion did not occur. Many still retort
that "ignorance is bliss," many still
use humor or family or even life to
ignore understanding themselves.
This self-denial and dishonesty is
the essence of suicide and the

midlife crisis, isn't it?
My idea of flight underwent such
a crucifixion at some tender, single
digit age. I found that my idea of
noble, angelic wings more represent
ed a carpet ride in "Aladdin" than
the jumbo jet the huge metal tube
with arms that is so common to our
modern existence. It was no longer
flight to me it was now peanuts
and a movie and jet lag. I hated get
ting up at the crack of dawn, check
ing into that security desk, checking
into the other one, forgetting my life
for a day just to prepare for such a
flight. Many other childhood fan
tasies went away in much the same
way, when I realized how extraordi
nary things were made so tedious by
everyday events.
I think the scars from that cruci
fixion have healed. Now planes
seem to be a place of capitalism in
full strut ($6 pillows, anyone?): a
classist society (the lowly coach pas
sengers cannot even piss in the won
derful toilets of the first class) not
very happy with displays of selfless
altruism ("Put on your own oxygen
mask before assisting others"). In
fact, as I write this very sentence, I
am bombarded with ads above me
to swipe my credit card in the ap
propriate slot to get DirecTV and
Boingo WiFi and waste the two
hours I have left in this journey.
And the worst part is we buy into
all of it. Walk through any interna
tional flight and you will find people
10 inches from rectangular displays,
catching up on movies they could
care less about because there is
nothing else to do. I find this per
haps the most depressing of all.
Who are we as people in modern so
ciety if we cannot sit and simply be
for several precious hours? I am as
guilty of this as the rest of you
you have no idea how many movies
I watch on a plane that I would have

never picked out of a rental store or
seen with friends. Thoreau told us
that the greatest unexplored uni
verse is within ourselves, but we
have stopped listening. In this age of
constant stimulation, we find the sa
cred idle hours of a modern journey
unbearable.

And yet, beyond the tedium of
modern-day air travel and what it
exposes about modern humanity,
there remains something uniquely
wonderful about the whole thing.
As I write this, and as you read it, at
least a couple dozen child-sized
hearts will have skipped a beat be
cause of their first takeoff, their first
landing, their first scary dip of the
plane. Another couple wide sets of
eyes will marvel at the glimpse of
how everything they know and love
turns into an ant colony, and have a
bizarre and wonderful realization
of their world's fragility. And at
least one 8-year-old boy just fell in
love with his flight attendant.
There is a reason we fly planes
over football games and patriotic
rallies. There is a reason why the
streak that a jet engine makes
across the summer sky makes us
glance, if only for a second. No mat
ter how worldly the industry, no
matter how indulgent the people,
there is a nucleus of the holy and the
beautiful about flight in the human
imagination.
