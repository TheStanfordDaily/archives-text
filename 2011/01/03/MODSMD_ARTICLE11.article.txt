# CARDINAL SINS
## Hail Harbaugh 
### David Spencer Nelson 
In the last four years, Jim Har
baugh has brought the Cardinal
from 10th in the Pac-10 to fourth
in the nation. He has taken a 1-11
team to 11-1 and in the process, de
veloped two Heisman Trophy run
ner-ups. This year, he took the Stan
ford faithful to its first BCS bowl
since its defeat in the 2000 Rose
Bowl. The team that will take the
field today in Miami may well be
Stanford's best ever, as the San Jose
Mercury News claimed in an article
last Thursday. It is, after all, the first
Stanford team to win 11 games, and
that one loss came against a strong
Oregon team that will play for the
BCS national championship on Jan.
10.

Jim Harbaugh has worked a
miracle. Bringing us from the bot
tom of the Pac-10 to national televi
sion and BCS bowls, it's hard for us
freshmen to begin to imagine how
much of a football backwater Palo
Alto was, not five years ago. But
now, having broken the Trojans two
years running, Stanford outranks
its opponent, Virginia Tech, head
ing into one of the most prominent
and most-watched college football
games of the year. Harbaugh, a for
mer University of Michigan and
NFL quarterback, only got his first
head-coaching job in 2004 at the
University of San Diego. He turned
USD around much like he did Stan
ford. Harbaugh has not just benefit
ed from coincidence. He's made his
own luck. Puns are fun!
The Harbaugh effect reaches be

yond the field. He has given us a new
way to make fun of southern Cali
fornia. He's given Stanford a team
to rally around and be proud of. For
each year of Harbaugh's tenure,
Stanford has led the nation's univer
sities as the top collegiate fundraiser
in the world. Though at least in part
a coincidence, it would be foolish to
think that success on the field does
n't have broader meaning. When
Stanford's name is painted across
the sports section and its players
play and are interviewed on nation
al television, it does wonders for the
school's reputation, makes alumni
feel connected and lines the Univer
sity's pockets in these times of eco
nomic trouble.

Successful football also spreads a
sense of community and commonal
ity across a diverse and large cam
pus. Techies and fuzzies are both
made fans.
As much as we love the Luck
and Harbaugh combination, it
looks like we'll be saying goodbye
to them just after we said it to 2010.
It's widely rumored that Harbaugh,
like his brother, will move to the
