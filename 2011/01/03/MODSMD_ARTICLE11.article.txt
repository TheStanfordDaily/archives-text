# CARDINAL SINS
## Hail Harbaugh 
### David Spencer Nelson 
In the last four years, Jim Har
baugh has brought the Cardinal
from 10th in the Pac-10 to fourth
in the nation. He has taken a 1-11
team to 11-1 and in the process, de
veloped two Heisman Trophy run
ner-ups. This year, he took the Stan
ford faithful to its first BCS bowl
since its defeat in the 2000 Rose
Bowl. The team that will take the
field today in Miami may well be
Stanford's best ever, as the San Jose
Mercury News claimed in an article
last Thursday. It is, after all, the first
Stanford team to win 11 games, and
that one loss came against a strong
Oregon team that will play for the
BCS national championship on Jan.
10.

Jim Harbaugh has worked a
miracle. Bringing us from the bot
tom of the Pac-10 to national televi
sion and BCS bowls, it's hard for us
freshmen to begin to imagine how
much of a football backwater Palo
Alto was, not five years ago. But
now, having broken the Trojans two
years running, Stanford outranks
its opponent, Virginia Tech, head
ing into one of the most prominent
and most-watched college football
games of the year. Harbaugh, a for
mer University of Michigan and
NFL quarterback, only got his first
head-coaching job in 2004 at the
University of San Diego. He turned
USD around much like he did Stan
ford. Harbaugh has not just benefit
ed from coincidence. He's made his
own luck. Puns are fun!
The Harbaugh effect reaches be

yond the field. He has given us a new
way to make fun of southern Cali
fornia. He's given Stanford a team
to rally around and be proud of. For
each year of Harbaugh's tenure,
Stanford has led the nation's univer
sities as the top collegiate fundraiser
in the world. Though at least in part
a coincidence, it would be foolish to
think that success on the field does
n't have broader meaning. When
Stanford's name is painted across
the sports section and its players
play and are interviewed on nation
al television, it does wonders for the
school's reputation, makes alumni
feel connected and lines the Univer
sity's pockets in these times of eco
nomic trouble.

Successful football also spreads a
sense of community and commonal
ity across a diverse and large cam
pus. Techies and fuzzies are both
made fans.
As much as we love the Luck
and Harbaugh combination, it
looks like we'll be saying goodbye
to them just after we said it to 2010.
It's widely rumored that Harbaugh,
like his brother, will move to the

NFL and Andrew Luck, currently
projected as the No. 1 pick in the
NFL Draft, is also set to play pro
fessionally. Conjectures about a
Harbaugh-and-Luck partnership
with the Carolina Panthers have
abounded. There's much uncer
tainty ahead. For the first time
since Harbaugh arrived, Stanford
football could be without a mar
quee player. Toby Gerhart is gone
and Luck will be soon enough,
leaving the Cardinal in need of a
new superstar. The team's young
talent has shined throughout the
season, and the offensive and de
fensive lines, which should remain
relatively intact after year's end,
were dominant throughout the
season. Sophomore Stepfan Taylor
averaged nearly five yards per
carry and had 15 touchdowns over
the season. He will be a great asset
in the future.
Tonight, the Stanford Cardinal
will go up against a Virginia Tech
team with one more loss than Stan

ford, but the same 11 wins. They will
have to contain the fleet-of-foot
Tyrod Taylor, whose quickness is
eerily reminiscent of former Hokie
Michael Vick. The team hasn't lost a
game since Sept. 11, when it
dropped a game to a weak James
Madison side. Since then, they've
had 11 straight victories, though
none against a team ranked higher
than No. 22. Andrew Luck could be
playing his last game in Cardinal
colors and Harbaugh his last on a
college sideline.
This is an important game for
plenty of reasons. It's our first BCS
game for a long time, and, maybe,
the ending of an era for Stanford
football. Freshmen like myself,
however, need not lose hope. Stan
ford's football team is nothing if not
resilient, and our recruiting has
been incredibly strong. Whether or
not Harbaugh and Luck leave, the
future looks bright for the Cardinal.
We have great talent and all the re
sources a team could ask for.
Change is may be coming, but it
looks like we will weather the
storm.

pus. Techies and fuzzies are both
made fans.
As much as we love the Luck
and Harbaugh combination, it
looks like we'll be saying goodbye
to them just after we said it to 2010.
It's widely rumored that Harbaugh,
like his brother, will move to the

NFL and Andrew Luck, currently
projected as the No. 1 pick in the
NFL Draft, is also set to play pro
fessionally. Conjectures about a
Harbaugh-and-Luck partnership
with the Carolina Panthers have
abounded. There's much uncer
tainty ahead. For the first time
since Harbaugh arrived, Stanford
football could be without a mar
quee player. Toby Gerhart is gone
and Luck will be soon enough,
leaving the Cardinal in need of a
new superstar. The team's young
talent has shined throughout the
season, and the offensive and de
fensive lines, which should remain
relatively intact after year's end,
were dominant throughout the
season. Sophomore Stepfan Taylor
averaged nearly five yards per
carry and had 15 touchdowns over
the season. He will be a great asset
in the future.
Tonight, the Stanford Cardinal
will go up against a Virginia Tech
team with one more loss than Stan

ford, but the same 11 wins. They will
have to contain the fleet-of-foot
Tyrod Taylor, whose quickness is
eerily reminiscent of former Hokie
Michael Vick. The team hasn't lost a
game since Sept. 11, when it
dropped a game to a weak James
Madison side. Since then, they've
had 11 straight victories, though
none against a team ranked higher
than No. 22. Andrew Luck could be
playing his last game in Cardinal
colors and Harbaugh his last on a
college sideline.
This is an important game for
plenty of reasons. It's our first BCS
game for a long time, and, maybe,
the ending of an era for Stanford
football. Freshmen like myself,
however, need not lose hope. Stan
ford's football team is nothing if not
resilient, and our recruiting has
been incredibly strong. Whether or
not Harbaugh and Luck leave, the
future looks bright for the Cardinal.
We have great talent and all the re
sources a team could ask for.
Change is may be coming, but it
looks like we will weather the
storm.
