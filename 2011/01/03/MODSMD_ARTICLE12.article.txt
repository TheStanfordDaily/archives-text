# OP-ED
## The 						Prince of Peace is not the god of war 
### 
For those who follow the Christian tradition,
Christmas is a time of hope and promise in the un
likely person of a child. It is a time of celebrating
the birth of the one spoken of by the prophet Isaiah and
heralded by Handel as the "Prince of Peace." Yet reli
gion and war have become so grotesquely interconnect
ed that we can scarcely tell them apart. Indeed, to sug
gest that war is antithetical to the message of Jesus is to
risk accusations of treason, heresy or both.
Most people are unaware that for the first few hun
dred years of the Church, Christians were total pacifists.
A vein of this ancient ethic has persisted throughout
history. In the dominant culture, the reverse is true; re
ligion and war have become so enmeshed that some
areas of the military have become evangelistic recruit
ment centers

(http://www.militaryreligiousfreedom.org). Politicians
and ministers alike fawn over our military as if war and
religion were made for one another.
Steven Green, the soldier who raped a 14-year-old
Iraqi girl before murdering her and her family, says that
he "didn't think of the Iraqis as humans." While our
troops include many good people whose consciences
would be repelled by Green's deeds, the reality is that
we must dehumanize the enemy in order to go to war
and in order to kill. One military training cadence
shows the perverse nature of training for war: "Bomb
the village, kill the people/throw some napalm in the
square/do it on a Sunday morning/kill them on their
way to prayer."
The tragic reality is that we can't dehumanize the
enemy without dehumanizing ourselves. This is why
Chris Hedges, the Pulitzer Prize-winning war corre
spondent, calls war a form of "necrophilia" and "organ
ized sadism." The destructive nature of war, though
often cloaked in noble causes, is by definition the an
tithesis of life. In the words of Dr. King, "the ultimate
weakness of violence is that it is a descending spiral,
begetting the very thing it seeks to destroy. Instead of
diminishing evil, it multiplies it... darkness cannot
drive out darkness: only light can do that. Hate cannot
drive out hate: only love can do that."

It is time we recognize that President Eisenhower's
warning about the "military-industrial complex" has
become a reality. The U.S. not only has the largest mili
tary budget in the world, we have a larger military budg
et than all the rest of the world combined! Our military
budget has become so sacrosanct that we will cut aid to
schools and health care and the unemployed before we
ever consider reducing our military budget. Our socie
ty, economy and culture have become increasingly mil
itarized. And we can expect more of the same. But for
what?

We are sacrificing our humanity on this altar of mil
itarism, the altar of death. Our militarism is a danger to
the environment, our economy and the future of the
world. It creates more enemies than it destroys and
leaves death and destruction in its
wake. The only ones who profit
from this madness are the corpora
tions who benefit from the exten
sion of U.S. policies and those who
manufacture the armaments of
death. So we must ask, is it to big
business that we pledge our alle
giance?
Stanford is considering bring
ing ROTC back on campus. How
many students are aware that
Stanford has received more than
$lOO million in military contracts
over the last 10 years? What is the
affect of that money on the Uni
versity's commitment to its mis
sion and pedagogy? To paraphrase

Eisenhower, are we seeing the
deepening of the "military-univer
sity-industrial complex"? I hope
that Stanford will conclude that
ROTC doesn't belong on campus
because we need to be scaling back
the militarism of our universities,
not expanding it.
As the Christmas story suggests,
peace on earth and goodwill to all
will not be achieved through the
machinations of war. It is more like
ly to arrive in the unassuming form
of child amidst a clash of empires.
May we, as global citizens of the
world, be ever mindful that the
Prince of Peace is not the god of
war.
