# LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
## Promoting pluralism, understanding in Gaieties 
### 
Dear Editor,
I was surprised to see in the Dec. 1 Stanford Daily ar
ticle about Gaieties that I was cited by Producer Rachel
Lindee as having approved the script ("Ujamaa staff
and residents walk out of Gaieties, two groups schedule
talks," Dec. 1). I did nothing of the kind. In both an e
mail exchange with Rams Head Executive Producer
Michael Rooney and in a meeting in my office with him
and Ms. Lindee, I was asked for feedback on the materi
al, but not "to sign off on this." I was specifically told that
I was not to be put "in a situation in which you imply
some material is acceptable" in the Gaieties script. I ex
plained that the show had the potential to be extremely
offensive to many students on campus. I noted how the
kind of religious, ethnic and racial
humor in the script can be experi
enced as very disrespectful, hurtful
and divisive. I added that it's cer
tainly not what Stanford is trying to
promote in terms of pluralism as we
train global leaders for the 21st cen

tury. Mr. Rooney responded that
they were re-working the script,
genuinely seeking to proceed in
such away as "to promote pluralism
and intercultural understanding
within the confines of this tradition.
