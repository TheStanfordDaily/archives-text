# It's all about the forced turnovers
## 
### JACOB JAFFE DEPUTY EDITOR Jacob Jaffe Fields of Failure 
The third of January is here,
which means it's time for the Or
ange Bowl. Only a few hours re
main until the anticipation and
hoopla will finally give way to actu
al football, so your trash talking,
self-reassuring and worrying are on
their final legs. Need some stats to
boast to opposing fans, stump your
friends, calm your fears or find an
error in so-called expert analysis?
Here's a rundown of Stanford and
Virginia Tech by the numbers.
To start off, this truly is a duel
befitting a BCS game.The Cardinal
and Hokies come in with records of
11-1 and 11-2, respectively, and
have gone a combined 20-1 since
mid-September. Two of their three
defeats have come against top-10
teams away from home, with only
Virginia Tech's shocking slipup at
home against FCS James Madison
marring either team's reputation.
Past the records, though, both
teams prove themselves to be re
markably well-rounded. Stanford
and Virginia Tech rank among the
top 20 teams in both scoring of
fense and scoring defense, some
thing that no other bowl game can
offer. The Cardinal has a slight edge
in each category, ranking eighth in
offense and 11th in defense, while
the Hokies come in at 19th and
17th, respectively.
One major similarity between
the two teams is the ability to make
each yard count, both on offense
and on defense. This can be seen
when looking at yardage statistics
in relation to scoring statistics.
Each team ranks higher in points
scored than yards gained, which
speaks to the efficiency with which
drives are converted to points. Sim
ilarly, each team has been able to
minimize the damage on defense,
ranking over 10 spots better in scor
ing defense than total defense.
A large part of this efficiency is
due to turnovers, an area where
Virginia Tech and Stanford excel.
The Hokies lead the nation in
turnover margin, while the Cardi
nal is not far behind in a tie for
third. Both teams rely heavily on
winning the turnover battle, so the
team with fewer turnovers could
have a significant edge in the Or-

ange Bowl. In Virginia Tech's
shocking loss to James Madison in
early September, the Hokies com
mitted three turnovers without
forcing any. In their next 11 games,
they forced 28 turnovers while
committing only eight. Likewise,
Stanford gave away three
turnovers in each of three consecu
tive games against Notre Dame,
Oregon and USC. The Cardinal's
lone loss and its closest win both
came in that stretch. In Stanford's
nine other games, the Cardinal
committed only six turnovers and
had an average margin of victory of
29.6 points per game.
Looking for a glaring weakness
that could separate these two
teams? Don't look at Stanford.
Among the eight major offensive
and defensive categories scor
ing, total, rushing and passing effi
ciency offense and defense the
Cardinal ranks in the top 25 nation
ally in all eight. Stanford avoids the
big play as well, ranking first na
tionally in sacks allowed. One of
the biggest areas where Virginia
Tech figures to have an advantage
over Stanford is in special teams,
where Hokie head coach Frank
Beamer's teams always make a liv

punting and the return game.
However, Stanford's best
weapon in special teams may be the

sidelines. That is because the Cardi
nal has punted only 29 times all
season, the fewest in the country.
This can be attributed to convert
ing on third and fourth downs. In
deed, Stanford has the highest
third-down conversion rate in the
nation at 57.8 percent and the
eighth-highest fourth-down con
version rate at 73.3 percent, so the
Cardinal offense is among the best
in the country at staying on the
field and keeping drives alive. This
efficiency has led Stanford to get to
the red zone and score there more
per game than any other team in
the country.
Stopping this offense will be the
task awaiting Virginia Tech's de
fense, which is among the stingiest
units in the country against the
pass. The Hokies are eighth in pass
efficiency defense and second with
22 interceptions, so they will not
make Stanford quarterback An
drew Luck's day easy. While Luck
gets the acclaim for Stanford's of
fense, the running game might be
the Cardinal's best chance to win.
Stanford is 17th in the country,
rushing for 211 yards per game, and
Virginia Tech's defense gives up
148 yards per game on the ground,

only 59th nationally.
When the Hokies have the ball,
they will turn to their efficient and
capable senior quarterback, Tyrod
Taylor. Taylor is 13th in the country
in passing efficiency, throwing for
23 touchdowns and only four inter
ceptions in 13 games. The running
game will be important for Virginia
Tech, as over half its yardage comes
on the ground. However, the Hok
ies could be short on running backs
Monday night, as sophomore
David Wilson will be suspended for
the first quarter after he missed a
curfew, and sophomore Ryan
Williams is questionable with an
injured hamstring.
As far as intangibles, Virginia
Tech has the advantage of a more
experienced coach and a more ex
perienced quarterback, as well as
experience playing in this very
same BCS game twice in the last
three years. Stanford comes in with
the higher ranking at No. 4, and the
Hokies are 1-26 against top-five
teams. However, the last three Or
ange Bowls have been won by the
lower-ranked team.
In addition to a BCS victory and
bragging rights, whoever wins will
secure its program's first ever 12-
win season.
It will all be decided tonight in
Miami.
