# Uncertain future post-Orange Bowl
## 
### Daniel Bohm On My Mind 
Tonight the Stanford foot
ball team will play both its
most and least important
game of the season. It's the
most important game for
obvious reasons. It's the culmination
of an entire season that can be de
scribed as nothing short of euphoric.
Nationally televised against a peren
nial power, tonight's game provides
the opportunity for Stanford to make
a statement about its program and the
power of the Pac-10 Conference.
So sure, tonight's game has intrin
sic value, and winning a bowl game for
the first time since 1996 would be nice,
but whether Stanford wins or loses
likely has little bearing on the pro
gram as a whole. While the first 12
games of this season were all do-or
die, vitally important games with mas
sive ramifications in the Pac-10 and
bowl races, when Stanford takes the
field next after the Orange Bowl, it
will be 0-0, whether it wins or loses
tonight.
Now you may be asking yourself
why I am downplaying the impor
tance of what is unquestionably the
most notable Stanford football game
since the 2000 Rose Bowl. Well, the
answer is because playing in the Or
ange Bowl is a symbolic point in the
ascension of the Stanford football
program. What is even more impor
tant than the game is to see if the Car
dinal peaks, plateaus or keeps climb
ing after playing Virginia Tech tonight
again, win or lose.
Consider this: when Stanford
played in the Rose Bowl 11 years ago,
it was considered a program on the
rise; it had a hot young coach (Tyrone
Willingham) and seemed destined to
be a Pac-10 contender year in and
year out.
What happened next? Stanford
played in one bowl game (the illustri
ous but now-defunct Seattle Bowl) in
eight years, Willingham bolted from
the Farm for Notre Dame and Stan
ford became, by 2006, the laughing
stock of the Pac-10.
Now with the Cardinal primed to
take the field for its second BCS bowl
game, it is considered a program on
the rise, it has a hot young coach (Jim
Harbaugh) coveted by every school
and NFL team with a vacancy, and the
team looks ready to compete every
year. The question is, will history re
peat itself?
Initially, I want to say no. First off,
the 2000 Stanford Rose Bowl team
frankly wasn't all that good. In most
years, it would not have played in a
BCS bowl (think Connecticut this
year). Including the Rose Bowl loss to
Wisconsin, Stanford went 8-4 that sea
son, including a 52-point defeat to
Texas and a loss to the always-power
ful San Jose State Spartans.
This year's team is not a mediocre
BCS team it is a juggernaut in all
facets of the game with its only loss
coming at the hands of the nation's
best team.
Secondly, Stanford has become a
recruiting force and has gotten better
year after year, from 1-11 in 2006 to
11 -1 in 2010. In the years leading up to
that Rose Bowl appearance, Stanford
had actually been getting worse (7-5
in 1996,5-6 in 1997 and 3-8 in 1998 be
fore going 8-3 in the 1999 regular sea
son leading up to the 2000 Rose
Bowl).

However, a drop-off after this
year's Orange Bowl is both possible
and not far-fetched. Although some
one's mailman's friend's sister's
boyfriend told them that Andrew
Luck is planning on returning to Stan
ford for a fourth year, he could leave

and be replaced with a sinkhole at
quarterback. That, coupled with the
loss of three offensive linemen, two
key wide receivers and numerous im
portant defensive players, could set
the Cardinal back next season.
More likely than Luck heading to
the NFL, however, is Flarbaugh doing
his best Willingham impression and
leaving the Farm when the going is
good (at least that is what someone's
mailman's friend's sister's boyfriend is
telling some reporters). Stanford has
quite the reservoir of great assistants,
but much of the success of the pro
gram has depended on Harbaugh's
celebrity, energy and recruiting ability.
His departure would undoubtedly
have an effect on Stanford's recruit
ing. Prized linebacker recruit James
Vaughters indicated last week that he
is considering reopening his recruit
ment because of the uncertainty
about Harbaugh's status. Stanford
fans know that the Cardinal cannot af
ford another Buddy Teevens-like hir
ing (or Walt Harris, for that matter).
I would suggest that Harbaugh
take a look at the nosedive Willing
ham's career took after leaving Stan
ford (he failed at Washington after
failing at Notre Dame and is now "re
tired"), and consider himself content
on the Farm. Under his tutelage, it is
not outrageous to envision Stanford
as a BCS candidate season after sea
son.
What might be a bit scary for Stan
ford fans is that a fall from grace isn't
uncommon for Orange Bowl partici
pants â€” and coaches.
Louisville, Wake Forest, Kansas,
Cincinnati, Georgia Tech and Iowa all
regressed after their Orange Bowl
showings in the past four years, while
only Virginia Tech, Stanford's oppo
nent, remained strong since its 2009
Orange Bowl appearance. Only time
will tell if the Cardinal will fall victim
to the struggles of these other pro
grams, or if it can build off this amaz
ing season.

If you're someone's mailman's
friend's sister's boyfriend, tell Daniel
Bohm what you think about the fu
ture of Cardinal football at

When Stanford
takes the field
next after the
Orange Bowl, it
will be 0-0, win
or lose.
