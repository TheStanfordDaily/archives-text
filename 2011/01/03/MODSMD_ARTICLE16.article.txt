## 'Death to the BCS' may be the answer 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY MANAGING EDITOR 
There's a cartel running the post
season of college football's highest
level, forcing upon its disapproving
fans a broken system the BCS
that is more about the consolidation
of power than the promotion of pre
miere football. At least, that's the
argument of Dan Wetzel, Josh Peter
and Jeff Passan, whose book,
"Death to the BCS," has rattled the
college football world this fall. An
investigative look at all of the issues
with the BCS (read: they're numer
ous), "Death to the BCS" identifies
the commissioners of the six major
conferences as "the Cartel" who,
with the support of athletic direc
tors, complacent school presidents
and manipulative bowl directors,
"dictate how the sport operates."
The conclusion is this: despite a
massive grassroots movement
against the BCS, and far superior fi
nancial alternatives on the table, the
Cartel would rather maintain the
status quo and preserve its current
reign over the system.
It's a searing conclusion, but the
journalists do not stop there. In tan
dem with the authors' review of fi
nancial documents and congres
sional testimonies is another post
season plan: a 16-team playoff, fea-

Turing the 11 conference champions
and five at-large teams. The Daily
spoke with Passan about both facets
of the book and how, if the new sys
tem detailed by "Death to the BCS"
was put in place, Stanford's season
may have ended differently.

The Stanford Daily: For "the Car
tel," as you call it, it's more about re
taining power than making more
money. If there's actually a chance
to make more money, doesn't that
in turn lead to more power, even if
it's shared?

Jeff Passan: Well, money doesn't
necessarily equate to power. Power
is the ability to control things, and
that's what they have right now, and
I think that they're worried that by
sharing the money, that they're
going to somehow translate that
into the power that they have now.
If you look at a business, and
you're making out like bandits, and
you have a monopoly, essentially,
that's where the BCS is right now.
And that's where these conferences
are. If all of a sudden, you can tell
them, "you can make significantly
more money, but you risk losing
what's most important to you,"
they're probably not going to be too
