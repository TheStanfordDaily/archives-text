## 'Death to the BCS' may be the answer 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY MANAGING EDITOR 
There's a cartel running the post
season of college football's highest
level, forcing upon its disapproving
fans a broken system the BCS
that is more about the consolidation
of power than the promotion of pre
miere football. At least, that's the
argument of Dan Wetzel, Josh Peter
and Jeff Passan, whose book,
"Death to the BCS," has rattled the
college football world this fall. An
investigative look at all of the issues
with the BCS (read: they're numer
ous), "Death to the BCS" identifies
the commissioners of the six major
conferences as "the Cartel" who,
with the support of athletic direc
tors, complacent school presidents
and manipulative bowl directors,
"dictate how the sport operates."
The conclusion is this: despite a
massive grassroots movement
against the BCS, and far superior fi
nancial alternatives on the table, the
Cartel would rather maintain the
status quo and preserve its current
reign over the system.
It's a searing conclusion, but the
journalists do not stop there. In tan
dem with the authors' review of fi
nancial documents and congres
sional testimonies is another post
season plan: a 16-team playoff, fea-

Turing the 11 conference champions
and five at-large teams. The Daily
spoke with Passan about both facets
of the book and how, if the new sys
tem detailed by "Death to the BCS"
was put in place, Stanford's season
may have ended differently.

The Stanford Daily: For "the Car
tel," as you call it, it's more about re
taining power than making more
money. If there's actually a chance
to make more money, doesn't that
in turn lead to more power, even if
it's shared?

Jeff Passan: Well, money doesn't
necessarily equate to power. Power
is the ability to control things, and
that's what they have right now, and
I think that they're worried that by
sharing the money, that they're
going to somehow translate that
into the power that they have now.
If you look at a business, and
you're making out like bandits, and
you have a monopoly, essentially,
that's where the BCS is right now.
And that's where these conferences
are. If all of a sudden, you can tell
them, "you can make significantly
more money, but you risk losing
what's most important to you,"
they're probably not going to be too

keen on the idea. Business is good
for them right now. As long as they
can get by without the universities
and alumni giving them grief, they
are going to go on their merry way.

TSD: There seems to be a dramatic
amount of grassroots support for a
playoff, and yet, nothing. Even with
a proposal such as yours out there,
which takes into account all of the
things that would appease the BCS
powers, is it not a futile effort?

JP: Yes. As we say in the book,
there's a million reasons not to
have the BCS, and any one of them,
on their individual merits, should
be enough. Combine those, and it
should be enough for it to implode
on itself. But that speaks to the
power the people running it right
now have over college football. Un
fortunately, the university presi
dents, the people who have the
power to do something about this,
aren't educated enough about this.
If they really knew what this system
was about, really knew the way that
it was, there would be no way that
they would leave all of that money
on the table, when 106 of 120 Divi
sion I athletic programs are running
budget deficits.

TSD: There's the idea of the plus
one, or the eight-team bracket as
opposed to the 16-team bracket. So,
you have one proposal, but would
you, or do you believe the public
would, be satisfied with any of these
alternate ideas?

JP: Any system would be better
than the BCS. That being said, our
system is designed for specific rea
sons. One of the things the BCS
says is that it has the best regular
season in college sports. In order to
keep that regular season relevant,
you need to make literally every
game count, so by designing the
playoff like we did, with every con
ference getting an at-large bid, it in
centivizes teams in two ways: first, it
says that even though you're in a
small conference, you will at least
have a chance to play for a national
championship, and second, in a lot

of cases, it makes for easier early
round games for those top teams.
There's an incentive to get that No.
1 or No. 2 seed.That, combined with
the home playoff games, makes the
regular season enormously valu
able. The difference between an
eight and nine seed is the difference
between hosting a home playoff
game or going on the road in the
first round. You have a situation
where you have easier first-round
games for the top seeds, and home
field advantage for the top seeds,
and I'd say that makes the regular
season of paramount importance.

TSD: Stanford finishes No. 4 in the
BCS standings, goes 11-1 and does
not win its conference. So, under
this scenario, Stanford would get an
at-large bid and play either a weak
er at-large team or play one of the
champions from the smaller confer
ences?

JP: Yes, that's exactly what would
happen. They would play at home,
and would be either the No. 4 or No.
5 seed either them or Wisconsin.
And right there, another important
delineation. The No. 4 seed gets two
home games. The No. 5 seed gets
one. You could have an argument
on both seeds Stanford or Wis
consin, Stanford or Wisconsin. Ei
ther way, they're both going to play
first-round home games and would
get to play each other in the second
round if they were both to win.

TSD: You don't think that trying to
decide who got which seed would
create some of its own controver
sies? That were would be unintend
ed consequences?

JP: Oh, sure. We're not saying that
there's ever going to be a system
that's completely devoid of contro
versy. There's going to be contro
versy here and there, but I'd like to
think that you'd put in place a sys
tem with an educated selection
committee like the NCAA
March Madness basketball selec
tion committees which has a
hand in making a bracket along
specified terms. You're never going
to get it 100 percent right, but you'd
like to think that it'd be a whole lot
closer than it is right now.
