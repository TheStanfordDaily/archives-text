## Card dominates over Cal at home 
### ZACH ZIMMERMAN DESK EDITOR 
For the senior-less Stanford
men's basketball team, there's just
no place like home.
The Cardinal (8-4, 1-0 Pac-10)
opened conference play in convinc
ing fashion on Sunday, beating rival
California (7-6, 0-1) 82-68 on Sun
day night. With the win, Stanford
improved its record in Maples
Pavilion to 7-0 on the season.

Junior guard Jeremy Green led
the way for the Cardinal, hitting all
four of his three-point attempts in
the first half to finish the game with
2f points. Freshman forward
Dwight Powell added 20 points and
seven rebounds off the bench in just
28 minutes in the most dominant

performance of his young career.
After avenging a home loss to
Cal last season, Stanford head
coach Johnny Dawkins was opti
mistic regarding his team's ceiling
within a puzzling Pac-10 Confer
ence.
"We're excited," Dawkins said.
"We're 1-0 in Pac-10 play. Why not
us? I think we've got a chance to be
as good as anybody."
The two teams battled back and
forth in a tale of mirror images in
the first half. The Cardinal and
Golden Bears shot an identical 48
percent from the field with neither
team able to find breathing room.
Stanford managed to escape the
opening period ahead at 38-34 be
