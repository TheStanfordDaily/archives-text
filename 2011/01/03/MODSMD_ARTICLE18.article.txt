# MEN'S BASKETBALL
## Card dominates over Cal at home 
### ZACH ZIMMERMAN DESK EDITOR 
For the senior-less Stanford
men's basketball team, there's just
no place like home.
The Cardinal (8-4, 1-0 Pac-10)
opened conference play in convinc
ing fashion on Sunday, beating rival
California (7-6, 0-1) 82-68 on Sun
day night. With the win, Stanford
improved its record in Maples
Pavilion to 7-0 on the season.

Junior guard Jeremy Green led
the way for the Cardinal, hitting all
four of his three-point attempts in
the first half to finish the game with
2f points. Freshman forward
Dwight Powell added 20 points and
seven rebounds off the bench in just
28 minutes in the most dominant

performance of his young career.
After avenging a home loss to
Cal last season, Stanford head
coach Johnny Dawkins was opti
mistic regarding his team's ceiling
within a puzzling Pac-10 Confer
ence.
"We're excited," Dawkins said.
"We're 1-0 in Pac-10 play. Why not
us? I think we've got a chance to be
as good as anybody."
The two teams battled back and
forth in a tale of mirror images in
the first half. The Cardinal and
Golden Bears shot an identical 48
percent from the field with neither
team able to find breathing room.

opening period ahead at 38-34 be

off the bench in just 28 minutes Sunday night in the most dominant
performance of his young career.
hind six three-pointers on 50-per
cent shooting.
Green meticulously worked
around the perimeter to start the
game, using high screens and drib
ble-drive penetration by his team
mates to find open looks. Despite a
strong defensive effort from Cal
junior guard Jorge Gutierrez, Stan
ford's leading scorer found nothing
but net, leading all scorers with 14
points on 5-of-6 shooting at the end
of the half.

The Golden Bears hung around
behind dominant post play by jun
ior forward Harper Kamp. Using
strong moves off the block, Kamp
proved too much to handle for the
Stanford frontline. He finished with
16 points on the evening, but was
underutilized in the second half
with his team launching threes in an
effort to close the gap.
Kamp blamed Cal's lack of ener
gy for allowing the game to slip
away.

"I'm not surprised [by the out
come]," he said. "I expect every
team in this league to come out and
be able to whoop you if you don't
play hard."

Stanford bent but did not break
in the closing period, extending its
lead to as much as 17 behind the
play of its prized freshman trio con
sisting of Powell, point guard Aaron
Bright and combo guard Anthony
Brown.

Powell was aggressive when his
number was called, leaving the Cal
big men without an answer for his
wide range of skills. He teamed up
with classmates Bright and Brown
along the perimeter, and the three
peppered a disorganized Golden
Bears defense with a barrage from
the outside.

Dawkins was pleased to see his
recruits elevating their play on the

conference stage.
"That was one of the best mo
ments [Powell, Bright and Brown]
have had together," he said. "It's
good to see our guys play that well
together."
Cal head coach Mike Mont
gomery, who coached the Cardinal
from 1986-2004, spoke highly of
Powell's skill set and credited the
young forward as the key to Stan
ford's success.

"He's quick with the ball,"
Montgomery said. "He pretty much
took us where he wanted, and he
made some tough shots. That was
the best game he's had in his career,
and it just so happened against us."
Brown finished with 11 points
and showed flashes of his shooting
stroke that made him one of the
prized conference recruits. Bright
tacked on 10 to go with his four as
sists.

Despite a 15-point lead with just
5:39 to play, Stanford was unable to
put the game away for good until
the closing minutes. Cal freshman
guard Gary Franklin hit three shots
from deep in the second half to help
bring his team within nine at 71-62.
Fortunately for Stanford, Franklin
cooled off at the right time, and
timely free-throw shooting by Pow
ell and Green iced the game for the
Cardinal.

"The kids played with a lot of
heart and showed a lot of poise,"
Dawkins said. "They made the
plays they needed to keep us ahead.
I'm really proud of all the players."
Up next for Stanford is its first
Pac-10 road trip of the season. The
team travels to Arizona State on
Thursday night before capping off
the weekend against Arizona on
Saturday.

The Cardinal will look to find its
rhythm on the road for the first
time this season when it battles the
Sun Devils in Tempe at 5:30 p.m. on
Thursday.

opened conference play in convinc
ing fashion on Sunday, beating rival
California (7-6, 0-1) 82-68 on Sun
day night. With the win, Stanford
improved its record in Maples
Pavilion to 7-0 on the season.

Junior guard Jeremy Green led
the way for the Cardinal, hitting all
four of his three-point attempts in
the first half to finish the game with
2f points. Freshman forward
Dwight Powell added 20 points and
seven rebounds off the bench in just
28 minutes in the most dominant

performance of his young career.
After avenging a home loss to
Cal last season, Stanford head
coach Johnny Dawkins was opti
mistic regarding his team's ceiling
within a puzzling Pac-10 Confer
ence.
"We're excited," Dawkins said.
"We're 1-0 in Pac-10 play. Why not
us? I think we've got a chance to be
as good as anybody."
The two teams battled back and
forth in a tale of mirror images in
the first half. The Cardinal and
Golden Bears shot an identical 48
percent from the field with neither
team able to find breathing room.

hind six three-pointers on 50-per
cent shooting.
Green meticulously worked
around the perimeter to start the
game, using high screens and drib
ble-drive penetration by his team
mates to find open looks. Despite a
strong defensive effort from Cal
junior guard Jorge Gutierrez, Stan
ford's leading scorer found nothing
but net, leading all scorers with 14
points on 5-of-6 shooting at the end
of the half.

The Golden Bears hung around
behind dominant post play by jun
ior forward Harper Kamp. Using
strong moves off the block, Kamp
proved too much to handle for the
Stanford frontline. He finished with
16 points on the evening, but was
underutilized in the second half
with his team launching threes in an
effort to close the gap.
Kamp blamed Cal's lack of ener
gy for allowing the game to slip
away.

"I'm not surprised [by the out
come]," he said. "I expect every
team in this league to come out and
be able to whoop you if you don't
play hard."

Stanford bent but did not break
in the closing period, extending its
lead to as much as 17 behind the
play of its prized freshman trio con
sisting of Powell, point guard Aaron
Bright and combo guard Anthony
Brown.

Powell was aggressive when his
number was called, leaving the Cal
big men without an answer for his
wide range of skills. He teamed up
with classmates Bright and Brown
along the perimeter, and the three
peppered a disorganized Golden
Bears defense with a barrage from
the outside.

Dawkins was pleased to see his
recruits elevating their play on the

conference stage.
"That was one of the best mo
ments [Powell, Bright and Brown]
have had together," he said. "It's
good to see our guys play that well
together."
Cal head coach Mike Mont
gomery, who coached the Cardinal
from 1986-2004, spoke highly of
Powell's skill set and credited the
young forward as the key to Stan
ford's success.

"He's quick with the ball,"
Montgomery said. "He pretty much
took us where he wanted, and he
made some tough shots. That was
the best game he's had in his career,
and it just so happened against us."
Brown finished with 11 points
and showed flashes of his shooting
stroke that made him one of the
prized conference recruits. Bright
tacked on 10 to go with his four as
sists.

Despite a 15-point lead with just
5:39 to play, Stanford was unable to
put the game away for good until
the closing minutes. Cal freshman
guard Gary Franklin hit three shots
from deep in the second half to help
bring his team within nine at 71-62.
Fortunately for Stanford, Franklin
cooled off at the right time, and
timely free-throw shooting by Pow
ell and Green iced the game for the
Cardinal.

"The kids played with a lot of
heart and showed a lot of poise,"
Dawkins said. "They made the
plays they needed to keep us ahead.
I'm really proud of all the players."
Up next for Stanford is its first
Pac-10 road trip of the season. The
team travels to Arizona State on
Thursday night before capping off
the weekend against Arizona on
Saturday.

The Cardinal will look to find its
rhythm on the road for the first
time this season when it battles the
Sun Devils in Tempe at 5:30 p.m. on
Thursday.
