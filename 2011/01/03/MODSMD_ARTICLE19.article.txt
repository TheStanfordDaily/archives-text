# WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
## Strong conference start against Cal 
### JACK BLANCHAT CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The No. 9 Stanford women's bas
ketball team (10-2,1-0 Pac-10) rang
in 2011 in style, with a 78-45 victory
over California in Berkeley on Sun
day.
After busting Connecticut's 90-
game winning streak on Thursday,
the Cardinal couldn't afford a let
down game. It rolled out to a big
lead early against the Golden Bears
(8-4,0-1) and never looked back.
Sunday's game at Haas Pavilion
was the Pac-10 opener for both
teams, and the star of the show was
a shutdown Stanford defense, which
held the Golden Bears to 34.5-per
cent shooting and 27.3-percent
from three-point range.
Offensively, five Cardinal play
ers ended up with double-digit
point totals, including 15 from sen
ior guard Jeanette Pohlen, who had
another stellar performance to help
Stanford extend its win streak over
the Bears to five in a row.
Junior forward Nnemkadi Og
wumike followed Pohlen with 14
points and seven rebounds, but she
was forced to leave the game with
an injury to her right shoulder early
in the second half.
Freshman guard Toni Kokenis, in
only 17 minutes on the floor, was
next in line with 12 points, including
three three-pointers. Senior for
ward Kayla Pedersen and freshman
forward Chiney Ogwumike each
had 11 points, and the two com
bined to pull down 16 of Stanford's
45 rebounds. Thanks to Pedersen
and the Ogwumike sisters, the Car
dinal dominated on the glass, as the
45-26 rebounding margin was Stan
ford's second-largest of the season.
Highlights were harder to come
by for the Golden Bears, who only
had two players finish with double
digit point totals and shot a miser

able 22 percent from the free-throw
line. Centers Talia Caldwell and
Rama N'dlaye both had 10 points,
and Eliza Pierre and Layshia
Clarendon each added six points.
The most glaring hole in the stat
line was sophomore DeNesha Stall
worth, who scored just two points.
Stallworth, who was elected to the
Pac-10 all-freshman team last sea
son, has already had five double
doubles this season, and averaged
12.9 points per game last season.
Shutting down big scorers has
been the Cardinal's strength lately,
as Stanford has reeled off four im
pressive wins in a row after drop
ping back-to-back games in mid-
December. The centerpiece, of
course, is the defeat of the No. 1
Huskies, where the Cardinal held
superstar guard Maya Moore to 14
points on 5-for-15 shooting from the
floor.

Another reason for the Cardi
nal's great play as of late is the scor
ing surge of Pohlen, who is averag
ing 19.2 points per game since the
start of December, including a ca
reer-high 31 points in the victory
over Connecticut.
One bonus of having such a
strong finish to 2010 and start to
2011 is that the Cardinal can ex
pect to regain some lost ground in
the rankings. The Cardinal had
dropped to No. 9 in the country by
last week's Associated Press rank
ings, but thanks to the victory over
No. 1 UConn and an 89-52 trounc
ing of No. 4 Xavier, the Cardinal will
most likely move back into the top
five today.
Stanford will return to the Farm
this weekend, as the Cardinal hosts
Arizona on Thursday night at 7 p.m.
and Arizona State on Saturday at 2
p.m.
