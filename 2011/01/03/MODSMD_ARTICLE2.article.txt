## Profs talk Orange Bowl Provost asks profs to remain flexible' 
### ELLORA ISRANI CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Today in Miami, the Stanford
football team will make its first ap
pearance at a Bowl Championship
Series game since 2000, drawing
from across the country thousands
of fans and a big academic question:
should these students' absences
from the first two days of winter
quarter be excused by the Universi
ty?
After Stanford accepted an invi
tation to play in the Orange Bowl,
Provost John Etchemendy Ph.D. 'B2
wrote an e-mail on Dec. 13 to all fac
ulty asking them to "remain flexi
ble" with students who miss classes
for the Orange Bowl. His letter
called the game "a tremendous ac
complishment for the players and a
source of pride and excitement for
our students and alumni." Naming
Stanford's football team as "excep
tional in its success," he requested
that faculty accommodate all stu
dents who miss classes to "show the
team the support they deserve."
Students earlier signed an online
petition asking President John Hen
nessy to excuse students from
school for the Orange Bowl, but
Etchemendy said the petition had
nothing to do with his letter; in fact,
he said he wasn't aware of the peti
tion until after he sent out the mes
sage. He said that the e-mail was
written to assuage fears of students
missing classes for the game, to give
professors a heads-up and to show
the football team that the Universi
ty was fully behind them.
The faculty response to
Etchemendy's letter remains, in
general, positive. Professors have
expressed confidence in students'
ability to take initiative and make up
any work they may have missed.
"For this exceptional case, I don't
see any need [for official make-up
policies] and cannot imagine it
would be a problem," English pro
fessor Michelle Elam wrote in an e
mail to The Daily. "Stanford stu
dents are so committed to their own
education anyway, so my experience
has been that they take responsibili
ty."
Furthermore, the fact that stu
dents often "shop" classes for the
first week of the quarter means at
tendance is already sporadic.
"Practically, since the Orange
Bowl occurs at the start of the winter
quarter, there is no real impact,"
computer science professor Stephen
Cooper wrote in an e-mail to The
Daily. "Students are adding and
dropping classes during the first
week of classes. Thus a student who
misses, say, Monday and Wednesday
due to being in Miami is in effective
ly the same position as a student
who decides to add a particular class
after missing the first two meetings
of that class."
Professors have also cited a de
sire to support student athletes and
the diversity of experience that their
accomplishment adds to the school.
"Stanford has achieved a wonder
ful balance between its main (aca-


ANASTASIA YEE/
The Stanford Daily
demic) reason for existence, and ath
letics," wrote applied physics profes
sor Theodore Geballe in an e-mail to
The Daily. "Being excellent in both is
indeed very rare. This balance is well
worth preserving for reasons that
have been stated many times so I
don't have to repeat them."
Cooper did raise his concern as
to whether pardoning students at
tending the Orange Bowl shows an
undeserved preference for football
over Stanford's 33 other varsity
sports.
"School spirit is a good thing ...
[but] I'm not sure why school spirit
applies more to one sport than an
other," Cooper said.
Unlike many schools whose ath
letic success rests mostly on the
record of its football team, Stan
ford's program draws strength from
consistent performance in a broad

number of sports, evidenced by its
16 consecutive Directors' Cups. Of
Stanford's 99 NCAA champi
onships, one was for football; on the
other hand, men's and women's ten
nis have together won 35.
"The women's soccer team had
an outstanding year, but the provost
didn't send out an e-mail asking
professors to 'go easy' on students
who were traveling to North Caroli
na to attend the championship,"
Cooper said. "Likewise, there was
no note pertaining to students going
to Ohio for the women's volleyball
regional championship."
Regardless of these concerns,
students attending the Orange
Bowl have, this time around,
achieved an official "blessing." And
officials remain optimistic that the
issue might rise again.
"I need to figure out what we'll
do next year when the team goes to
the BCS Championship game,"
Etehemendy said.

ford's program draws strength from
consistent performance in a broad

number of sports, evidenced by its
16 consecutive Directors' Cups. Of
Stanford's 99 NCAA champi
onships, one was for football; on the
other hand, men's and women's ten
nis have together won 35.
"The women's soccer team had
an outstanding year, but the provost
didn't send out an e-mail asking
professors to 'go easy' on students
who were traveling to North Caroli
na to attend the championship,"
Cooper said. "Likewise, there was
no note pertaining to students going
to Ohio for the women's volleyball
regional championship."
Regardless of these concerns,
students attending the Orange
Bowl have, this time around,
achieved an official "blessing." And
officials remain optimistic that the
issue might rise again.
"I need to figure out what we'll
do next year when the team goes to
the BCS Championship game,"
Etehemendy said.
