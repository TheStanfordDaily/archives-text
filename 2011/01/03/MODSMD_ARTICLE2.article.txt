## Profs talk Orange Bowl Provost asks profs to remain flexible' 
### ELLORA ISRANI CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Today in Miami, the Stanford
football team will make its first ap
pearance at a Bowl Championship
Series game since 2000, drawing
from across the country thousands
of fans and a big academic question:
should these students' absences
from the first two days of winter
quarter be excused by the Universi
ty?
After Stanford accepted an invi
tation to play in the Orange Bowl,
Provost John Etchemendy Ph.D. 'B2
wrote an e-mail on Dec. 13 to all fac
ulty asking them to "remain flexi
ble" with students who miss classes
for the Orange Bowl. His letter
called the game "a tremendous ac
complishment for the players and a
source of pride and excitement for
our students and alumni." Naming
Stanford's football team as "excep
tional in its success," he requested
that faculty accommodate all stu
dents who miss classes to "show the
team the support they deserve."
Students earlier signed an online
petition asking President John Hen
nessy to excuse students from
school for the Orange Bowl, but
Etchemendy said the petition had
nothing to do with his letter; in fact,
he said he wasn't aware of the peti
tion until after he sent out the mes
sage. He said that the e-mail was
written to assuage fears of students
missing classes for the game, to give
professors a heads-up and to show
the football team that the Universi
ty was fully behind them.
The faculty response to
Etchemendy's letter remains, in
general, positive. Professors have
expressed confidence in students'
ability to take initiative and make up
any work they may have missed.
"For this exceptional case, I don't
see any need [for official make-up
policies] and cannot imagine it
would be a problem," English pro
fessor Michelle Elam wrote in an e
mail to The Daily. "Stanford stu
dents are so committed to their own
education anyway, so my experience
has been that they take responsibili
ty."
Furthermore, the fact that stu
dents often "shop" classes for the
first week of the quarter means at
tendance is already sporadic.
"Practically, since the Orange
Bowl occurs at the start of the winter
quarter, there is no real impact,"
computer science professor Stephen
Cooper wrote in an e-mail to The
Daily. "Students are adding and
dropping classes during the first
week of classes. Thus a student who
misses, say, Monday and Wednesday
due to being in Miami is in effective
ly the same position as a student
who decides to add a particular class
after missing the first two meetings
of that class."
Professors have also cited a de
sire to support student athletes and
the diversity of experience that their
accomplishment adds to the school.
"Stanford has achieved a wonder
ful balance between its main (aca-
