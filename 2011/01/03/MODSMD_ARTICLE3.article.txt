# MIAMI MATCH-UP
## The
						Card faces Virginia Tech tonight in Orange Bowl 
### KABIR SAWHNEY MANAGING EDITOR 
The best season in Stanford football history
will come to its conclusion tonight as the Cardi
nal takes the field in its first BCS bowl game in
over a decade, the Discover Orange Bowl in
Miami Gardens, Fla.

No. 4 Stanford (11-1,8-1 Pac-10) is set to face
No.l3VirginiaTech(ll-2,8-0 AC C). Both teams
are among the hottest in the country heading
into the game the Card has not lost since a 52-
31 defeat to Oregon on Oct. 2, while Virginia
Tech has won 11 straight games.
Stanford's appearance in the Orange Bowl
represents a remarkable turnaround for a pro

gram that was the punching bag of the Pac-10
just a few seasons ago. In 2006, Stanford went 1-
11, prompting the program to turn to current
head coach Jim Harbaugh. In his tenure, the
Cardinal has steadily improved, with higher win
totals in each successive season.

Even before this season, few thought that
Stanford would reach such heights.The Cardinal
was picked to finish fourth in the Pac-10 presea
son media poll behind Oregon, USC and Ore
gon State. Aside from its loss to the Ducks, Stan
ford looked very strong during the regular sea
son, winning most games by big margins. The
Cardinal faced only two close games: a 37-35 vic
tory over USC in early October decided on a
last-second field goal and a tight 17-13 win over

Arizona State in mid-November.
Virginia Tech will pose a challenge as formi
dable as any Stanford has faced this season. The
Hokies are a perennial power in the Atlantic
Coast Conference, winning three of the last four
conference championships. The program's last
trip to the Orange Bowl, at the conclusion of the
2008 season, ended in a victory over Cincinnati.
However, after the season's first two games, it
didn't look like Virginia Tech would be able to
pull off another conference title.The Hokies lost
both of those games, first to Boise State and then
to James Madison, an FCS program. After the
losses, head coach Frank Beamer managed to
turn his team around, and it blazed through the
ACC, going undefeated in conference play and
winning the conference championship game
over Florida State.

"I think as a player watching his team, you
know they're tough, they're physical and disci
plined. It's quite possibly the best defense we'll
face all year," said redshirt sophomore quarter
back Andrew Luck. "From my short history,
growing up and watching Virginia Tech, you al
ways knew they were going to be a tough foot
ball team that flew around with the football."
As it has all season, Stanford will look to its
offense to set the game's pace and lead it to an
other victory. The unit is ranked eighth in the
country in scoring.
With one of the best offensive lines in the
country, Stanford is likely to utilize the same
type of strategy that brought it success against
Pac-10 defenses: punish the opposing defense
with the power running game, opening up pass
ing lanes as the front seven is forced to respect
the ground game. Though many expected a
drop-off in rushing production after Stanford
lost Heisman runner-up Toby Gerhart to the
NFL, the Cardinal is better on the ground than it
is through the air it has the nation's 17th
ranked rushing attack but only its 30th-ranked
passing attack. Sophomore Stepfan Taylor is the
team's leading rusher, with 1,023 yards and 15
touchdowns for the season.
"Our offensive line has given up five sacks
this year, I believe, and maybe seven the years
before," said assistant head coach Greg Roman.
"For a drop-back passing team, can you really
find anybody who's ever really done that?"
"The offensive line has been excellent the
whole year, and also the tight ends and receivers
blocking downfield," Taylor said. "We go out
hard in practice everyday and are dedicated to
the running game."
Even then, the offense is still driven by the
play of Luck, this year's Heisman runner-up and
the projected No. 1 pick in the NFL Draft. He
has had one of the best seasons for a Stanford
quarterback in memory, passing for over 3,000
yards and throwing 28 touchdowns. He has also
shown a great deal of athleticism and an ability
to make plays with his legs, running for 438 yards
and three touchdowns on the season.
While Stanford's offense has been instru
mental to its success this year, much of the Car
dinal's improvement this year can be attributed
to its defensive renaissance. Last year, the de
fense was the Cardinal's Achilles' heel; this year,
under first-year defensive coordinator Vic Fan
gio, Stanford is ranked 11th in the country in
scoring defense, giving up just 17.8 points per
game. The unit shut out three conference oppo
nents this year, and its only really poor perform
ance came when it gave up 52 points to Oregon.
