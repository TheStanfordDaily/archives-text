A large tree near Freshman-Sophomore College, the under
graduate dorm on Santa Teresa Street, fell early the morning of
Dec. 19 during a storm that brought wind gusts of more than 40
mph. The tree damaged three rooms in Schiff, the building that
houses half of FroSoCo's 180 residents, according to college di
rectors Bryan and Cheryl Brown. No one was injured; students
moved out of dorms for winter break on Dec. 11.
The tree's fall broke windows in three student rooms and the
stairwell area, damaged the building's stucco exterior and dam
aged a portion of the roof, rain gutter and down spout, accord
ing to Imogen Hinds, senior associate director of Housing.
The tree is now removed from where it fell outside the dorm
and the students' rooms have been repaired, according to resi
dents.
Last October, falling trees damaged 12 cars on campus in
three separate incidents. There are more than 27,000 trees on
central campus, according to the Stanford website devoted to
the University's trees.
