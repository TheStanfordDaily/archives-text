## 'Don't ask' repeal could 'lighten task' for Stanford's ROTC committee 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Kate Abbott 
President Obama signed into law last month the repeal of the
17-year-old federal policy of "don't ask, don't tell," which barred
openly gay men and women from serving in the military. The ban,
which conflicts with several universities' anti-discrimination poli
cies, was considered a major roadblock to bringing back an ROTC
program to Stanford.
"I'm delighted by the repeal by Congress of 'don't ask, don't
tell,"' wrote psychology professor Ewart Thomas, the chair of the
Faculty Senate's ad hoc committee on ROTC, in an e-mail to The
Daily. "I have a feeling that this repeal will lighten the task of the
Faculty Senate's ROTC committee as we discuss whether, and in
what form, Stanford University should expand its relations with the
Reserve Officer Training Corps programs within the U.S. military."
The repeal does not necessarily guarantee recognition of ROTC
by the University. The committee recently asked for feedback from
the community on ROTC and will not report its findings until the
spring.
"The impact so far of DADT on campus debates has been mul
tifaceted, and I expect that the debate in the months following
DADT repeal will be almost as contentious," Thomas added.
The Faculty Senate formed the committee to explore the ROTC
issue in March, but from its inception, some encouraged the com
mittee not to let its findings depend on "don't ask, don't tell." Oth
ers said the repeal would be a prerequisite to the program's return.
Thomas said not all opposition to ROTC is rooted in the federal
policy, and that concerns about continued discrimination against
gays and lesbians in the military after the repeal could still exist.
But the repeal eliminates some of the committee's concerns, ac
cording to Thomas.
"To the degree that evidence and arguments can be adduced to
suggest a decrease in discrimination within the U.S. military follow
ing DADT repeal, and to the degree that the repeal does indeed in
duce opposers to become supporters of ROTC expansion, the next
phase of the Stanford-ROTC debate will contain fewer themes, and
this, I hope, will lighten our task," he said.
