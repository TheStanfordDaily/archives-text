### DAILY NEWS STAFF 
Stanford has admitted 754 early applicants to the Class of 2015 and
deferred about 500 more, Admission Director Bob Patterson said
last month.
The University received a record-high 5,929 applicants, dropping
the admission rate to 12.7 percent for Stanford's "restrictive early-ac
tion program." Applicants were up 6.5 percent from last year, when
Stanford admitted 753 of its 5,566 applicants, or 13.5 percent. The
University notified all early applicants of their application status via
e-mail on the afternoon of Dec. 10.
