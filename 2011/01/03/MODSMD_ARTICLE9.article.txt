## THE 						TRANSITIVE PROPERTY The 						Most Obnoxious Personals Ad Ever 
### Cristopher Bautista 
I'll admit that most of my past
columns consisted of depressing
topics. I went through some really
rough times last quarter, so I apolo
gize if I sounded a bit whiny. (To the
trans folks reading this, please re
member, don't take a full course load
the quarter you start hormones! It's
bad news.) But this quarter this is
a new quarter, one where I'm gonna
start over and I'm gonna be happy.
I've got the hard stuff over with al
ready. I legally changed my name. I
started testosterone. I went through
the hormone-induced episodes of
teen angst. My throat is perpetually
sore, a sign that my sexy man voice is
finally kicking in. I think I deserve to
have some fun now. So what 's next in
the saga of Cristopher Bautista's life?
Well, I've never dated. I know
I've written about relationships be
fore, but in rereading it, there was
this underlying pessimism, this im
pression that I would never be able
to find anyone. And to a degree, I still
feel that way. But one of my goals
this year is to push myself to do
things I would never do otherwise.
Now that I'm not freaking out every
minute of every day, wondering if I
pass as a guy or not, I feel I can actu
ally try branching out.
So this is it. Cristopher is looking
for a nice girl who's willing to put up
with him. And he's exploiting his po
sition as a columnist to do just that.
Get ready for perhaps the most ob
noxious personals ad ever. Here
goes:

Dear women of Stanford,
So dating a transguy is different
from dating a regular guy. For one
thing, I'm mature for my age. That's
what happens when you're forced to
question the very core of your iden
tity you end up growing up pretty
fast. I haven't lived as male for as
long as other guys while most
have lived as male for all of their
lives, I've only lived as male for
about two years. As a result of being
a bit behind on the masculinity
curve, I might act a bit differently
than some other guys you've dated.
So if you flirt with me and I don't get
the picture, it's not because I don't
like you or I'm ignoring you it's
because it's something I never
learned, and I'm still getting the hang
of things. But despite awkwardness
when it comes to flirting, I promise
I'll be able to understand you a lot
better than other guys you've dated
(I did live as a girl for a while, if you
didn't know that already).
I have a testosterone deficiency
(due to the whole estrogen and fe
male body thing), and I've just start
ed hormone replacement therapy, so
I'm in a state when I am hungry and
awkwardly horny all the time
(testosterone sharply increases both
your metabolism and your libido),
not to mention my voice is at a weird
in-between raspy cracked stage.

You'll have a boyfriend who (at least
at the moment) looks and sounds
like he's 15 and when we're hanging
out together you'll probably get
some snarky comment about you
dating some kid from high school.
(Be sure you're prepared to shoot
back a clever remark.) But once we
have sex and we'll only do it when
you're comfortable and I get your
consent we will have a very lively,
happy sex life. The testosterone will
make sure of it. Believe me, you'll
have something to brag about when
you meet up with your friends.
I'm also shorter than most men.
I'm five-foot-two but I don't con
sider myself short. Rather, I am fun
sized. If you like fun-sized candies,
then you will like fun-sized men. I'm
not one of those guys who get all in
secure about their heights and don't
let their girlfriends wear heels. Hell,
if you want to wear heels, you wear
those heels. They look hotter on you
anyway.
I promise I'll be good to you. I'm
someone who'll treat you well, who
will respect you, who will never try
anything physical with you unless I
get your consent. What matters the
most to me is that you're comfort
able and that we go at the pace that
works for you. We'll go ahead when
you're ready. And I know it's only
two short quarters away from gradu
ation but hey, having a little bit of
something that's good with an expi
ration date is a lot better than having
nothing at all. It'll be worth it. I'll
make sure it's worth it.
I'm a different flavor of man
different, yes, but worth a try. Just
think about it you get someone
with boyishly good looks who's small
enough to fit into your pocket. Now
who wouldn't want that?

Sincerely,
Cristopher Marc Soriano
Bautista
