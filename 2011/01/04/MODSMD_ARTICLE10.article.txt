## Mobile meals on four wheels 
### MOLLY K. VORWERCK 
Walking out of class in the
Quad or strolling near
Tresidder, you may have
caught an alluring, sump
tuous scent typically for
eign to those parts of campus. Upon fur
ther inspection you may have spotted a
truck, either non-descript or multi-col
ored, usually with a name strewn across

for instance, Bob's Tacos or The Taste-
Tester. Curious, you may have even ven
tured to its open, awning-covered side be
hind which a grill sizzles and busy cooks
bustle about to appease a line of hungry
patrons with their cuisine.
This unbeknownst gem on four wheels
is nothing less than a food truck, one of
many to have graced Stanford's campus in
recent years.

Food trucks have popped up all over
the country, even garnering enough atten
tion to warrant national competitions
itching to crown the next Food Truck
King. For instance, on The Food Net
work's new reality show "The Great Food
Truck Race," food trucks from across the
country compete to sell the most food to
patrons, with the champ winning $50,000
to help his or her business.
The show is a testament to the growing
popularity of food trucks of varying culi
nary specialties (Mexican, burgers, Asian
fusion and even creme brulee, to name a
few) from Los Angeles to New York, and
in many other cities in between. The Bay
Area, as well, is host to numerous food
trucks, many of which can be tracked on
Twitter or Facebook, and then reviewed
through Yelp.
Although food trucks and stands in
larger cities have been around for
decades, food trucks catering to more sub
urban areas and serving gourmet or
trendy items is a more recent novelty.
Those who frequent Union Square at
Tresidder Union for lunch might be famil
iar with NetAppetit, the Thai-Chinese fu
sion food truck that is parked on Santa
Teresa Street, just outside of the Humani
ties Center. According to a list of campus
cafes and restaurants provided by the
Physics Library, NetAppetit has a sister
location on West Campus Avenue, just
outside of the Medical Sciences Office
Building. NetAppetit, Stanford's only
consistently present (that is, open Monday
to Friday most weeks from 12 p.m. to 1:30
p.m.), four-wheeled eatery, is a non-profit
program that benefits refugee children
from Asia.

The trucks serve up buffet-style Asian

dishes, including pad thai, green and red
curry and sweet and sour chicken and
shrimp. Customers receive a Styrofoam
take-out box, enter the truck and allow a
chef to fill up their receptacles with what
ever dishes satisfy their fancies, from egg
rolls and curry to meat or vegetable
teriyaki.
After loading up, the hungry patrons
weigh their boxes on a scale, with prices
ranging from about $4.50 to $5.50, and
pick up either a water bottle or can of soda

at $0.50 a pop. While undergraduates, who
normally already have lunch included in
their meal plans through Stanford Dining,
have been known to grab a quick lunch at
NetAppetit, mainly graduate students,
faculty and staff are the regulars.
"The green and red curries are particu
larly good," said Ryan Jones, a master's
student.
"I like that there's a variety of things
you can sample without having to commit
to one flavor," Nick Valenzuela M.A. 'Bl
Ph.D. 'B5 said as he pointed out his fa
vorite items in his take-out box.
Pamela Martinez 'l3, a customer who
frequented the truck last year, was
pleased with both the cuisine and the staff
of the truck.
NetAppetit "is pretty good, and I real
ly like the food they serve. The service is
fast, and the owner is very nice and friend
ly," Martinez said. One time, she said, "a
friend of mine did not have any cash on
her, and the manager let her get the food
and pay the next day."
While NetAppetit is a more perma
nent food fixture on Stanford's campus,
other Bay Area trucks cater to staff or
construction workers nearby. For in
stance, in the Maples Parking lot, a Mexi
can food truck that sells the goods of a
nearby taqueria in Santa Clara caters to
those who are working on the buildings
across from Maples Pavilion. Though a bit
out of the way for students (it parks itself
behind the main parking lot, invisible to

students biking down Campus Drive), the
construction workers enjoy the manage
able prices and piping-hot tacos and que
sadillas as a means of refueling for the
next half of their work day.
However, Stanford students have
been able to encounter the food trucks
simply by stumbling upon them as op
posed to tracking them online, as many
patrons do.
Brian Chhor 'l2 was a frequent cus
tomer during his freshman year at both

NetAppetit and a Mexican food truck be
hind the chemistry building that makes its
rounds around the Engineering Building
and Medical School. Chhor extolled the
cheap prices and convenience of the food
trucks in lieu of eating at non-mobile
Stanford eateries like Union Square, the
Treehouse or the CoHo.

"They are generally a lot cheaper, so
you can get a large carton of food for
about a third of the price of a burrito from
the Treehouse or a [sandwich] from the
CoHo," Chhor said. "Depending on how
many of my classes overlapped with my
lunch period [per quarter], it ranged from
every day to every other day, to only once
or twice a month."

Chhor said he has had no bad experi
ences with the food he's consumed from
food trucks, but at the same time, it's no
gourmet meal.
"You get what you pay for in terms of
food quality, but overall, they do a good
job of making people happy," Chhor said.
Sam's Chowder House, a Half Moon
Bay staple for New England-style clam
chowder and other seafood dishes, has
jumped on the food truck bandwagon.
The restaurant's owners Paul and Julie
Shankman co-founded Sam's Chowder-
Mobile a year and a half ago. Although
Sam's Chowder Mobile has not vended on
Stanford's campus, it can often be spotted
at other various locations near or within
Palo Alto.
"We sell gourmet seafood, [including]

lobster rolls, fish and chips, fish tacos and
usually some meat items, like right now it's
a roast beef sandwich, something for the
non-seafood people to eat," said Julie
Shankman.

Despite the flexibility of using a food
truck, Shankman noted that there are var
ious hoops one must jump through in
order to be up and running in the first
place.
"You need to get a county health per
mit for each county you're going to be op
erating in, and then after your health per
mits, you get a business license from each
city," Juan Hurtado, the truck's driver,
said. "Every city is different. The permit
ting costs are different some of them
are very simple, some are a little in depth
but not too hectic."
While Sam's Chowder Mobile does not
have any plans to visit Stanford's campus
just yet, citing the desire to respect Stan
ford Dining's obligation to cater to its stu
dents and not take away business, their
chowder truck can be spotted all over the
Bay Area.
MoGo BBQ, another Bay Area food
truck that has been spotted near the Oval,
sells Mexican and Korean fusion food.
Dishes include Korean BBQ short rib
burritos or pork tacos, with all meats mar
inated in a family recipe marinade. The
truck also offers the vegetarian-friendly
option of replacing tofu with meat in any
of their food items, as well as the opportu
nity of adding kimchi to essentially any
dish to add an Asian flair.
Sam Pak, owner of the truck, is quick to
note that MoGo BBQ jumped into the
mobile meal game less than a year ago,
similarly to Sam's Chowder Mobile, in
order to capitalize on the growing food
truck trend.
Like Julie Shankman, Pak also believes
that food trucks sell food for cheaper than
their immobile culinary counterparts.
"I think we're a little bit cheaper
[since] we don't have the same overhead
as sit-down places," Pak said. "I think
overall quality-wise, it's very similar, too."
MoGo BBQ is only one of the growing
numbers of food trucks to visit Stanford's
campus and cater to students eager for a
convenient epicurean adventure just out
side class. As the trucks continue to gain
popularity and these mobile-meal vehi
cles become a more frequent occurrence
on campus, perhaps students, too, will
jump on the bandwagon and enjoy what
this culinary novelty has to offer Bob's
Tacos and beyond.

NetAppetit and a Mexican food truck be
hind the chemistry building that makes its
rounds around the Engineering Building
and Medical School. Chhor extolled the
cheap prices and convenience of the food
trucks in lieu of eating at non-mobile
Stanford eateries like Union Square, the
Treehouse or the CoHo.

"They are generally a lot cheaper, so
you can get a large carton of food for
about a third of the price of a burrito from
the Treehouse or a [sandwich] from the
CoHo," Chhor said. "Depending on how
many of my classes overlapped with my
lunch period [per quarter], it ranged from
every day to every other day, to only once
or twice a month."

Chhor said he has had no bad experi
ences with the food he's consumed from
food trucks, but at the same time, it's no
gourmet meal.
"You get what you pay for in terms of
food quality, but overall, they do a good
job of making people happy," Chhor said.
Sam's Chowder House, a Half Moon
Bay staple for New England-style clam
chowder and other seafood dishes, has
jumped on the food truck bandwagon.
The restaurant's owners Paul and Julie
Shankman co-founded Sam's Chowder-
Mobile a year and a half ago. Although
Sam's Chowder Mobile has not vended on
Stanford's campus, it can often be spotted
at other various locations near or within
Palo Alto.
"We sell gourmet seafood, [including]

lobster rolls, fish and chips, fish tacos and
usually some meat items, like right now it's
a roast beef sandwich, something for the
non-seafood people to eat," said Julie
Shankman.

Despite the flexibility of using a food
truck, Shankman noted that there are var
ious hoops one must jump through in
order to be up and running in the first
place.
"You need to get a county health per
mit for each county you're going to be op
erating in, and then after your health per
mits, you get a business license from each
city," Juan Hurtado, the truck's driver,
said. "Every city is different. The permit
ting costs are different some of them
are very simple, some are a little in depth
but not too hectic."
While Sam's Chowder Mobile does not
have any plans to visit Stanford's campus
just yet, citing the desire to respect Stan
ford Dining's obligation to cater to its stu
dents and not take away business, their
chowder truck can be spotted all over the
Bay Area.
MoGo BBQ, another Bay Area food
truck that has been spotted near the Oval,
sells Mexican and Korean fusion food.
Dishes include Korean BBQ short rib
burritos or pork tacos, with all meats mar
inated in a family recipe marinade. The
truck also offers the vegetarian-friendly
option of replacing tofu with meat in any
of their food items, as well as the opportu
nity of adding kimchi to essentially any
dish to add an Asian flair.
Sam Pak, owner of the truck, is quick to
note that MoGo BBQ jumped into the
mobile meal game less than a year ago,
similarly to Sam's Chowder Mobile, in
order to capitalize on the growing food
truck trend.
Like Julie Shankman, Pak also believes
that food trucks sell food for cheaper than
their immobile culinary counterparts.
"I think we're a little bit cheaper
[since] we don't have the same overhead
as sit-down places," Pak said. "I think
overall quality-wise, it's very similar, too."
MoGo BBQ is only one of the growing
numbers of food trucks to visit Stanford's
campus and cater to students eager for a
convenient epicurean adventure just out
side class. As the trucks continue to gain
popularity and these mobile-meal vehi
cles become a more frequent occurrence
on campus, perhaps students, too, will
jump on the bandwagon and enjoy what
this culinary novelty has to offer Bob's
Tacos and beyond.

The trucks serve up buffet-style Asian dishes,
including pad thai, green and red curry and
sweet and sour chicken and shrimp.

Walking out of class in the
Quad or strolling near
Tresidder, you may have
caught an alluring, sump
tuous scent typically for
eign to those parts of campus. Upon fur
ther inspection you may have spotted a
truck, either non-descript or multi-col
ored, usually with a name strewn across

for instance, Bob's Tacos or The Taste-
Tester. Curious, you may have even ven
tured to its open, awning-covered side be
hind which a grill sizzles and busy cooks
bustle about to appease a line of hungry
patrons with their cuisine.
This unbeknownst gem on four wheels
is nothing less than a food truck, one of
many to have graced Stanford's campus in
recent years.

Food trucks have popped up all over
the country, even garnering enough atten
tion to warrant national competitions
itching to crown the next Food Truck
King. For instance, on The Food Net
work's new reality show "The Great Food
Truck Race," food trucks from across the
country compete to sell the most food to
patrons, with the champ winning $50,000
to help his or her business.
The show is a testament to the growing
popularity of food trucks of varying culi
nary specialties (Mexican, burgers, Asian
fusion and even creme brulee, to name a
few) from Los Angeles to New York, and
in many other cities in between. The Bay
Area, as well, is host to numerous food
trucks, many of which can be tracked on
Twitter or Facebook, and then reviewed
through Yelp.
Although food trucks and stands in
larger cities have been around for
decades, food trucks catering to more sub
urban areas and serving gourmet or
trendy items is a more recent novelty.
Those who frequent Union Square at
Tresidder Union for lunch might be famil
iar with NetAppetit, the Thai-Chinese fu
sion food truck that is parked on Santa
Teresa Street, just outside of the Humani
ties Center. According to a list of campus
cafes and restaurants provided by the
Physics Library, NetAppetit has a sister
location on West Campus Avenue, just
outside of the Medical Sciences Office
Building. NetAppetit, Stanford's only
consistently present (that is, open Monday
to Friday most weeks from 12 p.m. to 1:30
p.m.), four-wheeled eatery, is a non-profit
program that benefits refugee children
from Asia.

The trucks serve up buffet-style Asian

dishes, including pad thai, green and red
curry and sweet and sour chicken and
shrimp. Customers receive a Styrofoam
take-out box, enter the truck and allow a
chef to fill up their receptacles with what
ever dishes satisfy their fancies, from egg
rolls and curry to meat or vegetable
teriyaki.
After loading up, the hungry patrons
weigh their boxes on a scale, with prices
ranging from about $4.50 to $5.50, and
pick up either a water bottle or can of soda

at $0.50 a pop. While undergraduates, who
normally already have lunch included in
their meal plans through Stanford Dining,
have been known to grab a quick lunch at
NetAppetit, mainly graduate students,
faculty and staff are the regulars.
"The green and red curries are particu
larly good," said Ryan Jones, a master's
student.
"I like that there's a variety of things
you can sample without having to commit
to one flavor," Nick Valenzuela M.A. 'Bl
Ph.D. 'B5 said as he pointed out his fa
vorite items in his take-out box.
Pamela Martinez 'l3, a customer who
frequented the truck last year, was
pleased with both the cuisine and the staff
of the truck.
NetAppetit "is pretty good, and I real
ly like the food they serve. The service is
fast, and the owner is very nice and friend
ly," Martinez said. One time, she said, "a
friend of mine did not have any cash on
her, and the manager let her get the food
and pay the next day."
While NetAppetit is a more perma
nent food fixture on Stanford's campus,
other Bay Area trucks cater to staff or
construction workers nearby. For in
stance, in the Maples Parking lot, a Mexi
can food truck that sells the goods of a
nearby taqueria in Santa Clara caters to
those who are working on the buildings
across from Maples Pavilion. Though a bit
out of the way for students (it parks itself
behind the main parking lot, invisible to

students biking down Campus Drive), the
construction workers enjoy the manage
able prices and piping-hot tacos and que
sadillas as a means of refueling for the
next half of their work day.
However, Stanford students have
been able to encounter the food trucks
simply by stumbling upon them as op
posed to tracking them online, as many
patrons do.
