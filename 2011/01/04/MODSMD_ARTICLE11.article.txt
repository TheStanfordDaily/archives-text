## CONTINUED Anatomy of a Winter Break 
### Jade Wang 
I've just realized that this past
one was my 18th winter break, if
we include kindergarten, and for
someone so bad at coloring inside
the lines as I am, let's go ahead and
count that one. The more recent
winter breaks have been character
ized primarily by binge sleeping and
a fair share of binge eating, too, but
even I can't snooze or eat cookies
all the time. I spend the rest of my
time puttering around with a level
of productivity that asymptotically
approaches zero. This continues
until I can once again look at myself
without shame, at which point I
promptly fall asleep again. Having
lazed through 18 winter breaks, I
feel quite qualified to attempt out
lining the structure of these indul
gent weeks:
Stage 1: Sleep, glorious sleep
Following the haze of finals and the
harrowingly long drive home, I give
my parents and sister cursory hellos
and then immediately collapse into
my childhood bed. It seems a little
short, since I've slept on an extra
long mattress for a while, and I'm
reasonably certain these sheets
haven't seen the laundry machine
since early September, but it does
n't matter. Nothing short of a seri
ous natural disaster (small to mod
erate earthquakes up for debate)
could separate me from this bed.
Luckily, my body forces me to wake
up in the middle of the night to eat,
lest I starve to death in my own lazi
ness, but otherwise, I am out of com
mission for about 12 hours.
Stage 2: Nervous pacing
When I am ready to once again
enter the world of the living, I al
ways inexplicably find myself wan
dering the house, distracting every
one from their tasks and generally
being too tense for the occasion. My
constant pestering for updates
about her life after two weeks of
radio silence irritates my sister. My
father appears not to notice, or is
more or less unaffected. My mother
teases me and says I need some
thing to do. I reluctantly agree and
either begin reading a Harry Potter
book or making a complicated
dessert.
Stage 3: Acclimation
After anywhere from 20 minutes to
a few hours of attempting a task,
everything suddenly clicks. I realize
I have been foolish and shed my
residual need to be, or at least ap
pear to be, marginally productive.
Sometimes I go back to sleep.
Sometimes I choose a television
show to marathon, and then spend
40 hours watching every episode in
existence. Sometimes I wander into
the pantry, lament the lack of junk
food in the house, and then go back
to sleep.
Stage 4: Haze
Arguably the best stage, I lose track
of time in my shameless lounging.
Changing out of pajamas seems a
lot to ask, and small tasks like laun
dry or grocery shopping seem be
yond me. I eat contraband saltines I
have hoarded in my room late at
night and watch hours of You Tube
videos. I read a truly horrifying

number of fantasy novels, or, some
what uncharacteristically, the Con
fessions of a Shopaholic series. I get
really good at Text Twist. I still lose
to my sister at every video game,
with the exception of DDR, which
she now refuses to play. Every night
I sleep for at least 10 hours.
Stage 5: Unease
One day, things just start to feel a lit
tle empty. The huge pile of clothing
on the chair suddenly is a little em
barrassing, and suddenly catching
up on House doesn't seem so ap
pealing. I try to appease this strange
sense of unease by organizing my
inbox or making my bed. It helps, a
little, but soon enough, the feeling is
back.
Stage 6: A project!
I come up with some ridiculous
project born of my unease. I will
learn to make clothing! I will start a
food blog! I will write a novel! I will
be a good and helpful daughter! The
beginning of this stage is euphoric,
as I imagine myself, productive, im
proved and happily engaged in my
project.
Stage 7: Reality
Here, the holidays hit me full force,
I realize I don't have the wealth of
time I thought I did, and I suddenly
find myself trucked all across town
to be festive and making awkward
conversation with my parents be
cause I felt guilty hiding in my
room. My project withers as the hol
iday frenzy uses up all the energy I
give it.
Stage 8: The end
It's always a surprise when I realize
I am headed back to Stanford the
next day. I say my goodbyes, only a
little nostalgic at this point, and
make the long trek back. Almost as
soon as I'm back, my normal life
takes over and doesn't let go. To be
honest, it's always kind of a relief.

Already pumped for spring break?

It's always a
surprise when
I realize I am
headed back to
Stanford...
