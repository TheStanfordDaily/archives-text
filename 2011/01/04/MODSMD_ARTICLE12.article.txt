Go Cardinal (I guess)

Dear Editor,
Kudos to the Stanford communi
ty for not supporting its successful
football team ("Plenty of empty
seats for best show in town; why
couldn't 11-1 team draw?" Tom
FitzGerald, San Francisco Chroni
cle, Dec. 12,2010).
To truly exercise leadership con
sistent with its role as one of the
finest universities in the nation,
Stanford would drop its Division
I/BCS intercollegiate football pro
gram.
The big money Division I
NCAA football program is a cyni
cal, financially corrupt and hypo
critical pageant of pathologically
unhealthy and obese 300-pounders
delivering serial concussions and
crippling injuries that linger for life
in a shameless minor league for the
NFL. The recent incident in which
several Ohio State football players
were suspended for the first five
games of next season for minor
NCAA-defined financial sins is a
good illustration of the corruption.
The players remained eligible for
the Jan. 4,2011 Sugar Bowl because
there is big BCS Bowl money in

volved. According to a report in the
Cleveland Plain Dealer, Sugar Bowl
CEO Paul Hoolahan admitted to
successfully pressuring officials to
keep the players eligible so as not to
interfere with raking in the millions
in cash, including Ohio State's big
cut.
Does Stanford really want to
continue to be a part of that world?
The time, money and energy de
voted to participation in that system
could instead be devoted to the le
gion of world-class Stanford stu
dent athletes, male and female, who
strive in the multitude of sports that
really exemplify the spirit and place
that college athletics should repre
sent, rather than to participation in
a spectacle worthy of the entertain
ments of the Roman Coliseum.
In the meantime I suggest that,
in the tradition of wry, knowing
humor best exemplified by Stan
ford's marching band, those who
just take plain old guilty pleasure in
attending the football games wear
togas to tip us off that they are
aware of what they are mixed up in.
Go Cardinal (I guess)!
