# GIRL YOU KNOW IT'S TRUE
## Tiger Woods for 2011 Commencement Speaker 
### Jordan Carr 
United Nations Secretary
General Dag Ham
marskjold. President Her
bert Hoover. Supreme Court Chief
Justice Earl Warren. Oprah. These
names are among the many power
players who have given commence
ment addresses to graduating sen
iors at Stanford.
And it is time to add one more
name to that list the most fa
mous, successful living Stanford
man: Eldrick Tont "Tiger" Woods.
Yes, there was that whole thing last
year when he slept with more
women than you can shake a golf
club at. But that, like most of his en
dorsements, is in the past. If you're
on the fence, here are a few reasons
why Tiger Woods is the right choice
for Stanford's 2011 commence
ment speaker.

1. He's the best at what he does

The objections to Tiger Woods
as commencement speaker are
many and obvious, but he offers
something that many speakers can
not. Who among our past com
mencement speakers can honestly
say they were the absolute best in
their field? Are you telling me that
Robert Pinsky was the best poet in
the world? I think W.S. Merwin
might want to have a word with
you. Was Garry Trudeau of
Doonesbury the world's funniest
cartoonist? Obviously these people
have never read Rex Morgan, M.D.
Tiger Woods, on the other hand,
was the world's greatest golfer for
nearly 12 years, and though he cur
rently sits in second place (curse
you, Lee Westwood), Woods will
surely regain his top spot as soon as
he starts dominating the golf world
again.

2. He's a Stanford man

In the past, it has been the case
that the standards have been a little
lower for letting Stanford gradu
ates speak at these things. Let's be
honest, here. Would Monroe E.
Spaght (me neither), have been al

lowed to give the 1966 commence
ment if he had gone to Texas
A&M? Well, guess what, people:
Tiger Woods is a product of Stan
ford University.
Though Tiger may not have
graduated, he bleeds Cardinal red.
He told a twitter follower that for
Christmas he wanted Stanford in
the national championship game,
and credited a good round to wear
ing a Stanford shirt. His last public
appearance before going into
Kaczynski-like hiding was at the
Big Game. And though his poster
may no longer hang in the Tree
house (which: seriously?), we re
main in his heart. Perhaps some of
his past indiscretions can be forgiv
en on account of his undying loyal
ty to Stanford.
This is all liable to change,
though, if it is revealed he was com
pleting his degree with that whore,
University of Phoenix.

3. Proper representation
For all the people who Stanford
has had speak at commencement,
not one of them has been affiliated
with sports in any way. Considering
how much pride Stanford takes in
its athletics, surely honoring its
greatest athlete ever (in your face,
Adam Keefe!) would go a long way
to embracing that heritage.
Compare Woods with 2001
speaker Carly Fiorina, the embat
tled Hewlett Packard CEO, and ask
what the latter offers that the for
mer does not. Lessons on hard
work? Tiger Woods took golf and
made it into a physical activity.
Overcoming discrimination? Tiger
Woods made his way in the lily
white world of professional golf,
where he had to tolerate racial
barbs from some dude named
Fuzzy. Overcoming hardships? You
know what's more embarrassing
than having a cavalcade of
hoochies claim to have slept with
you? Having them publicly release
your texts about golden showers.
Business acumen? Tiger Woods

made a billion dollars playing golf,
a sport nobody cares about, and
kept his wife's settlement to $llO
million, which, considering he was
pretty much completely at fault, is
not too bad.
4. Star appeal
Let's not pretend like we're
above bringing in a big name just
because of the attention it will at
tract. Oprah Winfrey hosts a talk
show that airs while people with
jobs are working. Tiger Woods
plays golf while people are napping
same thing, basically. There is
nobody nobody who would
bring the same amount of attention
to Stanford's 2011 commencement
that Tiger Woods would.
Tiger has a unique perspective
on things. He came to Stanford as a
golf phenom, left as a blossoming
superstar, rose to the top of his
field, which he dominated to an un
precedented degree, suffered a hu
miliating downfall and now is try
ing to claw his way back to the top.
I don't doubt that in time, Stanford
will once again welcome Tiger
Woods back. But why not now,
when he is at his most downtrod
den? We can show the world that
Stanford will stand by its man, even
when things are at their worst. I'm
pretty sure that's in the Fundamen
tal Standard somewhere.
So, do what you have to do to
make this happen. Write petitions.
Start a Facebook group. Those
things have to be good for some
thing.

United Nations Secretary
General Dag Ham
marskjold. President Her
bert Hoover. Supreme Court Chief
Justice Earl Warren. Oprah. These
names are among the many power
players who have given commence
ment addresses to graduating sen
iors at Stanford.
And it is time to add one more
name to that list the most fa
mous, successful living Stanford
man: Eldrick Tont "Tiger" Woods.
Yes, there was that whole thing last
year when he slept with more
women than you can shake a golf
club at. But that, like most of his en
dorsements, is in the past. If you're
on the fence, here are a few reasons
why Tiger Woods is the right choice
for Stanford's 2011 commence
ment speaker.

1. He's the best at what he does

The objections to Tiger Woods
as commencement speaker are
many and obvious, but he offers
something that many speakers can
not. Who among our past com
mencement speakers can honestly
say they were the absolute best in
their field? Are you telling me that
Robert Pinsky was the best poet in
the world? I think W.S. Merwin
might want to have a word with
you. Was Garry Trudeau of
Doonesbury the world's funniest
cartoonist? Obviously these people
have never read Rex Morgan, M.D.
Tiger Woods, on the other hand,
was the world's greatest golfer for
nearly 12 years, and though he cur
rently sits in second place (curse
you, Lee Westwood), Woods will
surely regain his top spot as soon as
he starts dominating the golf world
again.

2. He's a Stanford man

In the past, it has been the case
that the standards have been a little
lower for letting Stanford gradu
ates speak at these things. Let's be
honest, here. Would Monroe E.
Spaght (me neither), have been al

lowed to give the 1966 commence
ment if he had gone to Texas
A&M? Well, guess what, people:
Tiger Woods is a product of Stan
ford University.
Though Tiger may not have
graduated, he bleeds Cardinal red.
He told a twitter follower that for
Christmas he wanted Stanford in
the national championship game,
and credited a good round to wear
ing a Stanford shirt. His last public
appearance before going into
Kaczynski-like hiding was at the
Big Game. And though his poster
may no longer hang in the Tree
house (which: seriously?), we re
main in his heart. Perhaps some of
his past indiscretions can be forgiv
en on account of his undying loyal
ty to Stanford.
This is all liable to change,
though, if it is revealed he was com
pleting his degree with that whore,
University of Phoenix.

3. Proper representation
For all the people who Stanford
has had speak at commencement,
not one of them has been affiliated
with sports in any way. Considering
how much pride Stanford takes in
its athletics, surely honoring its
greatest athlete ever (in your face,
Adam Keefe!) would go a long way
to embracing that heritage.
Compare Woods with 2001
speaker Carly Fiorina, the embat
tled Hewlett Packard CEO, and ask
what the latter offers that the for
mer does not. Lessons on hard
work? Tiger Woods took golf and
made it into a physical activity.
Overcoming discrimination? Tiger
Woods made his way in the lily
white world of professional golf,
where he had to tolerate racial
barbs from some dude named
Fuzzy. Overcoming hardships? You
know what's more embarrassing
than having a cavalcade of
hoochies claim to have slept with
you? Having them publicly release
your texts about golden showers.
Business acumen? Tiger Woods

made a billion dollars playing golf,
a sport nobody cares about, and
kept his wife's settlement to $llO
million, which, considering he was
pretty much completely at fault, is
not too bad.
4. Star appeal
Let's not pretend like we're
above bringing in a big name just
because of the attention it will at
tract. Oprah Winfrey hosts a talk
show that airs while people with
jobs are working. Tiger Woods
plays golf while people are napping
same thing, basically. There is
nobody nobody who would
bring the same amount of attention
to Stanford's 2011 commencement
that Tiger Woods would.
Tiger has a unique perspective
on things. He came to Stanford as a
golf phenom, left as a blossoming
superstar, rose to the top of his
field, which he dominated to an un
precedented degree, suffered a hu
miliating downfall and now is try
ing to claw his way back to the top.
I don't doubt that in time, Stanford
will once again welcome Tiger
Woods back. But why not now,
when he is at his most downtrod
den? We can show the world that
Stanford will stand by its man, even
when things are at their worst. I'm
pretty sure that's in the Fundamen
tal Standard somewhere.
So, do what you have to do to
make this happen. Write petitions.
Start a Facebook group. Those
things have to be good for some
thing.
