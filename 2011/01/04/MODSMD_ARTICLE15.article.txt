## WOMEN'S BASKETBALL ROLLER COASTER RIDE 
### JACK BLANCHAT CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
While students were away from The Farm,
the Stanford women's basketball team had a
winter break that can best be described as a
roller coaster ride. The Cardinal entered the
December break a perfect 7-0, but the last
three weeks included perhaps the most chal
lenging slate of teams that Stanford will face
until the NCAA tournament. In two weeks
the Cardinal took on three teams ranked in
the top 10, including No. 1 ranked Connecti
cut, which hadn't lost a game in over two

years, and overcame the historic challenge of
grabbing Stanford head coach Tara Van-

Derveer's 800 th career win.
The break started with a game against
Fresno State at Maples Pavilion, which ended
in a 77-40 victory for the Card. The stellar sis
ters â€” junior Nnemkadi and freshman
Chiney Ogwumike combined for 35
points and spearheaded the win. Ogwumike
also contributed 13 rebounds for her first ca
reer double-double in a Cardinal uniform.
The victory was the 799 th career victory
for VanDerveer, and the Cardinal traveled to
Chicago to take on DePaul in another game
that was expected to be a sure win for Stan
ford.
Unfortunately, it couldn't have gone
worse for VanDerveer's squad.

The Cardinal was without senior forward
Kayla Pedersen, who was held out due to
concussion-like symptoms from a fall in the
win over Fresno State, and the Blue Demons
were 7 for 12 from three-point range in the
game. DePaul stormed out on a 17-2 run to
start the second half in a surprising 91-71
upset victory.

The road wouldn't get any easier for Stan
ford after DePaul, as the Cardinal had to
travel to Knoxville to battle a perennial pow
erhouse in No. 6 Tennessee. The Lady Vols
were hot off the blocks, hitting five of their
first seven three-pointers to open up a 14
point lead with 7:21 to play in the first half.
The Cardinal cut the lead to eight points

at the half, and Jeanette Pohlen and Nnemka
di Ogwumike took over the second period.
Pohlen scored 24 points and Ogwumike
recorded 20 of her own to rally the Cardinal
before a Meighan Simmons three-pointer
tied the game at 70 with 49 seconds to play.
The Cardinal failed to put up a last-second
shot, and the game headed to overtime.
Overtime proved to be a struggle when
Pohlen fouled out less than a minute into the
period. The Cardinal scored only two points,
and dropped its second consecutive game, 82-
72. The back-to-back losses were the first
time Stanford had dropped consecutive
