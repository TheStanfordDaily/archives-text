## WOMEN'S BASKETBALL ROLLER COASTER RIDE 
### JACK BLANCHAT CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
While students were away from The Farm,
the Stanford women's basketball team had a
winter break that can best be described as a
roller coaster ride. The Cardinal entered the
December break a perfect 7-0, but the last
three weeks included perhaps the most chal
lenging slate of teams that Stanford will face
until the NCAA tournament. In two weeks
the Cardinal took on three teams ranked in
the top 10, including No. 1 ranked Connecti
cut, which hadn't lost a game in over two

years, and overcame the historic challenge of
grabbing Stanford head coach Tara Van-

Derveer's 800 th career win.
The break started with a game against
Fresno State at Maples Pavilion, which ended
in a 77-40 victory for the Card. The stellar sis
ters â€” junior Nnemkadi and freshman
Chiney Ogwumike combined for 35
points and spearheaded the win. Ogwumike
also contributed 13 rebounds for her first ca
reer double-double in a Cardinal uniform.
The victory was the 799 th career victory
for VanDerveer, and the Cardinal traveled to
Chicago to take on DePaul in another game
that was expected to be a sure win for Stan
ford.
Unfortunately, it couldn't have gone
worse for VanDerveer's squad.

The Cardinal was without senior forward
Kayla Pedersen, who was held out due to
concussion-like symptoms from a fall in the
win over Fresno State, and the Blue Demons
were 7 for 12 from three-point range in the
game. DePaul stormed out on a 17-2 run to
start the second half in a surprising 91-71
upset victory.

The road wouldn't get any easier for Stan
ford after DePaul, as the Cardinal had to
travel to Knoxville to battle a perennial pow
erhouse in No. 6 Tennessee. The Lady Vols
were hot off the blocks, hitting five of their
first seven three-pointers to open up a 14
point lead with 7:21 to play in the first half.
The Cardinal cut the lead to eight points

at the half, and Jeanette Pohlen and Nnemka
di Ogwumike took over the second period.
Pohlen scored 24 points and Ogwumike
recorded 20 of her own to rally the Cardinal
before a Meighan Simmons three-pointer
tied the game at 70 with 49 seconds to play.
The Cardinal failed to put up a last-second
shot, and the game headed to overtime.
Overtime proved to be a struggle when
Pohlen fouled out less than a minute into the
period. The Cardinal scored only two points,
and dropped its second consecutive game, 82-
72. The back-to-back losses were the first
time Stanford had dropped consecutive
games since 2008.
The Cardinal then returned to
California, determined to avenge its
losses, and went back to its winning
ways at the University of San Fran
cisco. The Dons were outmatched
from the start they went only 5-
27 last season and the Cardinal
had the game all but wrapped up
after a 25-0 run put the team up 27
points at halftime. When the final
buzzer sounded, the Card had a 100-
45 victory, and VanDerveer had her
800 th career victory.

The 800-win club is an exclusive
group. Only six coaches have ever
reached that plateau in the
women's game: Tennessee's Pat
Summitt, former Texas coach Jody
Conradt, Rutgers' C. Vivian
Stringer, North Carolina's Sylvia
Hatchell, Division II Bentley's Bar
bara Stevens and VanDerveer.
Stanford returned home for the
first time in over two weeks and
welcomed dangerous company. The
No. 4 Xavier Musketeers came to
town first, a team that gave Stan
ford a scare last year. In the Elite
Eight of the NCAA tournament
last season, the Musketeers took
the Cardinal to the limit. Xavier
botched three straight layups be
fore Stanford came down with the
ball with five seconds left, and
Pohlen had a coast-to-coast layup

as time expired to give Stanford the
win.

This time wouldn't be as much of
a challenge. The Cardinal, led by
Nnemkadi Ogwumike's combined
23 points and 11 rebounds and
Pohlen's 19 points and nine re
bounds, thumped Xavier 89-52. The
star of the game, though, was the
Stanford defense, which held the
Musketeers to 30 percent shooting
and a miserable 11 percent from be
hind the arc.

Stanford hit its stride at the right
time undefeated UConn was
coming to town. Connecticut was
riding an NCAA record 90-game
winning streak that stretched back
two years, including two national
championships, led by Maya
Moore, the nation's defending play
er of the year.
Stanford, with a 51-game win
ning streak at home, welcomed the
Huskies to a sold-out Maples Pavil
ion for a nationally televised game.
The Cardinal played a tough, phys
ical game, and grabbed an early
lead on three-pointers from Pohlen
and junior guard Lindy La Rocque.
Again, the Stanford defense
stayed strong, and Chiney Ogwu
mike anchored a tough zone de
fense that held Moore in check.
Stanford came out with a 34-30 lead
at half, and maintained the lead
until there was 10:52 left to play.
After Moore made a three pointer
to cut the Stanford lead back to four
points, Pedersen and Pohlen hit
consecutive threes. A steal and
layup by Nnemkadi Ogwumike

then put the lead at 11.
UConn fought from behind to
close the gap back to six points with
2:19 left to play, but another layup
from Nnemkadi Ogwumike and six
Pohlen free throws, which added up
to a career-high 31 points for the
senior guard, put the game on ice.
Stanford took down UConn, 71-59,
in an upset victory for the ages.
UConn's 90-game win streak
started after the Huskies lost to
Stanford in the 2008 Final Four,
only to be broken by the Cardinal
almost three years later. The streak
is considered to be one of the most
impressive win totals in NCAA
sports history. Many sports pundits
compared the Huskies to the 1971-
1974 UCLA Bruins men's basket
ball team, which won 88 games in a
row.

In the new year, the Cardinal
showed no signs of slowing down by
opening its Pac-10 schedule with a
win over the archrival California
Golden Bears on Sunday in Berke
ley. Pohlen again led the way for
Stanford with 15 points as the Card
captured a 78-45 win.
The Cardinal's tough winter
break began with struggles. But the
team fought through adversity to
respond in a fashion indicative of a
championship-caliber team. The
team now heads into the thick of
the Pac-10 season, welcoming Ari
zona and Arizona State to Maples
Pavilion this weekend.
