## Dean discusses policies on paid speaking Follows investigation linking Stanford profs to drug companies 
### ELLORA ISRANI CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
An investigation by nonprofit news out
let ProPublica found in December that sev
eral faculty members at the Stanford School
of Medicine gave paid talks on behalf of drug
companies, violating University policy and
spurring the School of Medicine to decide
whether to take disciplinary action.
The investigation included a database by
ProPublica listing doctors who have accept
ed payments from any of several pharma
ceutical companies, the amounts of these
payments, and the companies that made
them.
Philip Pizzo, dean of the School of Medi
cine, condemned these violations in his
weekly newsletter to the Stanford medical
community.
"There have been a lot of prior communi
cations about the policies at Stanford and
many stories in the lay and medical press
about the problems associated with physi
cians serving in marketing roles," Pizzo
wrote. "This is unacceptable, certainly for
anyone with a Stanford title."
Stanford has cracked down on faculty-in
dustry contact. In October 2006, the Univer
sity implemented the Stanford Industry In
teractions Policy, which forbids faculty from
accepting gifts or compensation from indus
try and required them to disclose all finan
cial support they received for research or
other "continuing medical education." In
2009, Stanford banned its doctors from giv
ing paid promotional talks for any pharma
ceutical company.
Despite recent violations, Pizzo believes
the policy and its addenda have, for the most
part, been effective.
"While I would very much like 100 per
cent compliance at the outset, I am mindful
that it will take a little time to get there,"
Pizzo wrote in an e-mail to The Daily. "The
fact that over 1,200 faculty are compliant

and that we believe about four to
six have not been (out of entire fac
ulty group) is something to frame
positively ... going forward we do
very much expect full compliance
with the policies and I am opti
mistic that will happen."

ProPublica's online database
cites seven companies that made
payments to doctors: AstraZeneca,
Cephalon, Eli Lilly, GlaxoSmithK
lein, Johnson & Johnson, Merck
and Pfizer. The majority of infrac
tions stemmed from faculty receiv
ing "speakers' fees" monetary
compensation for speaking on be
half of a particular pharmaceutical
company.

According to Robert Malenka,
professor in psychiatry and behav
ioral sciences, the reaction within
his circle of colleagues to the poli
cies has been mixed.

"There's away of implementing
policies where you prevent inap
propriate influences of the pharma
ceutical industry on clinician deci
sion-making while still facilitating

other types of interactions which
benefit both academic research
centers and the long-term goal of
the pharmaceutical companies,
which is to make new and better
medications," Malenka said.

In his newsletter to the School of
Medicine, Pizzo also cited positive
interactions with the industry as in
tegral to the University's success
and credibility as a research institu
tion.

"It is time to reaffirm a commit
ment, individually and collectively,
to assuring the public trust in our
relations with industry," Pizzo
wrote. "We are eager to support
productive and valuable scientific
interactions with industry as long as
they do not involve marketing, are
fully disclosed and adhere to our
policies."

The School of Medicine will
strictly enforce the policy and its
addenda, Pizzo said.

"If true violations have oc
curred, we will pursue appropriate
disciplinary activity," Pizzo wrote in
his e-mail. "That process is under
way and something I can't com
ment on further at this time."
