## Dean discusses policies on paid speaking Follows investigation linking Stanford profs to drug companies 
### ELLORA ISRANI CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
An investigation by nonprofit news out
let ProPublica found in December that sev
eral faculty members at the Stanford School
of Medicine gave paid talks on behalf of drug
companies, violating University policy and
spurring the School of Medicine to decide
whether to take disciplinary action.
The investigation included a database by
ProPublica listing doctors who have accept
ed payments from any of several pharma
ceutical companies, the amounts of these
payments, and the companies that made
them.
Philip Pizzo, dean of the School of Medi
cine, condemned these violations in his
weekly newsletter to the Stanford medical
community.
"There have been a lot of prior communi
cations about the policies at Stanford and
many stories in the lay and medical press
about the problems associated with physi
cians serving in marketing roles," Pizzo
wrote. "This is unacceptable, certainly for
anyone with a Stanford title."
Stanford has cracked down on faculty-in
dustry contact. In October 2006, the Univer
sity implemented the Stanford Industry In
teractions Policy, which forbids faculty from
accepting gifts or compensation from indus
try and required them to disclose all finan
cial support they received for research or
other "continuing medical education." In
2009, Stanford banned its doctors from giv
ing paid promotional talks for any pharma
ceutical company.
Despite recent violations, Pizzo believes
the policy and its addenda have, for the most
part, been effective.
"While I would very much like 100 per
cent compliance at the outset, I am mindful
that it will take a little time to get there,"
Pizzo wrote in an e-mail to The Daily. "The
fact that over 1,200 faculty are compliant
