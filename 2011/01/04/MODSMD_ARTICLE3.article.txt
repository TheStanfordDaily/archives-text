# HISTORIC SEASON
## STANFORD TRIUMPHS IN ORANGE BOWL 
### KABIR SAWHNEY MANAGING EDITOR 
MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. The great
est season in Stanford football history is
complete.
Tlie Cardinal capped its historic run
with a 40-14 dismantling of No. 13 Virginia
Tech (11-3, 8-0 ACC) in last night's Dis
cover Orange Bowl in Miami Gardens,

Fla. No. 4 Stanford (12-1, 8-1 Pac-10) will
finish the season with the most wins in
program history, a far cry from its 1-11
record in 2006.

"Very few times in life does anybody get
a chance to be a champion at something
and be an Orange Bowl champion," Stan
ford head coach Jim Harbaugh said.
"That's going to down in the history of col
lege football. We started the season want-

ing to be champions."
Stanford won the game in the second
half, when it outplayed the Hokies on both
sides of the ball. Entering the locker room
at halftime, the score stood at 13-12 in favor
of Stanford, and the game looked destined
for a close finish. However, the Cardinal
began to pull away with its first drive of the

touchdown run from senior full
back/linebacker Owen Marecic, and
never looked back.

"The second half had a point ex
plosion," Harbaugh said. "There
were no mistakes from there on out,
from halftime until the end of the
game. Everybody was just on point
and executed extremely well."
"We just went back to the funda
mentals," said redshirt junior tight
end Coby Fleener. "We kept plug
ging away and we started to make
some plays."
The offensive highlight of Stan
ford's second half was a drive with
around six minutes left in the third
quarter. After junior safety Delano
Howell intercepted a pass from Vir
ginia Tech quarterback Tyrod Taylor
on the Stanford three-yard line,
Stanford's offense went 97 yards
down the field for a touchdown in
exactly two plays and 29 seconds.
Sophomore running back Stepfan
Taylor, the team's leading rusher,
broke a 56-yard run from the three
yard line on the drive's first play, and
redshirt sophomore quarterback
Luck threw a deep 41-yard bomb to
a wide-open Fleener in the center of
the field for a touchdown. The score
put Stanford up, 26-12, and put all
the momentum squarely on the Car
dinal sideline.
"I thought it was huge," Luck
said, speaking about the drive. "Any
time backed up in your own end
zone as an offense, you've got a little
bit of the hairs on the back of your
neck standing up because you know
how precarious that position can be.
And to go from one end zone to the
other end zone in two plays, it's
huge,"
Luck, who won the Orange Bowl
MVP award, finished with 287 yards
and four touchdowns on 18-of-23
passing. Fleener was by far his fa
vorite target for the game; Luck
found him for six receptions, 173
yards and three touchdown catches.
The tight ends as a unit were huge for
Stanford as they comprised three of
Luck's top five targets.
Stanford's running game was
also instrumental in winning the Or
ange Bowl. The Cardinal amassed
247 yards on the ground, including
118 yards from Stepfan Taylor and
another 99 yards from senior Jere
my Stewart, who had been sidelined
for much of the season by an injury
sustained in Stanford's opener. The

Cardinal offensive line opened up
big holes for its running backs, lead
ing to several long runs.
"I think the O-line plays with a lot
of pride," Luck said. "They sort of
kept at it, chipped away, kept grinding
and holes really started opening up."
As the offense rolled up points in
the second half, the defense did an
impressive job of containing Tyrod
Taylor, the ACC offensive player of
the year. Throughout the game, but
especially in the second half, the de
fense dominated the line of scrim
mage it seemed like Tyrod Taylor
had Cardinal blitzers in his face on
almost every play. Stanford success
fully limited his running ability, forc
ing him to scramble in the backfield
and make tough throws. For the
game, Stanford sacked Tyrod Taylor
eight times, including three from
sophomore linebacker Shayne
Skov.

"We knewTyrod would try to ex
tend plays with his legs so if guys
were missing [tackles] we knew guys
would have to be there to cover
him," Skov said. "We just had to

swarm to the ball and play well on
defense."
"We were trying to cage him in,
we really were," Harbaugh said.
"Sometimes it worked, sometimes it
didn't. He is such an elusive player."
Overall, Stanford limited the
Hokies to 288 offensive yards, in
cluding just 66 rushing yards. It also
forced Virginia Tech into eight
punts, compared to three from the
Cardinal.
For Virginia Tech, the loss
marked a disappointing end to the
season. The Hokies went undefeat
ed in the ACC after losing its first
two games of the season.
"It was frustrating," Tyrod Taylor
said. "But you've got to bounce back
and look forward. [Stanford] just
outplayed us in all parts of the game
today."
After the game, the conversation
turned to the future of Harbaugh
and Luck at Stanford. Harbaugh
could bolt the Farm in the coming
weeks for a more high profile coach
ing job, either with an NFL team or
at the University of Michigan, and
some analysts believe that his de
parture is imminent. Stanford has
indicated it offered Harbaugh a
raise from his current salary.
Meanwhile, Luck is eligible to
declare for the NFL Draft as a red
shirt sophomore, and is currently
projected as the No. 1 overall pick
by several scouting services, includ
ing ESPN.
Both declined to comment after
the game on whether or not they
plan to remain at Stanford for next
season.
"I don't mean to be rude, but I'd
rather not address that subject any
more," Luck said when asked a sim
ilar question later.
For now, Harbaugh, Luck and
the rest of the Stanford football
team will just savor this victory, and
reflect on what it means for the pro
gram.
"We're going to enjoy this mo
ment and these players that have re
ally created a bond, a brotherhood,"
Harbaugh said. "They really love to
play, they love to win, they love play
ing for each other. I think even more
so than they love playing the game,
they like playing for each other and
winning for each other."

Stanford won the game in the second
half, when it outplayed the Hokies on both
sides of the ball. Entering the locker room
at halftime, the score stood at 13-12 in favor
of Stanford, and the game looked destined
for a close finish. However, the Cardinal
began to pull away with its first drive of the

Redshirt sophomore quarterback Andrew Luck (12) won the Orange Bowl MVP award on Monday.
touchdown run from senior full
back/linebacker Owen Marecic, and
never looked back.

"The second half had a point ex
plosion," Harbaugh said. "There
were no mistakes from there on out,
from halftime until the end of the
game. Everybody was just on point
and executed extremely well."
"We just went back to the funda
mentals," said redshirt junior tight
end Coby Fleener. "We kept plug
ging away and we started to make
some plays."
The offensive highlight of Stan
ford's second half was a drive with
around six minutes left in the third
quarter. After junior safety Delano
Howell intercepted a pass from Vir
ginia Tech quarterback Tyrod Taylor
on the Stanford three-yard line,
Stanford's offense went 97 yards
down the field for a touchdown in
exactly two plays and 29 seconds.
Sophomore running back Stepfan
Taylor, the team's leading rusher,
broke a 56-yard run from the three
yard line on the drive's first play, and
redshirt sophomore quarterback
Luck threw a deep 41-yard bomb to
a wide-open Fleener in the center of
the field for a touchdown. The score
put Stanford up, 26-12, and put all
the momentum squarely on the Car
dinal sideline.
"I thought it was huge," Luck
said, speaking about the drive. "Any
time backed up in your own end
zone as an offense, you've got a little
bit of the hairs on the back of your
neck standing up because you know
how precarious that position can be.
And to go from one end zone to the
other end zone in two plays, it's
huge,"
Luck, who won the Orange Bowl
MVP award, finished with 287 yards
and four touchdowns on 18-of-23
passing. Fleener was by far his fa
vorite target for the game; Luck
found him for six receptions, 173
yards and three touchdown catches.
The tight ends as a unit were huge for
Stanford as they comprised three of
Luck's top five targets.
Stanford's running game was
also instrumental in winning the Or
ange Bowl. The Cardinal amassed
247 yards on the ground, including
118 yards from Stepfan Taylor and
another 99 yards from senior Jere
my Stewart, who had been sidelined
for much of the season by an injury
sustained in Stanford's opener. The

Cardinal offensive line opened up
big holes for its running backs, lead
ing to several long runs.
"I think the O-line plays with a lot
of pride," Luck said. "They sort of
kept at it, chipped away, kept grinding
and holes really started opening up."
As the offense rolled up points in
the second half, the defense did an
impressive job of containing Tyrod
Taylor, the ACC offensive player of
the year. Throughout the game, but
especially in the second half, the de
fense dominated the line of scrim
mage it seemed like Tyrod Taylor
had Cardinal blitzers in his face on
almost every play. Stanford success
fully limited his running ability, forc
ing him to scramble in the backfield
and make tough throws. For the
game, Stanford sacked Tyrod Taylor
eight times, including three from
sophomore linebacker Shayne
Skov.

"We knewTyrod would try to ex
tend plays with his legs so if guys
were missing [tackles] we knew guys
would have to be there to cover
him," Skov said. "We just had to

swarm to the ball and play well on
defense."
"We were trying to cage him in,
we really were," Harbaugh said.
"Sometimes it worked, sometimes it
didn't. He is such an elusive player."
Overall, Stanford limited the
Hokies to 288 offensive yards, in
cluding just 66 rushing yards. It also
forced Virginia Tech into eight
punts, compared to three from the
Cardinal.
For Virginia Tech, the loss
marked a disappointing end to the
season. The Hokies went undefeat
ed in the ACC after losing its first
two games of the season.
"It was frustrating," Tyrod Taylor
said. "But you've got to bounce back
and look forward. [Stanford] just
outplayed us in all parts of the game
today."
After the game, the conversation
turned to the future of Harbaugh
and Luck at Stanford. Harbaugh
could bolt the Farm in the coming
weeks for a more high profile coach
ing job, either with an NFL team or
at the University of Michigan, and
some analysts believe that his de
parture is imminent. Stanford has
indicated it offered Harbaugh a
raise from his current salary.
Meanwhile, Luck is eligible to
declare for the NFL Draft as a red
shirt sophomore, and is currently
projected as the No. 1 overall pick
by several scouting services, includ
ing ESPN.
Both declined to comment after
the game on whether or not they
plan to remain at Stanford for next
season.
"I don't mean to be rude, but I'd
rather not address that subject any
more," Luck said when asked a sim
ilar question later.
For now, Harbaugh, Luck and
the rest of the Stanford football
team will just savor this victory, and
reflect on what it means for the pro
gram.
"We're going to enjoy this mo
ment and these players that have re
ally created a bond, a brotherhood,"
Harbaugh said. "They really love to
play, they love to win, they love play
ing for each other. I think even more
so than they love playing the game,
they like playing for each other and
winning for each other."
