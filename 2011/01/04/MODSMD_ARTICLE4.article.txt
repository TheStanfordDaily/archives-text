# Fields of Failure
## Just savor the moment 
### Jacob Jaffe 
Sometimes sports hurt. Sometimes
sports envelope your life with pain
and isolation that nothing can cure.
Sometimes being a sports fan phys
ically and emotionally bombards
your body and soul with unimaginable agony.
Sometimes you might even question if sports
are worth watching because of the effect they
can have on you.
And then there's right now.
Right now, the world is perfect. Everlast
ing peace is upon us. Poverty has been elimi
nated forever. Bloods and Crips are forget
ting their differences and joining hands in
song. The One Ring, the Death Star and all of
Voldemort's Horcruxes have been de
stroyed. Stanford football is 12-1 after a deci
sive, thorough and historic beatdown of Vir
ginia Tech in the Orange Bowl.
So maybe the first few aren't true, but it's
hard to imagine any of them making me any
happier than the last one is making me right
now.
Stanford led 13-12 after a bizarre first half,
but the result was very much in doubt. Miami
was intently anticipating the second half, ig
noring the flashing lights and feeble pump-up

Stanford sacked Tyrod Taylor eight times on Monday, including three from sophomore
linebacker Shayne Skov.
efforts of the halftime show, and
questions about the quality of An
drew Luck, Jim Harbaugh and the
entire Stanford program swirled
around media outlets and worrying
fans' minds.
Then the Cardinal came out of
the tunnel for the second half, and it
was over. Everything worked.
Every play call was perfect, every
arm tackle was broken, every pass
was on target, every blitz was effec
tive. (Ok, so Nate Whitaker missed
another extra point. But let's not
forget that he still outscored the en
tire Virginia Tech team in the sec
ond half. So he can have that little
blemish.)
Andrew Luck was simply mas
terful, a true pleasure to behold.
Three plays into Stanford's first
drive of the second half, Luck was
10-15 for 92 yards with one touch
down and one interception. He did
n't throw another incompletion,
connecting on all eight of his re
maining passes for 195 more yards
and three touchdowns. Unbeliev
able.
The defense was disgustingly
good, stifling every Virginia Tech
drive and battering its offense into
a pulp. Delano Howell looked like
Troy Polamalu and a 25-year-old
Jim Edmonds morphed into one.
Shayne Skov finally got a real es
tate license after setting up shop in
the Hokies' backfield. Vic Fangio
had to turn down offers to lead sev
eral European nations. As a team,
the Cardinal had more sacks than
Minnesota had all season (no, seri
ously).
Coby Fleener set an Orange
Bowl receiving record. Jeremy
Stewart almost tripled his season
rushing total on one carry. Heck,
James McGillicuddy had as many
rushing yards as Ryan Williams and
David Wilson combined.
Are you smiling yet? Beaming

with glee? Running around hugging
random strangers? All right, maybe
that's just me.
But if you were watching the
game, if you've been watching this
team all season and certainly if you
were among the cheering hordes at
Sun Life Stadium, you know what I
mean.
This season has been unreal.
From a road shutout in the Rose
Bowl through Marecic's consecu
tive touchdowns through Whitak
er's game-winning field goal
through the Big Game shellacking
(how does the grass taste, Sean Cat
touse?) through a thorough de
struction of Oregon State on Senior
Day, the 2010 season has felt too
good to be true. Last night, the feel
ing became overwhelming.
I'm not normally the most cheer
ful person you'll ever meet, but right
now my smile is bigger than Stan
ford's offensive line. The emotions
running through my body as Stan
ford had its way with Virginia Tech
on both sides of the ball and the
crowd's calls of "Go Stanford"
echoed around Sun Life Stadium
could probably power South Beach
for the next 20 years.
Much has and will be written
about this season and about the fu
ture. Far too many people will spec
ulate (with or without valid opin
ions or reasoning) about the fates of
Harbaugh and Luck. And while the
future of Stanford football is more
important to me than almost any
thing, for this short period of time, I
honestly don't care. As both coach
and player said, let's savor this game
and worry about that stuff later.
So please, do as our glorious
leaders have said. Take a moment
and forget about all that other stuff.
Classes, homework, exams, applica
tions, girl problems, boy problems,
work, drama, taxes, bills, pollution,
roommates, politics, war ... all that
can wait.
Because right now, life is perfect.
