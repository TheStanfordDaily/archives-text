# Fields of Failure
## Just savor the moment 
### Jacob Jaffe 
Sometimes sports hurt. Sometimes
sports envelope your life with pain
and isolation that nothing can cure.
Sometimes being a sports fan phys
ically and emotionally bombards
your body and soul with unimaginable agony.
Sometimes you might even question if sports
are worth watching because of the effect they
can have on you.
And then there's right now.
Right now, the world is perfect. Everlast
ing peace is upon us. Poverty has been elimi
nated forever. Bloods and Crips are forget
ting their differences and joining hands in
song. The One Ring, the Death Star and all of
Voldemort's Horcruxes have been de
stroyed. Stanford football is 12-1 after a deci
sive, thorough and historic beatdown of Vir
ginia Tech in the Orange Bowl.
So maybe the first few aren't true, but it's
hard to imagine any of them making me any
happier than the last one is making me right
now.
Stanford led 13-12 after a bizarre first half,
but the result was very much in doubt. Miami
was intently anticipating the second half, ig
noring the flashing lights and feeble pump-up
