### JOSHUA FALK DESK EDITOR 
Graduate student researcher
Rune Nielsen, 25, was killed in a
car accident early on Dec. 18 at
Middlefield Road and Hawthorne
Avenue in Palo Alto.

Nielsen, originally from Copen
hagen, Denmark, was conducting
nanotechnology research in the
Stanford Microsystems Laborato
ry under the tutelage of associate
professor Beth Pruitt in the me
chanical engineering department.
His project was entitled "Passiva
tion for Piezoresistive Can
tilevers."

When Nielsen first arrived at
Stanford, he participated in the

home-stay program run by the
Community Committee for Inter
national Studies.
"He was just a great, generous,
kind person," said Karen McNay,
chair of the program. "He was gre
garious and outgoing and made
friends very easily."
"We grew to be very fond of this
wonderful young man," said
Donna Shoemaker, who picked
Nielsen up at the airport when he
arrived in California and hosted
him for two weeks. "He was just an
exceptional young man who we
stayed very close to while he was
here."
Nielsen had a particular interest
in entrepreneurship and thought
that academic disciplines didn't
communicate well enough, Shoe
maker said. He was interested in
the intersection of engineering and
business.
Nielsen's funeral will be held in

Hadsten, Denmark, on Jan. 8, ac
cording to Shoemaker. Arrange
ments for a memorial service on
campus are pending.
