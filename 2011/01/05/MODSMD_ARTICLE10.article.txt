## LOOKING UP Beginnings, Endings and Reality Checks 
### Nina Chung 
I'm a sucker for new beginnings.
It's an affection that has re
vealed itself in various ways: all
of my diaries since third grade have
highly exclamatory first entries, I
restarted the Pokemon Game Boy
games dozens of times and finished
zero and I've been faithful to the
tradition of writing New Year's res
olutions since I can remember. I al
ways saw perfection in future po
tential.

Somehow, though, I simultane
ously developed a raging intoler
ance for The End. The phrase "I'm
bad at endings" became a repeat
resident on the tip of my tongue
around birthdays and the anxious
ends of school years. Perhaps be
cause I've become so deeply invest
ed in present experiences and in the
people I care about around me
(which also means a bad habit of ne
glecting important e-mails during
vacations), partings are always se
vere. And I actually imagine a 5-
year-old Nina still out in the world,
living out a scene from a well
known photograph taken in a coun
try I feel was left too unexpectedly.
I have stores of memories of major
ly tearful farewells to family in
Korea or family in California. You
see? No goodbye I ever made was a
trivial or clear-cut matter.
I suppose my love of beginnings
and my reaction to endings are at
heart one and the same: I'm really
conscious of discontinuity. It ex
plains my emphasis on proper
goodbyes and my enthusiasm for
Day Ones. If something was chang
ing, I had to address it by either big,
fat tears or big, shiny proclamations.
They had to be big big enough to
acknowledge the important and
ambiguous possibilities in change.
It was only recently, however,
sometime last week, that I revisited
this ... little perspective of mine. It
was when the words "New Year's
resolutions" began their annual en
trances into the conversations
around me; I noticed, unexpectedly,
a bit of scuff on the pedestal of the
words. I thought a bit longer and
harder on the general life-cycle of
most resolutions: sudden dramatic
births, then mid-life crises, then
quiet resignations. But why? Be
cause one-day demolitions of life
long habits usually fail. Because our
lives aren't montage sequences or
sharply-cut collages. Because some
things in our life may change drasti
cally, but not all of them can.
And unexpectedly, that is all
very reassuring.
Thus, my train of thought turned
an avenue: I considered with fur
rowed brow how my freak-outs
were also a severe disregard for pil
lars of my life that had so thankful
ly stuck around. Like safety and se
curity and never truly needing a
thing. I suddenly understood how
dangerous it was that I so easily for
got these privileges and was instead
constantly feeling crises. In my ruts

of overreaction, I forgot the bless
ings of my family's constant love or
my friends' loyalty truths that
wouldn't be erased by brief spells of
separation. Relatedly, as I thought
of my past New Year's attempts to
destroy fatal personality flaws, I re
alized I never wrote a resolution to
keep an aspect of myself that I liked.
In both ways, I so often ignored the
long-term parts of my life that I
should have appreciated; I rather
easily exchanged them for
(over)doses of drama.
Okay, I just thought of a resolu
tion perhaps the only one going
in my diary this year: keep check on
reality/avoid going overboard. Not
bad, huh? It's definitely a unique
step for me. Especially because as
this year progresses, I find myself
growing particularly nervous about
The End of college, The End of ca
reer-free thinking and all of that
stuff. But The End of the World
won't come from those things
(though I do graduate in 2012! Uh
oh?), and emotional explosions
waste energy. I'm quite positive that
just as before, I can look forward to
another cornucopia year of adven
tures, even if they don't all seem
fabulous at first glance. Just being
here again is a bullet on that list of
realities we all can be grateful for.
Yes, times come, times go and times
change in super important ways.
But between the episodes, it's good
to remember how certain great
parts of our lives have stayed reli
ably the same ... and no fondness
for the melodramatic can shake
that.

One wonderful, certain thing that
hasn't changed is your way to reach
Nina whenever you wish, at ni
namc@stanford.edu. And, after all,
she still sends you her best New Year
greetings!

I developed a
raging
intolerance for
The End.

of my past New Year's attempts to
destroy fatal personality flaws, I re
alized I never wrote a resolution to
keep an aspect of myself that I liked.
In both ways, I so often ignored the
long-term parts of my life that I
should have appreciated; I rather
easily exchanged them for
(over)doses of drama.
Okay, I just thought of a resolu
tion perhaps the only one going
in my diary this year: keep check on
reality/avoid going overboard. Not
bad, huh? It's definitely a unique
step for me. Especially because as
this year progresses, I find myself
growing particularly nervous about
The End of college, The End of ca
reer-free thinking and all of that
stuff. But The End of the World
won't come from those things
(though I do graduate in 2012! Uh
oh?), and emotional explosions
waste energy. I'm quite positive that
just as before, I can look forward to
another cornucopia year of adven
tures, even if they don't all seem
fabulous at first glance. Just being
here again is a bullet on that list of
realities we all can be grateful for.
Yes, times come, times go and times
change in super important ways.
But between the episodes, it's good
to remember how certain great
parts of our lives have stayed reli
ably the same ... and no fondness
for the melodramatic can shake
that.

One wonderful, certain thing that
hasn't changed is your way to reach
Nina whenever you wish, at ni
namc@stanford.edu. And, after all,
she still sends you her best New Year
greetings!

I developed a
raging
intolerance for
The End.
