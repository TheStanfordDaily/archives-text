# THIS COLUMN SENT FROM MY IPHONE
## The 						Death of All Idealism

By far my favorite part of "The
Social Network" was the line
"And Stanford. It's time for
them to see this in Palo Alto." The
Facebook was great and all, but if
Zuckerberg wanted to make it big,
he had to go to California, just like
the gold rushers and aspiring movie
stars before him. Once again, Holly
wood reclaims its position as the
destination for excitement and
dreams, a reclamation that unfortu
nately becomes writer Aaron
Sorkin's biggest source of uninten
tional comedy in the movie.
Either Sorkin didn't do his re
search, or he just didn't care, be
cause I found it quite incongruous
to see the most boring college town
in the world represented as our
hero's Island of Circe. There's prob
ably a reason that most of those
scenes take place inside the house.
And Stanford, which is home only
to model-thin coeds who all can af
ford apartments in Palo Alto and
crazy coked-out sorority parties.
Just where exactly Sean Parker
went on campus to have said parties
that proved so alluring to ruddy
young Zuckerberg escapes me. Cer
tainly not the Cowell Cluster; I'm
pretty sure there hasn't been an all
campus sorority party over there to
date.
All nitpicking aside though,
Sorkin's characterization gratifies
me. Even if I am four years late to
the party, I'm still finally at the place
to be. Even after all my requisite
collegiate disillusionment, I still get
jazzed to discover that Steve Jobs
and Eric Schmidt had lunch over at
Town and Country or that Mark
Zuckerberg goes to the Nuthouse.
I've been to those places! More
over, the South Bay held enough in
trigue to prompt the founding of
Valleywag, America's first Silicon
Valley gossip blog. They could be
talking about people I know!
Though if you desire the real
story, just ask the one of the many
'O5 alums making their way back on
campus this weekend. They entered

college in 2001 and so are perhaps
the best witnesses to the transfor
mative power that Facebook held
over us college students. That was
back when Facebook was, ahem,
still discovering its identity. People
would actually list their favorite
movies; you could still indicate that
you were interested in Random
Play and Whatever I Can Get in
stead of just Friendship and Net
working, and people had no qualms
posting all their compromising pho
tos. If Inlovewith McFlottie was at
tending Generic Party, you could
count on them to be there, damn it.
The lascivious dissolution of the
public/private sphere, all behind the
safety of the Internet, was precisely
the seduction, as movie Zuckerberg
freely admitted. That was the Face
book of the man whose business
card said, "I'm the CEO, bitch."
My second favorite part of "The
Social Network" was JT's speech to
movie Zuckerberg right before he
goes into a business meeting in his
pajamas to curse them out. Hard
wired into many a brain, including
mine, is an inherent contempt for
traditional authority and corporate
culture, which provides the fuel for
the romance of the tech scene with
their company-wide excursions to
Burning Man and permission of
cargo shorts at board meetings. It
would just be so cool to work there,
though admittedly not cool enough
for me to actually take any CS class
es. What I love even more, though,
is that this unique culture is a direct
product of Stanford, the place al
ways looking forward. Armed with
only your mind and an ability to
function without sleep, you can cre
ate multi-billion dollar corporate
empires without ever having to buy
a suit or practice your golf game.
Facebook and Google are ap
proaching dullness by the second
(the delightful awkwardness of the
poke is pretty much extinct), but if
they're the faces of our new corpo
rate overlords, I'm OK with that, as
long Zucky-boy keeps doing all his
presentations in pullover fleece.
But before I finish my apotheo
sis of all things Facebook, I should

take a step back to remind you all
that my lowly old English depart
ment produced some American vi
sionaries as well. John Steinbeck,
Ken Kesey you may have heard
of them. They're the embodiment of
what Stanford's revolutionary spirit
used to represent before CS ran this
town: a collection of the brightest
young minds in the country, given
unparalleled academic freedom,
working to take down the wasteful
systems holding America back from
achieving its true potential, not just
creating new ones that have a more
seamless integration with your
smart phone. "The Social Network"
doesn't really have an ending, but
Sorkin insinuates through JT that
the arc of the start-up firm bends to
ward hubris. In 30 years, don't be
surprised if the next great American
hero has to leave the stuffy technoc
racy of Palo Alto in order to realize
his dream.

Got the next idea to change America?

go to California.

Editors note: This column originally

By far my favorite part of "The
Social Network" was the line
"And Stanford. It's time for
them to see this in Palo Alto." The
Facebook was great and all, but if
Zuckerberg wanted to make it big,
he had to go to California, just like
the gold rushers and aspiring movie
stars before him. Once again, Holly
wood reclaims its position as the
destination for excitement and
dreams, a reclamation that unfortu
nately becomes writer Aaron
Sorkin's biggest source of uninten
tional comedy in the movie.
Either Sorkin didn't do his re
search, or he just didn't care, be
cause I found it quite incongruous
to see the most boring college town
in the world represented as our
hero's Island of Circe. There's prob
ably a reason that most of those
scenes take place inside the house.
And Stanford, which is home only
to model-thin coeds who all can af
ford apartments in Palo Alto and
crazy coked-out sorority parties.
Just where exactly Sean Parker
went on campus to have said parties
that proved so alluring to ruddy
young Zuckerberg escapes me. Cer
tainly not the Cowell Cluster; I'm
pretty sure there hasn't been an all
campus sorority party over there to
date.
All nitpicking aside though,
Sorkin's characterization gratifies
me. Even if I am four years late to
the party, I'm still finally at the place
to be. Even after all my requisite
collegiate disillusionment, I still get
jazzed to discover that Steve Jobs
and Eric Schmidt had lunch over at
Town and Country or that Mark
Zuckerberg goes to the Nuthouse.
I've been to those places! More
over, the South Bay held enough in
trigue to prompt the founding of
Valleywag, America's first Silicon
Valley gossip blog. They could be
talking about people I know!
Though if you desire the real
story, just ask the one of the many
'O5 alums making their way back on
campus this weekend. They entered

college in 2001 and so are perhaps
the best witnesses to the transfor
mative power that Facebook held
over us college students. That was
back when Facebook was, ahem,
still discovering its identity. People
would actually list their favorite
movies; you could still indicate that
you were interested in Random
Play and Whatever I Can Get in
stead of just Friendship and Net
working, and people had no qualms
posting all their compromising pho
tos. If Inlovewith McFlottie was at
tending Generic Party, you could
count on them to be there, damn it.
The lascivious dissolution of the
public/private sphere, all behind the
safety of the Internet, was precisely
the seduction, as movie Zuckerberg
freely admitted. That was the Face
book of the man whose business
card said, "I'm the CEO, bitch."
My second favorite part of "The
Social Network" was JT's speech to
movie Zuckerberg right before he
goes into a business meeting in his
pajamas to curse them out. Hard
wired into many a brain, including
mine, is an inherent contempt for
traditional authority and corporate
culture, which provides the fuel for
the romance of the tech scene with
their company-wide excursions to
Burning Man and permission of
cargo shorts at board meetings. It
would just be so cool to work there,
though admittedly not cool enough
for me to actually take any CS class
es. What I love even more, though,
is that this unique culture is a direct
product of Stanford, the place al
ways looking forward. Armed with
only your mind and an ability to
function without sleep, you can cre
ate multi-billion dollar corporate
empires without ever having to buy
a suit or practice your golf game.
Facebook and Google are ap
proaching dullness by the second
(the delightful awkwardness of the
poke is pretty much extinct), but if
they're the faces of our new corpo
rate overlords, I'm OK with that, as
long Zucky-boy keeps doing all his
presentations in pullover fleece.
But before I finish my apotheo
sis of all things Facebook, I should

take a step back to remind you all
that my lowly old English depart
ment produced some American vi
sionaries as well. John Steinbeck,
Ken Kesey you may have heard
of them. They're the embodiment of
what Stanford's revolutionary spirit
used to represent before CS ran this
town: a collection of the brightest
young minds in the country, given
unparalleled academic freedom,
working to take down the wasteful
systems holding America back from
achieving its true potential, not just
creating new ones that have a more
seamless integration with your
smart phone. "The Social Network"
doesn't really have an ending, but
Sorkin insinuates through JT that
the arc of the start-up firm bends to
ward hubris. In 30 years, don't be
surprised if the next great American
hero has to leave the stuffy technoc
racy of Palo Alto in order to realize
his dream.
