## MEN'S BASKETBALL Young squad tested over winter break Card dominant at home, shaky in tough road matchups 
### CAROLINE CASELLI DESK EDITOR 
Before deftly handling visiting California in
its first Pac-10 matchup of the season on Sun
day, the Stanford men's basketball team had
little time to relax during the holiday break,
with five non-conference games in just over
two weeks.The Card experienced early success
and remains undefeated at Maples Pavilion,
with wins over UC-Riverside, North Carolina
A&T and Yale, but it continues to struggle on
the road, falling in consecutive contests to But
ler and Oklahoma State, its toughest non-con
ference opponents of the year.
On Sunday, Dec, 12, the Card never trailed
against visiting Riverside, jumping out to a
quick 7-0 lead that it maintained. Stanford won
the game, 55-48.
Junior guard Jeremy Green, who gave fans
a scare when he collapsed from exhaustion
after the final game of the 76 Classic, started off
slowly, but he came back with a vengeance to
score all of his game-leading 22 points in the
second half.
"At halftime, I went back and thought
about why I was missing so much," he said. "I
wanted to let the game come to me instead of
forcing it. I concentrated more on making
shots and I settled in."
The Cardinal dominated the boards, out-re
bounding the Highlanders by a 43-27 margin.
Redshirt junior big man Josh Owens led the
team his 10 rebounds and 14 points notched
him his first career double-double.
Several days later, still on the Farm, Stan
ford dominated North Carolina A&T, winning
76-59. After trailing by as many as seven in the
first half, the Card turned around to lead by 20
points in the game's final minutes.Twelve play
ers saw minutes, with key contributions again
coming from captains Green and Owens, with
18 and 15 points, respectively. North Carolina
A&T junior guard Nic Simpson led the night
with 20 points on 8-for-15 shooting.
"J.O. is finding himself," said Stanford head
coach Johnny Dawkins of Owens, who sat out
all of last season. "Every game you see him get
ting better and better."
Owens is refocused and driven after his
year off, as evidenced by his continued im
provement on the court.
"When you're away from the game for a
year, you appreciate it a lot more," he said. "It's
definitely a different mindset, and I think that's
been the biggest difference."
However, road games continued to be diffi
cult for Stanford's young squad, which fell de
cisively to Butler, last year's national runner
up, and to Oklahoma State, which it faced in
the Pac-10/Big 12 Hardwood Series.
Playing on Dec. 18 in Indianapolis, Butler
took control early, with a 10-point lead halfway
through the first period; the Bulldogs stretched
