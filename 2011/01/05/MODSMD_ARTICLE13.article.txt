## MEN'S BASKETBALL Young squad tested over winter break Card dominant at home, shaky in tough road matchups 
### CAROLINE CASELLI DESK EDITOR 
Before deftly handling visiting California in
its first Pac-10 matchup of the season on Sun
day, the Stanford men's basketball team had
little time to relax during the holiday break,
with five non-conference games in just over
two weeks.The Card experienced early success
and remains undefeated at Maples Pavilion,
with wins over UC-Riverside, North Carolina
A&T and Yale, but it continues to struggle on
the road, falling in consecutive contests to But
ler and Oklahoma State, its toughest non-con
ference opponents of the year.
On Sunday, Dec, 12, the Card never trailed
against visiting Riverside, jumping out to a
quick 7-0 lead that it maintained. Stanford won
the game, 55-48.
Junior guard Jeremy Green, who gave fans
a scare when he collapsed from exhaustion
after the final game of the 76 Classic, started off
slowly, but he came back with a vengeance to
score all of his game-leading 22 points in the
second half.
"At halftime, I went back and thought
about why I was missing so much," he said. "I
wanted to let the game come to me instead of
forcing it. I concentrated more on making
shots and I settled in."
The Cardinal dominated the boards, out-re
bounding the Highlanders by a 43-27 margin.
Redshirt junior big man Josh Owens led the
team his 10 rebounds and 14 points notched
him his first career double-double.
Several days later, still on the Farm, Stan
ford dominated North Carolina A&T, winning
76-59. After trailing by as many as seven in the
first half, the Card turned around to lead by 20
points in the game's final minutes.Twelve play
ers saw minutes, with key contributions again
coming from captains Green and Owens, with
18 and 15 points, respectively. North Carolina
A&T junior guard Nic Simpson led the night
with 20 points on 8-for-15 shooting.
"J.O. is finding himself," said Stanford head
coach Johnny Dawkins of Owens, who sat out
all of last season. "Every game you see him get
ting better and better."
Owens is refocused and driven after his
year off, as evidenced by his continued im
provement on the court.
"When you're away from the game for a
year, you appreciate it a lot more," he said. "It's
definitely a different mindset, and I think that's
been the biggest difference."
However, road games continued to be diffi
cult for Stanford's young squad, which fell de
cisively to Butler, last year's national runner
up, and to Oklahoma State, which it faced in
the Pac-10/Big 12 Hardwood Series.
Playing on Dec. 18 in Indianapolis, Butler
took control early, with a 10-point lead halfway
through the first period; the Bulldogs stretched
their advantage to 19 at halftime.
Butler's senior forward Matt
Howard scored 10 straight points to
open the second half and finished
with a game-high 27 points and 10
rebounds in the Bulldogs' 83-50
thrashing.
Green was Stanford's leading
scorer with 16 points but shot only 5-
for-15 from the field, and Owens
added another 13. Butler outshot
the Cardinal 45.6 percent to 31.4
percent a season low for the Card
and had 39 rebounds to Stan
ford's 29. Junior center Jack Trotter
was Stanford's leading rebounder,
with seven total rebounds.
On Dec. 21, in Stillwater, Okla.,
the Card continued to have trouble,
getting off to a rough 7-0 deficit
against the Cowboys and failing to
score in the game's first six minutes.
Stanford rallied to retie the score at
12-12 and took the lead until the first
half's final seconds, but the second
half, and game, belonged to the
home team.The Cowboys outscored
the Cardinal 45-35 in the second pe
riod, and though Stanford narrowed
the deficit to six with 1:48 remaining,
Oklahoma State held on to win the
game, 79-68.
Owens tallied his second career
double-double, leading the Card
with 21 points and 10 rebounds, and
Green added 17. Freshmen Aaron
Bright and Dwight Powell had
strong contributions off the bench
Bright scored 15, going 8-for-8
from the free-throw line, and Powell
had 10 points, two blocks and four
rebounds.
Cowboy junior guard Keiton
Page had 23 points, 20 in the second
half, and five of Oklahoma State's 11
three-pointers. Three other players:
Ray Penn, Marshall Moses and
Jean-Paul Olukemi, had 14,13 and
12 points, respectively.
In its last matchup before the
Pac-10 season, Stanford stayed per
fect at Maples with a 60-44 decision
over Yale. Dawkins made a notable
lineup change, electing to go small
by starting Bright at the point guard
position, and juniors Jarrett Mann
and Green off the ball.
"I like Aaron there [at the point
guard position]," Dawkins said. "I
think that he's been playing steady
for us, and he's helped us. I'm actual
ly very encouraged that we'll keep

getting better at that position."
Both teams started off slowly,
and Yale entered the half with a one
point lead, but Stanford awoke to
take control of the game in the sec
ond period. Green had 11 of his 15
points in the second half, and Owens
added 12. Dawkins, however, was
more impressed with his team's de
fensive effort — the Card had 15
points off turnovers, 10 steals and
four blocks.
The Yale game wrapped up Stan
ford's non-conference schedule
until March, and Dawkins is opti
mistic about his team's preparation
entering the Pac-10 season.
"We are excited about Pac-10
starting up," Dawkins said after the
Yale game, prior to defeating Cali
fornia last Sunday. "I think we've
had some amazing tests. We've been
on the road in some incredible envi
ronments. I think our kids have
grown from that experience, and
that's going to help us. I think we
played a good schedule in prepara
tion for Pac-10 play and are pre
pared for the conference."
Stanford will resume Pac-10 play
this weekend on the road against the
Arizona schools. The Cardinal will
face Arizona State on Thursday at
5:30 p.m. in Tempe and will take on
Arizona on Sunday at 3:30 p.m. in
Tucson.

score in the game's first six minutes.
Stanford rallied to retie the score at
12-12 and took the lead until the first
half's final seconds, but the second
half, and game, belonged to the
home team.The Cowboys outscored
the Cardinal 45-35 in the second pe
riod, and though Stanford narrowed
the deficit to six with 1:48 remaining,
Oklahoma State held on to win the
game, 79-68.
Owens tallied his second career
double-double, leading the Card
with 21 points and 10 rebounds, and
Green added 17. Freshmen Aaron
Bright and Dwight Powell had
strong contributions off the bench
Bright scored 15, going 8-for-8
from the free-throw line, and Powell
had 10 points, two blocks and four
rebounds.
Cowboy junior guard Keiton
Page had 23 points, 20 in the second
half, and five of Oklahoma State's 11
three-pointers. Three other players:
Ray Penn, Marshall Moses and
Jean-Paul Olukemi, had 14,13 and
12 points, respectively.
In its last matchup before the
Pac-10 season, Stanford stayed per
fect at Maples with a 60-44 decision
over Yale. Dawkins made a notable
lineup change, electing to go small
by starting Bright at the point guard
position, and juniors Jarrett Mann
and Green off the ball.
"I like Aaron there [at the point
guard position]," Dawkins said. "I
think that he's been playing steady
for us, and he's helped us. I'm actual
ly very encouraged that we'll keep

getting better at that position."
Both teams started off slowly,
and Yale entered the half with a one
point lead, but Stanford awoke to
take control of the game in the sec
ond period. Green had 11 of his 15
points in the second half, and Owens
added 12. Dawkins, however, was
more impressed with his team's de
fensive effort — the Card had 15
points off turnovers, 10 steals and
four blocks.
The Yale game wrapped up Stan
ford's non-conference schedule
until March, and Dawkins is opti
mistic about his team's preparation
entering the Pac-10 season.
"We are excited about Pac-10
starting up," Dawkins said after the
Yale game, prior to defeating Cali
fornia last Sunday. "I think we've
had some amazing tests. We've been
on the road in some incredible envi
ronments. I think our kids have
grown from that experience, and
that's going to help us. I think we
played a good schedule in prepara
tion for Pac-10 play and are pre
pared for the conference."
Stanford will resume Pac-10 play
this weekend on the road against the
Arizona schools. The Cardinal will
face Arizona State on Thursday at
5:30 p.m. in Tempe and will take on
Arizona on Sunday at 3:30 p.m. in
Tucson.

Before deftly handling visiting California in
its first Pac-10 matchup of the season on Sun
day, the Stanford men's basketball team had
little time to relax during the holiday break,
with five non-conference games in just over
two weeks.The Card experienced early success
and remains undefeated at Maples Pavilion,
with wins over UC-Riverside, North Carolina
A&T and Yale, but it continues to struggle on
the road, falling in consecutive contests to But
ler and Oklahoma State, its toughest non-con
ference opponents of the year.
On Sunday, Dec, 12, the Card never trailed
against visiting Riverside, jumping out to a
quick 7-0 lead that it maintained. Stanford won
the game, 55-48.
Junior guard Jeremy Green, who gave fans
a scare when he collapsed from exhaustion
after the final game of the 76 Classic, started off
slowly, but he came back with a vengeance to
score all of his game-leading 22 points in the
second half.
"At halftime, I went back and thought
about why I was missing so much," he said. "I
wanted to let the game come to me instead of
forcing it. I concentrated more on making
shots and I settled in."
The Cardinal dominated the boards, out-re
bounding the Highlanders by a 43-27 margin.
Redshirt junior big man Josh Owens led the
team his 10 rebounds and 14 points notched
him his first career double-double.
Several days later, still on the Farm, Stan
ford dominated North Carolina A&T, winning
76-59. After trailing by as many as seven in the
first half, the Card turned around to lead by 20
points in the game's final minutes.Twelve play
ers saw minutes, with key contributions again
coming from captains Green and Owens, with
18 and 15 points, respectively. North Carolina
A&T junior guard Nic Simpson led the night
with 20 points on 8-for-15 shooting.
"J.O. is finding himself," said Stanford head
coach Johnny Dawkins of Owens, who sat out
all of last season. "Every game you see him get
ting better and better."
Owens is refocused and driven after his
year off, as evidenced by his continued im
provement on the court.
"When you're away from the game for a
year, you appreciate it a lot more," he said. "It's
definitely a different mindset, and I think that's
been the biggest difference."
However, road games continued to be diffi
cult for Stanford's young squad, which fell de
cisively to Butler, last year's national runner
up, and to Oklahoma State, which it faced in
the Pac-10/Big 12 Hardwood Series.
Playing on Dec. 18 in Indianapolis, Butler
took control early, with a 10-point lead halfway
through the first period; the Bulldogs stretched
their advantage to 19 at halftime.
Butler's senior forward Matt
Howard scored 10 straight points to
open the second half and finished
with a game-high 27 points and 10
rebounds in the Bulldogs' 83-50
thrashing.
Green was Stanford's leading
scorer with 16 points but shot only 5-
for-15 from the field, and Owens
added another 13. Butler outshot
the Cardinal 45.6 percent to 31.4
percent a season low for the Card
and had 39 rebounds to Stan
ford's 29. Junior center Jack Trotter
was Stanford's leading rebounder,
with seven total rebounds.
On Dec. 21, in Stillwater, Okla.,
the Card continued to have trouble,
getting off to a rough 7-0 deficit
against the Cowboys and failing to
score in the game's first six minutes.
