# DEFENDING THE TITLE
## MEN BEGIN 2011 CAMPAIGN AT HOME 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH STAFF WRITER 
Just three years removed from a painful 3-
25 season, the 2010 Stanford men's volleyball
team used the slogan "Worst to First" as it
stormed to the program's second NCAA Divi
sion I title. The mantra, coined by revered as
sistant coach A1 Roderigues, who passed away
from cancer two months before the champi
onship match, helped bring a surge of fan sup
port and enthusiasm to Maples Pavilion during

the run. Eight months later, tonight is the be
ginning of what players and coaches have
deemed the "First to First" season with its first
match against UC-Santa Cruz.
The road to another national championship
will not be easy for this Cardinal team. To
begin with, Stanford will have to replace last
season's American Volleyball Coaches' Asso
ciation (AVCA) national player of the year
and two-time AVCA first team Ail-American
