# DEFENDING THE TITLE
## MEN BEGIN 2011 CAMPAIGN AT HOME 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH STAFF WRITER 
Just three years removed from a painful 3-
25 season, the 2010 Stanford men's volleyball
team used the slogan "Worst to First" as it
stormed to the program's second NCAA Divi
sion I title. The mantra, coined by revered as
sistant coach A1 Roderigues, who passed away
from cancer two months before the champi
onship match, helped bring a surge of fan sup
port and enthusiasm to Maples Pavilion during

the run. Eight months later, tonight is the be
ginning of what players and coaches have
deemed the "First to First" season with its first
match against UC-Santa Cruz.
The road to another national championship
will not be easy for this Cardinal team. To
begin with, Stanford will have to replace last
season's American Volleyball Coaches' Asso
ciation (AVCA) national player of the year
and two-time AVCA first team Ail-American

Barry looks likely to be head coach
John Kosty's choice to step into
Shoji's big shoes.
Barry spent the summer at the
Federation Internationale de Vol
leyball (FIVB) Junior World Beach
Volleyball Championships in
Turkey and has been playing well
in open-gym sessions, but he will
need to create chemistry with a
front line that will also be without
AVCA second team All-American
opposite hitter Evan Romero and
Stanford's career record holder in
blocks, middle blocker Garrett
Werner; both graduated last spring.
Despite losing three starters, the
Cardinal has plenty of reason to be
optimistic about its chances this
year. Barry will be joined on the
court by Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation (MPSF) player of the
year and AVCA first team All-

Erik Shoji, Kawika's younger
brother, will provide leadership
and consistency to the defense, and

the team's other returning starters
senior outside hitter Spencer
McLachlin and junior middle
blocker Gus Ellis make this
Stanford team another strong can
didate for postseason success.
The MPSF coaches agree, pick
ing Stanford to finish third in the
tough conference behind UC-
Irvine and USC. Last year, the Car
dinal was picked to finish fourth
before going 16-6 in league play. It
lost only one set total in the MPSF
and NCAA Tournaments, sweep
ing both Ohio State and Penn State
at a raucous Maples Pavilion last
May.

Kosty, too, seems optimistic that
this year's core returners will give
the team enough veteran leader
ship to balance out what looks to
be a very promising incoming class,
headlined by two opposite hitters,
Steven Irving and Daniel Tublin.
The class also includes Eric
Mochalski, a top outside hitter
who also plays opposite, and a mid
dle blocker, Denny Falls, who
Kosty sums up simply as "dynam
ic."

Many have tabbed Stanford's
freshmen as the top recruiting class
in the nation. Five of the seven are
6-foot-4 or taller (the exceptions
being a pair of 5-foot-9 liberos,
Scott Sakaida and Grant Delgado),

and two played on the U.S. Junior
National Team.

After visiting the White House
and meeting with President
Obama over the summer, the team
spent the winter break preparing
for what promises to be a tough
early schedule. After opening
against Santa Cruz, Stanford plays
host to Brigham Young for a dou
bleheader in the MPSF opener.The
Cardinal then hits the road, playing
at Hawaii before a weekend trip to
Cal State Northridge and Long
Beach State.
A midseason trip to Lewis and
Loyola of Chicago breaks up the
conference schedule, but marks the
only time Stanford will leave the
West Coast.
Tonight's match against UC-
Santa Cruz will be at 7 p.m. at Burn
ham Pavilion.
