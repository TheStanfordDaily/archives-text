# Bring Winter Classic to the Bay Area
## 
### Kabir Sawhney Follow the Money 
For the past four years, the
NHL's Winter Classic has
captivated both hockey en
thusiasts and casual fans
alike. The concept is quite
simple: schedule a marquee matchup
on New Year's Day and play the game
in an outdoor stadium.
The purpose behind staging the
Winter Classic is twofold. It seeks to re
turn hockey to its roots as an outdoor
game, played in winter on frozen ponds
and lakes. Many NHL players learned
the game outside, and there's certainly
nothing wrong with venturing outside
every so often. The past four Classics
have sought to fulfill this ideal by being
hosted in some of America's bigger
hockey cities (Buffalo and Pittsburgh)
or being held in iconic venues (Wrigley
Field in Chicago and Fenway Park in
Boston).
The second purpose of the Classic is
some what more commercial. Since its
inception, the Winter Classic has consis
tently been one of the NHL's biggest
games in terms of TV viewership; it
even surpasses some Stanley Cup
games in television ratings. Because the
league and its network partner, NBC,
aggressively market the game, it cap
tures casual American fans, something
that the NHL desperately wants. It also
helps that the game is held on the New
Year's holiday.
While the NHL has not yet decided
on the location and teams for next
year's Classic, the top two possibilities
appear to be a Rangers-Flyers matchup
in Philadelphia or a RedWings game at
the Big House in Ann Arbor, Mich.
Games in both locations would do well
at filling both of the NHL's goals for the
Winter Classic.
However, the NHL cannot contin
ue to satisfy tradition and reach out to
the casual viewer simultaneously. The
league appears to be looking strictly at
the Northeast, with a little bit of the
Midwest thrown in, as the only places
where expansion is possible. The Clas
sic risks becoming the province of a
subset of NHL teams; already, there has
been grumbling because the Pittsburgh
Penguins have played in two of the four
games held thus far.
In order to reach out to casual fans
all over the country, the NHL needs to
evaluate staging the Winter Classic in a
different region than between Chicago
and New York. I, for one, think it would
be great for the NHL if next year's Clas
sic came here to the Bay Area, in Can
dlestick Park or AT&T Park.
The Bay Area would be a good fit
for the game for several reasons.
Though they rank behind a few teams,
especially the Giants and the 49ers, in
the region's collective sports conscious
ness, the Sharks have a dedicated and
passionate fan base that would surely
snap up tickets to a Classic at Candle
stick.
By and large, the NHL has over
looked the West Coast in its marketing
strategy, despite the fact that California
owns some of the nation's largest media
markets. Before this year, the Winter
Classic was held at 1 p.m. Eastern time;
this was good for not conflicting with
BCS bowl games, but bad for viewers
out West. No one is going to get up at 10
a.m. to watch a hockey game,
A Bay Area Classic would also at
tract a large number of casual fans from
the West Coast that may otherwise not
have tuned in to the game. The Winter
Classic would electrify the hockey cul
ture in the region, which could certainly
use some revitalization.
Lastly, and perhaps most important
ly, San Francisco in January can be quite
cold. The main objection of the purists
to venturing outside the Northeast is
that it would take the "Winter" out of
"Winter Classic." However, as any San
Fran resident knows, it gets pretty chilly
in the city, and we wouldn't have to re
solve the logical quandary of how one
can play on a sheet of ice in 70-degree
outdoor temperatures.
The Winter Classic has been incred
ibly good for hockey, providing it with a
great deal of exposure among an
American viewing public that is gener
ally apathetic to the sport. The NHL
needs to leverage the Classic appropri
ately to maximize its benefit, and mov
ing outside of the Northeast and into
the Bay Area is the best way to spread
on the West Coast.
