# DEBATE MARCHES ON
## 'Don't ask' repeal jumpstarts ROTC debate among LGBT advocates 
### KURT CHIRBAS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Last month's repeal of "don't ask, don't
tell" (DADT), a federal policy that banned
openly gay people from serving in the mili
tary, has ushered in a new stage in the debate
over whether ROTC will be brought back to
Stanford. Considered by some to contradict
Stanford's nondiscrimination policy, DADT
was seen as a major obstacle to overcome by
those who supported the return of ROTC,
whose program at Stanford ended in the
19705.

"Within the committee, DADT was al
ways one of our hold-ups," said Imani
Franklin 'l3, a member of the Faculty Senate
ad hoc committee on ROTC formed last
March to explore a possible return. "There
would not be much consideration about
bringing ROTC back if 'don't ask, don't tell'
was still in place."
"Now that it's been repealed," Franklin
added, "we can go forward with the conversa
tion, and it's much more likely that ROTC
could be brought back to campus if that's
what the general Stanford community
wants."

However, the repeal has left the LGBT
community at Stanford divided.
While some LGBT groups view it as suc
cess for gay and lesbian people, who can now
serve in uniform openly, others such as
Stanford Students for Queer Liberation
(SSQL) and the Stanford Queer-Straight Al
liance (SQSA) believe the repeal may be
used as grounds to justify the return of
ROTC even though the military has other
discriminatory policies in place.
In particular, the two groups say they are
concerned that transgender people are still
excluded from service according the Uni
form Code of Military Justice.
"Now that DADT is repealed, we ac
knowledge and appreciate the fact that gay,
lesbian and bisexual service members can
now serve openly," said Janani Balasubra
manian 'l2, a member of SSQL's subcommit
tee on ROTC. "But on the other hand, the
military is still completely closed off to trans
gender people. We feel that, on the grounds
that Stanford does have gender identity in its
nondiscrimination clause, that we should op
pose ROTC."
Early in fall quarter, SSQL formed a sub
committee to investigate ROTC soon after
Daniel Colligan, a graduate student in com
puter science and president of the group

Stanford Says No to War, came to speak at
one of their meetings. He presented his views
on ROTC and asked the group if it would like
to take a stance on the issue as well.
"We had already been talking about the
ROTC issue in light of DADT," Balasubra
manian said, "but he was definitely sort of a
spark for us."
The group spent several meetings trying
to determine what its position on the issue
would be. After deciding that it was a queer

rights organization, not just a gay rights or
ganization, SSQL came to the conclusion
that it could not support a program that dis
criminates against transgender people.
Its first act was writing a Nov. 15 op-ed in
The Daily, which laid out its views on ROTC.
Now, because of the repeal, the group has de
cided to write another letter. While it was
originally to be addressed to exclusively to
the Office of Diversity and Access asking it to
uphold Stanford's nondiscrimination policy,
it is now an open letter to all and has been
sent to most of the administration.

In fact, SSQL has been shifting its tactics.
"We still really want to watch what's going
on with the Faculty Senate and present our
voices," SSQL president Alok Vaid-Menon
'l3 said, "but we've reoriented our efforts to
create a consciousness amongst the student
body."

Next week, the group's members plan on
passing out flyers about their position in
White Plaza to bring attention to their cause,
which is pointing out the exclusion of trans
gender people.

sions within just the left-leaning
community over this issue,
"I definitely think they're
there," Vaid-Menon said. "I think
there are a lot of people that now
see it as fair for the military to be
back recruiting on campus because
gay men and women can now serve
openly."
One of these people is Zev Kar
lin-Neumann 'll, campus director
of Stanford Democrats. While the
organization has yet to take an offi
cial stance, and may not given the
large umbrella of members it cov
ers, Karlin-Neumann says he sup
ports the return of ROTC in light of
the policy's repeal.
"I think a number of Stanford
Democrats like myself believe that
it's very important to have an inte
grated military," Karlin-Neumann
said, "and not just in terms of allow
ing people of all races, backgrounds
and sexual orientations to serve.
People who come from institutions
like Stanford should also be al

lowed to engage in the military
through something like ROTC as
well."
Karlin-Neumann said the issue
is at least worth re-examining.
"I think DADT was a very obvi
ous obstacle to bringing ROTC
back, and I think that the exclusion
of ROTC is the product of some
historical issues with the military,"
he said. "But since issues are con
stantly evolving, I think our re
sponses to them should change as
well. [The repeal] does offer reason
to revisit some of these policies, and
it should be open for discussion."
And it will be next Tuesday night
when the Faculty Senate committee
holds a town-hall style meeting in
the Betchel International Center
Assembly room from 7 to 9 p.m.,
where the committee members will
be introduced and students can
voice their opinions.
"It's going to be a really open
forum," Franklin said. "I would def
initely encourage students to come
to the town hall, because students
are going to have a large role in this
decision."

While some LGBT groups view it as suc
cess for gay and lesbian people, who can now
serve in uniform openly, others such as
Stanford Students for Queer Liberation
(SSQL) and the Stanford Queer-Straight Al
liance (SQSA) believe the repeal may be
used as grounds to justify the return of
ROTC even though the military has other
discriminatory policies in place.
In particular, the two groups say they are
concerned that transgender people are still
excluded from service according the Uni
form Code of Military Justice.
"Now that DADT is repealed, we ac
knowledge and appreciate the fact that gay,
lesbian and bisexual service members can
now serve openly," said Janani Balasubra
manian 'l2, a member of SSQL's subcommit
tee on ROTC. "But on the other hand, the
military is still completely closed off to trans
gender people. We feel that, on the grounds
that Stanford does have gender identity in its
nondiscrimination clause, that we should op
pose ROTC."
Early in fall quarter, SSQL formed a sub
committee to investigate ROTC soon after
Daniel Colligan, a graduate student in com
puter science and president of the group

Stanford Says No to War, came to speak at
one of their meetings. He presented his views
on ROTC and asked the group if it would like
to take a stance on the issue as well.
"We had already been talking about the
ROTC issue in light of DADT," Balasubra
manian said, "but he was definitely sort of a
spark for us."
The group spent several meetings trying
to determine what its position on the issue
would be. After deciding that it was a queer

rights organization, not just a gay rights or
ganization, SSQL came to the conclusion
that it could not support a program that dis
criminates against transgender people.
Its first act was writing a Nov. 15 op-ed in
The Daily, which laid out its views on ROTC.
Now, because of the repeal, the group has de
cided to write another letter. While it was
originally to be addressed to exclusively to
the Office of Diversity and Access asking it to
uphold Stanford's nondiscrimination policy,
it is now an open letter to all and has been
sent to most of the administration.

In fact, SSQL has been shifting its tactics.
"We still really want to watch what's going
on with the Faculty Senate and present our
voices," SSQL president Alok Vaid-Menon
'l3 said, "but we've reoriented our efforts to
create a consciousness amongst the student
body."

Next week, the group's members plan on
passing out flyers about their position in
White Plaza to bring attention to their cause,
which is pointing out the exclusion of trans
gender people.

sions within just the left-leaning
community over this issue,
"I definitely think they're
there," Vaid-Menon said. "I think
there are a lot of people that now
see it as fair for the military to be
back recruiting on campus because
gay men and women can now serve
openly."
One of these people is Zev Kar
lin-Neumann 'll, campus director
of Stanford Democrats. While the
organization has yet to take an offi
cial stance, and may not given the
large umbrella of members it cov
ers, Karlin-Neumann says he sup
ports the return of ROTC in light of
the policy's repeal.
"I think a number of Stanford
Democrats like myself believe that
it's very important to have an inte
grated military," Karlin-Neumann
said, "and not just in terms of allow
ing people of all races, backgrounds
and sexual orientations to serve.
People who come from institutions
like Stanford should also be al

lowed to engage in the military
through something like ROTC as
well."
Karlin-Neumann said the issue
is at least worth re-examining.
"I think DADT was a very obvi
ous obstacle to bringing ROTC
back, and I think that the exclusion
of ROTC is the product of some
historical issues with the military,"
he said. "But since issues are con
stantly evolving, I think our re
sponses to them should change as
well. [The repeal] does offer reason
to revisit some of these policies, and
it should be open for discussion."
And it will be next Tuesday night
when the Faculty Senate committee
holds a town-hall style meeting in
the Betchel International Center
Assembly room from 7 to 9 p.m.,
where the committee members will
be introduced and students can
voice their opinions.
"It's going to be a really open
forum," Franklin said. "I would def
initely encourage students to come
to the town hall, because students
are going to have a large role in this
decision."

Last month's repeal of "don't ask, don't
tell" (DADT), a federal policy that banned
openly gay people from serving in the mili
tary, has ushered in a new stage in the debate
over whether ROTC will be brought back to
Stanford. Considered by some to contradict
Stanford's nondiscrimination policy, DADT
was seen as a major obstacle to overcome by
those who supported the return of ROTC,
whose program at Stanford ended in the
19705.

"Within the committee, DADT was al
ways one of our hold-ups," said Imani
Franklin 'l3, a member of the Faculty Senate
ad hoc committee on ROTC formed last
March to explore a possible return. "There
would not be much consideration about
bringing ROTC back if 'don't ask, don't tell'
was still in place."
"Now that it's been repealed," Franklin
added, "we can go forward with the conversa
tion, and it's much more likely that ROTC
could be brought back to campus if that's
what the general Stanford community
wants."

However, the repeal has left the LGBT
community at Stanford divided.
While some LGBT groups view it as suc
cess for gay and lesbian people, who can now
serve in uniform openly, others such as
Stanford Students for Queer Liberation
(SSQL) and the Stanford Queer-Straight Al
