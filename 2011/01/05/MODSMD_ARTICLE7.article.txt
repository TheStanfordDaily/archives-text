# SHATTERING THE SLE STEREOTYPE?
## 
### SOPHIA VO 
( w 've heard that SLE kids are per-
I haps more artsy and less techy,"
I said Rebecca Amato'l4. "Also,
I I've noticed I haven't met too
many right-handed IHUM kids.
So SLE kids must be left-handed," she joked.
"It sounds like a disease," said Maria Posa
'l4. "She's got the'SLE.'"
So go some "SLE kid" sterotypes. And
almost every year, it plays out in Gaieties:
big glasses, parted hair, awkward social
habits. At a house meeting, one student
commented that her dorm was able to laugh
at the dramatization all the more because it
was so removed from the truth.
SLE students live not on another planet,
but in Florence Moore (FloMo).
"It's not really a cave," joked Ben Rad
cliffe 'l3. "We venture out on occasion, like
Fridays and Saturdays."
The program includes lectures and sec
tions based in a residence hall. Films, plays
and tutoring are mixed in with daily dorm
life. With the activities kept in one area,
there is a stigma about the program that
comes from the outside: the IHUM world.
But Faisan, like typical freshman dorms,
has a lounge, stairs, resident assistants
(RAs), laptops attached to students and
long hallways. At a routine house meeting,
residents showed clear camaraderie one
student ran around hugging everyone. An
other dressed in full attire as a dictator for
an upcoming play. Others brought in freshly
baked goods for the taking. And the couch
es were full.

"Four of us sophomores re-applied for
FloMo because we love it so much," Rad
cliffe said. "SLEers are really into kooky,
eccentric things. One of them is our author
itarian government, which manages Faisan
daily life. There's an oligarchy called the
Council of Five, which bakes and puts up
posters. It tries to instill a sense of discipline
and order."
"There's also a revolution, led by me,"
RA Morielle Stroethoff 'l2 added. "The
revolution believes not in the pursuit of
perfection. We believe in love and compas
sion. And also peanut butter and honey
sandwiches."
Stoethoff reflected on the residents she
has met during fall quarter as an RA.
"My freshmen this year are amazing, so
real and honest," she said. "Everyone has a
really strong personality and usually has a
weird talent you don't know about. [lt's] a
combination of fuzzy and techy [people]."
But if SLE kids are so like your average
Stanford students, why is there the stigma?
One SLE alumna had a theory.
"Quite a bit is that FloMo is more distant
than other dorms," said Nabila Abdallah 'l3.
"I was one of the not-so-studious of SLE
kids," she added. "My average sleep time
was 4 a.m., and it wasn't part of studying. In
SLE, I pretty much got to know everyone."
Some stereotypes might emerge just be
cause SLE is so self-contained.
"Socially? It was difficult that I didn't
know many people well outside my dorm.
I'm still struggling with that balance," said
Gregory Valdespino 'l3.

But for many students, the relative isola
tion is worth it.
"SLE doesn't enlighten you," added
Valdespino. "It gives you the skills to think.
It's not like I know everything, but my cu
riosity has been piqued in enough things
that I know what questions to ask."
Students read Greek epics, scripture,
English classics and more.
"You can see the trajectory of thoughts
in academia," Valdespino explained. "With
some professors and some ideas, you see
how they apply to our modern life, how the
struggles I'm going through in college, intel
lectually or socially, have been going on
long through civilization."
More than 90 professors lecture by the
end of the year.
SLE students take in a wide breadth of
the humanities. Techies enjoy that they
don't have to take a ton of fuzzy classes
later on. Fuzzies enjoy absorbing material
they're passionate about, which they could
go on to study even more in the future.
Eva Oped 'l4 gave an inside scoop on
lingo unique to SLE.
"SLEcture, SLEssays, SLEople, SLEc
tion, Flove," Oped said. "SLove means
SLincest. SLExile could be SLE exile be
cause we take over all the lounges. North
FloMorians are people who are around
during the day but suspiciously go else
where at night."
The general consensus seems to be that
those who choose SLE love it.
"The community definitely is close
knit," Oped went on. "We really take care of

each other."
SLE administrators feel the companion
ship encouraged by the SLE program, as
well.
"I get a sense of the community in the
lecture sections because I see the way they
talk to each other," said history professor
and SLE academic director Carolyn
Lougee. "It's not that they're sitting there
talking about Plato, but there are a lot of
close friendships. At our banquet, there was
a challenge to translate a passage of a Latin
epic into English poetry. Eight people read
poems. Everybody loves it when they see
their classmates achieving."
"We don't nurture competition at all.
One person's accomplishment is every
one's glory," Lougee added.
As apart as SLE might sometimes seem
from the rest of the Stanford world, admin
istrators do their best to see that the com
munity isn't totally separated from other
dorms.
"We had the opportunity to move the
dorm to Roble and we said no because it
wasn't sure that they would be mixed in
with other dorms," Lougee said. "It would
n't be good if they were set apart."
"The new ideas in my life [from SLE]
made a big impact, maybe because I'm from
a small-town farm in Idaho," said SLE assis
tant director Greg Watkins 'B5 Ph.D. 'O3.
"We have a year to cultivate a different way
of thinking about what you study and about
life in general."

habits. At a house meeting, one student
commented that her dorm was able to laugh
at the dramatization all the more because it
was so removed from the truth.
SLE students live not on another planet,
but in Florence Moore (FloMo).
"It's not really a cave," joked Ben Rad
cliffe 'l3. "We venture out on occasion, like
Fridays and Saturdays."
The program includes lectures and sec
tions based in a residence hall. Films, plays
and tutoring are mixed in with daily dorm
life. With the activities kept in one area,
there is a stigma about the program that
comes from the outside: the IHUM world.
But Faisan, like typical freshman dorms,
has a lounge, stairs, resident assistants
(RAs), laptops attached to students and
long hallways. At a routine house meeting,
residents showed clear camaraderie one
student ran around hugging everyone. An
other dressed in full attire as a dictator for
an upcoming play. Others brought in freshly
baked goods for the taking. And the couch
es were full.

"Four of us sophomores re-applied for
FloMo because we love it so much," Rad
cliffe said. "SLEers are really into kooky,
eccentric things. One of them is our author
itarian government, which manages Faisan
daily life. There's an oligarchy called the
Council of Five, which bakes and puts up
posters. It tries to instill a sense of discipline
and order."
"There's also a revolution, led by me,"
RA Morielle Stroethoff 'l2 added. "The
revolution believes not in the pursuit of
perfection. We believe in love and compas
sion. And also peanut butter and honey
sandwiches."
Stoethoff reflected on the residents she
has met during fall quarter as an RA.
"My freshmen this year are amazing, so
real and honest," she said. "Everyone has a
really strong personality and usually has a
weird talent you don't know about. [lt's] a
combination of fuzzy and techy [people]."
But if SLE kids are so like your average
Stanford students, why is there the stigma?
One SLE alumna had a theory.
"Quite a bit is that FloMo is more distant
than other dorms," said Nabila Abdallah 'l3.
"I was one of the not-so-studious of SLE
kids," she added. "My average sleep time
was 4 a.m., and it wasn't part of studying. In
SLE, I pretty much got to know everyone."
Some stereotypes might emerge just be
cause SLE is so self-contained.
"Socially? It was difficult that I didn't
know many people well outside my dorm.
I'm still struggling with that balance," said
Gregory Valdespino 'l3.

But for many students, the relative isola
tion is worth it.
"SLE doesn't enlighten you," added
Valdespino. "It gives you the skills to think.
It's not like I know everything, but my cu
riosity has been piqued in enough things
that I know what questions to ask."
Students read Greek epics, scripture,
English classics and more.
"You can see the trajectory of thoughts
in academia," Valdespino explained. "With
some professors and some ideas, you see
how they apply to our modern life, how the
struggles I'm going through in college, intel
lectually or socially, have been going on
long through civilization."
More than 90 professors lecture by the
end of the year.
SLE students take in a wide breadth of
the humanities. Techies enjoy that they
don't have to take a ton of fuzzy classes
later on. Fuzzies enjoy absorbing material
they're passionate about, which they could
go on to study even more in the future.
Eva Oped 'l4 gave an inside scoop on
lingo unique to SLE.
"SLEcture, SLEssays, SLEople, SLEc
tion, Flove," Oped said. "SLove means
SLincest. SLExile could be SLE exile be
cause we take over all the lounges. North
FloMorians are people who are around
during the day but suspiciously go else
where at night."
The general consensus seems to be that
those who choose SLE love it.
"The community definitely is close
knit," Oped went on. "We really take care of

each other."
SLE administrators feel the companion
ship encouraged by the SLE program, as
well.
"I get a sense of the community in the
lecture sections because I see the way they
talk to each other," said history professor
and SLE academic director Carolyn
Lougee. "It's not that they're sitting there
talking about Plato, but there are a lot of
close friendships. At our banquet, there was
a challenge to translate a passage of a Latin
epic into English poetry. Eight people read
poems. Everybody loves it when they see
their classmates achieving."
"We don't nurture competition at all.
One person's accomplishment is every
one's glory," Lougee added.
As apart as SLE might sometimes seem
from the rest of the Stanford world, admin
istrators do their best to see that the com
munity isn't totally separated from other
dorms.
"We had the opportunity to move the
dorm to Roble and we said no because it
wasn't sure that they would be mixed in
with other dorms," Lougee said. "It would
n't be good if they were set apart."
"The new ideas in my life [from SLE]
made a big impact, maybe because I'm from
a small-town farm in Idaho," said SLE assis
tant director Greg Watkins 'B5 Ph.D. 'O3.
"We have a year to cultivate a different way
of thinking about what you study and about
life in general."

( w 've heard that SLE kids are per-
I haps more artsy and less techy,"
I said Rebecca Amato'l4. "Also,
I I've noticed I haven't met too
many right-handed IHUM kids.
So SLE kids must be left-handed," she joked.
"It sounds like a disease," said Maria Posa
'l4. "She's got the'SLE.'"
So go some "SLE kid" sterotypes. And
