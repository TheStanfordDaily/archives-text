# New law reduces marijuana penalty
## 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Ivy Nguyen 
Under a new law that took effect
Jan. 1, the penalty for the possession
of up to one ounce of marijuana has
been reduced from a misdemeanor to
an infraction. The law, introduced by
Sen. Mark Leno, D-San Francisco,
states that those found in possession
of less than 28.5 grams will be given a
$ 100 maximum fine, which is less than
some traffic tickets.

According to Bill Larson, a
spokesman for the Stanford Depart
ment of Public Safety, the department
does not have a specific policy regard
ing marijuana possession and will en
force the new law. Larson said he did
not anticipate much change to the
number of citations issued for mari
juana possession.
The reduction is intended to save
the state's judicial system millions of
dollars by sparing many of the more
than 60,000 people arrested each year
for marijuana-related misdemeanors
from appearing in court.

This new law is the first time the
California legislature has voluntarily
reduced penalties for marijuana or
any drug offense since 1975, accord
ing to NORML, a group supporting
marijuana legalization.
