# LETTERS TO THE LDITOR
## With DADT gone, plenty of objections to ROTC remain 
### 
Dear Editor,
Kurt Chirbas' article in yester
day's Daily contains a misleading
narrative, which goes something like,
"Since DADT was the only obstacle
to Stanford devoting its resources to
a ROTC program, and DADT has
been repealed, now we can talk
about accommodating the military"
("Debate marches on," Jan. 5). In
fact, DADT was never a reason for
the expulsion of ROTC from cam
pus.

Imani Franklin, being a member
of the ROTC ad hoc committee,
should know this but doesn't appear
to. To quote from the committee's
own document: "The majority [of
the 1968-9 committee] felt that the
personal conduct standards of the
three services 'can seriously limit the
student's free participation in all
facets of intellectual inquiry and
legal political activity.'" It concluded
that a formal, on-campus ROTC
program was inconsistent with the
definition of Stanford University as
"a community whose members ...

have a primary commitment to the
creation and dissemination of
knowledge, in an environment of
free intellectual activity." Plainly, this
has nothing to do with DADT.

Furthermore, I wonder if the
committee even looked at the letter
that I wrote to it or if it went straight
to the trash bin. I raised several
points that would pose a problem for
ROTC's return: 1) ROTC violates a

student's right to confidential coun
seling and advising; 2) ROTC re
stricts academic freedom by prema
turely determining a career path and
major for students; 3) undergradu
ates should not have their major de
termined by those who fund their
education, as ROTC demands; 4) the
power to set up teaching facilities on
campus in exchange for scholarships
sets a dangerous precedent for aca
demic control of the

University; 5) the necessity of the
current constitution of the U.S.
armed forces is in doubt. (I have an
upcoming article in the Stanford
Progressive elaborating on these
points, but one can read it now at
rotc.stanford.edu.)
I repeat, these are the objections
that appear in my letter only. Appar
ently others, such as SSQL, also have
their own issues with Stanford ac
commodating the military. I don't
suppose Stanford would want to be
known as the university that is oh-so
progressive on gay rights but is all
too willing to throw transgender stu
dents under the
bus?

The Daily's graphic of a soldier
on a multicolored backdrop is en
tirely appropriate for the situation.
Perhaps the U.S. military should
paint rainbows on their cruise mis
siles so that when the families of the
strike victims discover the charred
bodies of their loved ones, they can
reflect on the lofty ideals of egalitar
ianism and humanity that now per
meate the armed forces.
