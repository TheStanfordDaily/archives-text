# THIS COLUMN IS IRONIC
## Dr. Guiltypleasure or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Taylor Swift 
### Shane Savitsky 
Is it seriously Week 1 of the quar
ter already? That break went by
just a little too fast. Honestly, it's
probably for the best. I need to be
back here at Stanford being stu
dious. Not because my life devolves
into a sad mix of sloth and gluttony
over winter break (whose does
n't?), but rather because break al
lows me ample time to indulge all of
my guilty pleasures. And trust me, I
have a lot of guilty pleasures.
In fact, I'll tell you about a few
right now. I'm still not sure I should
admit most of what I'm about to
write to the Stanford campus as a
whole, but we're friends, right? This
relationship has been going on for
almost four months now, so I feel
like there's a lot you need to know
about me before we can take things
to the next level between us. So grab
a bag of Doritos and some ice cream
and read on:

Guilty Pleasure #1: Independence
Day

You're probably saying, "Shane,
how can you call one of the greatest
cinematic achievements of all time
a guilty pleasure?" I know where
you're coming from, but apparently,
a lot of people out there didn't like
this movie. Society has a name for
them: idiots. Let's put it this way
I'm pretty sure President Whit
more's climactic "TODAY, WE
CELEBRATE OUR INDEPEN
DENCE DAY!" speech influenced
the future 48th President of the
United States to run for office. We
call Barack one of the greatest ora
tors of our time, but I don't know if
he could pull off an impromptu
speech like that with an alien war
ship looming overhead.
Come on, Will Smith and Jeff
Goldblum commit alien genocide
together! I know it's coming up on
being 15 years old, but try to tell me

This is a dream that
my Stanford
education can never
help me to achieve.

you've seen a film with more re
watch value than this one. I should
know. I watched it twice over this
break alone, bringing my grand
total to 179 views. You read that cor
rectly. That means I've spent 18 days
of my life watching Independence
Day. I loved every minute of it all
26,000 of them.
Guilty Pleasure #2: Gossip Girl
This one is almost impossible to
defend among my friends. And I
don't even want to get into some of
the conversations I've had with my
dad about my Gossip Girl obses
sion. No one seems to care that it's a
television show packed with beauti
ful women. Apparently, if you have
a Y chromosome, you're not al
lowed to go near this show. This dis

crimination needs to stop. It's not
what America is about.
Seriously, have you seen Serena
van der Woodsen? Gossip Girl is
known for its fashion, but I'm not
even sure what she wears in half her
scenes count as clothes. That can
only be a good thing. Then there's
Blair Waldorf. In a recent episode,
she admitted to washing out her
wine glasses with L'Occitane sham
poo because dish soap just doesn't
cut it. I know that most normal peo
ple wouldn't count that among their
turn-ons, but this is my guilty pleas
ure for a reason. Please don't judge
me.
Guilty Pleasure #3: Taylor Swift
Every Christmas, my best friend
Sam and I exchange gifts. Now, she
probably knows me as well as any
one on the planet, so I always look
forward to her present. This year,
she got me a Taylor Swift T-shirt. I'd
like to pretend it was a gag gift, but
I'd just be lying to myself. It's pur
ple. It's a size large. Actually, I'm
pretty sure it's a women's large, I
still haven't decided if I can wear it
in public yet.
My life's dream is to have Taylor
Swift write a song about me. It would
ostensibly be about how I was the
perfect one for her and she let me get
away because let's be honest
the best Taylor Swift songs are the
bittersweet ones. Unfortunately, this
is a dream that my Stanford educa
tion can never help me to achieve.
It's solely up to my wit, charm and
good looks. Luckily, I've been
blessed with all three. Let's just hope
she never reads this column.

Do you think you're a better match
for Shane than Taylor Swift â€”even
after all that? Then you should prob
ably e-mail him at savitsky@stan
ford.edu.
