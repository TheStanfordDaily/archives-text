## STARTING WITH A SWEEP 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH STAFF WRITER 
The No. 4 Stanford men's volleyball team shook
off some early jitters against Division 111 power UC-
Santa Cruz before pulling away and winning its sea
son opener, 3-0, at Burnham Pavilion.
Cardinal head coach John Kosty was pleased
with the performance given that the team had not
been able to scout its opposition much and was
coming off a break.
"Santa Cruz is a good team, and we came into
this match needing to get competition besides what
we have in practice," he said. "That's exactly what
they gave us; it was a good chance to compete
against someone besides ourselves."
Junior Evan Barry had a nice game for the de
fending national champions, tallying 31 assists be
fore sitting much of the third set with the match in
hand.
"We needed to get into a groove and Santa Cruz
jumped off to a good start," Barry said. "But in the
end we found our rhythm, it just took longer than
we wanted it to."
Santa Cruz's fast start was helped by some excel
lent blocking up front, particularly by Thomas
Davidson, who led the Banana Slugs (0-1) early
with four kills and three blocks. However, Stanford
(1-0) fought back to tie the score late, perhaps with
the help of the referee who failed to see a touch out
of bounds by junior outside hitter Brad Lawson on
set point for Santa Cruz. The Cardinal fended off
three Santa Cruz set points and eventually won the
set, 28-26, on Barry's only kill of the night.
Redshirt junior outside hitter/opposite Garrett
Dobbs was pleased with Barry's play, but said he has
come to expect excellence from the first-year
starter.
"Evan played great, but I'm not at all surprised
because he is super dedicated both to the game and
the program," he said. "He always comes to practice
with a confidence that he can fill [graduated senior
setter and last year's AVCA player of the year
Kawika Shoji's] shoes and take us to a national
championship."
The second set saw Stanford take control early
with consecutive kills and a couple of Santa Cruz
miscues, but the Slugs rallied and gave Stanford
some problems again with several blocks.
The Cardinal responded, drawing energy from
its costumed fan section, and eventually Stanford's
talent and depth were simply too much for Santa
Cruz to handle. Sixteen players saw action and 10
registered at least one kill. The team didn't light up
the stat sheet, hitting a solid .256, but led by junior
libero Erik Shoji's 10 digs, Stanford held Santa Cruz
to a very poor .083 hitting percentage.

points in the middle of the second
set. Stanford won the set comfort
ably, 25-17.
With a 2-0 lead, the third set saw
several freshmen wet their feet in
the collegiate game, and they didn't
disappoint. Outside hitters Brian
Cook and Steven Irvin in particular
had good debuts, tallying seven and
five kills respectively.
"The whole experience was just
really fun and I am really happy to
be a part of the team and just happy
to be out there," Cook said. "It was
nice to come back from a bit of a
deficit because it showed that we
trust each other, and it's a good start
ing point for the rest of the season."
Kosty, too, was pleased with the
work of his freshman group.
"There's going to be some nerves
playing for the first time with a Stan
ford jersey on, but they worked
through it pretty fast and played a

nice game," he said.
It helped that the Slugs fell apart
a bit in the third set, making several
poor attempts and registering only
seven kills in the set, as Stanford
went on a nine-point run to lead by
as many as 12. The Cardinal closed
out the match, winning the final set,
25-14.
"The old saying 'get the rust out'
really applies here," Kosty said. "In
the first game we had to really tight
en our belts and catch some breaks.
But we were able to finish the game
strong."
Things will get much tougher
right away for the Cardinal, as BYU
comes to town on Jan. 14 for the
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation
(MPSF) opener.
"That's the fun part about the
MPSF," Kosty said. "It's always right
around the corner. We have six prac
tices and the alumni game to get
ready for our MPSF opener, and the
Cougars are going to be a good
team."

Junior libera Erik Shoji had 10 digs as Stanford started off its 2011 season with
a sweep of UC-Santa Cruz in Burnham Pavilion. The Cardinal is looking to
defend its 2010 national title despite losing three starters to graduation.
The No. 4 Stanford men's volleyball team shook
off some early jitters against Division 111 power UC-
Santa Cruz before pulling away and winning its sea
son opener, 3-0, at Burnham Pavilion.
Cardinal head coach John Kosty was pleased
with the performance given that the team had not
been able to scout its opposition much and was
coming off a break.
"Santa Cruz is a good team, and we came into
this match needing to get competition besides what
we have in practice," he said. "That's exactly what
they gave us; it was a good chance to compete
against someone besides ourselves."
Junior Evan Barry had a nice game for the de
fending national champions, tallying 31 assists be
fore sitting much of the third set with the match in
hand.
"We needed to get into a groove and Santa Cruz
jumped off to a good start," Barry said. "But in the
end we found our rhythm, it just took longer than
we wanted it to."
Santa Cruz's fast start was helped by some excel
lent blocking up front, particularly by Thomas
Davidson, who led the Banana Slugs (0-1) early
with four kills and three blocks. However, Stanford
(1-0) fought back to tie the score late, perhaps with
the help of the referee who failed to see a touch out
of bounds by junior outside hitter Brad Lawson on
set point for Santa Cruz. The Cardinal fended off
three Santa Cruz set points and eventually won the
set, 28-26, on Barry's only kill of the night.
Redshirt junior outside hitter/opposite Garrett
Dobbs was pleased with Barry's play, but said he has
come to expect excellence from the first-year
starter.
"Evan played great, but I'm not at all surprised
because he is super dedicated both to the game and
the program," he said. "He always comes to practice
with a confidence that he can fill [graduated senior
setter and last year's AVCA player of the year
Kawika Shoji's] shoes and take us to a national
championship."
The second set saw Stanford take control early
with consecutive kills and a couple of Santa Cruz
miscues, but the Slugs rallied and gave Stanford
some problems again with several blocks.
The Cardinal responded, drawing energy from
its costumed fan section, and eventually Stanford's
talent and depth were simply too much for Santa
Cruz to handle. Sixteen players saw action and 10
registered at least one kill. The team didn't light up
the stat sheet, hitting a solid .256, but led by junior
libero Erik Shoji's 10 digs, Stanford held Santa Cruz
to a very poor .083 hitting percentage.

points in the middle of the second
set. Stanford won the set comfort
ably, 25-17.
With a 2-0 lead, the third set saw
several freshmen wet their feet in
the collegiate game, and they didn't
disappoint. Outside hitters Brian
Cook and Steven Irvin in particular
had good debuts, tallying seven and
five kills respectively.
"The whole experience was just
really fun and I am really happy to
be a part of the team and just happy
to be out there," Cook said. "It was
nice to come back from a bit of a
deficit because it showed that we
trust each other, and it's a good start
ing point for the rest of the season."
Kosty, too, was pleased with the
work of his freshman group.
"There's going to be some nerves
playing for the first time with a Stan
ford jersey on, but they worked
through it pretty fast and played a

nice game," he said.
It helped that the Slugs fell apart
a bit in the third set, making several
poor attempts and registering only
seven kills in the set, as Stanford
went on a nine-point run to lead by
as many as 12. The Cardinal closed
out the match, winning the final set,
25-14.
"The old saying 'get the rust out'
really applies here," Kosty said. "In
the first game we had to really tight
en our belts and catch some breaks.
But we were able to finish the game
strong."
Things will get much tougher
right away for the Cardinal, as BYU
comes to town on Jan. 14 for the
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation
(MPSF) opener.
"That's the fun part about the
MPSF," Kosty said. "It's always right
around the corner. We have six prac
tices and the alumni game to get
ready for our MPSF opener, and the
Cougars are going to be a good
team."
