# FINDING THEIR GROOVE
## RED-HOT CARDINAL HOSTS ARIZONA 
### NATE ADAMS DESK EDITOR 
Their grueling non-conference season
may have left the Stanford women
scratching their heads at times, but with
2010 over, it's hard not to argue that the
Cardinal is hitting its stride. And with the
conference season getting into full gear as
it hosts a talented Arizona (11-2,2-0 Pac
-10) team tonight, the timing couldn't be
much better.

No. 4 Stanford (10-2,1-0) has made a
habit of scheduling plenty of top-25 oppo
nents early in the season, and this year, the
tough schedule left its mark on the Cardi
nal's record with a pair of losses against
DePaul and Tennessee. It isn't often that
Stanford, a winner of 10 straight confer
ence titles, finds itself on the wrong end of
a losing streak, even if it's only two games.
"We definitely have one of the tough
est schedules out there, and I think
that's something that definitely helps us

grow, no matter the outcome," said soph
omore forward Joslyn Tinkle. "We did
have a couple steps backward, but we re
ally did learn from it. As a team, we've re
ally improved since then, and I think play
ing these teams will help us in the long
run."
Whatever Stanford needed to learn, it
didn't take long. The Cardinal shocked
the nation with last week's 71-59 upset
