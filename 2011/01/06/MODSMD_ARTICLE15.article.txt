# FINDING THEIR GROOVE
## RED-HOT CARDINAL HOSTS ARIZONA 
### NATE ADAMS DESK EDITOR 
Their grueling non-conference season
may have left the Stanford women
scratching their heads at times, but with
2010 over, it's hard not to argue that the
Cardinal is hitting its stride. And with the
conference season getting into full gear as
it hosts a talented Arizona (11-2,2-0 Pac
-10) team tonight, the timing couldn't be
much better.

No. 4 Stanford (10-2,1-0) has made a
habit of scheduling plenty of top-25 oppo
nents early in the season, and this year, the
tough schedule left its mark on the Cardi
nal's record with a pair of losses against
DePaul and Tennessee. It isn't often that
Stanford, a winner of 10 straight confer
ence titles, finds itself on the wrong end of
a losing streak, even if it's only two games.
"We definitely have one of the tough
est schedules out there, and I think
that's something that definitely helps us

grow, no matter the outcome," said soph
omore forward Joslyn Tinkle. "We did
have a couple steps backward, but we re
ally did learn from it. As a team, we've re
ally improved since then, and I think play
ing these teams will help us in the long
run."
Whatever Stanford needed to learn, it
didn't take long. The Cardinal shocked
the nation with last week's 71-59 upset

The Stanford women's basketball team, led by Pac-10 player of the week Jeanette Pohlen, above, looks to use a recent surge
of momentum to remain undefeated in conference play.
over then-No. 1 Connecticut, which
hadn't lost in a record 90 contests
(including a pair of Final Four vic
tories over Stanford). That helped
move Stanford from No. 9 to No. 4,
single-handedly inspired a new T
shirt for fans and, most importantly,
gave the soul-searching Cardinal a
huge dose of optimism.
After Stanford's roller coaster
of a non-conference schedule, no
body on the team is more locked in
than Jeanette Pohlen. The senior
guard posted huge numbers over
the break, including a career-high
31 points against UConn. Her of
fensive tear was enough to rocket
her into first place on the team in
points per game, with 16.8. She was
named Pac-10 player of the week
yesterday for her efforts against
No. 4 Xavier, No. 1 UConn and
California.
"She's always been a solid,
heady player for us," Tinkle said.
"But this year I feel like she's been
a lot more aggressive offensively,
she's done such good job and she's
fun to be out there with. A lot of us
wouldn't have expected all of that
[scoring] from her, being in a tough
spot to get as many points at guard.
And it's not like she's taking every
shot out there; she just really knows
how to get open."
But Pohlen has hardly done it

alone. The Cardinal roster is noth
ing if not flexible this season, leav
ing head coach Tara VanDerveer
with a veritable smorgasbord of
lineup options on any given day.
And she hasn't been afraid to
change things up all but two of
her players are averaging over 10
minutes per game.
On paper, the team might seem
like it has too many options. But the
Cardinal has embraced the reality
of its roster, a team full of multi
taskers.
"A lot of us are playing all over,
and we're really versatile," Tinkle
said. "And I think that's kind of
working in our favor ... whether or
not we know what our role is, play
ing here or there, I think it's impor
tant that we know each other, our
personalities, what we do best. I
think that's helped us improve our
game as a whole, and take full ad
vantage [of] what we have."
As impressive as its victory
against UConn was, Stanford still
has plenty of dangerous teams to
look out for in the Pac-10. Among
the best of them is tonight's oppo
nent, Arizona.

The Wildcats, like Stanford, are
among four teams in the confer
ence with only one or two losses,
and have defeated their last six op
ponents by an average margin of
19.2 points. That includes a 109-94
effort on New Year's Eve against
Oregon, which leads the confer
ence in scoring with 89 points per
game and had just two losses en
tering the game.
It's been seven seasons since
Arizona began 11-2 and six since it
started the conference season with
two straight wins.
Marks like those would be im
pressive in any situation, but com
pared to how Arizona was faring
when it last faced Stanford, it's
downright surprising. The Wildcats
were 13-13 when they hosted the
Cardinal last February, a game they
dropped, 75-48.
Stanford's big hero from that
matchup, junior forward Nnemka
di Ogwumike, might be missing
from the lineup tonight. She left
with a shoulder injury after scoring
14 against Cal on Sunday, and it
isn't clear if she will be limited in
minutes tonight or out of the game
altogether. The last time she faced
the Wildcats, Ogwumike led her
team with nine rebounds and
added 15 points.
Four of the five Wildcat starters
from that game are back this sea
son, and three of them are getting
plenty of minutes and leading the
team in scoring. Senior forward Ify
Ibekwe is in the lead with 15.5
points per game, with sophomore
guard Davellyn Whyte right behind
her at 14.8. Soana Lucet, a senior
forward like Ibekwe, rounds out the
trio with 13.0 points per game.
The team has added only two
freshmen since last season, but even
with many of the same players, this
year's Arizona squad should pres
ent a whole new challenge.
Stanford will tip off against the
Wildcats tonight at 7 p.m. in Maples
Pavilion.
