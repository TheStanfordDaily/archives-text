# TOUGH ROAD AHEAD
## 
### ZACH ZIMMERMAN DESK EDITOR 
After dismantling Cat in its Pac
-10 season opener, the Stanford
men's basketball team continues its
conference season tonight when it
travels to the hostile confines of
Tempe to take on Arizona State.
The Cardinal (8-4, 1-0 Pac-10)
enters the game riding a two-game
winning streak. While the team has
yet to lose at home, away games
have proved difficult for a roster
consisting primarily of underclass
men. Stanford has won just one of
five road games on the season and
will face two of its toughest oppo
nents during this weekend's trip to
Arizona.
Cardinal head coach Johnny
Dawkins says his team, which has
won its two previous games by an
average of 15 points, is feeding off
the monumental wins by the Stan
ford football and women's basket
ball teams.
"It's exciting," Dawkins said.
"There's very much a team atmos
phere among the program. It's great
to be a part of that and these kids

want to leave their mark on the pro
gram."
Leading the charge for Stanford
is junior guard Jeremy Green,
whose lights-out shooting propelled
the Cardinal to a 62-48 win over the
Golden Bears on Jan. 2. Green led
all scorers with 21 points and con
tinues to improve his offensive effi
ciency and decision-making as the

season progresses.
Perhaps the biggest change to
the team in recent weeks is the pro
motion of freshman Aaron Bright
to the starting point guard position.
Bright's ball-handling and passing
abilities have been met with a vote
of confidence from his coach.
"I give a lot of credit to maturity
shown by Aaron," Dawkins said.
"I'm really proud of the players and
[we have received] key contribu
tions for the young kids."
One of Bright's classmates, for
ward Dwight Powell, has benefited
from his move to the bench. After
beginning the season as the team's
starting small forward, Powell has
flourished in his role as a reserve
and has demonstrated his flexibility
to play at either forward position.
Powell had 20 points and seven re
bounds in his last game and will
need to come out with similar ag
gression against a stout Arizona
State squad.
Cal head coach Mike Mont
gomery spoke of Powell's skill set
and the difficulty it will bring to con-
