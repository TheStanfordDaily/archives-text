## Graduate students look ahead to elections Council debates how to raise interest in officer positions 
### ANNA SCHUESSLER STAFF WRITER 
The Graduate Student Council (GSC)
began its first meeting of the new year with
programming that embraced the winter sea
son.
Andy Hernandez, assistant dean of the
Graduate Life Office, informed council mem
bers of an upcoming family ice-skating outing
slated for Jan. 22 and a graduate family bowl
ing night planned for Feb. 26. Hernandez re
quested funding for the two events, which
have both proved popular in the past. He has
already heard from more than 100 people
who have expressed interest in the skating
event.
"People with little children can even go
out in strollers and joggers," Hernandez said.
"It's a good way for graduate students with
families to meet each other."
ASSU Elections Commissioner Stephen
Trusheim 'l3 updated the council on the
events leading up to the student body elec
tions, which are scheduled for April 7-8. Ac
cording to Trusheim, the elections commis
sion will have to be creative with this year's
spending. After budget cuts dramatically
trimmed the commission's coffers, its officers
have been working to design efficient infor
mation sessions and candidates' nights to pro
vide accessible forums for candidates looking
to spread their messages.
"We'd really like to have your help in
drumming up interest in the elections
among the graduate community to have a
full Graduate Student Council again,"
Trusheim said.
ASSU President Angelina Cardona 'll
brought council members up to speed on
undergraduate measures. She along with
other student representatives are set to
briefly address the Faculty Senate in the
next few weeks. Cardona encouraged grad
uate students to inform her of any concerns
they wished her to bring before the Faculty
Senate, inviting them to e-mail or speak to
her personally about issues they found espe
cially compelling.
GSC secretary Erik Lehnert 'O7, Ph.D. 'l3,
proposed that the council reconsider its prac
tices with regard to preparing and informing
potential candidates for officer positions
within the council. Lehnert suggested that
members think about drafting transition doc
uments for their respective positions on the
council earlier in the year, as this process is
often hastened with the turnover of council
positions that takes place every April.
"It's just things like making sure the candi
date for secretary knows what the secretary
does before he or she runs that make a differ
ence," Lehnert said.
GSC co-chair Jessica Tsai 'OB M.D. 'l2
brought the meeting to an end by echoing the
election commission's plea for increased
graduate participation in the upcoming elec
tions.
"If you could start tapping people within
your schools, especially in the humanities,
such as education, law or business, that would
be great," Tsai said.
