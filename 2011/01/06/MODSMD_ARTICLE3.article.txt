# SNAPSHOT OF THE FUTURE
## Researcher making strides in high-tech photography 
### ERIN INMAN STAFF WRITER 
Imagine taking pictures at a soccer game.
Currently photographers have two main op
tions: set the camera to sports mode or manu
ally adjust its settings to create a good shot. But
what if you could buy an app for your camera
whose sole purpose is to keep the soccer ball in
focus?
This camera industry revolution one
that might lead to app stores for cameras
could be made possible by
the Stanford Comput- mtI —
er Graphics Labo
ratory's cur-

rent research in computational photography.
Computational photography, a term coined
by professor of computer science and electri
cal engineering Marc Levoy, refers to the use
of "sensing strategies or algorithmic tech
niques to enhance or extend the capabilities of
digital photography."
Such enhancements include high dynamic
range (HDR), panoramas and all-focus imag
ing. HDR preserves detail in the brightest and
dimmest areas of a photograph, panoramas
stitch together a scene only a wide-angle lens
could capture and all-focus imaging pre
serves camera focus at all depths of a
scene.
While these enhancements
are possible on a computer pro
gram such as Photoshop, relying
solely on a computer program pro
vides no immediate feedback on the
device, according to Andrew Adams
Ph.D. '11, a lab assistant and graduate
student in computer science.
"Perhaps the panorama is missing a
corner," Adams said. "You realize this
only after the computer program
stitches the shots together."
Additionally, when taking a burst of
pictures, the images are slow to acquire.
According to Adams, however, an al
gorithm in the camera could change
camera settings faster than a human
hand.
Due to the limitations of
immediate feedback and time, the
lab creates algorithms capable of
producing raw images of similar
quality to those of photo editing
programs.

Adams presented the example of an indoor
party, a scene with not much light. The perfect
shot necessitates a fusion between two differ
ent shots: one short, low exposure and one long
exposure. An algorithm, he said, can take both
shots successively and fuse the images into one
raw image.
He also gave the example of an individual
taking pictures with a long exposure in a set
ting bound to yield blur. According to Adams,
an algorithm could take eight successive shots
and save only the least blurred.
Adams noted how cameras, although noto
rious for being the "most übiquitous comput
ers out there," are currently not programming
friendly.
Levoy agreed, adding that researchers out
side of the industry are "clueless as to how ex
isting camera modes [night, sports, portrait,
etc.] work."
"The camera industry creates beautiful pic
tures, but they're mysterious," Adams said.
Since no open-source camera existed, the
Stanford lab drew on the financial support of
Nokia, Adobe Systems, Kodak and Hewlett-
Packard, to create the Frakencamera. The
camera, featuring Linux operating systems, al
lows the lab to create and test their own algo
rithms.
Currently the lab plans to distribute Frak
encameras to other universities to "push the
API out there and see what people can do,"
Adams said.
While Frakencamera serves the purpose
of developing algorithms in the research in
dustry, it specifically is not seen as the future
of the camera industry. Instead, the lab hopes
to "influence industry partners to open their
cameras' interfaces," Levoy said.

caught on for open-source consumer cell

phone cameras, as evidenced by a
look at the iTunes app store, Levoy
acknowledged that the camera in
dustry has yet to embrace the tech
nology.
While companies have adopted
computational photography tricks
such as HDR and panorama modes
into closed-source cameras, an
open-source camera has yet to be
announced, let alone made available
to consumers.
