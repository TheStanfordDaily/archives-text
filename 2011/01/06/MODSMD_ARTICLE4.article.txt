## Local senator authors new cyberbullying law 
### MARIANNE LEVINE STAFF WRITER 
Senate Bill 1411, authored by
Sen. Joe Simitian, D-Palo Alto,
confronts the new dangers of so
cial networking websites such as
Myspace and Facebook. In effect
since Jan. 1, the law makes online

impersonation intended to
"harm, intimidate or defraud"
someone illegal. Offenders may
face up to a year in prison and a
$l,OOO fine.
Although SB 1411 confronts a
significant problem in the digital
age, it has received criticism from
some legal scholars alleging the

new law could infringe on the
First Amendment right to free
speech. The law attempts to ad
dress this problem through a
clause stating that parody or
satire is acceptable and that mali
cious intent must be apparent.
Ryan Calo, the director of the
Consumer Privacy Project at Stan

ford Law School, warns that the
line between harmful intent and
satire remains blurred. It's difficult
to point exactly to acts of imper
sonation that are threatening, in
timidating or defrauding, accord
ing to Calo.
"Reasonable people will dis
agree whether an impersonation

falls within these categories," Calo
said.
Although the bill provides both
a criminal penalty and a civil action
penalty for online impersonation,
Calo believes the law's vagueness
allows for misinterpretation.
