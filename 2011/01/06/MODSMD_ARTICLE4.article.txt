## Local senator authors new cyberbullying law 
### MARIANNE LEVINE STAFF WRITER 
Senate Bill 1411, authored by
Sen. Joe Simitian, D-Palo Alto,
confronts the new dangers of so
cial networking websites such as
Myspace and Facebook. In effect
since Jan. 1, the law makes online

impersonation intended to
"harm, intimidate or defraud"
someone illegal. Offenders may
face up to a year in prison and a
$l,OOO fine.
Although SB 1411 confronts a
significant problem in the digital
age, it has received criticism from
some legal scholars alleging the

new law could infringe on the
First Amendment right to free
speech. The law attempts to ad
dress this problem through a
clause stating that parody or
satire is acceptable and that mali
cious intent must be apparent.
Ryan Calo, the director of the
Consumer Privacy Project at Stan

ford Law School, warns that the
line between harmful intent and
satire remains blurred. It's difficult
to point exactly to acts of imper
sonation that are threatening, in
timidating or defrauding, accord
ing to Calo.
"Reasonable people will dis
agree whether an impersonation

falls within these categories," Calo
said.
Although the bill provides both
a criminal penalty and a civil action
penalty for online impersonation,
Calo believes the law's vagueness
allows for misinterpretation.
"The danger is that people will
do something that is funny or con
troversial that might possibly fall
under this law," Calo said. "It's not
realistic to think that this will focus
on the crime that we're worried
about."
He suggests, for example, that
private litigates may use the law as
a reason to justify lawsuits that
would otherwise be unfounded.
Despite the criticisms legal
scholars have of SB 1411, Calo ac
knowledges the bill sends a signal
to potential cyberbullies that their
actions can result in serious legal
consequences.
He stresses, however, that SB
1411 is just one solution to the
growing problem of online imper
sonation and emphasized the need
for private entities to act more re
sponsibly online.
"Laws are not the only way to
address this behavior," Calo said.
"Companies could do more to cut
down on harmful behavior on
line."
