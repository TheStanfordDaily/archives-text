## SALSA! Los Salseros de Stanford spice up Stanford community 
### OLIVIA SMONE JEW 
It's a regular Wednesday night
at the Axe and Palm. Students
sit in red leather booths eating,
chatting and studying. But
something about the scene is
different.
In the main room that would
normally house more students,
salsa music blasts. An eclectic
group of Stanford students and
Palo Alto locals dance in pairs as
two experienced students repeat
the counts: "1,2,3, turn ... 5, 6,7."
Those new to salsa laugh self-dep
recatingly as their arms and feet
twist awkwardly while the instruc
tors give words of advice and en
couragement in one of the weekly
salsa lessons sponsored by Los
Salseros de Stanford, Stanford's
only salsa-performing team.
Directed by Ariana Borgaily 'l2
and Diogenes Brito 'll, Los Salseros
performs at cultural diversity fairs,
campus fundraisers, such as Salsa for
the Cure, and other dance events,
and it puts on an annual spring show.
The club of 18 women and 16 men
rehearses for two hours twice a week
in Roble Gym. Los Salseros also
holds free weekly beginner and in
termediate lessons for students and
local residents, as well as free bi
weekly salsa socials, where anyone
can come for a salsa lesson and then
a salsa dance party.
For the two directors, being in Los
Salseros and dancing salsa in general
has been gratifying. Brito, who is half
Dominican and half Colombian,
grew up listening to salsa music and,
with an interest in the music and in
joining a dance group on campus, de
cided to audition. Borgaily, on the
other hand, grew up around quite a
bit of dancing in El Paso, Texas; she
started salsa at 13 years old and saw

Los Salseros in the Dance Expo
show during Admit Weekend. Both
directors have been involved with
Los Salseros since freshman year,
and both are in their second year as
club directors.
The range of Brito and Borgaily's
levels of previous experience with
salsa dance mirror the diversity of
experience in the rest of the club.
"[There's] a lot of variety on the
team," Borgaily said. "We have peo
ple who had never heard of salsa
until they came here, and we have
people who had grown up with it for
forever... I'd say it's a pretty nice
mix of people."
Borgaily noted that the skill level
of the group tends to vary from year
to year, depending on the pool of
dancers who audition.
"At least 80 people auditioned
this year, and only 13 made it on the
team, so it's pretty competitive," she
said, adding that in auditions, they
look for dancers' potential, style and
ability to perform.
While some students have
danced salsa since youth and have
participated in salsa competitions,
others come in with hardly any expe
rience, merely a willingness to learn
something new. Two such examples
are Ronnie Tisdale TO, a coterminal
student, and Caroline Ferguson 'l4.
"To have this opportunity is just
incredible," Tisdale said. "[There's]
solidarity for me being in a group
where everyone loves it. It's a skill
everyone deep inside wants to have .
.. it's the culture for me. I just love
being in the environment. I can prac
tice my Spanish, and I love the music
and the dancing."
"It's something I always wanted
to try," Ferguson said. "I had never
danced salsa before. I did a lot of hip
hop and tap classes, but I just wanted
to try. It looks really cool, and every
one is really, really nice and good

about correcting you."
Indeed, at rehearsals, a strong
sense of community exists between
members. As they filed into the
brightly lit studio, they cheerily start
ed pairing up and dancing to salsa
infused versions of songs by Justin
Timberlake and Maroon 5, doing
dips and turns and reviewing chore
ography from previous rehearsals.
"I like to think it's a really good
community, a social group with a
salsa problem," Brito said. "We per
form and stuff... but I think it's re
ally about becoming a better social

dancer, because this is one of the few
things you can do after college. I
mean, every major city has salsa
clubs and has a salsa community ...
and it's cool to be able to have an
outside group of friends here. My
year, I felt like everyone was super
nice when I joined, and since then, I
think other people have felt the
same way."
Borgaily described a salsa outing
some of the members took in No
vember to the International Salsa
Congress in San Francisco, an annu
al cultural event where people from

all over the world travel to a differ
ent city to take workshops, watch
performances and enjoy Latin food.
With large salsa communities and
events like this going on around the
Bay Area, Los Salseros aims to
"spread the knowledge of salsa," in
the words of Borgaily.
"As the only salsa group on cam
pus ... trying to get a little bit of that
here on campus within our little bub
ble is important."

recatingly as their arms and feet
twist awkwardly while the instruc
tors give words of advice and en
couragement in one of the weekly
salsa lessons sponsored by Los
Salseros de Stanford, Stanford's
only salsa-performing team.
Directed by Ariana Borgaily 'l2
and Diogenes Brito 'll, Los Salseros
performs at cultural diversity fairs,
campus fundraisers, such as Salsa for
the Cure, and other dance events,
and it puts on an annual spring show.
The club of 18 women and 16 men
rehearses for two hours twice a week
in Roble Gym. Los Salseros also
holds free weekly beginner and in
termediate lessons for students and
local residents, as well as free bi
weekly salsa socials, where anyone
can come for a salsa lesson and then
a salsa dance party.
For the two directors, being in Los
Salseros and dancing salsa in general
has been gratifying. Brito, who is half
Dominican and half Colombian,
grew up listening to salsa music and,
with an interest in the music and in
joining a dance group on campus, de
cided to audition. Borgaily, on the
other hand, grew up around quite a
bit of dancing in El Paso, Texas; she
started salsa at 13 years old and saw

Los Salseros in the Dance Expo
show during Admit Weekend. Both
directors have been involved with
Los Salseros since freshman year,
and both are in their second year as
club directors.
The range of Brito and Borgaily's
levels of previous experience with
salsa dance mirror the diversity of
experience in the rest of the club.
"[There's] a lot of variety on the
team," Borgaily said. "We have peo
ple who had never heard of salsa
until they came here, and we have
people who had grown up with it for
forever... I'd say it's a pretty nice
mix of people."
Borgaily noted that the skill level
of the group tends to vary from year
to year, depending on the pool of
dancers who audition.
"At least 80 people auditioned
this year, and only 13 made it on the
team, so it's pretty competitive," she
said, adding that in auditions, they
look for dancers' potential, style and
ability to perform.
While some students have
danced salsa since youth and have
participated in salsa competitions,
others come in with hardly any expe
rience, merely a willingness to learn
something new. Two such examples
are Ronnie Tisdale TO, a coterminal
student, and Caroline Ferguson 'l4.
"To have this opportunity is just
incredible," Tisdale said. "[There's]
solidarity for me being in a group
where everyone loves it. It's a skill
everyone deep inside wants to have .
.. it's the culture for me. I just love
being in the environment. I can prac
tice my Spanish, and I love the music
and the dancing."
"It's something I always wanted
to try," Ferguson said. "I had never
danced salsa before. I did a lot of hip
hop and tap classes, but I just wanted
to try. It looks really cool, and every
one is really, really nice and good

about correcting you."
Indeed, at rehearsals, a strong
sense of community exists between
members. As they filed into the
brightly lit studio, they cheerily start
ed pairing up and dancing to salsa
infused versions of songs by Justin
Timberlake and Maroon 5, doing
dips and turns and reviewing chore
ography from previous rehearsals.
"I like to think it's a really good
community, a social group with a
salsa problem," Brito said. "We per
form and stuff... but I think it's re
ally about becoming a better social

dancer, because this is one of the few
things you can do after college. I
mean, every major city has salsa
clubs and has a salsa community ...
and it's cool to be able to have an
outside group of friends here. My
year, I felt like everyone was super
nice when I joined, and since then, I
think other people have felt the
same way."
Borgaily described a salsa outing
some of the members took in No
vember to the International Salsa
Congress in San Francisco, an annu
al cultural event where people from

all over the world travel to a differ
ent city to take workshops, watch
performances and enjoy Latin food.
With large salsa communities and
events like this going on around the
Bay Area, Los Salseros aims to
"spread the knowledge of salsa," in
the words of Borgaily.
"As the only salsa group on cam
pus ... trying to get a little bit of that
here on campus within our little bub
ble is important."
