## THE 						CAMPUS BEAT Room for a Tune 
### Lucas Will Johnson 
Stanford is nothing without its
buildings, from the gorgeous
Main Quad to Hoover Tower
to our impressive sports and engi
neering accommodations. Half the
reason a lot of people wind up on
the Farm is its setting the good
weather and the architectural beau
ty. And the building boom contin
ues, one construction project after
another. So how do our music facil
ities rank amid the high standard of
the sandstone arches?
Fortunately, Stanford has been
improving them. The LSJUMB has
a new industrial-strength Shak
suited for all types of abuse, the
Bings have generously assisted in
financing a new world-class con
cert hall and the Knoll has been
outfitted nicely for all sorts of com
puter music, Braun Music Center
itself was an upgrade a couple
decades ago.
We've got some good things
going on, so what are the setbacks?
Let's start by imagining you're back
at the beginning of freshman year.
You've played an instrument and
want to keep it up while in college.
Where can you practice? If you
want to put together a small band,
where could you rehearse? Few
dorms have practice rooms, and
though Stanford is good about plac
ing pianos everywhere, many are in
inadequate condition. Hoping for
some help, you trundle over to the
music department.
Practice rooms turn out to have
a fee. Over four years, it calculates
that you could just buy yourself a
cheap drum set at the cost of prac
ticing it. Perhaps you decide to
sign up for lessons while you're at
it. They cost $550 per quarter for
non-majors? At $55 a lesson, that's
not as extreme as some private les
sons go, but on top of tuition, it
feels like you just bought an ex
pensive plane ticket and ran into
another hidden fee.
And how about group spaces?
Unless you're in a music depart
ment-sponsored group and get time
and space allotted automatically,
you realize you'll have to be cre
ative in finding places to rehearse.
In Cardinal Calypso, after a couple
years of scrounging around for re
hearsal space, we managed to find a
good friend in Roble, where we can
store our pans and practice. But tak
ing over dorm lounges isn't optimal
(nor always fair to residents). And
louder groups like rock bands don't
have the luxury of their parents'
garage anymore; instead they have
to hope one of the few houses with
a decent rehearsal room is willing to
share. Not to mention transporta
tion difficulties for freshmen who
aren't supposed to have cars but
play large instruments.
Suffice to say, when you get to
campus, the buildings don't imme
diately say, "You can easily practice
music here!"

To be fair, I am not blaming the
music department on the fees or fa

cilities, because they're not neces
sarily their fault. They make lessons
and practice rooms available to all
students, which I don't think every
college does. Instead I take issue
with our priorities more broadly.
We all get free Web space and any
one can use the gym for no-cost,
small examples of how Stanford's
engineering and athletics are stellar
and have been cultivated for a long
time. Music and the arts, on the
other hand ...
Exactly how University-wide
budgeting decisions are made, I
have not researched. So perhaps
there are constraints beyond any
one's control that leave music less
financially and architecturally sup
ported than other disciplines. But to
whatever extent the administration
has control, I urge for a continued
focus on how to improve the music
facilities. And I am not suggesting a
sacrifice of other parts of the school
(or budget) for music; we should
work on independently building up
the portion devoted to the arts.
Yes, yes, I know that every de
partment and program thinks it
needs more resources and support.
I'm playing the part of a self-inter
ested musician. But there are a lot
of us. And many musicians don't
major in music, so when obstacles
pop up, it's easy to give up and take
fewer lessons or forgo an audition.
Then, music on campus suffers as a
whole. So I say, keep up the im
provements. I'll be sure to come
back after graduating to see Bing
Concert Hall when it's finished.

If you think new money should just
go to charity, tell Lucas at lucaswj@
stanford.edu.

You'll have to
be creative in
finding places
to rehearse.
