Understanding Buddhist Art: Calligraphy as an Expression of Buddhism
KIK Timahasln
Can you express your feeling in one line?
Can you show your presence in one line?
What kind of meditative process is reflected in calligraphy?
In this talk which has drawn thousands of people internationally
over the years Kaz Tanahashi will introduce the history, aesthetics,
techniques, and practice of East Asian calligraphy through the exploration
of a single ideograph in a variety of forms: wu in Chinese and mu in
Japanese meaning "no," "not," or "beyond." This character frequently
appears in the Heart Sutra, the most widely recited text in Mahayana
Buddhism. Using his new translation of the sutra, Tanahashi will
explain this word's meanings in different context. He will then discuss
how this character came to represent a central teaching in Zen and
how it has been rendered in brushwork.
