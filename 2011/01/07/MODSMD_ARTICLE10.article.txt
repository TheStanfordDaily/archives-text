## Obama administration aims to get more Asians in business 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Cassandra Feliciano 
President Obama's Advisory
Commission on Asian Americans
and Pacific Islanders (AAPIs)
kicked off a campaign today to
promote entrepreneurial growth
among AAPIs. The 9 a.m. summit,
held on the Microsoft campus in
Mountain View, is part of the
White House Initiative on Asian
Americans and Pacific Islanders.
The Initiative was created
under the Clinton administration
as a response to grassroots efforts
to address health disparity issues,
a problem that the advisory com
mission is still working to address,
said commission chair Daphne
Kwok.
Since then, the project has ex
panded to address other problems
like bullying and the "model mi
nority myth."
While the need for more Asian
entrepreneurs may not make
sense in Silicon Valley, where a
large majority of the tech compa
ny bigwigs come from this demo
graphic group, Kwok said AAPIs
still face obstacles, especially in
places outside of the Valley.
"There are many parts of the
community with huge drop-out
rates and high poverty rates,"
Kwok said. "We need to make
sure [AAPIs] have access to poli
cies and programs, and that we're
included in their development."
In fact, Kwok added, most
AAPI business owners, who rep
resent 10 percent of the country's
entrepreneurs, do not have access
to loan contracts or capital.
The advisory commission,
which is expecting a full crowd for
today, will use the four-hour long
event to guide their plan of action
for the rest of this campaign.
