## BUILDING IT BIGGER Design comes to life at the Product Realization Lab 
### YIBAISHU 
For Ankur Shah 'll, a me
chanical engineering stu
dent, the Product Realiza
tion Lab has been the "bread
and butter" of his time on the
Farm. Shah started working in the lab
during his junior year, but continues
to work on projects in the lab on a reg
ular basis.

"A lot of my project classes took
place in the lab," Shah said. "Some
times I went there at the end of the
quarter for projects. Sometimes I had
to spend much more time on it for
example, when I was taking ME 203,
Manufacturing and Design. But I to
tally loved it."

The lab is housed in Mechanical
Engineering 610, conveniently locat

ed just across the street from the Axe
and Palm. At the lab, a light is almost
always on. People swirl in and out of
the building and the noise of buzzing
machines reverberates throughout.
Professor of mechanical engineer
ing David Beach, a co-director of the
lab who has been working at Stanford
for 39 years, described the lab as one
of the most unique teaching projects
in the world.
Most engineering students have
some experience taking courses in the
lab, such as Manufacturing and De
sign, Medical Devices Design and
Computer-Aided Product Creation.
But the lab is much more than a place
for students to do coursework.
Students can pay $lB4 a quarter
for access to the lab facilities from 8
a.m. to 11 p.m., 15 hours a day, seven
days a week. Most choose to spend

more time in the lab than their classes
require.
Under the philosophy that Stan
ford graduates should not only be
good citizens but also excel in a pro
fession, "making things" has been an
important part of a Stanford engi
neering education, Beach said.
Every year more than 500 stu
dents, from freshmen to doctoral stu
dents, use the lab. Two thirds of the
people who use the lab are under
graduates. Sign-up is simple, and the
shop-license fee is relatively afford
able, given the array of high-tech ma
chines and equipment available,
Beach said.
Students from any major at Stan
ford, whether mechanical engineer
ing, material science, product design
or even English can pursue projects at
the lab. Final products can range from
skateboards, guitars and golf putters
to complex machines.
While many of the projects are re
lated to students' research, some are
simply an extension of students' hob
bies.
"We don't tell people what to do
here," said Craig Milroy, professor of
mechanical engineering and associate
director of the lab. "We help them do
what they want to do."
Milroy described how his mechan
ical-device design class uses the lab.
For the course, Milroy brought in

doctors to work with 10 different stu
dent teams on developing medical de
vices. For example, one team worked
with a physician to develop new tools
for tonsil removal operations.
For many students, one of the
biggest perks of the lab is access to its
machinery.
"The cool thing is that we have
standard equipments, and we have
[the] best equipments in the world,"
said Peter Miller, a graduate student
in mechanical engineering and a
teaching assistant for ME 203. Some
of the lab's cutting-edge machines
have even won world competitions.
For example, the laser CAMM can
be programmed to cut out any shape
in a wide range of materials, from fruit
to plastic. The lab also features one
Haas 3-Axis VF-0 machine. Apple
uses 4,000 of these machines to make
iPods, iPhones and all the Macbook
models.

Collectively, the lab's machines are
capable of producing almost anything
that could be manufactured in a real
factory.
The lab has often served as a step
ping-stone for students interested in
innovative entrepreneurship. Stu
dents sometimes get patents for proj
ects they worked on in the lab. Others
generated ideas and found team
mates while working in the lab with
whom they later worked to build their

own enterprises.
Most importantly, students have
been using the knowledge and experi
ence they gained to benefit people
around the world, particularly in de
veloping countries.
"We've got two teaching assistants
working on a device for children from
Cambodia as a foot replacement,"
Milroy said.
A course named Entrepreneurial
Design for Extreme Affordability
often receives attention for its social
entrepreneurship projects. It is a grad
uate-level project course where stu
dents design solutions to challenges
faced by the world's poor.
Some of the successful projects,
such as Mighty Light, have been
used worldwide and have been
helping people in countries such as
India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Pana
ma, Guatemala, Rwanda and South
Africa. The the lab can claim much
of the credit for several of those
projects.
Another successful project incu
bated in the lab is Driptech, an ex
tremely low-cost water-efficient irri
gation system for small-plot farmers
in developing nations. Its low-tech
design eliminates about 90 percent
of all the parts of a traditional drip
per system.

Each year more than 500 undergraduate and graduate Stanford students
work on innovative projects at the state-of-the-art Product Realization
Lab located in Mechanical Engineering 160.
Many Stanford graduates from
the lab go on to work in highly inno
vative engineering teams after grad
uation. According to Beach, about
40 percent of the engineering staff
at Tesla Motors are lab alums. Both
of the co-founders of Icon Aircrafts
are, too.
The lab's success has inspired the
formation of similar creative work
spaces in other Stanford engineer
ing buildings, such as Room 36 in
Huang Engineering Center, as well
as commercial workshops beyond

campus in Oakland and Menlo
Park.
Although many universities
have created similar labs, the caliber
of Stanford's remains unrivaled,
Beach said, noting that the number
of students who use the lab and the
degree of integration between de
sign and manufacturing.
Beach said that the emphasis on
constructing actual projects as op
posed to only conceptualizing de
signs on a computer screen is what
makes Stanford's product realiza
tion lab so special.
"Engineers and designers are
much more powerful if they have
built things," he said.

spaces in other Stanford engineer
ing buildings, such as Room 36 in
Huang Engineering Center, as well
as commercial workshops beyond

campus in Oakland and Menlo
Park.
Although many universities
have created similar labs, the caliber
of Stanford's remains unrivaled,
Beach said, noting that the number
of students who use the lab and the
degree of integration between de
sign and manufacturing.
Beach said that the emphasis on
constructing actual projects as op
posed to only conceptualizing de
signs on a computer screen is what
makes Stanford's product realiza
tion lab so special.
"Engineers and designers are
much more powerful if they have
built things," he said.

For Ankur Shah 'll, a me
chanical engineering stu
dent, the Product Realiza
tion Lab has been the "bread
and butter" of his time on the
Farm. Shah started working in the lab
during his junior year, but continues
to work on projects in the lab on a reg
ular basis.

"A lot of my project classes took
place in the lab," Shah said. "Some
times I went there at the end of the
quarter for projects. Sometimes I had
to spend much more time on it for
example, when I was taking ME 203,
Manufacturing and Design. But I to
tally loved it."

The lab is housed in Mechanical
Engineering 610, conveniently locat

ed just across the street from the Axe
and Palm. At the lab, a light is almost
always on. People swirl in and out of
the building and the noise of buzzing
machines reverberates throughout.
Professor of mechanical engineer
ing David Beach, a co-director of the
lab who has been working at Stanford
for 39 years, described the lab as one
of the most unique teaching projects
in the world.
Most engineering students have
some experience taking courses in the
lab, such as Manufacturing and De
sign, Medical Devices Design and
Computer-Aided Product Creation.
But the lab is much more than a place
for students to do coursework.
Students can pay $lB4 a quarter
for access to the lab facilities from 8
a.m. to 11 p.m., 15 hours a day, seven
days a week. Most choose to spend

more time in the lab than their classes
require.
Under the philosophy that Stan
ford graduates should not only be
good citizens but also excel in a pro
fession, "making things" has been an
important part of a Stanford engi
neering education, Beach said.
Every year more than 500 stu
dents, from freshmen to doctoral stu
dents, use the lab. Two thirds of the
people who use the lab are under
graduates. Sign-up is simple, and the
shop-license fee is relatively afford
able, given the array of high-tech ma
chines and equipment available,
Beach said.
Students from any major at Stan
ford, whether mechanical engineer
ing, material science, product design
or even English can pursue projects at
the lab. Final products can range from
skateboards, guitars and golf putters
to complex machines.
While many of the projects are re
lated to students' research, some are
simply an extension of students' hob
bies.
"We don't tell people what to do
here," said Craig Milroy, professor of
mechanical engineering and associate
director of the lab. "We help them do
what they want to do."
Milroy described how his mechan
ical-device design class uses the lab.
For the course, Milroy brought in

doctors to work with 10 different stu
dent teams on developing medical de
vices. For example, one team worked
with a physician to develop new tools
for tonsil removal operations.
For many students, one of the
biggest perks of the lab is access to its
machinery.
"The cool thing is that we have
standard equipments, and we have
[the] best equipments in the world,"
said Peter Miller, a graduate student
in mechanical engineering and a
teaching assistant for ME 203. Some
of the lab's cutting-edge machines
have even won world competitions.
For example, the laser CAMM can
be programmed to cut out any shape
in a wide range of materials, from fruit
to plastic. The lab also features one
Haas 3-Axis VF-0 machine. Apple
uses 4,000 of these machines to make
iPods, iPhones and all the Macbook
models.

Collectively, the lab's machines are
capable of producing almost anything
that could be manufactured in a real
factory.
The lab has often served as a step
ping-stone for students interested in
innovative entrepreneurship. Stu
dents sometimes get patents for proj
ects they worked on in the lab. Others
generated ideas and found team
mates while working in the lab with
whom they later worked to build their

own enterprises.
Most importantly, students have
been using the knowledge and experi
ence they gained to benefit people
around the world, particularly in de
veloping countries.
"We've got two teaching assistants
working on a device for children from
Cambodia as a foot replacement,"
Milroy said.
A course named Entrepreneurial
Design for Extreme Affordability
often receives attention for its social
entrepreneurship projects. It is a grad
uate-level project course where stu
dents design solutions to challenges
faced by the world's poor.
Some of the successful projects,
such as Mighty Light, have been
used worldwide and have been
helping people in countries such as
India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Pana
ma, Guatemala, Rwanda and South
Africa. The the lab can claim much
of the credit for several of those
projects.
Another successful project incu
bated in the lab is Driptech, an ex
tremely low-cost water-efficient irri
gation system for small-plot farmers
in developing nations. Its low-tech
design eliminates about 90 percent
of all the parts of a traditional drip
per system.

Each year more than 500 undergraduate and graduate Stanford students
work on innovative projects at the state-of-the-art Product Realization
Lab located in Mechanical Engineering 160.
Many Stanford graduates from
the lab go on to work in highly inno
vative engineering teams after grad
uation. According to Beach, about
40 percent of the engineering staff
at Tesla Motors are lab alums. Both
of the co-founders of Icon Aircrafts
are, too.
