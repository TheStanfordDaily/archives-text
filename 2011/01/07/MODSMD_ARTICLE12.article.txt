## EDITORIAL Unfinished Business 
### 
So much has been written
about Andrew Luck in the
past few weeks speculating
about his future, but it appears to
have all been for naught. Luck an
nounced that "[he is] committed to
earning [his] degree in architectur
al design from Stanford University
and [is] on track to accomplish this
at the completion of the spring
quarter of 2012." The Editorial
Board would like to take this op
portunity to say what every Stan
ford Football fan is thinking:
"THANK GOD."

We applaud Luck for making
the decision to emphasize the "stu
dent" in student-athlete and for up
holding the spirit of college athlet
ics that is, the emphasis on the
team and the university. He for
went millions of dollars to play an
other season with his teammates
and to finish his studies. In a year
when some of college football's
brightest stars and most storied
programs have been marred by the
morally ambiguous actions of play
ers, boosters and family members,
Luck has been the rarest of things:
a morally upright, likable football
star. Girls think he's cute; guys want
to have a beer with him. His humil
ity can lead to less-than-riveting in
terviews, but that is not a legitimate
fault. Both on the field and in the
classroom, Luck has been an elo
quent spokesman for the great
virtues of this university. The Edito
rial Board is proud to have Andrew
Luck represent Stanford to sports
fans across the country.
Now the other question re
mains: What will Jim Harbaugh
do? Reports of Harbaugh's depar
ture have been consistently circu
lating since last season with each

"expert" being surer than the last.
There are also reports of a new con
tract offered by Stanford athletic
director Bob Bowlsby that would
substantially increase Harbaugh's
compensation, although Stanford
cannot compete with the pay arms
race that is the NFL. Stanford is a
world-renowned university for its
academics, and it has a history of
excelling in sports, albeit typically
not in football. Given such prece
dent, fan expectations are general
ly not high, and we would not try to
run him out of town for losing a few
games here and there, leeway he
would not get at most other univer
sities or professional jobs. Har
baugh has the option to build a dy
nasty of his own making at Stan
ford and we at the Editorial Board
hope he chooses to do so.
So what lies ahead for these
two? Unfinished business. Luck is
instantly a preseason favorite for
the Heisman Trophy, and Stanford
should begin the season nationally
ranked.The Pac-12 will play its first
season and will be Harbaugh's best
chance to deliver the first of "multi
ple conference championships,"
one of the goals he laid out at his in
troductory press conference four
years ago. Four years ago no one
believed that an FCS coach could
take a 1-11 football team and turn it
into a BCS bowl-winning team in
four years. We want to see what he
would do with a fifth year. Regard
less of Harbaugh's decision, Luck's
decision is a breath of fresh air for
college athletics. The 2010 season
was nothing short of historic (2011
Orange Bowl Champions!), but
should Coach Harbaugh return
next season, everything would in
deed be "All Right Now!"
