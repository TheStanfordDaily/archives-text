# OH! SWEET NUTHIN
## Greatest American Rock Band 
### Roseann Cima 
Classic rock. Think about it. The
British have the Beatles and
the Who.
The Stones feel like they should
be American because they're bluesy.
But they're not.
Led Zeppelin ... is also British.
Pink Floyd? Nope.
Cream! Why not Cream?!
It took me this long to hit The
Doors and Jefferson Airplane, who
are American Bands through and
through. And they're good, but by no
means better than Zeppelin, (or
Cream or Pink Floyd). And even the
second tier/generation of Good
Rock Bands is pretty dominated by
Non-Americans. AC/DC's Aus
tralian. Motorhead. The Sex Pistols.
Black Sabbath.
And I think of rock and roll as
such an American sound! I mean, we
invented it, in the sense that our po
litical system treated a certain race of
people badly enough they had to sing
the blues, which, when combined
with enough sex, drugs and electrici
ty, turned into rock and roll (an apoc
ryphal history). It should be ours!
The Solo Act seems to be the key
figure in American Rock. Chuck
Berry, Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens,
Elvis Presley, Bob Dylan, Jim Morri
son, Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, Eric
Clapton. In fact, I'd venture to say we
dominate here. Meatloaf? We've got
Meatloaf, guys. A lot of frontmen
outshine their bands. Buddy Holly
had the Crickets. Hendrix had The
Experience. And Kurt Cobain was in
Nirvana, remember? Gwen Stefani
had . . . who again? I think the
British phenomenon is separate, but
it doesn't seem far fetched to specu
late that there might something in
the Psyche of American Rock hostile
to The Band, (folk, and they're Cana
dian, (along with Steppenwolf and
the Guess Who (famous for the hit,
"American Woman"))), as a concept.
It makes some sense. The popu
larity of foreign bands on the
American scene shows this is not a
question of what The People want.
It's a question about the Individual
American Genius and how it be-

haves. It seems like talent, here, is
more likely to strike out on its own,
(or just be at a total loss to hold any
kind of close relationship together
for very long). Maybe we're un
compromisingly individualistic. It
seems like a pretty American thing
to be.

Speaking as an American, collab
orative creative projects are hard. If
you've taken an art or design class,
you might know what I mean. Hell,
creative projects are hard in general.
You have to give up so much (any)
control! Hard to imagine Dylan
being Dylan without the ability to
ramble alone. If he had to square it
with his bandmates before deciding
to Go Electric. And maybe this com
fort with working alone has some
thing to do with The Culture. We sure
do like our heroes here.

But, if you look at those bands,
that is some really great music. Quite
arguably on average higher quality
than our solo acts. The solo acts were
visionaries, were tragic romances, but
they were short-lived or just hope
lessly, hopelessly... solo. It doesn't
matter if it's Dylan singing gospel or
Dylan singing pop: it's still just Bob
Dylan. He needs to bring someone
else in to achieve a certain volume of
sound. And when those people
you've brought in were actually there
all along, are very talented fellow
artists, coauthored the song, under
stand the vision, contribute their
own, care, its not hard to see how
something like The Wall, which
stretches my mind to its absolute lim
its, is possible.
That's the sound of synergy, peo
ple. (The soul being greater than the
sum of its parts.) I encourage it.

Want to harmonize? I've got rhythm.
