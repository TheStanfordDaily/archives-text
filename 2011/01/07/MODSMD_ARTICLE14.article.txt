# SENSE AND NONSENSE
## Diversity and Friendship 
### Aysha Bagchi 
In Albert Camus's "The Plague,"
Dr. Rieux and Tarrou develop a
close bond with each other
while working tirelessly to combat
the spreading disease in their town.
At the end of a long day, they find
themselves alone together on an
empty terrace and Tarrou asks
Rieux: "Rieux, have you never
tried to find out who I am? Do you
see me as a friend?" Rieux re
sponds saying yes, they are friends,
but amid all their work they have
not yet had time to better under
stand each other.Tarrou asks, then,
that they make this time on the ter
race their "hour of friendship." He
proceeds to tell Rieux his life story,
emphasizing the experiences that
led him to this town and motivate
him to combat the plague. For one
fleeting hour, he tries to be seen by
his friend.

Deep friendship, most would
agree, is an extremely important
source of meaning and support in
our lives. It is something to be
treasured. In college especially,
when we have been plucked from
our home environments and
placed in a strange new world, we
want to be understood. In this
sense, college students emblemize
the basic human desire to connect
with others.

Stanford students are lucky to
be at a very friendly place. Campus
is, in general, a congenial atmos
phere, and within a week at Stan
ford many of us make friendships
that last four years and beyond. Yet
despite being at a place that is con
ducive to friendship, students often
feel alone. We see expressions of
this in discussions in our houses
and dorms, in mental health aware
ness efforts or perhaps when a
friend unexpectedly takes a break
from school.

When I try to reconcile this par
adox between friendliness and
feelings of isolation on campus, a
few observations stand out: Stu
dents are extremely busy and our
hyper-intensive lives can make it
difficult to go beyond the surface in
cultivating friendships. Students
are also not very eager to share the
difficulties we are facing with our

friends: we are unused to failure,
and often the last thing we want to
acknowledge is having fallen short
of expectations. But it also seems
true that the tremendous diversity
on campus poses an extra chal
lenge for cultivating deep friend
ships.
This point is highlighted for me
when I think of the experience I
had during the summer after my
freshman year volunteering in two
villages in western Hungary. After
three weeks in a village called Soj
tor, I was in love with a place and a
people. Part of me wanted to stay
there, to belong. Why? One reason,
I thought, was that Sojtor was a
tight-knit community with a shared
sense of identity, a place where mu
tual understanding developed or
ganically. Through intimate con
nection in a rooted environment,
my friends there found rich sources
of meaning in their lives. Closeness
came easily.
I found myself envying people
who were materially less fortunate.
Friends who have volunteered in
remote places in other parts of the
world from Papua New Guinea
to Ghana to Ecuador have told

me similar stories of communities
with fewer iPods but, in my friends'
eyes, more meaning. I suspect
many students can find similar ex
amples even at home. To the extent
that a diverse campus can feel iso
lating, returns home over winter
break to families and communities
with a common cultural identity re
mind us of what closeness without
effort is like. When basic values are
shared, mutual understanding does
not require explicit curiosity and
exchange.
Going to a school that aspires to
be a microcosm of the world makes
achieving deep friendships tough
work. In this spiritual melting pot,
knowing and being known isn't
easy. But the rewards of such inti
macy are far greater. When we de
velop deep friendships with those
who are different, we experience
an irreplaceable exchange: we fa
cilitate another's growth and our
own world is expanded. Sometimes
this expansion comes when our un
conscious prejudices are chal
lenged. Sometimes it comes when a
friend illustrates a preferable set of
values or helps us shift our aspira
tions. In whatever form, these ex
changes help us become our better
selves. Deep friendship in the con
text of diversity is the richest, most
rewarding kind.
But it usually takes more than
an "hour of friendship." In a di
verse environment, the truest of
friendships require trusting and
sharing to be implicit and perenni
al. Whether we are happy or down
trodden, liberals or conservatives,
privileged or from disadvantaged
backgrounds, in all these ways and
many more, meaningful bonds re
quire being ourselves, and being
seen.

This kind of friendship is the
challenge Stanford poses to us
when it deliberately admits a di
verse class and deliberately diver
sifies our dorms and classrooms.
For our own sakes, we need to con
sciously take that challenge up.

ford many of us make friendships
that last four years and beyond. Yet
despite being at a place that is con
ducive to friendship, students often
feel alone. We see expressions of
this in discussions in our houses
and dorms, in mental health aware
ness efforts or perhaps when a
friend unexpectedly takes a break
from school.

When I try to reconcile this par
adox between friendliness and
feelings of isolation on campus, a
few observations stand out: Stu
dents are extremely busy and our
hyper-intensive lives can make it
difficult to go beyond the surface in
cultivating friendships. Students
are also not very eager to share the
difficulties we are facing with our

friends: we are unused to failure,
and often the last thing we want to
acknowledge is having fallen short
of expectations. But it also seems
true that the tremendous diversity
on campus poses an extra chal
lenge for cultivating deep friend
ships.
This point is highlighted for me
when I think of the experience I
had during the summer after my
freshman year volunteering in two
villages in western Hungary. After
three weeks in a village called Soj
tor, I was in love with a place and a
people. Part of me wanted to stay
there, to belong. Why? One reason,
I thought, was that Sojtor was a
tight-knit community with a shared
sense of identity, a place where mu
tual understanding developed or
ganically. Through intimate con
nection in a rooted environment,
my friends there found rich sources
of meaning in their lives. Closeness
came easily.
I found myself envying people
who were materially less fortunate.
Friends who have volunteered in
remote places in other parts of the
world from Papua New Guinea
to Ghana to Ecuador have told

me similar stories of communities
with fewer iPods but, in my friends'
eyes, more meaning. I suspect
many students can find similar ex
amples even at home. To the extent
that a diverse campus can feel iso
lating, returns home over winter
break to families and communities
with a common cultural identity re
mind us of what closeness without
effort is like. When basic values are
shared, mutual understanding does
not require explicit curiosity and
exchange.
Going to a school that aspires to
be a microcosm of the world makes
achieving deep friendships tough
work. In this spiritual melting pot,
knowing and being known isn't
easy. But the rewards of such inti
macy are far greater. When we de
velop deep friendships with those
who are different, we experience
an irreplaceable exchange: we fa
cilitate another's growth and our
own world is expanded. Sometimes
this expansion comes when our un
conscious prejudices are chal
lenged. Sometimes it comes when a
friend illustrates a preferable set of
values or helps us shift our aspira
tions. In whatever form, these ex
changes help us become our better
selves. Deep friendship in the con
text of diversity is the richest, most
rewarding kind.
But it usually takes more than
an "hour of friendship." In a di
verse environment, the truest of
friendships require trusting and
sharing to be implicit and perenni
al. Whether we are happy or down
trodden, liberals or conservatives,
privileged or from disadvantaged
backgrounds, in all these ways and
many more, meaningful bonds re
quire being ourselves, and being
seen.

This kind of friendship is the
challenge Stanford poses to us
when it deliberately admits a di
verse class and deliberately diver
sifies our dorms and classrooms.
For our own sakes, we need to con
sciously take that challenge up.
