## So much to be proud of 
### 
Dear Editor,
As a Stanford alum (Class of
1952) who has always been proud of
our university's achievements and
high standards, I am really strutting
today thanks to Andrew Luck's
stellar decision to continue his edu
cation. What a role model he is in
this time of "value only by dollar."
Congratulations to him for his wis
dom and to his family for anchoring
him.
