19-year-old Palo Alto man less than
half a mile north of the California
Avenue station at about 1:20 a.m. on
Thursday. According to a statement
from Caltrain spokeswoman Chris

tine Dunn, preliminary investiga
tions suggest that it was an "inten
tional act," as there is no vehicle or
pedestrian crossing area at the acci
dent site and fences surround the
train tracks.
The man was former Berkeley
resident Kyle Hodder-Hastorf, the
San Jose Mercury News reported.
This marks the first Caltrain fatal
ity in 2011. There were 11 deaths in
2010 and 19 in 2009. Although the
victim was a resident of Palo Alto, he
did not attend a Palo Alto high
