## OUSTING ARIZONA Card cruises in Pac-10 home opener 
### JACK BLANCHAT NATE ADAMS 
Continuing a streak of impressive play,
the Cardinal women's basketball team
dusted off a feisty Arizona team with a
second-half run to pull away for an 87-54
victory.
No. 4 Stanford (11-2,2-0 Pac-10) opened
up strong, and junior guard Lindy La
Rocque's three pointer made the score 9-0
after four minutes. The Cardinal was con
tent to let Arizona fire up outside shots
while the Card used its imposing size ad
vantage to take control of the game early
on.
Arizona (11-3, 2-1) went halfway
through the first half making only one of
its first eight attempts from beyond the
arc. Despite a solid start from Stanford's
triangle offense, the Wildcats stuck to their
player-to-player defense, leading to three
Cardinal players cruising to layups on
three separate occasions.

The Wildcats made a push halfway
through the first half, making a few outside
shots and causing the Cardinal to commit
fouls, and with 7:43 left in the first half, the
Cardinal's lead had shrunk to five points.
The lead remained five throughout the
first half, as Stanford's defense on the block
was susceptible to Arizona's quick pick
and-roll offense. With 3:51 to play in the first
half, the Cardinal's lead was still only five.
A late Nnemkadi Ogwumike layup
pushed the lead to seven, and the Cardinal
carried a 40-33 at halftime. Even though
the Card had a 31-17 rebounding advan
tage at halftime, head coach Tara Van-
Derveer said her team came out sluggish.
VanDerveer said she called her team
out to play better at halftime, and the Car
dinal responded.
Stanford came out playing tough de
fense in the second half, feeding Nnemka
di Ogwumike the ball early and often, let
ting her attack the left block. She respond
ed by shaking her defender for two easy
layups and a crisp fadeaway jumper, help
ing Stanford go on a 13-0 run to start the
second period.
