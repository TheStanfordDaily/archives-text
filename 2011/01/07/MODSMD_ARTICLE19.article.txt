## OUSTING ARIZONA Card cruises in Pac-10 home opener 
### JACK BLANCHAT NATE ADAMS 
Continuing a streak of impressive play,
the Cardinal women's basketball team
dusted off a feisty Arizona team with a
second-half run to pull away for an 87-54
victory.
No. 4 Stanford (11-2,2-0 Pac-10) opened
up strong, and junior guard Lindy La
Rocque's three pointer made the score 9-0
after four minutes. The Cardinal was con
tent to let Arizona fire up outside shots
while the Card used its imposing size ad
vantage to take control of the game early
on.
Arizona (11-3, 2-1) went halfway
through the first half making only one of
its first eight attempts from beyond the
arc. Despite a solid start from Stanford's
triangle offense, the Wildcats stuck to their
player-to-player defense, leading to three
Cardinal players cruising to layups on
three separate occasions.

The Wildcats made a push halfway
through the first half, making a few outside
shots and causing the Cardinal to commit
fouls, and with 7:43 left in the first half, the
Cardinal's lead had shrunk to five points.
The lead remained five throughout the
first half, as Stanford's defense on the block
was susceptible to Arizona's quick pick
and-roll offense. With 3:51 to play in the first
half, the Cardinal's lead was still only five.
A late Nnemkadi Ogwumike layup
pushed the lead to seven, and the Cardinal
carried a 40-33 at halftime. Even though
the Card had a 31-17 rebounding advan
tage at halftime, head coach Tara Van-
Derveer said her team came out sluggish.
VanDerveer said she called her team
out to play better at halftime, and the Car
dinal responded.
Stanford came out playing tough de
fense in the second half, feeding Nnemka
di Ogwumike the ball early and often, let
ting her attack the left block. She respond
ed by shaking her defender for two easy
layups and a crisp fadeaway jumper, help
ing Stanford go on a 13-0 run to start the
second period.
"I met with [senior forward] Kayla Ped-

The Cardinal offense put on a show against the Wildcats last night, with Nnemkadi Ogwumike
(30), posting eight rebounds and a game-high 24 points. She was 12 for 17 from the field.
ersen and [senior guard] Jeanette
Pohlen, I told them they needed to
do their job better, and it shows
what kind of leaders they are that I
can get on them and they can re
spond in a positive way," Van-
Derveer said.
Arizona broke its scoring
drought with 13:48 left in the game
when forward Ify Ibekwe hit a
layup, but the damage was already
done. The two Ogwumike sisters
were far too busy putting on a clinic.
In the first 10 minutes of the sec
ond half, older sister Nnemkadi
Ogwumike had 10 points, three re
bounds and two blocks, and
younger sister Chiney Ogwumike
had four points, three rebounds,
one block and one steal.
Pohlen said the super sisters
were the missing piece in the slug
gish first half.
"[VanDerveer] knows our po
tential, and we've shown the whole
country now what we can do," she
said. "She made us focus on run
ning more ... to push it and to get
the ball to Nneka on the block."

Bolstered by her strong second
half, Nnemkadi Ogwumike led the
way for the Cardinal with 24 points
and eight rebounds. Pohlen fin

ished with 13 points, and Pedersen
and Chiney Ogwumike finished
with identical 11 -point, 11 -rebound
games. Freshman guard Sara James
also added seven points in the sec
ond half.
Recovering from a two-game
skid in mid-December, Stanford
will have an opportunity to extend
its winning streak to seven when it
hosts Arizona State on Saturday.
The Sun Devils (10-3,2-1) coast
ed through their non-conference
schedule and opened Pac-10 play
with a sweep of the Oregon
schools. The latter feat was particu
larly impressive, as ASU was able
to hold the Ducks' offense to just
67 points. Oregon had been leading
the conference with 89 points per
game going into the contest.
The Sun Devils hit a bit of a
stumbling block last night, though,
falling to Cal, 67-55. Stanford de
feated Berkeley convincingly last
weekend, 78-45.
Recent history certainly favors
the Cardinal, but things look good
for Stanford even if you go farther
back the Cardinal cruised past
ASU, 62-43 in Tempe in their most
recent meeting, last February.
Stanford will tip off against the
visiting Sun Devils in Maples Pavil
ion tomorrow at 2 p.m.
