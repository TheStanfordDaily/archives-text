## New gym set for W. Campus Board of trustees gives concept approval for new Roble gym 
### KURT CHIRBAS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford board of trustees
gave concept approval for a new
75,000-square-foot recreation center
to be built on the west end of Roble
Field at its December meeting.
Construction for the project, esti
mated to cost around $3O million, will
be funded entirely by a group of
major donors, which currently in
cludes John Arrillaga '6O and the
Avery family, among others.
The University will foot the bill
for development and pay daily oper
ational costs.
Those involved with the project
say the facility will fill a void for in
door recreational areas on the west
side of campus.
"The campus map speaks to the
situation," project manager Mark
Bonino wrote in an e-mail to The
Daily. "Most of the recreation and fit
ness facilities are located around the
Athletics zone in the East part of the
campus while the West part of cam
pus has few fitness facilities outside of
Tresidder, West Campus tennis
courts, and outdoor fields at Roble
and Sand Hill."
Roble Gymnasium used to satisfy
this need: it contained a basketball
court, locker rooms, ping-pong tables
and a cycling area.
But when the dance division
needed more space, much of the
gym's equipment was packed up and
moved over to the Arrillaga Center
for Sports and Recreation, located on
the east side of campus, which
opened its doors in February 2006.
"We kind of lost a foothold for
recreational activity," deputy director
of athletics Ray Purpur said, "and
we've had a lot of comments and a lot
of feedback over the five years that
there's just no indoor recreation
areas on that side of campus."
The building's location has also
been chosen to account for future
University expansion. According to
the University's master plan, there
will be future development of resi
dential halls on that side of campus.
"With campus development
heading west," Bonino said, "there's
an increasing demand for these facil
ities."
And while a general lack of fund
ing and limitations under Stanford's
General Use Permit have posed ob
stacles in the past, the financial sup
port of donors as well as new Uni
versity-wide initiatives emphasizing
fitness and wellness have finally
made the project a reality.
The center will include basketball
courts, fitness and recreation studios,
a rock-climbing wall and a new out

door 50-meter swimming pool. In
coming up with the design of the facil
ity, Purpur said they looked at feed
back left on comment cards at exist
ing campus recreation centers to get
input from students.
"One of our common feedbacks is
that the rock-climbing wall [at Arril
laga] is very inadequate," Purpur
said. "So we are going to be putting in
a new rock-climbing wall in the new
building."
The facility will not only be the
same size as the current Arrillaga
Center. It will also look the same.
"We love the look of that build
ing," Purpur said, "so we are going to
copy it."
The difference, Bonino said, will
be on the inside.
"There will be more studio space
to house a variety of different well
ness and fitness programs, and of
course, the swimming pool provides
water fitness to match the recreation
pool at the Avery Aquatics Center,"
Bonino said, "and we will have lock
ers and showers, which are not pres
ent in the Arrillaga Center."
To make room for construction,
an existing swimming pool by Roble
Field and a group of temporary build
ings will be removed, and the locker
rooms behind the pool will be con

verted into another space.
However, there are no plans to
alter any existing campus recreation
centers.
The Department of Athletics will
monitor the usage of the gym at
Tresidder Union which opened in
1995 and is the site in closest compe
tition with the new facility to see if
attendance decreases as a result. If
this is the case, the gym may be re
moved, but Purpur does not expect
this to be the case.
"I think they'll augment each
other," Purpur said.
This week, the Department of
Land, Buildings & Real Estate plans
on submitting its first entitlements for
architecture and site approval. With
in the next couple of months, building
permits will be submitted as well.
While no timeline has been set
yet, construction is anticipated to
begin in the summer of 2011 with
completion estimated by late 2012.
"I think this will bring a new desti
nation to the community," Purpur
said. "It will be a recreation destina
tion where you can jog, swim and
take a shower after you work out on
that side of campus."

laga] is very inadequate," Purpur
said. "So we are going to be putting in
a new rock-climbing wall in the new
building."
The facility will not only be the
same size as the current Arrillaga
Center. It will also look the same.
"We love the look of that build
ing," Purpur said, "so we are going to
copy it."
The difference, Bonino said, will
be on the inside.
"There will be more studio space
to house a variety of different well
ness and fitness programs, and of
course, the swimming pool provides
water fitness to match the recreation
pool at the Avery Aquatics Center,"
Bonino said, "and we will have lock
ers and showers, which are not pres
ent in the Arrillaga Center."
To make room for construction,
an existing swimming pool by Roble
Field and a group of temporary build
ings will be removed, and the locker
rooms behind the pool will be con

verted into another space.
However, there are no plans to
alter any existing campus recreation
centers.
The Department of Athletics will
monitor the usage of the gym at
Tresidder Union which opened in
1995 and is the site in closest compe
tition with the new facility to see if
attendance decreases as a result. If
this is the case, the gym may be re
moved, but Purpur does not expect
this to be the case.
"I think they'll augment each
other," Purpur said.
This week, the Department of
Land, Buildings & Real Estate plans
on submitting its first entitlements for
architecture and site approval. With
in the next couple of months, building
permits will be submitted as well.
While no timeline has been set
yet, construction is anticipated to
begin in the summer of 2011 with
completion estimated by late 2012.
"I think this will bring a new desti
nation to the community," Purpur
said. "It will be a recreation destina
tion where you can jog, swim and
take a shower after you work out on
that side of campus."
