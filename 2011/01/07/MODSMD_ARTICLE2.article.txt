## New gym set for W. Campus Board of trustees gives concept approval for new Roble gym 
### KURT CHIRBAS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford board of trustees
gave concept approval for a new
75,000-square-foot recreation center
to be built on the west end of Roble
Field at its December meeting.
Construction for the project, esti
mated to cost around $3O million, will
be funded entirely by a group of
major donors, which currently in
cludes John Arrillaga '6O and the
Avery family, among others.
The University will foot the bill
for development and pay daily oper
ational costs.
Those involved with the project
say the facility will fill a void for in
door recreational areas on the west
side of campus.
"The campus map speaks to the
situation," project manager Mark
Bonino wrote in an e-mail to The
Daily. "Most of the recreation and fit
ness facilities are located around the
Athletics zone in the East part of the
campus while the West part of cam
pus has few fitness facilities outside of
Tresidder, West Campus tennis
courts, and outdoor fields at Roble
and Sand Hill."
Roble Gymnasium used to satisfy
this need: it contained a basketball
court, locker rooms, ping-pong tables
and a cycling area.
But when the dance division
needed more space, much of the
gym's equipment was packed up and
moved over to the Arrillaga Center
for Sports and Recreation, located on
the east side of campus, which
opened its doors in February 2006.
