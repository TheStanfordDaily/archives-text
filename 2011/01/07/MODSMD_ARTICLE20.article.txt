### JESSICA YU STAFF WRITER 
It's a high-pressure year for
Stanford men's gymnastics. After a
disappointing loss to Michigan at
last year's NCAA Championships
in West Point, N.Y., the Cardinal
enters the 2011 season as the top
ranked team in the nation and
hopes to retain that honor through
April at this year's championship
in Colorado Springs, Colo. The
road starts with an intrasquad
competition on Friday evening. At
the same time that the Cardinal
works to uphold Stanford's pro
gram, it also works to uphold the
tradition of men's gymnastics as a
whole.
Earlier this year, the UC-
Berkeley Chancellor Robert Bir
geneau announced that the school
would be dropping five of its ath
letic programs at the end of the
2010-11 season; among these pro
grams were men's and women's
gymnastics.
Only 15 schools have men's
gymnastics programs that com
pete in the NCAA, and the pro
grams at Cal and Stanford are the
only ones in California. The an
nouncement affects the futures of
both Stanford and men's gymnas
tics. Cal and Stanford have long
had a feisty and friendly rivalry in
their academic and athletic arenas
and men's gymnastics is cer
tainly no exception.
Each year, for example, the two
schools come together for the Big
Flip Off, their head-to-head com
petition that has been a source of
great pride, competitive spirit and
humor for both programs. This
year's Flip Off will be a bittersweet
event for both teams as they bid
farewell to their competitive inti
macy.
Stanford head coach Thom
Glielmi said he was both saddened
and surprised by Cal's decision to
drop men's gymnastics.
"[The Cal men] have had a
tremendous impact on the sport
not just in the Bay Area, but in the
country," he said. "What doesn't
make sense to me is that men's
gymnastics has been one of Cal's
most successful varsity programs
both in the athletic arena and class
room."
Furthermore, Glielmi notes
that losing Cal is potentially a sign
of the weakening popularity of

men's gymnastics. Both Stanford
and Cal have traditionally recruit
ed some of the nation's most tal
ented high school athletes and
seen their gymnasts move from the
collegiate arena to the national
arena, earning spots on the U.S. Se
nior National Team, World Team
and even Olympic Team.
"Beyond the Stanford-Cal ri
valry, we lose a great source of
gymnastics and a program that has
allowed junior gymnasts to contin
ue in their chosen sport on the col
legiate level," he said.
Reflecting on the past few
months and looking towards the
current season, Glielmi believes
his team is hungrier for success
than ever. After last year's second
place finish and 2009's first
place finish his gymnasts are ex
tremely motivated to bring the
championship back to Stanford.
His athletes certainly have the
talent to win. In past years, individ
uals such as seniors Alex Buscaglia
and Tim Gentry have been pegged
as the Cardinal's most talented be
cause of their national rankings,
but this year the entire team is
ready for competition. Fans can get
a glimpse of this during Friday's in
trasquad, where the Cardinal will
display its dynamic, exciting and
highly difficult routines in front of a
crowd for the first time this season.
"There are several guys that are
dynamic on the events they com
pete, and there is not one specific
athlete that can win this champi
onship for Stanford," Gliemli said.
He adds, though, that his seniors
Buscaglia, Gentry, Josh Dixon,
Ryan Lieberman, Abhinav Ra
mani and redshirt senior Nicholas
Noone have emerged as lead
ers, taking ownership of the train
ing and success of their team.
Assistant coach Brett McClure
agreed.
"The big players of this team are
definitely the entire senior class," he
said. "They have really taken con
trol and instilled the Stanford phi
losophy on work ethic and expecta
tions."
Senior Ryan Lieberman echoed
that sentiment.
"The senior class turned into the
class we knew we could be," he said.
This Friday's intrasquad will be
held at 7 p.m. in Burnham Pavilion.
