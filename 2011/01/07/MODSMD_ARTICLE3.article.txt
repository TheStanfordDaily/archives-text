## Keeping a brave face online Study shows social networking sites can underemphasize loneliness 
### JENNY THAI STAFF WRITER 
Facebook has a notorious reputa
tion for helping college students pro
crastinate. But recent Stanford re
search suggests that social network
ing sites are toxic to more than just
the academic wellbeing of students.
Stanford professors Benoit
Monin, Carol Dweck and James
Gross and doctoral student Alex Jor
dan found in their December paper
that underestimating the unhappi
ness of others correlates with loneli
ness.
Inspired by the phenomenon of
social networking websites such as
Facebook, the research was conduct
ed in four distinct studies, drawn
from a sample of around 460 first
year Stanford undergraduates.
"College students are a good
population to work with," Monin
said. "We can circumscribe who the
other people the [individual] is inter
acting with [are], such as peers,
friends and roommates."
One contributing factor to this self
induced melancholy is the contrasting
levels of transparency regarding the
social norms of displaying happiness in
social situations.
In the first study, participants gen
erally reported that their negative
emotional experiences tended to hap
pen in private settings.
"When you're at home watching
TV, there's no one who can see you,"
said Benoit Monin, professor of psy
chology. "All you see are the people
dressed up to go to parties very vis
ible things. You don't see the lonely
people."
The transparency of seeing people
having fun leads to pluralistic igno
rance, or the situation where a majori
ty of group members secretly reject
what they perceive to be a social norm,
but erringly assume that most others
accept it.
"We hide our negative emotions,"
Monin said. "You don't tell your
friends about how miserable you are
because that wouldn't be 'cool.' You
only tell them the good events of your
day and as a result, you perceive your
peers' lives as better off. You think that
you're unique, that you're the only one
who is suffering."
Social networking websites, such as
Facebook, create virtual "socializing
spaces" that connect friends with each
other. However, mimicking socially ac
tive environments also invites a similar
enforcement of the social norm of hap
piness. The knowledge that one's on
line profile is open to others leads to
self-censorship of negative thoughts
and a steady flow of positive content
and photos.

"People are really unlikely to
say on Facebook that
they're depressed or
lonely," said Sarah
Sterman 'l3. "Face
book is your so
cial persona

and you don't want people to think
you're generally a depressed person."
The subsequent studies investigat
ed the relationship between loneliness
and the social misperception that one
is alone in feeling miserable. Study
findings revealed that loneliness has a
positive correlation with the underesti
mation of the unhappiness of others.
The more we underestimate the sad
ness of others, the lonelier and more
alienated we feel. Interestingly
enough, the number of confidants one
has appears to do little in avoiding mis
perception.
"In the study, it was surprising to
find how even close friends and room
mates still overestimate each others'
happiness," said Monin. "This study
didn't find the cause of loneliness but
just the correlation."
Fortunately, the solution to alleviat
ing loneliness may not be quite as elu
sive. Being aware of the problem is a
major step in resolving it.
"It's not that Facebook is bad, but
we should realize that the photo of [the
friend] parachuting off the Eiffel tower
does not mean he or she has no boring
moments," Monin said. "People's lives
have highs and lows. Understanding
that one is not unique in one's unhap
piness should make one feel closer to
other people."
Additionally, Monin proposed
opening the communication lines,
both in the private and public spheres.
"We're not saying that you should
go crying to everyone about how mis
erable you are," Monin said. "But if
people can at least open up a bit more,
you'd feel better. The Internet also has
anonymous support groups to help
people dealing with these things find
solace."
