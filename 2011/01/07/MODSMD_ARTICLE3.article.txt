## Keeping a brave face online Study shows social networking sites can underemphasize loneliness 
### JENNY THAI STAFF WRITER 
Facebook has a notorious reputa
tion for helping college students pro
crastinate. But recent Stanford re
search suggests that social network
ing sites are toxic to more than just
the academic wellbeing of students.
Stanford professors Benoit
Monin, Carol Dweck and James
Gross and doctoral student Alex Jor
dan found in their December paper
that underestimating the unhappi
ness of others correlates with loneli
ness.
Inspired by the phenomenon of
social networking websites such as
Facebook, the research was conduct
ed in four distinct studies, drawn
from a sample of around 460 first
year Stanford undergraduates.
"College students are a good
population to work with," Monin
said. "We can circumscribe who the
other people the [individual] is inter
acting with [are], such as peers,
friends and roommates."
