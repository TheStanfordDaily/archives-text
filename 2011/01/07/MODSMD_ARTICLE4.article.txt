# OUR LUCKY DAY
## ANDREW LUCK TO RETURN 
### KABIR SAWHNEY MANAGING EDITOR 
The picture for Stanford football in 2011
became a little clearer yesterday when two of
its players announced their NFL intentions.
Redshirt sophomore quarterback Andrew
Luck, the runner-up for the Heisman Trophy,
announced his intention to return for his jun
ior season, while redshirt junior linebacker
Thomas Keiser declared that he will enter the
NFL Draft this spring.
The big news of the day was Luck's deci
sion to pass up millions playing in the NFL to
return to the Farm. Many expected Luck to
forgo his final two seasons of eligibility â€”
had he chosen to enter the draft, he would
have been chosen first overall by the Caroli
na Panthers.
In a statement released to the media, Luck
said, "I am committed to earning my degree
in architectural design from Stanford Univer
sity and am on track to accomplish this at the
completion of the spring quarter of 2012." He
was not made available for interviews.
Because he redshirted his freshman year,
Luck has two years of NCAA eligibility re
maining, but is currently an academic junior.
The announcement intensified the specu
lation around the future of Stanford head
coach Jim Harbaugh, who has spoken to at
least two NFL teams since the Cardinal won
the Orange Bowl on Jan. 3. According to the
San Jose Mercury News' Tim Kawakami,
Stanford has offered Harbaugh an estimated
$5 million to be its head coach next season, in
cluding bonuses. Luck's return may bring
Harbaugh back to the Farm as well, which
would turn Stanford into an early contender
for the Pac-12 title and help put it in the pre
season top 10.
The Miami Dolphins met with Harbaugh
yesterday in the Bay Area, but according to
ESPN, the team has chosen to retain Tony
Sparano as its head coach. The San Francisco

49ers have reportedly offered Harbaugh $6
million per year, including bonuses.
Impending labor action in the NFL could
also keep Harbaugh from moving to the pros.
With the league's collective bargaining
agreement with its players set to expire in
March, the owners could lock out the players,
effectively preventing the season from going
forward.
Meanwhile, Keiser became the first Stan
ford underclassman to declare for the draft.
His departure means that the Cardinal will

have to replace four of its starters on the de
fensive front seven next season.
In an interview with The Daily, Keiser dis
cussed his decision to leave Stanford early
and declare for the draft.
"What it really came down to was what me
and my family thought was best for me next
season," he said. "It was really where I pic
tured myself on the football field it wasn't
playing for Stanford, it was playing in the
