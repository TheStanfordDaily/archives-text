## Card keeps rolling with convincing win over ASU 
### LAUREN TAYLOR STAFF WRITER 
Despite multiple road losses this season, and
facing an opponent that has consistent home
court advantage, the Stanford men's basketball
team powered past Arizona State last night in its
first Pac-10 road game. With a 55-41 victory over
the Sun Devils (8-6,1-2 Pac-10), the Cardinal is on
a three-game winning streak and remains unde
feated in conference play.
The win for the Card (9-4,2-0) is particularly
impressive because of Arizona State's overwhelm
ing success on its home court inTempe. During the
past three years, the Sun Devils have won 80 per
cent of their games in Wells Fargo Arena. This sea
son, however, the team has only competed at
home six times, including its loss to the Cardinal.
With such a travel-heavy schedule, Arizona State
has had more away games than any other major
conference school so far this season.
Nonetheless, the Sun Devils' lack of recent
home experience worked in Stanford's favor, as
the Card held the lead for the entire duration of
the game, with the exception of the first three min
utes.
The game was not decided until the second
half, when Arizona State's offense crumbled, se
verely weakened by the absence of injured senior
point guard Jamelle McMillan. Poor play from
both teams marked the first half, with seven Cardi
nal turnovers and 12 from the Sun Devils. The
prospect of a Stanford victory was especially un
certain at the half because of Arizona State's dom
ination on the glass, which was an unexpected sur
prise for a team that was ranked 176 th in rebound
ing heading into conference play.

During the second half, however, Stanford's of
fense exploded and scored 30 points, compared to
just 18 for the Sun Devils.The Card also racked up
25 rebounds and compensated for its lack of pres
ence on the boards in the first half.
