## Card keeps rolling with convincing win over ASU 
### LAUREN TAYLOR STAFF WRITER 
Despite multiple road losses this season, and
facing an opponent that has consistent home
court advantage, the Stanford men's basketball
team powered past Arizona State last night in its
first Pac-10 road game. With a 55-41 victory over
the Sun Devils (8-6,1-2 Pac-10), the Cardinal is on
a three-game winning streak and remains unde
feated in conference play.
The win for the Card (9-4,2-0) is particularly
impressive because of Arizona State's overwhelm
ing success on its home court inTempe. During the
past three years, the Sun Devils have won 80 per
cent of their games in Wells Fargo Arena. This sea
son, however, the team has only competed at
home six times, including its loss to the Cardinal.
With such a travel-heavy schedule, Arizona State
has had more away games than any other major
conference school so far this season.
Nonetheless, the Sun Devils' lack of recent
home experience worked in Stanford's favor, as
the Card held the lead for the entire duration of
the game, with the exception of the first three min
utes.
The game was not decided until the second
half, when Arizona State's offense crumbled, se
verely weakened by the absence of injured senior
point guard Jamelle McMillan. Poor play from
both teams marked the first half, with seven Cardi
nal turnovers and 12 from the Sun Devils. The
prospect of a Stanford victory was especially un
certain at the half because of Arizona State's dom
ination on the glass, which was an unexpected sur
prise for a team that was ranked 176 th in rebound
ing heading into conference play.

During the second half, however, Stanford's of
fense exploded and scored 30 points, compared to
just 18 for the Sun Devils.The Card also racked up
25 rebounds and compensated for its lack of pres
ence on the boards in the first half.

Jarrett Mann, above, was a big factor for the
blossoming Cardinal offense last night, going 3 for
5 from the field and 5 for 7 from the line en route to
11 points, second best for either team.
Junior forward Josh Owens was a
key contributor to Stanford's win,
leading the team with 15 points and
11 rebounds.
Trent Lockett, Ruslan Pateev
and Carrick Felix had 10 points each
for Arizona State. The team's overall
offensive effort was weak, scoring
only one of 14 from the three-point
range.
Hoping to tack on a third consec
utive Pac-10 win, Stanford now
heads to Tucson to face Arizona (13-
3,2-1). The Wildcats have won five of
their last six games, including last
night's 73-71 win over California,
and have not been defeated in back
to-back games so far this season. The
Cats lead the Pac-10 in field goal
shooting percentage and average
78.5 points per game, posing a seri
ous challenge to the Cardinal de
fense.
Derrick Williams (18.6 points per
game), Solomon Hill (53.2-percent

field-goal shooting) and Lamont
Jones (8.1 ppg, 81.8-percent free
throw shooting) are expected to lead
Arizona's offensive effort. Stanford
intends to counter this trio by utiliz
ing junior guard Jeremy Green, who
has been very effective in his four ca
reer games against the Wildcats.
Green has averaged 16.5 points
against Arizona, with 24 total buck
ets and 66 total points, more than
against any other Pac-10 team. Ju
nior guard Jarrett Mann has also ex
perienced significant success when
facing the Wildcats, having made
eight of his 11 attempts from the
field and averaging 7.3 points in his
three career matchups with Arizona.
But even with these offensive
contributions, Stanford's ability to
knock down perimeter shots and
remain strong on the defensive end

will be the key to success against
Arizona. The Card currently allows
just 61.0 points per game, a figure
that leads the Pac-10 and was essen
tial in its wins over Yale and Cal. In
fact, Stanford has held four oppo
nents to fewer than 50 points this
season and has also held the edge
on the glass, averaging 34.9 re
bounds per game.
The continuation of this defen
sive dominance, coupled with the
momentum from the current win
streak, should help Stanford as it
hopes to head home after the week
end with a sweep in the Southwest
and a perfect Pac-10 record.
Tipoff on Saturday is scheduled
for 3:30 p.m. PST in Tucson.
