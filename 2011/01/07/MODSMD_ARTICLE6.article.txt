## For Luck, school is the right move 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY MANAGING EDITOR 
Let's face it: Andrew Luck's decision to
return to school does very little for his foot
ball future. He's a finished product who was
the guaranteed No. 1 choice in 2011. He'd be
a multimillionaire multiple times over come
April. So why come back?
"It's a Rorschach test for people's values
system."
That's his father, Oliver Luck, talking to
the (many, many) people who question
Luck's choice. Because for his son, it's not
about the millions: it's about education, and
it's about the potential to take Stanford to
heights unseen in the modern era. In an era
where the idea of the amateur athlete is ques
tioned on a seemingly day-to-day basis,
Luck's decision epitomizes the concept of the
student-athlete. And the rub is this: it's not
that surprising. His public statements hinted
at him staying, and the decision fits exactly
with his humble, studious persona.
But armchair quarterbacks, wallowing in
their ignorance, will always question that
which they do not know. So let's break this
down, and look at why Luck stayed. To do so,
let's first look at the reasons to leave. They
number exactly two: money and injury risk.
To the first: the NFL is currently negotiat
ing a new Collective Bargaining Agreement
(CBA), with one of the tenets being a rookie
wage scale. Simply put, the idea of first-year
players making the most money at their posi
tion before playing a snap is troubling to
many. When the new CBA is signed, the
salaries are expected to be far lower than
they are now that is to say, Sam
Bradford's $5O million in guaranteed
money is a thing of that past. But not
so fast: the CBA discussions are heat
ed, and a lockout is entirely possible.
If that happens, a draft will still occur,
but no scale will be implemented. If
that is the case, then Luck would have
one shot to make a dramatic sum of
money off the bat.
By 2012, a scale will be in place,
and he'll stand to make tens of mil
lions of dollars less. But Luck comes
from a financially secure back
ground, and has made it clear over
and over that money is not an object

for him; his father's comments con
firm it. Even if the wage scale lowers
his earning power to about three mil
lion a year Peter King's projection
he's still in the top two percent of
wage earners in the United States.
More than enough to live comfort
ably, and if he really is as good as he's
projected to be, he'll make his tens of
millions on his next deal.
To the second: Luck is the guaran
teed No. 1 pick in 2011. He is also all
but guaranteed No. 1 in 2012. Any
scout from coast to coast will tell you
that he is a historically gifted
prospect; some say he's the best since
Peyton Manning, while others say
he's the best since John Elway. No
player will supplant him if he stays
healthy. (Perish any Jake Locker
comparisons one guy is a quarter
back; the other is a superior athlete

who throws the ball occasionally.)
Manning was projected No. 1 after his
junior year, remained in school, and
went No. 1 after his senior season. If
he's injured, it's still unlikely, unless
it's (knock furiously on wood) career
ending. Bradford was projected to go
first overall in 2009, went back to
school, got injured and barely played,
then still went No. 1 in 2010. That is to
say, Luck is almost certainly going to
be the first person walking across the
stage in New York in April 2012, even
if his arm is in a sling. He's not exact
ly hurting his draft stock by staying.
With those two concerns aside,
why go? If there is indeed an NFL
lockout, he won't be able to partici
pate in mini-camps and might have to
miss part of the season. Luck is a foot
ball player; he doesn't want to sit on
the sideline. Hie team he'd be going

to, the Carolina Panthers, is notori
ously cheap to the point where it re
fuses to sign free agents. It's not exact
ly the best situation.
But forget the NFL. Luck, a high
school valedictorian and a dedicated
student in a time-intensive engineer
ing degree program, gets a chance to
finish his degree. In its press release,
Stanford made that seem like his pri
mary reason for staying.
In a football sense, with Luck
under center, Stanford is a legitimate
national title contender next season,
even with the team hemorrhaging
seniors. And, in terms of Jim Har
baugh, let's not overlook the timing
of this announcement from the
time Luck came out with his decision
until The Daily's print deadline, Stan
ford's chances of keeping its coach
have seemingly risen dramatically,

with the Miami Dolphins dropping
out and the Cardinal reportedly
matching San Francisco's offer. Luck
gives Harbaugh an incentive to stay
when 24 hours prior, it seemed like
Harbaugh had one foot out the door.
Finally, if he cared about individ
ual accomplishments â€”he doesn't,
but everyone else does Luck is the
clear Heisman favorite going into
2011 and almost surely a consensus
preseason first team All-American.
Which is all to say: the chance for a
title, the ability to complete his under
graduate academic career and the
knowledge that he's practically guar
anteed to be the top pick in 2012
means there's more than enough rea
son to stay in school.
