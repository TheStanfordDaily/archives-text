## LOCAL Caltrain debuts new weekend bullet service 
### NARDOS GIRMA 
Despite several service cuts in the past year as
Caltrain struggles to overcome a $2.3 million
budget deficit, the rail agency rang in 2011 test
running a new weekend baby-bullet service on
Jan. 1, part of an effort to revive its plummeting
ridership.
The three-month pilot program stems from
Caltrain's commitment, approved in 2010, to
service reductions, fare increases and revenue
generating strategies. Ticket prices went up 25
cents for each zone on New Year's Day
"We're in the business of providing customer
service," said Caltrain spokeswoman Christine
Dunn. "So we look for things that will attract
riders."
This new service, which already existed on
weekdays, stops at seven stations instead of 22,
bringing commuters from San Jose to San Fran
cisco in a third of the time and arriving at the Cal
train station on King Street in San Francisco in
little more than an hour.
Keeping with its goal for cost-efficiency, only
one crew will run the program's four trains. In
fact, the seven stations where the baby bullet
stops were strategically chosen based on their
proximity to locations that attracted more foot
traffic. Mountain View, for example, is just blocks
away from the San Antonio Shopping Center

and Millbrae is a principal point of transfer to
other public transportation, such as BART.
"We're relying on ridership ... to have full
trains [750 people] and a lot of people using the
service to make this worthwhile," Dunn said, not
ing that the future of the service depends heavily
on its ability to bring in new riders.
According to Dunn, the total cost for the pilot
project is estimated at $107,000; however, Cal
train expects ticket sales to offset this amount by
$82,620, leaving a total net cost of $24,380, which
it will shoulder using savings in fuel costs accrued

in the first six months of the 2010-2011 fiscal year.
While Caltrain has not yet evaluated last
weekend's debut, Dunn says the general re
sponse in anticipation of the new service was
nothing short of positive.
But the project still has its skeptics, including
at Stanford.
Some, like Jujhaar Singh 'l4, don't think that
20 minutes "makes that much of a difference."
"I take the weekday bullet train to San Mateo
a lot and I've been planning on going to San
Francisco this quarter so it will be super benefi
cial," said Ana Rosa 'l4, a Caltrain regular.
"[But] it only stops a few times, so it is still a lit
tle limited."
The weekend bullet service only makes two
round-trips, offering a run in the morning and an
other in the afternoon for each direction a
drastic change from the regular service, which
stops at its destinations every hour.
Although she maintained that conclusive evi
dence on the success of the weekend baby bullet
is yet to be determined, Dunn is not worried.
"When we introduced [the baby bullet serv
ice] on the weekdays, our ridership increased by
40 percent," she said. "We're very hopeful and
optimistic that the same thing will happen on the
weekends."
