## Zimbardo begins Heroic Imagination Project 
### ELLORA ISRANI CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Three decades after his infamous
Stanford Prison Experiment proved
that "terrifyingly normal" individuals
can commit alarming atrocities, Philip
Zimbardo, professor emeritus in psy
chology, has set out to communicate
the opposite: that in all situations,
these same people can speak out
against evil and become heroes.
Zimbardo has substantiated this
notion through the inception of the
Heroic Imagination Project. The
project, which currently includes a
comprehensive website as well as ed
ucation programs for high schools
students, seeks to publicize the term
"heroic imagination," referring to the
idea that anyone can become a hero
by utilizing his or her imagination.

He intends to "democratize the
concept of heroism" and erase the no
tion that heroes are "extraordinary
people." He explains them instead as
"ordinary people who in a particular
situation do an extraordinary thing."
Although the project was original
ly a collaboration between a number
of unpaid individuals, funding has re
cently come from a number of indi
viduals and foundations. This money
has been used to set up a small office
in San Francisco's Presidio district
and expand the website to include a
comprehensive explanation of the
"heroic imagination."
The Heroic Imagination Project's
pilot program began last September
at two local high schools: ARISE
High School in Oakland, which has a
mostly low-income, minority student
body, and Foothill Middle College in

Los Altos, a more middle-class envi
ronment.
Students spent the fall semester
learning the principles of social psy
chology that relate to heroism. They
watched videos of such famous ex
periments as Stanley Milgram's 1963
study on obedience to authority and
Zimbardo's own prison study.
Through a basic knowledge of psy
chology, students gained an under
standing of the power of the situation
over their own behavior as well as
how to surpass these influences and
act heroically regardless.
"I came up with the idea that
there's kind of a pause button," said

Clint Wilkins, the project's director of
education. "What we hope to teach
kids is to push that pause button in
their soundtrack and have some of
the lessons from social psychology
seep in and, in psychological terms, fill
that space between stimulus and re
sponse."
Zimbardo says the initial impetus
for the project came from his own ex
periences while writing his 2007 book
"The Lucifer Effect: Understanding
How Good People Turn Evil" and a
personal realization that the psycho
logical mechanisms mediating "evil"
