## Zimbardo begins Heroic Imagination Project 
### ELLORA ISRANI CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Three decades after his infamous
Stanford Prison Experiment proved
that "terrifyingly normal" individuals
can commit alarming atrocities, Philip
Zimbardo, professor emeritus in psy
chology, has set out to communicate
the opposite: that in all situations,
these same people can speak out
against evil and become heroes.
Zimbardo has substantiated this
notion through the inception of the
Heroic Imagination Project. The
project, which currently includes a
comprehensive website as well as ed
ucation programs for high schools
students, seeks to publicize the term
"heroic imagination," referring to the
idea that anyone can become a hero
by utilizing his or her imagination.

He intends to "democratize the
concept of heroism" and erase the no
tion that heroes are "extraordinary
people." He explains them instead as
"ordinary people who in a particular
situation do an extraordinary thing."
Although the project was original
ly a collaboration between a number
of unpaid individuals, funding has re
cently come from a number of indi
viduals and foundations. This money
has been used to set up a small office
in San Francisco's Presidio district
and expand the website to include a
comprehensive explanation of the
"heroic imagination."
The Heroic Imagination Project's
pilot program began last September
at two local high schools: ARISE
High School in Oakland, which has a
mostly low-income, minority student
body, and Foothill Middle College in

Los Altos, a more middle-class envi
ronment.
Students spent the fall semester
learning the principles of social psy
chology that relate to heroism. They
watched videos of such famous ex
periments as Stanley Milgram's 1963
study on obedience to authority and
Zimbardo's own prison study.
Through a basic knowledge of psy
chology, students gained an under
standing of the power of the situation
over their own behavior as well as
how to surpass these influences and
act heroically regardless.
"I came up with the idea that
there's kind of a pause button," said

Clint Wilkins, the project's director of
education. "What we hope to teach
kids is to push that pause button in
their soundtrack and have some of
the lessons from social psychology
seep in and, in psychological terms, fill
that space between stimulus and re
sponse."
Zimbardo says the initial impetus
for the project came from his own ex
periences while writing his 2007 book
"The Lucifer Effect: Understanding
How Good People Turn Evil" and a
personal realization that the psycho
logical mechanisms mediating "evil"
behavior are far better researched
than those regarding "good" behav
ior.

The book "is fifteen chapters of
grim, grim, grim, and I was up to here
in evil," Zimbardo said. "And I felt
that I needed a respite and the read
er would too. So the last chapter is
essentially about goodness. [The]
first part of it is, how do you resist
these powerful forces that I had
helped create dehumanization,
deindividualization, obedience of
authority, diffusion of responsibility.
... and then I realized, during the lit
erature search, we know almost
nothing about heroism. There's no
systematic research."
This spring, students will develop
their own service projects in order to
exercise their "heroic imaginations."
They plan to identify those ordinary
individuals around them who have
committed heroic deeds and to docu
ment their stories.
Furthermore, the project has part
nered students from Woodside High
School with residents at Palo Alto's
Sunrise Senior Living in the "Tech-
Heroes" program, in which students
help the elderly use technology to im
prove their quality of life and archive
their wealth of knowledge.
"There's an old Indian saying I
love to quote. I don't know who said
it, but I love what it means," said Jenny
Donegan, manager of the Tech-
Heroes Project. "It says that when an
old person dies, a library burns. So one
of the beautiful things about every
participant in the Tech Heroes pro
gram is that they have opportunities
to become heroes in their own stories
and in the stories of others."
Zimbardo hopes to bring the con
cept of "heroism" a concept which
he believes has diminished over the
last decades â€”to the forefront of
worldwide thought.
Heroes "were always male war
riors Achilles, Agamemnon,
Odysseus," Zimbardo said. "It elimi

nates women, it eliminates young
people. These are male, adult killers,
essentially."
In fact, Zimbardo adds that even
modern heroes, like Mother Teresa,
Nelson Mandela, Martin Luther
King, Jr. and even Gandhi, "in away
are wrong heroes for the average
people."
"They organized their entire life
around service to humanity. For most
people, that's too much of a sacrifice.
.. step one is to change the concep
tion of heroes," he said.
Zimbardo also mentioned a
number of future initiatives, includ
ing a partnership with one of
China's top science and technology
schools, whose position as a feeder
school to the Chinese technology
industry could potentially produce
additional funding, and an online
"Heropedia" of individuals who
have come to embody the Heroic
Imagination Project's ideals. He has
already received commitments to
help build the site from individuals
at Google and Jimmy Wales,
founder of Wikipedia.
"The ultimate goal," Zimbardo
said, "is to make as many people as
possible, in every city and every state
and every nation, to fit our definition
of heroes."
