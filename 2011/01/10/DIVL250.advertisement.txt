WORLD WAR II AND
THE ORIGINS OF SOUTH
ASIAN STUDIES
It is commonly assumed that area studies programs in the
United States were born out of the cold war, but in fact they
began during World War 11, primarily in the Office of Strategic
Services, the precursor of the CIA.
I will review the origins of area studies in general, and
South Asian area studies in particular, by looking at the
organization of knowledge production in the Research and
Analysis Branch in Washington, as well as through OSS
activities in Asia itself. I will also comment on the growing
U.S. concern about, and opposition to, the continuation of
British imperial rule in India, in the context of newly emerging
US interests in South Asia and a different kind of post-war
world order.
I will conclude by making some observations about the
transformation of notions of empire and the ambivalent
relationship between espionage and research in the early
days of US area studies.
