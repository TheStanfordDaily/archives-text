# STETHOSCOPES, COMPILERS AND HEMINGWAY
## Practical Education 
### Aaditya Shidham 
Just three days ago, The New York
Times published an article enti
tled "Journal Showcases Dying
Art of the Research Paper," where
correspondent Sam Dillon talks
about the Concord Review and its
"cantankerous" publisher, William H.
Fitzhugh.This Review showcases high
school history papers of extraordinary
merit papers of the length and
quality that would be expected of a
postgraduate or advanced undergrad
uate of the field.

The very existence of such a Re view
(and the fact that it has been silently
sputtering along for over two decades)
tells us a lot about the state and the
philosophies of education today. I my
self have never written a paper of such
length or merit in my high school career
and I imagine many of my readers
have not either. Instead, I was slowly
honed in my high school career to write
short x-paragraph essays that clearly
defined a topic, added a bit of insight
culled with 15 minutes of thought, and
persuaded the layman effectively.
It was practical writing, above all,
not with the insight of a historian per
se, but with the insight of a common
man locked in a room with historical
documents, struggling to say some
thing unique about them. No matter

what it was called, no matter how long
the list of citations was, it was not a re
search project. It was instead the
"Powerpoint lecture" of papers, with
all of its alacrity and all of its banality.
I realized that in my personal aca
demic maturation, exposure to this
type of writing, done by people who
were my age, could have defined my
early relationship with history as a sub
ject. It could have moved it from the
practical What does the Civil Rights
Act 0f1964 mean for modern society?
—to the philosophical How does
the notion of Muslim fraternity define
the Arab world?
The latter is of the rare breed of
questions that have nonetheless
plagued presidents and history schol
ars and have really come to define the
nature of historical scholarship and
modern events. And I tell you, I would
have thought about these questions
seriously because people my age have
thought and written whole 22 page pa
pers on them. They can think rigorous
ly, and so can I!
This should be the thought process
when any student is exposed to a field
of intellectual inquiry. Many of us are
college undergraduates now in the
last phase of our lives when we will be
exposed to introductory classes. Such

survey courses have come to define
the nature of the American liberal arts
curriculum. Yet especially at places
like Stanford a survey course aims
to give the wide-eyed newcomer the
"lay of the land." Such an act is a well
intentioned but naive way to intro
duce students to a field. It only makes
the less confident cower in fear and the
more confident make flash cards.
What is needed in its stead is a focus
on the values of a field coupled with
it a penetrating focus on two or three
specific answers or applications that
have defined some contour of the
field. This reframing of introductory
education does two large things: it de
fines the thought process of a field to
its newest observers, and, more impor
tantly, it gives people something to as
pire to in a field. It replaces their sense
of foreign-ness in this new area with
the tools to contribute and communi
cate, even in the smallest of ways. More
classes should take a page from CS
106A in this regard and force them,

even with their admittedly pathetic
corpus of knowledge, to make some
thing awesome from that corpus.
When I hear my fellow students
complain about a class, it often is the
case that the class fails to give them
the larger picture, the context that
makes all their facts useful as non
practitioners. Two decades from now,
we may not remember the practical
facts about a subject. But we will re
member the single concept that de
fined the class and the enormous
pillars that were laid before us in 10
weeks time.

This is why I ask Stanford and
just about every other elite university
in America to introduce us to fields
well. You are atop an ivory tower. You
are not a school that prepares students
for an industry, nor for a vocation.
Don't stoop to that practical lens of
education when you give students an
introduction to a field. We can look up
the "lay of the land" ourselves with
Wikipedia. We don't need awesome
professors for that. We need awesome
professors to give us depth the
kind that can't easily be found online.
In this age of forgettable facts, we
need something unforgettable: wis
dom.

tical education? You can always insult

complain about a class, it often is the
case that the class fails to give them
the larger picture, the context that
makes all their facts useful as non
practitioners. Two decades from now,
we may not remember the practical
facts about a subject. But we will re
member the single concept that de
fined the class and the enormous
pillars that were laid before us in 10
weeks time.

This is why I ask Stanford and
just about every other elite university
in America to introduce us to fields
well. You are atop an ivory tower. You
are not a school that prepares students
for an industry, nor for a vocation.
Don't stoop to that practical lens of
education when you give students an
introduction to a field. We can look up
the "lay of the land" ourselves with
Wikipedia. We don't need awesome
professors for that. We need awesome
professors to give us depth the
kind that can't easily be found online.
In this age of forgettable facts, we
need something unforgettable: wis
dom.

Want to giveAaditya a little bit of prac
tical education? You can always insult
