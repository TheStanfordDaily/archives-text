## Achieving New Year's Resolutions 
### Stewart Macgregor-Dennis 
We're all Stanford students
who want our lives to have
an impact. If you're like
me, you spend a lot of time thinking
and reading about how to become
more effective. I've had awesome
conversations with people about
achieving goals and resolutions and
read a lot of books, yet this is the
first time I've written any of this
down. If you have any thoughts,
don't let this remain a monologue;
let's talk.

Start small; it's all about momen
tum, so build from the bottom up.
Make things as simple and concise
as possible. Let the words express
ing the resolution have more mean
ing to you than to others. Word res
olutions as if you've already
achieved them. Phrase them in
terms of what you do rather than
what you don't do. Use the SMART
criteria for your resolutions spe
cific, measurable, attainable, rele
vant and time-bound. Check that
your resolutions don't conflict; go
beyond this: align them. Write down
your goals on a piece of paper.
Achieve your resolution on the

shoulders of giants by modeling
their behavior. Make a plan for how
to deal with the temptation to break
the resolutions. Take care of the
downside, and the upside will take
care of itself. Tell yourself that you
must do it, rather than that you will.
This will transform hundreds of de
cisions into one.
Setting the goal is only the begin
ning. A few factors have a dispro
portionate impact. 20 percent of
your efforts account for 80 percent
of the results. Think about what to
do first.
Develop self-knowledge and
pay attention to yourself. Cultivate
your positive emotions. Negative
emotions tell you something, so
don't ignore them. Your resolutions
are probably what you want to want
to do; make yourself want to do
them. Behavior is driven towards
pleasure and away from pain. Asso
ciate achieving your goal with
something you like and not achiev
ing it with something you don't.
Program your subconscious; give it
stuff to think about. Examine your
beliefs about yourself. If they are

limiting, address them. When you
change what you believe, you
change what you do.
Become the kind of person who
lives by the resolutions you have
set. Internalize every lesson into
your behavior. It's not enough to
"know the good." Take responsibil
ity; make it a part of you, a part of
your active thinking. Knowledge is
not powerful if you don't use or
apply it.
Focus your mind and energy on
what you're trying to achieve.
Thinking is usually a process of ask
ing and answering questions; ask
the right questions. Carefully decide
how to spend your time and then to
tally focus on one goal per block of
time. Positively visualize how you'll
achieve the resolution; think
through the required steps. Make
the journey enjoyable rather than
just the result. The achievement of
the result happens in an instant; the
journey is immeasurably longer.
Do something small to start to
wards the goal. Research shows that
people are more likely to achieve a
goal that they've made 20 percent
of progress on than one that is only
80 percent as long. Focus on the
distinction between activity and
productivity. Be efficient. Take ac
tion. Only expend energy on things
over which have control or influ
ence. See every step back as a
chance to learn. Make automatic
triggers for your behavior. Make it
a ritual in your day or week. Take
control of the time between when
something happens and your re
sponse. Choose how to interpret
any situation relating to the reso
lution; mentally redefine it.

Keep going. Repetition forms
habits. Keep track of progress; re
view your goals on a regular basis.
Help others achieve their goals and
have others help you. If your goal
includes other people, include
them as early as possible. If you
can, tell them what you're going to
do and by when. Declare some of
your goals publicly. When you tell
others, still take total responsibili
ty. Surround yourself with people
who already do your resolution.
You inevitably pick up traits from
those around whom you hang out.
If you want to become a leader,
hang out with leaders.
That's pretty much it; remem
ber, it's all about momentum. Build
it and you'll rock these resolutions.
