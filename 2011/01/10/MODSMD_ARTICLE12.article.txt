# LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
## Perhaps we need to reimagine 'community' 
### 
Dear Editor,
I think it more than coincidence
that the column "Diversity and
Friendship" and the article on social
networking sites underemphasizing
loneliness appeared on the same
day ("Sense and Nonsense: Diversi
ty and Friendship" and "Study
shows social networking sites can
lead to negative self-image," Jan. 7).
Columnist Aysha Bagchi wrote
that "I found myself envying people
who were materially less fortunate.
Friends who have volunteered in re
mote places in other parts of the
world ... have told me similar sto
ries of communities with fewer
iPods but, in my friends' eyes, more
meaning." While the thrust of the
column was promoting diversity of
friendship, this statement hit me the
hardest. In a generation that com

municates through technology
übiquitously (save the dinner table
or discussion section), we have
given up the treasure of binding
ourselves to a real, living, breathing
community. We often look at those
who are economically and socially
less fortunate through the lens that
they lack the resources and capabil
ities technology affords the privi
leged. This view, however, ignores
what the less fortunate have the
strength of community and real re
lationships.

The research done on social net
working found (unsurprisingly)
that people underestimated the
loneliness of others, in turn hurting
their own well-being. But in a cul
ture where communication is virtu
al, feelings cannot be mutually
shared or understood. With the wall
of technology, time and to-do lists
perennially in front of us, we not
only block ourselves from meaning
ful relationships, but we don't allow

ourselves to reap the benefit of
community. Our sense of others
arises from a distorted imagination
dictated by the media and the flurry
of Facebook posts and statuses.
Aysha and her friends are not
the only ones to observe that the
technology-poor are the communi
ty-rich. Interdependence (on more
than a problem set) brings forth
something that a wall-to-wall or
passing relationship cannot provide.
The challenge, however, is not to
simply take the "principle" of need
ing deeper relationships away from
both pieces. I see the challenge to
question not only our dependence
on the material to sustain our rela
tionships, but also the need to ques
tion our lack of dependence on
community. It's difficult to see value
in sharing time and joy, living pur
posefully in a community and in
vesting oneself in others in our "i"
society filled with iPods, iPads,
iPhones, ißooks, and the simple "I"
that individualism heralds as
supreme.
Perhaps it's not simply our
friendships we need to re-imagine
maybe it's our concept of com
munity. I thank both authors for
their pieces, but hope that a larger
discourse on what real community
looks like can emerge from these
pages.
