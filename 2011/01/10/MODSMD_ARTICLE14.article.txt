# I applaud Luck's decision

Dear Editor:
Stanford quarterback Andrew
Luck has decided not to declare for
the 2011 NFL Draft but instead re
turn to college for his senior season,
which may see both a national
championship and a Heisman Tro
phy added to his already-impressive
resume ("Our lucky day," Jan. 7).

I'm a college student and I love
when student-athletes decide to put
off their dreams for a year or two
and return back to school to receive
their respective degrees and enjoy
the college experience while they
are able to. In Mr. Luck's case, the
circumstances are a bit different.
If he had entered in the draft for
this upcoming season, he would not
have the burden of a potential re
striction on rookie contracts, but by
waiting another year he faces the
possibility of having to deal with a
restriction on rookie contracts. For
many people, especially younger
student-athletes, knowing $5O to
$6O million is just one "yes" away
would have them jumping for joy
and they would be on the phone as
quick as they could reach one.
By staying in college, Mr. Luck
only delayed the inevitable a year
longer. Either this year or next, he's
within the top five picks and the
best all-around quarterback in the
draft. I'm from the state of Ten
nessee, where 14 years ago Peyton
Manning returned to college for his
senior season and it turned out
great for himself and the Indianapo
lis Colts.

I applaud Mr. Luck's decision
and look forward to seeing him on
Sundays. I just have to wait an extra
year. I wish Mr. Luck the best of
luck in what's left of his college ca
reer and in his future NFL career.
May God bless him.
