## SMOOTH SAILING No questions left as Card routs Arizona State 
### NATE ADAMS DESK EDITOR 
It was no secret that Stanford women's bas
ketball had been playing well heading into Satur
day's matchup with Arizona State. The No. 4 Car
dinal (12-2,3-0 Pac-10) turned heads across the
nation with its 12-point upset of national-champi
on Connecticut, and then kicked off the confer
ence season with convincing victories over Cali
fornia and Arizona. But no one was expecting
Stanford to blow away the Sun Devils quite the
way it did.
Stanford left Arizona State (10-4,2-2) looking
for answers following an 82-35 rout on Saturday
afternoon, posting its sixth win in a row while put
ting ASU into a two-game skid, the team's first
losing streak of the season. Senior guard Jeanette
Pohlen led the explosive Cardinal offense with 7-
for-10 shooting and 18 points, while junior for
ward Nnemkadi Ogwumike added 16 of her
own, along with eight rebounds.
"Arizona State is an excellent team. Our team
knew that. I thought we just had to come out and
jump right on them, and we did," said Stanford
head coach Tara VanDerveer.
Stanford certainly wasted no time getting out
in front. The Cardinal worked a tough player-to
player defense from the outset, holding the Sun
Devils to low-percentage shots while working ag
gressively to the hoop on the other end. Nnemka
di Ogwumike drove hard to the basket like she
did in her 24-point effort against Arizona two
days earlier, putting up a pair of layups in the first
two minutes. Pohlen added an uncontested three
pointer from the wing to put the Card up 9-0,
forcing an early timeout from ASU head coach
Charli Turner Thorne.
Stanford didn't let up from there. Barely eight
minutes into the game, the Sun Devils found

themselves facing an 18-3 deficit.
Thorne responded by subbing out all five
players a few minutes later, and the rapid change
in individual matchups helped boost the Sun
Devils to a short 7-2 run to pull within 20-10.
But with Pohlen driving harder to the hoop
and Nnemkadi Ogwumike making a few trips to
the free-throw line, the Cardinal was able to
maintain distance. Stanford went on a 13-0 run of
its own to bring the score to 33-10 before heading
to the locker room with a 42-14 lead.
At the half, the Cardinal had been shooting
18-for-28 while holding ASU to just 5-for-25.
Nnemkadi Ogwumike was already 7-for-ll all on
her own, highlighted by a look-easy steal just out
side the ASU key and a smooth run in for a layup.
Pohlen helped send Stanford to the half with a
bang as well, notching a nothing-but-net three
pointer from a full step beyond the arc in the final
seconds.
"We just were focusing on what [ASU] was
giving us," Ogwumike said about her team's of
fense on Saturday. "Just making smart plays. And
I think people were just ready to go from the
start. We weren't going to have any letdowns."

Pohlen and Nnemkadi Ogwumike may have
provided plenty of firepower, but as Stanford
continued to snuff out the brief offensive sparks
from ASU in the second half, it became clear that
the Cardinal was also locked in on defense.
Perhaps most impressive was junior guard
Lindy La Rocque, who all but shut down ASU's
Dymond Simon. The Sun Devil guard had aver
aged over 14 points per game on the season, but
La Rocque held her to a single three-pointer in
all the time she was defending her. Simon fin
ished the game with seven points.
"Lindy did a great job," VanDerveer said. "I
love how people like [recent graduate Rosalyn
Gold-Onwude] stepped up like that on defense,
and got in the game because of her defense. I
think Chiney [Ogwumike] and Lindy and other
people are really understanding that's what
they're going to do, too."
The Cardinal bench played a bigger role as the
game wore on, but the general trend was still the
same. Stanford may have hit a stumbling block
when it lost to DePaul and Tennessee last month,
