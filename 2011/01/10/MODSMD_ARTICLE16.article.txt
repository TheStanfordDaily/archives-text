## 
### CAROLINE CASELLI DESK EDITOR 
Just days after a promising road vic
tory at Arizona State, the Stanford
men's basketball team fell to Arizona,
67-57, despite a last-ditch comeback
attempt.The Cardinal (9-5,2-1 Pac-10)
suffered its first conference loss of the
season while Arizona (14-3, 3-1) re
mains undefeated on its home court
and improves to second in the confer
ence standings.
Sunday's game, which was original
ly scheduled for Saturday afternoon,
was postponed after the shooting of
Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Ariz., and
others during a public appearance in
Tucson on Saturday. Following a state
ment from University of Arizona pres
ident Robert Shelton, players, coaches
and fans observed a moment of silence
for the shooting victims who are
being treated at nearby University
Medical Center before the game
commenced.
"We wanted to make sure we re
spected a tragic situation and a loss of
life and injuries it was an easy deci
sion," said head coach Johnny
Dawkins on the game's rescheduling.
"We could have postponed to the next
day or whenever they wanted to
reschedule it. You have to respect the

process of what happened and the
people involved."
Sporting sleek black uniforms,
Stanford opened with an impressive
12-6 start aided by crisp passes from
junior guard Jarrett Mann and redshirt
junior forward Josh Owens' low-post
presence. Freshman forward Dwight
Powell, who made his second consecu
tive start, contributed five early points
but quickly picked up two fouls and
exited the game for the remainder of
the half
With Powell on the bench, the
Wildcats opened a gap midway
through the first half, when efficient
ball movement along the perimeter
was met by slow defensive rotations by
Stanford. Numerous traveling viola
tions by the Wildcats allowed the Car
dinal tostayinthe game,but anB-orun
late in the first period gave Arizona a
29-22 lead. A resounding tip-slam at
the buzzer from Arizona senior for
ward Jamelle Home ended the half 39-
28 in the home team's favor.
"[Home] played like a senior
tonight," Dawkins said. "He was real
active and made plays and knocked
down his open looks."

utes of the second half, but Stanford's
tepid long-range shooting and inabili
ty to rebound proved detrimental,
with Home and sophomore forwards
Derrick Williams and Solomon Hill
leading the Wildcats to a 15-point
lead, their largest of the night.
"They just outfought us out there,"
said junior guard Jeremy Green.
"[Playing zone] we really don't have
to box out the opponent and we just
have to fight for the rebounds. Ari
zona crashed really hard and we gave
up a lot of second chance points be
cause of that."
The Card refused to roll over
with four minutes remaining in the
game, Stanford rallied to bring the
score within five. However, turnovers
and missed opportunities in the final
stretch on one possession, Mann
stepped out of bounds on an attempt
ed pass to Green, only to be an
swered by a three-pointer from
Home enabled Arizona to hold
on for the win. A layup by Arizona
sophomore guard Lamont Jones,
who hit a game-winner for the Wild
cats in Maples Pavilion last season,
sealed the game, 67-57.
Owens' 18 points on 9-for-17
shooting and three rebounds led the
way for the Card. Green was 5-for-14
from the floor and l-for-5 from be
hind the arc, though eight of his 15

points came in the game's final nine
minutes.
Home posted season-high num
bers with 16 points (6-for-7 from the
field, 4-for-4 from three-point range)
and 12 rebounds, while Williams
added 14 points and nine rebounds.
The Wildcats outrebounded the Car
dinal by a 41-26 margin and shot 58.8
percent from behind the arc to Stan
ford's 16.7 percent.
"We're always going to work and
compete to the very end," Green sad.
"Today, we just weren't able to pull it
out."
Next up for the Card is Washing
ton, which stands alone atop the con
ference as the only undefeated team
in Pac-10 play. Tipoff is at 7 p.m. on
Thursday at Maples Pavilion.
