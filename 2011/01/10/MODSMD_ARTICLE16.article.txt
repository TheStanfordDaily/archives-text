## 
### CAROLINE CASELLI DESK EDITOR 
Just days after a promising road vic
tory at Arizona State, the Stanford
men's basketball team fell to Arizona,
67-57, despite a last-ditch comeback
attempt.The Cardinal (9-5,2-1 Pac-10)
suffered its first conference loss of the
season while Arizona (14-3, 3-1) re
mains undefeated on its home court
and improves to second in the confer
ence standings.
Sunday's game, which was original
ly scheduled for Saturday afternoon,
was postponed after the shooting of
Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Ariz., and
others during a public appearance in
Tucson on Saturday. Following a state
ment from University of Arizona pres
ident Robert Shelton, players, coaches
and fans observed a moment of silence
for the shooting victims who are
being treated at nearby University
Medical Center before the game
commenced.
"We wanted to make sure we re
spected a tragic situation and a loss of
life and injuries it was an easy deci
sion," said head coach Johnny
Dawkins on the game's rescheduling.
"We could have postponed to the next
day or whenever they wanted to
reschedule it. You have to respect the

process of what happened and the
people involved."
Sporting sleek black uniforms,
Stanford opened with an impressive
12-6 start aided by crisp passes from
junior guard Jarrett Mann and redshirt
junior forward Josh Owens' low-post
presence. Freshman forward Dwight
Powell, who made his second consecu
tive start, contributed five early points
but quickly picked up two fouls and
exited the game for the remainder of
the half
With Powell on the bench, the
Wildcats opened a gap midway
through the first half, when efficient
ball movement along the perimeter
was met by slow defensive rotations by
Stanford. Numerous traveling viola
tions by the Wildcats allowed the Car
dinal tostayinthe game,but anB-orun
late in the first period gave Arizona a
29-22 lead. A resounding tip-slam at
the buzzer from Arizona senior for
ward Jamelle Home ended the half 39-
28 in the home team's favor.
"[Home] played like a senior
tonight," Dawkins said. "He was real
active and made plays and knocked
down his open looks."
