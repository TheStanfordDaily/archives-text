## A 						unique perspective on football 
### 
A few weeks ago one of
my friends, a fellow for
eigner, accused me of
being close-minded
when it comes to Amer
ican sports. In a desperate attempt to
prove him wrong, and because the be
ginning of a new year is the perfect
time to make a change, I'm going to
devote the entirety of this column to
football, promising not to mention a
single overseas sport.
Unfortunately for my fledgling in
terest and understanding, I wasn't on
the Farm this past fall quarter during
the most successful regular season in
Stanford football history, and was
similarly stuck back home in the UK
last week, when the Card won its first
ever BCS bowl. Faced with having to
tune in from across the pond, in the
middle of a cold and damp English
night, and unable to summon the sort
of all-encompassing football knowl
edge of my fellow Daily columnists, I
hope you're not expecting anything
too incisive.
Football still makes my brain hurt:
just when I think I know what is going
on, one of the many referees will
throw down a flag and declare a mys
teriously unexplained infringement.
Thankfully, though, I have ESPN to
keep me company. I mostly watch
sports on various channels under the
umbrella of Sky Sports, and they gen
erally do a great job. When it comes to
the NFL, though, it feels weird. I still
struggle to have much of an interest in
the world of professional football, but
the biggest impediment to my growth
is having to listen to British people
talk about it.
Coverage of American sports
should be big, brash and come with a
thick American accent. I don't trust
British voices because I can't really be
sure they know anything about the
sport. Their very presence just seems
unpatriotic why aren't they com
mentating on our own English sports?
So my thanks go out to ESPN for sim
ply relaying the same feed that surely
went out in the U.S. It was everything
I could have dreamed of: loud, flashy,
full of references I didn't understand
and complete with made-up words
like "winningest" (which is not in the
Oxford English Dictionary).
Fueled by coffee and chocolate,
the first half of the Orange Bowl left
me wishing Virginia Tech's quarter
back had lined up in Cardinal colors.
Stanford seemed to stutter its way
through and just held onto a one
point lead, while it seemed that Tyrod
Taylor was almost single-handedly
turning the tide.To be honest, though,
the main reason behind this wish of
mine was that it would be pretty cool
to get a Cardinal jersey with T. Taylor
emblazoned across the back.
I began to regret my musings in
the second half as Stanford quarter
back Andrew Luck made it clear why
he was the favorite to be the first pick
in the NFL Draft and the Cardinal
defense turned up the heat on Taylor,
sacking him for some heavy losses.
Fortunately, we have a Taylor of our
own, running back Stepfan Taylor,
who made a couple of impressive
long rushes in the second half, putting
the Cardinal in position to score
touchdowns and keeping alive my

dreams of getting a shirt with my
name on it.
My fear is that by the time I'm
back and better educated for next
football season, the outlook for Stan
ford football may be very different.
As I admit to not being a die-hard
fan, my interest in what happens in
Stanford Stadium is strongly linked
to success: if the team racks up loss
after loss it might not take much to
find another weekend distraction.
With Luck now committed to return,
it is up to Jim Harbaugh's replace
ment to decide how much time I'll
devote to the Red Zone. To the cha
grin of the die-hard fans, the same
holds true for many other students.
It would be hard to argue that this
year's team wouldn't have been even
stronger if Toby Gerhart had stayed
for his final year of eligibility.
Whether that would have made a dif
ference in the game against Oregon is
something we can never know. Per
haps Stanford might not have won
the Orange Bowl last week, but could
instead be warming up for an im
probable national championship
game. Maybe this thought was as big
an influence on Luck as his desire to
complete his degree. Luck seems as
sured of a star-studded career. Stay
ing one more year is a big risk for him,
but brings the possibility of achieving
something really special on the Farm.
This year's success was impressive,
but could a multi-year winning streak
do more than just bring admirers?
Could Stanford become a real foot
ball school?
Another friend of mine, a partisan
Longhorns fan, recently pointed out:
"It's weird seeing actual football
players on campus."
I hope they're here to stay.

Tom Taylor may be a fair-weather fan
when it comes to football, but he's
eager to learn. Teach him a thing or
two at tom.taylor@stanford.edu.

thick American accent. I don't trust
British voices because I can't really be
sure they know anything about the
sport. Their very presence just seems
unpatriotic why aren't they com
mentating on our own English sports?
So my thanks go out to ESPN for sim
ply relaying the same feed that surely
went out in the U.S. It was everything
I could have dreamed of: loud, flashy,
full of references I didn't understand
and complete with made-up words
like "winningest" (which is not in the
Oxford English Dictionary).
Fueled by coffee and chocolate,
the first half of the Orange Bowl left
me wishing Virginia Tech's quarter
back had lined up in Cardinal colors.
Stanford seemed to stutter its way
through and just held onto a one
point lead, while it seemed that Tyrod
Taylor was almost single-handedly
turning the tide.To be honest, though,
the main reason behind this wish of
mine was that it would be pretty cool
to get a Cardinal jersey with T. Taylor
emblazoned across the back.
I began to regret my musings in
the second half as Stanford quarter
back Andrew Luck made it clear why
he was the favorite to be the first pick
in the NFL Draft and the Cardinal
defense turned up the heat on Taylor,
sacking him for some heavy losses.
Fortunately, we have a Taylor of our
own, running back Stepfan Taylor,
who made a couple of impressive
long rushes in the second half, putting
the Cardinal in position to score
touchdowns and keeping alive my

dreams of getting a shirt with my
name on it.
My fear is that by the time I'm
back and better educated for next
football season, the outlook for Stan
ford football may be very different.
As I admit to not being a die-hard
fan, my interest in what happens in
Stanford Stadium is strongly linked
to success: if the team racks up loss
after loss it might not take much to
find another weekend distraction.
With Luck now committed to return,
it is up to Jim Harbaugh's replace
ment to decide how much time I'll
devote to the Red Zone. To the cha
grin of the die-hard fans, the same
holds true for many other students.
It would be hard to argue that this
year's team wouldn't have been even
stronger if Toby Gerhart had stayed
for his final year of eligibility.
Whether that would have made a dif
ference in the game against Oregon is
something we can never know. Per
haps Stanford might not have won
the Orange Bowl last week, but could
instead be warming up for an im
probable national championship
game. Maybe this thought was as big
an influence on Luck as his desire to
complete his degree. Luck seems as
sured of a star-studded career. Stay
ing one more year is a big risk for him,
but brings the possibility of achieving
something really special on the Farm.
This year's success was impressive,
but could a multi-year winning streak
do more than just bring admirers?
Could Stanford become a real foot
ball school?
Another friend of mine, a partisan
Longhorns fan, recently pointed out:
"It's weird seeing actual football
players on campus."
I hope they're here to stay.

Tom Taylor may be a fair-weather fan
when it comes to football, but he's
eager to learn. Teach him a thing or
two at tom.taylor@stanford.edu.
