# Harbaugh's future in the NFL: success not guaranteed
## 
### Daniel Bohm On My Mind 
Last week I got an e-mail from
a friend who graduated from
Stanford a few years ago sug
gesting that Jim Harbaugh
should have a one-hour TV
special with Jim Gray to announce his
"decision" on where he will coach next
season.
This was obviously an allusion to
Leßron James' "The Decision," and
while the national courtship of Har
baugh may not have reached epic
James proportions, it sure came close.
From the ways in which he was pur
sued, one would think that Harbaugh
was a messiah sure to turn a decrepit
San Francisco franchise into the peren
nial contender that it used to be.
I'm going to suggest something that
49ers fans and even most Stanford
fans (even the bitter ones who felt
dumped Friday afternoon) proba
bly don't want to hear: Jim Harbaugh,
in all likelihood, will not be the savior
for the Niners that he was for Stanford.
In fact, he very well might be a huge dis
appointment. Blasphemy, I know.
History isn't exactly on Harbaugh's
side. In recent years, successful, highly
coveted college coaches that have
turned to the pro ranks have widely
failed.
Example one: Steve Spurrier.
Spurrier left his post at the University
of Florida to become the coach of the
Washington Redskins in 2002. Seen as
a can't-miss coach, he was given the
most lucrative contract in NFL histo
ry at the time (five-year, $25 million
exactly what Harbaugh received
from San Francisco). Two years, 12
wins and 20 losses later, Spurrier was
done in the NFL. He now coaches at
South Carolina.
Example two: Butch Davis. Butch
Davis was probably as equipped as any
college coach headed to the pros his
Miami Hurricane teams were chock
full of future NFL stars. Still, he man
aged just a 24-35 record in three and a
half seasons as the Cleveland Browns
head coach from 2001-2004. Like
Spurrier, Davis is back in the college
game, coaching North Carolina.
Example three: Nick Saban. Like
Spurrier, Saban was a previous nation
al championship-winning coach when
he took an NFL job. Saban left LSU to
lead the Miami Dolphins in 2005. He
coached two seasons, neither of which
netted a playoff appearance, and was
seen as a disappointment. With a 15-17
record overall, he was out as Dolphins
coach. Saban, too, is back in the college
game, and he won his second national
championship last season at Alabama.
Example four: Bobby Petrino. After
leading Louisville to an unexpected Or
ange Bowl victory (sound familiar,
Stanford fans?) Petrino became head
coach for the Atlanta Falcons. His first
and only season with the Falcons can be
described as nothing short of a disaster.

He resigned midway through the year,
after going 3-10, to take his current job
with the University of Arkansas
It isn't just in recent years that
coaches have flopped in the NFL. Lou
Holtz famously failed as New York Jets
coach in 1976. Some of you may point
to Pete Carroll leading the Seattle Sea
hawks to the playoffs this year (with a 7-
9 record, no less) as a sign of success for
a college-turned-pro coach. I would say
that the jury is still out. After all, Carroll
struggled in previous stints as an NFL
coach with both the Jets and the New
England Patriots.
So what is the lesson here? Success
in the college ranks does not necessari
ly translate to the NFL. All four of the
above examples have succeeded in
their second stints in the NCAA but
couldn't cut it in the NFL.
What is the difference, you might
ask? There are many.
First, and foremost, recruiting is lost
in the NFL. Half the battle in college is
getting good players to come to your
school, a big reason Harbaugh turned
the Stanford program around. He was
able to get blue-chip recruits like An
drew Luck and Shayne Skov to come to
the Farm. In the NFL there is less
courtship, as money is king (insert Cam
Newton joke here).
Second, NFL players are paid pro
fessionals who see their coaches more
as peers and less as superiors. That
means strict discipline is not responded
to as well in the NFL, and players are
less likely to react well to the collegiate
rah-rah attitude of many college coach
es, such as Harbaugh.
Lastly, there are the obvious rule
differences between the NFL and col
lege games. Many of the imaginative,
unbalanced sets that Harbaugh used
at Stanford aren't allowed in the NFL.
Overall, the NFL limits the creativity
of coaches. This isn't to say that Har
baugh can't maximize his creativity
within these boundaries. He probably
can and will, but a significant differ
ence remains.
So will Harbaugh succeed in San
Francisco? Maybe, but I wouldn't bet
on it. It's not like the 49ers have a loaded
roster (or a quarterback), and history
isn't exactly on his side. If Harbaugh is
back coaching at the college level in a
few years, this writer won't be particu
larly surprised.

Daniel Bohm wishes Harbaugh the
best, but is keeping history in mind. Tell
him you're not bitter either at

Last week I got an e-mail from
a friend who graduated from
Stanford a few years ago sug
gesting that Jim Harbaugh
should have a one-hour TV
special with Jim Gray to announce his
"decision" on where he will coach next
season.
This was obviously an allusion to
Leßron James' "The Decision," and
while the national courtship of Har
baugh may not have reached epic
James proportions, it sure came close.
From the ways in which he was pur
sued, one would think that Harbaugh
was a messiah sure to turn a decrepit
San Francisco franchise into the peren
nial contender that it used to be.
I'm going to suggest something that
49ers fans and even most Stanford
fans (even the bitter ones who felt
dumped Friday afternoon) proba
bly don't want to hear: Jim Harbaugh,
in all likelihood, will not be the savior
for the Niners that he was for Stanford.
In fact, he very well might be a huge dis
appointment. Blasphemy, I know.
History isn't exactly on Harbaugh's
side. In recent years, successful, highly
coveted college coaches that have
turned to the pro ranks have widely
failed.
Example one: Steve Spurrier.
Spurrier left his post at the University
of Florida to become the coach of the
Washington Redskins in 2002. Seen as
a can't-miss coach, he was given the
most lucrative contract in NFL histo
ry at the time (five-year, $25 million
exactly what Harbaugh received
from San Francisco). Two years, 12
wins and 20 losses later, Spurrier was
done in the NFL. He now coaches at
South Carolina.
Example two: Butch Davis. Butch
Davis was probably as equipped as any
college coach headed to the pros his
Miami Hurricane teams were chock
full of future NFL stars. Still, he man
aged just a 24-35 record in three and a
half seasons as the Cleveland Browns
head coach from 2001-2004. Like
Spurrier, Davis is back in the college
game, coaching North Carolina.
Example three: Nick Saban. Like
Spurrier, Saban was a previous nation
al championship-winning coach when
he took an NFL job. Saban left LSU to
lead the Miami Dolphins in 2005. He
coached two seasons, neither of which
netted a playoff appearance, and was
seen as a disappointment. With a 15-17
record overall, he was out as Dolphins
coach. Saban, too, is back in the college
game, and he won his second national
championship last season at Alabama.
Example four: Bobby Petrino. After
leading Louisville to an unexpected Or
ange Bowl victory (sound familiar,
Stanford fans?) Petrino became head
coach for the Atlanta Falcons. His first
and only season with the Falcons can be
described as nothing short of a disaster.

He resigned midway through the year,
after going 3-10, to take his current job
with the University of Arkansas
It isn't just in recent years that
coaches have flopped in the NFL. Lou
Holtz famously failed as New York Jets
coach in 1976. Some of you may point
to Pete Carroll leading the Seattle Sea
hawks to the playoffs this year (with a 7-
9 record, no less) as a sign of success for
a college-turned-pro coach. I would say
that the jury is still out. After all, Carroll
struggled in previous stints as an NFL
coach with both the Jets and the New
England Patriots.
So what is the lesson here? Success
in the college ranks does not necessari
ly translate to the NFL. All four of the
above examples have succeeded in
their second stints in the NCAA but
couldn't cut it in the NFL.
What is the difference, you might
ask? There are many.
First, and foremost, recruiting is lost
in the NFL. Half the battle in college is
getting good players to come to your
school, a big reason Harbaugh turned
the Stanford program around. He was
able to get blue-chip recruits like An
drew Luck and Shayne Skov to come to
the Farm. In the NFL there is less
courtship, as money is king (insert Cam
Newton joke here).
Second, NFL players are paid pro
fessionals who see their coaches more
as peers and less as superiors. That
means strict discipline is not responded
to as well in the NFL, and players are
less likely to react well to the collegiate
rah-rah attitude of many college coach
es, such as Harbaugh.
Lastly, there are the obvious rule
differences between the NFL and col
lege games. Many of the imaginative,
unbalanced sets that Harbaugh used
at Stanford aren't allowed in the NFL.
Overall, the NFL limits the creativity
of coaches. This isn't to say that Har
baugh can't maximize his creativity
within these boundaries. He probably
can and will, but a significant differ
ence remains.
So will Harbaugh succeed in San
Francisco? Maybe, but I wouldn't bet
on it. It's not like the 49ers have a loaded
roster (or a quarterback), and history
isn't exactly on his side. If Harbaugh is
