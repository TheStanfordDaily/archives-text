# SO LONG, HARBAUGH

### KABIR SAWHNEY MANAGING EDITOR 
Stanford head coach Jim Har
baugh has decided to leave Cardinal
football to become head coach of
the NFL's San Francisco 49ers, it was
announced Friday. Harbaugh was
introduced as the 49ers' head coach
at a press conference on Friday af
ternoon.
"It's with humility and a heavy
heart that I leave Stanford and its
football team, but the opportunity
to compete at this level over
whelmed me," Harbaugh said.
ESPN reported that the five-year
deal will pay Harbaugh $5 million
annually.
Harbaugh first met with officials
from the 49ers on Wednesday,
where the team reportedly made its
offer to the coach. On Thursday,
Harbaugh met with the Miami Dol
phins and with top Stanford offi
cials, including University President
John Hennessy. Stanford offered
Harbaugh a new contract in those
meetings that reportedly came close
to the 49ers' offer in financial terms.
Hennessy and Bob Bowlsby,
Stanford's athletic director, both re
leased statements in the wake of
Harbaugh's departure.
"We are grateful to Jim Har
baugh for re-energizing the Stan
ford football program over the past
four years," Hennessy said. "He
helped build momentum that we are
confident will continue into the fu
ture. We made Jim the best offer we
could commensurate with our role
as a university."
"Jim Harbaugh has done an out
standing job of advancing the foot
ball program at Stanford University
and I am grateful for all of his
tremendous work," Bowlsby said.
"Coach Harbaugh has led the pro
gram with integrity, vision, enthusi
asm and energy and his teams have
played with precision and excep
tional passion."
With star quarterback Andrew

Luck turning down the NFL Draft
to return for his senior year, Stan
ford was believed to have the inside
track on keeping its head coach, at
least for next season. San Francis
co's offer falls short of what Har
baugh was thought to be seeking
a contract paying him over $6.5 mil
lion annually, using the contract
signed last season by former USC
head coach Pete Carroll with the
Seattle Seahawks as a benchmark.
Bowlsby will begin his search for
a new head coach in earnest, as the
Cardinal would like to have a coach
in place as soon as possible to pre
vent losing recruits to rival pro
grams. The team will need to have a
head coach in place by Feb. 2, the
first day that recruits can officially
sign with programs.
Bowlsby's initial short list is be
lieved to include current Boise State
head coach Chris Petersen and for
mer Oregon head coach Mike Bel
lotti. He is also considering three in
ternal candidates: assistant head
coach Greg Roman, offensive coor
dinator David Shaw and defensive
coordinator Vic Fangio. Bowlsby
has met with all three internal candi
dates and Stanford has reached out
to Petersen, but it is unclear how
much contact the two sides have
had.
Harbaugh's departure has al
ready had an impact on the recruit
ing class linebacker James
Vaughters from Tucker High School
in Georgia, Stanford's top defensive
prospect, said earlier that he would
reopen his recruitment if Harbaugh
left Stanford. Vaughters verbally
committed to the Cardinal in June.
Stanford did pick up another com
mitment from a coveted recruit
after Harbaugh's departure
ESPN.com reported that safety
Wayne Lyons, from Dillard in Ft.
Lauderdale, Fla., plans to attend
Stanford in the fall.
