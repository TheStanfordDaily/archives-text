# PROF, DEFENDS MESSAGE UNDER SCRUTINY
## Ullman's e-mail offends Iranian-American group 
### BRENDAN O'BYRNE 
The National Iranian American Council
(NIAC) has called for a Stanford professor to be
disciplined for making what the organization calls
"racially discriminatory and inflammatory" re
marks about Iranians.
The council targeted computer science profes
sor emeritus Jeffery D. Ullman in a recent letter to
University President John Hennessy.
The Jan. 4 letter refers to an incident when, ac
cording to the organization, a graduate student
from Sharif University in Iran e-mailed Ullman
asking about admission into the graduate comput
er science program at Stanford. In an e-mail, Ull
man responded by directing the student to a page
on his University-hosted website, which explained
that the selection process for graduate school was
in the hands of a committee of graduate students
and faculty members, and that he could not and
would not influence them.
Ullman went on to say that even if he were in a
position to help, he would not do so until Iran rec
ognizes Israel's right to exist, adding that "if Irani
ans want the benefits of Stanford and other insti
tutions in the U.S., they have to respect the values
we hold in the U.S., including freedom of religion
and respect for human rights."
The NIAC letter claims these remarks unfairly
discriminate against Iranian students and says that
Ullman is "holding the aspirations of young Irani
ans hostage to the policies of their government."
The organization urged Hennessy to condemn the
remarks, take disciplinary action against Ullman,
and clarify Stanford's position on the issue of Iran
ian-American students.
But Stanford affirms that Ullman is not in
volved in admission and is free to express contro
versial opinions.
"This faculty member was expressing his own
personal views and not the views of the Universi
ty," said University spokeswoman Lisa Lapin. "He
has no involvement in admission, and Stanford
doesn't discriminate in their admission process."
She said there is no plan to discipline Ullman for
his statements, adding that Stanford has many
professors who hold controversial opinions.
Ullman expressed surprise at the University's
reaction to the event. Four days after receiving the
letter, no person from the president's office had
contacted Ullman regarding the incident, he said.
"I'd really appreciate more support from the
University on this," he said. "Not that they've said
anything negative, but I'm surprised they haven't
lined up and recognized this as an attempt to cen
sor a faculty member."
Ullman defended the wording of his e-mail,
saying, "If someone contacts me personally with a
request, I don't mind giving them some of my
opinion. When I say, 'I will not help you,' I don't
mean if you are admitted to Stanford I won't ad
vise you. It simply means I would not give them
special attention in preference to someone else."
Asked why he chose to elaborate on the stu
dent's country of origin in his e-mail, Ullman said
he was trying to teach this student a version of his
tory he may not have heard.
"There's a war going on in this world between
Iran and Israel and other countries," he said. "I
don't believe an Iranian student, however bright
they may be, is going to get a true picture of the
issue. I was just trying to show him the Israeli side
of the story."
