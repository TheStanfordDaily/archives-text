## Hennessy to gain from Atheros sale Qualcomm deal highlights president's role in Silicon Valley 
### DEVIN BANERJEE SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
President John Hennessy further expanded his
reputation and his wallet last week when Qual
comm, the world's largest maker of mobile-phone
chips, agreed to buy Atheros Communications,
which Hennessy co-founded, for $3.1 billion in cash.
In a statement, Qualcomm said Atheros investors
will receive $45 a share and the transaction will close
in the first half of 2011. Hennessy holds 32,899 shares
of Atheros, according to a company filing, position
ing him to earn $1.48 million from the acquisition.
The deal is the most recent manifestation of Hen
nessy's reach in Silicon Valley. In 1984 he co-founded
MIPS Computer Systems, a microprocessor devel
oper that went public in 1989, was acquired by Sili
con Graphics in 1992 and then spun off in 1998. After
helping found Atheros in 1998, he joined Cisco's
board of directors in 2002 and then Google's board
in 2004. The positions pay him well Forbes report
ed that Hennessy earned $331,000 from Cisco last
year, $497,156 from Google in 2009 and $86,000 from
Atheros in 2009.
Stanford paid him $702,771 last year, according to
a report by The Chronicle of Higher Education.
In an interview, Hennessy, who came to the presi
dency in 2000, said the multiple roles he plays in Sili
con Valley have given him valuable insight into pre
siding over Stanford.
The relationships he has built with leaders in the
valley, he said, provide him "a network of people to
call" when he faces a challenge or problem that one
of them has faced. His experience in starting compa
nies taught him "general management principles"
that, for example, guided him through the process of
laying off University employees during the height of
the recession in 2009.

University President John Hennessy, above, stands to gain from last week's
acquisition of Atheros Communications, which he co-founded, by Qualcomm.
Since 1984, Hennessy has had a close relationship with Silicon Valley.
"I'd had to go through a similar
situation with the first company I
started," said Hennessy, 57. "For
large organizations, change is a very
hard thing. So you can learn in a
smaller company how to deal with
that kind of change."
As a director at Cisco and
Google, Hennessy said he has
learned how to build and balance
large budgets Stanford's is near
ly $4 billion and how to recruit
talent to Stanford and retain its
roughly 11,000 employees.
"They are important back
ground experiences because as
president you face similar kinds of
challenges," he said.
Gerhard Casper, Stanford's
ninth president, isn't surprised his
successor is so closely affiliated with
multiple global corporations.
"The president of Stanford is, al
most by definition, an international
figure," Casper said in an interview
in his office on campus, where he
leads Stanford's arts initiative and
sometimes teaches.
As president, Casper took sever
al opportunities to address, in talks
around the world, the issue he calls
closest to his heart: higher educa
tion. Today Casper is a trustee of the
Central European University in
Budapest, an emeritus fellow of the
Yale Corporation and an emeritus
trustee of the American Academy
in Berlin. He is also an elected mem
ber of the American Law Institute
(he carries a copy of the U.S. Consti
tution with him at all times).
"When I stepped down [as presi

dent of Stanford], I was obviously
free to do things I could not do pre
viously simply because of time re
strictions or conflicts of interest,"
Casper said.
Though Casper has always been
"wary" of compensated board posi
tions he serves his roles in a pro
bono capacity, he said he called
Hennessy's affiliations different be
cause they don't impose time pres
sure on his duties as president. Hen
nessy said he has turned down "lots
of boards that would require travel"
because he couldn't afford the time.
On a board, a university presi
dent is no different from any other
director, says James Finkelstein, a
professor at the George Mason
School of Public Policy who, for 15
years, has studied the role of univer
sity presidents serving on corporate
boards. "We've never found a presi
dent to have attended less than 75
percent of the meetings of a corpo
rate board," Finkelstein said.
He has studied 132 top research
and academic universities and
found that 35 percent of the presi
dents serve on one or more boards
of publicly traded companies.
Though the insights Hennessy
has gained from Silicon Valley have
helped him manage and direct Stan
ford, he misses two things in which
he hopes to engage more after he
steps down: interacting with stu
dents and being involved in a small
start-up company.
"I'd like to be back on the facul
ty teaching," he said. "That's my first
goal."
As to whether he has given any
thought to when he will step down,
Hennessy replied, "Not yet."

President John Hennessy further expanded his
reputation and his wallet last week when Qual
comm, the world's largest maker of mobile-phone
chips, agreed to buy Atheros Communications,
which Hennessy co-founded, for $3.1 billion in cash.
In a statement, Qualcomm said Atheros investors
will receive $45 a share and the transaction will close
in the first half of 2011. Hennessy holds 32,899 shares
of Atheros, according to a company filing, position
ing him to earn $1.48 million from the acquisition.
The deal is the most recent manifestation of Hen
nessy's reach in Silicon Valley. In 1984 he co-founded
MIPS Computer Systems, a microprocessor devel
oper that went public in 1989, was acquired by Sili
con Graphics in 1992 and then spun off in 1998. After
helping found Atheros in 1998, he joined Cisco's
board of directors in 2002 and then Google's board
in 2004. The positions pay him well Forbes report
ed that Hennessy earned $331,000 from Cisco last
year, $497,156 from Google in 2009 and $86,000 from
Atheros in 2009.
Stanford paid him $702,771 last year, according to
a report by The Chronicle of Higher Education.
In an interview, Hennessy, who came to the presi
dency in 2000, said the multiple roles he plays in Sili
con Valley have given him valuable insight into pre
siding over Stanford.
The relationships he has built with leaders in the
valley, he said, provide him "a network of people to
call" when he faces a challenge or problem that one
of them has faced. His experience in starting compa
nies taught him "general management principles"
that, for example, guided him through the process of
laying off University employees during the height of
the recession in 2009.

University President John Hennessy, above, stands to gain from last week's
acquisition of Atheros Communications, which he co-founded, by Qualcomm.
Since 1984, Hennessy has had a close relationship with Silicon Valley.
"I'd had to go through a similar
situation with the first company I
started," said Hennessy, 57. "For
large organizations, change is a very
hard thing. So you can learn in a
smaller company how to deal with
that kind of change."
As a director at Cisco and
Google, Hennessy said he has
learned how to build and balance
large budgets Stanford's is near
ly $4 billion and how to recruit
talent to Stanford and retain its
roughly 11,000 employees.
"They are important back
ground experiences because as
president you face similar kinds of
challenges," he said.
Gerhard Casper, Stanford's
ninth president, isn't surprised his
successor is so closely affiliated with
multiple global corporations.
"The president of Stanford is, al
most by definition, an international
figure," Casper said in an interview
in his office on campus, where he
leads Stanford's arts initiative and
sometimes teaches.
As president, Casper took sever
al opportunities to address, in talks
around the world, the issue he calls
closest to his heart: higher educa
tion. Today Casper is a trustee of the
Central European University in
Budapest, an emeritus fellow of the
Yale Corporation and an emeritus
trustee of the American Academy
in Berlin. He is also an elected mem
ber of the American Law Institute
(he carries a copy of the U.S. Consti
tution with him at all times).
"When I stepped down [as presi

dent of Stanford], I was obviously
free to do things I could not do pre
viously simply because of time re
strictions or conflicts of interest,"
Casper said.
Though Casper has always been
"wary" of compensated board posi
tions he serves his roles in a pro
bono capacity, he said he called
Hennessy's affiliations different be
cause they don't impose time pres
sure on his duties as president. Hen
nessy said he has turned down "lots
of boards that would require travel"
because he couldn't afford the time.
On a board, a university presi
dent is no different from any other
director, says James Finkelstein, a
professor at the George Mason
School of Public Policy who, for 15
years, has studied the role of univer
sity presidents serving on corporate
boards. "We've never found a presi
dent to have attended less than 75
percent of the meetings of a corpo
rate board," Finkelstein said.
He has studied 132 top research
and academic universities and
found that 35 percent of the presi
dents serve on one or more boards
of publicly traded companies.
Though the insights Hennessy
has gained from Silicon Valley have
helped him manage and direct Stan
ford, he misses two things in which
he hopes to engage more after he
steps down: interacting with stu
dents and being involved in a small
start-up company.
"I'd like to be back on the facul
ty teaching," he said. "That's my first
goal."
As to whether he has given any
thought to when he will step down,
Hennessy replied, "Not yet."
