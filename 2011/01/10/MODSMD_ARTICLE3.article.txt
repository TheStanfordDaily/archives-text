## Hennessy to gain from Atheros sale Qualcomm deal highlights president's role in Silicon Valley 
### DEVIN BANERJEE SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
President John Hennessy further expanded his
reputation and his wallet last week when Qual
comm, the world's largest maker of mobile-phone
chips, agreed to buy Atheros Communications,
which Hennessy co-founded, for $3.1 billion in cash.
In a statement, Qualcomm said Atheros investors
will receive $45 a share and the transaction will close
in the first half of 2011. Hennessy holds 32,899 shares
of Atheros, according to a company filing, position
ing him to earn $1.48 million from the acquisition.
The deal is the most recent manifestation of Hen
nessy's reach in Silicon Valley. In 1984 he co-founded
MIPS Computer Systems, a microprocessor devel
oper that went public in 1989, was acquired by Sili
con Graphics in 1992 and then spun off in 1998. After
helping found Atheros in 1998, he joined Cisco's
board of directors in 2002 and then Google's board
in 2004. The positions pay him well Forbes report
ed that Hennessy earned $331,000 from Cisco last
year, $497,156 from Google in 2009 and $86,000 from
Atheros in 2009.
Stanford paid him $702,771 last year, according to
a report by The Chronicle of Higher Education.
In an interview, Hennessy, who came to the presi
dency in 2000, said the multiple roles he plays in Sili
con Valley have given him valuable insight into pre
siding over Stanford.
The relationships he has built with leaders in the
valley, he said, provide him "a network of people to
call" when he faces a challenge or problem that one
of them has faced. His experience in starting compa
nies taught him "general management principles"
that, for example, guided him through the process of
laying off University employees during the height of
the recession in 2009.
