## Entrepreneurs find support at summit White House summit targets Asian Americans in business 
### AMY JULIA HARRIS DESK EDITOR 
Mountain View hosted a meeting of tech
nological minds on Friday when about a thou
sand small business owners in Silicon Valley
convened for a White House summit on entre
preneurship and small business growth. The
White House Initiative on Asian Americans
and Pacific Islanders (AAPI) put on the five
and-a-half-hour event held on Microsoft's Sil
icon Valley campus. It was free of charge.
U.S. Commerce Secretary Gary Locke, co
chair of the White House Initiative on Asian
Americans and Pacific Islanders, kicked off the
summit with a keynote speech that underscored
the role of Asian Americans in the small busi
ness sector and the Obama administration's ef
forts to jumpstart entrepreneurship.
"There's a great legacy of Asian Ameri
can/Pacific Islander entrepreneurs, innova

tors and small business owners in America
all we want to do is smooth the way for that
long line of accomplishment to continue,"
Locke told the audience Friday morning.
"Despite continued hardship among
Asian/Pacific Islanders, the community over
all is thriving. Asian American/Pacific Is-

landers are now more likely to hire
and retain employment and spur
economic growth than other busi
ness owners."
The White House Initiative,
housed in the Department of Edu
cation, was spearheaded by the
Clinton administration to address
issues in health disparity, but has
since broadened its charter to in
crease Asian American and Pacific
Islander access to and participation
in federal programs where they are
underserved. The summit featured
talks by politicians and policy
wonks that shared tips for small
business financing, how best to uti
lize tax credits and loans and what
the emerging opportunities are in
the realm of big data in clean ener
gy and healthcare information
technology. Also included were
workshops on financing a start-up,

government contracting, exporting,
clean energy technology and
healthcare IT.
There are currently more than
two million Asian Americans and
Pacific Islanders involved in small
business and more than one million
AAPI-owned firms in the United
States. They represent 10 percent of
the United States' entrepreneurs
and cumulatively bring in over $3OO
billion dollars in sales.
"If you were to take out a
Blackberry, break it apart and see
how many Asian-Americans were
involved in producing it, youd be
amazed," said Rep. Mike Honda
(CA-15), a speaker at the after
noon portion of the event. "All of
us have contributed to all the tech
nology of this . . . The White
House Initiative recognizes that
the Asian American Diaspora is a
resource that that government
needs to tap into."
Silicon Valley, where Asian
Americans head about a third of
start-ups, was the first stop on the
White House Initiative's national

tour to discuss what the federal gov
ernment is doing across different
priority areas to promote opportu
nities for Asian Americans and Pa
cific Islanders.
For small business owners like
Van Leong, who owns an Internet
marketing firm out of his home in
Milpitas, the summit was a reassur
ing reminder that the government
was working to address the prob
lems, like loan contracts, that face
AAPI in the business sector.
'As an Asian American, I'm
glad to see that we're a focus in the
White House," said Leong, who
has a 20-year background in high
tech. "For me, what this really
showed was how different the eco
nomic situation now is from 10
years ago. There's a different envi
ronment for getting money today,
which the summit addressed, and
the small business mentality is dif
ferent. I think getting the word out
is positive."
