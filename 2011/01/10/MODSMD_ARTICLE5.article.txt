## Study finds legacy is big boon in admissions 
### AN LE NGUYEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Legacy applicants have better odds of admis
sion at elite colleges than previously estimated,
shows a recent study by Michael Hurwitz, a doctor
al candidate at the Harvard Graduate School of
Education.
In his analysis of 30 selective colleges, Hurwitz
controlled for a broad array of variables and found
that legacy applicants enjoyed a 23.3-point in
crease in their probability of admission.
Among legacy applicants, those who fell in the
"primary legacy" category enjoyed an even higher
45.1-point increase in their odds of acceptance. Pri
mary legacies are students with at least one parent

who attended the college or university as an under
graduate, as opposed to those with looser family
ties.
The statistical results of the study provide an ag
gregate picture of the sampled schools but obscure
variation among the institutions' stances toward
legacies.
Many universities Stanford included are
usually tight-lipped about their legacy admissions
statistics, though the University's Committee on
Undergraduate Admission and Financial Aid ac
knowledged this fall that Stanford may give prefer
ence to applicants whose parents graduated from
here.
According to a 2003 report titled "A New Ap
proach to Alumni Legacy Policies in Admissions,"

Thomas Loverro found that Stanford's legacy ad
mittance rate was around 14 to 15 percent of the
total applicant pool. Legacy admit rates were about
two to two and a half times the general admit rate
from 1984 to 2003, according to the report.
Dean of Undergraduate Admission Richard Shaw
emphasizes that legacy status does not guarantee
admission.
"The reality of this is that the majority of stu
dents that are legacies do not get in," Shaw said. But
legacies are very strong candidates, he said.
"In looking at our quantitative measures, our
legacy enrollees or admits tend to be stronger than
the median of the admitted class," Shaw said. "It
shatters another perception that un
qualified or less qualified students are
getting into Stanford because they are
sons or daughters of parents who
have come before them."
Hurwitz's findings stand apart
from previous studies that underesti
mated the legacy advantage. Hurwitz
utilized a quantitative method called
conditional logistical regression
analysis to eliminate certain biases in
his analysis. He used a data set of stu
dents who applied to multiple highly
selective institutions and controlled

for varying selectivity among the sam
ple of colleges and universities.
The outcomes show that the lega
cy admission advantage is consistent
across the student ability range and
across institutions of varying selectiv
ity. This advantage is magnified
through early-admission programs.
According to Shaw, Stanford clas
sifies students as legacies only if one
of their parents obtained a degree
here.
"Stanford has a proud and long
tradition of access and opportunity to
all sorts of populations from its found
ing," Shaw said. "One of the popula
tions that we certainly celebrate is the
sons and daughters of those who have
come before."
"Interestingly, as time goes on, as
the world becomes more diverse, the
next generations of parents who
might have children applying will be
much more diverse than heretofore,"
he continued. "And, in fact, the chil
dren of the first generation students
here now may very well look forward
to the opportunity to give their kids a
chance to apply and be competitive
for a position in the class."
Stanford legacies who were ac
cepted tend to say their parents' expe
riences reinforced their decision to
apply and enroll.
Jessica Kung 'l4 has ties to the
Farm that go back to her father, who
earned his bachelor's and master's
degrees at Stanford.
"My dad always talked about how
he enjoyed Stanford, and we visited a
few times," Kung said.
This legacy perspective is one rea
son why Stanford has always been her
first-choice university, she said: "It
was embedded in me so long ago."
Hurwitz's study did not focus on
the causes of the legacy admissions
advantage, but a frequently cited ex
planation argues that there is a link
between colleges' desire to increase
alumni donations and legacy admis
sions. In 2009, Stanford raised $640
million more than any other col
lege or university.
"I don't know whether the legacy
admissions advantage is related to
charitable giving," Hurwitz said in an
e-mail to The Daily. "This seems like a
plausible hypothesis, and the conclu
sion of any study that endeavors to in
vestigate this research question
would probably be sensitive to the
colleges included."
