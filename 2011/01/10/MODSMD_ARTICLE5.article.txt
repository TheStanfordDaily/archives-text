## Study finds legacy is big boon in admissions 
### AN LE NGUYEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Legacy applicants have better odds of admis
sion at elite colleges than previously estimated,
shows a recent study by Michael Hurwitz, a doctor
al candidate at the Harvard Graduate School of
Education.
In his analysis of 30 selective colleges, Hurwitz
controlled for a broad array of variables and found
that legacy applicants enjoyed a 23.3-point in
crease in their probability of admission.
Among legacy applicants, those who fell in the
"primary legacy" category enjoyed an even higher
45.1-point increase in their odds of acceptance. Pri
mary legacies are students with at least one parent

who attended the college or university as an under
graduate, as opposed to those with looser family
ties.
The statistical results of the study provide an ag
gregate picture of the sampled schools but obscure
variation among the institutions' stances toward
legacies.
Many universities Stanford included are
usually tight-lipped about their legacy admissions
statistics, though the University's Committee on
Undergraduate Admission and Financial Aid ac
knowledged this fall that Stanford may give prefer
ence to applicants whose parents graduated from
here.
According to a 2003 report titled "A New Ap
proach to Alumni Legacy Policies in Admissions,"

Thomas Loverro found that Stanford's legacy ad
mittance rate was around 14 to 15 percent of the
total applicant pool. Legacy admit rates were about
two to two and a half times the general admit rate
from 1984 to 2003, according to the report.
Dean of Undergraduate Admission Richard Shaw
emphasizes that legacy status does not guarantee
admission.
"The reality of this is that the majority of stu
dents that are legacies do not get in," Shaw said. But
legacies are very strong candidates, he said.
"In looking at our quantitative measures, our
legacy enrollees or admits tend to be stronger than
the median of the admitted class," Shaw said. "It
