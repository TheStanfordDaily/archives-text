### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€” Amy Julia Harris 
Burglars this weekend allegedly
stole laptops and iPods from Bob, the
Mayfield Avenue residence, while in
an unrelated incident three unidenti
fied men allegedly entered a room in
Grove Mayfield while its resident was
sleeping.
On Friday night between 10 p.m.
and midnight, unidentified people
entered Bob and stole four laptops,
two or three iPods, a camera and cash
from two or three rooms, said Bob
Resident Assistant (RA) Sam Svobo
da' 11, who is a Daily writer. Fie added
that the extent of the theft is still ten
tative because the residents returned
only this afternoon from their ski trip.
Svoboda said that Bob had about
10 people in the house over the week
end. No one in the residence saw the
burglars, he added, but he guessed
that the thieves entered and exited
from Bob's side doors.
On Saturday at 12:45 a.m., three
unidentified men allegedly entered
Grove Mayfield, proceeded to the
second floor and checked doors to
see if they were occupied. They en
tered a female student's room on the
second floor and fled in an unknown
direction when she screamed. No
thefts were reported.
Stanford police alerted the com
munity to the incident via text mes
sage and e-mail, terming it a "hot
prowl," which is a burglary attempt in
which the offender breaks into a resi
dence while someone is inside. Flot
prowl burglaries are considered dan
gerous by law enforcement because
of the potential for a violent interac
tion between the resident and the of-
fender.
Ivan Herrera 'll, a second-floor
resident of Grove, was in his room on
Friday night and heard someone rat
tling the handle of his door. He im
mediately thought it was burglars
and asked who it was. A few minutes
later, he heard his next-door neigh
bor scream and he called 911. Three
police came to Grove Mayfield and
dusted for fingerprints.
Grove RA Bob Clark 'll was on
the house's ski trip during the inci
dent and guessed that the unidenti
fied men who entered Grove were
the same offenders that stole laptops
from Bob.
Clark said that he has been ex
changing e-mails with the Row's res
idence dean to set up a security meet
ing and has been working with Hous
ing to address unsafe entries in
Grove.
