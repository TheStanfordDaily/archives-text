## THE
						TRANSITIVE PROPERTY Strength in Numbers 
### Cristopher Bautista 
Yesterday I was part of an FTM
(female-to-male) panel spon
sored by the Lou Sullivan So
ciety, an FTM organization in San
Francisco. The Lou Sullivan Society
was a support group for transmen in
the area I had heard about the so
ciety, but I had never been to any of
the meetings. I had written a piece on
being transgender that was included
in an anthology, "Letters to My
Brothers," and I had been asked to
read my piece from that anthology. I
actually left my ski trip early so I
could attend I left from Tahoe
around seven in the morning, got
back at 11, took a quick shower, and
scrambled onto the 11:31 Caltrain.
One and a half hours later I found
myself in the Castro.
I was nervous as hell. I had trans
male friends back at Stanford, but
they were my age, and we were all
more or less in the same stage of
transition. Not to mention there
were only about three of them, and if
I were to count the entire open trans
gender community (transmen,
transwomen, and those in between),
they could easily fit in my room for
tea. Flere, there were going to be for
certain more than three transmen.
And this possibility blew my mind.
But even so, the transmale com
munity is pretty small. It could be be
cause of a number of reasons, like the
possibility that many transmen pre
fer to live in stealth and don't feel the
need to congregate with other trans
guys or it might be simply because
there aren't really a lot of us. There
are at most two degrees of separation
between one transguy and another. If
you're a transguy and you meet an
other transguy, chances are he knows
somebody you know. It's so bizarre.
We all know each other. It's like
being part of some cool, fun-sized
club.
When I arrived, I immediately felt

at ease. No, I didn't know any of these
people, but I felt that I could just be
myself that I didn't have to worry
about impressing anyone. We could
just be ourselves. There were men
here in different stages of transition. I
was, in terms of age, the youngest
there. But there were numerous
transmen covering a whole range of
ages and transition stages there
were several transmen who had
mothered children, some who had
not started hormones yet, some who
had been on hormones for at least 20
years, some from around the Bay, oth
ers from the East Coast, and even
some from other countries.There was
a man with a rather menacing mo
hawk and an even more menacing
pierced face crocheting a baby blue
scarf in the corner of the room.
But despite our different experi
ences, there is a mutual understand
ing among us, a mutual respect for
each other's unique sense of mas
culinity. We don't take our manhood
for granted. That is what makes us
different from other men. And be
sides, it's not every day that you see
more than 15 transmen in a room. It
felt pretty cool actually being the
majority for once. That pretty much
made my week.
As if the world were not awe
some enough, Jamison Green was
also a fellow panelist. He's one of my
heroes he wrote one of my fa
vorite books, "Becoming A Visible
Man," which I used to help get me
