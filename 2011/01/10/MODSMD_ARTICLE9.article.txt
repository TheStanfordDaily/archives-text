# CARDINAL SINS
## Wikignorant 
### David Spencer Nelson 
Wikileaks is, frankly, a rela
tively dumb website. Their
mission, to do away with
confidentiality in all its forms, is to
tally impractical and entirely fool
ish. Moreover, the leaked cables
have unveiled nothing significant
unless you're trying to protect
Colonel Gaddafi's vanity. The Unit
ed States, in fact, has emerged look
ing like an intelligent and reason
able power struggling with idiocy in
the form of Vlad, Silvio and Hamed.
Unless your main goal is disman
tling the reputation of these already
disreputable politicians, Wikileaks is
little more than a nuisance. Though
it did publish certain materials of in
terest a year or two ago, its most re
cent revelations have been widely
publicized and only marginally con
sequential. The cables have not
made the U.S. look like the evil em
pire that Julian Assange often al
leges it to be.
Julian Assange, and his source,
Bradley Manning, are not to be ven
erated, and much less so protected
by hyperactive Internet freedom
groups. For the U.S. and similar
countries to operate, nobly and ig
nobly, some information has to be
withheld. Frank military and diplo
matic assessments can't always be
made public, due to the sensitivities
of allies and the pragmatic necessi
ties of a harsh world. This confiden
tiality can facilitate poor behavior,
but nonetheless is necessary for an
organization to function. Even Wik
ileaks itself is a closed and mysteri
ous operation, whose financials and
other documents have been leaked
(the granddaddy of all ironies). As
sange's efforts haven't been clarify
ing or useful in the slightest. Their
central effect has been to distract
government and give cause for small
diplomatic spats. They're a poor
man's investigative journalism.
Wikileaks does, if nothing else,
confirm the power and justify the es
tablished position of print journal
ism. Wikileaks has done good work,
publishing some videos and reports
that pointed out human rights abus
es and governmental misconduct,
but the website's absurd dedication
to total transparency causes prob
lems. Journalism is about choosing
what is important. It's about decid
ing what is relevant and what's not,
and knowing what needs to be said
and what is meaningless clutter.
A disgruntled, querulous man,
Assange has made only sparing
redactions, and even then, as
demonstrated by yesterday's front
page article in The Times, has endan
gered good people. His actions are
more those of a petulant child than a

progressive intellectual. Though
many are instinctually compelled to
side with the iconoclastic defender
of freedoms, revealer of abuses,
upon further reflection, it's pretty
obvious that he's more of an emo
tionally damaged pariah acting out
than a principled man.
Even though Assange's effect on
the political arena has been limited,
he does pose one major risk to a
large segment of the world's popula
tion, and an active community at
Stanford: the Web-lover. Internet
groups, such as Anonymous, have
been executing server attacks on
various websites that have denied
Wikileaks services. Some have been
attacked in retaliation, but the real
pushback has yet to come.The strug
gle to maintain Internet freedoms
has been a long one, and stupidity
like Anonymous', attacking Master-
Card and Visa after they stopped
processing Wikileaks donations,
makes it an uphill battle. These are,
again, childish actions that amount
to nothing but an inconvenience to
the world's major firms, rather like a
child throwing broccoli at its moth
er. Their central effect has been to
attract the ire of the world's govern
ments and reduce popular support,
not strengthen their cause.
In this day and age, where the
electorate is increasingly easy to ma
nipulate by the press and more im
pulsive than ever, where govern
ments don't shy away from extend
ing their reach to every realm of life,
actions like Anonymous' do incred
ible harm and attract the rage of the
public.There's little left in this world
that's not subject to the control of
higher powers, and the Internet,
with its free flow of information,
data and interpersonal and interna
tional connections, is the last fron
tier. It is the most profoundly open
market of ideas in the history of the
world, yet, when it is abused and
used to cause dysfunction, it loses its
power and becomes a disruptive
force.
If the Internet becomes more of
an accessory to espionage and an in
strument of infantile acts of sabo
tage than a means of spreading
knowledge, there's no doubt in my
mind that the governments of Eu
rope, interventionist as they are, and
