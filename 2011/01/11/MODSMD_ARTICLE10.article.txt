# LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
## Campus safety should be a priority 
### 
Dear Editor,
In light of a recent assault and a
"hot prowl," I would like to express
my sincere concern about current
campus safety. As a sophomore fe
male, I have not (until recently) felt
threatened to leave my dorm room
at night or to walk alone. Keeping
my room unlocked at night never
struck me as unsafe and I never
dreamt that anyone would crawl
into my window. I find it very unset
tling that two troubling incidents
have occurred within the span of a
week without much outcry from the
campus. I admit that I am very satis
fied with Stanford's Emergency
Alert System, which immediately
informs us of assaults. However, a
new system of crime prevention
should be enacted to ensure that
these crimes are severely hindered
and punishable,
I am not the type to give up liber
ties to ensure safety, but I would feel
more comfortable if there were
more security measures and cam
pus-wide education about how to
report suspicious activity. Last year,
I had my first confrontation with a
potential assault crime. While
studying in Meyer Library I heard a
scream from the girl's bathroom.
Still to my chagrin today, no one but
one other guy and I ran to the aid of
the girl. When we arrived, a larger
man emerged next to a crying girl as
she tried to explain that he was
looking into her stall and had
pushed his way past her. To my

knowledge, no other assault oc
curred.
The man in the bathroom pro
ceeded to knock down the guy next
to me and I immediately called 911,
following the man as he fled. I do
not think he was ever caught, which
is unsettling, considering the other
witnesses and I had offered a fairly
accurate description of him. I was
surprised at the lack of reaction
from the students in the library,
imagining what would have hap
pened if no one at all had checked
out the source of the screams. I am
not saying the onus lies upon men,
but I was a bit more disappointed
that so many guys in the library had
cowered from even coming to the
hallway where the bathroom is.
Perhaps I am only tangentially
touching upon a much more com
plex issue of crime in general. I am
not the police and I have little ex
pertise in how to prevent assaults (if
at all), but I do feel like more needs
to be done, whether it is creating
better-lit areas (especially between
buildings), disseminating informa
tive pamphlets, advertising 5-
SURE transportation or even com
ing to the aid of a screaming girl.
(Nothing is more terrifying than
screaming and no one reacting.) I
hope Stanford will explore safer
measures to ensure that assault pre
vention is a top priority on campus.
I will not let a few incidents change
my actions drastically, but they have
made me more aware that there is a
problem that needs to be re-ad
dressed.
