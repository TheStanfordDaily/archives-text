Welcome to Life After Har
baugh. First task: finding his re
placement. It is surely a moment
that athletic director Bob Bowls
by has been preparing for, even
as Stanford came tantalizingly
close to retaining Captain
Comeback indeed, by some
accounts, Bowlsby has been talk
ing with potential candidates for
over a week now. Let's examine
the current and upcoming
process and some names that
have been floated thus far.

New coach's responsibilities

1) Retain the recruiting class
Whenever a coach leaves a
program particularly a coach
with as strong a personality as
Harbaugh there is bound to
be attrition from the current re
cruiting class. Stanford, with 22
commits for the Class of 2011, is
ranked No. 6 nationally by
Scout.com.
With National Signing Day
coming up on Feb. 2, the new
coach must be on the phone and
on the road to ensure that as few
players as possible switch to
other schools. He must pay spe
cific attention to players being
actively recruited by Notre
Dame and USC, the two pro
grams Stanford has begun to
compete with most for players
tremendously skilled ath
letes, such as local product and
tenuous Cardinal commit Amir
Carlisle, hang in the balance.

2) Retain Vic Fangio

Simple numbers can be so il
luminating: under Fangio, Stan
ford's scoring defense jumped
from No. 69 nationally to No. 11
in a single year. As important as
Andrew Luck and the Cardinal
offense was to the team's suc
cess, it was the defense's massive
jump that catapulted Stanford
into the nation's elite.
This is not to devalue other
coaches Lance Anderson has
been a remarkable recruiting co
ordinator, Brian Polian is one of
the nation's best recruiters, and
there are few, if any holes
amongst the rest of the staff. That
being said, keeping Fangio on
board is paramount, and won't
necessarily be easy. Flarbaugh

could take him to San Francisco,
which runs a 3-4, or he could wind
up with another collegiate job —
he's been linked to both the Texas
(no longer vacant) and UCLA
defensive coordinator gigs.
Fangio is also in serious dis
cussions with the Dallas Cow
boys about filling their vacant
defensive coordinator position
on head coach Jason Garrett's
staff. Prior to joining Harbaugh
at Stanford, Fangio spent a num
ber of years in the NFL, includ
ing as defensive coordinator for
three different teams.
Stanford's considerations
If it ain't broke, don't fix it.
This extends both to the pro
gram and individual players.
While Harbaugh was a unique
personality whose success will
not be easily replicated, there
are basic tenets that can and
should remain.
First: a pro-style offense that
places a heavy emphasis on of
fensive line play and use of its
tight ends.
Second: a hands-off approach
with Andrew Luck. Harbaugh, a
quarterback himself, was notori
ously reluctant to try and change
Luck too much, for fear of com
plicating his already stellar me
chanics and fundamentals. Luck
is a finished product; he doesn't
need much modification.
Third: an emphasis on work
ethic and meritocracy. One of
Harbaugh's great triumphs was
having a group of Stanford stu
dents envision themselves as
blue-collar workers; the tactic
had dramatic success.
Beyond style, there are cer
tain factors to consider when
choosing a coach. Luck's return,
as well as the general status of
the program, might prompt
Stanford to try and create some
continuity between regimes —
this would lead the program to
favor an in-house candidate.
However, in the past, when an
assistant is elevated to head
coach, there is usually more at
trition among the staff, as others
become reluctant to work un
derneath someone they once
considered their equal.
Stanford is in a place where it
could likely land a big name, but
Bowlsby has shown a knack for
finding diamonds in the rough in
the past. Kirk Ferentz was a po
sition coach with the Baltimore
Ravens before taking the reins
at Iowa; Harbaugh was the head
coach for an FCS program. In
other words: just because you
can land a big name, does it
