## FILLING THE VACANCY Who will replace Jim Harbaugh? 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY MANAGING EDITOR 
Editor's note: this story first ap

Welcome to Life After Har
baugh. First task: finding his re
placement. It is surely a moment
that athletic director Bob Bowls
by has been preparing for, even
as Stanford came tantalizingly
close to retaining Captain
Comeback indeed, by some
accounts, Bowlsby has been talk
ing with potential candidates for
over a week now. Let's examine
the current and upcoming
process and some names that
have been floated thus far.

New coach's responsibilities

1) Retain the recruiting class
Whenever a coach leaves a
program particularly a coach
with as strong a personality as
Harbaugh there is bound to
be attrition from the current re
cruiting class. Stanford, with 22
commits for the Class of 2011, is
ranked No. 6 nationally by
Scout.com.
With National Signing Day
coming up on Feb. 2, the new
coach must be on the phone and
on the road to ensure that as few
players as possible switch to
other schools. He must pay spe
cific attention to players being
actively recruited by Notre
Dame and USC, the two pro
grams Stanford has begun to
compete with most for players
tremendously skilled ath
letes, such as local product and
tenuous Cardinal commit Amir
Carlisle, hang in the balance.

2) Retain Vic Fangio

Simple numbers can be so il
luminating: under Fangio, Stan
ford's scoring defense jumped
from No. 69 nationally to No. 11
in a single year. As important as
Andrew Luck and the Cardinal
offense was to the team's suc
cess, it was the defense's massive
jump that catapulted Stanford
into the nation's elite.
This is not to devalue other
coaches Lance Anderson has
been a remarkable recruiting co
ordinator, Brian Polian is one of
the nation's best recruiters, and
there are few, if any holes
amongst the rest of the staff. That
being said, keeping Fangio on
board is paramount, and won't
necessarily be easy. Flarbaugh

could take him to San Francisco,
which runs a 3-4, or he could wind
up with another collegiate job —
he's been linked to both the Texas
(no longer vacant) and UCLA
defensive coordinator gigs.
Fangio is also in serious dis
cussions with the Dallas Cow
boys about filling their vacant
defensive coordinator position
on head coach Jason Garrett's
staff. Prior to joining Harbaugh
at Stanford, Fangio spent a num
ber of years in the NFL, includ
ing as defensive coordinator for
three different teams.
Stanford's considerations
If it ain't broke, don't fix it.
This extends both to the pro
gram and individual players.
While Harbaugh was a unique
personality whose success will
not be easily replicated, there
are basic tenets that can and
should remain.
First: a pro-style offense that
places a heavy emphasis on of
fensive line play and use of its
tight ends.
Second: a hands-off approach
with Andrew Luck. Harbaugh, a
quarterback himself, was notori
ously reluctant to try and change
Luck too much, for fear of com
plicating his already stellar me
chanics and fundamentals. Luck
is a finished product; he doesn't
need much modification.
Third: an emphasis on work
ethic and meritocracy. One of
Harbaugh's great triumphs was
having a group of Stanford stu
dents envision themselves as
blue-collar workers; the tactic
had dramatic success.
Beyond style, there are cer
tain factors to consider when
choosing a coach. Luck's return,
as well as the general status of
the program, might prompt
Stanford to try and create some
continuity between regimes —
this would lead the program to
favor an in-house candidate.
However, in the past, when an
assistant is elevated to head
coach, there is usually more at
trition among the staff, as others
become reluctant to work un
derneath someone they once
considered their equal.
Stanford is in a place where it
could likely land a big name, but
Bowlsby has shown a knack for
finding diamonds in the rough in
the past. Kirk Ferentz was a po
sition coach with the Baltimore
Ravens before taking the reins
at Iowa; Harbaugh was the head
coach for an FCS program. In
other words: just because you
can land a big name, does it

mean you should ? Conundrums for
the Cardinal to consider.
Coaching candidates
Chris Petersen, head coach, Boise
State
Editor's note: Petersen announced
yesterday that he will remain at Boise
State.
This would be the "whale" of the
group: a highly accomplished coach
who could move from a national
powerhouse to one of 2010's top
programs. Petersen, who has been at
Boise State since 2001 and has been
head coach since 2005, has had his
name mentioned for a myriad of
openings over the years, but has de
murred each time. Stanford presents
an intriguing option for him.
Petersen went to UC-Davis and
is from just north of Sacramento.
He's Western through and through
— outside of one year at Pitts
burgh, he has spent his entire career
working and living no farther east
than Idaho. He also shies away
from the spotlight, and while Stan
ford is a Pac-12 job, it does not
come with the glare of other major
programs. Petersen is an offensive
mind who runs a pro-style attack
similar to Stanford's, and while he
returns Kellen Moore to Boise, he
just lost his offensive coordinator to
Texas.
Mike Bellotti, former head coach,
Oregon
Bellotti would be the other big
name in the search. A Ducks legend
— he was at the university in some
capacity for two decades — Bellotti,
at 60 years old, would not be as
youthful as candidates Bowlsby has
traditionally pursued, but he would
bring a vast array of experience,
knowledge and success.
Though Bellotti has retired and
is now an analyst for ESPN, he has
not ruled out a return to coaching.
While it would, on the surface, seem
unlikely that he would coach in the
same conference as Oregon, Phil
Knight, the John Arrillaga of Eu
gene, has significant Stanford ties —
the new business school will carry
his name. Bellotti has already been
linked to the opening and has com
mented on his status publicly, telling
The Oregonian that both sides
would have to determine if it was a
"good fit."

David Shaw, offensive coordinator,
Stanford
Shaw is seen as one of the two in
house candidates to replace Har
baugh. A Stanford football alum and
favorite son, Shaw is beloved by
alumni. Since starting with Har
baugh in 2007, he has been one of
the major architects of the Cardi
nal's impressive offense throughout
his tenure, although his responsibili
ties have been slightly usurped in re
cent years. He's also favorite of the
current Cardinal athletes — Doug
Baldwin told the San Jose Mercury
News that "all the players want
David Shaw as the head coach."
Greg Roman, associate head coach,
Stanford
Roman quickly became Har
baugh's right hand man after com
ing to the Farm in 2009 — he was the
designated head coach if Harbaugh
was to become incapacitated in any
way. Roman was one of three final
ists for the Vanderbilt job, and he in
terviewed for the Pittsburgh open
ing. He has quietly cut into Shaw's
role as offensive coordinator, to the
point where he, Shaw and Harbaugh
were responsible for the offense to
varying degrees. His historic focus is
in an area where the Cardinal has
been the most successful: offensive
line and tight ends. Like Shaw, he'd
present continuity from the Har
baugh era.
Todd Graham, Head Coach, Tulsa
Editor's note: since Friday, Gra
ham has accepted the head coaching
position at the University of Pitts
burgh.
Graham is the lone defensive
coach of the bunch, and has had his
name tied to the Stanford opening
for a couple of weeks. Seen as an up
and-comer in the ranks — he is cur
rently interviewing at Pittsburgh,
too — Graham has finished first (or
in a tie for first) in three of his four
years with the Golden Hurricane,
and would provide stellar defensive
credentials should Fangio decide to
leave.
It is also entirely possible that
Bowlsby breaks conventions and
finds another unknown to take over
the program; or, he could go with a
retread. Either way, Bowlsby's
record speaks for itself, and the
wheels have been set in motion
since before Harbaugh inked his
deal with San Francisco. But no
matter whom he chooses, this much
is clear: he'll have his work cut out
for him.

Coaching candidates
Chris Petersen, head coach, Boise
State
Editor's note: Petersen announced
yesterday that he will remain at Boise
State.
This would be the "whale" of the
group: a highly accomplished coach
who could move from a national
powerhouse to one of 2010's top
programs. Petersen, who has been at
Boise State since 2001 and has been
head coach since 2005, has had his
name mentioned for a myriad of
openings over the years, but has de
murred each time. Stanford presents
an intriguing option for him.
Petersen went to UC-Davis and
is from just north of Sacramento.
He's Western through and through
— outside of one year at Pitts
burgh, he has spent his entire career
working and living no farther east
than Idaho. He also shies away
from the spotlight, and while Stan
ford is a Pac-12 job, it does not
come with the glare of other major
programs. Petersen is an offensive
mind who runs a pro-style attack
similar to Stanford's, and while he
returns Kellen Moore to Boise, he
just lost his offensive coordinator to
Texas.
Mike Bellotti, former head coach,
Oregon
Bellotti would be the other big
name in the search. A Ducks legend
— he was at the university in some
capacity for two decades — Bellotti,
at 60 years old, would not be as
youthful as candidates Bowlsby has
traditionally pursued, but he would
bring a vast array of experience,
knowledge and success.
Though Bellotti has retired and
is now an analyst for ESPN, he has
not ruled out a return to coaching.
While it would, on the surface, seem
unlikely that he would coach in the
same conference as Oregon, Phil
Knight, the John Arrillaga of Eu
gene, has significant Stanford ties —
the new business school will carry
his name. Bellotti has already been
linked to the opening and has com
mented on his status publicly, telling
The Oregonian that both sides
would have to determine if it was a
"good fit."

David Shaw, offensive coordinator,
Stanford
Shaw is seen as one of the two in
house candidates to replace Har
baugh. A Stanford football alum and
favorite son, Shaw is beloved by
alumni. Since starting with Har
baugh in 2007, he has been one of
the major architects of the Cardi
nal's impressive offense throughout
his tenure, although his responsibili
ties have been slightly usurped in re
cent years. He's also favorite of the
current Cardinal athletes — Doug
Baldwin told the San Jose Mercury
News that "all the players want
David Shaw as the head coach."
Greg Roman, associate head coach,
Stanford
Roman quickly became Har
baugh's right hand man after com
ing to the Farm in 2009 — he was the
designated head coach if Harbaugh
was to become incapacitated in any
way. Roman was one of three final
ists for the Vanderbilt job, and he in
terviewed for the Pittsburgh open
ing. He has quietly cut into Shaw's
role as offensive coordinator, to the
point where he, Shaw and Harbaugh
were responsible for the offense to
varying degrees. His historic focus is
in an area where the Cardinal has
been the most successful: offensive
line and tight ends. Like Shaw, he'd
present continuity from the Har
baugh era.
Todd Graham, Head Coach, Tulsa
Editor's note: since Friday, Gra
ham has accepted the head coaching
position at the University of Pitts
burgh.
Graham is the lone defensive
coach of the bunch, and has had his
name tied to the Stanford opening
for a couple of weeks. Seen as an up
and-comer in the ranks — he is cur
rently interviewing at Pittsburgh,
too — Graham has finished first (or
in a tie for first) in three of his four
years with the Golden Hurricane,
and would provide stellar defensive
credentials should Fangio decide to
leave.
It is also entirely possible that
Bowlsby breaks conventions and
finds another unknown to take over
the program; or, he could go with a
retread. Either way, Bowlsby's
record speaks for itself, and the
wheels have been set in motion
since before Harbaugh inked his
deal with San Francisco. But no
matter whom he chooses, this much
is clear: he'll have his work cut out
for him.

Welcome to Life After Har
baugh. First task: finding his re
placement. It is surely a moment
that athletic director Bob Bowls
by has been preparing for, even
as Stanford came tantalizingly
close to retaining Captain
Comeback indeed, by some
accounts, Bowlsby has been talk
ing with potential candidates for
over a week now. Let's examine
the current and upcoming
process and some names that
have been floated thus far.

New coach's responsibilities

1) Retain the recruiting class
Whenever a coach leaves a
program particularly a coach
with as strong a personality as
Harbaugh there is bound to
be attrition from the current re
cruiting class. Stanford, with 22
commits for the Class of 2011, is
ranked No. 6 nationally by
Scout.com.
With National Signing Day
coming up on Feb. 2, the new
coach must be on the phone and
on the road to ensure that as few
players as possible switch to
other schools. He must pay spe
cific attention to players being
actively recruited by Notre
Dame and USC, the two pro
grams Stanford has begun to
compete with most for players
tremendously skilled ath
letes, such as local product and
tenuous Cardinal commit Amir
Carlisle, hang in the balance.

2) Retain Vic Fangio

Simple numbers can be so il
luminating: under Fangio, Stan
ford's scoring defense jumped
from No. 69 nationally to No. 11
in a single year. As important as
Andrew Luck and the Cardinal
offense was to the team's suc
cess, it was the defense's massive
jump that catapulted Stanford
into the nation's elite.
This is not to devalue other
coaches Lance Anderson has
been a remarkable recruiting co
ordinator, Brian Polian is one of
the nation's best recruiters, and
there are few, if any holes
amongst the rest of the staff. That
being said, keeping Fangio on
board is paramount, and won't
necessarily be easy. Flarbaugh

could take him to San Francisco,
which runs a 3-4, or he could wind
up with another collegiate job —
he's been linked to both the Texas
(no longer vacant) and UCLA
defensive coordinator gigs.
Fangio is also in serious dis
cussions with the Dallas Cow
boys about filling their vacant
defensive coordinator position
on head coach Jason Garrett's
staff. Prior to joining Harbaugh
at Stanford, Fangio spent a num
ber of years in the NFL, includ
ing as defensive coordinator for
three different teams.
Stanford's considerations
If it ain't broke, don't fix it.
This extends both to the pro
gram and individual players.
While Harbaugh was a unique
personality whose success will
not be easily replicated, there
are basic tenets that can and
should remain.
First: a pro-style offense that
places a heavy emphasis on of
fensive line play and use of its
tight ends.
Second: a hands-off approach
with Andrew Luck. Harbaugh, a
quarterback himself, was notori
ously reluctant to try and change
Luck too much, for fear of com
plicating his already stellar me
chanics and fundamentals. Luck
is a finished product; he doesn't
need much modification.
Third: an emphasis on work
ethic and meritocracy. One of
Harbaugh's great triumphs was
having a group of Stanford stu
dents envision themselves as
blue-collar workers; the tactic
had dramatic success.
Beyond style, there are cer
tain factors to consider when
choosing a coach. Luck's return,
as well as the general status of
the program, might prompt
Stanford to try and create some
continuity between regimes —
this would lead the program to
favor an in-house candidate.
However, in the past, when an
assistant is elevated to head
coach, there is usually more at
trition among the staff, as others
become reluctant to work un
derneath someone they once
considered their equal.
Stanford is in a place where it
could likely land a big name, but
Bowlsby has shown a knack for
finding diamonds in the rough in
the past. Kirk Ferentz was a po
sition coach with the Baltimore
Ravens before taking the reins
at Iowa; Harbaugh was the head
coach for an FCS program. In
other words: just because you
can land a big name, does it
