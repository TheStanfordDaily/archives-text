# Marecic wins Paul Hornung Award
## 
### 
Yesterday, Stanford senior
football player Owen Marecic
won the inaugural Paul Hornung
Award, given to the nation's most
versatile college football player.
This season, Marecic saw signif
icant playing time on both sides of
the ball for the Cardinal, playing in
all 13 of the team's games as the
only two-way starter in major col
lege football. On offense, Marecic
bulldozed through blockers as the
team's starting fullback, and he an
chored the defense as one of its two
starting middle linebackers. Of the
13 games in which Marecic played,
he started nine on both offense and
defense. Marecic logged an aver
age of 110 plays per game, far
above the normal workload of a
Division I football player.
Marecic scored five offensive
touchdowns for Stanford, all in short
yardage situations. On defense, he
was fifth on the team with 51 tackles
and had two interceptions over the
course of the season.
His signature moment came in
Stanford's game against Notre Dame
on Sept. 25, when he scored on con
secutive plays from scrimmage. Mare
cic scored on a short touchdown run,
and after the ensuing kickoff, he
picked off a pass on the Fighting
Irish's first play of the drive and ran it
back for a touchdown.
In Stanford's victory in the Orange
Bowl over Virginia Tech on Jan. 3,
Marecic had six tackles and one sack.
He also added a one-yard touchdown
run in the third quarter.
The other finalists for the Hor
nung Award were Randall Cobb of
Kentucky and Jeremy Kerley of TCU.
The award is named for Paul Hor
nung, who won the Heisman Trophy
in 1956 with Notre Dame. Hornung
played quarterback, running back, de
fensive back, kicker and punter dur
ing his time with the Irish, and played
halfback and kicker in the NFL.
