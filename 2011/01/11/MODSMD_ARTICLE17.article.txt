# Basketball grows up quickly
## 
### Zach Zimmerman Dishing the Rock 
The Pac-10 men's basketball
season began exactly as we
expected unexpectedly.
Projected bottom-feeders
have thumped perennial
powerhouses, only one conference
team (No. 18 Washington) is national
ly ranked, and 9-5 Stanford, a team lit
tered with underclassmen, sits in third
place.
Sunday's loss to Arizona came
under unique circumstances for the
Cardinal, but the inconsistent play
throughout the game paints an accu
rate picture of the season that has
been. Stanford, down 15 after looking
like an above-average AAU team,
managed to keep the game within
striking distance with stingy perime
ter defense and streaky displays of
athleticism. Although the Cardinal
lost by 10, Johnny Dawkins has to be
optimistic with the way his team
played.
That said, there is obvious cause
for concern. Dawkins regularly plays
four freshmen, including two starters,
in his nightly rotation. When the new
guys are meshing and playing with the
passion displayed during portions of
Sunday's second half, Stanford is a
tough team to compete with. But the
problem with freshmen, as has been
made unfortunately clear, is that when
the going gets tough on the road,
chaos ensues.

The Cardinal is a perfect 8-0 at
home, with all five losses coming
away from Maples Pavilion. In front
of supporting fans, Stanford has
soundly beaten the likes of Virginia
and Cal while eclipsing the 80-point
mark three times. The Card, espe
cially the freshmen, looks exponen
tially more comfortable with the
general flow of the game. Guys just
seem to enjoy playing with one an
other, and the basket opens up like a
black hole when shots are launched
from behind the arc.
On the road? Stanford has sur
passed 60 points only twice, averag
ing just 53 in the other four games.
Defensive passion is there, but the
offense is a cramped mess of con
fused red jerseys lacking cohesion
and spewing inconsistency. When it's
good, it's really good. But when
things turn sour, the team showcases
the lack of development that places
it 249 th in points, 229 th in rebounds
and 288 th in assists per game in the
nation. Not exactly promising rank
ings for a squad boasting a top-15 re
cruiting class.
But the beauty of it all is that de
spite room for improvement and oc
casional play that would make the
2009-10 New Jersey Nets cringe,
things can't get much worse. While
Stanford's 44 percent shooting from
the field may not fluctuate, the 0.9 as
sist-to-turnover ratio will undoubted
ly improve as Dawkins' guys get more
comfortable with each other's ten
dencies. The talent is there, and as the
season progresses, Stanford will be
come more efficient on the offensive
end.
Combating a struggling offense is

the surprisingly staunch defense of a
Cardinal squad that lacks frontcourt
size. Stanford ranks 22nd in the na
tion and first in the conference in
scoring defense, holding opponents
to just 59.5 points per game.The team
also ranks in the top fOO in turnover
margin, which is a testament to its
ability to keep games within reach
with active hands along the perime
ter. It's a skill most teams lack and
every team needs.
This year's Stanford squad is pas
sionate on both ends of the floor, a
noticeable difference from last sea
son's team. If the young guys are able
to sustain this level of energy over the
course of the conference schedule,
and it is a big if, they could make a le
gitimate run at a conference title. Its
floor is relatively low, but if offense
on the road improves in the coming
weeks, Stanford's ceiling is sky-high.
Less-talented teams have made
more improbable runs, especially
considering the unpredictability of
this year's Pac-10.
Confidence in hostile territory is
gained two ways: coaching and expe
rience. The latter is inevitable, with
road trips to Washington, southern
California, Oregon and Cal left on the
schedule.The former is more valuable
and will give Dawkins his biggest test
in what is now his third year on the
Farm. This is his recruiting class, his
team and his year to make a signifi
cant impact in one of the most illustri
ous conferences in college basketball.
The team needs time to grow, but
Dawkins to accelerate it.
Coach knows that the road is long,
but it doesn't have to be bumpy. It's
Johnny's time to smooth out the ride.
