# Basketball grows up quickly

### Zach Zimmerman Dishing the Rock 
The Pac-10 men's basketball
season began exactly as we
expected unexpectedly.
Projected bottom-feeders
have thumped perennial
powerhouses, only one conference
team (No. 18 Washington) is national
ly ranked, and 9-5 Stanford, a team lit
tered with underclassmen, sits in third
place.
Sunday's loss to Arizona came
under unique circumstances for the
Cardinal, but the inconsistent play
throughout the game paints an accu
rate picture of the season that has
been. Stanford, down 15 after looking
like an above-average AAU team,
managed to keep the game within
striking distance with stingy perime
ter defense and streaky displays of
athleticism. Although the Cardinal
lost by 10, Johnny Dawkins has to be
optimistic with the way his team
played.
That said, there is obvious cause
for concern. Dawkins regularly plays
four freshmen, including two starters,
in his nightly rotation. When the new
guys are meshing and playing with the
passion displayed during portions of
Sunday's second half, Stanford is a
tough team to compete with. But the
problem with freshmen, as has been
made unfortunately clear, is that when
the going gets tough on the road,
chaos ensues.
