# AT KNIGHT, GSB SETTLES IN
## Staff begins move to new site 
### MATT BETTONVILLE 
Four of the eight buildings in the rising
Knight Management Center, new home to
the Graduate School of Business (GSB),
opened this month and nearly 150 staff mem
bers have moved in. The remainder of the fa
cility is scheduled to open in March.
The four buildings now in use include
three buildings on Serra Street and one on
Arguello Way, all of which consist of ground
floor classrooms and faculty offices in upper
floors.
Primarily administrative staff has transi
tioned to Knight, including executive educa
tion, admission, external-relations and
human-resources staff, said Kathleen Ka
vanaugh, Knight Management Center pro
gram director. Some classes have moved to
the new facility.
The Knight Management Center project
was a response to a new GSB curriculum that
launched in fall 2007 calling for more classes
held in smaller settings. Whereas the old GSB

facility consisted mostly of 70- to 80-student,
tiered-row classrooms, the Knight Center fea
tures smaller and more intimate rooms to ac
commodate this change in curriculum.
"The Knight Management Center has
many more of these different-sized class
rooms where you can reconfigure the room
and do lots of different, more experiential
projects and more seminar-style classes," Ka
vanaugh said.
Faculty and students now using the facility
praise Knight's modern equipment as well as
its environment and decor. The overall setup
of the buildings has changed to allow for bet
ter lighting.
"There's a natural light everywhere. It
strikes me as a much more welcoming envi
ronment for learning," said Derrick Bolton,
GSB assistant dean and director of M.B.A.
admission, in an e-mail to The Daily. "It re
flects, and even enhances, the GSB's focus on
collaboration and innovation."

The complex is on track to receive Leader
ship in Energy and Environmental Design

(LEED) Platinum certification, the highest
level of environmental sustainability certifi
cation that the U.S. Green Building Council
(USGBC) awards, Kavanaugh added. The
USGBC has already approved the design of
the complex for LEED Platinum, and the
GSB will submit a report on the construction

involved in the project later this year.
The construction budget for the center was
$345 million, according to Kavanaugh.
The cost "will come in under that," said
Kavanaugh. "The question now is just how

much under we're trying to be."
The current goal is to have all
eight buildings of the Knight Man
agement Center and its under
ground parking garage open for
spring quarter. The completed
complex is designed around a
courtyard that features a new cylin
drical, indoor-outdoor dining facil
ity, and the whole center contains
more green space than the old
GSB.
