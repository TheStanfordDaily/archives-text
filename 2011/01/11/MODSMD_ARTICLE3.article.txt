dictorian of the Class of 2006 and
was active in many math and science
clubs and student organizations,
serving as senior class president and
participating in varsity sports, in

being on sports and science and
math teams that were top-ranked in
the state, which included winning
the top Small High School Math
Team in Colorado her senior year.
In sports, Claire earned the coaches'
award for most enthusiasm and
team spirit.
Claire attended Stanford Uni
versity, where tremendous opportu
nities opened up for her. Claire was
a dedicated volunteer, securing a
position as a freshman volunteer co

ing efforts for campus-wide blood
drives and proudly crossing over the
gallon donation level herself. Claire
secured a fellowship at the Robin
son Lab of the Stanford School of
Medicine her freshman summer and
continued with that program
through her sophomore year. The

mune diseases, including multiple
sclerosis.
Claire participated in two for
eign study experiences, first travel
ing to the Middle East for a semi
nar/exchange with Qatar University
studying large engineering projects,
then heading to Oxford University.
Claire found the friendships and ex
perience of the Middle East to be
very powerful as this program was
one of the first mixed-gender sets of
classes for Qatar.
Claire also worked at two early
stage startup companies, Cooliris
and Chegg, and was exposed to the
venture capital world of Kleiner
Perkins. Claire was elected as part of

a slate for class president for the
Class of 2010 and served a partial
term in 2009 before resigning the
position.
During her years at Stanford,
Claire began to shift her initial in
terest from biomechanical engi
neering to the study of brain science
and the biology of the brain. Claire
was working on an exciting fellow
ship program for the Center for
Compassion and Altruism Re
search and Education (CCARE),
affiliated with the medical school.
CCARE was a good fit for Claire, as
it was a multidisciplinary approach
to the study of compassion ranging
from philosophy to neural biology.
Claire headed up the student volun
teer program that was integral to
the successful hosting of the His Ho
liness the Dalai Lama's recent visit
to Stanford.

Claire enjoyed travel, running,
yoga, time with friends and close
time with her Aunt Carla and Uncle

Stuart. She will be deeply missed in
her hometown area in Colorado
and throughout her extended col
lege community. Claire used her
many talents to help others reach
out for their dreams.

Claire was preceded in death by
her older sister Le Anne in 2004, and
that passing left a deep and endur
ing impact on Claire. Claire is sur
vived by her mother and father,
Debra Hollemans and Kurt Roscow
of Lakewood.
