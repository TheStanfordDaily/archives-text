## Judith Jamison recounts a lifetime of dance 
### CAROLINE CHEN STAFF WRITER 
Before she even opened her mouth
to speak, Judith Jamison received a
standing ovation from the audience at
Cubberley Auditorium on Monday
night, when the world-renowned artistic
director of the Alvin Ailey American
Dance Theater was interviewed by
Harry Elam, vice provost for under
graduate education, and shared her life
story and love of dance.
Renowned both as a dancer and cho
reographer, Jamison, 67, is soon to retire
from her position with the dance com
pany. Her numerous awards include
Kennedy Center Honors and the Na
tional Medal of Arts, and she was listed
in Time Magazine's 100 Most Influen
tial People in 2009.
Despite her numerous accolades,
Jamison was remarkably personable, in
fusing her anecdotes with self-deprecat
ing humor. Growing up in a musical
family where her father sang opera and
played classical piano, she began dance
classes when she was six.
"I knew nothing," she laughed, "as
opposed to children nowadays who
know everything at six."
By her first performance, Jamison
said she was "hooked" and, from then
on, continued to dance classical ballet,
jazz and tap through university. Origi
nally, she intended to major in psychol
ogy, but eventually left Fisk University
to join the Philadelphia Dance Acade
