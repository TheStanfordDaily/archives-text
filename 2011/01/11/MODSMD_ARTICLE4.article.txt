## Judith Jamison recounts a lifetime of dance 
### CAROLINE CHEN STAFF WRITER 
Before she even opened her mouth
to speak, Judith Jamison received a
standing ovation from the audience at
Cubberley Auditorium on Monday
night, when the world-renowned artistic
director of the Alvin Ailey American
Dance Theater was interviewed by
Harry Elam, vice provost for under
graduate education, and shared her life
story and love of dance.
Renowned both as a dancer and cho
reographer, Jamison, 67, is soon to retire
from her position with the dance com
pany. Her numerous awards include
Kennedy Center Honors and the Na
tional Medal of Arts, and she was listed
in Time Magazine's 100 Most Influen
tial People in 2009.
Despite her numerous accolades,
Jamison was remarkably personable, in
fusing her anecdotes with self-deprecat
ing humor. Growing up in a musical
family where her father sang opera and
played classical piano, she began dance
classes when she was six.
"I knew nothing," she laughed, "as
opposed to children nowadays who
know everything at six."
By her first performance, Jamison
said she was "hooked" and, from then
on, continued to dance classical ballet,
jazz and tap through university. Origi
nally, she intended to major in psychol
ogy, but eventually left Fisk University
to join the Philadelphia Dance Acade

my.
In the early years of her career,
not only did Jamison have to over
come prejudices against black
dancers, but she also stood out of the
crowd, literally, because of her un
usual height. At 5'10", she is taller
than most dancers.
"I was wondering why everyone
else was so short." she said. "The
mantra was always longer, longer!
Go higher! Lift! And I was there al
ready!"
However, she admitted that
being taller than the norm meant
she had to work extra hard.
"When you're at extremes, you
just have to be extremely fantastic,"
she said.
Jamison also credited her roots in
the church as a great influence on
her dance and choreography.
"I was seeing color and emotion
and great faith," she said of her
childhood church in Philadelphia.
For Jamison, dancing is an inher
ently spiritual experience.
"With dance I don't have to say
anything to you," she explained.
"Our bodies are our truth. There's
nothing else there. That is as close as
I can get to God on terra firma as I'm
going to get."

When Jamison joined Alvin
Ailey in 1965, the company had
only 10 dancers and little funding.
Jamison described the company
members' packed schedule, per
formances in trying conditions on
uncovered, non-spring floors and
the resulting bloody knees and
feet. Despite the difficulties of the
early years, Jamison spoke with
pride of the company's conviction.
"We did it for the love of dance,
for the love of Alvin and for the love
of being excellent at what we do,"
she said.
This passion for dance is what
Jamison looks for today when she
watches dancers audition to join the
company.
"First thing is, do you know your
stuff?," she asked. "Do you know
your alphabet, do you know your
scales? But then there's the heart.
Do I feel that you can't live another
day without dance?"
Jamison encouraged young
dancers to pursue their dreams with
persistence. When asked by a stu
dent studying dance for advice, she
made no attempt to trivialize the
challenges of the profession.
"It's a matter of putting that nose
down to the grindstone you just
have to keep your eyes where you
want to go," she said. "Just keep your
eyes on the prize."
