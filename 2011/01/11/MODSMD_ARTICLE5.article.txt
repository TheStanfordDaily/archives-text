## iPads find role in medical education 
### JOSHUA FALK DESK EDITOR 
The School of Medicine in
August distributed iPads to its
91 incoming first-year stu
dents as part of a trial to incor
| porate the device into the
school's academic experience.
Seeking to facilitate student
learning, the program has also
tried to pique faculty interest
in the iPad and develop more
content for it, said Jenn
Stringer, director of education
al technology at the School of
Medicine.
"We're very interested in
studying the effects of the iPad
on the teaching and learning en
vironment," Stringer said.

Clarence Braddock, associ
ate dean for medical education,
held an "iPad summit" last quar
ter that convened students, fac
ulty and educational technolo
gists to discuss the role of the
iPad in the classroom and how it
is impacting teaching and learn
ing.
The school supplied each
course with an iPad in order to
help familiarize faculty with the
technology their students will
be using. The school also
launched a website called
MedApp, which allows faculty
and students to find and review
iPad apps for use in courses, re
search or clinical practice.
Even before the iPad trial,
students had access to content

in PDF form on Coursework, in
cluding lecture slides and syl
labi, Stringer said. The program
in its first quarter has focused on
annotation programs that can
streamline notetaking and or
ganize content.
"Different courses found its
use was different depending on
the type of material presented
and how students study for that
particular discipline," Stringer
said.
In surgery professor John
Gosling's human anatomy
course, a requirement for all
first-year M.D. students, stu
dents used iPads to annotate
anatomical drawings in lectures,

but did not utilize the technology
much in sections, where section
activities demanded students' at
tention, Gosling said.
Matthew Mansh, a first-year
medical student from Philadel
phia, said he finds the device par
ticularly useful for drawing on
anatomical structures.
"For doing visual note taking,
it's almost better than paper,"
Mansh said.
But while many students have
incorporated their iPads into their
classroom and study routines,
"some people only use it at home
to watch Netflix," Mansh said.
"I think the decision to give it
to us was a little last-minute,"
Mansh said. "They just wanted to
get them in our hands and see how
we used it as a study tool."
While many students find the
iPad an effective notetaking and
study tool, it may not be for every
one.
"In medical school there's a lot
of information," Mansh said. "It's
hard to change your notetaking
style for a new device."
According to a survey conduct
ed by the Office of Medical Edu
cation, a third of students prefer

using old-fashioned printouts to
iPads, Gosling said.
But Gosling emphasized that
the learning experience in a class
such as human anatomy still re
volves around visual images, re
gardless of how they are actual
ized.

"You go from drawing on the
chalkboard, decades ago, to draw
ing on a computer image," Gosling
said, "But the actual way of trans
mitting the image hasn't changed."
