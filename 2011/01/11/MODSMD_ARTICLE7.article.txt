## THE
						FORGOTTEN SOCIAL NETWORK Stanford's own 'Facebook' was once online. 
### BILLY GALLAGHER 
Silicon Valley's Sun Microsystems,
Cisco, Hewlett-Packard, Yahoo,
Google and Facebook are some of
the largest technology companies in
the world. Stanford alumni founded
the first five. But if things had turned out a bit
differently in the fall of 1999, would we have
been able to attribute the creation of Face
book to Stanford as well?
It was in 1999 that three Stanford seniors,
Tuyen Truong 'OO, Lawrence Gentilello 'OO
and Aaron Bell 'OO founded their start-up
Steamtunnels.net, a social networking web
site that paired information from the 1999
version of Stanford Who, called Whols, with
the photos in Stanford's printed Facebook.
Steamtunnels is seen by some as a separate
but early form of the Facebook that exists
today.
In addition to the Facebook component,
Steamtunnels also featured a restaurant
guide, events calendar, bulletin board, online
radio stations, a textbook price comparison
feature and maps of Stanford's physical

steam tunnels on campus, the founders said in
a recent interview with The Daily.
"We were always thinking of ways to liven
up the scene here," Truong said of the then
seniors' desire to enhance the social life for
students.
Bell and Gentilello met during their fresh
man year as residents in Branner, which was
an all-freshman dorm at the time, known af
fectionately as a boisterous "freshman man
sion." All three later joined Theta Delta Chi.
Their last years of college coincided with
the dot-com explosion.
"There was some ridiculous number like
eight legitimate startups and $5O million
raised in venture capital in Theta Delt during
the three years that we were there," Gentilel
lo said.
The trio was inspired to put the printed
Facebook in an online format because stu
dents and fraternities asked to borrow the
trio's copies so frequently.
Bell, a computer science major who began
working at Microsoft when he was 15 years
old, did most of the programming for the site,
which he said was difficult without open
source code.

Truong posted students' photos on the site
by scanning the print Stanford Facebooks in
Meyer Library, where he was supposed to be
working on his honors thesis in biology.
They never had a single, official launch, as
the trio first spread word of the site on an e
mail list they sent to friends about bar nights
and social events. So the website already had
users before freshmen arrived in the fall.
Gentilello recalled the trio's early plans
for expansion.
"Our vision for Steamtunnels, when we
started it, was to expand it to colleges across
the country," Gentilello said.
They configured the site to restrict access
to only those with an IP address on campus
and a Stanford e-mail address. They also had
a feature on the site where users could accept
or deny the posting of their photo.
"We thought,' How awesome would it be if
you met a John at a party and go on and type
in John and find every John, Jonathan, John
ny, and their info, what dorm they're in, what
classes they're taking?"'Truong said.
As the site's "About Us" page stated in

"In retrospect, it
was a big mistake.
We had a killer app
and those are rare
and we should have
stuck with it."
