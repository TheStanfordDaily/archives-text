## THE 						FORGOTTEN SOCIAL NETWORK Stanford's own 'Facebook' was once online. 
### BILLY GALLAGHER 
Silicon Valley's Sun Microsystems,
Cisco, Hewlett-Packard, Yahoo,
Google and Facebook are some of
the largest technology companies in
the world. Stanford alumni founded
the first five. But if things had turned out a bit
differently in the fall of 1999, would we have
been able to attribute the creation of Face
book to Stanford as well?
It was in 1999 that three Stanford seniors,
Tuyen Truong 'OO, Lawrence Gentilello 'OO
and Aaron Bell 'OO founded their start-up
Steamtunnels.net, a social networking web
site that paired information from the 1999
version of Stanford Who, called Whols, with
the photos in Stanford's printed Facebook.
Steamtunnels is seen by some as a separate
but early form of the Facebook that exists
today.
In addition to the Facebook component,
Steamtunnels also featured a restaurant
guide, events calendar, bulletin board, online
radio stations, a textbook price comparison
feature and maps of Stanford's physical

steam tunnels on campus, the founders said in
a recent interview with The Daily.
"We were always thinking of ways to liven
up the scene here," Truong said of the then
seniors' desire to enhance the social life for
students.
Bell and Gentilello met during their fresh
man year as residents in Branner, which was
an all-freshman dorm at the time, known af
fectionately as a boisterous "freshman man
sion." All three later joined Theta Delta Chi.
Their last years of college coincided with
the dot-com explosion.
"There was some ridiculous number like
eight legitimate startups and $5O million
raised in venture capital in Theta Delt during
the three years that we were there," Gentilel
lo said.
The trio was inspired to put the printed
Facebook in an online format because stu
dents and fraternities asked to borrow the
trio's copies so frequently.
Bell, a computer science major who began
working at Microsoft when he was 15 years
old, did most of the programming for the site,
which he said was difficult without open
source code.

Truong posted students' photos on the site
by scanning the print Stanford Facebooks in
Meyer Library, where he was supposed to be
working on his honors thesis in biology.
They never had a single, official launch, as
the trio first spread word of the site on an e
mail list they sent to friends about bar nights
and social events. So the website already had
users before freshmen arrived in the fall.
Gentilello recalled the trio's early plans
for expansion.
"Our vision for Steamtunnels, when we
started it, was to expand it to colleges across
the country," Gentilello said.
They configured the site to restrict access
to only those with an IP address on campus
and a Stanford e-mail address. They also had
a feature on the site where users could accept
or deny the posting of their photo.
"We thought,' How awesome would it be if
you met a John at a party and go on and type
in John and find every John, Jonathan, John
ny, and their info, what dorm they're in, what
classes they're taking?"'Truong said.
As the site's "About Us" page stated in

"In retrospect, it
was a big mistake.
We had a killer app
and those are rare
and we should have
stuck with it."
Lawrence Gentilello 'OO

1999, "Let's face it, the Facebook is
an integral part of Stanford's social
structure: you poured over it fresh
man year getting to know your
class, and now it remains a desktop
reference more cherished and
abused than your Webster's Dictio
nary ... we put the Facebook on
line."
However, only a week after the
release of the beta version of the
site, the trio said the University
pushed for Steamtunnels to shut
down, citing potential Honor Code
violations and removing Gentilello
and Truong from academic advising
positions. They recalled a meeting
with administrators who confront
ed them about shutting the site
down.
"We were like 'Woah, woah,
these pictures are public. Every stu
dent on campus has these," Truong
said.
"They really scared us," Gen
tilello said, adding: "We weren't
prepared to be kicked out of school
for this, so we folded."
Nadira Hira 'O2, who wrote the
original articles about Steamtun
nels for The Daily and now writes
for Fortune magazine, believes that
the success of Steamtunnels was
hindered by its timing.
"I think the fact that it was so
ahead of its time put the adminis
tration on the defensive," she said.
"I don't think that was a function of
them trying to stifle innovation. I
think they just were not prepared
for something like this to happen
just yet."
In an e-mail to The Daily, Marc
Wais, who was dean of students at
the time, defended the administra
tion's actions.
"In my meetings with students
that I can recall, everyone acted in
a polite, professional and respect
ful fashion. At the end of the day,
though, I realize that the students
were not happy that we were ask
ing them not to go forward as they
had planned," he said. "We were
concerned primarily about student
privacy and safety. We were not
comfortable in having any stu
dent's Stanford 'Facebook' picture
on the Web without that student
providing prior consent or choos
ing to opt in."

The trio kept a private, pass
word-protected version of the web
site open for the remainder of their
senior year (steamtunnels.net/
backdoor), and they believe the
University never discovered the
second site. The founders say that
they would have kept trying much
harder at the Facebook component
if they knew how huge a similar site
would become.
The website still made waves
across the country and caught the
attention of two entrepreneurs in
Boston. They flew Bell, Gentilello
and Truong out to Las Vegas and
put them up in a suite in the Venet
ian, convincing them to join them in
making Steamtunnels Magazine,
the founders said.
"In retrospect, it was a big mis
take," Gentilello said. "We had a
killer app and those are rare and we
should have stuck with it. But we
got tempted by being whisked off to
Vegas and given fat salaries, so we
started pursuing this magazine."
The magazine was a weekly in
sert, like Parade magazine, and was
distributed to more than 230 col
lege newspapers, but the company
folded after the dot-com bubble be
cause of high overhead costs.
The founders do not appear to
harbor any ill will toward Wais or
the administration, but they believe
the University pressured The Daily
to remove Hira's stories from the
newspaper's website when Face
book became popular. No stories
dated before 2001 appear on The
Daily's site now, though the print
archives still exist at the newspa
per's office and in the Media Micro
text Center in Green Library.
Several former editors in chief
who worked at The Daily between
2004 and 2006 responded to ques
tions for this story; they and Hira
say they were not involved in any
discussions to remove the stories.
Several did mention technical dif
ficulties with the website over the
years as possible explanations for
the stories' alleged disappear
ances.
At the end of his interview with
The Daily, Bell tried to convince the
rest of the trio to watch The Social
Network with him in Mountain
View. One can only surmise that if
fate had twisted slightly differently,
maybe the new film would have
been about them.

Steamtunnels is seen by some as a separate
but early form of the Facebook that exists
today.
In addition to the Facebook component,
Steamtunnels also featured a restaurant
guide, events calendar, bulletin board, online
radio stations, a textbook price comparison
feature and maps of Stanford's physical

steam tunnels on campus, the founders said in
a recent interview with The Daily.
"We were always thinking of ways to liven
up the scene here," Truong said of the then
seniors' desire to enhance the social life for
students.
Bell and Gentilello met during their fresh
man year as residents in Branner, which was
an all-freshman dorm at the time, known af
fectionately as a boisterous "freshman man
sion." All three later joined Theta Delta Chi.
Their last years of college coincided with
the dot-com explosion.
"There was some ridiculous number like
eight legitimate startups and $5O million
raised in venture capital in Theta Delt during
the three years that we were there," Gentilel
lo said.
The trio was inspired to put the printed
Facebook in an online format because stu
dents and fraternities asked to borrow the
trio's copies so frequently.
Bell, a computer science major who began
working at Microsoft when he was 15 years
old, did most of the programming for the site,
which he said was difficult without open
source code.

Truong posted students' photos on the site
by scanning the print Stanford Facebooks in
Meyer Library, where he was supposed to be
working on his honors thesis in biology.
They never had a single, official launch, as
the trio first spread word of the site on an e
mail list they sent to friends about bar nights
and social events. So the website already had
users before freshmen arrived in the fall.
Gentilello recalled the trio's early plans
for expansion.
"Our vision for Steamtunnels, when we
started it, was to expand it to colleges across
the country," Gentilello said.
They configured the site to restrict access
to only those with an IP address on campus
and a Stanford e-mail address. They also had
a feature on the site where users could accept
or deny the posting of their photo.
"We thought,' How awesome would it be if
you met a John at a party and go on and type
in John and find every John, Jonathan, John
ny, and their info, what dorm they're in, what
classes they're taking?"'Truong said.
As the site's "About Us" page stated in

"In retrospect, it
was a big mistake.
We had a killer app
and those are rare
and we should have
stuck with it."
Lawrence Gentilello 'OO

1999, "Let's face it, the Facebook is
an integral part of Stanford's social
structure: you poured over it fresh
man year getting to know your
class, and now it remains a desktop
reference more cherished and
abused than your Webster's Dictio
nary ... we put the Facebook on
line."
However, only a week after the
release of the beta version of the
site, the trio said the University
pushed for Steamtunnels to shut
down, citing potential Honor Code
violations and removing Gentilello
and Truong from academic advising
positions. They recalled a meeting
with administrators who confront
ed them about shutting the site
down.
"We were like 'Woah, woah,
these pictures are public. Every stu
dent on campus has these," Truong
said.
"They really scared us," Gen
tilello said, adding: "We weren't
prepared to be kicked out of school
for this, so we folded."
Nadira Hira 'O2, who wrote the
original articles about Steamtun
nels for The Daily and now writes
for Fortune magazine, believes that
the success of Steamtunnels was
hindered by its timing.
"I think the fact that it was so
ahead of its time put the adminis
tration on the defensive," she said.
"I don't think that was a function of
them trying to stifle innovation. I
think they just were not prepared
for something like this to happen
just yet."
In an e-mail to The Daily, Marc
Wais, who was dean of students at
the time, defended the administra
tion's actions.
"In my meetings with students
that I can recall, everyone acted in
a polite, professional and respect
ful fashion. At the end of the day,
though, I realize that the students
were not happy that we were ask
ing them not to go forward as they
had planned," he said. "We were
concerned primarily about student
privacy and safety. We were not
comfortable in having any stu
dent's Stanford 'Facebook' picture
on the Web without that student
providing prior consent or choos
ing to opt in."

The trio kept a private, pass
word-protected version of the web
site open for the remainder of their
senior year (steamtunnels.net/
backdoor), and they believe the
University never discovered the
second site. The founders say that
they would have kept trying much
harder at the Facebook component
if they knew how huge a similar site
would become.
The website still made waves
across the country and caught the
attention of two entrepreneurs in
Boston. They flew Bell, Gentilello
and Truong out to Las Vegas and
put them up in a suite in the Venet
ian, convincing them to join them in
making Steamtunnels Magazine,
the founders said.
"In retrospect, it was a big mis
take," Gentilello said. "We had a
killer app and those are rare and we
should have stuck with it. But we
got tempted by being whisked off to
Vegas and given fat salaries, so we
started pursuing this magazine."
The magazine was a weekly in
sert, like Parade magazine, and was
distributed to more than 230 col
lege newspapers, but the company
folded after the dot-com bubble be
cause of high overhead costs.
The founders do not appear to
harbor any ill will toward Wais or
the administration, but they believe
the University pressured The Daily
to remove Hira's stories from the
newspaper's website when Face
book became popular. No stories
dated before 2001 appear on The
Daily's site now, though the print
archives still exist at the newspa
per's office and in the Media Micro
text Center in Green Library.
Several former editors in chief
who worked at The Daily between
2004 and 2006 responded to ques
tions for this story; they and Hira
say they were not involved in any
discussions to remove the stories.
Several did mention technical dif
ficulties with the website over the
years as possible explanations for
the stories' alleged disappear
ances.
At the end of his interview with
The Daily, Bell tried to convince the
rest of the trio to watch The Social
Network with him in Mountain
View. One can only surmise that if
fate had twisted slightly differently,
maybe the new film would have
been about them.
