# SETTING UP BACK HOME
## 
### ZOELEAVITT SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Most people go to college
to escape their home
town, but for Rey Sal
dana 'O9 M.A. 'lO, five
years and three degrees
from Stanford not to mention catch
ing for Cardinal baseball served as
mere interludes between his deep in
volvement in improving his city of San
Antonio, Texas. Now his dreams have
begun to crescendo following his post
graduation decision to return to San An
tonio and run for city council.
"For me, the opportunity to run for
office was never something I was think
ing about, but the opportunity kind of
presented itself," said Saldana, who has
begun his campaign for the city council
election in May.

While the specifics of his current as
pirations may be new, the love for San
Antonio has remained with Saldana
ever since his days in one of the city's
public schools. Two Stanford alumni
have served as the guiding stars of Sal

dana's path ever since he first came into
contact with them as a high school stu
dent. Julian Castro '96, mayor of San An
tonio, and his brother, Joaquin Castro
'96, a Democrat in the Texas House of
Representatives, introduced Saldana to
the ideas of leaving home for school and
returning home to help.
"They introduced me to schools like
Stanford without them, I wouldn't
have applied," Saldana said. "I've been
following their career very literally, even
studying the same majors they did as
Stanford students."
Saldana held a summer internship
under Joaquin Castro in college, begin
ning his political career.
"Those two guys are really great pub
lic servants and elected officials, and
they helped me find a direction for my
own passion," he said. "I think we have
parallel visions for this city."
One of those visions, in fact, goes to
ward helping more students form con
nections like the one Saldana felt with
the Castros. Running a campaign that
focuses on increasing opportunities for
San Antonio's children, Saldana's been
backing up his words with the grit of

chalk dust and the smudge of pencil
lead. Tutoring underprivileged students
throughout the fall, and beginning a
teaching job this winter has illustrated
the ins and outs of the city's struggling
education system, he says.
"Stories like myself are unfortunate
ly not normal," he said. "Mentors are
tougher to find, and I think that should
n't be the case."
His role as a Stanford graduate has
already helped him make a difference in
San Antonio as a mentor. But his ability
to leverage his Stanford connections is
what may give Saldana's campaign the
most power in spreading his message.
Stanford computer science students
built his campaign website, and many of
his friends and classmates have already
contributed time and money to his
cause.
And of course his story wouldn't be
complete without the tale of one Stan
ford friendship embedded throughout.
Matt Platkin 'O9, who befriended Sal
dana on the pair's first day of their fresh
man year, now serves as Saldana's head

campaign manager.
"This race is going to come
down to who's willing to work the
hardest, and I think we're going to
come out on top," Platkin said. "The
issue is who has the best interests of
the voters in mind, and I don't think
anyone can dispute Rey's inten
tions."
"I don't think [less] quantity of
experience is going to be a barrier
when you have the types of experi
ence Rey has," he said of Saldana's
young age compared to his oppo
nents.
Rey agreed that his internships
in San Antonio city council and for
the U.S. Department of the Trea
sury, combined with his exposure to

Palo Alto and to Stanford ideals,
will prove valuable.
"There's a spirit of taking risks
and being involved in something
more worthwhile than your own
success," he said of Stanford.
In the meantime, Saldana and
Platkin will run a full schedule of
campaigning, debating, and going
door to door through San Antonio
until the election in May. It's a high
profile risk for someone safe within
the Farm until last June, but Sal
dana believes his dedication to his
residents will shine brightest.
"I'm always worried about some
acronym someone in the audience
is going to throw out that I missed,
but walking down 5,000 streets,
knocking on 5,000 doors, and talk
ing to 5,000 people is what matters,"
he said.
