## CONTINUED I'm Getting Dumber 
### Jade Wang 
I've had a sneaking suspicion for
years now that I'm actively get
ting dumber. I know that it
seems counterintuitive, especially
given the extremely intimidating ar
rival of the University bill in my
inbox all too often, but it might be
happening. I might be getting
dumber.
My worries originated when I
found myself in a class that required
that I had taken some math course
many moons ago. I had, but had
only dim memories of struggling to
stay awake in class. I assumed the
prerequisite was more of a formali
ty and less of a reality. False. Faced
with problem sets peppered with
strange symbols I dubbed "curly
d's" and "stretchy f's," I was forced
to shamelessly Google mathemati
cal concepts at which my high
school self would have scoffed.
(You know what works surprisingly
well, though? Looking up math tu
torials on You Tube.)
I eventually muddled through
the course with a cobbled-together
understanding of math, but by no
means did I ever regain the mastery
I thought I had once achieved. A
confession: I absolutely loved high
school calculus but acted like I did
n't. My college-aged (and, in fact,
even graduate-student-aged) self,
however, could barely read a few in
timidating Greek letters without as
sistance.
My second grievance: I kind of
can't read anymore. I haven't fallen
illiterate, obviously, but my atten
tion span for reading has withered.
Over winter break, my little sister,
worried about impending high
school, asked me how many books
she will be expected to read. In re
sponse, I reminisced at her for
longer than she bargained for, but
also realized that I used to actually
read books. Given, I did not actual
ly complete every book I was as
signed, but I at least gave it an ef
fort. Now, every PDF file I down
load off Coursework makes me feel
handcuffed to my laptop for an
eternity, and pages that go beyond
the single digits make me feel like I
am being stretched too thin. It's
worse when I'm not reading for
school. If the interesting articles
that grace my inbox are more than a
few paragraphs, it feels like fighting
magnets to keep my eyes reading,
and I don't even want to talk about
the books I read for fun these days.
(Bottom line: Not acceptable, even
ironically.)
In fact, I think my attention span
might be suffering in general. An
other conversation with my little
sister reminded me of the long
hours our younger siblings spend

and our younger selves spent in
school, at least moderately mentally
engaged. Considering the multitude
of silent death glares that our pro
fessors receive if they lecture to
minute 51, I'm amazed that I ever
managed to slog through a school
day that was more than seven hours
long. I try to remember what it was
like, but my memory comes up
short. I remember being bored, but
I don't remember going into an un
controllable rage, sobbing or just
storming out, which is what my
present-day self would do if faced
with that kind of day.
So, there you have it. I think I
might be getting dumber. Penning a
weekly column is probably pushing
my feeble mind to its utmost capac
ity. I don't know the proper course
of action. My parents scoff and tell
me to stop complaining. I'm not
sure that Vaden would grant me an
appointment. I don't want to be
come one of those people who goes
off about the glory days, spouting
off numerous stories about their
golden youths, beginning with,
"When I was smart..."
I hope I'm just being paranoid.
Maybe my youth was also a haze of
confusion and feeling mostly dull,
and I just don't remember those
parts. Maybe this is normal, and
being an adult means just feeling
slightly inadequate and a little bit
like I've somehow tricked everyone
else. Let's hope so.
