# LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
## Let's talk 
### 
Dear Editor,
You had a lot of good points,
Stewart Macgregor-Dennis 'l3,
and you wrote them well in your
op-ed this past Monday, advising
Stanford students how they can
"become more effective." But I
wish you'd stopped at the end of
paragraph one, when you said,
"Let's talk."

Because that's the thing Stan
ford students do poorly, I think:
talking. Not elevator-speech-mar
keting talking, or PWR-presenta
tion-talking; we're pretty good at
those. No, I mean letting-someone
know-you're-human talking.
Hey, Stanford students. You all
are by now well-versed in how to
be successful. You've got an idea of
how to work systems and play
games. But how good are you at
being happy? How good are you at
being not-lonely? You might have
the courage to lead a start-up or to
medicate Sudanese orphans, but
do you have the courage to let
someone else know that like every
one else, you're less than perfect?
At lunch today a friend and I
were talking about a mutual friend,
someone who I thought had confi
dence oozing out of her ears and
lots of friends because she always
seems so cheerful and so accom
plished. Certainly "effective."
Turns out she's suffering from mas
sive loneliness. She and I could
start a club, along with the thou
sands of other Stanford students
who feel like they don't have a
community, and who as long as
they don't think they have the
strength to let others know how
lonely they are, will never find a

community.
You want to be successful? Vo
cally be yourself all of yourself,
the perfect and the imperfect.
Example: last quarter, I spent
half an hour writing a letter about
how lonely, how frustrated I am at
Stanford. I e-mailed it to eight lists.
Within 72 hours, I had over 50 re
sponses from staff, alumni and so
many students saying, "Thank
God, I thought I was the only one
feeling that way. Thank you for
being so brave."
That word stuck out to me:
brave. I was being called running
my mouth about my feelings, by all
the Stanford students tutoring in
mates in San Jose or running their
own companies. As a result of that
bit of emotional honesty, I've met
with so, so many amazing people
and have been given so many lead
ership opportunities.
My conclusion: you want to
market yourself to the world?
Show the world that you trust it
enough to let it see your whole self.
Oh, silly Stanford students. You
think you can save the world when
you can't even save yourselves.
You think you can save humanity
when you can't even be human.
You want to be wholly accepted,
but you won't show your whole
self.
What they told you in kinder
garten is true: you're great the way
you are. Trust yourself enough to
believe that you can be loved even
with your imperfections. In the
words of Sami Hartley, one of the
leaders of Stanford's Bridge,
"Words are cheap, but they're what
we can afford. So let's talk."
