## Come to Women's Basketball, You Sexist Hypocrites 
### Peter McDonald 
Because seriously, I feel em
barrassed after having waxed
all poetic and shit last quarter
at how this campus is finally learn
ing how to rally around its sports
teams only to walk in last weekend
and find 7,000-seat Maples half-full
and dead, and after we BEAT
UCONN, too. One of the best bas
ketball teams in the country is right
in your backyard, but unless Jersey
Shore Auriemma is in town, none of
you seem to care.
It's real sad too, because every
student I know that starts following
the women's basketball team (i.e. the
Band) eventually falls in love with
them.They've been a great source of
joy for me over the past four years,
and I've definitely developed a crush
on Kayla Pedersen by this point. All
they do is lay waste to the Pac-10 and
make the Final Four year after year
glorious blood sport for the low,
low price of Free Ninety-Five. Yet,
the only takers are either too old to
yell or too young to pay attention.
Just once, I'd like to see someone
who can actually dance win the Twist
Cam contest. Men's basketball is
rowdy because of the student sec
tion, while at times the atmosphere
at the women's games reminds me of
elementary school.
"But women's basketball is bor
ing, and I don't have time." That's
usually the most enlightened re
sponse I get when I ask people why
they won't go see this team. Even at
Ã¼ber-diverse Stanford, located in
the self-proclaimed most progres
sive area of the country, the men
tion of women's basketball still
prompts misogynistic caveman
chest-beating, usually followed by
petulant whining about the lack of
dunking.
I don't get why dunking is so im
portant, unless you're talking about
Dunk-a-roos. After all,it's just a glo

rified exclamation point, and it
doesn't turn a basket into a sure
thing either. I've seen plenty of hot
stuff male athletes who end up miss
ing an easy basket because they're
too busy trying to make Sports Ce
nter.
It's such a hobbyhorse for
women's basketball haters, though,
that at times I feel the need to don
my French feminist hat and make
claims about how dunking is a vio
lent, penetrative act that reinforces
phallogocentrism, emphasizing
man's supremacy over the ball com
pared to the cooperation with the
ball that the layup requires, which is
more in tune with the feminine
ideal, and that the positioning of
dunking as an essential part of the
game is a means of preserving the
especially strong patriarchy of
sports by creating a space of exclu
sion in the sport of basketball. I
don't actually have to make those
arguments, though, because they
imply that women can't dunk be
cause they're inferior athletes,
which is not true. Both Ogwumikes
can dunk, and I'm pretty sure Ped
ersen can as well; it's just that Tara
VanDerveer thinks it's bad sports
manship. If you want dunking, then
show up and get amped and de
mand it. That's the only way you'll
convince Tara to take the reins off
(and, I won't lie, it'd be awesome).
The dunking issue aside, if you
still want to argue that women's
basketball is more boring, then I
think it's time for a field trip to last

weekend's box scores. Which team
would you rather watch, the one
that shot over 50 percent in both
games, going 80 percent and 36 per
cent from behind the arc with 21
steals on the weekend, or the team
that shot 42 percent both times with
20-percent and 16.7-percent three
point shooting and eight steals on
the weekend?
I shouldn't have to resort to
pointing out the men's shortcom
ings to prove women's basketball's
worth, though; in fact, that's still re
inforcing the problem. If you can't
enjoy just watching the Ogwumike
sisters play their beautiful brand of
basketball without having to qualify
it by comparing them to men, then
you're not really a fan of the game.
Eastern Tennessee and the state of
Connecticut seem to understand
this; their teams drew crowds three
times the size of ours last weekend,
and those places are still respective
bastions of Confederate pride and
liberal privilege. Stanford's sup
posed to be all about forward think
ing, and it'd be nice if we could
apply that mindset to our approach
toward athletics instead of clinging
to a worldview that's more reminis
cent of our past as a boy's club for
rich white Californians that tried
just a little bit harder than the U$C
student body. More importantly
though, the main attraction of col
lege basketball is the enthusiasm of
the fans, and you just can't get that
when your crowd consists of geri
atrics and easily distracted 10-year
old girls, so show up and yell, and
pre-game it too if that's your style,
because as much as I want to take
down institutional oppression, I'm
really just asking you to watch
sports, and we all like sports, right?
