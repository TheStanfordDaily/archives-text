## A 						YEAR IN REVIEW Looking back at the football season that was in the final chapter of the Pac-10 conference 
### JACOB JAFFE DEPUTY EDITOR 
Monday night's BCS National
Championship Game marked the
end of the 2010-11 college football
season, which turned out to be very
eventful for the Pac-lO.For one thing,
it was during this season that the ex
pansion to the Pac-12 was finalized
for next year, so it marked the final
season of the Pac-10 as we know it.
On the field, several other story
lines unfolded throughout the sea
son, starting off with the NCAA's
crackdown on USC. The Trojans lost
scholarships and could not partici
pate in a bowl game, so many college
football fans wrote off the Pac-10 as a
legitimate national title contender.
Preseason outlooks were so varied
that most pundits expected the Pac
-10 to be filled with parity in 2010-11,
leading teams to beat up on each
other enough during the conference
season to take away any shot for the
Pac-10 to figure in the national scene.
By all accounts, preseason expec
tations were wrong. While the bottom
half of the Pac-10 did cannibalize it
self, the top certainly had an impact
on the national scene. Oregon was
coming off a Rose Bowl berth and ap
peared to be a frontrunner, but the
loss of Jeremiah Masoli (a preseason
Heisman Trophy contender) in
creased doubts among media mem
bers and fans alike. Almost no one
predicted a dominant sweep of the
Pac-10 and an unbeaten regular sea
son, but that's just what the Ducks
pulled off on their way to the BCS
National Championship Game,
Possibly more surprising was the
ascension of Stanford into the coun
try's elite. The Cardinal did not even
crack either major preseason top 25
poll, and question marks cluttered
both sides of the ball. The emergence
of Stanford's running game without
departed star Toby Gerhart and the
remarkable improvement of Vic Fan
gio's defense surprised the college
football world as the Cardinal fin
ished one half away from a perfect
season.
While Oregon and Stanford en
hanced the Pac-10's reputation with
arguably the best season in each pro
gram's history, several other teams
failed to live up to preseason expecta
tions.
Chief among them was Oregon
State, who began the year ranked
third in the Pac-10 preseason poll and
24th in the AP Poll, but ended the
year with its worst record since 1997.
Early losses against TCU and Boise
State (who finished a combined 25-1)
did not raise too much alarm, but
going 1-4 down the stretch, including
losses to UCLA and Washington
State (who combined for only three
Pac-10 victories UCLA over Ore
gon State, Washington State over
Oregon State and UCLA over Wash
ington State), was the reason why the
Beavers missed a bowl game for the
first time since 2005. The loss of re
ceiver James Rodgers to a season
ending injury in early October cer
tainly did not help matters, but much
more was expected of a team that
came within one win of a Rose Bowl
berth in each of the previous two
years.
Oregon State was one of three
Pac-10 teams to miss out on a bowl
game by just one win. Arizona State
finished 6-6 but had two wins over
FCS foes and therefore did not quali
fy for a bowl.lhe Sun Devils came oh
so close to bowl eligibility, losing four
games by four points or fewer.
Blocked extra points were the differ

ence in one-point road losses to both
Wisconsin and USC, but Arizona
State ended on a strong note by
blocking two extra points themselves
in a thrilling double-overtime win
over rival Arizona to cap the season.
California also sniffed bowl eligi
bility before eventually falling just
short.The Golden Bears were among
the most inconsistent teams in the
country all season. In their first eight
games, the Bears went 4-0 at home
with an average margin of victory of
38.75 points per game and 0-4 on the
road with an average margin of de
feat of 21 points per game, Cal finally
broke the trend with a win at Wash
ington State to get to 5-4 overall, but
the new trend could not be stopped
either, as Cal lost its final three games
at home.
USC was a bit of an enigma com
ing into the season, filled with talent
but crippled by NCAA sanctions. The
Trojans continued to be an enigma,
following up a 4-0 start with a disap
pointing effort at home against Wash
ington. USC rebounded with a near
win at Stanford and a blowout victory
over Cal. Following a respectable loss
to Oregon, the Trojans swept the Ari
zona schools before laying a massive
egg against Oregon State. A head
scratching home loss to Notre Dame
and a win over rival UCLA finished
off an up-and-down 8-5 season.
Only two teams UCLA and
Washington State did not ap
proach bowl eligibility, although each
had its own highlights: the Bruins won
convincingly at Texas and the
Cougars broke their Pac-10 losing
streak with a road win over Oregon
State.
Heading into bowl season, the
Pac-10 only managed four bowl
berths (not including USC, which had
enough wins but was ineligible). Ore
gon and Stanford secured spots in
BCS bowl games due to rankings of
No. 2 and No. 4, respectively, in the
final BCS standings. Arizona clinched
bowl eligibility early with a 7-1 start
but stumbled down the stretch, losing
its last four regular-season games.
Washington secured the final spot in
exactly the opposite way, limping out
to a 3-6 start before winning its last
three regular-season games to sneak
into a bowl.
The first Pac-10 team to partici
pate in its bowl was Arizona, which
took on Oklahoma State in the
Alamo Bowl. The Wildcats came in as
underdogs due to their season-end
ing four-game losing streak and Okla
homa State's 10-2 record. Both teams
entered with explosive passing
games, and many predicted a back
and-forth duel between quarterbacks
Brandon Weeden and Nick Foles.
Neither quarterback responded with
a strong performance. Weeden threw
for only 240 yards, his second-lowest
total of the season, while Foles threw
three interceptions after throwing no
more than one in his last 16 games.
The ground attacks were even more
pitiful, as neither team reached 100
yards rushing. With such poor offen
sive play, the game came down to de
fense, and the Cowboy defense made
far more plays. Oklahoma State
forced four turnovers while Arizona
forced none, and this made the differ
ence in a 36-10 rout by the Cowboys.
Next up was Washington, who
many expected to fare even worse
than Arizona, and for good reason.
The Huskies were a two-touchdown
underdog to Nebraska in the Holiday
Bowl after getting blown out by the
Cornhuskers in Seattle earlier in the

year. The questions heading into the
game were whether anything had
changed since Nebraska won 56-21 in
September and whether Nebraska
would be motivated for the rematch.
Both these questions were answered
early on, as Washington took control
immediately and never looked back.
Quarterback Jake Locker hardly im
proved from his 4-for-20 perform
ance in September, completing only
five of his 16 passes for 56 yards. The
keys for the Huskies were the run
ning game and defense, which both
performed as well as they had all sea
son. Running back Chris Polk and
Locker combined for 260 yards on 47
carries, while Nebraska's potent
rushing attack was held to 91 yards
on 41 carries. The Cornhuskers
looked flat all game, and the Huskies
capitalized with a 19-7 win.
Stanford took the field next in the
Orange Bowl against Virginia Tech.
The Hokies were making their third
Orange Bowl appearance in four
years, while the Cardinal was making
its debut in the game. The matchup
was touted as one of the better games
of the bowl season, as both teams
came into the game on a roll. Virginia
Tech had lost its first two games of the
season to Boise State and James
Madison, but responded with 11
straight wins and an ACC title. Stan
ford had already set a school record
with 11 wins and was looking to win a
bowl game for the first time since
1996. The highly anticipated quarter
back battle between redshirt sopho
more Andrew Luck and Tyrod Taylor
started in favor of Taylor, who made
all the highlight reels with a remark
ably athletic touchdown throw to
running back David Wilson to give
the Hokies their first lead at 9-7. It
proved to be their only lead of the
game, though, as Stanford came out
inspired in the second half, putting
the game away on both sides of the
ball. Luck was particularly impres
sive, completing nine of his 10 sec
ond-half passes for 201 yards and
three touchdowns, all to junior tight
end Coby Fleener. The Cardinal de
fense was stifling, holding Virginia
Tech scoreless in the half as Stanford
cruised to the 40-12 win.
The final bowl game featuring a
Pac-10 team was also the biggest one
of all the BCS National Champi
onship Game between Oregon and
Auburn. Both teams came in with un
defeated records, Heisman Trophy fi
nalists, explosive offenses and ques
tionable defenses. All the buzz fo
cused on an offensive thriller, but the
title game proved to be anything but.
While neither team could pull ahead
by more than one score, neither of
fense enjoyed anything close to the
success it had all season. Both quar
terbacks were sloppy, as Darron
Thomas and Heisman winner Cam
Newton committed two turnovers
apiece.
Thomas bounced back from some
questionable decisions on zone reads
to pass for a career-high 363 yards.
The Ducks needed this passing at
tack, though, because their normally
electric rushing game was shut down
by Auburn's defense, tallying only 75
yards. Running back LaMichael
James, who was a Heisman finalist
and the nation's leading rusher, man
aged only 49 rushing yards and was
limited due to injury.
Meanwhile, Auburn had bursts of

offense followed by long stretches of
stagnation. The Tigers were very suc
cessful on the ground, racking up 254
yards, while Newton passed for 265.
Despite all this yardage, Auburn's
lead was only 19-11 with a few min
utes to play. While trying to run out
the clock, Oregon linebacker Casey
Matthews knocked the ball out of
Newton's hand from behind, and cor
nerback Cliff Harris fell on the ball.
The Duck offense, which had not
scored for over 35 game minutes, re
sponded with a crucial touchdown
drive to bring the score to 19-17. On
the two-point conversion attempt,
Thomas rolled in the pocket and
found receiver Jeff Maehl open in the
back of the end zone to tie the game
with 2:33 to play.
The Tigers got the ball back on
their own 25-yard line looking for a
final drive to win the game. After a
15-yard pass brought Auburn near
midfield, the Tigers benefited from
one of the craziest plays in title-game
history. Running back Michael Dyer
took the handoff and ran for a rou
tine gain of about five yards before
he was wrestled down by defensive
back Eddie Pleasant. As Dyer got up
and walked toward the sideline, his
coaches screamed at him to keep
running because his knee had never
touched the ground. Both teams had
completely stopped, but the refs did
not blow the whistle, so Dyer contin
ued running all the way to Oregon's
23-yard line. The play was upheld by
replay, and the damage was done.
Following another Dyer run that
nearly got in the end zone, Auburn
set up for the game-winning chip
shot field goal, which kicker Wes
Byrum knocked straight through to
give the Tigers the 22-19 win and
their first national championship
since 1957.
In total, Pac-10 teams went 2-2 in
bowl games, which is fairly success
ful considering three of the four
teams were underdogs. Arizona
played poorly, but this was expected
after a terrible end to the season.
Washington surprised everyone by
dominating Nebraska in arguably
the biggest shocker of the entire
bowl season. Stanford took an ap
parent nail-biter and made it into a
rout that validated its season. Ore
gon lost a very tight national title
game that could very well have gone
to overtime if not for an absolute
fluke of a play. In the end, the Pac-10
joins the SEC, MAC and WAC with
.500 bowl records, but the 2010-11
season will mostly be remembered
for the Pac-10 having only four
teams go bowling, and for the per
formances of Stanford and Oregon
in BCS games.

and a win over rival UCLA finished
off an up-and-down 8-5 season.
Only two teams UCLA and
Washington State did not ap
proach bowl eligibility, although each
had its own highlights: the Bruins won
convincingly at Texas and the
Cougars broke their Pac-10 losing
streak with a road win over Oregon
State.
Heading into bowl season, the
Pac-10 only managed four bowl
berths (not including USC, which had
enough wins but was ineligible). Ore
gon and Stanford secured spots in
BCS bowl games due to rankings of
No. 2 and No. 4, respectively, in the
final BCS standings. Arizona clinched
bowl eligibility early with a 7-1 start
but stumbled down the stretch, losing
its last four regular-season games.
Washington secured the final spot in
exactly the opposite way, limping out
to a 3-6 start before winning its last
three regular-season games to sneak
into a bowl.
The first Pac-10 team to partici
pate in its bowl was Arizona, which
took on Oklahoma State in the
Alamo Bowl. The Wildcats came in as
underdogs due to their season-end
ing four-game losing streak and Okla
homa State's 10-2 record. Both teams
entered with explosive passing
games, and many predicted a back
and-forth duel between quarterbacks
Brandon Weeden and Nick Foles.
Neither quarterback responded with
a strong performance. Weeden threw
for only 240 yards, his second-lowest
total of the season, while Foles threw
three interceptions after throwing no
more than one in his last 16 games.
The ground attacks were even more
pitiful, as neither team reached 100
yards rushing. With such poor offen
sive play, the game came down to de
fense, and the Cowboy defense made
far more plays. Oklahoma State
forced four turnovers while Arizona
forced none, and this made the differ
ence in a 36-10 rout by the Cowboys.
Next up was Washington, who
many expected to fare even worse
than Arizona, and for good reason.
The Huskies were a two-touchdown
underdog to Nebraska in the Holiday
Bowl after getting blown out by the
Cornhuskers in Seattle earlier in the

year. The questions heading into the
game were whether anything had
changed since Nebraska won 56-21 in
September and whether Nebraska
would be motivated for the rematch.
Both these questions were answered
early on, as Washington took control
immediately and never looked back.
Quarterback Jake Locker hardly im
proved from his 4-for-20 perform
ance in September, completing only
five of his 16 passes for 56 yards. The
keys for the Huskies were the run
ning game and defense, which both
performed as well as they had all sea
son. Running back Chris Polk and
Locker combined for 260 yards on 47
carries, while Nebraska's potent
rushing attack was held to 91 yards
on 41 carries. The Cornhuskers
looked flat all game, and the Huskies
capitalized with a 19-7 win.
Stanford took the field next in the
Orange Bowl against Virginia Tech.
The Hokies were making their third
Orange Bowl appearance in four
years, while the Cardinal was making
its debut in the game. The matchup
was touted as one of the better games
of the bowl season, as both teams
came into the game on a roll. Virginia
Tech had lost its first two games of the
season to Boise State and James
Madison, but responded with 11
straight wins and an ACC title. Stan
ford had already set a school record
with 11 wins and was looking to win a
bowl game for the first time since
1996. The highly anticipated quarter
back battle between redshirt sopho
more Andrew Luck and Tyrod Taylor
started in favor of Taylor, who made
all the highlight reels with a remark
ably athletic touchdown throw to
running back David Wilson to give
the Hokies their first lead at 9-7. It
proved to be their only lead of the
game, though, as Stanford came out
inspired in the second half, putting
the game away on both sides of the
ball. Luck was particularly impres
sive, completing nine of his 10 sec
ond-half passes for 201 yards and
three touchdowns, all to junior tight
end Coby Fleener. The Cardinal de
fense was stifling, holding Virginia
Tech scoreless in the half as Stanford
cruised to the 40-12 win.
The final bowl game featuring a
Pac-10 team was also the biggest one
of all the BCS National Champi
onship Game between Oregon and
Auburn. Both teams came in with un
defeated records, Heisman Trophy fi
nalists, explosive offenses and ques
tionable defenses. All the buzz fo
cused on an offensive thriller, but the
title game proved to be anything but.
While neither team could pull ahead
by more than one score, neither of
fense enjoyed anything close to the
success it had all season. Both quar
terbacks were sloppy, as Darron
Thomas and Heisman winner Cam
Newton committed two turnovers
apiece.
Thomas bounced back from some
questionable decisions on zone reads
to pass for a career-high 363 yards.
The Ducks needed this passing at
tack, though, because their normally
electric rushing game was shut down
by Auburn's defense, tallying only 75
yards. Running back LaMichael
James, who was a Heisman finalist
and the nation's leading rusher, man
aged only 49 rushing yards and was
limited due to injury.
Meanwhile, Auburn had bursts of

offense followed by long stretches of
stagnation. The Tigers were very suc
cessful on the ground, racking up 254
yards, while Newton passed for 265.
Despite all this yardage, Auburn's
lead was only 19-11 with a few min
utes to play. While trying to run out
the clock, Oregon linebacker Casey
Matthews knocked the ball out of
Newton's hand from behind, and cor
nerback Cliff Harris fell on the ball.
The Duck offense, which had not
scored for over 35 game minutes, re
sponded with a crucial touchdown
drive to bring the score to 19-17. On
the two-point conversion attempt,
Thomas rolled in the pocket and
found receiver Jeff Maehl open in the
back of the end zone to tie the game
with 2:33 to play.
The Tigers got the ball back on
their own 25-yard line looking for a
final drive to win the game. After a
15-yard pass brought Auburn near
midfield, the Tigers benefited from
one of the craziest plays in title-game
history. Running back Michael Dyer
took the handoff and ran for a rou
tine gain of about five yards before
he was wrestled down by defensive
back Eddie Pleasant. As Dyer got up
and walked toward the sideline, his
coaches screamed at him to keep
running because his knee had never
touched the ground. Both teams had
completely stopped, but the refs did
not blow the whistle, so Dyer contin
ued running all the way to Oregon's
23-yard line. The play was upheld by
replay, and the damage was done.
Following another Dyer run that
nearly got in the end zone, Auburn
set up for the game-winning chip
shot field goal, which kicker Wes
Byrum knocked straight through to
give the Tigers the 22-19 win and
their first national championship
since 1957.
In total, Pac-10 teams went 2-2 in
bowl games, which is fairly success
ful considering three of the four
teams were underdogs. Arizona
played poorly, but this was expected
after a terrible end to the season.
Washington surprised everyone by
dominating Nebraska in arguably
the biggest shocker of the entire
bowl season. Stanford took an ap
parent nail-biter and made it into a
rout that validated its season. Ore
gon lost a very tight national title
game that could very well have gone
to overtime if not for an absolute
fluke of a play. In the end, the Pac-10
joins the SEC, MAC and WAC with
.500 bowl records, but the 2010-11
season will mostly be remembered
for the Pac-10 having only four
teams go bowling, and for the per
formances of Stanford and Oregon
in BCS games.

Monday night's BCS National
Championship Game marked the
end of the 2010-11 college football
season, which turned out to be very
eventful for the Pac-lO.For one thing,
it was during this season that the ex
pansion to the Pac-12 was finalized
for next year, so it marked the final
season of the Pac-10 as we know it.
On the field, several other story
lines unfolded throughout the sea
son, starting off with the NCAA's
crackdown on USC. The Trojans lost
scholarships and could not partici
pate in a bowl game, so many college
football fans wrote off the Pac-10 as a
legitimate national title contender.
Preseason outlooks were so varied
that most pundits expected the Pac
-10 to be filled with parity in 2010-11,
leading teams to beat up on each
other enough during the conference
season to take away any shot for the
Pac-10 to figure in the national scene.
By all accounts, preseason expec
tations were wrong. While the bottom
half of the Pac-10 did cannibalize it
self, the top certainly had an impact
on the national scene. Oregon was
coming off a Rose Bowl berth and ap
peared to be a frontrunner, but the
loss of Jeremiah Masoli (a preseason
Heisman Trophy contender) in
creased doubts among media mem
bers and fans alike. Almost no one
predicted a dominant sweep of the
Pac-10 and an unbeaten regular sea
son, but that's just what the Ducks
pulled off on their way to the BCS
National Championship Game,
Possibly more surprising was the
ascension of Stanford into the coun
try's elite. The Cardinal did not even
crack either major preseason top 25
poll, and question marks cluttered
both sides of the ball. The emergence
of Stanford's running game without
departed star Toby Gerhart and the
remarkable improvement of Vic Fan
gio's defense surprised the college
football world as the Cardinal fin
ished one half away from a perfect
season.
While Oregon and Stanford en
hanced the Pac-10's reputation with
arguably the best season in each pro
gram's history, several other teams
failed to live up to preseason expecta
tions.
Chief among them was Oregon
State, who began the year ranked
third in the Pac-10 preseason poll and
24th in the AP Poll, but ended the
year with its worst record since 1997.
Early losses against TCU and Boise
State (who finished a combined 25-1)
did not raise too much alarm, but
going 1-4 down the stretch, including
losses to UCLA and Washington
State (who combined for only three
Pac-10 victories UCLA over Ore
gon State, Washington State over
Oregon State and UCLA over Wash
ington State), was the reason why the
Beavers missed a bowl game for the
first time since 2005. The loss of re
ceiver James Rodgers to a season
ending injury in early October cer
tainly did not help matters, but much
more was expected of a team that
came within one win of a Rose Bowl
berth in each of the previous two
years.
Oregon State was one of three
Pac-10 teams to miss out on a bowl
game by just one win. Arizona State
finished 6-6 but had two wins over
FCS foes and therefore did not quali
fy for a bowl.lhe Sun Devils came oh
so close to bowl eligibility, losing four
games by four points or fewer.
Blocked extra points were the differ

ence in one-point road losses to both
Wisconsin and USC, but Arizona
State ended on a strong note by
blocking two extra points themselves
in a thrilling double-overtime win
over rival Arizona to cap the season.
California also sniffed bowl eligi
bility before eventually falling just
short.The Golden Bears were among
the most inconsistent teams in the
country all season. In their first eight
games, the Bears went 4-0 at home
with an average margin of victory of
38.75 points per game and 0-4 on the
road with an average margin of de
feat of 21 points per game, Cal finally
broke the trend with a win at Wash
ington State to get to 5-4 overall, but
the new trend could not be stopped
either, as Cal lost its final three games
at home.
USC was a bit of an enigma com
ing into the season, filled with talent
but crippled by NCAA sanctions. The
Trojans continued to be an enigma,
following up a 4-0 start with a disap
pointing effort at home against Wash
ington. USC rebounded with a near
win at Stanford and a blowout victory
over Cal. Following a respectable loss
to Oregon, the Trojans swept the Ari
zona schools before laying a massive
egg against Oregon State. A head
scratching home loss to Notre Dame
and a win over rival UCLA finished
off an up-and-down 8-5 season.
Only two teams UCLA and
Washington State did not ap
proach bowl eligibility, although each
had its own highlights: the Bruins won
convincingly at Texas and the
Cougars broke their Pac-10 losing
streak with a road win over Oregon
State.
Heading into bowl season, the
Pac-10 only managed four bowl
berths (not including USC, which had
enough wins but was ineligible). Ore
gon and Stanford secured spots in
BCS bowl games due to rankings of
No. 2 and No. 4, respectively, in the
final BCS standings. Arizona clinched
bowl eligibility early with a 7-1 start
but stumbled down the stretch, losing
its last four regular-season games.
Washington secured the final spot in
exactly the opposite way, limping out
to a 3-6 start before winning its last
three regular-season games to sneak
into a bowl.
The first Pac-10 team to partici
pate in its bowl was Arizona, which
took on Oklahoma State in the
Alamo Bowl. The Wildcats came in as
underdogs due to their season-end
ing four-game losing streak and Okla
homa State's 10-2 record. Both teams
entered with explosive passing
games, and many predicted a back
and-forth duel between quarterbacks
Brandon Weeden and Nick Foles.
Neither quarterback responded with
a strong performance. Weeden threw
for only 240 yards, his second-lowest
total of the season, while Foles threw
three interceptions after throwing no
more than one in his last 16 games.
The ground attacks were even more
pitiful, as neither team reached 100
yards rushing. With such poor offen
sive play, the game came down to de
fense, and the Cowboy defense made
far more plays. Oklahoma State
forced four turnovers while Arizona
forced none, and this made the differ
ence in a 36-10 rout by the Cowboys.
Next up was Washington, who
many expected to fare even worse
than Arizona, and for good reason.

underdog to Nebraska in the Holiday

was touted as one of the better games
of the bowl season, as both teams
came into the game on a roll. Virginia

season to Boise State and James

nalists, explosive offenses and ques
tionable defenses. All the buzz fo
cused on an offensive thriller, but the
title game proved to be anything but.
While neither team could pull ahead
by more than one score, neither of
fense enjoyed anything close to the
success it had all season. Both quar
terbacks were sloppy, as Darron
Thomas and Heisman winner Cam
Newton committed two turnovers
apiece.
Thomas bounced back from some
questionable decisions on zone reads
to pass for a career-high 363 yards.
The Ducks needed this passing at
tack, though, because their normally
electric rushing game was shut down
by Auburn's defense, tallying only 75
yards. Running back LaMichael
James, who was a Heisman finalist
and the nation's leading rusher, man
aged only 49 rushing yards and was
limited due to injury.
Meanwhile, Auburn had bursts of

offense followed by long stretches of
stagnation. The Tigers were very suc
cessful on the ground, racking up 254
yards, while Newton passed for 265.
Despite all this yardage, Auburn's
lead was only 19-11 with a few min
utes to play. While trying to run out
the clock, Oregon linebacker Casey
Matthews knocked the ball out of
Newton's hand from behind, and cor
nerback Cliff Harris fell on the ball.
The Duck offense, which had not
scored for over 35 game minutes, re
sponded with a crucial touchdown
drive to bring the score to 19-17. On
the two-point conversion attempt,
Thomas rolled in the pocket and
found receiver Jeff Maehl open in the
back of the end zone to tie the game
with 2:33 to play.
The Tigers got the ball back on
their own 25-yard line looking for a
final drive to win the game. After a
15-yard pass brought Auburn near
midfield, the Tigers benefited from
one of the craziest plays in title-game
history. Running back Michael Dyer
took the handoff and ran for a rou
tine gain of about five yards before
he was wrestled down by defensive
back Eddie Pleasant. As Dyer got up
and walked toward the sideline, his
coaches screamed at him to keep
running because his knee had never
touched the ground. Both teams had
completely stopped, but the refs did
not blow the whistle, so Dyer contin
ued running all the way to Oregon's
23-yard line. The play was upheld by
replay, and the damage was done.
Following another Dyer run that
nearly got in the end zone, Auburn
set up for the game-winning chip
shot field goal, which kicker Wes
Byrum knocked straight through to
give the Tigers the 22-19 win and
their first national championship
since 1957.
In total, Pac-10 teams went 2-2 in
bowl games, which is fairly success
ful considering three of the four
teams were underdogs. Arizona
played poorly, but this was expected
after a terrible end to the season.
Washington surprised everyone by
dominating Nebraska in arguably
the biggest shocker of the entire
bowl season. Stanford took an ap
parent nail-biter and made it into a
rout that validated its season. Ore
gon lost a very tight national title
game that could very well have gone
to overtime if not for an absolute
fluke of a play. In the end, the Pac-10
joins the SEC, MAC and WAC with
.500 bowl records, but the 2010-11
season will mostly be remembered
for the Pac-10 having only four
teams go bowling, and for the per
formances of Stanford and Oregon
in BCS games.

Monday night's BCS National
Championship Game marked the
end of the 2010-11 college football
season, which turned out to be very
eventful for the Pac-lO.For one thing,
it was during this season that the ex
pansion to the Pac-12 was finalized
for next year, so it marked the final
season of the Pac-10 as we know it.
On the field, several other story
lines unfolded throughout the sea
son, starting off with the NCAA's
crackdown on USC. The Trojans lost
scholarships and could not partici
pate in a bowl game, so many college
football fans wrote off the Pac-10 as a
legitimate national title contender.
Preseason outlooks were so varied
that most pundits expected the Pac
-10 to be filled with parity in 2010-11,
leading teams to beat up on each
other enough during the conference
season to take away any shot for the
Pac-10 to figure in the national scene.
By all accounts, preseason expec
tations were wrong. While the bottom
half of the Pac-10 did cannibalize it
self, the top certainly had an impact
on the national scene. Oregon was
coming off a Rose Bowl berth and ap
peared to be a frontrunner, but the
loss of Jeremiah Masoli (a preseason
Heisman Trophy contender) in
creased doubts among media mem
bers and fans alike. Almost no one
predicted a dominant sweep of the
Pac-10 and an unbeaten regular sea
son, but that's just what the Ducks
pulled off on their way to the BCS
National Championship Game,
Possibly more surprising was the
ascension of Stanford into the coun
try's elite. The Cardinal did not even
crack either major preseason top 25
poll, and question marks cluttered
both sides of the ball. The emergence
of Stanford's running game without
departed star Toby Gerhart and the
remarkable improvement of Vic Fan
gio's defense surprised the college
football world as the Cardinal fin
ished one half away from a perfect
season.
While Oregon and Stanford en
hanced the Pac-10's reputation with
arguably the best season in each pro
gram's history, several other teams
failed to live up to preseason expecta
tions.
Chief among them was Oregon
State, who began the year ranked
third in the Pac-10 preseason poll and
24th in the AP Poll, but ended the
year with its worst record since 1997.
Early losses against TCU and Boise
State (who finished a combined 25-1)
did not raise too much alarm, but
going 1-4 down the stretch, including
losses to UCLA and Washington
State (who combined for only three
Pac-10 victories UCLA over Ore
gon State, Washington State over
Oregon State and UCLA over Wash
ington State), was the reason why the
Beavers missed a bowl game for the
first time since 2005. The loss of re
ceiver James Rodgers to a season
ending injury in early October cer
tainly did not help matters, but much
more was expected of a team that
came within one win of a Rose Bowl
berth in each of the previous two
years.
Oregon State was one of three
Pac-10 teams to miss out on a bowl
game by just one win. Arizona State
finished 6-6 but had two wins over
FCS foes and therefore did not quali
fy for a bowl.lhe Sun Devils came oh
so close to bowl eligibility, losing four
games by four points or fewer.
Blocked extra points were the differ

ence in one-point road losses to both
Wisconsin and USC, but Arizona
State ended on a strong note by
blocking two extra points themselves
in a thrilling double-overtime win
over rival Arizona to cap the season.
California also sniffed bowl eligi
bility before eventually falling just
short.The Golden Bears were among
the most inconsistent teams in the
country all season. In their first eight
games, the Bears went 4-0 at home
with an average margin of victory of
38.75 points per game and 0-4 on the
road with an average margin of de
feat of 21 points per game, Cal finally
broke the trend with a win at Wash
ington State to get to 5-4 overall, but
the new trend could not be stopped
either, as Cal lost its final three games
at home.
USC was a bit of an enigma com
ing into the season, filled with talent
but crippled by NCAA sanctions. The
Trojans continued to be an enigma,
following up a 4-0 start with a disap
pointing effort at home against Wash
ington. USC rebounded with a near
win at Stanford and a blowout victory
over Cal. Following a respectable loss
to Oregon, the Trojans swept the Ari
zona schools before laying a massive
egg against Oregon State. A head
scratching home loss to Notre Dame
and a win over rival UCLA finished
off an up-and-down 8-5 season.
Only two teams UCLA and
Washington State did not ap
proach bowl eligibility, although each
had its own highlights: the Bruins won
convincingly at Texas and the
Cougars broke their Pac-10 losing
streak with a road win over Oregon
State.
Heading into bowl season, the
Pac-10 only managed four bowl
berths (not including USC, which had
enough wins but was ineligible). Ore
gon and Stanford secured spots in
BCS bowl games due to rankings of
No. 2 and No. 4, respectively, in the
final BCS standings. Arizona clinched
bowl eligibility early with a 7-1 start
but stumbled down the stretch, losing
its last four regular-season games.
Washington secured the final spot in
exactly the opposite way, limping out
to a 3-6 start before winning its last
three regular-season games to sneak
into a bowl.
The first Pac-10 team to partici
pate in its bowl was Arizona, which
took on Oklahoma State in the
Alamo Bowl. The Wildcats came in as
underdogs due to their season-end
ing four-game losing streak and Okla
homa State's 10-2 record. Both teams
entered with explosive passing
games, and many predicted a back
and-forth duel between quarterbacks
Brandon Weeden and Nick Foles.
Neither quarterback responded with
a strong performance. Weeden threw
for only 240 yards, his second-lowest
total of the season, while Foles threw
three interceptions after throwing no
more than one in his last 16 games.
The ground attacks were even more
pitiful, as neither team reached 100
yards rushing. With such poor offen
sive play, the game came down to de
fense, and the Cowboy defense made
far more plays. Oklahoma State
forced four turnovers while Arizona
forced none, and this made the differ
ence in a 36-10 rout by the Cowboys.
Next up was Washington, who
many expected to fare even worse
than Arizona, and for good reason.
The Huskies were a two-touchdown
underdog to Nebraska in the Holiday
Bowl after getting blown out by the
Cornhuskers in Seattle earlier in the

year. The questions heading into the
game were whether anything had
changed since Nebraska won 56-21 in
September and whether Nebraska
would be motivated for the rematch.
Both these questions were answered
early on, as Washington took control
immediately and never looked back.
Quarterback Jake Locker hardly im
proved from his 4-for-20 perform
ance in September, completing only
five of his 16 passes for 56 yards. The
keys for the Huskies were the run
ning game and defense, which both
performed as well as they had all sea
son. Running back Chris Polk and
Locker combined for 260 yards on 47
carries, while Nebraska's potent
rushing attack was held to 91 yards
on 41 carries. The Cornhuskers
looked flat all game, and the Huskies
capitalized with a 19-7 win.
Stanford took the field next in the
Orange Bowl against Virginia Tech.
The Hokies were making their third
Orange Bowl appearance in four
years, while the Cardinal was making
its debut in the game. The matchup
was touted as one of the better games
of the bowl season, as both teams
came into the game on a roll. Virginia
Tech had lost its first two games of the
season to Boise State and James
Madison, but responded with 11
straight wins and an ACC title. Stan
ford had already set a school record
with 11 wins and was looking to win a
bowl game for the first time since
1996. The highly anticipated quarter
back battle between redshirt sopho
more Andrew Luck and Tyrod Taylor
started in favor of Taylor, who made
all the highlight reels with a remark
ably athletic touchdown throw to
running back David Wilson to give
the Hokies their first lead at 9-7. It
proved to be their only lead of the
game, though, as Stanford came out
inspired in the second half, putting
the game away on both sides of the
ball. Luck was particularly impres
sive, completing nine of his 10 sec
ond-half passes for 201 yards and
three touchdowns, all to junior tight
end Coby Fleener. The Cardinal de
fense was stifling, holding Virginia
Tech scoreless in the half as Stanford
cruised to the 40-12 win.
The final bowl game featuring a
Pac-10 team was also the biggest one
of all the BCS National Champi
onship Game between Oregon and
Auburn. Both teams came in with un
defeated records, Heisman Trophy fi
nalists, explosive offenses and ques
tionable defenses. All the buzz fo
cused on an offensive thriller, but the
title game proved to be anything but.
