## A
						YEAR IN REVIEW Looking back at the football season that was in the final chapter of the Pac-10 conference 
### JACOB JAFFE DEPUTY EDITOR 
Monday night's BCS National
Championship Game marked the
end of the 2010-11 college football
season, which turned out to be very
eventful for the Pac-lO.For one thing,
it was during this season that the ex
pansion to the Pac-12 was finalized
for next year, so it marked the final
season of the Pac-10 as we know it.
On the field, several other story
lines unfolded throughout the sea
son, starting off with the NCAA's
crackdown on USC. The Trojans lost
scholarships and could not partici
pate in a bowl game, so many college
football fans wrote off the Pac-10 as a
legitimate national title contender.
Preseason outlooks were so varied
that most pundits expected the Pac
-10 to be filled with parity in 2010-11,
leading teams to beat up on each
other enough during the conference
season to take away any shot for the
Pac-10 to figure in the national scene.
By all accounts, preseason expec
tations were wrong. While the bottom
half of the Pac-10 did cannibalize it
self, the top certainly had an impact
on the national scene. Oregon was
coming off a Rose Bowl berth and ap
peared to be a frontrunner, but the
loss of Jeremiah Masoli (a preseason
Heisman Trophy contender) in
creased doubts among media mem
bers and fans alike. Almost no one
predicted a dominant sweep of the
Pac-10 and an unbeaten regular sea
son, but that's just what the Ducks
pulled off on their way to the BCS
National Championship Game,
Possibly more surprising was the
ascension of Stanford into the coun
try's elite. The Cardinal did not even
crack either major preseason top 25
poll, and question marks cluttered
both sides of the ball. The emergence
of Stanford's running game without
departed star Toby Gerhart and the
remarkable improvement of Vic Fan
gio's defense surprised the college
football world as the Cardinal fin
ished one half away from a perfect
season.
While Oregon and Stanford en
hanced the Pac-10's reputation with
arguably the best season in each pro
gram's history, several other teams
failed to live up to preseason expecta
tions.
Chief among them was Oregon
State, who began the year ranked
third in the Pac-10 preseason poll and
24th in the AP Poll, but ended the
year with its worst record since 1997.
Early losses against TCU and Boise
State (who finished a combined 25-1)
did not raise too much alarm, but
going 1-4 down the stretch, including
losses to UCLA and Washington
State (who combined for only three
Pac-10 victories UCLA over Ore
gon State, Washington State over
Oregon State and UCLA over Wash
ington State), was the reason why the
Beavers missed a bowl game for the
first time since 2005. The loss of re
ceiver James Rodgers to a season
ending injury in early October cer
tainly did not help matters, but much
more was expected of a team that
came within one win of a Rose Bowl
berth in each of the previous two
years.
Oregon State was one of three
Pac-10 teams to miss out on a bowl
game by just one win. Arizona State
finished 6-6 but had two wins over
FCS foes and therefore did not quali
fy for a bowl.lhe Sun Devils came oh
so close to bowl eligibility, losing four
games by four points or fewer.
Blocked extra points were the differ

ence in one-point road losses to both
Wisconsin and USC, but Arizona
State ended on a strong note by
blocking two extra points themselves
in a thrilling double-overtime win
over rival Arizona to cap the season.
California also sniffed bowl eligi
bility before eventually falling just
short.The Golden Bears were among
the most inconsistent teams in the
country all season. In their first eight
games, the Bears went 4-0 at home
with an average margin of victory of
38.75 points per game and 0-4 on the
road with an average margin of de
feat of 21 points per game, Cal finally
broke the trend with a win at Wash
ington State to get to 5-4 overall, but
the new trend could not be stopped
either, as Cal lost its final three games
at home.
USC was a bit of an enigma com
ing into the season, filled with talent
but crippled by NCAA sanctions. The
Trojans continued to be an enigma,
following up a 4-0 start with a disap
pointing effort at home against Wash
ington. USC rebounded with a near
win at Stanford and a blowout victory
over Cal. Following a respectable loss
to Oregon, the Trojans swept the Ari
zona schools before laying a massive
egg against Oregon State. A head
scratching home loss to Notre Dame
and a win over rival UCLA finished
off an up-and-down 8-5 season.
Only two teams UCLA and
Washington State did not ap
proach bowl eligibility, although each
had its own highlights: the Bruins won
convincingly at Texas and the
Cougars broke their Pac-10 losing
streak with a road win over Oregon
State.
Heading into bowl season, the
Pac-10 only managed four bowl
berths (not including USC, which had
enough wins but was ineligible). Ore
gon and Stanford secured spots in
BCS bowl games due to rankings of
No. 2 and No. 4, respectively, in the
final BCS standings. Arizona clinched
bowl eligibility early with a 7-1 start
but stumbled down the stretch, losing
its last four regular-season games.
Washington secured the final spot in
exactly the opposite way, limping out
to a 3-6 start before winning its last
three regular-season games to sneak
into a bowl.
The first Pac-10 team to partici
pate in its bowl was Arizona, which
took on Oklahoma State in the
Alamo Bowl. The Wildcats came in as
underdogs due to their season-end
ing four-game losing streak and Okla
homa State's 10-2 record. Both teams
entered with explosive passing
games, and many predicted a back
and-forth duel between quarterbacks
Brandon Weeden and Nick Foles.
Neither quarterback responded with
a strong performance. Weeden threw
for only 240 yards, his second-lowest
total of the season, while Foles threw
three interceptions after throwing no
more than one in his last 16 games.
The ground attacks were even more
pitiful, as neither team reached 100
yards rushing. With such poor offen
sive play, the game came down to de
fense, and the Cowboy defense made
far more plays. Oklahoma State
forced four turnovers while Arizona
forced none, and this made the differ
ence in a 36-10 rout by the Cowboys.
Next up was Washington, who
many expected to fare even worse
than Arizona, and for good reason.
