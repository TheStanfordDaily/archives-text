# NFL should revise Rooney Rule
##

The Jim Harbaugh hiring process told all of us a
lot of things last week. We learned that hype and
star power could translate into contract offers
of between $7 and $8 million per year for

a coach unproven at the NFL level.
We also discovered that Stanford's administra
tors really, really like having a good football
team so much so that they were willing to
pony up $5 million per year before bonuses to
keep Harbaugh around. For those of you keep
ing score at home, that figure would have made
Flarbaugh the second-highest-paid coach in all of
college football, just $lOO,OOO shy of Texas' Mack
Brown.

For this writer, though, the main lesson to come
out of I larbaugh's hiring is that the NFL needs to
take a good, hard look at its Rooney Rule, The rule,
which stipulates that any team with a head-coaching
vacancy must interview at least one minority candi
date, ended the week with its reputation in tatters.
The San Francisco 49ers,the team that eventu
ally hired Flarbaugh, made sure to conduct a
token interview with Raiders offensive coordi
nator Hue Jackson before they initiated discus
sions with the Stanford coach. At the time,
everyone knew that Harbaugh was San Fran
cisco's top target, so it was obvious that the
Jackson interview was designed solely to com
ply with the Rooney Rule.
Another controversy emerged surrounding
the Miami Dolphins' courtship of Harbaugh, which

included their owner flying to the Bay Area to try to
persuade the coach to take his talents to South Beach.
The Fish were reportedly willing to make Flarbaugh the
NFL's highest-paid coach, but per the Rooney Rule, the
team could not offer a contract to Harbaugh prior to
flying to San Francisco, owner Stephen Ross had not in
terviewed a minority candidate. In this case again, the
Rooney Rule was clearly a sham; the Dolphins wanted
Harbaugh and interviewing anyone else would have been
a waste of both the team's and the candidate's time.

Indeed, had the Dolphins offered Harbaugh a contract
last week (regardless of whether or not he accepted), they
would have been severely penalized by the league for non
compliance with the rule. It was later determined that the
team did not make a contract offer, and thus did not run
foul of the NFL.

Current Vikings head coach Leslie Frazier offers anoth
er example of the Rooney Rule's failings. Frazier, who is
African American, was promoted from interim to perma
nent head coach after Minnesota's season ended, but prior
to his promotion he interviewed for seven head coaching

vacancies some of those interviews were blatantly con
ducted solely to satisfy Rooney Rule requirements. Per
haps most egregious among them was his interview last
season with the Seattle Seahawks.The team clearly wanted
to hire then-USC head coach Pete Carroll, but could not
bring him in until it had interviewed a credible minority
candidate.
So what's the solution to the Rooney Rule dilemma? Its
proponents point to these token interviews as a necessary
evil, and that the league has seen a proliferation of minori
ty head and assistant coaches since its initial implementa
tion. It is true that the NFL coaching ranks have seen more



SERENITY NGUYEN/The Stanford Daily
minorities in recent years, but it's im
possible to trace this increase solely to
the Rooney Rule's influence. Howev
er, it's not implausible to suggest that
it has had a net positive influence in
giving more access to minority coach
es to break into NFL coaching circles.
Because of those improvements, I
do not advocate scrapping the
Rooney Rule altogether. Rather, I
think a simple modification could
preserve the positive effects of the
rule while eliminating the embarrass
ing token interviews that teams and
assistant coaches are required to go
through: teams can go after a single
candidate without having to inter
view a minority coach.
In Harbaugh's case, he was the
clear-cut top choice for the 49ers; they
wanted him and him only, and there's
no reason to believe that they would
have interviewed anyone else in their
hiring process. This would also apply

to promoting interim coaches to full
time head coaches; this offseason pro
vided an interesting example, where
the Vikings did not have to interview
anyone else before promoting Frazier
to head coach, but the Dallas Cow
boys had to interview a minority can
didate even though they just wanted
to promote interim coach Jason Gar
rett to the top job.
However, if a team interviews two
or more candidates, then one of them
must be a minority. With no clear
front-runner, a minority candidate
would have a credible chance at being
hired and a fair shake at making his
case to the owner. There are plenty of
talented minority coaches in the NFL,
and this system would fulfill the origi
nal intent of the rule to give these
coaches equal opportunities and ac
cess to high-level positions with
out forcing us to go through inter
views that everyone knows will not
result in a hire.
