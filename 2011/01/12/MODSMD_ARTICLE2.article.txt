## Professor to join state ed board today Speaks with Daily about policy career; funding outlook 
### KURT CHIRBAS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Michael Kirst, professor emeritus
of education and business administra
tion, begins his term as a member of
the California State Board of Educa
tion today. Appointed by Gov. Jerry
Brown last Wednesday, Kirst returns to
a post he held once before, from 1975
to 1982. Before taking the oath of of
fice, he spoke with The Daily by phone
to discuss his views on state education
policy. An edited excerpt is below.
Stanford Daily (SD): What made
you decide to return to the Board of
Education?
Michael Kirst (MK): I just felt,
when I reflected on my whole
career...that the thing I enjoyed the
most was actually having a position in
government where you could be part
of a group that made decisions that re
ally made a difference for children.
It's one thing to be out there writing
about it, doing research and consulting.
You are always trying to influence the
policymakers. But I found I enjoyed
being the policymaker more than just
advising them.

Professor emeritus of education
Michael Kirst returns to the California
State Board of Education, where he last
served three decades ago. Kirst's early
work specialized in K-12 education.
SD: You last served on the State
Board of Education from 1975 to
1982. How has Board of Education
changed since then?
MK: The state board won a law
suit against a separately elected
state superintendent [since the last
time I served], so now, it has much
greater power to influence how fed
eral funds are spent. It has more au
thority, and it is quite different in
terms of its scope of influence than
when I was there before. The board
is sort of like a new entity in terms
of what it can do.
Moreover, the governor abol
ished a position in the governor's
office that had existed for years
called the secretary of education
and said he wanted to make educa
tion policy primarily through the
State Board of Education. The
board will have a much closer rela
tionship to the governor then it has
had in the past because there's no
longer an intermediate group be
tween the governor and us.
SD: How about state policy on
education in general?
MK:The biggest change is that
back in those days we didn't have
outcome-based assessment on stu
dents. Our focus was on ensuring
that students got services for ex
ample, assisting students with hand
icaps or who didn't speak English.
But we had no way to assess
whether those pupils were actually
learning anything from those serv
ices. All of a sudden, education is
now heavily about pupil outcome,

more so than just providing a serv
ice. That has led to a big change.
A second change is that we did
not understand as much about how
to help teachers in the classroom.
We settled for just doing policy that
affected school districts rather than
individual schools and classrooms.
The board now has a much greater
ability to influence positively the in
struction in classroom.
A third would be charter
schools. California has over a thou
sand of them. These are schools that
are public schools, and that are
chartered by a local school district
or a county or a state, but are re
lieved from regulations that most
other traditional public schools
have. They have been an alternative
school model, and the board has
quite a bit of authority in terms of
setting regulations and closing
down ones that aren't very effective
in terms of assessments.
Another change is that funding
has dropped enormously in terms
of per pupil expenditures. When I
was on the state board, we were
about 20th in the country in spend

ing per pupil, and now, we are
roughly about 46th. New York and
New Jersey spend nearly twice as
much per pupil than we do, for ex
ample. It's really a constrained
budget period.
We have to figure out how to
make schools better in that setting,
and it's a bigger challenge than any
thing we faced from 1975 to 1982.
SD: How do you think the State
Board of Education will continue
its past goals of reducing the
achievement gap and increasing the
number of high school graduates,
especially in light of year after year
of budget cuts?
MK: I think education really
takes place in classrooms with
teachers. What we are going to be
doing, or try to do, I should say, is
provide our teachers with better
curriculum, improved instructional
materials and better assessments
for them to work with.
It's really about improving class
room instruction, and one of the
things that has happened recently is
that 40 states have adopted com
mon core standards in English, lan
guage arts and mathematics.
All of a sudden we are going to
be getting a lot of help from nation
al movements not the federal
government necessarily, but nation
al movements where 40 states are
going to have similar curriculum
standards and assessments. We can
use some of these national re
sources to help us in California.
In other words, education is be
coming a much more nationwide
movement, and you don't have to
do everything on your own and
fund it the way we used to.
