## Professor to join state ed board today Speaks with Daily about policy career; funding outlook 
### KURT CHIRBAS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Michael Kirst, professor emeritus
of education and business administra
tion, begins his term as a member of
the California State Board of Educa
tion today. Appointed by Gov. Jerry
Brown last Wednesday, Kirst returns to
a post he held once before, from 1975
to 1982. Before taking the oath of of
fice, he spoke with The Daily by phone
to discuss his views on state education
policy. An edited excerpt is below.
Stanford Daily (SD): What made
you decide to return to the Board of
Education?
Michael Kirst (MK): I just felt,
when I reflected on my whole
career...that the thing I enjoyed the
most was actually having a position in
government where you could be part
of a group that made decisions that re
ally made a difference for children.
It's one thing to be out there writing
about it, doing research and consulting.
You are always trying to influence the
policymakers. But I found I enjoyed
being the policymaker more than just
advising them.
