# CAMPUS DEBATES ROTC
## Students discuss discrimination, military-civilian divide at ROTC town hall 
### KATE ABBOTT SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
More than 50 people attended a town hall
meeting at Stanford on Tuesday night to de
bate the possible return of ROTC to campus,
the largest such gathering since the Faculty
Senate opened the question last spring.
Members of the Senate's ad hoc committee
investigating the matter, ROTC cadets and
other student-group representatives attended
the event, which ASSU helped organize.
Sam Windley, a law student and president of
Stanford Says to No War, opened discussion by
presenting the group's two main arguments
against the return of the military program to
Stanford: that ROTC defies the right to free ac
ademic exploration and that the program vio
lates Stanford's anti-discrimination policy.
Some students and committee members
saw the recently repealed "don't ask, don't
tell" policy as contrary to Stanford's principles
and considered it a barrier to the program's re
turn. Now, some students argue ROTC on cam
pus would still violate Stanford's nondiscrimi
nation policy by prohibiting transgender stu
dents from participating.
"I think it is egregious for us to be sitting
here to be discussing the philosophy of ROTC

when it is antithetical to Stanford's nondis
crimination clause," said Alok Vaid-Menon 'l3,
president of Stanford Students for Queer Lib
eration (SSQL).
Psychology professor Ewart Thomas, the
committee chair, told The Daily after the event
that discrimination against transgender people
was an issue on which he felt "vulnerable." Fie
said the debate gave the committee more in
formation to consider.
Lindsay Funk 'l3 echoed concerns about
continuing discrimination.
"The University has brought groups in line
on religious issues with the non-discrimination
policy," she added. "It seems to be making ex
ceptions for the military."
Proponents for the return of ROTC to cam
pus cited a growing military-civilian divide.
Some said an ROTC presence on campus
would encourage dialogue and education
about the military, steer more Stanford-edu
cated people toward military leadership and
maybe even effect change regarding the mili
tary's transgender policy.
Samora Garling 'l2 said ROTC should be
allowed to return to campus, regardless of neg
ative feelings toward the program.
"This is the same campus that allowed the
Westboro Church to come here for a day," he

said, referring to the radical group's stop on
campus last February. "I don't necessarily
agree with every group on this campus or what
they stand for, but they definitely all have a
place here."
The University removed ROTC programs
from campus in the late 1960s and early 1970s
following concerns about their academic cred
ibility, a subject sporadically discussed
throughout the evening. Program supporters
said if military-science courses required for
ROTC cadets were held on campus, they
would be open to all Stanford students.
Imani Franklin 'l3, a committee member,
asked current ROTC cadets whether they
would feel uncomfortable on campus if the
program returned while part of the community
continued to oppose it.
"One of the reasons I came to Stanford was
to try to expose myself as an undergraduate to
other majors," said Jimmy Ruck 'll, who is a
cadet in the Army ROTC program.
"The military is missing out on getting influ
ence from Stanford," he added, "because it
goes both ways not only am I exposed to
students [unaware of the military], they're also
exposed to me. Some people are ignorant, and

ROTC cadets, former service members and students opposing the program's possible return to Stanford discuss the topic at a town hall on Tuesday. The
Faculty Senate committee considering ROTC's return hosted the event, which more than 50 people attended. Faculty are set to discuss the issue Thursday.
I see myself educating them on
what ROTC does."
"I'm not dissatisfied with
tonight," Windley said after the
event. "There's a really strong case
for the military as an occupational
choice, and it's good for Stanford
students to do. But how Stanford
University treats different occupa
tional choices is the issue."
Thomas said that overall, the
debate was "beautiful."
David Spiegel, psychiatry pro
fessor and chair of the Eaculty Sen
ate, praised the level of discourse,
saying that in his 35 years on the
faculty, "I've never been more
proud."
A faculty and staff discussion
with the committee about ROTC is
set for Thursday at 4 p.m. in Encina.
