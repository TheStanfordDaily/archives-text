## Profs weigh in on controversial paper 
### MARIANNE LeVINE STAFF WRITER 
Few scientific studies have
drawn the level of criticism
from the blogosphere and in
ternational scientific communi
ty lately as a study by scientists
at the Stanford Synchrotron
Radiation Lightsource (SSRL)
a division of the SLAC Na
tional Accelerator Laboratory
(SLAC) and astrobiologists
at NASA last month.
The paper, titled "Bacterium
that can grow using arsenic in
stead of phosphorus," claims to
have found a bacterium strain
in California's Mono Lake
"which substitutes arsenic for
phosphorus to sustain its
growth."To many readers, it im
plied that the bacterium strain,
GFAJ-1 of the bacterium
Llalomonadacae, evolved in

such away that it was able to re
place phosphorus in the bacte
ria's cellular material.
News of the finding first
splashed across headlines be
cause the discovery of such an
organism suggested to some
that the possibility that other
forms of life can exist in the ex
treme conditions of other plan
ets, where the molecules we hu
mans need to survive aren't
available. The newsprint hardly
had time to dry, however, be
fore heavy criticism from blog
gers and renowned scientists,
who said evidence for the
paper's conclusion is insuffi
cient, started rolling in.
Several Stanford re
searchers expressed skepticism
about whether these bacteria
had used arsenic to build their
