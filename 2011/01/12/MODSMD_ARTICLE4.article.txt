## Profs weigh in on controversial paper 
### MARIANNE LeVINE STAFF WRITER 
Few scientific studies have
drawn the level of criticism
from the blogosphere and in
ternational scientific communi
ty lately as a study by scientists
at the Stanford Synchrotron
Radiation Lightsource (SSRL)
a division of the SLAC Na
tional Accelerator Laboratory
(SLAC) and astrobiologists
at NASA last month.
The paper, titled "Bacterium
that can grow using arsenic in
stead of phosphorus," claims to
have found a bacterium strain
in California's Mono Lake
"which substitutes arsenic for
phosphorus to sustain its
growth."To many readers, it im
plied that the bacterium strain,
GFAJ-1 of the bacterium
Llalomonadacae, evolved in

such away that it was able to re
place phosphorus in the bacte
ria's cellular material.
News of the finding first
splashed across headlines be
cause the discovery of such an
organism suggested to some
that the possibility that other
forms of life can exist in the ex
treme conditions of other plan
ets, where the molecules we hu
mans need to survive aren't
available. The newsprint hardly
had time to dry, however, be
fore heavy criticism from blog
gers and renowned scientists,
who said evidence for the
paper's conclusion is insuffi
cient, started rolling in.
Several Stanford re
searchers expressed skepticism
about whether these bacteria
had used arsenic to build their
DNA.
"There seems to be no doubt
that these bugs grow on and incor
porate a high level of arsenic,"
chemistry professor Steven Boxer
said. "The real question is whether
all phosphorus is replaced by ar
senic in these key molecules of life."
Geology professor Norm Sleep,
who has performed research in the
field of astrobiology, was more crit
ical of the study's findings.
"The conclusion that their cell
was making arsenic-based DNA is
a highly outlandish, if not impossi
ble one," Sleep said. "It's such a
major conclusion ... we need ex
tremely good evidence, and the evi
dence of the paper falls short of this
criteria."
Sleep believes the study did not
merit the type of press attention it
received.
"The paper claimed that the mi
crobe from Mono Lake could live
by putting arsenic for phosphorus
in its DNA ... the press went way
beyond this," he said. "The microbe
is closely related to ... ancestor mi
crobes that live in arsenic-poor en
vironments; it is not a second inde
pendent form of life on Earth."
According to Sleep, the research
merely showed that the organism
was able to tolerate extreme
amounts of arsenic and could sur
vive in a phosphorus-poor environ
ment.
There are 10 complicated steps
involved for the cell to make DNA,
Sleep added.
"The chemistry has evolved to
make ordinary phosphorus DNA,
not arsenic DNA," he said. "The
[arsenic-DNA] made in the labora
tory are unstable ... so it is highly
unlikely that arsenic-DNA could
be made in any quantity," he wrote
in an e-mail to The Daily.
Sleep added that since the steps
involved in the process of making
DNA are so intricate, it would be
"very improbable" to change one
aspect of the cell without changing
many others.
Tlie study's researchers have re
sponded to criticism by putting to
gether a collection of frequently
asked questions in order to clarify
the data and procedures that were
involved.

"We are actively engaged in re
sponding to formal questions sub
mitted to Science magazine," said
Sam Webb, an SSRL staff scientist,
who led the research at the Depart
ment of Energy's SLAC National
Accelerator Laboratory, in an e
mail to The Daily.
"Our manuscript was thorough
ly reviewed and accepted for publi
cation by Science," he said. "We
presented our data and drew our
conclusions based on what we
showed. But we welcome lively de
bate since we recognize that schol
arly discourse moves science for
ward."
