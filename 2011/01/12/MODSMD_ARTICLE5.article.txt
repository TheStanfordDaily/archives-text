### IVY NGUYEN DESK EDITOR 
The number of resident assistant

ing the deadline to winter from
spring might adversely affect appli
cant numbers.
Applications jumped to 324 peo
ple for 120 RA positions during the
next school year, up from 308 appli
cations for this year's spots, accord
ing to Residential Education

Rinconada resident assistants help move freshmen in during NSO 2010. This year,
students applying to RA positions must complete the application process much
earlier than in past years. Hiring decisions will be announced mid-March.
(ResEd) dean Jennifer Calvert in an
e-mail to Row management.
The increase came in spite of the
fact that the application deadline
was moved forward to the begin
ning of winter quarter, a change that
some criticized because they felt it
limited students' options by asking
them to make their future housing
decisions too early in the school
year.
Though this increase is within
the normal range of year-to-year
fluctuations, the fact that the num
bers remained this high came as a
pleasant surprise for Calvert.
"We are very enthusiastic about
the increase in RA applications this
year," Calvert said. "With the signifi
cant changes to the selection process
and in asking students to apply earli
er, it would have been reasonable to
expect a slight decline. We are thrilled
that this many students are interested
in being an RA."
Some students still expressed
frustration with the earlier deadline.
"It almost made me not apply
because it was so early, because I
thought I didn't have time," George

Tsiveriotis 'l3 said. "I started really
late and I was also really anxious
about getting all [my] recommenda
tion letters in."
Thankfully, Tsiveriotis said,
ResEd extended the deadline for
submitting recommendation letters.
"Otherwise, I didn't know if I
would've gotten them in on time,"
he said.
College assistant (CA) Ruthie
Arbeiter 'l2, who performs RA du
ties in Freshman-Sophomore Col
lege, said she was concerned about
the effect the new deadline would
have on prospective sophomore ap
plicants.
"Our main concern with moving
the deadline earlier [was that] soph
omores wouldn't know if they were
ready yet, because they've only
been at Stanford for a year and a
quarter," she said.
Arbeiter did not reapply for a
position because she will be going
abroad, but she said the new dead
line did not have a great effect on
some of her peers.
"They weren't really worried
about the new deadline because, as
current juniors, they were already
planning to apply for their senior
year," she said.
In addition to relying on resident
fellows to distribute information
about the application, Calvert said

this was the first year that ResEd
created a "comprehensive, cohesive
marketing campaign." Calvert also
credits current house staffs in re
cruiting applicants.
"Most of our candidates apply
because someone they know and
trust in a leadership position in a
house encouraged them to apply,"
Calvert said.
These good relationships with
current and past house staffs are
reasons many students cited for ap
plying. Tsiveriotis was one such stu
dent.
"I applied because I felt my RAs
made my freshman experience a lot
better," Tsiveriotis said. He also
cited his involvement in last year's
Admit Weekend in helping him
warm up to the idea of becoming an
RA.
"I like the idea of being the first
person to welcome someone to
Stanford," he said. The ap
plication process will continue
through the quarter as applicants in
terview with their prospective hous
es and will culminate in a decision in
mid-March. Applications for other
house staff positions will open Jan.
