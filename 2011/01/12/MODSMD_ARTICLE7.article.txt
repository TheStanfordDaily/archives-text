## Senate may reverse 2010 special fees bill 
### MARGARET RAWSON DESK EDITOR 
At its second meeting of the
quarter Tuesday, the ASSU Un
dergraduate Senate discussed
reversing a special fees policy
enacted by last year's Senate.
The Senate is set to vote on the
special fees bill next week, along
Constitutional Council and judi
cial panel pool nominees.
As approved by the 11th Un
dergraduate Senate in a January
2010 bill, if student groups that
have previously received special
fees wish to increase their budg
ets by more than the inflation
rate approximately 3 percent
they must undergo the formal
process of petitioning the stu
dent body for their budget to be
present on the special fees bal
lot.
Though the widely debated
bill passed last year with nine
senators in favor, four opposed
and two abstaining, some sena
tors took objection to the nature
of the vote, having misunder
stood the voting process. In the
following weeks, the bill contin
ued to raise protest with student
groups.
The bill currently before the
Senate would directly reverse
last year's ruling and allow stu
dent groups to grow their budg
ets by 10 percent without peti
tioning, returning the ASSU
joint bylaws to their old lan
guage.
The bill's authors, Appropria
tions Committee chair Rafael
Vasquez 'l2, Senate chair
Michael Cruz 'l2 and Senator
Ben Jensen 'l2, pointed to an in
crease in petitions during the last
election cycle as a reason to de
crease the burden on student
groups and individual students
to sign petitions.
"People got really annoyed
being bombarded with e-mails,"
Jensen said.
Senators, including Rebecca
Sachs 'l3, expressed concern
that the bill might pass before
new regulations are created to
encourage responsible spending
by student groups. Sachs noted,
however, that she supports the
bill in theory, arguing that the
current cap "inhibits new ideas."

Information sessions for stu
dent groups seeking special fees
will be held Jan. 31, Feb. 3 and
Feb. 4, said elections commis
sioner Stephen Trusheim *l3
when he briefed the senators
Tuesday on the timetable of the
upcoming spring elections.
These approaching information
sessions, noted Vasquez and Sen
ator Will Seaton 'l3, might pres
sure the Senate to pass a bill be
fore regulations are in place,
though Vasquez said he believes
regulations will follow regard
less.
The election itself will take
place April 7 and 8 and the Sen
ate is set to vote on the special
fees policy reversal next week.
During a brief discussion
about elections policies, Sachs
asked Trusheim about flyer poli
cies specifically whether re
strictions on flyers distributed
per candidate could be reinstat
ed.
"The elections commission
has no plans to wade into those
waters ... we do not currently
have plans to put that in place,"
Trusheim responded.
Also on previous notice for
next week is the ASSU executive
nomination of Brianna Pang 'l3
to the Constitutional Council.
(Pang has worked as a Daily
writer.) While originally slated
for the position, she was re
placed amid controversy along
with Oz Hasbun 'l3 and Alex
Katz 'l2. If confirmed. Pang
would replace Evan Cox, a grad
uating coterminal student in
computer science. The Senate
will also vote next Tuesday on
four nominees to the judicial
panel pool.
Other business Tuesday in
cluded discussion of Camp Any
town, an upcoming diversity and
leadership retreat targeted at
freshmen and planned by the
Advocacy Committee, Chaired
by Robin Perani 'l3 and Kamil
Saeid 'l3, the committee is also
planning to throw a Valentine's
Day party during the week lead
ing up to the holiday.
All funding bills for the
evening were passed.
