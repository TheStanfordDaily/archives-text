# OPINIONS
## LOOKING UP It's Okay to SAY It 
### Nina Chung 
// "J fey, darlin' are you
I—l here yet? .. . Oh,
A. -Ldon't tell me you're at
Y2E2. I'm at the other one."
"[laughs] I never even thought
of that one I've hardly gone
there."
"Okay, let's meet in the middle."
"Alumni Cafe?"
"Oh, yeah! .. . But if you're
going to come this way to Alumni
Cafe anyway, why not just come
over here?"
"Huh? That's so much farther
away!"
"What are you talking about?
Green Library is totally between
you and Alumni Cafe."
"OH I thought you were at
the Coupa on University Av
enue!!!"
[pause]
And then we burst out laughing.
We had missed each other's point
too many times in this one-minute
phone conversation. And this was
with a fabulous girl I'm crazy lucky
to know, whose outlook on life is
pretty much parallel to mine; we
just know each other.
But think of all of our encoun
ters with people who see the world
under a different shade of light,
whose step veers way off our own,
whose language is technically the
same as ours but operates under to
tally different rules. We have to live
in such close proximity with individ
uals who are universes away, and no
communication technology will
ever cut those distances short. I've
only lived about 20 years, with no
recollection of pagers or telegrams
or horse-transported mail, but I
dare say that one thing human his
tory has not seen develop is our
ability to truly communicate with
each other. For example, this morn
ing I met my cousin in Hong Kong
for a Skype date, and I text my dad
in Korea all the time, but I still have
quibbles with my mom about what
time she said dinner was going to
be. Simple miscommunication is
one of our lives' most humbling re
alities, a thing of beauty in itself. But
it means that a lot of our relation
ships (the ones we care enough
about) require much more effort
than we typically give.
It's as if everyone is on an is
land, connected to each other by
fantastically designed, high-tech
bridges totally sustainable and
everything. But, somehow, we for
get we have to walk the entire
length to reach the other person.
Or we completely underestimate it
and walk only halfway. That's my
visual equivalent of the ways we
abbreviate ourselves. For the sake
of speed and efficiency, we cut the
heads and tails of our stories so the
summary can fit into high-speed
virtual packages. Recall the many
times you had to retell something
from the very beginning because
the person across from you was

clueless as to your context. Our
love affair with efficiency has led to
its over-application, to the point
where acronym-version conversa
tions end too easily in misunder
standings later. And fixing misun
derstandings later is usually, ironi
cally, a huge, inefficient mess.
But the heart of the matter? We
don't even always say what we real
ly want to say. We substitute simple
statements with hints and signs and
codes wrapped in fake politeness
or pretend nonchalance. We get so
ingeniously strategic in our efforts
to avoid a face. How do silent treat
ments on Facebook even work?
And have you ever noticed how
you can read someone else's text
message aloud in 5000 ways de
pending on if you like them or not?
The indirect methods are often so
pointless. We're not just all born
different; we grow up accumulat
ing exponentially more levels of
experiences that leave every single
one of us with a unique set of rules
on how to interpret people, I'm
stating an obvious here. Neverthe
less, we forget to take care of how
we send our "messages," which can
be received in completely manipu
lated ways. "Don't they get it?" we
ask. Maybe the question should be,
"Did I actually tell them?" Because
we can't keep taking for granted
that everyone can simply read our
minds. (Thankfully.)
There's a huge difference be
tween subtlety and being frustrat
ingly uncommunicative. Subtlety
understands the other person
enough to know how he or she will
receive you. The other fears the
truth in its plainest form, sans the
superfluous make-up and jewelry.
This is why I always thanked the
guy who was brave enough to
admit what he felt about me. This is
why I quite easily cut the dating
game once it becomes an enigmat
ic mystery one. This is why I like to
clearly address friendship ambigu
ities once I've figured out where
they actually are. (Well, I really
try.)
Straight-up confrontation is
typically equated with rudeness
but doesn't that depend on the
content? Open, honest communi
cation is one of the most amazing,
conventional, old-school ways to
respect someone. I don't think a
truth like that can ever go out of
style.

Have something to say? Thankfully.

not to misinterpret you.

// "J fey, darlin' are you
I—l here yet? .. . Oh,
A. -Ldon't tell me you're at
Y2E2. I'm at the other one."
"[laughs] I never even thought
of that one I've hardly gone
there."
"Okay, let's meet in the middle."
"Alumni Cafe?"
"Oh, yeah! .. . But if you're
going to come this way to Alumni
Cafe anyway, why not just come
over here?"
"Huh? That's so much farther
away!"
"What are you talking about?
Green Library is totally between
you and Alumni Cafe."
"OH I thought you were at
the Coupa on University Av
enue!!!"
[pause]
And then we burst out laughing.
We had missed each other's point
too many times in this one-minute
phone conversation. And this was
with a fabulous girl I'm crazy lucky
to know, whose outlook on life is
pretty much parallel to mine; we
just know each other.
But think of all of our encoun
ters with people who see the world
under a different shade of light,
whose step veers way off our own,
whose language is technically the
same as ours but operates under to
tally different rules. We have to live
in such close proximity with individ
uals who are universes away, and no
communication technology will
ever cut those distances short. I've
only lived about 20 years, with no
recollection of pagers or telegrams
or horse-transported mail, but I
dare say that one thing human his
tory has not seen develop is our
ability to truly communicate with
each other. For example, this morn
ing I met my cousin in Hong Kong
for a Skype date, and I text my dad
in Korea all the time, but I still have
quibbles with my mom about what
time she said dinner was going to
be. Simple miscommunication is
one of our lives' most humbling re
alities, a thing of beauty in itself. But
it means that a lot of our relation
ships (the ones we care enough
about) require much more effort
than we typically give.
It's as if everyone is on an is
land, connected to each other by
fantastically designed, high-tech
bridges totally sustainable and
everything. But, somehow, we for
get we have to walk the entire
length to reach the other person.
Or we completely underestimate it
and walk only halfway. That's my
visual equivalent of the ways we
abbreviate ourselves. For the sake
of speed and efficiency, we cut the
heads and tails of our stories so the
summary can fit into high-speed
virtual packages. Recall the many
times you had to retell something
from the very beginning because
the person across from you was

clueless as to your context. Our
love affair with efficiency has led to
its over-application, to the point
where acronym-version conversa
tions end too easily in misunder
standings later. And fixing misun
derstandings later is usually, ironi
cally, a huge, inefficient mess.
But the heart of the matter? We
don't even always say what we real
ly want to say. We substitute simple
statements with hints and signs and
codes wrapped in fake politeness
or pretend nonchalance. We get so
ingeniously strategic in our efforts
to avoid a face. How do silent treat
ments on Facebook even work?
And have you ever noticed how
you can read someone else's text
message aloud in 5000 ways de
pending on if you like them or not?
The indirect methods are often so
pointless. We're not just all born
different; we grow up accumulat
ing exponentially more levels of
experiences that leave every single
one of us with a unique set of rules
on how to interpret people, I'm
stating an obvious here. Neverthe
less, we forget to take care of how
we send our "messages," which can
be received in completely manipu
lated ways. "Don't they get it?" we
ask. Maybe the question should be,
"Did I actually tell them?" Because
we can't keep taking for granted
that everyone can simply read our
minds. (Thankfully.)
There's a huge difference be
tween subtlety and being frustrat
ingly uncommunicative. Subtlety
understands the other person
enough to know how he or she will
receive you. The other fears the
truth in its plainest form, sans the
superfluous make-up and jewelry.
This is why I always thanked the
guy who was brave enough to
admit what he felt about me. This is
why I quite easily cut the dating
game once it becomes an enigmat
ic mystery one. This is why I like to
clearly address friendship ambigu
ities once I've figured out where
they actually are. (Well, I really
try.)
Straight-up confrontation is
typically equated with rudeness
but doesn't that depend on the
content? Open, honest communi
cation is one of the most amazing,
conventional, old-school ways to
respect someone. I don't think a
truth like that can ever go out of
style.

Have something to say? Thankfully.
