# CARDINAL CLEAN DOES THE DIRTY WORK
## Sensing niche opportunity, two sophomores start campus laundry service 
### KELSEY GEISER 
College students are notorious
for waiting to do laundry until
they are down to their last pair
of socks. To help remedy this
predicament, Bennett Siegal
'l3 and Alexandra Dorda 'l3 have taken
their own initiative to expand services
available to Stanford students.
When Siegal arrived on campus last
fall, he was upset to find that, unlike many
other universities, there was no laundry or
dry-cleaning service on campus. Over this
past summer, he started having discus
sions with Dorda, who also felt the cam
pus could use such a service. The two
began brainstorming together and even
tually launched Cardinal Clean in the
middle of fall quarter.
Siegal and Dorda covered the start-up
costs of their company, which seeks to
provide Stanford students with an afford
able, door-to-door laundry and dry clean
ing service, Dorda said.
Customers can sign up online for laun
dry service or dry cleaning for the quarter
or the entire academic year. The laundry
service is set at a fixed rate, while the dry
cleaning service is based on a deductible
points system.
The service provides a laundry bag,
which is picked up from a collection bin
outside of dorms before 1 p.m. on either
Tuesday or Friday and is returned to that
bin after 5 p.m. the next service day. Week

ly laundry service, which includes wash
ing, drying and folding, costs $549 a year
or $199 per quarter.
Before Siegal and Dorda launched
Cardinal Clean, they did research to
gauge how interested the campus would
be in their organization.
"We needed to make sure everything
was perfect so that when we started, we
would execute it well," Siegal said.
They sent an e-mail survey to several
groups and dorms on campus and re
ceived a surprising amount of interest. Of
250 people surveyed, 60 percent reported
they would want to use the dry cleaning
service, and 25 percent said they would
take part in the laundry service.
Along with confirming customer inter
est, they contacted more than a dozen
similar organizations at other universities
to gain some insight into the ins and outs
of starting a small business.
They contacted most of the laundry
services in the area and decided to use the
same commercial dry-cleaning organiza
tion that does the dry cleaning for many
area hotels.
Although funding and generating in
terest in the idea was relatively easy,
Dorda and Siegal soon discovered that
starting their own small business was
harder to do than it appeared on paper.
The number of important details began to
pile up quickly. But despite the workload,
they remained the only two partners in
the endeavor.

"We wanted it to be our own," Dorda
said.
They proceeded to get the word out on
campus about their new service bye-mail
ing lists and posting flyers. However, what
they found to be most successful in at
tracting new customers was word of
mouth.
Dorda said that there has been interest
so far because "everyone at some point
needs dry cleaning done. It is just in
evitable."
Many students who have used the serv
ice have been pleased with the process.
"Everything was done very profession
ally, and it was a very hands-off process for
me," said Casey Finch 'l3, who subscribed
to Cardinal Clean during fall quarter this
year.
Finch also enjoyed the online nature of
the service, which she said made her inter
actions convenient and efficient.
Siegal said he feels optimistic about
Cardinal Clean's performance so far and
that "room for growth is unlimited be
cause the campus is so large."
The duo said it hopes to continue to se
riously evaluate feedback from customers
and improve the service. According to
Siegal, he and Dorda are "always trying to
get feedback along the way to make sure
that the product that we are providing is
top."
