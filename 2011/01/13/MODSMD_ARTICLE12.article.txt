## EDITORIAL Tucson and the tragic implications of unfettered gun regulations 
### 
Life in America is a delicate
balance between freedom
and security. Americans un
derstand that our cherished free
dom of speech does not guarantee
us the right to yell "Fire!" in a the
atre. Likewise, our right to bear
arms should not guarantee us the
right to own automatic and semi
automatic guns.
On Jan. 8, a lone gunman shot
Rep. Gabrielle Giffords,D-Ariz.,in
the head at a "Congress on Your
Corner" event in Tucson and man
aged to shoot 22 others while firing
31 rounds of ammunition. When he
stopped to reload his weapon,
shocked and furious bystanders
wrestled him to the ground. Gif
fords is expected to live, but six oth
ers, including a 9-year-old girl, were
not as lucky. The alleged gunman,
Jared Loughner, is believed to suf
fer from mental illness, and his mo
tives will likely remain a mystery.
In the wake of this madness, the
question we need to ask is a simple
one: why was the shooter able to
fire 31 times before pausing to re
load? The answer is equally simple.
Until 2004, ammunition clips for
weapons had been limited to 10
rounds as part of a general ban on
assault weapons. When Congress
failed to renew the ban, ammo clips
like the one used by the shooter in
Tucson came onto the market and
vastly increased the killing power
of gunmen.
If the shooter had been restrict
ed to 10 bullets, the incident would
still have been a bloody affair. Gif
fords would still be in intensive
care, several others would be
wounded and one or two would
likely be dead. Many more, howev
er, would have remained un
harmed. Maybe Christina Green,

the 9-year-old victim who came to
"see how democracy works,"
would be alive today.
Advocates of assault-weapon
ownership claim that they make us
safer, but events of last Saturday
suggest otherwise. No heroic as
sault-rifle owners came to the res
cue; everyone just ran frantically
until the shooter's ammunition was
spent, whereupon he was swiftly dis
armed. The appropriate policy re
sponse to this situation is to limit the
number of bullets that can be fired
without reloading. This means a ban
on high-capacity magazines and as
sault weapons in general. This type
of ban would not interfere with
hunting and it would not interfere
with self-defense unless an unlucky
gun owner happened to be beset by
dozens of armed assailants.
The right to gun ownership is
under no threat from any branch of
government or either political
party. Even Gabrielle Giffords, the
congresswoman targeted in the at
tack, boasted a weapon similar to
the one wielded by her attacker. At
issue now is whether or not we
want to place an outer limit on the
destructive capacity of firearms. We
support legislation recently intro
duced by Rep. Carolyn McCarthy,
D-N.Y., to re-establish the ban on
high-capacity magazines. This bill,
and any broader measure to curtail
the sale of automatic weapons,
seems unlikely to win support from
Republicans in Congress. Hopeful
ly it will generate the kind of debate
and soul-searching that will make it
a priority in years to come. To do
otherwise, the editorial board be
lieves, is to only increase the chance
that we will once again suffer
through an event similar to the
tragedy in Tucson.
