## Do You Support Music? 
### Lucas Will Johnson 
Where do you listen to
music? Probably not just
at concerts it's hard to
escape a set of speakers in a regular
day, pumping out tunes in your
dorm room, in a store, on a set of
headphones, in your car, etc. We
enjoy the work of musicians all the
time, so how exactly do we support
them?

It's gratifying to artists when
people listen to their work, which
could be considered one form of
support. Sure, musicians play music
because they like to, but rarely do
they perform like hermits. Music is
a social language; we play for each
other. So ignoring financial con
cerns, it seems like society supports
music a lot, with our mp3 players
blasting songs all over the place.
Although, what classes or locali
ties of music does society support
this way? The pop-music industry
farms out a small number of songs
to the entire country. And not just
Katy Perry, but over and over
again, people also "support" the es
tablished, famous, great musicians.
From Beethoven to the Beatles,
every generation gives them a lis
ten. Do we give lesser-known con
temporary musicians equal sup
port? It's trendy, bumper-sticker
identity politics to say something
like, "support local music," which
isn't the focus of what I'm suggest
ing. I take a more comprehensive
perspective, that we should pay at
tention to the makeup of our music
portfolios. If you want to support
the broader world of music but only
listen to Top 40, that's a pretty lim
ited scope of "support." And lucki
ly, we now have access to a much
wider "local" music scene online.
You don't have to be in Seattle to
discover the bands there anymore,
for example.
A complementary question

might be: how important is music to
you? Perhaps you use it merely as
part of the background environ
ment in your daily life, or as a signif
icant emotional experience, or
something else entirely. Some
would argue that if you like and lis
ten to music a lot, you should be
predicted to support the musicians
more. Do you?
This is where we get into the fi
nances. In the last decade, comput
ers have changed the music record
ing industry significantly a topic
much discussed before. I don't want
to get into issues concerning what's
the most "fair" or "right" system to
distribute recordings to people.
From Napster knockoffs to Inter
net radio to bands making their
music fully available, there are
many models to discuss.
What I want to ask is the finan
cial side of this column's title: do
you support musicians? How do
you participate in the system in
such away that the musicians get
paid for what they do? Be it
through advertising revenue on
Internet radio stations, concert
tickets, purchases on iTunes, some
donation mechanism or some
thing innovative if society
wants to assist this part of the
workforce, it needs to use some
type of channel to do so. Clearly a
lot of systems are in place and
revenue does flow to musicians.
I'm simply trying to remind the

reader to consider your role and
contribution.
Because unfortunately, when
recorded music is so readily avail
able, it's easy for us to be free rid
ers. You could download all sorts
of music, making for hours, days
and weeks of entertainment, with
out a cent ever going to a musi
cian. That system assumes musi
cians must be (unhealthily) in it
exclusively "for the art." Having
access to so much music is great,
but we need to make sure we give
back. And not just for fairness rea
sons but because musicians are,
by reputation, financially
strapped.
I ask because I love music and I
love that so many other people
also love music and spend their
lives creating it. I want them to be
able to comfortably keep doing it.
And to be honest, I've been a free
rider too, downloading my share
of songs. So I'm happy to pay for
concerts, buy young bands' albums
on iTunes, and once I have extra
income I hope to donate to the
arts, maybe through some cool
musician-microfinance scheme. Is
it an optimal setup? Probably not.
But I'm confident that we will
keep figuring this thing out and
continue to improve the situation.
Because in the end, arguments
about "stealing music" are a turn
off to everyone. Engaging in posi
tive discussions and brainstorming
about how to support musicians is
much more constructive.

Any cool ideas? E-mail lucaswj@

love that so many other people
also love music and spend their
lives creating it. I want them to be
able to comfortably keep doing it.
And to be honest, I've been a free
rider too, downloading my share
of songs. So I'm happy to pay for
concerts, buy young bands' albums
on iTunes, and once I have extra
income I hope to donate to the
arts, maybe through some cool
musician-microfinance scheme. Is
it an optimal setup? Probably not.
But I'm confident that we will
keep figuring this thing out and
continue to improve the situation.
Because in the end, arguments
about "stealing music" are a turn
off to everyone. Engaging in posi
tive discussions and brainstorming
about how to support musicians is
much more constructive.

Any cool ideas? E-mail lucaswj@
