# THIS COLUMN IS IRONIC
## Farm-Grown Head Coaches (And Technically, They're Organic, Too!) 
### Shane Savitsky 
Jim Harbaugh, the man who
brought us to the college football
promised land, has left the green
pastures of the Farm for the even
greener pastures of the National
Football League. It's a sad time for
the football program, but an exciting
one as well. There were some big
names being thrown around for our
head-coaching vacancy Boise
State's Chris Petersen chief among
them but recent indications are
that our next head coach is already
here at Stanford. David Shaw? Vic
Fangio? I'm all for promoting some
one from within the existing Stan
ford coaching structure, but that's
thinking too small. There are plenty
of other people on campus who have
the potential to be the next head
coach of the Stanford Cardinal. Here
are my impressions regarding just a
few of them. Bob Bowlsby, are you
reading this?
Andrew Luck: He obviously
loves this place more than Har
baugh, anyway. After all, he turned
down roughly $6O million from the
Carolina Panthers to come back to
the Farm. Plus, did you watch the
coverage of the Orange Bowl? An
nouncers haven't managed a love
fest for a single player like that since
Tebow. (And Luck didn't even have
to save the souls of Filipino orphans
using Bibles he wrote in his own
blood!) Over the course of the
game, Ron Jaworski and Jon Gru
den basically convinced themselves
that Luck is the second coming of
Touchdown Jesus. If that's the case

and he's coming back for another
year, why shouldn't he coach the
team, too?
Dean Julie: Initially, Dean Julie
would make a beast of a recruiter.
Just imagine: she would hold a big,
inspirational event in MemAud
telling the incoming recruiting class
that they would be the "next great
Stanford football recruiting class of
2011." Morale would be sky high!
However, the football program
would soon fall apart because no

one in the recruiting class would
ever see her again after that event.

The Leland Stanford Junior
University Marching Band: Their
patented scatter formations might
be a distinct change from the pro
style offense installed under Har
baugh, but this is a choice with close
ties to the football program. How
ever, it is unclear whether Luck
would be able to run the offense ef
fectively when he's forced to take a
shot of tequila after every incom
plete pass. In addition, the
LSJUMB probably has a very dif
ferent definition for "shotgun" than
what the football team is currently
used to.
A Stanford sorority: Bowlsby
showed that he could think outside
the box when he hired Harbaugh, a
relative unknown from the Univer
sity of San Diego. Thus, he might ap
preciate the unorthodox idea of
having an entire sorority chapter
coach our football team. Sorry, Bob,
but this choice would be a terrible
decision for the program. Theta?
The football team embodies "char
acter and cruelty," not complete and
utter pretentiousness. Kappa? Did
you think the LSJUMB was a bad
idea? We need the team to be sober.
Chi O? Let's be honest: no one real
ly knows they exist.There's really no
good option here, no matter which
way you look at it.
Condoleezza Rice: Condi loves
Stanford sports. We all saw her on

Bob Bowlsby,
are you
reading this?

TV at both the Stanford women's
basketball game against UConn
and the Orange Bowl. She knows
her stuff, so that's good. Yet soon
after her introductory press con
ference, it's not inconceivable that
she would recommend that we de
clare preemptive war against Cal,
claiming that they stole the Axe.
This would lead to a lengthy Stan
ford occupation of Berkeley, dur
ing which it is determined that she
and President Hennessy utilized
faulty intelligence to initiate the
conflict. Come to think of it, this
storyline sounds kind of familiar,
doesn't it?
Leland Stanford, Junior: This
choice is contingent on Stanford
scientists coming up with technolo
gy to reanimate the dead within the
next week, but I'm confident
they're up to the task. Even with
that in mind, this would be a sur
prising hire. Though he's technical
ly only 15 years old, Leland has
spent the last 127 years in the Stan
ford Mausoleum. Bowlsby tends to
look for younger talent, so this
might not be his ideal choice es
pecially when Leland (born in
1868) would become the second
oldest coach in college football
after Joe Paterno.

If Bob Bowlsby would like any
other advice, he can always e-mail

you think the LSJUMB was a bad
idea? We need the team to be sober.
Chi O? Let's be honest: no one real
ly knows they exist.There's really no
good option here, no matter which
way you look at it.
Condoleezza Rice: Condi loves
Stanford sports. We all saw her on

Bob Bowlsby,
are you
reading this?

TV at both the Stanford women's
basketball game against UConn
and the Orange Bowl. She knows
her stuff, so that's good. Yet soon
after her introductory press con
ference, it's not inconceivable that
she would recommend that we de
clare preemptive war against Cal,
claiming that they stole the Axe.
This would lead to a lengthy Stan
ford occupation of Berkeley, dur
ing which it is determined that she
and President Hennessy utilized
faulty intelligence to initiate the
conflict. Come to think of it, this
storyline sounds kind of familiar,
doesn't it?
Leland Stanford, Junior: This
choice is contingent on Stanford
scientists coming up with technolo
gy to reanimate the dead within the
next week, but I'm confident
they're up to the task. Even with
that in mind, this would be a sur
prising hire. Though he's technical
ly only 15 years old, Leland has
spent the last 127 years in the Stan
ford Mausoleum. Bowlsby tends to
look for younger talent, so this
might not be his ideal choice es
pecially when Leland (born in
1868) would become the second
oldest coach in college football
after Joe Paterno.

If Bob Bowlsby would like any
other advice, he can always e-mail

(and so can you!).
