## Repeal of DADT doesn't alleviate committee's task 
### JOSH SCHOTT'14 
The recent repeal of DADT in the military has
ROTC proponents thinking they have the ball in the
red zone and the only thing left to do is run the ball in
for an easy touchdown. I'm baffled as to why. Why does
Ewart Thomas, the chair of the Faculty Senate's ad hoc
committee on ROTC, think that the repeal of ROTC
will alleviate the committee's task? Stanford Universi
ty phased out its ROTC program in 1973. Congress
passed the "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" policy in 1993; there
fore, DADT played no part in Stanford's decision. So
why is DADT even a topic of discussion? And why are
proponents, and possibly even the committee, thinking
there are few roadblocks to ROTC's return? What is
particularly concerning to me is that proponents and
the committee have rarely addressed the real reasons
for ROTC leaving the campus in 1973. All except one of
the reasons remain an issue and would apply to

ROTC's presence on campus today. After reading the
Ad Hoc Senate Committee on ROTC's Majority Re
port of 1969,1 am shocked that there's even a discussion
about bringing back ROTC. I will discuss a few of the
many reasons, identified in that report, for Stanford's
decision to discontinue its ROTC program. (All quota
tions are from the 1969 report unless otherwise stated.)
ROTC creates a "conflict of interest." Military offi
cers are granted faculty positions to administer the
ROTC program. These officers' primary allegiance and
duty is to the branch of the military of which they are a
member, the U.S. military as a whole and the U.S. gov
ernment. Their primary commitment cannot simultane
ously be to the university or to the "academic enter
prise."
