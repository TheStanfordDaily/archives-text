## Repeal of DADT doesn't alleviate committee's task 
### JOSH SCHOTT'14 
The recent repeal of DADT in the military has
ROTC proponents thinking they have the ball in the
red zone and the only thing left to do is run the ball in
for an easy touchdown. I'm baffled as to why. Why does
Ewart Thomas, the chair of the Faculty Senate's ad hoc
committee on ROTC, think that the repeal of ROTC
will alleviate the committee's task? Stanford Universi
ty phased out its ROTC program in 1973. Congress
passed the "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" policy in 1993; there
fore, DADT played no part in Stanford's decision. So
why is DADT even a topic of discussion? And why are
proponents, and possibly even the committee, thinking
there are few roadblocks to ROTC's return? What is
particularly concerning to me is that proponents and
the committee have rarely addressed the real reasons
for ROTC leaving the campus in 1973. All except one of
the reasons remain an issue and would apply to

ROTC's presence on campus today. After reading the
Ad Hoc Senate Committee on ROTC's Majority Re
port of 1969,1 am shocked that there's even a discussion
about bringing back ROTC. I will discuss a few of the
many reasons, identified in that report, for Stanford's
decision to discontinue its ROTC program. (All quota
tions are from the 1969 report unless otherwise stated.)
ROTC creates a "conflict of interest." Military offi
cers are granted faculty positions to administer the
ROTC program. These officers' primary allegiance and
duty is to the branch of the military of which they are a
member, the U.S. military as a whole and the U.S. gov
ernment. Their primary commitment cannot simultane
ously be to the university or to the "academic enter
prise."
"Training for a specific employ
er, by that employer." ROTC is an
external, institutionalized organi
zation that specifically trains stu
dents to acquire the skills needed to
work for that organization. Such
training is administered by the mil
itary, in the interests of the military,
and fundamentally differs, there
fore, from the "unrestricted cre
ation and dissemination of knowl
edge" that one should receive by
way of a college education. This
type of training should not be a part
of the "academic structure of the
university."
ROTC is academically prescrip
tive. All three branches of the mili
tary legally require students to take
"certain courses of study" and the
Navy even excludes other certain
courses of study from the program.
An external organization on cam
pus should not be able to legally
bind students to a prescribed
course of study when that external
organization also has the power to
dictate the methodology and con
tent of that course of study. ROTC
for the three branches also requires
students to satisfy "certain academ
ic standards." Students should not
be legally bound to satisfy academ
ic standards created by an external
organization that also determines
whether or not those standards are
met.

ROTC programs demand that
students meet certain standards of
"personal conduct." These con

straints restrict "students' free par
ticipation in all facets of intellectu
al inquiry and legal political activi
ty." Academic prescriptions and
standards of personal conduct cre
ated by an external organization on
campus violate the fundamental
concept of the University's "rights
and obligations to establish, main
tain, and judge its own standards of
academics, course of study, and stu
dent conduct."
"Contracts for service" in
ROTC financial agreements legally
bind students to serve in the armed
forces after graduation. If the stu
dent doesn't serve in the armed
forces after graduation or decides
he/she doesn't want to continue the
ROTC program sometime
throughout his/her undergraduate
career, he/she is (at least potential
ly) financially penalized. No other
academic programs have such a
condition.
DADT wasn't an issue then. So
why is it now? The arguments ex
plained above reflect only a few of
the reasons that supported ridding
Stanford of ROTC in 1973. Noth
ing, except the use of "punitive
clauses," has changed since. Why is
the idea of bringing back ROTC
even being explored if so few of the
reasons for getting rid of it in the
first place have changed? It is quite
concerning that this fact isn't being
publicly addressed by proponents
of ROTC or the committee. That
said, I would like to thank the Uni
versity for reaching out to the stu
dent body and making the ROTC
question a collective, community
decision.

reasons for getting rid of it in the
first place have changed? It is quite
concerning that this fact isn't being
publicly addressed by proponents
of ROTC or the committee. That
said, I would like to thank the Uni
versity for reaching out to the stu
dent body and making the ROTC
question a collective, community
decision.
