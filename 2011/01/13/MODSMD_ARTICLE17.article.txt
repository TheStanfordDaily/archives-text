## Battling the big dogs 
### LAUREN TAYLOR STAFF WRITER 
Now in the heat of conference
play, the Stanford men's basketball
team faces its toughest test thus far
as it prepares to take on No. 18
Washington (12-3, 4-0 Pac-10)
tonight at Maples Pavilion. The
matchup marks the Cardinal's first
meeting with a top-25 opponent in
the 2010-11 season.

Stanford (9-5,2-1) headed home
from last week's road trip with a
split, defeating Arizona State, 55-41,
but falling to Arizona in a 67-57 de
cision that is the Card's only loss in
Pac-10 play.
The Huskies, on the other hand,
remain undefeated atop the confer
ence due to sweeps of the Oregon
and southern California schools, as
well as a season-best six-game win
ning streak. Washington's only
three losses were delivered by Ken
tucky, Michigan State and Texas
A&M, all of whom are ranked in
the top 25.
Stanford views tonight's
matchup as an opportunity to go
toe-to-toe with one of the nation's
elite.

"They are a high scoring team,
and they're great on the backboard,
so we have to be able to rebound
with them," said head coach Johnny
Dawkins. "They're a terrific team, a
terrific program, and we have to
play really well to have a chance to
compete."
If the Card can demonstrate the
right combination of the strongest
aspects of its game, it can certainly
do just that. Defensive dominance,
for one, has been a huge factor in
Stanford's success so far and will be
key against Washington, which
boasts one of the most prolific of
fenses in the nation. The Huskies
have maintained a scoring margin
of plus-20.8, and they average 88.9
points per game with a 49.1 overall
shooting percentage.
Washington's offensive squad is
led by junior Isaiah Thomas (16.0
points per game, 36.4-percent

shooting), senior Matthew Bryan-
Amaning (15.3 ppg, 7.5 rebounds
per game, 57.5-percent shooting)
and senior Justin Holiday (11.5 ppg,
5.9 rpg, 52.4-percent shooting, 42.0-
percent three-point shooting, 26
steals).
This trio poses the most signifi
cant threat for Stanford's solid de
fensive game, which is currently al
lowing only 60.0 points per game,
which leads the Pac-10 and repre
sents a major improvement from re
cent seasons. In fact, the 2010-11
Card has already kept five oppo
nents under 50 points, which had
only been achieved once during the
first two seasons under Dawkins.
"We have defended fairly well,
and I'm really excited about that,"
Dawkins said. "We have a new
group, and to see them come to
gether defensively is always excit
ing."
While Dawkins recognizes that
defense is the team's strength, he
also emphasizes the importance of
junior guard Jeremy Green and his
teammates putting up big numbers.
Green is particularly stellar on the
offensive end in Maples Pavilion, as

he approaches the 1,000-point mark
for his career and remains Stan
ford's primary offensive weapon
with 15.9 points per game.
Redshirt junior center Josh
Owens has boosted the Cardinal
frontcourt, averaging 12.0 points
and leading the team in rebounding
at 6.4 per game. After sitting out last
year's season because of an undis
closed medical condition, Owens
will be relied upon to step up the

team's offensive efforts against the
Huskies.
"Scoring and rebounding are
two areas we have to focus in on and
manage," Dawkins said. "We have
to value the basketball, which will
help our offense in itself. We always
try to make it difficult for the oppos
ing team to score, and that isn't
going to change against Washing-

Junior forward Andrew Zimrmermann, above, is one of few upperclassmen
hoping to lead a young Stanford team to a victory over No. 18 Washington
tonight. The Cardinal has not lost in Maples Pavilion this season, but
faces its toughest test thus far against the potent Huskies offense.
ton.
"We have to go out there and
play with the same energy that
we've been playing with all season,"
he added.
Some of this energy should de
rive from home-court advantage.
The Card is 47-11 in its last 58 home
games, dating back to the 2007-08
campaign. Snagging the 48th win
today will be a challenge, but by
matching the Huskies' offense with
a strong game on the boards and in
the backcourt, Stanford could pull
off the upset.
Tipoff is set for tonight at 7 p.m.
in Maples Pavilion.
