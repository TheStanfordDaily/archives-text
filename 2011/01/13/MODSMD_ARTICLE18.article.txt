# CRUISIN' CARDINAL
## 
### JACK BLANCHAT CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford women's basketball
team looks to continue its torrid play
this weekend when it heads north to
take on Washington and Washington
State in two Pac-10 matchups.
The No. 4 Cardinal (12-2,3-0 Pac
-10) has been unstoppable lately, but
the trip to Washington is the first
time the Card has been out of the
Bay Area since Dec. 19. Conference
road trips are never easy, but the
Huskies and the Cougars have both
had their struggles in the first half of
the season.
The Huskies (6-7,1-3) have had

an up-and-down season so far, as
they beat a tough Utah team in Salt
Lake City early in December, but
faltered with three straight losses to
Georgia Tech, UCLA and USC be
fore regaining their form last week.
Washington is coming off a split
with the Oregon schools, including
an improbable rally to beat Oregon
State. The Beavers built a 13-point
lead with less than six minutes left in
the game, and looked like they
would cruise to a victory until the
Huskies reeled off a 16-0 run to steal
the game, 55-52.
Despite 21 points from junior

guard Kristi Kingma, Washington
was unable to complete the week
end sweep and fell to Oregon, 68-64.
Kingma has been a force for the
Huskies this year, averaging 17.0
points per game. However, she will
pose problems for the Cardinal on
both ends of the floor, as her defense
remains among the strongest in the
conference.
Washington State (3-13,1-3) also
appears to be rounding the curve
after dropping seven straight in De
cember. After starting the Pac-10
season with losses to USC and
UCLA, the Cougars had an offen
sive explosion of 10 three-pointers
in a 77-72 loss to Oregon, and then
battled hard down the stretch to pull
out a 58-50 victory over Oregon
State. The win over the Beavers was
the first victory for the Cougars
since Dec. 5.
The Cougars have a trio of scor
ers who average over 10 points per
game in redshirt freshman Ireti
Amojo, freshman Sage Romberg
and junior Jazmine Perkins. Perkins,
a Berkeley native, scored a season
high 24 points in the loss to Oregon,
and Romberg notched 21 against
Oregon State.
On the other side of the ball, a
strong road trip may be just what the
doctor ordered for the Cardinal, as
the team has struggled this season
when it has strayed too far from the
Bay.
The Cardinal scraped out two
single-digit victories on a trip to
Utah and Gonzaga earlier this year,
then had its only two losses of the
season in back-to-back defeats at
DePaul and at Tennessee. After the
overtime loss in Knoxville, Stanford
has only played two road games
at San Francisco and Cal.
The Cardinal has never lost to
Washington State, taking a 50-0
mark into this weekend, and the
Huskies haven't beaten the Card in
their last nine tries. Stanford has
won its last three games by a com
bined 113 points, including an 82-35
thumping of Arizona State,
According to Stanford head
coach Tara VanDerveer, this stretch
of play shows how the Card is thriv
ing.
"I really feel like nothing suc
ceeds like success for our team,"
VanDerveer said. "We're playing
very confidently."
The Cardinal's surge of late can
be attributed to several factors, and
the stellar play of junior forward
Nneka Ogwumike has been critical
to the team's success.
Ogwumike has had three dou
ble-doubles this season against
ranked teams, and if the tall Texan
pulls off a repeat performance of last
week, the Cardinal has little reason

to be concerned when it heads up to
Seattle and Pullman. She had a near
ly perfect weekend, going 19-for-28
from the floor, grabbing 16 re
bounds and pouring in 40 points in
two games.
The defending Pac-10 player of
the year is averaging 17.2 points and
8.4 rebounds per game, and was re
cently named to the midseason
Wooden Award watch list, along
with teammate Kayla Pedersen.
Pedersen, a senior forward, also av
erages more than eight rebounds a
game, in addition to 11.5 points.
The Wooden Award, given yearly
to the nation's best player, selects 20
student athletes to the midseason
watch list. Stanford and North Car
olina were the only two schools to
have multiple players selected to the
list.
Stanford takes on Washington
tomorrow at 7 p.m. in Seattle, and
will tip off against Washington State
on Sunday at 1 p.m. in Pullman.
