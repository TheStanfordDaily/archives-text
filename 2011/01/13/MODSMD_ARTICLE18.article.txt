# CRUISIN' CARDINAL
## 
### JACK BLANCHAT CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford women's basketball
team looks to continue its torrid play
this weekend when it heads north to
take on Washington and Washington
State in two Pac-10 matchups.
The No. 4 Cardinal (12-2,3-0 Pac
-10) has been unstoppable lately, but
the trip to Washington is the first
time the Card has been out of the
Bay Area since Dec. 19. Conference
road trips are never easy, but the
Huskies and the Cougars have both
had their struggles in the first half of
the season.
The Huskies (6-7,1-3) have had

an up-and-down season so far, as
they beat a tough Utah team in Salt
Lake City early in December, but
faltered with three straight losses to
Georgia Tech, UCLA and USC be
fore regaining their form last week.
Washington is coming off a split
with the Oregon schools, including
an improbable rally to beat Oregon
State. The Beavers built a 13-point
lead with less than six minutes left in
the game, and looked like they
would cruise to a victory until the
Huskies reeled off a 16-0 run to steal
the game, 55-52.
Despite 21 points from junior
