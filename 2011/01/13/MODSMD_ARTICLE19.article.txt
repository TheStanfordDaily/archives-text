# Lessons from bowl season
## 
### Jacob Jaffe Fields of Failure 
Bowl season is over, college
football is over, life as we
know it is over. What can
fill the void in our lives
without the What Would
You Do For a Klondike Bar Alaska
Bowl? Clearly there's only one an
swer: analyzing the last month of bowl
games. Obviously.
Many questions are probably run
ning through your head right now: Why
would 1 want to spend more time
thinking about college football after I
had to sit through 35 bowl games and
finish last in my bowl-picking pool?
What is there to say about a bunch of
games that already happened? Is there
seriously a bowl game in Alaska?
The first question has an easy an
swer: college football is the greatest
sport in the world, and we all need
something to last us through the next
eight months. Plus, the only way to jus
tify your poor finish in your competi
tion is to analyze the teams and find
other people to blame for your inepti
tude. The third question can be an
swered just as easily: just look at the
ceiling right above you where some
one wrote "gullible." Or, if you prefer,
wait a few months until the announce
ment of next year's bowls, and the an
swer might very well change.
In the meantime, though, I'm going
to concentrate on that second ques
tion.
Well, for starters, yet another bowl
season brought us surprises that few
people saw coming. Washington, a
two-touchdown underdog, complete
ly outclassed Nebraska, a team that
clobbered the Huskies by five touch
downs just four months ago in Seattle.
Tulsa, a double-digit underdog, de
stroyed Hawaii in Hawaii , scoring one

point less than Boise State and Neva
da had against the Warriors combined.
The biggest blowout came against
an 11-1 team (Michigan State), and
Troy scored more points than Auburn
and Oregon combined. The Big East
and the Sun Belt had winning records
in bowl games, while the Big Ten and
Big 12 had losing records. The two
teams that managed the fewest points
(Utah and Georgia) still rank in the
top 30 nationally in points scored. The
Big Ten went 0-5 on New Year's Day
games and 3-0 during the rest of the
bowl season. The service academy
that came in with the best record
(Navy) was the only one of the three
to lose.
On the other hand, a whole lot
went according to plan. Of the 35
games,23 were won by favorites. All 13
bowl games from Jan. 1 on were won
by the favorites, and three of the five
BCS games finished within two points
of the point spread. The SEC, regard
ed by many as the nation's best confer
ence, won five bowl games, all by
teams favored to win. Only six of the
top 25 in the BCS standings lost to a
team ranked below them.
Still, there is intrigue to be found in
these bowl games. And while no one
can legitimately claim that the Sun
Belt is a better conference than the
SEC just because it had a better bowl
record, some facts about conferences
can be quite illuminating.
The Pac-10 has a national reputa
tion for its high-scoring offenses. A
combination of Oregon's spread of
fense and stars like Andrew Luck,
LaMichael James, Nick Foles and Jake
Locker (who deserves an award for
worst quarterback to be deemed a
"star" on a mediocre team) have
helped aid the Pac-10's reputation as a
finesse, offense-heavy conference that
would struggle against more physical
opponents.
Instead, the Pac-10 showed itself to
be anything but an offense-heavy con
ference. Again, it's a small sample size,
but only one Pac-10 team out of four
managed to score 20 points (you
might remember who), and only one
of the four "stars" had anywhere close
to a good game (another one you
might recall). On the other hand, only

one of the four teams gave up more
than 22 points (and that was to Okla
homa State, who got those points off
four costly Arizona turnovers). Pac-10
teams gave up 19.3 points per game,
fewer than the SEC (21.2), Big 12
(28.6) or Big Ten (30.9), despite play
ing the No. 3, No. 7, No. 21 and No. 38
scoring offenses in the country.
On the other hand, the much-ma
ligned Big East, which has precisely
zero of the top 50 scoring offenses in
the country, averaged 25.3 points per
game in the bowk Half its bowl partic
ipants broke 30 points, even though
they rank No. 63, No. 85 and No. 93 in
scoring. That's what makes bowl sea
son great; you can predict all you want,
but you'll still be wrong.
In the end, six teams defied expec
tations more than any other. Troy,
Tulsa, Ilhnois, Washington, Mississippi
State and Stanford all beat their re
spective point spreads by at least 25
points. A third of these come from the
Pac-10, and a third come from non-au
tomatic qualifying conferences. Half
of them are not even receiving votes in
the AP Poll, but that doesn't make
their wins any less important.
Anyone who saw the looks on
these teams' faces, or those of Florida
International (won its first ever bowl
game on a last-second field goal),
TCU (two-point victory in the Rose
Bowl for its first ever BCS bowl win)
and Army (two-point victory to se
cure program's first winning season
since 1996) can see the joy and passion
that college football's bowl season can
bring. Sure, the system has flaws, and
whether the BCS determines a true
champion is a debate for another time.
What we do know is that these
bowl games all 35 of them mat
ter. They matter to the coaches, they
matter to the players and they sure
matter to the fans. Anyone complain
ing about the number of bowl games
there are should pop in a tape of the
Kansas State-Syracuse game. Two
thoroughly unremarkable 7-5 teams
put on a show for four quarters, some
thing you'd be hard-pressed to say
about almost any BCS bowl. And real
ly, that's what bowl season is all about.
So go ahead, Klondike, give me
Arkansas State-Idaho in Anchorage
next year. I can't wait to watch.

ipants broke 30 points, even though
they rank No. 63, No. 85 and No. 93 in
scoring. That's what makes bowl sea
son great; you can predict all you want,
but you'll still be wrong.
In the end, six teams defied expec
tations more than any other. Troy,
Tulsa, Ilhnois, Washington, Mississippi
State and Stanford all beat their re
spective point spreads by at least 25
points. A third of these come from the
Pac-10, and a third come from non-au
tomatic qualifying conferences. Half
of them are not even receiving votes in
the AP Poll, but that doesn't make
their wins any less important.
Anyone who saw the looks on
these teams' faces, or those of Florida
International (won its first ever bowl
game on a last-second field goal),
TCU (two-point victory in the Rose
Bowl for its first ever BCS bowl win)
and Army (two-point victory to se
cure program's first winning season
since 1996) can see the joy and passion
that college football's bowl season can
bring. Sure, the system has flaws, and
whether the BCS determines a true
champion is a debate for another time.
What we do know is that these
bowl games all 35 of them mat
ter. They matter to the coaches, they
matter to the players and they sure
matter to the fans. Anyone complain
ing about the number of bowl games
there are should pop in a tape of the
Kansas State-Syracuse game. Two
thoroughly unremarkable 7-5 teams
put on a show for four quarters, some
thing you'd be hard-pressed to say
about almost any BCS bowl. And real
ly, that's what bowl season is all about.
So go ahead, Klondike, give me
Arkansas State-Idaho in Anchorage
next year. I can't wait to watch.

Bowl season is over, college
football is over, life as we
know it is over. What can
fill the void in our lives
without the What Would
You Do For a Klondike Bar Alaska
Bowl? Clearly there's only one an
swer: analyzing the last month of bowl
games. Obviously.
Many questions are probably run
ning through your head right now: Why
would 1 want to spend more time
thinking about college football after I
had to sit through 35 bowl games and
finish last in my bowl-picking pool?
What is there to say about a bunch of
games that already happened? Is there
seriously a bowl game in Alaska?
The first question has an easy an
swer: college football is the greatest
sport in the world, and we all need
something to last us through the next
eight months. Plus, the only way to jus
tify your poor finish in your competi
tion is to analyze the teams and find
other people to blame for your inepti
tude. The third question can be an
swered just as easily: just look at the
ceiling right above you where some
one wrote "gullible." Or, if you prefer,
wait a few months until the announce
ment of next year's bowls, and the an
swer might very well change.
In the meantime, though, I'm going
to concentrate on that second ques
tion.
Well, for starters, yet another bowl
season brought us surprises that few
people saw coming. Washington, a
two-touchdown underdog, complete
ly outclassed Nebraska, a team that
clobbered the Huskies by five touch
downs just four months ago in Seattle.
Tulsa, a double-digit underdog, de
stroyed Hawaii in Hawaii , scoring one

point less than Boise State and Neva
da had against the Warriors combined.
The biggest blowout came against
an 11-1 team (Michigan State), and
Troy scored more points than Auburn
and Oregon combined. The Big East
and the Sun Belt had winning records
in bowl games, while the Big Ten and
Big 12 had losing records. The two
teams that managed the fewest points
(Utah and Georgia) still rank in the
top 30 nationally in points scored. The
Big Ten went 0-5 on New Year's Day
games and 3-0 during the rest of the
bowl season. The service academy
that came in with the best record
(Navy) was the only one of the three
to lose.
On the other hand, a whole lot
went according to plan. Of the 35
games,23 were won by favorites. All 13
bowl games from Jan. 1 on were won
by the favorites, and three of the five
BCS games finished within two points
of the point spread. The SEC, regard
ed by many as the nation's best confer
ence, won five bowl games, all by
teams favored to win. Only six of the
top 25 in the BCS standings lost to a
team ranked below them.
Still, there is intrigue to be found in
these bowl games. And while no one
can legitimately claim that the Sun
Belt is a better conference than the
SEC just because it had a better bowl
record, some facts about conferences
can be quite illuminating.
The Pac-10 has a national reputa
tion for its high-scoring offenses. A
combination of Oregon's spread of
fense and stars like Andrew Luck,
LaMichael James, Nick Foles and Jake
Locker (who deserves an award for
worst quarterback to be deemed a
"star" on a mediocre team) have
helped aid the Pac-10's reputation as a
finesse, offense-heavy conference that
would struggle against more physical
opponents.
Instead, the Pac-10 showed itself to
be anything but an offense-heavy con
ference. Again, it's a small sample size,
but only one Pac-10 team out of four
managed to score 20 points (you
might remember who), and only one
of the four "stars" had anywhere close
to a good game (another one you
might recall). On the other hand, only

one of the four teams gave up more
than 22 points (and that was to Okla
homa State, who got those points off
four costly Arizona turnovers). Pac-10
teams gave up 19.3 points per game,
fewer than the SEC (21.2), Big 12
(28.6) or Big Ten (30.9), despite play
ing the No. 3, No. 7, No. 21 and No. 38
scoring offenses in the country.
On the other hand, the much-ma
ligned Big East, which has precisely
zero of the top 50 scoring offenses in
the country, averaged 25.3 points per
game in the bowk Half its bowl partic
ipants broke 30 points, even though
they rank No. 63, No. 85 and No. 93 in
scoring. That's what makes bowl sea
