## Study examines drug prescriptions 
### ELLORA ISRANI STAFF WRITER 
A recent study by researchers at Stan
ford and the University of Chicago found
that a significant proportion of prescrip
tions for atypical antipsychotics, currently
the top-selling class of drugs in the United
States, lack sufficient evidence for their ef
fectiveness.
Atypical antipsychotics are a newer gen
eration of antipsychotic medications intro
duced to the market in 1989. While their
"typical" first-generation predecessors tar
get dopamine pathways in the brain thought
to be the origins of psychotic symptoms,
atypical drugs address a variety of other
neurotransmitters whose influences are less
obvious but equally significant.
"What we were interested was, first of all,
the shift from the older generation to the
newer generation," said Randall Stafford,
senior author of the study and associate pro

fessor of medicine. "And then also among all
of the uses, to what extent were antipsychot
ic medications being used for conditions
that were not part of their FDA approval for
the drug."
The study tracked prescriptions of both
typical and atypical antipsychotics between
1995 and 2008 using data from a physicians'
survey by private health-care information
company IMS Health.
"Basically what we found was that there
was a substantial use actually more than
half of the uses for the newer-generation an
tipsychotics did not have strong evidence
behind them," Stafford said. "Not only were
these uses not approved by the FDA, they
didn't even have the sort of evidence that
we expect of drugs that are going to be wide
ly used."
Physicians frequently prescribe atypical
antipsychotics to address illnesses for which
their effectiveness has yet to be proved by
the FDA. These illnesses include other psy

choses, autism, bipolar disorder, delirium,
dementia, depression and personality disor
ders. Side effects range from weight gain to
diabetes to heart disease.
"When drugs are approved, it's not a
blanket approval. It's approval for a very
specific use," he said. "For instance, al
though antipsychotics could be used for a
whole range of psychiatric conditions, many
of them were first approved for schizophre
nia and over time have gradually been used
for many other psychiatric conditions."
The study determined that prescriptions
for atypical antipsychotics nearly tripled to
16.7 million in 2008 from 6.2 million in 1995,
and Stafford estimates that in recent years,
$l5 billion per year has been spent on the
drugs. Of the $6 billion spent in 2008 for off
label uses, $5.4 billion was for uses with "un
certain evidence."
"At best, what we have here is practice
