## Study examines drug prescriptions 
### ELLORA ISRANI STAFF WRITER 
A recent study by researchers at Stan
ford and the University of Chicago found
that a significant proportion of prescrip
tions for atypical antipsychotics, currently
the top-selling class of drugs in the United
States, lack sufficient evidence for their ef
fectiveness.
Atypical antipsychotics are a newer gen
eration of antipsychotic medications intro
duced to the market in 1989. While their
"typical" first-generation predecessors tar
get dopamine pathways in the brain thought
to be the origins of psychotic symptoms,
atypical drugs address a variety of other
neurotransmitters whose influences are less
obvious but equally significant.
"What we were interested was, first of all,
the shift from the older generation to the
newer generation," said Randall Stafford,
senior author of the study and associate pro

fessor of medicine. "And then also among all
of the uses, to what extent were antipsychot
ic medications being used for conditions
that were not part of their FDA approval for
the drug."
The study tracked prescriptions of both
typical and atypical antipsychotics between
1995 and 2008 using data from a physicians'
survey by private health-care information
company IMS Health.
"Basically what we found was that there
was a substantial use actually more than
half of the uses for the newer-generation an
tipsychotics did not have strong evidence
behind them," Stafford said. "Not only were
these uses not approved by the FDA, they
didn't even have the sort of evidence that
we expect of drugs that are going to be wide
ly used."
Physicians frequently prescribe atypical
antipsychotics to address illnesses for which
their effectiveness has yet to be proved by
the FDA. These illnesses include other psy

choses, autism, bipolar disorder, delirium,
dementia, depression and personality disor
ders. Side effects range from weight gain to
diabetes to heart disease.
"When drugs are approved, it's not a
blanket approval. It's approval for a very
specific use," he said. "For instance, al
though antipsychotics could be used for a
whole range of psychiatric conditions, many
of them were first approved for schizophre
nia and over time have gradually been used
for many other psychiatric conditions."
The study determined that prescriptions
for atypical antipsychotics nearly tripled to
16.7 million in 2008 from 6.2 million in 1995,
and Stafford estimates that in recent years,
$l5 billion per year has been spent on the
drugs. Of the $6 billion spent in 2008 for off
label uses, $5.4 billion was for uses with "un
certain evidence."
"At best, what we have here is practice
getting ahead of the evidence," he
said. "At worst, what we have is
practice being influenced by the
substantial marketing that went on
for these drugs."
Stafford suggests that the major
solution to preventing unfounded
prescriptions lies in curbing the ad
vertising done by pharmaceutical
companies in order to provide con
sumers both patients and physi
cians— with "objective informa
tion about the drugs." Although
consumers have won hundreds of
millions of dollars from the compa
nies in what is the single largest class
of litigation filed under the federal
False Claims Act, this remains an in
significant financial blow to the in
dustry.
"For physicians, part of the mes
sage here is that we need to be care
ful about the medications we're
using, particularly if those medica

tions have serious side effects,"
Stafford said. "From the consumer
point of view, I think it's always
worth asking physicians,' What's the
evidence that leads you to believe
that this drug will be helpful for
me?"'
However, Stafford remains
hopeful about the future of atypical
antipsychotics and their ability to
effectively aid most patients. For ex
ample, the study found a decrease in
prescriptions between 2006 and
2008 after the FDA issued a "black
box" warning against in the drugs in
2005 because of their role in in
creasing the risk of death for pa
tients with dementia.
"My hope is that they will be
some recalibration of the use of
these medications, and that their use
will be more appropriate in the fu
ture," Stafford said. "There's greater
attention on these drugs. And in all
likelihood that will result in better
practices and more evidence-based
practice."
