## Jared Cohen'04 describes the origins of statecraft'

"The 21st century is all about surprises, and
the spread of technology is the wild card," said
Jared Cohen 'O4 during a talk sponsored by
Stanford in Government on Wednesday night
about how technology is shaping international
relations.
Cohen, formerly of the U.S. State Depart
ment's policy planning staff and now the direc-

tor of Google Ideas, emphasized
the role of connections in creat
ing a 21st-century "statecraft"
comprised of the state, individu
als and technology, or tools.
According to Cohen, public
policy is no longer limited to ne
gotiations but is now open to
connections. Society must look
at how connectivity is shaping

international relations in a world where there
are fewer physical walls and more firewalls that
state apparatuses can infiltrate, he said.
"The connection technology we see today is
probably the most powerful tool to empower
communities at the grassroots level for good
or for bad because it eliminates the interme
diary in the spread of information," Cohen said.
Cohen cited Afghanistan, where imprisoned
A1 Qaeda members have orchestrated suicide
bombings from cell phones, as one instance
where connective tools were harnessed for hos
tility as opposed to empowerment.
"A handset can be as powerful a weapon as a
tool or a gun," Cohen said, "because hostiles in
novate like crazy."
Though hostiles may innovate to inflict dam
age in repressive societies, democratic societies,
too, are subject to the dangerous tide of tech
nology, according to Cohen. In a world where
individuals have the power and means to "tag"
someone and inflict embarrassment, connectiv
ity is not always a positive.
Though "technology isn't the silver bullet an
swer," it has met some success in the past few
years, Cohen said.
Mediums such as Facebook and Twitter
allow for self-training in civil society activism.
In such cases, "social indulgence has political
prescriptions," Cohen said, describing a handful
of instances when technology led to broad polit
ical results, such as in 2009 after Iran's presiden
tial election.
