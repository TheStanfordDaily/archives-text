## Jared Cohen'04 describes the origins of statecraft' 
### ERIN INMAN STAFF WRITER 
"The 21st century is all about surprises, and
the spread of technology is the wild card," said
Jared Cohen 'O4 during a talk sponsored by
Stanford in Government on Wednesday night
about how technology is shaping international
relations.
Cohen, formerly of the U.S. State Depart
ment's policy planning staff and now the direc-

tor of Google Ideas, emphasized
the role of connections in creat
ing a 21st-century "statecraft"
comprised of the state, individu
als and technology, or tools.
According to Cohen, public
policy is no longer limited to ne
gotiations but is now open to
connections. Society must look
at how connectivity is shaping

international relations in a world where there
are fewer physical walls and more firewalls that
state apparatuses can infiltrate, he said.
"The connection technology we see today is
probably the most powerful tool to empower
communities at the grassroots level for good
or for bad because it eliminates the interme
diary in the spread of information," Cohen said.
Cohen cited Afghanistan, where imprisoned
A1 Qaeda members have orchestrated suicide
bombings from cell phones, as one instance
where connective tools were harnessed for hos
tility as opposed to empowerment.
"A handset can be as powerful a weapon as a
tool or a gun," Cohen said, "because hostiles in
novate like crazy."
Though hostiles may innovate to inflict dam
age in repressive societies, democratic societies,
too, are subject to the dangerous tide of tech
nology, according to Cohen. In a world where
individuals have the power and means to "tag"
someone and inflict embarrassment, connectiv
ity is not always a positive.
Though "technology isn't the silver bullet an
swer," it has met some success in the past few
years, Cohen said.
Mediums such as Facebook and Twitter
allow for self-training in civil society activism.
In such cases, "social indulgence has political
prescriptions," Cohen said, describing a handful
of instances when technology led to broad polit
ical results, such as in 2009 after Iran's presiden
tial election.


Jared Cohen
Realizing that technology can
be used for good or for harm,
Cohen explained "technoprag
matism" as the desire for a new
positive by maximizing influence,
not control, over connective
tools.
"We all need to think of how
we can maximize creativity on the
right side," Cohen said.
In a world where "technology
creates space for unlikely leaders
that aren't trained civil-society ac
tivists" and where "technology is
part of every problem and every
solution," Cohen emphasized the
necessity to bridge the gap.
Google Ideas has a deep un
derstanding of technology while
also being extremely global, but
its international presence makes
it impossible for its influence to
stay private, he said.
"Rather than a state that
forms value systems and builds
policies around that, a company
does their thing and must now de
cide on values," Cohen said.
Valentin Bolotnyy *ll, chair of
Stanford in Government, saw
Cohen's background and expert
ise as away to bridge the gap be
tween policy-making and tech
nology.
"Cohen is the kind of speaker
that we saw taking the science
and technology side of campus
closer to international relations
and political science side of cam
pus," he said. "Stanford is big on
interdisciplinary, but SIG sees a
lack of collaboration between
two sides of campus."
