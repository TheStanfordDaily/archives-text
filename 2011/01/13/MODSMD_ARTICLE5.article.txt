## Stanford Store to open on Parents' Weekend 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Samantha McGirr 
The Stanford Store, a division of
Stanford Student Enterprises (SSE) is
on schedule to open at its new location
at the former site of the Stanford Ticket
Office on Feb. 24. SSE proposed the
move last May as a response to lacklus
ter sales at the store's current location
behind Tresidder Union.
"Construction is on track," said SSE
chief executive Raj Bhandari M.S. 'lO in
an e-mail to The Daily.
The store is planning a Valentine's
Day sale at its current location to "open
up inventory space for new items for the
new store," said Bhandari. The installa
tion of a student-designed "light pen
dant" will cap the project next week, he
added.
Store manager Olivia Witter 'l3 said
staff will be moving items into the new
store "in the near future." The store is a
student-run venture whose revenue
goes to the ASSU.
The Stanford Department of Project
Management is overseeing the move,
estimated to cost around $297,000.
