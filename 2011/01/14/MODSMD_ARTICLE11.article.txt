## CHILD'S PLAY How do nature and nurture influence humor development in adolescents? 
### JESSICA WERTHEIM STAFF WRITER 
Stanford School of Medicine
and Lucile Packard Chil
dren's Hospital are conduct
ing studies on how the neu
ral pathways that encode
humor develop in children's brains,
while also researching the relation
between the development of humor
and of brain functions.

The study is headed by Allan
Reiss. M.D., who works at the Center
for Interdisciplinary Brain Sciences
Research (CIBSR). Michelle Neely
'll is a research assistant for The
Children's Humor Study at CIBSR
and is currently writing her senior
thesis on the groundbreaking re
search.

"Humor has always been an in
terest for me," Neely explained. "It's
really a powerful instrument: humor
is related to resilience, serves as a so
cial lubricant, helps people cope with
problems and promotes social bond
ing."
The focus of the study is how en
vironmental factors influence a de
veloping child's humor.
"As far as we are aware, this is the
first study of its kind that looks at
neural development in typically de
veloping children and its relation to
the maturation of a sense of humor,"
Neely said. "What we want to illumi
nate is the neural network that is im
plicated in the detection and appre
ciation of humor and how, if at all,
that differs between genders; how, if
it at all, it is different from that found
in adults; and how different personal
attributes of interest like tem
perament, intelligence, resilience
influence a child's appreciation of
humor."

Before the study began, re
searchers recruited boy/girl sibling
pairs within two and a half years of
age and boy/girl fraternal twins, all
between the ages of 6 and 12. The
Children's Humor Study posted fly
ers in locations around the Peninsu
la, including Whole Foods Market
and various libraries, and even pro
moted the study using a radio inter
view with Dr. Reiss, which was
picked up by a local television news
broadcast.

"We got a great response from
the radio interview," Neely
said, "and we're now in the
process of scheduling in
families."
The study requires the i

brother/sister sibling pairs to watch
and respond to a series of short film
clips while in a magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) scanner. Well before
the children are placed inside the
equipment, they practice in an MRI
simulator, where they learn the im
portance of staying still throughout
the protocol.
Inside the MRI, the children rate
whether or not they "like" each
video. Meanwhile, their brains are
being scanned with magnetic reso
nance imagining by researchers in
the next room. Post-scan, the chil
dren provide more nuanced ratings
on how funny and enjoyable they
found the videos, on a scale of one to
eight.
"Prior to the current study, we
had age-matched controls watch
hundreds of video clips, some from
America's Funniest Home Videos
and others from different Internet
sources, but with the same home
quality feel," Neely described. "By
comparing reactions to funny clips to
reactions to clips that are rewarding
but not funny, we hope to parse out
specific components of the response
to humor, in comparison to more
general reward activation."
The images and scans are brought
back to the lab for post-processing
and data compilation. So far, the
scans have been completed on a
total of 10 children.

"Our 'N' is still pretty small,"
Neely admitted. "We are seeing
brain activation, but not enough to
publish our findings."
The Children's Humor Study
hopes to involve another 15 sibling
pairs in the study in the hope of com
prehending how the detection and
appreciation of humor develops
over a lifetime, how it differs be
tween genders and how it relates to
childhood temperament and re
silience.
