# EXPLORING RACIAL AMBIGUITY
## 
### THEO MATTHEWS 
Meet Professor
Michele Elam: the
Martin Luther
King, Jr. Centen
nial Professor, as
sociate professor of English and
director of the program in
African-American studies.
Elam is also what the 2000
Census calls "Type 2" or, in
other words, racially ambiguous.
"My image started showing up
as a mixed-race academic," Elam
said of her growing prominence
in the '9os. "Sometimes I was of
color, sometimes I was Latina and
then other times I was some kind
of white. At one point I asked,
what are you doing with my
image?"

A personal connection to
mixed race and ethnicity led
Elam to conduct extensive re
search and produce numerous
publications about the field.
She has just completed a book
titled The Souls of Mixed Folk:
Race, Politics, and Aesthetics in the
New Millennium, which is set to
be released in February by the
Stanford University Press. The
book concentrates on a global
outlook of how mixed race lives
today. Elam looks at mixed race
identity and performance not just
in the U.S. but also in South Africa
and Brazil.
"I am interested in how ideas
of race travel, mingle and change
what we call comparative stud
ies," she said. "Globalization and
cultural traffic are where we are
today. We can't talk about how
race works in one nation. It
moves across borders and shapes
nations."

Elam's passion was sparked
when she was pursuing a bache
lor's degree in English at UC-San
Diego. But it didn't take long for
her to realize that she in fact was
drawn to a subject that was, in a
sense, a branch of English but had
not been thoroughly explored.
She became drawn to African-
American studies out of both
pure curiosity and the urge to un
earth more about a field that she
believed had been neglected.
"When I was interested in
African-American studies, it was
not as canonizing as it is now,"
Elam said. "There was not even a
Norton Anthology book of
African-American literature."
Elam then went on to earn her
doctorate of philosophy at the
University of Washington.
"My experience in grad school

changed the way I look at re
search and also changed my sense
of what an academic community
can be," she said.
Elam's passion for the field of
mixed race and ethnicity is equal
ly powerful. Elam tells a story of
how, in the late 19905, before the
2000 census, it was clear that race
studies were starting to change.
Through both extensive research
and a great deal of traveling, she
noticed that the race demograph
ics in the United States were be
coming more and more diverse.
Elam attributes her keen in
terest in literature and her repre
sentation in the humanities to the
fact that such fields are able to
capture experiences and social
prophecies that she believes
other approaches do not.
"Literary studies aren't dog
matic and don't prescribe action
and agenda," Elam said. "It can
actually galvanize social change
or comment on it obliquely. It can
inspire people to critically think."
On the topic of why African-
American scholars were initially
overlooked in the world of litera
ture, she proposed, "African
Americans weren't capable of
cultural achievement. People did
n't think about people of color in
the publication of literature. It
forced a reconsideration of what
counted as literature."

As for mixed race, the bound
ary between black and white has
continued to blur over the years.
But as a racially ambiguous Type
2 herself, Professor Elam accepts
the trend toward gray because it's
precisely what propels her pas
sion.
