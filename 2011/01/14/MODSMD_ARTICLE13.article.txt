## OH! SWEET NUTHIN' 'Chinese' Translation 
### Roseann Cima 
There's this Journal piece that's
been circulating singing the
praises of the "Chinese Moth
er." Maybe you've seen it."Chinese"
isn't intended to designate people of
Chinese nationality nor descent. It's
intended to designate what the au
thor claims is a culturally typical
style of parenting. Namely: hard
assed-ness. An unflinching demand
for measurable excellence, forbid
ding anything else. Typical of but not
at all limited to nor Ã¼biquitous in
Chinese culture. The article (written
by a self-described Chinese mother)
makes a point of the fact that moth
ers of Chinese heritage who are not
"Chinese" have almost always been
born in the West.

I found the piece, and its subse
quent discussion, particularly inter
esting because I went to a high
school more or less dominated by
the children of "Chinese Mothers." I
mean this both in the figurative
sense: that from my perspective,
many of my classmate's parents
were very strict, and the literal: my
(public) high school was more than
50 percent Asian (and at least 7 per
cent Filipino, which was large
enough that they got their own cate
gory on our website.) The over
whelming majority of my classmates
were either first-generation or actu
ally immigrants. Growing up in this
environment, as you can imagine,
I've developed an opinion on the
different parenting styles. My
biggest goal for this piece is to get
my point across without deeply of
fending anybody I know personally.
The best bit of evidence in sup
port of Chua-the-Chinese-Mother's
thesis was that my high school's
standardized test scores were
through the roof, but those of white
males (most of whom were pretty
well-to-do if they were in my neigh
borhood) were far below the district
average. But I'm more fascinated by
the fact that most of my closest
friends were not the offspring of
"Chinese" Mothers. My parents
might've tried at some point in time,
but after reaching age seven without
cable, my little brother cried that
they were excluding him from popu
lar culture and we ended up getting
satellite. Some of my friends' par
ents were hippies. Some of them had
too many children to focus too hard
on any one. Some of them were just

absent or absent-minded. And some
of them were just Western. The point
is: By the time we reached high
school, all of us were pretty much
past caring what our parents
thought about our grades. Regard
less of our culture of origin, we were
on our own.

Now, a lot of the traits of "Chi
nese" parenthood kind of collapse
when a habitat becomes saturated
with "Chinese" children. If more
than 50 percent of students in the
class are "not allowed to not be the
No. 1 student in any subject but gym
and drama," something's just got to
break. The "Chinese"-ness of my
class was mostly expressed in exter
nally motivated, hyper-grade-con
sciousness. This meant that it was re
ally difficult for a smart kid to feel
special through grades alone. To dis
tinguish himself. Mere straight As
were common. The homework was
boring, and, usually, just wasn't
worth it.

So we were not exceptional stu
dents. We got decent grades, but
even those of my friends with the
best turned in three-inch stacks of
busy work at the last minute every
term because we just hadn't been
doing it on the weekly or daily basis
it was assigned. Why would we, with
out someone to crack the whip? We
made the teachers tsk, but we also
kept them engaged. By my sopho
more year we'd developed a culture
of being interesting. I did my reading
so I could argue with Leslie, Max
and Karl about it in class while most
everyone else watched. We made
the best comments with our arms
crossed in the back row. We took all
the hard classes because we'd be
bored otherwise. We ran the ex
tracurriculars with rabid enthusiasm
and little discipline. We were osten
tatiously in-it-for-the-learning. This
was how we stood out. This was how
we found each other.
I know that I was not in a typical

school. I know that we were not typ
ical kids. But most of my "Chinese"
classmates went to UCs. Good
schools, good students and they're
on-track to professional careers. It
was only my friends who got into
Ivies. My theory about "Chinese
parenthood" is that it is a conserva
tive strategy. The thing about put
ting all your energy into measurable
excellence is that very little is left for
the kind of excellence that's hard to
quantify. Chua's point is that disci
pline can be drilled. And I agree.
There are other things that can't. I
don't want to say my classmates
were stunted. But it does feel like
there was something missing, or

maybe just delayed.The fortitude of
self that emerges from your pores
while you sweat through a support
ing role in the school play. The dark
stirring in your heart of hearts the
first time you watch a Clockwork
Orange by accident on TV. The
early realization of cultural rela
tivism that comes from your first
sleepover. Chua characterizes her
exactingness as being born of a be
lief in her children's abilities: The
reason Western parents don't push
their kids is because they don't
think the kids can make it. But "Chi
nese" mothers drive their kids like
cars. And they don't seem to have
faith that their children will find ex
cellence, or happiness, left to steer
their own wheels and cruise the
world on their own.
