## Let's send the Axe to San Quentin 
### Eric Dunn 
I'm proud that Stanford Universi
ty and our ol' pals at Cal finally
decided to put the Axe where it
belongs: in the hands of the better
school. With Andrew Luck coming
back and Stanford football fresh off
one of its best seasons in history, it
seems we'll have say over where the
trophy stays for some time, I think I
speak for most Stanford fans when I
say that the people who beat up on
Cal the most deserve the trophy.
That's why I hope the Stanford com
munity supports sending the Axe
trophy to San Quentin, a California
state prison.
The University of California,
Berkeley, is a public institution that
is completely dependent on funding
from California. The governor's rec
ommendation for the state's 2011-
2012 budget was released on Jan. 10,
and it bleeds Cardinal. Last year,
sweeping budget cuts rocked Berke
ley. The university was forced to cut
the baseball team and shutout the
program better than any Stanford
pitcher could. This year, the school
lost billions of dollars in state funds.
We can only hope that Berkeley's
football team is next on the list of
programs to be cut. Jerry Brown, our
loyal governor, masked his alle
giance to the Farm beneath rhetoric
about tough choices and fiscal re

sponsibility. But these crippling cuts
are what Stanford fans have been
waiting for a chance to wipe a
haven for hobos off the map. I'm
sure that the pinkos among us are
wondering where Berkeley's money
went. A glance at the budget shows
that although the proposal is filled
with losers, not everyone came up
short. Fearing the wrath of unions
like the California Correctional
Peace Officers Association (prison
guards), funding for prisons took
only slight cuts in the governor's
budget proposal. California unions
haven't just sliced open Berkeley's
pockets; they have even proposed a
place to put all these stranded bears.
Apparently, our plan is to lock up
all the Cal students who can no
longer afford tuition increases. In
honor of their accomplishments, I
feel like we owe these prison guards
a chance to have the Axe.

California has not always been a
Stanford fan. There was a time,
under a different governor Brown, in
which the University of California
thrived: It was a model of free, high
er education for the rest of the world.
Berkeley enjoyed an extraordinary
reputation, unfolding state resources
and enough money for working
showers in all the dormitories.
As the century dragged on, poli

tics in Sacramento dragged the sys
tem into a world where the one who
votes speaks softer than the one who
pays. A city that had constructed the
foundation for its state's future suc
cess realized the error in its ways.
Suddenly, Stanford fans came out of
the woodwork. Grassroots organiza
tions passed propositions and re
pealed taxes. Teachers unions repre
senting K-12 employees began
throwing their money behind politi
cians and ballot measures. Prison
guard unions evolved into a political
movement. Everyone marched to
the beat of our marching band's
drum (that's why everything is so
messed up, I guess). That is how we
got here.

I have a prescription for Stanford
fans looking to keep the Axe and
slowly take Berkeley off the map.
Don't vote. College students who
vote become constituents who make
politicians nervous. Nervous politi
cians fund colleges. Don't protest.
We should be proud that the Univer
sity of California is sinking beneath
the weight of an ocean of debt. Don't
worry. If the Axe is in the hands of
prison guards and union representa
tives, there won't be anyone in Cali
fornia strong enough to take it away.
