# SENSE AND NONSENSE
## Eternity in a Bamboo Forest 
### Aysha Bagchi 
There is a famous phrase in Bengali which,
roughly translated, means: "The lion is king of
the jungle; the jackal is king of the bamboo for
est. "

There once was a jackal. And this jackal
was the best in school. Lions always at
tained the highest glories, so his class
mates first thought he was a lion. But clearly
he was a jackal, for he sometimes acted
strangely. Still, this jackal was an impressive
jackal, and they offered him the throne of the
jungle.

The jungle was a great jungle. Lush trees
grew in this jungle. Clear water flowed
through this jungle. All ate, drank and were
merry in this jungle. "How lucky is this jack
al!" they thought, "He will be king of the jun
gle!"

But the jackal said no. The animals of the
bamboo forest had asked him to be king. His
classmates did not understand. The bamboo
forest had few rivers. Sometimes coconuts did
not grow. Neighboring forests warred against
each other and brought war to the bamboo
forest. Even under the leadership of a great
jackal, the future of the bamboo forest did not
look glorious.
The jackal had come armed with argu
ments. He wanted his classmates' support. He
said he could help build new irrigation tunnels.
He could plant new coconut trees. He might
broker peace between the kings of the neigh
boring forests. The bamboo forest could use a
jackal like him.
The monkeys the great risk analysts of
the jungle said if the jackal could make the
bamboo forest as great as the jungle, he would
be remembered as a glorious jackal. But that
would never happen. Progress would be slow,
if there was progress at all.
The jackal saw they were right. He had
been silly. The next day he would sit on the
throne of the jungle.
That night, the jackal and his good friend,
the lion, were watching the stars in the sky.
Through the quiet air, they heard the distant
singing of the animals of the bamboo forest.
They were surprised. There had been drought

in the bamboo forest. Many had died. Yet the
animals of the forest were singing. And their
song carried hope to the skies. And the stars
twinkled as the song reached them.
And the jackal's heart yearned to belong to
that song, to sing with the animals that could
make such song after such disaster. The song
ended, and the jackal was silent. Then he told
the lion he would join the animals of the bam
boo forest. And the next day he did.
The lion was made king of the jungle, and
many years went by. The animals of the jungle
ate and drank and were merry. And the lion
was proud to be king of such a jungle. And he
forgot about the jackal.
Then one day the lion fell ill. The elephant
the great doctor of the jungle told the
lion this was the end of his life. And the lion felt
strange. He did not know what to think. And
suddenly he wondered what had become of
his forgotten friend, the jackal?
The lion went to visit the jackal, and the
jackal was happy to see him. He explained that
the bamboo forest had made small progress.
Water now flowed more steadily. Coconuts
