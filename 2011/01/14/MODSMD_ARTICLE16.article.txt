## A
						Taste of Oxford 
### Anna Tenzing 
While the seasons change and the
clouds turn heavy with rain, the Stan
ford House in Oxford remains alive
and kicking. Accommodating its nearly en
tirely new breed of 46 Stanford students
(some leftover from last quarter), the house
offers a maze of staircases and double doors
to confuse residents of their own rooms'
whereabouts. A few hours upon arrival to the
site and after finding my room conveniently
located at the first door on the third floor, I
find another girl swinging through the hall
way doors. Asking her what she is up to, she re
sponds, "I'm lost. I'm trying to find my room."
So to all posterity of Stanford Program in Ox
ford, do not be alarmed if you can't find your
room even after having come from it. In fact,
there is a map of the house that might help
you find your way, but there is no guarantee.
My best wishes to you for finding your room
in this masterly design. Make sure to pass this
first assignment. Otherwise, they might send
you back home.
Just kidding.
The Stanford House, though architectural
ly complex and difficult to navigate, offers a
homey ambiance with a common room and
several kitchens. It is also situated right on
High Street, a main street of shops, patisseries
(my favorite) and other conveniences that
cities typically offer. Moreover, we are also lo

cated right across the street from Magdalen
College, one of the three colleges with which
Stanford students are affiliated (the other two
being Corpus Christi, and Brasenose, which I
am a part of).
Already into our second week here, many
have begun their classes as well as their tuto
rials. But those taking two tutorials (each ei
ther six or seven units, usually at the student's
discretion) may decide not to take classes and
do only the tutorials instead. Classes typically
take place in the seminar rooms inside the
Stanford House, and meetings with tutors,
often Professors or experts in their field, hap
pen either at an office or in their homes. On
Friday, I am meeting one of my tutors at his
home to discuss syllabus content and readings
before the weekly research papers have to
trickle in in a timely manner.Though there are
weekly classes, there is no typical schedule for
a student of English, mathematics or history
because much of it is a self-guided study (i.e.
the tutorial) and most of the time every week
is spent on independent research. This is one
of the program's best traits giving students
the creative flexibility to learn about their
topics of interests with a certain amount of
guidance from the tutors.
