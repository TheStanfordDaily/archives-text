# LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
## ROTC lends the military a critical mix 
### 
Dear Editor,
I was on campus today and saw a copy of
The Stanford Daily featuring your article on
ROTC.
I enlisted as an Air Force aviation cadet in
1944 out of high school. My first military as
signment was to Stanford as part of Air Force
cadet training.The war ended as I was entering
pre-flight in Mississippi. I was then trained as a
cryptographer and served in the German oc
cupation.
After discharge, I returned to Stanford. I
became head copy editor of The Stanford
Daily and was commissioned in the ROTC in
1950.1 continued on The Daily through grad
uate school. My association with the ROTC
officers' group, The Daily and the senior class

executive committee were among my fondest
memories at Stanford.
During the widespread campus "turmoils"
of the 19605, ROTC programs throughout the
nation were under assault from anti-military
groups. I had occasion to have a conversation
with then-Stanford president Kenneth Pitzer. I
argued that it was a mistake to abandon ROTC
programs in colleges. ROTC was an important
avenue into the officer corps of our armed
forces for those whose basic educational expe
rience and orientation had been shaped by the
civilian institutions. If these avenues disap
peared, the only route for those wishing to
serve their nation in the military/navy would be
the professional academies: West Point, VMI,
Annapolis, Air Force Academy, etc.
Excellent as these are, it would tend to
change the character of the officer corps from
reflecting the input of the citizen-solder to a
solely professional officer corps. This is cer

tainly not bad, but it does alter the makeup of
the military and, therefore, if I may say so,
would contradict the underlying intent of the
objectors. I would think that they, and indeed
I, would prefer that the mix of the military de
fending our nation include the element of the
citizen-soldier. President Pitzer's response to
my point was that he agreed completely.
In hindsight, we know that anti-ROTC
forces at that time were not resisted. Howev
er, I believe that that sentiment was contradic
tory, and therefore counter-productive. Let us
not repeat this misstep. It should also be re
membered that our recent highly regarded
"top soldier," and ROTC graduate, was Gen.
Colin Powell (also former Secretary of State).
