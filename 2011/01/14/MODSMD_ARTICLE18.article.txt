## STANFORD STANDING TALL TOP-RANKED CARD OPENS AGAINST CAL 
### JENNY PETER STAFF WRITER 
Stanford men's gymnastics team is currently No.
1 in the preseason polls, and the team will start de
fending that ranking tonight. The Cardinal will
open its competitive season by hosting Bay Area
rival No. 5 Cal.

The Cardinal was the NCAA runner-up to
Michigan last year and is ready to make another
run at the title. The 2011 team returns to the mat
tonight hungry for victory after placing second at
nationals last year and falling to Cal at the MPSF
Championships.
"We are all extremely motivated right now," said

senior co-captain
Tim Gentry. "Los
ing to Michigan re
ally lit a fire under
our team, and I can
see the focus and
intensity in prac
tice. Everybody is
committed to the
goal of winning
NCAAs, and this
meet is just the
first stepping stone
towards that goal"
The team fur
ther prepared it
self for this event
at the Cardinal
and White in
trasquad meet last
week. At the ses-

sion, Stanford proved that this year's team has an
even more promising scorecard for success as it ap
proaches its first meet with more depth in the ros
ter, more difficulty in skills, eight All-American re
turners and a talented freshman class capable of
contributing right away.
Challenging each other for the six spots at each
event is expected to be a common theme for this
year's team, as there are a lot of veterans and new
skill sets from the underclassmen. Freshman Cale
Robinson, for example, is pressuring sophomore
Eddie Penev for the top floor spot. Freshman Chris
Turner is also a viable new contender for pommel
horse and parallel bar positions. Other athletes are
making comebacks from injuries and adding more
difficult skills to their routines.
What matters to the men this early in the season
is getting comfortable hammering out routines.
"Now is all about the quantity of training," Gen
try said. "We usually do a lot more numbers during
preseason and at the beginning in order to get more
comfortable performing our routines. That way, by
the end of the season, all we need to work on are
small details. Also, we are looking to improve after
each competition culminating in a peak at

GAME NOTES: The No. 1 Cardinal
will open its season with a bang
tonight, taking on No. 5 Cal in a
clash of top-10 rivals. Besides
looking for a good start to the year,
Stanford will be hungry for revenge
after falling to Cal in the MPSF
Championships last year.

NCAAs."
"We're so deep in numbers,"
said redshirt sophomore Jordan
Nolff. "If you put in our sixth and
seventh guys in the lineups, we're
still on top. We fight for lineups this
year."
A new rule was implemented
this season to allow a 15-man lineup
on the competition floor. This
means that up to 15 athletes are al
lowed to compete instead of only 12
athletes as in the past. The previous
12-man lineup favored those who
competed in most of the events to
continuously be in the lineup, but
now event specialists can expect
more competition time. This
change adds even more depth to
Stanford's lineups.
Most of the lineups favor the
senior class, including redshirt sen
ior Nick Noone, which has proven

itself to be the top class in the coun
try. Seniors Ryan Lieberman and
Josh Dixon will be debuting skills
they invented on the parallel bars
that no one else has attempted. In
order to have the skill named after
them, they must compete at an in
ternational meet such as worlds
later in the year.
This season is also the last for
Cal's program, as it will be cut for fi
nancial reasons after this year. The
team placed fifth at NCAAs last
year and will come into the meet
with an attitude of nothing to lose.
"It's going to be a tough compe
tition," said senior co-captain Abhi
nav Ramani. "Cal is a really good
team. They have a bunch of nation
al team members and a fresh coach
ing staff so they're really going to
be gunning for us. It will be a close
but good battle this Friday."
The Cardinal and the Golden
Bears will square off at 7 p.m. in
Burnham Pavilion.

continuously be in the lineup, but
now event specialists can expect
more competition time. This
change adds even more depth to
Stanford's lineups.
Most of the lineups favor the
senior class, including redshirt sen
ior Nick Noone, which has proven

itself to be the top class in the coun
try. Seniors Ryan Lieberman and
Josh Dixon will be debuting skills
they invented on the parallel bars
that no one else has attempted. In
order to have the skill named after
them, they must compete at an in
ternational meet such as worlds
later in the year.
This season is also the last for
Cal's program, as it will be cut for fi
nancial reasons after this year. The
team placed fifth at NCAAs last
year and will come into the meet
with an attitude of nothing to lose.
"It's going to be a tough compe
tition," said senior co-captain Abhi
nav Ramani. "Cal is a really good
team. They have a bunch of nation
al team members and a fresh coach
ing staff so they're really going to
be gunning for us. It will be a close
but good battle this Friday."
The Cardinal and the Golden
Bears will square off at 7 p.m. in
Burnham Pavilion.
