## STANFORD STANDING TALL TOP-RANKED CARD OPENS AGAINST CAL 
### JENNY PETER STAFF WRITER 
Stanford men's gymnastics team is currently No.
1 in the preseason polls, and the team will start de
fending that ranking tonight. The Cardinal will
open its competitive season by hosting Bay Area
rival No. 5 Cal.

The Cardinal was the NCAA runner-up to
Michigan last year and is ready to make another
run at the title. The 2011 team returns to the mat
tonight hungry for victory after placing second at
nationals last year and falling to Cal at the MPSF
Championships.
"We are all extremely motivated right now," said

senior co-captain
Tim Gentry. "Los
ing to Michigan re
ally lit a fire under
our team, and I can
see the focus and
intensity in prac
tice. Everybody is
committed to the
goal of winning
NCAAs, and this
meet is just the
first stepping stone
towards that goal"
The team fur
ther prepared it
self for this event
at the Cardinal
and White in
trasquad meet last
week. At the ses-

sion, Stanford proved that this year's team has an
even more promising scorecard for success as it ap
proaches its first meet with more depth in the ros
ter, more difficulty in skills, eight All-American re
turners and a talented freshman class capable of
contributing right away.
Challenging each other for the six spots at each
event is expected to be a common theme for this
year's team, as there are a lot of veterans and new
skill sets from the underclassmen. Freshman Cale
Robinson, for example, is pressuring sophomore
Eddie Penev for the top floor spot. Freshman Chris
Turner is also a viable new contender for pommel
horse and parallel bar positions. Other athletes are
making comebacks from injuries and adding more
difficult skills to their routines.
What matters to the men this early in the season
is getting comfortable hammering out routines.
"Now is all about the quantity of training," Gen
try said. "We usually do a lot more numbers during
preseason and at the beginning in order to get more
comfortable performing our routines. That way, by
the end of the season, all we need to work on are
small details. Also, we are looking to improve after
each competition culminating in a peak at
