# Grads: Get in the game
## 
### Tom Taylor 
I have a confession to make:
I'm a grad student. While that
might not be the most shock
ing revelation, I still find it
quite amazing how few of us
are engaged with the athletic side of
Stanford. We outnumber the under
graduates on this campus (8,352 full
time graduate students compared to
6,889 undergraduates, according to
statistics released last October), but
we're a distant second in the bleach
ers and are all but non-existent on
the field.

It also seems all of my fellow
sports writers are undergraduates,
and the rest of The Daily is not much
different. Part of that is probably
down to the fact that most grad stu
dents have already worked out what
they want to do with their lives and
are hidden away in their labs doing
just that. But that doesn't feel like a
satisfactory excuse.
Graduate students are notori
ously good at seeking out the free
stuff available on campus, stretching
out those bare-bones salaries with
free food and entertainment. But
when it comes to sports, I think
they're missing a trick. Not only is
there sometimes food on offer at
sporting events, but in the real world
you'd have to pay hard cash to wit
ness some of the games played here.
Outside of football and men's bas
ketball, the student section can be
pretty empty, and those that do
show up seem to mostly be under
grads.

One of the main things keeping
grad students away could be their
alma mater. It is hard to honestly
support two different schools be
cause eventually there will come a
time when they clash, either directly
playing each other or simply playing
at the same time, and you will be
forced to take sides. When this hap
pens, the sense of belonging born
out of being part of a large under
graduate class easily beats the more
isolated existence at graduate
school.

A lot of us, though, are foreign
ers, and don't have a traditional
American college allegiance be
cause of that simple fact. As an un
dergraduate I went to the Universi
ty of Bristol in the U.K. and loved
every minute of it; however, I have
zero interest in its athletics because
the only two U.K. college sports pro
grams that even come close to the
American model are the rowing
teams of Oxford and Cambridge,
This doesn't, however, mean that the
stands are teeming with non-resi
dent aliens; while some of us, myself
included, are intrigued to find out
about the side of America so often
glimpsed in college and high-school
movies, many are simply just not in
terested in American sports.
What truly set the graduate and
undergraduate bodies apart,
though, are the basic rules of the
NCAA on eligibility. They effective
ly rule that graduate students can
not represent their universities:
Coterms can generally sneak in, but
when push comes to shove, these are
really just glorified seniors un
dergraduates who, for admittedly
valid reasons such as losing some of
their NCAA eligibility to injury or
wanting to add another qualifica
tion to their resume, have decided to
forgo the real world for yet another
year. Real grad students, the sort
you'll encounter if you venture far
enough east on campus or deep
enough into the bowels of the build
ings around the Quad, are notable
only for their absence from varsity
teams.
I might simply be getting bitter in
my old age, but this doesn't seem
fair. On physical grounds alone, 20-
something-year-old grad students
are not too old to play an active role
within college teams the best ath
letes, the professionals, are usually
older than undergrads. As an analo
gy, I'm not talking about Masters
Tennis, in which players too old to
compete on the ATP Tour hang
tough to the very end of their ca
reers (save for the likes of Federer
and Nadal, both now too old for
NCAA rules anyway).
Accessibility to education is
surely a major inspiration behind
the NCAA's restrictions, providing
opportunities for skilled young ath
letes to gain an education that they
might otherwise have been denied
because of the costs involved. But
the resulting system is flawed. Many
athletes leave college before they
finish their sought-after degrees,
and thus, whether by choice or not,
are denied that education; access to

graduate education, something that
can equally well transform some
one's job prospects and role in soci
ety, is often subject to exactly the
same funding problems.
While undergrads have a deep
and meaningful connection with
the varsity teams, either playing on
them or being able to cheer on
dorm-mates, I can't help wonder
ing whether Stanford Athletics re

ally, truly represents me. Perhaps
the question I should be asking is
not why there are so few grad stu
dents involved in sports here, but
why am I?
