## Faculty talks ROTC Professors discuss ROTC classes' academic merits 
### KATE ABBOTT SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Academics took a front seat at
Thursday's two-hour faculty and
staff discussion about ROTC, where
about 30 attendees departed from
Tuesday's student town-hall con
versation focused on discrimination
in the military.

Psychology professor Ewart
Thomas, chair of the Faculty Sen
ate's ad hoc committee studying
ROTC's possible return, opened
the discussion before history pro
fessor Barton Bernstein asked for
clarification on Stanford's current
relationship with ROTC.

"We do have ROTC students in
our midst," Thomas said. "Stanford
students are ROTC cadets." Those
students must commute to UC-
Berkeley, San Jose State University
or Santa Clara University to partic
ipate in the program.

Bernstein also asked whether
any ROTC courses are taught on
campus today pointing out a mili
tary science course that is listed in
the bulletin. Navy ROTC cadet and
committee member Akhil Iyer 'll
explained that a leadership course
required of freshman and sopho
more cadets is "held informally at
Tresidder," but is not taught by Stan
ford professors and cannot be taken
for Stanford or transfer credit.

"The purpose of the class is usu
ally that [younger cadets] usually
don't have cars, and don't have the
means for themselves to go to a
freshman-sophomore class at Santa
Clara," Iyer said. "It's more of a con
venience factor."

Professors and committee mem
bers then proceeded to address the
academic merit of ROTC courses,
which was the ultimate reason Stan
ford booted off campus in the early
1970s amid anti-Vietnam War tur
moil.

"My politics of anti-war and anti
militarism lean in the same direc
tion with my ideas about under
graduate education," said Todd
Davies, associate director of Sym
bolic Systems.

"The debate may lie whether
Stanford should move forward with
an explicit policy of approving cred
it for these courses and appoint
ment of instructors," he added. "I'm
opposed to that move."

Much of the concern is rooted in
that certain ROTC programs would
require cadets to enter the Universi
ty with a predetermined major,
which could conflict with Stanford's
emphasis on academic exploration.
Those who receive ROTC scholar
ships could also be penalized for not
fulfilling their service requirements,
a move that amounts to "financial
coercion" of students, one professor
said.

Political science professor Scott
Sagan said the committee conduct
ed "extensive research" of the
ROTC program and its administra
tion at M.I.T. in order to better un
derstand how universities treat the
issue of course credit.

"There is a range of accredita
tion and relationships between
ROTC trainers and a range of views
within different universities regard
ing credit," Sagan said.
He said that a faculty committee
at M.I.T. "reviews the curriculum
and the qualifications of the visiting
lecturers or professors that are
nominated by the services to teach
an ROTC course on campus." If
considered well-qualified, a speak
er is given a two-year appointment.
Committee member Imani
Frankin 'l3 added that these cours
es are open to students not enrolled
in ROTC, as would be the case if
Stanford chooses to again recog
nize ROTC.
"We would encourage those
courses that allow for collaboration
between ROTC and non-ROTC
students," she said. "I think that's
the value of bringing back ROTC."
Bernstein described his own ex
perience with ROTC, in which he
participated for two years during
the 19505. He described it as aca
demically unchallenging.
"No academic experience I've
had in America has been as
wretched as that was," he said.
Bernstein urged an examination
of military courses syllabi to see

how the current courses compare
to Stanford's academic standards.
"It would give a good sense of
what would be forthcoming," he

said. "If ROTC emulates West
Point and Annapolis in its text
books, then there's a good chance
many courses will be certified."

Iyer related some of his person
al experiences, including his com
mute to Berkeley for training and
for his required military-science
courses.
"Nowadays, the idea is that any
officer has the same type of train
ing regardless of school attended,"
he said. Many of the classes, books,
resources for NROTC are "pretty
similar to those found at West
Point, and in my experience I've
learned a lot and more as an upper
classman. The classes are a little
easy, but still a challenge because
the idea is to learn things in a stress
ful environment."
Thomas said the committee
would consider the viewpoints facul
ty raised Thursday and acknowl
edged: "We have a lot of work to do."
The committee is expected to
report to the Faculty Senate in
May.

ate's ad hoc committee studying
ROTC's possible return, opened
the discussion before history pro
fessor Barton Bernstein asked for
clarification on Stanford's current
relationship with ROTC.

"We do have ROTC students in
our midst," Thomas said. "Stanford
students are ROTC cadets." Those
students must commute to UC-
Berkeley, San Jose State University
or Santa Clara University to partic
ipate in the program.

Bernstein also asked whether
any ROTC courses are taught on
campus today pointing out a mili
tary science course that is listed in
the bulletin. Navy ROTC cadet and
committee member Akhil Iyer 'll
explained that a leadership course
required of freshman and sopho
more cadets is "held informally at
Tresidder," but is not taught by Stan
ford professors and cannot be taken
for Stanford or transfer credit.

"The purpose of the class is usu
ally that [younger cadets] usually
don't have cars, and don't have the
means for themselves to go to a
freshman-sophomore class at Santa
Clara," Iyer said. "It's more of a con
venience factor."

Professors and committee mem
bers then proceeded to address the
academic merit of ROTC courses,
which was the ultimate reason Stan
ford booted off campus in the early
1970s amid anti-Vietnam War tur
moil.

"My politics of anti-war and anti
militarism lean in the same direc
tion with my ideas about under
graduate education," said Todd
Davies, associate director of Sym
bolic Systems.

"The debate may lie whether
Stanford should move forward with
an explicit policy of approving cred
it for these courses and appoint
ment of instructors," he added. "I'm
opposed to that move."

Much of the concern is rooted in
that certain ROTC programs would
require cadets to enter the Universi
ty with a predetermined major,
which could conflict with Stanford's
emphasis on academic exploration.
Those who receive ROTC scholar
ships could also be penalized for not
fulfilling their service requirements,
a move that amounts to "financial
coercion" of students, one professor
said.

Political science professor Scott
Sagan said the committee conduct
ed "extensive research" of the
ROTC program and its administra
tion at M.I.T. in order to better un
derstand how universities treat the
issue of course credit.

"There is a range of accredita
tion and relationships between
ROTC trainers and a range of views
within different universities regard
ing credit," Sagan said.
He said that a faculty committee
at M.I.T. "reviews the curriculum
and the qualifications of the visiting
lecturers or professors that are
nominated by the services to teach
an ROTC course on campus." If
considered well-qualified, a speak
er is given a two-year appointment.
Committee member Imani
Frankin 'l3 added that these cours
es are open to students not enrolled
in ROTC, as would be the case if
Stanford chooses to again recog
nize ROTC.
"We would encourage those
courses that allow for collaboration
between ROTC and non-ROTC
students," she said. "I think that's
the value of bringing back ROTC."
Bernstein described his own ex
perience with ROTC, in which he
participated for two years during
the 19505. He described it as aca
demically unchallenging.
"No academic experience I've
had in America has been as
wretched as that was," he said.
Bernstein urged an examination
of military courses syllabi to see

how the current courses compare
to Stanford's academic standards.
"It would give a good sense of
what would be forthcoming," he

said. "If ROTC emulates West
Point and Annapolis in its text
books, then there's a good chance
many courses will be certified."

Iyer related some of his person
al experiences, including his com
mute to Berkeley for training and
for his required military-science
courses.
"Nowadays, the idea is that any
officer has the same type of train
ing regardless of school attended,"
he said. Many of the classes, books,
resources for NROTC are "pretty
similar to those found at West
Point, and in my experience I've
learned a lot and more as an upper
classman. The classes are a little
easy, but still a challenge because
the idea is to learn things in a stress
ful environment."
Thomas said the committee
would consider the viewpoints facul
ty raised Thursday and acknowl
edged: "We have a lot of work to do."
The committee is expected to
report to the Faculty Senate in
May.
