"You're either a dancer or not
a dancer. You're either good or
you're not. Martha Graham said
something profound like that," said
Judith Jamison when defining tal
ent on Monday in a Presidential
Lecture produced by the Stanford
Humanities Center, after teaching
a master class to Stanford students
earlier that day. "Can you not
breathe another day if you don't
dance?" asked Jamison beyond
the practical aspects of training
and knowledge, she stressed there
should be an urgency to express
through movement what cannot
be articulated with words.
Artistic director of Alvin Ailey
American Dance Theater
(AAADT) since 1989, Jamison
embodies an iconic image of
American dance history in the sec
ond half of the 20th century. She
was born and raised in
Philadelphia at a time when black
girls were not allowed to take bal
let classes in any established studio
and when men refused to touch
them in partnering classes in New
York. College brought Jamison
south to Tennessee during the
height of the Civil Rights
Movement, but she soon found her
way to New York to pursue a
career in dance.

Over the years, Jamison has
worked with illustrious choreogra
phers and dancers including
Antony Tudor, Agnes de Mille and
Mikhail Baryshnikov (with whom
she danced the 1976 duet "Pas de
Duke," choreographed by Alvin
Ailey to music by Duke Ellington).
She joined Alvin Ailey
American Dance Theater when the
company was still in its infancy,
and developed a deep and spiritual
artistic relationship with its
founder. Ailey created the solo
"Cry" for Jamison in 1971, which
electrified audiences and propelled
her to international acclaim.
It was Jamison who was called
to return to the company when
Ailey's health began to fail, and to
whom he chose to hand the reigns
upon his death.
"We are living on Alvin's reso
nance," Jamison said of the funda
mental allegiance to Ailey's origi
nal goals. "My stamp on the com
pany was to continue to foster the
things that were at its foundation
and build on them." She expects
the same attitude from her chosen
successor, Robert Battle, who will
take over when she steps down in
July.
At the core of AAADT's mis
sion are a number of programs

designed to reach past the main
company performances: a school,
second company and joint B.F.A.
program with Fordham University
in New York offer young dancers
the opportunity to train and tran
sition from student to professional.
And an extensive Arts in
Education program including

Ailey camps across the nation and
the Revelations curriculum
engages children of all back
grounds in movement and dance.
Monday night, Jamison
remembered tours that, from the
early days, "brought people from
so many walks of life together
people of all races, colors and
creeds sitting one beside the other
in the theatre." The goal has always
been to connect with audiences
and communities, to use move
ment of bodies as a form of
expression to convey truths and to
incite enthusiasm by making dance
"accessible, but not easy."
The relationships AAADT and
other companies build with the
communities they serve, Jamison
believes, are crucial to the future of
dance. She strives to cultivate audi

ences that flock to theaters not
only for repertory classics, but also
to see and support new works and
choreographic experiments by
both established and fledgling
artists. "As long as there are
enough dreamers devoted to excel
lence without restraint," dance will
evolve and flourish, she said.
AAADT's North American
tour will arrive at Zellerbach Hall
in Berkeley March 29 through
April 3, 2011. Three distinct pro
grams will feature "Cry," the quin
tessential "Revelations" and works
by its artistic director-to-be,
Robert Battle.

Can you not
breathe
another day if
you don't
dance?
