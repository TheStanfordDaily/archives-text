# HUSKIES HELD BACK
## CARD FINDS MAPLES MAGIC IN WASHINGTON UPSET 
### ZACH ZIMMERMAN DESK EDITOR 
Josh Owens brought Maples Pavilion back
to its glory days on Thursday night, tipping in
a missed Jeremy Green three-point attempt
with 29 seconds left as the Stanford men's bas
ketball team upset No. 17 Washington, 58-56,
creating a three-way tie in the loss column
atop the Pac-10 Conference.
"I just tried to make a play," Owens said. "I
personally thought the shot was going in. I got
good position on my man and got a fortunate
roll."
The Jluskies (12-4, 4-1 Pac-10) are the
highest-ranked team defeated by the Cardi
nal (10-5,3-1) in head coach Johnny Dawkins'
tenure.

"I thought it was a terrific game," Dawkins
said. "Both teams came out and played with a
lot of heart, ft was a defensive battle by both
teams and we were fortunate in the end."
The Stanford defense was staunch
throughout, holding the Huskies' scoring of
fense ranked third in the nation coming
into the game to nearly 33 points below its
season average. The Cardinal forced 15
turnovers, including two key blocks by Owens
in the final minutes, and made crucial stops
down the stretch to close what was once an
11-point Washington lead.
When asked about the difference in the
game, junior guard Green was quick to re
spond.
"Defense," he said. "That's why we win
games."

After a traveling violation by Stanford
freshman forward Dwight Powell, the
Huskies had a chance to tie or win the game
with 1.1 seconds left. Washington found the
hot hand in senior forward Justin Holiday but
his contested shot fell short to seal the game
for the Card.

The game didn't look promising from the
tip, as three minutes of scoreless play to begin
the game were marred by sloppy play by both
squads. Stanford finally found its rhythm,
thanks in large part to the effort of Owens,
who led the Cardinal with 14 points on 7-of-9
shooting.
The junior dominated the Washington big
men in the first half with a series of baseline

NOTES: Following a loss to Arizona last
week, Stanford bounced back in a big way
yesterday as it took down No. 1 7 Wash
ington. Josh Owens led the way with 14
points and a game-winning basket as the
Cardinal dealt the Huskies theirfirst con
ference loss. Stanford may have its hands
full once again on Saturday, though, when
it takes on Washington State.

It was a banner night for the Cardinal, with four players scoring nine or more points as Stanford upset No. 17
Washington, 58-56, at home. Junior guard Jarrett Mann, above, went 5-for-6 from the line and finished with nine.

jumpers and a soft touch around
the rim. He was also responsible for
a potential highlight of the year
a one-handed slam over seven-foot
Washington center Aziz N'Diaye
that sent the crowd at Maples Pavil
ion into a frenzy.
"To tell you the truth I didn't
think I was going to dunk it at first,"
Owens said. "I beat my man off the
dribble and I just realized, 'Hey,
why not try to finish strong,' and
just went up."
The Cardinal led by as many as
six points in the opening half, but
Washington hung tough behind
play from junior guard Isaiah
Thomas. The reigning Pac-10 Tour
nament Most Outstanding Player
left Stanford freshman Aaron
Bright befuddled and single-hand
edly kept his team in the game de

spite foul trouble for his star team
mate, junior forward Matthew
Bryan-Amaning.
Stanford led by three with just
seconds left in the half, but a
Thomas floater over the out
stretched arms of Cardinal fresh
man forward Dwight Powell at the
buzzer closed the gap to 29-28. De
spite losing most of its lead, the Car
dinal managed to keep the Huskies'
high-powered offense to just 35.7
percent shooting.
Washington head coach Loren
zo Romar's halftime adjustments
paid off immediately for his squad.
The Huskies, behind consecutive
threes from senior forward Justin
Holiday, began to pull away in the
first 10 minutes of the starting peri
od, leading by as many as 11 points
with 10:37 left on the clock.

However, the home team would
n't go down without a fight.
Down 51-41 with 8:55 remaining
in the game, Stanford went on a run
of its own. Aggressive play by
Owens and junior guard Jarrett

Mann, coupled with freshman for
ward Anthony Brown's putback,
brought the Cardinal within a point
with 4:17 to go.
A three by Green gave Stanford
its first lead since the 18:43 mark in
the second half, and the team never
looked back.

With just 2.5 seconds left in the
game, Holiday had a chance to tie
the game with a pair of free throws.
He missed the front end, and de
spite the regaining of possession by
the Huskies, Stanford's defense
proved too suffocating.
"I think we did a great job on
every possession," Dawkins said.
"We really focused in on defense
and made it as difficult on them as
we could to make any baskets."
Despite one of the most memo
rable wins in recent history, Stan
ford has just one day to regroup.

It was a banner night for the Cardinal, with four players scoring nine or more points as Stanford upset No. 17
Washington, 58-56, at home. Junior guard Jarrett Mann, above, went 5-for-6 from the line and finished with nine.

the rim. He was also responsible for
a potential highlight of the year
a one-handed slam over seven-foot
Washington center Aziz N'Diaye
that sent the crowd at Maples Pavil
ion into a frenzy.
"To tell you the truth I didn't
think I was going to dunk it at first,"
Owens said. "I beat my man off the
dribble and I just realized, 'Hey,
why not try to finish strong,' and
just went up."
The Cardinal led by as many as
six points in the opening half, but
Washington hung tough behind
play from junior guard Isaiah
Thomas. The reigning Pac-10 Tour
nament Most Outstanding Player
left Stanford freshman Aaron
Bright befuddled and single-hand

mate, junior forward Matthew
Bryan-Amaning.
Stanford led by three with just
seconds left in the half, but a
Thomas floater over the out
stretched arms of Cardinal fresh
man forward Dwight Powell at the
buzzer closed the gap to 29-28. De
spite losing most of its lead, the Car
dinal managed to keep the Huskies'
high-powered offense to just 35.7
percent shooting.
Washington head coach Loren

paid off immediately for his squad.
The Huskies, behind consecutive
threes from senior forward Justin
Holiday, began to pull away in the
first 10 minutes of the starting peri

with 10:37 left on the clock.

However, the home team would
n't go down without a fight.
Down 51-41 with 8:55 remaining
in the game, Stanford went on a run
of its own. Aggressive play by
Owens and junior guard Jarrett

Mann, coupled with freshman for
ward Anthony Brown's putback,
brought the Cardinal within a point
with 4:17 to go.
A three by Green gave Stanford
its first lead since the 18:43 mark in
the second half, and the team never
looked back.

With just 2.5 seconds left in the
game, Holiday had a chance to tie
the game with a pair of free throws.
He missed the front end, and de
spite the regaining of possession by
the Huskies, Stanford's defense
proved too suffocating.
"I think we did a great job on
every possession," Dawkins said.
"We really focused in on defense

we could to make any baskets."

Josh Owens brought Maples Pavilion back
to its glory days on Thursday night, tipping in
a missed Jeremy Green three-point attempt
with 29 seconds left as the Stanford men's bas
ketball team upset No. 17 Washington, 58-56,
creating a three-way tie in the loss column
atop the Pac-10 Conference.
"I just tried to make a play," Owens said. "I
personally thought the shot was going in. I got
good position on my man and got a fortunate
roll."
The Jluskies (12-4, 4-1 Pac-10) are the
highest-ranked team defeated by the Cardi
nal (10-5,3-1) in head coach Johnny Dawkins'
tenure.

"I thought it was a terrific game," Dawkins
said. "Both teams came out and played with a
lot of heart, ft was a defensive battle by both
teams and we were fortunate in the end."
The Stanford defense was staunch
throughout, holding the Huskies' scoring of
fense ranked third in the nation coming
into the game to nearly 33 points below its
season average. The Cardinal forced 15
turnovers, including two key blocks by Owens
in the final minutes, and made crucial stops
down the stretch to close what was once an
11-point Washington lead.
When asked about the difference in the
game, junior guard Green was quick to re
spond.
"Defense," he said. "That's why we win
games."

After a traveling violation by Stanford
freshman forward Dwight Powell, the
Huskies had a chance to tie or win the game
with 1.1 seconds left. Washington found the
hot hand in senior forward Justin Holiday but
his contested shot fell short to seal the game
for the Card.

The game didn't look promising from the
tip, as three minutes of scoreless play to begin
the game were marred by sloppy play by both
squads. Stanford finally found its rhythm,
thanks in large part to the effort of Owens,
who led the Cardinal with 14 points on 7-of-9
shooting.
