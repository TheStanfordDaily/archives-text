# HUSKIES HELD BACK
## CARD FINDS MAPLES MAGIC IN WASHINGTON UPSET 
### ZACH ZIMMERMAN DESK EDITOR 
Josh Owens brought Maples Pavilion back
to its glory days on Thursday night, tipping in
a missed Jeremy Green three-point attempt
with 29 seconds left as the Stanford men's bas
ketball team upset No. 17 Washington, 58-56,
creating a three-way tie in the loss column
atop the Pac-10 Conference.
"I just tried to make a play," Owens said. "I
personally thought the shot was going in. I got
good position on my man and got a fortunate
roll."
The Jluskies (12-4, 4-1 Pac-10) are the
highest-ranked team defeated by the Cardi
nal (10-5,3-1) in head coach Johnny Dawkins'
tenure.

"I thought it was a terrific game," Dawkins
said. "Both teams came out and played with a
lot of heart, ft was a defensive battle by both
teams and we were fortunate in the end."
The Stanford defense was staunch
throughout, holding the Huskies' scoring of
fense ranked third in the nation coming
into the game to nearly 33 points below its
season average. The Cardinal forced 15
turnovers, including two key blocks by Owens
in the final minutes, and made crucial stops
down the stretch to close what was once an
11-point Washington lead.
When asked about the difference in the
game, junior guard Green was quick to re
spond.
"Defense," he said. "That's why we win
games."

After a traveling violation by Stanford
freshman forward Dwight Powell, the
Huskies had a chance to tie or win the game
with 1.1 seconds left. Washington found the
hot hand in senior forward Justin Holiday but
his contested shot fell short to seal the game
for the Card.

The game didn't look promising from the
tip, as three minutes of scoreless play to begin
the game were marred by sloppy play by both
squads. Stanford finally found its rhythm,
thanks in large part to the effort of Owens,
who led the Cardinal with 14 points on 7-of-9
shooting.
The junior dominated the Washington big
men in the first half with a series of baseline
