## Characters shine in 'One Acts' 
### â€“ laura MALKIEWICH contact laura: Imalkiew@stanford. edu 
Heidi Thorsen 'l2, producer
of Ram's Head Theatrical
Society's "The Original
Winter One Acts," claims that the
ater is "inherently collaborative."
Her focus on unity in the produc
er's note of the program is directly
reflected in the highly unified
show she has put together. This

year's "One Acts" go back to the
basics of the one-room play, with
each play taking place in a single
living room with a single couch.
The contrast against these living
spaces solidifies the characteristic
differences between each play and
its protagonist. Still, the similarity
between the personal spaces
emphasizes connections between
people and the situations that
make us all human.

The first play, "Dear
ChickFlickChick" follows the story
of a smart and sensible movie crit
ic who is being coerced by her

roommate into thinking that her

life might be modeling a love story.
1 swear it's not half as sappy as it
sounds. Rather, the play is actually
honest about how dealing with
love in movies and real life can be
heartbreakingly different. Director
and writer Olivia Haas' 11 may be
too pessimistic when she claims in
her note that her play doesn't
address "serious issues that need
serious attention." The play is
smart to focus attention on the
idea that people need to think as
critically about their own relation
ships as they do about fictional
ones. Moreover, the play's execu
tion is well done; the setting is so
girl-friendly that 1 almost wish it
was my Wheat Thins-infested liv
ing room. Additionally the acting
is sincere enough to make me feel
awkward in my seat. Win.
The second play of the night,
"The Safety," takes a bit of a fantas
tical turn. Rodrigo Pena 'll writes
a play that starts out as a crime

thriller and turns into a comedy of
character sketches. The script is

hilarious, including entertaining
renditions of your typical drunk
frat boy, desperate party girl,
dopey crook, pregnant woman,
that girl that just won't shut up
until someone has to hit her and
the white-collar schemer. All of
them are portrayed in a quite posh
living room where the story of a
murder-turned-robbery-turned
party goes wrong. Director Patrick
Kelly 'l2 hits the mark by honing
in on the hilarity of the characters'
stupidity in each increasingly
ridiculous situation. Although the
audience may honestly be as con
fused as the characters by the end
of the play, living the play line by
line will ensure entertainment.
The final play of the night
takes a more serious tone and is
the most moving. "Fit It," written
by Samantha Toh 'll, deals with
the story of Molly, a housewife

who is desperately trying to make
her life into something it once was
by focusing on the love she once
felt. For a student production, "Fix
It" is surprisingly poignant. Set in
a disheveled living room of pas
sion and a cold kitchen of shame,
this play epitomizes what makes
people more heartbreaking than
the relationships they are in. Kerry
Mahuron 'lO is incredibly touching
as Molly; she unravels before the
audience slowly but brilliantly.
With that, "One Acts" ends with
the strongest show of the night.
Overall, "One Acts" this year
does exactly what the producer has
planned. The three plays show a
diverse and yet unified look at true
characters. Each play is well crafted
and concise. None of the shows

1 swear it's not half as sappy as it
sounds. Rather, the play is actually
honest about how dealing with
love in movies and real life can be
heartbreakingly different. Director
and writer Olivia Haas' 11 may be
too pessimistic when she claims in
her note that her play doesn't
address "serious issues that need
serious attention." The play is
smart to focus attention on the
idea that people need to think as
critically about their own relation
ships as they do about fictional
ones. Moreover, the play's execu
tion is well done; the setting is so
girl-friendly that 1 almost wish it
was my Wheat Thins-infested liv
ing room. Additionally the acting
is sincere enough to make me feel
awkward in my seat. Win.
The second play of the night,
"The Safety," takes a bit of a fantas
tical turn. Rodrigo Pena 'll writes
a play that starts out as a crime

thriller and turns into a comedy of
character sketches. The script is

hilarious, including entertaining
renditions of your typical drunk
frat boy, desperate party girl,
dopey crook, pregnant woman,
that girl that just won't shut up
until someone has to hit her and
the white-collar schemer. All of
them are portrayed in a quite posh
living room where the story of a
murder-turned-robbery-turned
party goes wrong. Director Patrick
Kelly 'l2 hits the mark by honing
in on the hilarity of the characters'
stupidity in each increasingly
ridiculous situation. Although the
audience may honestly be as con
fused as the characters by the end
of the play, living the play line by
line will ensure entertainment.
The final play of the night
takes a more serious tone and is
the most moving. "Fit It," written
by Samantha Toh 'll, deals with
the story of Molly, a housewife

who is desperately trying to make
her life into something it once was
by focusing on the love she once
felt. For a student production, "Fix
It" is surprisingly poignant. Set in
a disheveled living room of pas
sion and a cold kitchen of shame,
this play epitomizes what makes
people more heartbreaking than
the relationships they are in. Kerry
Mahuron 'lO is incredibly touching
as Molly; she unravels before the
audience slowly but brilliantly.
With that, "One Acts" ends with
the strongest show of the night.
Overall, "One Acts" this year
does exactly what the producer has
planned. The three plays show a
diverse and yet unified look at true
characters. Each play is well crafted
and concise. None of the shows
