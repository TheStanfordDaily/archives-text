## Polar bears gain new voice, new advocates 
### â€” sarah GUAN contact sarah: sguan@stanford. edu 
"The Great White Bear," by
conservationist and environmental
writer Kieran Mulvaney, delves
into the lives of one of the poster
species in the crusade against glob
al warming. For all his activist cre
dentials, including a stint as a
prominent anti-whaling advocate
with Greenpeace, he remains in his
writing a consummate profession
al, stoking interest in, and garner
ing sympathy for, the polar bear
with truly skillful storytelling and
National Geographic-worthy
panoramic prose. Only at the end,
when discussing the fate of the
bear as it intersects with global
politics and policy, does he show
his hand.
Though the reader, quite rea
sonably, expects any book on polar
bears to come with a certain envi
ronmentalist agenda, Mulvaney's
work stands out precisely because
it does not preach, at least not
until the last 50-or-so pages, by
which point the reader is so capti
vated by his furry protagonists that
she is happy to keep reading.
That's not to say it is at all dif
ficult to win over the readership
when the leading lady is, for the

first few chapters, the endearingly
protective mother of a pair of
rowdy cubs. Mulvaney starts the
reader on a boat bobbing recklessly

in an ocean full of icebergs
never mind that he reassures his
audience of the competence of his
skipper; he has anyone who's ever
seen "Titanic" on the edge of his
seat and then zooms in on the
expectant mother, who peers curi
ously at the boatload of
researchers before deciding that
they are not a threat, and wanders
away to excavate her den in the
snow.
Mulvaney shows us other
bears males, as mother bears
won't emerge until they give birth
in early spring. There is a pitifully
emaciated bear, trapped by the
dwindling Arctic ice, contrasted
with a larger, healthy one, por
trayed in all his quiet majesty, the
unquestioned king of his domain.
And finally, after an interlude
sprinkled with the accounts of
Inuit hunters, pertinent research of
the preceding decades and fun
facts about the life and times of
this most unusual of bear species,
a dark nose emerges from the
snow, followed by a white head
a big one and two little ones. The
cubs will have a difficult and dan
gerous life, Mulvaney predicts, and
we believe him, however desper
ately we want them to succeed.
He goes on to examine
human-bear interactions, an

increasingly common phenome
non as human populations contin
ue to expand into once-virgin
Arctic lands. He writes intimately
of the community at Cape
Churchill, a small town whose
industry revolves around catering
to eco-tourists and polar
researchers, whose very livelihood
depends upon the polar bears its
patrons come to see. This transi
tions effortlessly into a discussion
of the wider impacts of human
society on polar bears, such as
Arctic research, poaching and most
notably, global warming, which
hits polar bears harder than it does
any other species in existence. Here
is where his preceding accounts
the tenuousness of Arctic life, the
absolutely adorable cubs pay
off. Mulvaney has, in the preceding
100-or-so pages, accumulated
enough sympathy genuine sym
pathy, rather than shallow appeals
via tear-jerking or fear-mongering
that the reader does not feel
deceived, or that there was any sort
of agenda or ulterior motive to the
book. He advocates for the polar
bear without gracelessly pounding
the message home, which is an
achievement in itself.
There is enough diversity in
"The Great White Bear" to appeal
to a wide audience, from scientists
to activists to politicians and even
to just the average reader with a
soft spot for cute animals or a
passing interest in current events.
The book is a wonderful blend of
popular science and memoir; it is
eminently topical, but will remain
timeless in its presentation.
