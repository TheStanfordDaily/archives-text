## University Cafe disappoints 
### â€” joshua GLUCOFT contact joshua: glucoft@stanford. edu 
While tomatoes seem so
integral to Italian cui
sine, they were actually
only introduced to the region in
the 16th century. The fruit was
well-suited, though, to the flavor
profiles of the region's other main
ingredients, and it made sense to
incorporate it so thoroughly.
University Cafe seems to have a
different approach to Italian food
and doesn't seem concerned with
adding anything new or interesting
to the multitude of options already
available. That lack of inspiration
produces a mediocre dining expe
rience.
Most things on the menu are
acceptable but far from remark-

able, especially the pasta selection.
The roasted butternut squash ravi
oli has so much potential but is
poorly executed. The pasta itself is
too thin and resembles a flavorless
wonton, while the butternut
squash filling does not really deliv
er the feelings of fall and winter
that you would want from a gourd
filling. The dish also comes in a
pool of butter that weighs the dish
down more than necessary.
The prawn linguini was simi
larly forgettable. The "light cream
sauce" was actually fairly heavy
(even if they didn't use heavy
cream) and overall came off a bit
cookie-cutter.
The sandwich offerings suffer

from the same problem. The
Tuscan chicken sandwich, for
example, is flavorful but not note
worthy. The sun-dried tomato aioli
is not as sweet as perhaps it should
be and does not make the sand
wich anything worth returning for.
Likewise, the "Palo Alto's Club
Sandwich" is decent but certainly
not a cut above a typical club
sandwich, and it comes out per
haps a bit too greasy with the aioli
on the brioche toast. Even the side
of roasted potatoes that comes
with the sandwiches is under
whelming. While nothing failed,
those in the mood for a sandwich
are much better served elsewhere.
The one divergence from typi
cal Italian-American fusion at
University Cafe, the occasional
Thai influence, is awkward and
produces some notable failures.
Specifically, the vegetarian curry is
horrendous. The curry materially
lacks flavor and absolutely pales in
comparison to some of the nearby
restaurants such as Bangkok
Cuisine. Searing the tofu prevents
it from absorbing much of the fla
vor. The dish is not plated well,
and nothing about it is appetizing.

And while it is likely not a com
mon occurrence, the rice served to
me was undercooked and crunchy,
adding insult to injury.
University Cafe does have
some positive aspects. The atmos
phere in particular is actually fairly
cute. High ceilings and a moder
ately charming decor create a
pleasant ambiance that could make
for a simple first date (if the food
were better) or a lunch or dinner
with friends who have a bit of
time.
Ultimately, though, I am
forced to politely disagree with
Juliet's famous argument, "What's
in a name?" University Cafe is just
a cafe on University Avenue as
unimaginative and uninspired as
the food. While smart ordering
may lead you to an acceptable
meal, with so many other options,
it's not clear why one should take
the risk; there is no dish that really
stands out. Accordingly, "don't
bother" giving this one a shot.
