## DAFT PUNK UNVEILS 'LEGACY' 
### â€“ andrea HINTON contact andrea: anhinton@stanford. edu 
Electronic is the future. In
doubt? Listen to the "TRON:
Legacy" soundtrack, com
posed by French duo Daft Punk.

Like the movie of the same name,
the album is an innovative piece of
technical work in a growing field. As
an odd blend of two completely dif
ferent fields electronic and classi
cal music the soundtrack had the
potential to fall completely flat.
However, where amateurs might fail,
Daft Punk manages to create an
impressive album yet again, disre
garding a few minor setbacks.
Disney specifically recruited
Daft Punk real names Guy-

Manuel de Homem-Christo and

Thomas Bangalter for the sound
track, which comes as no surprise.
The veteran duo leapt into the spot
light in the late 20th century and

never looked back, with massive hits
like "Technologic" and "Harder,
Better, Faster, Stronger" on the radio
and sampled in their contempo
raries' works. As the pair got older,
their music get better, and "TRON:
Legacy" is hardly an exception to the
rule.

"TRON: Legacy" is first and
foremost a soundtrack to a movie,
and to expect the same never-ending
intensity as a typical Daft Punk piece
would be naive. The album is less

explosive, moodier, building slowly
to a crescendo as does the film; each
particular song reflects the intensity
behind a single line of dialogue and

enhances it, instead of attempting to
create that feeling from the ground
up. Despite the confinement to a
scripted story, however, "TRON:

Legacy" is good enough to work as a
stand-alone album, not just an

accompaniment to another piece.
The soundtrack is noteworthy
because of its individual tracks that
mesmerize listeners in short, the
tracks that sound most typical of
Daft Punk. The more action

involved, the more exceptional the
songs. Track 16, "Rectifier," can be
compared to a controlled storm; it is
a rigid, military-like piece building
to a buzz of noise that has listeners
anxious about the next turn of both
the movie and the song. Similarly,
"C.L.U.," the longest track of the
album, represents the culmination of

sound and action that the sound
track builds to, with dramatic pauses
and descending lines to bring the
tension to its most acute stage.

The best song on the album by
far is the eighth track, "The Game
Has Changed," as it goes furthest in
epitomizing the strangeness and
technicality of the universe of the
film. It is simultaneously hectic, as
agitated violins keep up a furious
pace in the background, and the
calm before the storm, as the synth
soothes its classical counterparts.
The juxtaposition of sound, com
bined with an oscillating crescendo,
keeps listeners anticipating its slow
building resolution and is, in a word,
perfect.

But for all the musical genius
that went into a few tracks, the rest
is surprisingly dull. Although the
movie certainly contains many aes
thetic scenes that are really only

meant to be fawned over and are
largely a repetition of the same idea,
the soundtrack could have added a
little more punch. Many of the songs
on the album blend into one anoth
er, and a lack of dynamic change or
unique sound hurt a few of the
tracks, particularly "Nocturne," a
painfully slow, nondescript piece
that could have come out of any
dramatic movie to ever pass through
a movie theater.
Despite a few sleepers, though,
the "TRON: Legacy" soundtrack is
an electronic work of art, a unique
construction that helps set the
movie apart from the onslaught of
modern technical films. Daft Punk
proves once again that even lacking
their typical liveliness, they are mas
ters of their field and are here to
stay. Yes, men approaching middle
age still have a place in the music
industry.
