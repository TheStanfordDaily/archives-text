## New Year, New You, New TV 
### â€“ liz STARK contact liz: estark12@stanford. edu 
With the BCS ending Monday night,
your pigskin-obsessed peers will
soon return the remote to your
hands and release you of obligations to spend
your nights with the middle-aged announcers
on ESPN. Simultaneously, scripted television
will slowly come out of hibernation to offer
you a cornucopia of the new, the beloved and
even the long forgotten. Yes, J.Lo and Steven
Tyler are crusading to rehabilitate their careers
on the new season of "American Idol," and
Brad Womack is doing the dame on the latest
installment of "The Bachelor." But the fact
that "Idol" has moved to Wednesdays because
of a pubescent giant named "Glee" attests to
the power of the characters and alternate
worlds we wait to reunite with for 22 or 42
minutes each week.
Here's a syllabus of series and season pre
mieres for the next two months, intended to
indulge your inner teenager, sci-fi obsession
or attraction to law enforcement officials.

"Pretty Little Liars" (ABC Family, Mondays at
8)

My favorite new show of summer 2010,
"Pretty Little Liars" is both absurd in its lack
of reality 2 5-year-old actresses playing
teenagers, for one and addictive in that
exaggeration of ephemeral high-school
friendships. Aria, Emily, Spencer and, yes,
Hanna continue their quest to find A and
exorcise Alison's ghost.
"Greek" (ABC Family, Mondays at 9)
This incongruous piece of ABC Family
programming enters its final season of
romanticizing hangovers and the cleanliness
of fraternity and sorority houses.
"Californication" (Showtime, Sundays at
9:30)
David Duchovny returns as every English
major's favorite author father and sex addict.
Having finally revealed his one-night stand
with a 17-year-old to Karen, the mother of his
sassy Goth daughter Becca, Hank will face
serious consequences for the first time in his
life.

"V" (ABC, Tuesdays at 9)
If you gave this attempt to fill the void of
"Lost" a chance last spring, it's back for anoth
er season of schizophrenic alien invaders.

"Southland" (TNT, Tuesdays at 10)
This cop procedural set in the diverse Los
Angeles neighborhoods rose like a phoenix
from cancellation and has found a new home
at the on-the-rise cable network TNT.
Benjamin McKenzie from "The 0.C." returns
to television with his characteristic furrowed
brow.
"Cape" (NBC, Sundays at 9)
NBC is pulling out all the stops to sell
this fusion of cop drama and live-action
comic book. Vince Faraday, a cop framed and
assumed dead, assumes the persona of a
superhero when former circus magicians train
him to use a cape to fight evil; essentially, it
has all the makings of camp, which doesn't
bode well for its longevity.
"Shameless" (Showtime, Sundays at 10)
William H. Macy anchors this adaptation
of a British series of the same name about a
hopelessly scruffy single dad and the children
who prop him up, including the now-sassy
Emmy Rossum. The previews make it look
like a hilarious yet heart-breaking counter
point to network blue-collar family sitcoms.

"Lights Out" (FX, Tuesdays at 11)
With the success of "The Fighter" at the
box office, I'm sure viewers will flock to this
raw, violent tale of a boxer making a come
back.
"Parks and Recreation" (NBC, Thursdays at
9:30 beginning Jan. 20)
My rage at NBC for delaying this show's
return in favor of "Outsourced" has been
replaced by utter jubilation at the return of
Ron Swanson, Leslie Knope and Tom
Haverford. The welcome addition of Adam
Scott and Rob Lowe (the funniest I've ever
seen him) suggests the show can shoulder
both the narrative burden of last season's
finale and the task of living up to last season's
unparalleled humor.
"Archer" (FX, Thursdays at 10 beginning Jan.
27)
Everyone's favorite animated, dirty
minded spy returns to his world of refreshing

ly retro espionage, as imagined by "Adult
Swim" contributor Adam Reed.
"Mr. Sunshine" (ABC, Wednesdays at 9:30
beginning Feb. 9)
Matthew Perry and Allison Janney, icons
from the most recent glory days of network
television with "Friends" and "The West
Wing," respectively, team up in this black
comedy about the manager and owner of an
ice rink, again respectively. Perry co-created
the series with executives familiar to the
Sorkin sensibility Thomas Schlamme and
Jamie Tarses but even the pilot script fails
to shine.
I would even argue there's more to look
forward to this winter than there was this fall.
If all else fails, there's probably a rerun of
"Seinfeld" or "Full House" on somewhere.



"PARKS AND RECREATION," COURTESY NBC

er season of schizophrenic alien invaders.

"Southland" (TNT, Tuesdays at 10)
This cop procedural set in the diverse Los
Angeles neighborhoods rose like a phoenix
from cancellation and has found a new home
at the on-the-rise cable network TNT.
Benjamin McKenzie from "The 0.C." returns
to television with his characteristic furrowed
brow.
"Cape" (NBC, Sundays at 9)
NBC is pulling out all the stops to sell
this fusion of cop drama and live-action
comic book. Vince Faraday, a cop framed and
assumed dead, assumes the persona of a
superhero when former circus magicians train
him to use a cape to fight evil; essentially, it
has all the makings of camp, which doesn't
bode well for its longevity.
"Shameless" (Showtime, Sundays at 10)
William H. Macy anchors this adaptation
of a British series of the same name about a
hopelessly scruffy single dad and the children
who prop him up, including the now-sassy
Emmy Rossum. The previews make it look
like a hilarious yet heart-breaking counter
point to network blue-collar family sitcoms.

"Lights Out" (FX, Tuesdays at 11)
With the success of "The Fighter" at the
box office, I'm sure viewers will flock to this
raw, violent tale of a boxer making a come
back.
"Parks and Recreation" (NBC, Thursdays at
9:30 beginning Jan. 20)
My rage at NBC for delaying this show's
return in favor of "Outsourced" has been
replaced by utter jubilation at the return of
Ron Swanson, Leslie Knope and Tom
Haverford. The welcome addition of Adam
Scott and Rob Lowe (the funniest I've ever
seen him) suggests the show can shoulder
both the narrative burden of last season's
finale and the task of living up to last season's
unparalleled humor.
"Archer" (FX, Thursdays at 10 beginning Jan.
27)
Everyone's favorite animated, dirty
minded spy returns to his world of refreshing

ly retro espionage, as imagined by "Adult
Swim" contributor Adam Reed.
"Mr. Sunshine" (ABC, Wednesdays at 9:30
beginning Feb. 9)
Matthew Perry and Allison Janney, icons
from the most recent glory days of network
television with "Friends" and "The West
Wing," respectively, team up in this black
comedy about the manager and owner of an
ice rink, again respectively. Perry co-created
the series with executives familiar to the
Sorkin sensibility Thomas Schlamme and
Jamie Tarses but even the pilot script fails
to shine.
I would even argue there's more to look
forward to this winter than there was this fall.
If all else fails, there's probably a rerun of
"Seinfeld" or "Full House" on somewhere.
