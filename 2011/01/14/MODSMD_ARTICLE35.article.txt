# ROXY SASS
## New Year's Resolutions 
### â€“ roxy SASS 
January: a month when the lines for tread
mills at the gym become clogged with good
intentions and fresh resolutions. New Year's
resolutions get a bad rap: they rarely pan out,
which leads to a disappointing February.
But Roxy's not one to let well-set goals go
to waste. Remember, a good goal is feasible,
measurable and most importantly, tangible
and anything that requires being able to be
touched leaves Roxy intrigued.
So, even though Roxy has long ago mas
tered the secrets of seduction, there's always
room for improvement.
Physical fitness
In the interest of expediency, Roxy's new
goal is to incorporate exercise into every minute
of the day. Sitting in class? Do your Kegels.
Lacking cardio? Sit next to that hottie in the
dining hall and feel your heart rate shoot up.
No time to separate business from pleasure?

Get a gym buddy for both public and more pri
vate workouts. And if you've got a car, stop
being lazy: biking everywhere gives Roxy all the
more chances to eye-hump the pickings in
White Plaza and down Mayfield.
Campus safety
Roxy's all for lowering campus security in
order to achieve one goal: more hot prowls.
Laptop thefts are a huge bummer, but that's no
reason to prevent people from being able to
give sexy 3 a.m. bedside surprises. Trust Roxy, a
hot prowl's a lot more fun when the person in
the room has completely consented to being
tied and gagged.
Academics
Simply put, Roxy plans to take a full load
this quarter. Her classes (and other things) are
only interesting if they're extremely hard. And
Roxy sees no reason to avoid the daily grind as
long as it also involves a nightly grind and
the more classes she takes, the bigger her selec
tion of TAs and professors to visit in some one
on-one office hours.

Career
Like any responsible Stanford student,
Roxy's looking to find a professional internship,
sure, but only because a business casual dress
code gives ample opportunities to rock heels
and a tight pencil skirt. Of course, gaining
experience is important as well, but let's be real:
Roxy prefers the kind that doesn't belong on a
CV. Come on, sir ... let's network.
Learning a new hobby
Roxy's a utilitarian at heart: if she's going
to expend energy learning a new skill, it's going
to have to benefit those around her. Picking up
yoga is a chance to wear yoga pants all day
apologies in advance for causing a few bike
crashes. Learning a new language allows Roxy
to share her gospel with a whole new group of
international cuties. But maybe the best new
hobbies learned are still the ones that are
shared behind locked doors. You'll have to ask
Roxy about it in person some day.
