## Tough test: Card hosts No. 2 BYU Conference season opens with big two-game series 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH STAFF WRITER 
After shaking the cobwebs off in last
week's season-opening win over UC-Santa
Cruz, the Stanford men's volleyball team
will begin defending last season's Moun
tain Pacific Sports Federation (MPSF) title
as it plays host to a hardened No. 2 BYU (3-
0,0-0 MPSF) team tonight.
The No. 4 Cardinal (1-0, 0-0) returns
three starters from last year's national
championship-winning team, along with 13
letter-winners overall. That includes two
American Volleyball Coaches Association
first-team All-Americans in outside hitter
Brad Lawson and libero Erik Shoji. The
two juniors said they have worked hard to
create a new team identity this offseason.
"Coming into the season we had a
whole new lineup so we wanted to work on
our chemistry and flow on the court," Shoji
said. "We're working hard to build rela
tionships on the court, but it is early in the
season so we realize there will be lots of ups
and downs. I believe that we have the ener
gy and mental toughness to fight through it,
though."

In the sweep against Santa Cruz, Shoji
reached double digits with 10 digs and
Lawson led the team with 11 kills, but both
weren't quite at their usual levels
of play. Perhaps returning to
Maples Pavilion for the first time
since the NCAA title match
against Penn State last May will
spark the duo. In that match. Law
son hit an otherworldly .821 with
24 kills in three sets, and Shoji had
several crucial digs that former
Cardinal opposite hitter Evan
Romero called simply "absurd."
However, BYU looks to be an
even bigger test than previously
thought. After finishing 2010 with a
No. 2 final national ranking, the
Cougars were hit hard by allega
tions of misconduct concerning im
proper use of scholarship money,

according to the Salt Lake Tribune.
In August, head coach Shawn
Patchell was fired and four players
were eventually suspended from
the first few matches of 2011 fol
lowing an NCAA investigation, in
cluding both of the team's experi
enced setters.

But just last weekend, BYU
rode the play of true freshman out
side hitter Taylor Sander to win the
eight-team Gaucho Invitational at
UC-Santa Barbara. Sander was
named the tournament's MVP and
the MPSF player of the week after
recording 42 kills, 16 digs and eight
blocks in three matches against
stiff competition.

The tournament victory pushed
the Cougars up to No. 2 in the lat
est AVCA national rankings be
hind use.

"Historically, BYU has just
been a strong serving and blocking
team, and this year is no different,"
said Stanford head coach John
Kosty. "Even though there have
been some changes in their start
ing lineup through graduation,
they have a core of starters that has
been a great strength for them.
They're just a good, solid team."
BYU holds a 24-13 edge in the
all-time series, but the two teams
have split the season series in each
of the past three years. Stanford,

however, is in the midst of a 13-
match win streak at Maples Pavil
ion and hasn't lost a set since the
first round of MPSF Tournament
play last April.
If the streaks are to continue,
the Cardinal will rely on several
younger players to step up and sup
port Lawson, Shoji and junior mid
dle blocker Gus Ellis. In the match
against Santa Cruz, freshman out
side hitters Brian Cook and Steven
Irvin both played well, with Cook
getting a kill on his first collegiate
touch and hitting .545 for the
match with seven kills.

But it could be tough going
against BYU's 6-foot-8 middle
blockers Otavio Souza and FutiTa
vana. The towering duo has com
bined for 46 blocks in just three
matches and has thrown in 30 kills
to boot.
"We've got to serve efficiently
to hopefully neutralize their offen
sive attack and then pass the ball to
the net so that we can run our own
offense," Kosty said.
Stanford will hope for another
solid game from its first-year setter,
junior Evan Barry (31 assists
against Santa Cruz), to neutralize
the Cougars' height and get a good
result in the conference opener for
both teams.
The first match will start tonight
at 7:30 p.m. in Maples Pavilion,
with the second and final match of
the weekend series slated for 7:30
p.m. tomorrow night in Burnham
Pavilion.
