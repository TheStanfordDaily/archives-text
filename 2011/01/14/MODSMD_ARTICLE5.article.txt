## Alum David Shaw to head Stanford football 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY KABIR SAWHNEY 
Stanford has named offensive coordinator
and running backs coach David Shaw '95 the
newest head coach of the Cardinal football pro
gram. Shaw was officially introduced at a press
conference on Thursday afternoon.
Shaw, who played wide receiver for Stanford

in the early 19905, takes over the title of Bradford
M. Freeman Director of Football from Jim Har
baugh, who left the Farm for the San Francisco
49ers after four seasons. Shaw served with Har
baugh throughout his time at Stanford, as well as
at the University of San Diego.
A favorite of players and alumni alike, Shaw
enters the top spot after a coaching search that
saw most of its focus on in-house candidates, so as
to provide continuity with the highly successful
Harbaugh era. Aside from Shaw, associate head
coach Greg Roman, defensive coordinator Vic
Fangio and special teams coordinator Brian Po-

lian were interviewed. Stanford had
a brief flirtation with Boise State's
Chris Petersen before he reaf
firmed his commitment to his cur
rent school.

Shaw, 38, confirmed that he
plans to keep using the philosophy
that Harbaugh instilled during his
tenure, building a physical, running
team on offense and an aggressive,
hard-hitting defense. He said that
he was not willing to rest on the ac
complishments of last season, when
the Cardinal capped its first 12-win
season in history with a victory in
the Orange Bowl.

"Take the 2010 season out
standing, phenomenal. We're going
to put it in a box, we're going to put
a ribbon on it, we're going to put it
on the shelf for everybody to ad
mire," Shaw said. "But our goals are
not met. We're not done ... we
have a desire to be the first Pac-12
champion."
Shaw also expressed his desire to
build a consistently strong program
at Stanford while embracing the
University's focus on academics.
"Two good years of football is
not enough," he said. "That's not
what we're aiming for. We're aiming
for consistency, for a team that's
going to make Stanford University
proud every time we step on the
field."

Athletic director Bob Bowlsby
said that he had serious discussions
with three external candidates
about Stanford's head coaching po
sition and contacted four other
coaches, but he declined to name
any of them.
"This is, in my estimation, the
most logical step that we can take,"
Bowlsby said at the press confer
ence. "[Shaw] is a proven recruiter.
He's got great college and NFL ex
perience. He understands and em
braces the athletic and academic

merger at Stanford University. His
contribution to the current state of
affairs in our football program is
immeasurable, and he is a person of
impeccable character and integri
ty."

In Shaw, Stanford has found a
young coach with eight years of
NFL experience who is also likely
to be seriously dedicated to the
Farm. He is the 34th coach in the
program's tenure, and no head man
has stayed for more than nine years.

"I went into the interview
process with the mindset that I
wanted this to be my last head
coaching interview ever," Shaw
said. Referring to the Stanford
women's basketball coach, he
added: "I want to be in the 25-and
up club that Tara VanDerveer is in."

Shaw began his coaching career
immediately after his graduation
from Stanford, heading first to
Western Washington before head
ing to the Philadelphia Eagles for
his first NFL job. He remained in
the professional ranks until he
joined Harbaugh's staff in San
Diego in 2006, then came to Stan
ford with Harbaugh the next year.
For his first three seasons with the
Cardinal, he operated as both the
wide receivers' coach and offensive
coordinator, but in 2010, while re
taining his coordinator title, he
switched his focus to running backs.
Now, he becomes the first Stan
ford alumnus to lead the Cardinal
program since Paul Wiggins '57,
who did so from 1980-1983.

Quarterback Andrew Luck, last

season's Heisman Trophy runner
up and the early favorite to win the
award in 2011, spoke about Shaw's
hire as well.

"He's a Stanford man," Luck
said. "I've known that since he was
recruiting me coming out of high
school. He has a deep, abiding love
and respect for Stanford. You can
really tell that. He's going to do a
wonderful job with this program
and the players are behind him 100
percent."

Luck commented on the differ
ences in style between Harbaugh
and Shaw.

"He's definitely a lot different
than Coach Harbaugh in a lot of as
pects," he said. "It's just different
personalities and people go about
things differently. I wouldn't say

there's one right way to do it."
Shaw's appointment comes at a
critical time for Stanford, which will
host about 20 recruits on campus
this weekend. Shaw will also have to
work to keep Roman, Fangio and
other members of Harbaugh's staff,
some of whom have received inter
est from other schools and profes
sional teams. However, he chose
not to elaborate on Stanford's at
tempts to retain those coaches and
its search to fill open assistant posi
tions, saying, "We'll talk about that
as the week goes on."

at the University of San Diego.
A favorite of players and alumni alike, Shaw
enters the top spot after a coaching search that
saw most of its focus on in-house candidates, so as
to provide continuity with the highly successful
Harbaugh era. Aside from Shaw, associate head

lian were interviewed. Stanford had
a brief flirtation with Boise State's
Chris Petersen before he reaf
firmed his commitment to his cur
rent school.

Shaw, 38, confirmed that he
plans to keep using the philosophy
that Harbaugh instilled during his
tenure, building a physical, running
team on offense and an aggressive,
hard-hitting defense. He said that
he was not willing to rest on the ac
complishments of last season, when
the Cardinal capped its first 12-win
season in history with a victory in
the Orange Bowl.

"Take the 2010 season out
standing, phenomenal. We're going
to put it in a box, we're going to put
a ribbon on it, we're going to put it
on the shelf for everybody to ad
mire," Shaw said. "But our goals are
not met. We're not done ... we
have a desire to be the first Pac-12
champion."
Shaw also expressed his desire to
build a consistently strong program
at Stanford while embracing the
University's focus on academics.
"Two good years of football is
not enough," he said. "That's not
what we're aiming for. We're aiming
for consistency, for a team that's
going to make Stanford University
proud every time we step on the
field."

Athletic director Bob Bowlsby
said that he had serious discussions
with three external candidates
about Stanford's head coaching po
sition and contacted four other
coaches, but he declined to name
any of them.
"This is, in my estimation, the
most logical step that we can take,"
Bowlsby said at the press confer
ence. "[Shaw] is a proven recruiter.
He's got great college and NFL ex
perience. He understands and em
braces the athletic and academic

merger at Stanford University. His
contribution to the current state of
affairs in our football program is
immeasurable, and he is a person of
impeccable character and integri
ty."

In Shaw, Stanford has found a
young coach with eight years of
NFL experience who is also likely
to be seriously dedicated to the
Farm. He is the 34th coach in the
program's tenure, and no head man
has stayed for more than nine years.

"I went into the interview
process with the mindset that I
wanted this to be my last head
coaching interview ever," Shaw
said. Referring to the Stanford
women's basketball coach, he
added: "I want to be in the 25-and
up club that Tara VanDerveer is in."

Shaw began his coaching career
immediately after his graduation
from Stanford, heading first to
Western Washington before head
ing to the Philadelphia Eagles for
his first NFL job. He remained in
the professional ranks until he
joined Harbaugh's staff in San
Diego in 2006, then came to Stan
ford with Harbaugh the next year.
For his first three seasons with the
Cardinal, he operated as both the
wide receivers' coach and offensive
coordinator, but in 2010, while re
taining his coordinator title, he
switched his focus to running backs.
Now, he becomes the first Stan
ford alumnus to lead the Cardinal
program since Paul Wiggins '57,
who did so from 1980-1983.

Quarterback Andrew Luck, last

season's Heisman Trophy runner
up and the early favorite to win the
award in 2011, spoke about Shaw's
hire as well.

"He's a Stanford man," Luck
said. "I've known that since he was
recruiting me coming out of high
school. He has a deep, abiding love
and respect for Stanford. You can
really tell that. He's going to do a
wonderful job with this program
and the players are behind him 100
percent."

Luck commented on the differ
ences in style between Harbaugh
and Shaw.

"He's definitely a lot different
than Coach Harbaugh in a lot of as
pects," he said. "It's just different
personalities and people go about
things differently. I wouldn't say

there's one right way to do it."
Shaw's appointment comes at a
critical time for Stanford, which will
host about 20 recruits on campus
this weekend. Shaw will also have to
work to keep Roman, Fangio and
other members of Harbaugh's staff,
some of whom have received inter
est from other schools and profes
sional teams. However, he chose
not to elaborate on Stanford's at
tempts to retain those coaches and
its search to fill open assistant posi
tions, saying, "We'll talk about that
as the week goes on."

Stanford has named offensive coordinator
and running backs coach David Shaw '95 the
newest head coach of the Cardinal football pro
gram. Shaw was officially introduced at a press
conference on Thursday afternoon.
Shaw, who played wide receiver for Stanford

in the early 19905, takes over the title of Bradford
M. Freeman Director of Football from Jim Har
