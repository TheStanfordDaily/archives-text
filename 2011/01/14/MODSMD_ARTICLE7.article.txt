## STUDENT LIFE New project addresses failure on the Farm Officials attempt to break down the 'duck syndrome' 
### BRIANNA PANG STAFF WRITER 
Stanford may be home to brilliant scholars, top
athletes and renowned faculty, but according to
Associate Director of Academic Support Adina
Glickman, Stanford also houses high-achieving,
"failure-deprived" students who may have never
dealt with disappointment before arriving on the
Farm.

After hearing students' stories of struggle,
Glickman has set out to show them that adversity
is a part of the road to success. She calls it the Re
silience Project.

Launched during Mid-year Freshman Convo
cation, the project is a new initiative to display sto
ries of failure that today's successful have under
gone, So far, stories Glickman has collected include
those of Vice Provost for Undergraduate Educa
tion Harry Elam Jr., former Supreme Court Justice
Sandra Day O'Connor '5O L.L.B. '52 and English
professor Tobias Wolff M. A. '7B.
She hopes to start collecting stories from stu
dents, too.

"It's an effort to address the 'duck syndrome'
and put the periscope under the surface to show
that we're all flapping our feet very hard," Glick
man said.

"As an academic coach, I often hear students
telling me, 'I feel so alone,"' Glickman added. "ITie
project will connect students to let them know that
it's OK to be disappointed. They learn that no one

gets it right the first time."
Dean of Freshmen and Undergraduate Advis
ing Julie Lythcott-Haims 'B9 shared the story of
her first D in a communication class, shattering

her original dreams of becoming a broadcast
journalist. She admitted to feeling ashamed

and embarrassed, ultimately deciding to
change academic tracks.
"I felt like an admissions mistake," said.
"I felt, in particular as a woman of color
from the Midwest, that I had been admit
ted to fill a quota as opposed to being ad
mitted for my ability to thrive here."
According to Lythcott-Haims, many
students are not only "failure-deprived" i
but also need to "toughen their emotion
al skin."
"The number of students who regard
B+ as a failing grades makes me laugh
but also makes me sad," she said. "We
need to combat that inaccurate sense
of failure."
The mission resonates with some
students. With one quarter under her

belt, Aya Yagi 'l4 admitted her struggles

with time management and study skills and felt
it was hard to balance her academic life and so-

cial life.
"College grades already are not looking like
the ones I had in high school, but I am not the least
bit irked about not having the 4.0," Yagi said.
"Doing your best and trying to improve are the
only things I can ask of myself, and hearing stories
of successful people who had bumps along the
road reinforce that idea for me,"
Lythcott-Haims' own story currently appears
on the Resilience Project website. Though it was
"nerve-wracking" to share, she emphasized that

sharing stories of struggles would help us "feel
healthier."

"It's clear students feel pressure to say 'lt's all
good, I'm doing great, and everything's fine,'" she
said. "It's a very positive over-generalization as to
what life is really like. We should get real, stop feel
ing that we have to put up the facade and show the
true us."
