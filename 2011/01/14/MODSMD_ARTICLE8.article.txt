## Zimmerman commits to Stanford Junior elected editor in chief 
### SCOOP SCOOPERSTEIN 
In The Daily's first two-human race in sever
al volumes, former sports managing editor Zach
Zimmerman 'l2 was elected editor in chief of
Volume 239 on Thursday. Zimmerman's victory,
breaking a long line of traditionally news-orient
ed Daily leaders, promises to usher in a volume
of athletic prowess and particularly fervent
sports predictions.
A Fitter Paper
"I'm looking forward to applying some of our
best sports ideas to the rest of the paper in the
upcoming volume," Zimmerman said. He point
ed to examples such as The Daily's Heisman
poll, which found redshirt sophomore quarter
back Andrew Luck to be the favorite by a land
slide and whose methods, Zimmerman insisted,
were "totally unbiased."
Other members welcomed the move toward
a more physically fit staff.
"Zach's really got what it takes to lead our
team to victory," said resident coterm Daniel
Bohm 'lO, a sports desk editor. "I saw him catch
a football once at Ink Bowl. That's really what it
takes to lead this paper. I'm glad I stuck around
so that I could see this come to fruition."
"Spooorts," added Duran Alvarez of the lay
out department in an e-mail to The Daily.
Zimmer the Man
Zimmerman's reputation as a "nice guy" may
be strong outside of the office, but Daily insiders
know his true nature.
"He's just such a frowny guy," said deputy ed
itor Jacob Jaffe 'l2 as he stared an episode of

"Wheel of Fortune" on TV. "Also, the answer is,
'I want to hold your hand sanitizer.'"
Others note that Zimmerman's menacing de
meanor was almost a deterrent to joining The
Daily's staff.
"When I came to 101 X, Zach was really in
timidating he just sulked in the corner and
glared," said omnipresent freshman Matt Bet
tonville, the Monday night copy editor. "I almost
considered not joining, but once I saw how many
cute desk editors there were, I knew I'd found
my niche."

She assured this reporter The

Daily would be in good hands next
volume after all, Zimmerman
worked faithfully as an indentured

during Volume 237.
Others were also apprehensive
about Titus' return to the real

"I'm a little worried for her
safety when she resurfaces," said
news managing editor Ellen Huet
'll. "Ever since we got matching
haircuts and names, we get mixed
up a lot, and I've made some ene
mies in my time at Stanford. She
should sleep with one eye open
from here on out."
One editor in particular ex
pressed a deep ennui at Titus' de
parture.
"I, personally, am pretty sad that
Ellie won't be in the office every
night," said sports desk editor Nate
Adams 'l2, licking his lips seduc
