## Castro urges safety in parent letter Hospital transports prompt concern 
### CAROLINE CHEN STAFF WRITER 
In response to a rise in pre-gaming
activities and incidences of alcohol poi
soning, the University encouraged par
ents in a recent newsletter to talk to
their Stanford students about alcohol
use.

Rapid consumption of hard alcohol
is becoming increasingly popular on
campus, said Ralph Castro, head of
Stanford's Substance Abuse Preven
tion Program. He said up to 10 percent
of students on campus are heavy
episodic drinkers. The number of alco
hol poisoning cases is also on the rise
Stanford saw 61 emergency-room visits
last year compared to 37 in the 2006-07
academic year.
"One hundred percent of the stu
dents who have gone to the ER have
consumed excessive amounts of hard
liquor, and about 90 percent had been
pre-gaming," Castro said.
However, research has shown that
parents can have a big impact on their
children's drinking habits in college.
The finding comes from research con
ducted by a consortium of schools,
along with the company that manages
AlcoholEdu.
Castro believes many parents who
grew up in the 1970s may be hesitant to
discuss alcohol issues with their chil
dren.
"Parents came of age when alcohol
and drugs were used in larger quanti
ties," he said. "They may be afraid to an
swer [questions like], 'Who are you
to tell me what to do when you were
smoking pot and doing LSD?"'
However, Castro believes, the
pre-gaming culture puts students
today at a higher risk of alcohol poi
soning than during their parents'
generation.
In addition to encouraging par
ents to engage in dialogue with their
children, the Substance Abuse Pre
vention Program has also launched
various initiatives this year, includ

ing a dorm outreach program and a
21st-birthday card initiative.
"Basically it says, 'Congratula
tions that you're 21, but just because
you're 21 doesn't mean you can
magically drink a lot more alcohol,"
Castro said.
The cards are e-mailed to stu
dents a few days before their birth
day to remind them to drink respon
sibly.
Castro and his team will be avail
able throughout Parents' Weekend
next month to discuss drinking and
alcohol issues with any concerned
parents.
