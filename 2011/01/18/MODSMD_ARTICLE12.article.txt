College enrollment in foreign language
classes showed an aggregated gain of
6.6 percent between 2006 and 2009, ac
cording to the Modern Language As
sociation (MLA) 2009 Enrollment
Survey. The trend is not surprising to some at Stan
ford, where undergraduates are not just learning
new languages, but driving new trends.
"The recent MLA study shows that there has
been growth in all of the top 10 most studied lan
guages," said Russell Berman, professor of German
studies and comparative literature. "I believe this is
because students recognize the opportunities in the
global economy."
Stanford had already placed tremendous value
on the importance of foreign-language learning, as
exemplified in a mandatory, one-year foreign-lan
guage requirement for graduation, according to
Elizabeth Bernhardt, director of the Language
Center and professor of German studies.
"A unique feature about Stanford is that the lan
guage program, which encompasses all the foreign
language departments, is the largest sector of the
undergraduate program, despite our 'techie' cul
ture," Bernhardt said.
While Stanford shares this rising enrollment
trend with many other colleges, the popularity of
less traditional languages, such as Chinese and Ara
bic, makes Stanford distinct from its peers.
"Our most enrolled language, of course, is Span
ish," Bernhardt said, "then followed by Chinese,
which doesn't happen at most universities."
French, Arabic, Japanese and Italian enroll
ments are tied behind Chinese a trend, Bern
hardt notes, that also separates Stanford from other
universities.
"If you went east of the Mississippi, you'd see a
different pattern of enrollment," Bernhardt said.
"You'd see a growing enrollment in Chinese, but
not to the extent we have here. You'd also see larg
er enrollment in German and Russian."
The motivations of students enrolling in foreign
languages are as varied as the languages them
selves. Although most students take at least one
year of foreign language to complete the gradua
tion requirement, the reasons behind their drive to
learn a language are often multi-faceted.
"I took a year of Arabic my freshman year," said
Will Monroe 'l3. "I was also looking for a language
to fulfill the requirement. Arabic seemed useful as
it was important in world affairs. I also wasn't inter
ested in testing out of the language requirement,
which I could have done with Spanish."
Other students have found their first-year lan
guage experiences so satisfying that they choose to
continue to take intermediate and advanced series,
solely out of intellectual interest.
"I find Russian interesting because it's not a Ro
mance language, nor is it character-based like
Japanese or Chinese," said Rachel Fenichel 'l3, who
is currently taking third-year Russian. "It's also very
challenging grammatically."
Part of the enthusiasm students acquire while
taking advanced courses comes from seeing lan
guage in its original context.
"I like knowing there's so much literature out
there in Russian," Fenichel said. "I've read short
stories by great Russian authors. It's exciting to read
stuff that was not written specifically for class but
for the people to really read."
Other students have found that their study
abroad experiences escalated their interest in and
appreciation for language.
"To me, studying Italian isn't just learning the
language," said Michael Crayne 'l2, who studied in
Italy. "It's also about learning about the Italian cul
ture and history. Early on, and especially during my
time studying in Florence, I discovered how rich the
history of Italy is and how fascinating of a culture it
is, rooted deeply in the past yet also very modern."
While many students still choose to meet only
the minimum language requirement, either by test
ing out or taking an introductory sequence, Bern
hardt is confident students will continue to find rea
sons to further their foreign-language study.

Stanford students "understand and have a com
mitment to the Stanford tradition," Bernhardt said,
"which is to take the knowledge they have here and
take [it] out to use in the world, no matter what kind
of knowledge or skills they may be."
