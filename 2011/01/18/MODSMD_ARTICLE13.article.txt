Until recently, Internet users
concerned with their privacy
could do little to protect them
selves from third-party track
ing while surfing the Web. But
thanks to the work of two Stanford re
searchers, Jonathan Mayer and Arvind
Narayanan, users can now opt out of track
ing that compiles information about their in
terests and preferences for online advertis
ers.
Behavioral advertising, which involves
tracking online consumers' browsing histo
ries, seeks to present ads that are targeted to
the interests of individual consumers. Mayer,
a graduate student in law and computer sci
ence, says users are becoming increasingly
concerned about the presence of behavioral
advertising.
"These sites get information about users
by tracking the places they visit," he said.
"Users feel a real privacy concern."

Last August, Mayer and Narayanan, who
is a post-doctoral researcher, set out to create
software that would allow users to indicate
they don't want to be tracked as they surf the
Web. Do Not Track, the product of their
work, is already in use by thousands who
have installed Adblock Plus or NoScript, two
free, popular Firefox add-ons that use the
software.
The technology behind Do Not Track is
fairly simple, Mayer says. The software works
by appending a custom header to HTTP re
quests sent by Web browsers. Each time the
user visits a site, this header indicates that the
user doesn't want to be tracked. Currently,
however, compliance with header requests is
voluntary: websites are not required to re
spond to users' requests.
For Mayer and Narayanan, this is the
biggest challenge for Do Not Track. Though
the software was noted in the Federal Trade
Commission's report on Web privacy last
November, there is debate as to whether sites
should be required to comply with the soft
ware's requests.

Mayer says addressing these policy con
siderations is currently the duo's main goal.
"The technology's actually dead simple,"
he said. "The challenges at this point are cer
tainly more on the policy side."
Online advertisers are the main oppo
nents of Do Not Track, he said, adding that
claims of the software's ability to destroy the
online advertising industry are unfounded,
especially since behavioral advertising repre
sents a small portion of the online ad market.
"Contextual, demographic and search
engine ads actually account for the vast ma
jority of online ads," he said. "The idea that
Do Not Track would wipe out the market is
difficult to believe."
Mayer added that advertisers could re
spect users' privacy while still tailoring ads to
the specific interests and preferences of con
sumers. He said that interest-based advertis
ing without tracking could be achieved by
having users initially indicate their interests
to their browser. The first time users
launched Do Not Track, they could also se
lect their interests from a list provided by

their browser.
"We really think this is a great solution to
the problem," he said. "It's definitely possible
to get analytics for advertising without third
party tracking."
Mayer maintained that Do Not Track
provides a choice for both parties involved.
Sites that don't wish to suspend third-party
tracking, he said, could refuse the user's re
quest, but only after informing the user. Con
sumers would thus be aware when sites were
tracking them.
"This is ultimately about choice and trans
parency," he said. "It truly is a very practical
technology."
Mayer is optimistic about the outlook of
Do Not Track and plans to continue to ex
pose its feasibility.
"We're really excited about what we've
created," he said. "Do Not Track has the abil
ity to make a meaningful impact in the pro
tection of online privacy."
