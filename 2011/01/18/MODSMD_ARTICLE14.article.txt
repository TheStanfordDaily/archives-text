## CONTINUED This Is Why I'm Single 
### Jade Wang 
I focus significant energy on as
serting my status as an inde
pendent woman and living my
life in accordance to a Destiny's
Child song. But, every now and
then, conversations with a lady
friend devolve into my complaints
about what is becoming my perpet
ual state of single lady. I would con
sider myself relatively happy, but
maybe I am living my life in blissful
ignorance, and my single status
means that my life is incomplete,
and any happiness I might have at
tained at this point will pale in com
parison to finding my one true love.
Well, I've never liked waiting, so is
there anything I can do to expedite
this process? Am I somehow sabo
taging myself?
I went through a day to gather
evidence of this possible sabotage.
I wake up fairly inoffensively.
Sure, my pajamas could be cuter
than men's sweatpants, and my
room could be neater, but I'll give
those a passing grade. My personal
hygiene routine is standard, and as I
brush my teeth, I mess with my hair,
which I attempted to cut myself to
save sso.This, I decide, is the first of
fense. While I did passably in
kindergarten cutting and pasting,
my hair-cutting skills unfortunately
leave something to be desired. Still,
though, I would hope that the Stan
ford man could look behind some
slightly jagged bangs.
My breakfast choice of cereal
and not enough milk leave some
thing to be desired, but I was in a
rush, so I'll excuse it. I adorn myself
with four or more knit items, all in
different patterns, to prepare for my
bike ride, which, upon further in
spection in the mirror, is my second
offense. Shabby striped mittens, a
stained scarf and a hat with a pom
pom on top, as it turns out, are not
particularly becoming.
My morning passes in a haze of
Gchat and clutching my coffee mug.
It's not ideal, but I'll assume my
dual addiction to chatting and caf
feine is fairly average. Noon rolls
around, and inspection of my wallet
reveals that a purchased lunch is out
of my grasp. Luckily, the odds are in
my favor, and the Earth Systems of
fice offers a buffet of chips. After
sampling all the flavors of Doritos, I
realize this is my third offense. I
shamefully wash the chip residue
off my hands.
I think I manage not to do any
thing horribly unbecoming during
afternoon class. Running into a
friend on my way back, though, I
start shrieking about how excited I
am for Hackathon, primarily, wear
ing the same pair of sweatpants for
24 hours. Oops in fact, not cute.

This is why I'm single.
I go home. Slightly weak with
hunger, I take stock of my refrigera
tor, wishing for the infinite time and
infinite ingredients of winter break
and my parents' house. I improvise
some soup with the myriad of root
vegetables that remain. It's not very
good. I swirl in half a stick of butter.
Better, but also, fifth offense.
Before I manage to get any work
done, I read through possibly
dozens of food blogs, my daily rou
tine. I casually scroll through nu
merous photos of broiled cheese,
chuckling to myself, and I've pow
ered through my sixth offense. The
rest of my evening passes relatively
uneventfully. I make a token effort
at doing my reading. I get distracted
with a truly inspiring frequency. I
decide to go to sleep (alone).
Let's make the admittedly shaky
assumption that my speculation on
the male psyche is accurate. I'm,
upon reflection, not convinced that
I'm ready to give up my sweatpants
wearing days of eating foods that
are only marginally socially accept
able. If I revise the offensive parts of
my day to be man-friendly, I worry
that I'll turn into a boring shadow of
myself. Some girls are interesting
because they have lovely talents or
are witty, but alas, my personality
may lie mostly in my penchant for
cheese on carbohydrates and
Gchat. Oh well. I guess I'd rather be
myself than be wed.

Know the "Single Ladies" dance?
