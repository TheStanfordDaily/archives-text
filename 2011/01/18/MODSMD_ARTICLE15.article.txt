# LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
## ROTC as a civil rights issue 
### 
Dear Editor,
There is an unfortunate and em
barrassing tendency in some cor
ners of American politics for the
slogans of the civil rights movement
to be employed in service of almost
any political goal. This is usually
done by those who still don't really
understand the legal and moral
basis of the movement, and their ra
tionale is that "everyone thinks
those slogans stand for irrefutable
moral truths, so if we say that those
slogans support our position, peo
ple will feel obliged to agree with
us."
A truly surprising and disgusting
example of this sophistry was wit
nessed by all those who were pres
ent at the town hall meeting regard
ing ROTC last Tuesday. Incompre
hensibly, the terms "separate but
equal" and "busing" were used as
part of an argument for ROTC's re
turn. It was also suggested that mili
tary-connected people are a "mi
nority" and that the University
should provide them with a "safe
space on campus." So as to avoid
casting aspersions on all students
who argued in support of ROTC, I
should point out that a number of
pro-ROTC students were shaking
their heads in confusion and embar
rassment while these arguments
were being made.
The heart of the matter, if it even
needs clarification, is that joining
ROTC is an occupational decision.
"Military connectedness" is qualita
tively different to "race, color, na
tional or ethnic origin, sex, age, dis
ability, religion, sexual orientation,
[or] gender identity" (quoting from
Stanford's nondiscrimination poli
cy) in the same way that "Google
connectedness" (i.e., being a for
mer, current, or future Google em

ployee) is qualitatively different.
The U.S. military is an employer.
You may think it is the greatest em
ployer on the face of the earth or
you may think it is repugnant, but
neither viewpoint is necessarily rel
evant to the question at hand:
whether Stanford University, as an
institution, should treat the U.S. mil
itary any differently from the way it
treats other employers.
In effect, what those supporting
ROTC's return are arguing for is
positive discrimination (in other
words, "affirmative action") on the
basis of undergraduate students'
occupational decisions. When asked
why all non-military employers lo
cated a similar distance from cam
pus should not also be provided
with on-campus facilities, the only
way to defend ROTC's return is to
argue that Stanford should differ
entiate between military service
and other types of employment in a
way that defines military service as
necessarily superior.
The argument that Stanford's
undergraduate students currently
have convenient access to every
possible occupational opportunity
other than the U.S. military, and that
ROTC should be brought back to
campus in order to rectify this "in
equality," has an obvious flaw: Stan
ford's students do not have conven
ient access to anything close to
every occupational opportunity,
and it would be impossible for the
University to make it so. As the ma
jority of the 1969 Ad Hoc Commit
tee on ROTC recognized, Stanford
cannot be all things to all people
and, as a result, the provision of fa
cilities in support of one group of
students' occupational decisions
would constitute an institutional
preference for that occupation
above all others.
