# GIRL YOU KNOW IT'S TRUE
## How to Get a Day Off 
### Jordan Carr 
This weekend, we took a holi
day to celebrate the life and
times of Martin Luther King
Jr. As we all know, Dr. King gave
moving speeches and organized
marches across the South, eventual
ly leading to civil rights victories that
have made America a better place
for all of us. Without a doubt, his life
is one that warrants the reflection
and admiration that come with your
own holiday.
Though Arizona held out for the
longest, Dr. King's birthday is now
nationally recognized as a holiday.
This raises the question of, even if
you hated Martin Luther King,
wouldn't you still want to give your
self the day off? Who doesn't want
to be able to spend more time with
their racist families? In honor of Dr.
King and the forthcoming Presi
dents' Day, Labor Day and all the
other days throughout the year
where our weeks are shortened,
here are a few more days we could
all take off.

Senators' Day
There's no doubt that the presi
dent is the most important figure in

the American democracy. But still,
why can't we get some time off to
think about the achievements of
Stephen Douglas, Chris Dodd,
Strom Thurmond and Henry "The
Great Compromiser" Clay? Just be
cause nobody's heard of any of
those people, and the ones they have
heard of are mostly famous for
doing terrible things?
Columbus Day
This one's a little trickier because
in some parts of America, Columbus
Day is still celebrated. However,
much of the country has rescinded
his day on account of 1) he didn't re
ally discover America, even if we're
not counting all the people who
were already living there and 2) he
was a big ol' racist who was killing
Native Americans left and right,
which is not exactly the type of his
torical legacy we want to be cele
brating. On the other hand, he did
sail the ocean blue.

Bring Your Daughter to Work Day
Day
On Bring Your Daughter to
Work Day Day, we spend our time

commemorating all of the meaning
ful activities and vocations learned
that have taken place on various
Bring Your Daughter to Work Days

On the other hand,
Columbus did sail
the ocean blue.
