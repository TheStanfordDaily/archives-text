# THE

## I Don't Think Elbows Have a Gender ...

So last Monday on the way back
from class, I epically fell off my
bike and hurt my right elbow.
A day after my accident, I went to
Vaden to get some x-rays done. The
doctors thought that my elbow
might be fractured, but they wanted
to refer me to an orthopedic doctor
to make sure. I needed a referral to
schedule an appointment. I called
the doctor several times, asking to
schedule an appointment. They
kept repeating, however, that they
hadn't received my referral yet.
After some poking around and
nudging on my part, the Vaden re
ferral people found my x-ray
records under my birth name, I had
given the wrong name to them all
along. (I think I have two name
records at Vaden, because this sort
of thing happens all the time. Oy.)
After a lot of frustration, instead

of seeing the doctor when I needed
to last week, I finally managed to
get an appointment for this Thurs
day, unfortunately under my birth
name. At this point, I didn't care
hell, they could call me Sally, as long
as they did something about my stu
pid elbow. However, my parents
thought that Thursday was too late
and decided to take me to the emer
gency room instead. On the way
there, my dad mentioned what he
should call me, because under the
insurance policy, my name was still
listed as my birth name.

I hadn't thought about that at all.
Shit. "Uh, just call me by my old
name," I said. Already I knew that
this emergency room visit was going
to be interesting, to say the least.
What followed was a painfully
awkward ordeal. The nurse was call
ing me by female pronouns and my
dad was calling me by male pro
nouns. I received a hospital bracelet
that had on it my birth name and my
birth sex, which made me quite un
comfortable and made me want to
rip it off the moment I had it stuck
on my wrist.
"What medications do you
take?" the nurse asked me.
I hesitated telling him about my
T injections. I found myself telling
him anyway. "Fifty milligrams of
testosterone every week," I said.
