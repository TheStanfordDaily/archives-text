# THE 						TRANSITIVE PROPERTY
## I Don't Think Elbows Have a Gender ... 
### Cristopher Bautista 
So last Monday on the way back
from class, I epically fell off my
bike and hurt my right elbow.
A day after my accident, I went to
Vaden to get some x-rays done. The
doctors thought that my elbow
might be fractured, but they wanted
to refer me to an orthopedic doctor
to make sure. I needed a referral to
schedule an appointment. I called
the doctor several times, asking to
schedule an appointment. They
kept repeating, however, that they
hadn't received my referral yet.
After some poking around and
nudging on my part, the Vaden re
ferral people found my x-ray
records under my birth name, I had
given the wrong name to them all
along. (I think I have two name
records at Vaden, because this sort
of thing happens all the time. Oy.)
After a lot of frustration, instead

of seeing the doctor when I needed
to last week, I finally managed to
get an appointment for this Thurs
day, unfortunately under my birth
name. At this point, I didn't care
hell, they could call me Sally, as long
as they did something about my stu
pid elbow. However, my parents
thought that Thursday was too late
and decided to take me to the emer
gency room instead. On the way
there, my dad mentioned what he
should call me, because under the
insurance policy, my name was still
listed as my birth name.

I hadn't thought about that at all.
Shit. "Uh, just call me by my old
name," I said. Already I knew that
this emergency room visit was going
to be interesting, to say the least.
What followed was a painfully
awkward ordeal. The nurse was call
ing me by female pronouns and my
dad was calling me by male pro
nouns. I received a hospital bracelet
that had on it my birth name and my
birth sex, which made me quite un
comfortable and made me want to
rip it off the moment I had it stuck
on my wrist.
"What medications do you
take?" the nurse asked me.
I hesitated telling him about my
T injections. I found myself telling
him anyway. "Fifty milligrams of
testosterone every week," I said.

"Why do you take that?" he
asked. I could hear the curiosity
peak in his voice,
"What?" I asked. I heard what
he said the first time, but I was just
buying time to figure out how to an
swer.
He repeated his question. "Hor
mone replacement therapy," I said
curtly, in away that told him that I
wouldn't divulge any other details
about it.
As if things couldn't get any
more awkward, another nurse
came up to me and had to verify my
identity. She asked for a form of
identification. I had left my driver's
license on my desk at Stanford. The
only ID I had on me was my Stan
ford ID, which had my new legal
name on it. Without a choice, I
handed it to her.
The nurse looked confused, al
ternating between looking at her
paperwork, then my ID and then at
me. "So which one should I use?"
she asked.
"Use the female name," I mut
tered. "That's what's on the insur
ance records."
She looked doubtful. "Okay,"
she said. Frustrated, I began to figu
ratively kick myself in the ass.

At the end of the whole ordeal,
the doctors couldn't figure out what
was wrong with me. One doctor
said it was fractured, another said it
was just bruised. It'd be one thing if
something productive was done,
but I'm at the same place I started.
And it's frustrating as hell.
So what's the point of this stupid
story?
I don't feel comfortable men
tioning my life story to strangers, es
pecially when that life story has
nothing to do with my current med
ical condition. I had an injured
elbow, and frankly, I was too cranky
and in pain to tell them my whole
life story as a transgendered per
son. Getting medical help for any
thing as a trans person always turns
out to be a bit frustrating as well as
a bit humiliating, especially when
being treated for conditions that
have nothing to do with being trans.
No wonder a lot of trans people
hate getting medical help, which is
why their health tends to be less
ideal than most people. Besides, my
elbow has nothing to do with me
being a transguy. Rather, it had to
do with my total incapacity as a bi
cyclist. Trans people can fail at rid
ing bicycles too, you know.
So now I'm just really confused.
All I know is that my elbow hurts.
Wah.
