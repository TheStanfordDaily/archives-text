## Continuing King's legacy 
### MICHAEL TUBBS'12 
As we pause to honor the life
and dream of Dr. Martin
Luther King Jr., we need to
take a hard look at the work that re
mains to be done to make Dr.
King's dream a reality. The tena
cious demons that Dr. King warned
us against and led many to work
tirelessly to overcome poverty
and racism still plague our na
tion and communities. And our chil
dren continue to suffer.

In 1968 when Dr. King died,
there were 1.1 million poor children
in America. Today that number
stands at over 15.5 million, almost
half of whom (6.9 million) live in ex
treme poverty. It's a sad commen
tary that 40 years after the Poor
People's Campaign that was carried
out after his untimely death, pover
ty still stacks the odds against mil
lion of children before birth. Even
sadder is the way that poverty inter
acts with race, and places millions of
black and other minority children
on a trajectory to all sorts of nega
tive outcomes.

In many ways, Dr. King's Poor
People Campaign has been re
placed with what the Children's De
fense Fund calls "The Cradle to
Prison Pipeline." This pipeline de
scribes the phenomenon that sen
tences too many poor and minority
children to a trajectory of marginal
ized lives, imprisonment and, often,
premature death. Jim Crow has
been replaced by incarceration, and
the doctrine of "separate but equal"
still can be used to describe our ed

ucation system. When one in three
black boys and one in six Latino
boys born in 2001 will be incarcerat
ed sometime in their lifetime, it's
time to sound an alarm about this
threat to American unity and com
munity. Our democratic ideals and
our future as a world leader de
mand it.

The failure for all of us, those
who in many respects are some of
the most intellectually gifted and
privileged in this world, to act now
will reverse the hard-earned racial
and social progress for which Dr.
King and so many others were mar
tyred. Like Dr. King, we all must de
velop the courage to look at injus
tice in the face, name it and use the
considerable skills at our disposal to
rectify it. In this spirit, the Chil
dren's Defense Fund has launched
"The Black Community Crusade
for Children," a campaign that de
mands the participation of all in
order to be successful.

In the first phase of the Black
Community Crusade for Children,
launched in 1990, there exist count
less models for success. In New
York, the Harlem Children's Zone
has pioneered a new way to end the
cycle of intergenerational poverty
for thousands of children and fami
lies in a 100-block radius. The Chil
dren's Defense Fund's Freedom
Schools have served over 80,000
children and trained 9,000 college
aged mentors. Healthcare benefits
have been extended to 95 percent of
all children. Countless other solu

tions to these problems exist right
on our beloved Farm.
Forty-three years after Dr.
King's death, we must reflect on his
day on the "fierce urgency of now."
While there are many problems fac
ing poor and minority children, and
by extension our country as a
whole, these problems don't lend
themselves to fatalistic diagnosis.
Rather, they are challenges for us to
work together to solve problems
that provide great opportunities for
entrepreneurship and innovative
thought. I am confident that the
same campus that produced those
who created Google and Sun Mi
crosystems and that attracts stu
dents who dedicate countless hours
to public service pursuits in the
HAAS Center for Public Service
and abroad, can partner with the
Children's Defense Fund and mil
lions of other concerned Americans
through the Black Community Cru
sade for Children. The solutions to
the inequalities in our country eat in
The Axe and Palm, kiss at Full
Moon on the Quad and write
IHUM papers. Through pursuing
research, asking tough questions
and bringing recognition of struc
tural inequalities to whatever ca
reer we decide to pursue, we can be
the generation that makes King's
dream, and the dreams of the mil
lion of poor and minority children
in our country, a reality.
