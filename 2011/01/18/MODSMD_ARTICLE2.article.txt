Last week's campus burglaries have prompted Stu
dent Housing to take new, preventative security meas
ures in Stanford's dorms and houses.

The Department of Public Safety (DPS) sent out e
mails and flyers to remind students to take extra safety
precautions, and the Housing After-Hours Response
Team (HART) has heightened its nightly patrols of stu
dent housing and dining areas to check for unclosed
perimeter doors. The patrols are now at a level normally
reserved for winter break when students are away, said
Rodger Whitney, executive director of Student Housing.
The Row housing office is taking note of which hous
es are going on ski trip in the upcoming weekends and
will be increasing security around those houses at that
time. It will also be holding a security meeting with the

Row residence assistants (RAs).

Break-in at Theta
Over winter break, the residents of Kappa Alpha
Theta received an e-mail from Student Housing: there
had been a break-in at the Theta house.
When the residents returned to campus after break,
they assessed what had been stolen. Ryan Rogers 'll, an
RA, said they were surprised to find out that only two
items were taken: a TV and an iHome.
"It was kind of bizarre because there is evidence that
the burglars did get into a quite a few of the other rooms
by doors being pried open," Rogers said, "but there was
nothing else taken."
The Theta house contains around 30 rooms. More
than half of these rooms had crowbar marks on their

experienced intruders last week. While most of the house's residents were
away on ski trip, four unlocked rooms were burglarized.
