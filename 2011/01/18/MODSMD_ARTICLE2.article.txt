# BREAK-INS PROMPT SECURITY INCREASE
## Burglaries,'hot prowl' concern Housing, staffs 
### KURT CHIRBAS STAFF WRITER 
Last week's campus burglaries have prompted Stu
dent Housing to take new, preventative security meas
ures in Stanford's dorms and houses.

The Department of Public Safety (DPS) sent out e
mails and flyers to remind students to take extra safety
precautions, and the Housing After-Hours Response
Team (HART) has heightened its nightly patrols of stu
dent housing and dining areas to check for unclosed
perimeter doors. The patrols are now at a level normally
reserved for winter break when students are away, said
Rodger Whitney, executive director of Student Housing.
The Row housing office is taking note of which hous
es are going on ski trip in the upcoming weekends and
will be increasing security around those houses at that
time. It will also be holding a security meeting with the

Row residence assistants (RAs).

Break-in at Theta
Over winter break, the residents of Kappa Alpha
Theta received an e-mail from Student Housing: there
had been a break-in at the Theta house.
When the residents returned to campus after break,
they assessed what had been stolen. Ryan Rogers 'll, an
RA, said they were surprised to find out that only two
items were taken: a TV and an iHome.
"It was kind of bizarre because there is evidence that
the burglars did get into a quite a few of the other rooms
by doors being pried open," Rogers said, "but there was
nothing else taken."
The Theta house contains around 30 rooms. More
than half of these rooms had crowbar marks on their

away on ski trip, four unlocked rooms were burglarized.
doors. Rogers said some of these
marks are deep enough to suggest
that the burglars were able to enter
these rooms.
"It was kind of unclear why they
would go through all that effort and
put all those crowbar marks on the
doors if they weren't really going to
steal anything," Rogers said.
In response to the break-in, a new
lock has been installed on the outside
door to Theta, which had previously
been left opened.
Burglary at Bob
Sam Svoboda 'll, an RA at the
Mayfield Avenue residence Bob, was
sleeping last Friday night when he
heard his phone ring. On the other
line was a fellow resident who had
just come up from the lounge to his
second-floor room and discovered
that his laptop was missing, said Svo
boda, who is also a Daily writer.
Later, they discovered a total of
four rooms in Bob, all unlocked, had
been broken into. The current list of
items that were stolen includes three
Macßooks, an iPod, an iPod Touch, a
camera and money from three of the
four rooms.
Most of the residents weren't
there that night. Normally, Bob hous
es 58 students, but Svoboda said
about 10 stayed back from the ski trip
that weekend.
"If we had had a full house here, I
think the chances would've dramati
cally increased that someone
would've seen something," he said.
At first, Svoboda said they
thought that someone had let the
burglars in.
But Housing discovered that side
door was defective and stayed slight
ly ajar unless pulled closed. This en
trance would've allowed the suspects
to get into the house without a key
and without passing through the
lounge, where most of the residents
were that night. The door was fixed
the day after the burglary, Svoboda
said.
Hot Prowl at Grove Mayfield
Bob Clark 'll, an RA at Grove
Mayfield, was on the house's ski trip
last weekend when he saw the text
message from the SU Alert system. It
said a "hot prowl" had occurred at his
residence.
"A lot of people didn't know what
that mean," Clark said, "so we actual
ly looked it up on Wikipedia."
A hot prowl is a burglary attempt
when the suspect breaks into a resi
dence with the occupants still inside,
which is what happened to a resident
of Grove last Saturday night when
three unidentified men allegedly

opened her unlocked door. She woke
up and screamed as the suspects fled
in an unidentified direction. No thefts
were reported.
"I think there's a tendency to
downplay this because nothing bad
ended up happening," Clark said,
"We are fortunate that nothing was
taken, but it's pretty scary that three
unknown individuals walked in on
one of our residents sleeping."
It was later discovered that the
residence had two defective doors
one in the kitchen and one in the din
ing area. Clark guessed that the sus
pects entered through the door in the
kitchen and came up the stairs.
Both doors were fixed the next
day before the residents returned
from the ski trip.
Clark said he is unsure whether
the suspects were students or non
students.
"There's been a lot of debate back
and forth about it," Clark said. "On
one hand, we initially thought that
they might be students because it
seemed like if they were the same in
dividuals who were at Bob, then they
were targeting houses that were on
ski trip, which would require knowl
edge of what houses were going."
"But it may be more likely that
they are from off campus some
where," Clark added. "Perhaps they
were just looking for houses that
were mostly dark."
What's Next?
According to Larson, the number
of burglaries has remained consistent
over the years.
During the 2008-2009 school year,
from the beginning of the 2008 au
tumn quarter to the end of the 2009
summer quarter, 67 burglaries oc
curred. There were 59 during the
2009-2010 school year and, so far, 15
this year.
"Burglaries occur throughout the
year," Larson wrote in an e-mail to
The Daily. "Burglary is often a crime
of opportunity such as when doors
are propped open or suspicious per
sons are not immediately reported."
Larson said that few arrests have
been made for burglaries over the
past few years, but was unable to say
how many.
Larson said DPS, Student Hous
ing and Residential Education will
continue to work together to remind
students to lock all doors and win
dows, and to report suspicious or un
familiar persons to Housing staff or
Public Safety.
"We have a very safe campus in
general," Clark said, "but someone
can take advantage of our comfort
and our trust that it is a safe campus. I
think this is a little bit of a wake-up
call and tell us that we need to be
proactive."

and forth about it," Clark said. "On
one hand, we initially thought that
they might be students because it
seemed like if they were the same in
dividuals who were at Bob, then they
were targeting houses that were on
ski trip, which would require knowl
edge of what houses were going."
"But it may be more likely that
they are from off campus some
where," Clark added. "Perhaps they
were just looking for houses that
were mostly dark."
What's Next?
According to Larson, the number
of burglaries has remained consistent
over the years.
During the 2008-2009 school year,
from the beginning of the 2008 au
tumn quarter to the end of the 2009
summer quarter, 67 burglaries oc
curred. There were 59 during the
2009-2010 school year and, so far, 15
this year.
"Burglaries occur throughout the
year," Larson wrote in an e-mail to
The Daily. "Burglary is often a crime
of opportunity such as when doors
are propped open or suspicious per
sons are not immediately reported."
Larson said that few arrests have
been made for burglaries over the
past few years, but was unable to say
how many.
Larson said DPS, Student Hous
ing and Residential Education will
continue to work together to remind
students to lock all doors and win
dows, and to report suspicious or un
familiar persons to Housing staff or
Public Safety.
"We have a very safe campus in
general," Clark said, "but someone
can take advantage of our comfort
and our trust that it is a safe campus. I
think this is a little bit of a wake-up
call and tell us that we need to be
proactive."

Last week's campus burglaries have prompted Stu
dent Housing to take new, preventative security meas
ures in Stanford's dorms and houses.

The Department of Public Safety (DPS) sent out e
mails and flyers to remind students to take extra safety
precautions, and the Housing After-Hours Response
Team (HART) has heightened its nightly patrols of stu
dent housing and dining areas to check for unclosed
perimeter doors. The patrols are now at a level normally
reserved for winter break when students are away, said
Rodger Whitney, executive director of Student Housing.
The Row housing office is taking note of which hous
es are going on ski trip in the upcoming weekends and
will be increasing security around those houses at that
time. It will also be holding a security meeting with the

Row residence assistants (RAs).

Break-in at Theta
Over winter break, the residents of Kappa Alpha
Theta received an e-mail from Student Housing: there
had been a break-in at the Theta house.
When the residents returned to campus after break,
they assessed what had been stolen. Ryan Rogers 'll, an
RA, said they were surprised to find out that only two
items were taken: a TV and an iHome.
"It was kind of bizarre because there is evidence that
the burglars did get into a quite a few of the other rooms
by doors being pried open," Rogers said, "but there was
nothing else taken."
The Theta house contains around 30 rooms. More
than half of these rooms had crowbar marks on their

away on ski trip, four unlocked rooms were burglarized.
doors. Rogers said some of these
marks are deep enough to suggest
that the burglars were able to enter
these rooms.
"It was kind of unclear why they
would go through all that effort and
put all those crowbar marks on the
doors if they weren't really going to
steal anything," Rogers said.
In response to the break-in, a new
lock has been installed on the outside
door to Theta, which had previously
been left opened.
Burglary at Bob
Sam Svoboda 'll, an RA at the
Mayfield Avenue residence Bob, was
sleeping last Friday night when he
heard his phone ring. On the other
line was a fellow resident who had
just come up from the lounge to his
second-floor room and discovered
that his laptop was missing, said Svo
boda, who is also a Daily writer.
Later, they discovered a total of
four rooms in Bob, all unlocked, had
been broken into. The current list of
items that were stolen includes three
Macßooks, an iPod, an iPod Touch, a
camera and money from three of the
four rooms.
Most of the residents weren't
there that night. Normally, Bob hous
es 58 students, but Svoboda said
about 10 stayed back from the ski trip
that weekend.
"If we had had a full house here, I
think the chances would've dramati
cally increased that someone
would've seen something," he said.
At first, Svoboda said they
thought that someone had let the
burglars in.
But Housing discovered that side
door was defective and stayed slight
ly ajar unless pulled closed. This en
trance would've allowed the suspects
to get into the house without a key
and without passing through the
lounge, where most of the residents
were that night. The door was fixed
the day after the burglary, Svoboda
said.
Hot Prowl at Grove Mayfield
Bob Clark 'll, an RA at Grove
Mayfield, was on the house's ski trip
last weekend when he saw the text
message from the SU Alert system. It
said a "hot prowl" had occurred at his
residence.
"A lot of people didn't know what
that mean," Clark said, "so we actual
ly looked it up on Wikipedia."
A hot prowl is a burglary attempt
when the suspect breaks into a resi
dence with the occupants still inside,
which is what happened to a resident
of Grove last Saturday night when
three unidentified men allegedly

opened her unlocked door. She woke
up and screamed as the suspects fled
in an unidentified direction. No thefts
were reported.
"I think there's a tendency to
downplay this because nothing bad
ended up happening," Clark said,
"We are fortunate that nothing was
taken, but it's pretty scary that three
unknown individuals walked in on
one of our residents sleeping."
It was later discovered that the
residence had two defective doors
one in the kitchen and one in the din
ing area. Clark guessed that the sus
pects entered through the door in the
kitchen and came up the stairs.
Both doors were fixed the next
day before the residents returned
from the ski trip.
Clark said he is unsure whether
the suspects were students or non
students.
"There's been a lot of debate back
and forth about it," Clark said. "On
one hand, we initially thought that
they might be students because it
seemed like if they were the same in
dividuals who were at Bob, then they
were targeting houses that were on
