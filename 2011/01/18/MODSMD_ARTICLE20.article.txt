## FALLING SHORT Men suffer first home loss against Washington State 
### CAROLINE CASELLI DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford men's basketball team came
up just short against Washington State (13-5,3-3
Pac-10) on Saturday night, suffering its first
home defeat of the season, 61-58, after a Jeremy
Green desperation three-pointer to force the
game into overtime bounced off the rim at the
buzzer.
The Card (10-6,3-2) was unable to contain
Cougar junior guards Klay Thompson and
Faisal Aden, who combined for 41 points.
Thompson, who entered the game averaging
a conference-best 23.1 points per game, was
held in check in the first half due to defensive
pressure by Stanford and early foul trouble
however, he became more aggressive in the sec

ond period and proved too difficult to handle.
Aden carried the Cougars' offense in the first
half, as the Stanford defense struggled to keep
up with his quickness.
"I thought they outplayed us," said Stanford
head coach Johnny Dawkins. "They gave a win
ning effort and won the game, I thought Klay
Thompson and Faisal Aden really stepped up
and gave some good contributions to their
team.
"We all learn from our losses, and unfortu
nately, we took one tonight," he added.
The Card was the dominant team in the first
half, led by the play of redshirt junior forward
Josh Owens and freshman forward Dwight
Powell. Owens displayed strong post moves and
created ample scoring opportunities for himself
off the offensive glass, while Powell dominated
the boards on both ends of the floor.
Both gave the Card momentum going into
halftime Owens with a thunderous dunk
over the Cougars' DeAngelo Casto, and Pow
ell by drawing contact on a tough shot in the
lane for a three-point play in the period's final
seconds.
Stanford's first-half momentum was quickly
extinguished as the Cougars went on a 10-1 run
including two threes from a rejuvenated
Thompson to open the second stanza and tie
the game.
