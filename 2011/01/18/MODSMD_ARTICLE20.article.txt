## FALLING SHORT Men suffer first home loss against Washington State 
### CAROLINE CASELLI DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford men's basketball team came
up just short against Washington State (13-5,3-3
Pac-10) on Saturday night, suffering its first
home defeat of the season, 61-58, after a Jeremy
Green desperation three-pointer to force the
game into overtime bounced off the rim at the
buzzer.
The Card (10-6,3-2) was unable to contain
Cougar junior guards Klay Thompson and
Faisal Aden, who combined for 41 points.
Thompson, who entered the game averaging
a conference-best 23.1 points per game, was
held in check in the first half due to defensive
pressure by Stanford and early foul trouble
however, he became more aggressive in the sec

ond period and proved too difficult to handle.
Aden carried the Cougars' offense in the first
half, as the Stanford defense struggled to keep
up with his quickness.
"I thought they outplayed us," said Stanford
head coach Johnny Dawkins. "They gave a win
ning effort and won the game, I thought Klay
Thompson and Faisal Aden really stepped up
and gave some good contributions to their
team.
"We all learn from our losses, and unfortu
nately, we took one tonight," he added.
The Card was the dominant team in the first
half, led by the play of redshirt junior forward
Josh Owens and freshman forward Dwight
Powell. Owens displayed strong post moves and
created ample scoring opportunities for himself
off the offensive glass, while Powell dominated
the boards on both ends of the floor.
Both gave the Card momentum going into
halftime Owens with a thunderous dunk
over the Cougars' DeAngelo Casto, and Pow
ell by drawing contact on a tough shot in the
lane for a three-point play in the period's final
seconds.
Stanford's first-half momentum was quickly
extinguished as the Cougars went on a 10-1 run
including two threes from a rejuvenated
Thompson to open the second stanza and tie
the game.

GAME NOTES: Stanford will look to get back to its winning
ways after suffering its first Pac-10 loss to Washington
State Saturday. The Cardinal will be playing its first con
ference game away from home at USC. Stanford has
struggled on the road all season. USC is coming off of
a pair of losses at the Oregon schools.

Junior forward Josh Owens helped Stanford jump out to a first-half lead with a strong start. The
Cougars got back into the game with an early second-half run and eventually took control.
"We were going into halftime with
a nine-point lead, so the first five min
utes of the half were key they hit
us in the mouth," said freshman wing
Anthony Brown. "We were never
able to respond after that."
Stanford's offense was stagnant at
times, but a string of missed opportu
nities from both teams kept the game
close. Green, who was quiet in the
first half, stepped up to make several
much-needed shots from behind the
arc. Brown was also impressive, hit
ting three three-pointers in the sec
ond period to prevent the Cougars
from pulling away.
Down four points with 1:27 re
maining, Green made a tough step
back jumper to make it a one-posses
sion game. Multiple missed shots
from the Cougars followed by a jump
ball gave Stanford another opportu

nity to tie the game prior to Green's
last-ditch heave.
With seven seconds left on the
clock, Owens was fouled hard in the
paint and sent to the line for two
shots. A 55.8-percent free-throw
shooter heading into the game,
Owens hit the first, but missed his sec
ond attempt, leaving Stanford down
by one at 59-58.
Stanford immediately fouled
Washington State's Abe Lodwick on
the rebound, and he calmly sank two
free throws his only points of the
game to give the Cougars the
three-point edge.
Junior guard Green had 13 points
to lead Stanford, and Brown added
12 points, all off three-pointers.
Owens also contributed 12 points on
5-of-7 shooting, and he and freshman
forward Dwight Powell were the
night's leading rebounders, grabbing
10 boards apiece.
Thompson had 21 points and
Aden had 20, though both were fairly
inefficient scorers, shooting 9-of-20
and 8-of-19, respectively. The

Cougars outshot the Cardinal 41.1
percent to 34.4 percent and had 16
points off turnovers to Stanford's
four.
Next weekend, the Card will trav
el south to Tos Angeles to take on
USC and UCLA on Thursday and
Saturday, respectively.
