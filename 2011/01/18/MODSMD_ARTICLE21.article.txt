## Card women dominate the Washington schools 
### JACK BLANCHAT CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After knocking off Rutgers on Sunday in the
season opener, the No. 3 Stanford women's bas
ketball team heads away from the Farm this
weekend for two tough road games.The Cardinal
tangles with Utah on Friday night, then heads
north to play Gonzaga on Sunday afternoon.
For the 10th year in a row, the Cardinal
opened its season with a win, defeating Rutgers
63-50 last Sunday. The Card's next test comes
against two familiar opponents.
Stanford and Utah have played each other in
six out of the last seven years, and the two teams
will both be members of the new Pac-12 next
year.The Cardinal took home a 60-41 victory last
year in Maples Pavilion, and is unbeaten in 11
games all-time against the Utes.
Last year, Utah finished with a 23-12 overall
record and was the runner-up in the Mountain
West conference after falling to San Diego State
in a 70-60 overtime defeat. The Utes went on to
the Women's NIT tournament, where they lost to
Cal in the second round.
Gonzaga, on the other hand, was on the re
ceiving end of the Cardinal's biggest scoring out
put last season. Led by senior Kayla Pedersen's
30 points and junior Nnemkadi Ogwumike's 29
points, Stanford cruised to a 105-75 victory last
year, the most points the Cardinal scored in a sin
gle game all season.
Minus the loss to Stanford, Gonzaga had a
dominant season last year. The Bulldogs lost only
five games all season, won their third West Coast
Conference title in the last four years and had a
20-game winning streak snapped in the Sweet 16
of the NCAA tournament by Xavier. Xavier's
win over Gonzaga sent them to their matchup

with Stanford in the Elite Eight, where the Card
escaped 55-53 thanks to Jeannette Pohlen's
coast-to-coast, buzzer-beating layup.
Even against two dangerous teams like the
Utes and Zags, Stanford fans can expect to see
plenty of new looks on the floor this weekend, as
Head Coach Tara VanDerveer expects to use all
many different rotations in order to find the
strongest starting lineup and the best rotations
off the bench.
