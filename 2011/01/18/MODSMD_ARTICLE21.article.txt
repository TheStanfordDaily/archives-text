## Card women dominate the Washington schools 
### JACK BLANCHAT CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After knocking off Rutgers on Sunday in the
season opener, the No. 3 Stanford women's bas
ketball team heads away from the Farm this
weekend for two tough road games.The Cardinal
tangles with Utah on Friday night, then heads
north to play Gonzaga on Sunday afternoon.
For the 10th year in a row, the Cardinal
opened its season with a win, defeating Rutgers
63-50 last Sunday. The Card's next test comes
against two familiar opponents.
Stanford and Utah have played each other in
six out of the last seven years, and the two teams
will both be members of the new Pac-12 next
year.The Cardinal took home a 60-41 victory last
year in Maples Pavilion, and is unbeaten in 11
games all-time against the Utes.
Last year, Utah finished with a 23-12 overall
record and was the runner-up in the Mountain
West conference after falling to San Diego State
in a 70-60 overtime defeat. The Utes went on to
the Women's NIT tournament, where they lost to
Cal in the second round.
Gonzaga, on the other hand, was on the re
ceiving end of the Cardinal's biggest scoring out
put last season. Led by senior Kayla Pedersen's
30 points and junior Nnemkadi Ogwumike's 29
points, Stanford cruised to a 105-75 victory last
year, the most points the Cardinal scored in a sin
gle game all season.
Minus the loss to Stanford, Gonzaga had a
dominant season last year. The Bulldogs lost only
five games all season, won their third West Coast
Conference title in the last four years and had a
20-game winning streak snapped in the Sweet 16
of the NCAA tournament by Xavier. Xavier's
win over Gonzaga sent them to their matchup

with Stanford in the Elite Eight, where the Card
escaped 55-53 thanks to Jeannette Pohlen's
coast-to-coast, buzzer-beating layup.
Even against two dangerous teams like the
Utes and Zags, Stanford fans can expect to see
plenty of new looks on the floor this weekend, as
Head Coach Tara VanDerveer expects to use all
many different rotations in order to find the
strongest starting lineup and the best rotations
off the bench.
The Cardinal used six different lineups

against Rutgers, which VanDerveer
said was "not enough." After losing
seniors Jayne Appel and Rosalyn
Gold-Onwude to graduation last
year, the Cardinal seems to have
found a few answers to who will help
take over for the two fan favorites.
Sophomore forward Joslyn Tin
kle started only two games last year
in lieu of an injured Jayne Appel, but
the 6-foot-3 forward raised eye
brows and expectations when
she dropped two three-pointers in
the first three minutes of Sunday's
game against Rutgers.
The Missoula, Mont, native had a
solid 10 points and six rebounds in
Sunday's matchup against Rutgers.
Coach VanDerveer praised the
poise and calm of her new starter.
Tinkle says the team's anxiety
was "typical butterflies," but the
sophomore is using her calm and
confidence to help take over the
holes left from last year's team.
"It's not so hectic [as a sopho
more], you're more comfortable and
at ease, you have a more definite
role on the team," she said. "I think
knowing that, it's a big goal to be one
of those go-to players. That's some
thing I keep working on every day to
be a big-time contributor to this
team."
Tinkle says she's playing the role
of a small forward or shooting guard
this year instead of taking over
Appel's spot at center, and that her
own versatility —as well as her
teammates' gives the Cardinal a
huge advantage down the road.
"Me and Nnemkadi [Owgumike]

and Kayla [Pedersen] all have the
ability to step out whenever we need
to," she said. "It's a compliment that
we can mix it up depending on who
our opponent is."
VanDerveer said that versatility is a
positive thing, but it has some conse
quences for the players like Tinkle
who are stepping into new roles this
season.
"It'll take some time [to set a
starting lineup], and it might be
based on a couple things," she said.
"All three freshmen played exceed
ingly well, but they don't have the
margin for error. They're getting
thrown into the deep end of the
pool."
But even with an opening win, a
No. 3 national ranking and a starting
spot on the floor, Tinkle isn't afraid
to say that there is room for im
provement.
"We have a lot to work on," she
said. "Rutgers definitely hung in
there with us, and we need to exceed
the expectations that we have for
ourselves."
Tinkle says those expectations
are clear, and that setting the bar
high will help the Cardinal both
achieve their goals this year and fill
the holes from last year.
"Coming here, they expect the
best from you, they want to see all
aspects of the game," Tinkle said.
"With the presence of Jayne and
Rosalyn being gone, all of us can
share that role, and everyone wants
to step up and equally contribute."
Stanford will take on Utah
tonight at 6 p.m. PST in Salt Lake
City, before traveling to Spokane,

For the 10th year in a row, the Cardinal
opened its season with a win, defeating Rutgers
63-50 last Sunday. The Card's next test comes
against two familiar opponents.
Stanford and Utah have played each other in
six out of the last seven years, and the two teams
will both be members of the new Pac-12 next
year.The Cardinal took home a 60-41 victory last
year in Maples Pavilion, and is unbeaten in 11
games all-time against the Utes.
Last year, Utah finished with a 23-12 overall
record and was the runner-up in the Mountain
West conference after falling to San Diego State
in a 70-60 overtime defeat. The Utes went on to
the Women's NIT tournament, where they lost to
Cal in the second round.
Gonzaga, on the other hand, was on the re
ceiving end of the Cardinal's biggest scoring out
put last season. Led by senior Kayla Pedersen's
30 points and junior Nnemkadi Ogwumike's 29
points, Stanford cruised to a 105-75 victory last
year, the most points the Cardinal scored in a sin
gle game all season.
Minus the loss to Stanford, Gonzaga had a
dominant season last year. The Bulldogs lost only
five games all season, won their third West Coast
Conference title in the last four years and had a
20-game winning streak snapped in the Sweet 16
of the NCAA tournament by Xavier. Xavier's
win over Gonzaga sent them to their matchup

with Stanford in the Elite Eight, where the Card
escaped 55-53 thanks to Jeannette Pohlen's
coast-to-coast, buzzer-beating layup.
Even against two dangerous teams like the
Utes and Zags, Stanford fans can expect to see
plenty of new looks on the floor this weekend, as
Head Coach Tara VanDerveer expects to use all
many different rotations in order to find the
strongest starting lineup and the best rotations
off the bench.
The Cardinal used six different lineups

hold on top spot in the conference.

against Rutgers, which VanDerveer
said was "not enough." After losing
seniors Jayne Appel and Rosalyn
Gold-Onwude to graduation last
year, the Cardinal seems to have
found a few answers to who will help
take over for the two fan favorites.
Sophomore forward Joslyn Tin
kle started only two games last year
in lieu of an injured Jayne Appel, but
the 6-foot-3 forward raised eye
brows and expectations when
she dropped two three-pointers in
the first three minutes of Sunday's
game against Rutgers.
The Missoula, Mont, native had a
solid 10 points and six rebounds in
Sunday's matchup against Rutgers.
Coach VanDerveer praised the
poise and calm of her new starter.
Tinkle says the team's anxiety
was "typical butterflies," but the
sophomore is using her calm and
confidence to help take over the
holes left from last year's team.
"It's not so hectic [as a sopho
more], you're more comfortable and
at ease, you have a more definite
role on the team," she said. "I think
knowing that, it's a big goal to be one
of those go-to players. That's some
thing I keep working on every day to
be a big-time contributor to this
team."
Tinkle says she's playing the role
of a small forward or shooting guard
this year instead of taking over
Appel's spot at center, and that her
own versatility —as well as her
teammates' gives the Cardinal a
huge advantage down the road.
"Me and Nnemkadi [Owgumike]

and Kayla [Pedersen] all have the
ability to step out whenever we need
to," she said. "It's a compliment that
we can mix it up depending on who
our opponent is."
VanDerveer said that versatility is a
positive thing, but it has some conse
quences for the players like Tinkle
who are stepping into new roles this
season.
"It'll take some time [to set a
starting lineup], and it might be
based on a couple things," she said.
"All three freshmen played exceed
ingly well, but they don't have the
margin for error. They're getting
thrown into the deep end of the
pool."
But even with an opening win, a
No. 3 national ranking and a starting
spot on the floor, Tinkle isn't afraid
to say that there is room for im
provement.
"We have a lot to work on," she
said. "Rutgers definitely hung in
there with us, and we need to exceed
the expectations that we have for
ourselves."
Tinkle says those expectations
are clear, and that setting the bar
high will help the Cardinal both
achieve their goals this year and fill
the holes from last year.
"Coming here, they expect the
best from you, they want to see all
aspects of the game," Tinkle said.
"With the presence of Jayne and
Rosalyn being gone, all of us can
share that role, and everyone wants
to step up and equally contribute."
Stanford will take on Utah
tonight at 6 p.m. PST in Salt Lake
City, before traveling to Spokane,
Wash., on Sunday to play Gonzaga
at 2 p.m.
