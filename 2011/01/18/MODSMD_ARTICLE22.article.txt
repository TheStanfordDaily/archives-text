# Curbing NFL head injuries
## 
### Daniel Bohm On My Mind 
Maybe you were more
productive than me on
this beautiful, three
day, Bay Area week
end. However, I'm
guessing I wasn't the only red-blooded
American that spent Saturday and Sun
day migrating from couch to couch
watching NFL games
It was during the Bears-Seahawks
game that I had an epiphany —and no,
it wasn't that it is completely ridiculous
how early games start on the West
Coast. Actually, it is far more serious
than that. It is that head injuries are part
of football.
I am definitely not the first, and I
most certainly won't be the last sports
writer to weigh in on this touchy topic.
This year, the yelling about player safety
in football has been louder than ever, as
the NFL has begun upping fines for ille
gal hits. The trouble is, two Seattle Sea
hawks players were carted off the field
with apparently serious head injuries on
Sunday—and both came after entirely
legal hits.
Writers and pundits alike have
called for all levels of punishment and
changes to help protect football players
My colleague Zach Zimmerman even
went so far as to say that his kids won't
be playing football.
What was reinforced to me this
weekend is that the notion that trying to
change player behavior through fines
will somehow change the way the game
is played is entirely ludicrous. Instead of
spending time trying to make players,
whose entire livelihood is dependent on
a kill-or-be-killed mentality, think twice
before making a hit, time and resources
should be pointed toward research and
development of tools to make the game
that exists as it does now safer.
As a former football player who
thought playing football was one of the
most special, important parts of my life,
and who will definitely let his kids play
football if they want I'd make the ar
gument that players simply don't have
the time to think whether or not to
make a hit or try to tackle a player one
way or another because every play is dif
ferent in football. If you try to regulate
hits that cause injuries, eventually the
NFL will turn into two-hand touch.
The interesting thing about foot
ball is that although technology has
improved in recent years helmets
are far safer today than they were just
a decade ago the game is just as
dangerous, if not more dangerous as
players get bigger and stronger. That is
why helmets need to continue to get
safer and pads need to become more
fortified.
Fox color commentator Daryl John
ston made a very good point after Sea
hawks cornerback Marcus Trufant was
knocked out cold by a knee to the head
while trying to make a tackle. Johnston
reminded fans that players aren't re
quired to wear leg pads and that pad
less legs (especially knees) can be dan
gerous weapons. There is no reason not
to mandate that players wear the stan
dard knee, thigh, hip and tail pads. Sure,
some speedy players will say it slows
them down, but it will also lessen their
chances of getting leg injuries, and other
players' chances of getting concussed by
their flailing limbs, as was the case with
Trufant.
This sort of change is tangible and
will actually make a difference. Fining
James Harrison $25,000 isn't going to
change how he, or anyone else, hits. Es
pecially when the fine comes after a hit
that is entirely within the rules
Changes like the one Johnston sug
gested are what the NFL should be
striving for. It also should be focusing on
better concussion recognition, diagnosis
and treatment which it seems to
have, as reports of concussions have in
creased this season.
In a sport that is predicated on vio
lence, it is difficult not to be violent. As
Herman Edwards of ESPN suggested
on air, young football players need to be
taught the correct way to tackle. You
don't lead with your head, you lead with
your shoulder. You don't roll your back,
you arch it.
As Edwards suggested, nobody is
taught to lead with his head, yet it still
happens. Maybe every training camp,
players should get a refresher course in
the AB Cs of tackling. Or maybe that is a
ridiculous thing to ask of professionals
I'm not really sure.
What I am sure of is that trying to
change players' on-field, instinctual be
