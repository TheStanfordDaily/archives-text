# BYU BESTED

### MILES BENNETT-SMITH STAFF WRITER 
A night after storming back to
win the deciding fifth set over No.
4 BYU, the Stanford men's vol
leyball team beat the Cougars 3-1
on Saturday to finish off a week
end sweep at Burnham Pavilion.
With the two wins, the Cardi
nal jumped up to No. 2 in the lat
est American Volleyball Coaches
Association (AVCA) Division I
rankings right behind USC, and
moved into a tie atop the Moun
tain Pacific Sports Federation
(MPSF) with the Trojans.
Stanford (3-0,2-0 MPSF) head
coach John Kosty was pleased
with the first conference sweep of
BYU since the MPSF series
began in 2001, but remains re
served just two games into a
three-month conference season.

"It's a good start, but we're
going to have to get a lot better if
we want to compete in the MPSF.
BYU is really talented and de
served their very high ranking, so
it was a big win," Kosty said. "But

it's not how you start, it's how you
finish."
The Cardinal certainly did a
good job finishing against BYU
on Saturday. Junior setter Evan
Barry had 48 assists and led a bril
liant offensive game plan, while
junior outside hitter Brad Law

son had 19 kills on the way to a
season-high .412 team hitting av
erage.
Most importantly, a good serv
ice game from Stanford neutral
ized BYU's blocking prowess
a night after having no aces and
21 service errors, the Cardinal fin
ished with seven aces and just 12
errors.
"That was by far the best serv
ing game I've seen so far from us,"
Kosty said. "Whoever wins the
service battle usually wins the
match."
The first set saw Stanford
jump out to an early lead with the
support of a big crowd of 1,033.
But BYU rallied back to take a
15-14 lead after a five-point run
on the back of freshman standout
Taylor Sander.
"Taylor is a great player,"
Kosty said. "He is a strong, physi
cal player who will certainly be a
force to be reckoned with in the
MPSF for years to come."
But Stanford remained com-

posed and didn't blink down the
stretch as BYU put the pressure on,
winning the first set, 25-23.
During the second set, Stanford
really took control. An early 3-1 lead
quickly turned to 8-2, then 12-3, and
finally 17-6, putting the game out of
reach for BYU early on.The key was
an outstanding side-out game
Stanford won 14 of 18 points on
BYU serves, throttling any Cougar
momentum.
"Having the momentum and
then just being on fire was absolute
ly huge for us," Barry said. "When
we have the momentum, we are al
most unstoppable and to come out
with big start was really great."
BYU finally got things going in
the third set, taking a lead at 6-5 and
building off junior outside hitter
Robb Stowell's hot hand. Stowell
was the target of Cardinal fans'
wrath several of them sported
cutouts of his face to taunt him.
Although Stanford ended up
losing the set 26-24 on an Alex
DaPron ace, a four-point Cardinal
run to tie the score at 24 gave Stan
ford momentum heading into the
fourth set.
With Lawson serving, Stanford
took the first four points, and al
though hitting a bit below its match
average, didn't allow BYU much
closer, winning the set 25-22 and
match 3-1.
Friday night was a bit of a differ

ent story, featuring 29 tie scores in a
thrilling five-set match at Maples
Pavilion. Blocking was the story of
the night, as BYU's big front line
had 21 blocks and a large BYU
cheering section kept the match
tight.
With two freshmen on the floor
and three new starters including set
ter Barry, the match was a test of the
young Cardinal's focus. And after
trading the first four sets with the
Cougars, there was cause for con
cern when the Cougars took a 14-12
lead in the final set. But Brad Law
son stepped up and pounded two
consecutive Stanford kills as the
Cardinal pulled even at 14-14.
In all, Stanford fought off three
match points before prevailing on a
block by senior Spencer McLachlin
and freshman Eric Mochalski that
sent the Cardinal and its crowd into
a tizzy on the same floor where it
won the NCAA championship eight
months ago.
For Lawson, the match really
showed what this Cardinal team is
made of.
"The turning point was in the
timeout after we switched sides in
the fifth set. I told the guys, 'this is
where we show our character
against a very good team, this is go
time,'" he said. "We really showed
heart tonight."
Stanford hits the road for the first
time all season as it heads to Flawaii,
home to seven Cardinal players, to
face No. 13 Hawaii for a two-match
MPSF series beginning Friday.
