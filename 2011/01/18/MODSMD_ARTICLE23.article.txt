# BYU BESTED

### MILES BENNETT-SMITH STAFF WRITER 
A night after storming back to
win the deciding fifth set over No.
4 BYU, the Stanford men's vol
leyball team beat the Cougars 3-1
on Saturday to finish off a week
end sweep at Burnham Pavilion.
With the two wins, the Cardi
nal jumped up to No. 2 in the lat
est American Volleyball Coaches
Association (AVCA) Division I
rankings right behind USC, and
moved into a tie atop the Moun
tain Pacific Sports Federation
(MPSF) with the Trojans.
Stanford (3-0,2-0 MPSF) head
coach John Kosty was pleased
with the first conference sweep of
BYU since the MPSF series
began in 2001, but remains re
served just two games into a
three-month conference season.

"It's a good start, but we're
going to have to get a lot better if
we want to compete in the MPSF.
BYU is really talented and de
served their very high ranking, so
it was a big win," Kosty said. "But

it's not how you start, it's how you
finish."
The Cardinal certainly did a
good job finishing against BYU
on Saturday. Junior setter Evan
Barry had 48 assists and led a bril

junior outside hitter Brad Law

son had 19 kills on the way to a
season-high .412 team hitting av
erage.
Most importantly, a good serv
ice game from Stanford neutral
ized BYU's blocking prowess
a night after having no aces and
21 service errors, the Cardinal fin
ished with seven aces and just 12
errors.
"That was by far the best serv
ing game I've seen so far from us,"
Kosty said. "Whoever wins the
service battle usually wins the
match."
The first set saw Stanford
jump out to an early lead with the
support of a big crowd of 1,033.
But BYU rallied back to take a
15-14 lead after a five-point run
on the back of freshman standout
Taylor Sander.
"Taylor is a great player,"
Kosty said. "He is a strong, physi
cal player who will certainly be a
force to be reckoned with in the
MPSF for years to come."
But Stanford remained com-
