## Stanford Says No to War loses ROTC subdomain 
### ELIZABETH TITUS EDITOR IN CHIEF 
In its effort to influence the cam
pus ROTC debate, Stanford Says
No to War faced a minor setback
last week when the University re
voked the group's use of the do
main http://rotc.stanford.edu.
Stanford granted the group the
subdomain earlier this month, and
the group had used it to redirect vis
itors to its site describing its opposi
tion to ROTC. But allowing it was
an inadvertent mistake, said Uni
versity spokeswoman Lisa Lapin,
because the group's use violated
Stanford's computing policy.
The specific issue was that the
subdomain did not match the site's
content and could mislead visitors
to believe it was the official site of
Stanford's ROTC program, Lapin
said. (No such program exists,
though some Stanford students par
ticipate at other schools.)
"They've already been given, ba
sically, real estate in the
stanford.edu domain," said Lapin,
referring to the group's existing
website, http://antiwar.Stanford,
edu. "They're just being told it can't
be called ROTC ... it's not an accu
rate representation."
Sam Windley LL.M. 'll, presi
dent of Stanford Says No to War,
said the group did not dispute the
policy but criticized Information
Technology Services (ITS) for re
voking their ROTC subdomain on
Jan. 11 before notifying the group
and for not immediately providing a
policy explanation.
Windley asked ITS to reinstate
his group's use of the ROTC ad
dress while his group and the Uni
versity discussed policy, but Univer
sity Communications declined.
Meanwhile, the group has been al
lowed to keep its older address,
where its anti-ROTC content is now
located. And it is awaiting a re
sponse from Stanford about
whether it may use a new address,
http://norotc.stanford.edu.
Lapin, who heads the communi
cations office, said Stanford used to
allocate subdomains on a first
come, first-serve basis. About a
year ago, facing increased and
sometimes conflicting demands,
the University drafted a new policy
that attempts to define "appropri
ate" uses.
Now, the policy seeks to "protect
the University's name, avoid confu
sion and reserve domain names so
that the appropriate program [or]
organization . . . can have that
name," Lapin said. The policy al
lows Stanford to revoke any subdo
main it grants and allows owners to
appeal to the University webmas
ter, Scott Stocker, within 14 days.
Windley appealed last week and
Stocker referred him to Lapin, who
discussed the issue with the group's
leader. She said the group could
apply for other domains and invited
Windley to provide feedback on the
process.
Lapin said the draft policy re
mains neutral toward the website's
actual content.
"It has nothing to do with what
that group is about or what con
tent they might put on the page,"
she said. "They already have a
stanford.edu domain, so they are
not being censored in any way.
This is not any kind of infringe
ment on their rights to free
speech."
Stanford has taken similar ac
tion before, Lapin said, citing
"blog" and "istanford" as two ex
amples of subdomains the Univer
sity took from other owners when
it decided it had more appropriate
uses for them. The first now serves
as a directory of Stanford-related
blogs; the latter features Stan
ford's mobile applications but for
merly hosted a project by gradu
ate students in journalism, she
said.
Stanford Says No to War's
members have been outspoken
opponents of ROTC's possible re
turn to campus, which a Faculty
Senate ad hoc committee began
investigating in March. The pro
gram was ended on campus in the
early 19705.
