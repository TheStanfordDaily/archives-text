## Judicial Affairs cases increase 2009-10 sees rise in Honor Code, Fundamental Standard cases 
### ELLEN HUET MANAGING EDITOR 
Judicial Affairs saw an increase in total cases
last year, registering 167 cases in the 2009-2010
academic year compared to 123 cases in the
2008-2009 academic year, according to recently
released statistics.
The Office of Judicial Affairs introduced an
"early resolution option" (ERO) last academic
year that gives students charged with Honor

Code violations the chance to admit responsibil
ity and accept a sanction without having to go to
a hearing, as long as the faculty complainant also
agrees to the option.
"The ERO has been welcomed by students
and faculty, and our data from our assessments
have been positive," said Judicial Affairs assistant
dean Rick Yuen in an e-mail to The Daily. Of the
102 Honor Code cases that went to hearing in
2009-2010, 43 were resolved through the early
option.
The reporting parties for most Judicial Affairs
cases are academic departments, and most de
partments report fewer than five cases a year. In
