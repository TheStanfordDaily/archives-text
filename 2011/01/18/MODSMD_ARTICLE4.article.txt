## Judicial Affairs cases increase 2009-10 sees rise in Honor Code, Fundamental Standard cases 
### ELLEN HUET MANAGING EDITOR 
Judicial Affairs saw an increase in total cases
last year, registering 167 cases in the 2009-2010
academic year compared to 123 cases in the
2008-2009 academic year, according to recently
released statistics.
The Office of Judicial Affairs introduced an
"early resolution option" (ERO) last academic
year that gives students charged with Honor

Code violations the chance to admit responsibil
ity and accept a sanction without having to go to
a hearing, as long as the faculty complainant also
agrees to the option.
"The ERO has been welcomed by students
and faculty, and our data from our assessments
have been positive," said Judicial Affairs assistant
dean Rick Yuen in an e-mail to The Daily. Of the
102 Honor Code cases that went to hearing in
2009-2010, 43 were resolved through the early
option.
The reporting parties for most Judicial Affairs
cases are academic departments, and most de
partments report fewer than five cases a year. In


ANASTASIA YEE/The Stanford Daily
2009-2010, a notable exception was
computer science, with 29 cases. Park
ing and Transportation Services
(P&TS) also reported 32 cases.
P&TS, a new category in this
year's report, encompasses com
plaints of forging residential parking
permits and stealing or altering park
ing permits from others, Yuen said.
The complaints in this category may
have been included in other cate
gories in previous years, such as the
"University staff" category.
Of this year's 102 Honor Code
cases, which mostly include plagia
rism, unpermitted aid and insufficient
citation, students were found respon
sible in 68 cases and not responsible in
five cases; 23 cases did not result in a
hearing. Of the 63 Fundamental Stan

dard cases, which include driving
under the influence and computer
misuse, students were found responsi
ble in 18 cases and not responsible in
one case; 44 cases did not result in a
hearing.
Yuen said that changes in num
bers between years may not always be
indicative of a trend.
"In a particular year, we may expe
rience a spike or higher number of
cases in one department, and this may
be due to the type of case[,] possibly
involving larger numbers of students
in a class or more students over sever
al classes that year in the depart
ment," he said.
Yuen added that the computer sci
ence chair and faculty have been put
ting forth efforts to promote the
Honor Code in their classes, which
traditionally see high rates of viola
tions.
