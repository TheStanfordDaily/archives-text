## Emerson talks'Lost' philosophy Actor; professors unpack themes of hit TV show 
### KABIR SAWHNEY MANAGING EDITOR 
Juxtaposing intellectualism and
popular culture, actor Michael Emer
son discussed the philosophy behind
the hit TV show "Lost" on Saturday
evening in Cubberley Auditorium.
Philosophy professors Joshua Landy
and R. Lanier Anderson interviewed
Emerson on stage in a conversation
that spanned from the show's philo
sophical roots to the driving forces
behind the show's characters and re
lationships.
The discussion was part of the
"Film and Philosophy II" lecture se
ries sponsored by the Division of Lit
eratures, Cultures and Languages.
Emerson's character in "Lost,"
Benjamin Linus, enters the series as
an antagonist, but evolves into a hero
by the show's end.
"We tend to judge our perceived
enemies in a really flat way," he said.
"We make them two-dimensional
'boogeymen.' It's easy and some
how satisfying and comforting to
perceive others that way. So it robs
us of a little of our steam when
they're humanized."
The discussion focused on some
of the philosophical aspects of
"Lost," including the central theme
of good and evil on the Island, the
show's mystical main setting. The
panelists explored the conflict be
tween the Christian ideal of good
trumping evil and the Eastern philos
ophy of balance between the two
forces. Both have a strong presence
in "Lost."
"I think sometimes those symbol
ogies are local rather than general in
the telling of the story," Emerson
said.
"I think overall the writers are in
terested in a pan-religious message,"
he continued. "They're interested in
integration. I think they're attracted
to the idea that a lot of religious sys
tems pose a cosmogony of opposites,
and we see it played out time after
time in the drama of the series."
Emerson often circled back to the
writers of "Lost," giving a rare
glimpse into the thought process of
the show's creative minds.
"The writers are mowing through
material intellectually," he said.
"They'll use whatever they can lay
hands on, and enjoy doing it and
enjoy mixing it up for the audience's
delectation."
Landy and Anderson focused on
the importance of the "Lost" charac
ters' backgrounds and the way in
which events and relationships in
each character's past play a large role
in his or her actions and personalities
throughout the series. Emerson
touched on the theme of the past and
its impact on character Ben Linus.
"Their history humanizes each of
them for us, and draws us into the
story of their development or trans
formation," he said. "I think that in
terests people everywhere this
idea that regardless of our past, we
are perfectible or changeable. We are
as good as the present test, and
everyone on 'Lost' fares better and

better with the present testing."
Some of that narrative, however,
does not apply to Linus. Whereas
some characters' pasts determine
the tests they have to endure to
change, Linus' past has a more per
manent effect on his character.
"Part of him was frozen at the
time of his life-saving baptism," he
said. "Your maturity is often frozen
at the age of your great success."
The panelists dissected the series'
final scenes at length. The final
episode ends with Ben separated
from the rest of show's characters,
sitting alone on a bench.
"Ben doesn't have a partner," he
explained. "My interpretation of the
ending was that people got to enter
the hereafter once they had been
matched up with their mirror re
deemer or their soul counterpart, the
one in whose eyes they could find
forgiveness ... I thought Ben still
needs that."
Despite all his insights, Emerson
said that the show's actors were
often just as in the dark as its audi
ence about the meaning of "Lost,"
particularly the meaning of some of
the show's more obscure references.
When the interviewers told
Emerson that Dogen, one of the
characters introduced late in the se
ries, was named for a type of Eastern
philosophy, Emerson remarked,
"That's great! We don't get footnotes
with the script."
