### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€” Joshua Falk 
About 34,200 students applied
for undergraduate admission to
Stanford this year, showing an in
crease of 7 percent from last year's
32,022 applications.
Bob Patterson, director of un
dergraduate admission, said the
increase in applications was not
unexpected, noting the role that
sharing student and faculty stories
with prospective applicants has
played in generating interest in
the University.
"We took an approach of sharing

student stories and faculty stories,"
Patterson said. "I think those stories
resonated with a lot of prospective
students."
Stanford admitted 754 applicants
in December under the University's
early-action program. The pool of
5,929 early applicants was also the
largest in the University's history.
Last year, Harvard received
30,489 applications, Yale received
25,869 and Princeton received
26,247.
Students who applied under the
regular-decision program will re
ceive their admission decisions by
the end of March.
