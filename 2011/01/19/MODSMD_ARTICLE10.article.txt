## BLENDING DISCIPLINES, 'FINDING SOLUTIONS' Interdisciplinary programs form a fundamental part of Stanford culture 
### ZAHRA TAJI 
At Stanford's last commencement,
President Hennessy spoke of the
challenge of balancing the "old and
new, the innovative and the tradi
tional."
Today, about 20 percent of Stanford's re
search is conducted in interdisciplinary and
multidisciplinary programs. Such programs
cross the hard and fast boundaries that tradi
tionally defined academic disciplines. The
transition is not about breaking walls, but
rather about building bridges for interdiscipli
nary dialogue.
The transition to interdisciplinary pro
grams and research has not always been
smooth, because some departments don't want
their faculty to spend the time outside the de
partment or use grants with such programs.
Education professor Myra Strober has dealt
with these obstacles as the founding director of
the Stanford Center for Research on Women
(now the Clayman Institute for Gender Re
search) in 1974.The institute has been interdis
ciplinary from the beginning and draws upon
various departments, including economics, his
tory and sociology.
"I think one of the things that President
Hennessy has been working on quite success
fully," she said in a phone interview with The
Daily, "is getting departments to realize that
this is, after all, a university, and if the faculty
wants to collaborate outside the department,
that's a good thing."
These days, as people become more and
more specialized within their fields, what com
promises are required of these experts when
taking part in interdisciplinary research?
"You could think about people coming to
gether with their expertise," Strober said. "It's
that expertise that everybody wants."
Dean of Research Ann Arvin described in
terdisciplinary research as "bringing together
your expertise with the goal of adding value,
adding knowledge."
"We always need the disciplines," she
added. "There is no interdisciplinary research
if we don't have well-defined disciplines."
Arvin went on to highlight the unique histo
ry of interdisciplinary research at Stanford.
While "most universities do not have pro
grams like that that are specifically designated
to be interdisciplinary," Stanford" has "struc
tures where people from different schools and
disciplines come together to share their re
search interests."
"That is the long-standing thing at Stan
ford," she added,"and [it] is unusual in terms of
organizational structure."
While interdisciplinary research is going in
new directions all the time and more institu
tions are being founded with the purpose of in
tegrating disciplines, such institutions are part
of Stanford culture.
"Interdisciplinary research is very impor
tant for Stanford's goal of finding solutions,"
Arvin said. "If you look at complicated prob
lems that we face right now, it's not likely that
one discipline will have all the answers...
which is why we are doing this, now in particu
lar."
As a researcher and economist, Strober has
collaborated with historians and social scien
tists to share ideas and methodologies. Such ef
forts have helped all of them reach a much bet
ter understanding than they could have
achieved on their own. Strober sees such col
laboration as a chance to listen to other voices
and learn things you would not have otherwise
considered.
When people come together, Strober said,
"they can learn new things ... put their brains
together, and eventually, possibly come up
with some new way of thinking about a prob
lem or solving a problem that they hadn't be
fore ... because whatever problems we have
climate problems, water problems, poverty
problems those problems don't care about
what discipline people are in."
