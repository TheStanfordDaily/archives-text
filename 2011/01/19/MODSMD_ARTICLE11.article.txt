# STAGING A ONCE-HIDDEN TALENT
## Outside the operating room, Stanford docs find a new gig 
### HELEN ANDERSON 
Music can have a powerful
effect on our brains, re
cent research has shown,
and it doesn't take a pro
fessor to prove it. But, as
the "Hyper Tonics" a rock band com
posed entirely of members of the School
of Medicine's neurology department
know, sometimes even researchers have
to set down their lab notebooks, shed the
white coats, pick up guitars and learn
from experience.
Neurology and neurological sciences
professor and Hyper Tonics lead singer
Christanne Wijman said the idea for the
band first occurred to her when she saw a
group of neurocritical care doctors play
ing music at a medical conference. She
thought, "I could get away with that kind
of stuff. It would be so cool to have a
band."
It just so happened that Wijman had
colleagues who were also musicians, and
gatherings at her house tended to culmi
nate in spontaneous jam sessions.
"I happened to be over here anyway
and there was a keyboard, so I'd start
playing and she'd start singing and Greg
would play the guitar," said neurology
and neurological sciences professor
Frank Longo, referring to colleague
Greg Albers.
Now, the Hyper Tonics are the ones
playing at neurology conferences. They
will also be performing as the opening
event for the Caregivers Concert series, a
project funded by an anonymous donor
where nurses, therapists and physicians
and other caregivers will perform live
music. The first show will take place
Thursday at 7:30 p.m. in the Arrillaga
Alumni Center.
Wijman saw this as the "perfect op
portunity for us to play here at Stanford,
because we had not played at Stanford it
self."
Despite its seemingly natural begin
nings about two and a half years ago, the
band took its current form piece by
piece. The original three members
Wijman, Albers and Longo convinced
neurocritical care fellow Charlene Chen,
a classically trained violinist, to join
them, even though "she's way out of our
league," Albers said.
"I call her our secret weapon because
she makes our band so different, differ
ent than anybody else's band," Wijman
said.
To incorporate the electric violin and
put their own spin on classic songs, the
Hyper Tonics often substitute a violin
solo for the traditional electric guitar
solo.
"It's one of the reasons 'Ants March
ing' just kind of fell into our lap," said
drummer and professor of medicine
Paul Singh, the newest member of the
group. "It's a great violin part. It's a

good band song."
After Chen, clinical assistant profes
sor Viet Nguyen joined. Nguyen plays
electric guitar, trades off playing bass
with Albers and sometimes sings for the
group. He's also part of a local band
called "Robustitron," for which he writes
original songs.
Nguyen "got sucked in gradually over
time. Initially he was only going to play
for our gigs, and then he started practic
ing with us, and then we started doing
new songs and now he's running the
whole band," Wijman laughed.
Singh completed the group. After
playing drums with a series of bands in
high school and college, he switched
gears and began to write songs for guitar
and bass.
"I did the singer-songwriter thing for
four years or so," Singh said. "And then I

Wijman had colleagues
who were musicians, and
gatherings at her
house tended to culminate
in spontaneous
jam sessions.

never thought I was going to play again.
Then, they had a group, and the opportu
nity presented itself."
Finding Singh was a fortuitous event
for the HyperTonics, who had embarked
on an agonizing search for a drummer.
"It was really like a miracle," Wijman
said. "So [you have] the three younger
kids in the band, who are really talented
and actually musically trained, and then
you have the three older people. We're
somewhat trained, but we're sort of the
homegrown part of the band."
This age discrepancy contributed to a
shift in repertoire for the group.
"We were doing 'Flotel California,'
The Who, Creedence, but now we do
some more modern things," Albers said.
"We did more faculty parties or birthday
parties. We didn't have the bass, we didn't
have the drums, so we were doing light
rock, mellow stuff. But now it's differ
ent."
Their program for the Caregivers
Concert still includes classics like "Be

hind Blue Eyes," but added to those are
contemporary hits like "Apologize" and
"Hey There Delilah."
The addition of the newer members
also meant a change of venue.
"We've outgrown birthday parties.
We don't fit in the house anymore," Wij
man said. "We're too loud and too big.
Now we're playing at conferences."
Their first big show took place in Sep
tember at a club in San Francisco as part
of a neurocritical care meeting. They are
also scheduled for gigs at two upcoming
conferences, Los Angeles in February
and Honolulu in April.
Professional to Personal
A group of neurologists might not be
the first thing that comes to mind at the
mention of the words "rock band," but all
of the Hyper Tonics agree that playing
music together has strengthened their
formerly professional relationships.
"It's something completely different
than what we do at work," Longo said.
"It's more expressive and artistic. Al
though in research you try to be creative,
this is sort of a different outlet for being
creative."
"It's nice to leave work behind and
have something that's a diversion," Al
bers added. "Work is really busy. We have
fairly demanding jobs, particularly these
guys [Chen and Singh]. They're on call al
most every other night. We always have
somebody in the band on call. Often two
people at once. We're trying to practice
and the beepers are going off we lose
our drummer for a couple songs because
he's dealing with a stroke code."
But the experience of playing music
together is more than worth the struggle
to fit band practice into the members'
hectic schedules.
"My father's not a musician himself,
but he always said, 'What's better than
playing in a band with your friends?"'
Wijman said. "He said it many times. He
never did it himself. But now I'm doing it,
and it's too bad he's not around to watch
it, because he would have loved it."
If band practice could be considered
research, the Hyper Tonics have made
some important discoveries.
"Making music puts me in a totally
different mental state," Wijman said.
"Truly. It's like a drug, almost. A good
drug."
If happiness can be found anywhere,
it's here in the ambient glow of Wijman's
living room, where Singh's drum set re
places a coffee table on the alphabet-pat
terned rug, the laughter of some of the
members' children bubbles in from an
adjacent room and, amid the sporadic
piano chords and cymbal taps, Albers's
guitar riff from "All Right Now" carries
through the glass walls and winds down
Mayfield Ave.

group. "It's a great violin part. It's a

good band song."
After Chen, clinical assistant profes
sor Viet Nguyen joined. Nguyen plays
electric guitar, trades off playing bass
with Albers and sometimes sings for the
group. He's also part of a local band
called "Robustitron," for which he writes
original songs.
Nguyen "got sucked in gradually over
time. Initially he was only going to play
for our gigs, and then he started practic
ing with us, and then we started doing
new songs and now he's running the
whole band," Wijman laughed.
Singh completed the group. After
playing drums with a series of bands in
high school and college, he switched
gears and began to write songs for guitar
and bass.
"I did the singer-songwriter thing for
four years or so," Singh said. "And then I

house tended to culminate
in spontaneous
jam sessions.

never thought I was going to play again.
Then, they had a group, and the opportu
nity presented itself."
Finding Singh was a fortuitous event
for the HyperTonics, who had embarked
on an agonizing search for a drummer.
"It was really like a miracle," Wijman
said. "So [you have] the three younger
kids in the band, who are really talented
and actually musically trained, and then
you have the three older people. We're
somewhat trained, but we're sort of the
homegrown part of the band."
This age discrepancy contributed to a
shift in repertoire for the group.
"We were doing 'Flotel California,'
The Who, Creedence, but now we do
some more modern things," Albers said.
"We did more faculty parties or birthday
parties. We didn't have the bass, we didn't
have the drums, so we were doing light
rock, mellow stuff. But now it's differ
ent."
Their program for the Caregivers
Concert still includes classics like "Be

hind Blue Eyes," but added to those are
contemporary hits like "Apologize" and
"Hey There Delilah."
The addition of the newer members
also meant a change of venue.
"We've outgrown birthday parties.
We don't fit in the house anymore," Wij
man said. "We're too loud and too big.
Now we're playing at conferences."
Their first big show took place in Sep
tember at a club in San Francisco as part
of a neurocritical care meeting. They are
also scheduled for gigs at two upcoming
conferences, Los Angeles in February
and Honolulu in April.
Professional to Personal
A group of neurologists might not be
the first thing that comes to mind at the
mention of the words "rock band," but all
of the Hyper Tonics agree that playing
music together has strengthened their
formerly professional relationships.
"It's something completely different
than what we do at work," Longo said.
"It's more expressive and artistic. Al
though in research you try to be creative,
this is sort of a different outlet for being
creative."
"It's nice to leave work behind and
have something that's a diversion," Al
bers added. "Work is really busy. We have
fairly demanding jobs, particularly these
guys [Chen and Singh]. They're on call al
most every other night. We always have
somebody in the band on call. Often two
people at once. We're trying to practice
and the beepers are going off we lose
our drummer for a couple songs because
he's dealing with a stroke code."
But the experience of playing music
together is more than worth the struggle
to fit band practice into the members'
hectic schedules.
"My father's not a musician himself,
but he always said, 'What's better than
playing in a band with your friends?"'
Wijman said. "He said it many times. He
never did it himself. But now I'm doing it,
and it's too bad he's not around to watch
it, because he would have loved it."
If band practice could be considered
research, the Hyper Tonics have made
some important discoveries.
"Making music puts me in a totally
different mental state," Wijman said.
"Truly. It's like a drug, almost. A good
drug."
If happiness can be found anywhere,
it's here in the ambient glow of Wijman's
living room, where Singh's drum set re
places a coffee table on the alphabet-pat
terned rug, the laughter of some of the
members' children bubbles in from an
adjacent room and, amid the sporadic
piano chords and cymbal taps, Albers's
guitar riff from "All Right Now" carries
through the glass walls and winds down
Mayfield Ave.

Music can have a powerful
effect on our brains, re
cent research has shown,
and it doesn't take a pro
fessor to prove it. But, as
the "Hyper Tonics" a rock band com
posed entirely of members of the School
of Medicine's neurology department
know, sometimes even researchers have
to set down their lab notebooks, shed the
white coats, pick up guitars and learn
from experience.
Neurology and neurological sciences
professor and Hyper Tonics lead singer
Christanne Wijman said the idea for the
band first occurred to her when she saw a
group of neurocritical care doctors play
ing music at a medical conference. She
thought, "I could get away with that kind
of stuff. It would be so cool to have a
band."
It just so happened that Wijman had
colleagues who were also musicians, and
gatherings at her house tended to culmi
nate in spontaneous jam sessions.
"I happened to be over here anyway
and there was a keyboard, so I'd start
playing and she'd start singing and Greg
would play the guitar," said neurology
and neurological sciences professor
Frank Longo, referring to colleague
Greg Albers.
Now, the Hyper Tonics are the ones
playing at neurology conferences. They
will also be performing as the opening
event for the Caregivers Concert series, a
project funded by an anonymous donor
where nurses, therapists and physicians
and other caregivers will perform live
music. The first show will take place
Thursday at 7:30 p.m. in the Arrillaga
Alumni Center.
Wijman saw this as the "perfect op
portunity for us to play here at Stanford,
because we had not played at Stanford it
self."
Despite its seemingly natural begin
nings about two and a half years ago, the
band took its current form piece by
piece. The original three members
Wijman, Albers and Longo convinced
neurocritical care fellow Charlene Chen,
a classically trained violinist, to join
them, even though "she's way out of our
league," Albers said.
"I call her our secret weapon because
she makes our band so different, differ
ent than anybody else's band," Wijman
said.
To incorporate the electric violin and
put their own spin on classic songs, the
Hyper Tonics often substitute a violin
solo for the traditional electric guitar
solo.
"It's one of the reasons 'Ants March
ing' just kind of fell into our lap," said
drummer and professor of medicine
Paul Singh, the newest member of the
group. "It's a great violin part. It's a

good band song."
