## LOOKING UP Do You Know Me? 
### Nina M. Chung 
I always wonder how we can possi
bly know anybody else, especial
ly since we never stop getting to
know ourselves. When I was much
younger, this was my first crazy
philosophical puzzle: that a certain
me was inexplicably bound inside
this walking, talking container of a
thing, and everyone else was suppos
edly in the same position. It boggled
my mind. No one could ever really
reach the mental interior goings-on
of anyone else. (Sometimes I also
thought: how did I know that every
one else was actually not a robot! ?)
I still get totally caught up in that
youthful quandary. Nowadays,
though, the question has translated
itself into one of perception: the
ways people figure each other out,
and the ways we do it incorrectly.
You already know the endless ex
amples. A friend of mine had a bad
freshman experience pursuing a
guy friend of hers, realizing later
that it was caused only by her own
high school dream of college rela
tionships rather than his person.
Another of my friends is/was dating
a guy whose transcript blatantly ex
hibits a superficial pattern of pre
ferred types, though he somehow
seems unaware. As for me, reflect
ing on the guys who have shown in
terest in me before, I find myself
growing increasingly suspicious
that quite a few of them never gen
uinely knew me. What they did
know was the pleasant side of me
and an overall, filled-in idea.
Whether for being in love or for
hate, we're always explaining the
reasons why. As we try to justify our
emotions, we presume we know the
other's character type enough to
pinpoint their highlights or flaws.
But it must be so much more arbi
trary than we think. Otherwise, how
could a personality trait that starts
off so attractive in the beginning be
come such a turn-off? You've surely
experienced the speed at which
someone's initially funny habit
turns into an intolerably obnoxious
one. It calls into question whether,
when we find ourselves drawn to
someone, we are truly drawn to
them ... or to the idea we've creat
ed of them. People are creative, our
minds take flight and we are entire
ly capable of drawing up the reali
ties we live in. This means, however,
that sometimes what we think we
see in someone has more to do with
our own situation than theirs.
It seems that inevitably, unknow
ingly and intricately we label our
peers in one way or another. Hu
mans are natural organizers. This is
why stereotypes and judgments
exist they are the conscious and
subconscious categories useful in an
unpredictable world. And I'm be
ginning to see how easy it is for ini
tial impressions to become perma
nent conclusions that don't quite fit.
Most of the time, it's only in retro
spect that we realize how mistaken
ly we interpreted a personality, or
how forcefully we imposed our own
ideals on it.

This unintended artificiality of
many relationships is a reality into
which we step neatly throughout
our college walk. Here, it's very pos
sible to see only one side of some
one, all the time next to them in
class twice a week, down the hall be
cause you're dormmates, at the
night meetings of your student
group. In all of these situations, it's
almost frightening how unaware we
can be of someone's total person
simply because we see them only in
one setting. It's such a supremely
simple thing to settle our definition
of someone after single-context ex
posures. But people are cryptic
kaleidoscope puzzles. When we for
get that, we take single facets and
make masterpieces out of them.
Like I said, we all have an amazing
creative capacity, a natural talent
we use to color the characters of
those around us.
It's just that I've been thinking
lately about the minority group of
people in my life who know me.
They're the friends with whom life
catch-ups are never wholly neces
sary, and the family who's grown
with me and beside me. They're the
ones who not only see, but also hon
estly accept the parts of me of which
I'm not proud. And I've even been
lucky enough to meet some of these
people here on this campus, too.
I don't want to take it for grant
ed. It's so unique to connect with
someone deeply enough that you
begin to see them clearly, even
when you're not with them all the
time. In that same vein, though, I've
also realized how often I assume
I've figured out a person and how
often they obviously think they've
done the same about me. But for
most of these individuals whose
lives have spontaneously, unexpect
edly come into contact with our
own, that is a bit much to assume,
isn't it?

The question has
translated into
one of perception.
