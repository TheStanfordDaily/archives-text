## Ski Trip: How to Make it Longer and Stranger 
### Peter McDonald 
Do your work in the car. Most
likely the car assignment is
random and you don't really
know anyone else riding in it, and
most Stanford kids suck at long car
ride conversations anyway. I know
that you brought work; you're a
Stanford student, but you're not
going to do it in any significant
quantity, not while you're there.
You don't really want to be that
lame. Remember, it's not just Ski
Trip's job to entertain you. You also
have to bring something to the
table, because if you care at all
about your social circles, then Ski
Trip, while predictable, tedious,
pointless, unnecessary, classist and
disappointing, is all that you have.
First off, despite how your fresh
man RAs may have sold it, unless
you are planning an acid-fueled
coke binge for the weekend, it is not
Snow Trip. It's Ski Trip. I understand
that this rebranding may be an at
tempt to disassociate Ski Trip from
skiing and all its exclusionary white
upper-class trappings, but calling it
Snow Trip reinforces everything I
hate about California. Even though
I've never actually skied/boarded
on Ski Trip, since having learned to
ski in Ohio has made me afraid of
anything resembling a real moun
tain, I still refuse to believe that any
one paid $5O and drove eight hours
just to pretend that they're in the
Winter 2011 edition of the Land's
End catalog. It's just snow, people.
It's really not that exciting. Also, hot
tubs are overrated and cause people
with body image issues to feel even
more insecure.
That said, I do have to hand it to
the concept of Ski Trip for making
Lake Tahoe egalitarian. I imagine in
other, more Kal-like schools, all the
rich kids take off for weekends dur
ing the winter because, you know,

their parents have a little place up in
Tahoe, which is really beautiful in
the winter, and if you want to see it
you have to kiss their asses through
out all of fall. Instead, everyone gets
a chance to see what the Tahoe hub
bub is all about with only minimal
planning involved. In that sense, Ski
Trip is unmistakably Stanford: A
tradition that tries really hard to be
radically inclusive but can't shake
its privileged roots and ends up re
vealing them by accident.
Because though skiing at Kirk
wood (only losers go to Heavenly)
is usually not billed as the main at
traction, it's pretty much the only
thing to do during the day, and it's
that revelation, which usually
comes around 11 a.m., that makes
all the non-skiers question why
they're even here in the first place.
For the houses/groups that suck, the
day usually consists of a series of
half-hearted attempts to have fun
until night when everyone who
brought alcohol can start drinking.
If you're lucky, enough people will
want to watch the NFL playoffs.
For Ski Trips where people ac
tually like each other, though, the
weekend is a chance to confirm or
deny stereotypes, for each group
to impose its own vision of an en
tire weekend of fun without the
specter of administrative over
sight. Synergy gets naked, frats
hold epic Beirut matches for all
the Tostitos, Phi Psi brings a killer
XBOX 360 set-up, Kairos believes

they've already done everything
interesting, certain unnamed
places are taking shrooms, the cool
freshman dorms have been drink
ing all weekend and the Earth Sci
ences people explore the wilder
ness and actually know what
they're doing. It's kind of a pretty
accurate snapshot of the various
scenes on campus at the pinnacle
of their debauchery.
But there's a dark side to those
people's Ski Trips as well, because
now their Ski Trip has the burden of
expectations. All of a sudden, Ski
Trip is supposed to be the time for
that magical bonding that's sup
posed to occur, or it's the perfect
time to make a move on that person
you've been eyeing or for one of
those epic college stories that you'll
remember for years to come to hap
pen. You can at the very least assert
yourself as one of those cool, hip
college students to whom mar
keters dream about catering. In
pretty much all of the items on that
check list, Ski Trip usually disap
points, but not always.
If everyone involved brings their
partying A-game and is determined
to have fun for the weekend then,
assuming an adequate supply of al
cohol, you just might have a Ski Trip
worthy of making T-shirts. Howev
er, we're still at school, and some of
you have midterms and stuff com
ing up, even the people on whom
you can usually count to make par
ties fun. They may think that they
can't spend a weekend away from
campus, because they have eight
hour problem sets to do. Oh wait,
that's the length of the car ride. You
can do your work in the car.
