## Mid-Year Evaluation 
### KRISTIAN BAILEY '14 Daily Fellow 
Though I've now been in class for two
weeks since Mid Year Convocation, I feel
even more nervous and even less certain
about how the rest of the quarter and the rest of
my freshman year will pan out.
I loved freshman fall being surrounded
by the most diverse group of people (ethnical
ly, geographically, interest- and belief-wise)
I've ever been around; being constantly
amazed at the beauty of Stanford's campus
and marveling at my presence in such a fortu
nate community; and witnessing the most suc
cessful football season in school history, cul
minating in my taking a trip down to Miami
for the Orange Bowl.
I am 100 percent happy with my choice to at
tend Stanford and could not have any more
love for the people, the place, its values, etc.
Yet, despite these experiences and feelings, I
have some moments of trepidation, which
began over winter break as I started to think
about the coming months.
If last quarter was characterized by a sense
of empowerment and endless opportunities for
success, this one is marked by a sense of uncer
tainty and a fear of failure. These feelings are
carrying over into the present.
My fall quarter grades were the best I've
ever had and one of my papers was nominated
for a writing award, which gave me and my fam
ily large reasons to celebrate. Yet, I tried (and to
some degree still try) to discredit myself I
had only taken 14 units, I didn't take any math
or science classes, there were plenty of smarter
kids than I; I had simply gotten lucky.
Deep inside I know that my family and
friends are not expecting me to maintain such
high standards my grandmother told me so
over the phone Monday afternoon, saying that
all she and my family want is for me to try my

best.
I also know that my fall quarter success was
n't an accident. In fact, I attribute part of the
outcome to a moment of enlightenment I had
in October, when Vice Provost Elam addressed
the Black Student Union at its convocation.
He spoke about the notion of "stereotype
threat" as an issue among black students.
Stereotype threat is a phenomenon in which an
individual internalizes a negative stereotype as
sociated with a group to which he belongs, in
turn actualizing the stereotype and performing
to a lesser degree than he otherwise could and
is something I believe I experienced, with stan
dardized testing and math and science classes
in high school.
Hearing that I should view Stanford as a
place where I belonged and where I had the po
tential to succeed in many capacities gave me
the empowerment I needed, right as I was be
ginning to doubt my place at Stanford.
Regardless of these feelings, something
within me is afraid to try afraid to take on 18
units, afraid to confront a new quarter of SLE,
with more reading, writing that is more inten
sive and higher expectations for the quality of
my work.
We're already in the third week of the quar
ter and I feel time rushing by faster than it al
ready has. Shopping classes was stressful, as I
joined a four-unit class during its fifth meeting.
And being one step closer to having to choose
a major has made me worry about being able to
explore my options in time to make the right
choice, not to mention worry about when I'm
going to figure out what I want to do with my
life after college.
This general uncertainty has been unpro
ductive. My assignments are very physically in
front of me, as are the words on the pages when

I open the assignments up, but I haven't worked
up the determination to catch up, and eventual
ly get ahead, in my work.
My purpose is not to create a cause for
worry among my family or friends; it is to hope
fully give other freshmen who are feeling simi
larly an opportunity to create a dialogue.
The tone of Mid Year Convocation seemed
to suggest that nervousness and uncertainty are
common for some, if not many, freshmen at this
time of the year. And the messages relayed by
Convocation and The Resilience Project, which
was introduced at the conclusion of the event

that failure is not the end of the world and
has made University alumni and leaders much
stronger resonate especially well.
This is the most I've sat down to concentrate
and write all quarter. I think my tone may come
off in a gloomier manner than I would desire;
either that, or I'm in denial about what I actual
ly feel.
Regardless, expressing these thoughts is the
first step toward breaking through this block.
