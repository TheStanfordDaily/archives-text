## CARD TUMBLES Top-ranked Stanford falls to Cal in close contest 
### JESSICA YU STAFF WRITER 
In its first official competition of the season,
the No. 1 Stanford men's gymnastics team fell
to No. 5 California, 349.650-348.700, in front of
a packed crowd at Burnham Pavilion on Fri
day evening.
The Cardinal found itself with an early lead
after the first rotation. Competing on floor ex
ercise, senior Josh Dixon demonstrated his
ability and reliability on the apparatus with a
score of 15.0 while freshman Cale Robinson in
troduced himself to Cardinal fans with a score
of 14.9. These scores afforded Stanford a team
total of 58.7 and a lead of 2.1 as the men read
ied themselves for their next event.
On pommel horse, traditionally the Cardi
nal's weakest event, the Stanford men strug
gled. Sophomore Jason Stevens and redshirt
sophomore John Martin posted the team's top
scores with a 13.95 each, but Stanford's lead
over Cal dwindled to just 1.6 points.
The meet looked optimistic once again for
the Card after still rings, a solid and strong event
for Stanford. Senior co-captain Tim Gentry
posted an impressive 15.4, while senior Ryan
Lieberman and redshirt senior Nicholas Noone
posted scores of 14.85 and 14.5, respectively.
After the Cardinal's fourth rotation on
vault, Stanford's chances were looking even
better. Dixon and senior Alex Buscaglia sat
atop Stanford's leaderboard with identical
scores of 15.8. Stevens added a 15.65 and
Lieberman contributed a 15.5, giving the Car
dinal a team total of 62.75 and a 3.5-point lead
over the Golden Bears.
However, the success was short-lived
after the Cardinal's turn on parallel bars, the
outlook again turned sour. Lieberman, the
2010 NCAA parallel bars champion, fell dur
ing his routine, as did two-time All-American
Noone, After Cal aced several routines on the
high bar, the Bears took over a 3.0-point lead
over the Cardinal.
And although Stanford finishing with gusto
on high bar with impressive scores from
Dixon and Buscaglia at 15.05 and 14.95, re
spectively â€” Stanford's fate was sealed. Cal
performed well on parallel bars, hanging on to
its lead and sealing the competition.
Volunteer assistant coach Greg Ter-Za
khariants put a positive spin on the loss, noting
that Friday's defeat may be useful for the team
in the long run.
"In 2009, [Stanford] did not win a single
meet until the NCAA Championship," he said.
"In 2010, we won almost every single meet ex
cept the NCAA Championship. We're revert
ing back to our 2009 strategy to get ready for
April."
But despite Ter-Zakhariants' optimism, the
Stanford men are not complacent after the
loss.
"After last year's second-place finish, we re
alized we have to leave no room for question,"
said head coach Thom Glielmi.
The Cardinal will face Cal again next Satur
day at 7 p.m. in Burnham Pavilion.

against California last Friday with a strong floor exercise. The Cardinal held a 2.1 -point lead over
the Golden Bears after the opening event but was unable to maintain its edge as the day wore on.
