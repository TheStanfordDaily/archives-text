The No. 23 Stanford wrestling team experi
enced success at the Lone Star Duals in Texas last
Saturday, with victories over The Citadel, Brown
and Harvard and a single loss to No. 17 Nebraska.
The Card (7-6) was led by dominant performanc
es from senior Zack Giesen, junior Nick
Amuchastegui, redshirt sophomore Timmy
Boone, sophomore Ryan Mango and freshman
Dan Schere, all of whom went undefeated on the
day.
Stanford opened the competition with a 23-12
decision over The Citadel followed by a 26-12 win

over Brown, taking seven of the 10 bouts in each
dual. The Card narrowly lost a close dual to the
Nebraska squad, 19-17, with both teams taking
five bouts apiece. In its last matchup of the day,
the Cardinal bounced back with a 35-10 rout of
Harvard to go 3-1 on the day.
Giesen, who went 4-0 in the duals and remains
perfect on the season at 13-0, recorded his 100 th
