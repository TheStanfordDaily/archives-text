# Coaching diversity a must

As Stanford's football
program continues its
transition into the
David Shaw era, an
interesting factoid
came to my attention yesterday.
Stanford is now the only BCS-con
ference school to have a black head
coach in both football and men's bas
ketball, the two most prominent
sports in collegiate athletics. To be
completely honest, I find it surprising
that this fact hasn't been more wide
ly publicized, as it points toward
Stanford's progressive outlook and
the hurdles that minorities continue
to face in the coaching ranks.
Before I continue, let me clarify
my own viewpoint on the issue of mi
nority head coaches in college sports,
including at Stanford. I know that
there are plenty of qualified minority
coaches out there, but I would never
advocate for any sort of "quota" in
terms of how many programs must
have minority coaches at the helm. If
a program is looking for a new coach,
it can and should hire whoever gives
it the best chance to win, regardless of
ethnicity.
