# Coaching diversity a must
## 
### Kabir Sawhney Follow the Money 
As Stanford's football
program continues its
transition into the
David Shaw era, an
interesting factoid
came to my attention yesterday.
Stanford is now the only BCS-con
ference school to have a black head
coach in both football and men's bas
ketball, the two most prominent
sports in collegiate athletics. To be
completely honest, I find it surprising
that this fact hasn't been more wide
ly publicized, as it points toward
Stanford's progressive outlook and
the hurdles that minorities continue
to face in the coaching ranks.
Before I continue, let me clarify
my own viewpoint on the issue of mi
nority head coaches in college sports,
including at Stanford. I know that
there are plenty of qualified minority
coaches out there, but I would never
advocate for any sort of "quota" in
terms of how many programs must
have minority coaches at the helm. If
a program is looking for a new coach,
it can and should hire whoever gives
it the best chance to win, regardless of
ethnicity.
However, the main issue with mi
nority candidates is one of access
head-coaching vacancies are often
filled through coaching networks,
which can be hard for minorities to
break into. After all, head-coaching
openings aren't exactly listed on Ca
reerßuilder.com athletic direc
tors have significant discretion in
conducting a search and choosing
who they would like to lead the pro
gram.
With this reality in mind, Stanford
should become a leader in helping
minority coaches around the NCAA
gain access to coaching and adminis
trative positions. Stanford's sterling
reputation in the athletic community
would lend weight and credibility to
any push for change at the confer
ence and national level.
The lack of minorities in the FBS
head-coaching ranks has been well
documented, and out of the 120 FBS
schools, fewer than 15 currently have
black head coaches.
Stanford also has a track record of
hiring minority coaches with great
success our last Rose Bowl ap
pearance came with Tyrone Willing
ham leading the program, and he was
subsequently hired away by storied
Notre Dame.
On the basketball front, Stanford
has seen steady improvement under
head coach Johnny Dawkins. The
team is off to a strong start this sea
son, and Dawkins has proven to be a
top-notch recruiter this year's
freshman class has already had a sig
nificant impact on the team.
But beyond simply advocating
for increased access, how can Stan
ford go about securing expanded op
portunities for minority coaches?
One model is the NFL's Rooney
Rule, which mandates that teams
with head coach and GM vacancies

interview at least one minority can
didate before making any contract
offers. I've had my issues with the
rule in the past since it encourages
"token" interviews of minority
candidates who have no real
chance of getting the job. Never
theless, it is better than nothing and
would be a positive step toward en
suring a fair opportunity for all
qualified coaches.
While it's unlikely that anything
of this sort could get accomplished
at the NCAA level (heck, I don't
even know if the NCAA has that
kind of power), a good start would
be to see if the member schools of
the Pac-12 could voluntarily agree to
submit themselves to such a policy.
After all, at the end of the day, this
type of requirement would not inter
fere in any way with the athletic di
rector's ability to choose whichever
candidate he felt was best for the job.
Another possibility is for Shaw to
become college football's version of
Tony Dungy, the former Indianapo
lis Colts head coach who was the first
black coach to win a Super Bowl.
Dungy is extremely well-respected
around the NFL, and his success and
well-documented community in
volvement paved the way for other
black coaches to make their mark in
the pros. There is no comparable fig
ure in college football, and Shaw,
who is young and charismatic, could
follow in that mold.
Of course, that is contingent on
Stanford football maintaining its cur

rent position as a national power,
and keeping that status is Shaw's first
priority. Indeed, success is probably
the best thing that anyone can do to
promote minority coaches, as a high
ly visible example of success will per
suade other athletic directors and
programs to follow in Stanford's
footsteps.

Just last week, Kabir devoted an entire
column to why the Rooney Rule needs
to be reevaluated. Ask him which side
he's really on at ksawhney@stanford.
