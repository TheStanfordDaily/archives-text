# An ode to Stanford athletics
## 
### Zach Zimmerman Dishing the Rock 
This is my last hurrah of sorts
before I take a five-month
hiatus to fulfill my role as
editor in chief. Writing a
weekly sports column has
become a staple of my life, and with
out getting too romantic, it's gonna be
missed.
Sports played a significant role in
my Stanford experience long before
my coast-to-coast flight touched
down at SFO in 2008. Contrary to the
advice of college counselors around
the nation, my choice of where to at
tend school was based largely on the
strength of the athletics program and
the absurdity of the student section
(this was the one time where the
Tree's arrest for public intoxication
positively influenced a young person's
future).
And believe it or not, for the final
question on the application of why I
wanted to attend Stanford, I an
swered, in slightly more eloquent
terms, that, "I fully support any school
that wipes the smug look off the face
of the USC football program."
It was truly a match made in heav
en. I could attend one of the most illus
trious academic institutions in the
world while studying in the presence
of first-round draft picks, Olympic
gold medalists and Hall of Fame
coaches. I mean, at what other school
can you legitimately say that a Heis
man Trophy runner-up sat in front of
you in lecture for a complicated com
puter science course? Toby Gerhart
may not be getting too many touches
on the Vikings behind All-Pro Adrian
Peterson, but I guarantee you he's
more familiar with Java than any of his
teammates.
What's more beautiful is that Car
dinal athletes aren't placed on a glori
fied pedestal for us average folk to
ogle at. No. We live, eat, socialize and
learn together. On the first day of New
Student Orientation, I walked into my
two-room triple in Branner to find a
mom putting the final touches on her
son's setup. Seeing a few ribbons and
other running memorabilia, I asked if
her son was a runner. She said yes, and
that he was currently at cross country
practice.
What happened next is something
I will never forget. I made some sort of
smartass remark like, "He must be
fast!" That was before I Googled
Chris Derrick.
I've always been a sports fan and I
can't even begin to recount all of the
ways that I've been impacted, both
positively and negatively, by Stanford
athletics. However, sometimes it's dif
ficult to understand the value of sports
on a campus that is brimming with in
tellectual power and technological in
novation. Why should we invest our
time and money into games that don't
provide any clear long-term benefits
for the world? It's a question that, at
times, I've struggled to answer and
one that resonates throughout the
school.
But if you've been to any sporting
event and seen your classmates work
ing their tails off on the field, you
know why. This university may not be
Harvard in terms of tear-producing,
heart-wrenching competition, but
Stanford is no field of daisies. It's a cut
throat environment. We are constant
ly challenging one another for job op
portunities and academic recognition,
sometimes to the extent that we aren't
proud of our actions. It's a tough real
ity to deal with.
That's where sports come in. At
football games, the Red Zone takes
the Saturday off and forgets about the
4.0s and the problem sets. For supern
erds, we get a little wild. Bodies are
painted, flasks are snuck in and cama
raderie is everywhere. Bottom line,
kids are genuinely happy.
Happiness is all it comes down to,
and it's what I believe justifies the
huge presence of sports on this cam
pus. Sure, you can point to the finan
cial benefits, community interaction
and dozens of other reasons, but at the
end of the day, this whole "college ex
perience" would absolutely stink if we
were miserable people.
Sports are, have been and will for
ever be my release. Embrace Stanford
athletics, and Stanford athletics will
embrace you.
