The Daily mistakenly printed the
Nov. 19, 2010, women's basketball
story yesterday. In its place should
have been a recap of Stanford's se
ries in Washington last weekend,
which it swept. Stanford (14-2, 5-0
Pac-10) defeated the UW Huskies,
80-51, on Friday, before traveling to
Pullman to take on the Washington
State Cougars, whom it cruised past
by a score of 94-50. The Cardinal will
host UCLA at 7 p.m. this Thursday
and USC at 2 p.m. on Saturday. The
full story is at stanforddaily.com.
