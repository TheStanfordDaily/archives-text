## Panel discusses 'better' Internet Law students weigh in on anonymity, cyhersecurity 
### ERIN INMAN STAFF WRITER 
Law students proposed new solu
tions to Internet problems, from those
as common as a forgotten password to
ones as high-profile as human rights ac
tivism and free speech, in "Four Ideas
for a Better Internet," held Tuesday
night at Stanford.

Co-sponsored by Stanford Center
for Internet and Society and the Berk
man Center for Internet & Society at
Harvard, the event featured four TED
style talks on cybersecurity, diplomatic
transparency, crowdsourcing and priva
cy and reputation. Four student groups
from a collaborative three-week semi
nar between Harvard Law and Stan
ford Law attempted to address difficult
problems in cyberspace while a panel of
special guests in the field weighed in.
"Think what you have stored online,
every picture you take, every friend
you've ever had ... but for others, the

stakes are even higher," said Zak Cox, a
Harvard law student in a group propos
ing an online security council of friends.
Currently, the solution to security in
volves either a door with a bunch of
locks or a big wall, Cox said. Often, how
ever, these "locks," or security ques
tions, can be answered with a quick scan
of the target's public Facebook.
Instead of allowing social graphs to
compromise privacy, the group drew off
Section IV of the 25th Amendment,
which allows the vice president to over
ride the president, in proposing a
structure "where your friends have
your back," he said. The idea relies
on a friend-based social cabinet ca
pable of stepping in to preserve the
online identity of a friend in danger
of compromise.
Under this proposal, appointed
trustees would monitor suspicious
activity on a user's account.
The proposed model could solve
problems as trivial as requesting a
password change to problems as
life-threatening as disclosing a cap
tured human rights activists' valu
able online accounts, said Harvard
student Heather Casteel, a member
of the same group.
"There haven't been many
ways for people to take privacy
into their own hands other than
changing privacy settings," said
communication major Crystal
Nwaneri 'l3. "By going to friends
to develop a social cabinet, they're

giving people a chance to make
sure there's others looking out for
the online presence that we're
slowly developing."
Another group attempted to ad
dress preserving anonymity in a
human rights context with an organ
ization that would enable, protect
and promote human-rights media.
Although video has unparalleled
ability to create progress in human
rights, its capacity is limited by the
ability to safely and securely upload
said videos, said Stanford law stu
dent Camille Fletcher.
While many videos of human
rights injustices have gone viral on
mediums such as You Tube, the
group argued that the Internet lacks
a non-hierarchical organization re
sistant to pressure.
Their platform would be a non
profit immune to pressure and capa
ble of maintaining source anonymi
ty. The organization would receive
videos and either publish them inde
pendently or contact an affiliate
media group.
