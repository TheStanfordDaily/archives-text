# STANFORD FACES EFFECTS OF UC CUTS
## Governor proposes millions in cuts for state universities 
### ELLORA ISRANI STAFF WRITER 
Though the budget woes
of the state of California seem
remote underneath the um
brella of Stanford's multibil
lion-dollar endowment, the
latest round of state budget
cuts have hit closer to home.
In a budget proposal an
nounced Jan. 10, Gov. Jerry
Brown slashed the state's
higher education funding by
$1.4 billion, $5OO million of
which will come from the
University of California (UC)
system.
The move will mark the
first time in the UC system's
143-year history that revenue
from student fees comprise a
higher proportion of the uni
versity operating budget than
funding from the state gov
ernment, according to UC
President Mark Yudof. The
$5OO million represents a
sixth of last year's state fund
ing to the UCs. In addition to
last year's 32 percent tuition
increase, UC students will
face an 8 percent hike for fall
2011, bringing annual in-state
tuition to $11,124.
While the UC system
copes with these changes,
Stanford is facing the idea
that the cuts will inevitably
change the numerous connec
tions it shares with Califor
nia's institutions of public
higher education.
"Our primary concern is
that the long-term impact of
ongoing budget cuts will
weaken the great public uni
versities in California, and
this will be bad for the state,
for the country and for higher
education in general," Stan

ford President John Hen
nessy wrote in an e-mail to
The Daily.
For research at Stanford,
the short-term concerns are
limited. The collaborative re
search done between Stan
ford and the UC system is
conducted in national labs
operated and funded by the
federal government, such as
SLAC National Accelerator
Laboratory and Lawrence
Berkeley National Laborato
ry.
"Fortunately, for the area
of research that Fm working
in, there's actually quite a bit
of funding going to the uni
versities now because the De
partment of Energy has been
really successful in persuad
ing Congress that we need to
put more research funds into
clean energy technology,"
said Sally Benson, professor
of energy resources engineer
ing.

"It's kind of balanced
things out," Benson contin
ued. "Actually, in a lot of ways
for graduate student research
in these areas, it's probably
better now than it's been in a
long time ... even though you
see us struggling financially, I
think that probably has a big
ger impact on the undergrad
uate program."
In fact, Stanford may even
see short-term benefits as
qualified Bay Area faculty
and students could become
wary of the potential decline
of the UC system and there
fore choose Stanford over
public institutions.
"The budget difficulties at
UC will probably decrease
the competition for faculty some
what, and so in the short run bene
fit Stanford and other top research
universities," Provost John
Etchemendy Ph.D. 'B2 wrote in an
e-mail to The Daily. "But it would
be very shortsighted to think that
that is a good thing. One of the
things that has made U.S. higher
education so strong is the constant
competition between universities
for the very best faculty and stu
dents."
Accordingly, the cuts could have
more serious long-term ramifica
tions on the future of higher educa
tion in the Bay Area. Some at Stan
ford have worried that cuts to the
UC system could affect the general
intellectual vitality of the area.
"The Bay Area is such a won
derful place, and one reason is of
course that two of the best institu
tions are here, Stanford and
Berkeley, and together they make
the Bay Area the best place to
study, and really the best place to
innovate and also the best place to
form industry," said Yi Cui, associ
ate professor of materials science
and engineering. "If the UCs are
really declining due to the budget
cuts, I think that will also reduce
the competitiveness of the Bay
Area, which will eventually also
affect Stanford University in a
negative way."
Bay Area universities, includ
ing Stanford and UC-Berkeley,
are prime feeders into California's
information-based economy,
home to such international play
ers as Google in Mountain View,
Apple in Cupertino and Facebook
in Palo Alto. California is home to

14 percent of companies on Stan
dard & Poor's 500 index.
Furthermore, UC-Berkeley
the top-ranked public university
in the United States is a princi
pal feeder into graduate programs
around the country. The UCs cur
rently guarantee admission to the
top 12.5 percent of the state's
graduating high school class. Flow
ever, budget cuts could jeopardize
the viability of this practice, there
by excluding extremely qualified
candidates from undergraduate
and possibly graduate education.
"The UC undergraduate pro
grams in the sciences are excel
lent, and so you see a lot of good
graduate students who come to
Stanford from Berkeley," Benson
said. "And so to the extent that
there are less students, or those
students don't have access to labs
or resources to do the laboratory
experiments, that's a bad thing."
"Tomorrow or next month or
next year it's not such a big issue,"
Benson added, "but we do want a
strong UC system as a feeder into
graduate schools."
The cuts may also impact the

Bay Area's ability to remain com
petitive on an increasingly global
research scene. As emerging na
tions such as China and India pour
funds into their science and tech
nology-based research and higher
education, budget cuts are driving
the United States in the opposite
direction.
"The United States is actually
in a critical time, facing interna
tional competition," Cui said.
"Our energy technology and even
our information technology, it's a
really critical time for our collabo
ration to move forward."
Moreover, the cuts' effects at
Stanford will reach well outside
the confines of academia. For ex
ample, UC-Berkeley eliminated
four varsity sports teams for the
2011-2012 season baseball,
men's and women's gymnastics
and women's lacrosse in an ef
fort to slash the intercollegiate
athletics budget from its current
annual $l2 million to $5 million by
2014. Those teams, comprised of
varsity-level athletes, could com
pete in club leagues, providing stiff
competition for Stanford and
other local schools.
However, there has been con
cern over the widely used term "de
cline of the UCs" to describe the ef
fects of the budget cuts. Some
worry that, despite the immediate
difficulties, the phrase embellishes
the actual consequences.
"The predicted decline of the
UCs is much overstated," Hen
nessy said. "Universities are re
silient institutions, and the UCs
have an extraordinary history of
quality faculty and students. They
have gone through difficult budg
et situations before and have not
lost their ability to compete."

fore choose Stanford over
public institutions.
"The budget difficulties at
UC will probably decrease
the competition for faculty some
what, and so in the short run bene
fit Stanford and other top research
universities," Provost John
Etchemendy Ph.D. 'B2 wrote in an
e-mail to The Daily. "But it would
be very shortsighted to think that
that is a good thing. One of the
things that has made U.S. higher
education so strong is the constant
competition between universities
for the very best faculty and stu
dents."
Accordingly, the cuts could have
more serious long-term ramifica
tions on the future of higher educa
tion in the Bay Area. Some at Stan
ford have worried that cuts to the
UC system could affect the general
intellectual vitality of the area.
"The Bay Area is such a won
derful place, and one reason is of
course that two of the best institu
tions are here, Stanford and
Berkeley, and together they make
the Bay Area the best place to
study, and really the best place to
innovate and also the best place to
form industry," said Yi Cui, associ
ate professor of materials science
and engineering. "If the UCs are
really declining due to the budget
cuts, I think that will also reduce
the competitiveness of the Bay
Area, which will eventually also
affect Stanford University in a
negative way."
Bay Area universities, includ
ing Stanford and UC-Berkeley,
are prime feeders into California's
information-based economy,
home to such international play
ers as Google in Mountain View,
Apple in Cupertino and Facebook
in Palo Alto. California is home to

14 percent of companies on Stan
dard & Poor's 500 index.
Furthermore, UC-Berkeley
the top-ranked public university
in the United States is a princi
pal feeder into graduate programs
around the country. The UCs cur
rently guarantee admission to the
top 12.5 percent of the state's
graduating high school class. Flow
ever, budget cuts could jeopardize
the viability of this practice, there
by excluding extremely qualified
candidates from undergraduate
and possibly graduate education.
"The UC undergraduate pro
grams in the sciences are excel
lent, and so you see a lot of good
graduate students who come to
Stanford from Berkeley," Benson
said. "And so to the extent that
there are less students, or those
students don't have access to labs
or resources to do the laboratory
experiments, that's a bad thing."
"Tomorrow or next month or
next year it's not such a big issue,"
Benson added, "but we do want a
strong UC system as a feeder into
graduate schools."
The cuts may also impact the

Bay Area's ability to remain com
petitive on an increasingly global
research scene. As emerging na
tions such as China and India pour
funds into their science and tech
nology-based research and higher
education, budget cuts are driving
the United States in the opposite
direction.
"The United States is actually
in a critical time, facing interna
tional competition," Cui said.
"Our energy technology and even
our information technology, it's a
really critical time for our collabo
ration to move forward."
Moreover, the cuts' effects at
Stanford will reach well outside
the confines of academia. For ex
ample, UC-Berkeley eliminated
four varsity sports teams for the
2011-2012 season baseball,
men's and women's gymnastics
and women's lacrosse in an ef
fort to slash the intercollegiate
athletics budget from its current
annual $l2 million to $5 million by
2014. Those teams, comprised of
varsity-level athletes, could com
pete in club leagues, providing stiff
competition for Stanford and
other local schools.
However, there has been con
cern over the widely used term "de
cline of the UCs" to describe the ef
fects of the budget cuts. Some
worry that, despite the immediate
difficulties, the phrase embellishes
the actual consequences.
"The predicted decline of the
UCs is much overstated," Hen
nessy said. "Universities are re
silient institutions, and the UCs
have an extraordinary history of
quality faculty and students. They
have gone through difficult budg
et situations before and have not
lost their ability to compete."

Though the budget woes
of the state of California seem
remote underneath the um
brella of Stanford's multibil
lion-dollar endowment, the
latest round of state budget
cuts have hit closer to home.
In a budget proposal an
nounced Jan. 10, Gov. Jerry
Brown slashed the state's
higher education funding by
$1.4 billion, $5OO million of
which will come from the
University of California (UC)
system.
The move will mark the
first time in the UC system's
143-year history that revenue
from student fees comprise a
higher proportion of the uni
versity operating budget than
funding from the state gov
ernment, according to UC
President Mark Yudof. The
$5OO million represents a
sixth of last year's state fund
ing to the UCs. In addition to
last year's 32 percent tuition
increase, UC students will
face an 8 percent hike for fall
2011, bringing annual in-state
tuition to $11,124.
While the UC system
copes with these changes,
Stanford is facing the idea
that the cuts will inevitably
change the numerous connec
tions it shares with Califor
nia's institutions of public
higher education.
"Our primary concern is
that the long-term impact of
ongoing budget cuts will
weaken the great public uni
versities in California, and
this will be bad for the state,
for the country and for higher
education in general," Stan

ford President John Hen
nessy wrote in an e-mail to
The Daily.
For research at Stanford,
the short-term concerns are
limited. The collaborative re
search done between Stan
ford and the UC system is
conducted in national labs
operated and funded by the
federal government, such as
SLAC National Accelerator
Laboratory and Lawrence
Berkeley National Laborato
ry.
"Fortunately, for the area
of research that Fm working
in, there's actually quite a bit
of funding going to the uni
versities now because the De
partment of Energy has been
really successful in persuad
ing Congress that we need to
put more research funds into
clean energy technology,"
said Sally Benson, professor
of energy resources engineer
ing.

"It's kind of balanced
things out," Benson contin
ued. "Actually, in a lot of ways
for graduate student research
in these areas, it's probably
better now than it's been in a
long time ... even though you
see us struggling financially, I
think that probably has a big
ger impact on the undergrad
uate program."
In fact, Stanford may even
see short-term benefits as
qualified Bay Area faculty
and students could become
wary of the potential decline
of the UC system and there
fore choose Stanford over
public institutions.
"The budget difficulties at
UC will probably decrease
