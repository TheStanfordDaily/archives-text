# STANFORD FACES EFFECTS OF UC CUTS
## Governor proposes millions in cuts for state universities 
### ELLORA ISRANI STAFF WRITER 
Though the budget woes
of the state of California seem
remote underneath the um
brella of Stanford's multibil
lion-dollar endowment, the
latest round of state budget
cuts have hit closer to home.
In a budget proposal an
nounced Jan. 10, Gov. Jerry
Brown slashed the state's
higher education funding by
$1.4 billion, $5OO million of
which will come from the
University of California (UC)
system.
The move will mark the
first time in the UC system's
143-year history that revenue
from student fees comprise a
higher proportion of the uni
versity operating budget than
funding from the state gov
ernment, according to UC
President Mark Yudof. The
$5OO million represents a
sixth of last year's state fund
ing to the UCs. In addition to
last year's 32 percent tuition
increase, UC students will
face an 8 percent hike for fall
2011, bringing annual in-state
tuition to $11,124.
While the UC system
copes with these changes,
Stanford is facing the idea
that the cuts will inevitably
change the numerous connec
tions it shares with Califor
nia's institutions of public
higher education.
"Our primary concern is
that the long-term impact of
ongoing budget cuts will
weaken the great public uni
versities in California, and
this will be bad for the state,
for the country and for higher
education in general," Stan

ford President John Hen
nessy wrote in an e-mail to
The Daily.
For research at Stanford,
the short-term concerns are
limited. The collaborative re
search done between Stan
ford and the UC system is
conducted in national labs
operated and funded by the
federal government, such as
SLAC National Accelerator
Laboratory and Lawrence
Berkeley National Laborato
ry.
"Fortunately, for the area
of research that Fm working
in, there's actually quite a bit
of funding going to the uni
versities now because the De
partment of Energy has been
really successful in persuad
ing Congress that we need to
put more research funds into
clean energy technology,"
said Sally Benson, professor
of energy resources engineer
ing.

"It's kind of balanced
things out," Benson contin
ued. "Actually, in a lot of ways
for graduate student research
in these areas, it's probably
better now than it's been in a
long time ... even though you
see us struggling financially, I
think that probably has a big
ger impact on the undergrad
uate program."
In fact, Stanford may even
see short-term benefits as
qualified Bay Area faculty
and students could become
wary of the potential decline
of the UC system and there
fore choose Stanford over
public institutions.
"The budget difficulties at
UC will probably decrease
