## Special fees bill reversal passed Senate confirms nominees, hears exec, disabilities updates 
### MARGARET RAWSON DESK EDITOR 
The 12th ASSU Undergraduate Senate passed
three bills Tuesday evening, approving the reversal of a
special fees rule enacted last year and confirming five
nominees to the Constitutional Council and judicial
panel pool.
Tuesday's special fees bill would allow student
groups that have previously received special fees to
grow their budgets by 10 percent without petitioning to
be on the special fees ballot, reverting the ASSU joint
bylaws to their pre-January 2010 language. Last year's
bill required student groups to petition to increase their
budgets by more than the inflation rate approxi
mately 3 percent. Yesterday's bill requires the approval
of the Graduate Student Council, ASSU's other legisla
tive body.
After several senators expressed concerns over a
lack of spending regulations, the special fees bill was al
tered after last week's meeting to include a clause say
ing the Senate would work with other ASSU bodies to
format regulations within the coming week.
At the beginning of Tuesday's meeting, Lina Hidal
go 'l3 discussed the progress of the ASSU Leadership
Development program, which she co-coordinates, with
the senators and Senate associates in attendance. Sen
ate associates are just beginning rotations to attend
Senate committee meetings.
Vivian Wong 'l2, ASSU chair of disabilities and ac
cessible education, discussed the results of a campus
wide survey and the launch of a mentoring program,
open to all students, to promote a di
alogue about life on campus for stu
dents with disabilities. (Wong is the
managing editor of photos for The
Daily.)
Among nominees, the Senate
approved Brianna Pang 'l3 to serve
on the Constitutional Council.
(Pang is a Daily writer.) The Senate
also confirmed four nominees for
the judicial panel pool: Sjoerd de
Ridder, a graduate student in geo
physics, and juniors Reagan Thomp
son, Tara Guarino and Elizabeth
Rasmussen.
ASSU President Angelina Car
dona 'll praised Wong's work in her
update to the senators. She also dis
cussed the recent ROTC town hall
and ASSU wellness chair Taylor

Winfield's proposal for a wellness
center on the first floor of Stanford
Dining's newest dining hall, to open
this coming fall. Cardona also men
tioned plans for a more structured
VCI action grants program, which
she hopes will offer resources to stu
dents without traditional sources of
funding capital for their ideas on
wellness, sustainability, domestic vi
olence awareness and other topics.
On previous notice for next
week are two bills by Senator Will
Seaton 'l3 to alter the method of
recording senator student-group
membership and to include tech
nology in the title and mission of the
Senate's Communication Commit
tee, which he currently chairs.
All funding bills for the evening
were passed, including a budget
modification for Stanford Out
doors.
