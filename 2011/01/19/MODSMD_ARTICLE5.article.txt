## Special fees bill reversal passed Senate confirms nominees, hears exec, disabilities updates 
### MARGARET RAWSON DESK EDITOR 
The 12th ASSU Undergraduate Senate passed
three bills Tuesday evening, approving the reversal of a
special fees rule enacted last year and confirming five
nominees to the Constitutional Council and judicial
panel pool.
Tuesday's special fees bill would allow student
groups that have previously received special fees to
grow their budgets by 10 percent without petitioning to
be on the special fees ballot, reverting the ASSU joint
bylaws to their pre-January 2010 language. Last year's
bill required student groups to petition to increase their
budgets by more than the inflation rate approxi
mately 3 percent. Yesterday's bill requires the approval
of the Graduate Student Council, ASSU's other legisla
tive body.
After several senators expressed concerns over a
lack of spending regulations, the special fees bill was al
tered after last week's meeting to include a clause say
ing the Senate would work with other ASSU bodies to
format regulations within the coming week.
At the beginning of Tuesday's meeting, Lina Hidal

Development program, which she co-coordinates, with
