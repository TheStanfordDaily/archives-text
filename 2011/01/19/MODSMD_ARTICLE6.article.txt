## New first-gen dean hired Woon to create programs to promote diversity, support first-generation students 
### IVY NGUYEN DESK EDITOR 
Tommy Lee Woon, dean of multicultur
al life at Macalester College, was recently
appointed to fill the new position of direc
tor of diversity and first-generation pro
grams at Stanford. It is a return to Stanford:
he worked here from 1993 to 2002 as assis

tant dean of students and multicultural ed
ucator. He has worked at several other
higher-education institutions.
Woon corresponded with The Daily via
e-mail on Tuesday to discuss his upcoming
job. An edited excerpt is below.
Stanford Daily (SD): What are the
biggest issues that first generation students
at Stanford face, and how will you work to
address that?
Tommy Woon (TW): Commonly, the
biggest issues include overcoming isola
tion, learning to develop the resiliency to
thrive and coping with financial stress. We
know from studies that people can flourish
under the most adverse circumstances
when they are resilient. I will work to em
power students, reduce their isolation and
build their emotional literacy and life skills
so that they can thrive even if institutional
and cultural barriers are less than ideal. On
the other hand, I will also raise awareness
of structural, cultural and financial condi
tions that impinge on students so we don't
place an unfair burden on them or blame
the victims when they are overwhelmed.
SD: Diversity and support for first-gen
eration students seem like very different
categories. Why were these two grouped
together, and how will your office divide its
work between them?
TW: To answer the why question first:
Since I didn't create this position, I can only
assume Stanford wanted to make support
for first-generation college students con
cerns more explicit... in this regard, it's
another step towards acknowledging that
diversity is complicated. Diversity is not
merely distinct categories of people and
histories interacting with each other, but
people with unique and fluid multiple iden

tities that are intersecting and ebbing and
flowing within and with others.
I am not expecting to divide work but to
blend work with first generation and diver
sity. Conceptually, I want to put first-gener
ation college students in the center of an in
tersection. If the intersection is a rotary
with different pathways in and out, we can
promote a holistic approach for ensuring
the needs of first-generation students are
addressed while attending to all of the di
versity in a community.
SD: How will you involve students in
the creation and implementation of any
programs or projects you will begin?
TW: I want to institutionalize student
participation and leadership so the pro
grams that my office creates reflect stu
dents' sensibilities and creativity. I look for
ward to creating some structures and re
cruiting talented students to be my part
ners. I hope to hire some students, create an
advisory group with substantial student
representation and use social media to
communicate with stakeholders.
SD: What will be the first item on your
agenda when you come to Stanford next
year?
TW: Meet, greet and listen to students,
particularly first generation students. Make
visible my commitment, approachability
and accessibility to them. And make visible
my leadership in coalescing other re
sources to support them.
SD: What are some long term projects
you have in mind, and how will those be im
plemented?
TW: A long term project is to create an

ecosystem at Stanford that offers
sustained, visible support for first
generation students. This will re
quire taking inventory of existing
support and highlighting, expanding
and coalescing, and publicizing
them. I will need to work with stu

dents, staff, faculty and alumni to do
this.
I'd like to use a process called
Appreciative Inquiry to generate
ideas and action plans. It's a process
that invites people to do strength
analysis, to gather and connect ideas
from successful personal experi
ences to co-create a blue print for
change.
