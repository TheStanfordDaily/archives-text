## Ed Macaulay, Voice of Stanford Stadium', dies at 91 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Ivy Nguyen 
Ed Macaulay, a longtime public
address announcer for Stanford ath
letics, died Friday at his home in San
Mateo following a stroke at the age
of 91.
Macaulay's career spanned from
1952 to 1990, when Stanford admin
istrators replaced him before the
1991 season. After fans protested the
decision with a letter-writing cam
paign asking to have him reinstated,
he returned for one final season in
1992. In his 40 seasons at the job,
Macaulay missed only one game
during a bout with laryngitis.
From his perch in the press box,
Macaulay presided over Stanford's

change in mascot from the Indians to
the Cardinal. Highlights from his ca
reer include announcing the Cardi
nal's upset against No. 1-ranked
Washington in 1942 as well as years
of alternately winning and losing the
Axe at the annual Big Game.
In addition to announcing foot
ball games, Macaulay was also a
presence at several historic sporting
events at Stanford, including the U.S.
Olympic Track and Field trials in
1960 and the U.S.-vs.-U.S.S.R. track
meet in 1963, at the height of Cold
War tensions between the two coun
tries.
Following his retirement,
Macaulay worked to establish the
Stanford University Athletics Hall
of Fame, where he regularly served
as docent.
A memorial service is planned
for March 27 at Valley Presbyterian
Church.
