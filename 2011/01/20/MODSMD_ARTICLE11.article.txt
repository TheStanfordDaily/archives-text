## Getting cheeky Today in White Plaza, a bone marrow registration drive hopes to save lives 
### KELSEY GEISER 
If you could take 15 minutes out of your day to help save a life,
would you do it? Efforts are underway on campus to use so
cial media to make that answer a "yes" and provide hope for
the 3,000 U.S. patients who every day are in need of life-saving
bone marrow transplants.
The National Marrow Donor Program, through its "Be The
Match" registry, has assembled more than 9 million possible donors,
resulting in more than 43,000 transplants since its creation
in 1987. Although there is no guarantee of survival if a pa
tient finds a match, it is the first and often the only step to
ward a chance at life.
According to the New York Blood Center, while about 80
percent of Caucasians who require transplants are able to
find a match in the donor registry, the chances for minorities
are far slimmer.The 100K Cheeks website reports that a per
son of South Asian descent in need of a transplant has a 1-
in-20,000 chance of finding a match.
Now, Stanford's own 100K Cheeks campaign hopes to im
prove those odds and hopefully ease the pain for thousands of
families by using social media to increase the number of bone
marrow registries, with an emphasis on those of South Asian de
scent.
The campaign recently joined forces with the CureSonia cam
paign for its first bone marrow registry drive, which is set to take
place on Jan. 20 in White Plaza and the Graduate Community Cen
ter Havana Room.
The CureSonia campaign shares the goal of 100K Cheeks, but
with more urgency and focus on donors of South Asian and Asian
decent. It is looking for a transplant match for Sonia
Rai, who has been diagnosed with acute myeloge
nous leukemia (AML), a cancer of the blood.
Kamini Rai Cormier, Soma's first cousin
and an active participant in the CureSonia
campaign, said she has found that for success
ful drives, "the more volunteers, the more
people we are able to register." The CureSo
nia campaign has 50 bone marrow drives
planned in the next two weeks alone.
By combining the resources of the Haas
Center and the National Marrow Donor Pro
gram with the outreach efforts of 100K Cheeks
and CureSonia, the groups hope to achieve a large
increase in the registry.
100K Cheeks, which was launched in November
2010, has the goal of registering 100,000 people, at least
80 percent of whom are of South Asian decent, within a
year. Joining the registry requires one to fill out paper
work and provide a cheek swab. The option of ordering an
at-home bone marrow donor registration kit further eases
the process.
As Vineet Singal 'l2, co-executive director of the cam
paign, noted, "The only obstacle is that enough people are
not registered. It seems like something that is very solv
able."
The idea behind the 100K Cheeks campaign came from
business professor Jennifer Aaker. Her two former stu
dents and friends, Sameer Bhatia and Vinay
Chakravarthy, were diagnosed with leukemia and decid
ed to take action and actively seek potential bone
marrow donors.
V

Their
friends
began a
campaign to
add 25,000
people to the
registry. Once
they reached this
goal, however,
the first words out
of their mouths
were, "Let's double
that,"Aaker said.
Despite finding
matches, both Bhatia and
Chakravarthy passed away. In
their honor, Aaker had the idea to not
only fulfill their wishes, but also exceed
them by striving for 100,000 registries.
"What we wanted to do was double
the 25,000 and then double it again, in honor
of both of them," she said.
Bhatia and Chakravarthy's struggles
inspired Aaker to write a book, called "The
Dragonfly Effect," with her husband Andy
Smith, an tech marketer. The book addresses
how individuals or groups can effectively use
social media for a greater cause.
It focuses on the four "wings" of iden
tifying and attaining focus, grabbing atten
tion, engaging an audience through story
telling and enabling others to take action.
Aaker outlined a strategy for the
100K Cheeks campaign around this model
and joined with Thomas Schnaubelt, the ex
ecutive director of the Haas Center for Pub
lic Service. Their intent was to find eager
students and begin to make an impact
through the Commonwealth Challenge, a
new initiative through the Haas Center
that works with faculty to identify one spe
cific goal and recruits ambitious students.
Schnaubelt described the Common-
Wealth Challenge as a project "to see how these
students would self-organize and network given
the goal." Aaker and Schnaubelt both agreed
that 100K Cheeks campaign would be an ideal
vehicle for the challenge and eventually assem
bled a team of eight undergraduate students and
two graduate students.
Although Schnaubelt and Aaker have acted as
advisers and periodically help the students, they see
the campaign as a student-driven endeavor.
Donovan Barfield 'l2, co-executive director of the
campaign, believes that personal storytelling is effective
in recruiting the target audience because "it makes it all
the more rewarding to know that when you donate, you
are actually saving a life as opposed to contributing and
being a statistic within the donor bank."
The campaign has YouTube,Twitter and Facebook ac
counts, a website and an e-mail campaign to nearly every
dorm and group on campus. The campaign has also
begun a friendly inter-collegiate competition, mainly
with USC, to see which campus can get more registries.
Cormier believes that "the biggest thing that prevents
people [from registering] is fear." With more educa
tion on the process, the campaign has the potential to
make more people feel comfortable and eventually
achieve more registries.
The 100K Cheeks campaign does not plan to
stop at 100,000 registries it hopes to achieve more
than a million and eventually bring a convenient
bone marrow registry to India, where the
registry is costly to join.
For now, however, the campaign's
main focus is achieving its 100,000 cheek
swabs. As Barfield said, "If we save one
life, we could save a thousand lives."
