## THE 						CAMPUS BEAT Mental Music

First point: trees fall in forests.
Sometimes people hear them.
Stop, for a few seconds, and
imagine the sound of a tree falling
in a forest... The loud cracking of
branches, the cacophonous rustling
of the leaves against the other
plants. Some kind of "thud." No tree
just fell, but did you hear a sound in
your head?
Second point: in a previous col
umn, I encouraged people to play
music at random times and in ran
dom places because it's always
pleasing to run into live music unex
pectedly.
Third point: modern composi
tion often involves strange musical
instruments, and even stranger no
tation. Regular sheet music isn't al
ways necessary.
Based on these three points, I'm
going to turn this column into
music. Right here, right now.
Don't worry; I'm not going to
ask you to perform anything out
loud. Though if you are inspired to
sing a song all of a sudden, then by
all means feel free. But in the same
way that Beethoven heard his
compositions in his head after he
lost his hearing, this piece of music
will take place entirely in your
head.
This is how it's going to work. A
newspaper will be the imaginary in
strument. It will be used to produce
four distinct, imagined sounds. One
is the sound of ripping the paper in
half. The second is crumpling it up
into a ball. The third is shaking it
like a sheet, and the fourth is no
sound at all - a stationary newspa
per. So instead of little filled-in
notes, I will write, "rip" "crumple"
"shake" and "none."
To denote time, or rhythm, I will
demarcate each quarter-note beat
with a period. When there are two
hyphenated words before a period,
they will be eighth notes, like this:
"Rip-Rip." I'll write four beats to a
line, like a regular 4/4 measure. The
tempo and the dynamics (loudness),
I leave up to your interpretation.

You'll notice that when you first
play through the piece, you might
hear the sound of the word in addi
tion to the sound it represents. Try
to remove the sound of the word,
and just hear the sound, but keep
reading along with the music.
Here goes:

Rip. Rip. Rip. Rip.
Rip. Rip. Rip. Rip.
Rip. Crumple. Rip. Rip.
Rip-Rip. Crumple. Rip. Rip.
Rip. Shake. Rip-Rip. Rip.
Rip. Shake. Rip-Rip. None.
Rip. Shake. Rip-Rip. Rip.
Rip. Shake. None. Crumple.
Shake-Shake. Crumple. Rip-Rip. Rip.
Shake-Shake. Crumple. Rip-Rip. Rip.
Rip-Shake. Crumple-Rip. None. Rip.
Rip. None. None. Crumple.
(End)
It's pretty short. Not too compli
cated. Clearly not something you'll
"listen to" over and over again,
since it lacks the usual fun parts like
melody and harmony.
But how did it go? Did you find
yourself miming along with the
verbs? Was it difficult to "hear"? Try
accenting some beats, or see what
it's like to increase the volume in
your own head. You could also per
form it in real life with a couple peo
ple and some newspaper to see
what it "really sounds like," but I
think that's against the spirit of the
piece.
Because even though it's all in
your head, that doesn't mean it's
not real.
