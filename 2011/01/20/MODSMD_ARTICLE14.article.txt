I I hear those five words ut-
Atered all the time by my
friends. Usually, they're in some dis
dainful tone. It's like using Twitter is
some sort of über-hipster thing to
do. I'd like to think that Stanford is
the world's most technologically
keyed-in campus, so I often can't
believe that people think using
Twitter has some social stigma at
tached. Look, if it's good enough to
be a source of breaking world news
and facilitate political revolutions
in Iran, Moldova and Tunisia, I
think it's good enough for all of us,
okay?
That's not to say Twitter doesn't
have its share of inanity. I'll admit,
among others, I follow Taylor Swift,
Katy Perry, The Stanford Daily and
Kesha. Can you really blame me,
though? I guarantee you that
Kesha's tweets about not knowing
her dad's identity or her sexual es
capades are infinitely more enter

taining than anything that could
possibly pop up on my Facebook
news feed. (The lone exception:
photos of babies of my high school
classmates that always serves to
help me feel better.) In fact, it's the
inanity that keeps me coming back
to Twitter. I can read party tips
straight from the "King of Partying"
himself, Andrew W.K. Verbatim ex
ample: "PARTY TIP: Blacking out
is a great way to relax." Most of the
Row is probably nodding in agree
ment after this three-day weekend.
Honestly though, you haven't
experienced Twitter until you stum
ble across the feed of one Mr.
Kanye West. I could write an entire
column about his tweets alone. Take
this tweet from July 29th: "I specifi
cally ordered Persian rugs with
cherub imagery!!! What do I have
to do to get a simple Persian rug
with cherub imagery uuuuugh." Or
this one from August 28th: "Do you
know where to find marble confer

ence tables? I'm looking to have a
conference ... not until I get the
table though."This is the part where
I'm supposed to include a joke or
some witty retort, but I think Kanye
has me beat on this one. I mean,
what am I supposed to say? This guy
is vainer than most Thetas and
that's saying something.
Twitter is also a place that's al
lowed me to talk to some (relative
ly) famous people. Does Facebook
let you do that? My favorite celebri
ty Twitter conversation thus far was
one I had with Christopher Chu,
lead singer of The Morning Ben
ders, an awesome indie band. We
discussed the notion of arranged
marriage in Taylor Swift's "Love
Story" and how it made the song
seem pretty sad in the end. I'm still
not sure if that conversation was se
rious or sarcastic, but you can't
make this stuff up.
However, my best celebrity Twit
ter coup will forever go down in the

annals of history. This summer, I
wanted to see Keane live, but tickets
for their concert were something
like $6O each. Being a poor college
student, that wasn't working for me.
So I tweeted Richard Hughes, the
drummer of Keane. He promptly
replied back to tell me that he had
two tickets reserved for me on
Keane's guest list for their show in
Philadelphia. It's been six months
and I still can't believe that actually
happened. Do you want to continue
to tell me that Twitter is stupid? I
didn't think so.
Trust me, it is Twitter's absolute
inanity that will keep you coming
back. Sure, Twitter is definitely your
best place for up-to-the-minute
news. How did I follow every single
twist of the Jim Harbaugh saga on a
second-by-second basis? Twitter.
But after a while, you can get that
news anywhere. More than any
thing, Twitter is a place that allows
you to get unfiltered access to peo

pie who fascinate you. It's pure fri
volity in its concept, but pure genius
in its execution.
A sample tweet to illustrate that
last point: "i love my ipod touch, but
BGB really just doesnt allow me the
musical diversity i desire some
times. #firstworldproblems"
Okay, that one was from me.
