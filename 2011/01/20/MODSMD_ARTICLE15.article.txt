## Spain, Country of Contradictions 
### Max Markham '12 
After arriving in Madrid with
only 1.5 hours of uncomfort
able airplane sleep, navigat
ing through Barajas airport, with
drawing, ever so painfully, 80 Euros
to hopefully last me more than one
day, and getting a cab into town, I
arrived with a friend at the Francis
co I Hotel where orientation was
scheduled to begin. I had already
been jaded by Europe after spend
ing fall quarter in the expensive and
inefficient city some like to call
Paris. Like a true snob, I was less
than excited to be back in Europe
for another quarter.
The famous blue Madrid sky was
covered by grey overbearing
clouds, seemingly ready to spray
down at any hint of irritation. The
hotel, under construction, was lo
cated in the heart of the old city cen
tre on Calle Arenal, just off Calle
Mayor, one of the biggest, most cen
tral streets in Madrid. After some
awkward introductions with people
from the program, a margherita
pizza and a Fanta naranja, orienta

tion began. We were promptly told
our living situations and that the
next day at 9 a.m. we'd be shipping
off to the province of Andalucia
until Tuesday night, with stops in
Granada, Nerja, Cordoba and Tole
do.
The Spanish-only pledge was in
full effect the next day, and we were
packed onto a surprisingly comfort
able bus for the six-hour trip to
Granada, stopping at an even
more- surprisingly nice service sta
tion for lunch. Soon after our depar
ture from the service station, I
began to notice a change in archi
tecture. The houses and rest stops
on the side of the road began to
seem less Roman and Western-in
fluenced and more Middle Eastern.
Restaurants began to have bilingual
Spanish/Arabic signs, and the ter
rain changed to resemble more of a
desert. We were approaching.
We arrived at the Alhambra in
Granada around mid-afternoon
and proceeded on our tour with one
of the staff, who was unbelievably

knowledgeable and gave us an
amazing historical account of the
significance of everything, some of
which was sacrificed in order to
take an inordinate amount of pic
tures to inevitably end up on Face
book. Before we had time to even
process what we were seeing (or
look at our newly taken pictures),
we were on top of a tower with a
360-degree view of Granada, the
Alhambra, the snow-covered Sierra
Nevada mountains and the distant
Mediterranean, with Spanish, Por
tuguese and EU flags flying proud
ly in the wind atop the tower. In
credible. It was literally like being in
three different countries at once.
One part Spain, one part ancient
Rome, one part Middle East. This
was a recurring theme for the rest of
the orientation trip along with
the "tiny" feeling that accompanies
visiting any kind of site with struc
tures and history older than can ac
curately be measured.
That night we arrived in Nerja, a
town I had never heard of before,

but which would quickly become
one of my favorite places I've ever
visited. Our hotel was located on
top of a cliff overlooking the
Mediterranean Sea with our own
private inlet beach below us (in fact,
if you Wikipedia the town of Nerja,
the photo of the beach is taken from
the cliff beside our hotel). The next
day, sunny and warm, was spent
lounging and tanning, wasting away
our parents' tuition money on a
Mediterranean beach in the middle
of January. I don't think anyone
would have protested if we had
spent the rest of orientation there,
but alas we had more to learn about
Spain, and more places to visit.
The next day we headed to Cor
doba, once home of both Roman
and Islamic empires. We visited one
of the most immensely beautiful
buildings the Great Mosque of
Cordoba built originally as a
mosque, converted into a cathedral
by the Roman Empire and located
in the Jewish quarter. It had been
mentioned offhand by one of the

program coordinators when we ar
rived that Spain was a country full
of contradictions, but it wasn't ap
parent to me how beautifully true
the sentiment was until we reached
Cordoba. The belittling and ageless
beauty of Cordoba was enough to
silence even the rowdiest of frat
boys during our tour of the Great
Mosque.
As if we hadn't seen enough
mindboggling architecture over the
past three days, we managed to
squeeze in a day-trip to Toledo, also
a mixed hub of Muslim, Christian
and Jewish culture. We skipped
from a cathedral over to a mosque
cathedral hybrid to a synagogue
cathedral hybrid before arriving
back on the bus, exhausted. Back to
the airport to fly back to Stanford,
right? Nope. Back to Madrid for 10
more weeks. It was inconceivable to
think that we had only just begun
our adventures in Spain.
