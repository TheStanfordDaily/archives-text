## TROY AWAITS Cardinal looks to right the ship in Los Angeles 
### ZACH ZIMMERMAN DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford men's basketball team begins
one of its toughest road trips of the season
tonight when it heads to Los Angeles to take on
use.
The Cardinal (10-6,3-2 Pac-10) is looking to
continue a surprisingly strong start to its season.
The team, which now sits in fourth place in the
conference standings, is fresh off a weekend
split at home, in which it narrowly defeated
then-No. 17 Washington and lost to Washington
State.
In the defeat, Stanford head coach Johnny
Dawkins had no excuse for his team's first home
loss for the year.
"They were long and tough to defend," he
said of the Cougars. "We got beat."
Dawkins and his young squad must regroup
immediately and will undoubtedly rely on vet
eran leadership to overcome early troubles on
the road.
One of those upperclassmen, redshirt junior
Josh Owens, has come on strong of late and has
brought his per-game season averages up to 12.1
points and 6.5 rebounds. Owens, who missed all
of the 2009-10 campaign due to an undisclosed
injury, should come out with a vengeance in
SoCal after missing a game-tying free throw in
the closing seconds of Stanford's matchup with

Wazzu.
"Josh is improving and he has been working
very hard," Dawkins said. "I think he's starting
to get his timing back. He's rounding into bas
ketball shape and we're excited.
"We're happy he has the opportunity to
come back and do something he loves," he
added.
Junior guard Jeremy Green has emerged as

the go-to guy for the Cardinal, but has seen his
scoring average drop to 15.5 points per game
due to a cold shooting streak and heightened
defensive pressure.
The Trojans (10-8, 2-3) have had their way
with Green in their four meetings, holding him to
just seven points per game. Starting junior guard

Redshirt junior forward Josh Owens, above, will be called upon for his veteran leadership tonight
when Stanford travels south to battle USC. The Cardinal has struggled on the road this season and
faces one of its biggest challenges thus far against an unpredictable and dynamic Trojans squad.
