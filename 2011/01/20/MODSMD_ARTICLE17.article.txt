## TROY AWAITS Cardinal looks to right the ship in Los Angeles 
### ZACH ZIMMERMAN DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford men's basketball team begins
one of its toughest road trips of the season
tonight when it heads to Los Angeles to take on
use.
The Cardinal (10-6,3-2 Pac-10) is looking to
continue a surprisingly strong start to its season.
The team, which now sits in fourth place in the
conference standings, is fresh off a weekend
split at home, in which it narrowly defeated
then-No. 17 Washington and lost to Washington
State.
In the defeat, Stanford head coach Johnny
Dawkins had no excuse for his team's first home
loss for the year.
"They were long and tough to defend," he
said of the Cougars. "We got beat."
Dawkins and his young squad must regroup
immediately and will undoubtedly rely on vet
eran leadership to overcome early troubles on
the road.
One of those upperclassmen, redshirt junior
Josh Owens, has come on strong of late and has
brought his per-game season averages up to 12.1
points and 6.5 rebounds. Owens, who missed all
of the 2009-10 campaign due to an undisclosed
injury, should come out with a vengeance in
SoCal after missing a game-tying free throw in
the closing seconds of Stanford's matchup with

Wazzu.
"Josh is improving and he has been working
very hard," Dawkins said. "I think he's starting
to get his timing back. He's rounding into bas
ketball shape and we're excited.
"We're happy he has the opportunity to
come back and do something he loves," he
added.
Junior guard Jeremy Green has emerged as

the go-to guy for the Cardinal, but has seen his
scoring average drop to 15.5 points per game
due to a cold shooting streak and heightened
defensive pressure.
The Trojans (10-8, 2-3) have had their way
with Green in their four meetings, holding him to
just seven points per game. Starting junior guard

Redshirt junior forward Josh Owens, above, will be called upon for his veteran leadership tonight
when Stanford travels south to battle USC. The Cardinal has struggled on the road this season and
faces one of its biggest challenges thus far against an unpredictable and dynamic Trojans squad.
Jarrett Mann has also struggled of
fensively against the team, failing to
record a field goal in just 10 shot at
tempts against USC.
That said, this Trojans team re
mains an enigma. Despite eight
losses and a sub-.500 conference
record, the squad has recorded
marquee wins against Texas and
Tennessee, two clubs almost as
sured a spot in the NCAA Tourna
ment come March. USC's strength
lies in its defense, which gives up
just 63.3 points per game on 40.9-
percent shooting.
However, Stanford is even more
dominant on the defensive end, tied
at No. 19 in the nation in scoring de
fense. The team is holding oppo
nents to 59.8 points per game
through 16 appearances.
The Cardinal's defensive front
court will have its hands full tonight
against USC 6-foot-10 junior for
ward Nikola Vucevic. Vucevic has
been a double-double machine this
season, posting averages of 16.4
points and 10.1 rebounds per game.
His presence on the boards could
prove costly for an undersized
Stanford squad that has been rid
dled by rebounding difficulties.
The Cardinal and Trojans have

one of the closest historical records
in the nation, with USC posting a
119-118 advantage in the teams'
237 meetings. The squads are 5-5 in
their last 10 matchups with the Tro
jans notching a five-point victory
the last time the two met in L.A.
Stanford will look to even up the
series tonight when it visits the
Galen Center. Tipoff is set for 7:30
p.m.
