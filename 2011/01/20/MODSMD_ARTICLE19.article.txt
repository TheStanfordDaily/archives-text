# Sports fans, don't pass judgment

At any given time,
there are far too
many sports going on
in the world, or even
just on campus, to
keep track of. I mean, right now
we've got NFL playoffs, Australian
Open, NBA, NFIL and college bas
ketball, all in full swing in the nation
al media. That's not even counting
the endless offseason chatter about
other sports, and of course all the
sports that don't reach the same
level of fame on American sports
networks.

So with all these different sports
vying for your attention, along with
all the Stanford teams competing in
the winter, what should you focus
on? So often this question is an
swered with the author's preference
for what you should be watching.
But the answer is far more obvious.
Whatever the hell you want.
You're the one watching, so
watch what you like, I mean, sure, I
can point out games that have par
ticularly interesting backstories or
are particularly meaningful for the
teams involved. But at the end of the
day, you're the one that's going to be
experiencing it, so do what you
want. It's the same reason I have
soundtracks to Wicked and Flair
spray on my iPod and more albums
by John Williams than by anyone
else. It's my music, and I'm going to
listen to what I want.
Why can't it be the same way for
sports? I'm all about watching foot
ball and will probably be that way
for the rest of my life. I encourage
every Stanford student to go to the
football games for the entire experi
ence of the Red Zone. But I know
plenty of people who just can't get
into football, and at some point we
all just have to respect that.
For some people it's football, but
for others it's baseball or water polo
or cricket or sailing or any number
of things. Just because some are
more popular does not mean they
are more valid. People have thou
sands of reasons to prefer the sports
they do. Maybe you grew up doing
gymnastics. Maybe your best friend
runs track. Maybe that cute girl from
your psych section is on the squash
team and you want her to notice you
cheering her on. Who's to say what a
"legitimate" reason is for watching a
sport?
I'm the kind of person that will
turn on the vast majority of sports
and just watch to enjoy the game it
self. It can be bowling or Aussie rules
football or golf or the NBA Finals.
To me, most sports are fun to watch
just because of what they are. But
most people aren't like me. Most
people do other things with their
lives than watch first-round cover
age of the Australian Open and
SWAC college basketball. If it gets
people involved in sports and
watching them, I'm all for it. Even if
you're really just there because you
like Tom Brady's haircut (there's
probably someone in the world that
does) or because your friend went to
the same high school as Andy Rod
dick and can dish the dirt on how
he's always been a douche bag.
Sometimes, personal connec
tions can make watching sports that
much more special. Any proud par

I know plenty of
people who
can't get into
football, and at
some point we
all just have to
respect that.
