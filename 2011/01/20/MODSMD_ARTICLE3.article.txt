## Custodians' arbitration underway Move to new contractor triggers process 
### ELLEN HUET MANAGING EDITOR 
Stanford's transition to a new con
tractor for campus custodial services on
Dec. 1 created complications for a small
number of custodial employees, who are
now scheduled to enter an arbitration
process through the employees' union
and the new subcontractor, UGL
(UNICCO).

News of the change in contractors
sparked e-mail petitions throughout the
school and a lunchtime protest claiming
that employees of the previous contrac
tor, ABM, would not be guaranteed job
security or seniority in the transition.
Provost John Etchemendy Ph.D. 'B2
called those claims "not accurate" at an
ASSU joint legislative meeting on Dec.
1.
UGL is required by union contract to
offer all ABM employees the chance to
stay on with the same seniority, wages
and benefits they held previously. In the
rehiring process, however, "several
dozen" of the 134 ABM employees did

not initially pass the security back
ground check or the identity verification
required by federal law, said Stanford
spokeswoman Lisa Lapin. Since then, at
least 18 have been rehired, and the rest
are being given 120 days to obtain the
necessary documentation required to
work legally in the U.S., Lapin said.
The University re-bids the school's
janitorial contract every few years, ac
cording to Etchemendy, and it's "not un
common" for a new company to replace
the current one.
At the Dec. 1 meeting, Etchemendy
said 19 employees still had prob
lems with their identification. Jus
tine Griffin, a UGL spokeswoman,
said "less than 20 percent" of the
134 employees still have problems
and are going through an arbitra
tion process to resolve their identi
fication issues. All employees going
through arbitration remain em
ployed in the meantime, Griffin
said.
The arbitration process, accord
ing to union agreement, is worked
out between the union and UGL
and brings in a third party. Griffin
said the process should be resolved
by late April or early May.
