# Special fees bill stumbles with grads
## Council looks ahead to winter programming 
### ANNA SCHUESSLER STAFF WRITER 
At Wednesday's Graduate Student Council (GSC)
meeting, members welcomed a new voting member, dis
cussed winter quarter programming and voted on a bill
passed by the Undergraduate Senate.
Opening the meeting was the swearing in of Fanuel
Muindi, a graduate student in biology, as a voting member
of the GSC. In previous years, Muindi has been an active
participant at GSC meetings, often acting as a proxy for
other members. Muindi will fill a vacant seat in the voting
contingency.
Addy Satija, one of the GSC's programming coordina
tors, said the programming committee is in the process of
finding a venue for the spring quarter Grad Formal. Satija
invited other members to brainstorm ideas and dates for an
additional winter quarter activity. Headed by Justin Brown,
GSC co-chair and doctoral student, and Imeh Williams, ed
ucation representative, a small committee formed to plan
the Pajama Jam-E Jam, a nocturnal-themed party slated for
Friday, Feb. 18.
The GSC approved funding requested by the Graduate
Student Programming Board on behalf of Rains communi
ty assistants. The Rains staff hopes to extend a campus-wide
invitation to its annual Karaoke Night and has arranged to
have a higher-quality karaoke machine for the night. After
a few brief concerns were addressed, the GSC awarded
funding to the event.
"Does the system have You Tube capability?" asked
Satija. "There are always people who want Katy Perry and
'The Sound of Music' at the same time." This year's event is
scheduled for Friday, Jan. 28.
In the evening's final proceedings, the council turned its
attention to a special fees bill passed by the Undergraduate
Senate on Tuesday. The bill sparked a debate about the
GSC's position toward special fees. Zachary Warma 'll,
who is also the Daily editorial
board chair, attended the meeting
to persuade the council to vote
against the bill, which would allow
student groups that have received
special fees in the year prior to the
election to grow their budgets by 10
percent without petitioning to get
on the ballot. Passing the bill would
undo a measure approved by the
Undergraduate Senate last year,
when Warma was a senator.
"To be perfectly honest, it's an
almost 100-percent undergrad
issue that this bill was trying to ad
dress," said Krystal St. Julien, GSC
funding committee chair. "Since it's
such an undergrad issue, I would
just say that we should support
what the Undergraduate Senate
needs. If they believe that enacting
this bill is the right thing to do, then
that's where I put my support."
But eventually, seven voting
members voted in favor of the bill,
four voted against it and two ab
stained from voting. The bill did not
receive the two-thirds majority re
quired for approval by the GSC.
