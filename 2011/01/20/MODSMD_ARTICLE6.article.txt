# RISKING PERFECTION
## Card, Bruins face off for Pac-10 lead 
### NATE ADAMS DESK EDITOR 
It only takes a quick glance at the
banners in Maples Pavilion to see
just how much Stanford has ruled
the Pac-10 in recent years. The Car
dinal's reign of continued domi
nance stretches back to 2001, and it
has won a regular season confer

ence championship every year
since. As the current Pac-10 season
hits its stride, however, it seems that
adding a mark for 2010-11 may
prove to be anything but routine.
Facing what may be its toughest
obstacle to that goal, the No. 4 Cardi
nal (14-2,5-0 Pac-10) battles for the
outright conference lead as it hosts a
vastly improved UCLA team
tonight. The Bruins (15-1, 5-0) own
the conference's only other undefeat-

Ed record and are hot off a sweep of
the Oregon schools, clocking in with
the nation's No. 8 overall ranking.
"They're athletic and they're ag
gressive," said Stanford head coach
Tara VanDerveer. "They get their
hands on balls, and they disrupt you.
You can't just come into the gym
and stroll along and run your of
fense anyway you want."
The Bruins may be athletic, but
they're also experienced. Four

UCLA upperclassmen Jasmine
Dixon, Darxia Morris, Doreena
Campbell and Rebecca Gardner
average between 20 and 30 minutes
per game. Dixon and Morris are the
most dangerous of that group, each
averaging 11.6 points per game.
Against Oregon State last Saturday,
Dixon went 5-for-6 from the floor
with 11 points in just 15 minutes.

GAME NOTES: Stanford and UCLA are the

perfect conference records. The Cardinal

73 points. Stanford has beaten UCLA in
eight of the last nine meetings between the
two teams.



LUIS AGUILAR/The Stanford Daily
The Stanford women's basketball team will take on its toughest opponent since UConn when it faces UCLA tonight.
The Cardinal and Bruins own perfect 5-0 records in the Pac-10 and currently share the conference lead.
If you ask VanDerveer, though, UCLA's expe
rience is a double-edged sword.
"I think a good thing for us is that we have
played against all of these kids time and time again,
so I don't know that we're going to be surprised,"
she said. "I know Darxia Morris is an outstanding
player, as is Doreena Campbell, and [Jasmine]
Dixon. We know what they're capable of."
Looking at recent history, Stanford certainly
has UCLA's number. The Cardinal has faced off
with the Bruins three times in each of the past three
seasons, and owns an 8-1 record in that timeframe.
Stanford's most recent victory was one of the most
emphatic, a 70-46 finish in the final game of last
year's Pac-10 Tournament.
Tonight's matchup looks to be more closely
contested, though, and regardless of the outcome,
that marks a bit of a change for the Pac-10's com
petitive dynamic. In a sport that isn't known for its
parity, tonight's match will mark the first time in
history that conference rivals Stanford and UCLA
have faced each other with mutual top-10 rankings.
"I think it's great. We need it," VanDerveer said.
"We need more than two, we need three and even
four in the top 25, I'd say. Especially next year,
when we'll have 12 teams, we want to get the atten
tion of the East Coast and the Midwest and say
'Hey, we play basketball out here, too.'"
While VanDerveer gives credit to UCLA's
disruptive defense this season, the Stanford
coach has more options than ever to counter it.
The Cardinal is nothing if not versatile this sea
son, with eight players averaging 16 or more
minutes per game, Jeanette Pohlen is establish
ing dominance as a shooting guard in her senior
year with 27 steals and 16.4 points per game,
while forwards Nnemkadi Ogwumike (16.4
points and 8.5 rebounds per game) and Kayla
Pedersen (11.1 points and 8.1 rebounds per
game) provide power in the paint. Nnemkadi's
younger sister, freshman forward Chiney Ogwu
mike, rounds out the team's top scorers with 10.6
points per game and could make a major differ
ence against a UCLA team that's never shared
the court with her.
In a season that's already had plenty of heroes,
one of the most recent players to step up is Lindy
La Rocque. After overcoming some injury con
cerns early in the season, the junior point guard has
earned her way into the starting lineup with solid
defense and ball control. Against Washington State
last Sunday, she was second on the team in total
minutes with 29. Following her performance in that
game, La Rocque leads the team with a 2.8 assist
to-turnover ratio.
"When I'm out on the court, it's about bringing
energy, playing defense, and doing my j ob, whether
it's knocking down an open shot or passing it down

to the post players," she said. "I think we're playing
well because everyone is focusing on what they
need to do, and that's why the ball is rolling right
now and we're playing some good basketball."
VanDerveer wasn't expecting such immediate
output from plugging in La Rocque as a starter, but
she's certainly happy with the result.
"We went with some different people and when
we felt like we needed some stability in the lineup,

we went with Lindy," she said. "It's the kind of thing
where we were like,' She knows what we're doing,
we'll just give her a shot.'"
La Rocque and the rest of the Cardinal will tip
off with UCLA at 7 p.m. tonight in Maples Pavil
ion. The weekend series will wrap up on Saturday
when Stanford hosts USC at 2 p.m.

WYATT ROY/The Stanford Daily
Stanford head coach Tara VanDerveer has plenty of flexibility this season when choosing her lineups.
The Cardinal is loaded with talent at all positions and has a strong frontcourt presence that
includes Joslyn Tinkle, above. The team will be tested tonight against a similarly deep UCLA squad.
