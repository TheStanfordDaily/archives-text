# RISKING PERFECTION
## Card, Bruins face off for Pac-10 lead 
### NATE ADAMS DESK EDITOR 
It only takes a quick glance at the
banners in Maples Pavilion to see
just how much Stanford has ruled
the Pac-10 in recent years. The Car
dinal's reign of continued domi
nance stretches back to 2001, and it
has won a regular season confer

ence championship every year
since. As the current Pac-10 season
hits its stride, however, it seems that
adding a mark for 2010-11 may
prove to be anything but routine.
Facing what may be its toughest
obstacle to that goal, the No. 4 Cardi
nal (14-2,5-0 Pac-10) battles for the
outright conference lead as it hosts a
vastly improved UCLA team
tonight. The Bruins (15-1, 5-0) own
the conference's only other undefeat-

Ed record and are hot off a sweep of
the Oregon schools, clocking in with
the nation's No. 8 overall ranking.
"They're athletic and they're ag
gressive," said Stanford head coach
Tara VanDerveer. "They get their
hands on balls, and they disrupt you.
You can't just come into the gym
and stroll along and run your of
fense anyway you want."
The Bruins may be athletic, but
they're also experienced. Four

UCLA upperclassmen Jasmine
Dixon, Darxia Morris, Doreena
Campbell and Rebecca Gardner
average between 20 and 30 minutes
per game. Dixon and Morris are the
most dangerous of that group, each
averaging 11.6 points per game.
Against Oregon State last Saturday,
Dixon went 5-for-6 from the floor
with 11 points in just 15 minutes.
