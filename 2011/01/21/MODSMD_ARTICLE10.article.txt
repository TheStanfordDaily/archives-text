## Keep goals vague, says prof GSB study says no to detailed resolutions 
### DANA EDWARDS STAFF WRITER 
Ever wondered why New Year's
resolutions to work out so often
fail? It could be because people set
goals that are too precise, according
to business professor Baba Shiv.
In a forthcoming paper for the
next issue of Psychological Sci
ence, Shiv says numerical ranges
and vague deadlines are more ef
fective at sustaining motivation
than precise numbers and dead
lines because they give people
more psychological leeway.
"The individual desires a biased
outcome," Shiv said. "The brain
functions on that which is favor
able out of a desired range. But if I
force the individual to look at all
the precise measures and informa
tion, then the brain will tend to
focus on the negative."
In other words, if people see
their targets as spectrums, their
minds will focus on the more easily
attainable portions of those spec
trums, Shiv said. They will perceive
their goals as within reach, and
they will stay motivated.
By contrast, if sprinters, for ex
ample, are reminded of their pre
cise previous performances and
told to shoot for precise improve
ments, they will tend to focus on
the negative, Shiv said. That atti

tude will lead them to interpret any
minor setbacks as discouragement
or failure, and they will lose moti
vation.
"Precise information doesn't
allow the individual the leeway to
process the information in a biased
fashion," he said.
In addition, Shiv said, frequent
updates can only discourage.
"There is evidence that the more
people keep track of their exact
progress, the more likely they are
to give up," he said.
Shiv conducted several studies
from late 2009 to early 2011 that
led him to draw these conclusions
about the relationship between the
language of goal-setting and sus
tained motivation as a function of
success.

In one study, Shiv told 106 par
ticipants that flavanol, a chemical
present in cocoa, aids mental acu
ity, adding that one gram of cocoa
was necessary for the effect to
manifest. He gave identical choco
late candy bars to all the test sub
jects. Half of the participants were
told that the bar contained exactly
one gram of cocoa, while the other
half were told that the bar con
tained between 0.5 and 1.5 grams.
All the participants then com
pleted several exercises in Brain
Games, a program that assesses
and trains mental capacity.
"I observed that the people who
were told that their bar contained a
range had brain age scores that
were more favorable than those
who were told their bar contained
exactly one gram," Shiv said.

The data suggest that those who
believed their bar could have con
tained up to 1.5 grams assumed the
maximum and were subsequently
inspired, validating the hypothesis
that people respond more positive
ly to vaguely presented informa
tion.

"It's a classic placebo effect,"
Shiv said, "which gives rise to a
self-fulfilling prophecy."
In another study, Shiv brought
in 39 participants and evaluated
them on the fictional "Holistic
Health Index" scale, telling all of
them that they exceeded the de
sired value, between 45 and 55.
However, he told half the subjects
their exact scores at the start, and
half a rough range that captured
their scores. The participants all at
tempted to lose weight through
their own means.
Shiv found that, like in the
cocoa study, the recipients of the
vague information were more suc
cessful at their respective goals:
they lost more weight on average
than the group who were given an
exact figure.
These ideas have far-reaching
implications in the fields of busi
ness, education, athletics and gen
eral life strategies, Shiv said.
"These days, it's all about numbers
course evaluations, employee
evaluations . . . those are the in
stances when precise information
can end up hurting rather than help
ing."
