hanging out in nature," said Jovel
Queirolo'l4.
"It's all compostable," she said. She
smiled as she tossed some peels into
the shrubbery. "This is how life should
be. What else would you rather do on
a Friday afternoon before partying?
Be in nature!"
Queirolo is part of Stanford Glean,
a student organization that picks fruit
from trees on campus every week.
The team currently works through
the Haas Center for Public Service to
donate fruit to the Free Farm, an
urban farm in San Francisco.
"What completes the entire expe
rience and makes it tangible is to [de
liver food] in the city," said Hannah
Kohrman 'll. "How incredible it is to
see food pass from here to there and
into people's hands."
Susannah Poland 'l2 started Stan
ford Glean during the spring of her
freshman year with Page Chamber
lain, a professor of environmental
earth system science.
"I had been collecting fruit inde
pendently around campus," Poland
said, describing how she and Cham

berlain began surveying campus fruit
trees as part of a larger movement for
poverty relief.
The gleaners gathered by Tresid
der before searching for persimmons,
oranges, tangerines and avocados.
The sun lingered low in the sky, cast
ing a warm glow on the afternoon.
Gabriela Leslie 'l4 described how
Bay Area weather makes a huge dif
ference when it comes to picking fruit
in January.

"At no East Coast school would
you be able to walk around in flats
picking fruit," Leslie said. "This is ab
solutely my stress reliever."
As main campus slowly emptied
itself of students, the hustle of the
weekday disappeared to make room
for the weekend.

For Leslie, the activity has person
al and philanthropic benefits. "When
you're working on a farm or in a gar
den, your physical work produces
tangible results ... rather than your
mental work producing esoteric re
sults," she said. "After being so caught
up in the mental life at Stanford, it's
refreshing to do physical labor."
Stanford's grounds are home to
hundreds of trees with 31 kinds of
fruit, according to Tim Huang 'l4, an
other gleaner.
One of Huang's favorite gleaning
experiences took place in the faculty
neighborhood where the team had

posted flyers stating, "If you want us
to glean your tree, we can do that for
you and we'll leave whatever you
want," Huang recalled.

An elderly man came outside of
his home to ask the team for help
with picking fruit from his per
simmon tree, which Huang de
scribed as laden with "beauti
ful orange orbs like pearls."
Huang was struck by the
generosity of the man, who in
sisted on donating much of his
fruit to the team.
"There was abundance, and
they were willing to share with
the less fortunate," Huang said.
Gleaner Kohrman described
how much she and her team mem-

bers appreciate being able to pro
vide their service. Before getting to
work at the Free Farm, the team
stands together in a circle to hold
hands and share something they are
grateful for.
Gleaners are often proud of the
variety and beauty of the trees they
spend so much time with.
"The first time, I was so amazed
that we have all these crazy fruit trees
here," Leslie said. "There's avocados,
figs, pomegranates."
For Leslie, being around the trees
made her much more appreciative of
fruit. "Normally, I would walk around,
spot a beautiful apple [and move on],"

she said. "After reaching the very top
of a tree with the fruit picker, it was
satisfying to have the apple fall into
my hands."

Queirolo said she sees her work
with Stanford Glean as part of a long
term goal to improve the structure of
the United States' food economy.
"The way agriculture works in our
country is that fruit is really expensive
when it shouldn't be," she said. "Tan
gerines and oranges and persimmons
are hard to get if you're poor. As Stan
ford students, it's our responsibility to
change the way people think about
food and show the underserved that

they deserve healthy, sustainable
fruit."

Queirolo said any Stanford stu
dent is welcome to become a gleaner.
"Something like food justice is perfect
because anyone can do it and you're
learning at the same time," she said.
"All of us agree on the same thing, and
we're doing it to help others. I love it.
You could do this. Do you eat food?"
"Yes. You eat food and you like
food so you should care about this
group," she added.

Stanford's grounds are home to
hundreds of trees with 31 kinds of
fruit, according to Tim Huang 'l4, an
other gleaner.
One of Huang's favorite gleaning
experiences took place in the faculty
neighborhood where the team had

posted flyers stating, "If you want us
to glean your tree, we can do that for
you and we'll leave whatever you
want," Huang recalled.

An elderly man came outside of
his home to ask the team for help
with picking fruit from his per
simmon tree, which Huang de
scribed as laden with "beauti
ful orange orbs like pearls."
Huang was struck by the
generosity of the man, who in
sisted on donating much of his
fruit to the team.
"There was abundance, and
they were willing to share with
the less fortunate," Huang said.
Gleaner Kohrman described
how much she and her team mem-

bers appreciate being able to pro
vide their service. Before getting to
work at the Free Farm, the team
stands together in a circle to hold
hands and share something they are
grateful for.
Gleaners are often proud of the
variety and beauty of the trees they
spend so much time with.
"The first time, I was so amazed
that we have all these crazy fruit trees
here," Leslie said. "There's avocados,
figs, pomegranates."
For Leslie, being around the trees
made her much more appreciative of
fruit. "Normally, I would walk around,
spot a beautiful apple [and move on],"

she said. "After reaching the very top
of a tree with the fruit picker, it was
satisfying to have the apple fall into
my hands."

Queirolo said she sees her work
with Stanford Glean as part of a long
term goal to improve the structure of
the United States' food economy.
"The way agriculture works in our
country is that fruit is really expensive
when it shouldn't be," she said. "Tan
gerines and oranges and persimmons
are hard to get if you're poor. As Stan
ford students, it's our responsibility to
change the way people think about
food and show the underserved that

they deserve healthy, sustainable
fruit."

Queirolo said any Stanford stu
dent is welcome to become a gleaner.
"Something like food justice is perfect
because anyone can do it and you're
learning at the same time," she said.
"All of us agree on the same thing, and
we're doing it to help others. I love it.
You could do this. Do you eat food?"
"Yes. You eat food and you like
food so you should care about this
group," she added.
