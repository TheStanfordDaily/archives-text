wrote a novel in Argentina and was
nominated for a Pulitzer Prize for his
coverage of the birth of the Internet.
As a Knight fellow, Lewis worked
on a project that studied how people
would pay for journalism in a new
economic climate. He wanted to find
away to pay reporters in order to
maintain a flow of high-caliber jour
nalism. Although he did not find a
"best way" to pay, he was pleased to
find that there are many viable op
tions.

It may have helped that Lewis un
derstood the importance of the In
ternet and computers at their incep
tion.

"People really didn't understand
how rapidly the change was going to
take place," Lewis said. "I started
writing about computers for The
New York Times in 1982. Very quick
ly after that, I realized that comput
ers were interesting ... but the real
ly cool thing about computers was
that they were a communications de
vice."

Almost every inch of the
Stanford campus is
"wired," and one of the
key reporters tracking
the development of the
World Wide Web, Peter Lewis, is cur
rently teaching on the Farm.

Because he understood the sig
nificance of the Internet, he became
an early advocate for opening jour
nalism to cyberspace. He argued to
New York Times editors, "There are
more people on the Internet right
now than the population of Poland.
We send a foreign correspondent to
Poland, so why don't you send me to
cyberspace, and I'll be the foreign
correspondent there?"
Early on, Lewis felt optimistic
about the Internet's potential. "Any
time you have a tool that enables
people to communicate better, it's
going to be successful," he said.
In addition to making informa
tion more available to a wider audi
ence, the Internet eliminates the en
vironmental damage inherent in
printed news, Lewis noted.
"Newsprint is environmentally
unfriendly," he said. "You chop down
trees. You print them on these big
noisy presses, and then you throw
them on trucks that spew pollution
and burn gasoline. And it comes out
the day later than something hap
pens."

With his charcoal turtleneck and
blue jeans, Lewis, the Hearst visiting
professor in the communication de
partment, looks the part of an intel
lectual. As a physics enthusiast and
professional journalist, Lewis grew
up combining science and writing.
He analyzed changes around him
through a scientific lens, away of
thinking that shaped his work in dig
ital journalism. But how did he get
there?

Lewis originally did not intend to
be a journalist. He wanted to write
fiction, move to Paris and produce
the next great American novel, he
said.

"A friend of my father's took me
aside and told me I would starve, and
it might be nice to get some writing
experience that would actually pay
for groceries," he said.
So he left the University of
Kansas, where he had studied
physics and journalism, and took a
job at the Osawatomie Graphic
News. A year later, The Des Moines
Register hired him as a reporter. He
went back to school and finished his
degree in journalism at Drake Uni
versity in Des Moines in 1982. He
hasn't left journalism since, going on
to spend 17 years at The New York
Times.

"He definitely knows what he's
talking about," said Kat Lynch 'll, a
student in his digital journalism
course. "All the stuff we discussed in
class ... I feel like I'm going to be
able to use all of it."

In addition to teaching introduc
tory and higher-level journalism
classes, Lewis spent a year as a
Knight fellow at Stanford in 2010,

Lewis's work at Stanford is fo
cused on preparing student journal
ists for an increasingly technological
world.

"It's always gratifying to see your
name in print," he said, but "at this
stage, it's less important to me than
giving back and training a new gen
eration of journalists."
Lewis speculated that mobility
will continue to be a defining feature
of media technology. He predicted
that "flexible, printable displays," or
computer screens that can be rolled
up and stored in one's pocket, will be
available in five to 10 years. He noted
that Piko Projectors in some Asian
cell phones already contain small
video projectors, and he suggests

that eyeglasses with holographic dis
plays of information might even be
commonplace one day.
Although newspapers and maga
zines are shifting their resources and
time to remain relevant in the digital
world and reach larger audiences,

Lewis said the fundamentals of news
writing will remain the same, across
radio, television, podcasts, print and
social networks alike.

Whether in print or in pixels,
Lewis said journalism will continue
to serve a critical role in society.

"Open your eyes," he said. "Look
around. There are so many great sto
ries to tell and so many interesting
people."

wrote a novel in Argentina and was
nominated for a Pulitzer Prize for his
coverage of the birth of the Internet.
As a Knight fellow, Lewis worked
on a project that studied how people
would pay for journalism in a new
economic climate. He wanted to find
away to pay reporters in order to
maintain a flow of high-caliber jour
nalism. Although he did not find a
"best way" to pay, he was pleased to
find that there are many viable op
tions.

It may have helped that Lewis un
derstood the importance of the In
ternet and computers at their incep
tion.

"People really didn't understand
how rapidly the change was going to
take place," Lewis said. "I started
writing about computers for The
New York Times in 1982. Very quick
ly after that, I realized that comput
ers were interesting ... but the real
ly cool thing about computers was
that they were a communications de
vice."

Almost every inch of the
Stanford campus is
"wired," and one of the
key reporters tracking
the development of the
World Wide Web, Peter Lewis, is cur
rently teaching on the Farm.

Because he understood the sig
nificance of the Internet, he became
an early advocate for opening jour
nalism to cyberspace. He argued to
New York Times editors, "There are
more people on the Internet right
now than the population of Poland.
We send a foreign correspondent to
Poland, so why don't you send me to
cyberspace, and I'll be the foreign
correspondent there?"
Early on, Lewis felt optimistic
about the Internet's potential. "Any
time you have a tool that enables
people to communicate better, it's
going to be successful," he said.
In addition to making informa
tion more available to a wider audi
ence, the Internet eliminates the en
vironmental damage inherent in
printed news, Lewis noted.
"Newsprint is environmentally
unfriendly," he said. "You chop down
trees. You print them on these big
noisy presses, and then you throw
them on trucks that spew pollution
and burn gasoline. And it comes out
the day later than something hap
pens."

With his charcoal turtleneck and
blue jeans, Lewis, the Hearst visiting
professor in the communication de
partment, looks the part of an intel
lectual. As a physics enthusiast and
professional journalist, Lewis grew
up combining science and writing.
He analyzed changes around him
through a scientific lens, away of
thinking that shaped his work in dig
ital journalism. But how did he get
there?

Lewis originally did not intend to
be a journalist. He wanted to write
fiction, move to Paris and produce
the next great American novel, he
said.

"A friend of my father's took me
aside and told me I would starve, and
it might be nice to get some writing
experience that would actually pay
for groceries," he said.
So he left the University of
Kansas, where he had studied
physics and journalism, and took a
job at the Osawatomie Graphic
News. A year later, The Des Moines
Register hired him as a reporter. He
went back to school and finished his
degree in journalism at Drake Uni
versity in Des Moines in 1982. He
hasn't left journalism since, going on
to spend 17 years at The New York
Times.

"He definitely knows what he's
talking about," said Kat Lynch 'll, a
student in his digital journalism
course. "All the stuff we discussed in
class ... I feel like I'm going to be
able to use all of it."

In addition to teaching introduc
tory and higher-level journalism
classes, Lewis spent a year as a
Knight fellow at Stanford in 2010,

Lewis's work at Stanford is fo
cused on preparing student journal
ists for an increasingly technological
world.

"It's always gratifying to see your
name in print," he said, but "at this
stage, it's less important to me than
giving back and training a new gen
eration of journalists."
Lewis speculated that mobility
will continue to be a defining feature
of media technology. He predicted
that "flexible, printable displays," or
computer screens that can be rolled
up and stored in one's pocket, will be
available in five to 10 years. He noted
that Piko Projectors in some Asian
cell phones already contain small
video projectors, and he suggests

that eyeglasses with holographic dis
plays of information might even be
commonplace one day.
Although newspapers and maga
zines are shifting their resources and
time to remain relevant in the digital
world and reach larger audiences,

Lewis said the fundamentals of news
writing will remain the same, across
radio, television, podcasts, print and
social networks alike.

Whether in print or in pixels,
Lewis said journalism will continue
to serve a critical role in society.

"Open your eyes," he said. "Look
around. There are so many great sto
ries to tell and so many interesting
people."
