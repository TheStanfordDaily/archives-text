## SENSE AND NONSENSE Race, from America to Stanford 
### Aysha Bagchi 
A lawyer family friend used to
describe the best strategy his
client could use in explaining
past misdeeds as the "dead dog"
method.The cross-examining lawyer
asks, "Did you do such and such?"
Our friend's client responds, "Yes, I
did such and such. And I did more
than such and such. I did all these
horrible, awful such and suches, and I
feel so horrible and awful about
them. Let me tell you all the such and
suches I did, how horrible they were,
and how horrible I feel!" The cross
examining lawyer gets tired of this
lament and tries to move on to a new
subject but the witness will not let
him: "No, wait, I have more to con
fess, more forgiveness to ask for. I
just feel so awful about it, and I can't
get past it." And so on.
I think our family friend told the
story with a mixture of amusement
and cynicism. But imagining a sin
cere situation, the strategy reflects
an earnest truth: Horrible misdeeds
are overcome through deep appreci
ation and acknowledgement of their
horribleness.

In American political discussions
on race today, whites often express
frustration with what they see as the
inability of African Americans to
move forward and focus on the fu
ture. Some individuals look upon
slavery, sanctioned discrimination
and the racial injustices that persist
as a bleeding wound, but the main
stream looks upon most of the injus
tice as in the past and not something
justifiably bound up in how African
Americans understand themselves
today.
The nature of our personal rela
tionships should teach us the impos
sibility of overcoming racial tensions
when most Americans fail to recog
nize the legitimacy of feelings of so
cial alienation among African Amer
icans. When, in close relationships,
one person wrongs another, the
moral relation between the two peo
ple is changed. If their future lives
are bound up together (as is the case
of fellow citizens), the wrongdoing
will eat away at the health of their re
lationship. Only when the perpetra
tor comes to emotionally appreciate
her past wrongdoing, to feel its
weight and express a regret in pro
portion to the crime, does she help to
heal the festering wound. The result
is a cathartic experience for each,
and a contradiction: The past is both
memorialized and expunged.
If Americans hope to achieve a
post-racial America, we must grasp a
difficult truth: Our country's identity
is not distinct from its past any more
than our individual identities are dis
tinct from our pasts. We cannot di
vorce the past. Even if we were to
eliminate all present-day racial in
justice (one of the biggest "ifs" I can
think of), we would not have
"[bound] up the nation's wounds," as
Abraham Lincoln called upon
Americans to do nearly 150 years
ago. Our failure to address the past
in anything nearing the magnitude

of the crimes is why emotional divi
sions run so strong.

This story should not be com
pletely unfamiliar in the Stanford
context. We see the misunderstand
ings here, too. Students believe in tol
erance, yet many still fail to grasp the
importance of community for cultur
al groups on campus, particularly
those who have suffered past injus
tices in this country. We say that com
munity centers divide when we
should aim to unite, that we are in
terested in bridging gaps while cul
tural communities exacerbate differ-

We fool ourselves into thinking
cultural identity can be based exclu
sively on common philosophical
ideals, as if human beings are not
partly contingent creatures, partly
tied to our histories. We fail to grasp
why wounds will bleed for new gen
erations, and, in that context, why
communities of people who share
experiences are essential sources of
strength and affirmation in the midst
of festering wounds.

The real ideal at Stanford would
be to maintain these strong commu
nities while ensuring that cross-cul
tural interaction is common and
meaningful. Community centers and
dorms should not be exclusive, nor
should students when making
friends. The truth is I see this more as
a one-way problem. Students who
belong to cultural community cen
ters do a better job of living up to this
ideal. It is the mainstream that fails
to make the strides necessary to gain
an internal perspective, I was told
that one of the major donors who
helped create Stanford's depart
ment in Comparative Studies in
Race and Ethnicity in 1996 was a
white student who lived in Ujamaa
for a year. That is part of what places
like Ujamaa are about.
Martin Luther King Jr.'s dream
was not just about formal integra
tion. It was also about mutual under
standing. It is to be expected that
many students will come to Stanford
without ever having gained an inter
nal perspective into other minority
groups. The shame is that too many
leave just the same.

Did MLK Day have you thinking?
