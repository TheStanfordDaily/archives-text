# OH! SWEET NUTHIN'
## Clear Mud 
### Roseann Cima 
For a lot of people I know, these
past few months have been
Application Time. Jobs, Ph.D.
programs, fellowships, whatever
you've got. Welcome to personal
statement season. The game? You.
It still astounds me how many peo
ple that I'd consider strong writers
struggle with application essays.
I've had the occasion to read quite a
few applications for staff positions,
and the phenomenon is obvious.
"I've decided that what it is," one
girl said, taking a break from her
third Ph.D. essay mid-midterms
week, "is that I've spent all this time
learning to write honestly. In my re
search, in my writing. But here I've
got to sell myself.
"At this point in my life, the truth
about me is I'm uncertain about a
lot of things, my professional life in
cluded.
"And that just doesn't sell."
MEIO4B, Designing Your Life, is
one official response to this prob
lem evidence that it is wide
spread. Maybe it's the freshman
year humiliation that carries these
students past humble to downright
shy. MEIO4B, which meets once a
week, requires students to think
critically about what they want out
of their lives, what their strengths
are and how to use those strengths
to get what they want. A lot of stu
dents report taking the class just as

away to force themselves to allot
time to consider these issues. Stan
ford keeps them busy enough that
they won't otherwise,
I'm taking the class now, and I
am knee-deep. Right now all vec
tors are pointing at prototyping: We,
as twentysomethings, are still in the
early stages of the design process.
(Those first odd years were need
finding, maybe. Lots of self-obser
vation activities.) So we must not be
afraid to try out lots of things! Go to
career fairs to practice getting job
offers. Try out jobs to figure out
what about them works and what
about them doesn't.

This doesn't eradicate the "cer
tainty" issue. At least so far as the
long term is concerned. They don't
want us to be certain; if we wait for
certainty, we might end up para
lyzed for life, I kind of relish the idea
of an interviewer asking, "So how
much are you willing to commit to
us?" and the MEIO4B grad rolling
up his sleeves and saying, "Well,
what you have to understand here is
that this is a prototype ." But to some

extent, that's legitimate. And once
we've really internalized how truly
legitimate it is, we can start execut
ing these moves with conviction and
start selling ourselves on our
strengths in order to get what we
want, without uncomfortable com
promise. But you've got to mean it.
Mark Applebaum, Stanford's
resident experimental composer
and wacky music professor, has a
few pearls about conviction in un
certainty. You need to sell it, he says,
and demonstrates by playing jazz
with a mitten on his right hand,
smashing all the wrong notes at all
the intentional times. As an artist, he
loves murkiness and he loves doubt.
He once had a composition assign
ment returned to him because a
chord was "muddy." His instructor
told him to write it again.
"No, it's supposed to be muddy.
That's how 1 want it!"
"No no no. Write it again. And
this time give me clear mud."
It's not about whether or not
clear mud sells on a resume. For
most of us, muddiness is inevitable,
and it's no good covering it up. It's
about whether we've learned to get
behind that muddiness and shine
through. With clear enough mud,
we'll have ourselves a prism.

Scintillating? Rosie wants to learn the
art at rcima@stanford. edu.
