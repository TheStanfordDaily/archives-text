## READY FOR REVENGE 
### JENNY PETER STAFF WRITER 
After a tough loss to rival Cal last
week, the men's gymnastics team will
look for redemption as it hosts the
Golden Bears in "The Big Flipoff."
When the teams squared off a

week ago, Cal proved again why it is
one of Stanford's toughest West
Coast rivals. The Golden Bears put
up a big high bar score on its second
to-last event as the Cardinal fell twice
on the parallel bars, enabling Cal to
sneak past Stanford by .95 points.
According to senior captains

Tim Gentry and Abhinav Ramani,
the Cardinal had an intense training
week. The team is doing a high-vol
ume type of training in preparation
the focus is on getting comfort
able with the routines by doing
more reps and making small adjust
ments when necessary. The men

also increased the level of difficultly
in the skills they're attempting this
week, hoping to build on their con
fidence by improving endurance in
more intricate routines. The detail
work will probably start in mid-Feb
ruary, when the team prepares for
conference and NCAA champi
onships in the spring.
Of course, the team's objective
for every meet is to improve from
the previous one.
"Last Friday, we had some un
characteristic mistakes on parallel
bars and pommel horse, and we will
definitely be looking to not repeat
those mistakes on Saturday," Gen
try said.
Besides the boost in preparation,
the Card will get an extra benefit as
some of its competitors return from
the bench. The team wasn't at full
strength last week because of some
minor injuries, including the loss of
sophomore Eddie Penev, the 2010
NCAA champion on vault. Fie will
be back for the meet tomorrow.
"We expect to compete the way
we've been training in practice,"
said redshirt senior Nick Noone.
"Our goal is to show that our work
outs directly reflect our competitive
outcomes. We're expecting Cal to
put up some very big scores, and we
expect to do the same."
Stanford will take on Cal at
Burnham Pavilion on Saturday at 7
p.m.
