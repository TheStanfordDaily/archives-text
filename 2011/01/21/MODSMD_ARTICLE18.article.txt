# To the haters: Why?

### Tom Taylor 
MM H hate all sports as
£ £ ■ rabidly as a person
who likes sports
hates common
sense."
That quote comes courtesy of the
late journalist Henry Louis Mencken,
and he's not alone. There are clubs,
blogs and Facebook groups dedicated
to people who would avoid this entire
section of The Daily like the plague. As
a fan committed enough to volunteer
my free time writing sports stories and
columns, it's hard not to feel a bit insult
ed by the simple blasphemy of the
haters, but there is something else
wrong here. Hating sports just doesn't
make sense.

It's like hating music or reading.
You might not have much interest in a
long and drawn-out opera, but howev
er much you might not want to admit it,
there'll be a tune somewhere that gets
you tapping your feet. You might not
be willing to work your way through
War and Peace, but when a new e-mail
drops into your inbox, I'm sure you
won't mind reading the message.

Many people who go along with
this claim must be simply confusing the
broader concept of sports with the
more organized "Sports" (capital S,
mind you) that monopolize our
screens. It's the same as the difference
between spirituality and organized re
ligions. The big, rich and powerful reli
gious sects are just as desperate for be
lievers, and there are more than a few
cases of religious leaders acting as if
they are above both reason and the
law. You don't have to be a Catholic to
believe in a god (or gods) anymore
than you need to follow the NFL to like
sports.
Physical competition is an intrinsic
part of human nature, whether it be to
gain an advantage within society or
simply for the sheer fun of it. The spec
trum of sport goes from any simple
challenge to go further, faster or higher,
all the way through to the heavily struc
tured major professional sports. It
could be climbing Mount Everest or
just seeing who can get to class first,
playing in the Super Bowl or playing
on a Wii, vying with the world's best
athletes or just competing against
yourself I would be impressed if any
one could go through even a day with
out doing something I could classify
somewhere in there —in fact, even
trying to meet that challenge might dis
qualify you.
Perhaps some of you have an axe to
grind with arrogant jocks at high school
or obnoxious fans from somewhere
else. But you can't tar all of sportsdom
with the same brush if those folks
weren't jerks because of sports, they
were just jerks. There are also people
who take things too far, turning a sim
ple pastime into a serious, maybe
slightly psychotic obsession —"but
you'll get them in any hobby, and most
people like that are ultimately harm
less.
I suspect, too, that a few who say
they hate sports only do so because,
within their social circle, it is cool to be
apathetic about it —to pretend they
don't care long enough that it becomes
a part of who they are. I hope they see
the irony of defining themselves this
way; sport becoming an important part
of their character.
If you consider yourself a hater, or
even a don't-like-er, I implore you to
try an experiment. After all, that's what
college is for. Go find yourself some
friendly fans and get them to take you
along the next time they're heading to

I would be
impressed if
anyone could go
through even one
day without doing
something I could
classify as sports.
a sports bar or, even better, to a real
game. Having someone to explain
what is going on helps, but being
among people really passionate about
anything is seriously infectious;it's im
possible not to get carried along with
the tide of human emotion.

Or maybe grab a ball and go have a
throw-around the next time you need
a break. The great thing about sport is
that it's truly open to all and practical
ly free of the many barriers that seem
to continually keep our species divid
ed. You don't need to know much or
have any special skills: all you need is a
competitive streak and an open mind.
And so, in response to the quote I
started this column with, I'm going to
end by misappropriating one from the
historical figure whose life was com
memorated last Monday, someone
who I hope would have liked the all
inclusiveness of sports.

"I have decided to stick with love.
Hate is too great a burden to bear."
That, of course, comes from Martin
Luther King Jr.

Tom Taylor knows that with just a bit of
baseball and a touch of tennis, the
world will be happier place. Bring him

they hate sports only do so because,
within their social circle, it is cool to be
apathetic about it —to pretend they
don't care long enough that it becomes
a part of who they are. I hope they see
the irony of defining themselves this
way; sport becoming an important part
of their character.
If you consider yourself a hater, or
even a don't-like-er, I implore you to

have any special skills: all you need is a
competitive streak and an open mind.
And so, in response to the quote I
started this column with, I'm going to
end by misappropriating one from the
historical figure whose life was com
memorated last Monday, someone
who I hope would have liked the all
inclusiveness of sports.

"I have decided to stick with love.
Hate is too great a burden to bear."
That, of course, comes from Martin
Luther King Jr.
