## Feds shorten FAFSA Gov't aims to get more low-income applicants 
### CASSANDRA FELICIANO DESK EDITOR 
In an effort to further simplify
the college application process, the
U.S. Department of Education has
released a new version of the Free
Application for Federal Student
Aid (FAFSA) to ease the financial
aid application for students and
their families.

The changes, which include
shorter questions and a color-cod
ing system to help applicants stay
organized, are an annual occur
rence, said director of financial aid
Mary Morrison.
"The idea in the government is
to make it so simple that low-in
come families wouldn't be afraid,"
she added.

Results from a study conducted
by Stanford's School of Education
in 2009 in collaboration with Har
vard, the University of Toronto and
the National Bureau of Economic
Research showed that making it
easier for parents to fill out the
FAFSA form, even if just with the
help of their children, boosted col
lege enrollment rates by 30 percent.

Efforts to drastically change the
FAFS A began two years ago, with a
25 percent reduction in questions,
according to a briefing from Educa
tion Secretary Arne Duncan. How
ever, a national study from Gallup
and Sallie Mae, the nation's only fi
nancial services company that spe
cializes in education, showed that
50 percent of college-bound fami
lies did not fully complete the
FAFSA before sending it in and 28
percent of families did not submit
the form at all.

Families said that "they did not
complete the form because they
were not aware or did not think
they would qualify for aid," wrote
Sallie Mae spokeswoman Erica
Eriksdotter in an e-mail to The
Daily.
In order to facilitate applying for
student aid through the FAFSA,
from which students can receive
grants of up to $5,000, both Sallie
Mae and the FAFSA website offer
tips and how-to videos. The former
will host an online chat forum on
Jan. 27, where parents and students
can receive live help from certified
financial planners on how to fill out
the forms and how best to save
money on higher education costs.

"There are
good stats that
you can find
that show
families just
don't think
there's money
out there."

MARY MORRISON
However, outside help is not nec
essary to facilitate applying for finan
cial aid at all schools, Morrison said. In
fact, the numbers of financial aid ap
plicants continue to increase for Stan
ford, where the FAFSA is required for
entering students along with the CSS
Profile and parents' W2 tax forms.
"At a place like Stanford, federal
aid is wonderful, but it isn't what pays
most [of the costs]," Morrison said.
"FAFSA really only deals with fed
eral grants, which are not anywhere
near enough to pay for coming to
Stanford. We have to supplement
with our own endowment and our
own scholarship funds."
Morrison explained that even for
state schools and community col
leges, a shorter FAFSA might not do
the trick. Plenty of students are still
unaware that when they apply there
are actually possibilities of getting aid.
"Many schools use their own
form or say they don't have any
money," she said, adding, "There are
good stats out there that you can find
that show families just don't think
there's any money out there."
As a result, Stanford has taken
matters into its own hands. The Uni
versity's financial aid officers them
selves often visit or get invited to
high schools "so parents better get
familiar with the forms."

But families need more than just
an easier form.

"Since it costs at least
$25,000 to go to a state school,
having someone pay $5,000
doesn't exactly solve the prob
lem," said Morrison. "We're
going to need more informa
tion to help people,"
