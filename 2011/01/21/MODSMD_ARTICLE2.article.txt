## Feds shorten FAFSA Gov't aims to get more low-income applicants 
### CASSANDRA FELICIANO DESK EDITOR 
In an effort to further simplify
the college application process, the
U.S. Department of Education has
released a new version of the Free
Application for Federal Student
Aid (FAFSA) to ease the financial
aid application for students and
their families.

The changes, which include
shorter questions and a color-cod
ing system to help applicants stay
organized, are an annual occur
rence, said director of financial aid
Mary Morrison.
"The idea in the government is
to make it so simple that low-in
come families wouldn't be afraid,"
she added.

Results from a study conducted
by Stanford's School of Education
in 2009 in collaboration with Har
vard, the University of Toronto and
the National Bureau of Economic
Research showed that making it
easier for parents to fill out the
FAFSA form, even if just with the
help of their children, boosted col
lege enrollment rates by 30 percent.

Efforts to drastically change the
FAFS A began two years ago, with a
25 percent reduction in questions,
according to a briefing from Educa
tion Secretary Arne Duncan. How
ever, a national study from Gallup
and Sallie Mae, the nation's only fi
nancial services company that spe
cializes in education, showed that
50 percent of college-bound fami
lies did not fully complete the
FAFSA before sending it in and 28
percent of families did not submit
the form at all.

Families said that "they did not
complete the form because they
were not aware or did not think
they would qualify for aid," wrote
Sallie Mae spokeswoman Erica
Eriksdotter in an e-mail to The
Daily.
In order to facilitate applying for
student aid through the FAFSA,
from which students can receive
grants of up to $5,000, both Sallie
Mae and the FAFSA website offer
tips and how-to videos. The former
will host an online chat forum on
Jan. 27, where parents and students
can receive live help from certified
financial planners on how to fill out
the forms and how best to save
money on higher education costs.

"There are
good stats that
you can find
that show
families just
don't think
there's money
out there."
