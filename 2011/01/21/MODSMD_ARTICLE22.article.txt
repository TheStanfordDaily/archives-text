# KLAHN, CARD CRUISING
## 
### DASH DAVIDSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Junior Bradley Klahn has started
the 2011 men's collegiate tennis sea
son much as he finished the 2010 one:
with an emphatic victory at a major
tournament. Last May, Klahn won
the NCAA singles title as a sopho
more, becoming Stanford's first
NCAA champion since Alex Kim in
2000.

Klahn didn't play like a person
feeling a lot of pressure as the reign
ing NCAA champion this past week
end at the Sherwood Collegiate Cup,
thoroughly dominating the competi
tion on his way to victory. He didn't
drop a set throughout the five rounds
of the tournament, compiling a stag
gering 60-22 advantage in games won
over the course of the weekend.

"The tournament went very well
on my end. Winning the singles and
the doubles is a great accomplish
ment for me personally," Klahn said.
"I also think the tournament was a
good early test for our team to kind of
see where we match up with some of
the best teams in the country.... It's
certainly a good wake-up call for our
guys to know that we can play with
the top teams, but that there's some
work to be done if we want to succeed
throughout the year and ultimately in
the NCAAs."
Ranked No. 15 and seeded second
heading into the tournament, Klahn
dispatched the two top players from
rival Southern California in the semi
finals and finals No. 3 seed Daniel
Nguyen and No. 1 seed Steve John
son, respectively. The title is Klahn's
second consecutive Sherwood Cup
crown, having defeated Baylor's
Denes Lukacs in last year's final.

The weekend's tournament win is
nothing new for Klahn, who has won
an impressive five tournaments in just
over two years of collegiate experi
ence with Stanford. In addition to the
two Sherwood Cup victories and the
2010 NCAA singles crown, he has
collected the 2010 ITA Northwest
Regional Championship and the
2009 Pac-10 singles title.
The Sherwood Cup was a good
showing for Stanford men's tennis in
general, with junior Ryan Thacher
joining Klahn in the winners' circle
for their triumph in the doubles por
tion of the bracket. This weekend
marked the fifth time Klahn and

Thacher have won doubles titles to
gether.

Overall, four players Klahn,
Thacher, sophomore Denis Lin and
senior Greg Hirshman all ad
vanced to at least the round of 16 in
the singles draw. Freshman Jamin
Ball accrued valuable experience and
showed some tenacity as he bounced
back from a tough first-round loss
against USC's Johnson by resound
ingly winning his consolation match.
But Klahn, as has been the case
since the day he walked on campus as
a freshman from Poway High School
in southern California, was the center
of attention for the men's tennis
team. A player like Klahn is "special,"
in the words of Stanford head coach
JohnWhitlinger.
"He's just a really great kid,"
Whitlinger effused about his star
player. "He's an incredibly hard
worker, he's a fun guy to be around
and he's just a real down-to-earth kid
who also does well academically. It's a
nice combination when you're a good
student and a heck of a tennis player.
I'm really excited for the potential he
has and what his future will hold."

Klahn has already been to the
peak of collegiate tennis, and he says
the experience has only improved his
preparations.
"Winning the NCAAs was a huge
accomplishment for me last year, and
it was a nice reward for all the hard
work I'd been putting in," he said. "I
think that it gave me a lot of confi
dence."

With the success he's had, there's
no doubt Klahn has a bit of a target on
his back. His challenge is to maintain
focus amid his fame and lead Stan
ford back to the top of collegiate
men's tennis. The Cardinal hasn't
reached the pinnacle of the sport as a
team since 2000, and it is in the midst
of the longest championship drought
since the 19705.

The season will heat up next Tues
day as the Cardinal hosts Sacramento
State. The following weekend brings
both Santa Clara and Vanderbilt into
town, making it a pivotal stretch in the
season's early going as teams com
pete for a spot in the National Team
Indoor Championships, which start
on Feb. 18 in Seattle. All three of next
week's matches are at home.
