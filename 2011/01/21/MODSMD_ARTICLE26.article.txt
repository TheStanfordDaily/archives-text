Political activism has always
been integral to Colin
Goddard's life an inter
national relations major and natu
ral-born globetrotter, Goddard has
continually upheld a strong set of
political beliefs. Goddard, a recent
graduate of Virginia Tech, is one of
the 17 survivors of the 2007
Virginia Tech campus shooting.
After that experience, his beliefs
and convictions have only grown
stronger.
In "Living for 32," a documen
tary film based on Goddard's reac
tion to the Virginia Tech massacre,
Goddard voices his concerns about
gun control and his hopes for

change. "Living for 32" draws in
the media's attention with its emo
tional impact and call for action,
particularly resonant because of
the recent Arizona shooting. The
film, directed by Kevin Breslin, has
been shortlisted for an Oscar and
will be screening at the Sundance
Film Festival next week.

Thursday evening, Colin
Goddard spoke with Stanford stu
dents after a screening of "Living
for 32" hosted by Stanford Film
Society in the Roble Theater. For
the Q&A session, he was accompa
nied by another victim of gun vio
lence, Mindy Finkelstein, who was

injured in the 1999 Jewish
Community Center shooting, and
by Linda Piatt, representative for
the Brady Center to Prevent Gun
Violence.

Four years ago, on the morn
ing of April 16, 17 people were
injured and 32 killed in Norris

Hall, Virginia Tech. The film opens
with Goddard visiting the graves of
his classmates on a quiet morning,
and then builds into a sequence of
police reports, glimpses of Norris
Hall and the sounds of blaring
gunshots. Then we cut to Goddard
sitting in a half-lit classroom,

telling us his story with a steady,
determined voice.

At the onset of the attack,
Goddard called 911 the first call
to alert the police of the situation.
Goddard was shot four times and
underwent intense physical thera
py for many months following. He
had the choice to either suppress
what had happened to him or to
internalize and transform it into

positive action, into ideas and
information that could help
strengthen gun-control laws.
"I believe in this, and I don't
want to move on until I've accom
plished something," Goddard said.
In the film, through the use of
his own camerawork, Goddard

helps demonstrate the availability
of guns to potentially dangerous
individuals. He secretly videotapes
his interactions with dealers at gun
shows, and in some instances, he's
able to purchase a gun by showing
only his driver's license to the deal
er, and sometimes not even that.

Through this film, Goddard
hopes to raise awareness of his
story and perspective.

"I believe in the work and in

the message, and this is an oppor
tunity to spread it and for other
people to hear it," he said. He is
also directly involved with gun
control legislation on Jan. 18,
he'll be on Capitol Hill with
Congresswoman Carolyn

McCarthy, introducing a piece of
legislation that would prohibit the

sale of high-capacity magazine

guns, which he believes has "a
direct relation to the shooting at
Arizona and also the shooting at
Virginia Tech." According to
Goddard, at the Arizona shooting,
the shooter only had time to shoot
one ammunition clip, and had it
only contained 15 rounds instead
of 33, not as many people would
have died that day.
"By doubling the size of your
ammunition clips, you don't get

double the amount of deer on

your hunting excursions, you don't
kill double the amount of intrud
ers that come into your home, but
you quite often have double the
amount of innocent people who
are killed," Goddard said.
"Living for 32" ends with a

dedication, listing the names of the
32 people who lost their lives at
Virginia Tech, a list that feels end
less. The film is also dedicated to
the 32 people who are killed every
day in this country due to gun vio
lence.
"That's a Virginia Tech that
happens every day that people just
don't know about, because it does
n't make the front-page paper. Our
generation needs to know that,"
Goddard said.
