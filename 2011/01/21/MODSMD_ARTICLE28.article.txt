Calling all Gilbert and
Sullivan fans! The
Stanford Savoyards is
ready to kick off the new quar
ter with their production of the
comedic opera, "Princess Ida,"
based on Lord Alfred Tennyson's
acclaimed narrative poem "The
Princess."

One of the lesser-known of
the celebrated partners' collabo
rative works, "Princess Ida" first
premiered in January 1884 at
the Savoy Theater in London. It
tells the story of a 21-year-old
girl who is determined to escape
her arranged marriage and

instead run a school for women.

As part of a political
maneuver, Ida (played by Alicia
Triana 'l3) was married to
Prince Hilarion, son of King
Hildebrand, at the young age of
one. On her 21st birthday, Ida's
father, King Gama, was to bring
her to Hildebrand's palace so
that the couple could live
together as husband and wife.
However, given her devotion to
the education of women, and
her desire to assert the rights of
her sex, Ida is not present on the
day in question. Living in one of

Gama's homes somewhere in
the countryside, Ida has started
a woman's university called
"Castle Adamant."
Furious at the violation of
the contract between the two
kingdoms, King Hildebrand
takes King Gama and his men
prisoner and threatens to kill
them should Ida be unwilling to
return from the school after
Prince Hilarion has arrived to
fetch her.
This lively musical is a
satire of feminism, women's
education and Darwinian evolu
tion, and given its innocent, eas
ily understood plot, is sure to be
enjoyed by audiences of all ages.
Incorporating a number of
ridiculous characters from a
woman obsessed with the

"mighty Must" who dreams of
being able to expound on her
theories on the intricacies of the
English language to her students
daily to a trio of somewhat
dimwitted soldiers, "Princess
Ida" will keep its audiences

laughing throughout the show.
