Calling all Gilbert and
Sullivan fans! The
Stanford Savoyards is
ready to kick off the new quar
ter with their production of the
comedic opera, "Princess Ida,"
based on Lord Alfred Tennyson's
acclaimed narrative poem "The
Princess."

One of the lesser-known of
the celebrated partners' collabo
rative works, "Princess Ida" first
premiered in January 1884 at
the Savoy Theater in London. It
tells the story of a 21-year-old
girl who is determined to escape
her arranged marriage and

instead run a school for women.

As part of a political
maneuver, Ida (played by Alicia
Triana 'l3) was married to
Prince Hilarion, son of King
Hildebrand, at the young age of
one. On her 21st birthday, Ida's
father, King Gama, was to bring
her to Hildebrand's palace so
that the couple could live
together as husband and wife.
However, given her devotion to
the education of women, and
her desire to assert the rights of
her sex, Ida is not present on the
day in question. Living in one of

Gama's homes somewhere in
the countryside, Ida has started
a woman's university called
"Castle Adamant."
Furious at the violation of
the contract between the two
kingdoms, King Hildebrand
takes King Gama and his men
prisoner and threatens to kill
them should Ida be unwilling to
return from the school after
Prince Hilarion has arrived to
fetch her.
This lively musical is a
satire of feminism, women's
education and Darwinian evolu
tion, and given its innocent, eas
ily understood plot, is sure to be
enjoyed by audiences of all ages.
Incorporating a number of
ridiculous characters from a
woman obsessed with the

"mighty Must" who dreams of
being able to expound on her
theories on the intricacies of the
English language to her students
daily to a trio of somewhat
dimwitted soldiers, "Princess
Ida" will keep its audiences

laughing throughout the show.

student-run theater company
that has been organizing operas
since its inception in 1973. Each
year, the company produces two
Gilbert and Sullivan musicals
for the Stanford community
and the surrounding area. Not
limited to Stanford affiliates,
their shows attract a wide
assortment of members, from
students, faculty and staff to
Palo Alto residents to those
studying at other universities in
the region. As a part of the cast,
members have the opportunity
to explore the many aspects of
theater production, from help
ing construct and decorate sets
to even working on some of the
costumes.
"They're very self-reliant,
so it was very new for me to not
only be a part of the perform
ance, but also part of the set
building," Triana said. "It was
definitely cool to get in touch
with all the different parts of
the theater."
This winter production,
comprised of a talented group
of performers, musicians and
crew members, is to be followed
by "lolanthe" in the spring of
this year.
"We have people of all lev
els of experience, so if you know
absolutely nothing about the
ater, it's a great way to learn,"
said director Greg Anderson.
Audition and production staff
information for "lolanthe" will
be made available in the coming
weeks.
"Princess Ida" is playing in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium on
Friday and Saturday at 8 p.m.,
with a matinee performance on
Sunday at 2:30 p.m. Tickets are
$l6 general admission, $l2 for
Stanford staff and seniors and
$8 for students.
