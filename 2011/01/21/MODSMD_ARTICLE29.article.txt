## A 						hip-hop history: Rennie Harris Pure movement 
### â€” stav ZIV contact stav: sziv@stanford. edu 
An umbrella term for vari
ous styles, hip-hop is the
culmination of social and
popular dance forms from the sec
ond half of the 20th century,
explained choreographer Rennie
Harris in an interview with
Intermission last week. "There are
a lot of things people don't know
about hip-hop," Harris said

misconceptions he addresses in
choreography, performances,
workshops and lectures across the
nation.
His company, Rennie Harris
Puremovement (RHPM), will per
form an evening of his works from
the past two decades in Memorial
Auditorium on Saturday.
"Something To Do With Love,

Volume 1," is Harris' reflection on
the "trials and tribulations of our
relationships" and the ways they
"teach us about who we are and
why we are here."

Like most of Harris' work, the
2006 piece addresses universal

themes through dance to highlight
commonalities and transcend

social, economic, religious and
racial boundaries. Also on the pro
gram are works set to Parliament-
Funkadelic and Groove Collective,
along with an original composi
tion by ex-soldier and friend of the
choreographer Dru Minyard.
The company's performances
are part of Harris' Institute for
Diversity in the Arts' (IDA)
extended residency this quarter. As
an IDA visiting artist, he also par
ticipated in an Aurora Forum with
Vice Provost for Undergraduate
Education Harry Elam Thursday
evening, and is teaching "The Day
Before Hip-Hop," a combination
lecture and technique course
offered by the Stanford Dance
Division.

The course covers the roots of
the hip-hop genre and its deep
connections to the history of

African-American and Latino

communities. Beginning in the
classroom with the question of
slavery, Harris traces paradigm
shifts in consciousness that
enabled the eventual growth of
hip-hop. He introduces the inno
vators and pioneers of the mid
-1960s that ushered in the dawn of
hip-hop culture.

Later, in the studio, Harris
expounds on the ideas he has pro
posed in the classroom, linking

theory to aesthetics and musicality.
He cultivates an understanding of
"the small things that make the
hip-hop," with particular attention
to bodies creating music and
rhythm. "You become the compos
er, and you should know what the
dance sounds like," he told his stu
dents.

Stanford is the third institu
tion in the U.S. to offer its

students the opportunity
to make such a unique
foray into hip-hop his-

Tory and theory; Harris has
previously taught similar
courses at UCLA and the

University of
Colorado.
Born and
raised in North

Philadelphia,
Harris has
been danc
ing since he

was a teenager,
picking up his
first notions '
of rhythm and
movement in

church, in clubs and on the
streets. For him, as is the case

for hip-hop in general, dancing
is an inherently social activity,
meant to be a shared experience
and part of a larger community

ethos. He founded RHPM in 1992,
and has become internationally
renowned as a choreographer and
nationally recognized for his lec
tures and workshops on the ori
gins of hip-hop.
Harris strives to engage audi
ences with hip-hop dance on the
concert stage to amend the stereo
types and negative images televi
sion has created. The media's ten
dency toward a narrow and super
ficial portrayal of hip-hop has per-

petuated a simplistic view of the
form, one that doesn't recognize its
myriad influences, inventive spirit
and potential to bring people
together.

Hip-hop, "the only thing that's
new in this country," and the most
truly expressive voice of this gener
ation, Harris says, will bring
younger audiences to the theater, if

presenters are willing

to put hip-hop where

ballet and modern
are the standard
line. Lively Arts

has done just that, and

will present Rennie Harris
Puremovement on Saturday at
8 p.m., with an abbreviated

family matinee at 3 p.m.
