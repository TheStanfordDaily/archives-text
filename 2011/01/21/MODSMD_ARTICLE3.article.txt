# BRUINS BASHED
## CARD TAKES CONFERENCE LEAD AFTER TOP-10 CLASH 
### JACK BLANCHAT NATE ADAMS 
In a duel for supremacy atop the
Pac-10, the No. 4 Stanford women's
basketball team (15-2, 6-0 Pac-10)
thumped the No. 8 UCLA Bruins
(15-2, 5-1 Pac-10), 64-38, on Thurs
day night at Maples Pavilion.
The Bruins, previously undefeat
ed in Pac-10 play, came in riding
high after dismantling the Oregon
schools last weekend, but the Cardi
nal proved that the road to the Pac
-10 title will go through Maples once
again in 2011.
Head coach Tara VanDerveer,
pleased with the tough victory, gave
credit to her leaders.

"I'm really pleased with how our
team battled," she said. "UCLA is a
very aggressive team, and I think
our leadership and our frontline re
ally battled."
Stanford's "Big Three" of senior
forward Kayla Pedersen, senior
guard Jeanette Pohlen and junior
forward Nnemkadi Ogwumike
were dominant, as all three finished
in double figures on the scoreboard.
Pedersen was the MVP of the
three, dropping in 18 points on 6-for
-9 shooting from the floor, as well as

adding 10 rebounds en route to her
fourth double-double of the season
and her second-highest point total
of the year.
The Bruins came out challenging
the Cardinal at every turn in the first
half, including pressing the entire
length of the court on every Cardi

nal possession.
UCLA may have been making
Stanford earn its baskets, but the
Cardinal was also the only team
scoring early on. The Bruins' first
basket of the game came with 15:15

use
(12-5,4-2 Pac-10)
