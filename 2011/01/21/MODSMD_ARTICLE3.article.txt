# BRUINS BASHED
## CARD TAKES CONFERENCE LEAD AFTER TOP-10 CLASH 
### JACK BLANCHAT NATE ADAMS 
In a duel for supremacy atop the
Pac-10, the No. 4 Stanford women's
basketball team (15-2, 6-0 Pac-10)
thumped the No. 8 UCLA Bruins
(15-2, 5-1 Pac-10), 64-38, on Thurs
day night at Maples Pavilion.
The Bruins, previously undefeat
ed in Pac-10 play, came in riding
high after dismantling the Oregon
schools last weekend, but the Cardi
nal proved that the road to the Pac
-10 title will go through Maples once
again in 2011.
Head coach Tara VanDerveer,
pleased with the tough victory, gave
credit to her leaders.

"I'm really pleased with how our
team battled," she said. "UCLA is a
very aggressive team, and I think
our leadership and our frontline re
ally battled."
Stanford's "Big Three" of senior
forward Kayla Pedersen, senior
guard Jeanette Pohlen and junior
forward Nnemkadi Ogwumike
were dominant, as all three finished
in double figures on the scoreboard.
Pedersen was the MVP of the
three, dropping in 18 points on 6-for
-9 shooting from the floor, as well as

adding 10 rebounds en route to her
fourth double-double of the season
and her second-highest point total
of the year.
The Bruins came out challenging
the Cardinal at every turn in the first
half, including pressing the entire
length of the court on every Cardi

nal possession.
UCLA may have been making
Stanford earn its baskets, but the
Cardinal was also the only team
scoring early on. The Bruins' first
basket of the game came with 15:15

Leading her team to its biggest victory of the conference season, Kayla
Pedersen, No. 14 above, posted a game-high 18 points against UCLA
last night. It was the senior forward's second-highest point total of the year.
left in the half.
The game moved quickly and qui
etly until a Pedersen three-pointer
followed by a left-handed layup gave
the Cardinal a 15-4 lead with 11:02 to
go in the half.
For UCLA, preseason Naismith
Award candidate Jasmine Dixon
took the Bruins into her own hands.
Dixon, who finished with 12 points,
then made three consecutive buckets
for the Bruins, cutting the Stanford
lead to nine points with 6:20 left in
the half.

Freshman forward Chiney Og
wumike made back-to-back buckets,
then redshirt senior Melanie Mur
phy playing for the first time this sea
son, poked away a steal and took it all
the way for a layup to give Stanford
the 32-15 lead it held at the halfway
mark.

The "Big Three" then put the
game on ice, as they combined for 21
points on a 23-6 run in the first 10
minutes of the second half. Pedersen
ended the game with 18 points,
Pohlen with 14 and Nnemkadi Og
wumike with 13.
Stanford's defense was once
again solid, and UCLA struggled to
find the basket all night, shooting a
meager 29.4 percent for the game.
Bruin head coach Nikki Caldwell de
scribed the shooting as "horrible,"
but also gave credit to a Stanford
team that has the advantage in the

Pac-10 once again.
"I think they have all of the mak
ings of a championship run. You look
at the size, the shooters, the leader
ship, the experience," Caldwell said.
"They've been there, they know
what it's like when you get to that
final game and you don't walk away
with that trophy. When you're in that
situation, you come back even hun
grier."

Stanford has now beaten three
top-10 opponents by a total of 75
points at Maples this season, but the
Cardinal still had a few troubles.
Stanford outrebounded UCLA 44-
27, but only had 13 offensive re
bounds and turned the ball over 15
times.

"I'm not trying to be a killjoy, but
the bar is really high for this team,"
VanDerveer said. "In order to really
go where we want to go, we can't just
say 'Oh, everything was okay.' Teams
are being physical, teams are being
super aggressive and we can't have
the ball taken out of our hands."
When asked if this was the best
the team could play, Nnemkadi Og
wumike echoed her coach.

"No. At the same time, I think
we've improved. Obviously, we're
playing well, but we want to win
game the way we really want to," she
said. "With every project that we
have, we kind of forget about anoth
er thing."

Stanford will have another
chance to improve tomorrow after
noon, when the Cardinal hosts USC.
The Trojans looked to be another top
contender for taking a share of the
Pac-10 lead, as they entered the

weekend with just one conference
loss. The Trojans (12-5,4-2) lost a bit
of steam last night, however, falling
to Cal in Berkeley by a score of 82-
71.

Regardless, VanDerveer gives
praise for USC's strong play this sea
son.

"I've been really impressed
watching USC play," she said.
"They're a different team and some
teams match up better with other
teams. They played a really good
game against Xavier, and Xavier is a
great team with great players. They
have great speed, when I watch them
they're not as athletic... but they
have some really talented offensive
players. They're getting to be that
same team like UCLA, with more
experience."
The Trojans ultimately lost that
early December game against
Xavier, 69-66. Regardless, the nar
row loss against the then-No. 4 Mus
keteers was enough to turn heads
around the Pac-10, if not the nation.
The Cardinal may see more of
Murphy tomorrow, too.
"I think that [it's good] having an
other option with [Murphy's] experi
ence," VanDerveer said. "And she
feels quicker. She feels like she's
moving really well. I think it would
be great to have another experi
enced, healthy body out there."
The Trojans will visit Maples
Pavilion Saturday afternoon, tipping
off with the Cardinal at 2 p.m.
