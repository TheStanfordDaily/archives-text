You know how some
times you go to the
movies to see a comedy
and find that the only funny
parts in the movie had
already been shown in the pre-

view? That's my biggest movie pet
peeve second only to the people
who clap at the end of a movie
and that's exactly what I imagined
the "The Green Hornet" cinematic
experience to be like. Oh how
wrong I was.

Britt Reid (Seth Rogen) is a
goofy 20-something party boy who
is forced to man up when his

father, owner of Los Angeles' "The
Daily Sentinel," unexpectedly dies.
As heir to the monstrous fortune
and responsibility, Britt does what
any other incredibly wealthy and
powerful young individual would
do: he decides to employ his
resources, one of which is his

father's Swiss Army knife-like

mechanic Kato (Jay Chou), and
fight crime under the name "The
Green Hornet." Even though
Rogen plays the same character he
seems to play in all of his movies,
his comedic manipulation of the

comic book hero makes
"The Green Hornet"

unconventional, funny and
simply entertaining.

Unlike most other sober,
melodramatic comic book hero
movies, "The Green Hornet"
rounds up all superhero cliches,
takes them for a spin in Britt and
Kato's super sweet ride and then
shoots them with a fart gun.
Diversion from the norm sets this

movie apart. For example, instead
of a maniac demonic villain, we
get Chudnofsky (Christoph Waltz
of "Inglourious Basterds"
the insecure, self-con
scious, wannabe bad

guy. Instead of a
crime-fighting team
that righteously fights
for justice, we get a
bromance that decides
to clean up the streets of
L.A. after realizing their
lives have been inconsequential
up until that moment. And instead
of guys in tights and capes, we get
dudes who kick butt in attire "GQ"
would be proud of. Again, disre
gard for the traditional seriousness

I that plagues most
films makes "The
Green Hornet" an unex
pected breath of fresh air
in the comic book hero
genre.

The cast surprised me as well,
given that many notable stars
signed on to play arguably
insignificant roles. I mentioned
earlier that Waltz played
Chudnofsky, the bad guy, and
sadly did not take the character as
far as he could have, given his per-

formance as tiber-Nazi Col. Hans
Landa in "Inglourious Basterds."
Cameron Diaz ("There's
Something About Mary") plays
Lenore Case, the love interest of
both Britt and Kato talk about
trouble in parbrodise and
Edward James Olmos ("Stand and

Deliver") plays Axford, papa Reid's
most trusted advisor at "The Daily
Sentinel." Neither star delivers a
poor performance, though neither
star has enough material to make a
remarkable performance either
way.
The star-filled cast did not add
or subtract to the quality of the
film and thus was unnecessary,
with the exception of Rogen and
Chou, who were a great goof
ball/straight-man pair. Viewing the
film in 3-D was also unnecessary,
because the third dimension was
mostly used to display depth of
field rather than to have bullets
and kicks flying in your face. My
advice to you would be to get
yourself some popcorn with the
extra money you save not viewing
3-D.

Nonetheless, the superfluous
star cast and 3-D antics are neither
here nor there; the moral of this
story is that "The Green Hornet" is
a great movie to watch if you just
want to sit back and laugh.
