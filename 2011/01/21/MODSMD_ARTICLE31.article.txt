Quick camera shots of a
1930s microphone accom
panied by clever and
melodic piano tunes open another
stunning British film in which Colin
Firth is the shining star.
"The King's Speech," directed
by Tom Hooper, tells the story of
Albert Frederick Arthur George,
Duke of York (Firth), whose promi
nent speech impediment promotes
an unexpected yet exceptionally
complementary relationship with
Lionel Logue, a speech therapist
played by the incomparable Geoffrey
Rush.

The film, taking place in
London just before England declares
war on Germany in 1939, engagingly
paints a portrait of Albert, nick
named "Bertie," the stammering son
of King George V. At the beginning
of the film, Albert reluctantly agrees
to accompany his loving wife

Elizabeth (Helena Bonham Carter)
to yet another speech therapy

appointment, in an attempt to cor
rect his humiliating imperfection.
Here he meets Logue, a modest
Australian whose quirky manner
isms, confident tone and unconven
tional methods of speech correction
initially shock and upset Albert.
Logue insists on calling the duke
"Bertie," emphasizing equality
between the therapist and patient,
and their sessions include rolling on
the floor and rounds of heavy curs
ing and singing. Logue's direct and
witty comments bring humor to the
film as this commoner cleverly dis
regards the norms of interacting
with royalty.
Albert's remarkably uncomfort
able attempts to speak are well-

emphasized by the cinematography
of the film shots of Firth's face
and mouth fill the screen so that
even the audience feels nervous

every time he talks and attempts to
make words in between stutters and
clucking sounds.
Logue's optimism and will to
succeed offset Albert's lack of self
confidence and constant embarrass
ment. Meanwhile, Logue is aided by
Albert's wife, Elizabeth, who shows
unfailing support for her husband.
Bonham Carter's role is modest but
crucial, and she plays it flawlessly.
Not unexpectedly, Albert's trust
of Lionel grows throughout the film.
The strength and courage in Albert
slowly emerge from their hiding

place, as does the truth of his sad
childhood. As in many other British
films, the drama and imperfections
of the royal family are revealed by
Albert's past as well as through the
actions of Albert's careless older
brother David, who becomes King
Edward VIII (Guy Pearce). David's
relationship with the divorcee Wallis
Simpson (Eve Best) leads to his
abdication of the crown in favor of
Albert.
The upcoming coronation adds
to the intensity and stress of the
plot, as Albert and his speech are put
to the test. He must prove himself to
his country and provide his people
with the moral leadership and
courage they will need for the trials
ahead. The pressure of his family,
the press and the nation is on.
Colin Firth has just nabbed the
Golden Globe for best male per
formance in a motion picture
drama, and rumors of Academy
Award nominations for "The King's
Speech" are no surprise. This film
sits at the top of the year's movies.
And wears a crown.
