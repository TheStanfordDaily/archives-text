"Season of the
Witch," a thriller
action movie featur
ing Nicolas Cage
("National
Treasure") and Ron

Perlman
("Hellboy"), sadly
fails to meet the audi-

ence's expectations with

a cliched storyline, extreme

predictability and distasteful

gruesomeness. Furthermore, the
movie is coarsely made, paying
no respect to careful editing.
The movie opens with the
hanging of witches, a scene that
sets the dark tone of the movie.
"Season of the Witch" is a classic
story of crusaders saving human
ity from the curse of some evil
force. At the outset, the two disil
lusioned crusaders, Behmen
(Cage) and his pal Felson
(Perlman) are deserting the
Church after fighting countless
bloody wars and murdering
many innocent people in the
name of God. But what's waiting
for them back home is the terri
ble Black Plague, believed to be a
curse cast by the black witch.

Recaptured by the Church,
Behman and Felson are forced on
a treacherous journey to escort a
young girl, the accused witch, to
a faraway monastery to destroy
her power and save the world.
Such is the storyline that
serves as the bible for almost all
action-hero movies. The only
problem with copying a template,
though, is the lack of creativity,
which is the main defect that
plagues this movie. Nothing is
new, and the movie is so pre
dictable that the audience in the
cinema was constantly muttering
lines before the actors themselves
did. We couldn't help but admit
that this is an unsuccessfully

mundane exploration into the
theme of heroes, crusaders,
knights, gods and witches.
Other than sporadic humor,
the whole movie portrays the jour
ney as a dark, hard struggle
between the escorts and the witch
girl. The escorts are attacked, natu
rally, and director Dominic Sena
surely intends to excite the crowd
with some graphic fighting scenes.
Yet again, action is just average in
this movie, and the suspense built
in the film is a yawn. In a word,

the movie is simply not that
thrilling.
Not even a sickening depiction
of the Black Plague spices up the

plot. The dying and the dead all
bear gross, monstrous appearances
that outrageously exaggerate the
real symptoms of the bubonic
plague. The only thrill you'll get
from the visual is the turning in
your stomach.
However, what is most unac
ceptable about this movie is the
editing. In a scene with two people
on their rugged horses looking
into the distance, the epic atmos
phere created by the limitless sky
enveloping the vast land beneath
completely vanishes when a furry
microphone hangs down the top,
contrasting sharply with the back
ground. The microphone shows up

three times in that scene, and we
have to wonder how that kind of
editing mistake could have possi
bly been overlooked.
That being said, what else can
we expect of Cage after last year's
equally predictable "Knowing"? It
seems Cage is past his prime. An
Academy Award proves Cage's skill
as a thespian is certainly indis
putable, but you'd think he'd have
the skill to pick better projects
than the disappointing "Season of
the Witch."
