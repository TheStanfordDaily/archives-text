## Tamara Chalabi explores pre-Hussein Iraq 
### â€“ sarah GUAN contact sarah: sguan@stanford. edu 
In "Late for Tea at the Deer Palace," Tamara
Chalabi writes a colorful family history, a
story inextricably tied to the recent tumult
in Iraq. She follows several generations of her
family through domestic milestones like mar
riage, detailing the inevitable public life that
came with being one of the prominent families
of Baghdad in the turbulent period from the
end of World War II until Saddam Hussein's
rise and fall.

Chalabi reveals a side of Iraq that is often
overlooked amid today's news reports about
strife and radicalism, one populated by real

people that easily capture the reader's sympa
thies. Chief among these characters is Bibi, the
author's grandmother, who plays a prominent
role throughout the story. She is a self-assured,
vibrant woman who immediately hits it off
with her father-in-law, the politician Abdul
Hussein Chalabi, charming him with her unla
dylike interest in current events and the outside
world. We see her eventually lay aside her abaya,
the long black veil by which conservative

Muslim women are often characterized, under
the influence of a progressive movement that
sweeps through Baghdad, and the Chalabi
household with it.
Bibi is an excellent portrayal of a three
dimensional Iraqi woman, neither the terrified
and oppressed Muslim wife nor the recklessly
defiant runaway bride of conventional Western
media; her unexpected defiance gives the reader

rare insight into what is often seen as a mono
lithic, alien culture. Indeed, one of the best and
most fascinating aspects of the book is its por
trayal of the interaction between Western and
Middle Eastern culture in Baghdad as the city,
already diverse and populous by Middle Eastern
standards, struggles to modernize. (This is per
haps best captured by Chalabi's sensitive por
trayal of the Iraqi Jewish community.)

Bibi, as a woman of means, the wife of a
prominent family, is the perfect mouthpiece for
such a conflict. Through her eyes, we see Iraq as
it once was, a society with a rich cultural her
itage, clinging to vestiges of its former grandeur.
Hints of mosaic tiles and lush Persian carpets
and a city bristling with minarets all recall the
splendor of old Mesopotamia; throughout the
book, there is a palpable longing for the glory

days of yore.
The Chalabis were a wealthy and influen
tial household; their estate was known as "Deer
Palace" for the distinctive statue of a deer that
graced its front lawn. There, they entertained a
number of luminaries of the day, including
King Faisal himself. Bibi saw much of her
extended family, including several of her chil
dren, go into politics at a time of instability, fla
grant abuse of power and cautious hope. While

Iraqi politics and the chronology of historical
events are, especially to a Western audience, less
engaging and often difficult to follow, Chalabi
handles them well, balancing the necessarily

drier parts with humor and personal anecdotes.
The reader's confusion, especially with
regard to the morass of foreign names and his
tories, is to be expected in this sort of book. If
anything, Chalabi would be guilty of oversim
plification; perhaps in an effort to render the
story more accessible (though one could go as
far as to call her somewhat black-and-white

politics self-indulgent her sympathies are
quite apparent), she writes the various factions
in a more heavy-handed, polarized manner
than is necessary.

It is apparent, regardless, that Chalabi, with
her doctorate in history, is more an academic by
trade than a storyteller. She writes with a mani
fest passion for the subject matter but still man
ages to deliver stretches of rather uninspiring
prose. She has an irksome tendency, particularly
at some of the critical, emotional moments in
the tale, to tell rather than show, as if she were
too cautious to tackle the subject matter head
on. After Bibi recovers from an illness, Chalabi
says, rather tritely, "When she recovered, they
appreciated just how precious she was to them,
just as she realized how important her family
and her homeland were to her." Equally awk
ward are her attempts to splice her experiences
of Iraq in the modern day with the stories of

her grandparents in a pre-Saddam Baghdad;
her transitions are invariably jarring. This is fur
ther exacerbated by the meandering, somewhat
inconsistent pacing of her story, an affliction

common to memoirs written by those unfamil
iar with the form.
Tamara Chalabi is in the fortunate position
of having a compelling tale to tell, with the lin
guistic competence and editorial acumen to tell
it adequately, if not beautifully. The strengths of
the book lie in the uniqueness and inherent
appeal of the story more so than the way she
presents it. It provides, nonetheless, a refreshing
perspective on the circumstances leading up to
today's conflicted Iraq.
