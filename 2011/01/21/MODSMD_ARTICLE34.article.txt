Cage the Elephant are anti-establish
ment and they want you to know it,
A grunge album for angsty
teenagers that want to affirm their individ
uality but are too young to know of
"Nevermind," "Thank You, Happy
Birthday" makes a great listen if you're

looking to buy into the fallacy of commer
cial independence. And if you're one of
those "Indy Kidz," then stay away Cage
The Elephant are serious artists and want
nothing to do with your poser, sheep-herd
ways.
Although the album is good enough,
with a fair mix of head-bangers and
restrained ragers, the band's vocalist and
frontman Matt Schultz spends much too
much time protesting the system to be able
to deliver a sound record. Nevertheless,
with his slurred vocals and unbridled ener
gy, this latest release makes for a fun trib
ute to the grunge generation of the early
90s.
One such testament to the Seattle
scene comes in the second track, wittily
titled "Aberdeen" after the childhood home
of Nirvana members Kurt Cobain and
Krist Novoselic. Coincidence or not, the
song features the distorted guitars, raging
vocals and distant background effects of
bands such as Nirvana and The Pixies.
Instead of a Wall of Sound, the heavy gui
tar riffs build up a Wall of Noise so thick
that even Schultz's characteristic husky
growl becomes difficult to discern.
Next on the track list, "Indy Kidz"
pokes fun at mindless indie music fans, but
at times its cynicism proves to be too
much, as does its raucous racket of guitars
and shameless drumming. "Shake Me
Down," the obvious pick for first single,
provides a welcome rest from the dissonant
chords, and instead builds a more passive
version of grungy rock. One of the most
enjoyable songs on the album, its
restrained vocals and rhythmic guitar
plucking are reminiscent of another Cage
the Elephant single with staying power,

"Back Against the Wall."
"2024," an absurdly catchy, short num
ber that revitalizes the album like a shot of
adrenaline, is followed by the heaviest track
on the album, "Sell Yourself." An angry,
uninhibited rager, it voices mock lyrics
apparently inspired by their label. "You are
ready for the masses... Sell yourself, don't
be a foolf a decidedly pissed Schultz
screeches into the mike. Coupled with
MGMT's "The Handshake," these may be
the two strongest tracks to antagonize the
music industry. To counter the outrage,
"Rubber Ball" follows. Gentle strumming
on the guitar and breathy vocals make for a
beautifully muted acoustic session that lulls
and comforts the way "2024" energizes.
The best track on the album is by far
"Right Before My Eyes," an indie pop keep
er which refreshingly pays service to no
one. Schultz drops his voice to a straight
forward drone, while the restrained guitars,
drums and cymbals deliver the easiest lis
ten on the album. The lyrics convey the
deepest introspection and the muted power
chords the best wrap-up on the album.
After a couple of other scruffy punk
numbers, "Flow," the last track on the
album, rolls around. A twangy Americana
song, it develops slowly, unfolding swirling
vocals, hand drums and some shaken per
cussions to end on a subdued tribal mood.
After a good 15 seconds of silence, a
stripped down version of "Right Before My
Eyes" makes an encore.
As a whole, the album presents a sur
prisingly wide array of genres, but is still
deeply indebted to the rule-bending bands
of the early 90s. And while there are subtle
gems in the track list, it suffers too much
from its uneasy, redundant attacks on the
music scene's hypocritical standards to be
taken for a stellar release.
