## Grading the Golden Globes fashion 
### â€“ lauren WILSON contact lauren: lhwilson@stanford. edu 
The Golden Globes are notoriously
known as the Academy Awards' less
important, boozier cousin. While they
may not have as much clout as their fellow
Oscars, the Globes certainly aren't lacking in
the fashion department. Intermission presents
the good, the "meh" and the tragic from
Sunday's award ceremony.
THE BEST
Catherine Zeta-Jones
Green was certainly the color of the night
see Angelina Jolie and Mila Kunis. However,
none did it better than a regal Zeta-Jones in
her stunning Monique Lhuillier gown.
Olivia Wilde
The "TRON" star made a splash with her
fabulous princess gown and balanced out the
drama of the Marchesa with a casual hairdo.
Dianna Agron
The "Glee" star's glamorous old-
Hollywood look was perfectly complemented
by her gorgeous retro waves.
Anne Hathaway
It's not easy to pull of the "Dynasty" -
esque shoulder pads of Hathaway's Armani
Prive, especially when you're competing
against Angelina Jolie. After the equally sleek
Armani Prive Hathaway wore to the 2009
Academy Awards, we think we're sensing a pat
tern here and we certainly don't mind.
Eva Longoria
Why so sad Eva? The newly single
Longoria seemed to be channeling Morticia
Addams in her jet-black Zac Posen. But with
the gown's perfect, curve-hugging fit, mourn
ing never looked so good.
ALMOST THERE
Emma Stone
Stone could have stunned in her orange
minimalist Calvin Klein but her borderline
Wayne Newton spray-tan made it uncomfort
ably difficult to differentiate between fabric
and skin.
Nicole Kidman
Remember when Nicole Kidman's red
carpet dresses were something to be excited

about? There was the chartreuse Dior, the ice
blue, feathered Chanel and the bright-red, big
bowed Balenciaga. She looks perfectly lovely in
this year's one-shouldered, pale-yellow Prada
but the safe, bland choice makes us long for
the Nicole Kidman of red carpets past.
THE WORST
Helena Bonham Carter
Bonham Carter had several plum roles
last year as the Red Queen in "Alice in
Wonderland," psychotic Bellatrix in "Harry
Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part I" and
Queen Elizabeth in "The King's Speech." Too
bad she chose to channel the craziness of
Bellatrix and not the elegance of the Queen
with her crazy hair, confused dress and mis
matched shoes.
Jennifer Lopez
l.Lo's known for her bold, fierce fashion
choices. So how does she explain this matronly
snore of a dress? The white Zuhair Murad
gown looks like a David's Bridal cast-off
topped with some sort of weird, see-through
lampshade.
Halle Berry
You can't really blame Berry for flaunting
her rockin' bod in this Nina Ricci bustier dress.
However, the deconstructed black dress with
its tulle mullet of a train comes off as more
tacky than classy.
Lea Michele

The usually reliable red-carpet darling
made a misstep with her unkempt hair and
disorganized, bubblegum-tinted Oscar de la
Renta. After similarly monochromatic and
dramatic gowns at last year's Emmys and
Golden Globes, it may also be time to shake
things up.
Natalie Portman
Portman was radiant with her newfound
maternal glow. Unfortunately, she tarnished it
with the cheap, craft-store rose awkwardly
glued to the front of her dress.
