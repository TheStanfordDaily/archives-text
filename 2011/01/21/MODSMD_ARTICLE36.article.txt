# Roxy Sass' guide to winning at ski trip
## 
### â€“ roxy SASS FRIDAY 
Ski trip comes at a delicate
time in the school year. Let's
face it for most, Roxy
included, the beginning of fall
quarter is a time filled with utter
and unfettered potential: from the
cute guy upstairs to that hot rower
down the hall to the programmer
in her class that Roxy wants to pep
per with talk both nerdy and dirty.
But by the time January rolls
around, fall flings have awkwardly
faded, the regrettable dormcest
hookup still passes your door every
time you're headed to a meal and
rumor has it that the cutie down
stairs dumped the significant other
over break. It's a whole different
ball game.
When it comes to ski trip,
Roxy knows that the combination
of mountain air, close quarters and
(Smirnoff) ice can catalyze some
awkward and some completely
delicious drama up in Tahoe. For
maximum enjoyment of your time
in the snow, Roxy's foolproof tips
will guarantee a little extra soreness
no, not from snowboarding
as well as a chance to leave behind
a creative snow angel after a tryst in
the snowbank.
The first setting for the art of
ski trip flirtation is on the slopes.
Roxy's feminist side usually argues
that girls can do anything guys can
do, but even she'll admit that girls
have it easier in situations like
group sports. If you're an alpine
master, boys will be impressed; if
you're stuck on the green slopes, it's
still easy to look cute even when
you fall. Roxy's a pretty skilled skier
herself, but even she wouldn't be
above spending her day on the easy
slopes if it means getting some
"help" from that cute ski instructor
or from a ruggedly handsome dor
mmate. Shoop, shoop, indeed.

Then, after the lifts close for
the day, the inevitable question
back at the cabin creeps up: hot
tub? Brief disclaimer: Roxy's got a
high tolerance for the questionable,
but she'll admit that sometimes hot
tubs are gross and drinking in a
hot tub can lead to increased dehy
dration. But more often, drinking
in a hot tub can also lead to, for
lack of a better word, results. This,
Roxy thinks, could be the begin
ning of a beautiful affair.
And finally, when all has
calmed down for the night and
people are passing out left and
right, Roxy advises readers to keep
their wits about them: a strategical
ly chosen sleeping placement
amidst the general brouhaha could
be key to future endeavors. Even if
nothing goes down during ski trip,
waking up next to a dormmate
plants a seed in one's mind that can
later blossom into the planting of
seed elsewhere. Don't question
Roxy's inception skills.
