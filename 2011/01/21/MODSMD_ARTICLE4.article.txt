# ISLAND-HOPPING
## Season continues against struggling Hawaii 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH STAFF WRITER 
After an impressive two
match sweep of then-No. 2 BYU,
the men's volleyball team is say
ing goodbye to the continental
U.S. and hitting the road for the
first time since last April. In a
rare westward trip, the men are
headed to Honolulu to face No.
13 Hawaii in a two-match series
starting tonight.
The bi-annual trip to the is
lands is Stanford's favorite trip
for more than just the sunshine
and nice beaches seven of the
team's 21 players call Hawaii
home, as do assistant coach Chris
McLachlin and technical direc

tor Daniel Rasay. The players
admit they'll be hard-pressed to
ignore the many extracurricular
opportunities a trip to Hawaii
presents.
"There will be a lot of distrac
tions," said senior Spencer
McLachlin. "We have a lot of
family and friends there. But we
are going to try our hardest to
focus on staying together as a
team and focus on volleyball.
Even though it is home for a lot
of us, it's really a business trip."
The No. 2 Cardinal (3-0, 2-0
MPSF) is starting to find its
rhythm offensively and at the
service line. That development
could spell trouble for the War
riors (0-3,0-0), who actually have

fewer native Hawaiians on the
roster than Stanford does, with
five.
In the first match against
B YU, Stanford barely eked out a
victory. The Cardinal had 21
service errors with no service
aces and hit just .292, needing
five sets and a thrilling come
back to stave off three match
points and narrowly beat the
Cougars. But in the rematch last
Saturday, the Cardinal got things
rolling much more smoothly, rid
ing junior Brad Lawson's hot
hand and Evan Barry's 48 assists
to a four-set victory. Stanford
registered seven service aces and
