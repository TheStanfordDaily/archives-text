# ISLAND-HOPPING
## Season continues against struggling Hawaii 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH STAFF WRITER 
After an impressive two
match sweep of then-No. 2 BYU,
the men's volleyball team is say
ing goodbye to the continental
U.S. and hitting the road for the
first time since last April. In a
rare westward trip, the men are
headed to Honolulu to face No.
13 Hawaii in a two-match series
starting tonight.
The bi-annual trip to the is
lands is Stanford's favorite trip
for more than just the sunshine
and nice beaches seven of the
team's 21 players call Hawaii
home, as do assistant coach Chris
McLachlin and technical direc

tor Daniel Rasay. The players
admit they'll be hard-pressed to
ignore the many extracurricular
opportunities a trip to Hawaii
presents.
"There will be a lot of distrac
tions," said senior Spencer
McLachlin. "We have a lot of
family and friends there. But we
are going to try our hardest to
focus on staying together as a
team and focus on volleyball.
Even though it is home for a lot
of us, it's really a business trip."
The No. 2 Cardinal (3-0, 2-0
MPSF) is starting to find its
rhythm offensively and at the
service line. That development
could spell trouble for the War
riors (0-3,0-0), who actually have

fewer native Hawaiians on the
roster than Stanford does, with
five.
In the first match against
B YU, Stanford barely eked out a
victory. The Cardinal had 21
service errors with no service
aces and hit just .292, needing
five sets and a thrilling come
back to stave off three match
points and narrowly beat the
Cougars. But in the rematch last
Saturday, the Cardinal got things
rolling much more smoothly, rid
ing junior Brad Lawson's hot
hand and Evan Barry's 48 assists
to a four-set victory. Stanford
registered seven service aces and

just 12 service errors to run its cur
rent winning streak to nine matches.
Lawson was named MPSF player
of the week after totaling 39 kills in
the two matches, including four
straight in the fifth set last Friday.
But he waved off the honor as a nice
recognition.
"It's certainly an honor, especial
ly when you look at some of the
other players' stats from this week
who weren't recognized," he said.
"So it is a good honor for me and the
team, but I don't think it means too
much. Individual honors are nice,
but the ultimate team honor and
our goal is to win another NCAA
national championship in May."
Hawaii is coming off a disap
pointing showing in last week's Out
rigger Hotels Invitational, where it
lost three straight matches to Ball
State, Penn State and UCLA. The
three-game losing streak to open the

season is the first for Hawaii in 17
years and dropped the Warriors
from No. 5 in the AVCA rankings
back down to No. 13.

But Hawaii is by no means a
pushover. The Warriors have a trio
of excellent players in outside hitters
Steven Hunt and Joshua Walker and
opposite Jonas Umlauft, who com
bined for 98 kills in the Outrigger
tournament. The Warriors own the
edge in the all-time series against
Stanford, 34-31, although the Cardi
nal has won the last seven matches
and the last 19 consecutive sets, dat
ing back to February 2008.
Head coach John Kosty is wary of
what he thinks is a sleeper in the tal
ented MPSF.

"Hawaii is a very offensive team,
and they run a good offense with
three great pin hitters in Hunt,
Joshua Walker and Umlauft," he
said. "They will give us all we can
handle. Umlauft just had 28 kills and
hit .477 against Penn State, so we
have to come out and look to neu
tralize their outside attack."

Two freshmen appear to be a
major part of the game plan for

Stanford. Both Eric Mochalski and
Brian Cook were heavily featured in
the first three matches of the year

Cook is third on the team with 23
kills and Mochalski is fourth with 15
and a .448 hitting percentage.
Mochalski also came up with the
winning block in the first match
against BYU.
But tonight marks the first road
match of their young college careers,
and Mochalski said he was humbled
by the experience.
"I'm looking to just take every
thing one point at a time," he said.
"This is going to be an extremely
hostile environment, and even
though it's my first time ever in
Hawaii, I'm just going to try and
avoid distractions and stay focused
on each play."
The team left yesterday morning
to acclimate to the two-hour time
difference, and the Cardinal will face
off against Hawaii in the first match
tonight at 7 p.m. at the Stan Sheriff
Center in Honolulu.

After an impressive two
match sweep of then-No. 2 BYU,
the men's volleyball team is say
ing goodbye to the continental
U.S. and hitting the road for the
first time since last April. In a
rare westward trip, the men are
headed to Honolulu to face No.
13 Hawaii in a two-match series
starting tonight.
The bi-annual trip to the is
lands is Stanford's favorite trip
for more than just the sunshine
and nice beaches seven of the
team's 21 players call Hawaii
home, as do assistant coach Chris
McLachlin and technical direc

tor Daniel Rasay. The players
admit they'll be hard-pressed to
ignore the many extracurricular
opportunities a trip to Hawaii
presents.
"There will be a lot of distrac
tions," said senior Spencer
McLachlin. "We have a lot of
family and friends there. But we
are going to try our hardest to
focus on staying together as a
team and focus on volleyball.
Even though it is home for a lot
of us, it's really a business trip."
The No. 2 Cardinal (3-0, 2-0
MPSF) is starting to find its
rhythm offensively and at the
service line. That development
could spell trouble for the War
riors (0-3,0-0), who actually have

fewer native Hawaiians on the
roster than Stanford does, with
five.
In the first match against
B YU, Stanford barely eked out a
victory. The Cardinal had 21
service errors with no service
aces and hit just .292, needing
five sets and a thrilling come
back to stave off three match
points and narrowly beat the
Cougars. But in the rematch last
Saturday, the Cardinal got things
rolling much more smoothly, rid
ing junior Brad Lawson's hot
hand and Evan Barry's 48 assists
to a four-set victory. Stanford
registered seven service aces and

just 12 service errors to run its cur
rent winning streak to nine matches.
Lawson was named MPSF player
of the week after totaling 39 kills in
the two matches, including four
straight in the fifth set last Friday.
But he waved off the honor as a nice
recognition.
"It's certainly an honor, especial
ly when you look at some of the
other players' stats from this week
who weren't recognized," he said.
"So it is a good honor for me and the
team, but I don't think it means too
much. Individual honors are nice,
but the ultimate team honor and
our goal is to win another NCAA
national championship in May."
Hawaii is coming off a disap
pointing showing in last week's Out
rigger Hotels Invitational, where it
lost three straight matches to Ball
State, Penn State and UCLA. The
three-game losing streak to open the

season is the first for Hawaii in 17
years and dropped the Warriors
from No. 5 in the AVCA rankings
back down to No. 13.

But Hawaii is by no means a
pushover. The Warriors have a trio
of excellent players in outside hitters
Steven Hunt and Joshua Walker and
opposite Jonas Umlauft, who com
bined for 98 kills in the Outrigger
tournament. The Warriors own the
edge in the all-time series against
Stanford, 34-31, although the Cardi
nal has won the last seven matches
and the last 19 consecutive sets, dat
ing back to February 2008.
Head coach John Kosty is wary of
what he thinks is a sleeper in the tal
ented MPSF.

"Hawaii is a very offensive team,
and they run a good offense with
three great pin hitters in Hunt,
Joshua Walker and Umlauft," he
said. "They will give us all we can
handle. Umlauft just had 28 kills and
hit .477 against Penn State, so we
have to come out and look to neu
tralize their outside attack."

Two freshmen appear to be a
major part of the game plan for

Stanford. Both Eric Mochalski and
Brian Cook were heavily featured in
the first three matches of the year

Cook is third on the team with 23
kills and Mochalski is fourth with 15
and a .448 hitting percentage.
Mochalski also came up with the
winning block in the first match
against BYU.
But tonight marks the first road
match of their young college careers,
and Mochalski said he was humbled
by the experience.
"I'm looking to just take every
thing one point at a time," he said.
"This is going to be an extremely
hostile environment, and even
though it's my first time ever in
Hawaii, I'm just going to try and
avoid distractions and stay focused
on each play."
The team left yesterday morning
to acclimate to the two-hour time
difference, and the Cardinal will face
off against Hawaii in the first match
tonight at 7 p.m. at the Stan Sheriff
Center in Honolulu.
