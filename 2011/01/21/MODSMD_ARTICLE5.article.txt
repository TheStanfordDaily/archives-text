## Card takes tough loss at USC Trojans humble Stanford in lopsided defeat 
### LAUREN TAYLOR STAFF WRITER 
In the first portion of its southern Califor
nia road trip last night, the Stanford men's
basketball team suffered one of the most
brutal losses it has experienced in the past
several seasons. With a final score of 65-42,
the Cardinal scored an uncharacteristically
low number of points and fell to USC (11-8,
3-3 Pac-10).
Stanford (10-7,3-3) was previously fourth
in the Pac-10 standings, coming off a home
split with the Washington schools that includ
ed one of its biggest victories in the past few
years, coming over the then-No. 17 Huskies,
along with a close 61-58 loss to Washington
State.
The Trojans' win over the Cardinal marks
the end of a losing streak. After being swept
by both Oregon teams and losing three of
their last five games, the Trojans were previ
ously ranked sixth in the preseason media
poll and have averaged 68.1 points per game.
Though the team has collected several clutch
wins against national powerhouses such as
Texas and Tennessee, USC has remained at
the middle of the conference because of
overall inconsistency.
Last night, however, the team's offense
delivered, as junior forward Nikola Vucevic
racked 20 points and nine rebounds for the
Trojans and redshirt senior forward Alex
Stepheson completed his seventh double
double of the year with 10 points and 11 re
bounds.
Stanford was not able to match USC's of
fense, as the Card scored went only 14-for-63
