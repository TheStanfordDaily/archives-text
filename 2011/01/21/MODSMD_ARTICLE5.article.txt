## Card takes tough loss at USC Trojans humble Stanford in lopsided defeat 
### LAUREN TAYLOR STAFF WRITER 
In the first portion of its southern Califor
nia road trip last night, the Stanford men's
basketball team suffered one of the most
brutal losses it has experienced in the past
several seasons. With a final score of 65-42,
the Cardinal scored an uncharacteristically
low number of points and fell to USC (11-8,
3-3 Pac-10).
Stanford (10-7,3-3) was previously fourth
in the Pac-10 standings, coming off a home
split with the Washington schools that includ
ed one of its biggest victories in the past few
years, coming over the then-No. 17 Huskies,
along with a close 61-58 loss to Washington
State.
The Trojans' win over the Cardinal marks
the end of a losing streak. After being swept
by both Oregon teams and losing three of
their last five games, the Trojans were previ
ously ranked sixth in the preseason media
poll and have averaged 68.1 points per game.
Though the team has collected several clutch
wins against national powerhouses such as
Texas and Tennessee, USC has remained at
the middle of the conference because of
overall inconsistency.
Last night, however, the team's offense
delivered, as junior forward Nikola Vucevic
racked 20 points and nine rebounds for the
Trojans and redshirt senior forward Alex
Stepheson completed his seventh double
double of the year with 10 points and 11 re
bounds.
Stanford was not able to match USC's of
fense, as the Card scored went only 14-for-63
from the field while allowing the Trojans
to shoot 55.6 percent. Freshman guard
Anthony Brown was Stanford's leading
scorer, posting nine points for the Cardi
nal and earning a significant amount of
playtime alongside several classmates,
such as forward Dwight Powell.
Head coach Johnny Dawkins has
high expectations for his freshman class,
particularly Powell, whom he said is
"working hard and getting better."
"I think he's getting more comfort
able." Dawkins said of Powell. "He's
young and trying to feel his way through
Pac-10 play, but every game he's getting
more active and rebounding for us more
consistently."
Stanford will continue to rely on
Powell, along with juniors Josh Owens
and Jarrett Mann, as the team continues
through the conference season tomor
row against UCLA. The Bruins (12-6,4-
2) have been one of the Pac-10's most
consistent teams of late, winning nine of
their last 11 games and narrowly defeat
ing Cal last night, 86-84.
Like Stanford, UCLA pulled off a
huge win over a top-20 team, defeating
then-No. 16 BYU in mid-December, 86-
79. Averaging a high 71.3 points per
game, the team has five different players
who regularly produce double-digit fig
ures in scoring.

Reeves Nelson and Tyler Honeycutt
average more than 13 points and nearly
eight rebounds per game apiece, and
Stanford will have to recover its domi
nant defense from earlier in the season
in order to stop this high-scoring duo.
Despite its past two losses, defense
remains the strongest aspect of the Car
dinal's game. It will have to pick up the
slack on the offensive end, though, to
earn a win against the Bruins, especially
since five years have passed since Stan
ford won a road game over either of the
southern California schools.

In fact, the Card has struggled in
most road games thus far, and the young
team hopes to turn this around tomor
row by recovering its early-season suc
cess, particularly by attacking the boards
and exploding on the offensive end.
Tipoff is at 11 a.m. at Pauley Pavilion
in Los Angeles.

GAME NOTES: After a blowout defeat at the hands
of USC last night 65-42, the Cardinal will try to
get back on track against the Bruins. UCLA has
bounced back from two losses to open Pac-10
play and now sits at third in the standings, a
game ahead of Stanford.
