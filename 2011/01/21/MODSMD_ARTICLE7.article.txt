## UNIVERSITY Survey says students want more BOSP 
### KURT CHIRBAS STAFF WRITER 
At Thursday's Faculty Senate meeting,
ASSU Undergraduate Senate representative
Deepa Kannappan 'l3 gave a presentation con
cerning student opinions on academic advising
and the potential expansion of the Bing Over
seas Study Program (BOSP) to the Middle
East.

In a survey taken by 332 undergrads, Kan
nappan found that the majority of Stanford
students ranked their undergraduate academ
ic advising experience as average, with more
students ranking it as below average than
above.

The survey also asked where students felt
they received the most helpful advising.
Friends, online resources and residential staff
all topped formal sources of advising like aca
demic directors and pre-major and major ad
visers.

"Considering the caliber of majors that
Stanford offers the highly ranked, very in
terdisciplinary, very unique majors offered
here this number should be much higher,"
Kannappan said. "I wanted to look into why

students were not satisfied with their academic
advising experience."

Kannappan said she decided to repeat the
survey when she realized that each individual
class had a different academic advising experi
ence, with Undergraduate Advising and Re
search (UAR) slightly shifting its policies each
year.
The new survey, which asked for the partici
pants' class years, was taken by 150 undergrad
uates, and showed that the number of students
who found academic directors and pre-major
advisers helpful doubled between those re
spondents from the Class of 2014 and other un
dergraduates.
"The difference here was a change on
UAR's behalf," Kannappan said.
Starting with the Class of 2014, undergradu
ates are now required to meet with their pre
major adviser before they can enroll in classes
each quarter.
Both Provost John Etchemendy Ph.D. 'B2
and Vice Provost for Undergraduate Educa
tion Harry Elam Jr. said they were pleased with
the results of the second survey.
"We've seen the results of these kinds of sur
veys from other universities as well, and advis

ing is just across the board ranked the thing stu
dents are least satisfied with at every universi
ty," Etchemendy said. "But that doesn't mean
that we shouldn't try to improve it... and
[these numbers] are an improvement over
what we saw two years ago when we were even
worse."

Kannappan then talked about student opin
ions regarding a potential expansion of BOSP.
In a survey taken by 300 students, 200 said
they would be interested in a Middle Eastern
study-abroad program. The top four locations
students said they were interested in were
Dubai, Israel, Egypt and Jordan.

Elam said the new director of overseas stud
ies, professor Robert Sinclair, has also ex
pressed interest in establishing study-abroad
programs at other non-European campuses,
specifically in the Middle East.
"How we would do that is a major ques
tion," Elam said, "but it's good to see there's
student interest."

In addition to Kannappan's presentation,
ASSU President Angelina Cardona 'll spoke
about sexual misconduct on campus.
Last October, the Partnership to End Vio
lence Against Women sent out a survey regard

ing this issue, and by December, it had collect
ed more than 4,000 unique responses from
around campus.
The data is currently being complied before
aggregate results are released.
But Cardona said that in professor Anne
Murray's class, "Critical Issues in Internation
al Women's Health," last quarter, 50 percent of
students reported in a survey that they had
known someone at Stanford who had experi
enced sexual misconduct or relationship
abuse.

She said ASSU has been having conversa
tions with administrators, specifically with Vice
Provost of Student Affairs Greg Boardman,
about the issue, and will be putting on campus
wide training workshops this quarter in part
nership with the Center for Relationship
Abuse Awareness.

"This is not unique to Stanford," Cardona
said. "This is happening all across the board at
every campus,but I think as Stanford is a leader
in everything else, we have an opportunity to be
a leader in this issue, and in this movement, as
well."
