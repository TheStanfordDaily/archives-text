## Biotech video game goes live Stanford professor uses real organisms in new video games 
### ELLORA ISRANI STAFF WRITER 
A Stanford professor of bioengineering has de
veloped the first video game that allows players to
influence the actions of live microorganisms in
real time as they interact with a computer.
Bioengineering professor Ingmar Riedel-
Kruse, who conceptualized the game, says he cre
ated it to explore the concept of educating peo
ple about microorganisms and biology by en
abling "lay people to interact with biology and
microscopic processes and better understand
how these work."
To fully accomplish this goal, Riedel-Kruse
created not one but eight different games, which
can be classified into one of three categories
based on the type of organisms they work with.
One of these "biotic games" uses single-celled
organisms, called paramecia, and allows partici
pants to use a video game controller to "move"
these microorganisms on the screen. By manipu-

Players can manipulate the movement of single-celled microorganisms, called paramecia, by
changing the polarity of the electrical field in the fluid chamber (center of black stand).
