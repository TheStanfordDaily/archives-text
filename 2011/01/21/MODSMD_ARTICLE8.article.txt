## Biotech video game goes live Stanford professor uses real organisms in new video games 
### ELLORA ISRANI STAFF WRITER 
A Stanford professor of bioengineering has de
veloped the first video game that allows players to
influence the actions of live microorganisms in
real time as they interact with a computer.
Bioengineering professor Ingmar Riedel-
Kruse, who conceptualized the game, says he cre
ated it to explore the concept of educating peo
ple about microorganisms and biology by en
abling "lay people to interact with biology and
microscopic processes and better understand
how these work."
To fully accomplish this goal, Riedel-Kruse
created not one but eight different games, which
can be classified into one of three categories
based on the type of organisms they work with.
One of these "biotic games" uses single-celled
organisms, called paramecia, and allows partici
pants to use a video game controller to "move"
these microorganisms on the screen. By manipu-

Players can manipulate the movement of single-celled microorganisms, called paramecia, by
changing the polarity of the electrical field in the fluid chamber (center of black stand).
lating a mild electric field around
the organism, players can influence
its movement in a particular direc
tion.

While the computer base is
purely virtual, the organisms are
real. The game involving paramecia
has five different versions for play
ers to choose from including
PAC-mecium, which was created in
the image of Pacman, and abiotic
pinball game called POND PONG.
The other two categories in
volve molecules and yeast cells.
Riedel-Kruse says the idea for
the current design, which took
about a year to develop, came in
2009 when he was a researcher at
Caltech. When he read on the Inter
net about the history of video
games and realized that their ad
vent was propelled by the rising
computer industry, he thought
about doing the same with the
biotech industry developing today.
"If we could use computer tech
nology to create games, then why
aren't we using biotech to create
games?" he said. "It was just an ini
tial question."
Furthermore, the games can col
lect data as they are played. There
fore, they essentially allow ordinary
individuals to serve the purpose of
research assistants. Instead of pay
ing an intern to search for data,
Riedel-Kruse hopes to motivate

widespread participation with the
enjoyable gaming environment.
The strategy presents certain chal
lenges, however.
"Since the games are [designed
as] experiments, in order to enable
someone to play, we have to give ac
cess to the experiments," Riedel-
Kruse said.
Such difficulties stem from the
fact that some of the games require
an expensive laboratory apparatus
known as a PCR machine. Howev
er, Riedel-Kruse hopes to over
come this challenge with a grant
from the National Science Founda
tion that would allow the game to
be played online using remote ac
cess.

He also hopes to put the games
in the schools and museums within
a year to give way to wider con
sumption.

"Definitely we hope that we
could make it available to the pub
lic in the end," Riedel-Kruse said.
"The next step is basically collabo
ration with Daniel Schwartz of the
School of Education to do user
studies with schoolchildren to as
sess educational potential and how
to design games to make them
more attractive to students."

In the end, Riedel-Kruse's goals
are not commercial; he does not
plan on founding a company. In
stead, further research will concen
trate on identifying what users find
attractive in order to allow broader
dissemination of the game.
