## 5-SURE set to expand service 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€” Kabir Sawhney 
5-SURE is expanding its service
to run from 9 p.m. to 1:45 a.m. seven
nights a week effective on Monday,
the service announced yesterday.
Previously, 5-SURE service started
at 10 p.m. every night.
5-SURE provides free rides to
Stanford students at night, helping
ensure they have safe and reliable
transportation back to their housing
after dark. The change comes in re
sponse to a spate of suspected crimi
nal activity on campus, including sev
eral recent assaults and a "hot
prowl" threat.
5-SURE also said it is undergoing
a name change. Previously, the
acronym stood for "Students United
for Rape Elimination." Now stands
for "Students United for Risk Elimi
nation."

"The change was made due to a
shift in the mission of the SURE pro
gram over the years," the organiza
tion said in a statement. "All mem
bers of the Stanford community use
the service in order to safely get
across campus when they feel they
may be at risk. Our mission has
grown to eliminate these risks in
what ways we can."
5-SURE rides can be arranged by
calling 650-725-SURE during oper
ating hours, or at 5-sure.stanford.
