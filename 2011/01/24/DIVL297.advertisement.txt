You don't build a 200-year history of excellence in financial services
without learning a few things. Like how to recognize and celebrate
colleagues with exceptional qualities. And the importance of training
and developing them throughout their careers. We are proud to welcome
the eight Stanford students who will be joining us full-time this summer.
Congratulations to them on all their success.
