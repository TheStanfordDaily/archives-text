# LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
## Stop means stop 
### 
Dear Editor,
Why don't smart Stanford stu
dents wear bike helmets, have bike
lights and reflectors at night, or
obey the traffic laws?
I was almost hit several times in
the past few weeks since daylight
started fading at 5:30 p.m. I decided
to do an informal count on Thurs
day night at 6:30 p.m. On my way
from Meyer Library, along Galvez
Mall and Galvez Street to the end of
the C-lot near the stadium, I en
countered about 50 bikers. Only six
had both headlights/reflectors and
were wearing a bike helmet (12 per

cent), three wore a helmet but had
no lights (6 percent), four had lights
but no helmet (8 percent) and the
rest had neither (74 percent).
That's an accident waiting to
happen and can result in injury, per
manent disability or death.
Sharing the sidewalk with pedes
trians is another problem. They
speed, weaving in and out among
people walking, not paying atten
tion because they are using commu
nications devices or are otherwise
distracted.
Obey the law. A stop sign means
stop, especially at a pedestrian cross
walk when someone is in the cross
walk!
Be safety-conscious.
