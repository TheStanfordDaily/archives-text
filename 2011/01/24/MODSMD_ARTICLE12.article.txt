# STETHOSCOPES, COMPILERS AND HEMINGWAY
## The 						Aging Myth 
### Aaditya Shidham 
There is this belief that death is
part of life. This is what we say
in funerals and obituaries, over
tear-streaked faces in rooms with
mahogany wallpaper. And we have
said it for a long time now. Our an
cestors have made up all kinds of sto
ries where the bad guy is hard to kill
and somehow is blessed with eternal
life. Some cultures have focused on
the positive by honoring the elder
and somehow conflating the pres
ence of wrinkles with wisdom.
In the modern era, such a narra
tive continues with paperback and
silver screen science fiction
dystopias that tell of the horrors of a
society that learned to live forever.
Recent meetings of the president's
commission on bioethics reveal a
measured stance against the notion
of "age retardation" (the federal
term for such a phenomenon) for the
society and the individual.
If this story is so engrained in us,
then where did the notion of the
Fountain of Youth come from? Why
is it so persistent in a place that
seems to have so well accepted the
inevitability of death?
Here's my theory: we haven't real
ly surrendered to death. We can't be
lieve that this life is going to come to
an end. It seemed that all of us once
assumed eternal life in childhood,
then longed for it, then used religion

or ignorance or something to substi
tute for it. But that initial wellspring
of hope remains in us somehow.
Such a quest for the Fountain of
Youth has actually materialized in
recent years all over the world: in the
Bay Area, in NYC, in the UK. There
is a whole network of controversial
professors, scientists and researchers
that believe that living forever is a vi
able possibility. They come from the
SENS foundation, Halcyon Molecu
lar, from labs in the Albert Einstein
School of Medicine and the Wake
Forest Institute for Regenerative
Medicine, from nondescript build
ings mere miles from this campus.
There is so much controversy, so
many philosophical implications
emerging from this idea, so many
minds involved and yet they are
just barely piquing the interest of the
media. Why? Perhaps they haven't
done enough haven't had enough
impact on American society. Yet the
days of the development of the nu
clear bomb were just as heady. De
spite that era's necessary culture of
secrecy, everyone was immensely in
terested long before a single test
bomb was deployed.
But boy, they are lucky that the
rest of the world doesn't care for
whatever reason. In this way, minds
can keep on working, getting closer
to a solution before the govern

ments of the world get suspicious
and nervous about its profound im
plications.
I admire these people for daring
to dream beyond the horizon of
mainstream biology and engineer
ing. I don't know if this vast network
will succeed. It may possibly fail. But
Stanford needs to put itself onto this
map in either case. This university
has a varied history in risk and inno
vation. It has nothing to lose and
everything to gain with such an in
vestment in human immortality.
Why, you ask, is this so? Can't
Stanford lose a lot of respect for
funding such an intrinsically selfish
thing for humanity? In the midst of
poverty and human health and dis
ease, funding a cause like this seems
frivolous, right? No. Funding efforts
at human immortality are funda
mentally a good thing because it
gives us the option to rewrite our bi
ological destiny. Not having such a
therapy at hand chains us to our bio
logical degradation. The latter is
clearly a better society than the for
mer because it consists of freer peo

pie: those in charge of their own
mortality. We have every obligation
to give our future society that pow
erful and profound a liberty.

Why, you ask, is a freer society a
better one? The answer lies in our
history: gains in liberty have a pos
itive precedent in the human story.
Agriculture freed us from the
chains of a hunter-gatherer socie
ty; the written and spoken word
freed us from imprecise communi
cation; the advent of flight freed us
from our location. Human empiri

cism has resulted in tools like these
tools that have allowed us to re
script all kinds of once-fated ends.
Let us hope upon this irony: that
a university founded on death may
eventually destroy mortality.

Aging is God's ultimate conspiracy
theory. If you don't think so, let me
know at cishidham@stanford.edu.
