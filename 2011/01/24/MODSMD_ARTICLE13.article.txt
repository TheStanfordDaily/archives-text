## Time to Stop the Alcohol Nonsense 
### Clifford Nass 
r â–  lhis weekend, a Stanford un
dergraduate was brought to
A the emergency room at Stan
ford Hospital with a blood-alcohol
level (BAC) of .40. There is evi
dence that "approximately 50 per
cent of all people with a BAC of .40
or higher will die." Happily, be
cause the coin flip landed the right
way, the student survived.
While the Stanford community
did not have to bury this student,
this "coin flip" death should lead to
the burial of three extremely de
structive beliefs about alcohol.
Destructive belief 1: "The Stan
ford alcohol policy is working be
cause no one has died in X years."
The recent coin-flip death ends this
claim. We must move past this su
perior attitude that has made the

alcohol problem on campus more
and more severe and has endan
gered the physical and emotional
health of an enormous number of
students.
Destructive belief 2: "Each stu
dent is responsible for her or his
own alcohol consumption." While
each individual must be responsi
ble for his or her own behavior, that
view is dangerously simplistic.
Here is what has happened in virtu
ally every single alcohol incident
(more than 25) that I have encoun
tered on campus (including the
coin-flip death):
A student or students other
than the person who lands in the
hospital knowingly provides a dan
gerous amount of alcohol to the
student who becomes intoxicated.

Are those students who provided
the alcohol not responsible and not
guilty of a Fundamental Standard
violation?
Multiple students watch the
student drinking extremely large
quantities of alcohol over a short
period of time and do not get a staff
member (who is always in the dorm
or minutes away on speed-dial), the
RF or any other knowledgeable
person. Are those students who
watched and did nothing not re
sponsible and not guilty of a Fun
damental Standard violation?
Students carry the extreme
ly ill student back to his dorm and
do not tell a staff member, the RF
or any other knowledgeable per-
