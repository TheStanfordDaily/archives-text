## Time to Stop the Alcohol Nonsense 
### Clifford Nass 
r â–  lhis weekend, a Stanford un
dergraduate was brought to
A the emergency room at Stan
ford Hospital with a blood-alcohol
level (BAC) of .40. There is evi
dence that "approximately 50 per
cent of all people with a BAC of .40
or higher will die." Happily, be
cause the coin flip landed the right
way, the student survived.
While the Stanford community
did not have to bury this student,
this "coin flip" death should lead to
the burial of three extremely de
structive beliefs about alcohol.
Destructive belief 1: "The Stan
ford alcohol policy is working be
cause no one has died in X years."
The recent coin-flip death ends this
claim. We must move past this su
perior attitude that has made the

alcohol problem on campus more
and more severe and has endan
gered the physical and emotional
health of an enormous number of
students.
Destructive belief 2: "Each stu
dent is responsible for her or his
own alcohol consumption." While
each individual must be responsi
ble for his or her own behavior, that
view is dangerously simplistic.
Here is what has happened in virtu
ally every single alcohol incident
(more than 25) that I have encoun
tered on campus (including the
coin-flip death):
A student or students other
than the person who lands in the
hospital knowingly provides a dan
gerous amount of alcohol to the
student who becomes intoxicated.

Are those students who provided
the alcohol not responsible and not
guilty of a Fundamental Standard
violation?
Multiple students watch the
student drinking extremely large
quantities of alcohol over a short
period of time and do not get a staff
member (who is always in the dorm
or minutes away on speed-dial), the
RF or any other knowledgeable
person. Are those students who
watched and did nothing not re
sponsible and not guilty of a Fun
damental Standard violation?
Students carry the extreme
ly ill student back to his dorm and
do not tell a staff member, the RF
or any other knowledgeable per-
son. Are those students who carry
a student not responsible and not
guilty of a Fundamental Standard
violation?
Sometimes, one or more
students "trick" or at least urge a
student to drink to a level that
causes risk up to a 50 percent
chance of death. Are those stu
dents who urge the drinker not re
sponsible and not guilty of a Fun
damental Standard violation?
Destructive belief 3: "It is hard
to tell if someone is dangerously
drunk." There is truth here, but
that is beside the point. You don't
have to wait for an outcome to
know it has occurred. For example,
you see a student writing a paper
by copying out of a book, changing
a word here or there. The student
gives you the paper and says, "Is
this plagiarism?" It would be face
tious to say, "Gee, I'm not an ex
pert on plagiarism and it would be
impossible for me to assess that."
The correct answer is: "Given that
you copied out of the book, I don't
need to read the paper: you were
plagiarizing." Students do not
drink alone and then collapse in
the street, forcing observers to de
cide whether they are sleeping,
epileptic or in alcohol danger.
Every alcohol case I have encoun
tered has unfolded with other stu
dents around during the drinking.
Under these circumstances, you do
not need a medical degree to de
tect a student's dangerous behav
ior with alcohol.
Stanford students' views of al
cohol, including students who do
not drink, are self-serving, lack per
sonal or intellectual integrity and
violate the Fundamental Standard.
Almost no Stanford student will be
sent to the hospital; almost all Stan
ford students will be knowingly
watching someone who is likely to
be sent to the hospital. It is time to
stop the self-congratulatory non
sense about how successfully our
undergraduates deal with alcohol.
