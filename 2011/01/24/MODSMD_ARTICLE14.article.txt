# Nothing 'sophist' about ROTC debate
## 
### 
Dear Editor,
SamWindley L.L.M.'ll wrote in
this space about the Jan. 11 ROTC
forum, claiming that ROTC sup
porters had offered little but "dis
gusting" "sophistry" (Letters to the
editor, Jan. 18). Mr. Windley's ac
count does a disservice to both the
participants and to the Stanford

community, which deserves a fuller
record of the proceedings.
As expressed at the event, the
primary anti-ROTC position is sim
ple: even after the repeal of "don't
ask, don't tell," the military still
does not accept transgendered per
sons. That type of exclusion is dis
crimination. Discrimination vio
lates Stanford policy. Ordinary em
ployers who discriminate in that
way are barred from campus.
Therefore, both because we will not
participate in discrimination and
because we wish a change in the
policy, we should not devote Uni
versity resources to ROTC or per
mit the program on campus.
That's fair, as far as it goes, but it
makes two critical assumptions
with which many disagree.
First, the military is not an ordi
nary employer. Our ties to such em
ployers extend no further than to
their recruiting presences on our
campus and, perhaps, to employ
ment statistics in our admissions

brochures. That's not the case here.
Our tax dollars train and equip our
warriors, and our elected represen
tatives send them into battle. In the
eyes of the world, PFC Lynndie
England was more than an individ
ual she was an American soldier
and an agent of U.S. foreign policy.
Like it or not, the actions of our
armed men and women are, and will
remain, our actions, and a boycott
would neither sever our ties with
nor end our support for the Ameri
can military.

Further, it's hard to believe that
a boycott is the most effective path
to equality in the military. By keep
ing ROTC off-campus, we turn
down opportunities to meet and de
bate military officers, to introduce
the military to the transgendered
(and vice versa), and to earn the
credibility that comes from having
served ourselves. Does anyone be
lieve that a military with more Stan
ford graduates as flag officers
would be less likely to welcome

anyone of sound mind and body
who wished to serve?
If we short-sightedly banish
ROTC, we take ourselves out of the
fight. The University's founders be
lieved that "[t]he public at large,
and not alone the comparatively
few students who can attend the
University, are the chief and ulti
mate beneficiaries of the [Universi
ty] foundation." Where would they
fall on the choice between making a
statement and making a difference?
We are confronted with incom
patible moral goals, necessitating a
difficult choice. How great is the in
justice done by the policy against
transgendered recruits, and how
great an injustice would we commit
if, in service to country, to civic dis
course and, possibly, to equality, we
allowed them on campus anyway?
Reasonable people disagree on the
right answer. But there's nothing
"sophist" about the debate.
