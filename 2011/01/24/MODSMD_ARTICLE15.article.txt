## CARDINAL CRUSHES TROJANS Stanford sits alone atop Pac-10 standings 
### NATE ADAMS DESK EDITOR 
It might be a little early to give Stanford the
national trophy, but that didn't stop USC head
coach Michael Cooper from making a firm pre
diction following his team's 95-51 loss to No. 4
Stanford women's basketball on Saturday after
noon.
"I think what you're looking at here is the
next NCAA champion," Cooper said. ''We
played some of the best, and this is the best team
we've played this year."
The lopsided victory marks the 10th consecu
tive win for Stanford (16-2, 7-0 Pac-10), which
took sole possession of the Pac-10 lead after
trouncing No. 8 UCLA 64-38 on Thursday night.
Senior guard Jeanette Pohlen led her team
past USC (12-6,4-3) on Saturday with 21 points
and 12 assists, helping Stanford shoot 52 percent
overall and reach its highest point total of the
conference season. Senior forward Kayla Peder
sen added 16 points of her own, while sisters
Nnemkadi and Chiney Ogwumike each put up
14.
After three straight Final Four appearances
and no title to show for them, Stanford head
coach Tara VanDerveer knows she can't take
anything for granted.
"I really want to play a more open game. This
year with people, 'Keep shooting until I strangle
you' is my motto," she quipped. "We want to
score more and run more."
Those are high standards coming from a
coach whose team put up 10 three-pointers, 54
rebounds and 27 assists against a USC squad
that had just one conference loss entering the
weekend.
But Stanford was less than stellar in the open
ing minutes. The Cardinal traded baskets with
the light-footed Trojan offense early on, missing
a few three-point attempts while letting USC
drive into the paint and crash the glass. Almost
four minutes in, USC and Stanford each had
three rebounds and the Trojans were ahead in
the scoring column, 8-7.
"After recognizing they're getting a few
boards, we had to counteract that and be more
aggressive, and just make sure we take care of
the ball," Chiney Ogwumike said. "And to take
care of the ball, we had to have the ball."

As has often been the case for Stanford, the
early back-and-forth soon gave way to an offen
sive blitz. A Pedersen layup sparked an offensive
explosion for the Cardinal about four minutes
in, as the co-captain combined with Pohlen and
Chiney Ogwumike to jolt Stanford into a 17-2
run that put it up 24-10 at the game's first media
timeout. Just afterwards, Pedersen sunk an em
phatic nothing-but-net three from the wing that

gave her 11 total points less than 10 minutes into
the game.
Junior guard Lindy La√üocque, now a usual
member of Stanford's versatile starting lineup,
added to the onslaught with her own pair of
crowd-electrifying threes in the half, including
one from a full yard beyond the top of the key.
