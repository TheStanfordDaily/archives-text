# TOUGH TIMES IN SOCAL
## Card falls to UCLA, ending disappointing L.A. trip 
### CAROLINE CASELLI DESK EDITOR 
Struggles away from home continue to plague the
young Stanford men's basketball team, which
dropped a 68-57 decision to UCLA (13-6,5-2 Pac-10)
on Saturday to conclude a dismal Los Angeles road
trip. After a promising start to the conference season,
including an upset over then-No. 17 Washington, the
Card (10-8,3-4) has dropped three straight games to
fall into the bottom half of the Pac-10 standings.
Looking to bounce back after a disheartening 23-
point loss to USC on Thursday night, the Cardinal
appeared to be a different squad at the outset of Sat
urday morning's matchup, jumping out to an early 8-
0 lead over the Bruins. Stanford's offense continued
to dominate, with contributions from redshirt junior
Josh Owens and junior guards Jarrett Mann and Je
remy Green extending the Cardinal's lead to 22-8
with 10:28 remaining in the half.
But when all appeared to be in the Card's favor,
the Bruins came alive on both ends of the court, and
Stanford's shooting took a turn for the worse. The
Cardinal which made eight of its first 15 shot at
tempts would go 2-for-18 for the remainder of the
half, with its five points coming off a layup from
Mann and a three-pointer from freshman forward
Anthony Brown. UCLA sophomore forward Tyler
Honeycutt and junior guard Malcolm Lee would
combine for 20 first-period points to help the Bruins
claw their way to a mere one-point deficit, with a
score of 27-26 heading into halftime.
"I knew it was going to be a fight we knew that
they would not let up," Owens said. "They respond
ed well to our run."

UCLA took its first lead of the day just under
three minutes into the second half, and the Bruins
would not trail for the remainder of the game. The
Bruins outscored the Card 42-30 in the half, led by
Lee and junior guard Lazeric Jones, who together in
the second half went 14-15 from the line and scored
26 points. On the defensive end, UCLA forced five

Stanford turnovers in the second period, but commit
ted only one.
"They played great defense," said Stanford head
coach Johnny Dawkins. "I've seen the improvement
on their defense, from this year to last year."
"We couldn't keep the execution together like we
had in the first half," Owens added. "In the second
half, we had some defensive let-ups, as Lee started
finishing his shots and Honeycutt did as well. They
really played well, and to their strengths."
Stanford's shooting has been lackluster in its past
few games the Card shot just 30.8 percent from
