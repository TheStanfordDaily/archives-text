# MEN'S VOLLEYBALL
## Hawaii nailbiter 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH STAFF WRITER 
Two nights after having its nine-match
winning streak broken, the No. 2 Stan
ford men's volleyball team battled back
against No. 13 Hawaii (1-4,1-IMPSF) for
a grueling 3-2 win to earn a series split in
Honolulu.
The Cardinal (4-1,3-1) was in danger
of losing two consecutive matches for the
first time since last January after getting
swept in front of a raucous Warrior crowd
of 3,551 on Friday.
However, senior outside hitter and
Hawaii native Spencer McLachlin, one
of seven Hawaii natives on Stanford's
roster, put on an offensive show in the
second match, and freshman Eric
Mochalski had the two biggest kills of his
young career to avoid a sweep and keep
Stanford near the top of the Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation (MPSF).
McLachlin tallied a career-high 29 kills
Sunday while hitting .375 in the win,
which was a close battle from start to fin
ish.
Stanford began Sunday's matchup
better than Friday's, winning the first set,
25-21, but Hawaii rallied behind another
big home crowd and dominated the sec
ond set, 25-17, with another top-notch
performance from outside hitter Jonas
Umlauft. Last year's MPSF newcomer of
the year, the 6-foot-9 sophomore had 29
kills on the night, including seven in the
second set. It looked like Umlauft might
swing the momentum back to Hawaii.
But the third set belonged to the Car
dinal, who stood out early and held on
despite plenty of attack errors on both
sides. Stanford hit .257 while Hawaii hit
just .129, well below its average of .300 for
the match.
Up two games to one in the fourth set,
Stanford came out strong and held a slim
lead midway through the set. But Hawaii
again rallied and took a 21-19 lead on a
kill by Steven Hunt. Stanford head coach
John Kosty called a timeout and the Car-
dinal regrouped to tie the score at
23. After Stanford couldn't capital
ize on match point at 24-23, the set
went back and forth for several
points. Hawaii staved off four more
match points and had six set points
of its own, but it wasn't until Nejc
Zemljak's service ace that the War
riors forced a fifth and final set with
a 36-34 win.
The Warriors carried most of the
momentum in the fifth set, flying past
Stanford to a 5-1 lead in the final set
to 15. But another timeout by Kosty

settled the Cardinal. Stanford's
blocking slowed Hawaii's attack, and
a key team block by McLachlin and
junior blocker Gus Ellis brought
Hawaii's lead to 13-12.
A kill by Hawaii's Joshua Walk
er gave the Warriors match point at
14-13, but a service error squared
everything at 14. Hunt had another
kill to give Hawaii yet another
match point at 15-14, but Stanford
junior outside hitter Brad Law
son's kill off junior setter Evan
Barry's 62nd assist of the night tied
the match at 15.
It was then that Mochalski took
over in the spotlight, earning a point
off a Hawaii overpass to make it 16-
15, and then spiking a pass by Ellis
for his seventh kill of the night a

match winner.
Several of the team's Hawaii na
tives had big matches, led by
McLachlin and junior libero Erik
Shoji, who had 16 digs. The match
lasted two hours and 54 minutes, the
team's longest of the year by over
half an hour.
It took Hawaii just an hour and
45 minutes to dispatch a jet-lagged
Cardinal in the opener on Friday,
when Stanford hit just .200 as a team
and held the lead only twice in the 3-
0 loss.
Stanford will hit the road again
to continue league play this Friday
against Cal State Northridge.
