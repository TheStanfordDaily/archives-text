# MEN'S VOLLEYBALL
## Hawaii nailbiter 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH STAFF WRITER 
Two nights after having its nine-match
winning streak broken, the No. 2 Stan
ford men's volleyball team battled back
against No. 13 Hawaii (1-4,1-IMPSF) for
a grueling 3-2 win to earn a series split in

the year, the 6-foot-9 sophomore had 29
kills on the night, including seven in the
second set. It looked like Umlauft might
swing the momentum back to Hawaii.
But the third set belonged to the Car
dinal, who stood out early and held on
despite plenty of attack errors on both
sides. Stanford hit .257 while Hawaii hit
just .129, well below its average of .300 for
the match.
Up two games to one in the fourth set,
Stanford came out strong and held a slim
lead midway through the set. But Hawaii
again rallied and took a 21-19 lead on a
kill by Steven Hunt. Stanford head coach
John Kosty called a timeout and the Car-
