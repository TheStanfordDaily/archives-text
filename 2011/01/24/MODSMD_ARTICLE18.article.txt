# Predictions

### Daniel Bohm On My Mind 
Am I the only person who
feels entirely ho-hum
about the upcoming
Super Bowl? Sure, there
are excited fans in Green
Bay and Pittsburgh, but something re
mains to be desired about this Super
Bowl, at least for this sports fan.
It is probably an irrational feeling
after all, the Packers and the Steel
ers are two of football's most histori
cally rich teams. The Packers won the
first two Super Bowls, and the Steelers
have won the most Super Bowls
yet the two storied franchises have
never met for the title.
Still, after the team I grew up root
ing for, the Kansas City Chiefs, was
rightfully bounced from the playoffs in
the wild card round, an air of indiffer
ence fell over me. This weekend, I was
hoping for the Packers and the Jets to
win, just so the Super Bowl champion
would be one of the teams Brett Favre
recently spurned a last "screw you"
to a legend that lost his luster some
where inside of his swollen ego. The
trouble is Favre might have enjoyed
that Super Bowl, because his name
would stay in the news even though he
wouldn't be playing (yes, I know I am
perpetuating exactly what I am railing
against).
This is all without mentioning two
weeks of Rex Ryan sound bites lead
ing up to the game ... oh well.

I guess instead I will have to settle
for Packers-Steelers a matchup be
tween Aaron Rodgers, the quarter
back that made everybody in Green
Bay forget about Favre, and Ben
Roethlisberger, the only quarterback
who may be more of an (alleged)
creep than Favre off the field. Good
guy points go to Rodgers in that
matchup (despite the fact that he went
toCal).
So now that I have gotten Brett
Favre out of the way, onto the game.
In all seriousness, this is a show
down between two of the games best
quarterbacks. Rodgers may fly a bit
under the radar for whatever reason
he wasn't originally selected to this
year's NFC Pro Bowl team, despite
having a fantastic season but is just
as talented as any quarterback in the
league. If you watched Rodgers pick
apart the Falcons in Atlanta in the
NFC divisional round, you may have
been watching one of the best individ
ual performances by a quarterback in
years.
Roethlisberger, on the other hand,
isn't your prototypical precision pock
et passer. Despite appearing unortho
dox, the man is a load to tackle and
makes plays outside the pocket with
his arm and his legs. This is his shot at a
third Super Bowl title in just seven sea
sons, making him a proven winner (a
term I dislike and don't quite under
stand).
While Rodgers vs. Roethlisberger
may get all the headlines, the matchup
of the two defenses is equally, if not
more, compelling. Pittsburgh, or
should I say Blitzburgh, is perennially
known for its defense, especially re
cently under coordinator Dick
Le√üeau.The Packers, however, have a
very impressive defensive unit of their
own, anchored by NFL sack leader
Clay Matthews and 175-year-old
Charles Woodson in the secondary.
People will talk a lot about the
quarterbacks, but I see this game being

Something
remains to
be desired
about this
Super Bowl.
