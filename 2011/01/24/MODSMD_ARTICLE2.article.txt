## SLAC looks to upgrade key facilities Norm Bobczynski to head renovations 
### LAURYN WILLIAMS 
SLAC National Accelerator
Laboratory will undergo millions
of dollars in renovations to its ma
chinery in the next few years, re
placing most of the facility's infra
structure and aiming to extend its
life another five decades.
SLAC hired Norm Bobczynski
in August as the head of its opera
tions and maintenance unit to over
see the forthcoming facility up
grades.
In the past, maintenance strate
gies have been mainly reactive, but
according to

Bobczynski, SLAC
has had to deal
with the issues that
are inherent to a
lab built 50 years
ago and infrastruc
ture that "is near
ing the end of its
useful life."

Underground
utilities, including low-conductivity
water tanks and electrical systems,
have fallen into disrepair over the
past few months and will be among
the first problems to be tackled
during the upgrade.
The age of SLAC's machinery
has led to a few rare emergencies.
Within the last few months, water
lines deteriorated by corrosion
have failed as a result of changes in
temperature and pressure. SLAC's
emergency response team has han
dled problems quickly in the past,
but the increasing frequency of
these problems prompted
Bobczynski and the maintenance
unit to focus on a proactive ap
proach in the facility's overhaul
plan to prevent such emergencies
from happening at all.
"In total, replacements will cost
in the hundreds of millions of dol
lars over several years, and are ex
pected to extend the life of SLAC
for at least another 50 years,"
Bobczynski said.
At this point in the upgrade,
SLAC is taking a "long-term strate
gic approach" to extend the life of
the hardware in use while not dis
rupting ongoing scientific experi
ments.
"Eventually all SLAC hardware
and infrastructure will need to be
replaced, but we will focus our at
tention on a prioritized list based
on condition and age," Bobczynski
said. For example, the lab plans to
prevent failures like breaks in un
derground piping by replacing the
current pipes with state-of-the art
materials that will provide the
equipment with more longevity.
"All equipment has a different
useful life expectancy, so failure
frequency always tends to increase
as time goes on," Bobczynski said.
Stanford hosts and operates
SLAC for the U.S. Department of
Energy. The refurbishment budget
will be largely covered by funds
from the Department of Energy.
