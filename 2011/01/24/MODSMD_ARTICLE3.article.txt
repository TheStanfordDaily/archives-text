## Blood Center reaches out to dorms, PHEs Seeks to keep up momentum after November's 'Rivals for Life' 
### STEVEN SMALLBERG 
Stanford Blood Center, coming off its most
successful "Rivals for Life" blood drive in four
years, is looking to keep the momentum going
in 2011 with more regular White Plaza blood
mobiles and dorm outreach. Some students,
however, say they are still deterred from donat
ing because of time and inconvenience.
The center supplies more than 100,000 units
of blood and blood components each year for
patients and research purposes.
"The trends we've been seeing the past few
years have been really encouraging, and we're
always looking for new ways to boost our blood
draws," said Elisa Manzanares, Blood Center
account manager.
"Rivals for Life" in November, an event
Manzanares created, was the center's most suc
cessful drive this year with 234 units collected by
the Blood Center.
"It's a great kickoff drive for the year be

cause it's so large," Manzanares said. "It gives
students a great opportunity to get involved
early."
The mobile blood drives in White Plaza also
have become more fruitful since the center's
bloodmobile has become a regular fixture each
month rather than a sporadic presence, as it has
been in the past.
Now, the center is organizing drives in stu
dent houses, beginning in February and extend
ing through the spring.
"We attract a lot of donors [at house drives]
because it's so convenient for students," Man
zanares said. "These drives are pretty compara
ble to White Plaza drives in terms of the amount
we can collect."
Though the blood drives have been general
ly successful overall, students still see room for
improvement.
"My only complaint is that [donating] is a bit
of a time commitment," said Connor Raikes 'l3,
a regular donor. "There are a couple times that
I've had to wait an hour or more to make a do
nation. I've always waited, but I could imagine
other students who want to, but get turned off
