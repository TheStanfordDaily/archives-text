## Junior dies after multi-year battle with cancer 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€” Amy Julia Harris 
Sarah Adicoff 'l2 died Thursday morning
after a long battle with cancer that began when
she was in high school. She was 21.
Adicoff was diagnosed with rhabdomyosar
coma, a cancer of the body's soft tissues, when
she was 16. She relapsed multiple times, most
recently in February 2009, after her first quarter
at Stanford.

Adicoff lived in Branner her freshman year,
Toyon sophomore year and Storey this fall
quarter before taking a leave of absence in the
winter. She was a member of Alpha Delta Phi
Society, an unhoused co-ed fraternity on cam
pus.
When members of Alpha Delt received
word of Adicoff s passing on Thursday after
noon, they organized an evening vigil at Lake
Lagunita's fire pit. Haley Knapp 'll, a member
of Alpha Delt and family friend of Adicoff s, es
timated that 20 to 30 people from Alpha Delt
and Storey came to show their support and
share stories of Sarah.
"There were lots of silences because no one
really knows what to say when you've got a loss
like that," Knapp said of the vigil. "But it turned
out well."

Avinash Achaibar 'l2, a friend of Adicoff
who lived with her in Braner and in Storey this
year, remembers Adicoff for her optimism and
ability to appreciate each moment.
"Sarah was probably more full of life than a
lot of people I know, and she knew probably
more than anyone how to live in the moment,"
Achaibar said. "She never let her sickness be a
crutch or let it limit her. She would always talk
about going to Disneyland and the Galapagos.
At Stanford, I think living in the moment is
something that we forget."
Storey will host a support services meeting
for those affected by Adicoff s passing on Mon
day at 7 p.m. in the side lounge, according to res
ident assistant Andy Hiller 'll.
