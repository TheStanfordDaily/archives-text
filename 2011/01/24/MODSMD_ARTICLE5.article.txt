# Summit tackles transit
## Lack of stable funding could permanently derail Caltrain 
### AMY JULIA HARRIS DESK EDITOR 
If Caltrain doesn't find a stable funding
source to offset its $3O million deficit, the
commuter transit system could go belly up,
transportation and local officials said at Stan
ford on Friday.
More than 230 attendees convened at the
Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Re
search for a "Save Caltrain" summit to brain
storm solutions for the transit agency's fiscal
problems. Friday's summit was the first of
two such meetings and was sponsored by the
Silicon Valley Leadership Group, a network
of companies that addresses regional public
policy issues.
"Can we imagine if we had no Caltrain?"
said Sean Elsbernd, San Francisco Supervisor
and Caltrain Joint Powers board of directors
chairman. "What would it do to the environ
ment?"
On Thursday, the day before the summit,
Caltrain announced that it faced a potential
loss of $3O million from its $lOO million annu
al budget if transit agencies cut back their
contributions. Caltrain, unlike other regional
transit agencies, doesn't have a stable rev
enue stream and instead relies on about 34
percent of its funding contributions from its
three partner agencies San Mateo Coun
ty's SamTrans, Santa Clara County's VTA
and San Francisco's transit (MTA), according
to initial figures by the MTC's Transit Sus
tainability Project. SamTrans is expected to
cut its annual contribution to Caltrain by $lO
million, and if the two other agencies follow
suit, Caltrain faces even deeper cuts.
Given this fiscal outlook, Caltrain is con
sidering slashing its service to 48 weekday
trains from 86, cutting weekday service out
side of peak hours, axing its weekend service
and service south of San Jose's Diridon Sta
tion and suspending service at up to seven
stations. If these cuts go through, the more
than 38,000 weekday commuters who rely on
Caltrain could be left in the lurch.
Panelists at the event weren't willing to
entertain that option.
"None of us want to face the prospect that
12 million riders per year will return to our
highways," Rep. Anna Eshoo, D-Palo Alto,
told attendees via a broadcast.
Instead, officials proposed money-making
solutions like tunneling revenue to Caltrain
from a high occupancy/toll lane on Highway
101 and introducing a voter-approved gas tax
to prop up Caltrain.
In the last few years, Caltrain has tried dif
ferent quick-fix solutions to generate more
revenue and cut costs, but even these were
not enough to pull Caltrain out of its budget
woes. Beginning Jan. 1, Caltrain raised fares
by 25 cents per zone and cut service for two
northbound trains and two southbound
trains from its midday schedule. Caltrain also
spearheaded a three-month pilot program of
weekend "baby bullet" express trains to rake
in additional ridership revenue. About 44
percent of Caltrain's funding this year will
come from passenger fares.
State Assemblyman Jim Beall, D-San
Jose, spoke for many when he suggested that
merging some of Caltrain's contributing
transportation agencies into one entity could
streamline costs.
"We should get rid of some of these organ
izations," Beall said. "We need a regional
source of funding for a regional agency."
The elimination of Caltrain would be dev
astating for both the environment and local
communities, said Yoriko Kishimoto, who
heads the grassroots coalition Friends of Cal
train.
"Caltrain is at the heart of where the
peninsula needs to go," she said. "Our econo
my, our environment. .. everything is predi
cated on a healthy Caltrain."
Stanford relies heavily on Caltrain to re
duce traffic congestion on campus and meet
its environmental sustainability goals. In
2010, 19 percent of Stanford em
ployees used Caltrain as their
number-one transportation
source. In 2010, 52 percent of
University employees regularly
used some form of alternative
transportation, such as transit, bi
cycling, walking, ride-sharing or
telecommuting, compared with
an estimated 22 percent within
Santa Clara County, according to

Parking and Transportation Ser
vices.
Other ideas floating at the sum
mit included hikes in traffic-im
pact fees on new construction, a
sales tax increase and a parking
fee increase at Caltrain stations.
They also suggested that Caltrain
add Wi-Fi service on trains to en
tice new riders.
Another public meeting on this
issue will be hosted by Friends of
Caltrain on Jan. 29 at the Sam-
Trans offices in San Carlos.
