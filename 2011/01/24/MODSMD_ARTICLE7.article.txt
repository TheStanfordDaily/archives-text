Born in San Jose, Calif., on Sept.
14,1989, Sarah died Jan. 20,2011, in
her parents' arms of complications
from cancer treatment.
Sarah sang with gusto from the
age of 15 months and carried her
musicality and ability to remember
any lyric to high school and local
stage productions, such as "The Boys
from Syracuse," "Pirates of Pen
zance" and "Hair." She enjoyed
playing soccer, skiing and swimming
competitively for many years, even
tually concentrating on swimming
year-round with her wonderful
coaches and peers on the 5B Swim
team.
School was one of Sarah's pas
sions, and she was lucky to attend
Mulberry School in San Jose, where
she formed deep friendships with
both teachers and kids, learned to
work out problems and mediate be
tween others, enjoy learning and
participate in so many creative proj -
ects. From about the second grade,
Sarah organized her own parties
and made her own Halloween cos
tumes. True to form, in 2004, Sarah
organized a well-attended reunion
of her fifth grade class in Sun Valley,
where the kids played hard, hung
out and made good use of the infa
mous "Adiconner" costume box to
produce skits and other hilarity.
After moving to Sun Valley, Idaho,
in 2000, Sarah attended Wood River
Middle School, then graduated
from The Community School in De
cember 2007. She was selected for
the Laura S. Flood Foundation
award and received a National
Merit Letter of Commendation.
Rhabdomyosarcoma interrupted
Sarah's life when she was 16, arriving
at a time of normal transition and sep
aration, making her once again very
dependent on parents and causing
her to miss much of her schooling and
regular young-adult life. Cancer took
much of her strength, her singing
voice and, she felt, some of her ability
to think and remember. Nonetheless,
her treatment afforded her some
longer periods of relative "health" in
which she was able to pursue her
studies or travel extensively with var
ious family members. Her caretakers
have been amazed by her resiliency
and accomplishments throughout her
treatments. Her death is an illustra
tion of the appalling lack of improve
ment, over the last 35 years, in survival

rates among 15- to 40-year-olds with
cancer.
We will miss Sarah's humor,
grace, enthusiasm for engagement
and keen observation and interest in
the animal world.
Sarah is survived by her loving
parents, Samuel Adicoff and Susan
Conner; her younger brothers,
William and Jacob; grandparents
Arnold and Ruth Adicoff and
William and Marilyn Conner; uncle
Charles (Anne Simpson) Conner;
aunts Cathy (Ted Furst) Conner, Jill
Conner, Annie (Mark Schneider)
Adicoff and Carrie Adicoff; and
cousins Alison and Madeline Con
ner, Rebekkah and Ariel Adicoff

and Kyle and Kurt Schneider.
A memorial is being planned for
the Sun Valley, Idaho, area in Febru
ary, and later this spring in the Stan
ford area. Details are pending and
will be published in The Daily. Dona
tions for research are suggested for
Seattle Children's Sarcoma Re
search, Fred Barr's lab at University
of Pennsylvania, St. Baldrick's Foun
dation or one of the wonderful or
ganizations from which she benefit
ed greatly: Camp Rainbow Gold,
Idaho Make a Wish or Ronald Mc-
Donald House.
