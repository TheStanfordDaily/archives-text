# OPINIONS
## THE 						TRANSITIVE PROPERTY Newfound Brothers 
### Cristopher Bautista 
I feel extremely anxious in male
dominated spaces. Going to all
boys floors scare me. Going to the
gym scares me. Even going to the
men's bathroom scares me. Maybe
it's this recurrent nightmare of mine
that these guys will find out my bio
logical sex and then end up hurting
me (or worse) for it. So of course,
ending up in a place like a fraternity
house to talk about my experiences
as a trans person left me absolutely
terrified.

I'm a panelist for Safe and Open
Spaces at Stanford (or SOSAS), a
program run by the LGBT-CRC to
help educate the Stanford communi
ty on LGBT issues. The program op
erates mostly by panels, consisting of
about four panelists and a modera
tor. My experience with SOSAS pan
els consisted of freshman dorms,
where I mostly spoke to freshmen
who had never encountered anyone
LGBT before. This was the first panel
of the school year at a fraternity
house Kappa Sigma, to be exact.
Me? I felt mostly petrified. I
found that I was particularly quiet
during this panel, not necessarily be
cause I had nothing to contribute to
the conversation, but because I
couldn't really open my mouth to say
anything. It took me a while to realize
why I felt so anxious and uncomfort
able in a place like a fraternity house.
There was always this insecurity
when it came to my masculinity.
Maybe it's this deep-rooted trauma
from my childhood, when I had al
ways wanted to be "one of the guys"
but I was never allowed this privilege,
not for 20 years, not until now. And
I'm still getting used to being a man,
interacting with other men and inter
acting with women. These guys
seemed to get it down perfect. They
were fraternity men men in the
most traditional, mainstream sense
of the word.This fraternity house was
a foreign space to me, a space in
which I did not feel welcome not
necessarily because of the occupants,

but because of what that house stood
for and what it symbolized for a per
son like me, who had been denied
this sense of manhood for years and
years. I felt that the house's brothers
had a language all their own, a lan
guage that I could not take part in
simply because I was never given the
opportunity to speak on the same
terms as men.
Near the end of the panel, a guy
raised his hand and directly ad
dressed me. He asked about my ex
perience at Stanford as a transguy,
and asked how my transition was
going. I finally managed to say some
thing. It didn't even seem like me
talking I just heard myself talk. I
talked about how I was nervous
about being here, about my anxieties
about not feeling quite masculine
enough, about my excitement over
my transition, about my legal name
change, hormones. I don't really re
member much of what I said, actual
ly. I thought I had contributed noth
ing to this panel but my answer that
was less of an answer and more of a
bumbling ramble.
But after the panel several of the
frat guys came up to me and told me
they appreciated my story. Hand
shakes and back thumps were ex
changed. I felt validated.
When I was at the Lou Sullivan
Society's meeting two weeks ago, I
was accepted as a man as well, but it
was under another context a
queer context. I was accepted as a
man, but under a different doctrine of
the transman.They were my brothers
in the fact that we were all trans.
But in this frat house, I was also

accepted as man, but I was also ac
cepted in a space where a majority of
the people there were not only men,
but men who were biologically born
males. They respected me, and they
respected my masculinity. Although
I was different, they acknowledged
me as their brother too. And I'll
admit, it was a surprise for me. I
never thought I would reach this
point, where I would feel like a legit
imate young man acknowledged
and respected by other men outside
of the queer community. For so long
I felt like I was merely masquerad
ing as a guy, that everyone was using
male pronouns for me just because I
asked them to, not because they had
any inherent sense of me as a man.
But that night gave me a new sense
of courage and a new sense of mas
culinity that I never quite allowed
myself to be part of, simply because I
didn't feel entitled to it. But that
night, the fraternity brothers at
Kappa Sig proved to me that I was an
idiot for even thinking I wasn't good
enough to be a guy.
I wish I wasn't a senior. Rushing
sounds pretty appealing right now.

Cristopher thinks you should rush
Kappa Sig. E-mail him atcmsb@stan
