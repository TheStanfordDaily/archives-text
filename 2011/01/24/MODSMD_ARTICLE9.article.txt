# CARDINAL SINS
## Get Rude 
### David Spencer Nelson 
Students tend to scoff at the word
"participation," especially
when it's written on a syllabus
with a big percentage of their grade.
But it is, in math, English, language,
biology and chemistry, a profoundly
good thing. We have a tendency, we
freshmen, to disparage it, perhaps
because we feel just a touch too self
assured, too comfortable in the be
lief that we already have the materi
al under control. Participation is
often written off as useless, an unnec
essary accessory. Why do we need to
talk if we can simply learn this on our
own? We can all pass the tests, get the
grades and get degrees without pay
ing lip service to professors.
The fundamental truth about col
lege is that you will not use, or even
remember, much of what you learn.
However, the intention of the pow
ers that be is that you develop some
general skills along with the knowl
edge you retain. Those skills are the
most important draws from your col
lege experience, I'd say, with proper
keg-stand and beer pong technique
close behind.
When we lend our voices into
class, to question or raise concerns,
to poke holes in an argument or
force teachers to justify their stud
ies, we exercise a muscle that will
serve us our entire lives long. What
critical participation does is hone
systems for processing information
and, from it, creating belief. Instead
of just being a vessel for test- and
essay-applicable knowledge, engag
ing with material critically allows
you to not only individualize the
message you get from it, but ensure
it is one that fits in your own world

view. If it doesn't, and it often won't,
it will help you improve and expand
your perspective. It's this sort of crit
ical participation that, in written
form, is the Socratic dialogue that
scholarship exists in.
But that questioning, that critical
eye, needs to extend beyond the
classroom, especially here at Stan
ford. Leading universities' adminis
trative decisions have echoes and
imitators across the academic
world, and Stanford is no exception.
The school, currently grappling
with budget pressures forcing it to
choose what it considers important,
i.e. financial aid or research and the
possible reversal of the 1973 aban
donment of ROTC, often leads
trends in American universities.
What this means for students is that

Do not
be a
bystander.
