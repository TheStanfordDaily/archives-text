# CARDINAL SINS
## Get Rude 
### David Spencer Nelson 
Students tend to scoff at the word
"participation," especially
when it's written on a syllabus
with a big percentage of their grade.
But it is, in math, English, language,
biology and chemistry, a profoundly
good thing. We have a tendency, we
freshmen, to disparage it, perhaps
because we feel just a touch too self
assured, too comfortable in the be
lief that we already have the materi
al under control. Participation is
often written off as useless, an unnec
essary accessory. Why do we need to
talk if we can simply learn this on our
own? We can all pass the tests, get the
grades and get degrees without pay
ing lip service to professors.
The fundamental truth about col
lege is that you will not use, or even
remember, much of what you learn.
However, the intention of the pow
ers that be is that you develop some
general skills along with the knowl
edge you retain. Those skills are the
most important draws from your col
lege experience, I'd say, with proper
keg-stand and beer pong technique
close behind.
When we lend our voices into
class, to question or raise concerns,
to poke holes in an argument or
force teachers to justify their stud
ies, we exercise a muscle that will
serve us our entire lives long. What
critical participation does is hone
systems for processing information
and, from it, creating belief. Instead
of just being a vessel for test- and
essay-applicable knowledge, engag
ing with material critically allows
you to not only individualize the
message you get from it, but ensure
it is one that fits in your own world

view. If it doesn't, and it often won't,
it will help you improve and expand
your perspective. It's this sort of crit
ical participation that, in written
form, is the Socratic dialogue that
scholarship exists in.
But that questioning, that critical
eye, needs to extend beyond the
classroom, especially here at Stan
ford. Leading universities' adminis
trative decisions have echoes and
imitators across the academic
world, and Stanford is no exception.
The school, currently grappling
with budget pressures forcing it to
choose what it considers important,
i.e. financial aid or research and the
possible reversal of the 1973 aban
donment of ROTC, often leads
trends in American universities.
What this means for students is that

Do not
be a
bystander.

our advocacy here at Stanford can
drive change across college cam
puses. This in turn can influence na
tional politics and change the opin
ions of progressive people across
the nation.
There are, whether we're aware
of it or not, debates going on behind
the scenes about University proce
dures. ROTC, policies concerning
athletic admissions and IFIUM are
not only on the table for discussion,
but are fundamentally changeable.
The current review of IHUM is a
perfect example; students spoke, re
views were initiated. We should feel
free to question University institu
tions, whether they are morally or
pragmatically good, or whether they
contribute to Stanford in a positive
way.

Jacob Bronowski, a famous
mathematician, said, "It is important
that students bring a certain raga
muffin, barefoot irreverence to their
studies; They are not here to worship
what is known, but to question it."
This attitude, that of the critical par
ticipant, is one that we should take
beyond the classroom. Do not be a
bystander, or worse, a sycophant to
convention.

Many of our parents were baby
boomers, a generation whose ag
gressive questioning culminated in
some incredible acts (for example,
the 1968 burning down of Stan
ford's ROTC building). The accusa
tion that we don't care about much
other than material goods and
transparent, selfish philanthropy is
often leveled at our generation. We
should strive to be principled, and
not just when we're talking about
human rights abroad or obvious in
equities in far-flung countries.
Don't instinctively move your criti
cal tendencies to obvious, unam

biguous targets. Use them in every
day life. We need to bring our ideals
home, and that's most important
when they're controversial. Pursue
them with a little more care than
our forbearers did. (For legal rea
sons, I'm going to make it clear that
I'm not advocating arson or de
struction of University property in
anything's name.)
Now that I've made all you young
people iconoclasts, there should be
no shame in challenging existing
ideas. That's how political systems
improve. Even when you agree with
an idea or a party, don't be afraid to
question it and make people explain
themselves. Don't let politeness get
in the way of pursuing the right, and
never accept a policy or stance that
isn't justified.
But, whatever. I'm mostly writing
this because section gets awkward
when no one talks ...

ing with material critically allows
you to not only individualize the
message you get from it, but ensure
it is one that fits in your own world

view. If it doesn't, and it often won't,
it will help you improve and expand
your perspective. It's this sort of crit
ical participation that, in written
form, is the Socratic dialogue that
scholarship exists in.
But that questioning, that critical
eye, needs to extend beyond the
classroom, especially here at Stan
ford. Leading universities' adminis
trative decisions have echoes and
imitators across the academic
world, and Stanford is no exception.
The school, currently grappling
with budget pressures forcing it to
choose what it considers important,
i.e. financial aid or research and the
possible reversal of the 1973 aban
donment of ROTC, often leads
trends in American universities.
What this means for students is that

Do not
be a
bystander.

our advocacy here at Stanford can
drive change across college cam
puses. This in turn can influence na
tional politics and change the opin
ions of progressive people across
the nation.
There are, whether we're aware
of it or not, debates going on behind
the scenes about University proce
dures. ROTC, policies concerning
athletic admissions and IFIUM are
not only on the table for discussion,
but are fundamentally changeable.
The current review of IHUM is a
perfect example; students spoke, re
views were initiated. We should feel
free to question University institu
tions, whether they are morally or
pragmatically good, or whether they
contribute to Stanford in a positive
way.

Jacob Bronowski, a famous
mathematician, said, "It is important
that students bring a certain raga
muffin, barefoot irreverence to their
studies; They are not here to worship
what is known, but to question it."
This attitude, that of the critical par
ticipant, is one that we should take
beyond the classroom. Do not be a
bystander, or worse, a sycophant to
convention.

Many of our parents were baby
boomers, a generation whose ag
gressive questioning culminated in
some incredible acts (for example,
the 1968 burning down of Stan
ford's ROTC building). The accusa
tion that we don't care about much
other than material goods and
transparent, selfish philanthropy is
often leveled at our generation. We
should strive to be principled, and
not just when we're talking about
human rights abroad or obvious in
equities in far-flung countries.
Don't instinctively move your criti
cal tendencies to obvious, unam

biguous targets. Use them in every
day life. We need to bring our ideals
home, and that's most important
when they're controversial. Pursue
them with a little more care than
our forbearers did. (For legal rea
sons, I'm going to make it clear that
I'm not advocating arson or de
struction of University property in
anything's name.)
Now that I've made all you young
people iconoclasts, there should be
no shame in challenging existing
ideas. That's how political systems
improve. Even when you agree with
an idea or a party, don't be afraid to
question it and make people explain
themselves. Don't let politeness get
in the way of pursuing the right, and
never accept a policy or stance that
isn't justified.
But, whatever. I'm mostly writing
this because section gets awkward
when no one talks ...
