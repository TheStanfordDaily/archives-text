# GIRL YOU KNOW IT'S TRUE
## Anonymous Novels about Famous People 
### Jordan Carr 
Today marks the release of "O:
A Presidential Novel" an
anonymously written novel
about the 2012 presidential election
(Obama loses spoiler alert!). In
most ways, the book appears to be
an echo of the 1996 novel "Primary
Colors," which was an anonymously
written novelized version of Bill
Clinton's 1992 presidential cam
paign (these types of books are
called romans a clef, for those keep
ing score at home). The anonymous
author is a neat trick to get buzz
around a book, but is inevitably dis
appointing remember when you
found out who Deep Throat was?
Of course not, nobody does. But it
was W. Mark Felt. W. Mark Felt. So
don't start counting down the days
until we learn that the author of
"O" was some journalist nobody's
ever heard of.
But that does not mean "O" is
without value or part of a valuable
and long tradition of turning real

people's existence into fictional nar
ratives that stretches from "Citizen
Kane's" depiction of William Ran
dolph Hearst as Charles Foster Kane
to "The Simpsons'" depiction of
Cliff Huxtable as Dr. Julius Hibbert.
And so while "O" is not likely to be
the definitive account of the Obama
presidency or the 2012 election, it
seems like an easy enough way to
have a bestselling book without hav
ing to actually be a good writer. And
while President Obama is a good
choice for a book that arbitrarily
projects off into the future on the
basis of very little evidence, there are
other options out there.

S: Alaska's Sweetheart
A tale of the 2012 presidential
election, "S" tells the story of a
plucky young girl from Alaska who
seeks her party's nomination for
president. Sarah, our protagonist,
loses horribly because even wide
majorities of her own party view her
as unfit for office. Sample line:
"Though Sarah always claimed God
had told her to run for president, her
campaign quickly fell apart when
she was tape-recorded blaming him
for her lowa loss, shouting to no
body in particular, 'I praise you
24/7!!!!!! And is this how you do
me!!!!! You expect me to learn from
this??? How???!!! I'll never forget
this!! Ever!!! Thanks though.'"

J: Bieber's World
Upon entering his early twen
ties, onetime teen idol (that's what

he is, right?) Justin Bieber finds his
once enthusiastic fan base of
twelve-year-old girls has aban
doned him for a younger, floppier
haired Canadian You Tube sensa
tion. Realizing that his only hope
for survival as a star is to go on a vi
sion quest, he travels deep into the
woods where he can speak with his
spiritual godfathers, New Kids on
the Block's Joey Mclntyre, Ricky
Martin and NSYNC's Joey Fatone.
Unfortunately there really isn't
anything that mediocre, not-that
talented teen idols can do besides
develop lifelong drug problems
that will someday allow them to
appear on Celebrity Rehab.

T: A Cult of Personality
A slightly over-the-hill movie
star finds solace in a bizarre reli
gion that many regard as the
cultish fantasies of an insane sci
ence fiction writer. Somehow, au
diences don't seem to care, and
Tom continues to make generic ac
tion movies that nobody is ever ex
cited to see well into the distant fu
ture before retiring from acting
upon receiving a promotion to the
post of Chairman of the Church of

Scientology, at which point it be
comes the most popular religion in
the world.

(): A Presidential Novel
After seeing her handpicked
candidate and fellow Chicagoan
Barack Obama rise to the presi
dency, Oprah Winfrey beams with
pride and is pleased that her en
dorsement proved enough to sin
glehandedly convince enough
Americans to go vote for him. But
when he fails to fulfill all of his
campaign promises, she decides
that she will take matters into her
own hands and seek the office her
self. Running outside the tradition
al bounds of the two-party system,
Oprah finds a groundswell of sup
port at her back when public opin
ion turns against sitting president
Barack Obama and no enthusiasm
can be generated on behalf of
über-boring Republican nominee
Tim Pawlenty.
America begins to believe it has
made a horrible mistake when
Oprah threatens to invade Brazil if
it does not return the 2016
Olympics to Chicago, but Oprah
quickly assuages all such concerns
of her incompetence by giving aro
matic soaps out to all of America.

(): A Presidential Novel
After seeing her handpicked
candidate and fellow Chicagoan
Barack Obama rise to the presi
dency, Oprah Winfrey beams with
pride and is pleased that her en
dorsement proved enough to sin
glehandedly convince enough
Americans to go vote for him. But
when he fails to fulfill all of his
campaign promises, she decides
that she will take matters into her
own hands and seek the office her
self. Running outside the tradition
al bounds of the two-party system,
Oprah finds a groundswell of sup
port at her back when public opin
ion turns against sitting president
Barack Obama and no enthusiasm
can be generated on behalf of
über-boring Republican nominee
Tim Pawlenty.
America begins to believe it has
made a horrible mistake when
Oprah threatens to invade Brazil if
it does not return the 2016
Olympics to Chicago, but Oprah
quickly assuages all such concerns
of her incompetence by giving aro
matic soaps out to all of America.
