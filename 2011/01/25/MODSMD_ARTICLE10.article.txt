Today marks the release of "O:
A Presidential Novel" an
anonymously written novel
about the 2012 presidential election
(Obama loses spoiler alert!). In
most ways, the book appears to be
an echo of the 1996 novel "Primary
Colors," which was an anonymously
written novelized version of Bill
Clinton's 1992 presidential cam
paign (these types of books are
called romans a clef, for those keep
ing score at home). The anonymous
author is a neat trick to get buzz
around a book, but is inevitably dis
appointing remember when you
found out who Deep Throat was?
Of course not, nobody does. But it
was W. Mark Felt. W. Mark Felt. So
don't start counting down the days
until we learn that the author of
"O" was some journalist nobody's
ever heard of.
But that does not mean "O" is
without value or part of a valuable
and long tradition of turning real

people's existence into fictional nar
ratives that stretches from "Citizen
Kane's" depiction of William Ran
dolph Hearst as Charles Foster Kane
to "The Simpsons'" depiction of
Cliff Huxtable as Dr. Julius Hibbert.
And so while "O" is not likely to be
the definitive account of the Obama
presidency or the 2012 election, it
seems like an easy enough way to
have a bestselling book without hav
ing to actually be a good writer. And
while President Obama is a good
choice for a book that arbitrarily
projects off into the future on the
basis of very little evidence, there are
other options out there.

S: Alaska's Sweetheart
A tale of the 2012 presidential
election, "S" tells the story of a
plucky young girl from Alaska who
seeks her party's nomination for
president. Sarah, our protagonist,
loses horribly because even wide
majorities of her own party view her
as unfit for office. Sample line:
"Though Sarah always claimed God
had told her to run for president, her
campaign quickly fell apart when
she was tape-recorded blaming him
for her lowa loss, shouting to no
body in particular, 'I praise you
24/7!!!!!! And is this how you do
me!!!!! You expect me to learn from
this??? How???!!! I'll never forget
this!! Ever!!! Thanks though.'"
