## The 						America of 2021 
### Jonathan Gelbart 
The haunting mixture of hope
and apprehension, excitement
and uncertainty, that marks
the arrival of each new year has
come and gone. In a blur, the first
three weeks of winter quarter have
disappeared. Yet imagine for a mo
ment that the new year is not 2011,
but 2021.
To young students like us, that
year seems impossibly far away. But
those who are further along in life's
journey know that 10 years can pass
in a blink of an eye, leaving only nos
talgia and regret in their wake. The
question remains only of what we
will do with that precious time.
So what world will greet us when
the digits "2-0-2-1" stand embla
zoned in front of Times Square's

ball? As we begin our 30s, Sept. 11
will be a distant two decades past.
Our parents will be among the more
than 50 million Americans older
than 65. And, if we do not press our
representatives to make wise choic
es in the years ahead, the United
States will likely be a mere shell of its
former self.

Since the start of the financial cri
sis, the stewards of our nation have
failed utterly in their duty to make
decisions that act toward the better
ment of our country rather than the
enrichment of its oligarchy. They
have acted selfishly and recklessly by
allowing the national debt to reach a
predicted $2O trillion by 2021, much
of which will be owed to hostile for
eign powers.They have replaced rea

son with partisanship, ensuring that
endless, useless bickering silences ra
tionality and innovation on every oc
casion. And they have dug in their
heels at a time when only sweeping,
unprecedented reform can save this
country from total collapse. The
United States of America, as re
silient and powerful as it is, simply
cannot endure another decade of
this sickening chicanery.
Should you think this description
of the present situation is somewhat
overblown, allow me to offer you
some additional figures. The Center
on Budget and Policy Priorities has
reported that 46 states are facing
budget shortfalls this fiscal year to
taling $ll2 billion, leaving Alaska,
Arkansas, Montana and North

Dakota as the only states in the
union with their fiscal houses in
order. Unfunded state and local pub
lic pension liabilities, according to a
recent New York Times article, total
a mind-blowing $3.6 trillion.
Newsweek's report last summer on
the "best countries in the world"
awarded America's education sys
tem 26th place internationally, 12
notches below Kazakhstan, based on
international standardized test
scores. And the American Society of
Civil Engineers' annual Report
Card for America's Infrastructure
gave us a miserable "D" in that arena
last fall.
It is easy to glaze over these sta
tistics without processing them, but
the problems they quantify can no
longer be ignored or wished away.
These numbers are hard, unforgiv
ing, objective indicators of the fu
ture that we will inherit if we do not
act now, swiftly and decisively. If it is
our responsibility to improve this
world for the benefit of our descen
dants and I believe it is then
we can no longer afford to let short

sightedness continue to rule the
day.

A solution will begin to arise only
when all of us emerge from our apa
thy, rise together in a show of over
whelming force and say as one, "We
demand sanity." We demand the end
of earmarks, lame duck legislation,
recess appointments and other polit
ical sleight of hand that flagrantly
disrespects the constitution. We de
mand a sustainable health care sys
tem that provides for the needy
without annihilating our fiscal well
being. We demand an education sys
tem worthy of our children's time
and our proud history. And we de

mand that the voice of the entire
American people be heard and re
spected rather than dismissed as the
rabble of the hoi polloi.
Until you and I demand all this,
together, nothing will change. And
anything short of a radical rethink
ing and restructuring of the
leviathan that is the United States
government will lead only to a de
layed recurrence of the same prob
lems that plague us today. So rise up,
break through the Stanford bubble,
and make a difference while you still
can. The world 0f2021 depends on it.
