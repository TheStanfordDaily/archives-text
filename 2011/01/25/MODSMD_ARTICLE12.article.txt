The No. 3 Stanford men's gym
nastics team beat No. 2 California
on Saturday, 364.4 to 358.8, in front
of a large Burnham Pavilion
crowd. The Cardinal bounced back
from last week's loss to the Golden
Bears, improving its overall score
by over 15 points and easily putting
up its highest team score so far this
season.
With only two meets under its
belt, the Cardinal is already mak
ing a statement to be the top team
on the podium at the NCAA
Championships. Its 364.4 finish was
three points better than Stanford's
highest team score last season.
The Cardinal started off the
competition with a strong showing

on the floor exercise to jump out to
a 61.4 to 58.9 lead. Freshman Cale
Robinson stuck nearly all his tum
bling pass landings to put up a solid
15.4. Seniors Alex Buscaglia and
Josh Dixon followed with their
usual dependable routines, scoring
a 15.1 and 15.9, respectively.
Sophomore Eddie Penev start
ed the pommel horse event with a
fall, putting pressure on the rest of
the lineup. However, redshirt soph
omore Jordan Nolff fought to stay
on the apparatus and the rest of the
lineup followed suit and hit the
next four routines. Chris Turner
proved to be the superstar fresh
man on the pommel horse, hitting a
solid routine and landing the dis
mount to earn a 15.0.
Senior Ryan Lieberman contin
ued the team's momentum and

produced a 14.2 while the redshirt
sophomore duo of Gabe Jefferson
and John Martin closed the event
off with a 14.9 and 15.3, respective
ly. The rotation set the pace for the
rest of the competition as the Car
dinal went to the rings ahead of Cal
by four and a half points.
"I think that gaining an early
lead on Cal really took them out of
their game," said senior co-captain
Tim Gentry. "They still had a pret
ty good performance, but once we
took an early lead we never looked
back."
Rings was a clean event for the
Cardinal as Lieberman and Gentry
both scored career bests. Lieber
man put up a 15.1 and Gentry per
formed a tight routine with few
form breaks to produce a 15.8.
Buscaglia (14.6) and sophomore

James Fosco (15.4) also made sig
nificant contributions.
The team experienced a minor
dip in momentum on vault as it
made a few uncharacteristic mis
takes. Still, Penev, last year's
NCAA champion on the event, de
buted with a strong 16.3 vault and
Gentry did a double front for a
16.1.
Stanford improved significantly
from last meet on the parallel bars
with a 59.9. Dixon had a career
best 15.4 and 2010 NCAA champi
on Lieberman also scored well
with a 15.2. Redshirt senior Nick
Noone closed off the event with a
14.7.
The men finished the meet
strong on the high bar with a 59.7.
