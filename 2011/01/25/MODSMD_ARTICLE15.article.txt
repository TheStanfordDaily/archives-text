### Daniel Bohm On My Mind 
West Coasters like to
complain that there
is an East Coast bias
in sports. Want to
know why that is?
It's because the sports world ticks on
Eastern Standard Time.
The sports Gods (also known as the
commissioners of the major sports
leagues) maximize viewership by en
suring that games start at primetime on
the East Coast the West is merely an
afterthought.
I have had the Eastern time versus
Western time conversation (argu
ment?) with enough Califomians since
moving here from New York to under
stand the merits of both sides and to
be honest, I think the ideal time zone
for sports viewing is the Central Time
Zone and I have decided that East
is definitely better than West.
Let me start by posing a question.
What do you like to eat while watching
NFL games? Bar food I believe would
be a pretty standard answer to that
question chicken wings, burgers, na
chos, etc. Flowever, that doesn't sound
all that appetizing at 10 a.m. Football is
not made for waffles and pancakes.
Take it a step further. What do you
want to drink while watching football?
There is a reason there are countless
beer commercials during football
games beer is the beverage of
choice. Do you want a tasty cold one at
10 a.m.? (Don't answer that question.)
I don't see Tropicana advertising dur
ing football games.
On the East Coast, football games
start at 1 p.m. and 4 p.m., which allows
you to have a productive morning be
fore plopping on the couch all after
noon. And if you're the tailgating type,
you can have quite the epic day leading

up to a 4 p.m. local start. Out West, you
are stuck on the couch through almost
all of the daylight hours especially if
you want to watch Sunday Night Foot
ball. If you want to tailgate you'd better
be an early riser.
Which brings me to my next point
night games. The biggest argument
against East Coast sporting events is
how late you sometimes have to stay
up to see the ends of games. At least
you have the choice to stay up and
watch. On the West Coast, Monday
Night Football, playoff games in the
NBA,NFIL and Major League Base
ball, as well as college football bowl
games and college basketball games,
all start while much of the population
is still in its offices or en route home
from work. People literally can't
watch the games without ditching
work.
Imagine being a San Francisco Gi
ants fan who could not watch the
World Series games that started
around 5 p.m. local time because of
work. This was the case for plenty of
"diehard" fans, I am sure. If given a
choice to have the game start after
work and being allowed to decide
whether to stay up for the end, I'm sure
almost all Giants fans would accept
that option.
Meanwhile, fans of the Texas
Rangers, in Central Time, could enjoy
the 7 p.m. start and decide whether or
not to stay up for the game's finish. I
would always rather have the choice
than to have my hand forced.
Since this is catered to a college
crowd, let's think about sleep sched
ules for a second. I'm betting more of
you are likely to be awake at mid
night or 12:30 a.m., when the latest

games on the East Coast normal
ly Monday Night Football end,
than 9 a.m. on Saturdays when the
first college football games often
begin.
When it comes to the NFL, waking
up for 10 a.m. games is hard enough for
many West Coasters, especially us col
lege-aged folks. 1 p.m. is less of a strug
gle, I'd say.
NCAA basketball tournament
games may be the most difficult, ac
tually. Unlike many of the college
football games that start early in the
morning, and the NFL games at 10
a.m. which many West Coasters may
not be interested in, every game of
the NCAA Tournament matters to
many fans (at least those that filled
out a bracket). These games start
early in the day, and can often in
clude West Coast teams. When I was
a freshman (when dinosaurs roamed
the Earth) Stanford played
Louisville in the first round of the
NCAA Tournament at 9:30 a.m.
PST! It was terrible for us fans, and
awful for the team, who looked
asleep while getting blown off the
court by Louisville.
The early-morning effect on travel
ing West Coast teams is well-docu
mented (just ask the 2009 Stanford
football team about its trip to Wake
Forest), so I won't dwell on that too
long. I will just say that whatever
makes players tired also makes fans
tired.
Like I said before, there is a happy
medium, which those Rangers fans
enjoy. People knock the middle of the
country, but when it comes to sports
viewing there is probably no better
place. Still, push me to choose and it is
East over West any day.

Eastern Standard Time.
The sports Gods (also known as the
commissioners of the major sports
leagues) maximize viewership by en
suring that games start at primetime on
the East Coast the West is merely an
afterthought.
I have had the Eastern time versus
Western time conversation (argu
ment?) with enough Califomians since
moving here from New York to under
stand the merits of both sides and to
be honest, I think the ideal time zone
for sports viewing is the Central Time
Zone and I have decided that East
is definitely better than West.
Let me start by posing a question.
What do you like to eat while watching
NFL games? Bar food I believe would
be a pretty standard answer to that
question chicken wings, burgers, na
chos, etc. Flowever, that doesn't sound
all that appetizing at 10 a.m. Football is
not made for waffles and pancakes.
Take it a step further. What do you
want to drink while watching football?
There is a reason there are countless
beer commercials during football
games beer is the beverage of
choice. Do you want a tasty cold one at
10 a.m.? (Don't answer that question.)
I don't see Tropicana advertising dur
ing football games.
On the East Coast, football games
start at 1 p.m. and 4 p.m., which allows
you to have a productive morning be
fore plopping on the couch all after
noon. And if you're the tailgating type,
you can have quite the epic day leading

up to a 4 p.m. local start. Out West, you
are stuck on the couch through almost
all of the daylight hours especially if
you want to watch Sunday Night Foot
ball. If you want to tailgate you'd better
be an early riser.
Which brings me to my next point
night games. The biggest argument
against East Coast sporting events is
how late you sometimes have to stay
up to see the ends of games. At least
you have the choice to stay up and
watch. On the West Coast, Monday
Night Football, playoff games in the
NBA,NFIL and Major League Base
ball, as well as college football bowl
games and college basketball games,
all start while much of the population
is still in its offices or en route home
from work. People literally can't
watch the games without ditching
work.
Imagine being a San Francisco Gi
ants fan who could not watch the
World Series games that started
around 5 p.m. local time because of
work. This was the case for plenty of
"diehard" fans, I am sure. If given a
choice to have the game start after
work and being allowed to decide
whether to stay up for the end, I'm sure
almost all Giants fans would accept
that option.
Meanwhile, fans of the Texas
Rangers, in Central Time, could enjoy
the 7 p.m. start and decide whether or
not to stay up for the game's finish. I
would always rather have the choice
than to have my hand forced.
Since this is catered to a college
crowd, let's think about sleep sched
ules for a second. I'm betting more of
you are likely to be awake at mid
night or 12:30 a.m., when the latest

games on the East Coast normal
ly Monday Night Football end,
than 9 a.m. on Saturdays when the
first college football games often
begin.
When it comes to the NFL, waking
up for 10 a.m. games is hard enough for
many West Coasters, especially us col
lege-aged folks. 1 p.m. is less of a strug
gle, I'd say.
NCAA basketball tournament
games may be the most difficult, ac
tually. Unlike many of the college
football games that start early in the
morning, and the NFL games at 10
a.m. which many West Coasters may
not be interested in, every game of
the NCAA Tournament matters to
many fans (at least those that filled
out a bracket). These games start
early in the day, and can often in
clude West Coast teams. When I was
a freshman (when dinosaurs roamed
the Earth) Stanford played
Louisville in the first round of the
NCAA Tournament at 9:30 a.m.
PST! It was terrible for us fans, and
awful for the team, who looked
asleep while getting blown off the
court by Louisville.
The early-morning effect on travel
ing West Coast teams is well-docu
mented (just ask the 2009 Stanford
football team about its trip to Wake
Forest), so I won't dwell on that too
long. I will just say that whatever
makes players tired also makes fans
tired.
Like I said before, there is a happy
medium, which those Rangers fans
enjoy. People knock the middle of the
country, but when it comes to sports
viewing there is probably no better
place. Still, push me to choose and it is
East over West any day.
