# Sports are best viewed in EST

### Daniel Bohm On My Mind 
West Coasters like to
complain that there
is an East Coast bias
in sports. Want to
know why that is?
It's because the sports world ticks on
Eastern Standard Time.
The sports Gods (also known as the
commissioners of the major sports
leagues) maximize viewership by en
suring that games start at primetime on
the East Coast the West is merely an
afterthought.
I have had the Eastern time versus
Western time conversation (argu
ment?) with enough Califomians since
moving here from New York to under
stand the merits of both sides and to
be honest, I think the ideal time zone
for sports viewing is the Central Time
Zone and I have decided that East
is definitely better than West.
Let me start by posing a question.
What do you like to eat while watching
NFL games? Bar food I believe would
be a pretty standard answer to that
question chicken wings, burgers, na
chos, etc. Flowever, that doesn't sound
all that appetizing at 10 a.m. Football is
not made for waffles and pancakes.
Take it a step further. What do you
want to drink while watching football?
There is a reason there are countless
beer commercials during football
games beer is the beverage of
choice. Do you want a tasty cold one at
10 a.m.? (Don't answer that question.)
I don't see Tropicana advertising dur
ing football games.
On the East Coast, football games
start at 1 p.m. and 4 p.m., which allows
you to have a productive morning be
fore plopping on the couch all after
noon. And if you're the tailgating type,
you can have quite the epic day leading
