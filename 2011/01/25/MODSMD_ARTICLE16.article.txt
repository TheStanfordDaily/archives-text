The West Coast is clearly
better than the East Coast.
And it can't be better un
less it's better for sports
fandom.

Of course, I should preface this ar
gument by saying that I've lived my
whole life on the West Coast. Duh. But
really, is that so bad for my argument?
I've lived in a wonderful place for
watching sports, and every time I leave,
I'm reminded of how great I have it.
When I'm not living at the greatest
campus in the world watching Stan
ford win Directors' Cup after Direc
tors' Cup, I live in southern California,
in an area that a few years ago came to
be known as "The 0.C." but which is
known to people more commonly as
"south of Los Angeles" or "near Dis
neyland." Living in this area has al
lowed me to enjoy one of the most un
derrated qualities of sports fandom
not having a local NFL team.
While there is no logical explana
tion for Jacksonville having a team in
the most popular sport in the country
but the second-largest city in America
getting shut out, the bright side to this
weirdness has manifested itself in tel
evision coverage. While Bay Area fans
are shackled to 49ers-Cardinals and
Raiders-Broncos and Florida resi
dents have to see Jaguars-Titans and
Dolphins-Bills, those of us in No
Man's Land get Pats-Colts and Steel
ers-Saints. So what that there's not a
local team? I get to see the best games
every weekend and I can choose my
favorite team (I chose the Colts about
a decade ago because I liked watching
them play, and I haven't wavered).
But anyway, this is about West

Coast vs. East Coast, not just about me.
The fact is, I can babble about whatev
er I want, because the West Coast is so
clearly better for sports fandom. For
get getting to watch Western teams in
stead of Eastern teams. The overall ex
perience of being a sports fan on the
West Coast is much better than the
same experience on the East Coast.
Take football, which is the most
popular and important sport in
America. Here on the West Coast, my
entire weekend is built on football.
When I wake up on Saturday, college
football has begun, and I can stay in
my pajamas all day long watching 9
a.m. Big Ten games, 12:30 and 3:30 na
tional games, 7 p.m. Pac-10 games and
then have the late night to go have fun
with other people and go to parties
(which for me clearly means watching
several rounds of highlights of all the
games I just watched while never
changing out of said pajamas, leaving
the room or socializing).
The next morning, I can start the
cycle all over again. The first NFL
games start at 10 a.m., meaning I can
certainly make myself get up for
them, but if I'm not that interested, I
can sleep in and watch the second
half. Either way, I get to grab lunch in
between games and then watch the
afternoon games before Sunday
Night Football with dinner. Once
that's over, I have to come to the real
ization that the weekend is over, but I
still have plenty of time for the whole
weekend's worth of homework.
But of course, the weekend isn't
completely over, because the next day
brings another great tradition din

ner and Monday Night Football. You
can watch with your family when
you're at home, and you can watch
surrounded by friends at school. It re
ally is the reward for making it
through a Monday.
So let's quickly look at how this all
changes if you're on the East Coast.
You get to wake up, and then wait.
While a few people (myself on a good
day included) can easily sleep until
noon or I p.m., the majority of people
wake up in the morning on a week
end. What kind of weekend starts with
waiting? Sure, watching pregame
shows can be fun, but it's certainly not
the same as nonstop football. So after
you've waited for a few hours and got
ten bored with the weekend, you can
start your afternoon with football.
Starting in the afternoon? Weird.
After you've watched the main
games through dinner and after, you
decide you want to do something else
with your day, and you therefore miss
the West Coast games. (This is the part
where you don't give Pac-10 teams
credit and you call them soft without
ever seeing them play.) The next day,
you get to start your day off with even
more waiting, and then watch a cou
ple games before Sunday Night Foot
ball.Then what? Watch until midnight
and then actually have nothing else to
do with the weekend? Sounds less
fun. But at least it's not Monday, when
you have to stay up past midnight to
make it through Monday Night Foot
ball. If you're talking general audi
ence, there's no way 12:30 a.m. makes
more sense for kids, working adults or
the elderly, just to name a few groups.
But the world is not just football.
Let's look at other sports. Generally,
most sports are played in so-called
"primetime." That means many big
time games start between 7 and 9 p.m.
local time. So if you're on the West

Coast, you get games starting from 4
to 7 or 8 p.m., which gives you a whole
evening of basketball or baseball or
whatever you like. On the East Coast,
everything gets shifted over, so you
don't get any real games until after
dinner, and if you go to bed at any rea
sonable time, you miss the end of a lot
of big games, and you're not even
around for the start of many West
Coast games.
I feel like Sports Center can sum
marize the entire superiority of sports
fandom on the West Coast. My whole
life has revolved around the timing of
Sports Center, and it works perfectly
for someone on the West Coast. I
could wake up to Sports Center, find
the early updates and previews right
after school, see the highlights of the
first games after dinner and then get
the final wrap-up before bed. On the
East Coast, nothing has happened be
fore the morning Sports Center, so
you're just watching to see highlights
of all the games you didn't watch the
day before because you live on the
East Coast. Then, you can't see much
of anything until dinner time's pre
views. Right before bed (unless you're
routinely up past 1 a.m., which plenty
of college students aren't, let alone the
rest of the country) you get the first
round of highlights, and the final
round of games is still far from over.
It all comes down to this: would
you rather have all day to watch
sports and get to see every game live,
or would you rather wait a few hours
until games start and wait until the
next morning to find out what hap
pens in the night games?

into the Orange Bowl, his only East
Coast sports watching experience.

several rounds of highlights of all the
games I just watched while never
changing out of said pajamas, leaving
the room or socializing).
The next morning, I can start the
cycle all over again. The first NFL
games start at 10 a.m., meaning I can
certainly make myself get up for
them, but if I'm not that interested, I
can sleep in and watch the second
half. Either way, I get to grab lunch in
between games and then watch the
afternoon games before Sunday
Night Football with dinner. Once
that's over, I have to come to the real
ization that the weekend is over, but I
still have plenty of time for the whole
weekend's worth of homework.
But of course, the weekend isn't
completely over, because the next day
brings another great tradition din

ner and Monday Night Football. You
can watch with your family when
you're at home, and you can watch
surrounded by friends at school. It re
ally is the reward for making it
through a Monday.
So let's quickly look at how this all
changes if you're on the East Coast.
You get to wake up, and then wait.
While a few people (myself on a good
day included) can easily sleep until
noon or I p.m., the majority of people
wake up in the morning on a week
end. What kind of weekend starts with
waiting? Sure, watching pregame
shows can be fun, but it's certainly not
the same as nonstop football. So after
you've waited for a few hours and got
ten bored with the weekend, you can
start your afternoon with football.
Starting in the afternoon? Weird.
After you've watched the main
games through dinner and after, you
decide you want to do something else
with your day, and you therefore miss
the West Coast games. (This is the part
where you don't give Pac-10 teams
credit and you call them soft without
ever seeing them play.) The next day,
you get to start your day off with even
more waiting, and then watch a cou
ple games before Sunday Night Foot
ball.Then what? Watch until midnight
and then actually have nothing else to
do with the weekend? Sounds less
fun. But at least it's not Monday, when
you have to stay up past midnight to
make it through Monday Night Foot
ball. If you're talking general audi
ence, there's no way 12:30 a.m. makes
more sense for kids, working adults or
the elderly, just to name a few groups.
But the world is not just football.
Let's look at other sports. Generally,
most sports are played in so-called
"primetime." That means many big
time games start between 7 and 9 p.m.
local time. So if you're on the West

Coast, you get games starting from 4
to 7 or 8 p.m., which gives you a whole
evening of basketball or baseball or
whatever you like. On the East Coast,
everything gets shifted over, so you
don't get any real games until after
dinner, and if you go to bed at any rea
sonable time, you miss the end of a lot
of big games, and you're not even
around for the start of many West
Coast games.
I feel like Sports Center can sum
marize the entire superiority of sports
fandom on the West Coast. My whole
life has revolved around the timing of
Sports Center, and it works perfectly
for someone on the West Coast. I
could wake up to Sports Center, find
the early updates and previews right
after school, see the highlights of the
first games after dinner and then get
the final wrap-up before bed. On the
East Coast, nothing has happened be
fore the morning Sports Center, so
you're just watching to see highlights
of all the games you didn't watch the
day before because you live on the
East Coast. Then, you can't see much
of anything until dinner time's pre
views. Right before bed (unless you're
routinely up past 1 a.m., which plenty
of college students aren't, let alone the
rest of the country) you get the first
round of highlights, and the final
round of games is still far from over.
It all comes down to this: would
you rather have all day to watch
sports and get to see every game live,
or would you rather wait a few hours
until games start and wait until the
next morning to find out what hap
pens in the night games?

into the Orange Bowl, his only East
Coast sports watching experience.

The West Coast is clearly
better than the East Coast.
And it can't be better un
less it's better for sports
fandom.

Of course, I should preface this ar
gument by saying that I've lived my
whole life on the West Coast. Duh. But
really, is that so bad for my argument?
I've lived in a wonderful place for
watching sports, and every time I leave,
I'm reminded of how great I have it.
When I'm not living at the greatest
campus in the world watching Stan
ford win Directors' Cup after Direc
tors' Cup, I live in southern California,
in an area that a few years ago came to
be known as "The 0.C." but which is
known to people more commonly as
"south of Los Angeles" or "near Dis
neyland." Living in this area has al
lowed me to enjoy one of the most un
derrated qualities of sports fandom
not having a local NFL team.
While there is no logical explana
tion for Jacksonville having a team in
the most popular sport in the country
but the second-largest city in America
getting shut out, the bright side to this
weirdness has manifested itself in tel
evision coverage. While Bay Area fans
are shackled to 49ers-Cardinals and
Raiders-Broncos and Florida resi
dents have to see Jaguars-Titans and
Dolphins-Bills, those of us in No
Man's Land get Pats-Colts and Steel
ers-Saints. So what that there's not a
local team? I get to see the best games
every weekend and I can choose my
favorite team (I chose the Colts about
a decade ago because I liked watching
them play, and I haven't wavered).
But anyway, this is about West

Coast vs. East Coast, not just about me.
The fact is, I can babble about whatev
er I want, because the West Coast is so
clearly better for sports fandom. For
get getting to watch Western teams in
stead of Eastern teams. The overall ex
perience of being a sports fan on the
West Coast is much better than the
same experience on the East Coast.
Take football, which is the most
popular and important sport in
America. Here on the West Coast, my
entire weekend is built on football.
When I wake up on Saturday, college
football has begun, and I can stay in
my pajamas all day long watching 9
a.m. Big Ten games, 12:30 and 3:30 na
tional games, 7 p.m. Pac-10 games and
then have the late night to go have fun
with other people and go to parties
(which for me clearly means watching
several rounds of highlights of all the
games I just watched while never
changing out of said pajamas, leaving
the room or socializing).
The next morning, I can start the
