The West Coast is clearly
better than the East Coast.
And it can't be better un
less it's better for sports
fandom.

Of course, I should preface this ar
gument by saying that I've lived my
whole life on the West Coast. Duh. But
really, is that so bad for my argument?
I've lived in a wonderful place for
watching sports, and every time I leave,
I'm reminded of how great I have it.
When I'm not living at the greatest
campus in the world watching Stan
ford win Directors' Cup after Direc
tors' Cup, I live in southern California,
in an area that a few years ago came to
be known as "The 0.C." but which is
known to people more commonly as
"south of Los Angeles" or "near Dis
neyland." Living in this area has al
lowed me to enjoy one of the most un
derrated qualities of sports fandom
not having a local NFL team.
While there is no logical explana
tion for Jacksonville having a team in
the most popular sport in the country
but the second-largest city in America
getting shut out, the bright side to this
weirdness has manifested itself in tel
evision coverage. While Bay Area fans
are shackled to 49ers-Cardinals and
Raiders-Broncos and Florida resi
dents have to see Jaguars-Titans and
Dolphins-Bills, those of us in No
Man's Land get Pats-Colts and Steel
ers-Saints. So what that there's not a
local team? I get to see the best games
every weekend and I can choose my
favorite team (I chose the Colts about
a decade ago because I liked watching
them play, and I haven't wavered).
But anyway, this is about West
