# Examining the Middle East
## Stanford's academic offerings grow slowly 
### ELLORA ISRANI STAFF WRITER 
Years after American interest in the Mid
dle East began to experience a dramatic
resurgence with the U.S. invasions of Iraq
and Afghanistan, Stanford is still racing to
create a Middle Eastern studies program
comparable to those of its peer institutions.
The University does not offer a degree
granting program in Middle Eastern studies.
Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and UC-Berkeley
all do.
"About two years ago we had an external
review a team from Princeton, Indiana
and Chicago come in and lay out a road
map for developing our program in this
area," said Richard Sailer, dean of the School
of Humanities and Sciences.
Two major improvements were the cre
ation of the Abbasi Program in Islamic Stud
ies and the Program in Iranian Studies in
2005 and 2007, respectively. The University
also recently launched a certificate program
in Iranian studies and is in the process of hir
ing a second Middle East historian. Chal
lenges have precluded further expansion,
however.

"The truth is we have not added the fac
ulty as quickly as we'd hoped because the
recession really put a break on fundraising,
and we need to raise additional funds in
order to fund additional faculty positions,"

Sailer said.
In order to "'put a strong foundation"
under a degree-granting Middle Eastern
studies program, the University would re
quire an eight-figure gift, Sailer added.
This race to catch up with the programs
offered by peer institutions raises the ques
tion: why did Stanford not develop its Middle
Eastern studies program when others did so?
"I think several decades ago, Stanford
decided to concentrate on the Soviet Union
and Eastern Europe and leave the Middle

East to other major universities," said
Abbas Milani, director of the Program in
Iranian Studies. "For a while, they seemed
to have made the right choice. That was
where it was happening. With the fall of
the Soviet Union, the tectonic plates
shifted, and Stanford decided to play
catch-up."

Despite Stanford's lack of a cen
tralized, degree-granting program,
it does offer courses, particularly
in contemporary Middle-East
ern politics, that are unique.
"We have multiple people
teaching classes on modern Iran ..
. and also people who are willing to
teach classes on the Arab-Israeli
conflict," said political science pro
fessor Lisa Blaydes. "Professors in
Middle Eastern politics at other in
stitutions are not willing to really

deal with those issues head-on, so in many
ways we offer more breadth than some of our
peer institutions."
"Stanford may not ever get to the point
where we have as large a collection of people
working on the Middle East from a historical
perspective," Blaydes added, "but we do
