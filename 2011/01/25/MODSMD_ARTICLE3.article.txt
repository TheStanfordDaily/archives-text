# SPEAKERS & EVENTS
## O'Brien talks writing, war Discusses Vietnam, power of literature 
### CAROLINE CHEN STAFF WRITER 
"I went to war kicking and
screaming," confessed novelist Tim
O'Brien to the crowd at Cubberley
Auditorium on Monday night.
The celebrated writer, best
known for his Vietnam War ac
counts in award-winning novels
"Going After Cacciato" and "The
Things They Carried," delved into
his personal experience with war
and discussed the ethics of writing
about war with Stanford professor
and novelist Tobias Wolff during his
Stanford visit yesterday.
Despite his resistance to being
drafted during the Vietnam War,
O'Brien said he believes he has an
obligation to write about his experi
ences, and that literature has the
power to confront and examine hor
rific events such as war.
The discussion touched on the
issue of "aestheticizing" human suf
fering by writing novels about war.
"If to make aesthetic an ugly sit
uation is corrupt, then there would
probably be no literature," O'Brien
said. "Literature is the meditation of
being human, and human beings,
unlike gophers or chipmunks, are
aware of tragedy and horror. To dive
into that wreck as a writer and try to
salvage something beautiful can
make the horror float and allow a
character to confront it. I don't think
that's a bad thing."
O'Brien encouraged writers not
to recycle the cliches and conven
tions of war stories.
"Press it beyond the killing and
dying," he urged. "Those stakes are
obviously very high, but there are
higher stakes of morality. What is the
role of conscience in a democratic
society? What does it matter if we in
vade Toronto tomorrow, if the ma
jority of people agree to it? Is there
a point at which you say, 'No, I'm not
going to shoot that old guy. I'm not
going to go to war,' or is it just, 'Yes,
sir, we're going to kill Canadians to
morrow'? To test oneself that way as

a writer is important."
O'Brien admitted that some
times readers interpret his books in
a manner contrary to his original in
tention, citing the example of a
young man who decided to join the
Army after reading his novels, de
spite O'Brien's intention to warn
people about the "pettiness and hor
rors of war" in his works.
"The consequences of what we
write, we're not in control of," he
said. "We're trying to write good
sentences with some beauty. That's

what we can do. We can't control
that that kid out in the hallway that
uses [the book] to march off and do
bad stuff-
In the course of the conversation,
O'Brien and Wolff covered contro
versial issues such as terrorism and
the draft. O'Brien was critical of
what he perceives as an indifference
among Americans today to U.S. in
volvement in Afghanistan and Iraq.
"What do you die for? What do
you kill for?" O'Brien said. "Those
questions have become less relevant

to our discourse now than they were
[during the Vietnam War], Not a lot
of people worry about there not
being weapons of mass destructions
found in Iraq. Forty years ago, that
would have broken hearts."
One cause of this apparent indif
ference, Wolff proposed, might be
the lack of a draft, suggesting that
since military service is now volun
tary, people who are unaffected
take less interest in the motivations

"If to make aesthetic an ugly situation is corrupt, then
there would probably be no literature."

for war.
"If that wolf is not at the door and
your son or your daughter is not
being dragged to war, it can be
pushed aside," O'Brien said, though
he added he was personally conflict
ed over whether the draft should re
turn or not.
Both Wolff and O 'Brien evaded a
question from a veteran in the audi
ence who suggested that a selective
draft be instituted at Stanford and
other elite institutions in order to
give future leaders the experience of
combat.
O'Brien responded to a question
about coping with post-traumatic
stress disorder with what he ac
knowledged would be an unpopular
response.
"I worry that there is not enough
trauma," he said. "We as humans

tend to heal too well and quickly and
thoroughly. I think you are nuts if
you come back from what I went
through and don't have late-night
anxiety. If you don't have anger is
sues, I think you're crazy. You're not
human. I think that one of the ways
to deal with trauma is to be trauma
tized ... to acknowledge that it
hurt."
O'Brien concluded the evening
by reminding his audience that the
potential of literature should not be
underestimated.
"Literature is not this docile lap
dog," he said. "It can do things that
are real in human lives. It is power
ful."
O'Brien will give a reading Tues
day night at Cubberley Auditorium,
completing the Raymond Fred West
Memorial Lecture Series. The series
is organized by the Stanford Human
ities Center and the Center for
Ethics in Society.

potential of literature should not be

"I went to war kicking and
screaming," confessed novelist Tim
O'Brien to the crowd at Cubberley
Auditorium on Monday night.
The celebrated writer, best
known for his Vietnam War ac
counts in award-winning novels
"Going After Cacciato" and "The
Things They Carried," delved into
his personal experience with war
and discussed the ethics of writing
about war with Stanford professor
and novelist Tobias Wolff during his
Stanford visit yesterday.
Despite his resistance to being
drafted during the Vietnam War,
O'Brien said he believes he has an
obligation to write about his experi
ences, and that literature has the
power to confront and examine hor
rific events such as war.
The discussion touched on the
issue of "aestheticizing" human suf
fering by writing novels about war.
"If to make aesthetic an ugly sit
uation is corrupt, then there would
probably be no literature," O'Brien
said. "Literature is the meditation of
being human, and human beings,
unlike gophers or chipmunks, are
aware of tragedy and horror. To dive
into that wreck as a writer and try to
salvage something beautiful can
make the horror float and allow a
character to confront it. I don't think
that's a bad thing."
O'Brien encouraged writers not
to recycle the cliches and conven
tions of war stories.
"Press it beyond the killing and
dying," he urged. "Those stakes are
obviously very high, but there are
higher stakes of morality. What is the
role of conscience in a democratic
society? What does it matter if we in
vade Toronto tomorrow, if the ma
jority of people agree to it? Is there
a point at which you say, 'No, I'm not
going to shoot that old guy. I'm not
going to go to war,' or is it just, 'Yes,
sir, we're going to kill Canadians to
morrow'? To test oneself that way as

a writer is important."
O'Brien admitted that some
times readers interpret his books in
a manner contrary to his original in
tention, citing the example of a
young man who decided to join the
Army after reading his novels, de
spite O'Brien's intention to warn
people about the "pettiness and hor
rors of war" in his works.
"The consequences of what we
write, we're not in control of," he
said. "We're trying to write good
sentences with some beauty. That's

what we can do. We can't control
that that kid out in the hallway that
uses [the book] to march off and do
bad stuff-
In the course of the conversation,
O'Brien and Wolff covered contro
versial issues such as terrorism and
the draft. O'Brien was critical of
what he perceives as an indifference
among Americans today to U.S. in
volvement in Afghanistan and Iraq.
"What do you die for? What do
you kill for?" O'Brien said. "Those
questions have become less relevant

to our discourse now than they were
[during the Vietnam War], Not a lot
of people worry about there not
being weapons of mass destructions
found in Iraq. Forty years ago, that
would have broken hearts."
One cause of this apparent indif
ference, Wolff proposed, might be
the lack of a draft, suggesting that
since military service is now volun
tary, people who are unaffected
take less interest in the motivations

"If to make aesthetic an ugly situation is corrupt, then
there would probably be no literature."

for war.
"If that wolf is not at the door and
your son or your daughter is not
being dragged to war, it can be
pushed aside," O'Brien said, though
he added he was personally conflict
ed over whether the draft should re
turn or not.
Both Wolff and O 'Brien evaded a
question from a veteran in the audi
ence who suggested that a selective
draft be instituted at Stanford and
other elite institutions in order to
give future leaders the experience of
combat.
O'Brien responded to a question
about coping with post-traumatic
stress disorder with what he ac
knowledged would be an unpopular
response.
"I worry that there is not enough
trauma," he said. "We as humans

tend to heal too well and quickly and
thoroughly. I think you are nuts if
you come back from what I went
through and don't have late-night
anxiety. If you don't have anger is
sues, I think you're crazy. You're not
human. I think that one of the ways
to deal with trauma is to be trauma
tized ... to acknowledge that it
