## SIG adds Qatar fellowship Brookings Doha Center to host students 
### MARWA FARAG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford in Government (SIG)
has announced the addition of an in
ternational fellowship with the
Brookings Doha Center, a project of
the Brookings Institution, in Doha,
Qatar to its lineup of fellowships for
the upcoming summer.
The Doha fellowship, one of six
new additions to the lineup, was cre
ated in response to high student de
mand for travel opportunities in the
Middle East. Security concerns have
long prevented Stanford organiza
tions from sponsoring travel to the
Middle East, but for many, Qatar
presents an exciting foothold for fur
ther opportunities in the region.
"Qatar is one of the safest coun
tries in the region," said Abbas Mi
lani, director of Iranian Studies and
faculty mentor for the new fellow
ship. Its advantages include proximi
ty and immersion in Islamic culture
and it "is increasingly becoming a
center of cultural activity," he said.
"There's a significant lack of Mid
dle East experiences available for
students, and this is one of the first
steps towards changing that," said
Andrew Linford *ll, SIG director of
international fellowships.
Indeed, Middle East studies has
been an arena in which Stanford has
lagged.
"Some universities have had Mid
dle East study programs for almost
800 years in Europe. Some American
universities have had such programs
for 70 or 80 years," Milani said. "We
are playing catch-up. But there is
leadership at Stanford dedicated to
making sure this gap is filled."
SIG partnered with the Center on
Democracy, Development and the
Rule of Law (CDDRL) to arrange
the fellowship. SIG, a student group,
relies on feedback from past fellows
to help the organization figure out
where it can "plug holes" in the op
portunities available on campus.
"Initial communication with the
institution is initiated through our
faculty advisors," said Valentin Bolot
nyy 'll, chair of SIG. Using e-mail
communication primarily, a fellow
ship is created after committee mem
bers research the institution and a
faculty member vets the arrange
ments. SIG allocates a stipend to the
fellow, adjusted based on the needs of
the particular fellowship, with the in
tention of covering all expenses for
the nine-week duration.
The Doha fellowship requires
proficiency in Arabic, a requirement
that Milani believes will "boost the
quality of the students and make it
more possible for the fellowship to
be fruitful."
Bolotnyy and Linford agreed that
a background in the Arabic language
would enable the fellow to benefit
the most from the experience,
adding that given the applicants' in
terest in Middle East affairs, the lan

guage requirement should not pose a
problem to most of them.
The goal of the fellowship is to
conduct "significant research" on
"all the issues happening in the Mid
dle East, and how U.S. politics and
policies relate to these issues," Bolot
nyy said.
Elliot Stoller 'l3, a second-year
Arabic student, described the fellow
ship in an e-mail to The Daily as "an
amazing and unique opportunity to
learn about the Middle East through
both policy research and cultural im
mersion."
"Our fellows will have to rely on
their own efforts, there is very little
beaten path they can walk on," Mi
lani said. "That's one of the chal
lenges and one of the advantages of
working on the Middle East... al
most the whole arena can be a poten
tial subject for new, innovative re
search."
"If you go to D.C., there's so much
that's been written on how the
American government works," Mi
lani said. "But if you're going to the
Middle East you have to be a little bit
of an explorer. You have to have the
adventurism, bravura, curiosity and
dedication of an explorer."
