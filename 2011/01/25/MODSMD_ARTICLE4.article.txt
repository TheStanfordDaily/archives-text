## SIG adds Qatar fellowship Brookings Doha Center to host students 
### MARWA FARAG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford in Government (SIG)
has announced the addition of an in
ternational fellowship with the
Brookings Doha Center, a project of
the Brookings Institution, in Doha,
Qatar to its lineup of fellowships for
the upcoming summer.
The Doha fellowship, one of six
new additions to the lineup, was cre

mand for travel opportunities in the
Middle East. Security concerns have
long prevented Stanford organiza

Middle East, but for many, Qatar
presents an exciting foothold for fur

"Qatar is one of the safest coun
tries in the region," said Abbas Mi
lani, director of Iranian Studies and
faculty mentor for the new fellow
ship. Its advantages include proximi
ty and immersion in Islamic culture
and it "is increasingly becoming a
center of cultural activity," he said.
"There's a significant lack of Mid
dle East experiences available for
students, and this is one of the first
steps towards changing that," said
Andrew Linford *ll, SIG director of
international fellowships.
Indeed, Middle East studies has
been an arena in which Stanford has
lagged.
"Some universities have had Mid
dle East study programs for almost
800 years in Europe. Some American
universities have had such programs
for 70 or 80 years," Milani said. "We
are playing catch-up. But there is
leadership at Stanford dedicated to
making sure this gap is filled."
SIG partnered with the Center on
Democracy, Development and the
Rule of Law (CDDRL) to arrange
the fellowship. SIG, a student group,
