## PALO ALTO Students weigh in on restaurants, prices and entertainment 
### MARWA FARAG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
It's been named the most expensive col
lege town in the U.S., used as the setting
for James Franco's collection of short
stories (aptly named "Palo Alto") and
spawned IT giants like Hewlett-
Packard. Stanford's answer to New Haven
and Cambridge, Palo Alto is the first step out
side the bubble where people don't speak in
acronyms ("Wanna meet at TAP after
PWR?") and Cardinal Dollars do not equal
money.
But pinning down the precise Stanford-
Palo Alto relationship has always proven dif
ficult. Some indicator came this fall, when
Coldwell Banker Real Estate put the Univer
sity's suburban neighbor at the top of its
"most expensive" list. And today, students
and locals alike have plenty of opinions to
proffer.

Despite the
city's focus on
its older popu
lation, student
filled Stanford
remains a cen
tral element of
Palo Alto's
identity. Stan
ford is the top
employer in
the city, and its
members, from
students to ad
ministration,
constitute a
large portion
of the con
sumer market.

Erin Browner, store manager at the Amer
ican Apparel store on University Avenue, ex
plained how vital Stanford students are to the
business.

"At least one
third of the
shoppers are stu
dents," she said.
"Stanford stu
dents are so
much fun. We
get students who
are frequent
shoppers and we
love helping
them put togeth
er outfits for par
ties and events."
Alan Garcia,
a manager at
Celia's, a Mex
ican restau
rant and bar

on El Camino Real, agreed.
"About 20 percent of our customers are
from Stanford," Garcia said. "Once a month,
usually, a large group of Stanford students

come in, and we have special hours for them
like staying open later than usual. We love
having Stanford students here."
But many students aren't feeling the love.
"I don't feel like it's a thriving college
town," said Rob Blount 'l2. "It's more for rich
people, there are the Stanford graduates who
live there, but you don't have the kind of sup
port you get at a state school."
Palo Alto can certainly stretch the student
budget. For some students, the high prices are a
deal-breaker, but students like Jujjhaar Singh
'l4, a Palo Alto native, know how to cope.
"It's kind of cumbersome that it's so ex
pensive, but that's not going to stop people
from going out," he said. "There are libraries,
a bowling alley, an art museum, a theatre and
an ice skating rink in Palo Alto, and it's easy to
take a train to San Francisco."
And some students have learned to search
for deals.
