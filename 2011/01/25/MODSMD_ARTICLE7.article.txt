# OPINIONS
## CONTINUED On Columns 
### Jade Wang 
Atypical Sunday afternoon: I
sit at my computer and
mentally run through my
week, desperately hoping that I
did or thought something interest
ing. Sometimes, if I'm lucky, I'll
have already written myself a note
somewhere about a promising
thought or topic that I want to turn
into a column, but let's be honest
it's the end of the volume, I've
written a number of columns and
sometimes the well of possible
topics runs dry. (Meta-column, if
you were curious, is one I have
wanted to write for a while but
have been saving until now.)
Sometimes, there are crises. I have
started columns only to decide
that they are unfit for general con
sumption. I have stared at my
blank Word document for ages and
begun to panic that I may, in fact,
be an unbearably boring person
with nothing to say to the Stanford
community. A few times, I have
brainstormed myself to sleep, only
to wake from my slumber in the
middle of the night to groggily
write an outline that never makes
any sense in the morning.
Post-brainstorm, I write, with
frequent breaks, until I have a de
cent first draft and then promptly
fall asleep. Monday rolls around,
and I slowly make edits, occasion
ally in the middle of lecture. I pass
my final draft on, and it's out of
my hands for the rest of the day.
Sometimes, in my nervousness, I
hastily read (or reread) all the
other columns from the past week.
Tuesday rolls around, and ei
ther I completely forget that it's
publication day, or I wander
around looking awkward and
sheepish. My friends always find
something nice to say about this
week's column, and I occasionally
regale them with overly detailed
stories about the convoluted
thought processes I had while
writing it. The best part is receiv
ing e-mailed reader responses
from people I don't know. It's
hard to describe the giddiness and
anticipation before I open the e
mail. No matter what it says, I'm
always overjoyed that I've some
how managed to make a writer-to
reader connection while blather
ing on about my own life, and I
usually announce my glee about it

to whoever is in the same room as
I am.
My roommates used to indulge
me and display copies of The
Daily on our coffee table, casually
opened to my picture. My parents
used to send me adorable e-mails
about how they didn't know that I
liked to write. I'll be honest; the
approval made me beam with de
light, but more than a few weeks
of this would have made me un
comfortable. Now, we're all pretty
used to the routine. Sunday rolls
around, and I wrack my brain for
another topic that I think might
hold vague interest. My friends no
longer have any suggestions. On
Tuesdays, I've stopped furtively
looking through my own column
when I see the printed copy to see
which sentence has been chosen
for the highlight. Once, I forgot
what I had written about that
week and panicked a little when I
needed to respond to a comment
in person.
It's not a bleak situation,
though. It feels familiar, and I think
that we are closer than we were in
September, dear reader. We have
been through a lot together, you
and I, by which I mean, you may or
may not have read a number of
short pieces I have written about
my life for you. I now readily share
my more embarrassing habits and
thoughts and trust that you will find
it quirky instead of horrifying. So,
this is my thank-you to you. True to
style, the bulk of it is my talking
about myself doing something fair
ly normal as if it were actually pro
found, but this appears to have
worked for us so far. I'm glad to
have had the chance to talk at you,
and let's keep this true to the title,
yeah? Our correspondence doesn't
have to end here; it can be ... contin
ued.

Groaning about that last line? Jade is,
too. Send her complaints, clever alter
