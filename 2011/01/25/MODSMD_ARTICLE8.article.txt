ROTC: Lift the ban, but
don't hold your breath

Dear Editor,
Despite the repeal of "don't ask,
don't tell" (DADT), support for Stan
ford's ban on ROTC persists in pre
dictable quarters on campus. The ar
guments in favor of such a ban are no
better than those advanced some four
decades ago.
Military science courses, we are
told, lack academic rigor. This is news
to midshipmen at Naval ROTC
Berkeley, who are required to study
ship systems and engineering, courses
far more challenging than, say, PWR.
The claim that ROTC instructors
aren't qualified is equally ludicrous.
Professors without doctorates can be
found across campus; accomplished
military officers teaching courses
about the military is little different
than successful executives and prac
ticing lawyers lecturing at GSB and
the law school.
ROTC, we are warned, violates
academic freedom by forcing stu
dents into certain careers with certain
employers and restricting their ma
jors. But nobody is forced to join, the
rules and expectations are made clear
from the start, and there is a dropout
procedure. It never seems to occur to
ROTC critics that students might sin
cerely desire to be military officers.
The mistake is to view the U.S. mili
tary as simply another employer, not
worthy of any special recognition.
Finally, the latest line of attack is
the military's ban of transgender indi
viduals. This gives little pause to those
who felt the ROTC prohibition was
foolish to begin with, but for others
who insisted on a repeal of DADT
prior to lifting the ban on ROTC, it's
a thornier problem. It's also a canard.
Even if the transgender ban were re
moved, ROTC opponents would still
find an objection. They might insist
that ROTC stay banned until the first
female is appointed chairman of the
Joint Chiefs, for example, or until nu
clear weapons are eliminated.
The ban on ROTC, then, should
be repealed because common sense
and patriotic decency demand that
Stanford permits its return to campus.
But lifting the ban is only the begin
ning. Proponents of ROTC underes
timate how difficult it may be.

For starters, the enormous endow
ment means few students really need
the money anymore. It also provides
all sorts of opportunities for under
graduates to take full advantage of
the college experience, from funded
research projects to overseas travel.
With programs like direct commis
sioning, Officer Candidate School for
the Army and Navy or Officer Train
ing School for the Air Force, students
interested in the military have many
possible pathways into the services
after graduation, permitting them
personal and academic flexibility
during their time on the Farm.
The Berkeley Naval ROTC unit
can muster some 60 students from
four different schools, including UC-
Davis. Just a handful hail from Stan
ford. Whether the Defense Depart
ment will find a critical mass of inter
ested Cardinal remains to be seen.
Elite academia, including the Ivy
League and Stanford, banned ROTC
some 40 years ago, setting them on
paths that diverged widely from the
military. The question is whether this
chasm has narrowed since then. I fear
it has only widened.
