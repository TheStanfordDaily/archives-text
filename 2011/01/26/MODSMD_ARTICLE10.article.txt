# OPINIONS
## LOOKING UP The 						Last [Little] Note 
### Nina M. Chung 
This is my last column. Four
months ago, I was frantically e
mailing my editors my colum
nist application. Two years ago, I was
telling people how I wanted to write
a column, but was still scoping out the
perfect topic. Now I'm on the other
side of all that. It's incredible. (Well,
at least for me, because there are few
things in life I contemplate lightly.
Read on you'll see.)
Throughout this Daily volume,
an interesting thought has been
flourishing in my noggin. Prior to
my first column, I was very con
cerned about how new topics would
arise. It had occurred to me that life
changing Earth-quaking events
(great writing inspiration) don't
start and end neatly before 4 p.m.
deadlines. And I still assume that's
true. But, somehow, I have always
had something major to share each
week, something really important
to me. Particularly as my junior year
has progressed (or basically half
disappeared while I wasn't look
ing), I've been realizing from where
my biggest lessons truly come and
how I've been able to write about a
new aspect of my life here as each
Wednesday approaches. I never
needed exotic countries or dramat
ic catastrophes or prize-winning ac
complishments every seven days.
What I needed was what I've always
had, which is a world of people
around me that have unknowingly
revealed countless truths and reali
ties, to me and about me. Our whole
lives are like this. It's dawning on
me now.
Sometimes I think that we inad
vertently play our lives like a waiting
game. We start seeing our current ac
tions as investments, or intermediate
steps to a destination. Especially at
Stanford, we're all quietly aware of
the pressure to achieve an amazing
feat quite soon, so we prepare our
selves nonstop while we're here. I've
been falling victim to that mentality
recently via Stanford's trademark ob
session for the big summer internship.
I was suffocating beneath the mission
to find that one amazing internship
that will best take me straight to the
killer post-grad career I haven't cho
sen yet. For a brief, mindless period in
my head, my summer was only as
worthwhile as how well it would serve
me afterward. Isn't that the strangest
chronology? Since when is value only
future tense? It's about time I re
membered that my greatest experi
ences are happening right now, liter
ally, constantly...
The proof is this column. For the
past 13 weeks, I've been writing
about realizations that have been ut-

terly valuable to me and questions
that would make me feel selfish if I
didn't pose them to others. But no
body on the outside has seen me
transform 13 times. Maybe they've
seen a student hanging out with
friends, chatting on the phone, meet
ing someone. Those are the real set
tings of my biggest revelations. It's
misleadingly nondescript. What's
that one cliche, though? "Big things
come in small packages?" I'm telling
you, it's true. I discover so much more
about this world to be in awe about
just by hanging a weekly "what's
up?" question over my head just
in conversations about the day and
our lives. I've grown more suspect of
the word "ordinary" considering how
many of those "ordinary" situations
have left me thoughtfully, speechless
ly surprised. And then, you know, I
wrote about them to you.
It now seems ridiculous to wait for
that "growth experience" to happen
later. That phrase is always at
tached to the future-thing-you've
got-to-apply-for or whatever. No, this
doesn't mean that I'm suddenly ig
noring my GPA or the CDC website
or my resume, because yes, I do be
lieve that our best-version future
usually requires big work before
hand. We have the privilege of going
to a school that unlocks a zillion op
portunities (and also the privilege to
complain about them). But in all of
these present moments that appear
usual or useful-for-later, I've found
myself growing, realizing and under
standing in completely unexpected
ways. Today I'm going to overhear
something interesting or meet some
one "weird" or get really annoyed by
an opinion and, at the end, have the
choice to sum it all up to just another
forgettable day.
But I can't help it I'll probably
choose to see the extraordinary in all
of it instead. And that right there is
quite possibly one of the greatest, lit
tlest everyday habits I've ever picked
up. It sounds extreme, but I'm seri
ous. Dare I say it? I believe it's chang
ing my life.

Nina wishes you a final column
farewell, but this needn't be the end!
