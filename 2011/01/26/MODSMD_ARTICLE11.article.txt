# SENT FROM MY IPHONE
## Time to Stop the Paternalistic Nonsense, Professor Nass 
### Peter McDonald 
I was going to use what might be
my last chance to make all of
Stanford listen to me with a very
pseudo-intellectual rumination
about the cultural history of the hot
prowl and its Ã¼biquity as Stanford's
latest party theme, but I just so hap
pened to open The Daily on Mon
day to discover that my entire
tenure at this great Western univer
sity has existed in violation of the
Fundamental Standard, a public
service announcement courtesy of
Clifford Nass, Otero resident fellow
("Op-ed: Time to stop the alcohol
nonsense," Jan. 24).
Fuck that, and here's why: this
intelligent professor claimed that
"there is evidence that 'approxi
mately 50 percent of all people with
a BAC of .40 or higher will die'" and
that unnamed Stanford students
without integrity narrowly avoided
murdering someone. I have found
from Internet sources that I'm sure
are as reliable as the ones he quoted
in his op-ed that approximately 25
out of 12 million college students
die from alcohol-related incidents
(which may include more than
straight alcohol poisoning) every
year. I am quite willing to bet that
more than 50 college students reach
a BAC of > .40 every year.
The reason the report of this stu
dent's BAC came from the hospital
and not the morgue is that those

same Stanford students who drink
in a self-serving manner called 911
when they suspected that their
friend had drunk too much precise
ly so he/she/ze would not die, de
spite the administration's inevitable
knowledge of it and all the fallout
that might result. That student's sur
vival was most certainly not a coin
flip.
Despite the fact that alcohol is a
drug, and that no one blames the
dealer whenever there's a cocaine
overdose, the exceptionally learned
Dr. Nass still chastises students who
"knowingly" provide "a dangerous
amount of alcohol to the student
who becomes intoxicated." With the
exception of some pledge horror
stories, no one at Stanford gives
people drinks that will take some
one to .40. (For the record, that's
eight shots in an hour for someone
who's 90 pounds.)
A more likely culprit was some
unattended hard alcohol that the
hospitalee, who had pre-gamed be
forehand, was still fiending for
when he/she/ze showed up at the
party. I think I missed the part in the
SAL Party Guide that requires
breathalyzer tests upon entry and
that the hosts conduct regular
sweeps for hard A, so where was the
Fundamental Standard violation
again?
But the provider should be irrel
evant, because in your worldview,
all people with integrity would have
called the RF after they saw this
person "drinking extremely large
quantities of alcohol over a short
period of time" (because I'm sure
you really want to be called every
time that happens to one of your
residents), and upon notification,
what exactly would this clearly
more knowledgeable professor
have done? Probably call 911, which
is what happened to the student in
question in the first place. It is not
the job of every party attendant to
babysit everyone else. At the very
least, don't hate on the kids who are
doing the right thing by walking
their friend home.
And if his affinity for the word
"nonsense" hadn't already done so,
his plagiarism analogy fully betrays
his perspective as Angry, Out-of-
Touch Old Man Yelling at Whipper
snappers. First off, no one plagia
rizes from a book anymore, unless
it's been uploaded to the Internet.
Second, the fluid and mobile nature
of parties means that usually no one
is aware of the entire contents of
someone's stomach on any given
night. According to his logic,

though, upon witnessing someone
copy and paste two sentences from
Wikipedia, I should be able to claim
with authority that he/she/ze plagia
rized the entire paper.
I'm sure Dr. Nass is a competent
and fair RF. In a profile in 2008 he
admirably said that his residents
"need to feel that they're not going
to be yelled at." In Monday's op-ed,
he's yelling at them and the entire
student body and throwing around
his authority as a University-desig
nated parent who deserves to know
about every drop of alcohol con
sumed by his residents.
As long as there's an environ
ment where the oh-so-nebulous
Fundamental Standard gets bran
dished as a blunt weapon and where
the only people whose job it is to
watch residents (i.e. the RAs) can't
do so in drinking environments,
that's not going to happen. I know
it's easy to sit in one's cottage and
make broad moral judgments about
students at some of the more vul
nerable moments in their lives, but I
wish that the next time he's feeling
curmudgeonly, he just channels it
into more research about how kids
are dumber today because they like
to multitask. I really would rather
be writing about hot prowls this
week, but when all my classmates
and I are told that we lack integrity,
I feel the need to defend them.

Shots, shots, shots shots shots, shots,
shots, shots shots shots shots, every
body. petermc@stanford.edu.

Where was the
Fundamental
Standard
violation again?
