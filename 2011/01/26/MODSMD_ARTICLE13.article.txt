## Saturday Morning in Cape Town 
### Evan Spiegel 'l2 
It's 9 a.m. on Saturday morning,
and I'm at the Cape Town
minibus taxi rank. It's already
sunny out, and the wind is strong. My
friend and I walk towards the Nyan
ga line, and as we approach we are
beckoned into the minibus at the
front of the line.
I move to the back and sit in the
fourth and last row. My friend and I
are squished between two Xhosa
speaking high school girls. More pas
sengers pile into the bus. Fourteen,
fifteen, sixteen, seventeen ... the
rows magically accommodate more
people. A man moves an orange,
cloth-covered board into place in a
gap in the row in front of us to accom
modate yet another passenger.
All five rows of the bus are filled,
including the front row that accom

modates the driver on the far right.
The heat inside the small bus is start
ing to intensify, and I can feel beads of
sweat on my forehead.The open win
dow nearest to me can't provide re
lief from the hot sun beating down on
the taxi rank.
We are pressed so tightly together
that I have to shift my body sideways
so that I can force my hand deep
enough into my pocket to retrieve 20
rand to pay the driver our fare,
I notice a bright green parrot sit
ting on top of the driver's seat, next to
the headrest, staring down the pas
sengers as they cram into the
minibus. When we finally get moving,
the parrot braces itself between the
headrest of the driver's seat and the
side of the minibus its bright
green body is held sideways through

each quick turn and its long tail
brushes the drivers face.
I point it out to the girl next to me,
and she claims she's never seen one
on a minibus before.
We drive quickly out of the sta
tion, barely allowing a glimpse of the
tall office buildings and clean streets
of the city bowl as we get on the free
way. Suddenly the suburbs fade away,
and in their place, on either side of
the N2 freeway, metal shacks are
lined up as far as the eye can see. On
a bright white cement wall, a black
serif font with perfectly formed let
ters reads, "with you I am well
pleased."
We're getting close to Nyanga
now.
Cape Town's minibuses form the
dense transportation network that

connects the glittering city and
beaches with the abject poverty of
the marginalized communities in the
Cape Flats. It's the only way to get to
Nyanga without hiring a car the
metered taxis don't drive out here.
Sitting in the bus and looking out
the window, I am acutely aware that
my skin color makes me a minority
and that my nationality makes me a
stranger. It's thrilling to be surround
ed by so many unfamiliar faces.
When we finally arrive at the bus
station, we're late for church it's
9:30 now.
The church elders greet us at the
bus station and drive us quickly to the
primary school classroom that dou
bles as a worship space for the church
on Saturdays.The altar is a worktable
covered in purple velvet, and 50 plas-

tic chairs are assembled in three sec
tions with aisles in between. Forty of
them are filled with members of the
congregation.
Two men deliver the sermon, al
ternating between Xhosa and Eng
lish, and tell the story of Nabal and
Abigail, David and the Eagle Chick
en. The men go back and forth, and
their intensity builds. We sing along in
English, our voices mingling with the
Xhosa hymns filling the room.
As the church service enters its
third hour, my thoughts start to drift
and I remember the bright green par
rot on the minibus. I really need to
start writing these things down.
