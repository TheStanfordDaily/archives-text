## The
						future is BRIGHT 
### CAROLINE CASELLI DESK EDITOR 
Aaron Bright has three goals
for his Stanford career: win
a national championship,
get his degree "My mom
would kill me if I didn't get
my degree!" and be considered an
All-Pac-10 player by the time that he
graduates.
Though all three may seem like long
term aspirations for the freshman from
Bellevue, Wash., Bright whose bas
ketball career began at the young age of
three â€”is already well on his way to
carving out a niche as a major contribu
tor on this year's Stanford men's basket
ball team.
In his inaugural collegiate season,
Bright has already tallied significant
minutes on the court the point guard
has played in all 18 of the Card's games
thus far, earning starts in seven, and is
averaging 20.1 minutes per game, sec
ond among all underclassmen. He
boasts a team-high 91.7-percent foul
shot percentage, has dished out 42 assists
and is the team's third-best from behind
the arc, with 18 three-pointers on the

year.
"Aaron is a terrific player, and
we're very excited about his up-

side," said head coach Johnny
Dawkins. "He's a young man
who is very versatile. Even
though he's a point guard, he's a
capable shooter, he's really quick,
he's capable of getting to the basket and
making plays for
himself or his
teammates.
He brings the
ability to
make us
better."
His sta
tistics and
accolades
from Dawkins
are all the more
impressive consider
ing that Bright has had to adjust to a
completely different role on the court
from the leading scorer of his high
school team to a primary distributor in
college within a matter of months, a
transition that he described as "a little

bit" tough.
"In high school,
my role was to
score the ball,"
Bright ex
plained. "Then
when I came
here, my role
changed dra
matically.
I'm not the
first option
to score
anymore.
My main
job is to

r set
guys up,
and I'm
not really the
focus of attention
on offense."
In addition to his sig
nificant role change,
Bright has also become
keenly aware of the in
creased physical and men
tal demands of Division I
ball in comparison to his prep
career.
"I think the hardest
part of transitioning from high
school to college is how every
thing is so intense," Bright ex
plained. "In high school you think
you're going hard, but then you go back to
your high school and you realize, 'I had it
way easier than what I thought.' Every
thing is faster and more intense and more
tiring."
The sharp-shooting point guard stands
out from his teammates on the court for a
number of reasons, from his quickness to
his bicep tattoo to his stature. Listed at 5-
foot-11, Bright is physically smaller than
many of his peers, a characteristic that he
has both struggled with and learned to use
to his advantage.
"On defense I just really try and pres
sure the ball and use my quickness," he
said. "I'm already low to the ground, so I
kind of have an advantage in that aspect,
and if guys try to like post me up or, you
know, get real close to the basket then I
just get low and they can't get the ball.
