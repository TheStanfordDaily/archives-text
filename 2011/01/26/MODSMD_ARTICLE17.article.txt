### DASH DAVIDSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The No. 8 Stanford men's tennis team
opened its dual-match season at home on
Tuesday afternoon with a resounding victo
ry over Sacramento State at the Taube Fam
ily Tennis Center. The Cardinal swept all
nine matches, resulting in a 7-0 victory over
the visiting Hornets.
Stanford did not drop a set on the day,
with junior Bradley Klahn, senior Greg Hir
shman, sophomore Matt Kandath and sen
ior Alex Clayton only dropping three games
each. Overall, the Cardinal outscored the
Hornets by 66 games, 97-31.
Stanford head coach John Whitlinger
spoke highly of his team's performance.
"I was really pleased with our effort
today, regardless of the scores of the match
es," Whitlinger said. "I thought our guys
competed well, played well and were really
focused on the job at hand."
There was little for Whitlinger to com
plain about, but the veteran coach saw room
for improvement in the Cardinal's debut.
"We have things we could work on,"
Whitlinger said. "I think there were some
nerves at the beginning for a couple guys,
but they settled down and looked good.
We're just going to keep on working on im
proving everybody's game, mentally and
physically and technically. I'm looking for
ward to our two matches this weekend."
Tuesday's victory was a great start for the
Cardinal in what promises to be an impor
tant week. Friday brings a visit from Santa
Clara, followed quickly by Saturday's
matchup against either Nebraska or Van
derbilt. All of Friday and Saturday's match
es will be held at Taube Family Tennis Cen
ter.
Whitlinger stressed that winning Tues
day's match in dominant fashion was a nec
essary start to a challenging week.
"We're just trying to get our feet under
neath us, to maybe get a little confidence,
and then we just got to go out and perform,"
he said. "We have some tough matches com
ing up. You better be ready for every match
you play. That's all I can ask of the guys."
