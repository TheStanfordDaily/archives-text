# BCS hurts academic success
##

Like any self-respecting col
lege football fan, I loathe the
Bowl Championship Series.
I could probably spend an
eternity going off on the sys
tem's many, many faults, including its
abominable "Every Game Counts"
slogan I would love to see BCS ex
ecutive director Bill Hancock go to
Fort Worth, Texas and explain to TCU
how all of its 13 victories and zero loss
es counted when it got frozen out of a
chance to win a national title.
The flaw to which I would like to
bring attention today concerns aca
demics — specifically, how the BCS
contributes to undermining the "stu
dent" part of "student-athlete." Han
cock and the BCS even go one step fur
ther, claiming that the BCS actually
benefits the academic lives of students,
while a proposed eight- or 16-team
playoff would do a great deal of harm
by cutting into the academic calendar.
Yet, despite all of this, I am fairly confi
dent that the BCS does just as much
harm to the academic missions of its
member universities as any playoff
would.
Let's start with this year's BCS Na
tional Championship Game, held on
Jan. 10 in Glendale, Ariz. One of the
participants, Oregon, had classes start a
week before the game, meaning that
players had to miss an entire week of
class while they practiced and pre
pared for the title game (which they
lost to Auburn, 22-19). Forcing players
to miss an entire week of classes at the
start of a semester doesn't really ap
pear to serve the academic mission of
the University of Oregon in any dis
cernable way, especially when the rea
sons for the game's late date are purely
commercial.
In fact, if given one question to ask
Bill Hancock, I would ask him to point
out exactly how playing the game a
week after the start of the semester
helps to preserve the integrity of the ac
ademic calendar. After all, the game
could have been played on or around
New Year's Day, which falls squarely
inside the winter break of virtually
every university in the FBS. Blathering
on about preserving "traditions", as
Hancock is wont to do, wouldn't cut it
either,since the BCS title game is a fair
ly new creation with no history or tradi
tion to speak of. Of course, he could
point to the early January bowl games,
but excuse me if I don't find it especial
ly necessary to uphold the grand tradi
tions of the Kraft Hght Hunger Bowl.
Indeed, playing the game that late
automatically knocks out the BCS's
own argument against a playoff: that it
would disrupt athletes' class schedules.
In a playoff, most of the games would
be played over winter break, with per
haps one game intruding into the first
week of January, precisely when every
BCS game is played.
The BCS also causes intrusions dur
ing the regular season, when smaller
schools routinely play games on week
nights to get exposure on national tele
vision. In the BCS's system of selecting
schools for games by their poll posi
tion, it helps if as many voters as possi
ble can see a team play. For schools that
aren't name brands, the only way to
make this happen is to play on a week
night.
Earlier this year at the University of
Washington, a controversy erupted
over whether afternoon classes and as
signments would be dismissed to ac
commodate a Thursday game on cam
pus. The school chose to continue aca
demics as usual, but professors saw
empty classrooms and lecture halls as a
large number of students chose to at
tend the game instead of class. Of
course, playing games during the week
has a disproportionate effect on the
athletes as well, since they have to cram
in more practice time during the short
week, miss class on game day and have
to go to class the very next morning.
If nothing else, academic concerns
should prompt university presidents
and chancellors to push the BCS to
make changes to the system. At a min
imum, the national title game and all
other BCS bowls should be played
when every NCAA school is on winter
break. However, only a playoff can
truly eliminate all of the academic
problems the BCS brings on by dimin
ishing the influence of polls on the se
lection process and allowing teams to
prove their merits on the field.
