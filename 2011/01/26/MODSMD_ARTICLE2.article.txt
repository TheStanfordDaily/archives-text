## Undergrad Senate hears ROTC debate Student groups present views to ad hoc committee 
### MARGARET RAWSON DESK EDITOR 
The ASSU Undergraduate Senate head
from representatives of the Faculty Sen
ate's ad hoc committee on ROTC at its
weekly meeting Tuesday evening and dis
cussed the issue of ROTC's possible return
to campus.
Student representatives from Stanford
Says No to War and Stanford Students for
Queer Liberation (SSQL) attended and
contributed to the debate.
"It's your party," said psychology profes
sor Ewart Thomas, chair of the ad hoc com
mittee on ROTC, welcoming questions
from the senators.
Thomas outlined some of the central is
sues surrounding ROTC's potential return
to campus, such as academic freedom and
academic quality for ROTC students.
Holding a copy of the San Jose Mercury
News, Thomas referenced a Jan. 24 opinion
piece by Stephen Zunes, a politics professor
at the University of San Francisco. Zunes
said he takes issue with a Dec, 8 ROTC
memo prohibiting student use of classified
information from WikiLeaks for course as
signments, a policy he regards as sacrificing
academic freedom.
"What this looks like is, censorship could
be imposed on a class that Stanford has a
hand in managing," Thomas said. "This, I
think, would be problematic."
Sam Windley L.L.M. 'll, president of
Stanford Says No to War, also commented
on the opinion, describing "a slippery
slope" when a university allows an outside
institution, such as the military, to deter
mine what is appropriate course material.
"Academic freedom is something Stan
ford should, and does, place a lot of empha
sis on," Windley said.
"This is an issue affecting us in a larger
context than just ROTC," said Hester Gel
ber, committee member and professor of
religious studies, in reference to students in
terested in diplomacy careers being advised
to avoid looking at WikiLeaks documents.
Senator Ben Jensen 'l2 raised the issue
of class disparity in military service and ref
erenced his own experience. He weighed a
career in the Air Force against coming to
Stanford.
"Stanford students are going to
be future leaders of the country and
the world," Jensen said. "I hope
there's a careful eye in the way that
we look at this."
Committee members said open
discourse with the Stanford commu
nity will inform their final decision.
"The issue of discrimination has
been front and center," said Eamonn

Callan, committee member and edu
cation professor.
"The fact-finding phase is a phase
during which we have a responsibili
ty to keep an open mind," Callan
added when asked more specifically
about the committee's findings thus
far. "It's our responsibility to listen,
and that's why we're here tonight."
Senator Juany Torres 'l3 quoted
President Obama's State of the
Union address on Tuesday evening,
when he said, "Starting this year, no
American will be forbidden from
serving the country they love be
cause of who they love, and with that
change, I call on all our college cam

puses to open their doors to our mil
itary recruiters and ROTC. It is time
to leave behind the divisive battles of
the past. It is time to move forward as
one nation."
Gelber said the president's re
marks reflect the "university grap
pling with changing perspectives,"
along with the country as a whole.
Janani Balasubramanian 'l2 of
SSQL later questioned whether
Obama's "one nation" includes those
who are transgender.
Student representatives from
SSQL raised the issue of military dis
crimination against transgender indi
viduals.

"We feel that bringing back
ROTC, a program that specifically
says transgender people are not al
lowed, is a violation of [the Universi
ty's] non-discrimination policy," Bal
asubramanian said.
"We are appalled at how this de
bate is being moved away from an
issue of discrimination, which it fun
damentally is," said Alok Vaid-
Menon 'l3, president of SSQL.
Gelber urged the senators to re
member that there will be "some
pain for some constituencies" pas
sionate about ROTC regardless of
the committee's findings.
The committee is expected to re

port is findings in May.
The Senate passed two bills Tues
day evening, one to expand the re
sponsibilities of the Communica
tions Committee to include technol
ogy and another altering the conflict
of-interests section in the Senate
rules of order, no longer requiring
senators to report their officer titles
in student groups but accepting
membership as a bar to assess con
flicts of interest.
All funding bills for the evening
were passed.
