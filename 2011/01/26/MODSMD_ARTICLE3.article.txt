# HOSPITAL OFFERS $173M DEAL
## Palo Alto City Council to discuss hospital expansion Jan. 31 
### WILLA BROCK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford Hospital will increase
its payment of community bene
fits to the city of Palo Alto in order
to offset the impact of its pro
posed expansion, it announced
last Wednesday.
The new $173 million offer is
$49 million more than the original
proposal, an increase that Stan
ford hopes will help its chances at
a Jan. 31 study session at the City
Council.
"Our ability to put forward a
revised community benefits offer
is a result of hearing and respond
ing," said Shelley Hebert, execu
tive director of public affairs at
Stanford Hospital and Clinics,
"both to the issues raised in the
dialogue with the community and
the information available
through the environmental im
pact report."
The proposed benefits now in

elude $126 million in transporta
tion-related benefits, $l2 million
to the city for use in projects and
programs addressing climate
change and $23.2 million to the
city to support affordable housing
and sustainable neighborhood
and community development, ac
cording to a Stanford Hospital
news release.
The community-benefits pay
ments aim to ease some of the
city's concerns about possible ef
fects of the Stanford University
Medical Center Renewal Project,
including traffic, housing and en
vironmental impacts.
Council member and former
mayor Pat Burt cites increased
traffic from the project as the
most significant challenge,
"We have to figure out how we
can accommodate a major expan
sion without putting the streets in
a gridlock," he said.
Stanford has agreed to pur
chase Caltrain Go-Passes for all
its current and future hospital em
ployees in order to mitigate the
traffic impact. The recently in
creased price of these
passes is a

factor in the enhancement of the
community benefits.
Burt sees this result, which
could possibly reduce the expect
ed traffic by 75 percent, as more
than just a financial success. "I've
tried this past year to reframe the
public discussion," he said. "It's
not about dollars. It's about cre
ative solutions."
The new proposal would also
accelerate the payment schedule.
"We think one of the positive fea
tures of this new proposal is that
not only does it increase very sub
stantially in terms of its financial
value," said Hebert, "but it makes
funds available to the city soon
er."
Hebert was careful to empha
size that the money for these com
munity benefits will not come out
of the Stanford endowment.
"Many people mistakenly be
lieve that the hospitals have ac
cess to university endowment
funds," she said. "These funds
come directly from the hospitals."
The $3 billion renewal project
allows for the demolition and re-

CIIIWVVO IUI LllV LIUII CIIIVJ IV/ -
construction of the Stanford Hos
pital and Clinics complex and the
renovation and expansion of
the Lucile Packard Chil
dren's Hospital for a
total addition of 1.3

million square feet.
Hebert cites several reasons
for the importance of the expan
sion.
"We need to comply with the
state seismic safety laws," she said.
"We need to ensure that we have
adequate capacity to take care of
our patients and the community
and we need to bring some of our
19505-era facilities up to modern
standards so that the advances in
both medical care and technology
that are going to be happening in
the 21st century are available to
all our patients here at Stanford."
She is optimistic that the pro
posal will be well-received by the
city council, and Burt agrees.
Praising Stanford's efforts to mit
igate the environmental impacts
of the project by designing green
buildings, he said they have also
helped to reduce "town-and
gown" contention.
"It's not only good for this
project," he said, "but I think it's
setting the foundation for a much
stronger and more positive rela
tionship between the University
and the city."
