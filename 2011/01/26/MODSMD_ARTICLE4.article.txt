The police investigation into an alleged as
sault on Jan. 3 is ongoing, according to Bill Lar
son of the Stanford Department of Public
Safety (DPS). No suspect been identified, and
DPS is contacting local law enforcement agen
cies for reports of similar incidents.

A female student
was allegedly assault
ed near Manzanita
Field, where she was
walking alone. Ac
cording to an e-mail
alert from DPS, a man
approached the stu
dent from behind and
covered her mouth
with his hand. He fled
after she tried to bite
him.
DPS has deter
mined that the case is
not related to an as
sault that occurred

near campus over Thanksgiving break.
"The Department of Public Safety reminds
the community to always be aware of your sur
roundings," Larson said. "Travel in pairs, use
lighted paths, be familiar with the locations of
the blue 911 emergency towers and to call 9-1-
1 immediately to report suspicious persons or
activities."
