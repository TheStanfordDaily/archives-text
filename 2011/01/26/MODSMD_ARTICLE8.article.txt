## BETTEE BOARDING Junior Lucyann Murray skips winter quarter to snowboard competitively 
### KELSEY GEISER 
Lucyann Murray 'l2 has loved and
lived for snowboarding since child
hood. Now she's making bigger
strides for the sport: she is taking win
ter quarter off to train. Since high
school, Murray has struggled to balance tough
classes with her training regimen and travel
schedule. Now she is focused on finding out just
how far she can push her competitive passion.
Murray is originally from Washington, D.C.
She learned to snowboard at age 9 and started
competing in freestyle events at 14 with the
Wintergreen Snowboard Team in Virginia.
When her family moved to Greenwich, Conn.,
after her freshman year of high school, Murray
continued her devotion.
She joined the Stratton Mountain Snow
board Team in Vermont to compete regionally,
despite the lengthy commute. Training with
that team "opened my eyes to what I could be
doing," she said.
She faced setbacks, including tearing her
ACL in the spring of her senior year of high
school. But Murray was not discouraged.
"I believe there are a lot of barriers, but
when you set your heart to something that is
worth it, those barriers only make things more
exciting, and I'm ready to take on those barri
ers with all I've got: sweat, tears, frustration and
all," she wrote in a blog post documenting her
quarter away.
Murray entered Stanford with a goal: "I
needed to focus on school and see if I got full
recovery," she said.
She succeeded, recovering enough to com
pete in national events her freshman year. Now,
her recovery has progressed to the point where
she does not even need to wear a knee brace
while practicing.
Her return demanded hard work, including
strength and conditioning training with Carl
Paoli, founder of Naka Athletics, six days a
week in San Francisco for the past year.
Paoli and Naka Athletics use a variety of
techniques to prepare extreme athletes for the
unusual moves they are expected to perform
every day. For physical performance, they focus
on basic gymnastics skills, weightlifting, track
and field and trampoline training. They also
apply nutrition knowledge to fuel the athletes
for intense physical activity.

This kind of training will enable Murray to
practice for more extended periods with
greater ease. It "creates an awareness of how
the body works that is really going to translate
into all the skill she does," Paoli said.
As to how strength training improved the
condition of her injured knee, Murray said, "I
don't think I would be where I am without it."
For her first two years on the Farm, Murray
had to plan her academic schedule around a
strenuous schedule of training and snowboard
ing competitions. She took no classes on Fri
days and spent every Friday, Saturday and Sun
day traveling to Lake Tahoe to participate on
the Squaw Valley ski team. She lived with the
Stanford ski team on the weekends.
Such restrictions limited her academic
choices, and often she was unable to take the
classes she either wanted or needed to take.
She spent much of her time catching up with
classes that she missed due to competitions and
took many exams on the road.
"It wasn't always easy, but it was definitely a
learning experience," Murray said.
She found a flexible home in the human biol
ogy program. With her major in order, Murray
could complete all the necessary courses for
winter ahead of time, allowing her to take this
quarter to focus on her snowboarding and, as
she says, "get a grasp on how far I can take it."
With the support of her family, friends and
coaches, Murray is currently practicing and liv
ing with her teammates on the Wasatch Project
Grom Squad in Utah and training with coaches
Ryan Bever and Dustin Linker. She is compet
ing in freestyle snowboarding, which includes
jumps and rails.
Her results in 2010 included third place at
the Burton AM Series Halfpipe, ninth place at
the Burton AM Series Slopestyle and third
place at the USSA Revolution Tour Slopestyle,
Previously, she was named Red Bully Snow
Warz Best Female Rider in 2009 and received
first place at the Volcom Peanut Butter Rail
Jam in 2008.
To keep her family, friends and supporters
up to date on life away from Stanford, Murray
has been keeping up her blog.
"This season," she wrote there, "is about
pushing boundaries, defying odds and dancing
with dreams."
