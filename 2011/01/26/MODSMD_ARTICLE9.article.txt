# FREEING KNOWLEDGE
## Public Knowledge Project works to make research easier to publish, access 
### KELSEY GEISER 
The intellectual inquiry occur
ring each day at Stanford
prompts the question of how
research can best be accessed
and put to use for the benefit
of all.
Enter the Public Knowledge Project.
The project works on how to make
precious new information easily avail
able to anyone who wants it. Education
professor and project director John
Willinsky has been working on the proj
ect since f998. He began with the prem
ise that research should be made more
widely available. Since then, the project
has taken a more technological direc
tion.
ft revolves around free, download
able software that provides scholars
with the means to launch new or exist
ing journals and the option to make
those journals free and publicly avail
able. With this "open-source" option,
the project aims to have many scholars
join it in its mission to improve the qual
ity of public research not only in the
U.S., but also all over the world.
"We can make knowledge available
online more easily, more widely and
more cheaply," Willinsky said.
The project involves mainly soft
ware developers, researchers and li
brarians, who together created open
journals and conference systems and
are currently working on an open
monograph press. The journals system
provides a publishing platform that al
lows scholars not only to make their
hard-earned information widely avail
able, but also to easily manage the jour
nals, edit and peer-review submissions
and carry out the overall publishing
process.
The scholars who use the software to
publish their journals do not have to go
through commercial publishers. This
means the project does not publish the
journals itself. Rather, it facilitates the
publication process so scholars can do
so easily and efficiently.
More than 7,500 titles in 35 lan
guages are using the software, half in
developing countries. The journals ad
dress a wide range of topics, from arts
and poetry to medicine, and can be pub
lished by anyone from a high school stu
dent to a university professor.
One of the journals is printed in
Kiswahili, making it the program's first
journal in an African language.

"We are trying to help developing
countries use their own language to
contribute from their own perspective
but still with scholarly standards," Will
insky said.
Juan Pablo Alperin, a researcher and
systems developer in the project, has
spent time researching and running
workshops across Latin America to dis
cover how best to help editors in the re
gion publish research journals.
"I see the open-access movement
and the work that we do as aimed at
helping journals in these regions that
are not currently valued by the system
achieve visibility, recognition and pres
tige," Alperin said.
He and others working toward this
goal around the world have found it dif
ficult to encourage people to change
how they publish their work. Alperin
has been working to reverse this aver
sion to open forums for research by
"using technology to shift the landscape
of what is possible."
Jamie O'Keeffe, a fellow researcher
in the open-access movement, is mak
ing similar strides in the medical field.
She is working on a journal researching
the impact of open journal resources by
looking at health care providers.
O'Keefe's research is "an explorato
ry study to investigate the 'current' state
of access," she said in an e-mail to The
Daily. She found through interviews
with health care providers that critical
decisions physicians needed to make
depended on their access to particular
research articles.
The project's open conference sys
tems allow users to easily manage large
meetings. It helps them to create web
pages, to schedule, to review submis
sions, to create registries and to organ
ize the small but important details of
conference planning.
The program is also working on an
open monograph press, which will allow
for free access to monographs, edited
volumes and scholarly editions, many of
which are especially difficult for devel
oping countries to access.
The project plans on expanding its
mission, especially in the field of stu
dent journals and in further supporting
the active participation of developing
countries in the global network.
The project has taken technological
leaps towards making journals easily
available. However, its long-term goal is
to make all scholarly information open
ly accessible.
"About 20 percent of research is now
freely available, and we are not going to
stop until it is 99.9 percent," Willinsky
said.
