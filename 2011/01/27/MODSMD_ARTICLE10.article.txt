# THIS COLUMN IS IRONIC
## 'Between the Click of the Light and the Start of the Dream' 
### Shane Savitsky 
With Volume 238 of The
Daily coming to a close, I
thought I would finally get
a little bit introspective. Over my
past 11 columns, I've tried to make
you laugh. Hopefully, I succeeded.
If I ever slightly offended you, then
I think I did my job, too. This col
umn is (usually) ironic. However,
because this may be its final edi
tion, I'm going to pass up the jokes
about sororities to touch on some
thing important to me. Indulge me
just this once while I try to prove
my worth as a political science
major by passing along a life lesson.
If these past two and a half years
at Stanford have taught me any
thing, it's that you can truly accom
plish anything you want to do here.
Actually, I take that back. I'm
enough of a cynic that I can't get en
tirely behind that Lythcott-Haim
sian worldview. Let me rephrase it
this way: this university offers you
all of the opportunities you could
possibly want to succeed in whatev
er your initiative may be, so try. You
might fail sometimes disastrous
ly but at least you tried. You're
only going to be in this place once
in your life, so make the most of it.
I find myself thinking back to a
conversation I had with someone
truly important to me at the foot of
the Eiffel Tower a few months ago.
We talked about making a differ
ence in the world, and I argued a
rather cynical view at the time
that one person alone simply could
n't change the world, so why bother
trying? There was definitely a copi
ous amount of French rose in
volved, but that alone can't make

up for how blatantly wrong I was
that night. Granted, I still think my
first point is potentially valid. Hon
estly, I'm not sure that one person
can change the world. Yet it was in
the second part where I was so
tremendously wrong the "why
bother?"
It's a good question; I'll give it
that. If I don't think a person can
singlehandedly change the world,
then why even waste my time try
ing? Here's my big revelation: it's
not all about changing the world.
That conversation in July helped to
spur a complete reformation of my
worldview. Sure, I'm still pragmatic
to the point of cynicism, but I've re
alized an important point: one per
son doesn't necessarily have to
change the world, but one person
can easily change someone else's
world and that might be just as
important.
So how can you accomplish this?
Just how can you change someone
else's world? Start small; start per
sonal. Be a good friend. Have a
meaningful conversation. Be there
for somebody when they need you.
Ask out that cute girl you've spot
ted around campus. Call your par
ents a little more often. Fall in love.
There are more than a few ideas to
get you started.

Or you can take the route most
traveled by Stanford students: do
something crazy. That's how I've
decided to make the best use of this
newfound energy. This summer, I'll
be embarking on the Mongol Rally.
What's that, you ask? I'll just be
driving from southeast England to
Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia. It'll be
four weeks, 13 countries, and 10,000
miles all to support a Stanford
student-founded nonprofit, Gum
ball Capital. I know how crazy the
whole venture sounds. Why should
I take a month out of my summer to
do the "insane trip by a college stu
dent for charity" thing?
I'll tell you: because I want to
change someone's world. Maybe I
can change the world of the person
in poverty somewhere in the Third
World who will be the nameless
beneficiary of the money I raise.
Maybe I can change the world of
someone I meet on my journey
along a third of the world's circum
ference. Maybe I can change the
world of one of you by inspiring
you to do something to make this
world a better place for someone
else in it. I know you can do it. It's
why we're all at this school in the
first place.
That conversation under the
Eiffel Tower and many others
before and after helped to
change my world. This column is
my little attempt to change yours.

Shane is sorry he had to get all super
serious on you there, so e-mail him at
savitsky@stanford.edu and he'll be
more than happy to give you the
usual dose of wit and charm.
