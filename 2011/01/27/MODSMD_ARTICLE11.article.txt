# OP-ED
## Get a Helmet. And a Life. 
### Ben Lauing '11 
Fall quarter, I decided to try
something I hadn't done in
years, for as long as I can re
member. I started to wear a helmet
whenever I rode my bike. I got a free
helmet my freshman year, and yet
for three years, I never wore it. Be
cause no one did. I didn't want to be
a nerd, I didn't want to look like a
sketchy grad student and I didn't
want the helmet to screw up my hair,
which is admittedly temperamental.
But my three-year stint suc
cumbing to peer pressure halted
when two friends were hospitalized
after serious bike accidents in which
they were not wearing helmets.
Both incidents were legitimately
scary. The pain my friends experi
enced wasn't an hour getting a cast.
It was days in the ICU clinging to
consciousness. It was weeks adjust
ing to normal life after a life-threat
ening accident. It was months of
therapy trying to regain not just
their strength but their basic neuro
logical functioning. And it will be
years remembering the day they
could have lost their lives.
When I came back to school this
year, I brought my helmet. But I
couldn't wear it. I just felt so ridicu
lous. Even though I knew it was
something I should do, and though
in theory I was comfortable with
myself, the act of putting the helmet
on made me feel unbearably self
conscious. Helmets are just not
sexy! I just knew that if I wore my
helmet, everyone would see me and
judge me. "Wow, lame." "Haha,
Ben's such a nerd."
But then I realized... I am a
nerd. And that's fine! I thought
about every judgment people could
make about me, and realized that

they were all ridiculous. And really,
am I the kind of person who would
prioritize what people think of me
over my own safety and well-being?
Absolutely not.
I see this as an issue of self-re
spect, something I find much sexier
than slightly-crumpled helmet hair.
I would admire people much more
for respecting themselves enough
to care about their safety than for
caring about what people think of
them. By wearing a helmet, you're
not making a fashion statement;
you're making a personal state
ment. Helmets are never going to be
cute in and of themselves, but the
confidence you exude by wearing
one is exponentially sexier than any
hat you could wear. Thinking that
you won't get into an accident is ar
rogant. Thinking that safety might
interfere with your hair is vain. Not
wanting to resemble a nerd is inse
cure. None of these to me is an at
tractive quality in a person, yet they
all scream at me when I see some
one riding a bike without a helmet.
I can't help it! So yes, now I judge
you for not wearing a helmet. My,
how the tides have turned.
Now, a lot of these thoughts
came about when I first started
wearing my helmet. I still felt un
comfortable, so literally every bike
ride was spent justifying to myself
why it was worth how weird I felt.
And it did feel weird, for about a
week. Now I feel naked without it.
It's no longer something I'm mak
ing myself do it's something I
want to do. It's common sense.
And you know what? People re
ally don't care. I've only had two
comments from friends who've
seen me wearing a helmet. The first

sarcastically yelled "Ben?? Nice
helmet..." to which I coolly af
firmed "Thanks! I like it too!" The
second friend was one who had
been hospitalized. As she rode by
me, her mouth erupted into a huge
smile. "Blau! Nice helmet!!" And
her smile wasn't just a friendly

hello. It was a smile of pride. She
was proud of me for defying idiotic
social norms and caring about my
self. And you know what? I was
proud of myself, too.
So even if you don't have friends
who have been injured from bike
accidents, and even if you still feel a

little insecure about it, I encourage
you to try wearing a helmet. Just for
a week, and then see how you feel. It
won't kill you. In fact, it might save
your life. And the very least, I'll
think you're sexy.
