## GUNNING FOR 11 Women look to continue streak 
### JACK BLANCHAT CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After completing a strong weekend
against the Los Angeles schools last
week, the No. 4 Stanford women's bas
ketball team (16-2,7-0 Pac-10) heads to
Oregon this weekend to kick off a four
game road trip.
The Cardinal has captured 10
straight wins, and the trip up north
could help separate Stanford from the
remainder of the pack.
Oregon (12-6,3-4) has had a consis
tently unusual season in the Pac-10 so
far. The Ducks dropped both games to
the Arizona and southern California
schools, but remain undefeated against
the Washington schools and rival Ore
gon State.
Oregon is a perfect 3-0 at home in
conference play thus far, and most of its
success this season can be attributed to
the powerful "J-Team." Junior forward
Amanda Johnson and redshirt junior
guard Nia Jackson are both averaging
over 16 points per game this season,
and junior Jasmin Holliday contributes
8.3 points per game as well. Altogether,
the three players make up 50 percent of

the Ducks' scoring this season.
Although Oregon has some scary
scorers, history has not been so kind to
the Ducks when they have taken on
Stanford. The Cardinal has won 11 in a
row against the girls in green, and Stan
ford hung 100 points on Oregon both
times they played last year, winning
100-80 in Eugene and 104-60 in Maples
Pavilion.
Oregon State (7-11,0-7 Pac-10) has
found itself in the cellar of the Pac-10
this season. However, the poor record
can be deceiving, as the Beavers' mar
gin of defeat in Pac-10 games is only 6.4
points per game.
Like Oregon, the Beavers rely heav
ily on a trio of players that all average
more than 30 minutes of playing time
per game. Freshman guard Alyssa Mar
tin, who averages 14.9 points per game,
sophomore guard Sage Indendi, who
averages 10.8 points per game and sen
ior forward El Sara Greer, who adds 8.4
rebounds and 9.5 points per game.
Stanford heads north playing some
of its best basketball of the season.
After dominating UCLA and USC, the
accolades came flying in for the second
week in a row, as senior forward Kayla

Pedersen was named Pac-10 player of
the week for the fourth time in her ca
reer.
Pedersen, the only player to rank in
the top three in assists, points and re
bounds for the Cardinal, was also
named a finalist for the Lowe's Senior
CLASS Award on Wednesday, an
award given annually to seniors with
outstanding academic and athletic
achievements.
Additionally, Pedersen will have a
chance to make history this weekend,
as she needs to play only eight more
minutes to eclipse Virginia Sourlis' 25-
year-old Stanford record of 4,148 min
utes played.
"I think it will all hit me at the end of
the season, the fact that, 'Wow, I spent
four years playing in a Stanford uni
form,"' she said. "But until then, it's just
one game at a time."
Pedersen's pursuit of history was
briefly derailed earlier this year, when
she had to sit out a road game against
DePaul, in which Stanford suffered its
first loss of the season, a 91-71 defeat.
However, the senior from Fountain

The No. 4 Stanford women's basketball game hits the road in search of its 11th straight win this weekend. The Cardinal
has reached the 80-point mark in five of its last six games and currently sits alone atop the Pac-10 standings.
