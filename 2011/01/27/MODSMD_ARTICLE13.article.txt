Following a disappointing week
end in southern California, the Stan
ford men's basketball team is back on
the Farm. Currently plagued by a
three-game losing streak, the Card

(10-8, 3-4 Pac-10) now enters a four
game conference homestand a rare
scheduling occurrence that could pro
vide the team with a favorable oppor
tunity to pick up a few key wins and
get back on track.
Tomorrow night, Stanford will face
Oregon (9-10, 2-5), who heads to

Maples Pavilion coming off a close 63-
59 win against rival Oregon State last
Saturday. The victory was the team's
first road win of the season, and it was
a much-needed morale boost after the
team suffered a month-long losing
streak and 1-5 start to the conference
season.
However, Oregon opened up its
brand new arena two weeks ago with a
clutch 68-62 win over a tough USC
squad.The upset put the Ducks' young
team on the map, although it was pre
dicted to finish last in the Pac-10 pre
season media poll.
But if location is any indicator of
the Ducks' success, they will have a
rough time against the Card they
have not won a single game on the
Farm in 25 years. Though Stanford has
defeated Oregon at home in 24 con
secutive matchups, the team will have
to learn from its mistakes in Los Ange
les and revert back to its early-season
style in order to capitalize on its home
court advantage.
Despite a 14-point lead over
UCLA at one point in the first half, the
Card was not able to produce nearly
enough of an offensive effort during
the remainder of the game. Head
coach Johnny Dawkins is optimistic
that this can change in tomorrow's
game.
"Our looks were very good, and if
we take those looks again, they're
going to [fall]. We need to come out
and do the same things we did in the
first half," Dawkins said. "We're a
good shooting team and a good scor
ing team, so we have to get back to the
basics and make it happen."
In fact, the Card has been staying
alive almost solely because of its de

Freshman forward Anthony Brown, above, and the rest of the young Cardinal
hope to snap a three-game losing streak tonight when the team faces Oregon in
Maples Pavilion. Stanford hasn't reached 60 points for six consecutive games.
