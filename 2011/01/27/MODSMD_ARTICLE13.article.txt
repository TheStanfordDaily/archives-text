Following a disappointing week
end in southern California, the Stan
ford men's basketball team is back on
the Farm. Currently plagued by a
three-game losing streak, the Card

(10-8, 3-4 Pac-10) now enters a four
game conference homestand a rare
scheduling occurrence that could pro
vide the team with a favorable oppor
tunity to pick up a few key wins and
get back on track.
Tomorrow night, Stanford will face
Oregon (9-10, 2-5), who heads to

Maples Pavilion coming off a close 63-
59 win against rival Oregon State last
Saturday. The victory was the team's
first road win of the season, and it was
a much-needed morale boost after the
team suffered a month-long losing
streak and 1-5 start to the conference
season.
However, Oregon opened up its
brand new arena two weeks ago with a
clutch 68-62 win over a tough USC
squad.The upset put the Ducks' young
team on the map, although it was pre
dicted to finish last in the Pac-10 pre
season media poll.
But if location is any indicator of
the Ducks' success, they will have a
rough time against the Card they
have not won a single game on the
Farm in 25 years. Though Stanford has
defeated Oregon at home in 24 con
secutive matchups, the team will have
to learn from its mistakes in Los Ange
les and revert back to its early-season
style in order to capitalize on its home
court advantage.
Despite a 14-point lead over
UCLA at one point in the first half, the
Card was not able to produce nearly
enough of an offensive effort during
the remainder of the game. Head
coach Johnny Dawkins is optimistic
that this can change in tomorrow's
game.
"Our looks were very good, and if
we take those looks again, they're
going to [fall]. We need to come out
and do the same things we did in the
first half," Dawkins said. "We're a
good shooting team and a good scor
ing team, so we have to get back to the
basics and make it happen."
In fact, the Card has been staying
alive almost solely because of its de

fense, as the team has failed to reach
the 60-point mark in six consecutive
games. Stanford hopes to see a re
vival of the explosive offense it dis
played in the Pac-10 season opener
against Cal when the Card shot a
season-best 57.4 percent.
"We have to look at our kids and
have them understand that it's
going to be a process," Dawkins
said of his young lineup. "We need
to take the positives away and look
at the negatives to see how we can
correct them."
Fortunately for Stanford, by
continuing to enforce a solid de
fense and adjusting the previously
struggling offense, the team could
be able to hold off the Ducks, who
are averaging only a 41.1 overall
shooting percentage.
Senior Joevan Catron, sopho
more E.J. Singler and junior Mal
colm Armstead round out Oregon's
offense and pose the most notable
threat to the Cardinal defense.
"Oregon is a good, hard-nosed

team," Dawkins said. "They're
scrappy, and they're playing with a
lot of confidence."
Several Stanford players have
particularly strong career showings
against Oregon. Junior guard Jere
my Green has shot 46.4 percent
from the field and averaged 12.0
points per game, while junior for
ward Jack Trotter is 7-for-ll from
the floor when facing the Ducks.
Dawkins expects these players
to be key contributors, and also
hopes that the team will come to
gether and produce enough mo
mentum to overcome Oregon's
quick style of play.
"They're playing with a style
that fits their young players and
smaller team," Dawkins said of the
Oregon lineup. "They get after you
defensively and mix up their de
fenses. Offensively, they're con
stantly in attack mode with guys
who are looking to drive and pitch,
and that fits well with their person
ality."
Tipoff against Oregon to kick
off the four-game homestand is to
morrow at 7 p.m.

hopes that the team will come to
gether and produce enough mo
mentum to overcome Oregon's
quick style of play.
"They're playing with a style
that fits their young players and
smaller team," Dawkins said of the
Oregon lineup. "They get after you
defensively and mix up their de
fenses. Offensively, they're con
stantly in attack mode with guys
who are looking to drive and pitch,
and that fits well with their person
ality."
Tipoff against Oregon to kick
off the four-game homestand is to
morrow at 7 p.m.
