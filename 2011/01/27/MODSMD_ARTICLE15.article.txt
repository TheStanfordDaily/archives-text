# I love me some Dolgopolov
## 
### Jacob Jaffe 
I'm sick. Frequent cough,
clogged ears, no appetite,
lack of energy, trouble sleep
ing, the whole nine yards.
When this happens, there is
very little for me to do other than
watch sports and complain about
being sick (ignore the fact that I'd
be doing the same thing even if I
was healthy, except I'd find some
thing else to complain about).
Now, no one (and I mean no
one ) likes listening to me com
plain about being sick, so let's
concentrate on the sports. Well,
when you're a casual sports fan,
you can look up when big games
are going to be on and plan ahead
so that you can watch those
games and only those games.
When, as one of The Daily's edi
tors said to me the other day,
"You watch way too much
sports," you broaden your scope a
little bit. Sure, you'll watch the
NFL playoffs, but you'll also
check out that Horizon League

basketball game if it seems inter
esting.
It was in one of these situations,
when I was virtually a part of the
couch from setting up shop there
for so long, when I stumbled upon a
tennis match that I never expected
to care about. I like tennis, and I can
certainly appreciate good tennis,
but I'm never going to be someone
who follows it regularly. Other than
the Stanford tennis teams, the only
tennis I'll watch is the Grand Slams,
which I guess makes me the equiv
alent of a C&E Christian (an
AFWU tennis fan?).
Anyway, the Australian Open is
well underway, which, coupled with

said illness and sports fandom, means
it's Jacob Jaffe the Tennis Fan time. I
had already watched some I
missed my favorite meal of the week,
ribs, because I was watching the first
set of Andy Roddick vs. Igor Kunitsyn
(nope, I hadn't heard of him either, but
it was a good set) but I hadn't sat
down for a full match yet.
Then I flipped to a seemingly
random and boring match Robin
Soderling, seeded fourth, vs.
Alexandr Dolgopolov, whose face
looked like that of an acne-riddled
high school girl. He appeared to be
playing like one, too, as Soderling
was doing whatever he wanted with
the unknown Dolgopolov. As the
first set finished 6-1 in favor of
Soderling, the announcers were rav

ing about how Soderling was de
stroying his opponent and seeming
ly counting down the minutes until
they could stop trying to say the
name Dolgopolov (pronounced, as
far as I can tell, Dole-go-POLE-off).
Despite the blowout and the fact
that I had no connection to this match
(Soderling was clearly going to win
and I'd never heard of this guy with a
funny name), I kept watching. Even as
Soderling got a quick break in the sec
ond, I stuck with it, because ... why
not? I've got nothing better to do with
my life. The AFC Championship
Game was at least as much of a
blowout (24-3 Steelers) and it was
halftime anyway. There's no way I'm
getting up and doing anything useful.
Why not watch some random tennis?
It was sure lucky I did, because the
match turned upside down. This 22-
year-old Ukrainian suddenly decided
to do his best Roger Federer impres
sion and started pummeling the
stunned Soderling. Down 2-1 in the

second set and facing Soderling's
serve, Dolgopolov looked reborn,
winning 11 of the next 13 games to
take a two-sets-to-one lead. He pulled
off some absurd shots, and he certain
ly won me over. The announcers kept
telling the story of how he almost lost
to a local club player just a month ago,
and here he was holding his own
against one of the world's top five
players.

So naturally, Dolgopolov was
coasting toward one of the biggest up
sets of the year so far. Or not. Soder
ling went on to win the first four
games of the fourth set and hold on
for the 6-4 win, forcing a decisive fifth
set. By this point, the Jets-Steelers
game was well into the fourth quarter
and the Jets were threatening to make
a game of it. Football is my favorite
sport, and this game is obviously huge.
Yet I couldn't help but flip back to the
tennis match, because I was honestly
more interested in this Swede facing
this Ukrainian in Australia than any

thing going on in America at the time.
I did see the Jets get within five
near the end of the game, and I saw
Ben Roethlisberger make a few plays
to clinch the game for the Steelers.
But what I'll remember much more
from that day is watching Soderling
go up a break in the fifth, only to see
Dolgopolov win six of the next seven
games to take the set and the match.
I'll remember a crazy back-and-forth
showdown that saw the No. 46 player
in the world beat the No. 4 player, and
Dolgopolov go from having a one
percent chance of winning (according
to ESPN's spiffy "match win likeli

hood" calculator) after trailing by a
break in the second set to pulling off
a 6-2 fifth set for the win.
Dolgopolov went on to lose to
Andy Murray in the next round, and
his match against Soderling will prob
ably have almost no lasting impact.
But for one afternoon, I was trans
fixed.
And really, isn't that what sports are
all about?

the unknown Dolgopolov. As the
first set finished 6-1 in favor of
Soderling, the announcers were rav

ing about how Soderling was de
stroying his opponent and seeming
ly counting down the minutes until
they could stop trying to say the
name Dolgopolov (pronounced, as
far as I can tell, Dole-go-POLE-off).
Despite the blowout and the fact
that I had no connection to this match
(Soderling was clearly going to win
and I'd never heard of this guy with a
funny name), I kept watching. Even as
Soderling got a quick break in the sec
ond, I stuck with it, because ... why
not? I've got nothing better to do with
my life. The AFC Championship
Game was at least as much of a
blowout (24-3 Steelers) and it was
halftime anyway. There's no way I'm
getting up and doing anything useful.
Why not watch some random tennis?
It was sure lucky I did, because the
match turned upside down. This 22-
year-old Ukrainian suddenly decided
to do his best Roger Federer impres
sion and started pummeling the
stunned Soderling. Down 2-1 in the

second set and facing Soderling's
serve, Dolgopolov looked reborn,
winning 11 of the next 13 games to
take a two-sets-to-one lead. He pulled
off some absurd shots, and he certain
ly won me over. The announcers kept
telling the story of how he almost lost
to a local club player just a month ago,
and here he was holding his own
against one of the world's top five
players.

So naturally, Dolgopolov was
coasting toward one of the biggest up
sets of the year so far. Or not. Soder
ling went on to win the first four
games of the fourth set and hold on
for the 6-4 win, forcing a decisive fifth
set. By this point, the Jets-Steelers
game was well into the fourth quarter
and the Jets were threatening to make
a game of it. Football is my favorite
sport, and this game is obviously huge.
Yet I couldn't help but flip back to the
tennis match, because I was honestly
more interested in this Swede facing
this Ukrainian in Australia than any

thing going on in America at the time.
I did see the Jets get within five
near the end of the game, and I saw
Ben Roethlisberger make a few plays
to clinch the game for the Steelers.
But what I'll remember much more
from that day is watching Soderling
go up a break in the fifth, only to see
Dolgopolov win six of the next seven
games to take the set and the match.
I'll remember a crazy back-and-forth
showdown that saw the No. 46 player
in the world beat the No. 4 player, and
Dolgopolov go from having a one
percent chance of winning (according
to ESPN's spiffy "match win likeli

hood" calculator) after trailing by a
break in the second set to pulling off
a 6-2 fifth set for the win.
Dolgopolov went on to lose to
Andy Murray in the next round, and
his match against Soderling will prob
ably have almost no lasting impact.
But for one afternoon, I was trans
fixed.
And really, isn't that what sports are
all about?

I'm sick. Frequent cough,
clogged ears, no appetite,
lack of energy, trouble sleep
ing, the whole nine yards.
When this happens, there is
very little for me to do other than
watch sports and complain about
being sick (ignore the fact that I'd
be doing the same thing even if I
was healthy, except I'd find some
thing else to complain about).
Now, no one (and I mean no
one ) likes listening to me com
plain about being sick, so let's
concentrate on the sports. Well,
when you're a casual sports fan,
you can look up when big games
are going to be on and plan ahead
so that you can watch those
games and only those games.
When, as one of The Daily's edi
tors said to me the other day,
"You watch way too much
sports," you broaden your scope a
little bit. Sure, you'll watch the
NFL playoffs, but you'll also
check out that Horizon League

basketball game if it seems inter
esting.
It was in one of these situations,
when I was virtually a part of the
couch from setting up shop there
for so long, when I stumbled upon a
tennis match that I never expected
to care about. I like tennis, and I can
certainly appreciate good tennis,
but I'm never going to be someone
who follows it regularly. Other than
the Stanford tennis teams, the only
tennis I'll watch is the Grand Slams,
which I guess makes me the equiv
alent of a C&E Christian (an
AFWU tennis fan?).
Anyway, the Australian Open is
well underway, which, coupled with

said illness and sports fandom, means
it's Jacob Jaffe the Tennis Fan time. I
had already watched some I
missed my favorite meal of the week,
ribs, because I was watching the first
set of Andy Roddick vs. Igor Kunitsyn
(nope, I hadn't heard of him either, but
it was a good set) but I hadn't sat
down for a full match yet.
Then I flipped to a seemingly
random and boring match Robin
Soderling, seeded fourth, vs.
Alexandr Dolgopolov, whose face
looked like that of an acne-riddled
high school girl. He appeared to be
playing like one, too, as Soderling
was doing whatever he wanted with
the unknown Dolgopolov. As the
first set finished 6-1 in favor of
Soderling, the announcers were rav

ing about how Soderling was de
stroying his opponent and seeming
ly counting down the minutes until
they could stop trying to say the
name Dolgopolov (pronounced, as
far as I can tell, Dole-go-POLE-off).
