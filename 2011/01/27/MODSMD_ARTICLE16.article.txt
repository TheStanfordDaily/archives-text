## 
### WILL SEATON STAFF WRITER 
Taking center court in its
regular season home opener,
the defending national cham
pion and current No. 1 Stan
ford women's tennis team (1-
0) dominated UC-Davis (1-2)
with a 7-0 score.
Stanford was able to run
through the doubles matches
fairly quickly. Out with a sore
muscle in her stomach, sopho
more Mallory Burdette was re
placed on the No. 1 team by fel
low sophomore Stacey Tan.
Tan and senior captain Hilary
Barte won 8-2. Senior Carolyn
McVeigh and junior Veronica
Li paired up at the No. 3 spot,
also winning 8-2.

Perhaps most interesting
was the No. 2 match, showcas
ing two fresh faces on the team
in freshmen Kristie Ahn and
Nicole Gibbs. In their first reg
ular season match at home, the
two combined for a dominat
ing 8-1 performance that dis
played the talent many have
been expecting them to bring
this year.
"First of all they have a lot
of experience together," said
head coach Lele Forood.

Senior Hilary Barte, above, led the No. 1 Stanford women's tennis
team to a 7-0 victory over UC-Davis in the Cardinal's regular-season
home opener. The team faces Cal Poly this weekend.
"They won a pro tournament last
year, so they're used to [playing] to
gether. They played well in the fall
at regionals and they've taken some
losses since then, so we're trying to
get back on the track of how well
they played in the fall."
The two debuted well in singles
also. Gibbs started at the No. 2 posi
tion while Ahn played No. 3. After
serving five double faults in a row in
the first set, Ahn settled down to
record a 6-3,6-1 victory. She admit
ted to nerves afterwards, saying she
had been too excited to play on the
center courts in her first home
match. Gibbs was a dominating
force in her match, running down
every ball and displaying a powerful
return game. She breezed through
the first set, dropped the first two
games of the second set and then
finished her opponent off, 6-0,6-2.
"They bring a lot of energy,
which obviously picks everyone
up," Barte said. "Nicole is super in
tense and really competitive so I
think that brings the fire out in all of
us. Kristie's a little goofier, but she
turns it on when she needs to.
They're going to do great and
they've added a lot to the team."
Wednesday's match proved to
be the first chance for fans to get a
glimpse of Stanford's recruiting
class, ranked No. 2 by The Tennis
Recruiting Network. Highlighted
by Ahn and Gibbs, the freshman
class also includes touted players in
Amelia Herring and Elizabeth
"Aiyi" Ecker.
"We've got a lot of talent there,"
Forood said. "That's a lot of players
[in the freshmen class] so I think it
bodes well for the future, no doubt.
They're all good players."
Seeded No. 8 in last year's
NCAA Tournament, Stanford was
able to upset both No. 1 Baylor and
No. 4 Notre Dame on its way to win
ning its first NCAA national cham
pionship in four years with a nail
biting 4-3 victory over No. 3 Florida
in the championship match.
With the graduation of senior co

captain Lindsay Burdette, a major
part of that championship run, the
Cardinal was forced to watch one
half of its best doubles pairing walk
away. Burdette paired with current
senior Hilary Barte to claim Stan
ford's 13th overall doubles title in
school history in Lindsay's last
match in school colors. Taking her
place is her younger sister, sopho
more Mallory Burdette.
"Lindsay was a little more ag
gressive," Barte described. "We
both served and volley, and we kind
of took it to them. Mallory is the
same thing, but we take it to them in
a different way in that she puts a lot
of pressure on them from the base
line and then gets in when she has
the opportunity."
So far this season, Barte and
Mallory Burdette have combined to
play in the USTA/ITA National In
door Championships and All-
Americas in the fall, taking home
the trophy at All-Americas in Octo
ber. At Indoors, after losing in the
first round, they made a run to the
consolation final before being
edged by Barbora Kritickova and
Alida Muller-Wehlau of Armstrong
Atlantic State, 8-6.
"They're not quite as dominant
[now] as they were at All-Ameri
can's when they won it in October,"
Forood said. "But you know winning
a national tournament their first
time together is pretty impressive."
A core of veteran seniors, Barte,
McVeigh and Jennifer Yen, will lead
this year's young team. Because of
the large contingent of freshmen on
the team, this senior leadership
could prove essential for the Cardi
nal's success.
"It's definitely an honor [leading
the team]," Barte said. "I can't be
lieve we're seniors first of all, but
I'm excited to show them the ropes
and try to be a model by action
more than anything else."
The team will next put its talents
on display this weekend, hoping to
qualify for National Indoors with
matches against Cal Poly and either
Oklahoma or UNLV. Match time is
2 p.m. Friday and Saturday at Taube
Tennis Stadium.

had been too excited to play on the
center courts in her first home
match. Gibbs was a dominating
force in her match, running down
every ball and displaying a powerful
return game. She breezed through
the first set, dropped the first two
games of the second set and then
finished her opponent off, 6-0,6-2.
"They bring a lot of energy,
which obviously picks everyone
up," Barte said. "Nicole is super in
tense and really competitive so I
think that brings the fire out in all of
us. Kristie's a little goofier, but she
turns it on when she needs to.
They're going to do great and
they've added a lot to the team."
Wednesday's match proved to
be the first chance for fans to get a
glimpse of Stanford's recruiting
class, ranked No. 2 by The Tennis
Recruiting Network. Highlighted
by Ahn and Gibbs, the freshman
class also includes touted players in
Amelia Herring and Elizabeth
"Aiyi" Ecker.
"We've got a lot of talent there,"
Forood said. "That's a lot of players
[in the freshmen class] so I think it
bodes well for the future, no doubt.
They're all good players."
Seeded No. 8 in last year's
NCAA Tournament, Stanford was
able to upset both No. 1 Baylor and
No. 4 Notre Dame on its way to win
ning its first NCAA national cham
pionship in four years with a nail
biting 4-3 victory over No. 3 Florida
in the championship match.
With the graduation of senior co

captain Lindsay Burdette, a major
part of that championship run, the
Cardinal was forced to watch one
half of its best doubles pairing walk
away. Burdette paired with current
senior Hilary Barte to claim Stan
ford's 13th overall doubles title in
school history in Lindsay's last
match in school colors. Taking her
place is her younger sister, sopho
more Mallory Burdette.
"Lindsay was a little more ag
gressive," Barte described. "We
both served and volley, and we kind
of took it to them. Mallory is the
same thing, but we take it to them in
a different way in that she puts a lot
of pressure on them from the base
line and then gets in when she has
the opportunity."
So far this season, Barte and
Mallory Burdette have combined to
play in the USTA/ITA National In
door Championships and All-
Americas in the fall, taking home
the trophy at All-Americas in Octo
ber. At Indoors, after losing in the
first round, they made a run to the
consolation final before being
edged by Barbora Kritickova and
Alida Muller-Wehlau of Armstrong
Atlantic State, 8-6.
"They're not quite as dominant
[now] as they were at All-Ameri
can's when they won it in October,"
Forood said. "But you know winning
a national tournament their first
time together is pretty impressive."
A core of veteran seniors, Barte,
McVeigh and Jennifer Yen, will lead
this year's young team. Because of
the large contingent of freshmen on
the team, this senior leadership
could prove essential for the Cardi
nal's success.
"It's definitely an honor [leading
the team]," Barte said. "I can't be
lieve we're seniors first of all, but
I'm excited to show them the ropes
and try to be a model by action
more than anything else."
The team will next put its talents
on display this weekend, hoping to
qualify for National Indoors with
matches against Cal Poly and either
Oklahoma or UNLV. Match time is
2 p.m. Friday and Saturday at Taube
Tennis Stadium.

Taking center court in its
regular season home opener,
the defending national cham
pion and current No. 1 Stan
ford women's tennis team (1-
0) dominated UC-Davis (1-2)
with a 7-0 score.
Stanford was able to run
through the doubles matches
fairly quickly. Out with a sore
muscle in her stomach, sopho
more Mallory Burdette was re
placed on the No. 1 team by fel
low sophomore Stacey Tan.
Tan and senior captain Hilary
Barte won 8-2. Senior Carolyn
McVeigh and junior Veronica
Li paired up at the No. 3 spot,
also winning 8-2.

Perhaps most interesting
was the No. 2 match, showcas
ing two fresh faces on the team
in freshmen Kristie Ahn and
Nicole Gibbs. In their first reg
ular season match at home, the
two combined for a dominat
ing 8-1 performance that dis
played the talent many have
been expecting them to bring
this year.
"First of all they have a lot
of experience together," said
head coach Lele Forood.

Senior Hilary Barte, above, led the No. 1 Stanford women's tennis
team to a 7-0 victory over UC-Davis in the Cardinal's regular-season
home opener. The team faces Cal Poly this weekend.
"They won a pro tournament last
year, so they're used to [playing] to
gether. They played well in the fall
at regionals and they've taken some
losses since then, so we're trying to
get back on the track of how well
they played in the fall."
The two debuted well in singles
also. Gibbs started at the No. 2 posi
tion while Ahn played No. 3. After
serving five double faults in a row in
the first set, Ahn settled down to
record a 6-3,6-1 victory. She admit
ted to nerves afterwards, saying she
