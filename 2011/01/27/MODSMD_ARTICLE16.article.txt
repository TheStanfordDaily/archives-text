### WILL SEATON STAFF WRITER 
Taking center court in its
regular season home opener,
the defending national cham
pion and current No. 1 Stan
ford women's tennis team (1-
0) dominated UC-Davis (1-2)
with a 7-0 score.
Stanford was able to run
through the doubles matches
fairly quickly. Out with a sore
muscle in her stomach, sopho
more Mallory Burdette was re
placed on the No. 1 team by fel
low sophomore Stacey Tan.
Tan and senior captain Hilary
Barte won 8-2. Senior Carolyn
McVeigh and junior Veronica
Li paired up at the No. 3 spot,
also winning 8-2.

Perhaps most interesting
was the No. 2 match, showcas
ing two fresh faces on the team
in freshmen Kristie Ahn and
Nicole Gibbs. In their first reg
ular season match at home, the
two combined for a dominat
ing 8-1 performance that dis
played the talent many have
been expecting them to bring
this year.
"First of all they have a lot
of experience together," said
head coach Lele Forood.
