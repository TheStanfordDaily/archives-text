# E-records struggle to get off ground
## Study of clinics shows little gain

Electronic health records do not
improve health care quality, even
when accompanied with decision
making software, according to a re
cent Stanford study.
In research published Jan. 24 in
Archives of Internal Medicine, re
searchers found that outpatient clin
ics and doctors' offices using elec
tronic health records from 2005 to
2007 performed better on only one of
20 quality indicators. Furthermore,
doctors with "clinical decision soft
ware" performed better on only one
indicator compared to doctors whose
software gave no diagnosis tips.
The study, authored by Max Ro
mano 'O9 and professor of medicine
Randall Stafford, compared physi
cian survey data on patient visits in
nonfederal offices and hospitals from
2005 to 2007. The researchers then
examined the relationship between
electronic records, decision software

and the quality of care provided,
using a set of 20 quality indicators de
veloped by Stafford in a 2005 study.
The research, which formed the
basis of Romano's senior honors the
sis in human biology, found that
physicians using electronic records
performed better in one indicator
providing diet counseling to at-risk
adults compared with physicians
not using electronic records. Also, the
use of electronic records with deci
sion software led to improved per
formance in one indicator lack of
routine electrocardiogram ordering
compared to doctors without soft
ware capability.
The findings echo those of a 2007
study, also published in Archives, that
showed that electronic health records
alone do not improve patient care.
Romano was aware of the study but
hypothesized that the availability of
decision-making software might af
fect outcomes.

Stanford School of Medicine, above. A recent Stanford study by a medical professor and former Stanford undergraduate
revealed that electronic records had no significant impact on patient care in cases they studied from between
2005 and 2007. "We thought maybe there were too many types of electronic health records and that we should look
at technology with advanced functions," said Max Romano '09, who contributed to the research. They also considered
the effect of "clinical decision software" when coupled with e-records. "You could interpret the results in two
ways," Romano said. "One conclusion is that, in order to make electronic health records work, we have to put more
money [into their implementation]. The opposite conclusion is that maybe they're not all they're cracked up to be."
