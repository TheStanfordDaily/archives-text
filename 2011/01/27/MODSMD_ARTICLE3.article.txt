## Prof says U.S. greentech role will change China, India may lead energy production 
### MARIANNE LEVINE STAFF WRITER 
On the tail of recent research by Stan
ford's Program on Energy and Sustain
able Development (PESD) examining
China's evolving coal and power sectors,
program director and economic professor
Frank Wolak is stressing the changing role
of the U.S. in global sustainable develop
ment.
The United States should focus on in
novation in energy technology now and
then transition to a regulatory role once
the technology has been sufficiently de
veloped, Wolak argued online in The New
York Times this month.
Fie based his argument on the basic
economic theory of comparative advan
tage, which states that countries should
specialize in those goods that they pro
duce most efficiently.
"The U.S. has difficulty competing in
the global market for goods that are inten
sive in unskilled labor, because labor costs
in the U.S. are high relative to those in
China and India," Wolak said in an e-mail
to The Daily. "The U.S. cannot compete
with these countries in the production of
goods that require workers to complete
relatively simple tasks that someone with
out a formal education can do."
Wolak's Times argument helps frame
research published in December by PESD
on China's efforts to restructure its coal
and power industries. This restructuring
would create "coal-power bases" with the
potential to produce more coal annually
than all the coal produced in the U.S.
Although India and China may have an
edge over the U.S. in labor production,
Wolak believes the U.S. has a comparative
advantage when it comes to developing
knowledge-intensive goods.
"Specifically, the U.S. should work on
developing new and innovative technolo
gies that rely on its educated workforce
and well-developed institutions for foster
ing the development of new technologies
and industries," Wolak said.
During the initial stages of a product's
development, Wolak said, it is cheaper to
make the product in the United States
than abroad since problems with the pro-
duction process can be easily iden
tified and "there are benefits to
using a more educated workforce
during the early stages of a product
cycle."
After the product has been de
veloped, however, producers will
most likely shift production to
lower labor-cost regions of the
world, like China or India. Produc
tion in these regions, in the later
stage of a product's development,
tends to be cheaper, making goods
more affordable to the average
American consumer.
Wolak suggests that although
the United States should focus on
the development of new green
technologies, challenges remain.
One of the major challenges to the
development of green technology
in the United States is, according to
Wolak, the lack of a price of carbon.
Coal, natural gas and oil remain the
cheapest energy sources cheap
er than lower-carbon sources of en
ergy. Producers of environmentally
friendly sources of energy, like
wind, solar and other renewables,
are primarily being funded by fed
eral subsidies and tax credits.
"Given the increasing scarcity of
government revenues, it is becom
ing more difficult for governments
to maintain the levels of these sub
sidies," Wolak said. "This means the

green technology industry is going
to have an increasingly difficult
time finding buyers for its products
unless they can make them cost
competitive with conventional fos
sil fuels or find some way to get con
sumers to pay more for energy from
these sources."
According to Wolak, Stanford's
PESD is attempting to resolve this
problem.
"A major area of research at
PESD is identifying mechanisms
for lower carbon sources of energy
to become financially viable in a
world without a price of carbon," he
said, "as well as finding ways to in
troduce carbon pricing in a manner
that does not create significant po
litical resistance, yet encourages
less environmental damage and
more investment in low carbon en
ergy technologies."
