## Prof says U.S. greentech role will change China, India may lead energy production 
### MARIANNE LEVINE STAFF WRITER 
On the tail of recent research by Stan
ford's Program on Energy and Sustain
able Development (PESD) examining
China's evolving coal and power sectors,
program director and economic professor
Frank Wolak is stressing the changing role
of the U.S. in global sustainable develop
ment.
The United States should focus on in
novation in energy technology now and
then transition to a regulatory role once
the technology has been sufficiently de
veloped, Wolak argued online in The New
York Times this month.
Fie based his argument on the basic
economic theory of comparative advan
tage, which states that countries should
specialize in those goods that they pro
duce most efficiently.
"The U.S. has difficulty competing in
the global market for goods that are inten
sive in unskilled labor, because labor costs
in the U.S. are high relative to those in
China and India," Wolak said in an e-mail
to The Daily. "The U.S. cannot compete
with these countries in the production of
goods that require workers to complete
relatively simple tasks that someone with
out a formal education can do."
Wolak's Times argument helps frame
research published in December by PESD
on China's efforts to restructure its coal
and power industries. This restructuring
would create "coal-power bases" with the
potential to produce more coal annually
than all the coal produced in the U.S.
Although India and China may have an
edge over the U.S. in labor production,
Wolak believes the U.S. has a comparative
advantage when it comes to developing
knowledge-intensive goods.
"Specifically, the U.S. should work on
developing new and innovative technolo
gies that rely on its educated workforce
and well-developed institutions for foster
ing the development of new technologies
and industries," Wolak said.
During the initial stages of a product's
development, Wolak said, it is cheaper to
make the product in the United States
than abroad since problems with the pro-
