## GSC discusses funding, gets ASSU update 
### ANNA SCHUESSLER STAFF WRITER 
The Graduate Student Council
(GSC) met briefly on Wednesday
to review upcoming events and
student-group funding for winter
quarter. ASSU President Angeli
na Cardona 'll brought news of
the Undergraduate Senate's ef
fort with GSC co-chair Justin
Brown to address last Thursday's
Faculty Senate meeting.
"Justin spoke about increasing
the stipends for graduate stu
dents, especially international
grad students with families," Car
dona said. "I concentrated on up
dating the Faculty Senate on is
sues of mental health, sexual mis
conduct and relationship abuse on
this campus, and what we're doing
to address them," Cardona said.
Cardona asked GSC members

to inform their constituents about
the new ASSU Executive Action
Grant Program, the Undergradu
ate Senate's measure to work
more directly with student groups
on four specific areas: student
health and wellness, ending sexu
al misconduct and relationship
abuse, campus sustainability
grants and campus unity.
The GSC approved a funding
transfer of a little more than $125
for The Science Bus, a service-ori
ented student group that brings
Stanford students into contact
with grade-school students at the
East Palo Alto Charter School.
During a field trip last December,
the group did not use all the fund
ing it requested for transporta
tion to and from the event, but did
end up paying out of pocket for
student lunches that were sup
posed to be provided by the

school. Voting members looked
favorably upon the group's re
quest and approved the transfer
without opposition.
Representing the Graduate Stu
dent Programming Board (GSPB),
Krystal St. Julien requested $375 for
a lottery dinner at the Banana
a Thai restaurant in Milpitas, so grad
students could "mix and mingle." St.
Julien reported receiving around
100 responses with interest in at
tending lottery dinners, and expect
ed no fewer for this one.
GSC programming co-chair
Joanna Lankester reminded the
GSC of the Rains Karaoke Night
scheduled for Friday. The council
was reminded that the event was
"grad-wide," meaning the event
was not specific to Rains residents.
In the meeting's closing mo
ments, a representative from
Stanford's Vision Earth group

told the council about plans for
Future Fest 2.0, a three-day con
ference seeking to look at issues
of sustainability from a design
perspective. The representative
requested input from the gradu
ate community on what sort of
programming the graduate stu
dents would like to see at such an
event. GSC members took note
of the opportunity and offered
some suggestions.
"Flere at Stanford you have so
many incredible resources," said
Tom Spahn, the council's law rep
resentative. Spahn encouraged Vi
sion Earth to go beyond making
the Stanford community aware of
sustainability issues and attempt to
create a business model or policy
to really make a difference.
