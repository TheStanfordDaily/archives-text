™W" ~V"i> my name is

and politics over
-A- coffee."
"Way too high. Is there any way to
adjust the pitch without changing the
speed and duration?"
"Pitch adjusted."
"Hi, my name is Amanda ..."
"Huh. Way too low now, but the
speed didn't change at all. Go with it."
Meet "Amanda." Amanda is one of
many synthesized voices currently
being used in an experiment conduct
ed by Omosola Odetunde 'l3, Emily
Song 'l3 and Lorin Dole, a first-year
doctoral student in communication.
Their research question: if a robot
gradually changes its voice to match
the voice of the user, will the user like
the robot better? This question could
be applied to everything from self
driving vehicles to kitchen appliances.
Their class. Communication
168/268, started by Clifford Nass in
2002, explores a wide spectrum of
questions relating to human-computer
interactions, such as: does multitasking
while listening to music help one be
more efficient? Is it possible for a car to
persuade its driver to become more
eco-friendly? Can new technology in
cars actually prevent drivers from suc
cumbing to road rage?
Given the rapid frequency with
which social science and technology col
lide, Nass hasn't had any difficulty find
ing research questions for his course.
While it may seem like a tall order, many
of the students in the class do find re
search solutions and even have the pub
lished studies to show for it.
The class works in groups to address
questions about technology, allowing
students to approach problems from
multiple disciplinary perspectives.
"Everyone comes from different
backgrounds and that variety makes
solutions possible," Song said.
Nass wanted groups to span the

"techie-fuzzy" divide. Working sepa
rately is "just not real life ... in any job
virtually everyone works in teams," he
said.
Since most of the class' research
questions are fairly straightforward,
students who have no experience in
computer science can do meaningful
research and learn as they go. In other
words, the goal of the course, as Nass
put it, is to "not let their ignorance be a
barrier." Unlike pure academic disci
plines like math and physics, which
have been more uniformly researched,
changing technology means many sim
ple, new, unanswered questions are
waiting to be explored.
The combination of group work
and opportunity makes discovery so
close students can almost taste it, and
many do. Students with successful
studies from in the class often have
their papers published, sometimes be
fore they complete their undergradu
ate degrees. Basically, students "don't
have to be experts to make huge con
tributions," according to Nass.
"Comm 168 ... makes research ac
cessible for a huge number of stu
dents," Dole said.
A typical example of how research
in the class is conducted is the "Aman
da" experiment. Their group meeting,
which was typical of the class's format,
consisted of brainstorming possible
problems the study might encounter
and finding solutions to address them.
In the case of "Amanda," the pitch vari
ants of male and female voices were
very problematic.
Most the meeting consisted of lis
tening to synthetic voices and playing
the statements at warp speed and slow
er speeds on the computer, analyzing
the different factors that pace and vol
ume play in speech.
The famous Stanford entrepreneur
ial spirit feels present in Nass's course,
where two heads may be better than
one.
