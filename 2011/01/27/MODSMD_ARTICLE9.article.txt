## THE 						CAMPUS BEAT A 						Creation Story 
### Lucas Will Johnson 
The other day, I took an econ
midterm. We were tested on
how well we knew the con
cepts and whether or not we could
use the methods. Painful to study
for, stressful to take. Contrast that
with a computer-music class I'm
also taking: instead of tests, we use
what we're shown in class to com
pose cool computer-music pieces.
At the end, we don't just have a
grade, but a little portfolio of inter
esting recordings. Which method do
you think is more enjoyable and ul
timately more effective? This peda
gogical example is just one illustra
tion of something broader I want to
get at: the awesomeness of creation.
Why do I bring it up? I think we
often let originality go to the way
side. It takes time and effort to
build things. In society's school-to
career-to-retirement pipeline, we
can easily find ourselves simply
going with the flow. You take the
classes, study for the tests, apply for
the jobs, do the work and do fine.
But wouldn't you want to create
things along the way?
Creativity is a powerful type of
satisfaction. Sure, some people in
novate to satisfy their ego: they
want the immortality of leaving a
mark on the world. But I think more
fundamentally, it makes us feel effi
cacious. We have this life force
should we just use it to eat, sleep
and be entertained, or can we use it
to grab the universe and turn it into
something?
I usually use these columns to
focus on improving the music situa
tion at Stanford, and there are plen
ty of avenues for creativity there.
Earlier, I wrote about "guerrilla
musicians," practicing their instru
ments in random places to liven up
the atmosphere. And I've discussed
how musicians are usually trained
to regurgitate music rather than
compose their own, so instead,
every music lesson should include
some improvisation work.
But improving music on campus
doesn't have to be done exclusively
by the musicians. Engineers could
build interesting sonic installments
around campus, for example. I've
seen videos of places where people
have built piano staircases where
each step is a note. Or, to borrow a
friend's idea, imagine if there were
little speakers in White Plaza that
played snippets of music recorded
from the practice rooms in Braun.
Recreational musicians too can
come up with something satisfying.
Dust off the instrument under your
bed and play around for a few min
utes. Get a friend and write a little
song. Open up Garage√üand and hit
record. You might think it's terrible,
but think of it as a doodle. With
enough doodles, occasionally you
draw a cool picture.
And for those who aren't into

writing music, you have plenty of
options for creation too. Instead,
when you write that paper, don't
think of the teacher as the only au
dience. Or with that econ class,
maybe write about economics in a
student publication. Develop that
screenplay you've been talking
about. Build a DIY bookshelf.
Whatever. Make things that you'll
feel satisfied about don't just go
through the paces of education.
With so much said about a "con
sumerist" culture, I think it's time
we realign towards a "creationist"
culture. Not "how we got here" bib
lical creationism, but "where should
we go next" creationism.
If we want that kind of creative
world, we'll need more forgiveness.
Because when we hold high expec
tations on quality, we can find our
selves being mean critics. Giving
constructive feedback is fine, but it
should be coupled with enthusiastic
encouragement; originality is for
everyone. Google famously gives
employees 20 percent of their time
devoted to passion projects. What if
Stanford, or even all of society,
worked like that? Instead of just
weekends to relax, we took a whole
week off each year to go out and
create things.
Now, this is my last column. It's
been a good quarter for me of op-ed
creativity about music. But before I
return to writing music itself, I want
to encourage anyone else who cares
about music on campus to not wait
until senior year (like I did) to get
more involved.There's always more
to do.
But most of all, enjoy the music.

Wouldn't you
want to create
things along
the way?
