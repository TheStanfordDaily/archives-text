## GEARING UP TO TAKE FLIGHT 
### ZAHRATAJI 
Room 001 of the William F.
Durand Building in the
Engineering Quad, the
Space and Systems De
velopment Laboratory
(SSDL), is clustered with a variety
of tools and machinery. At the en
trance, there is a shelf lined with
rovers that once moved across the
Quad in search of water on an extra
terrestrial planet. On one of the
shelves, there is a black and white
photograph of The Stanford Daily's
photography team in 1981. The walls
are covered with satellite images,
and flow charts and formulas are
sprawled across whiteboards.
Sitting behind his desk is Andrew
Kalman 'B5, professor of aeronau
tics and astronautics, typing away on
his computer.
"I have been playing catch-up
with my schedule for, like, 10 years
now," he said.
In 1981, when Kalman was an un
dergraduate at Stanford studying
electrical engineering, he was an
avid biker, frequently visited the
Dish and photographed for The
Daily. While he was on the Farm, he
discovered the mechanical engi
neering shop and spent most of his

time working there, indulging in his
passion for design.
Breaking and Mending
While he was working on his doc
torate in electrical engineering at
the University of Florida, Kalman
started working as a junior engineer
at Stanford Research Systems, a
company started by Stanford gradu
ate students. He later left to start an
other company, Euphonies, with a
few friends. The company grew to be
a dominant pro audio-mixing con
sole company in the United States.
However, he also left Euphonies in
1994, not entirely satisfied because
he was not a musician at heart.

He went on to found Pumpkin in
1995, which, initially meant to be a
data acquisition company, soon be
came a real-time operating system
company.

In 1998, Kalman returned to
Stanford, where he learned about
small satellite activities. He started
teaching and doing research at the
University, later becoming a con
sulting professor in aeronautics and
astronautics. In line with Kalman's
interest in small satellites. Pumpkin
launched the Cube Sat kit, a small
satellite that was built to go into
Low Earth Orbit (LEO) missions.
Around 2008, he became the di

rector of SSDL, where he focused
on ensuring that students have the
chance to gain real hands-on experi
ence.
"I think it's critical that students
go beyond writing up a proposal and
doing some analysis in MATLAB ..
. to actually building the real thing
and iterating upon that," he said.
Kalman said his best learning ex
periences are often not his successes.
"I learn by doing and by making

mistakes," he said. "I've broken
many machine tools. I've screwed up
parts when I was making them...
but by doing so, it's made me a better
engineer."
Over the course of his engineer
ing career, Kalman found that he be
came better at looking at ways he
could improve his own performance.
"I think as a student you have to
be more than a little bit receptive to
criticism," he said. "I think at this

stage in most young peoples' lives,
everyone thinks they know every
thing."
Kalman said two important ways
of coping with failure are to keep try
ing and to seek help from teammates
who have more expertise.
Progress "doesn't happen
overnight," he said. "You've got to
work on that and work on that and
work on that."

Looking to the future, Kalman
said having a diversified skill set
might be a key factor in differentiat
ing engineers. Kalman himself is a
digital and analog electronic engi
neer, an embedded coder and also
works on PCB board layout and me
chanical design.
"I try to be as multidimensional
as I can, and I've developed those
skill sets over 25, 30 years at this
point," he said.

Kalman noted that one of the
best parts of his job at Stanford is the
opportunity to interact with stu
dents.

"The students at Stanford now
are way smarter than they were
when I was here. I don't think I
could get in anymore," he said,
laughing.
