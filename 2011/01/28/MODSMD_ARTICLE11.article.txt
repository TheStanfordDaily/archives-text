## NEWS BRIEFS Charity Fashion Show leaves Stanford for San Francisco 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Ellen Huet 
Charity Fashion Show (CFS) an
nounced today that it will hold its an
nual fashion show at San Francisco's
Fort Mason Center, not Stanford, in
April.

CFS producer Thom Scher 'll
said CFS is intent on maintaining
some connections to Stanford, but
said the organization is no longer an
official student group and technical
ly is no longer associated with the
University. Stanford students will
still organize the event and hope to
call upon Stanford community
members as both attendees and
models as it has in years past, he said.

Last spring, CFS faced a deficit
after its event and could not make a
donation to its charitable recipient,
Kiva.The group encouraged individ
ual donations instead. Scher hopes
that this year, given the new location
and new fundraising freedom that
comes with no longer being a stu
dent group, CFS will raise more
funds for its yet unnamed charity
and avoid last year's situation.
Fundraising guidelines and
event planning at Stanford make
hosting a large, sponsor-driven event
such as CFS "sort of a challenge,"
Scher said, who was a Student Activ
ities and Leadership peer advisor as
of fall 2010.

"As a student group, we were
bound by guidelines," he added, say
ing the situation made it hard to cap
italize on sponsorships and made the
process "financially difficult."
