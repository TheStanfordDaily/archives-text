## Stanford, you're hired! 'Apprentice5 spinoff comes to Stanford TV 
### ERIN INMAN STAFF WRITER 
Eight Stanford undergraduates
will soon face off in a Stanford-pro
duced version of the TV show "The
Apprentice," competing in business
situations for a final prize.

The show is a collaboration be
tween the Stanford Cardinal
Broadcasting Network (SCBN)
and the Stanford Pre-Business As
sociation (SPBA), the group of un
dergraduates who coined the idea.
Following roughly the same for
mat as the popular NBC show, each
week the teams will be introduced to
a challenge, develop and execute a
business plan and be judged on their
success, said assistant producer and
SPBA member Matt Ikeler 'l4.
"This is a business-related
show," said Michael Wheet 'll,
SCBN station manager. "One of the
goals is to give students the business
experience in a competitive envi
ronment, to see what the real busi
ness world is like."

Before each competition, the
two teams of four will have access to
a team of advisers consisting of
M.B.A. students from the Graduate
School of Business, local entrepre
neurs and venture capitalists.
Stanford's "Apprentice" has al
ready gained the support of Silicon
Valley by procuring sponsorships
from Bling Nation and Mohr Davi
dow Ventures. Mohr Davidow Ven

tures' client base of angel investors
will help develop or participate in
the challenges, while Bling Nation
will help with transferring the funds
that teams win in challenges.
With contestants selected just
last week, the producers are still de
veloping three to five weeklong
challenges, the first of which is set to
occur during "Entrepreneurship
Week" from Feb. 23 to March 2,
Ikeler said.

Applicants were required to sub
mit a one-minute video showcasing
their talents. In reviewing the appli
cations, SPBA was looking for peo
ple who had camera appeal, said ex
ecutive producer and SPBA board
member Chase Harmon 'l3.

"My friends came at me with a
video camera and said, 'You're
going to do it,"' said applicant Kevin
Shutzberg 'l4, who was eventually
chosen as a contestant for the
"techie"team.

Successful video applicants were
offered interviews and evaluated
for their ability to think outside the
box and be part of a team, Harmon
said.

The producers chose to focus on
a team format. "Students can align
with their self-designated side and
see how each side of the mind
comes to work and how different
approaches come to be," Harmon
said.
While details of the grand prize
have yet to be determined, Harmon
said the current $30,000 in accrued
prize money might go to companies
to sponsor summer internships for
the winning team. Contestants
could also win prizes for each chal
lenge, such as golf outings or lunch
es with big Silicon Valley thinkers.
Seven SPBA associates will
begin production in February.
SCBN provided the necessary
equipment, crew and distribution
and has given SPBA creative liberty
in editing the footage, with no cap
on the number or length of
episodes.
Both organizations are opti
mistic that the first episode will pre
miere early spring quarter on
SCBN's Channel 5 and website,
SPBA is working with MTVU to get
a broadcasting deal.
The association is confident
about reaching "all members of Sil
icon Valley interested ... by the
amazing Stanford student potential
showcased by the show," Harmon
said.
