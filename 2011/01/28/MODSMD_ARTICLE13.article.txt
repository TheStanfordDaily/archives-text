## LETTER FROM THE EDITOR Lessons in the Daily archives 
### 
When a federal judge in San
Francisco ruled Proposi
tion 8 unconstitutional
last August, two of my Daily col
leagues jumped into action to cap
ture reactions in the Stanford com
munity. On deadline, they reported
an excellent story for our weekly
summer edition, bringing us candid
scenes happening in the wake of
the ruling.
They found one senior, Aidan
Dunn, savoring what he called "a
great day" after his years of ac
tivism. "For me personally," he said,
"it means that someday I might be
able to marry the person that I
love."

I turned to The Daily's archives
that day, hoping to understand the
context of the moment for Dunn
and others. What I found was an as
tonishing trove of work from the
nearly two years since Prop. B's bal
lot appearance. It spanned several
Daily volumes, bearing the names
of more than a dozen writers and
photographers, and probably in
volved as many editors. It chroni
cled the struggles of hundreds of
Stanford students students on
both sides of the issue in the
streets, the classroom and the
polling station.
What stood out, particularly,
was the persistence of The Daily's
coverage, even as the organization
saw changes in leadership and staff
over the years. Each story mat
tered. Each one aimed to advance
our understanding of the issue as it
played out on campus. And, little by
little, each one succeeded.The story
by Amy Julia Harris and Jane LeP
ham in August became the newest

in that body of work.
It was invaluable that day, and
remains so. As Bill Keller, the exec
utive editor of The New York
Times, wrote this week, "Ninety
nine percent of what we read or
hear on the news does not pro
foundly change our understanding
of how the world works. News
mostly advances by inches and feet,
not in great leaps."
For the Stanford community.
The Daily's archives contain count
less stories that did just that. They
draw people to the office to this day
researchers, alumni, students
and passer-by alike, all finding
value in the persistence of this his
toric community newspaper over
the decades.

Advancing the news is what I
hope we have done in Volume
238, a volume I have been hon
ored to lead for nearly seven
months. I thank our selfless and
skilled deputy editor, Jacob Jaffe,
and the rest of the terrific team
that produced this volume. I'm
confident that our work has, little
by little, added to the larger Stan
ford story, and I couldn't ask for
much more.

The next Daily staff will pick up
that responsibility, and with it,
enjoy editorial independence and a
home in the heart of campus. I urge
them to take that seriously, to find
their own ways to advance Stan
ford news and to enjoy the experi
ence.
Our readers are in great hands.
