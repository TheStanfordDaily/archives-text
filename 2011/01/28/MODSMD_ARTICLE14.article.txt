# SENSE AND NONSENSE
## Pathways for Angels 
### Aysha Bagchi 
At a Faculty Senate meeting
last November, the co-chairs
of SUES (the Study of Un
dergraduate Education at Stanford)
presented a draft document propos
ing three broad and overlapping
aims of a Stanford education: first,
the acquisition and creation of
knowledge; second, developing intel
lectual and practical skills; and third,
helping equip students to live cre
ative, responsible and reflective lives.
In the Q-and-A from Faculty Sen
ators, one professor posed an inter
esting question: "I don't see why you
need the third piece of this puzzle. If
we have people acquiring knowledge
and intellectual and practical skills,
why do we think there's some other
thing out there about living a creative
life which we haven't provided them
with the knowledge and tools to ac
quire or act on?" I can't help thinking
the professor might have felt as if, to
paraphrase Albie Sachs (who was
paraphrasing Shakespeare), some
men are born politically correct,
some achieve political correctness
and he was having political correct
ness thrust upon him!
The professor's question prompt
ed a couple dozen faculty members
to almost jump out of their chairs
with protests, so it looks like the third
goal of fostering creative, responsible
and reflective lives is here to stay. But
the professor, I think, had a point
worth exploring: Is an institution of
higher education about formal, engi
neered learning alone (embodied in
knowledge and skills) or does it also
have a job to play in a less formulaic
arena? Should questions about a
good or meaningful life be regarded
as central to a liberal education? Can
the University do anything to help
students ask or answer those ques
tions, and do they require more than
formal knowledge and skills?
A look into history seems to shed
some light on the question. In
"Roads to Modernity," Gertrude
Himmelfarb draws an interesting
contrast between what she suggests
were distinct British and French En
lightenments. The French moral
philosophers aimed to rigorously
apply high-scale philosophical think
ing to political communities and
were much more adamantly opposed
to religion than their British and
American contemporaries. The
British Enlightenment figures
looked to social virtues more than
the force of reason as the basis of a
healthy and humane society. The

question for both was: How can we
create the good society? The French
answer was by serious, sophisticated
reasoning (the head). The British an
swer was by fostering a certain spiri
tual temperament (the heart).
When it comes to fostering a bet
ter society, I see the two philosophies
as closely related. Knowledge and
systematic reasoning can have major
effects on the degree to which an indi
vidual leads a creative, responsible
and reflective life. Take responsibility.
Knowing more about the underlying
causes of poverty and knowing how
to engage with arguments about how
best to help the world's poorest will
help us lead more responsible lives. In
this sense, we see that knowledge and
muscular thinking are strong tools
with which to better guide our deci
sions.

But knowledge and muscular
thinking are not at the heart of living a
more creative, reflective or responsi
ble life. They are merely tools that as
sume a prior foundation. For example,
knowing more about poverty and
knowing how to think critically about
the arguments involved only helps me
live a more responsible life if I care
about poverty, and if I care in more
than an intellectual sense. This is a
question about whether desolate
human conditions make me feel

How can
we create
the good
society?

angry. It is a question about whether I
feel entitled to what I have. It is a
question about what kind of life I
think will be meaningful, of whether I
have even considered that question in
a personal way.
These questions are not answered
through knowledge transmission or
inculcating skills. That is not even
how they truly get asked. These are
matters of the heart, of igniting per
sonal queries in students, of respond
ing to hungers for a college experi
ence that involves growing in pro
found and transformational ways.
Such growth requires spheres involv
ing some mystery, spheres in which
students will be affected in different
ways and to different degrees. The
people we connect with, the new
places we venture into, the teachers
and mentors that ignite fires within
us, the movies and music and books
and art that somehow manage to

transform us. These pathways toward
personal transformation make us
more appreciative of the opportunity
to learn, more deliberate in directing
our education and more reflective
about our lives beyond Stanford.
Dorm life, student clubs, studying
abroad, public service, teachers and
mentors, the arts, sports and hobbies,
reflection a liberal education
must include pathways with unpre
dictable outcomes, unspecified ends.
As Rabindranath Tagore describes
in his "My Boyhood Days," we ven
ture down such pathways so that
"some angel from a strange and un
expected quarter may cross our path,
speaking the language of our own
soul, and enlarging the boundaries of
the heart's possessions." A Stanford
education is, in part, about opening
pathways for angels to enter.
