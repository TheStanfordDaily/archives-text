# OH! SWEET NUTHIN'
## Standard Time 
### Roseann Cima 
Alan Lightman wrote a book in
1996 entitled "Einstein's
Dreams." Einstein was famous
for his facility with hypotheticals, and
solved some of physics' hardest prob
lems by spinning yards and yards of
thought experiments. He had enlarged
parietal lobes, apparently.

"Einstein's Dreams" is a fictional ex
ploration of what those experiments
might've been, as Einstein toiled away
in a patent office, dreaming up relativity.
It tastes like Calvino. In one world, time
passes more slowly farther from the
earth's center. In an attempt to "live
longer," in this world all the rich build
their homes, shops and gymnasiums on
stilts. The poor sow their seeds in the for
gotten soil and frolic in the abandoned
brooks and rivers. In another world,
time passes more slowly for something
the faster it moves through space. This
chapter is buried in the middle and full
of preternaturally powered automo
biles.

Finally, in a third world, time is
merely stretched. Or man's experi
ence of it is compressed. It takes a liter
al lifetime for the earth to complete a
full rotation. People age as we do
process the world and each other at
the same rate as us but we only see
one day, as opposed to 25,000. Born at
sunrise, you're middle-aged at sunset,
depending on the season. It is a terrify
ing environment.
In this world, each individual has to
witness a grand transformation.
Whether born in night or daytime,
someday the world suddenly, defini
tively (though not without warning),
becomes a completely foreign place.
This world can be interpreted as
our own, as I'm afraid they are all
meant to be. Because this happens.
Over the course of a life the world mu
tates beyond recognition. You go
about your life minding your own

business and then wouldn't you
know it time is no longer absolute.
Electricity is magnetism. The earth is
round.

Please appreciate the delta caused
by the discoveries. So much happens!
Imagine living to see horse-drawn car
riages replaced by automobiles. It only
took a few decades. If you're in your
20s in the trenches, you're in your 50s
when they drop the bomb, and you've
still got 'Nam, psychedelia and the
flower people ahead of you. Imagine
growing up in a world of high neck
lines, where the phonograph was a
novelty, as was jazz, and ending up in a
world of Elvis and broadcast televi
sion. No wonder they were so ornery.

The idea of the event horizon is
borrowed from physics. It describes
the line of proximity to a black hole,
beyond which events (and light) can
not affect an outside observer.
"Einstein's Dreams" is about the
different worlds beyond the different
possible answers to the problem of rel
ativity. How ideas shape history. Our
narrator is pessimistic for the individu
als who get lost in the flow of time:
"When the sunrise comes," he says,
"those born at sunset are over
whelmed by the sudden sight of trees
and oceans and mountains, are blind
ed by daylight, return to their houses
and cover their windows, spend the
rest of their lives in half light."
But we've already crossed one
event horizon in our lifetimes. We were
young, sure, but still, we made it! Re
member before the Internet? Re
member before the household PC?
The laptop? The cell phone? The
smartphone? People our age were
keeping paper address books and
using landlines less than a decade ago.
Somehow we went, in my own person
al memory, from nobody in the U.S.
suburbs having a cell phone to every

Calcutta rickshaw walla carrying one
in his dust-saturated shirt.

And just think of all the software
that's changed our lives. Life (or re
search) before Google? Nobody reads
the whole book anymore! They just
sample a few pages and slap it in their
thesis paper (for which, if it's vetted
enough, someone else will likely do
the same). And Facebook was merely
budding four years ago.
I'm not saying each of these tech
nological and cultural advances consti
tuted an "event horizon" in and of it
self. But I am saying the world is a rad
ically different place than it was 10
years ago, and while we were young
and supple then, adaptive now, there's
certainly more to come. Computation
al genetics and artificial intelligence
are ticking time bombs of the future.
There are a couple big paradigmatic
problems, and once we've moved past
them, who knows? (People making
machines making machines making
people. Maybe. That'll be interesting.)

It's unclear whether we are
doomed to hiding in the dark. Some
seem to think we'll be able to keep up.
This may just be naivete,but I'm some
what convinced when people say the
cultural/technological rate of change
seems to be increasing. Lightman's
days are getting shorter before our
eyes, to the point that we're almost
used to it. Hence the hope for a psychi
cally comfortable future. But I don't
think we'd ever get off that easy. If
we've adapted to constantly adapting,
that can change, too: a shift abstracted
up a level. Whether darkness or light
lies beyond the horizon, we'll just have
to wait and see.

we've adapted to constantly adapting,
that can change, too: a shift abstracted

Alan Lightman wrote a book in
1996 entitled "Einstein's
Dreams." Einstein was famous
for his facility with hypotheticals, and
solved some of physics' hardest prob
lems by spinning yards and yards of
thought experiments. He had enlarged
parietal lobes, apparently.

"Einstein's Dreams" is a fictional ex
ploration of what those experiments
might've been, as Einstein toiled away
in a patent office, dreaming up relativity.
It tastes like Calvino. In one world, time
passes more slowly farther from the
earth's center. In an attempt to "live
longer," in this world all the rich build
their homes, shops and gymnasiums on
stilts. The poor sow their seeds in the for
gotten soil and frolic in the abandoned
brooks and rivers. In another world,
time passes more slowly for something
the faster it moves through space. This
chapter is buried in the middle and full
of preternaturally powered automo
biles.

Finally, in a third world, time is
merely stretched. Or man's experi
ence of it is compressed. It takes a liter
al lifetime for the earth to complete a
full rotation. People age as we do
process the world and each other at
the same rate as us but we only see
one day, as opposed to 25,000. Born at
sunrise, you're middle-aged at sunset,
depending on the season. It is a terrify
ing environment.
In this world, each individual has to
witness a grand transformation.
Whether born in night or daytime,
someday the world suddenly, defini
tively (though not without warning),
becomes a completely foreign place.
This world can be interpreted as
our own, as I'm afraid they are all
meant to be. Because this happens.
Over the course of a life the world mu
tates beyond recognition. You go
about your life minding your own

business and then wouldn't you
know it time is no longer absolute.
Electricity is magnetism. The earth is
round.

Please appreciate the delta caused
by the discoveries. So much happens!
Imagine living to see horse-drawn car
riages replaced by automobiles. It only
took a few decades. If you're in your
20s in the trenches, you're in your 50s
when they drop the bomb, and you've
still got 'Nam, psychedelia and the
flower people ahead of you. Imagine
growing up in a world of high neck
lines, where the phonograph was a
novelty, as was jazz, and ending up in a
world of Elvis and broadcast televi
sion. No wonder they were so ornery.

The idea of the event horizon is
borrowed from physics. It describes
the line of proximity to a black hole,
beyond which events (and light) can
not affect an outside observer.
"Einstein's Dreams" is about the
different worlds beyond the different
possible answers to the problem of rel
ativity. How ideas shape history. Our
narrator is pessimistic for the individu
als who get lost in the flow of time:
"When the sunrise comes," he says,
"those born at sunset are over
whelmed by the sudden sight of trees
and oceans and mountains, are blind
ed by daylight, return to their houses
and cover their windows, spend the
rest of their lives in half light."
But we've already crossed one
event horizon in our lifetimes. We were
young, sure, but still, we made it! Re
member before the Internet? Re
member before the household PC?
The laptop? The cell phone? The
smartphone? People our age were
keeping paper address books and
using landlines less than a decade ago.
Somehow we went, in my own person
al memory, from nobody in the U.S.
suburbs having a cell phone to every

Calcutta rickshaw walla carrying one
in his dust-saturated shirt.

And just think of all the software
that's changed our lives. Life (or re
search) before Google? Nobody reads
the whole book anymore! They just
sample a few pages and slap it in their
thesis paper (for which, if it's vetted
enough, someone else will likely do
the same). And Facebook was merely
budding four years ago.
