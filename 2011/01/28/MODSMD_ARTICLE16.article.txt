# FOREIGN CORRESPONDENCE
## The 						Real Madrid 
### Clayton Holz 
I had to go looking for Spain. In
preparing for the trip, I had
worked so hard to cover all my
bases to plan ahead for imminent
contingencies, to have all the scraps
and bits and bones of America in my
suitcase and at an arm's reach

that I almost missed the country I
had to come live in.
I am fortunate in that the current
group of students in the BOSP
Madrid program is extremely close
surely an anomaly among abroad
experiences. Accordingly, in our first

two weeks in Spain, we did all the
things we had predicted that we
would we listened to a lecture in
the Prado, eyes dutifully directed to
wards the works of Goya, el Greco
and Velasquez; botellon-e d in frigid
town squares at midnight before
venturing off into thumping discote
cas that showed no signs of slowing
down at four, five and six in the
morning; voraciously tore through
Big Macs when we weren't sure of
what else to eat; spoke English.
This was comfortable behavior.

Yet as I Skyped my way home every
night, started a 60-hour internship at
a local bank, and awoke my first Fri
day, Saturday and Sunday with the
sun in descent, I began to realize that
this was not the Spain I had come for.
Rather, it was Stanford, cleverly dis
guised in tastefully restrained Euro
pean clothing. I was neglecting to
live in the real Madrid, a city of seri
ous faces, gorgeous glimpses into his
tory and a language that bombarded
me at largely unintelligible speeds.
During my first week of real
classes, I returned home from the In
ternational Institute and got to my
front door. I opened it and walked
inside, but, for some reason, the door
would not close. It seemed that the
lock was jammed, so I went and
asked my roommate for help, but
neither he nor my host sister was
able to do anything about it. Bewil
dered, I told my host mother, who
was busily preparing lunch, that the
door wouldn't close. After a hasty in
spection and a slew of maldicciones,
she stormed off to call a locksmith,
proclaiming the door inexorably
broken. My roommate and I ate our
food in tense silence, listening to our
host mother's shrill ranting through
the walls. After a few minutes she
walked in: "Alright, which one of
you am I going to kill?"
I tepidly raised my hand, at
tempting to utter an apology but
finding the Spanish words insuffi
cient and awkward. "I'll pay for it,
an-and wait for the locksmith so that
you don't have to I, I'm so sorry,"
I stammered.

"No, you won't be able to pay be
cause you'll be dead before he gets
here. D-e-a-d," she spelled out. Her
fuming needed no translation. "I
thought you kids were supposed to
be smart how could you break a
door?"

"I swear, I just turned the ... "
Before I could finish she stormed
out again. I looked incredulously at
my roommate and began thinking
that this wasn't the way I had envi
sioned my demise.
Then something miraculous hap
pened. Somehow over the course of
the next 15 minutes, the three of us
were sitting together at the table,

talking like old friends. The inferno
seemed to have dissipated, and I
thought I could see a smile hiding
behind that pair of wrinkled eyes
that I did not yet understand. We
spoke of idiosyncrasies, our families
and the like, and I thought that I just
might be in the clear.
Thinking things assuaged, I ven
tured a joke: "Well, it's a good thing
I've got this International Student
Card anyway, because with it, the
U.S. will pay for the repatriation of
my remains..."
The easy string of voluble dialogue
snapped; our host mother looked me
square in the eyes: "When I'm done
with you, there won't be anything to
send back to the United States."
And so began my first week of
life in the real Madrid.
So too began my faltering at
tempts at using Spanish in stores and
with friends, my stories left utterly
without crescendo and climax in their
foreign tongue. 1 have sampled faba
da, a Spanish bean stew, and la tortilla
espanola, which is nothing like the
tortilla we Californians know but sig
nificantly better. I have spent whole
afternoons exploring the majestic
parks of Madrid, getting lost in the fo
liage and farther from my iPhone
with every step. I have grown to real
ly like my host mother, and I eagerly
await mealtimes, when I can eat her
delicious food and listen to her deci
sive views on just about everything.
By no means am I any sort of expert
on the city of Madrid ask any of
my friends how many times I've
taken the wrong Metro line, or taken
the right one in the wrong direction.
Rather, I am settling into the lifestyle
that I came here for, one that is decid
edly not Stanford. I know I will be
back on the Farm soon enough. Until
then, I will continue exploring and
peering between the hazy lines of
translation.
