## Stanford tests stem cells University joins world's first trial study 
### ELLORAISRANI STAFF WRITER 
On Monday, doctors at Stanford
Hospital and Santa Clara Valley Med
ical Center became the third group cer
tified to participate in a nationwide
trial of embryonic stem cell therapy for
patients paralyzed by spinal cord in
jury.

Funded and run by Geron, a Menlo
Park-based biopharmaceutical com
pany, this is the first clinical trial in the
world of human embryonic stem cell
therapy. Certified by the FDA for test
ing on 10 patients, the phase-one study
aims to test the safety of this treatment.
Stanford's involvement began in
2007, when Geron contacted Gary
Steinberg, chair of the Department of
Neurosurgery.
"They contacted me because of my
interest and involvement in stem cell
therapy for neurologic diseases," Stein
berg said. "I've been involved for a long
time, both in the laboratory and clini
cally."
"At the microscopic level, what was
happening to the spinal cords [in in
jured patients] was the axons the ca
bles running past the injury were
still intact, but the lining, the insulation
of the nerve cells, had died," said Marco
Lee, professor of neurosurgery. "The
thesis is, can we replace the cells that
had died which were responsible for
remyelinating that is, relining
the neurons?"

The theory for the trials comes from
successful experiments done at UC-
Irvine that delivered a similar treat
ment to rodents with spinal cord in
juries.

After Valley Medical Center
identifies and pre-screens a pa
tient, Geron will deliver em
bryonic stem cells to Stanford,
where they will be prepared
and checked for viability and
stability. The actual injection of
the cells will take place at Valley
Medical Center and will be per
formed by Steinberg and Lee.
"The procedure is to deliver an

embryonic derived cell. It's not actu
ally the embryonic cell itself, and
that's a confusing point sometimes,"
Steinberg said. "These are human
embryonic stem cell-derived oligo
dendrocyte progenitors, which are
the cells that produce myelin, the in
sulation of nerves."
The other two approved sites in the
country Northwestern and the
Shepherd Center in Atlanta have
already injected one patient with the
stem cells and screened another.
Geron has proposed a total of seven
sites. Ultimately, the distribution of the
10 patients around the country will de
pend on subject availability.
"The patients will be enrolled by
different sites," Steinberg said. "There's
not a limit necessarily to any one site
enrolling more than one, but it's a rare
disease. It's a rare injury. So it's unpre
dictable where the patients will be en
rolled depending on which sites are up
and going."
Researchers are also facing the
challenge of retaining the subjects they
can find. Patients are physically dis
abled — most have suffered injuries
from car accidents, falls or sports
but mentally stable.
"Like Christopher Reed, they have
all their mind there," Lee said. "When
you run a trial like that, it's actually an
important consideration. You need
motivated patients to stick with you. A
trial is not simply injecting stem cells.

It's everything that comes after that."
The first goal of this trial is not effi
cacy but rather safety that is, the de
termination of the treatment's safety in
humans before it can be tested in a larg
er group.

"Phase one in any trial... is always
about safety," Lee said. "But, having
said that, we're obviously not going to
run a trial and just look at safety, even
though that's our primary aim. So we
have secondary aims... which [are] to
see whether patients have recovery."
Their recoveries will be measured
with physical and psychological assess
ments in the year after the injection, as
well as continuing follow-up for 15
years after treatment.
Ultimately, if the phase-one trial
proves the safety of the treatment,
phase-two and -three trials could test
its efficacy, especially in a greater num
ber of patients with less severe spinal
cord damage.
"The greatest benefit would come
to people with mild weakness. It could
convert them back to normal," Lee
said. "Or they have severe weakness,
but you could convert them back to
mild weakness."
