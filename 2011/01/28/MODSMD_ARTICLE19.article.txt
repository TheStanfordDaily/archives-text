### BROOKE DAVIS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford women's gymnastics team
made its home debut last Sunday, taking on
No. 1 UCLA in a preseason meet at Burn
ham Pavilion. The No. 2 Cardinal left with a
196.200-194.825 victory and high hopes for
the fast-approaching season.
Leading the way for Stanford were Shel
ley Alexander and Ashley Morgan, who left
the meet with high rankings and a few com
mendations. Alexander, a senior from
Seguin, Texas, was named the Pac-10 gym
nast of the week while Morgan, a sophomore
from Danville, Calif., was awarded the Pac
-10 special performance of the week. Both
gymnasts hold national top-10 rankings for
their events, with Alexander ranked sixth for
all-around and fourth for the beam. Morgan
also holds two rankings, first for the floor ex
ercise and sixth for the beam.

As the season continues, Stanford will
need leadership from its core of four cap
tains: Alexander, fifth-year senior Allyse
Ishino, junior Alyssa Brown and senior
Danielle Ikoma.This will be Ikoma's second
season as captain. Last season, Stanford fin
ished fourth at the NCAA Super Six Finals,
and even with the loss of first-team All-
Americans Blair Ryland and Carly Janiga,
the Cardinal is working to surpass its fourth
place finish in last season's finals.
This Friday, the Cardinal will face No. 4
Utah in Salt Lake City. With Stanford at 7-0
and the Utes at 3-0, the meet will determine
which team moves on with an unblemished
record. Although Stanford is the highest
ranked team on Utah's schedule, the Cardi
nal has never defeated the Utes in their
home arena.

The Utes faced UCLA on Jan. 7, narrow
ly defeating the Bruins by four-tenths of a
point. More recently, Utah is coming off a
victory over No. 3 Georgia on Jan. 15. Both
meets were away from Salt Lake City, and
Stanford will be facing the Utes in their
home opener.
For all their talent, the Utes will be miss
ing one of their best gymnasts. Kyndal Ro-
