## Frat heads to hearing Kappa Sig faces nationals in Vegas 
### ELLEN HUET MANAGING EDITOR 
About 20 Kappa Sigma mem
bers are set to travel to Las Vegas
this weekend to meet with the fra
ternity's national Supreme Execu
tive Committee (SEC) to address
allegations of misconduct that led
to the chapter being put on suspen
sion by the University last October.
Mitchell Wilson, Kappa Sigma
executive national director, called
this weekend's planned meeting a
disciplinary hearing in which the
committee, comprised of five mem
bers of the board of directors, five
support staff and volunteer offi
cers, will review allegations that the
chapter violated the Kappa Sigma
code of conduct.

"Kappa Sigma members will
have the opportunity to come in
and make their statements," Wilson
said. "The board can ask them
questions and, if allegations are
true, decide what will be done
about it."
Wilson said it is "more than like
ly" that the committee will make a
decision regarding the allegations
that day.
Harris Brown 'll, former Kappa
Sigma president, said it was likely
the chapter would know the results
of the SEC appearance "shortly"
after the discussion, but said the
possible outcomes of the decision
"span a wide spectrum." He de
clined to say what consequences
the group might face,
Wilson said the committee
would evaluate a presentation by
Kappa Sigma members based on
the terms of the national organiza
tion's code of conduct. He added
that "each case is different" and
that there is not a "real set form of
discipline."
Asked about the possible out
comes of the hearing, Wilson said it
would be "irresponsible" of him to
speculate.
The hearing is set for Kappa
Sigma's national convention, which
happens twice a year.
Campus officials placed Kappa
Sigma on provisional alcohol and
party suspension in October after
reports of an alleged unregistered
event during New Student Orien
tation. A Greek organization can
be put on suspension if it violates
the University's controlled sub
stances and alcohol policy, which
includes hosting parties during
"dry" weekends.
