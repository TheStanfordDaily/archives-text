# Sexism in sports: How'equal' are we?
## 
### Tom Taylor 
Two soccer commenta
tors in the UK were in
trouble this week after
making degrading off
air comments before
kickoff about a female soccer offi
cial last weekend. On the grounds
of her gender, they questioned her
understanding of the offside rule

often considered the most con
fusinglawofthe game but, iron
ically, she then went on to make a
great call in a difficult offsides situ
ation early on in the match, cor
rectly allowing a goal. One of the
gentlemen in question seemed to
have survived by making a swift
phone call to apologize to the offi
cial, but has now resigned, and the
other was fired by Sky Sports after
the network uncovered many
more sexist outbursts behind the
scenes.
The fall from grace of two of the
U.K.'s biggest soccer pundits has
seemed as shocking as it was sud
den. These two men have been the
face of Sky's coverage since the
channel was launched over 18
years ago. Almost no one, though,
has stood up for them to claim this
was simply harmless banter; few
who have heard or read the full
transcript could conclude anything
else but that they were spouting
heartfelt prejudice. But are they re
ally as alone as they would seem? If
two high-profile sports commenta
tors could last for so many years
with their chauvinism both intact
and unrevealed, then surely we
must suspect the problems of sex
ism to remain widespread within
the industry.
Back on America's side of the
Atlantic, Title IX enshrines equali
ty in college for both male and fe
male athletes but even then, it is
not a true equality. Similar num
bers of both sexes are eligible for
scholarships and the funding for
men's and women's teams are
equal, but football remains exclu
sively male, the sexes remain segre
gated and female sports in general
fail to attract quite the same sup
port as male ones.
This is, of course, clearly due to
more than just legal inequality.
There are undeniable physiologi
cal differences between the sexes
men are on average bigger and
stronger and thus better suited to
power sports like football but
this doesn't explain everything.
The variation in the physical abili
ties of the human race is great
enough that there are likely to be
many women who could do a bet
ter job in a male team than some of
the present incumbents. But I don't
want to get into that here; there
may, or may not, be valid reasons

for keeping athletes and sports di
vided along gender lines, and I
want to avoid dipping my toe into
that controversy. What shouldn't
matter, though, is the sex of the
people on the sidelines.
Even the most hardened bigot
should feel insulted by the asser
tion that a woman wouldn't be able
to understand the rules of sports.
For a start, this is not exactly brain
surgery or rocket science, but that
argument misses the point. As gen
der equality pushes back barriers,
hard, incontrovertible statistics
show that girls in many countries
are consistently outperforming
boys at school: If we question any
one's intelligence, it shouldn't be
the women's.

And though men undoubtedly
still dominate the ranks of sports
enthusiasts, there are a huge num
ber of passionate and well-in
formed female fans. Many will
have actually played the sports that
they follow and have just as com
plete an understanding of the rules.
There is absolutely no reason that
many of these women cannot step
up and get involved as referees or
even coaches. In fact, the process of
turning any fan into a professional
will fill in the knowledge gaps that
might still remain.
This is not a question of affir
mative action, but simple numbers.
Officials and coaches should be
employed and evaluated on the
basis of their abilities, and to get the
very best people in these roles, we
should be actively recruiting from
all areas, not ignoring 50 percent of
the human race. Unfortunately,
though, a quick bit of research out
lines that equality here is far from
being a reality. There are just a
handful of women officiating or
coaching men's sports, especially
when compared to the number of
men taking up these roles in
women's sports.
I don't have a good answer for
how we redress this balance, but
we can certainly start by taking a
stand and rejecting the purveyors
of outdated and downright nasty
views. These two ex-pundits can
certainly boast to have revolution
ized the way soccer is covered dur
ing their tenure, but U.K. sports
won't miss them. In fact, the united
front shown against their sexism
makes it better for their leaving;
the most important impact of their
careers might just be the way they
ended.

every girl that reads this column.

This is, of course, clearly due to
more than just legal inequality.
There are undeniable physiologi
cal differences between the sexes
men are on average bigger and
stronger and thus better suited to
power sports like football but
this doesn't explain everything.
The variation in the physical abili
ties of the human race is great
enough that there are likely to be
many women who could do a bet
ter job in a male team than some of
the present incumbents. But I don't
want to get into that here; there
may, or may not, be valid reasons

for keeping athletes and sports di
vided along gender lines, and I
want to avoid dipping my toe into
that controversy. What shouldn't
matter, though, is the sex of the
people on the sidelines.
Even the most hardened bigot
should feel insulted by the asser
tion that a woman wouldn't be able
to understand the rules of sports.
For a start, this is not exactly brain
surgery or rocket science, but that
argument misses the point. As gen
der equality pushes back barriers,
hard, incontrovertible statistics
show that girls in many countries
are consistently outperforming
boys at school: If we question any
one's intelligence, it shouldn't be
the women's.

And though men undoubtedly
still dominate the ranks of sports
enthusiasts, there are a huge num
ber of passionate and well-in
formed female fans. Many will
have actually played the sports that
they follow and have just as com
plete an understanding of the rules.
There is absolutely no reason that
many of these women cannot step
up and get involved as referees or
even coaches. In fact, the process of
turning any fan into a professional
will fill in the knowledge gaps that
might still remain.
This is not a question of affir
mative action, but simple numbers.
Officials and coaches should be
employed and evaluated on the
basis of their abilities, and to get the
very best people in these roles, we
should be actively recruiting from
all areas, not ignoring 50 percent of
the human race. Unfortunately,
though, a quick bit of research out
lines that equality here is far from
being a reality. There are just a
handful of women officiating or
coaching men's sports, especially
when compared to the number of
men taking up these roles in
women's sports.
I don't have a good answer for
how we redress this balance, but
we can certainly start by taking a
stand and rejecting the purveyors
of outdated and downright nasty
views. These two ex-pundits can
certainly boast to have revolution
ized the way soccer is covered dur
ing their tenure, but U.K. sports
won't miss them. In fact, the united
front shown against their sexism
makes it better for their leaving;
the most important impact of their
careers might just be the way they
ended.
