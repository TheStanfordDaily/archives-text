# OWNING OREGON
## MID-WAY THROUGH PAC-10 SEASON, CARD FLYING HIGH 
### JACK BLANCHAT NATE ADAMS 
The No. 4 Stanford women's
basketball team had a good day
duck hunting on Thursday night,
polishing off Oregon, 91-56, and ex
tending its winning streak to 11
games.
The Cardinal (17-2, 8-0 Pac-10)
dominated all facets of the game,
and the Ducks (12-7, 3-5) had a
tremendous amount of trouble
stopping the Ogwumike sisters.
Freshman forward Chiney Ogwu
mike tied a career high with 18
points and 12 rebounds, while jun
ior forward Nnemkadi Ogwumike
had 16 points and eight rebounds.

That said, the Ducks weren't
able to stop any of Stanford's stars.
Senior guard Jeanette Pohlen had
17 points and six assists, senior for
ward Kayla Pedersen added her
fourth double-double of the season
with 11 points and 14 rebounds, and
junior forward Sarah Boothe con
tributed 16 more off the bench.
The Cardinal's success was
largely driven by the Ducks' inabil
ity to make shots, as Oregon missed
a whopping 57 attempts. The Cardi
nal, in turn, pulled down a season
high 62 rebounds.
Stanford held Oregon to 56

points (its season low) thanks to
tough defense, forcing the ice-cold
Ducks to take a huge number of
long-distance shots. When the final
stats were tallied, Oregon shot just
25 percent, including a miserable 3-
for-32 from three-point range.
Guard Nia Jackson paced the
Ducks with 21 points and forward
Amanda Johnson had 15, but the
scoring dropped off significantly
after that, with only one other play
er scoring more than four points.
Stanford started the scoring and

never trailed, rushing out to a 19-1
lead halfway through the first half,
buoyed by five early points from
Pohlen. Jackson then did her best to
bring the Ducks back from the
brink by herself, fearlessly cutting
to the basket over and over again,
able to finish off her dribble and
add 13 points for Oregon over the
last 10 minutes of the first half.
Jackson helped the Ducks fight
back to just 10 down with only two
