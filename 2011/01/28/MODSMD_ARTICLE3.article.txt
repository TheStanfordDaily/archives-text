# OWNING OREGON
## MID-WAY THROUGH PAC-10 SEASON, CARD FLYING HIGH 
### JACK BLANCHAT NATE ADAMS 
The No. 4 Stanford women's
basketball team had a good day
duck hunting on Thursday night,
polishing off Oregon, 91-56, and ex
tending its winning streak to 11
games.
The Cardinal (17-2, 8-0 Pac-10)
dominated all facets of the game,
and the Ducks (12-7, 3-5) had a
tremendous amount of trouble
stopping the Ogwumike sisters.
Freshman forward Chiney Ogwu
mike tied a career high with 18
points and 12 rebounds, while jun
ior forward Nnemkadi Ogwumike
had 16 points and eight rebounds.

That said, the Ducks weren't
able to stop any of Stanford's stars.
Senior guard Jeanette Pohlen had
17 points and six assists, senior for
ward Kayla Pedersen added her
fourth double-double of the season
with 11 points and 14 rebounds, and
junior forward Sarah Boothe con
tributed 16 more off the bench.
The Cardinal's success was
largely driven by the Ducks' inabil
ity to make shots, as Oregon missed
a whopping 57 attempts. The Cardi
nal, in turn, pulled down a season
high 62 rebounds.
Stanford held Oregon to 56

points (its season low) thanks to
tough defense, forcing the ice-cold
Ducks to take a huge number of
long-distance shots. When the final
stats were tallied, Oregon shot just
25 percent, including a miserable 3-
for-32 from three-point range.
Guard Nia Jackson paced the
Ducks with 21 points and forward
Amanda Johnson had 15, but the
scoring dropped off significantly
after that, with only one other play
er scoring more than four points.
Stanford started the scoring and

never trailed, rushing out to a 19-1
lead halfway through the first half,
buoyed by five early points from
Pohlen. Jackson then did her best to
bring the Ducks back from the
brink by herself, fearlessly cutting
to the basket over and over again,
able to finish off her dribble and
add 13 points for Oregon over the
last 10 minutes of the first half.
Jackson helped the Ducks fight
back to just 10 down with only two

Oregon played far from flawless
basketball. The Ducks committed 18
turnovers and had just 10 assists on
the evening. The difference, however,
came at the free-throw line, where the
Ducks went 12-for-13.

The Ducks were fueled by redshirt
senior forward Joevan Catron. The
245-pound big man muscled his way
through the Cardinal frontcourt to
the tune of 15 points and six re
bounds. Altman took advantage of
Catron's strength down low and ran a
high-low game with senior guard Jay-
R Strowbridge. The 5-foot-10 speed
ster fearlessly slashed his way into the
paint and revived a Duck offense that
stalled near the end of the first half.

Despite a strong effort on defense,
Powell stressed the need for improve
ment on that end of the floor.

"We just gotta do it on defense
first," he said. "We score best when
we're getting stops."
Stanford began its night by scoring
just two points in the first five minutes
of action. Timely long-range shooting
by Green and Brown prevented the
game from getting out of hand. The
two teams entered the break dead
locked at 29-29, thanks in large part to
unforced turnovers by Oregon.
The Cardinal came out in the sec
ond half with better intensity and
rhythm, and led 38-32 at the 15:57
mark. That would be Stanford's
largest, and last, lead of the game.
The Ducks never looked back after

going on a 12-point run, stretching the
score to 44-38. Back-to-back buckets by
Powell and junior guard Jarrett Mann,
along with a free throw by Brown,
closed the margin to three points, but
Oregon sophomore guard EJ. Singler
made a clutch three-point play to effec
tively ice the game at 63-57.

Stanford will look to erase its
longest losing streak of the year when
it hosts Oregon State on Saturday at
Maples Pavilion. Tipoff is set for 7
p.m.

Oregon played far from flawless
basketball. The Ducks committed 18
turnovers and had just 10 assists on
the evening. The difference, however,
came at the free-throw line, where the
Ducks went 12-for-13.

The Ducks were fueled by redshirt
senior forward Joevan Catron. The
245-pound big man muscled his way
through the Cardinal frontcourt to
the tune of 15 points and six re
bounds. Altman took advantage of
Catron's strength down low and ran a
high-low game with senior guard Jay-
R Strowbridge. The 5-foot-10 speed
ster fearlessly slashed his way into the
paint and revived a Duck offense that
stalled near the end of the first half.

Despite a strong effort on defense,
Powell stressed the need for improve
ment on that end of the floor.

"We just gotta do it on defense
first," he said. "We score best when
we're getting stops."
Stanford began its night by scoring
just two points in the first five minutes
of action. Timely long-range shooting
by Green and Brown prevented the
game from getting out of hand. The
two teams entered the break dead
locked at 29-29, thanks in large part to
unforced turnovers by Oregon.
The Cardinal came out in the sec
ond half with better intensity and
rhythm, and led 38-32 at the 15:57
mark. That would be Stanford's
largest, and last, lead of the game.
The Ducks never looked back after

going on a 12-point run, stretching the
score to 44-38. Back-to-back buckets by
Powell and junior guard Jarrett Mann,
along with a free throw by Brown,
closed the margin to three points, but
Oregon sophomore guard EJ. Singler
made a clutch three-point play to effec
tively ice the game at 63-57.

Stanford will look to erase its
longest losing streak of the year when
it hosts Oregon State on Saturday at
Maples Pavilion. Tipoff is set for 7
p.m.

On a night when his team struggled to find the basket, Dwight Powell, above,
led the Cardinal with 14 points on 6-for-8 shooting. The freshman forward is
shooting 50.9 percent this season and averages 8.9 points per game.
The No. 4 Stanford women's
basketball team had a good day
duck hunting on Thursday night,
polishing off Oregon, 91-56, and ex
tending its winning streak to 11
games.
The Cardinal (17-2, 8-0 Pac-10)
dominated all facets of the game,
and the Ducks (12-7, 3-5) had a
tremendous amount of trouble
stopping the Ogwumike sisters.
Freshman forward Chiney Ogwu
mike tied a career high with 18
points and 12 rebounds, while jun
ior forward Nnemkadi Ogwumike
had 16 points and eight rebounds.

That said, the Ducks weren't
able to stop any of Stanford's stars.
Senior guard Jeanette Pohlen had
17 points and six assists, senior for
ward Kayla Pedersen added her
fourth double-double of the season
with 11 points and 14 rebounds, and
junior forward Sarah Boothe con
tributed 16 more off the bench.
The Cardinal's success was
largely driven by the Ducks' inabil
ity to make shots, as Oregon missed
a whopping 57 attempts. The Cardi
nal, in turn, pulled down a season
high 62 rebounds.
