The airlock bursts open. As
all matter, sound and
humanity is dragged from
the observation platform and into
the gaping blackness, you feel your
artificial oxygen supply kick in and
your armored boots begin to lift
from the floor. There's a certain

poetry to your struggle as you
tumble toward the vacuum, claw
ing out for anything to hold onto,
the silent and übiquitous expulsion
seems somehow right. Gazing the
other way now, at the golden sur
face of Saturn and the speckling of
stars behind it, everything slows
down as you imagine just letting
go just letting your torment,

your visions and your burden all
end.

A corpse floats past
you, this one still human,
Overtaken again with a

sense of duty, you
raise your
plasma cutter
and take aim
on the con
trols of an emer-

gency air seal. The shot
connects, and you crash to

the floor. Air comes sweep
ing back into the room, and you
can hear your own heartbeat, muf
fled and whimpering beneath a
steel shell. Still alive.
Such is the world of "Dead
Space 2," the monstrous follow-up
to Visceral Games' sci-fi thriller
that came out of nowhere back in
2008 and has haunted players'

dreams ever since. The sequel
doesn't do anything revolutionary,
but it doesn't need to: By changing
up the setting, fleshing out the cast
and packing in plenty of jaw-drop
ping moments, "Dead Space 2"
raises the bar for horror games and
sets 2011 off with a bang.
It's been a few years since our

first adventure with space engineer
Isaac Clarke, and the iconic man in
armor isn't doing much better
since his traumatizing experience
aboard the USG Ishimura (an
adventure that isn't required to
enjoy "Dead Space 2" but that I'd
recommend anyway). He's racked
with guilt over encouraging his
girlfriend Nicole to work on a
deep-space mining vessel that

recovered a mysterious,
monolithic object. This
"Marker" controls people's

thoughts and
unleashes a
scourge of
infectious

"necromorphs"
that re-animate

corpses. It's also giving Isaac
vivid hallucinations and a

wicked headache, and he's out
for answers. Oh, and to shoot
monsters.
At first, the story of "Dead
Space 2" didn't keep me on tenter
hooks you're out to destroy the
Marker, bad people want to stop
you and there are nasty aliens. It
was enough to keep me going, but
I was invested in the action more

than the plot. Eventually, though,
the game focuses more on Isaac's
internal struggles and visions,
which become downright com
pelling.
Like any horror game, "Dead
Space 2" has its share of cheap
thrills. Enemies burst out of vents
and pipes, floors give way and bad
guys sneak up and get you from
behind. But while it does jump
scares as well as anyone, the game's
real draw is the ambience. As you
explore Saturn's derelict space sta
tion, "The Sprawl," you'll be
awestruck by how flickering service
lights and long shadows can keep
you on edge, wondering just what
happened before you passed
through. Objects dance and twirl
in a zero-G ballet, and you might
see a hand or leg float by with
blood freely oozing out.
And like the original, the

sound design is really king here:
Deep, hollow clangs resonate as
shadowy figures slither into service
pipes; frantic screams and power
ful gun blasts are muffled and cut
short in the vacuum of space; an
unseen presence whispers "Isaac ..
. " behind dissonant harmonies.
The sense of isolation and hope
lessness is palpable if not oppres
sive, and the game is great for it.
In a break from the deliberate,
explorative pace of the original
game, "Dead Space 2" has one boot
planted in the slow-burn realm of
intellectual horror and another in
the in-your-face world of action
movies. Like our dear friend Isaac,
that might sound a little schizo
phrenic at first. But for the most
part, this works to the game's
advantage: It's hard to lose interest
when you're not sure if a quiet,
solemn trek through a corridor

could take a sudden turn as an
enormous, tentacled mutant
pierces through the floor, grabs
you around the leg and drags you
out into the vacuum of space. You
might feel bogged down once in a
while by repetitive (though merci
fully short) puzzles and the occa
sional trek through a not-so-scary
air vent, but on the whole, the
game does a great job of taking the
action up a notch without losing
its identity as an atmospheric hor
ror show.
Like the pace of his adventure,
Isaac's abilities have been ramped
up a bit. He moves a bit faster and
hits a bit harder, and I felt a little
more empowered when I was run
ning low on ammo. His stasis and
kinesis abilities are more useful as
well, letting you freeze enemies in
