Courtenay Grimwood intro
duces a new series with "The
Fallen Blade," the first installment
of an urban fantasy set in 15th-cen
tury Venice. It has werewolves, and
it has vampires, but if it sounds like
"Twilight" in a time machine, think
again. "The Fallen Blade" is burst
ing with political intrigue, epic

naval battles, arranged marriages
and assassins and it doesn't pull
its punches. That last, if nothing
else, is the mark of an author with
worlds of experience at his disposal.
The cast consists of the charac
ters one might expect Lady
Giuletta di Millioni, the runaway
princess, and Atilo II Mauros, the
head of the Assassini, come to mind
but also characters who are
intrinsically intriguing, such as the
Mongolian-born mother of the
half-wit Duke of Venice, the
Duchess Alexa and the not-quite
human, semi-feral Tycho, who is
discovered by a customs officer in a
secret compartment of a Mamluk
ship. The development of the char
acters is uneven (Giuletta, for one,
seems incurably bratty, to the exclu
sion of other character traits), but
even the less appealing characters
demand the reader's attention, as

their stories are intricately woven
together in a high-stakes Byzantine
plot where one misstep might result

in murder or war.
The story opens with a con
spiracy: Duke Alonzo, Venice's
regent, hatches a plan to marry
Giuletta to the king of Cyprus
with a di Millioni child already in
her womb. She is to discreetly dis
pose of her husband and rule
Cyprus in the name of her infant
son, taking direction from Venice. If
all goes according to plan, Venice
will gain control of valuable trade
routes in the Mediterranean and
beyond but Giuletta refuses to
cooperate. She runs away from
home and into the arms of Prince
Leopold, the German ambassador,
who has suspicious connections to
the krieghund (werewolves) that
have been terrorizing the city.
Their story dovetails seamlessly
with that of Tycho and Atilo; Atilo's
famed and feared Assassini, in the
beginning of the novel, is left in tat
ters after an encounter with the

krieghund, during which he sacri
fices the lives of the majority of his
men to save the errant princess.

Atilo needs an heir to his leadership
of the Assassini, as all of the suit
able candidates perished that fateful
night, and Tycho, with his preter
natural strength and speed, seems
the perfect choice Tycho, who
has already encountered both
Giuletta (in a church) and Atilo's
betrothed, the heiress Desdaio (in a

prison cell), and has left an indeli
ble impression on both.
The sheer number of stories
happening at once, and the way
Grimwood effortlessly juggles
them, is eminently impressive.
Never once does the reader doubt
that he will resolve the disparate
threads by the end of the book,
though he could have stood to
tighten the narrative by cutting
some of the less-important view
point characters. Grimwood also
uses his setting to great effect; it
sometimes seems as though Venice
itself is a character of its own. The
city's presence in every element of
the story can, at times, seem over
powering, especially in the
instances where setting and circum
stance supersede characterization.
Fortunately, as with many
Byzantine novels, "The Fallen
Blade" is a plot-driven book.
Grimwood's latest work is a
refreshing take on vampires and
werewolves, where the supernatural
takes a backseat to the story itself.
"The Fallen Blade" is proof that
such well-worn tropes are still
viable it merely requires a whole
lot of talent.
