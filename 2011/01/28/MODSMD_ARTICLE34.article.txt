"No Strings Attached," Natalie Portman's
follow-up to critical success "Black Swan," is
Hollywood's most recent effort to make the
romantic comedy original and interesting
again. Although the film, the latest from
director Ivan Reitman, stumbles with some
cliches and a few cases of terrible dialogue, its
clever one-liners and unique, hilarious sup
porting cast make it a strong effort and cer
tainly a welcome break from the January
movie doldrums.
The film revolves around Emma
Kurtzman (Natalie Portman), a relationship
phobic doctor, and Adam Franklin (Ashton
Kutcher), a carefree production assistant who
dreams of becoming a screenwriter. After
brief flashbacks to their run-ins at summer
camp and college ffat parties, the movie
jumps to their mid-20s, when they meet
again and attempt to form a casual, commit
ment-free relationship. Despite the movie's
title, it is clear from the beginning of the film
that there is more to the pair's relationship
than sex, and that the "no strings attached"
relationship could never actually last with
them. Instead, the movie charts how their
connection eventually turns into a real rela
tionship, albeit with several bumps along the
way.

As far as romantic comedies go, "No
Strings Attached" is a breath of fresh air after
a year of cliched duds like "Killers" and
"Valentine's Day." True, the movie does con
tain the classic, tired "run to tell that special
someone you love them before it's too late!"
scene, and, despite its title, is a movie about
an actual romantic relationship, not a strictly
sexual one. Its set-up certainly does not break

any boundaries. Still, the movie breaks free of
typical romantic comedy barriers with a
script that's actually funny, open discussion of
topics that used to be taboo territory in
movies (Adam making Emma a "period
playlist" that contains songs like "Bleeding
Love" by Leona Lewis and "Sunday Bloody
Sunday" by U2 comes to mind) and strong
acting, mainly by the supporting cast.

Although star Natalie Portman's role as a
romantic lead is startlingly different from her
recent dramatic turn in thriller "Black Swan,"
she proves she can hold her own in a roman
tic comedy as well. She lends wit and human
ity to a character that in other similar films
would be played straight as a career-focused,
ice-cold stereotype. Ashton Kutcher follows
her lead well as a hapless, down-on-his-luck
romantic. Although the role is certainly not a
stretch for Kutcher, his acting is still funny,
charming and a perfect fit for the film.
The supporting cast steals the show with
the movie's funniest lines and most awkward
moments. Kevin Kline shines as Adam's

father Alvin Franklin, a wealthy, spoiled actor
who struggles to fit in with the younger gen
eration. Lake Bell is hilarious as Lucy, a glori
ously awkward co-worker of Adam's who
finds increasingly strange ways to communi-


COURTESY PARAMOUNT

cate her love for him. Mindy
Kaling (best known as Kelly from
TV's "The Office") is hilarious as
Shira, one of Emma's fellow doc
tor friends and roommates.
The movie's script is, for the
most part, fantastic, featuring bit
ing one-liners and some priceless
moments. Adam's work at a TV
studio (which is filming, inciden
tally, a "High School Musical"-
type series, providing hilarity in
itself) and his interactions with
his fellow coworkers provide
some of the funniest scenes in the
film, only bested by Adam's father
Alvin, who begins dating Adam's
ex-girlfriend, Vanessa (Ophelia
Lovibond). The ensuing interac
tions between the old actor and
his young girlfriend are comedic
gold, culminating with Alvin
going to the hospital after getting

high on cough syrup.
However, the movie suffers
from a few terrible, sappy lines,
mostly on the part of Adam.
Fortunately, the funnier lines in
the rest of the movie are more

than enough to make up for the
few bad ones.

"No Strings Attached,"
though not perfect, is a refreshing
break from typical romantic
comedies and the bleak January
movie season. Although it is cer
tainly not the groundbreaking

examination of modern relation
ships it might have hoped to be,
its hilarious script and supporting
cast make it well worth a watch.
