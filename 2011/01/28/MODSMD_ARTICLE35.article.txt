The Coen brothers' most
recent film, a Western set in
the late 1800s and adapted
from Charles Portis' novel "True
Grit," ventures into the territory of
the light-hearted, whimsical
adventure story, complete with a
14-year-old female protagonist and
a humorous, crotchety drunkard.
The resolute young girl,

Mattie Ross, played
by Hailee Steinfeld,
provides the driv
ing force for the

story. Her single
goal in the film is
to avenge the death
of her father, and
she's the catalyst for
the pursuit of his
murderer, Tom
Chaney. From her

very first appearance, we can tell
she'd be a perfect lawyer she's a
fast talker, with every single word
serving a purpose. She's also an
officious rascal, a quality that at
one point earns her a spanking.
Nonetheless, she commands
respect from the men in the film,
who range from quasi-noble offi

cials to amoral tooth-deficient
criminals.
She drags into her band of
justice seekers U.S. Marshal
"Rooster" Cogburn, played by Jeff
Bridges, and Texas Ranger
Laßoeuf, played by Matt Damon.
Cogburn certainly has a presence,
and although muffled and at times
incomprehensible, he injects
humor into each scene through
bitter remarks and an honest
recognition that he really is too old
for this kind of stuff. Laßoeuf,
whose enormous mustache match
es his inflated ego, is a sensitive
creature, and he argues with (or
whines at) Cogburn to assert his
status. Still, the three traverse
together through the Indian
Territory to find Chaney, and
develop an odd and almost heart
warming bond.
The journey itself does not
really prove all too suspenseful or

unique. The gang stumbles into
some roadblocks, such as crazy
cabin men, gunshot wounds and at
one point, what appears to be a
bear riding a horse, but other than
that, their journey is just a stream
of wintry images and expansive
landscapes. The primary focus of
this film seems to be Cogburn's
witty repartees and Ross's moral
temerity, and maybe Laßoeuf's
ridiculous facial hair. The film
does not actually give a sense for
Western life, but merely has images
or phrases of that time plastered
onto a work of wry and playful
narration, easily recognizable as
the familiar and adored Coen
brothers' aesthetic.
