There will be no more quirky indie
rock operas from The Decemberists
at least that's the message implied
on "The King Is Dead," the sixth and latest
studio release from the band. If you were

looking for another dramatic, genre-bending
concept album like "The Hazards of Love,"
look elsewhere. The theatrical quasi mash
ups have fallen away to reveal a much more

sparse, country-leaning instrumentation
courtesy of the enlisted help of R.E.M. greats

Peter Buck (guitarist) and Tucker Martine
(producer).
"The King Is Dead" is the Portland
based band redefining its whole musical
identity: gone are the quirky storylines and
obscure lyrics, replaced by twangy slide gui
tar and wailing harmonicas. A combination
of rootsy Americana and unsophisticated

folk, the music still bears enough of a pecu
liar hint through Colin Meloy's unmistak
able tone to deserve its own sub-genre of
indie music: "quaint pop." Mostly acoustic,
the album proves there is no need for fancy
concept albums if your name is The
Decemberists.

The R.E.M. influence Meloy has refer
enced as inspiration for the album makes

itself patent in the first couple of songs on
the album, which feature R.E.M guitarist
Buck. "Don't Carry It All" is as upbeat as the
album gets, guitar-based and lumbering,
with soulful harmonica verses competing

with Meloy's strong vocals for the spotlight.
Second in line, "Calamity Song" proves the
most difficult track to listen to, not because
of a lack in musicianship or songwriting, but
because of the striking similarity the open
ing guitar riff has with that of an R.E.M.

classic, "Talk About the Passion."

Indistinguishable in rhythm and pluck
ing style, the guitar riffs and subsequent

verses in both songs sound so eerily similar
that it's impossible to listen to "Calamity"
without running "Passion" through your
head on top of it. Although it's an enjoyable
track, swift and reminiscent of early R.E.M.

releases, it does not sound particular to The
Decemberists. In a closing line, Meloy even
slurs his vocals in typical Michael Stipe fash
ion. The track is one example of several on
the album which show that, in trying to
reinvent themselves by emulating the greats,
the band has nearly lost its own identity.
Two of the gems on the album are "Rise
To Me," an acoustic, emotional Americana

rendition, and "Rox In the Box." The former
is a beautiful ballad which would sound just

in tune with any other song on a country
radio station the slide guitar and har-

Monicas make more than a transitory
appearance. The second, a whirlwind tour
de-force with the fiddle as the central figure,
features a quick dance step with the fiddle
leading the rhythm. It ages the sound of the
track, making it sound quaint a quality
suggestive of the band's earlier releases.

While the album alternates between
slow acoustic folk or country numbers and
more upbeat Americana renditions, the
most interesting mix of genres shows up in
the last track on the album, "Dear Avery."
What starts as a down-tempo, alt-country
rendition morphs into the riskiest track on
the album through its slide guitar solo. In an
offbeat take typical of The Decemberists, the
guitar solo is played with unconventional
chords and is stretched to sound more like
swirling pedal effects, all the while layering
with soft choruses and gentle drums.
As the final finger picking dies away, I
can't help but wonder why, if The

Decemberists have worked so hard toward
building a reputation for themselves as con
cept musicians, they decided to release a no
concept folksy alt-country album in 2011.
Only time, and the next release, will tell if
the new inclination will hold.
