Amos Lee is one of those artists that
seems like he has been around for
ever; he is 33, after all, which is
equivalent to about 70 in the music indus
try. Oddly enough, in all this time, it seems
like his music has worsened. With his

fourth studio album, "Mission Bell," Lee
aims to create the perfect relaxation music,
only to wind up with a painfully dry and

completely lackluster record.
The sad part is, "Mission Bell" had the

potential to be so, so good. A singer-song
writer straight from Philadelphia, Amos
Lee made a name for himself after college
with his soothing sounds and daydream
lyrics. He is known for his fantastic vocals
that adjust perfectly to the mood of each
song, from mellow to pleading.
Furthermore, his actual musical composi
tion is much more complex than that of
many more popular singer-songwriters.
Lee is undoubtedly an artist who syn
thesizes his unique sound from a diverse
range of musical genres. Several inspira-

tions are evident; for instance, Lee has cited
John Prine as a musical model, evident in
"Cup of Sorrow," the moody, country 10th
track on the album, and Stevie Wonder's
influence shows up most in "Jesus," a soul
ful piece with vocal exercise typical of the
R&B icon.

So, then, this album should be excep
tional. But it isn't. "Mission Bell" is a take
a-glance-and-look-away album, an unin
spired, unmemorable musical work. It is
typical of every singer-songwriter in the
business.

Why? Part of the issue is that there
isn't a whole lot of variation in musical

style. Yes, Lee has a unique sound, but that

sound stays static throughout the entire
album. Every song is a guitar-driven ballad

with a desperate plea to a woman and a
generally depressing message. The tracks

particularly those near the end of the
album, such as "Cup of Sorrow" and
"Behind Me Now" bleed together until
they morph into a mass of chords. No one
song truly has a distinct edge.
The main problem, though, is the
lyrics. Lee is fond of using minimal phrases
to express a simple idea. This would be
fine, if at least one of the lines was unex-

pected or memorable. Instead, he uses uno
riginal metaphors; the fourth song,

"Flower," is one of the happier pieces of
"Mission Bell," but the lyrics ("My heart is a
flower/ That blooms every hour/1 believe in
the power of love") have been done before.
Similarly, "Stay With Me" is the same ballad
fawning over a girl that floods the genre.
The worst song on the album is its
penultimate one, "Clear Blue Eyes." A col
laboration with Lucinda Williams that

sounds like it should probably be a love
song, the track is yet another lamentation
of everything that goes wrong in the world,
Besides being yet another dreary song,
"Clear Blue Eyes" features too much exces
sive crooning and not nearly enough sub
stance to its name.

Lee obviously wrote this album to be
honest, not profound, and his message is
certainly appropriate for a 30-something
man experiencing heartbreak and the reali
ties of life. However, what "Mission Bell"
brings in honesty it lacks in appeal. There is
better mellow music out there, and it won't
make everyone fall asleep, either.
