## Anatolian Kitchen does modern Mediterranean

The geographical migration of falafel is
remarkable. The fried balls of
mashed chickpeas, believed to have
originated in Egypt, have become an integral
part of cuisine ranging from Moroccan to
Saudi Arabian. The best viands find away to
spread, and clearly Middle Eastern-
Mediterranean cuisine has taken root in
Palo Alto from casual spots like
Mediterranean Wraps on California Avenue
to nicer ones like Lavanda on University,
they seem to be littered everywhere. More
recently it has replaced the once-popular
Oaxacan Kitchen and sprung up in the form
of Anatolian Kitchen. However, while the
restaurant does in general produce good
food, it's not clear that Palo Alto needed

another Mediterranean spot.
Anatolian Kitchen provides an inviting
atmosphere that is not quite as formal as the
dim lighting might suggest. The restaurant is
probably best suited for a low-key but nicer
dinner with some friends or an informal
dinner date.

The Mediterranean cuisine compli

ments the inviting atmosphere with a
respectable offering of vegetarian options
that would allow most herbivores to be fairly
happy. The baba ganoush in particular is
excellent; the roasted flavor of the eggplant
comes through just the right amount in a
spread that is a wonderful balance of
creaminess and taste. The cacik is also fla
vorful and has a nice crunch provided by the
chopped cucumbers and a great kick provid
ed by the garlic.
The quality of the vegetarian options
dampens slightly at the "Falafel Plate" appe
tizer. The falafel themselves are cooked very
well, with an appetizing outside that serves
as the perfectly hardened shell to a moist
interior of chickpeas. The spicing of the

falafel, though, is a bit pale, and they are
only saved by the accompanying sauces and
hummus. Likewise, the stuffed eggplant flags
a bit in overall quality. The eggplant is ten
der but the dish ends up coming off a bit

mushy; a less than stellar mouth feel ham
pers what could otherwise be a respectable
dish in terms of flavor.

While not a total miss, the dolma is per
haps the nadir of the vegetarian dishes in
that it is completely forgettable. And though
the "Mediterranean Salad" could also use

stronger flavoring, it is at least a lighter
option than the dolma for those looking for
a brief escape from the heavier meat selec
tion.
Not all of Anatolian Kitchen's meat
dishes are heavy. The "Chicken Shish
Kebab," for example, actually provides a fla
vorful yet lean skewer of chicken alongside a
bed of underwhelming sauteed vegetables
and rice. It is, however, within the red meat
dishes that Anatolian Kitchen is able to

shine. With the mousaka, the onion-and-

tomato sauce provides a fantastic sweetness
that, when paired with the earthy flavors of
the zucchini and potato, brings out the
savory notes in the ground lamb, beef and

eggplant beautifully. The mousaka is cer-

tainly a highlight of the menu, as is
"Alexander's Favorite (Iskender)." This dish
is particularly rich but shows that Anatolian
Kitchen can really deliver delicious lamb.
The bread cubes act to soak up the flavor of
the surrounding sauces and, despite bad
experiences with soggy croutons elsewhere,
really enhance the texture of the dish.
Anatolian Kitchen's niche between for
mal and casual Mediterranean is not exactly
a sweet spot. The food is generally good, but
the restaurant is too informal to exhibit real
culinary expertise, yet too formal to become
one of the usuals. As Mediterranean and
Middle Eastern cuisines continue their trav
els, Anatolian Kitchen is stuck somewhere in
the "middle of the road."

Try the lamb shish kebab (tender cubes of marinated lamb, served
with rice and the house salad), above, at the Anatolian Kitchen, a
modern Mediterranean eatery off California Avenue. Employee
Abe Saab, right, rolls out fresh pita bread. Although Anatolian
Kitchen makes the bread fresh twice a day, owner Dino Tekdemir
said, "Some cutomers confuse the dough's yellow-green colors
with mold. This discoloration, however, is the natural color of the
traditional Turkish recipe after baking."
