# Meh-Ta: When TV is a little too real

There are many great American
remakes of British TV:
"American Idol," "The Office,"
"What Not to Wear," "The Weakest
Link." There are also many great TV
shows about life in Hollywood:
"Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip,"
"Entourage," "Curb Your
Enthusiasm" (sort of). The 2011
winter television premieres, however,
have not been good to either genre,
between MTV's salacious and sloppy
"Skins" and Showtime's casual
attempt at comedy with "Episodes."
The two, in their striking divergences
and surprising similarities, present a
great question about American audi
ences and their sensibilities when it
comes to humor, sex, celebrity and
action in their television shows.
"Episodes" is not itself a remake
but is a show about the remake
process. In the pilot, we meet mar
ried television writers Beverly and
Sean Lincoln and watch them,
metaphorically in the opening cred
its and literally in the body of the
episode, relocate to L.A. when a

Hollywood network executive
options their award-winning British
comedy series, "Lyman's Boys," for
remake. This dry description of the

premise is indicative of the plot con
tent of the episode and the protago
nists themselves, both of which are
boring and plain. Much as I was
enticed by the idea of satirizing

Hollywood from the writer's point of
view, the show exhibits dry, anemic
satire instead of biting humor. David
Crane, the co-creator of "Friends," is
co-creator once again, but he loses
what was good about "Friends" and
seems to gain a complex about the
success that came from that good
ness.
In other words, the show osten
sibly wants to make fun of
Hollywood opulence, arbitrariness
and anti-intellectualism but, in doing
so, allows those destructive entities to
pervade the make-up of the show
itself. The result is a sluggishly paced
25 minutes that rely on the same
punch-line pattern and audience
expectation. With the latter, the dia
logue can be successful when self
aware: in the second episode, Matt
Leßlanc confronts the Lincolns

about the similarity of their show to
the play, "The History Boys," whose
lead actor, Richard Griffiths, is also
the lead actor of "Lyman's Boys."
When the show pursues the details of

meta-humor to that degree, it finds
success; otherwise, the jokes feel
recycled.
I admit that I myself am not
partial to British comedies such as
"Coupling," but I'm all the more sur
prised that the creator of the most
popular and most determinedly
American comedy series of all time
can't bridge the gap between
American and British humor. That
may be the show's biggest problem:
its decision to separate the British
and the American a la the
Revolutionary War (this time pitting
the Hollywood beautiful against the
overly cerebral British), when we
want to see a more nuanced story
about the interaction of the two cul
tures.
This, too, seems to be the prob
lem of MTV's highly anticipated

reboot of "Skins." A devotee of the
British version since last fall, I love
the original series because I can
appreciate the thematic issues it rais
es but still recognize that this would
never happen in my own life. The
nightclubs, the drugs, the religious
and ethnic clashes, the class strife: all
of these are germane to the human
condition, but not to the everyday
existence of the majority of

American teens watching MTV.
The adaptation of the immense
ly powerful and artistically stunning
British original functions on the
notion that American viewers
demand both what is familiar and
what is outrageous. In watering
down the overall tone of the show
but still milking, in terms of market
ing at least, the scandal of nudity and
withdrawn investors, the content of
the episodes is rendered frivolous.
For "Skins," the show's roots in a
profound commentary on British
culture that transcends the target age
group paint the newest iteration as
exploitative.
American television, when it
comes to shows that deviate from the
safe, universally palatable sitcoms,
falls into two categories: programs,
most often on cable, that use a frame

of a time period ("Boardwalk

Empire"), a profession ("Breaking
Bad") or a narrative device
("Damages") to distinguish them
selves from reality, and in so doing,
make their messages universal; and
programs, most often on network
TV, that use punctuated episodes of
scandal, drama or intrigue to attract
viewers but keep them at a distance
from the material itself.
The accidental nature of the

Lincolns' success on "Episodes" rep
resents the way good television is

made, in my opinion. Immersion in
the art yields a story with a brain and
heart that can sustain the life form of
a TV show for many seasons. When
the premise or plot of a show is con
stantly reacting to what audiences
want, it fails to anticipate what they
need.
