## Card looking to bounce back on trip to top-15 foes 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH STAFF WRITER 
After a series split at No. 11
Hawaii last weekend, the men's
volleyball team is back on the road
to continue Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation play against No.
13 Cal State Northridge (2-5, 1-3
MPSF) tonight. The No. 2 Cardinal
(5-1, 4-1) will go on to face No. 5

Long Beach State (4-3,3-1) tomor
row.
"Both teams are ranked in the
top 15, so it won't be easy," said
Stanford head coach John Kosty.
"Long Beach has a very experi
enced setter that runs a balanced
and fast offense, and although
CSUN lost a lot of players to grad
uation, they still have a strong at
tack on the outside and good size
in the middle,"

The Matadors are coming off a
loss in their home opener to UC-
Santa Barbara, but they have al
ready faced five teams ranked in

the national top five, including a
win on the road against then-No. 3
Pepperdine.
Northridge junior setter Matt
Stork passed the 3,400-assist mark
in his last match against UCLA,
but he had his consecutive start
streak end at 70 matches after suf
fering an injury against the Bruins.
Stork is questionable for the match
tonight, meaning backup setter
Jeff Baxter would run the offense
against the Cardinal.
However, the match likely rests

Though the season is young, Brad Lawson, left, has done plenty to distinguish himself. The junior outside
hitter leads the team with 81 kills, averaging 4.05 per set. That mark puts him at fourth in the MPSF.
on how well Stanford's defense and
blocking can handle Northridge's
young talent. Freshmen Greg
Faulkner, Brandon Lebrock and
Cory Wagner all feature heavily in
the Matadors' offense Lebrock
leads the team in kills and aces and
is second in digs.

Stanford leads the all-time series
33-25, but has dropped seven of the
last nine matches dating back to
2008. The Cardinal has not won in
the Matadome since 2004.

Kosty is more concerned with
how his team is doing now than with
how it will match up against its op
ponents.

"We really need to focus every
day on improving both individually
and as a team," he said. "This is a
very long season and we are only
four MPSF matches in."
Freshman outside hitters Brian
Cook and Eric Mochalski are third
and fourth on the team in kills with

46 and 27, respectively. Mochalski is
hitting .438 and had the match-win
ning kill against Hawaii last Sunday
Cook had his own match-winner
earlier in the season against BYU.
"All seven of our freshmen have
done an absolutely incredible job
for us thus far," Kosty said.
Junior outside hitter Brad Law
son leads the veterans with a team
high 81 kills, averaging 4.05 per set
good for fourth-highest in the
MPSF. First-year setter Evan Barry
is averaging over 10 assists per set,
tied for second-best in the MPSF.
But it was Spencer McLachlin
who carried the Cardinal in the sec
ond match against Hawaii. The sen
ior outside hitter and Hawaii native
had a career-high 29 kills in tight
win against the Warriors.
This came after Stanford laid a
collective egg in the first match
against Hawaii, when the Cardinal
was swept, 25-22, 25-21, 25-17, in
Honolulu.
"Hawaii came out on that first
night and dictated the action from
the first serve," Kosty said. "We did
not do a good job countering their
game plan."

Stanford struggled to connect
passes and hit a season-low .200 as a
team. Defensively, the team could
n't stop outside hitter Jonas Um
lauft, who hit .500 and had 22 kills.
The Cardinal will face a similar
challenge against Long Beach
State's Jim Baughman.The junior is
averaging 3.96 kills per set for the
49ers, often thanks to senior Mike
Klipsch's setting. Klipsch is averag
ing 10.5 assists per match and had
46 assists with 10 digs in the team's
win against UCLA —as a fresh
man, Klipsch led the nation in as
sists per match with 13.8.
If the Cardinal is to maintain its
No. 2 national ranking, it will need
to continue its recent success
against the 49ers. Stanford trails in
the all-time series 40-25, but has
won the past five meetings.
Die match against Northridge is
scheduled for 7 p.m. tonight in
Northridge, Calif., with the clash
against Long Beach State sched
uled for 1 p.m. on Saturday in Long
Beach, Calif.

Northridge junior setter Matt
Stork passed the 3,400-assist mark
in his last match against UCLA,
but he had his consecutive start
streak end at 70 matches after suf
fering an injury against the Bruins.
Stork is questionable for the match
tonight, meaning backup setter
Jeff Baxter would run the offense
against the Cardinal.
However, the match likely rests

Though the season is young, Brad Lawson, left, has done plenty to distinguish himself. The junior outside
hitter leads the team with 81 kills, averaging 4.05 per set. That mark puts him at fourth in the MPSF.
on how well Stanford's defense and
blocking can handle Northridge's
young talent. Freshmen Greg
Faulkner, Brandon Lebrock and
Cory Wagner all feature heavily in
the Matadors' offense Lebrock
leads the team in kills and aces and
is second in digs.

Stanford leads the all-time series
33-25, but has dropped seven of the
last nine matches dating back to
2008. The Cardinal has not won in
the Matadome since 2004.

Kosty is more concerned with
how his team is doing now than with
how it will match up against its op
ponents.

"We really need to focus every
day on improving both individually
and as a team," he said. "This is a
very long season and we are only
four MPSF matches in."
Freshman outside hitters Brian
Cook and Eric Mochalski are third
and fourth on the team in kills with

46 and 27, respectively. Mochalski is
hitting .438 and had the match-win
ning kill against Hawaii last Sunday
Cook had his own match-winner
earlier in the season against BYU.
"All seven of our freshmen have
done an absolutely incredible job
for us thus far," Kosty said.
Junior outside hitter Brad Law
son leads the veterans with a team
high 81 kills, averaging 4.05 per set
good for fourth-highest in the
MPSF. First-year setter Evan Barry
is averaging over 10 assists per set,
tied for second-best in the MPSF.
But it was Spencer McLachlin
who carried the Cardinal in the sec
ond match against Hawaii. The sen
ior outside hitter and Hawaii native
had a career-high 29 kills in tight
win against the Warriors.
This came after Stanford laid a
collective egg in the first match
against Hawaii, when the Cardinal
was swept, 25-22, 25-21, 25-17, in
Honolulu.
"Hawaii came out on that first
night and dictated the action from
the first serve," Kosty said. "We did
not do a good job countering their
game plan."

Stanford struggled to connect
passes and hit a season-low .200 as a
team. Defensively, the team could
n't stop outside hitter Jonas Um
lauft, who hit .500 and had 22 kills.
The Cardinal will face a similar
challenge against Long Beach
State's Jim Baughman.The junior is
averaging 3.96 kills per set for the
49ers, often thanks to senior Mike
Klipsch's setting. Klipsch is averag
ing 10.5 assists per match and had
46 assists with 10 digs in the team's
win against UCLA —as a fresh
man, Klipsch led the nation in as
sists per match with 13.8.
If the Cardinal is to maintain its
No. 2 national ranking, it will need
to continue its recent success
against the 49ers. Stanford trails in
the all-time series 40-25, but has
won the past five meetings.
Die match against Northridge is
scheduled for 7 p.m. tonight in
Northridge, Calif., with the clash
against Long Beach State sched
uled for 1 p.m. on Saturday in Long
Beach, Calif.
