## Card looking to bounce back on trip to top-15 foes 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH STAFF WRITER 
After a series split at No. 11
Hawaii last weekend, the men's
volleyball team is back on the road
to continue Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation play against No.
13 Cal State Northridge (2-5, 1-3
MPSF) tonight. The No. 2 Cardinal
(5-1, 4-1) will go on to face No. 5

Long Beach State (4-3,3-1) tomor
row.
"Both teams are ranked in the
top 15, so it won't be easy," said
Stanford head coach John Kosty.
"Long Beach has a very experi
enced setter that runs a balanced
and fast offense, and although
CSUN lost a lot of players to grad
uation, they still have a strong at
tack on the outside and good size
in the middle,"

The Matadors are coming off a
loss in their home opener to UC-
Santa Barbara, but they have al
ready faced five teams ranked in

the national top five, including a
win on the road against then-No. 3
Pepperdine.
Northridge junior setter Matt
Stork passed the 3,400-assist mark
in his last match against UCLA,
but he had his consecutive start
streak end at 70 matches after suf
fering an injury against the Bruins.
Stork is questionable for the match
tonight, meaning backup setter
Jeff Baxter would run the offense
against the Cardinal.
However, the match likely rests

Though the season is young, Brad Lawson, left, has done plenty to distinguish himself. The junior outside
hitter leads the team with 81 kills, averaging 4.05 per set. That mark puts him at fourth in the MPSF.
