## Roxy Sass' favorite holiday: Groundhog Day 
### â€“ roxy SASS 
Roxy's always been a fan of
the underdog. Not only do
they usually work harder to
prove themselves, but Roxy's a utili
tarian and feels that her attention is
worth more when given to those
who don't get much from others.
That means that in the midst of
the recently passed holiday season
and the three-day weekends of win
ter quarter, Roxy would like to focus
on a holiday that is off overlooked,
and undeservingly so: Groundhog
Day.
A time when a debatably cute
animal emerges from the ground
and exhibits remarkable prescience
about the weather: What could be
better? It's an air of mystery, of sus
pense, of the delicate balance
between winter and spring. Roxy
wants you to Punx her tawny Phil.
Puns aside, Groundhog Day's
prediction has practical applications
to everyday life at Stanford. While
the weather has been decidedly un-
January-like in past weeks (The hot
prowler's effects linger much longer
than they should, it seems.),
February is fickle and could take a
turn either for the better or the
worse but the little rodent
underground can point the way.
For indecisive students: If the
groundhog sees his shadow next
Wednesday, that means winter
weather for the rest of the quarter,
which means using cold weather as
an excuse to get closer. Yes, Roxy
knows there's heating in dorm
rooms, but let's all be sustainable
and use body heat instead and
then Roxy would like you to do a
little burrowing.
If, however, Phil sees cloudy

skies, then winter's at an end, and
spring quarter will last five glorious
months. If Wilbur Field last week
end was any indication, Roxy knows
how she'll be spending her time:
minimally clothed, and in the com
pany of minimally clothed pretty
people. Hopefully on grass.
The decisive nature of
Groundhog Day can also dictate the
future of relationships. Spring quar
ter is approaching, and, especially if
you're about to graduate, Roxy
knows this is not the time to tiptoe
around relationship decisions.
Rather, forge ahead, since time is
limited. Unsure if your winter fling
is still worth sticking around with
(or rolling around with)? Place a bet
on Phil's choice and proceed
accordingly. Keep what you have if
he sees his shadow; if not, seduce
the future.
