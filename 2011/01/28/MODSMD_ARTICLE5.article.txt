## Card falls to Ducks, losing streak at four 
### ZACH ZIMMERMAN DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford men's basketball
team failed to break out of an offen
sive slump on Thursday night, losing
just its second home game of the
year, 67-59, to Oregon. The loss was
the Cardinal's fourth in a row and
marked the seventh consecutive
game that the team failed to eclipse
the 60-point mark.

Stanford (10-9, 3-5 Pac-10) was
overcome by the feisty full-court
press of the Ducks' defensive unit,
turning the ball over 17 times on the
game. Coupled with 6-for-19 shoot
ing from three-point range and
61.9-percent free-throw shooting,
the Cardinal was unable to come
away with a much-needed victory.
"I don't think we played particu
larly well," Stanford head coach
Johnny Dawkins said. "We turned
the ball over too many times."
For Oregon, the victory marked
the first time in 25 years that the
Ducks (10-10, 3-5) won in the con
fines of Maples Pavilion. Oregon
head coach Dana Altman was re
lieved to put that streak into the his
tory books.
"We needed that," Altman said.
"That was a big one for us. It's some
thing that we finally got out of the
way."

Freshman forward Dwight Pow
ell led the way for Stanford with 14
points on 6-for-8 shooting from the
field. Fie and classmate Anthony
Brown, who netted 11 points on the
night, were the lone bright spots for
a seemingly dysfunctional offensive
squad.
"Dwight gave us some energy,"
Dawkins said. "I thought he re
bounded and scored the ball well.
He was aggressive, he was attack
ing."
Junior guard Jeremy Green, who
entered the game as the Card's
leading scorer at 14.7 points per
game, continued to struggle from
the floor, hitting just three of his 10
attempts en route to a disappoint
ing 13-point performance.
"I thought Jeremy's shots for the
most part were good," Dawkins
said. "When you're getting looks
like that, it's also a function of,
you're going to have periods and
times of games where it doesn't go
for you how you want it to."
Noticeably underutilized in the
game was redshirt junior Josh
Owens. The star forward had a
string of strong performances lead
ing up to Thursday's matchup, but
recorded just 23 minutes on the
night. He finished with four points
on just three shot attempts.
Dawkins credited the Duck de
fense with denying ball-entry to his
best low-post presence.
"We couldn't get it inside,"
Dawkins said. "We want him to get

minutes left in the first half, but a late
layup from Pohlen helped Stanford
hold onto a 41-25 lead at the break.

The Card once again had a strong
start to the second half its trade
mark this season opening up with a
16-2 run in the first five minutes after
the break to go up by 30 and snuff out
all hope for the Ducks.
With another big win, the Cardinal
is now undefeated since Dec. 22, and it
has done it in convincing fashion. The
average margin of victory in its 11-
game win streak is 35.9 points, with the

closest game being a 12-point win over
UConn.

Unfortunately for Stanford, even
in another big win, there were still a
few things left to be desired. The Car
dinal matched a season high with 18
turnovers and struggled behind the
three-point line, going 6-for-23.
The team has a good chance to ad
dress those few blemishes tomorrow
night, when it travels to Corvallis for a
game against Oregon State. The
Beavers (7-12,0-8 Pac-10) are stuck in
the basement of the Pac-10, having lost
eight straight games since the confer
ence season started.

Oregon State most recently fell to
California, losing 60-47 despite
outscoring the Golden Bears 31-30 in
the second half. In the first frame, the

Beavers shot just 18.5 percent.
In a season that the Beavers might
prefer to start over, a few players are
having respectable performances
overall. Sage Indendi leads the OSU
starters in accuracy, shooting 40 per
cent and scoring 10.4 points per game.
Alyssa Martin leads the team in total
points with 279, averaging 14.7 per
contest. El Sara Greer is deadly from
beyond the arc, shooting 59.5 percent
at long range.

The contest in Corvallis is set for 7
p.m. Saturday night. The Cardinal will
return home next weekend to host the
Arizona schools.
