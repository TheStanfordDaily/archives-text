## Card falls to Ducks, losing streak at four 
### ZACH ZIMMERMAN DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford men's basketball
team failed to break out of an offen
sive slump on Thursday night, losing
just its second home game of the
year, 67-59, to Oregon. The loss was
the Cardinal's fourth in a row and
marked the seventh consecutive
game that the team failed to eclipse
the 60-point mark.

Stanford (10-9, 3-5 Pac-10) was
overcome by the feisty full-court
press of the Ducks' defensive unit,
turning the ball over 17 times on the
game. Coupled with 6-for-19 shoot
ing from three-point range and
61.9-percent free-throw shooting,
the Cardinal was unable to come
away with a much-needed victory.
"I don't think we played particu
larly well," Stanford head coach
Johnny Dawkins said. "We turned
the ball over too many times."
For Oregon, the victory marked
the first time in 25 years that the
Ducks (10-10, 3-5) won in the con
fines of Maples Pavilion. Oregon
head coach Dana Altman was re
lieved to put that streak into the his
tory books.
"We needed that," Altman said.
"That was a big one for us. It's some
thing that we finally got out of the
way."

Freshman forward Dwight Pow
ell led the way for Stanford with 14
points on 6-for-8 shooting from the
field. Fie and classmate Anthony
Brown, who netted 11 points on the
night, were the lone bright spots for
a seemingly dysfunctional offensive
squad.
"Dwight gave us some energy,"
Dawkins said. "I thought he re
bounded and scored the ball well.
He was aggressive, he was attack
ing."
Junior guard Jeremy Green, who
entered the game as the Card's
leading scorer at 14.7 points per
game, continued to struggle from
the floor, hitting just three of his 10
attempts en route to a disappoint
ing 13-point performance.
"I thought Jeremy's shots for the
most part were good," Dawkins
said. "When you're getting looks
like that, it's also a function of,
you're going to have periods and
times of games where it doesn't go
for you how you want it to."
Noticeably underutilized in the
game was redshirt junior Josh
Owens. The star forward had a
string of strong performances lead
ing up to Thursday's matchup, but
recorded just 23 minutes on the
night. He finished with four points
on just three shot attempts.
Dawkins credited the Duck de
fense with denying ball-entry to his
best low-post presence.
"We couldn't get it inside,"
Dawkins said. "We want him to get
