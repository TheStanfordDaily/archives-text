## ACADEMICS Despite tenuous market, Stanford law grads find jobs 
### ROBERT TOEWS STAFF WRITER 
In spite of a still-slumping econo
my and amid indications that law is
becoming a riskier career choice fi
nancially, Stanford Law School stu
dents are continuing to have success
landing competitive jobs after gradu
ation, according to administrators.
As the number of law degrees
granted nationwide continues to rise
up 11 percent from a decade ago
tens of thousands of legal jobs
have vanished amid significant cut
backs at firms, according to a report
by The New York Times this month
that drew wide attention.

The result is an oversupply of
lawyers, thousands of whom are un
able to find jobs in the legal profes
sion. Many of these people, saddled

with hundreds of thousands of dollars
of debt from student loans, find them
selves forced to work for low pay in
jobs for which they are overqualified
babysitting and waitressing, for ex
ample.

It seems, though, that these trends
have been much less pronounced at
Stanford, whose status as a top-tier
law school has allowed its graduates
to continue finding success in the job
market. Stanford currently ranks
third in the nation in the U.S. News &
World Report law school rankings,
behind only Yale and Harvard.
"Every graduate of Stanford Law
School has a good chance of landing a
job at a firm or in a practice area that
he or she wants," said Larry Kramer,
Stanford Law School dean.

The statistics seem to support this
point. In the class of 2009, virtually

every graduating student was em
ployed within nine months of gradua
tion. A majority of them —152 out of
172 were working either at law
firms or in judicial clerkships, accord
ing to school spokeswoman Judith
Romero. Those positions are general
ly considered to be the most sought
after positions for new J.D. graduates.
The 2009 figures compare favorably
to years before the economy col
lapsed, suggesting that Stanford Law
School graduates' job prospects in
deed remain positive in spite of the
economic downturn.
Current law students echoed these
sentiments.

"I think it makes a difference what
law school you went to," said Marisa
Diaz J.D.'l3.

Diaz, who is interested in public
interest law, hopes to make use of the
law school's Loan Repayment Assis
tance Program (LRAP), a program
offering financial help to recently
graduated law students pursuing pub
lic-interest careers. Furthermore, she
hopes that in her chosen field, she will
be "able to compete better because of
the name" of Stanford Law.

In response to suggestions that the
legal profession may be becoming
less lucrative, students and adminis
trators pointed to the cyclical nature
of the economy.

"I feel that the claim that law
school is a financially risky choice is a
little short-sighted," said Nikola Mi
lanovic 'll, who is currently applying
to law schools and plans to pursue a
career in law. "The decline in legal
jobs is just reflective of current eco
nomic belt-tightening, and probably
not an indicator that the sector will be
less hospitable in the long run."

"Every graduate of Stanford Law School has a good chance of landing a job
at a firm or in a practice area that he or she wants," said Larry Kramer, Stanford
Law School dean.
Kramer recommended consider
ing the history of the legal profession
over the last few decades, rather

than just the last few years, to keep
things in perspective.
"The legal market grew by much
more during the last 25 years before
the slump than it declined during the
slump, particularly among the elite
and prestigious firms, while the top
tier schools stayed roughly the same
size," Kramer said. "Most of these

firms are now well on the path to re
covery growing more slowly than
before the slump, but still growing."
