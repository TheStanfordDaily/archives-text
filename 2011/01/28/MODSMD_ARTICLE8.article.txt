## FIRE paints free speech red on Farm Stanford ranks low in free-speech report 
### BRENDAN O'BYRNE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In its annual report on campus
free-speech policies, the Founda
tion of Individual Rights in Educa
tion (FIRE) ranked Stanford as a
"red-light" school on the grounds of
"serious and substantial restriction
on freedom of speech."
The report, which ranks 390 uni
versities according to their on-cam
pus freedoms, put 67 percent of all
universities into the red-light cate
gory, with 27 percent receiving a
yellow light and 3 percent receiving
a green light. Another 3 percent
went unranked.

For the third year in a row,
trends show that universities are be
coming more free and tolerant, ac
cording to the organization,
which says its mission is to
"defend and sustain

individual rights at
America's col
leges and univer
sities."
Stanford re
ceived a red-light
ranking because,
FIRE said, the
University re
quired visitors
enter a SUNet ID

and password to
view its speech pol
icy on the use of
White Plaza. The rank-

ing organization handed two other
universities red-light rankings for
the same reason. The New York
based nonprofit decries such ac
tions as deceptive, claiming they
deny "prospective students and par
ents the ability to weigh this crucial
information."

FIRE's report included a screen
shot from Stanford's old Student
Activities and Leadership (SAL)
website requiring login informa
tion. In June 2010, the organization
found the site password-protected,
said Samantha Harris, director of
speech-code research for FIRE.

But Vice Provost for Student Af
fairs Greg Boardman noted in an e
mail to The Daily that Stanford's
White Plaza usage policy is, in fact,
accessible to the public without any
password-requirements. Snehal
Naik, associate director of SAL,

added that though Stanford has
changed some of its websites' de
signs since last year, the policy has
always been public.
"It's never been password pro
tected through WebAuth before,"
Naik said. "The website may look
different, but it's always been open
to the public."
Boardman said he agrees with
FIRE that prospective students and
parents should be able to read Stan
ford's policies before deciding
whether or not to attend, and that
he would follow up this issue with
FIRE to resolve their conflicting ac
counts.
Harris said now that the site is
not password-protected, she plans
on reviewing the ranking.
Last year, Stanford would have

received a yellow-light ranking if
not for the password issue. Though
Harris said she can't formally up
grade Stanford's ranking until she
reviews all of the University's po
lices, she is "hopeful" that she will
be able to upgrade the Farm's rank
ing at some point.

FIRE gave the green light to
Stanford's policies regarding sexual
harassment and network and web
site terms of use. It gave the yellow
light to policies regarding the Acts
of Intolerance Protocol and the
Fundamental Standard.

The Acts of Intolerance ranking
was because of the University's pol
icy language regarding intolerant
behavior, which the group called


AN ASTASIA YEE/The Stanford Daily
vague. Though students may not be
expelled or officially punished for
intolerant speech that doesn't qual
ify as a hate crime, they may be dis
ciplined through educational

means if they fail to respect "order,
morality, personal honor and the

rights of others," in the words of the
University's Fundamental Stan
dard.

The password-protected speech
policy issue was the only red-light
ranking Stanford received in the re
port, making an upgrade of status
seem likely. According to Flarris,
the review should be done by mid
day on Friday.
