## Duke prof discusses role of sports at universities 
### MARGARET RAWSON DESK EDITOR 
Duke professor Charles Clotfel
ter spoke Thursday at the School of
Education about the role of big ath
letics at American universities.
During the talk, presented by the
Center for Education Policy Analy
sis (CEPA), Clotfelter raised fun
damental questions about higher
education and the role of athletics
at institutions like Stanford.

"What are the aims of the great
institutions we revere?" asked
Clotfelter, an economics, public
policy and law professor.
Despite routinely being ignored
by scholars as a subject of inquiry,
"sports is a big deal," Clotfelter
said. "The universities are being

bashful about their big-time
sports."
In his research, Clotfelter cited
that of 52 schools with top athletics
programs and mission statements,
only 10 percent mention athletics in
their statements.

The question, Clotfelter said, is
whether universities should add en
tertainment to their official goals of
research, teaching and service.
"These scholars are acting like
they're in a parallel universe," he
said of faculty who ignore the pro
found effects, negative and positive,
of their schools' athletic traditions.
Clotfelter listed four factors
often touted in favor of intercolle
giate athletics: life lessons for stu

In his Thursday afternoon presentation, Duke professor Charles Clotfelter
claimed that many faculty and administrators ignore the large impacts
that athletics inevitably have on their respective institutions.
dent athletes, attention to universi
ties resulting in admissions and do
nations, revenue and increased sense
of community.
Citing revenue as a reason for
universities to maintain big athletics
programs is a losing argument, he
said, as "most of those programs lose
money."
Many argue big-time college ath
letics are too commercial, causing
schools to abandon academic priori
ties, compromising academic stan
dards and exploiting players.
Though NCAA athletes are un
paid, a draft-worthy football player
may be worth as much as $500,000
per season, while a draft-worthy bas
ketball player may be worth more
than $1 million, Clotfelter said. Stan
ford's annual athletics budget in
2009 was $74.7 million, according to
Clotfelter.
"Who gets more Google hits
your football coach or your Univer
sity president?" he asked.
Salaries for football coaches at
American universities increased by
a factor 7.5 between 1986 and 2010,
while professor compensation in
creased by 32 percent, said Clotfel
ter.
"Why in the world are universi
ties spending all this money?" he
asked. "Why would they be doing
something stupid?"
Contributions provide the top
source of funding for "major pow
ers" with successful teams, but lesser
ranked schools must rely on subsi
dies to support their programs.
Despite high costs,"it's the excep
tional university that gets out of the
business," Clotfelter said.
He pointed to influential booster
coalitions, such as the Buck/Cardinal
Club at Stanford, and University
trustees who "want to have a com
petitive team."
Clotfelter did highlight two "un
heralded benefits" of collegiate ath
letics. The consumer surplus associ
ated with college sports leads to hap
piness and pride within the commu
nity, he argued, calling it "an impor
tant spillover effect."
He also discussed the positive ex
ample teams provide of interracial
groups succeeding, though he ac

knowledged the example is an im
perfect one.
Clotfelter made his appeal to uni
versities: "Be candid about what it is
that you do and what it is that you
value."
Clotfelter urged Congress to "re
examine the tax deductibility of do
nations" to college athletics. Cur
rently 20 percent of donations are
deductible, but Clotfelter advocated
that the number be diminished to
zero.
Throughout the talk, Clotfelter
used Stanford's football program as
an example of big-time athletics at a
university with a primarily academic
mission.

The e-mail Provost John
Etchemendy Ph.D. 'B2 sent encour
aging faculty to be flexible with stu
dents who missed classes for the Or
ange Bowl in January, he said, was an
"indication of the true importance of
big-time sports."
On Clotfelter's point that univer
sities are forced to make academic
concessions to have successful ath
letics, Earl Koberlein, senior associ
ate athletic director who attended
the event, said, "I beg to differ on
that. We haven't lowered our aca
demic standards."
Koberlein reflected on Stanford's
victory at the Orange Bowl, saying
that he expects a "bump in donations
because of how the Orange Bowl
played out."
And about quarterback Andrew
Luck's decision to stay at Stanford to
complete his degree in architectural
design, Koberlein said, "You can't
buy that publicity."

"What are the aims of the great
institutions we revere?" asked
Clotfelter, an economics, public
policy and law professor.
Despite routinely being ignored
by scholars as a subject of inquiry,
"sports is a big deal," Clotfelter
said. "The universities are being

bashful about their big-time
sports."
In his research, Clotfelter cited
that of 52 schools with top athletics
programs and mission statements,
only 10 percent mention athletics in
their statements.

The question, Clotfelter said, is
whether universities should add en
tertainment to their official goals of
research, teaching and service.
"These scholars are acting like
they're in a parallel universe," he
said of faculty who ignore the pro
found effects, negative and positive,
of their schools' athletic traditions.
Clotfelter listed four factors
often touted in favor of intercolle
giate athletics: life lessons for stu

In his Thursday afternoon presentation, Duke professor Charles Clotfelter
claimed that many faculty and administrators ignore the large impacts
that athletics inevitably have on their respective institutions.
dent athletes, attention to universi
ties resulting in admissions and do
nations, revenue and increased sense
of community.
Citing revenue as a reason for
universities to maintain big athletics
programs is a losing argument, he
said, as "most of those programs lose
money."
Many argue big-time college ath
letics are too commercial, causing
schools to abandon academic priori
ties, compromising academic stan
dards and exploiting players.
Though NCAA athletes are un
paid, a draft-worthy football player
may be worth as much as $500,000
per season, while a draft-worthy bas
ketball player may be worth more
than $1 million, Clotfelter said. Stan
ford's annual athletics budget in
2009 was $74.7 million, according to
Clotfelter.
"Who gets more Google hits
your football coach or your Univer
sity president?" he asked.
Salaries for football coaches at
American universities increased by
a factor 7.5 between 1986 and 2010,
while professor compensation in
creased by 32 percent, said Clotfel
ter.
"Why in the world are universi
ties spending all this money?" he
asked. "Why would they be doing
something stupid?"
Contributions provide the top
source of funding for "major pow
ers" with successful teams, but lesser
ranked schools must rely on subsi
dies to support their programs.
Despite high costs,"it's the excep
tional university that gets out of the
business," Clotfelter said.
He pointed to influential booster
coalitions, such as the Buck/Cardinal
Club at Stanford, and University
trustees who "want to have a com
petitive team."
Clotfelter did highlight two "un
heralded benefits" of collegiate ath
letics. The consumer surplus associ
ated with college sports leads to hap
piness and pride within the commu
nity, he argued, calling it "an impor
tant spillover effect."
He also discussed the positive ex
ample teams provide of interracial
groups succeeding, though he ac

knowledged the example is an im
perfect one.
Clotfelter made his appeal to uni
versities: "Be candid about what it is
that you do and what it is that you
value."
Clotfelter urged Congress to "re
examine the tax deductibility of do
nations" to college athletics. Cur
rently 20 percent of donations are
deductible, but Clotfelter advocated
that the number be diminished to
zero.
Throughout the talk, Clotfelter
used Stanford's football program as
an example of big-time athletics at a
university with a primarily academic
mission.

The e-mail Provost John
Etchemendy Ph.D. 'B2 sent encour
aging faculty to be flexible with stu
dents who missed classes for the Or
ange Bowl in January, he said, was an
"indication of the true importance of
big-time sports."
On Clotfelter's point that univer
sities are forced to make academic
concessions to have successful ath
letics, Earl Koberlein, senior associ
ate athletic director who attended
the event, said, "I beg to differ on
that. We haven't lowered our aca
demic standards."
Koberlein reflected on Stanford's
victory at the Orange Bowl, saying
that he expects a "bump in donations
because of how the Orange Bowl
played out."
And about quarterback Andrew
Luck's decision to stay at Stanford to
complete his degree in architectural
design, Koberlein said, "You can't
buy that publicity."
