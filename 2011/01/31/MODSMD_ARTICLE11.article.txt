## EDITORIAL Editor's Welcome 
### Zach Zimmerman 
This might be a bit cliche. The
guy that has spent nearly his
entire Daily existence in the
sports department is going to begin the
new volume with a sports analogy.
Bear with me.

As a young football player pursu
ing a professional career, Darrell
Green was never taken seriously.
Sure, he was quick as lightning, but at
just 5-foot-9 and a touch over 180
pounds, he was a boy trying to make
it in a man's game. The idea of play
ing in the NFL appeared nothing
more than a fairy tale.
But he kept working, kept im
proving and took full advantage of
the natural talent he possessed. Har
nessing All-American speed and de
termination, Green was drafted in
the first round by the Washington
Redskins, a move initially questioned
but later praised.
During an exhibition game in
his rookie season. Green touched
the ball for the first time in his
young career on what seemed like
a routine play. He then proceeded
to return the punt 61 yards for a his
toric touchdown. It was a sign of
things to come.
Twenty-five years later, Green's
hall of fame speech resonated across
generations of football fans and mo
tivation seekers. In one of the most
memorable sports lines of all time, he
spoke of his father's influence in pur
suing what he loved in the face of
naysayers.
"They said no. He said go."
The Stanford Daily can leam a lot
from Darrell Green. We could "say
no," that in a revolutionized industry
struggling for survival, there's no
place for an independent student
newspaper. Our writers could "say
no" and abandon their dreams of
using their love for journalism to pro
vide the Stanford community with
the high-quality coverage it has come
to expect.
We're not the biggest, not the rich
est and certainly not the most devel
oped player in the newspaper game.
At times, we've been understaffed
and underfunded, struggling to pro
vide answers about the future.
Yet The Daily is still here after
119 years, and, this volume, it will be
better than ever. We may not score
a touchdown with our first issue, but
we will continue to strive for excel
lence and keep you in touch with
one of the most unique communi-

ties in the world. From the ROTC
debate to ASSU Elections to Stan
ford Softball, The Daily will have
you covered with fair, accurate and
unbiased reporting.
Our dedicated team of student
writers, editors, Web developers and
business staffers is teeming with
years of experience, awards, honors
and passion. They have made it their
mission to continuously improve and
adjust to the evolving standards of
journalism while remaining true to
the roots of this organization. Quite
simply, it's a phenomenal bunch.
However, what is a team without
the support of its fans?
I know you've heard it before, but
you are truly responsible for our suc
cess. Without hearing your voice, we
are left without knowledge of how to
make your reading experience the
best it can possibly be. I encourage you
to speak up, speak out and continue
the constructive dialogue that shapes
this campus.
