# THE 						TRANSITIVE PROPERTY
## Homecoming 
### Cristopher Bautista 
So, last week I went to my high
school to speak about my expe
rience as a trans person. I know
that nobody is really what they were
like in high school but for me, it
was kind of extreme. I don't think
many people switch genders after
they graduate. (During my high
school years, I went by my former
name and gender pronouns.) So
going back was, to say the least, per
haps one of the stranger things I've
experienced in my life.
I'll admit that I was pretty miser
able during high school. I had low
self-esteem, I was confused about
my body and I had friends who
taught me I didn't deserve to be
happy and that I'd never be good
enough for anyone. I was also
stressed out all the time try tak
ing every AP and honors class pos
sible, playing sports, plus working as
editor in chief of the school newspa
per (Stanford students, I'm sure that
you can relate wholeheartedly).
Part of me is surprised I managed to
get out of it alive.
Coming back was strange. Ms.
Dwyer, my former honors English
teacher (and I admit, the person
who started my love for English),
met me at the front desk, and we
headed toward the room where I
was going to speak. I passed by
classroom after classroom, recalling
I had English there, AP U.S. history
there. I remembered where my old
locker was. I could even recall
where I sat during class. The bell
rang the same incessant ring that
had separated my days into chunks
and made each day rhythmic and fa
miliar and the high schoolers
streamed out, clutching their books,
talking among themselves, opening
and slamming shut lockers, walking
like turtles with their overstuffed
backpacks. They were so young, and

yet, I remembered when I was that
young I remembered when I was
always nervous, always risking dam
age to my spine from carrying
around more books than recom
mended by an orthopedic doctor. It
was all so familiar.
But at the same time, it didn't
feel like my school at all. It was as if
some phantom had occupied this
space of me while I was in high
school, and I could no longer claim
this space as my own. The soul who
currently took up my body was
merely a shell of who I was back
then or maybe back then I was
merely a shell of who I am now. Ei
ther way, the person who had gone
to high school in my body and the
person now seemed like two com
pletely different people hell,
they literally were two different
people.
I wasn't quite sure what to expect.
No doubt, I did feel old. I thought
that I'd get maybe a max of 10 stu
dents. I then discovered, much to my
amusement and horror, that my visit
had been publicized school-wide.
My arrival was announced on their
school-wide television broadcasts
and everything. And when I arrived,
each chair was occupied we had a
full house. And I was terrified.
It was awkward at first. I said my
hellos, introduced myself. The mere
sentence "Hi, I'm Cris. I'm a senior at
Stanford studying English and femi
nist studies" made me sound a lot

more impressive than I actually was.
But from the beginning, they were
riveted. I told my life story, how I was
confused during high school, the two
times I came out. I even read two of
my columns. I just started talking,
and for the first time, I managed to
form a coherent narrative of my life.
I was surprised they were so inter
ested in me, of all people.
The residual bitterness I felt

about my high school years slowly
faded away as I spoke. As I heard
my voice speak, I came to terms
with myself, with my past experi
ences. Yeah, high school wasn't the
best for me I was moody and
miserable and confused most of the
time but all that moodiness and
misery and confusion allowed me
an opportunity to grow, to learn, to
mature. I managed to feel out who I
was and who I wasn't. I realized that
while I was rambling on that podi
um. Perhaps for the first time stand
ing there, on my high school cam
pus, I genuinely felt at ease. I gen
uinely felt happy. I wasn't vying

for anyone's attention or approval
anymore. The students there re
spected and acknowledged me as
me, as Cristopher. And to be ac
knowledged in a space where I did
n't feel acknowledged at all when I
was a student that meant a lot to
me.
So thank you, students of More
au Catholic High School. You may
have learned a lot from me, but I
learned a lot from you, too.

Cristopher has been going through a
lot of self-realizations these past cou
ple weeks, apparently. E-mail him at
cmsb @Stanford, edu.

mended by an orthopedic doctor. It
was all so familiar.
But at the same time, it didn't
feel like my school at all. It was as if
some phantom had occupied this
space of me while I was in high
school, and I could no longer claim
this space as my own. The soul who
currently took up my body was
merely a shell of who I was back
then or maybe back then I was
merely a shell of who I am now. Ei
ther way, the person who had gone
to high school in my body and the
person now seemed like two com
pletely different people hell,
they literally were two different
people.
I wasn't quite sure what to expect.
No doubt, I did feel old. I thought
that I'd get maybe a max of 10 stu
dents. I then discovered, much to my
amusement and horror, that my visit
had been publicized school-wide.
My arrival was announced on their
school-wide television broadcasts
and everything. And when I arrived,
each chair was occupied we had a
full house. And I was terrified.
It was awkward at first. I said my
hellos, introduced myself. The mere
sentence "Hi, I'm Cris. I'm a senior at
Stanford studying English and femi
nist studies" made me sound a lot

more impressive than I actually was.
But from the beginning, they were
riveted. I told my life story, how I was
confused during high school, the two
times I came out. I even read two of
my columns. I just started talking,
and for the first time, I managed to
form a coherent narrative of my life.
I was surprised they were so inter
ested in me, of all people.
The residual bitterness I felt

about my high school years slowly
faded away as I spoke. As I heard
my voice speak, I came to terms
with myself, with my past experi
ences. Yeah, high school wasn't the
best for me I was moody and
miserable and confused most of the
time but all that moodiness and
misery and confusion allowed me
an opportunity to grow, to learn, to
mature. I managed to feel out who I
was and who I wasn't. I realized that
while I was rambling on that podi
um. Perhaps for the first time stand
ing there, on my high school cam
pus, I genuinely felt at ease. I gen
uinely felt happy. I wasn't vying

for anyone's attention or approval
anymore. The students there re
spected and acknowledged me as
me, as Cristopher. And to be ac
knowledged in a space where I did
n't feel acknowledged at all when I
was a student that meant a lot to
me.
So thank you, students of More
au Catholic High School. You may
have learned a lot from me, but I
learned a lot from you, too.

Cristopher has been going through a
lot of self-realizations these past cou
ple weeks, apparently. E-mail him at
cmsb @Stanford, edu.
