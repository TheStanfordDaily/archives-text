# AIN'T NO SUCH THING AS A FREE LUNCH
## The
						Teaching Conundrum 
### Zack Hoberg Dave Grundfest 
It sounds great on the campus tour. The enthusiastic
tour guide tells you how amazing it is to have class
es taught by real professors, researchers exploring
the cutting edge of their field. Sounds like a great idea.
And it isn't until a couple years later that you realize
how risky this is.
There are just so many things that can, and will, go
wrong. Does your professor care at all about the class?
If you were doing groundbreaking research on the
topology of moduli spaces, how interested would you
be in teaching basic linear algebra? The same applies
for physics, economics, computer science or any intro
ductory engineering class.
Second, there's personality. Some people, brilliance
aside, have personalities that are simply incompatible
with lecture-format teaching. This commonly presents
itself as the absent-minded professor. They start off ex
plaining how to take the partial derivative of a function,
leading into a topography example, but get derailed
talking about the construction of terraces in mountain
ous agrarian societies, which quickly gives way to a dis
cussion about prehistoric art and the types of dyes used
and the potential modern application of ancient build
ing technologies in third world villages. This is all good
and well for the academic process go ahead, publish
a paper about the application of math on issues of rural
development, people will eat that up, after all, it's inter
disciplinary and fine for the students at the time, be

cause tangents are almost invariably more interesting
than the math. It stops being fine, however, weeks later
when you have to maximize a multivariable function on
the final and realize that the lecture when that was sup
posed to be covered was instead spent talking about Pe
ruvian dye.
Finally, perhaps the most pervasive: the language
problem. Everybody has experienced this at least once.
Your professor is almost certainly brilliant, and hell,
let's give him the benefit of the doubt, good at teaching
introductory classes. In another language. In English,
however, he speaks with such a heavy accent that your
only hope of deciphering the lecture is one of the head
phones they use at the U.N. General Assembly. Better
hope that the lecture notes are really good and posted
online. But on the bright side, this does help you justify
sleeping in, or through, class (as if you need any extra
