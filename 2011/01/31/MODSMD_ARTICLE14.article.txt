# AIN'T NO SUCH THING AS A FREE LUNCH
## The 						Teaching Conundrum 
### Zack Hoberg Dave Grundfest 
It sounds great on the campus tour. The enthusiastic
tour guide tells you how amazing it is to have class
es taught by real professors, researchers exploring
the cutting edge of their field. Sounds like a great idea.
And it isn't until a couple years later that you realize
how risky this is.
There are just so many things that can, and will, go
wrong. Does your professor care at all about the class?
If you were doing groundbreaking research on the
topology of moduli spaces, how interested would you
be in teaching basic linear algebra? The same applies
for physics, economics, computer science or any intro
ductory engineering class.
Second, there's personality. Some people, brilliance
aside, have personalities that are simply incompatible
with lecture-format teaching. This commonly presents
itself as the absent-minded professor. They start off ex
plaining how to take the partial derivative of a function,
leading into a topography example, but get derailed
talking about the construction of terraces in mountain
ous agrarian societies, which quickly gives way to a dis
cussion about prehistoric art and the types of dyes used
and the potential modern application of ancient build
ing technologies in third world villages. This is all good
and well for the academic process go ahead, publish
a paper about the application of math on issues of rural
development, people will eat that up, after all, it's inter
disciplinary and fine for the students at the time, be

cause tangents are almost invariably more interesting
than the math. It stops being fine, however, weeks later
when you have to maximize a multivariable function on
the final and realize that the lecture when that was sup
posed to be covered was instead spent talking about Pe
ruvian dye.
Finally, perhaps the most pervasive: the language
problem. Everybody has experienced this at least once.
Your professor is almost certainly brilliant, and hell,
let's give him the benefit of the doubt, good at teaching
introductory classes. In another language. In English,
however, he speaks with such a heavy accent that your
only hope of deciphering the lecture is one of the head
phones they use at the U.N. General Assembly. Better
hope that the lecture notes are really good and posted
online. But on the bright side, this does help you justify
sleeping in, or through, class (as if you need any extra


help with that one). This affliction is
certainly not restricted to profes
sors either the TA population
suffers from it just as acutely, and
better yet, they're your designated
saviors from incomprehensible
professors.
All of these are obviously prob
lems only in the extreme. Most pro
fessors are passionate about what
they teach, occasional musings and
eccentric tangents can keep you en
gaged and many accents just make
the speaker sound more interesting
or (in the case of the Queen's Eng
lish) more intelligent. The extremes
are, however, relatively common on
the Stanford campus. This is the
price we pay for having such a
renowned faculty sacrificing
some quality of the undergraduate
student experience. Although that
is an oversimplification, it is proba
bly less of one than most of the ad
ministration would like to admit.
So how do we transform Stan
ford into a great place for introduc
tory teaching? The Program in
Writing and Rhetoric department
has actually realized this problem
and addressed it quite effectively.
PWR teachers tend not to be nor

mal tenure track professors, but in
stead specialized teachers, and ex
ceptional ones. Most people like
and appreciate their PWR profes
sors, even if they do hate the class it
self. This strategy could easily be
applied to other introductory class
es. You simply don't need to be an
expert in fractal geometry to teach
Math 51 or a Nobel Prize winner to
teach the Physics 40 series. Instead,
for these introductory courses, let's
hire great teachers who are assessed
on their ability to educate students
rather than publish papers.
This would be difficult. For one,
it's expensive, and it would proba
bly take somebody cutting a big
check to make it happen. Second,
there's the Faculty Senate, which
would need a little convincing be
fore they agreed to hire a secondary
teaching staff that could step on
professors' toes. Neither is insur
mountable, but we're not exactly
holding our breath. In the mean
time, find the office hours schedule,
organize a study group and bring
the lecture notes to class if you can.
A Russian-English dictionary
might not be a bad idea either.

Dave and Zack are considering start
ing a PWR course on the rhetoric of
introductory teaching. Send them
