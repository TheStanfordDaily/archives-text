# OP-ED
## Looking beyond Gaieties 
### 
We really believe that the
students who wrote, pro
duced and acted in Gai
eties had no intentions of hurting
their peers' feelings. In the same
light, we think they would say that
we didn't come to Gaieties "look
ing for trouble." What started as
different groups coming to Memo
rial Auditorium for the same rea
son to share our love for Stan
ford and unify the student body be
fore Big Game ended with all
parties involved feeling hurt and
misunderstood. On the one hand,
many students of all backgrounds
felt alienated by the portrayals of
various sub-groups in our student
body. On the other hand, those who
enjoyed the show don't necessarily
feel like they have done anything
wrong by being able to take the
show lightly and enjoy Gaieties for
what it is. And honestly, this isn't a
rare phenomenon; every day, peo
ple come to very different conclu
sions about the same subject. That

is not the point. The point is that
these moments are not ones to sim
ply let pass by and repeat them
selves year after year. It is an op
portunity for each group to under
stand where others are coming
from and to learn and grow from
these different perspectives. We
hope tonight's Town Hall spon
sored by Ram's Head, 7-8:30 p.m.
in Roble Theater is a start.
What compels us to write this
article now just over two
months after 36 residents of Uja
maa decided to walk out of the
show in protest is not just be
cause we as a school haven't fully
fleshed out what the intentions of
Gaieties are and should be, but also
because we see this unfortunate in
stance of misunderstanding as a
part of a broader campus problem.
Gaieties is just one of many in
stances that have made students of
various communities feel disen
franchised at their own school.
Often unwittingly, the words and

actions of others can make stu
dents of particular groups feel
pushed to the fringes of campus
and unable to comfortably express
that aspect of their identity. That is
certainly articulated in Ujamaa,
but it is far from the only place
where similar sentiments are ex
pressed. The disagreement about
the content and nature of Gaieties,
then, is a symptom of a campus cul
ture that does not engage issues of
diversity as well as it could. The
University can and must do a bet
ter job in making sure that students
don't let instances like these pass
by without real discussion. More
over, the University has an obliga
tion to make sure students do some
soul searching while they are here
to understand their own identities
and how they participate in race,
ethnicity, gender, religion, sexual
orientation and all other aspects
that compose one's identity.
