## HALFWAY THERE Card perfect in Pac-10 at mid-point 
### NATE ADAMS MANAGING EDITOR 
Halfway through the Pac-10 sea
son, the Cardinal women's basketball
team has left little room to doubt who
is in control of the conference. No. 4
Stanford (18-2, 9-0 Pac-10) made
short work of Oregon State in its
most recent trouncing of a Pac-10 op
ponent last Saturday, earning a 74-44
victory and extending its winning
streak to 12.
Senior forward Kayla Pedersen
shot 6-for-7 from the field and posted
a season-high 21 points in the win
over the Beavers (7-13,0-9), who lost
their ninth straight game despite jun
ior Earlysia Marchbank's career-best
19 points. Stanford's Jeannette
Pohlen added 15 points of her own, all
from beyond the arc. The senior point
guard also dished out five assists,
pulled down four rebounds and made
one steal.

Stanford has now played every
team in the conference, defeating all
nine by an average of 35 points. The
closest any opponent has come is a
less-than-threatening 26 points, when
then-No. 8 UCLA lost at Maples
Pavilion, 64-38, on Jan. 20. The Cardi
nal, winner of nine straight regular
season Pac-10 championships, has
failed to break the 80-point mark
only twice since December, and still
won both of those games, a 78-45 win
over Cal on Jan. 2 and Saturday's 74-
44 win over OSU, by 30 or more
points.
"I think right now we're playing
pretty well together and for each
other," Pohlen said. "One thing about
our team is we stick together no mat
ter what. It's a special team, and
hopefully we'll keep it going through
the second half."
The Cardinal opened the game
with a 12-0 run, capped off by one of
Pohlen's five buckets from long
range. After a brief Beavers rally that
pulled them within five after a
Marchbanks three-pointer, OSU
couldn't find an answer for Stanford's
balanced offensive attack. No Cardi
nal player scored consecutive baskets
from the field in the first half, with
Pohlen and junior guard Lindy
La√üocque peppering in long-range
shots and dishing the ball down to
forwards Chiney and Nnemkadi Og
wumike. Stanford scored only 10 of
its 39 first-half points in the paint, and
at one point made four consecutive
threes.
Stanford's starting five kept up the
pressure in the second frame, extend
ing the Cardinal lead to 55-26 with
13:22 left to play. Head coach Tara
VanDerveer started to insert her
bench players at that point, beginning
with redshirt junior Sarah Boothe

and sophomore forward Joslyn Tin
kle. Within a few minutes, the starting
rotation had completely rolled over
with the addition of sophomore for
ward Mikaela Ruef, redshirt senior
guard Melanie Murphy and freshman
guard Sara James.
Notably absent from the parade of
substitutes was freshman guard Toni
Kokenis, who suffered a head injury
last week. It remains unclear when
she will be able to return.
Stanford's bench played a com
bined 65 minutes, accounting for
nearly a third of the total game time.
Despite pushing the Cardinal to a
game-high lead of 36 with 6:45 to
play, the reserves weren't particularly
impressive on offense, shooting just
5-for-20 and scoring 11. Boothe shot
just 2-for-9 from the field, and Tinkle

was 2-for-6. Stanford's overall shoot
ing percentage slipped from 59.1 in
the first half to just 38.2 in the second.
"Moving on, we're just going to
have to figure out who can help us in
tight games," VanDerveer said.
Junior guard Grace Mashore pro
vided one bright spot amidst the re
serves' score sheet, pulling down a
team-high eight rebounds in just 12
minutes.
Despite her efforts, though, the Car
dinal as a whole was less than stellar on
the boards. Even with the lopsided
score, the Beavers managed to garner
35 rebounds compared to Stanford's
40, including a 19-to-16 advantage on
the offensive side. Senior El Sara Greer
led the Beavers with 10 boards.
