# All-star apathy: What's the point?
## 
### Daniel Bohm On My Mind 
I didn't have all that much to
do this weekend. Just your
usual college things
homework, some partying,
some relaxing. You know
what didn't make my list of things
to do? Watching the Pro Bowl or
the NHL All-Star Game. Did you
watch either one? Probably not.
Why is that? These are sup
posed to be exhibitions of the
greatest athletes in the world
the best of the best on one field at
the same time. But even as a mas
sive sports fan, I had exactly zero
interest in either game. These
events are concocted and boring,
and the players want to be there
just about as much I want to watch
them half-ass their way through
the games.
I'm fairly certain that if it
weren't for the bragging rights
that players gain and the con
tract leverage these games
wouldn't even be played.
The Pro Bowl is the worst. I
have to admit, I haven't watched it
in years, so my thoughts could be
outdated, but I doubt it.
It isn't football. The rules are
actually changed (for player safe
ty, of course). If I recall correctly,
defenses can't blitz, they have to
play a 4-3 formation and offenses
are limited in what types of plays
can be called. The players are in

Hawaii, and would clearly rather
be on the beach (or in the clubs)
than on the field. That's true, at
least, for the players who actually
make the trip every year there
are plenty of players who have
"injuries" conveniently come up
so they can't go. (In their defense,
after playing a 16-game season,
the players are probably fairly
beat up the thought of playing
one more meaningless game isn't
all that appealing.)
Oh, and because it is a week
before the Super Bowl, players
from the two "best" teams in the
league can't make the trip.
Speaking of Super Bowl play
ers, Steeler starting linebacker
LaMarr Woodley made a telling
tweet about the Pro Bowl last
night:
"Really wish I was playing in
this pro bowl game right now...
NOT!"
I will admit that the NHL All-
Star Game seemed somewhat in
teresting this year. You have to
