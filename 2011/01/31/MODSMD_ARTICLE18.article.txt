# All-star apathy: What's the point?
## 
### Daniel Bohm On My Mind 
I didn't have all that much to
do this weekend. Just your
usual college things
homework, some partying,
some relaxing. You know
what didn't make my list of things
to do? Watching the Pro Bowl or
the NHL All-Star Game. Did you
watch either one? Probably not.
Why is that? These are sup
posed to be exhibitions of the
greatest athletes in the world
the best of the best on one field at
the same time. But even as a mas
sive sports fan, I had exactly zero
interest in either game. These
events are concocted and boring,
and the players want to be there
just about as much I want to watch
them half-ass their way through
the games.
I'm fairly certain that if it
weren't for the bragging rights
that players gain and the con
tract leverage these games
wouldn't even be played.
The Pro Bowl is the worst. I
have to admit, I haven't watched it
in years, so my thoughts could be
outdated, but I doubt it.
It isn't football. The rules are
actually changed (for player safe
ty, of course). If I recall correctly,
defenses can't blitz, they have to
play a 4-3 formation and offenses
are limited in what types of plays
can be called. The players are in

Hawaii, and would clearly rather
be on the beach (or in the clubs)
than on the field. That's true, at
least, for the players who actually
make the trip every year there
are plenty of players who have
"injuries" conveniently come up
so they can't go. (In their defense,
after playing a 16-game season,
the players are probably fairly
beat up the thought of playing
one more meaningless game isn't
all that appealing.)
Oh, and because it is a week
before the Super Bowl, players
from the two "best" teams in the
league can't make the trip.
Speaking of Super Bowl play
ers, Steeler starting linebacker
LaMarr Woodley made a telling
tweet about the Pro Bowl last
night:
"Really wish I was playing in
this pro bowl game right now...
NOT!"
I will admit that the NHL All-
Star Game seemed somewhat in
teresting this year. You have to

give the NHL some credit. Ever since
the league's lockout, hockey's popu
larity has dwindled in the states, so the
league is continually innovating to
become more watchable. The idea of
having two players act as team cap
tains and draft their teams like a
bunch of kids in the schoolyard is
pretty cool, if you ask me.
But that's only the lead-up to the
game. The NHL All-Star Game itself
is still not hockey. In fact, the only
game in any sport in which there is
less defense would be the NBA All-
Star Game (where you might need a
calculator to keep score).
Players don't tend to play aggres
sively, which is understandable given
that it is the middle of the season and
an injury during the all-star game
would be devastating, if not contro
versial. That's one good thing I can
say about the Pro Bowl is that it
doesn't take place during the regular
season.
(Off the top of my head, I can't
think about a player getting injured

during the NHL, NBA or MLB all
star games in the middle of the sea
son, but the fact that it can occur and
affect the rest of the season is trou
bling.)
That said, Robert Edwards had
just finished his rookie season in 1998
as a running back for the New Eng
land Patriots when he blew out his
knee playing in a rookie flag football
game, one of the Pro Bowl-week
events at the time. Edwards almost
had his leg amputated, and although
he made it back to the NFL briefly,
his career was never the same after
the injury.
And what is it all for? Guys like
Edwards can have their careers ru
ined for what, exactly? I'm sure the
league probably profits off the games
and players can pad their egos for
getting invited, but in the grand
scheme of things, I have to ask: is
there really much more to an all-star
game than a media spectacle? I don't
think so.

Dan Bohm,justafew inches too short
to make it as a professional quarter
back, is just lamenting the fact that he
won't be eating roasted boar at a
Hawaiian luau. Sympathize with him
