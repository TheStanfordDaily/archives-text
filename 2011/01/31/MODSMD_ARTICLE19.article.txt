# Card pulls off sweep
## Stanford perfect in dual-match play 
### DASH DAVIDSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford men's tennis
team continued its impressive sea
son last weekend, hosting and de
feating No. 54 Santa Clara on Fri
day and No. 41 Nebraska on Satur
day. The No. 8 Cardinal won both
matches with ease, blanking the
Broncos, 4-0, before cruising past
the Cornhuskers, 6-1.

Stanford head coach John
Whitlinger said at the beginning of
the weekend that these two
matches were about "getting our
feet underneath us, getting a little
confidence going and performing
at a high level."
The convincing pair of wins,
which came after Stanford's sea
son-opening 7-0 victory over
Sacramento State on Jan. 25, put

the Cardinal exactly in line with
that goal.
Friday's contest versus Santa
Clara was shortened due to wet
court conditions from the previous
night's rain, but the match lasted
long enough for Stanford to secure

the 4-0 shutout. Despite the two
hour and 20-minute delay, the Car
dinal came out firing with two
quick doubles victories to secure
the match's pivotal first point.
Junior Ryan Thatcher and sen
ior Greg Hirshmann, playing out

of the No. 2 and No. 5 spots, both
scored quick 6-2, 6-2 victories in
singles play. That left Stanford's
No. 1 player, junior Bradley Klahn,
to finish the match by defeating

Doing his part to boost Stanford past cross-town rival Santa Clara, junior Ryan Thatcher, above, earned a 6-2,
6-2 win out of the No. 2 spot in singles play. Stanford won the abbreviated dual match, 4-0.
the Broncos' Kyle Dandan 6-4,6-4,
earning Stanford its fourth win and
clinching point.
In addition to looking to build on
momentum from the win over
Sacramento State, the Cardinal
needed a strong weekend to clinch a
berth in the prestigious National
Team Indoor Championships. Stan
ford's victory over Nebraska on Sat
urday sealed a trip to trip to Seattle
for the February event, an impor
tant achievement for any high-as
piring team early in the dual-match
season.
Despite upsetting the Vanderbilt
Commodores a day before, Nebras
ka stumbled out of the gate on Sat

urday. The Cornhuskers were
blitzed early and often by the Cardi
nal, starting with a doubles match
that took a mere 42 minutes.

All of Stanford's big guns came
through in the singles matches, with
each of the top-five matches going
Stanford's way. The Cardinal was
anchored by Klahn, who fought
hard in a tough match to defeat Ne
braska's No. 1 player, Christopher
Aumueller, 7-6 (0),7-6 (4). The lone
defeat of the day for the Cardinal,
and its only loss of the year, came
when Nebraska's Sebastian Flor
czyk defeated sophomore Matt
Kandath, 7-5, 3-6, 7-5, in the No. 6-
spot game.

Stanford's next match is set for
Thursday, Feb. 3rd, at home against
Texas Tech.
