# Card pulls off sweep
## Stanford perfect in dual-match play 
### DASH DAVIDSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford men's tennis
team continued its impressive sea
son last weekend, hosting and de
feating No. 54 Santa Clara on Fri
day and No. 41 Nebraska on Satur
day. The No. 8 Cardinal won both
matches with ease, blanking the
Broncos, 4-0, before cruising past
the Cornhuskers, 6-1.

Stanford head coach John
Whitlinger said at the beginning of
the weekend that these two
matches were about "getting our
feet underneath us, getting a little
confidence going and performing
at a high level."
The convincing pair of wins,
which came after Stanford's sea
son-opening 7-0 victory over
Sacramento State on Jan. 25, put

the Cardinal exactly in line with
that goal.
Friday's contest versus Santa
Clara was shortened due to wet
court conditions from the previous
night's rain, but the match lasted
long enough for Stanford to secure

the 4-0 shutout. Despite the two
hour and 20-minute delay, the Car
dinal came out firing with two
quick doubles victories to secure
the match's pivotal first point.
Junior Ryan Thatcher and sen
ior Greg Hirshmann, playing out

of the No. 2 and No. 5 spots, both
scored quick 6-2, 6-2 victories in
singles play. That left Stanford's
No. 1 player, junior Bradley Klahn,
to finish the match by defeating
