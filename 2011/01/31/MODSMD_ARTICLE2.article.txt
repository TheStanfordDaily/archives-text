## Cantor art draws on technology Museum adds online catalogs, video displays 
### MATT BETTONVILLE DESK EDITOR 
An art museum is not the first place
most students go to find new uses for tech
nology. However, Cantor Arts Center is
implementing several new initiatives to
augment and expand the museum experi
ence, including Google mapping, gallery
video displays and online visual catalogs.
"It's about providing another way to
get people to interact with the art," said
Oliver O'Donnell, Cantor outdoor sculp
ture technician, of the new technologies.
"They're ways of trying to get you to slow
down and look at the art."
Video screens mounted beside the typ
ical museum gallery display plaques are
meant to provide museumgoers with a
more immersive experience into the back
ground, process and history of the artwork.
"It's just to create an opportunity for an
interaction with the viewer, so that you're
not just going into the gallery and standing
in front of the artwork and being ennobled
by its presence," O'Donnell said. "You're
interacting with it on some more involved
level."
Cantor administrative associate Kristin
Olson, who headed up the video screen
project, said that the museum installed
video screens based on which pieces
begged for additional information. The
videos range in content from footage of
artists such as Alice Neel in the process of
painting the works on display to explana
tions of some newer pieces of art, including
Bay Area-artist Richard Diebenkorn. Ac
cording to Olson, this should help some
viewers who might otherwise struggle to
appreciate the art.
Cantor is also using Quick Response
(QR) codes alongside its artwork to direct
patrons' smartphones to websites or
videos that may supplement their museum
experience. Olson said that QR codes are
going to see much greater implementation
in the near future.
QR codes incorporate the Web with the
internal experience of the museum, but
outside in the Rodin Sculpture Garden,
Olson is taking things a step further. The
outdoor collection can be viewed entirely
on Google maps. The purpose of the map
ping project is to provide a paperless alter
native to the hard copy maps that the mu
seum has available; however, it also allows
access to photos of the sculpture collection
from anywhere by hovering a mouse over
a map location.
The next major project currently un
derway for the museum is an online cata-
