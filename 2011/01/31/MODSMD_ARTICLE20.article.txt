## Stanford moves on in NTICs 
### WILLSEATON STAFF WRITER 
It didn't start well against No. 39 Okla
homa (2-1), but after dropping the dou
bles point for the first time this year, Stan
ford's women's tennis team (3-0) breezed
through singles play to defeat the Soon
ers, 6-1, in the second round of the Nation
al Team Indoor Championships. Stanford
now qualifies for the main event of the
NTICs, which begins on Feb. 17.
Dropping the doubles point is some
thing that occurs very rarely for the Car
dinal. Last season, it happened just three
times, with two coming in the NCAA
Tournament.

"[Oklahoma] takes a lot of pride in
their doubles," said sophomore Mallory
Burdette, who sat out with an injury this
past weekend. "They played super well,
and some days that is just going to hap
pen. They were happy to have won the
doubles point, but they still had a moun
tain to climb if they wanted to beat us."

STANFORD 6
OKLAHOMA 1
1/29, Charlottesville, Va.
The Cardinal's No. 1 team of
senior Hilary Barte and sophomore
Stacey Tan suffered a surprisingly
lopsided 8-1 loss against the na
tion's No. 31-ranked doubles pair in
senior Ana-Maria Constantinescu
and freshman Alice Radu. Junior
Veronica Li and senior Carolyn
McVeigh dropped their match, 8-5.
In another promising showing, the
freshman pair of Kristie Ahn and
Nicole Gibbs dominated their op
ponents, 8-1, for Stanford's lone
doubles win.
"We went through a really bad
patch earlier this year," Ahn said on
her partnership with Gibbs. "We
had four losses in a row after doing
really well with Regionals. We were
considering splitting up and trying
different things out, but since then,
1 think we've stepped it up a lot."
Faced with a 1-0 deficit, the Car
dinal quickly came out and erased
any momentum Oklahoma gained
from their doubles wins. Playing at
the No. 2 spot, Ahn was first off the
court, conceding just one game in a
6-1, 6-0 drubbing of Oklahoma's
Whitney Ritchie. Soon after, Gibbs
posted an equally impressive 6-0,6-
2 win over Marie-Pier Huet.
"I was really fired up yesterday,"
Ahn said. "Especially after losing
the doubles point. I think at [posi
tions] 1, 2 and 3, we were just so
pumped, and we were cheering
each other on. At one point, Hilary
and I won a point at the same time.
We looked over, our eyes met, we
both got fired up and I just got real
ly into it from there."
Barte put Stanford within one
point of victory with her 6-0,6-2 de
feat of Constantinescu. Tan
clinched the match with a quick
three-setter, dropping the first set
before finding her zone and surren
dering only one more game for a 3-
6, 6-1, 6-0 victory. Li defeated her
opponent, 6-4, 6-0, and McVeigh
finished hers off as well, 6-4,6-2, as
Stanford swept the singles.
"I was especially impressed after
we dropped the doubles point that
everyone bounced back and took
care of their business," Burdette
said. "My freshman year, we had a
bad experience the first time we
dropped the doubles point. We
ended up losing to UCLA, 6-1. It's
good the freshmen experienced
that and bounced back as well as
they did."

Earlier in the weekend, Stanford
faced No. 65 Cal Poly (1-2) in the
first round of qualification. Cal Poly
was making its first-ever program
appearance in the 60-team Kick-
Off Weekend for NTICs, but failed
to record the upset.
Stanford swept the doubles with
Barte and Tan clinching the point
with an 8-2 victory. Ahn and Gibbs
won, 8-3, and Li and McVeigh won
their match, 8-2. In singles, Tan was
the first one off the court with a 6-1,
6-0 victory over Jennifer Cornea.

Gibbs playing at No. 3, finished up
next after recording a 6-0,6-3 score.
Li clinched the point with another
6-1,6-0 win over Jocelyn Davis. The
remaining three matches were not
finished.
Stanford will continue NTIC
competition in Virginia on Feb. 17.
Before that, though, the Cardinal
faces a tough test in visiting UCLA
on Feb. 5 at 12 p.m.

WOMEN'S TENNIS
STANFORD 6
OKLAHOMA 1
1/29, Charlottesville, Va.
The Cardinal's No. 1 team of
senior Hilary Barte and sophomore
Stacey Tan suffered a surprisingly
lopsided 8-1 loss against the na
tion's No. 31-ranked doubles pair in
senior Ana-Maria Constantinescu
and freshman Alice Radu. Junior
Veronica Li and senior Carolyn
McVeigh dropped their match, 8-5.
In another promising showing, the
freshman pair of Kristie Ahn and
Nicole Gibbs dominated their op
ponents, 8-1, for Stanford's lone
doubles win.
"We went through a really bad
patch earlier this year," Ahn said on
her partnership with Gibbs. "We
had four losses in a row after doing
really well with Regionals. We were
considering splitting up and trying
different things out, but since then,
1 think we've stepped it up a lot."
Faced with a 1-0 deficit, the Car
dinal quickly came out and erased
any momentum Oklahoma gained
from their doubles wins. Playing at
the No. 2 spot, Ahn was first off the
court, conceding just one game in a
6-1, 6-0 drubbing of Oklahoma's
Whitney Ritchie. Soon after, Gibbs
posted an equally impressive 6-0,6-
2 win over Marie-Pier Huet.
"I was really fired up yesterday,"
Ahn said. "Especially after losing
the doubles point. I think at [posi
tions] 1, 2 and 3, we were just so
pumped, and we were cheering
each other on. At one point, Hilary
and I won a point at the same time.
We looked over, our eyes met, we
both got fired up and I just got real
ly into it from there."
Barte put Stanford within one
point of victory with her 6-0,6-2 de
feat of Constantinescu. Tan
clinched the match with a quick
three-setter, dropping the first set
before finding her zone and surren
dering only one more game for a 3-
6, 6-1, 6-0 victory. Li defeated her
opponent, 6-4, 6-0, and McVeigh
finished hers off as well, 6-4,6-2, as
Stanford swept the singles.
"I was especially impressed after
we dropped the doubles point that
everyone bounced back and took
care of their business," Burdette
said. "My freshman year, we had a
bad experience the first time we
dropped the doubles point. We
ended up losing to UCLA, 6-1. It's
good the freshmen experienced
that and bounced back as well as
they did."

Earlier in the weekend, Stanford
faced No. 65 Cal Poly (1-2) in the
first round of qualification. Cal Poly
was making its first-ever program
appearance in the 60-team Kick-
Off Weekend for NTICs, but failed
to record the upset.
Stanford swept the doubles with
Barte and Tan clinching the point
with an 8-2 victory. Ahn and Gibbs
won, 8-3, and Li and McVeigh won
their match, 8-2. In singles, Tan was
the first one off the court with a 6-1,
6-0 victory over Jennifer Cornea.

Gibbs playing at No. 3, finished up
next after recording a 6-0,6-3 score.
Li clinched the point with another
6-1,6-0 win over Jocelyn Davis. The
remaining three matches were not
finished.
Stanford will continue NTIC
competition in Virginia on Feb. 17.
Before that, though, the Cardinal
faces a tough test in visiting UCLA
on Feb. 5 at 12 p.m.
