## Stanford moves on in NTICs 
### WILLSEATON STAFF WRITER 
It didn't start well against No. 39 Okla
homa (2-1), but after dropping the dou
bles point for the first time this year, Stan
ford's women's tennis team (3-0) breezed
through singles play to defeat the Soon
ers, 6-1, in the second round of the Nation
al Team Indoor Championships. Stanford
now qualifies for the main event of the
NTICs, which begins on Feb. 17.
Dropping the doubles point is some
thing that occurs very rarely for the Car
dinal. Last season, it happened just three
times, with two coming in the NCAA
Tournament.

"[Oklahoma] takes a lot of pride in
their doubles," said sophomore Mallory
Burdette, who sat out with an injury this
past weekend. "They played super well,
and some days that is just going to hap
pen. They were happy to have won the
doubles point, but they still had a moun
tain to climb if they wanted to beat us."
