# SPLIT IN SOCAL
## 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH DESK EDITOR 
One day after sweeping No. 13
Cal State Northridge and hitting
.349 as a team, the Stanford men's
volleyball team fell flat against No.
5 Long Beach State, hitting just .021
as a team and losing in straight sets.
The weekend split showed how
tough the Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation can be, especially on
the road. Stanford (5-2,4-2 MPSF)
dropped into a tie for third place
in the conference, sitting a game
behind Long Beach (6-3, 5-1) and
two games back of first-place
use.

The Cardinal was done in by un
characteristically poor outside hit
ting. Junior Brad Lawson, usually
one of Stanford's most consistent
attackers, had 10 kills, but hit just
.074 and had eight errors. Lawson's
counterpart, senior Spencer
McLachlin, also had 10 kills, but like
Lawson, had a number of errors
and hit .107.
In game one on Saturday, the
Cardinal had opportunities to take

the lead several times, including
late in the set. The score was tied at
12-12 before the 49ers went on a
five-point run to take a 17-12 ad
vantage. Stanford battled back to
within a point at 18-17, but two con
secutive attack errors swung the
momentum back to Long Beach,
and it closed out the set, 25-21.
Game two was close throughout,
with Stanford clinging to an early
lead and building a five-point lead
mid-way through the set at 16-11.
But Long Beach came back and
took a 19-18 lead before a McLach
lin kill retied the score at 19. The
49ers did not flinch, however, and
rode the momentum from their
small crowd of 734 to take the sec
ond set 25-21.
The third game saw the Cardinal
jump out to a 6-3 lead before six at
tack helped put Long Beach back
up, 11-6. The 49ers didn't look back
and rolled to a 25-13 victory.
"There's the old adage that you
always learn more from a loss than
a win," said Stanford head coach
John Kosty. "It's not something we
wanted, but we'll definitely need
to take advantage of it and move
on."
It was a far cry from the scene a
day earlier against Northridge (2-6,
1-4). The rematch of last year's
MPSF tournament final was all

Cardinal from the onset. Stanford
led the whole way and hit .481 as a
team in game one, as the Matadors
made eight errors and hit just .182.
Lawson had five kills in the first set,
and Evan Barry had 13 assists.
Stanford had not won at North
ridge since 2004 and had dropped
seven of the last nine matches, but
only looked vulnerable in the sec
ond set with Northridge staving off
three Stanford set points before ul
timately falling, 25-27.
Five straight kills, two from
freshman Eric Mochalski, gave
Stanford a comfortable 15-10 cush
ion in the middle of the third set, and
the Cardinal took the third game of
its seven-game road trip that
spanned 9,186 miles over 16 days.
Once again, Stanford was helped
by big performances from its fresh
men. Steven frvin got his second
start of the year as an outside hitter
and had a solid all-around game
with seven kills, six digs and five
blocks.
Stanford finally plays at home this
week, hosting Pacific on Wednesday
night at 7 p.m. The team will hit the
road again next weekend, getting a
break from conference action against
Lewis and Loyola of Chicago.

On a trip that showed two different faces of Stanford's team, Spencer McLaughlin (No. 14) was consistent in both
matches. The senior outside hitter had 15 kills against Cal State Northridge and 10 at Long Beach State.
