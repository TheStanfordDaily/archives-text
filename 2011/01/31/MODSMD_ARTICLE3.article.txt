## Kappa Sigma retains charter after conference 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€”An Le Nguyen 
Kappa Sigma returned yesterday from
its conference before the national
Supreme Executive Committee (SEC)
with its charter intact. The fraternity's on
campus housing remains at the discretion
of the University.
The fraternity was placed on provision
al alcohol and party suspension last Octo
ber for violating the Controlled Sub
stances and Alcohol Policy. Student groups
that breach this policy risk suspension of
social privileges and loss of University
recognition and housing.
Kappa Sigma allegedly hosted an un
registered event during New Student Ori
entation, which is a "dry" week. Stanford
subsequently ruled that the fraternity
could not host large-scale events in which
alcohol is served or consumed.
This weekend's conference, which took
place in Las Vegas, mainly focused on
how Kappa Sigma's Stanford chapter
can more closely abide by national
guidelines. The meeting had tangen
tial implications for the chapter's vio
lation of Stanford's alcohol policy.
"We were called to present why
we deserve our charter," said Sam
Gould 'll of the meeting.
Had its charter been revoked, the
fraternity would have been at greater
risk of losing its campus housing. Ac
cording to Kappa Sigma president

Brian Barnes 'l2, this is no longer a
main concern.
Since the fraternity will retain its
charter, the disciplinary meeting
"does not reflect on the current case"
with the University of maintaining
campus housing, Barnes said.
Speaking on the future of Kappa
Sigma's presence on campus, former
president Harris Brown 'll was opti
mistic about finding a solution.
"We view it as privilege to have a
place that we can call 'home,'" Brown
wrote in an e-mail to The Daily. "As
such, we look forward to remaining
in our house for the foreseeable fu
ture."
