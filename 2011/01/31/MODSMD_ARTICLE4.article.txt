## Group envisions current buildings as part of planned arts district 
### ZOE LEAVITT SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
As the completion of the fu
ture home of the Stanford Gradu
ate School of Business looms, an
ticipation is heating up among
groups vying to take over the
school's current buildings. How
ever, the biggest change that this
transition might bring to campus
is the creation of a new arts hub.
The new Knight Management
Center opened the doors to four
of its eight buildings in January
and will open the rest in March.
The GSB's move will create a

domino effect across campus, as
other departments and offices
shuffle into the newly vacated
spaces.
Decisions about which depart
ments will gain access to the
school's current buildings
namely, GSB South and the Lit
tlefield Management Center
remain in the application process.
"The decision will be made
based on programmatic priorities,
the best fit and most efficient use
of the space," wrote Laura Gold
stein, a building project manager,
in an e-mail to The Daily. "As it is
an important and prominent loca

tion, we hope to create a vibrant
environment that connects well to
the surrounding area of campus."
The development of an arts
district, which has been under
consideration for several years
and was approved by the Office of
the President, is one possibility.
The Cantor Arts Center, the new
Bing Concert Hall and offices in
the current GSB buildings would
serve as cornerstones for the dis
trict.
"In the same way we have an
engineering quad on campus,
we'll have an area where the arts
are concentrated," said Bryan

Wolf, co-director of the Stanford
Arts Initiative.
According to Wolf, the district
would be an area "saturated with
arts activity."
"It faces out to Palo Alto so it
will be the part that greets the
community, an announcement to
the world about the importance of
[the] arts and their centrality to
the vision of Stanford education,"
he added.
The Arts Initiative, established
in Oct. 2006, hopes that the dis
trict will enhance opportunities
