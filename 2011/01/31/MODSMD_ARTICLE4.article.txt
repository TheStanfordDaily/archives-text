# Arts Initiative eyes GSB
## Group envisions current buildings as part of planned arts district 
### ZOE LEAVITT SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
As the completion of the fu
ture home of the Stanford Gradu
ate School of Business looms, an
ticipation is heating up among
groups vying to take over the
school's current buildings. How
ever, the biggest change that this
transition might bring to campus
is the creation of a new arts hub.
The new Knight Management
Center opened the doors to four
of its eight buildings in January
and will open the rest in March.
The GSB's move will create a

domino effect across campus, as
other departments and offices
shuffle into the newly vacated
spaces.
Decisions about which depart
ments will gain access to the
school's current buildings
namely, GSB South and the Lit
tlefield Management Center
remain in the application process.
"The decision will be made
based on programmatic priorities,
the best fit and most efficient use
of the space," wrote Laura Gold
stein, a building project manager,
in an e-mail to The Daily. "As it is
an important and prominent loca

tion, we hope to create a vibrant
environment that connects well to
the surrounding area of campus."
The development of an arts
district, which has been under
consideration for several years
and was approved by the Office of
the President, is one possibility.
The Cantor Arts Center, the new
Bing Concert Hall and offices in
the current GSB buildings would
serve as cornerstones for the dis
trict.
"In the same way we have an
engineering quad on campus,
we'll have an area where the arts
are concentrated," said Bryan

Wolf, co-director of the Stanford
Arts Initiative.
According to Wolf, the district
would be an area "saturated with
arts activity."
"It faces out to Palo Alto so it
will be the part that greets the
community, an announcement to
the world about the importance of
[the] arts and their centrality to
the vision of Stanford education,"
he added.
The Arts Initiative, established
in Oct. 2006, hopes that the dis
trict will enhance opportunities
for interdisciplinary work and
make the arts more accessible for
the student body and the Palo Alto
community. The goal is that the dis
trict will encourage synergies be
tween classroom work and ex
tracurricular arts activity.
The tentative plan includes a
new classroom building next to the
Cantor Arts Center, which would
allow classes to better integrate the
art displayed there with curricula.
The initiative intends to use space
in the GSB's current Littlefield
buildings for administrative offices,
offices for fellows and multipur
pose classrooms.
Arts walks outdoor spaces
with sculpture and performance art
leading viewers from the Bing Con
cert Hall to Cantor and around the
rest of the district would also
provide students a chance to design
outdoor projects and enhance art
around campus.
Matthew Tiews, executive direc
tor of arts programs, said that the
new buildings would make a
"major statement about the arts"

and could mobilize arts program
ming at Stanford.
"It will raise the profile of arts
on campus, so we're very, very excit
ed about that," Tiews said.
The full timeline for the arts dis
trict stretches over the next 10 to 15
years, and the program's applica
tion for the current GSB buildings
is not yet confirmed. The decision
making timeline with regards to al
location of the GSB's current space
is still indeterminate.
However, Wolf is confident that
the administration had integrated
the idea of an arts district into its
overall goals for the University.
"Because the space is so valu
able, I'm sure many groups will
want it, but it seems fairly clear
we'll be moving in," Wolf said. "The
University has been very commit
ted to maintaining the strength of
the Arts Department and expand
ing it in tough budgetary times."
Tiews said the University is be
coming a model for expanding art
imitative throughout campus. He
mentioned that Harvard, which has
been considering a similar district
on its campus, recently came to
Stanford for advice and ideas.

The Graduate School of Business South, above, is the current home of the
GSB, as the school's classes and administration remain in the process of
moving to the Knight Management Center. The Stanford Arts Initiative is a
strong contenderto occupy the building once the GSB completes the move.
