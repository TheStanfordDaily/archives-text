GAME NOTES ! After snapping a four-game losing streak
against Oregon State, the Cardinal will return to
Maples Pavilion to host the Arizona Wildcats this
Thursday. The Wildcats are second in the Pac-10
standings and are coming off a sweep of the Los
Angeles schools.


KYLE ANDERSON/The Stanford Daily
The Cardinal got a huge boost on Satuday night from Anthony Brown (No. 3). The freshman
forward, making his first career start, posted 21 points and eight rebounds in the win.

"Anthony has been working real
ly hard, and he's getting better,"
Dawkins said. "I was really proud of
his effort tonight. I knew he could
score, but I wanted to see how he re
bounded. He stuffed the stat sheet
tonight."

Brown was not the only Stanford
player who made his presence felt
across all facets of the game. Despite
attempting just a single shot in the
first half, redshirt junior forward Josh
Owens finished the game with 14
points, complementing his eight re
bounds and two blocks. Owens was
the recipient of multiple second-half
alley-oops, hooking up several times
with junior guard Jarrett Mann, who
finished the game with seven assists.
Dawkins, critical of Owens' lack
of touches in the team's loss to Ore
gon, was pleased to see his dominant
forward take initiative in the second
half on Saturday.
"I tried to explain to Josh at half
that he has to do a better job assert
ing himself," Dawkins said. "I
thought in the second half he did a
better job."
The Cardinal was able to over
come another careless game after
finding a solution to the Beavers' (8-
12, 3-6) press. The two teams com
bined for 37 turnovers on the night,
with most stemming from lazy cross
court passes and high-pressure de
fense.
Freshman guard Ahmad Starks
led the way for Oregon State, scoring
a career-high 17 points on 6-for-13
shooting. The pint-sized player was
able to slash his way through a Stan
ford backcourt that's faced its fair
share of troubles with quick guards in
the last decade.
The Cardinal sped out of the
gates, going on a 13-2 run to open the
game behind three-pointers by
Brown and Green. Oregon State
head coach Craig Robinson, brother
of First Lady Michelle Obama,
quickly resorted to a full-court press
that slowed down the Stanford at
tack.
The Beavers fought back and
took their first lead of the game, 28-
27, with 2:57 left in the half. The Car
dinal looked destined for another

sub-60 point performance, but a
Brown three put Stanford ahead, 31-
30, at the break.
Neither team was able to pull
ahead at the beginning of the second
half. Oregon State sophomore guard
Jared Cunningham, who entered the
game as the Beaver's leading scorer
at over 14 points per game, scored his
first and only point of the contest at
the 12:00 mark by splitting a pair of
free throws. Cunningham battled
foul trouble all game and eventually
fouled out, sealing his worst outing of
the season.
Dawkins gave credit to Mann's
defensive effort when addressing
Cunningham's struggles.
"I'm really proud of Jarrett," he
said. "He looks forward to guarding
the opposing team's best player.
The Cardinal eventually man
aged to find a solution to the press,
taking advantage of slow defensive
switches by Oregon State and cat
alyzing a Stanford dunkfest. Owens,
freshman forward Dwight Powell
and junior forward Jack Trotter were
left alone underneath the hoop time
and time again. A Mann-to-Owens
connection capped off a 16-3 run that
gave Stanford its largest lead of the
game at 67-51 with just 2:57 left in the
game.
Brown was excited about the re
vival of a Stanford team that seemed
to have lost its focus after a hot start
to the season.
"It was very fun, he said. "I think
our team is getting a lot more chem
istry.
Stanford hosts the Arizona
schools this weekend in the second
part of a rare four-game home stand.
Tipoff against Arizona is set for

half on Saturday.
"I tried to explain to Josh at half
that he has to do a better job assert
ing himself," Dawkins said. "I
thought in the second half he did a
better job."
The Cardinal was able to over
come another careless game after
finding a solution to the Beavers' (8-
12, 3-6) press. The two teams com
bined for 37 turnovers on the night,
with most stemming from lazy cross
court passes and high-pressure de
fense.
Freshman guard Ahmad Starks
led the way for Oregon State, scoring
a career-high 17 points on 6-for-13
shooting. The pint-sized player was
able to slash his way through a Stan
ford backcourt that's faced its fair
share of troubles with quick guards in
the last decade.
The Cardinal sped out of the
gates, going on a 13-2 run to open the
game behind three-pointers by
Brown and Green. Oregon State
head coach Craig Robinson, brother
of First Lady Michelle Obama,
quickly resorted to a full-court press
that slowed down the Stanford at
tack.
The Beavers fought back and
took their first lead of the game, 28-
27, with 2:57 left in the half. The Car
dinal looked destined for another

sub-60 point performance, but a
Brown three put Stanford ahead, 31-
30, at the break.
Neither team was able to pull
ahead at the beginning of the second
half. Oregon State sophomore guard
Jared Cunningham, who entered the
game as the Beaver's leading scorer
at over 14 points per game, scored his
first and only point of the contest at
the 12:00 mark by splitting a pair of
free throws. Cunningham battled
foul trouble all game and eventually
fouled out, sealing his worst outing of
the season.
Dawkins gave credit to Mann's
defensive effort when addressing
Cunningham's struggles.
"I'm really proud of Jarrett," he
said. "He looks forward to guarding
the opposing team's best player.
The Cardinal eventually man
aged to find a solution to the press,
taking advantage of slow defensive
switches by Oregon State and cat
alyzing a Stanford dunkfest. Owens,
freshman forward Dwight Powell
and junior forward Jack Trotter were
left alone underneath the hoop time
and time again. A Mann-to-Owens
connection capped off a 16-3 run that
gave Stanford its largest lead of the
game at 67-51 with just 2:57 left in the
game.
Brown was excited about the re
vival of a Stanford team that seemed
to have lost its focus after a hot start
to the season.
"It was very fun, he said. "I think
our team is getting a lot more chem
istry.
Stanford hosts the Arizona
schools this weekend in the second
part of a rare four-game home stand.
Tipoff against Arizona is set for

GAME NOTES ! After snapping a four-game losing streak
against Oregon State, the Cardinal will return to
Maples Pavilion to host the Arizona Wildcats this
Thursday. The Wildcats are second in the Pac-10
standings and are coming off a sweep of the Los
Angeles schools.


KYLE ANDERSON/The Stanford Daily
The Cardinal got a huge boost on Satuday night from Anthony Brown (No. 3). The freshman
forward, making his first career start, posted 21 points and eight rebounds in the win.

"Anthony has been working real
ly hard, and he's getting better,"
Dawkins said. "I was really proud of
his effort tonight. I knew he could
score, but I wanted to see how he re
bounded. He stuffed the stat sheet
tonight."

Brown was not the only Stanford
player who made his presence felt
across all facets of the game. Despite
attempting just a single shot in the
first half, redshirt junior forward Josh
Owens finished the game with 14
points, complementing his eight re
bounds and two blocks. Owens was
the recipient of multiple second-half
alley-oops, hooking up several times
with junior guard Jarrett Mann, who
finished the game with seven assists.
Dawkins, critical of Owens' lack
of touches in the team's loss to Ore
gon, was pleased to see his dominant
forward take initiative in the second
half on Saturday.
"I tried to explain to Josh at half
that he has to do a better job assert
ing himself," Dawkins said. "I
