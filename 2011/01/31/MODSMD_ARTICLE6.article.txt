## ECDC on track for fall opening New East Campus dining hall will relieve pressure on Stern, Wilbur Dining 
### ELLORA ISRANI STAFF WRITER 
Stanford Dining expects the new East Cam
pus Dining Commons (ECDC) to open its
doors in late summer 2011, slightly ahead of its
projected completion date. ECDC will serve
the approximately 600 residents in Crothers
and Toyon, and will be located between those
two residence halls.
"We have passed several significant mile
stones in the project," wrote Eric Montell, ex
ecutive director of Stanford Dining, in an e
mail to the Daily. "The project, construction
and operations team are keeping the opening
date on target."
Montell also said that the complex would
stay within the $20.3 million budget approved
by the Board of Trustees.
"Considering that the project didn't start
too long ago, it's been amazing progress," said
Aditya Singh 'l3, head dining ambassador.
Catering to students

According to Stanford Dining's website,
ECDC is "designed to accentuate both sustain
able building and food programs." It will not
have a cultural focus similar to those at other
dining halls for example, FloMo's Indian
night, Wilbur's pan-Asian cuisine or Stern's
Mexican focus.
"Generally, the way we go about doing
these specialized dinners ... is once the dining
hall has been opened, we have a menu which is
a general menu," Singh said. "Then we try to
accommodate a specialty depending on the
staff and the demand that we have."
"It's supposed to be an award-winning com
plex," said Cindy Chang 'l4, dining ambassa
dor for Stern Hall.
"There's also a servery, a wellness room
[and] late night at Stern would be shifted,"
Singh said of the new dining commons. In addi
tion, east campus residents would also have ac
cess to the complex's lounge and study areas.
"Students who stay on Escondido Road end
up studying in libraries, and sometimes you
need this kind of environment," Singh said.
He added that Dining is also "seriously de
bating" creating a 24-hour eatery in ECDC.
Dining's head "cuisine team" including
its head chef and chief nutritionist will be
housed in the complex. Its core management
team will not move, but Dining hopes the
change will make the organization more acces
sible to students.
"It's going to be, from the management
point of view, one of the two pivot points of
Stanford Dining on campus," Singh said.
"Right now, our head office is at Pampas Lane,
near the Archery Field, which is kind of far
away for students to go to."

Fixing capacity issues
The new dining hall will ease pressure on
Wilbur and Stern, each of which serves about
1,000 students per meal. By com
parison, FloMo serves 350 students
per meal.
"That is the one main reason
why East Campus Dining Com
mons is being built so it diverts
the main population of Crothers,
CroMem and Toyon into ECDC,"
Singh said. "Because we already
have Branner Dining, Manzanita
Dining, Wilbur and Stern, it'll be
the fifth dining hall in the same
row."
According to Singh, an addition
al east campus dining commons is
necessary "because so many stu
dents stay there."
Prior to this year, Linx at Toyon
served as a fifth dining hall option
for Escondido Road residents, but
Stanford Dining chose to close the
facility last fall despite capacity is
sues at Stern.
"We weren't getting enough
people over there. It wasn't turning
out to be a viable business option,"
Singh said. "Sometimes, we used to
get like 50 students at a meal. When
you're talking about a mass busi
ness like Stanford Dining, the cost
benefit doesn't work out."
Since then, Linx has been used
as a study space for Toyon resi
dents; according to Montell, the
space is referred to as "Toyonito."
Montell added that Dining is
making an effort to offset the strain
on the current dining halls, adding

additional staff and hours at Stern,
Branner and Manzanita. Addition
ally, Manzanita is now open seven
days a week and serves breakfast
on weekdays.
"The dining rooms in Stern, with
the additional tables and chairs,
have enough capacity to accommo
date 80 percent of the students liv
ing in Stern, Crothers and Crothers
Memorial at one time," Montell
said. "This is identical in seating ca
pacity to all of the other Stanford
dining halls."
