Since Charles Mingus' death in 1979, Sue Mingus has created and continues
to direct repertory ensembles to carry on the music of her late husband.
Her memoir, Tonight at Noon: A Love Story, is a riveting account of her
improbable life with the peerless jazz artist who died from ALS (commonly
known as Lou Gehrig's disease) when he was only 56 years old. Ms. Mingus
is joined by Clayborne Carson, Stanford professor of history and Director of
the Martin Luther King, Jr., Research and Education Institute, for a con
versation about arts and music in the Civil Rights Era.
ALSO: Performance: Mingus Dynasty//Wednesday February 2, 8pm // Dinkelspiel
Auditorium // Tickets $10-$42 // Box Office 650-725-ARTS
The Au?'o?'a Forum is made possible with the support of Stanford Institute for Creativity and the Arts
(SiCa), Statiford's Office of Public Affairs, and Stanford's Office of the President and Provost. Generously
funded by The Koret Foundation, the Koret Jazz Project is a multi-year initiative to support, expand, and
celebrate the role of jazz in the artistic and education programming of Stanford Lively Arts.
