I belong to a student group that
listens to stories. People ask,
"What's the point?"
Social change begins with your
guts. At some gut level, we respond
to injustice. I see a fellow commu
nity member sleeping on a bench
and I know something is wrong
with the bigger picture, although I
don't yet know what. We try to re
solve our gut repugnance to injus
tice. We seek out answers by listen
ing to the stories of others. Some
day, we build our own answers. The
point is emergent.
Consider the story of Kiva. Jes
sica Jackley met business owners in
East Africa, from herders to crafts
men. After getting to know these
entrepreneurs, Jackley founded the
first microlending website. Since
2005, Kiva's loans total $lOO mil
lion.
What's the point? Jackley says,
"While those numbers are really
fun to talk about, to me, Kiva's re
ally about the stories. It's about
retelling the story of the poor, and
it's about giving ourselves an op
portunity to engage that validates
their dignity."
The point is that listening is the
first step to social change. Effective
services use approaches reached in
partnership with those served.
Night Outreach builds friend
ships with unhoused members of
our community. We volunteer at
the Opportunity Center and go on
walks to meet people who live on
the streets of Palo Alto. Through
our service, we've found we're
equally in need perspectives. In
partnership with people we've met,
we've reached new understand

mgs.
There's nothing healthy about
the situation we now meet, not for
our society and not for community
members experiencing homeless
ness. Individual causes of home
lessness are complex. In Santa
Clara County, the top reason cited
for unhoused status is loss of job.
Even for people whose personal
choices contribute to their un
housed status, no society should in
flict the experience of homeless
ness without adequate options. The
health risks should be coercion
enough â€”we need to act. No
human being should experience
the exposure to weather, circulato
ry problems, trauma and injury
risks of homelessness. Shelter is a
human right. Boston Healthcare
for the Homeless found the aver
age age of death for a group of
chronically unhoused individuals
was 51 years. This is our society.
And frankly, this is morally abhor
rent.
The need for shelter far surpass
es services available. There are 178
unhoused individuals in Palo Alto,
while the only shelter has 15 beds.
What about low-income housing?
The national average wait for Sec
tion 8 rental subsidies is 35 months.
Our local and national communi
ties do not provide adequate shel
ter options.
As Stanford students, we can
offer a community initiative that
helps meet the need for shelter in
Palo Alto. Since July, I've worked
with Aparna Ananthasubramani
