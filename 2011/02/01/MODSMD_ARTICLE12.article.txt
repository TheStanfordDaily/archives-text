# FRESHLY BAKED
## Strawberry Girl 
### Tim Moon 
I kind of hate strawberries.
They're ridiculously good-look
ing fruits, with their little green
caps perched atop plump red bod
ies, but every time I eat fresh straw
berries, my lips get a little itchy, my
stomach starts grumbling and com
plaining, and I seriously question
my intelligence for putting myself
through this yet again. I suppose
that I might just be very slightly al
lergic to strawberries, but I refuse to
consider the possibility that I might
be allergic to any foods. Besides, I
actually really like things like straw
berry jam,ice cream, and shortcake;
I'm pretty sure that
macerating/boiling/processing the
strawberries takes the evil out of
them.
Given my extreme distaste for
strawberries, you can probably
imagine how bewildered I was
when I first heard about Strawberry
Girl. I didn't live with Strawberry
Girl myself, but a bunch of my
friends did, and every so often they
just had to vent about this girl. Ap
parently, every time that fresh
strawberries were stocked for lunch
or dinner, Strawberry Girl would
get there first and clean house, fill
ing multiple take-out boxes (or
buckets, in some versions of the
story) to the brim with the straw
berries and taking them all back to
her room, leaving a couple of token
strawberry rejects for everyone else
to fight over.
This raised a whole bushel of
questions. I know that most people
who aren't me actually like straw
berries, but who likes strawberries
that much? Was she really eating all
of those strawberries in one sitting?
How did she get her strawberry fix
before college? But I thought
about one question the most: what
exactly went through her head
every time she nabbed all the
strawberries? Either she was obliv-

ious to the fact that taking all the
strawberries was a super inconsid
erate thing to do, or she knew and
just didn't care. I've met my fair
share of spacey/oblivious people,
but given how many people were
getting mad about the whole situa
tion, I'd have to imagine that it was
the second case.
To be fair to Strawberry Girl,
and despite what the people who
lived with her might tell you, hoard
ing's not something that she invent
ed. Just last week, I was passing
through Wilbur Dining when I saw
a girl swagger up to a cereal dis
penser with a giant Tupperware jug,
shove its mouth under the dis
penser chute, and hold down on the
dispenser lever. She looked like she
was filling up her car with gas. I'm
not without sin either, I'll admit to
taking an extra candy or two "for
the road," but every time I get
tempted to take much more than
my fair share, a little ditty from
childhood pops into my head.
"There are sC's in Lower

School, that's just the way it is,
Cooperation, Consideration,
Confidence, Concern,
And Courtesy is the last one, it's
there for you and me.
So there you have our sC's, we
hope you'll live them too!"
Despite it not rhyming in the
slightest, it somehow managed to
be incredibly catchy, and that catch
iness, combined with the fact that
we sang it every single week at our
lower school assemblies for five
straight years, burned the sC's into
my brain. Sure, we really shouldn't
need reminding that we should be
being cooperative, considerate, etc.
at our age, and the song is really
only cool for 6-to-10-year-olds (and
even then it's debatable), but see
ing as how there's been tension
over inconsiderate behavior in my
dorms/houses every single year, we
clearly can all still use a little re
minder every once in a while.
Building community in a dorm or a
house isn't always easy, especially
given how many other things Stan
ford students always have going on,
and it becomes close to impossible
if we forget these C's. Things like
cleaning up after ourselves, coming
to dorm/house events, and not
hoarding might seem like silly
things to be worrying about, but it's
these little things that set the tone.
It's fine to do what you want to do,
but it's pretty rare that you'll derive
so much more pleasure from leav
ing that dirty pot on the stove than
from taking a couple of seconds to
wash it out, so why not take those
couple of seconds and make the
house a little nicer for everyone
else? You don't want to be the next
Strawberry Girl, do you?

Confidence, Concern,
And Courtesy is the last one, it's
there for you and me.
So there you have our sC's, we
hope you'll live them too!"
Despite it not rhyming in the
slightest, it somehow managed to
be incredibly catchy, and that catch
iness, combined with the fact that
we sang it every single week at our
lower school assemblies for five
straight years, burned the sC's into
my brain. Sure, we really shouldn't
need reminding that we should be
being cooperative, considerate, etc.
at our age, and the song is really
only cool for 6-to-10-year-olds (and
even then it's debatable), but see
ing as how there's been tension
over inconsiderate behavior in my
dorms/houses every single year, we
clearly can all still use a little re
minder every once in a while.
Building community in a dorm or a
house isn't always easy, especially
given how many other things Stan
ford students always have going on,
and it becomes close to impossible
if we forget these C's. Things like
cleaning up after ourselves, coming
to dorm/house events, and not
hoarding might seem like silly
things to be worrying about, but it's
these little things that set the tone.
It's fine to do what you want to do,
but it's pretty rare that you'll derive
so much more pleasure from leav
ing that dirty pot on the stove than
from taking a couple of seconds to
wash it out, so why not take those
couple of seconds and make the
house a little nicer for everyone
else? You don't want to be the next
Strawberry Girl, do you?
