## EARLY SUPREMACY 
### KEVIN ZHANG DAILY SPORTS INTERN 
After a dominant tournament
performance in Ann Arbor, Mich.,
last month to begin its 2011 cam
paign, the No. 1 Stanford women's
water polo team (4-0) goes into the
two-day Stanford Invitational
looking to continue its strong start
at home.
The team had last weekend off
after the Michigan Kickoff, in
which the Cardinal outscored its
opponents 57-11 to sweep its set of
four games.
During that tournament in Ann
Arbor, the Card stomped over a
gauntlet of top-15 opponents. The
team started by dusting off No. 14
Hartwick, 14-3, and No. 6 Loyola
Marymount, 14-1, on Jan. 22, the
first day of the tourney. The fol
lowing day, the women showed lit
tle signs of fatigue, continuing
their exceptional play in a 14-1
rout of No. 13 Indiana and a 15-6
win over the host school, No. 8
Michigan.
Juniors Pallavi Menon and
Melissa Seidemann combined for
16 goals over the weekend, with
Menon's nine goals marking a
team high. In the cage, all three
Cardinal goalies had playing time,
including sophomore Kate Bal
doni, who totaled 22 saves.
Hie veterans were solid, but the
team enjoyed contributions from
its young talent as well. Freshmen
driver Kaley Dodson was named
MPSF Newcomer of the Week
after racking up six goals during
the tournament, scoring a pair
each against Hartwick, LMU and
Indiana. Sophomore driver Jillian
Garton matched Dodson's six
goals. The two underclassmen are
tied for third on the team in total
scoring, behind Seidemann's

seven and Menon's nine.
The impressive start is a good
omen for a team that narrowly
missed the sport's highest honor
last season. In 2010, Stanford fin
ished one goal shy of a national
championship, falling against
USC, 10-9, and placing second in
the nation for the fifth time in
school history. That team finished
with a 26-3 overall record, includ
ing a perfect 7-0 MPSF record and
a 5-0 mark on the road.
Stanford has begun the 2011

season without recent graduates
Kelly Eaton, Kelsey Holshouser,
Alex Koran and Jessica Steffens.
Eaton, in particular, made a big
mark last year, scoring 51 goals on
the season and a team-high four
goals in the national final against
the Trojans.
Stanford will have plenty of
carryover in the cage, however,
with all three of its goalies Bal
doni and seniors Amber Oland
and Kim Hall returning.
The team will not boast signifi

cant senior experience, with Kim
Krueger joining Oland and Hall as
the only long-time veterans on the
19-player roster.
Despite not being a senior
laden team, Stanford will have a
plethora of talented upperclass
men including juniors Menon, Sei
demann and Cassie Churnside.
Seidemann was the team's leading
scorer last season, knocking in 54
goals.

Driver Kim Krueger is one of only three seniors on the Stanford women's water polo team, but the Cardinal still faces
high expectations as the No. 1 team in the country. This weekend, the Cardinal will host the Stanford Invitational.
As it will this year, Stanford also
went into the 2010 Stanford Invita
tional as the top team in the coun
try. The team managed to win the
tournament for the first time in
seven years by defeating then-No. 4

California, 10-7, in the final.
Stanford will open up against
Arizona State at 8:30 a.m. and Cal
at 4 p.m. on Saturday. The Cardinal
will wrap up on Sunday against San
Jose State at 8 a.m. before a to-be
determined championship match
on Sunday. All matches are at the
Avery Aquatic Center.
