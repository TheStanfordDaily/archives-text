# Plunkett meets HOF precedent
## 
### Wyndam Makowsky Between the lines 
The two weeks between the
conference championship
games and the Super Bowl
are a media frenzy. With lit
tle professional football in
between to cover the Pro Bowl in
no way counts it is a time of bound
less speculation, where stories are fos
tered to keep people interested.
The latest meme: Does a third
Super Bowl ring guarantee Ben
Roethlisberger a spot in the Hall of
Fame? It revolves around nothing ex
cept his literal winning of champi
onships. It's not about his career
much less Super Bowl perform
ance, and certainly not his off-the-field
transgressions. It's simply this: with a
ring, is he in?
The question isn't so crazy, because
the current metrics indicate that, well,
yes, he probably is. Of all of the quarter
backs who have won multiple champi
onships, only one has yet to be elected
to the Hall. This column is about the
merits of those criteria —if we in
stalled my draconian views on Hall of
Fame eligibility, there would likely be
only about two-dozen people en
shrined. Instead, it's about that lone
outsider: Stanford's own Jim Plunkett.
Plunkett, the No. 1 overall pick in
the 1971 draft and the Cardinal's only
Heisman Trophy winner, has two rings,

both won with the Oakland (and then-
Los Angeles) Raiders in the 1980s. He
was stellar in both performances, com
bining for four touchdowns against
zero interceptions and amassing an av
erage 122.8 passer rating. He was the
MVP in Super Bowl XV, and if not for
a superhuman performance from run
ning back Marcus Allen in XVIII, like
ly would have won the honor again.
Contrast that with Roethlisberger,
for instance, who had one of the worst
performances by a winning quarter
back in his first Super Bowl, tossing
two interceptions and no touchdowns
while compiling a paltry 22.6 rating.
Needless to say, Plunkett came
through when it counted. So why no
love from the powers that be?
Plunkett's career was not nearly as
impressive as his Super Bowl perform
ances. He finished with 164 touch
downs against 194 interceptions, went
72-72 in his career, only averaged about
165 yards through the air per game and
had a completion percentage (52.5 per
cent) that modern analysts would scoff
at. Why campaign for him, then, as the
Raiders' owner A1 Davis has begun to
do in recent weeks?
Let's get one aspect out of the way.
In the 19705, when Plunkett was strug
gling early in his career with the woeful
New England Patriots, football was
not nearly as open of a passing game as
it is today, and the stats are skewed ap
propriately. The rules in place back
then were dramatically different from
the ones we have now, which heavily
favor the quarterback and put defend
ers at a serious disadvantage.
But the crux of the matter is that in
the system the NFL currently uses to
select its Hall of Fame quarterbacks, if
you've won multiple Super Bowls you
should have to be significantly worse
over the course of your career than any
other quarterback of the same vein in
order to be excluded. And Plunkett
wasn't.
Joe Namath, whose candidacy is
questioned frequently given his less
than-stellar statistics, made the Hall of
Fame as a one-time Super Bowl cham
pion with career totals of 173 touch
downs, 220 interceptions and a com
pletion percentage right at 50 percent.
He lost more games than he won. He is
in the Hall of Fame. He and Plunkett
overlapped for a number of years in
the pros, and if you normalize their sta
tistics to try and reflect a general aver
age across all eras as Pro Football
Reference's Advanced Passing Statis
tics do then you find that Plunkett

and Namath are within just a couple of
points of each other in the overall rat
ing, and rank quite similarly overall.
(For the record, I side with Broad
way Joe, who followed through on per
haps the greatest and more improbable
guarantee in professional sports history
and almost single-handedly saved the
AFL in the process. But siding with him
is to also side with Plunkett.)
It's not just Namath. Terry Brad
shaw, with four rings, has a similar
score. So do Bob Waterfield and
George Blanda.
Let's not kid ourselves: Plunkett's
career would place him in the bottom
group, statistically, of enshrined quar
terbacks. But he would still be in that
group and not significantly below it.

Reexamine our criteria: if we ac
cept that quarterbacks with multiple
Super Bowl rings will almost always be
elected to the Hall, then the quarter
back with that resume who doesn't
make it in must be dramatically worse
than the rest of that peer group. And
Plunkett is not.
If we're going to discuss Roethlis
berger's candidacy based solely on his
jewelry, then we must continue an erst
while discussion on Plunkett's success,
too.

Wyndam Makowsky would have to be
dramatically worse than other colum
nists not to get your feedback. If he's
not, contact him at makowsky@stan

The two weeks between the
conference championship
games and the Super Bowl
are a media frenzy. With lit
tle professional football in
between to cover the Pro Bowl in
no way counts it is a time of bound
less speculation, where stories are fos
tered to keep people interested.
The latest meme: Does a third
Super Bowl ring guarantee Ben
Roethlisberger a spot in the Hall of
Fame? It revolves around nothing ex
cept his literal winning of champi
onships. It's not about his career
much less Super Bowl perform
ance, and certainly not his off-the-field
transgressions. It's simply this: with a
ring, is he in?
The question isn't so crazy, because
the current metrics indicate that, well,
yes, he probably is. Of all of the quarter
backs who have won multiple champi
onships, only one has yet to be elected
to the Hall. This column is about the
merits of those criteria —if we in
stalled my draconian views on Hall of
Fame eligibility, there would likely be
only about two-dozen people en
shrined. Instead, it's about that lone
outsider: Stanford's own Jim Plunkett.
Plunkett, the No. 1 overall pick in
the 1971 draft and the Cardinal's only
Heisman Trophy winner, has two rings,

both won with the Oakland (and then-
Los Angeles) Raiders in the 1980s. He
was stellar in both performances, com
bining for four touchdowns against
zero interceptions and amassing an av
erage 122.8 passer rating. He was the
MVP in Super Bowl XV, and if not for
a superhuman performance from run
ning back Marcus Allen in XVIII, like
ly would have won the honor again.
Contrast that with Roethlisberger,
for instance, who had one of the worst
performances by a winning quarter
back in his first Super Bowl, tossing
two interceptions and no touchdowns
while compiling a paltry 22.6 rating.
Needless to say, Plunkett came
through when it counted. So why no
love from the powers that be?
Plunkett's career was not nearly as
impressive as his Super Bowl perform
ances. He finished with 164 touch
downs against 194 interceptions, went
72-72 in his career, only averaged about
165 yards through the air per game and
had a completion percentage (52.5 per
cent) that modern analysts would scoff
at. Why campaign for him, then, as the
Raiders' owner A1 Davis has begun to
do in recent weeks?
Let's get one aspect out of the way.
In the 19705, when Plunkett was strug
gling early in his career with the woeful
New England Patriots, football was
not nearly as open of a passing game as
it is today, and the stats are skewed ap
propriately. The rules in place back
then were dramatically different from
the ones we have now, which heavily
favor the quarterback and put defend
ers at a serious disadvantage.
But the crux of the matter is that in
the system the NFL currently uses to
select its Hall of Fame quarterbacks, if
you've won multiple Super Bowls you
should have to be significantly worse
over the course of your career than any
other quarterback of the same vein in
order to be excluded. And Plunkett
wasn't.
Joe Namath, whose candidacy is
questioned frequently given his less
than-stellar statistics, made the Hall of
Fame as a one-time Super Bowl cham
pion with career totals of 173 touch
downs, 220 interceptions and a com
pletion percentage right at 50 percent.
He lost more games than he won. He is
in the Hall of Fame. He and Plunkett
overlapped for a number of years in
the pros, and if you normalize their sta
tistics to try and reflect a general aver
age across all eras as Pro Football
Reference's Advanced Passing Statis
tics do then you find that Plunkett

and Namath are within just a couple of
points of each other in the overall rat
ing, and rank quite similarly overall.
(For the record, I side with Broad
way Joe, who followed through on per
haps the greatest and more improbable
guarantee in professional sports history
and almost single-handedly saved the
AFL in the process. But siding with him
is to also side with Plunkett.)
It's not just Namath. Terry Brad
shaw, with four rings, has a similar
score. So do Bob Waterfield and
George Blanda.
Let's not kid ourselves: Plunkett's
career would place him in the bottom
group, statistically, of enshrined quar
terbacks. But he would still be in that
group and not significantly below it.

Reexamine our criteria: if we ac
cept that quarterbacks with multiple
Super Bowl rings will almost always be
elected to the Hall, then the quarter
back with that resume who doesn't
make it in must be dramatically worse
than the rest of that peer group. And
Plunkett is not.
If we're going to discuss Roethlis
berger's candidacy based solely on his
jewelry, then we must continue an erst
while discussion on Plunkett's success,
too.
