## Top-ranked women's swimming continues home dominance 
### —Jacob Jaffe 
Stanford women's swimming
won its 33rd consecutive dual
meet, and 22nd straight at home,
as the Cardinal dispatched of
ranked UCLA and USC teams
over the weekend.
The No. 1 Cardinal (8-0),
whose seniors will now end their
careers with a perfect home
record, first took on No. 21
UCLA on Friday. Of the 16
events, Stanford won 10 on its
way to a 169-131 win. Leading
the way for the Cardinal was jun
ior Sam Woodward, who won
the 50-yard freestyle and con
tributed to wins by both relay
teams. Woodward anchored the
200 medley relay and led off the
200 free relay, along with placing
third in the 100 butterfly.
The only other Stanford
swimmer with multiple victories
in the meet was freshman Felicia
Lee, who showed her versatility
with wins in both the 100 back
stroke and the 100 free, as well as
the butterfly leg in the winning
medley relay.
Senior Meg Hostage won
both diving events for the Cardi
nal, and freshman Stephanie
Phipps placed second and third
in the one-meter and three
meter, respectively.
Stanford did not have much
time to enjoy its victory, though,
as it had an even tougher task
the very next day. Once again,
the Cardinal was up to the chal
lenge, easily defeating No. 3
USC, 161.5-136.5, to cap off its
home season.
Two of Stanford's five seniors
had particularly strong perform
ances in their final collegiate
home match. Hostage once again
swept the two diving events, while
Phipps placed third in both. Se
nior Kate Dwelley also had quite
a day, winning the 100 and 200
free and anchoring the exhibition
400 free relay win. Dwelley fin
ished .03 seconds behind Wood
ward in the 50 free as well, barely
missing out on another victory.
The Cardinal's best event of
the day was the 200 backstroke,
which "Stanford swept. Freshman
Maya Dißado won the event, fol
lowed by sophomores Jessie
Hammes and Megan Fischer-Col
brie. Dißado also won the 100
backstroke, placed second in the
200IM and led off a second-place
finish in the 200 medley relay.
Stanford has a diving-only
meet at BYU on Feb. 11, fol
lowed by a full meet at Califor
nia on Feb. 12 before the Pac-10
Championships in late February.
