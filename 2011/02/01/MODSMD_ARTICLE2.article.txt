# Gaieties controversy continues
## Forum produces dialogue in wake of Ujamaa walk-out of annual Ram's Head production 
### BRENDAN O'BYRNE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
At a forum held last night in Roble Hall,
members of the Stanford community gath
ered to discuss this year's Gaieties perform
ance, the student-run production put on by the
Ram's Head Theatrical Society the week be
fore Big Game.
The meeting was in response to the contro
versy surrounding Gaieties last year, and cen
tered on the walkout of 32 Ujamaa residents
during the performance. The forum sought to
foster dialogue and was open to the public.
The town hall, described by Ram's Head as a
mea culpa, was headed by Olivia Haas 'll and
Michael Rooney 'll, both members of the
board of directors of Ram's Head.
While acknowledging the hard work of the
Gaieties staff, Ram's Head executives also
said the play was "plagued by a lack of over
sight" and suffered from "a failure of respon
sibility."
Haas began the meeting on an apologetic
note, saying it was a regrettable and embar
rassing situation.
"We see the issue this year as starting with
the board's lack of oversight that we are sup
posed to exercise," she said, adding that the
board of directors should have been more in
volved in the writing process.
While Haas noted that the members of
Gaieties harbored no ill will in writing this
year's play, she acknowledged that, "regard
less of the intent, the impact was that harm was
caused. That's what matters and that's what
we are here to address, acknowledge, and ac
cept."
Following opening statements from
Rooney and Haas, the floor was opened to
members of the panel and audience to ask
questions or make statements regarding the
future purpose and content of Gaieties.
One commenter noted that Gaieties
sought to address stereotypes that already
exist by lampooning them in an over-the-top
manner. Ujamaa RA Yvorn Aswad-Thomas
'll disagreed with the effectiveness of Gai
eties in this regard.

"Of all the opportunities to discuss these is
sues and analyze these divisive stereotypes,
why do we choose the series of nights when we
are supposed to be bringing campus togeth
er?" he asked. "Just putting images up without
discussing or getting into it, we fall short of the
goal of tearing these stereotypes down."
One of the most commonly suggested im

provements was that Gaieties approach mem
bers of different community centers on cam
pus to elicit feedback about their production.
Haas agreed, also suggesting that a panel of
different student groups read over the script
and watch rehearsals. She emphasized, how
ever, that the groups would be responsible for
providing feedback and not have editorial

control.
In one of the tensest moments of the night,
an audience member accused Gaieties of "bla
tant sexism, racism, and homophobia," a
charge that went unchallenged by members of
Gaieties staff and members of Ram's Head.

Ram's Head Theatrical Society, the group that produces Gaieties, held a forum last night in response to the controversy that arose from this fall's
performance. Ram's Head executives said this year's play was "plagued by a lack of oversight."
When asked about the state
ment, Haas said in an interview with
The Daily after the forum that she
agreed with the statement. She clar
ified that while there were tones of
racism, sexism and homophobia,
"there was absolutely no intent to
be hurtful by any member of Gai
eties staff."
Haas also noted that all of the
potential producers for next year
were in attendance at the meeting,
which she said showed that Gaieties
will be better moving forward.
Moving forward was an impor
tant theme for Aswad-Thomas as

well. He said that he was happy with
the talk, especially because it
marked the start of a much bigger
movement.
"I saw this as the beginning of a
process that all parties involved
wanted to be a part of, to address the
points of hurt and to look towards
improving things," Aswad-Thomas
said in an interview with The Daily
after the discussion. "One of the
most important things is people re
alizing there's no one Stanford.
"If Gaieties can do a better job
including all of the different experi
ences we've all had here at Stan
ford, it will be a lot more compre
hensive, a lot funnier, and much bet
ter," he added.
