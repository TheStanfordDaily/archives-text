## 100K Cheeks and Stanford Blood Center to host bone marrow drive today 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€”Joshua Falk 
100K Cheeks and the Stanford Blood
Center are set to host a blood and bone mar
row drive today from 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. at Stan

ford Hospital & Clinics.
Graduate School of Business professor
Jennifer Aaker, who works with 100K
Cheeks, is using social media to encourage
South Asians to enroll in the National Bone
Marrow Registry.
"Social media is not inherently mean
ingful," Aaker said in an interview with
the School of Medicine's Scope blog.
"Yet the power of social technology,
when fully engaged, can be nothing short

of revolutionary."
Using social media to augment the num
ber of registered is one such "revolutionary"
application. Stanford students launched
100K Cheeks last November and aims to
sign up 100,000 people on the registry within
a year. The organization hopes that at least
80 percent of registered donors will be of
South Asian descent.
