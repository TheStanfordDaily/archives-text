### ANGELIQUE DAKKAK 
Mohr Visiting Poet Stephen Dobyns gave a
reading last night in Cubberley Auditorium.
Dobyns, who received fellowships from the
Guggenheim Foundation and the National En
dowment for the Arts, read poems that ex
plored human condition, the passage of time
and the questioning of meaning.
Dobyns, has taught at the University of lowa
and Boston University, holds an M.F.A. from
the University of lowa. He has published ten
books of poetry and twenty novels.
He began with a comedic yet cynical poem
entitled "The Gardner." Written before the fall
of the Berlin Wall, it explores human flaw and
the ease with which humans are convinced
wrong.
The next poem that Dobyns read, "How to
Like It," was a dark yet comedic dialogue be
tween a dog and a man. The dog is character-

ized as living an escapist life, while
the man desires to confront his dif
ficulties and past through constant
reflection.
The dog attempts to distract the
man with idle actions and eventual
ly succeeds in breaking the man's
reflection. The poem highlights an
other failure by man to achieve his
full potential. Despite the dark na
ture of the poem, the audience
picked up on Dobyns' humor.
Communication and the impact
made by its absence were central
themes in Dobyns' reading.
"Tenderly," the third poem read

by Dobyns, approached this theme
in a light-humored, graphic way
that was simultaneously disturbing
and comedic. In the poem, the pro
tagonist attempts to dismember
himself with a butter knife in order
to assuage his frustration. The way
he chooses to articulate his pain
contrasts with the reactions of
those who witness his disturbing
act, juxtaposing communication
through action and communication
through observation.
While "Stars" and "Morning
Doves" also address the issue of
communication in a humorous
way, their tone was heavy.
"Stars" narrates a husband and
wife's long journey to a friend's
home. As the couple gets increas
ingly lost on their trip, the wife be
comes frustrated and ceases to

speak. Soon, both become filled
with critical, negative thoughts of
each other.
They consider the possibility of
divorce, but forget their conflict once
they find their way. The effects of si
lence are portrayed as a force that
overdramatizes reactions and cre
ates false thoughts. They highlight
the importance of communication.
"His style of writing is really
straight forward and easy to under
stand," said Sharia Mayfield 'l3,
who attended the reading. "A lot of
the meaning of the poetry came
from his tone of voice."
Mayfield also noted that
Dobyns' readings encompassed a
wide variety of poetic genres.
