## NMB protests potential return of ROTC to Farm Group cites violation of non-discrimination policy 
### DANA EDWARDS 
The National Marriage Boycott (NMB) a
group founded at Stanford to protest marriage
discrimination in the wake of Proposition 8
is spearheading a national effort to prevent the
return of ROTC at certain colleges.
The youth-led organization has more than
15,000 members and encourages college ac
tivism by providing an established support net
work across campuses.
Although the repeal of "don't ask, don't tell"
(DADT) in December ended the ban on gay
and lesbian soldiers from serving openly in the
military, transgender individuals are still ex
cluded from service. NMB opposes the return
of ROTC to college campuses whose non-dis
crimination clauses apply to transgender indi
viduals, on the basis that the ban violates those
legal clauses.
Stanford, Columbia and Harvard are three
universities with such non-discrimination claus
es. NMB is focusing much of its efforts on these
campuses.
"What we're working on right now with
NMB is to create material to disseminate to
other college campuses so that they can wage
some large campaigns, or begin to think critical
ly about their own ROTC campaigns at their
own schools," said Alok Vaid-Menon 'l3, NMB
publicity and communications director.
Vaid-Menon sees the ROTC debate as a lu
crative opportunity to raise awareness about
transgender discrimination.
"I really see the role of NMB in the debate as
a reminder to a lot of LGBTQ people that it's
important not to forget about trans people,"
Vaid-Menon said. "A lot of the time, the T gets
left out of LGBTQ."
Vaid-Menon and other mem
bers of the NMB saw the repeal of
DADT as a huge victory for
LGBTQ rights, but was frustrated
by President Obama's State of the
Union speech last week, in which he
said, "starting this year, no Ameri
can will be forbidden from serving
the country they love because of
who they love."
This statement was made hand
in-hand with Obama's call for col
lege campuses to bring back ROTC
on the basis that LGBTQ discrimi
nation had ended.
For Vaid-Menon and others,
Obama's remark brought a sense of
disillusionment.

"We felt very disenfranchised,
and we immediately created a na
tional petition," Vaid-Menon said.
"The White House had forgotten
about trans people, and Obama was
simply lobbying for political inter
est. He was being strategic, but in
the process [was] ignoring a group
of people who are stilled barred
from military service."
The petition, issued in conjunction
with Stanford Students for Queer
Liberation (SSQL), was forwarded
via e-mail earlier last weekend.
"Tell President Obama that the
military is not an open or affirming
institution as the State of the Union
address would have us believe,"
NMB education director and SSQL
leader Janani Balasubramanian 'l2
wrote in the appeal.
Vaid-Menon mentioned that
while most of its efforts are focused
on student involvement, NMB also
pursues other venues, such as corn

municating with certain members
of the military and collaborating
with other national LGBTQ-rights
organizations.
SSQL has also been prominent
in coordinating campus events and
facilitating debate about the pro
posed return of ROTC to Stanford.
Next month, SSQL plans to hold
"Transgender Awareness Week"
from Feb. 28 to Mar. 4.
"With NMB, I'm trying to work
with sensitive people in the military
to get them to recognize that dis
crimination is arcane and not really
necessary anymore, and encourage
a lot of people to lobby the military
to try to change it," Vaid-Menon
said.
NMB also provides financial as
sistance to its college branches, and
it has backing from Get Equal, a
San Francisco-based LGBTQ ad
vocacy group, and the National
Center for Transgender Equality.

Vaid-Menon plans to implement
a monthly conference call between
NMB activists at schools nation
wide to formulate new ideas for
their platform.
"In the end, the effort is really
about gaining wide support and
media attention," Vaid-Menon said.
The group is gradually becoming
more visible. Vaid-Menon was re
cently quoted in a New York Times
article for his work with NMB, the
first time the group's ROTC objec
tion was publicized nationally.
"If Harvard, Columbia, Stanford
were to make a decision not to re
turn ROTC to campus on the basis
of transgender exclusion, the sheer
cultural capital of that would help
effectively prove to the military
that it needs to change," Vaid-
Menon said.
