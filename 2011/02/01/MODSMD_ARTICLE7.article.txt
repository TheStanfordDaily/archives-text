## HERE COMES THE SUN? Students, faculty shed light on the dreaded "winter slump" 
### MARWA FARAG DESK EDITOR 
Unfortunately, winter
quarter at Stanford
is not just fun-filled
Lake Tahoe ski trips
and cozy North Face
jackets. Year after year, the ten
week period between winter and
spring breaks has a tendency to
bring with it the dreaded "winter
slump," the Stanford undergrad
uate equivalent to the couch po
tato syndrome.
Colder temperatures, tough
coursework, social inertia, de
pleted stocks of NyQuil and tis
sues and generally lower morale
all leave their marks on students'
experiences in the school year's
middle quarter, depressing
moods to the extent that even
playing the age-old cure for win
ter blues, the Beatles' "Here
Comes the Sun" on repeat, can't
brighten up a rainy day.
Yet many students believe
that the winter slump is only a
myth, a "self-perpetuated psy
chological thing that's not really
that pertinent," in the words of
Otero resident assistant Harry
Spitzer'l2.
Little darling, it's been a long,
cold, lonely winter
Winter quarter heralds both a
drop on the temperature scale
and a change in pace.
"It's not like, all of a sudden,
misery," said Otero Resident Fel
low Clifford Nass, "but winter
quarter is sort of a down time,
and the weather has a lot to do
with it."
Otero peer health educator
Elise Gibbs 'l2 agreed.
"We're so used to it being so
nice out that when it's cold and
we have to change our lifestyle,
we get a little stir crazy," she said.
"Having less hours of daylight
and being colder has a bit of a
constricting effect," Director of
Wellness and Health Promotion
Services Carol Pertofsky said.
"We go through certain changes
biologically. The shifts in light
patterns have an effect on our
body rhythms."
According to Pertofsky, this
biological change translates to a
slower pace.
"Students who understand
that winter is a quieter time, that
nature has got us built so that we
need to slow down and sleep
more, do fine. Winter is a time to
be peaceful and calm, to sink into

a different gear."
Few will argue that dreary
weather doesn't manifest itself in
cranky attitudes, especially when
coupled with illnesses.
"People are already a little
more tired, a little more cranky
in winter, and if you're not feel
ing 100 percent, then that con
tributes to those two," Spitzer
said.
Pertofsky and Spitzer are
wary, however, of explaining
away depressed attitudes through
weather alone.
"You can say to yourself, 'This
is a darker time of the year, but I
am going to focus on the good
and make a point of noticing
good things in my day and being
engaged with them,"' Pertofsky
said.
She warned against settling
for unhappiness, saying, "When
students are feeling blue, they
feel stuck but there's a lot of sci
ence that shows there are prac
tices we can do to help ourselves
feel happier."
In other words, while the
weather might get students
down, it only takes a little effort
to get that back up.
Spitzer echoed this view.
"There's nothing inherently
wrong with winter quarter. It's
just another phase of the year,"
he said.
Little darling, it feels like years
since it's been here
Stanford's quarter system
also seems to play a part in the
winter slump.
"There's a cycle to the quar
ters," said Lourdes Andrade, As
sistant Director at Undergradu
ate Advising and Research. "In
autumn, people come back re
freshed. They still have that ener
gy. Winter quarter is that sand
wiched quarter where students
are starting to get a little bit more
run-down."
"Spring is tiring, but they can
see the light of the end of the tun
nel," she added.
The long stretch of winter and
spring quarters, separated only
by one week of vacation, can be
taxing.
"That one week of spring
break never feels like enough,"
Serra RF Ross Shachter said.
Nathanial Williams 'l3 had a
similar opinion.
"You come back from winter
break and realize that there are
