# COLOGICAL EXPLORER

### BILLY GALLAGHER 
Among the wide array of
books, stacked papers
and coffee cups, Profes
sor Harold Mooney's
office is littered with
more prestigious awards than can
be counted.
But above the professorial trin
kets and the plethora of awards, it is
the large map of the world covering
the entire wall behind his desk that
tells the most about Mooney, his
work and the indirect path that he
took to reach his current position as
the Paul S.Achilles Professor of En
vironmental Biology and FSI Se
nior Fellow at Stanford.
Mooney credited early back
packing trips to the Sierra Nevada
Mountains and working in nurs
eries in high school as the initial de

velopments of his interest in ecosys
tems and the field of biology.
"I gained an appreciation for the
variety of life on earth ... all the
pretty things," he laughed. "Why we
have so many things, how they inter
act and work and how we can un
derstand where they are, where
they grow. And now, more and more
in recent years, concern for the loss
of diversity and what we can do
about stopping some of the adverse
trends."

Despite this appreciation,
Mooney's life plans did not immedi
ately revolve around the life sci
ences, and the high school student
body president instead accepted a
scholarship to enter the University
of California at Berkeley as a polit
ical science major. But when finan
cial woes hit soon after, he was
forced to drop out of school and get

a job.
He accepted a position on a
Norwegian freighter and embarked
upon a journey down the west coast
of the Americas, through the Straits
of Magellan, along the east coast of
South America, back through the
Panama Canal and on to San Fran
cisco.
Unbeknownst to him at the
time, this seemingly odd job would
provide the inspiration for his life's
work.
While traveling through the
Panama Canal, Mooney read an ar
ticle in Reader's Digest that de
scribed working for the United
States Department of Agriculture's
Plant Exploration unit. This article,
combined with the variety of natu
ral wonders he saw in his trip
throughout the Americas, fostered
a deep interest in biology.
With that, both his political sci
ence degree and Berkeley career
were things of the past. Upon re
turning to the States, Mooney de
cided to go back to school at his
local community college, where a
field course on ecology in the
Rocky Mountains convinced him
that his calling was to become an
ecologist.
Mooney noted that his personal
intellectual journey has led him to
place a strong value on academic
exploration.
"I think it's really important to
test the waters and to take a broad
array of courses that first year," he
said." It just depends. Some people
see something early in their careers
and go on to it for the rest of their
lives. For other people, it takes a
while to find their passion."

"That's what you're looking for,
something you can become pas
sionate about," he added. "And you
have to find that out by experi
menting."
Experimenting has paid off for
Mooney, who has found away to
combine his early interest in politi
cal science with his aptitude in ecol
ogy to enact change in the world of
environmental policy. For the past
five years, he has been working with
the United Nations to establish an
intergovernmental process that fol
lows biological diversity globally,
similar to the Intergovernmental
Panel for Climate Change (IPCC).
Called the Intergovernmental Plat
form on Biodiversity and Ecosys
tem Services (IPBES), the resolu
tion has already been approved by
93 governments.
At Stanford, Mooney has en
joyed his role as both a teacher and
researcher. His current courses in
clude an introductory seminar
called "Plants and Civilization" as
well as a junior-senior course enti
tled "Ecosystems of California."
Driven by a strong belief that
the scientific community must im
prove its ability to share findings
with the public at large, Mooney
also works with several organiza
tions that help scientists further
their communication skills. At
Stanford, he is deeply involved with
a program that trains young scien
tists to communicate via television,
write op-eds and provide effective
Congressional testimony.
"I think all scientists have an obli
gation to convey their findings to a
larger community than their immedi
ate peers," Mooney said, "and to use
their understanding and knowledge
about an important issue and make it
available to a wider audience."

the scientific community must im
prove its ability to share findings
with the public at large, Mooney
also works with several organiza
tions that help scientists further
their communication skills. At
Stanford, he is deeply involved with
a program that trains young scien
tists to communicate via television,
write op-eds and provide effective
Congressional testimony.
"I think all scientists have an obli
gation to convey their findings to a
larger community than their immedi
ate peers," Mooney said, "and to use
their understanding and knowledge
about an important issue and make it
available to a wider audience."
