## I HAVE TWO HEADS All Roads Lead to Rome? 
### Rachel Kolb 
Neither here nor there: that
sums up my feelings about
returning to Stanford after
studying abroad. I had been eager
to return to campus, and my fall
quarter had been dotted with wist
ful visions of sun and palm trees
even as I enjoyed traipsing across
Europe. But once I got my first
glimpse of Campus Drive in
months, unsettling feelings of dis
junction crept in. It was a question
I'd thought I'd settled during my
freshman year, but now it arose in
new ways: was Stanford really the
place for me?
Now, from my perspective, this
experience was not altogether un
expected. Nor, really, does it seem
unusual. Several of my friends ex
pressed similar feelings of discon
nect after their abroad experiences
last year, and probably expressed it
best by saying they felt troubled at
how well Stanford had carried on
without them. Once, they might
have been dependent on their cam
pus-oriented world, their structure
of friends, classes and activities, but
that world did not return the favor.
It was perfectly capable of continu
ing on its own, thank you.
It strikes me that the feeling of
returning to a familiar, yet changed
place is one of physically encoun
tering our memories. Old convic
tions and emotions greet us along
the way, remnants from the people
we were then, and we find our
selves at an ambiguous crossroads.
We can either embrace our differ
ent, present selves, or allow that by
gone world to envelop us again. In
the end, it seems like we actually
do neither. We are always renegoti
ating the ground on which we
stand. And that stark impression of
renegotiation, of uncertainty,
rather than the illusion of continu
ity that extended time in the same
place gives us, seems to be what un
derlies my feelings of removal.
"Tell me all about Oxford!" my
friends exclaim, as I insist to know
the same about their fall. But how
much of what we say to each other
is just a reinterpretation, taken
from our present lens of self? In
the end, I walk away realizing how
far five thousand miles really is.
Realizing how much I missed, and
how little.
Those memories we encounter
sometimes surface as ghosts, more
vivid than ever because of the in
tervening time of change. Lately, I
have been feeling the ghosts of my
first two years on campus: places I
used to live, people I used to see. At
the same time, I have felt the ghosts
of my time abroad, which surface

in the form of sensory details or
moments of longing: sitting in a
class and suddenly remembering
that day, that building, that slant of
light that doesn't exist in sunny
California. Or thinking, wait, now
I'm in America. This place is just
one possibility out of millions.
It seems to me that discovering
the multiple possibilities that exist
outside of Stanford is what the
abroad experience is all about.
Meeting new friends and learning
about a foreign country are part of
the journey, but we return to the
Farm understanding that we are
less dependent on our immediate
surroundings than we might have
believed. We have a center of self
that can adapt to new circum
stances better than we might have
expected. We find that we have the
strength to change and to discover
new possibilities. At its core, this
realization can be as simple as:
Hey, I survived. What's next?
Realigning my perspective this
way, I feel more optimistic, less dis
jointed, less concerned about the
future and the shadows that lurk
there. During my first month back
on campus, I've realized that Stan
ford might not be the place for me,
for no such place exists. Rather,
Stanford is a place, a possibility for
me to shape after my expanding vi
sion of the world. Clinging to this
interpretation, I feel liberated.
Even while living in the campus
bubble rather than the "real
world," there is no saying that we
can't embrace new possibilities
and make the same mundane situ
ations feel radically different. For
me, it took going to Oxford to real
ize how dynamic my identity is, and
how much I can alter in my every
day world. I can transport myself to
new surroundings, but to achieve
real satisfaction I need to give part
of myself back to those places,
wherever they might be.
At the beginning of this quarter,
I was afraid I was returning to the
same old Stanford. But I'm not. I
don't have to, and neither do any of
us.
