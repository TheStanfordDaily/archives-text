How I Write: A Conversation with Nancy Packer
Nancy Packer has published six books. Small Moments received the
Commonwealth Club of California Award for fiction and is called "moving,
amusing, touching, and even frightening." In My Father's House is a nonfiction
work in stories about Packer's growing up among boisterous siblings and a
strong-willed father who was a member of Congress. The Women Who Walk
chronicles the lives of women in midlife travails; as one critic said, "It's hard
to see how these stories could be better." Packer's stories have been widely
anthologized, including in O. Henry Prize Stories and Best American Stories.
Packer was a professor in the Stanford English Department, teaching creative
writing, and received both the Dinkelspiel Award and the Dean's Award for
excellence in teaching. Twice she served on the Pulitzer Selection Committee
for fiction.
