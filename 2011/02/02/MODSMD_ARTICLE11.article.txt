## Something just clicks 
### ALIZA ROSEN 
If you're afraid to raise your hand
in lecture, have no fear. Now you
just have to push a button.
Thanks to Personal Response
Systems (PRS) clickers, tools
that allow students to submit answers
to practice problems posed in lecture,
students are gaining a different learn
ing experience in big lectures. Though
they are only present in specific classes
at Stanford, PRS clickers may become
more visible on campus as research
continues to show their effectiveness.
"I love the PRS system. It breaks
up the lecture into check points and
makes me feel confident that I'm
keeping up with everything that was
just discussed something which is
vital in a large lecture classroom," said
Alex Ritchie 'l4, a student in Chem
istry 318.
Recently, PRS clickers have been
appearing in classrooms all over the
country. Professors at schools such as
Harvard, Vanderbilt, Northwestern,
Ohio State and the University of Ari
zona have been implementing PRS use
into the format of their lectures as away
to assess the overall understanding and
progress of students. PRS clickers allow
students to engage in large lecture class
es where they might feel like one
among many, and in general, both pro
fessors and students approve.
Chemistry 318 professor Jennifer
Schwartz is seeing the benefits of the
devices in her large classes.
"If you walk into a lecture hall dur
ing a clicker question, you will under
stand instantly why clickers can make
a substantial difference in the amount
of student engagement in a large lec
ture," Schwartz said. "Instead of stu
dents struggling to stay awake, you
find 200 students thinking and talking
about an important Chemistry con
cept."
Schwartz believes that the impor
tance of the PRS lies not in whether
the student answers the question cor
rectly, but rather in the student's real
ization of his or her own confusion.
"The fact that a student has strug
gled with that material, even for a few
seconds, is helpful to their learning
process," she added. "If they got the
question wrong, it helps them to iden
tify what misconception they might
have had about a problem."
Ritchie agreed that using her PRS
clicker is a red flag for material she
doesn't understand.
"Clickers help me learn because
they identify the little things I may
have missed," Ritchie said. "After a
PRS response, the professor reviews
the question with the class. It gets you
thinking about how well you're under
standing the material, and helps if
you're confused because you get to
discuss the question with friends
around you."
Katie Topper 'l4 said that PRS
clickers also force students to stay en
gaged, particularly in her Physics 41

lecture.
"Clickers really help because they
make you think and work out a prob
lem, instead of just listening to the con
cept from the lecturer," she said.
In addition to administering prac
tice problems, PRS clickers also pres
ent a unique opportunity for profes
sors to get almost instant feedback

about their classes' level of com
prehension. If students don'*
understand a concept, the
professor can gauge this
through analyzing PRS
responses and the"
tailor the lecture to
address a specific j
problem area. "
Though its main

pu T ose iS oof? f
students, a PRS click-
er is also away lor

professors to see
which students are consistently at
tending lecture. In Chemistry 318, 50
points of the final grade [MBljare cal
culated from PRS responses, provid
ing students a large incentive to attend
classes.
"PRS clickers make people go to
lecture, since their responses are
recorded," said Hunter Kodama 'l4,
another Chemistry 318 student. "And
even if the owners aren't present in
class, their PRS clickers are."
Ritchie also pointed out that the
format of the clicker response system
highlights the key concepts of a lec
ture.
"PRS questions are timed, so you

have to pick out the main points of the
problem quickly," Ritchie said. "With
the time constraint, you are forced to
realize quickly what the most impor
tant points are."
But not all professors have hopped
onto the PRS clicker bandwagon. Al
though Marcelo Clerici- Arias, profes-

sor of Economics IA, thinks that
clickers can enhance lectures,
he also finds their use some-
V what limiting.
f "The employment of click
' ers is constrained to multiple
choice questions, or sometimes
numerical questions," he said.
"Text-based questions are very diffi
cult to implement with clickers, and of
course, graphs are impossible."
Though he has used PRS clickers
for the past nine years in his introduc
tory Economics classes, Clerici-Arias
recently decided to remove them
from his lectures. Starting this quarter,
he is trying out a program called
"Ãœbiquitous Presenter," which is soft
ware that allows multiple choice, text,
image and ink entries from students.
Though it does offer a wider variety
of response options, the software is not
without flaws.
"It opens up the issue of computer
misuse in the classroom and the possi
bility of online distractions," Clerici-
Arias noted, suggesting that PRS
clickers may not be leaving the Stan
ford classroom anytime soon.
