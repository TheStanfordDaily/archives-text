## REALITY CHECK Realistic sizes for real people 
### Alex Hicks-Nelson 
I'm having myself a nice leisurely
stroll through the bookstore on
yet another Wednesday after
noon. Oh, a book I won't have time
to read. How lovely. A tourist fever
ishly capturing each and every avail
able proton ricocheting off the sou
venir shot glasses. Priceless. As I
weave in and out of visitors looking
bemusedly about and my fellow stu
dents searching for this and that
amenity it finally strikes me that
I've never once purchased my own
Stanford apparel. In truth, I've tried
many times and continually block
out the horrific embarrassment of
attempting to "try on" anything in
the arm-pinching, boob-strangling,
tummy-itching women's section.
With the wanton abandon charac
teristic of so many trips prior, I skip
(walk with vigor) up the stairs and
mosey over to my designated side.
I have no idea what the Stanford
bookstore assumes women look like
when it orders its apparel. I'd imag
ine a flat-chested, hipless individual,
devoid of biceps, sans organs, ribless
and on the whole subsisting on
dreams and sparse foliage. I can only
guess they picture a five-inch
nymphish little thing, maybe with an
oversized hat or a hipster scarf,
maybe just a prepubescent boy who
enjoys v-necks. For the record, I
don't have anything against prepu
bescent boys, or the willowy girls
who drift here and there in the stiff
breezes of our quaint Farm. If there
were a section for petites and a sec
tion for non-petites, and a section
for talis or wides or what have you, I
would be perfectly content to share
the second floor in perfect harmony.
Sadly, it seems my entire shop
ping experience is dictated by these
exceptions to the norm. The medi
um looks remarkably like the small,
the small like the kids' large, and so
it goes on down the line. Sure, I
could get a 2X, strap some sticks to
myself and fashion a yurt, but for
bookstore prices I might as well
make do without. What is so difficult
about a large? Maybe I'm a bit bi
ased as a New Yorker, but I see no
rhyme or reason for a women's sec
tion without tops allowing for actual
shoulders. Actual waists. Actual

breasts. While I'm a big fan of t
shirts, I'm an even bigger fan of
clothes that fit correctly. Some tees
have that unflattering unisex
straight edge from armpit to hem,
some have a massive swath of cleav
age, none fit correctly at the bust and
all of them are too short. Glaring
around at the little people flitting
here and there, I muse on who for
got that the torso occasionally
lengthens as the subject's height in
creases.
Dejected, I usually find myself
offering apologetic, sheepish smirks
to passers-by. Oh, I wasn't actually
looking for anything for me. Six-foot
girls don't actually exist; I'm hiding
my male genitalia elsewhere. I pre
tend I have a little sibling and make
appraising sounds and gestures at
the baby clothes ... Then realize I
might be mistaken for someone's
parent and quickly hide in the hats
section. It is an odd thing, turning
this way and that, imagining my
ribcage somehow shrunken and my
shoulders dislocated to accommo-

date some stupid shirt, but it is just
another of those treats I will proba
bly never indulge in at Stanford. I'm
doomed to the basement, shopping
once or twice every quarter. The
men's section is alluring, of course,
and an easy remedy. If I'm going to
get something oversized, at least let
it be a sweet looking sweater and
baggy pants to wear when every sin
gle other piece is in the wash. But
why do I have to? Why can't I strut
my stuff with every other five-foot
wonder in the ladies' section? Why
can't I shop for my equally normal
sized relatives at the bookstore?
And why can't I even find a hat that
fits?

Alex is wondering whether yurts will be
in style anytime soon. E-mail her your
