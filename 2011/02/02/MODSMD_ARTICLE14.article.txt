						waffle kurfuffle, or: How the heck can't you people figure this out? 
### Robin Thomas 
r | nothing quite as awful
As the beeping of a waffle
Iron when I am still waking,
Thinking only about making
My little bowl of Lucky Charms.
And those stupid, shrill alarms
Echo round the dining hall
Trying frantically to call
To that foolish, careless student
Who's so hopelessly imprudent
They'll let their waffle be neglected.
And I'd really have expected
Any person not rejected
From this school to have detected
That on each iron is projected
The steps by which waffles are con
fected.
But each day I see some flake

They admitted by mistake
Pouring too much batter on the grid
Then closing up the iron's lid
And standing with a frightened
stare
As the iron's screaming fills the air.
Look, you morons, here's the deal
For making waffles without the
squeal:
First, with the can of oil spray,
Mist the iron from six inches away.
You need just one and one half
scoops of batter
And how you pour it doesn't matter
'Cause it spreads out even on the
iron's face
(Over that much drips all over the
place.
And don't add sliced banana or
chocolate chips

Or the waffle burns and easily rips.)
Now shut the iron. You'll hear the
sound
Of it wailing to be turned upside
down.
So grab its handles, and to make it
stop.
Twist them to flip the bottom to the
top.
The iron will go quiet, and you
should see
Its clock count down from 2:45 or
3:00.
But for the love of ah that's fair and
just
Don't leave your waffle unless you
must
For when the clock hits zero, then
The dumb machine will scream
again.

And with each beep, I swear it's
written
God kills a cute and fuzzy kitten.
So with one second left, or two or
three,
Flip it back over to how it used to
be.
Lift the lid, and with a fork pull
down
What should be perfectly golden
brown

And should fall cleanly on to your
plate,
Embossed even with Stanford's
seal.
Add cream and strawberries for the
perfect meal.
So do it right, each breakfast and
brunch,
For each beep you let slip equals a
punch
To your karma, and could take
years off your life
When you're stabbed by a pissed
diner's butter knife.

Hey, waffle kurfuffler, are you mad
Robin called you a moron? Hopeful
ly, you're not, but contact him with
