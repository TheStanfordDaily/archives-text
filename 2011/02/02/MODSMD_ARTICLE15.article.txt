## Tennis Anyone? 
### CHRISSY JONES 
After knocking off Florida, 4-3, at the
NCAA Division I Women's Tennis Cham
pionship last May, Stanford earned its first
title since 2006 and proved that it could
once again reign as the top women's tennis
program in the NCAA.
Starting off this season ranked No. 1, Stanford (3-0,
0-0 Pac-10) lost just one player to graduation, but added
four fiery freshmen Kristie Ahn, Nicole Gibbs, Eliz
abeth Ecker and Amelia Herring to its roster.
Unique and brilliant in their own ways, meet Stan
ford's newest forces on the court.
Nicole Gibbs began her tennis career when she was
7 years old and by age 11, had won her first national
title. Growing up in Santa Monica, Calif., Gibbs faced
the difficult choice of attending college or joining the
pro circuit after graduation.
Gibbs said her high school experience was very dif
ferent from the average student.
"Tennis shortened my high school career because 1
skipped 10th grade," she said. "On average, I missed
about 40 days per year, but it was worth it."
Gibbs describes one of her strengths as problem
solving.
"I love competition, so I take a lot of pride in my abil
ity to outthink my opponents," Gibbs remarked. She
said her biggest ambition is to "Compete at the largest
venues and hopefully achieve a top-50 professional
ranking. I do wish to enjoy an education, college tennis
and a social life before braving it on the tour."
"Andrew Luck couldn't help but be inspired by my
pursuit of a balanced college life," she jokingly added. "I
won't call him a poser, but committing to a college ca
reer was clearly my idea first."
Ahn graduated from the Professional Children's
School in Manhattan, N. Yâ€ž last June, but she, like Gibbs,
had an unusual high school experience.
"I spent seven out of my last 10 months of school in
California, while still 'attending' PCS," she said using air
quotes. "The school was incredibly supportive of me."
