## Tennis Anyone? 
### CHRISSY JONES 
After knocking off Florida, 4-3, at the
NCAA Division I Women's Tennis Cham
pionship last May, Stanford earned its first
title since 2006 and proved that it could
once again reign as the top women's tennis
program in the NCAA.
Starting off this season ranked No. 1, Stanford (3-0,
0-0 Pac-10) lost just one player to graduation, but added
four fiery freshmen Kristie Ahn, Nicole Gibbs, Eliz
abeth Ecker and Amelia Herring to its roster.
Unique and brilliant in their own ways, meet Stan
ford's newest forces on the court.
Nicole Gibbs began her tennis career when she was
7 years old and by age 11, had won her first national
title. Growing up in Santa Monica, Calif., Gibbs faced
the difficult choice of attending college or joining the
pro circuit after graduation.
Gibbs said her high school experience was very dif
ferent from the average student.
"Tennis shortened my high school career because 1
skipped 10th grade," she said. "On average, I missed
about 40 days per year, but it was worth it."
Gibbs describes one of her strengths as problem
solving.
"I love competition, so I take a lot of pride in my abil
ity to outthink my opponents," Gibbs remarked. She
said her biggest ambition is to "Compete at the largest
venues and hopefully achieve a top-50 professional
ranking. I do wish to enjoy an education, college tennis
and a social life before braving it on the tour."
"Andrew Luck couldn't help but be inspired by my
pursuit of a balanced college life," she jokingly added. "I
won't call him a poser, but committing to a college ca
reer was clearly my idea first."
Ahn graduated from the Professional Children's
School in Manhattan, N. Y„ last June, but she, like Gibbs,
had an unusual high school experience.
"I spent seven out of my last 10 months of school in
California, while still 'attending' PCS," she said using air
quotes. "The school was incredibly supportive of me."

Ahn is expected to play in one of
the top-four singles positions this
season, but despite being alone on
the court, she said that the bonds
with her team are important.
"Our team prides itself on being
a tight-knit group, just like a fami
ly," she said. "We are always trying
to push each other so that we can be
that much better. I can recall this
one time during fitness when I felt
like I couldn't run anymore, but my
team was right there urging me on,
and I was able to finish."
Ahn is also known as one of the
most graceful players on the team.
"She just glides on the court,
making it look unfairly easy."
quipped Ecker.
Herring, a native of Carlsbad,
Calif., arrived at Stanford after
graduating from LaCosta Canyon
High School last year. At just under
six feet tall. Herring is known for

her unbelievable power and
strength.
"I love to go big on my serve,"
she said.
Her teammates say that her wicked
serve is probably her greatest asset,
along with her hard work ethic.
Herring started playing tennis at
age 4, and she began playing com
petitively before high school.
"I played on my high school
team [my freshman year], but other
than that, I kept to my routine of
practicing and playing tournaments
almost every month," Herring said.
"I left school every day by noon and
didn't partake in many school
events, but it was all worth it."
Ecker hails from Wisconsin,
graduating last June from the Uni
versity School of Milwaukee. With
her assiduous work ethic and infa
mous giggle, Ecker not only brings
exceptional talent, but also an irre
placeable light-heartedness to the
team.
Her older brother, Sam Ecker,
plays on the men's team.
"Competing at the same univer
sity as my brother is something we

will both share for the rest of our
lives," she said.
Ecker began playing tennis seri
ously at age 8, stayed off the court
with injuries from ages 10 to 13 and
made a miraculous comeback re
covery to be one of the four fresh
men on the team.
Ecker says there are many chal
lenges that come with being a fresh
man, but one stands out above all
others.
"It's definitely giving Dilly
(sophomore Natalie Dillon) shot
gun whenever we are driving some
where," she joked.
The Cardinal has a strong, young
class looking to work hard and con
tinue to improve the prestigious
program in their four years on the
Farm. With the addition of these
four players, Stanford women's ten
nis has a chance to repeat the suc
cesses of 2010.
The Cardinal's next outing is this
Saturday, when it hosts UCLA in
Taube Tennis Stadium at noon.

"I spent seven out of my last 10 months of school in
California, while still 'attending' PCS," she said using air
quotes. "The school was incredibly supportive of me."

Ahn is expected to play in one of
the top-four singles positions this
season, but despite being alone on
the court, she said that the bonds
with her team are important.
"Our team prides itself on being
a tight-knit group, just like a fami
ly," she said. "We are always trying
to push each other so that we can be
that much better. I can recall this
one time during fitness when I felt
like I couldn't run anymore, but my
team was right there urging me on,
and I was able to finish."
Ahn is also known as one of the
most graceful players on the team.
"She just glides on the court,
making it look unfairly easy."
quipped Ecker.
Herring, a native of Carlsbad,
Calif., arrived at Stanford after
graduating from LaCosta Canyon
High School last year. At just under
six feet tall. Herring is known for

her unbelievable power and
strength.
"I love to go big on my serve,"
she said.
Her teammates say that her wicked
serve is probably her greatest asset,
along with her hard work ethic.
Herring started playing tennis at
age 4, and she began playing com
petitively before high school.
"I played on my high school
team [my freshman year], but other
than that, I kept to my routine of
practicing and playing tournaments
almost every month," Herring said.
"I left school every day by noon and
didn't partake in many school
events, but it was all worth it."
Ecker hails from Wisconsin,
graduating last June from the Uni
versity School of Milwaukee. With
her assiduous work ethic and infa
mous giggle, Ecker not only brings
exceptional talent, but also an irre
placeable light-heartedness to the
team.
Her older brother, Sam Ecker,
plays on the men's team.
"Competing at the same univer
sity as my brother is something we

will both share for the rest of our
lives," she said.
Ecker began playing tennis seri
ously at age 8, stayed off the court
with injuries from ages 10 to 13 and
made a miraculous comeback re
covery to be one of the four fresh
men on the team.
Ecker says there are many chal
lenges that come with being a fresh
man, but one stands out above all
others.
"It's definitely giving Dilly
(sophomore Natalie Dillon) shot
gun whenever we are driving some
where," she joked.
The Cardinal has a strong, young
class looking to work hard and con
tinue to improve the prestigious
program in their four years on the
Farm. With the addition of these
four players, Stanford women's ten
nis has a chance to repeat the suc
cesses of 2010.
The Cardinal's next outing is this
Saturday, when it hosts UCLA in
Taube Tennis Stadium at noon.
