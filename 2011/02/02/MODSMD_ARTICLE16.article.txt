## Cardinal wins top-five clash 
### BROOKE DAVIS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford women's gymnastics
team defeated Utah in Salt Lake City
for the first time in program history last
Friday, winning three out of four
events to squeak by with a 196.825-
196.5 victory. The showdown between
the No. 2 Cardinal and the No. 4 Utes
came down to a nail-biting balance
beam performance that helped the
Cardinal (8-0) defeat previously un
beaten Utah (3-1).
The Utes trumped the Card's vault
score of 49.225 with a 49.275 mark of
their own, but they fell to Stanford in
every other event by at least one tenth
of a point.

As the meet narrowed down,
the match became dependent on Stan
ford's performance on the balance
beam. The third gymnast in the Cardi
nal's lineup, freshman Kristina Vacu
lik, suffered a fall during her routine,
putting more pressure on Stanford's
remaining beam competitors.
In order for Stanford to clinch the win,
senior captain Allyse Ishino would
have to perform a solid routine, and
she did just that, scoring a near-perfect
9.900. Ishino tied for first on the bal
ance beam with Stanford sophomore
Ashley Morgan and Utah freshman

Stanford's other top-finishers
included senior Shelley Alexander
on the vault with a score of 9.900,
Ishino on the uneven parallel bars
with a score of 9.900, Ishino and
Morgan on the balance beam, each
with a score of 9.900, and Morgan
on floor exercise with a score of
9.925.

Stanford placed first in every
event after the vault, and Ishino left
Salt Lake City with the highest all
around score at 39.475, followed by
Utah junior Stephanie McAllister's

mark of 39.400.
Ishino's all-around score from the
Utah meet was the best of her season
and her career, and her score helped
her earn Pac-10 Gymnast of the
Week honors. Ishino and Alexander
were previously tied for the all
around season best score for the Car
dinal, each with marks of 39.350.
The win in Utah is the most re
cent in a banner season for Stan
ford, with a solid record of eight
wins and no defeats with ten more
events left on the schedule.
Stanford will compete against
San Jose State back on the Farm on
Saturday, with competition begin
ning at 4 p.m. in Burnham Pavilion.

No. 4 Utah pushed No. 2 Stanford to the limit on Friday, but the Cardinall
pulled out the victory after initially losing the vault thanks to a strong
performance on the balance beam that pushed Stanford over the edge.
