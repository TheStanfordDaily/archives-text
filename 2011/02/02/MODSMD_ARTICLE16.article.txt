## Cardinal wins top-five clash 
### BROOKE DAVIS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford women's gymnastics
team defeated Utah in Salt Lake City
for the first time in program history last
Friday, winning three out of four
events to squeak by with a 196.825-
196.5 victory. The showdown between
the No. 2 Cardinal and the No. 4 Utes
came down to a nail-biting balance
beam performance that helped the
Cardinal (8-0) defeat previously un
beaten Utah (3-1).
The Utes trumped the Card's vault
score of 49.225 with a 49.275 mark of
their own, but they fell to Stanford in
every other event by at least one tenth
of a point.

As the meet narrowed down,
the match became dependent on Stan
ford's performance on the balance
beam. The third gymnast in the Cardi
nal's lineup, freshman Kristina Vacu
lik, suffered a fall during her routine,
putting more pressure on Stanford's
remaining beam competitors.
In order for Stanford to clinch the win,
senior captain Allyse Ishino would
have to perform a solid routine, and
she did just that, scoring a near-perfect
9.900. Ishino tied for first on the bal
ance beam with Stanford sophomore
Ashley Morgan and Utah freshman
