# Packers' team photo drama overblown
##

As Super Bowl XLV
draws ever closer and
the media circus around
it comes to a climax,
many of you have un
doubtedly heard about the Green Bay
Packers' team photo drama that, if you
listen to the inane drivel of an ESPN
"analyst," threatens to distract the
Pack and hand the Lombardi Trophy
over on a silver platter.
Somehow, this thing has blown up
into a massive national story, despite
the fact that it isn't a story at all. ESPN
and other esteemed national news
outlets feel the need to cover all foot
ball, all the time (because, hey, football
sells), so whenever they get a tidbit of
"controversy," they relentlessly hype
and publicize it. This is an unfortunate
reality, but I have some advice for
ESPN: 1 know you want higher ratings,
but you shouldn't abuse your position
as the biggest sports media outlet to
magnify stories that just aren't there.
To give a brief summary of the
"controversy," every year each Super
Bowl team poses for a team picture in
the week leading up to the game.
Green Bay was scheduled to have its
picture taken on Tuesday, but the 16
Packers on injured reserve, who suf
fered season-ending injuries, were not
scheduled to arrive in Dallas until
Thursday. Injured players Jermichael
Finley and Nick Bamett took to Twit
ter to express their displeasure at the
situation, and star quarterback Aaron
Rodgers sniped back a few days later,
basically calling out Finley and Bar
nett for not staying with the team after
they were injured and choosing to re
habilitate themselves elsewhere.
The Packers, and specifically the
players involved, probably could have
handled this situation better. I'm sure
there are internal venues more readily
accessible to the players on IR than
Twitter (and it doesn't help that the
mainstream media has discovered this
newfangled Internet device only a few
weeks after your grandmother.) Fin
ley and Bamett could have told team
officials they wanted to be in the photo
or asked teammates to intercede on
their behalf. Similarly, Rodgers didn't
have to call them out for rehabbing
elsewhere, but an ESPN reporter
pointedly asked him for his assess
ment of the situation.
Nevertheless,it's a bit of a leap to go
from "several players expressing dis
pleasure" to "full-blown controversy
threatening to tear the team apart."

For starters, this isn't about playing
time or the depth chart it's just a
team photo. It's really not that big of a
deal. If the injured players weren't al
lowed to join the Packers in Dallas or
be on the sideline during the game,
then that would be a pretty big deal,
but that was never the case.
More than anything else, this case
points to two problems in our main
stream sports media: it is very quick to
latch onto anything football-related
and anything Twitter-related. Obvi

ously, football is the monster of the
American sports landscape, and this
leads to idiotic stories like this one get
ting more airtime on "Sports Center"
than games in other sports that are,
you know, actually played.
I also think that ESPN still hasn't
figured out how to report on Twitter
properly. We saw this during the Jay
Cutler saga as well, when pundits read
deeply into the short messages that
other players were posting about Cut
ler's exit from the NFC Championship
Game with a knee injury (later re
vealed to be a damaged MCL). As
hard as ESPN tries, you can't make a
news story out of a quote that's 140
characters or less. Twitter lends itself to
making short statements, but I don't

think a person can really make an ad
equate criticism in that tiny space.
Of course, we suffer from this in
college sports too, where the biggest
games of the year have weeks of spec
ulation and hype leading up to them.
Sometimes, I wish the rest of the sports
media would just do what we did for
this year's Orange Bowl: fly in the day
of the game, report on the game and
the postgame press conference, and
then fly out the day after. I guess that
would just be too logical.

Sometimes Kabir Sawhney's editors
wish he would limit himself to 140
characters. This isn't one of those times;
however. Go over your word limit at
