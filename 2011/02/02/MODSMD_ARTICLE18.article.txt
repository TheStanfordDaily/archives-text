## Four Stanford seniors receive invitations to the NFL Combine 
### â€” Wyndam Makowsky 
Sione Fua, Owen Marecic,
Richard Sherman and Ryan
Whalen secured spots in Indi
anapolis for the league's compre
hensive week of evaluations of po
tential draft picks. Receiving a bid

is quite significant in the prepara
tion process, as players get a
chance to display their skills to
scouts, coaches and managers
from all 32 NFL teams.
All four players have already
participated in postseason all-star
games. Fua, Marecic and Sherman
played in the Senior Bowl, and all
amassed significant playing time.

Sherman had an interception that
was called back because of a de
fensive offsides penalty, Fua
played defensive tackle in a 4-3
alignment after spending the sea
son as Stanford's nose tackle in the
3-4, and Marecic, who played both
ways in 2010, was used exclusively
at fullback and on special teams.
All starred for the North team.

Whalen took part in the East-West
Shrine Game and led the West
squad in receiving, pulling down
three catches for 24 yards.
The Combine will begin on Feb.
23 and conclude on March 1. The
2011 NFL Draft will take place in
New York from April 28-30.
