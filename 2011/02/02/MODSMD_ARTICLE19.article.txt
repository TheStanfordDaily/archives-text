# STRONG START FOR SYNCHRO
## 
### ALYSSA LONDON 
The Stanford synchronized
swimming team opened its 2011
season Saturday with a win over vis
iting University of the Incarnate
Word at Avery Aquatic Center. The
Cardinal placed first in three out of
the four events.
On a drizzly Saturday afternoon,
a rainbow provided a nice backdrop
for the synchronized swimmers'
performances. Junior Alex Bollaid
law said that it was exciting to get
back in the pool for the first meet of
the season.
"While swimming you are just
thinking about your team and per
forming to the best of your ability,"
Bollaidlaw said. "From there, all the
components of the performance
come together. We have practiced
so much. You just go and do it."
The meet began with the trio
competition as Stanford's team of
sophomore Wendy Lu, senior
Corinne Smith and junior Koko
Urata secured the top spot with a
score of 86.00.
With its animated and musically
whimsical piece, the Cardinal's
team of sophomore Alex Bollaid
law and juniors Madison Crocker
and Morgan Fuller took second
with 85.00 points. Incarnate Word's

two teams finished third and fourth.
The afternoon continued with
the duet teams. Stanford juniors
Maria Koroleva and Olivia Morgan
won the event with a score of
90.167. Finishing second were
Crocker and Fuller with 85.500
points. Incarnate Word placed third
with an 84.00, while the Cardinal's
Bollaidlaw paired with sophomore
Jessica Guenther to come in fourth
with 83.333 points.
Morgan was positive about the
meet and her duet performance.
"This meet I felt calm and col
lected, and I knew exactly what I
needed to do, especially in duet,"
she said. "I felt like I was in perform
ance mode, and I could go out and
perform. While I was out there I
didn't think of anything else. I went
out, performed and put myself out
there."
Morgan, who performed the
same routine last year, was glad for
the chance to improve her tech
nique.
"It was nice to swim the same
duet as last year," she said. "Our
aerobic endurance has increased
from last year, which allowed us to
make the duet harder and more
complicated."
