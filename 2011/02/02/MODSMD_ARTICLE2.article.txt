## Middle East Expert Beinin explores protests Professor discusses events leading to Egyptian uprising 
### MARWA FARAG DESK EDITOR 
History professor Joel Beinin, an expert in
Middle East history, delivered a talk on the cur
rent uprisings in Egypt on Tuesday afternoon in
front of a full crowd in the Lane History Cor
ner.
Since Jan. 25, protestors have taken to the
streets of Egypt's main cities, calling for the fall
of the existing regime and the resignation of in
cumbent president Hosni Mubarak, who has
been in power since 1981.
Over the weekend, Mubarak appointed a
vice president and made attempts to reshuffle
his government, measures that did not ap
pease protestors. Monday saw the launch of a
"Million Man March" in Cairo's Tahrir
Square, and during Beinin's talk, Mubarak an
nounced that he would not be running for re
election in September. Several world leaders,
including President Obama, had previously
urged him to take this step. Egyptians contin
ue to call for his immediate removal.
After presenting a brief history of the nation
since 1952, Beinin painted a bleak picture of the
40 percent of Egypt's population living near or
below the poverty line, highlighting a 25-per
cent employment rate for young men and 23-
percent inflation on food and beverages in
urban areas.
"This didn't happen on Facebook. It hap
pened as a result of certain historical process
es," Beinin said, emphasizing the value of a his
torical approach in analyzing the uprising.
These historical processes, Beinin argued,
were put in place by the "authoritarian kleptoc
racy" of Mubarak's regime and its "resolve to
embark on the neoliberal agenda."
Mobilization of labor, corruption (or in
Beinin's words, the "classic crony capitalist proj
ect") and income inequality were among the his
torical processes to which Beinin assigned blame.
Tunisia's recent uprising's effect was
also discussed, but Beinin was care
ful to make distinctions between the
two North African states.
"Two key things happened in
Tunisia that haven't happened in
Egypt yet, and one of which won't
happen," Beinin said. "The trade
union federation changed sides,
and the army changed sides.
"In Egypt, the trade union fed

eration is not going to change sides
because there is too much at stake,"
she added. "The army still hasn't
decided, which will be the biggest
make-or-break factor."
Beinin ended the talk by men
tioning an undergraduate advisee
who is currently in Egypt. This stu
dent had communicated messages
to him from the streets of Cairo to
be relayed to America.
"Tell people in America nobody
wants an Islamic government. We
are protesting because we are tired
and sick of hardships," Beinin said,
quoting the student. "Ask people in
America to speak out against their

government and support what we
are doing."
Following the talk, a 20-minute
question-and-answer session saw
audience members asking Beinin
about the role of the Muslim
Brotherhood, the food shortage,
U.S. policy regarding Israel and the
prospects for Egypt's future.
On this final point, Beinin gave
a cautious response.
"Egypt is fundamentally broken
in many ways ... and democracy
does not come without a struggle."
