### MARWA FARAG DESK EDITOR 
History professor Joel Beinin, an expert in
Middle East history, delivered a talk on the cur
rent uprisings in Egypt on Tuesday afternoon in
front of a full crowd in the Lane History Cor
ner.
Since Jan. 25, protestors have taken to the
streets of Egypt's main cities, calling for the fall
of the existing regime and the resignation of in
cumbent president Hosni Mubarak, who has
been in power since 1981.
Over the weekend, Mubarak appointed a
vice president and made attempts to reshuffle
his government, measures that did not ap
pease protestors. Monday saw the launch of a
"Million Man March" in Cairo's Tahrir
Square, and during Beinin's talk, Mubarak an
nounced that he would not be running for re
election in September. Several world leaders,
including President Obama, had previously
urged him to take this step. Egyptians contin
ue to call for his immediate removal.
After presenting a brief history of the nation
since 1952, Beinin painted a bleak picture of the
40 percent of Egypt's population living near or
below the poverty line, highlighting a 25-per
cent employment rate for young men and 23-
percent inflation on food and beverages in
urban areas.
"This didn't happen on Facebook. It hap
pened as a result of certain historical process
es," Beinin said, emphasizing the value of a his
torical approach in analyzing the uprising.
These historical processes, Beinin argued,
were put in place by the "authoritarian kleptoc
racy" of Mubarak's regime and its "resolve to
embark on the neoliberal agenda."
Mobilization of labor, corruption (or in
Beinin's words, the "classic crony capitalist proj
ect") and income inequality were among the his
torical processes to which Beinin assigned blame.
