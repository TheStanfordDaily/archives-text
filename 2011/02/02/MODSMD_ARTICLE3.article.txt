## Lab develops better method to see brain New technique allows for clearer picture without infection 
### ERIN INMAN STAFF WRITER 
Our picture of the human brain just got a lot
clearer with the development of a new technique
that allows scientists to monitor neurons in a live
brain for months at a time.

Stanford's Schnitzer Group devised the new
technique to model progressions of brain dis
eases and neural development, according to lab
manager Juergen Jung. The project received
funding from the National Institute on Drug
Abuse, the National Institute of Neurological
Disorders and Stroke, the National Cancer Insti
tute and Mauna Kea Technologies.
To begin the process, scientists implant a tiny
glass tube, smaller than a grain of rice in width,
into the brain, sealing one end almost complete
ly within the skull. To monitor a specific area of
brain tissue, they temporarily insert an endo
scope, a thin device use to inspect the interior of
an organ or cavity, through the exposed end of
the tube. The submerged end then acts as a win
dow from which to view the area with the endo
scope. This allows for high precision in monitor
ing specific areas within the brain, Jung said.
Akin to looking through foggy glasses, the
older technique relied on substantially thinning
the skull to the point that water immersion of the
area would achieve a similar "window effect"
when viewed with an endoscope. While the old
technique allowed for imaging of a wider param
eter, it lacked precision for a follow up on the
same area, Jung said.
Additionally, thinning the skull
left it vulnerable to infection. Now,
by sealing part of the tube within the
skull instead, infection is no longer
an issue. In fact, the lab found that a
cap was unnecessary for the end ex
posed to the outside of the skull.
"We could just leave it open and
blow out any dust before inserting
the endoscope for a clear view,"
Jung said.
Although the small probe allows
for durability and precision, it also
limits how much researchers can
see.
"You want a tiny probe and a
huge field of view," Jung said. But
because the two goals are contradic
tory, "you must find the right bal
ance and chose parameters accord
ingly."
To view a deep brain structure
such as the hippocampus, the tube
must pass through other brain tis
sues, specifically the motor cortex.
Rather than force the tube through
the tissues in implantation, part of
the motor cortex must be removed.
In using the tube to study dis
eases or development, this could
pose a problem as removal of the
tissue may have an impact on a sub
ject's cognitive function. But Jung

noted,
"Usually
other
parts of
the brain
will take up
the destroyed
section's function."
The lab used the
new technique to moni
tor the progression of can
cer in mice through chronic
imaging of red blood cells in
capillaries in the affected
area of the brain.
In using existing
technology of high
speed cameras to
make time-lapse
movies of single cell
movements, the lab
was able to measure the
speed of blood flow through
out the progression of the disease.
The lab supported, with this higher
resolution imaging, the previously
held belief that blood rate slows as
cancer progresses in an affected re
gion.

"This [imaging] could be
interesting for pharmaceu
tical companies," Jung said.
"For example, if you have a
medication, what kind of [visi
ble] impact does it have?"
Company researchers would
need to determine where to image
and how to access the area. This
specificity requires designing the
endoscope and glass tube exclusive
ly for each medication and affected
area to be observed.
While the technique is
now being integrated
into neuro-

logical
research with animal mod
els, the Schnitzer Group also wants
to get the technology into a surgery
room, Jung said.
