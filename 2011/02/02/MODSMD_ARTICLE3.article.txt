## Lab develops better method to see brain New technique allows for clearer picture without infection 
### ERIN INMAN STAFF WRITER 
Our picture of the human brain just got a lot
clearer with the development of a new technique
that allows scientists to monitor neurons in a live
brain for months at a time.

Stanford's Schnitzer Group devised the new
technique to model progressions of brain dis
eases and neural development, according to lab
manager Juergen Jung. The project received
funding from the National Institute on Drug
Abuse, the National Institute of Neurological
Disorders and Stroke, the National Cancer Insti
tute and Mauna Kea Technologies.
To begin the process, scientists implant a tiny
glass tube, smaller than a grain of rice in width,
into the brain, sealing one end almost complete
ly within the skull. To monitor a specific area of
brain tissue, they temporarily insert an endo
scope, a thin device use to inspect the interior of
an organ or cavity, through the exposed end of
the tube. The submerged end then acts as a win
dow from which to view the area with the endo
scope. This allows for high precision in monitor
ing specific areas within the brain, Jung said.
Akin to looking through foggy glasses, the
older technique relied on substantially thinning
the skull to the point that water immersion of the
area would achieve a similar "window effect"
when viewed with an endoscope. While the old
technique allowed for imaging of a wider param
eter, it lacked precision for a follow up on the
same area, Jung said.
