# ASSU VP resigns post
## Bike accident forces Wharton to take quarter off 
### MARGARET RAWSON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
ASSU Vice President Kelsei Wharton
'l2 announced his resignation at Tuesday
evening's Undergraduate Senate meeting,
saying that he will take winter quarter off
after fracturing his jaw in a Jan. 16 bike ac
cident.
"You must be a student to participate,
period," Wharton said to the senators.
He explained that he must give up his
ASSU post and housing because he will not
be enrolled winter quarter.
Wharton voiced his disappointment to
the senators, stating that he "set out last
April on a journey to complete a year as
vice president."

"I need to focus on my recovery," he
added.
His resignation became effective last
week when he terminated his enrollment.
Executive Angelina Cardona 'll will select
Wharton's replacement, who will need to
be confirmed by a two-thirds vote in both
the Senate and the Graduate Student
Council (GSC). This same process took
place last year when former vice president
Jay de la Torre 'lO stepped down due to his
suspension, the result of an honor code vio
lation. This procedure was established last
year in a bill passed by the 11th Undergrad
uate Senate.
"I think it takes a lot of strength," Car
dona said of Wharton's decision. "I know on
a personal level it was not an easy one to

make. He and I have been partners since
day one."
Cardona, who was not present for Whar
ton's announcement, later praised Whar
ton's leadership and commitment to their
shared vision for the ASSU.
"It's definitely not easy to see him
leave," she said. "He will be thoroughly
missed, both as a working partner and as
one of my best friends."
As for Wharton's replacement, Cardona
said that she plans to discuss her decision
with other ASSU leaders, emphasizing her
administration's spirit of collaboration.
"I have been spending a lot of time this
week thinking about who that individual

will be," Cardona said. "It will most
likely be someone who is integrated
into the ASSU team on some level."
Wharton assured the senators
Tuesday that he plans to remain
active with ASSU through e-mail
during his recovery, providing
whatever support he can to ongo
ing projects.
In an interview with The Daily,
Wharton described his accident,
saying he lost control of his bike
and collided with parked cars while
biking during the morning of Jan.
16. After going to the hospital and
having his jaw wired shut, he was
unable to attend school for over a
week.
"It could have been much
worse," Wharton said, saying that
he remarkably did not suffer a con
cussion.
"I'm thankful that it was this iso
lated kind of injury that in many
ways I can bounce back from," he
said.

But he added that it's difficult to
"bounce back" quickly enough to
stay up to speed with the quarter
system. He hopes to return spring
quarter.
"I feel very confident in the
work that we've been able to lay
with the ASSU
...I'm very confident that it will con
tinue to be fruitful," Wharton said.
"I'm hoping the work I've been
able to do this year is somewhat in
spirational and motivates others."
"Good things are going to keep
coming," Wharton told the senators

yesterday about the future of
ASSU.
"I'm sad to see Kelsei go," Sen
ate Chair Michael Cruz 'l2 said.
"He's served the University really
well and has been one of the best
vice presidents I've seen. When he
comes back he'll be an amazing
asset to the University once again."
Cruz left Tuesday's Senate meet
ing early to attend interviews for a
new CEO of Stanford Student En
terprises (SSE). The current CEO
of SSE, Raj Bhandari M.S. 'lO, de
cided not to renew his contract for
next year.
After Cruz's departure, and in
light of the absence of Deputy
Chair Madeline Hawes 'l3 for the
same reason, Senator Juany Torres
'l3 chaired the rest of Tuesday's
meeting.
The Senate passed a bill granting
five extra days to student groups to
submit the necessary financial in
formation to apply for special fees
in the 2010-2011 ASSU General
Election; applications are now due
Feb. 20.
