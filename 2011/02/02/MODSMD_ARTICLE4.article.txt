## Bike accident forces Wharton to take quarter off 
### MARGARET RAWSON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
ASSU Vice President Kelsei Wharton
'l2 announced his resignation at Tuesday
evening's Undergraduate Senate meeting,
saying that he will take winter quarter off
after fracturing his jaw in a Jan. 16 bike ac
cident.
"You must be a student to participate,
period," Wharton said to the senators.
He explained that he must give up his
ASSU post and housing because he will not
be enrolled winter quarter.
Wharton voiced his disappointment to
the senators, stating that he "set out last
April on a journey to complete a year as
vice president."

"I need to focus on my recovery," he
added.
His resignation became effective last
week when he terminated his enrollment.
Executive Angelina Cardona 'll will select
Wharton's replacement, who will need to
be confirmed by a two-thirds vote in both
the Senate and the Graduate Student
Council (GSC). This same process took
place last year when former vice president
Jay de la Torre 'lO stepped down due to his
suspension, the result of an honor code vio
lation. This procedure was established last
year in a bill passed by the 11th Undergrad
uate Senate.
"I think it takes a lot of strength," Car
dona said of Wharton's decision. "I know on
a personal level it was not an easy one to

make. He and I have been partners since
day one."
Cardona, who was not present for Whar
ton's announcement, later praised Whar
ton's leadership and commitment to their
shared vision for the ASSU.
"It's definitely not easy to see him
leave," she said. "He will be thoroughly
missed, both as a working partner and as
one of my best friends."
As for Wharton's replacement, Cardona
said that she plans to discuss her decision
with other ASSU leaders, emphasizing her
administration's spirit of collaboration.
"I have been spending a lot of time this
week thinking about who that individual
