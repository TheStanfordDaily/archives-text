## Applications up, on pace with nationwide increase 
### JENNY THAI STAFF WRITER 
It's no news that Stanford is
one of the most coveted univer
sities for college-bound stu
dents. Applications for the
Class of 2015 reached a record
high for the University, totaling
approximately 34,200 and rep
resenting a staggering 7 percent
increase from last year. But
what is it about Stanford that at
tracts so much interest?
According to Bob Patterson,
director of undergraduate ad
mission, the primary contribut
ing factor to the increase in stu
dent interest was the Universi
ty's firm commitment to em
bodying the free spirit of learn
ing, exemplified in the school's
motto, "Die Luft der Freiheit
weht," or "the wind of freedom
blows."
"Students are interested in
pursuing their academic inter
ests and [the Stanford message]
aligns with those interests," Pat
terson said.
Stanford's increase in appli
cations has not been markedly
greater than figures at its peer
institutions.
"We're increasing at about
the same rate," said Patterson.
"Last year had the highest num
ber of high school graduates.
This year, there's been a de
cline, but more students are ap
plying to more institutions."

Another factor to be taken
into consideration is Stanford's
prevalence in popular media.
For instance, in James
Cameron's blockbuster
"Avatar," Dr. Grace Augustine,
an eminent ecologist played by
Sigourney Weaver '72, wears a
Cardinal tank top whenever she
shifts into an alien body. Stan
ford's reputation as a world
class institution, diffused
through social media, may have
a hand in boosting student in
terest as well.
"I don't think it hurts to have
that notoriety from the press, in
films, important research. Or
ange Bowl victories," said Pat
terson. "But it's not something
we can actually track in terms of
affecting increases or decreases
in applications."
Despite the fact that Stan
ford played a big role in the
plots of teen culture staples
such as "High School Musical
3" and the series finale of Han
nah Montana the latter of
which sparked rumors that its
star, Miley Cyrus, would be join
ing the class of 2015 the Uni
versity does not seek to sell the
Stanford brand. Any requests to
use the Stanford brand must be
approved first by University
Communications.
"We never proactively mar
ket the Stanford brand," said
Lisa Lapin, assistant vice presi
dent of University Communica

tions. "Instead, they come to us.
We evaluate their request and
approve it only if the character
in the show adheres to the qual
ities embodied by the typical
Stanford student. For example,
in 'Avatar,' Weaver is a scientist,
which fits with what a Stanford
alum would do."

Regardless of the free pub
licity, Stanford takes a staunch
stance in adhering to the uni
versity's educational mission.
"We're not soliciting more
applications," said Patterson.
"In general, there is a lot of stu
dent interest, [so] we try to
reach out to students who are
not aware of the Stanford mes
sage, students who've never
heard of it before."

Despite growing fears of a
vanishing acceptance rate. Bob

Patterson remains optimistic
about its stability for the Class
of 2015. He anticipates only a
slight increase in selectivity, due
to efforts by admissions staff to
drive home the Stanford mis
sion to prospective students of
all backgrounds.
"Class size will be relatively
the same," said Patterson. "I
think the acceptance rate will
be relatively the same as last
year's, maybe a little more se
lective. We're trying to make
sure that students do their re
search before applying."
Students who applied under
the regular admission program
will receive their admissions re
sults by the end of March.
