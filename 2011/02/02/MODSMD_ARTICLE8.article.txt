## Tech firms pledge millions as hospital expansion pushes forward 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF — An Le Nguyen Ivy Nguyen 
The Stanford Hospital Corporate
Partners Program announced yes
terday that it would donate up to
$l5O million over 10 years to the hos
pital expansion project. A deal was
also reached at the latest Palo Alto
City Council meeting on Jan. 31 to
accelerate negotiations over a devel
opment agreement.
The Partners Program includes
Hewlett-Packard, Apple, eßay, Intel,
Intuit and Oracle. Stanford Hospital
president and CEO Amir Dan
Rubin said that this recent develop
ment heralds a new collaboration
between corporations and hospitals
to provide patient-centered, high
tech care. Rubin also hopes to ex
plore the possibility of similar rela
tionships with other companies.
Funding from the six tech com
panies will supplement the $4OO mil
lion that Stanford Hospitals & Clin
ics hopes to bring in through private
donations to help fund the construc
tion of a $2 billion hospital at the
Stanford Medical Center. This new
construction is part of a larger $3 bil
lion expansion effort that includes
upgrades at Lucile Packard Chil
dren's Hospital, the Stanford Uni
versity Medical Center and Stanford
clinics.
The project is expected to in
crease bed capacity to 600 and in
clude new and expanded intensive
care and emergency services, adding
1.3 million square feet of new devel
opment to Palo Alto, exceeding the
city's zoning regulations.
Such a large expansion could
overburden Palo Alto's streets, mak
ing the project a contentious issue
for the Palo Alto City Council.
Nonetheless, the two parties are set
to close a $126 million package after
the Jan. 31 city council meeting,
bringing the expansion one step clos
er to reality.

This package includes expanded
shuttle services, improved pedestri
an and bike paths and road up
grades. It would also pay for Caltrain
passes for more than 9,000 hospital
workers.

Though the two sides still disagree
on several issues, including a stipula
tion that Stanford would provide the
city with a "revenue guarantee" so
that the hospitals would not burden
the city's general fund, Mayor Sid Es
pinosa said that he saw a deal being
reached in the near future.

Should the project be approved
soon, construction could start before
the end of the year and is projected
to be completed by 2018.
