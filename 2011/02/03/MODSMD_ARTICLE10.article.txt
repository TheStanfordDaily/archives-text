/ / "V "T That do you think we'll
\A/ fight World War 111
V Y over?"
It was an interesting question for
a third date, and the first thing my
(now ex-) boyfriend and I disagreed
on. I said "cheap oil" and he an
swered "water."
Our difference of opinion was
largely a product of our upbring
ings. I was raised on thunderstorms
and flooded basements back East,
while he grew up amid droughts and
"water wars" in California.
Months after we parted ways, I
was reminded of that conversation
as I drove through California's Cen
tral Valley, past billboards plastered
with water propaganda and tractors
shadowed by dust clouds.
Few issues polarize the Great
State more than water supply. The
most apparently wasteful demand is
concentrated in the dry south, in hy
drologic black holes like the Los
Angeles basin, where 28 million
people sprinkle lawns and fill pools
in an area that, in isolation, could
provide liquid sustenance for only
about one million residents. Still,
two thirds of the state's freshwater
demand is agricultural; after con
secutive years of drought, farmers
have watched crops wither and or
chards die. This year, even with the
Sierra snowpack at 136 percent of
normal, the state anticipates meet
ing only 60 percent of the growing
demand. Supplements will doubt
less come from belowground reser
voirs, pumped to the surface by hun
dreds of unregulated wells that
mine a precious resource faster
than it is being replenished.
Yes, despite the apparent abun
dance of rain that broke our string
of sunny January days on Sunday,
our freshwater supply is, at least in
part, a nonrenewable resource. This
is true across a disturbingly large
fraction of the country and the
globe where freshwater supplies
are being consumed (and contami
nated) far faster than the planet's
natural hydrological cycles can re
store them. And with climate
change shifting precipitation pat
terns and converting ice caps and
snowpacks into rising sea levels,
supplying a growing world popula
tion will only become more chal
lenging.
How much water does one per
son need?
Anyone who actually drinks the
recommended two liters per day
consumes only 730 liters (less than
200 gallons) of water directly each
year. But the average American's
water footprint is 2.5 million liters
per year about the volume of an
Olympic swimming pool. By com
parison, the global average is 1.2
million liters, but one third of hu
manity survives under "scarce" con
ditions less than one million
liters per year. That's because water
goes into the production of almost
everything: from growing food
crops to cotton for clothes, from

cooling manufacturing equipment
to hosing down thirsty livestock.
The jeans you're wearing consumed
nearly 11,000 liters in production,
the equivalent of nine cups of coffee
at 140 liters each, but less than half
the volume of a 2,400 liter hamburg
er. As much as cheap oil provides
hidden subsidies for everything we
do, an invisible weight of water is
folded into the very clothes we
wear.
These water subsidies translate
into dramatic trade fluxes. When
the United States exports a ton of
wheat, it also transfers 1.3 million
liters of freshwater used to grow
and process the crop. Globally, 1.6
quadrillion (that's 10 A 15!) liters
cross international boundaries each
year, a staggering volume (equiva
lent to 10 Lake Tahoes) that decou
ples local populations from their re
source bases.
Trading this "virtual water" al
lows us to economize on water use:
why turn desert into cropland when
one can import food grown more ef
ficiently elsewhere? But it also re
sults in a dangerous disconnect be
tween supply and demand, letting
wealthy countries export their
water footprints and attendant en
vironmental degradation. It's hard
enough to worry about sustainabili
ty and environmental degradation
in our own backyards. Here in Cali
fornia, where only 10 percent of our
original wetlands remain, we con
tinue to divert more and more
water for human consumption. Are
we willing to pay a premium and re
duce demand to preserve the re
sources of a country half a world
away?
If your answer is "yes," there are
a few ways you can reduce your
water footprint. Low-flow taps and
showerheads especially ones
that provide continuous feedback
on water usage have proven con
sumption-reduction records. And
although most of us don't grow our
own food, we can patronize growers
who use drip irrigation (which min
imizes wasteful evaporation) and
couple crop choices to local hydrol
ogy. And, unsurprisingly, at 5,000
liters per day, an omnivorous diet
uses more than double the water
volume of a vegetarian lifestyle.
Plus, choosing low-water options
tends to reduce your carbon foot
print, too. Because, in all likelihood,
the next World War will have more
than one cause.

Holly thinks you should stock up on
virtual water in preparation for
World War 111. For information on
