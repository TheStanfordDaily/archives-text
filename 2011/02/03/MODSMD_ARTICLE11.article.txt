## Twenty Years of Suffering: The Life and Times of a Jets Fan 
### Shane Savitsky 
I've been in a long-term relation
ship for a while now. It hasn't
been going well recently. Hon
estly, it's on the verge of abusive for
me. I know that all relationships
have their ups and downs, but this
one is really getting tough. You see,
just recently, I thought we were
ready to take things to the next level.
In fact, we had been at this point be
fore even just a year ago and
nothing came of it. A few days ago,
those dreams were snatched away
from me once again. I was heartbro
ken. I think I deserve a little better.
I'm talking of course about my
lifelong relationship with the New
York Jets. (Did you think I was talk
ing about something else?) Two
Sundays ago, the Jets came within a
game of the Super Bowl for the sec
ond year in a row. Of course, they
lost. What else should I expect?
They're the same old Jets. Let's put
it this way: the last time the Jets
were in the Super Bowl was before
Neil Armstrong walked on the
Moon.
My dynamic with this team gets a
little obsessive. I wore the same
clothes for every game during the
Jets' playoff run last year. During
the AFC Championship Game
against the Indianapolis Colts, I ac
cidentally wore a different belt. I
was convinced for about three days
that I alone prevented the Jets from
reaching the Super Bowl. Or this
year: I changed my Gchat status to
"GO JETS!" before their first play
off game and absolutely refused to
alter it in any way until they lost. Se
riously, it's unhealthy. I was so
stressed out about the playoff game
against the mighty New England
Patriots this year that I got sick and
almost threw up. Keep in mind, this
was after we had already won the
game. This team might kill me or

at least continue to induce socially
crippling attacks of OCD.
It doesn't get any easier for me.
My family has season tickets. Quite
often during the frigid winter
months, we willingly drive two
hours from beautiful Scranton,
Pennsylvania to the industrial
wasteland of East Rutherford, New
Jersey to cheer on the Jets. Of
course, even with that level of fan
dom, those same old Jets still found
away to slap us in the face. For 15
years, our season tickets were in the
very last row of the upper deck of
Giants Stadium. This is obviously a
first world problem. I realize that
I'm complaining about the location
of our NFL season tickets. But I'm a
lifelong Jets fan, damn it, and I re
serve the right to complain about
anything and everything related to
this team.
Even after all this, my love for

the Jets somehow manages to su
persede my love for Stanford. I own
a Mark Sanchez jersey. You know,
the former star U$C quarterback?
Mark Sanchez was the poster child
for the University of Spoiled Chil
dren and by extension, for all evil
in the world. (Just for the record: as
a Stanford football fan, if there's
something I hate more than U$C,
it's Pete Carroll. And if there's
something I hate more than Pete
Carroll, it's Cal.) It was only a little
more than two years ago that I was
at the Stanford-USC game in Stan
ford Stadium screaming, "Dirty
Sanchez, you suck!" Yeah, he's a Jet
now. Moreover, I really like the guy.
I think he might be one of my fa
vorite players. (As I write those
words, I almost feel like I'm punch
ing this beautiful university in the
face.)
But you know what? I think we
Jets fans just really love to com
plain. When it comes down to it, I
could really care less about any of
this bitterness. Yes, the Jets continu
ally break my heart, but they let me
be a part of something bigger than
myself. Only fans of long-suffering
sports franchises can truly under
stand what I mean. In fact, I think a
lot of lifelong Stanford football fans
should see some parallels here.
Being a Jets fan might cut roughly
three years from my life expectancy,
but I think the trade-off is worth it.
Besides, it's been too long. There's
no going back at this point. After all,
this team was as much a part of my
childhood as Barney. That's saying
something.

Any fellow lovers of Gang Green out
there in Stanfordland? Be sure to
shoot Shane an e-mail at
savitsky@stanford.edu. And no foot
jokes, please.

You know what?
I think we Jets
fans really love
to complain.
