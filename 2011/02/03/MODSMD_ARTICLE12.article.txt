## FOOTBALL SPECIAL FOOTBALL SIGNS 19 TO LETTERS OF INTENT Recruiting class is among nation's best 
### KABIR SAWHNEY DESK EDITOR 
Stanford football took big strides to
ward a successful 2011 season during yes
terday's National Signing Day, hauling in
one of the nation's top recruiting classes.
The Cardinal signed 19 players to letters
of intent, piecing together a class ranked
No. 20 by ESPN.com and No. 22 by
Scout.com and Rivals.com.
"This signing class is one that will play
a big role in the future success of Stanford
football," said head coach David Shaw.
"We wanted to bring in players who
demonstrate a certain level of toughness
that has been established throughout our
program. I feel we have successfully met
all of our goals with this recruiting class."
Stanford bolstered its defense with its
signees, adding five defensive linemen,
four defensive backs and one linebacker
to its roster (though some players may
change positions once they join the team).
On offense, the Cardinal added two run
ning backs, two wide receivers, a fullback,
two offensive linemen and two quarter
backs.
"We wanted to get receivers, defensive
backs and defensive linemen in particu
lar," Shaw said at a Wednesday afternoon
press conference. "Those needs were met.
"In order to win the games that we
need to win, we need to keep getting
faster, and I think we did that," he added.
Overall, Stanford had seven four-star
recruits as rated by Rivals and Scout, with
11 more earning three-star ratings.
The top-rated recruit in the class is
James Vaughters, an inside linebacker
from Tucker High School (Ga.). The 6-
foot-2 Vaughters, who verbally committed

to Stanford over the summer, is among the
top five recruits in the nation at his posi
tion. Given the departures of last year's
starting linebackers Owen Marecic and
Thomas Keiser, Vaughters may immedi
ately see playing time.
The second player in the class rated in
the nation's top 150 players is Wayne
Lyons, a safety from Dillard High School
(Fla.). Lyons, and four-star recruit Jordan
Richards from Folsom High School
(Calif.), should reinforce a Stanford sec
ondary that loses top cornerback Richard
Sherman next season, and could figure
prominently in Stanford's defensive back
field in the near future.
The Cardinal also picked up two pure
defensive tackles, Anthony Hayes from
Saint Thomas Academy (Minn.) and
Lance Callihan from Catholic High
School (La.). Shaw said that Stanford had
not signed that type of player in its last two
classes.
"To get two in one class has been phe
nomenal for us," he said. "I'm really excit
ed to get those young men that are aca
demically what we need them to be, and,
football-wise, what we need them to be as
well."
The Cardinal's final four-star defensive
recruit is Charlie Hopkins, a 6-foot-6,240-
pound defensive end out of Gonzaga Prep
School (Wash.). Hopkins committed ver
bally to Stanford in early June.
On offense, Stanford's receiving corps
should get a strong boost from the addi
tion of Ty Montgomery from Saint Mark's
School (Texas). Two of Stanford's top re
ceivers from last season, Doug Baldwin
and Ryan Whalen, are out of eligibility, so
Montgomery should be a solid target for
rising junior quarterback Andrew Luck
next season.
Two understudies for Luck also signed
on with the Card Evan Crower from
Saint Augustine High School (Calif.) and
Kevin Hogan of Gonzaga College High

School (D.C.). Crower is the more highly
touted of the pair, but both figure to com
pete immediately with Stanford's existing
backup quarterbacks for positions on the
depth chart.
Stanford picked up a two-way player in
Patrick Skov from the Lawrenceville
School (N.J.). Skov, the younger brother of
sophomore linebacker Shayne Skov, plays
both inside linebacker and fullback, and
he may play one or both positions for the
Cardinal.
Aside from Montgomery, Stanford
added three four-star players. At the of
fensive lineman position, Brendon Austin
from Chaparral High School (Colo.) will
join the team, along with a pair of new run
ning backs: Remound Wright from Bishop
Dwenger (Ind.) and Kelsey Young from
Norco High School (Calif.), the same insti
tution that produced former Stanford run
ning back Toby Gerhart.
