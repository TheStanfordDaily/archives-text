# FOOTBALL FINDS LOCAL TALENT POOL
## Three Cardinal players from Monte Viste fuel pipeline 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Before Ryan Whalen became an NFL draft
prospect, the Cardinal's No. 1 receiver and a scholar
ship athlete, he was a recruited walk-on player from a
school an hour north of the Farm that hadn't sent a
player to Stanford since 1998. Four years and a couple
of big, four-star commits later, Monte Vista High
School is considered a pipeline for Cardinal football
recruiting.
Located in the heart of the San Ramon Valley in
Danville, Calif., Monte Vista (or MV, for short) has
long been a hotbed not for Stanford, but for its rival
from the East Bay. Cal coach Jeff Tedford resides in
the town and Berkeley coaches have been a fixture at
the Mustangs' practices and games. But when
Whalen, who received offers almost exclusively from
schools at the FCS level, chose to become a member
of the Cardinal, he set off a chain of events that have
led Stanford to create an imprint at Monte Vista.
"The way you might establish a pipeline from a
particular high school is when you land a kid early on
like Ryan Whalen, who has a positive experience and
shares that message with people at his high school
the coaches, players and families," said Stanford out
side linebackers coach and recruiting coordinator
Lance Anderson. "They're hearing good things about
Stanford, and we like the kid and what he brings and
we think it's because of what he learned in high
school."
Whalen echoed Anderson's comments.
"The coaches are going to want guys from certain
schools that have produced results," he said. "They
might think he's a similar type of guy. Good funda-
mentals, good work ethic, good
coaching in high school."
Two years after Whalen matricu
lated, Zach Ertz, the nation's No. 4-
rated tight end, made his way from
Monte Vista to the Farm. The suc
cess of his former teammate was a
major factor in his decision.
"Ryan had a big influence on my
recruitment because he kind of
opened the door for me," Ertz said.
"Since he was so successful his first
couple of years here I think it defi
nitely helped Brett and myself out."
"Brett" is Brett Nottingham, a
true freshman quarterback who
was the 14th-ranked quarterback in
his class and who some consider to
be Andrew Luck's heir apparent. A
long-time UCLA commit, he made
a late switch to Stanford last Janu
ary. His former Monte Vista team
mates were in his ear throughout
the process.
"Every now and then I would let
him know about Stanford and how
well we were doing at the time and
that he should be a part of it," Ertz
said. "As signing day came closer
and closer he began thinking more
seriously about Stanford and then
he made the choice to de-commit

from UCLA and come to Stanford.
I would say I had a part in the deci
sion for him to come here, but ulti
mately it was his decision."
In Danville, a small town with a
tight football community, that
communication is essential.
Whalen's father talked to Notting
ham's during the latter's recruit
ment; all three players have known
each other for the majority of their
lives. When they return home from
the Farm, their relationship is on
full display.
"We will come home for a week
end and the first thing all three of us
want to do is have Brett throw
routes to Ryan and me," Ertz said.
"After the work on the field we usu
ally go into the weight room and
work out in there."
Thanks in part to the Cardinal's
success, Monte Vista head coach
Craig Bergman has noticed a shift
at the school.
"By having those three at Stan
ford, it has made it a very talked
about program at MV," he said.
"I'm an Arizona alumnus and I root
for Stanford in every game, includ
ing the U of A game."
The result is that, in a short time
frame, Monte Vista has become a
feeder for the Farm. The idea of a
feeder school is not foreign in col
lege sports, but it's harder to estab
lish with Stanford, where academics
play a large role in the recruiting

process.
Still, Stanford has some feeders.
Chapparal and Hamilton High
Schools in Arizona are two exam
ples, and Anderson is comfortable
adding Monte Vista to that list,
which has positive, symbiotic rami
fications.
"There are specific kids that we
target. But when we're in an area,
there are specific schools that we
visit because while they may not
have anyone for us now, they might
have kids later," he said.
One such player was wide re
ceiver Bryce McGovern, a current
senior at Monte Vista who, Berman
said, is "cut from the same mold" as
Whalen, Nottingham and Ertz.
Both Bergman and Ertz specu
lated that, much like Whalen, Mc-
Govern would have a chance to
come to the Farm as a recruited
walk-on. Instead, like many MV
athletes before him, he verbally
committed to Cal last week.
Such is the recruiting game. But
even if you don't land every player,
there is still tremendous value in
having a presence at a place like
Monte Vista.
"Any time you have three kids
like this, it's one of those schools,"
Anderson said. "Hopefully we can
keep that going."

Before Ryan Whalen became an NFL draft
prospect, the Cardinal's No. 1 receiver and a scholar
ship athlete, he was a recruited walk-on player from a
school an hour north of the Farm that hadn't sent a
player to Stanford since 1998. Four years and a couple
of big, four-star commits later, Monte Vista High
School is considered a pipeline for Cardinal football
recruiting.
Located in the heart of the San Ramon Valley in
Danville, Calif., Monte Vista (or MV, for short) has
long been a hotbed not for Stanford, but for its rival
from the East Bay. Cal coach Jeff Tedford resides in
the town and Berkeley coaches have been a fixture at
the Mustangs' practices and games. But when
Whalen, who received offers almost exclusively from
schools at the FCS level, chose to become a member
of the Cardinal, he set off a chain of events that have
led Stanford to create an imprint at Monte Vista.
"The way you might establish a pipeline from a
particular high school is when you land a kid early on
like Ryan Whalen, who has a positive experience and
shares that message with people at his high school
the coaches, players and families," said Stanford out
side linebackers coach and recruiting coordinator
Lance Anderson. "They're hearing good things about
Stanford, and we like the kid and what he brings and
we think it's because of what he learned in high
school."
Whalen echoed Anderson's comments.
"The coaches are going to want guys from certain
schools that have produced results," he said. "They
might think he's a similar type of guy. Good funda-
mentals, good work ethic, good
coaching in high school."
Two years after Whalen matricu
lated, Zach Ertz, the nation's No. 4-
rated tight end, made his way from
Monte Vista to the Farm. The suc
cess of his former teammate was a
major factor in his decision.
"Ryan had a big influence on my
recruitment because he kind of
opened the door for me," Ertz said.
"Since he was so successful his first
couple of years here I think it defi
nitely helped Brett and myself out."
"Brett" is Brett Nottingham, a
true freshman quarterback who
was the 14th-ranked quarterback in
his class and who some consider to
be Andrew Luck's heir apparent. A
long-time UCLA commit, he made
a late switch to Stanford last Janu
ary. His former Monte Vista team
mates were in his ear throughout
the process.
"Every now and then I would let
him know about Stanford and how
well we were doing at the time and
that he should be a part of it," Ertz
said. "As signing day came closer
and closer he began thinking more
seriously about Stanford and then
he made the choice to de-commit

from UCLA and come to Stanford.
I would say I had a part in the deci
sion for him to come here, but ulti
mately it was his decision."
In Danville, a small town with a
tight football community, that
communication is essential.
Whalen's father talked to Notting
ham's during the latter's recruit
ment; all three players have known
each other for the majority of their
lives. When they return home from
the Farm, their relationship is on
full display.
"We will come home for a week
end and the first thing all three of us
want to do is have Brett throw
routes to Ryan and me," Ertz said.
"After the work on the field we usu
ally go into the weight room and
work out in there."
Thanks in part to the Cardinal's
success, Monte Vista head coach
Craig Bergman has noticed a shift
at the school.
"By having those three at Stan
ford, it has made it a very talked
about program at MV," he said.
"I'm an Arizona alumnus and I root
for Stanford in every game, includ
ing the U of A game."
The result is that, in a short time
frame, Monte Vista has become a
feeder for the Farm. The idea of a
feeder school is not foreign in col
lege sports, but it's harder to estab
lish with Stanford, where academics
play a large role in the recruiting

process.
Still, Stanford has some feeders.
Chapparal and Hamilton High
Schools in Arizona are two exam
ples, and Anderson is comfortable
adding Monte Vista to that list,
which has positive, symbiotic rami
fications.
"There are specific kids that we
target. But when we're in an area,
there are specific schools that we
visit because while they may not
have anyone for us now, they might
have kids later," he said.
