# Enjoying the whole Super Bowl
## 
### Jacob Jaffe 
Super Bowl Sunday is almost
upon us. Few events in
sports, in pop culture and in
life resonate with the na
tion enough to have a day
set aside for as many people as Super
Bowl Sunday. Hardcore football fans,
casual sports fans, Black Eyed Peas
fans, fans of commercials and anyone
connected to any of those groups all
come together for one Sunday of foot
ball.
And for once, I honestly don't care
who wins. At all.
As anyone who has read my col
umn or been within 10 feet of me in the
past decade knows, I'm a pretty big In
dianapolis Colts fan. That also comes
with the corollary of hating the New
England Patriots (all of them, not just
the Justin Bieber look-alike at quarter
back or their coach, Oscar "cutoff
hoody" Grouch).
These two allegiances alone have
given me a clear rooting interest in six
of the past nine Super Bowls. Add in a
general preference for the underdog
(hello, NFC West) and I've had a pret
ty easy time making my decision the
past decade. Only the boredom-induc
ing blowout of Super Bowl XXXV (I'll
never understand how a team quarter
backed by Trent Dilfer won by 27)
stands out in my memory as a game I
really didn't care about.
But here we are: Green Bay Pack
ers and Pittsburgh Steelers. Two his
toric franchises the first Super
Bowl winners and the most prolific
Super Bowl winners, respectively.

Two good quarterbacks (Ben Roeth
lisberger with the rings and the vague
terms like "intangibles," "leadership"
and "toughness," and Aaron Rodgers
as "way more than Brett Favre's re
placement") with something in their
pasts that makes you a little skeptical
(Roethlisberger's rape allegations,
Rodgers' alma mater). Two good de
fenses, neither of which has anything
more polarizing than Troy Pola
malu's hair. Two good coaches, nei
ther of which has much of anything
polarizing.
However I look at it, there's just no
clear-cut team to root for. Growing up
with a Vikings fan for a mom, I could
never really like the Packers... but
Favre is gone and they're not nearly as
hate-inducing now.TTie Steelers have
always been one of those teams peo
ple hate, but they're much less of the
"big, bad Steelers" now, and the main
thing to hate about them seems to be
Roethlisberger... but I loved watch
ing him in college.
So the moral of the story is this: I
don't care who wins. It's certainly a
weird feeling, but I'm excited for the
change. I'm excited to watch a Super
Bowl just to watch the game.
And really, unless you're a hard
core fan (or hater) of one of the teams,
Super Bowl Sunday is about so much
more than the game.

Super Bowl Sunday is about the
prop bets (my money is on heads, de
ferring, short national anthem and
odd-numbered jersey for the first
touchdown scorer). It's about the
Super Bowl parties. It's about eating
nachos and wings and hot dogs and
burgers and drinking soda and water
and tea and juice and milk (no one
would think about drinking alcohol on
Super Bowl Sunday, of course).
It's about making those score
charts where your grandma and that
sketchy guy your friend brought win
the biggest prizes after one team has
two extra points blocked and the
score ends up 26-12. It's about playing
games and throwing darts and getting
shushed by your sister when the com
mercials come on.

And maybe, after all that, it's
about the game. Sure, I love sports as
much as anyone, and football most of
all. I become more furious with refs
than John McEnroe, and I will eat you
alive faster than Joey Chestnut if you
block the TV during the game. I want
to see every play of every game and
hear what the analysts have to say
about each play, even if it's just Tony
Siragusa talking about being hungry
or someone explaining the rules of
football to Terry Bradshaw.
But Super Bowl Sunday is about
more than just the game, and for just
this once, I'm excited to enjoy the
whole thing.
