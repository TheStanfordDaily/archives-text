# Enjoying the whole Super Bowl
## 
### Jacob Jaffe 
Super Bowl Sunday is almost
upon us. Few events in
sports, in pop culture and in
life resonate with the na
tion enough to have a day
set aside for as many people as Super
Bowl Sunday. Hardcore football fans,
casual sports fans, Black Eyed Peas
fans, fans of commercials and anyone
connected to any of those groups all
come together for one Sunday of foot
ball.
And for once, I honestly don't care
who wins. At all.
As anyone who has read my col
umn or been within 10 feet of me in the
past decade knows, I'm a pretty big In
dianapolis Colts fan. That also comes
with the corollary of hating the New
England Patriots (all of them, not just
the Justin Bieber look-alike at quarter
back or their coach, Oscar "cutoff
hoody" Grouch).
These two allegiances alone have
given me a clear rooting interest in six
of the past nine Super Bowls. Add in a
general preference for the underdog
(hello, NFC West) and I've had a pret
ty easy time making my decision the
past decade. Only the boredom-induc
ing blowout of Super Bowl XXXV (I'll
never understand how a team quarter
backed by Trent Dilfer won by 27)
stands out in my memory as a game I
really didn't care about.
But here we are: Green Bay Pack
ers and Pittsburgh Steelers. Two his
toric franchises the first Super
Bowl winners and the most prolific
Super Bowl winners, respectively.
