# BACK IN THE WIN COLUMN
## 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH DESK EDITOR 
After going 2-2 on its recent road trip, including
3-0 losses against Hawaii and Long Beach State,
the men's volleyball team found comfort in its
home arena of Burnham Pavilion last night,
where No. 4 Stanford defeated Pacific, 3-1.
After a tight first set that could have gone ei
ther way, the Cardinal appeared to be on its way
to a resounding sweep with a dominating second
set.The two teams traded the first few points, but
a seven-point run put the set out of reach early
at 11-4. Stanford (6-2, 4-2 MPSF) pulled away
and finished off the Tigers (4-5,1-4) 25-12 to go
up two games to none in the match.
After leading for the first half of the third set,
Stanford cooled down. In the first two games, the
Cardinal was hitting .613 as a team, led by junior
outside hitter Brad Lawson and his 13 kills.
However, the third set saw a Stanford attack that
more closely resembled the losses to Hawaii and
Long Beach, when the passing game fell apart
and too many attack errors ended up being very
costly.
To their credit, the Tigers fought hard and got
an outstanding effort from outside hitter Taylor
Hughes. The redshirt sophomore had 22 kills,
five blocks and five digs, as well a team-high hit
ting percentage of .357.
With Stanford up 22-19, Pacific reeled off six
straight points to take the third set, 25-22 four
of the points came off of Stanford attack errors.
After Pacific used its newfound momentum
to jump out to an early 3-1 lead on three straight
kills by Hughes, it looked like Stanford may be in
trouble. But the Cardinal battled back, led by six
Lawson kills, from a 17-14 deficit to tie the score
at 20. That's when freshman Brian Cook took
over, notching two kills, including the match
winner, to seal the victory.
Lawson finished the match with 23 kills and
just four errors an impressive hitting percent
age of .487. Junior setter Evan Barry also had a
big game with 50 assists and six digs while run
ning an efficient offense that ended up hitting
.363 for the match.
"I thought we played really well tonight,"
Lawson said. "After Long Beach we said it's time
to buckle down and we started to work on things

we really needed to improve.
"Tonight I was just taking the ball and hitting
it high and hard," he added. "I think I kind of got
away from that these past two weekends so it
was on me to be aggressive and just go out and
take my swings, which I think helped me
tonight."
The match was a brief rest from the road, as
Stanford heads right back out to play at Lewis
University and Loyola Chicago this weekend,
where the wind chill is 20 degrees below freezing
and the crowd is "really intense and hostile," ac
cording to head coach John Kosty.
"This was a big win, because it's the MPSF,
every win is big," Kosty said. "You're playing for
a national championship every match because
any match can kick you out of the national title
hunt, and everyone knows it. But that's why
everyone loves playing in the MPSF."
