## Card looks to stay hot in Arizona 
### NATE ADAMS MANAGING EDITOR 
After one of its best starts to a conference sea
son in program history, it's tough to know where
Stanford women's basketball could focus on im

three-pointers this season on 43.5 percent shoot

signifying that she could be nominated for the
sport's highest individual award.
Pohlen's banner season has been complement
ed by the solid play of junior shooting guard Lindy
La Rocque, who's started in 13 straight games
