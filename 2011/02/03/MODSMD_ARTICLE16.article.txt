## Card looks to stay hot in Arizona 
### NATE ADAMS MANAGING EDITOR 
After one of its best starts to a conference sea
son in program history, it's tough to know where
Stanford women's basketball could focus on im
proving. The No. 3 Cardinal (18-2, 9-0 Pac-10) is
the only undefeated team in the Pac-10, having
outscored its opponents by a school-record 321
points over nine conference contests. No oppo
nent has come closer than 26.
But as the Cardinal opens its back nine at Ari
zona State (13-6,5-4) tonight, Stanford can start
counting the games left before the postseason on
its fingers, and that means getting better is still a
major goal.
"I think if we just focus on the different things
we're good at,which is a lot of things... Ithinkwe
can keep moving up the curve," said junior for
ward Nnemakdi Ogwumike. "I don't really see
any downhill from here, we're just getting better
and better each day."
Stanford's versatility has been a huge part of its
record-setting dominance this season, with strong
play on the perimeter adding some flexibility for a
team that, over the past few seasons, relied heavi
ly on interior play from the likes of recent gradu
ate and All-American Jayne Appel.
Senior point guard Jeanette Pohlen is making
a run at her own All-American honors this season,
scoring double-digit points in 17 games and aver
aging a team-best 16.5 per game. She's made 57
three-pointers this season on 43.5 percent shoot
ing, and had her 100 th assist of the season against
Oregon State last Saturday. Just yesterday, she was
added to the State Farm Wade Trophy Watch List,
signifying that she could be nominated for the
sport's highest individual award.
Pohlen's banner season has been complement
ed by the solid play of junior shooting guard Lindy
La Rocque, who's started in 13 straight games
after getting the call just three times in her past two
seasons. Pohlen may have more court time and as
sists, but La Rocque is a nimble ball handler, boast-
ing a team-best 2.9 assist-to-turnover
ratio.
Stanford's unusually excellent
guards have opened things up for
Stanford's traditional strengths, the
post players.
"It avoids doubles and clogs in the
paint," Ogwumike said. "It's always
great to have great guards because
they facilitate the offense, and when
you have guards that can score, it's the
best thing ever. There's not much re
bounding you have to worry about be
cause all their shots are going in, and
it's just a lot of fun for everybody."
Pohlen does miss shots, but Ogwu
mike's remark was nearly true in the
team's last outing against ASU. Stan
ford hosted the Sun Devils on Jan. 8,
and beat them in an 82-35 rout, hum
bling a team that amassed a 10-3
record beforehand. Pohlen put up a
game-high 18 points in just 24 minutes,
shooting 7-for-10 from the field and a
perfect 2-for-2 from beyond the arc.
ASU has endured a month of alter
nating wins and losses since then, split
ting its last six contests. Most recently,
the team edged out USC in a 62-61

nail-biter in Los Angeles. Senior for
ward BeccaTobin had 12 points in the
contest, including 10 in the second half
and the game winner, as the Sun Dev
ils moved into a three-way tie with
USC and Cal for third place in the Pac
-10.
Stanford may be facing ASU on
the road this time, but the trip will be a
homecoming of sorts for one Cardinal
player. Senior forward Kayla Peder
sen grew up in Fountain Hills, Ariz.,
and has a history of good performanc
es in nearby Tempe. In her three previ
ous visits, she's averaged 13.7 points,
6.7 rebounds and 46.0 percent shoot
ing.
Pedersen recently became Stan
ford's all-time leader in career min
utes, surpassing Virginia Sourlis' mark
of 4,148 set from 1982-1986.
"Kayla can do anything you ask
her," Ogwumike said. "And most min
utes played, that's just the number-one
indicator of how much we need her.
She's a very wise player and very expe
rienced ... she's definitely a scholar of
the game."
Stanford plays ASU tonight in
Tempe at 5:30 p.m., and then heads to
Tucson to face the Arizona Wildcats
on Saturday at 1 p.m.
