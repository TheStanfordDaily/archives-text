### Wyndam Makowsky 
The Stanford football program
had a busy Wednesday, as it an
nounced its new slate of coordina
tors amid the bustle of National
Signing Day.
The Cardinal promoted Pep
Hamilton from wide receivers
coach to offensive coordinator. He
will also coach quarterbacks. Derek
Mason, who coached defensive
backs last season and will retain
that responsibility, was promoted to
associate head coach and co-defen
sive coordinator.
"Derek is excited about the op
portunity to take on a bigger role in
leading our team and defense," said
head coach David Shaw in a release,
"Derek is a guy who we have always
leaned on for game planning pur
poses and to motivate our players to
play at their highest level."
Joining him as the other co-de
fensive coordinator will be Jason
Tarver, the newest member of the
staff who comes to the Farm from
the San Francisco 49ers, where he
coached outside linebackers. Tarv
er, who was born at Stanford and at
tended nearby Foothill High
School, will also coach the inside
linebackers for the Cardinal. Stan
ford has shown an affinity for NFL
coaches in recent seasons, and Tarv
er brings 10 years of experience at
that level to the staff.
"He has been very successful in
training linebackers for the system
we run," Shaw said. "His hiring was
a no-brainer. We are very excited to
have Jason on board."
The Cardinal had openings after
Shaw was promoted from offensive
coordinator to head coach, and de
fensive coordinator Vic Fangio and
associate head coach Greg Roman
left the Farm to join Jim Harbaugh
with the Niners.
This will be the 36-year-oldTarv
er's first coordinator job, while both
Mason and Hamilton have brief ex
perience in their roles, both at the

FCS/Dl-AA level Mason at St.
Mary's, Hamilton at Howard.
Hamilton was slated to be the co
offensive coordinator at New Mex
ico last season before abruptly leav
ing Albuquerque for Stanford. He
called the Cardinal's red zone plays
last season; Stanford finished with
the nation's ninth-best scoring per
centage from inside the 20, convert
ing at an 89 percent clip.
"Pep is more than ready for this
job," Shaw said. "He did a great job
for us last year. He brought new
concepts to our offense, which were
invaluable for us in the red zone
and was a big part of our success in
the passing game all season."
With the hirings, Stanford has
rounded out its defensive staff, but
still has a number of vacancies on
the offensive side of the ball.
