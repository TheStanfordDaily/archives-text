The University announced last
week plans to require new fraterni
ty pledges to take a one unit course
discussing issues pertinent to the
Greek community, including alco
hol safety, beginning this spring
quarter. Residential Education's
Fraternity and Sorority Life divi
sion plans to use this class to incor

"[ResEd is] acknowledging the
necessity for enhancing new mem

Rodriguez said.
Fraternities' responses to the
new rules have been mixed. Nik Mi

Fraternity Council (IFC), which
represents most of the fraternities
on campus, blames this on a lack of
communication.
"Most of the feedback about this
class has been questions about the
class, the format whether it's
mandatory, whose idea it was, et
cetera," he said. "There hasn't been
a lot of positive feedback, but
there's a lack of information out
there about the class."
Cody Sam 'l2, president of the
Theta Delta Chi fraternity, said the
class could hurt the fraternities and
serve to discourage students from
rushing in the spring.
"It hurts the potential rushees
who are on the fence about joining
a fraternity more than anyone else,"
he said. "In Theta Delt, more than
