## ResEd to expand reqs for pledges Greeks may be required to take alcohol course 
### BRENDAN O'BYRNE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The University announced last
week plans to require new fraterni
ty pledges to take a one unit course
discussing issues pertinent to the
Greek community, including alco
hol safety, beginning this spring
quarter. Residential Education's
Fraternity and Sorority Life divi
sion plans to use this class to incor
porate new policies and better edu
cate new pledges.
"[ResEd is] acknowledging the
necessity for enhancing new mem
ber education," Amanda Ro
driguez, assistant director of Resi
dential Education and Greek pro
gram advisor, wrote in an e-mail to
The Daily.
Rodriguez said that while ResEd
has laid out ideas, "movement to en
gage the leadership of the Greek
community in the conceptual
process is ongoing, so no details are
final at this time."
The most widely discussed pro
posal includes a potential class or
seminar held during spring quarter
that would be mandatory for all
sorority and fraternity pledges. This
proved unpopular among current
actives and is now under further dis
cussion. As of now, the class is being
proposed as "Athletics 1."
"The viability of a class or semi
nar format is still being explored,"
Rodriguez said.
Fraternities' responses to the
new rules have been mixed. Nik Mi
lanovi_ 'll, president of the Inter-
Fraternity Council (IFC), which
represents most of the fraternities
on campus, blames this on a lack of
communication.
"Most of the feedback about this
class has been questions about the
class, the format whether it's
mandatory, whose idea it was, et
cetera," he said. "There hasn't been
a lot of positive feedback, but
there's a lack of information out
there about the class."
Cody Sam 'l2, president of the
Theta Delta Chi fraternity, said the
class could hurt the fraternities and
serve to discourage students from
rushing in the spring.
"It hurts the potential rushees
who are on the fence about joining
a fraternity more than anyone else,"
he said. "In Theta Delt, more than
half of our membership says that
they initially thought they would
never join a fraternity. Athletics 1
would do a lot of harm to the frater
nity system at Stanford."
Sam also raised concern that the
administration proposed this class
without contacting any of the fra
ternities beforehand.
"The people who are most af
fected by this change shouldn't be

involved in the deliberations as an
afterthought," he said.
Milanovi_ echoed this senti
ment, saying the main complaint
he's received from fraternities is
that they feel left out of the process.
"Fraternities are generally upset
about the fact that they feel this is
being imposed on them, a decision
made without their consent or ap
proval," he said, adding that Greek
program administrators will be
talking to the fraternities over the
next few weeks to try and work out
a better solution.
Rodriguez declined to elaborate
on details about a timeline for the
decision-making process or other
educational avenues being dis
cussed.
