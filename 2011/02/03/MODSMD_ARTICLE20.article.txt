### CAROLINE CASELLI MANAGING EDITOR 
Home at Maples Pavilion for the second consecutive
week, the Stanford men's basketball team has its first
opportunity to avenge an early-season loss tonight
when it takes on No. 21 Arizona (18-4,7-2 Pac-10) for
the second time in just over three weeks.
The youthful Cardinal squad (11-9,4-5) has been in
consistent both at home and on the road this season, but
appeared closest to fulfilling its potential in a 14-point
victory over Oregon State last Saturday that successful
ly halted a four-game losing streak. Head coach Johnny
Dawinks was pleased with what seemed to be a turning
point for his team and hopes that the win will be a cata
lyst for success in the season's remaining weeks.
"I'd like to see us continue to build off of this last
game that we just played," Dawkins said. "I thought we
made a lot of connecting plays, [had] a lot of trust in one
another's teammates and really shared the ball well.
And that's exciting."
The matchup will not be an easy one, as the Card
faces one of its toughest opponents in Arizona. At the
season's halfway mark, the Wildcats are one of the
teams to beat in the Pac-10, boasting the most wins in
the conference (18) and currently sitting atop the con
ference standings, tied with No. 19 Washington.
However, both of Arizona's conference losses have
come on the road against Oregon State and Washing
ton, two teams that Stanford has already beaten.
In their last run-in, which was postponed one day in
light of the Jan. 8 shootings in Tucson, Stanford led the
game early on, but was unable to answer Arizona's solid
perimeter shooting and several large runs, ultimately
losing, 67-57.
Senior Jamelle Home was especially potent, going 4-
for-4 on threes and 6-for-7 overall, while sophomore
Derrick Williams added another 14 points. Williams has
led the Wildcats both offensively and defensively all
season, averaging 19.8 points per game on 63.8 shooting
from the field and 7.6 rebounds.
Tomorrow's game will showcase the league's pre
miere offensive and defensive squads. Arizona, who av
erages 77.2 points per game, leads the Pac-10 and is
ranked 18th nationally with its 48.3-percent shooting
percentage. On the opposite end of the floor, the Cardi
nal defense allows the least points per game in the con
ference, at 60.7.
Though Arizona owns victories in its last four games
against Stanford (and a 52-29 overall advantage in the
series), several Cardinal players have excelled against
the Wildcats. Junior Jeremy Green has scored 81 points
in five appearances against Arizona, an average of 16.2
points per game, and classmate Jarrett Mann is 10-for
-13 from the field in four career meetings. Redshirt jun
ior Josh Owens, who continues to show his resurgence
from an undisclosed injury that kept him off the court
last season, paced the Card in the January game, tally
ing 18 points and three rebounds.
In the Cardinal's last game against Oregon State,
however, it was freshman Anthony Brown who

emerged as an offensive threat with 21 points, leading
Stanford to a crucial victory over the Beavers.
"He's on the upswing. He's improving," Dawkins
said of Brown. "I think that's always exciting, and I
think that gives you energy, just seeing yourself start to
make some of the plays he's made,"
With two games left on the Farm before a trying road
trip north to the Washington schools, Dawkins is opti
mistic that his team can learn to win, independent of the
venue.
"We're just taking it one game at a time," he said. "Of
course, we're happy like any team to be playing at
home, but no matter what, you know, you have to com
pete and you have to prepare the same way.
"For our guys, I'm just trying to keep them focused
on the game we're playing, not as much on where we're
playing," he added.
Tipoff is set for 6 p.m. tonight at Maples Pavilion.
