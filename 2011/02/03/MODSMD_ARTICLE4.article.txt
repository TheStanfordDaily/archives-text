# Stress stings first-year students
## Incoming freshmen are at historical emotional low 
### SAMANTHA MCGIRR SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
College freshmen nationwide are suffering from
record levels of stress, an annual survey of incoming stu
dents recently conducted by UCLA found. This trend
was echoed in the sentiments of Stanford faculty and ad
ministrators.
According to the survey, "The American Freshman:
National Norms Fall 2010," administered by the Cooper
ative Institutional Research Program (CIRP) at UCLA's
Higher Education Research Institute, fewer students
than ever consider themselves to be in high emotional
health. Only 51.9 percent of students reported their emo
tional health to be "above average," a marked decline
from the 63.6 percent who did so in the first year of the
survey, 1985.
Female students were less likely to report "above av
erage" emotional health, with 45.9 percent of women and
59.1 percent of men placing themselves in that category.
Linda DeAngelo, assistant director for research at
CIRP, says the findings reveal the growing psychological
effects of the economic recession on the American col
lege student.
"This year's freshman class has been seeing the effects
of the economy for several years," DeAngelo said. "These
freshmen have been seeing their friends and relatives
graduate from college and not get jobs. And they increas
ingly have to cobble together funds from multiple sources
to go to college."
Faculty and administrators at Stanford report that
they have observed increases in student stress over the
past few years consistent with the findings of the survey.
Dr. Ronald Albucher, director of Counseling and Psy
chological Services (CAPS) at Vaden Health Center, re
ports that CAPS has seen a "larger number of students
coming through" in recent years. According to him, ap
proximately 14 percent of the student population, includ
ing both graduate and undergraduate students, utilizes
the center's services at some point in the academic year.
He estimates another 6 to 7 percent seek services off
campus.
Albucher echoed DeAngelo's sentiment that econom
ic belt-tightening may be a significant source of student
stress.
"The recession has had a pervasive effect in every
body's life," he said. "Students have to consider their abil
ity to afford college, their prospects for employment and
economic issues within their family."
Professor Cliff Nass, the resident fellow for the all
freshman dorm Otero, points to another factor more pro
nounced at elite schools such as Stanford: extremely high
levels of personal drive and achievement.
"The kids that get into Stanford have had pressure
filled lives since they were young," Nass said. "Their am
bitions to get into Stanford started very, very early, and
they've been stressed for so long
that it cumulates while they're in
college."
Furthermore, Nass said that the
pressure to excel has moved be
yond the classroom, such that many
Stanford stu
dents come tc
see their

relation
ships and interactions with fellow
students as sources of stress.
"Increasingly, Stanford students
are worrying about social excel
lence," he said. "Social life is no
longer relaxing it's another do
main at which to excel. And that's
sad."

Albucher suggests, however,
that it might not be fair to associate
student stress levels so heavily with
an environment of excellence.
"When you look at the big pic
ture, you don't see that the rates of
mental health problems are more
significant here [at Stanford] than
at any other school," he said. "Stu
dents are actually healthier and
safer when they come to college,
from both a physical and mental
health perspective. They have ac
cess to insurance, clinical services
and feel like part of a commu
nity."
As for the notion that fe
male students are more
likely to suffer from high
levels of stress, Albucher
says this discrepancy may
arise more from differ
ences in reporting than
from actual emotional
differences between the
genders.
"Female stu
dents are more likely to
talk about it [the stress]
■ and more likely to seek
out help," he said. "In
general, male students
tend to drink more and become
more aggressive in response to
being overwhelmed. Males are
taught to be more independent, but
this is changing, which is a good
thing."
