## Rice announces support for ROTC reinstatement 
### KATE ABBOTT DEPUTY EDITOR 
Professor Condoleezza Rice recently
announced her support for the "full rein
statement" of the Reserve Officer Train
ing Corps (ROTC) at Stanford.
Her support came in the form of a let
ter co-signed by former Secretary of State
and Hoover fellow George Shultz on Jan.
27. The letter was addressed to the ad hoc
committee currently investigating the
issue and was made public to The Daily on
Wednesday afternoon.
"Given the complexities of the threats
we face and the missions we demand of
our military in the twenty-first century,
this is an appropriate and necessary time
for the Faculty Senate to restore ROTC
programs to Stanford's campus," the let
ter stated. "We can think of no better way

to prepare future servicemen and women
many of whom will become national
leaders than by enriching them with a
Stanford education."
This showing of support comes is the
latest development in the ongoing debate
surrounding ROTC. Several petitions
about the issue began circulating among
the student body last week.
When asked if the committee had any
response to the letter, chair Ewart
Thomas, professor of psychology, de
clined to comment.
"The committee is in 'retreat' so that
we can figure out what should be done,"
he wrote in an e-mail to The Daily.
