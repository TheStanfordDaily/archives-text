Members of the Stanford com
munity gathered Wednesday after

ing the perceived gap between
those who serve in the military and

civilians. CISAC Fellow Colonel

military strategy; the event was
hosted this year in conjunction with
the Stanford Military Service Net
work.

Col. Sheffield discusses the civilian-military gap at the first Military 101
seminar. This series of speakers is part of an effort from the Stanford Military
Service Network to give students a better understanding of the
armed forces.
providing information about the
military to the general public.
"We want to put action to the
phrase 'bridging the civil-military
gap' and give Stanford students a
chance to learn a little bit more
about an organization," Iyer wrote
in an e-mail to The Daily.
In spite of the recent controver
sy regarding ROTC's possible re
turn to Stanford among the LGBT
community, Iyer said that "the work
of the Stanford Military Service
Network is less about addressing
the ROTC situation," and more
about improving understanding of
the armed forces among students
and faculty.
The event, held at the Haas Cen
ter, consisted of a presentation
defining the U.S. Military, its con
stituents, its primary objectives and
its benefits.
According to Sheffield, much of
the civilian-military gap can be at-

tributed to the fact that only a small
proportion of the population serves
in the military. He hopes that events
like Military 101 can help remedy
this.
"One of the common misunder

standings is that we in the military
are the ones who decide to go to
war, or create barriers to entry,"
Sheffield said. "We're not the ones
who do this; these decisions are
made by politicians, not by those
who serve."
Sheffield described the military
as America's "oldest, largest,
busiest [and] most successful com
pany," and said that it represents
the country's "sons and daughters."
The U.S. army consists of 5.2 million
people, with 1.4 million on active
duty, and operates from more than
6,000 locations.
Sheffield shared some of his per
sonal experiences of serving in the
military, from his training to his
doubting the possibility of going to
war in Iraq, in hopes of providing
the audience with an additional
perspective.
Military 101, which was held in
Tresidder Union last year, was co
ordinated in the past through a
partnership with the Truman Ser
vice Initiative.
