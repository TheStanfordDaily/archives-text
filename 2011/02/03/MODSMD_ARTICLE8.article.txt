## Intel invests $100M in University research Tech giant funds first center location on Farm 
### ISAAC GATENO STAFF WRITER 
Intel will invest $lOO million over
the next five years on university re
search in the U.S. The new project
aims to create roughly half a dozen
Intel Science and Technology Cen
ters (ISTC) on college campuses
across the country, the first of which
will be headquartered at Stanford.
These centers will be based on a
new model that allows for re
searchers from the tech giant to
collaborate more closely with aca
demics, Intel announced Jan. 26.
Computer science professor Pat
Hanrahan will lead the Intel Sci
ence and Technology Center for
Visual Computing (ISTC-VC). Re
search at this center will focus on

new graphics heavy devices such as
tablets, mobile phones and 3D dis
plays.
According to Hanrahan, this
type of investment is a natural de
velopment. Companies realize that
"if they create a whole ecosystem of
ideas, they all benefit from it," he
said.
He was adamant that programs
such as this one would benefit the
academic community. Stanford, in
particular, is a location where the in
fluence of Silicon Valley has created
a "healthy, vibrant economic scene."
While the center will be adminis
tered from the Farm where eight
faculty and 13 graduate students will
work research will also take
place at eight more universities. In
total, 30 faculty members and 50
graduate students will be spread
around the University of Washing
