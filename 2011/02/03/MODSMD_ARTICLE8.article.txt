## Intel invests $100M in University research Tech giant funds first center location on Farm 
### ISAAC GATENO STAFF WRITER 
Intel will invest $lOO million over
the next five years on university re
search in the U.S. The new project
aims to create roughly half a dozen
Intel Science and Technology Cen
ters (ISTC) on college campuses
across the country, the first of which
will be headquartered at Stanford.
These centers will be based on a
new model that allows for re
searchers from the tech giant to
collaborate more closely with aca
demics, Intel announced Jan. 26.
Computer science professor Pat
Hanrahan will lead the Intel Sci
ence and Technology Center for
Visual Computing (ISTC-VC). Re
search at this center will focus on

new graphics heavy devices such as
tablets, mobile phones and 3D dis
plays.
According to Hanrahan, this
type of investment is a natural de
velopment. Companies realize that
"if they create a whole ecosystem of
ideas, they all benefit from it," he
said.
He was adamant that programs
such as this one would benefit the
academic community. Stanford, in
particular, is a location where the in
fluence of Silicon Valley has created
a "healthy, vibrant economic scene."
While the center will be adminis
tered from the Farm where eight
faculty and 13 graduate students will
work research will also take
place at eight more universities. In
total, 30 faculty members and 50
graduate students will be spread
around the University of Washing
ton, Harvard, Princeton, Cornell
and the University of California lo
cations at Berkeley, Davis and
Irvine.
Intel personnel will also act as re
searchers-in-residence at the cen
ter, said Hanrahan. He stressed that
all of the technology will be open
source and no patents will be filed.
"Nvidia could use it," he said, re
ferring to the rival chipmaker that
also sponsors a lot of research on
the Farm. "I don't think there's any
conflict... they [all] want to in
volve what's happening in industry
into the lab."
In the spirit of maintaining an
open door, opportunities for under
graduate students to participate will
also be available, leveraging exist
ing sources of funding.
The whole project will receive
$2.5 million a year for the next five
years, of which Stanford will receive

around $1 million.
ISTC will explore almost 16 dif
ferent projects spread across four
main themes: simulation, content
creation, building graphics systems
and computer vision.
For example, researchers will ex
plore a wide range of simulations
from fluid dynamics and light to the
more mundane, like hair and cloth,
and aim to make content creation
more accessible.
"Right now Pixar can make con
tent," said Hanrahan. "We want to
make it easy for everyone to make
content."
Other projects include interfaces
that detect a user's movements, sim
ilar to Microsoft Kinect, and 3D
models that can recognize things
like doors and light switches and
make them operational.
The public will be able to follow
all of the research as the ISTC-VC
website is updated in the coming
months.
