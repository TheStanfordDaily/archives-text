## Freshmen innovators look to connect dorms with website LINK UP START-UP

r l | â€”i his chair has nostalgic value,"
I Alexander Atallah 'l4 said,
nestling himself on a nonde
script canvas chair in an
M equally nondescript fresh
man dorm room. "It's where we came up with
our business plan."
Atallah and Bryant Tan 'l4 fit the Stanford
student template to aT. Intelligent and entrepre
neurial, the two bonded over a mutual love for
Physics 61, eventually partnering up to create a
social networking website for dorms.
The site, Dormlink, allows students to con
nect with others within their dorm or house on
campus. Its features include the Corkboard,
where students can post messages and pictures,
the Stuff page, where students can catalog items
that they are willing to lend or sell, and the
Classes page, where students can find others in
the dorm taking the same classes.
Students can also integrate Google calendars
on the site, like and unlike posts, sort content by
popularity, create "profile pages" for their rooms
and create projects of their own that others can
collaborate on.
The idea for the cross between Facebook,
Craigslist, Google Docs, Courserank and dorm
mailing lists came from a casual comment in
Atallah's dorm.
"Someone said we should make a Dorm
book, a Facebook just for dorms," Atallah said.
He then approached Tan, who he had met while
working on Stanford's Solar Car Project.
Tan, an international student from London
who also photographs for The Daily, had worked
for a small software company called Firefly in the
UK. The company worked on content manage
ment systems, sites where users can create con
tent and control what they see without needing
technical knowledge.
"He told me about Firefly, and because the
idea for Dormbook was essentially to make a
content management system, I was like 'Oh that's
convenient!"'Atallah said.
They later realized that Facebook could
sue them for the name "Dormbook" if they

were ever to make profits and instead decided
on "Dormlink." So far, the website has only
been released to two all-frosh dorms in Wilbur
Hall, Cedro and Otero. But despite its limited
release, the site has experienced early popu
larity.
" In the first 24 hours we had about 2,000 hits,"
Tan said. "Now we have 113 users."
While they have ambitions to expand across
the Stanford campus, to other colleges and even
tually even overseas, their current plan is to re
lease the website to more dorms slowly, through
live demos in dorm meetings.
Atallah, The Daily's Web editor, found his
passion for programming after taking on a chal
lenge to design a website for a children's museum
in his hometown in Colorado. He had wanted to
go to debate camp but didn't have the cash, so in
stead, decided to design the site.
He went on to create applications and pro
grams to "help out companies" that he liked. An
internship at a firm in Washington, D.C. last
summer also led Atallah to build a map applica
tion that showed all the businesses in the U.S.
importing goods under a trading preference
program. The same application was later used in
lobbying the Senate Finance Commission.
"The amazing thing about CS is that you can
create cool tools that help others at no cost to
you, except time," he said.
Indeed, the only cost Atallah and Tan have in
curred so far is printing. Even Atallah's laptop,
which hosts the website, is held open by a granola
bar to prevent it from falling asleep.
"There are programs that prevent Macs from
falling asleep," Atallah clarified.
"But the granola bar is better,"Tan said, citing
its cost-effectiveness in comparison to purchased
software.
Like Atallah,Tan has extensive programming
experience he began programming at age 13.
"I found tutorials online and found code ex
amples and kind of worked it out," he explained.
"We can pretty much put on our business plan
that Bryant [Tan] can code and do physics faster
than any of your people can," Atallah joked,
likening Tan to Facebook's creator, Mark
Zuckerberg "but faster."
Tan first started creating "dynamic websites"
when a friend asked him to make a site related to

football.
"But by football I mean soccer, not egghand,"
he laughed, poking his British humor at Ameri
can football. "Or handegg, rather."
The pair balances each other out well. Atal
lah comes from a strong debate and youth-in
government background and is considering a
degree in economics, physics, computer science
or symbolic systems. Tan, who completed A-
Levels similar to Advanced Placement
courses in the U.S. in the UK and was the top
scorer in the country in Physics, did not take a
single humanities course in his last two years of
high school. He is considering electrical engi
neering and computer science.
"They seem to work really well together," said
Professor Cliff Nass, who they consulted about
launching a start-up. "What you really want to see
from a venture capitalist point of view is passion,
and those guys have that They're both pas
sionate about solving a problem that they have
perceived."
The problem, according to Tan, is that they
"want dorms to be able to share things that mat
ter to them in a more private environment than
Facebook can allow."
Tailoring their site exclusively to such a niche
group of users gives them a unique advantage
over larger companies, they believe.
Atallah and Tan see numerous potential uses
for their site, including holding dorm elections
online or sharing photos over vacations all
privately.
"My dorm is using it to figure out what kind of

music everyone likes," Atallah said about the
"Projects" feature.
The underlying premise is that, contrary to
the global behemoth that Facebook has grown
into, the site is limited to a smaller, more inti
mate community that values privacy. This allows
for freer expression and an increased willing
ness to engage in commercial transactions via
the Stuff feature.
The enterprising freshmen are continually
thinking of new additions for Dormlink, includ
ing an interactive map feature on which people
can tag places of interest, and a "Whiteboard"
feature that would operate like Microsoft Paint,
where students can practice "Social Doodling"
on each other's virtual rooms similar to writ
ing on an actual whiteboard outside one's dorm
room.
Atallah and Tan do recognize, however, that
their ambitious start-up faces significant hur
dles.
"We recognize that something like 95 per
cent of start ups fail," Tan said.
"If people don't end up using it very much,
this will have been a fun side project," Atallah
added.
And if they happen to end up in the 5 percent
of start-ups that do succeed, Tan and Atallah will
not be the only beneficiaries Tan's roommate,
Kevin Hurlbutt 'l4, has a stake in the matter too.
Looking up from his laptop, he announced,
"I'm going to sell that chair for so much money."
