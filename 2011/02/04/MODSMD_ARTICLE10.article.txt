## A
						DREAM DEFERRED Reflections of an undocumented immigrant 
### ASHLEY MENZIES 
Fermm Mendoza 'll
comes from what he
calls a "mixed-status
family." His youngest
brother was born in
the United States and is a citizen
by birth. His older sister, a
teacher who recently married, is
a permanent resident. Mean
while, Mendoza, his parents and
his other brother, a sophomore in
college, are not legal residents.

The U.S. Senate's blockage of the
DREAM Act late last year keeps
people like Mendoza in legal limbo.
The legislation would have provided
a path to citizenship for young, un
documented immigrants who were
brought to the United States as chil
dren. Its failure leaves Mendoza, a
public policy major, looking ahead
to future activism, graduation and
where he goes from there.
Mendoza was born in Mexico
and came to the United States with
his family when he was 4 years old,
going on to attend middle and high
school in Texas. His parents had
come to the U.S. on a three-month
tourist visa and indefinitely extend
ed their stay. They moved for better
job security and to help their chil
dren pursue better educations, they
emphasized to their son.
Mendoza's parents told him at an
early age that he wasn't an Ameri
can citizen, and he was told never to
speak about his immigration status
because he "did not have papers."
Nonetheless, Mendoza grew up,
went to school and got involved in
extracurricular activities much like
any other American with his
legal status in what felt like the dis
tant background.

"I didn't feel different at all
growing up," Mendoza said. "I had
the same access to public education
in the United States. My immigrant
identity only pushed me to do better
in classes."

Mendoza considers himself
lucky. His father has worked roofing
houses for the past 16 years, and his
mother recently changed jobs from
dry cleaning to house cleaning. They
made sure Mendoza and his siblings
never worried about finances and
that their primary focus was school
work.

Mendoza did not want to work a
manual-labor job like his parents,
which motivated him further to
excel in the classroom.

"Even when I started attaining a
level of education that was higher
than theirs, I still convinced myself
that what 1 was doing was not as
hard as what they were doing," he

said about his parents.
Mendoza took his schoolwork
seriously and, in middle school, was
encouraged to apply to a program
for gifted students. The application
for the program required documen
tation of his parents' income, which,
as unauthorized immigrants, they
had difficulty providing. His coun
selors and other administrators at
the school were supportive and
helped him work around these ob
stacles, he said. He began to feel
more comfortable with his immigra
tion status.

A few years after gaining support
from his school, Mendoza felt com
fortable opening up to his peers. In
10th grade, several of his projects in
school focused on immigration and
the DREAM Act. Because his
school was 98 percent Latino, many
people were familiar and concerned
with immigration issues.
"I didn't see any reason to hide
it," said Mendoza. "I was protected
by educators at my school."
Refining a Worldview
For Mendoza, the transition to
Stanford was difficult because he
was in a radically different environ
ment. There were fewer Latino stu
dents, and he found people here less
focused on immigration issues. Inse
curities about his immigration status
sprung up again. Meanwhile, he
wrestled with being gay. He felt dif
ferent than other Stanford students
and hid those parts of his identity
from his peers during his freshman
year.
But after a fellow student made
jokes about undocumented immi
grants and pointed out that Men
doza couldn't vote, Mendoza felt it
was time to assert himself against
what he felt were ignorant views on
immigration at Stanford and nation
wide. He tried to be more honest
about his background with himself
and others.

"I struggled with thinking of my
self as a person," Mendoza said.
"What does it mean to be human?
People are calling me illegal. 1 don't
have any rights."

His sophomore year, he joined
the Stanford Immigrants Rights
Project, where the DREAM Act be
came the group's focus as it facilitat
ed President Hennessy's public sup
port of the legislation. His junior
year, he collaborated with the group
to plan Immigration Week, which
featured a series of immigrant
rights demonstrations.
Last summer, Mendoza won a
Haas Center for Public Service fel
lowship to work at Educators for
Fair Consideration, which works to
advance the educations of low-in
come (and often undocumented)
immigrant students. When his fel
lowship ended, Mendoza was ready
to enter his senior year and pre
pared to fight for the DREAM Act's
passage. After watching the House
vote in favor of the bill this fall, he
was encouraged.
"It was definitely something
new," Mendoza said. "The DREAM
Act had never passed in any cham
ber of Congress. It was a great sym
bol of support for undocumented
students at the government level."
But watching the Senate block
the bill soon afterward, he realized it
was not going to pass.
"I was sitting with my sister and I
almost cried," Mendoza said. "But I
had to hold it back."
Although Mendoza was disap
pointed, he said the vote was re-en
ergizing and that he and other pro
ponents of the bill couldn't afford to
be pessimistic. He believes there is
much more work to be done and
feels sad for those less fortunate.
"I am privileged," he said. "I'm at
Stanford. Other people don't have
that as a support."
Although Mendoza can't legally
work in the United States upon
graduation, he aspires to attend law
school. His experiences have in
spired him to help advance gay
rights and immigration reform.
"At the end of it all, I feel really
lucky to be who I am," Mendoza
said.
