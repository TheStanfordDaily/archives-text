I 1 awkward!!!"

"Soooo awkwarddddd."
"Dude, he just looks so awk
ward all the time ..."
We're a little obsessed with
awkward, aren't we? How many
times did you say awkward today?
An awkwardly large number? . . .
Err, awkward.
Anyway, hi. In this, my first col
umn, I want to tell you about the
beginnings of my obsession with
human interaction. And it all
began with an exploration of awk
wardness.

My sophomore year, I had a job
as a "Peer Network Engagement
Intern" through Hillel. In practice,
this meant that I was paid to take
Jewish undergrads out to coffee
(although I always went to Jamba
Juice because I couldn't pass up the
opportunity to say Jamba Jews ) in
order to further a sense of Stanford
Jewish community. Before you ex
claim in astonishment, remember
that my wages came from the same
people who fund free trips to Israel
for Jewish youth. Moving on. Yes,
the job undoubtedly changed my
perceptions of Judaism. But more
significantly, it completely changed
the way I have viewed my interac
tions with people, with particular
focus on the "awkward."

Have you ever been on a blind
date? Pretty awkward, right? How
about a blind platonic date? Wayyy
more awkward.

On a blind date, there is a pur
pose to your meeting. You arrive
with the expectation and goal of
evaluating the other person, per
haps as your soul mate or perhaps
as your next one-night stand. Phys
ical attraction matters in addition
to some level of personality com
patibility; I would imagine that
personality matters less if you're
looking for a fun night and is of
somewhat greater importance if
you're looking for your future
spouse. But personality also may
be less important than the physical
attraction because you can either
ignore it (one-night stand) or be
forgiving of what you don't like
(soul mate) because, hey, the next
date might go better!
My platonic dates with random
Jewish undergrads didn't have
these advantages. Both my Jewish
Jamba recipient and I knew that we
would not call each other back for
a second outing the point of my
job was to reach out to as many stu
dents as possible. Thus the idea of
platonic dating, or becoming
friends, was not really our focus.
We also knew that physical attrac
tion would not really play a part in
our interaction because we didn't
have aspirations of hooking up
later. The best we could hope for
was an hour of good conversation,

and thus personality compatibility
was of great importance.
Let's just say I met my fair share
of people with whom I was not par
ticularly compatible on any level.
A few of them made that hour of
conversation seem longer than my
two-hour Econ lectures. I would
ask questions and receive mono
syllabic answers in return; I would
embark on my own brief mono
logues and see boredom; I would
attempt to make jokes and see that
quizzical look of, "Oh, was that
supposed to be funny? Um, yeah.
Not laughing." Dare I say, I felt
awkward.

But several of my dates were
fantastic. And, interestingly, the
success of our Jamba dates did not
necessarily hinge on our compati
bility as much as something else,
the ultimate secret, the Holy Grail.
They were able to talk to me as if
we were friends already. They ig
nored the fact that we were
strangers and talked to me freely,
without reservation or hesitation.
And that prompted me to recipro
cate. We shared stories and opin
ions; sometimes it became clear
that our personalities were not very
compatible, but for that single hour,
how could we possibly run out of
things to share so long as we were
comfortable with sharing them?
After that, I couldn't have a con
versation with someone without re
ferring to my Jamba strategy of pre
tending we were already friends.
And I tried it out on everyone
the cashier at Olive's, people I met
at parties, my professors. It became
easier to meet new people and also
more rewarding when I forged new
friendships. I realized something
key that "awkwardness" lies in
your expectations of an interaction.
Do you expect to be bored? Intimi
dated? Awkwarded out? It might
happen. But if you expect a good
conversation with a friend, it might
just turn out that way.

When I realized I could talk to
strangers as if we were already
friends, everything changed. For
one thing, I now friend-holler
shamelessly at anyone and every
one (some restrictions apply). And
for another, I convinced myself to
start writing a column, because
writing a column is kind of like
treating all my readers a bunch
of whom will be strangers as if
they are my friends. So here it goes.
