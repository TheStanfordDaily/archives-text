# OBSESSIVE KOMPULSION
## In Defense of Being a Pack Rat 
### Kristian Bailey 
I have a hoarding problem. It's
not a serious issue, like not being
able to walk through my room
because I have a mammoth collec
tion of 80s Cabbage Patch Kids
dolls it's more an issue of not
being able to let go of memories and
their physical manifestations, for
fear that I'll one day regret it.
For example, until this week, I
subscribed to the Sunday New York
Times solely to do the crossword,
which appears in the magazine. De
spite this, I still felt the need to hold
onto the main section of every
paper I'd gotten in my brief sub
scription period. Maybe someday,
ten or twenty or fifty years from
now, it will bring me joy to know
that I still have a copy of the paper
from the day Don't Ask, Don't Tell
was repealed.
But why would 29,39, or 69 year
old me care when my current 19
year-old self didn't bother to read
even the front page of a product
that, until this week, drained $48.94
out of his account every four
weeks? (N.B. I unsubscribed this
week because $48.94 was too much
money in one billing session, but
only in looking at my statements to
write this column did I realize I that
the per week price I paid to have the
crossword sent to my P.O. Box was
too embarrassing to write out.)
My answer is pretty simple. It's
history. And no one seems to value
history as its happening, save for
monumental moments 9/11 and
November 5,2008 come to mind
at least I don't; otherwise, I would
read the paper every day. But I still
save enough things, like 12 weeks
worth of Sunday New York Times,
to the point where I don't know
what to do with them.
Browsing through my computer
files would reveal that this disorder

trickles over into my digital life. I
can't delete anything from high
school not syllabi, not papers,
and definitely not PDFs of e-mails I
sent and received from teachers and
friends (organized by person and
sorted chronologically and dating
as far back as August 2006). My
"High School" folder takes up 32 gi
gabytes of my 250G8 Mac-
Book Pro, though, to be fair, most
are pictures. I have a folder for
"Screenshots," because I tend to
find many things on the Internet
that are worthy of being document
ed for eternity.
Though there is some semblance
of rationality for holding onto the
newspapers and things like copies
of The Daily from when my first col
umn ran or my Orange Bowl pro
gram, I can't even begin to rational
ize keeping the other items. I hold
onto things like receipts from trips
to CVS, old fortunes from Chinese
restaurants, pamphlets about
Green Library, or the wrapper that
once held my sandwich from the
birthplace of the Philly Cheeses
teak (to be fair, I was twelve when I
first acquired it and threw it out
only a few months after.)
Because I keep things like these,
my desks and drawers, at Stanford
and at home, are like mini time cap
sules that tend to be somewhat
messy. It's too painful to convince
myself to throw out my receipt from
the then-new Barnes & Noble on
86th and Lexington from that day in

June of 2009, when I had last hung
out with my friend before I went on
a student trip to Italy for five weeks,
which was the longest I'd ever been
away from home, my first time in
Europe and the source of my love
for all things Italian. (*Takes a
breath.*) I wish I could shorten this
sentence, but I can't, and for the
same reason that I could not (and
still have not) thrown out that re
ceipt: I place meaning in the small
est of things based on the larger
ramifications they once held, do
hold, or one day will hold in my life.
I'll admit that I hope someone
an anthropologist, maybe, but
hopefully a biographer might
one day find all my belongings in
teresting. But barring that, I'll also
settle for the fact that my life the
people, the places and the events
that comprise it is extraordinari
ly interesting to me and that I never
want to forget any of it. I already
reminisce about the third, fourth
and fifth grades being the best years
of my life and lament the fact that I
don't remember much of why that
was, so what's wrong with keeping
everything from the time that peo
ple tell me will be the "best four
years of my life?"
For this reason, I've kept a jour
nal since November 2008. But it's
the unreadable, the unwriteable, the
unsaid that I want to remember

things like receipts that no one else
will understand but that will prompt
me to say, Oh, that was from the
then-new Barnes & Noble on 86th
and Lex from that day...
So, for now I'll keep on hoarding.

I have a hoarding problem. It's
not a serious issue, like not being
able to walk through my room
because I have a mammoth collec
tion of 80s Cabbage Patch Kids
dolls it's more an issue of not
being able to let go of memories and
their physical manifestations, for
fear that I'll one day regret it.
For example, until this week, I
subscribed to the Sunday New York
Times solely to do the crossword,
which appears in the magazine. De
spite this, I still felt the need to hold
onto the main section of every
paper I'd gotten in my brief sub
scription period. Maybe someday,
ten or twenty or fifty years from
now, it will bring me joy to know
that I still have a copy of the paper
from the day Don't Ask, Don't Tell
was repealed.
But why would 29,39, or 69 year
old me care when my current 19
year-old self didn't bother to read
even the front page of a product
that, until this week, drained $48.94
out of his account every four
weeks? (N.B. I unsubscribed this
week because $48.94 was too much
money in one billing session, but
only in looking at my statements to
write this column did I realize I that
the per week price I paid to have the
crossword sent to my P.O. Box was
too embarrassing to write out.)
My answer is pretty simple. It's
history. And no one seems to value
history as its happening, save for
monumental moments 9/11 and
November 5,2008 come to mind
at least I don't; otherwise, I would
read the paper every day. But I still
save enough things, like 12 weeks
worth of Sunday New York Times,
to the point where I don't know
what to do with them.
Browsing through my computer
files would reveal that this disorder

trickles over into my digital life. I
can't delete anything from high
school not syllabi, not papers,
and definitely not PDFs of e-mails I
sent and received from teachers and
friends (organized by person and
sorted chronologically and dating
as far back as August 2006). My
"High School" folder takes up 32 gi
gabytes of my 250G8 Mac-
Book Pro, though, to be fair, most
are pictures. I have a folder for
"Screenshots," because I tend to
find many things on the Internet
that are worthy of being document
ed for eternity.
Though there is some semblance
of rationality for holding onto the
newspapers and things like copies
of The Daily from when my first col
umn ran or my Orange Bowl pro
gram, I can't even begin to rational
ize keeping the other items. I hold
onto things like receipts from trips
to CVS, old fortunes from Chinese
restaurants, pamphlets about
Green Library, or the wrapper that
once held my sandwich from the
birthplace of the Philly Cheeses
teak (to be fair, I was twelve when I
first acquired it and threw it out
only a few months after.)
Because I keep things like these,
my desks and drawers, at Stanford
and at home, are like mini time cap
sules that tend to be somewhat
messy. It's too painful to convince
myself to throw out my receipt from
the then-new Barnes & Noble on
86th and Lexington from that day in

June of 2009, when I had last hung
out with my friend before I went on
a student trip to Italy for five weeks,
which was the longest I'd ever been
away from home, my first time in
Europe and the source of my love
for all things Italian. (*Takes a
breath.*) I wish I could shorten this
sentence, but I can't, and for the
same reason that I could not (and
still have not) thrown out that re
ceipt: I place meaning in the small
est of things based on the larger
ramifications they once held, do
hold, or one day will hold in my life.
I'll admit that I hope someone
an anthropologist, maybe, but
hopefully a biographer might
one day find all my belongings in
teresting. But barring that, I'll also
settle for the fact that my life the
people, the places and the events
that comprise it is extraordinari
ly interesting to me and that I never
want to forget any of it. I already
reminisce about the third, fourth
and fifth grades being the best years
of my life and lament the fact that I
don't remember much of why that
was, so what's wrong with keeping
everything from the time that peo
ple tell me will be the "best four
years of my life?"
For this reason, I've kept a jour
nal since November 2008. But it's
the unreadable, the unwriteable, the
unsaid that I want to remember

things like receipts that no one else
will understand but that will prompt
me to say, Oh, that was from the
then-new Barnes & Noble on 86th
and Lex from that day...
So, for now I'll keep on hoarding.
