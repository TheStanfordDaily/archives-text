## TRAVEL 101 
### Johnny Bartz 
Call it my parting co-term gift.
but I'm spilling all my secrets.
Travel secrets, that is. Some
may consider jetting off to Europe
for a few days during winter quarter
excessive, or even foolish, but I've
found that it's one of the most exhila
rating ways to break free of the Stan
ford bubble, not to mention a reinvig
orating way to clear your head before
finals. It may be an obsession, or even
an addiction, but I've got a travel
fever and the only cure is more globe
trotting.
Yes, there is something glamorous
about travel. Everyone loves it, yet al
ways complains about how expensive
it is to fly in style, stay in luxury hotels,
eat at chintzy restaurants, etc. They're
right all of these things are exces
sively expensive. The travel industry
is created to take away our hard
earned money, and yet there are so
many tricks that I've learned that will
allow you to have your money/good
grades and travel, too. No one can
claim to know everything about trav
eling, or even the airline industry, but
I'd like to say that from my experi
ence reading aviation forums, the
pastime of searching for cheap fares,
making huge mistakes and exchang
ing tips with other travelers, I know a
thing or two about extravagant travel
on a dime. And most importantly, I'm
going to tell you all about it. Heck, if
Jersey Shore is headed to Italy, you
definitely can!
Sometimes it means living a dual
life or shall I say a life of ex
tremes. It's something like the starv
ing grad student (me!) settling for

three days of pasta with red sauce
after splurging on a wheel of brie
cheese. Yes, that's an exaggeration,
but $5 saved here is a? 3 panino on
the streets of Florence. Well, I guess
?3 doesn't buy much of anything any
more, but you get the picture. It's re
sisting the urge to splurge on the han
dle of Svedka and going for a Four
Loko instead. Well, I guess you can't
get real Four Loko anymore, either.
Maybe a better image is fixing your
leaky faucet spending habits in order
to turn on the fire hose for a brouha
ha in Venice. I'm not sure about you,
but I'd rather have one real caffe
macchiato than an eternity of burnt
"lattes," or whatever else they have
around here.
Winter quarter is the perfect time
to travel, and over the course of this
column, I'm going to share a few of
my experiences to give you some
good ideas. There are periodic fare
sales to nearly all domestic destina
tions, not to mention that flights to
Europe are a fraction of what they
would cost during the high spring
summer season. Or sometimes you
can score a cheap ticket to Hawaii
just in time to relax the weekend be
fore finals, lazing on Waikiki beach.
There's nothing like the healing
power of saltwater, tropical fish, sand
and sunshine. Of course Santa Cruz
could suffice if the weather is nice
enough, but I wouldn't hold my
breath.

Whether it's a weekend power
trip to London or a week of "sick
leave" in Brazil, I've probably done
it. I dream of inspiring new travel

savvy Stanford students. Even if
some of you may dismiss my at-times
spontaneous and ill-planned vaca
tions as an excessive waste. I am with
this. I aim to challenge the tradition
al Stanford bubble by showing an ex
perience of the extreme wander
lust. Best of all, these worldly experi
ences cost a fraction of what you
might think. Would you rather be in
French House or strolling down the
Champs-Elysees? Your pick, just
keep in mind that Cafe Night is twice
a quarter (thank God!). Whoever
said it was possible to lead a fabulous
life of excess without completely
draining the bank account was right.
I've said it once, and I'll most certain
ly say it again: Stanford is great, but
there is just too much of the world
out there for you to see. Everyone
needs some time away, even from
this Cardinal Nirvana. Fabulous trav
el is not just for the filthy rich any
more; even a starving grad student
like myself can get away to practi
cally anywhere. You need a weekend
trip, so stop agonizing over a prob
lem set or what new pair of shoes to
buy, and do as our friend Mr. Twain
once said: "throw off the bowlines,
sail away from the safe harbor."
You'll be glad that you did, and just
think of the stories.

Do you have a travel question or just a
hilarious story? E-mail "Prof." John

and sunshine. Of course Santa Cruz
could suffice if the weather is nice
enough, but I wouldn't hold my
breath.

Whether it's a weekend power
trip to London or a week of "sick
leave" in Brazil, I've probably done
it. I dream of inspiring new travel

savvy Stanford students. Even if
some of you may dismiss my at-times
spontaneous and ill-planned vaca
tions as an excessive waste. I am with
this. I aim to challenge the tradition
al Stanford bubble by showing an ex
perience of the extreme wander
lust. Best of all, these worldly experi
ences cost a fraction of what you
might think. Would you rather be in
French House or strolling down the
Champs-Elysees? Your pick, just
keep in mind that Cafe Night is twice
a quarter (thank God!). Whoever
said it was possible to lead a fabulous
life of excess without completely
draining the bank account was right.
I've said it once, and I'll most certain
ly say it again: Stanford is great, but
there is just too much of the world
out there for you to see. Everyone
needs some time away, even from
this Cardinal Nirvana. Fabulous trav
el is not just for the filthy rich any
more; even a starving grad student
like myself can get away to practi
cally anywhere. You need a weekend
trip, so stop agonizing over a prob
lem set or what new pair of shoes to
buy, and do as our friend Mr. Twain
once said: "throw off the bowlines,
sail away from the safe harbor."
You'll be glad that you did, and just
think of the stories.
