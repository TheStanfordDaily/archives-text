"Doubles points are critical in
matches like this," said Stanford head
coach John Whitlinger. "Any time

get that first point and only have to
win three singles matches, it makes a
really big difference."
Stanford executed early in dou

ning four of the six singles matches
and falling just short in a pair of three
set losses. Klahn, Lin, senior Alex

Whitlinger lauded his team for the

"Texas Tech just beat Cal, who I
think is a very good team, a few days
ago, so we know that they are talent
ed," he said. "I was very pleased with
our effort today; I thought the guys
competed well and, overall, I'm very
happy with what happened today, and
the team should be too."
With his team off to a blazing start,
Whitlinger said that the goal was to
continue improving everyday.
"Our motto has always been,'build
towards May'. You've got to be play
ing your best tennis in May, no matter
how you start the season," he said.
"You want to finish strong, and we're
trying to get ourselves into a position
to do that."
The Cardinal will be back on the
