# Bruins back for more
## No. 1 Stanford puts ranking on the line 
### WILL SEATON STAFF WRITER 
After booking its ticket to the
USTA/ITA National Indoor Cham
pionships, the No. 1 Stanford
women's tennis team (3-0) had a
week of practice to prepare for a
tough early-season test against No. 5
UCLA (4-0) this weekend.
"Last week we had three matches,
so that was pretty strenuous," said
senior Carolyn McVeigh. "This week
we've been working on our games
and working on a lot of doubles play.
It's nice to get the group together.
Last week we couldn't work that
much because we had to be prepared
for the matches."

The victory over No. 39 Oklahoma
on Saturday after was a good learn
ing experience for the freshmen on
the team. Stanford bounced back
after an early setback in doubles play
and swept the singles points to earn a
6-1 victory.
"Right after we lost the doubles
point, all of us were just so focused,"
said freshman Kristie Ahn. "[Head
coach] Lele [Forood] likes to say, 'as
soon as doubles is over, forget about
it. Go straight to singles.' The upper
classmen did a really good job of
preparing us, too."
The young team's promising men
tal fortitude is a good sign going into
the match against a UCLA team that
provided Stanford with its most one
sided loss of last year. After dropping
the doubles point in that match, Stan
ford could only muster one victory to
avoid the sweep. Current senior Hi
lary Barte defeated Yasmin Schnack,
7-5,2-6, (10-7).

Stanford prevailed over the Bru
ins, 5-2, two months later, and the
players maintain that this year's
UCLA squad is a different story.

"I don't think we've talked a lot or
at all about last year," Barte said.
"We're just looking forward to play
ing them on Saturday. It's a brand
new challenge and a brand new

squad they have,"
UCLA's biggest change has come
at the No. 1 spot. Last year, Schnack
was a dominant singles and doubles
player for the Bruins, and she paired
up with Andrea Remynse to make a

run to the NCAA national semifinals
in doubles, ending the season with a
40-8 overall record.

This season, McCall Jones has
taken over the No. 1 position. A
transfer from Brigham Young Uni
versity, Jones is a junior listed at No.
26 in the Preseason ITA Singles rank
ings.

"Yasmin was a really solid singles
and doubles player," McVeigh said.
"So I think they're definitely going to
miss her a little bit."
