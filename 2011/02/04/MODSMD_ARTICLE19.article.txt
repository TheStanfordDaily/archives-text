# Are all athletes created equal?
## 
### Tom Taylor 
This weekend, there are
two major events on
either side of the At
lantic sports divide. On
Sunday, fans in the U.S.
will be glued to Super Bowl XLV,
while in the U.K. and a few near
by countries, the start of the Six
Nations (Europe's most presti
gious rugby tournament) will be
grabbing up the headlines. It
might just be a coincidence of the
sporting schedules, but it gives me
the perfect excuse to examine the
recent claims made by one of my
friends that "95 percent of the top
500 (male) athletes in the world
play in the NBA or NFL."
It isn't hard to find enough ex
ceptions to prove that more than
25 of the world's elite athletes
compete outside of those two
sports. The fastest, strongest and
highest jumpers in the world are
at the Olympics every four years
running track, lifting weights and
leaping as far and high as they
can. Even the best from the NBA
or NFL would struggle against
the top 10 in each of those disci
plines, accounting for hundreds of
athletes. However, there is a
clear difference between the

very specific challenges of athlet
ics and the more all-around de
mands of a team sport. It makes
more sense to ask if the NFL and
NBA have a monopoly on the
athletes in team sports, and to
compare like with almost-like:
specifically, football with rugby.
The mammoth American
football TV marathon may well
last longer than the three games
that will kick off Six Nations, but
it doesn't take long to recognize
the shared heritage of these two
sports. The balls are both oval,
and you can score by either
touching down or kicking
through the posts. If you pay
enough attention, you can even
spot the similarities in player po
sitions and tactics, making a com
parison between the two far more
interesting than between, say,
football and soccer.

There are still, though, some
major differences, and the biggest
of these is the stop-start nature of
football versus the more fluid na
ture of a rugby game. This does
more than provide for the prime
time advertisement slots at the
Super Bowl â€”it fundamentally
changes the type of athlete involved.
Football players must develop the
ability for short, powerful bursts of
activity with comparatively long re
covery periods in between. Rugby
players are required to balance
strength and power with endurance
the ability to get back up immedi
ately after a hit and keep running.
In both sports, the athletes train to
perform in certain roles with different
skill sets, but football players take this
to the extreme. Some may spend en
tire careers working within a very spe
cific role or position on the field, per
haps never even coming close to
touching the actual football. For this
reason, they are almost certainly bet
ter at their primary jobs. This is a luxu
ry that can't be afforded within rugby,
in which periods of constant play can

last more than 20 minutes. It thus be
comes nearly impossible to predict
and plan for what will happen. Rugby
players must have a wider range of
skills than their counterparts in the
NFL.

And even within the very specific
roles of football players, there are no
table exceptions to the rule. Most
kickers in football have but one task,
and so, with all the resources behind
them, it would not be unreasonable
to expect them to be clearly the best.
The longest field goal in NFL history
is 63 yards; the longest penalty kick in
international rugby is a full seven
yards further.
Equipment also complicates the
issue. Because football players wear
helmets and pads, they certainly hit
each other harder than rugby players
can while still avoiding serious injury,
but that doesn't make them better
athletes any more than wearing Air
Jordans would make me (not) like
Mike.

The poster boy for both of these
sports easily fits the stereotypical

ideal of what an athlete should look
like: tall, broad-shouldered, strong
and fast. It's also hard to fault foot
ball or rugby players' commitment
they get hit hard, hard enough to
break lesser men, but still come back
for more. Unfortunately, rugby play
ers don't play football and vice versa,
so there is no way to make an objec
tive comparison.

It would be all too easy for me to
rank rugby far above football, but
the truth is disappointingly far less
controversial. The world's best ath
letes are those who have taken their
particular discipline to its absolute
maximum, who have drilled their
bodies and refined their god-given
talents to reach the limit of what is
achievable within the rules of their
own sport.

Tom Taylor clearly wishes he had the
body of a wide receiver, but sadly, he
does not. If you'd like to taunt him
with a picture of your rock-hard abs,
send him an e-mail at torn, taylor
