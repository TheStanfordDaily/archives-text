# Are all athletes created equal?
## 
### Tom Taylor 
This weekend, there are
two major events on
either side of the At
lantic sports divide. On
Sunday, fans in the U.S.
will be glued to Super Bowl XLV,
while in the U.K. and a few near
by countries, the start of the Six
Nations (Europe's most presti
gious rugby tournament) will be
grabbing up the headlines. It
might just be a coincidence of the
sporting schedules, but it gives me
the perfect excuse to examine the
recent claims made by one of my
friends that "95 percent of the top
500 (male) athletes in the world
play in the NBA or NFL."
It isn't hard to find enough ex
ceptions to prove that more than
25 of the world's elite athletes
compete outside of those two
sports. The fastest, strongest and
highest jumpers in the world are
at the Olympics every four years
running track, lifting weights and
leaping as far and high as they
can. Even the best from the NBA
or NFL would struggle against
the top 10 in each of those disci
plines, accounting for hundreds of
athletes. However, there is a
clear difference between the

very specific challenges of athlet
ics and the more all-around de
mands of a team sport. It makes
more sense to ask if the NFL and
NBA have a monopoly on the
athletes in team sports, and to
compare like with almost-like:
specifically, football with rugby.
The mammoth American
football TV marathon may well
last longer than the three games
that will kick off Six Nations, but
it doesn't take long to recognize
the shared heritage of these two
sports. The balls are both oval,
and you can score by either
touching down or kicking
through the posts. If you pay
enough attention, you can even
spot the similarities in player po
sitions and tactics, making a com
parison between the two far more
interesting than between, say,
football and soccer.

There are still, though, some
major differences, and the biggest
of these is the stop-start nature of
football versus the more fluid na
ture of a rugby game. This does
more than provide for the prime
time advertisement slots at the
