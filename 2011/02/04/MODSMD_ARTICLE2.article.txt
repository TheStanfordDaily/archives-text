# SUN DEVILS STOMPED
## 
### JACK BLANCHAT DESK EDITOR 
In a long, hard-fought game
Thursday night, the Stanford
women's basketball team slogged
out a 72-54 victory over Arizona
State.

The Cardinal (19-2, 10-0 Pac
-10) couldn't quite get on a roll
over the course of the game, lean
ing on their "Big Three" to carry
them to the always-precious road
win.

Senior Jeanette Pohlen had 19
points, junior Nnemkadi Ogwu
mike had 17 points and senior
Kayla Pedersen had 15 points, as
the three combined for 71 per
cent of the Cardinal's scoring
total.

The Cardinal pushed ahead
right out of the gates, jumping out
to a 25-13 lead after 12 minutes
thanks to nine early points from
Pohlen, but the Card's offense in
explicably stalled shortly after
ward.

For the next eight minutes,
Stanford didn't make a single
basket from the floor. The Sun
Devils (13-7, 5-5 Pac-10) were
able to chip into the lead slowly
but surely, and five Cardinal free
throws were all that kept Stan
ford in the lead.

Arizona State cut the score to
30-26 after Kimberly Brandon
made a jumper with 1:14 to go in
the first half, but Pohlen ripped
the ball away from Markisha Pat
terson and went coast-to-coast
for a layup just seconds later, se
curing a 32-27 Stanford lead at
halftime.

The five-point lead at the
break was the smallest halftime
lead the Cardinal have had since
a four-point margin over UConn
on Dec. 12.

The second half saw more of
the slow, disjointed play of the
first half, which was beset by free
throws, fouls and turnovers.
But Stanford ultimately won
the back-and-forth duel, creeping

out to a nine-point lead after five
minutes of play and extending the
lead to double-digits with 9:41 left
in the game. After that, the Sun
Devils never got within striking
distance.

The Cardinal had a slower
than-usual shooting night from
the floor, especially from behind
the three-point line, where they
made just one of five attempts.
However, Stanford was sus-

tained by 25-for-33 shooting from
the free-throw line. In total, the
Card knocked in more free
throws than they did shots from
the floor, 25 to 23.
Brandon led the charge for
Arizona State with 18 points on 7-
for-16 shooting, but the rest of the
Devils couldn't find their stroke,
going 17-for-56 from the floor
and l-for-10 from three as a team.
Despite the loss, the Sun Dev
ils saved face after their last meet
ing against Stanford, where the
Cardinal steamrolled to an 82-35
victory at Maples Pavilion thanks
to shooting 64.8 percent shooting
from the floor, its best all season.

NOTES: No. 4 Stanford was in a tight bat
tle against Arizona State early in the sec
ond half, but pulled away late for a 72-
54 road victory. Senior Kayla Pedersen
led the Cardinal with 15 points, 10 re
bounds and six assists as Stanford won its
47th straight Pac-10 game, one shy of
the all-time record. Arizona is coming off
a loss to Cal, firmly in the middle of the
Pac-10 at 4-5.
