## Stanford sends eight to Vegas 
### JENNY PETER STAFF WRITER 
A select group of eight ath
letes from the men's gymnastics
team will head to Las Vegas this
weekend for the Winter Cup
Challenge, a re-ranking meet
for the U.S. Men's Senior Na
tional Team. Over 100 gymnasts,
including six members of the
2010 World Championships
Team and three Olympians, are
contending for spots on the Se
nior National Team.

Representing Stanford at the
event are seniors Alex
Buscaglia, Josh Dixon, Tim
Gentry and Ryan Lieberman,
redshirt senior Nick Noone,
redshirt sophomore John Mar
tin and freshmen Cale Robin
son and Chris Turner.
"The seniors Tim, Alex,
Ryan and Josh are motivated
to have a successful senior cam
paign and use the year as a
springboard to the international
level," said Stanford head coach
Thorn Glielmi.

The preliminary round of
competition was yesterday, with
the final competition scheduled
to take place tomorrow.

"Spots on the National Team
are getting more and more com
petitive as we get closer to the
Olympic Games, so it really
comes down to who delivers
when the time is right," Dixon
said.

The Stanford men are hop
ing for strong performances for
personal as well as team-orient
ed reasons, as the meet helps de
termine the 15 men who will
make up the Senior National
Team in the 2011 Visa Champi
onships in St. Paul, Minn., from
Aug. 17-20. However, a good
showing will also reflect favor
ably on Stanford's name in the
national and world gymnastic
circles.
"When a Stanford gymnast
wins an event, or places high on
the event, it reflects well on the
work being done in our gym,"
Glielmi said. "The guys' training
has been going extremely well,
and their hard work has benefit
ed their preparation."
"Showing up at such a high
caliber meet with eight guys, the
most from any club or collegiate
program, speaks to the strength
