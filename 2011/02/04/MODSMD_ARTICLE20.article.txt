## Stanford sends eight to Vegas 
### JENNY PETER STAFF WRITER 
A select group of eight ath
letes from the men's gymnastics
team will head to Las Vegas this
weekend for the Winter Cup
Challenge, a re-ranking meet
for the U.S. Men's Senior Na
tional Team. Over 100 gymnasts,
including six members of the
2010 World Championships
Team and three Olympians, are
contending for spots on the Se
nior National Team.

Representing Stanford at the
event are seniors Alex
Buscaglia, Josh Dixon, Tim
Gentry and Ryan Lieberman,
redshirt senior Nick Noone,
redshirt sophomore John Mar
tin and freshmen Cale Robin
son and Chris Turner.
"The seniors Tim, Alex,
Ryan and Josh are motivated
to have a successful senior cam
paign and use the year as a
springboard to the international
level," said Stanford head coach
Thorn Glielmi.

The preliminary round of
competition was yesterday, with
the final competition scheduled
to take place tomorrow.

"Spots on the National Team
are getting more and more com
petitive as we get closer to the
Olympic Games, so it really
comes down to who delivers
when the time is right," Dixon
said.

The Stanford men are hop
ing for strong performances for
personal as well as team-orient
ed reasons, as the meet helps de
termine the 15 men who will
make up the Senior National
Team in the 2011 Visa Champi
onships in St. Paul, Minn., from
Aug. 17-20. However, a good
showing will also reflect favor
ably on Stanford's name in the
national and world gymnastic
circles.
"When a Stanford gymnast
wins an event, or places high on
the event, it reflects well on the
work being done in our gym,"
Glielmi said. "The guys' training
has been going extremely well,
and their hard work has benefit
ed their preparation."
"Showing up at such a high
caliber meet with eight guys, the
most from any club or collegiate
program, speaks to the strength
and depth of the Stanford pro
gram," Dixon added..
The competition also counts the
individual event scores toward par
ticipants' NCAA averages, so Stan
ford will be able to compare itself
against the rest of the nation.
"It is a great experience, not just
to see how they stack up against the
other collegiate gymnasts but also

against the best gymnasts in the
United States," Glielmi said.
Although seven members from
the 2010 World Championships
Team have already earned their
berths onto the national team, eight
other spots are still up for grabs. The
Winter Cup will help determine
those spots based on the following
criteria: the highest-ranked all
around athlete who is not a member
of the World Team, the top four
gymnasts based on the National
Team Point Program, two athletes
chosen by the Men's Program Com
mittee and one athlete selected by

the national team coordinator.
The National Team Point Pro
gram is a ranking system used for ad
vancement to the final round. The
top 42 gymnasts in the all-around
and the top two gymnasts from each
event will advance, and the all
around and individual event cham
pions will then be decided based on
a combined two-day score.
The Cardinal squad will be
joined by some familiar faces when
it heads to Vegas this weekend.
Stanford alumnus David Durante, a
2002 graduate of the men's team,
will be at the event conducting in

terviews for the USA gymnastics
website as well as sending tweets
during the competition. Durante is
the 2007 U.S. All-Around Champi
on and an alternate to the 2008
Olympics. Stanford graduate Sho
Nakamori 'O9 will also be compet
ing at the event.
The Winter Cup Challenge
wraps up this Saturday, and the Car
dinal will continue team competi
tion on Feb. 12 at the Gold Country
Classic in Oakland.
