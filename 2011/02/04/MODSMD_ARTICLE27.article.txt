# SLIDERBAR MISSES THE MARK

Americans may have a
slightly skewed per
ception of tapas. The
Spanish style of eating
(Andalusian in origin)
involves a small plate of food
served at a bar specifically to
accompany drinks. Our
interpretation is something
more along the lines of mak
ing a meal at a restaurant out
of appetizers. One permuta
tion of the American philos
ophy on tapas is sliders.
However, just as we were
somewhat off in our under
standing of tapas, so is
Sliderbar off in their attempt
at sliders.

Sliderbar has a casual
atmosphere that works best
as a relatively quick lunch
destination or a happy hour
stop for drinks and food
after work. The decor of the
restaurant and bar makes it
relatively cozy, so it is easier
to overlook the fact that the
small space can certainly get
cramped.
Unfortunately, any
redeeming aspects of the

vibe are trumped by the sub
par menu. In general, all of
their beef options are weak.
The American Classic Slider,
for example, is a disaster. It
lacks flavor almost entirely
and ultimately ends up
resembling a savory Twinkie
as mayonnaise oozes through
the perforation in the top of
the bun created by the
wooden pick. The same is
true of the Double
Cheeseburger Slider it's
just a larger version of its
Classic cousin that is physi
cally more difficult to eat.
The Kobe Beef Slider is dis
appointing as well and is
demonstrative of Sliderbar's
failure to understand how to
bring out the savory, tender
aspects of meat.
Sliderbar performs poor
ly with its non-beef options,
too. For example, despite the
powerful ingredients, the
California Chicken Slider
manages to completely
underwhelm in terms of fla
vor. Neither the garlic, ginger
or chipotle come through at
all only a bland, forget
table slider is left in their
place. The All Natural Italian
Sausage Slider Dog is chewy
with a flavor similar to a
cheap hotdog purchased at
the grocery store; even the
tsunami of relish can't cover
up poor quality meat. The

Vegetarian Slider is a waste.
The patty is shockingly dry
and makes the dish difficult
to eat, given its displeasing
mouth-feel. And while the
Serrano Chili Southwestern
Slider has a bit of a spicy
kick to it, there is nothing to
compliment the Serrano chili
flavor, leaving the burger as
more of a tease of what
could have been.
Not all of the sliders were
complete misfires, but none
were outstanding. The
Mediterranean Slider, for
example, has good flavor to
it, but the proportions are a
bit off; the lamb patty is deli
cious, but so large that it
overwhelms any of the sur
rounding flavors, which in
turn allows the cheese to

impart a particularly heavy
feel to the burger without
providing much of the subtle
feta flavor. The Marinated
Portobello Slider is also
somewhat enjoyable. The
savory mushroom provides a
delectable substitution for
meat that is well-compli
mented by the sweetness of
the caramelized onions and
the balsamic vinegar. The
Memphis Style Natural
Pulled Pork BBQ Slider is
one of their stronger dishes
with a nice, sweet and tangy
BBQ sauce that is not too
heavy, but it hardly holds up
to the dedicated BBQ restau
rants in the surrounding area
for purists on a quest.
The excitement underly
ing an establishment like

Sliderbar is the ability to
avoid commitment and try a
little bit of everything; five
sliders is a manageable feat
allowing a good sampling of
the whole menu. But when
so few dishes deliver any
thing worth noting, the
experience unravels, and you
become forced to order from
a limited set of mediocre
options. If you need the fun
of sundry tastes, consider
tapas at Joya. If you're in the
mood for a solid hamburger,
try The Counter. If you're
thinking of Sliderbar, "don't
bother."
