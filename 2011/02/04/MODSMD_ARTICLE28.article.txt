## COLD WAR KIDS 
### â€” sophia VO contact sophia: sophiavo@stanford. edu 
0.C.-natives Cold War Kids defy all
chill Californian stereotypes of
beaches, sunshine and greenery. They
sport black jackets and skinny jeans fit for
cloudy skies. Darkly insightful lyrics accompa
ny the soaring vocals, which contain a blend
of garage post-punk and gospel fervor. This is
the epitome of indie-rock cool, as far as image
goes.

The first time I stumbled on the band
was when I heard "Hospital Beds" from their
2006 debut "Robbers & Cowards." "Mine Is
Yours," the title track of their new album, is
fashioned like a power ballad. Soft, tween
pop-worthy electronic beats introduce the
tune, and then echoing drums fall in line with
lead singer Nathan Willet's words. Realistic
love runs out of room, Willet mourns. He
cannot sway the sun or the moon for the
object of his affection. A crescendo into the
heights of romance succeeds in ear-worthy
satisfaction, promising " All my stones become
your pearls/All of my trials are your treasures."

Other gems
off the album don't shy away from tribulation
either. "Royal Blue" dotes on watching rain
clouds and having skies for roofs. Upbeat
clapping and rough-and-tumble guitar riffs
make this message shine. Likewise, "Out of
the Wilderness" is laden with visual imagery,
interesting enough to seem otherworldly
("cryptic graffiti greetings to read") and mag
nificent enough to place yourself in the scene
("I will always walk tall/when the rain starts to

fall, I come out of the wilderness to lay by the
waterfalF'). Aside from the strong presence of
guitars and drums, synth keyboards give the
Cold War Kids airy, glazed undertones. There
is richness of sound, which proves comple
mentary to the emotion-packed array of love
stories.

Two odd music styles end up in the selec
tion, really for variety's sake rather than to
add depth to the album. "Bulldozer,"

"Sensitive Kid" and "Cold Toes on the Cold
Floor" feature sharper vocals, jagged and
fierce in temperament. In this way, the Cold
War Kids retain the slightly disheveled charm
of their earlier albums. These songs would be
better received in an eclectic blues lounge
because they near on rockabilly and are just
short of'9os grunge.
This music release ends with "Flying
Upside Down," a somewhat forgetful tune
meant to leave you with the rising soulfulness
of the band. The goal for this track seems to
be raw energy instead of lasting enjoyment.
Though there are definite lulls in the
song list, the Cold War Kids' ambitious
attempt to bring heart isn't for naught. For
instance, other artists addressing similar top
ics are tempted to sing apathetically. For those
with a soft spot for a cross between main
stream melodies and indie ruggedness, the

band is at point in its career to convey exactly
that.
A blogosphere chart-topper is "Skip the
Charades." The song is a plea for seeing
through the fogginess of false strength and
flowery language. Jangling cymbals and light
guitar strumming offset the dim nature of the
narrative ("you wait on letters/patient for any
sign of life").
And then there's "Finally Begin," a more
low-key number. Near-spoken verses state the
scenario: years of over-thinking and commit
ment issues on the protagonist's part broaden
the distance between two lovers. He tells him
self, "If it's got to be a leap of faith, I wish some
body'd push me. That way I'd know who to
blame." The lilting way that insecurities are

expressed draws in the listener while the com
plexity offers more sentimental value than

your average refrain.
Ultimately, the Cold War Kids are
refreshing for slow mornings and overcast
days. They're commendable for being radio
friendly yet still being poetically dynamic
enough for the indie world.
