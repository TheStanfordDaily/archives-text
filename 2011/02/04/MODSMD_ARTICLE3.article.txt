## Row dues lead to confusion Potential changes to refund procedure kept low-key 
### KURT CHIRBAS STAFF WRITER 
According to several financial man
agers, Row residents are no longer re
funded their houses' unspent social and
board dues. A changed Residential Edu
cation policy requires that houses de
posit their budget surpluses in restricted
use accounts called "Capital Reserve
Funds" (CRF).
Money funneled into these accounts
is used for unforeseen expenses and pur
chases that will remain in a given house
for more than a year, such as speakers
and furniture. Once the money is de
posited, it can no longer be used to pay
for parties, day trips, cable television or
kitchen expenses.
Though Row financial managers
(FMs) were informed of the new policy
during training, Residential Education
(ResEd) has not made an administrative
announcement. In an e-mail to The
Daily, associate dean of Residential Edu
cation Nate Boswell wrote that "no offi
cial change has been implemented at this
time."
"Residential Education continues to
explore policies related to spending so
cial dues allocation in Row houses,
specifically as it relates to maximizing
consistent spending habits from quarter
to quarter," he said.
Official or not, many financial man
agers are operating under the policy. Ac-
cording to Roth FM Lyn Mehe'ula
'll, Student Organized Services
(SOS) director Nick Peters '94 told
financial managers to try to spend
the entirety of their income each
quarter. SOS manages Row house
accounts, including CRF funds.
When contacted, Peters declined to
comment.

Announcing the change

When current Roth residents
met last spring, Mehe'ula told them
that she would budget as carefully
as possible in hopes of refunding
the money back to them.
"The mark of a good financial
manager last year was to budget
wisely, so that at the end of the year,
you had the opportunity to give
money back to your residents,"
Mehe'ula said.

But at training in August, FMs
were told that unspent money
would not be refunded. Mehe'ula
broke the news to Roth's residents
at the first house meeting of the
year.

"There were groans," Mehe'ula
said. "No one was really happy
about it, especially since it was dif
ferent from what I had told them in
the spring, but no one's really com
plained beyond groaning at the
meeting."

Casa Italiana FM Jack Jor
gensen 'l2 also informed his resi
dents of the change at the beginning
of fall quarter.
"I sent an e-mail, especially to
residents who had lived in a Row

house the last year, saying, 'Just a
heads-up, due to a policy change
this year, we will not be able to
grant refunds this year,'" Jorgensen
said. "I also reiterated that we
would do our best to keep costs
down and make the most out of
their money."

Purpose of change unclear to many

Officially, the intent behind the
change aims to encourage houses to
spend their entire budgets each
quarter. But among financial man
agers, the purpose is less clear.
"I've asked [ResEd] a few times,
and I've never gotten a definitive
answer," Mehe'ula said.

She speculated that it might
have been instituted to make sure
that all houses had money in their
CRFs.

"I remember during training at
the beginning of the year, multiple
houses didn't have a CRF fund,"
Mehe'ula said.

"If you don't have a CRF fund,
it's hard to get a lot of things for the
house, especially if the house needs
new furniture or something that's
necessary," she added.

Mehe'ula said that she views the
CRF as "incredibly important" and
was initially happy about the
change. Being the first group to ex
perience the change, however, is
difficult.

"When you are in the first group,
you don't have previous years to
benefit from, so we are paying into
something that we won't ever see,"
Mehe'ula said.

Jorgensen, however, stated that
the change was implemented by
ResEd to encourage financial man
agers to spend all the money they
collect in social dues.
"The Row Office wants us to ac
tually spend [the social dues] on the
residents [and] use it to provide
services in terms of social events
and activities that all residents can
use to relax and de-stress," Jor
gensen said.
He added that the change was
made to bridge a gap between large
Row houses and small ones. Jor
gensen said that economies of scale
allow larger Row houses to run
high end-of-year budget surpluses.
Smaller Row houses have not
demonstrated this trend.

Under the former policy, this
meant that those living in the bigger
houses would, on average, be re
funded more money than those liv
ing in smaller houses.
"[ResEd] viewed it as a little bit
unfair that these small houses were
struggling to make their budgets
while these large houses were hav
ing large surpluses," Jorgensen
said.

Slavianskii Dom FM Chris
Kucharczyk 'll said he had not
heard of a policy change concerning
social dues, but agreed that such a
change was probably made to even
out the financial gap between hous
es. He hypothesized that the change
was implemented to "equalize the
pay for housing."
At least one house last quarter
had a significant budget surplus
that was directed to its CRF fund.

The house's financial manager, who
requested anonymity due to his on
going efforts to work out the issue
with ResEd, said that he was not
aware of the policy change until it
"became relevant" to him.
He added that ResEd has tried
to keep residents' best interests in
mind.

"I think if there's a big surplus,
they'll work with you to figure out
how to move those funds," he said.
"They'll be flexible about how to
resolve the situation."

He said one of the difficult parts
of the change is that it's harder to
save up for big events because sur
pluses are deposited into the CRF
on a quarterly basis.
"You can't have a long-term
budget where you spend a little bit
less this quarter, and save up for a
big event in the spring," he said.
"Everything has to be spent in that
quarter or else you lose access to it.
That's sort of the surprise."

Budgeting the 'spirit of the Row'

Jorgensen said that the change
has, in some ways, made his respon
sibilities as a financial manager
more difficult.

"We typically have a set number
of events that we like to do, so this
forces us to budget how much we
actually plan on spending for those
events beforehand," Jorgensen
said. "Because if we budget too lit
tle, then we aren't going to be able
to have those events."

"But if we budget too much," he
added, "then what's going to hap
pen is all that money is going to be
rolled into CRF."

Overall, Jorgensen thought that
the change was designed to con
tribute positively to student life on
the Row and maintain its distinct
social atmosphere.
"ResEd, the Row Office and the
managers that work here are trying
to preserve the spirit of the Row as
much as possible, and, ultimately, I
think the policy is designed to en
hance that," he said. "Whether it's
the most effective policy or whether
all the kinks have been worked out
of it, I don't know. But I think that's
still the overall goal that this policy
is trying to meet."
