## 'Life,' 'Salesman' and 'Happy' strike a chord at Sundance 
### â€” jennifer SCHAFFER contact jennifer: jmschaff@stanford. edu 
Intermission flew out to Utah last week for the
27th Sundance Film Festival. While it's pretty
much impossible to watch all the films, we did
manage to check out a couple.

"Life in a Day"
There are only 24 hours
in a day. They often feel
wasted, lost in routine and I
repetition, squandered and'
bartered away. But there is
something human and

imperfect and beautiful about the way those com
mon hours are spent, the choices we make with
out thought, the act of rising, of brewing coffee, of
screaming and crying and kissing and laughing
and somehow, with the help of thousands of peo
ple around the world, director Kevin Mac Donald
has captured it in "Life in a Day," a 90 minute doc
umentary. We meet a man who has been biking
around the world for nine years, a mother strug
gling with cancer, a boy without a mother, a boy
who shines shoes for a living. We watch love and
rejection and hope and frustration unfold on the
screen, but it is not the monumental that cuts us
deepest it is the universality of, and beauty in,
the banal that is most striking. "Life in a Day" is a
gorgeous film that artfully combines footage from
all over the world, captured by thousands of indi
viduals who responded to Mac Donald's You Tube
directive: to film one day July 24, 2010 in

your life and submit the footage. From over 8,500
hours of film, Mac Donald and his producers
gleaned thousands of clips which, together, com
prise a visual poem that is at once affirming,
depressing, moving and ultimately wonderful, true
to life itself.

"The Salesman"
When we first saw this
movie, we laughed. We sat
there, eyes glued to the
grey landscape of a
Quebec suburb in the dead
of winter. We watched, bored,
as a car salesman went about his business in

French, with barely readable white subtitles
scrawled across the winter landscape. We watched
patiently as he extended his hand for gumballs
from his grandson, we watched expectantly as he
greeted his daughter with a kiss, we watched drea
rily as he sold cars, we watched sleepily as he
closed shop, once more. In that first hour and 15
minutes, nothing extraordinary happened, noth
ing revelatory or even allegorical, just life as a cars
salesman in a French Canadian town during the
recession. Then, as is wont to do in indie films,

tragedy strikes, and the last half hour of the film
follows our friend the salesman as he lives beyond
that tragedy: selling cars, eating leftovers, walking
in the snow. We left the theater feeling a little per
plexed and very bored, the Park City chill turning
our exasperated sighs into little cold clouds. We

laughed about the self-indulgent artsiness of the
film, we joked about the lack of significance in the
obsession with the mundane and we went to bed,
unaware that this film had penetrated our con-

sciousness and in some undetected but indeli
ble way had moved us. "The Salesman" is a film
that requires patience, a film that should be
absorbed rather than analyzed, appreciated for the
blank stare into reality that it offers.

"Happy Happy"
The poster for "Happy
Happy" featured a bug
eyed woman in lingerie,
flanked with two angels
with the face of men,

against a Pepto-pink backdrop

Which begged the question: What? For goodness
sake, its tagline was "a comedy about infidelity,
moose meat, blowjobs and cottage cheese." I
immediately wrote the film off, assuming it was
going to be unbearably kitsch and contrived.
How wrong I was. "Happy Happy" is, in a
word, real. The characters are tangible, the plot
relatable, the emotions raw. And to top it off, it's
Norwegian. This foreign dramedy tells the story of
a Kaja, a young wife living in an isolated suburb of
Norway. Kaja, played by Agnes Kittelson, is incred
ibly charming and funny, but the two men in her

life her troubled husband, who cannot even

feign sexual interest in her, and her troublemaking
son, who, in one scene, tells her she is ugly are
deprecating and cruel. When the perfect young
family moves next door, Kaja's world is given a big
kick of excitement, and we watch as the aforemen
tioned blowjobs and infidelity unfold with humor
and honesty. A racially-charged subplot of the
film involving Kaja's white son and the family next
door's adopted African son lends a dark and
uncomfortable touch to "Happy Happy" that
made many Americans in the audience positively
squeamish, but for me, it epitomized the honesty
of director Sewitsky's vision. Children, like adults,
are capable of great cruelty and even greater mis
understanding, and Sewitsky's candor in capturing
that brutal truth, on every level, is remarkable and
brave. Similar to "The Kids Are All Right" in tone,
but with an extra element of humor and a touch
of the absurd (there is a Norwegian a cappella boy
band that serves as a kind of Greek chorus for the
film, singing American folk hymns between
scenes), "Happy Happy" was a winner at
Sundance, both for our audience and the festival
at large, snagging the coveted World Cinema Jury
award.

something human and

imperfect and beautiful about the way those com
mon hours are spent, the choices we make with
out thought, the act of rising, of brewing coffee, of
screaming and crying and kissing and laughing
and somehow, with the help of thousands of peo
ple around the world, director Kevin Mac Donald
has captured it in "Life in a Day," a 90 minute doc
umentary. We meet a man who has been biking
around the world for nine years, a mother strug
gling with cancer, a boy without a mother, a boy
who shines shoes for a living. We watch love and
rejection and hope and frustration unfold on the
screen, but it is not the monumental that cuts us
deepest it is the universality of, and beauty in,
the banal that is most striking. "Life in a Day" is a
gorgeous film that artfully combines footage from
all over the world, captured by thousands of indi
viduals who responded to Mac Donald's You Tube
directive: to film one day July 24, 2010 in

your life and submit the footage. From over 8,500
hours of film, Mac Donald and his producers
gleaned thousands of clips which, together, com
prise a visual poem that is at once affirming,
depressing, moving and ultimately wonderful, true
to life itself.

"The Salesman"
When we first saw this
movie, we laughed. We sat
there, eyes glued to the
grey landscape of a
Quebec suburb in the dead
of winter. We watched, bored,
as a car salesman went about his business in

French, with barely readable white subtitles
scrawled across the winter landscape. We watched
patiently as he extended his hand for gumballs
from his grandson, we watched expectantly as he
greeted his daughter with a kiss, we watched drea
rily as he sold cars, we watched sleepily as he
closed shop, once more. In that first hour and 15
minutes, nothing extraordinary happened, noth
ing revelatory or even allegorical, just life as a cars
salesman in a French Canadian town during the
recession. Then, as is wont to do in indie films,

tragedy strikes, and the last half hour of the film
follows our friend the salesman as he lives beyond
that tragedy: selling cars, eating leftovers, walking
in the snow. We left the theater feeling a little per
plexed and very bored, the Park City chill turning
our exasperated sighs into little cold clouds. We

laughed about the self-indulgent artsiness of the
film, we joked about the lack of significance in the
obsession with the mundane and we went to bed,
unaware that this film had penetrated our con-

sciousness and in some undetected but indeli
ble way had moved us. "The Salesman" is a film
that requires patience, a film that should be
absorbed rather than analyzed, appreciated for the
blank stare into reality that it offers.

"Happy Happy"
The poster for "Happy
Happy" featured a bug
eyed woman in lingerie,
flanked with two angels
with the face of men,

against a Pepto-pink backdrop

Which begged the question: What? For goodness
sake, its tagline was "a comedy about infidelity,
moose meat, blowjobs and cottage cheese." I
immediately wrote the film off, assuming it was
going to be unbearably kitsch and contrived.
How wrong I was. "Happy Happy" is, in a
word, real. The characters are tangible, the plot
relatable, the emotions raw. And to top it off, it's
Norwegian. This foreign dramedy tells the story of
a Kaja, a young wife living in an isolated suburb of
Norway. Kaja, played by Agnes Kittelson, is incred
ibly charming and funny, but the two men in her

life her troubled husband, who cannot even

feign sexual interest in her, and her troublemaking
son, who, in one scene, tells her she is ugly are
deprecating and cruel. When the perfect young
family moves next door, Kaja's world is given a big
kick of excitement, and we watch as the aforemen
tioned blowjobs and infidelity unfold with humor
and honesty. A racially-charged subplot of the
film involving Kaja's white son and the family next
door's adopted African son lends a dark and
uncomfortable touch to "Happy Happy" that
made many Americans in the audience positively
squeamish, but for me, it epitomized the honesty
of director Sewitsky's vision. Children, like adults,
are capable of great cruelty and even greater mis
understanding, and Sewitsky's candor in capturing
that brutal truth, on every level, is remarkable and
brave. Similar to "The Kids Are All Right" in tone,
but with an extra element of humor and a touch
of the absurd (there is a Norwegian a cappella boy
band that serves as a kind of Greek chorus for the
film, singing American folk hymns between
scenes), "Happy Happy" was a winner at
Sundance, both for our audience and the festival
at large, snagging the coveted World Cinema Jury
award.
