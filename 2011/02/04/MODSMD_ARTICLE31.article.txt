## Academy Awards Nominations and Predictions 
### â€“ halle EDWARDS contact halle: halle@stanford. edu 
Best Picture
"Black Swan," "The Fighter," Inception," "The
Kids Are All Right," "The King's Speech,"
"127 Hours," "The Social Network," "Toy
Story 3," "True Grit" and "Winter's Bone."
Who will win: Despite the earlier critical
buzz surrounding "Black Swan" and "The
Social Network," which won Best Picture at
the Golden Globes, it will be near impossible
to stop the momentum of "The King's
Speech," which recently swept the Producers,
Directors and Screen Actors Guild Awards.
Unless "The Social Network" pulls off a last
minute comeback, expect the historical
drama to take the top prize this year.

Best Actor in a Leading Role
Javier Bardem in "Biutiful," Jeff Bridges in
"True Grit," Jesse Eisenberg in "The Social
Network," Colin Firth in "The King's Speech"
and James Franco in "127 Hours."
Who will win: Colin Firth is the obvious
favorite with his recent wins at the Golden
Globes and Screen Actors Guild Awards. No
doubt the Academy will also want to reward
Firth for his breathtaking performance in
"The King's Speech," not to mention for a
long and successful Hollywood career.

Best Actor in a Supporting Role
Christian Bale in "The Fighter," John Hawkes
in "Winter's Bone," Jeremy Renner in "The
Town," Mark Ruffalo in "The Kids Are All
Right" and Geoffrey Rush in "The King's
Speech."

Who will win: Christian Bale is a likely
choice after his Golden Globes win for his
gritty turn in "The Fighter," but don't dis
count John Hawkes. He was nearly unrecog
nizable in thriller "Winter's Bone," and his
chilly, terrifying performance is definitely
worth a win.

Best Actress in a Leading Role
Annette Bening in "The Kids Are All Right,"
Nicole Kidman in "Rabbit Hole," Jennifer
Lawrence in "Winter's Bone," Natalie
Portman in "Black Swan" and Michelle
Williams in "Blue Valentine."
Who will win: There is no denying Natalie
Portman's dominance this awards season for
"Black Swan," but if an upset happens, the
award will likely go to Annette Bening, who
has been nominated four times for an
Academy Award, but has never won.

Best Actress in a Supporting Role
Amy Adams in "The Fighter," Helena
Bonham Carter in "The King's Speech,"
Melissa Leo in "The Fighter," Hailee Steinfeld
in "True Grit" and Jacki Weaver in "Animal
Kingdom."
Who will win: Melissa Leo has already
picked up plenty of awards for her perform
ance in "The Fighter," putting her in the lead
for this award. However, the Academy loves
an upset, and the Supporting Actress catego
ry can be full of surprises. Newcomer Hailee
Steinfeld wowed the crowd with her per
formance in "True Grit," and Jacki Weaver
was terrifying as a heartless mafia mother in
"Animal Kingdom." Either one is a likely pick
in the case of an upset.

Best Director

Darren Aronofsky for "Black Swan," David
O. Russell for "The Fighter," Tom Hooper for
"The King's Speech," David Fincher for "The
Social Network" and Joel and Ethan Coen
for "True Grit."

Who will win: Although David Fincher was
the earlier favorite for "The Social Network,"
Tom Hooper's recent Directors Guild win
cements him as the favorite. It's possible
either Darren Aronofsky or the Coen broth
ers could upset for their films this year, both
done in their signature styles, but odds point
to another win for "The King's Speech." (It's
perhaps important to note Christopher
Nolan's obvious snub in being excluded from
this category for "Inception.")

Best Documentary (Feature)
"Exit through the Gift Shop," Banksy and

Jaimie D'Cruz, "Gasland," Josh Fox and Trish
Adlesic, "Inside Job," Charles Ferguson and
Audrey Marrs, "Restrepo," Tim Hetherington
and Sebastian Junger, and "Waste Land,"
Lucy Walker and Angus Aynsley.

Who will win: Although it is not completely
outside the realm of possibility for Banksy to
win for his unusual, witty documentary,
expect "Inside Job," a searing portrait of Wall
Street's role in the recent financial crisis, to
take home the statuette.

Best Film Editing
"Black Swan," "The Fighter," "The King's
Speech," "127 Hours" and "The Social
Network."

Who will win: Ignoring another glaring
"Inception" snub, expect another win for
"The King's Speech." Although "The Social
Network" is another likely winner, expect the
momentum of "The King's Speech" to start
early in the awards program with this prize.

Best Music (Original Score)
"How to Train Your Dragon," John Powell,
"Inception," Hans Zimmer, "The King's
Speech," Alexandre Desplat, "127 Hours,"
A.R. Rahman, and "The Social Network,"
Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross.
Who will win: Although Trent Reznor and

Atticus Ross picked up the Golden
Globe for their understated, moody
score for "The Social Network," don't
be surprised to see Hans Zimmer win
for "Inception." It could provide the
blockbuster's only win of the night,
and Zimmer has a large body of
soundtrack work supporting him.

Best Adapted Screenplay
"127 Hours," Danny Boyle and Simon
Beaufoy, "The Social Network," Aaron
Sorkin, "Toy Story 3," screenplay by
Michael Arndt; story by John Lasseter,
Andrew Stanton and Lee Unkrich, "True
Grit," written for the screen by Joel Coen
and Ethan Coen, and "Winter's Bone,"

adapted for the screen by Debra Granik and
Anne Rosellini.
Who will win: Aaron Sorkin is the favorite
for his witty, fast-paced "Social Network"
script, especially after winning at the Golden
Globes. However, Debra Granik and Anne
Rosellini's work in "Winter's Bone" was phe
nomenal, and if the movie picks up any

awards, this might be it.

Best Original Screenplay
"Another Year," written by Mike
Leigh, "The Fighter," screenplay
by Scott Silver, Paul Tamasy and
Eric Johnson; story by Keith
Dorrington, Paul Tamasy and Eric

Johnson, "Inception," written

by Christopher Nolan,
"The Kids Are All
Right," written by Lisa
Cholodenko and Stuart
Blumberg, and "The
King's Speech," screen
play by David Seidler.

Who will win: "The King's Speech" will likely
start its Academy Awards winning streak
early in the evening with this award, unless
Lisa Cholodenko and Stuart Blumberg can
come from behind with their witty, original,
family drama "The Kids Are All Right."
