Derek Cianfrance's poignant "Blue
Valentine" is a postmodern, grown-up
love story that reminds us that some
times, happily ever after is merely a means
to an end. Featuring Ryan Gosling and
Michelle Williams as the 20-something cou
ple Dean and Cindy, the film juxtaposes the
optimistic, early days of tenuous courtship
with the decidedly unglamorous family life
of years later, weaving together two narra
tives from markedly different times and
spaces.

Shot in crisp, vibrant Super 16 mm as
the young couple falls in love, and grainier
Red One as their marriage slowly crumbles,

the film achieves a dreamy quality as it
jumps back and forth through time. And, at
just under two hours, the slow yet steady
pacing makes experiencing the evolution of
the relationship as voyeuristic as watching a
train get derailed in slow motion; deep
down you know what's coming, but you
can't quite believe it until it happens.

At the heart of "Blue Valentine" lies an
eerie verisimilitude that makes it alternately
compelling and yet difficult to watch.
Because the movie was in development for
nearly a decade, both Gosling and Williams
had years to prepare for these roles, and
when production finally began, Cianfrance
pulled out all the stops in order to make it

feel as authentic as possible. The majority of
the film is unscripted, and much of it was
shot in long, continuous takes, giving the
actors a rare kind of freedom. This method
yields a raw candidness, which perhaps is
what struck a nerve with the MPAA, who
initially stamped an NC-17 rating on it. But
contrary to other recent films (read: "Love
and Other Drugs"), nothing in "Blue
Valentine" feels gratuitous or exploitative. In
actuality, very little is shown, and what does
get included only emphasizes how Dean and
Cindy's relationship changes.
Gosling gives a forceful performance as
a man crazy in love, and particular scenes in
"Blue Valentine" will make Nicholas Sparks
fans reminisce over a popular 2004 romance
drama that incidentally also co-starred a
fair-skinned, doe-eyed blonde in the lead. As
Dean, a walk across the Brooklyn Bridge
suddenly takes a turn for the worse, much
like a certain Ferris wheel ride from another
film, and the scene in which Dean and

Cindy consummate their relationship for the
first time will probably also ring some bells.
This is not to say that Cianfrance's film is
simply "The Notebook" redux (although as a



COURTESY SILVERWOOD FILMS
friend of mine pointed out, a
mash-up of the two would easily
go viral on You Tube), but that
Gosling's portrayal merits the
comparison.

Instead, it is Williams' subtle
presence as the enduring partner
to Dean that makes the movie tick.
We watch as Cindy dreams big,

slogging through pre-med courses
in college to become a doctor and
talking with her grandmother
about someday finding true love.
We want her to be able to have it
all the career, the Prince
Charming and the spark clearly

missing from her own parents'
relationship, but instead her life
gets interrupted. Flash forward to a
dreary suburban home, a little girl
and a less than perfect marriage;
the bright young woman is gone,
replaced with an aimless bore.

Cianfrance once said that if he
had been able to make "Blue

Valentine" at the time he actually
conceived of the project, it proba
bly would have ended up as some

thing resembling "The Notebook".
But by waiting until after he had
started his own family, it adopted
an emotional maturity that sets it
apart from the typical romantic
fodder that litters the box office at
this time of year. Bleak as
Cianfrance's vision may be, his

gritty, documentary-style approach
is nonetheless refreshing.
