If you thought the gun-filled poster
of "The Mechanic" advertised a
movie about some guy who repairs
firearms, you're wrong. With exciting
car chases, fighting and other forms of
violence, the film delves into the world
of a super assassin.
Arthur Bishop (Jason Statham), the
titular master hit man, has killed countless
people, and he's good at it. His cool,
detached dedication to his job shows when
he kills his mentor Harry McKenna (Donald
Sutherland) without as much as a blink.
McKenna's death leaves his only son Steve
(Ben Foster) in emotional and financial
wreckage. To make up for his actions, lone
wolf Arthur decides to take Steve as an
apprentice and teaches him the ways of his
"clean" killing philosophy.
"The Mechanic" is definitely a treat for
action fans. It encompasses all necessary ele
ments of a good action movie — weapons,
explosions and, of course, lots and lots of
tough guys with inhuman gun and fighting

skills executing coldhearted kills. The film is
a great adrenaline rush, especially toward
the end of the movie when the blood and
gore factor is especially pronounced. With
blood spilling around, Arthur and Steve
demonstrate the copious ways a human can
die. While they may not be aesthetically
pleasing, the fights onscreen definitely get
your heart pumping.
A perfect fit for his role, Stratham has
made a name for himself playing the leads
in countless action-packed, testosterone
filled B-movies. He captures the audience
here with his charisma, portraying the cool

but conflicted Arthur with a brooding reti
cence. Likewise, Foster, best known as Angel
in "X-Men: The Last Stand," works well with
Stratham as the black sheep and unruly gun
man.
However, the directing methods and
cookie-cutter plot detract from the strong
performances. Scene transitions could've
been smoother, storylines more convincing

the ease with which Steve trains to
become an assassin is a bit eyebrow raising.
2008's "Wanted" with Angelina Jolie did a
much better job in those respects.
As far as cool, mindless fun goes, "The
Mechanic" certainly fits the bill.
