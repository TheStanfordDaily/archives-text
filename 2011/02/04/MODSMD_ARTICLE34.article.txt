## STERLING ARCHER WHAT TO WATCH NEXT WEEK 'Archer': Thursday night cartoons 
### â€“ liz STARK contact liz: estark12@stanford. edu 
Admittedly, certain shows never
make it onto my radar because
they are guy shows: "Man vs.
Wild," "Top Gear" and "Ninja Warrior."
None of these, you'll note, is a scripted
series. There's something about narrative
and serialized plots that is anathema to
the average male attention span. FX's
foray into the niche universe of animated
television with "Archer" combines genre
parody with a procedural framework in
an attempt to prove that men care about
characters with the same fervency as
women.
I started hearing about "Archer" last
year as all of my guy friends exhorted me
to switch to FX following a Thursday
night on NBC. In terms of television
comedies, "Archer" is more "Adult Swim"

than "Family Guy" or "South Park." Adam
Reed, the show's creator, was also the man
behind "Sealab 2021" and "Frisky Dingo,"
signaling his commitment to animated
television. Where shows like "South Park"
are founded on a series of references and
parody, "Archer" is unique in the history
of animated series in that it is a parody of
genre. Even "Looney Toons" lampooned
political figures, but the show wasn't
defined by those sneaky jobs.
The eponymous "Archer" offers a
caricature of both a Ken doll and James
Bond. To pursue the world of the latter,
"M" stands for "Mom," voiced by Jessica
Walter, the quintessential self-absorbed
mother from "Arrested Development."
Sterling Archer works as a spy at his
mother's agency ISIS (International

Secret Intelligence Service), alongside his
ex-girlfriend Lana and the flamboyantly
gay Ray, to name just two of the dysfunc
tional and neurotic employees. The spy
plots usually lack the suspense we've
come to expect from chase scenes, as

Archer only accidentally apprehends the
bad guys. When he does, Archer is hap
pening upon justice in his quest for self
gratification and pleasure: he is a scrupu
lous nymphomaniac and occasional
misogynist. In identifying the seemingly
disparate depictions of men and women
on the show, one must acknowledge that
both are portrayed as stereotypes: the for
mer blundering and blunt, the latter
pleasure seeking and equally blunt. The
spy conceit here is not a device for val
orizing male heroism and intellect, rather

Sunday: THE SUPERBOWL!
I'm serious. Sports broad
casts are the ultimate amal
gamations of storytelling and
reality. Plus, you can't miss
the advertisements!
8:00 "Glee" returns with the
post-Superbowl explosion of
football, musical theater and
Michael Jackson (Fox).
Monday at 9 p.m.: "Gossip
Girl" has an episode titled
"Panic Roommate," which is
ironic given Leighton
Meester's starring turn as a
murderous college freshman
in the feature film "The
Roommate" (CW).
Tuesday at 9 p.m.: "White
Collar" has returned! Hunky
reformed bad boys abound
(USA).

a window into the dirty, simple mind of
the heterosexual male.

Although sex and its politics occupy
the heart of the show's humor, the comic
book animation affords the writers a sur
prising ability to manipulate body and

voice for a laugh. The sensibility is best
described as "crass," but I'm impressed by
its ability to diagnose institutional
absurdities regarding office decorum, the
world of business, class, gender and
nationality. The writers have taken the

first "I" in ISIS to heart, as the show
spares no country or state. I would liken
its sense of humor at certain moments to
"Arrested Development," a comparison
that is always a sign of high quality. The
