## Roxy Sass takes on the Super Bowl 
### â€“ roxy SASS 
Super Bowl weekend: bringing
America together by dividing
it in two. For those currently
trying to bed someone who is
invested in the game's outcome,
pray to the powers that be for a
victory for the preferred team,
since the outcome can mean tri
umphant sex or mopey sex. The
latter group has Roxy's sincerest
sympathies.
But for those not yet at bedfel
low status and looking to impress
that sporty gent or lady in your
life, the Super Bowl is the perfect
opportunity to display your
knowledge of football strategies.
Although Roxy's not the best when
it comes to defensive tactics (mak
ing her easy prey for Ben
Roethlisberger), she's a great offen
sive coordinator and knows the
value of a tight end both on and
off the field.
Plus, Roxy's going to be hon
est here: the full-contact rough
housing and beautiful arc of a
well-thrown pass really get her
clock ticking. Even after the game
is over, Roxy's down for some full
on tackles, a few face masks (for
when she wants it rough) or even
an unexpected sack. Then sprinkle
in a wildcat formation here and
there, take it to the end zone and
then to cap it off, don't neglect to
split Roxy's uprights.
Besides the pure joy of a well
played football game and the, er,
post-game recap, Roxy knows that
a big game such as this one is

prime opportunity to get some
gambling in. While Roxy's familiar
with the concept of beating the
spread it is, after all, a position
she's been in often she's also
open to over/under betting as long
as it's followed by some over/under
bedding. Or if that fails to excite,
perhaps some exotic prop bets;
Roxy's got an open mind.
And which team gets Roxy's
vote this Sunday? Hard to say:
Roxy would rather you steel her
than pack her, even if you barely
know her. But she does also look
damn cute in a hat shaped like a
wedge of cheese. Instead of
attempting prescience, she's just
going to let winner take all.
Touchdown, Roxy.
