# COMING UP SHORT
## STANFORD HANGS WITH ARIZONA, FALLS LATE 
### JACOB JAFFE DESK EDITOR 
For one of the first times this season, the offense
was clicking for the Stanford men's basketball team.
Unfortunately for the Cardinal (11-10,4-6 Pac-10),
the defense uncharacteristically did not come to
play in a 78-69 loss to No. 21 Arizona (19-4,8-2) on
Thursday night. The 78 points represented the third
highest total Stanford has allowed all season, and the
Wildcats were the first opponent to break 70 points
against the Cardinal since Oklahoma State in mid-
December.
Junior guard Jeremy Green led Stanford with 21
points, but he shot only 8-for-21 from the field. Ju
nior forward Josh Owens had 13 points and nine re
bounds, while junior guard Jarrett Mann had 11
points, eight rebounds and five assists.
For Arizona, sophomore forward Derrick
Williams, who leads the Wildcats in scoring and re
bounding, was dominant once again with 21 points
and eight rebounds. Sophomore guard Lamont
Jones, junior forward Jesse Perry and junior guard
Kyle Fogg each reached double digits as well for Ari
zona, which has now won seven of its past eight
games.
In the early going, Stanford appeared frustrated
on both ends of the floor. Halfway through the first
half, Arizona opened up a nine-point advantage at
26-17, due in large part to Stanford's foul trouble. In
the first half alone, five different Cardinal players —
including four starters — picked up two fouls
apiece.
With so many of its core players on the bench,
Stanford head coach Johnny Dawkins turned to a
lineup of Mann and four freshmen — Anthony
Brown, John Gage, Aaron Bright and Josh Huestis.
Despite the lack of experience on the floor, the gam
ble paid dividends as the Cardinal went on a run to

get back in the game. A three-point
er by Gage capped an 8-0 run that
cut the Arizona lead to one.

Spurts were common from both
teams, though, and the Wildcats im
mediately responded with seven
straight to bolster the lead back up
to eight. Stanford fought back with
another 8-0 run, including two more
Gage three-pointers, to tie the
game at 33. Gage, a freshman from
Vashon Island, Wash., has received
very limited playing time through
out the season and had made only
five field goals all year before his
three consecutive three-pointers.
"The one guy who doesn't play
as much who really gave us a spark
late in the first half was John Gage,"
Dawkins said. "I'm proud of him
coming in under those circum
stances in this type of a game and
really stepping up and playing the
way he did."
After a great defensive posses
sion by Stanford, Fogg hit a three
pointer at the shot-clock buzzer to
quiet the crowd, and Perry hit an
other with four seconds left to give
Arizona a 39-33 halftime lead.
With its starting lineup back on

the floor, Stanford came out in
spired, scoring 12 of the first 13
points of the second half, including
an 8-0 run to take its first lead of the
game. Green took control, punctu
ating the run with a coast-to-coast
dunk and a layup.

Six minutes into the second half,
the Cardinal led, 45-40, and had not
allowed a field goal in the half. That
turned out to be the last time Stan
ford would lead all game, as
Williams finally broke the string
with a putback, part of a 9-0 Wildcat
run.

"It was a game of runs through
out the entire night, and unfortu
nately we didn't have the opportu
nity to make the last run," Dawkins
said.

As the second half wore on, the
game remained close and the fouls
started to pile up again, putting
both teams in the bonus with plenty
of time remaining. Consecutive

layups by freshman forward
Dwight Powell four of his six
points for the game tied the
game at 58 with just five minutes to
play.

Stanford made only two field
goals the rest of the way, though,
and the Wildcats made clutch shots
down the stretch. While the Cardi
nal was its usual inconsistent self at
the free-throw line, Arizona made
all eight of its charity shots in the
final 1:23 to secure the victory.
For the game, the Wildcats shot
53 percent from the field, while
Stanford shot only 41 percent. The
Cardinal had 16 offensive re
bounds, which were converted to 22
second-chance points. Flowever,
Stanford shot only 6-for-25 from
the three-point line, including 1-for
-13 in the second half. Arizona leads
the country in three-point field goal
defense, allowing only 27 percent
from beyond the arc.
Up next for the Cardinal is Ari
zona State, who Stanford defeated,
70-56, last month in Tempe. The Sun
Devils have lost seven consecutive
Pac-10 games and have not won a
road game since Jan. 1.
Stanford and Arizona State tip
off on Saturday at 3 p.m. at Maples
Pavilion.
