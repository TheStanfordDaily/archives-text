# COMING UP SHORT
## STANFORD HANGS WITH ARIZONA, FALLS LATE 
### JACOB JAFFE DESK EDITOR 
For one of the first times this season, the offense
was clicking for the Stanford men's basketball team.
Unfortunately for the Cardinal (11-10,4-6 Pac-10),
the defense uncharacteristically did not come to
play in a 78-69 loss to No. 21 Arizona (19-4,8-2) on
Thursday night. The 78 points represented the third
highest total Stanford has allowed all season, and the
Wildcats were the first opponent to break 70 points
against the Cardinal since Oklahoma State in mid-
December.
Junior guard Jeremy Green led Stanford with 21
points, but he shot only 8-for-21 from the field. Ju
nior forward Josh Owens had 13 points and nine re
bounds, while junior guard Jarrett Mann had 11
points, eight rebounds and five assists.
For Arizona, sophomore forward Derrick
Williams, who leads the Wildcats in scoring and re
bounding, was dominant once again with 21 points
and eight rebounds. Sophomore guard Lamont
Jones, junior forward Jesse Perry and junior guard
Kyle Fogg each reached double digits as well for Ari
zona, which has now won seven of its past eight
games.
In the early going, Stanford appeared frustrated
on both ends of the floor. Halfway through the first
half, Arizona opened up a nine-point advantage at
26-17, due in large part to Stanford's foul trouble. In
the first half alone, five different Cardinal players —
including four starters — picked up two fouls
apiece.
With so many of its core players on the bench,
Stanford head coach Johnny Dawkins turned to a
lineup of Mann and four freshmen — Anthony
Brown, John Gage, Aaron Bright and Josh Huestis.
Despite the lack of experience on the floor, the gam
ble paid dividends as the Cardinal went on a run to

eight-point run in the second half to keep Stanford close. Powell finished with six points.
