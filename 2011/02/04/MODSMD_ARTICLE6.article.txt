## SPEAKERS AND EVENTS Ford CEO stresses roots, creativity 
### NIKHIL JOSHI SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Alan Mulally, president and
CEO of the Ford Motor Company,
has a lot to say about leading a busi
ness. Since Bill Ford handed him the
keys to the then struggling car man
ufacturer in Sept. 2006, Mulally has
led the company's share price to a
nine-year high, while GM and
Chrysler, its two main domestic
competitors, went bankrupt and
were bailed out by the government.
But yesterday, speaking at the
GSB's "View From the Top" lecture
series at Bishop Auditorium, Mulal
ly, armed with a notepad and pencil,
was there to listen.

"Let's do a case study on Ford.
I'm looking for a few more good
ideas," Mulally said. "This is Stan
ford. We've got the smartest people
in the world. What are we going to
do?"

When Mulally arrived in Detroit
in 2006, after a successful career at
Boeing, he inherited a company

that was projected to lose $l7 bil
lion that year. Ford, Mulally said,
was a regionalized "house of
brands," with no comprehensive
strategy, no scale and no global inte
gration.

"We were unprofitable in every
one of those brands, and on every
model we were losing money," he
said.

As audience members began
rattling off turnaround plans, Mu
lally repeatedly commented on the
stunning simplicity of the ideas that
fueled Ford's return to profitability.
The MBAs in the audience sug
gested investments in R&D, reposi
tioning and simplifying the Ford
brand, figuring out what customers
want, lowering reliance on incen
tives and cutting dividends. Turn by
turn, Mulally would chime in with a
"really" or a "wow."

These ideas felt like no-brainers.
But putting them into action in De
troit, at a company with 100 years of
history and a variety of entrenched
interests, was not as easy.

"I would propose to you that
everything you said is about leader
ship," Mulally said. "Because every
one of those is a courageous deci-

To really turn Ford around, Mu
lally said, the company had to move
back to its roots, and attack the auto
market with the same discipline and
creativity as Flenry Ford showed

100 years ago. Mulally spoke pas
sionately about Ford's ability to
continue to play a global leadership
role today.
"We are a key part of the solu
tion for economic growth, but also
environmental sustainability and
energy security," Mulally said.
First, however, Ford needs to
continue doing what it has again

begun doing so well selling cars.
Yesterday, Mulally made it clear
that he is attuned to that mission.
"I'll be outside after this to take
your car orders," he quipped.
"We've got some great vehicles for
you."
