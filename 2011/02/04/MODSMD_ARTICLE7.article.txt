## RA Advisory Board to serve as campus liaison 
### THEO MATTHEWS 
In an effort to increase awareness and ac
countability regarding students' concerns, a
new Residential Assistant Advisory Board
will meet with Residential Education staff
members, including deans, assistant and as
sociate directors, over the next several
weeks. The board will function as a liaison to
various student groups and work to educate
and solicit opinions from RAs on new ResEd
initiatives.

The board, which will feature eight to 10
current first-year and returning RAs, aims to
embody a range of residential groups on
campus including all-freshman dorms, eth
nic-themed houses and Row houses.

Brandon Jackson 'l3, an RA in Castano,
proposed the formation of the board as a
way to provide feedback and respond to
Res Ed's logistics.

"I wanted to create a formal mechanism
that would allow student staff members to
have a recognizable voice as ResEd contin
ues to grow and develop," Jackson said.
During fall quarter, Jackson approached

ResEd assistant director Cisco Barron with
an initiative that outlined a plan to better in
tegrate RA staff into the department.
"The RA Advisory Board is not a voting
board," Jackson said. "Rather, it is away for
a select group of current RAs to represent
the many different perspectives and view
points that student staff members and resi
dents have."

Jennifer Calvert, associate dean of
ResEd, said that ResEd was also seeking a
solution to better integration, and was on the
frontier of this initiative.

"We envision the board as a group that
thinks together," Calvert said.
"As we are putting the board together, we
have been looking for RAs who are able and
willing to talk to and work with the RAs in
their area to represent a spectrum of opin
ions to the board," she added.

The inclusion of the new RA Advisory
Board comes after months of concerns
among RAs that ResEd did not fully consid
er student concerns when changes to the RA


AN ASTASIA YEE/ The Stanford Daily
application process were an
nounced last quarter.
"In the past, there have been
some concerns from students
about the lack of transparency and
the overly bureaucratic nature of
ResEd," Jackson said. "Hopefully,
this board will be able to bridge the
current perceived gap between stu
dents and administrators who they
often don't get to have much con
tact with throughout the year."
Over winter break, ResEd sent
out e-mails to all of the RA staff to
get a sense of how interested they
were in working to create the new

board. In addition, ResEd held an
informational meeting last Thurs
day, at the end of which they invited
RAs to apply for the board. The ap
plications were closed on Monday.
Nearly finished with the RA in
terview process, ResEd is now tak
ing steps to prepare for managerial
staff positions.
"ResEd is an incredibly large
and complex organization,"
Calvert said. "As we think about
developing the residential pro
gram, we have many constituents
and many variables that need to be
considered. This board is one effort
to ensure that our RAs have a sys
temic way to be a part of the con
versation."

be a part of the
conversation"
