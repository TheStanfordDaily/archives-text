## Lab taps new smart phone technology 
### NARDOS GIRMA 
A team of researchers at the
Stanford Mobile and Social Com
puting Research Group is studying
applications of a groundbreaking
technology that could change the
way people use their phones. This
technology, called Near Field Com
munication (NFC), allows devices to
interact in a new way and is expected
to become standard in smart phones
within the next five years.
NFC works by transmitting
shortwave radio signals. Its potential
uses include the transfer of files, ap
plications and information, all
through the simple touch of a cell
phone to another device,
Nokia and pay Wave credit cards
also implemented similar technolo
gy. Ben Dodson, a graduate student
in computer science and a member
of the research team, believes that
the implementation of NFC will be
driven by the payment option it of

fers.
"We expect it to be as standard of
a feature as Bluetooth became,"
Dodson said. "People will want to
use phones to make payments, so it
could become a new revenue stream
for Google and Verizon to start mak
ing transaction fees for every time
you go to make a payment with your
phone."
The NFC research currently con
ducted at the Stanford MobiSocial
Research Laboratory focuses on
how applications can take advantage
of NFC as opposed to studying the
payment method.
"What really excites us is that you
get two objects really close together,
and that in itself is enough to make
them interact," said Dodson. "You
don't have to press buttons. You
don't have to launch an app even.
You just get them close together and
