## Lab taps new smart phone technology 
### NARDOS GIRMA 
A team of researchers at the
Stanford Mobile and Social Com
puting Research Group is studying
applications of a groundbreaking
technology that could change the
way people use their phones. This
technology, called Near Field Com
munication (NFC), allows devices to
interact in a new way and is expected
to become standard in smart phones
within the next five years.
NFC works by transmitting
shortwave radio signals. Its potential
uses include the transfer of files, ap
plications and information, all
through the simple touch of a cell
phone to another device,
Nokia and pay Wave credit cards
also implemented similar technolo
gy. Ben Dodson, a graduate student
in computer science and a member
of the research team, believes that
the implementation of NFC will be
driven by the payment option it of

fers.
"We expect it to be as standard of
a feature as Bluetooth became,"
Dodson said. "People will want to
use phones to make payments, so it
could become a new revenue stream
for Google and Verizon to start mak
ing transaction fees for every time
you go to make a payment with your
phone."
The NFC research currently con
ducted at the Stanford MobiSocial
Research Laboratory focuses on
how applications can take advantage
of NFC as opposed to studying the
payment method.
"What really excites us is that you
get two objects really close together,
and that in itself is enough to make
them interact," said Dodson. "You
don't have to press buttons. You
don't have to launch an app even.
You just get them close together and
something happens."
Of course, NFC isn't foolproof
yet. Such an increase in mobility and
openness comes with an expected
amount of concern about privacy
and security. Although the maxi
mum transmission distance for most
devices is about eight centimeters,
the addition of a sufficiently strong
antenna could enable interference, a
type of eavesdropping on informa
tion transmissions.

Flowever, users would also have
the option of disabling NFC in their
phones, just as Bluetooth can be
turned off. Scott Klemmer, assistant
professor of computer science, who
researches barcodes and interface
design, voiced a possible concern
with the accelerated movement to
wards digital technology.
"When we start to put informa
tion digitally, it raises the question of
how long that information is going
to be accessible by the outside
world," Klemmer said. "So for tran
sient information, these technolo
gies are really valuable. But when
you're banking on that information
being there centuries from now, it's a
more challenging proposition."
Research in NFC technology is
only a portion of a much larger proj
ect that MobiSocial is pursuing. The
lab, in fact, received a $lO million
grant from the National Science
Foundation to be used over five
years.
Monica Lam, professor of com
puter science and a faculty director

for the project, remarked on the im
portance universities play in creat
ing a programmable and accessible
Internet.
"A lot of companies are focusing
on proprietary software," Lam said.
"They like to lock people in on their
own proprietary systems. And that's
the reason why our project is fo
cused on breaking down the barriers
to openness."
However, companies sometimes
collaborate with researchers in the
MobiSocial laboratory. This collabo
ration aims to increase the efficiency
with which the NFC technology will
be incorporated into products.
The effect NFC technology may
have on the smart phone market is
still unclear. The only phone with
NFC technology currently on the
market is the Google Nexus S. Al
though there is some speculation
that NFC will be standard in the
next iPhone, it is unconfirmed.
"We know that NFC is going to
be very new," Lam said. "And we
want to be there and help create
open methods."
