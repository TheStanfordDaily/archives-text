## Lofgren dreams of reform for immigrant students in U.S. 
### ROBERT TOEWS STAFF WRITER 
U.S. Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren '7O spoke
in front of a large crowd in Tresidder yesterday
evening. Lofgren discussed her recent efforts to
pass the DREAM Act through Congress and
the challenges that the bill may face going for
ward.
The DREAM Act is an immigration reform
bill that aims to provide a process through which
immigrant students that came to the United
States illegally as minors can achieve permanent
resident status.
In the bill's current version, students qualify

for permanent residency if they arrived in the
U.S. before the age of 16, lived in the country for
a minimum of five consecutive years, graduated
from a U.S. high school and are "of good moral
character." These students could apply for a six
year "conditional" legal resident status.
At the end of this six-year period, they would
be eligible to become permanent residents if
they completed at least two years of higher edu
cation in the U.S. or served two years in the U.S.
military.
Though the House of Representatives
passed the bill last December, it was blocked by
filibuster in the Senate.
Lofgren, the senior Democrat on the House
Immigration Subcommittee and one of the bill's
chief proponents, lamented the fact that the bill
has not yet been enacted into law. She referred to
the illegal immigrant students that the DREAM
Act seeks to naturalize as "de facto Americans."
"When I think about this bill not passing, I
think about these young people who have done
all the things they were supposed to do, who
stayed in school and got good grades and played
by the rules," Lofgren said. "And now the coun
try they grew up in is not theirs legally, and they
have no prospects for the future."
Throughout her speech, Lofgren strove to
address misconceptions and arguments often
put forth by opponents of the bill.
"It is common to hear horror stories about
the negative impact that immigrants could have
on our society, but if you look at the statistics, im
migrants are more law-abiding in general," she
said. "They have higher rates of entrepreneur
ship, and they are more active in small business
development than Americans born here."
Lofgren was pessimistic about the bill's
prospects in the immediate future, pointing to
the Republican majority that took office in the
House in January and that immigration has re
cently become a polarizing topic.
"This is one aspect of immigration reform on
which we really should all agree, a bill whose
roots are in fact bipartisan," Lofgren said, adding
that John McCain, among other Republicans,
