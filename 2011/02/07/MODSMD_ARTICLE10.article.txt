## Palo Alto rail commission widens scope 
### â€”Kabir Sawhney DAILY NEWS STAFF 
In a meeting Thursday morning,
the Palo Alto City Council's High-
Speed Rail Committee voted to
change its name to the "City Council
Rail Committee," in an effort to tie
together the future of both the high
speed and commuter rail in the city.
Though the committee was ini
tially formed to examine and cri
tique the state's plans for a high
speed rail corridor, several factors
pushed it to consider the Caltrain
commuter-train service as well. The
committee cited an overall funding
struggle as one factor. The fact that
Caltrain and the proposed light rail
service would run on the same tracks
is another.
Specifically, the committee hopes
to use its clout to influence plans to
fund the Caltrain, a commuter serv
ice that links Palo Alto to San Fran
cisco and San Jose. Unlike other
public transportation services in the
Bay Area, including BART and San
Francisco's Muni, Caltrain lacks a
dedicated funding source.
Including Caltrain in its mandate
could also put the Rail Committee in
a better bargaining position for use
of the tracks with Caltrain, which

currently has the right-of-way.
The committee will continue to in
vestigate the proposed design and cost
of high-speed passenger rail, which
will connect Sacramento, San Francis
co, San Jose, Los Angeles and San
Diego. The San Francisco-San Jose
corridor would ran through Palo Alto.
