and the Bill Lane Center for the
American West hosted the first an
nual State of the West Symposium

region.

with an address on the West's eco
nomic outlook by John C.Williams,
executive vice president and re
search director at the Federal Re
serve Bank of San Francisco.
"After what was perhaps the
worst recession of the postwar era
and a recovery that proceeded in
fits and starts, the economy final
ly seems to be attaining escape
velocity," Williams said. "That is
to say, the recovery appears in
creasingly to be becoming self

sustaining, driven primarily by
private-sector demand rather
than relying so much on govern
ment support."
A subsequent talk, moderated
by SIEPR director John Shoven,
broached the topic of state pen
sion liabilities. It centered on a
debate between Joseph Dear,
chief investment officer of Cali
fornia Public Employees' Retire
