## THE 						TRANSITIVE PROPERTY Drinking and Driving 
### Cristopher Bautista 
So I buy a lot of alcohol (hooray
for being in college!), and due to
my rather youthful appearance,
I always get carded. It's gotten to the
point that whenever I've got a six
pack of Coronas (I don't care what
you say, Coronas are magical) at the
register I pull out my driver's license
without prompt. For many a cashier,
the illusion of maleness is foiled I
get awkwardly looked at from top to
bottom, and then awkwardly
"ma'am"-ed until I'm on the verge of
punching myself in the face. (Of
course, that should deter me from
buying alcohol, but for some strange
reason it doesn't.)
Last Friday, I finally mustered up
the courage to go to the DMV and
renew my driver's license under my
new name so I could finally buy alco
hol with dignity. Getting my new dri
ver's license was also special because
it would be the only official govern
ment document that would have pre
ferred gender on it. For other docu
ments, such as social security and
passports, I would have to remain
legally female until I've gone
through sexual reassignment surgery
(or SRS, for short), an option that if I
decided on it, would be far off in the
future. But for the driver's license,
things are a bit different at least in
the state of California, one can
change one's gender on a driver's li
cense with the signed consent of a
psychologist or physician licensed in
the United States. So, of course I
would take the opportunity to finally
be recognized as male.
After I got a haircut and put on a
nice collared shirt for my new li
cense picture, I arrived at the DMV
around 9 a.m., hoping to skip the
horrendously long lines of
course, with it being the DMV,
things had to be as inconvenient as
possible. Already there were hoards
of people with the same mindset as I
had. I was already grumpy because I
had to wake up early. Not a good
start to the morning.
I was quite nervous. Not to men
tion I also had a cold, I was stressing
out about some dorm events I had to
take care of, and I'll admit the last
week or two hadn't exactly gone ide
ally for me. Let's just say that I wasn't
in the mood to be discriminated
against. I had heard of a transwoman
who had been told at the DMV when
she tried to file her name and gender
change that she was going to hell
so I was strangely comforted by the
fact that if anything bad went down I
could just sue.
I had to wait for an hour and
time slows down in the DMV so one
minute feels like an entire day. I was
on the verge of punching myself in
the face to relieve my boredom (I
tend to almost punch myself in the
face a lot, apparently). When it was

my turn, I finally hurried over to the
designated window. There, a rather
bored looking woman looked at me
with dull eyes. I couldn't blame her
after all, this was the DMV, which
was anything but the most exciting
place to work.
"Hi," I said. My voice croaked half
due to the T, half because of the fact I
hadn't spoken in such a long time, "I
need to change my name and gender
on my driver's license."
"Do you have a new social securi
ty card?" she asked.
"Yeah." I handed her the request
ed document. "I also have my court
order." I gave her that, too.
"Wow, you're on top of every
thing," she told me.
"I've been waiting for this for a
while," I said.
"I can tell."
She told me she had never filed a
gender change form before. But she
was very sensitive about it. No ques
tions, no weird looks. I felt respected.
She walked us both through the
process. I think it was a good change
to her day, to finally see someone
who looked happy in the DMV,
which I think was why she was so nice
to me.
Some stamped paperwork and a
handsome new picture later. I was of
ficially Cristopher Marc Soriano
Bautista (and male!) on one more
government document. And it was
no big deal, either. I probably would
have experienced the same thing if I
were simply changing my address.
Overall, it was a wonderfully un
eventful experience.
Now I just have to wait three to
eight weeks for my beautiful new dri
ver's license to arrive in the mail. In
the meantime, I had to turn in my old
driver's license and it wasn't until I
got back at Stanford did I realize that
without a valid photo ID I can't buy
alcohol anymore. How on earth am I
going to manage now?

Cristopher is suffering from withdraw
al now that he's run out of Coronas. E
mail him at cmsb@stanford.edu.

waiting for this for
awhile"
