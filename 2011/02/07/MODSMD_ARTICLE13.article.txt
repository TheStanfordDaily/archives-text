## A 						Big Show 
### Zack Hoberg Dave Grundfest 
For the 2010-2011 academic year the Stanford Con
cert Network (SCN) received $133,055 in special
fees, more than any other student group. SCN is
tasked with providing contemporary live music to the
Stanford undergraduate community, and the majority
of their funding $96,000 in 2010-2011 goes direct
ly to artists, paying to have them perform on campus.
Although the group does a great job of putting on a
consistent variety of high quality small performances,
when it comes to large performance with big-name
artists, they're somewhat lacking. When was the last
time you went to a big-name concert on campus? Or
better yet, when was the last time you went to a concert
with more than a couple hundred people there? Obvi
ously large venue shows, with big-name artists, are a rar
ity at Stanford we sure haven't been to any recently
but why can't Stanford have big-name concerts?
If you ask SCN the answer is budgetary and goes
something like this: SI33K is in the neighborhood of
what it would cost to bring one really big name to cam
pus once, and a group tasked with facilitating all the live
music on campus can't justify spending it's entire budg
et on one or two shows. This combined with strict regu
lations on event sponsorship keeps most big-name tal
ent out of Stanford's price range. Fair enough. But su
perstar talent aside, why can't the few bigger name con
certs we have take place in a venue more conducive for
live performances than the Alumni Center?
Tlie quick answer: because Stanford has an adminis
trative department for everything, and usually an over
sight committee or two for good measure. Planning
major events at Stanford is a bureaucratic and logistical
nightmare, with enough red tape to make anyone want
to keep things small. Take Frost Amphitheatre, by far
the best venue for a big live concert on campus: to
schedule an event there requires a request to the Reg
istrar's Office to reserve the space, then an application
to the Office of Special Events & Protocol followed by
a review from the Committee on Public Events, all sim
ply to tentatively book the space. Once that's taken care
of, you have to deal with the fact that there is limited in
frastructure in place to handle these kinds of events
easily. So it's off to 12 or so other departments to handle
everything from sound and lighting to security, ticket
ing, crowd control, trash and recycling, janitorial servic
es and temporary restrooms. Then again it's not impos

sible, either. In spring of 2006 SCN hosted a sold-out
show in Frost featuring Mos Def who charged S4OK to
be there, a big chunk of their budget. But who wouldn't
happily trade the concerts we have now for a sold-out
show in Frost every quarter, even if the tickets were
$18? Perhaps most telling is that there are only two
events scheduled at Frost for the remainder of the
school year an Admit Weekend performance and
Multicultural Springfest, both put on by University de
partments with full time staff to plan and coordinate.
So what's the answer? Well for starters, the SCN
could shift their focus from small, niche shows, to host
ing a broad interest show in a major venue every quar
ter. The University already requires that all shows in
Frost be ticketed, so they might as well charge a nomi
nal ticket fee for those who actually choose to attend.
Considering that Frost's capacity is around 6,000 peo
ple, a full house with everyone paying 10 bucks to at
tend would be nearly half of SCN's annual budget in
ticket revenue. Pulling this off would require an enor
mous amount of energy on the part of SCN and more
hours spent filling out forms and navigating confound
ing University regulation than we care to imagine. We
don't envy whoever has to do it, but someone should
and SCN looks like the best candidate.
The underlying issue is that while the University ex
pressly prohibits few things, they do a great job of regu
lating to death. If you make the activation energy for
student planned events too high, they simply don't hap
pen. There are university employees tasked with every
thing from promoting diversity, to planning cultural
events and organizing community building activities, so
why can't we have one or two whose sole purpose is to
put together big events where a wide cross-section of
the student body shows up and has a great time?
Sounds like community-building at its finest to us.
