## WILDCATS TAMED No. 4 Cardinal tops Arizona in Tuscon 
### JACK BLANCHAT DESK EDITOR 
In an already remarkable season,
the No. 4 Stanford women's basket
ball team made more history on Sat
urday when it beat the Arizona Wild
cats, 91-61, for its record-tying 48th
straight Pac-10 victory.
The Stanford starters put the game
out of reach early as Stanford (20-2,
11-0 Pac-10) led t>y 10 less than five
minutes into the game.

Even though the Wildcats (13-9,4-
7) cut the lead to just five a few min
utes later, Stanford took back a 21-11
lead with 11:53 left in the first half on
a Lindy La Rocque three, and Ari
zona never made a run again.
All five starters finished with dou
ble-digit point totals, with senior
Jeanette Pohlen making five three
pointers en route to 17 points, and

senior Kayla Pedersen and La
Rocque adding 14 apiece. Junior
Nnemkadi Ogwumike had 13 points
and tied her season high with 14 re
bounds, and her sister, freshman
Chiney Ogwumike, had 11.
Stanford was coming off an un
spectacular performance at Arizona
State, where it led by only five points
at halftime and finished with a 72-54
victory, its closest margin of the con
ference season. But the Cardinal
reprised its role as the dominant force
in the Pac-10 with a 30-point victory in
Tucson.
Stanford's effort handed the Wild
cats their fourth straight loss, drop
ping them to just 4-7 in the Pac-10.
Arizona got 19 points from Ify
Ibekwe, 16 points from Davellyn
Whyte and 11 points from Shanita
Arnold, but the trio didn't get much
help.
Meanwhile, Stanford's 48-game
Pac-10 winning streak tied the record
set by the 1995-1998 Cardinal, who
didn't lose a game in conference from
Feb. 9,1995 to Jan. 12,1998.
Despite the somewhat sour game
at Arizona State, the Cardinal's
record-tying win was the latest in a
good week for Stanford overall, and
especially for Pohlen.The senior from
Brea, Calif., had 36 points, 10 assists,
four steals and just three turnovers on

the trip to the desert, and she was also
added to the State Farm Wade Watch
List on Wednesday, joining Stanford
teammates Nnemkadi Ogwumike
and Pedersen in contention for one of
the most prestigious awards in colle
giate women's basketball.
So far, Pohlen is having her career
best season in a Cardinal uniform, as
she is averaging 16.6 points per game,
4.86 assists per game, shooting a solid
45.4 percent from the floor and shoot
ing 44.7 percent from three-point
range.
Should Pohlen's dominant play
continue, the Cardinal will have no
trouble rewriting the history books
once again with a new Pac-10 streak,
especially in a season that has already
seen head coach Tara VanDerveer win
her 800 th career game, Pedersen be
come the all-time leader in minutes
played for the Cardinal and, of course,
the victory over then-No. 1 UConn to
snap the Huskies' 90-game winning
streak.
The Cardinal returns to the Farm
on Thursday night when it puts its 48-
game Pac-10 winning streak on the
line against Washington State back.
Tip-off with the Cougars is scheduled
for 7 p.m.
