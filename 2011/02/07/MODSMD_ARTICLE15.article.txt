Super Bowl holes:
What's overrated
Daniel
Bohm
On My Mind
It's officially baseball sea
son! I think that is my first
thought every year when
the Super Bowl ends. Still,
despite the apathy I ex
pressed for this year's big game
two weeks ago, this one turned
out okay, no?
Early in the game, it looked as
though it could be a rout, which is
the last thing a fan like myself,
with no invested interest in the
game, wants. But it went down to
the last possession and that's
all I can ask for.
Now, in what has become my
staple (or at least so I'm told by
my friends), I must be a bit of a
cynic and point out all the over
rated parts of the Super Bowl
because they were copious and
obvious this year.
First: a running game. This is
less about the Super Bowl and
more about the state of football
today. The Green Bay Packers
just won the Super Bowl with ba
sically no running game, at all. Al
most all year, they couldn't run
the ball whatsoever, which can
normally be overcome for maybe
a game or two, but not for an en
tire season. Their leading rusher
in the Super Bowl, James Starks,
was basically unknown prior to
the playoffs and wasn't really a
factor in yesterday's win.
Gone, I suppose, are the days
when teams felt the need to con
trol the clock and grind out wins.
It's a quarterback's league now, as
evidenced by Aaron Rodgers'
performance today and through
out the season.
Second: Ben Roethlisberger. I
already know I'm going to get
some flak for calling Roethlis
berger overrated. Yes, he has won
two Super Bowls, and yes, his ca
reer numbers scale to about those
of Tom Brady. I acknowledge
both of those facts. Maybe it is his
off-putting nature, or his inability
to lead the Steelers on a game
winning drive in the final two
minutes. Or maybe it is simply the
fact that he lacks the "wow" fac
tor,but Big Ben just doesn't instill
confidence in me.
I tweeted before the game
that maybe Roethlisberger was
the second coming of Stanford
legend Jim Plunkett a two
time Super Bowl champion who
will never make the Hall of Fame.
It's not a knock on Plunkett, who
may well deserve a spot in Can
ton, but more a point that winning
Super Bowls as a quarterback
does not necessarily mean you
are great.
Tliird: Joe Buck. This could
probably be widened to all Fox
Sports coverage. To be fair, I
found Buck less nauseating today
Card avenges
loss to UCLA
By CHRISSY JONES
Playing in front of a large, en
thusiastic crowd at the Taube
Family Tennis Stadium, the Stan
ford women's tennis team strode
past the UCLA Bruins in ar
guably one of its toughest match
es this season with a 5-2 victory
on Saturday.
The No. 1 Cardinal (4-0) won
its fourth straight match of the
season against No. 4 UCLA (4-
2), maintaining its top national
ranking in the process.
"I think this was definitely an
important win for us," said senior
Hilary Barte. "It is still pretty
early in the season, but I think
this win proves how tough we
are."
Barte and sophomore Mallo
ry Burdette defeated UCLA's
top doubles team of Courtney
Dolehide and Andrea Remynse,
8-4, securing Stanford's first dou
bles victory. However, the Card's
number-two doubles team of
freshmen Nicole Gibbs and
Kristie Ahn fell, 8-6, in a close
match to UCLA's Noelle Hickey
and McCall Jones. That left it up
to the match on court No. 3, be
tween Stanford's Carolyn
McVeigh and Veronica Li and
UCLA's Pamela Montez and
Carling Seguso, to break the tie.
The tandem of McVeigh and Li
gave the Cardinal the first point
of the match by securing an over
all doubles victory with an 8-5
win.
"In addition to our usual
preparation of improving indi
vidually and as a team, we also
focused a lot on our doubles play

some flak for calling Roethlis
berger overrated. Yes, he has won
two Super Bowls, and yes, his ca
reer numbers scale to about those
of Tom Brady. I acknowledge
both of those facts. Maybe it is his
off-putting nature, or his inability
to lead the Steelers on a game
winning drive in the final two
minutes. Or maybe it is simply the
fact that he lacks the "wow" fac
tor,but Big Ben just doesn't instill
confidence in me.
I tweeted before the game
that maybe Roethlisberger was
the second coming of Stanford
legend Jim Plunkett a two
time Super Bowl champion who
will never make the Hall of Fame.
It's not a knock on Plunkett, who
may well deserve a spot in Can
ton, but more a point that winning
Super Bowls as a quarterback
does not necessarily mean you
are great.

Card avenges
loss to UCLA
By CHRISSY JONES
Playing in front of a large, en
thusiastic crowd at the Taube
Family Tennis Stadium, the Stan
ford women's tennis team strode
past the UCLA Bruins in ar
guably one of its toughest match
es this season with a 5-2 victory
on Saturday.
The No. 1 Cardinal (4-0) won
its fourth straight match of the
season against No. 4 UCLA (4-
2), maintaining its top national
ranking in the process.
"I think this was definitely an
important win for us," said senior
Hilary Barte. "It is still pretty
early in the season, but I think
this win proves how tough we
are."
Barte and sophomore Mallo
ry Burdette defeated UCLA's
top doubles team of Courtney
Dolehide and Andrea Remynse,
8-4, securing Stanford's first dou
bles victory. However, the Card's
number-two doubles team of
freshmen Nicole Gibbs and
Kristie Ahn fell, 8-6, in a close
match to UCLA's Noelle Hickey
and McCall Jones. That left it up
to the match on court No. 3, be
tween Stanford's Carolyn
McVeigh and Veronica Li and
UCLA's Pamela Montez and
Carling Seguso, to break the tie.
The tandem of McVeigh and Li
gave the Cardinal the first point
of the match by securing an over
all doubles victory with an 8-5
win.
"In addition to our usual
preparation of improving indi
vidually and as a team, we also
focused a lot on our doubles play

Super Bowl holes:
What's overrated
Daniel
Bohm
On My Mind
It's officially baseball sea
son! I think that is my first
thought every year when
the Super Bowl ends. Still,
despite the apathy I ex
pressed for this year's big game
two weeks ago, this one turned
out okay, no?
Early in the game, it looked as
though it could be a rout, which is
the last thing a fan like myself,
with no invested interest in the
game, wants. But it went down to
the last possession and that's
all I can ask for.
Now, in what has become my
staple (or at least so I'm told by
my friends), I must be a bit of a
cynic and point out all the over
rated parts of the Super Bowl
because they were copious and
obvious this year.
First: a running game. This is
less about the Super Bowl and
more about the state of football
today. The Green Bay Packers
just won the Super Bowl with ba
sically no running game, at all. Al
most all year, they couldn't run
the ball whatsoever, which can
normally be overcome for maybe
a game or two, but not for an en
tire season. Their leading rusher
in the Super Bowl, James Starks,
was basically unknown prior to
the playoffs and wasn't really a
factor in yesterday's win.
Gone, I suppose, are the days
when teams felt the need to con
trol the clock and grind out wins.
It's a quarterback's league now, as
evidenced by Aaron Rodgers'
performance today and through
out the season.
Second: Ben Roethlisberger. I
already know I'm going to get
some flak for calling Roethlis
berger overrated. Yes, he has won
two Super Bowls, and yes, his ca
reer numbers scale to about those
of Tom Brady. I acknowledge

MEN'S VOLLEYBALL

WOMEN'S WATER POLO
Super Bowl holes:
What's overrated
Daniel
Bohm
On My Mind
It's officially baseball sea
son! I think that is my first
thought every year when
the Super Bowl ends. Still,
despite the apathy I ex
pressed for this year's big game
two weeks ago, this one turned
out okay, no?
Early in the game, it looked as
though it could be a rout, which is
the last thing a fan like myself,
with no invested interest in the
game, wants. But it went down to
the last possession and that's
all I can ask for.
Now, in what has become my
staple (or at least so I'm told by
my friends), I must be a bit of a
cynic and point out all the over
rated parts of the Super Bowl
because they were copious and
obvious this year.
First: a running game. This is
less about the Super Bowl and
more about the state of football
today. The Green Bay Packers
just won the Super Bowl with ba
sically no running game, at all. Al
most all year, they couldn't run
the ball whatsoever, which can
normally be overcome for maybe
a game or two, but not for an en
tire season. Their leading rusher
in the Super Bowl, James Starks,
was basically unknown prior to
the playoffs and wasn't really a
factor in yesterday's win.
Gone, I suppose, are the days
when teams felt the need to con
trol the clock and grind out wins.
It's a quarterback's league now, as
evidenced by Aaron Rodgers'
performance today and through
out the season.
Second: Ben Roethlisberger. I
already know I'm going to get
some flak for calling Roethlis
berger overrated. Yes, he has won
two Super Bowls, and yes, his ca
reer numbers scale to about those
of Tom Brady. I acknowledge
both of those facts. Maybe it is his
off-putting nature, or his inability
to lead the Steelers on a game
winning drive in the final two
minutes. Or maybe it is simply the
fact that he lacks the "wow" fac
tor,but Big Ben just doesn't instill
confidence in me.
I tweeted before the game
that maybe Roethlisberger was
the second coming of Stanford
legend Jim Plunkett a two
time Super Bowl champion who
will never make the Hall of Fame.
It's not a knock on Plunkett, who
may well deserve a spot in Can
ton, but more a point that winning
Super Bowls as a quarterback
does not necessarily mean you
are great.
Tliird: Joe Buck. This could
probably be widened to all Fox
Sports coverage. To be fair, I
found Buck less nauseating today

the last possession and that's
all I can ask for.
Now, in what has become my
staple (or at least so I'm told by
my friends), I must be a bit of a
cynic and point out all the over
rated parts of the Super Bowl
because they were copious and
obvious this year.
First: a running game. This is
less about the Super Bowl and
more about the state of football
today. The Green Bay Packers
just won the Super Bowl with ba
sically no running game, at all. Al
most all year, they couldn't run
the ball whatsoever, which can
normally be overcome for maybe
a game or two, but not for an en
tire season. Their leading rusher
in the Super Bowl, James Starks,
was basically unknown prior to
the playoffs and wasn't really a
factor in yesterday's win.
Gone, I suppose, are the days
when teams felt the need to con
trol the clock and grind out wins.
It's a quarterback's league now, as
evidenced by Aaron Rodgers'
performance today and through
out the season.
Second: Ben Roethlisberger. I
already know I'm going to get
some flak for calling Roethlis
berger overrated. Yes, he has won
two Super Bowls, and yes, his ca
reer numbers scale to about those
of Tom Brady. I acknowledge
both of those facts. Maybe it is his
off-putting nature, or his inability
to lead the Steelers on a game
winning drive in the final two
minutes. Or maybe it is simply the
fact that he lacks the "wow" fac
tor,but Big Ben just doesn't instill
confidence in me.
I tweeted before the game
that maybe Roethlisberger was
the second coming of Stanford
legend Jim Plunkett a two
time Super Bowl champion who
will never make the Hall of Fame.
It's not a knock on Plunkett, who
may well deserve a spot in Can
ton, but more a point that winning
Super Bowls as a quarterback
does not necessarily mean you
are great.
Tliird: Joe Buck. This could
probably be widened to all Fox
Sports coverage. To be fair, I
found Buck less nauseating today
Card avenges
loss to UCLA
By CHRISSY JONES
Playing in front of a large, en
thusiastic crowd at the Taube
Family Tennis Stadium, the Stan
ford women's tennis team strode
past the UCLA Bruins in ar
guably one of its toughest match
es this season with a 5-2 victory
on Saturday.
The No. 1 Cardinal (4-0) won
its fourth straight match of the
season against No. 4 UCLA (4-
2), maintaining its top national
ranking in the process.
"I think this was definitely an
important win for us," said senior
Hilary Barte. "It is still pretty
early in the season, but I think
this win proves how tough we
are."
Barte and sophomore Mallo
ry Burdette defeated UCLA's
top doubles team of Courtney
Dolehide and Andrea Remynse,
8-4, securing Stanford's first dou
bles victory. However, the Card's
number-two doubles team of
freshmen Nicole Gibbs and
Kristie Ahn fell, 8-6, in a close
match to UCLA's Noelle Hickey
and McCall Jones. That left it up
to the match on court No. 3, be
tween Stanford's Carolyn
McVeigh and Veronica Li and
UCLA's Pamela Montez and
Carling Seguso, to break the tie.
The tandem of McVeigh and Li
gave the Cardinal the first point
of the match by securing an over
all doubles victory with an 8-5
win.
"In addition to our usual
preparation of improving indi
vidually and as a team, we also
focused a lot on our doubles play

Card avenges
loss to UCLA
By CHRISSY JONES
Playing in front of a large, en
thusiastic crowd at the Taube
Family Tennis Stadium, the Stan
ford women's tennis team strode
past the UCLA Bruins in ar
guably one of its toughest match
es this season with a 5-2 victory
on Saturday.
The No. 1 Cardinal (4-0) won
its fourth straight match of the
season against No. 4 UCLA (4-
2), maintaining its top national
ranking in the process.
"I think this was definitely an
important win for us," said senior
Hilary Barte. "It is still pretty
early in the season, but I think
this win proves how tough we
are."
Barte and sophomore Mallo
ry Burdette defeated UCLA's
top doubles team of Courtney
Dolehide and Andrea Remynse,
8-4, securing Stanford's first dou
bles victory. However, the Card's
number-two doubles team of
freshmen Nicole Gibbs and
Kristie Ahn fell, 8-6, in a close
match to UCLA's Noelle Hickey
and McCall Jones. That left it up
to the match on court No. 3, be
tween Stanford's Carolyn
McVeigh and Veronica Li and
UCLA's Pamela Montez and
Carling Seguso, to break the tie.
The tandem of McVeigh and Li
gave the Cardinal the first point
of the match by securing an over
all doubles victory with an 8-5
win.
"In addition to our usual
preparation of improving indi
vidually and as a team, we also
focused a lot on our doubles play

Super Bowl holes:
What's overrated
Daniel
Bohm
On My Mind
It's officially baseball sea
son! I think that is my first
thought every year when
the Super Bowl ends. Still,
despite the apathy I ex
pressed for this year's big game
two weeks ago, this one turned
out okay, no?
Early in the game, it looked as
though it could be a rout, which is
the last thing a fan like myself,
with no invested interest in the
game, wants. But it went down to
the last possession and that's
all I can ask for.
Now, in what has become my
staple (or at least so I'm told by
my friends), I must be a bit of a
cynic and point out all the over
rated parts of the Super Bowl
because they were copious and
obvious this year.
First: a running game. This is
less about the Super Bowl and
more about the state of football
today. The Green Bay Packers
just won the Super Bowl with ba
sically no running game, at all. Al
most all year, they couldn't run
the ball whatsoever, which can
normally be overcome for maybe
a game or two, but not for an en
tire season. Their leading rusher
in the Super Bowl, James Starks,
was basically unknown prior to
the playoffs and wasn't really a
factor in yesterday's win.
Gone, I suppose, are the days
when teams felt the need to con
trol the clock and grind out wins.
It's a quarterback's league now, as
evidenced by Aaron Rodgers'
performance today and through
out the season.
Second: Ben Roethlisberger. I
already know I'm going to get
some flak for calling Roethlis
berger overrated. Yes, he has won
two Super Bowls, and yes, his ca
reer numbers scale to about those
of Tom Brady. I acknowledge
both of those facts. Maybe it is his
off-putting nature, or his inability
to lead the Steelers on a game
winning drive in the final two
minutes. Or maybe it is simply the
fact that he lacks the "wow" fac
tor,but Big Ben just doesn't instill
confidence in me.
I tweeted before the game
that maybe Roethlisberger was
the second coming of Stanford
legend Jim Plunkett a two
time Super Bowl champion who
will never make the Hall of Fame.
It's not a knock on Plunkett, who
may well deserve a spot in Can

Super Bowl holes:
What's overrated
Daniel
Bohm
On My Mind
It's officially baseball sea
son! I think that is my first
thought every year when
the Super Bowl ends. Still,
despite the apathy I ex
pressed for this year's big game
two weeks ago, this one turned
out okay, no?
Early in the game, it looked as
though it could be a rout, which is
the last thing a fan like myself,
with no invested interest in the
game, wants. But it went down to
the last possession and that's
all I can ask for.
Now, in what has become my
staple (or at least so I'm told by
my friends), I must be a bit of a
cynic and point out all the over
rated parts of the Super Bowl
because they were copious and
obvious this year.
First: a running game. This is
less about the Super Bowl and
more about the state of football
today. The Green Bay Packers
just won the Super Bowl with ba
sically no running game, at all. Al
most all year, they couldn't run
the ball whatsoever, which can
normally be overcome for maybe
a game or two, but not for an en
tire season. Their leading rusher
in the Super Bowl, James Starks,
was basically unknown prior to
the playoffs and wasn't really a
factor in yesterday's win.
Gone, I suppose, are the days
when teams felt the need to con
trol the clock and grind out wins.
It's a quarterback's league now, as
evidenced by Aaron Rodgers'
performance today and through
out the season.
Second: Ben Roethlisberger. I
already know I'm going to get
some flak for calling Roethlis
berger overrated. Yes, he has won
two Super Bowls, and yes, his ca
reer numbers scale to about those
of Tom Brady. I acknowledge
both of those facts. Maybe it is his
off-putting nature, or his inability
to lead the Steelers on a game
winning drive in the final two
minutes. Or maybe it is simply the
fact that he lacks the "wow" fac
tor,but Big Ben just doesn't instill
confidence in me.
I tweeted before the game
that maybe Roethlisberger was
the second coming of Stanford
legend Jim Plunkett a two
time Super Bowl champion who
will never make the Hall of Fame.
It's not a knock on Plunkett, who
may well deserve a spot in Can
ton, but more a point that winning
Super Bowls as a quarterback
does not necessarily mean you
are great.
Tliird: Joe Buck. This could
probably be widened to all Fox
Sports coverage. To be fair, I
found Buck less nauseating today
Card avenges
loss to UCLA
By CHRISSY JONES
Playing in front of a large, en
thusiastic crowd at the Taube
Family Tennis Stadium, the Stan
ford women's tennis team strode
past the UCLA Bruins in ar
guably one of its toughest match
es this season with a 5-2 victory
on Saturday.
The No. 1 Cardinal (4-0) won
its fourth straight match of the
season against No. 4 UCLA (4-
2), maintaining its top national
ranking in the process.
"I think this was definitely an
important win for us," said senior
Hilary Barte. "It is still pretty
early in the season, but I think
this win proves how tough we
are."
Barte and sophomore Mallo
ry Burdette defeated UCLA's
top doubles team of Courtney
Dolehide and Andrea Remynse,
8-4, securing Stanford's first dou
bles victory. However, the Card's
number-two doubles team of
freshmen Nicole Gibbs and
Kristie Ahn fell, 8-6, in a close
match to UCLA's Noelle Hickey
and McCall Jones. That left it up
to the match on court No. 3, be
tween Stanford's Carolyn
McVeigh and Veronica Li and
UCLA's Pamela Montez and
Carling Seguso, to break the tie.
The tandem of McVeigh and Li
gave the Cardinal the first point
of the match by securing an over
all doubles victory with an 8-5
win.
