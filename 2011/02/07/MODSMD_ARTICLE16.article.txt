# Super Bowl holes: What's overrated
## 
### Daniel Bohm On My Mind 
It's officially baseball sea
son! I think that is my first
thought every year when
the Super Bowl ends. Still,
despite the apathy I ex
pressed for this year's big game
two weeks ago, this one turned
out okay, no?
Early in the game, it looked as
though it could be a rout, which is
the last thing a fan like myself,
with no invested interest in the
game, wants. But it went down to
the last possession and that's
all I can ask for.
Now, in what has become my
staple (or at least so I'm told by
my friends), I must be a bit of a
cynic and point out all the over
rated parts of the Super Bowl
because they were copious and
obvious this year.
First: a running game. This is
less about the Super Bowl and
more about the state of football
today. The Green Bay Packers
just won the Super Bowl with ba
sically no running game, at all. Al
most all year, they couldn't run
the ball whatsoever, which can
normally be overcome for maybe
a game or two, but not for an en
tire season. Their leading rusher
in the Super Bowl, James Starks,
was basically unknown prior to
the playoffs and wasn't really a
factor in yesterday's win.
Gone, I suppose, are the days
when teams felt the need to con
trol the clock and grind out wins.
It's a quarterback's league now, as
evidenced by Aaron Rodgers'

performance today and through
out the season.
Second: Ben Roethlisberger. I
already know I'm going to get
some flak for calling Roethlis
berger overrated. Yes, he has won
two Super Bowls, and yes, his ca
reer numbers scale to about those
of Tom Brady. I acknowledge
both of those facts. Maybe it is his
off-putting nature, or his inability
to lead the Steelers on a game
winning drive in the final two
minutes. Or maybe it is simply the
fact that he lacks the "wow" fac
tor,but Big Ben just doesn't instill
confidence in me.
I tweeted before the game
that maybe Roethlisberger was
the second coming of Stanford
legend Jim Plunkett a two
time Super Bowl champion who
will never make the Hall of Fame.
It's not a knock on Plunkett, who
may well deserve a spot in Can
ton, but more a point that winning
Super Bowls as a quarterback
does not necessarily mean you
are great.
Tliird: Joe Buck. This could
probably be widened to all Fox
Sports coverage. To be fair, I
found Buck less nauseating today

than I do when he is paired in the
booth with the incredulous Tim Mc-
Carver for baseball, but still, for the
most watched sporting event ever,
fans deserve fewer inane or down
right senseless comments. There are
plenty of examples of silly state
ments, but maybe the finest is when
Buck was shocked that there was no
personal foul called on Brett Swain
for a perfectly legal hit he made cov
ering a punt. I wasn't particularly sur
prised, and maybe 1 am being harsh
calling a game is probably very dif
ficult but CBS, ABC and NBC all
consistently do a better job than
FOX.

FourthrThe Black Eyed Peas. And
the rest of the Super Bowl halftime
show, for that matter.
Where do I begin? First off, what
the hell were those outfits? Was that
a protective helmet on will.i.am's
head? Did they make Fergie wear

that weird body armor to make dou
ble sure that there wasn't another
"wardrobe malfunction"?
And what about the microphones
you'd think they would make sure
they functioned correctly prior to this
ultra-hyped show or maybe it was
something wrong with the singers'
voices. I'm no music expert. Lastly,
the cameos by Slash and Usher were
simply weird. It was as if the promot
ers were trying to pack a million ideas
into ten minutes (which is, I'm sure,
exactly what they were trying to do).
People thought the conservative
halftime shows with performers like
The Who andTomPettywere boring.
They were way better than the Black
Eyed Peas. (Side note: How strange is
it for 50- and 60-year olds to see the
word "conservative" describing the
performance of a band like The
Who?)
Despite these overrated aspects
of the day, it was a great game and a
great day to be a sports fan.
