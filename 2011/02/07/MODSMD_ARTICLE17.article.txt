### CHRISSY JONES 
Playing in front of a large, en
thusiastic crowd at the Taube
Family Tennis Stadium, the Stan
ford women's tennis team strode
past the UCLA Bruins in ar
guably one of its toughest match
es this season with a 5-2 victory
on Saturday.
The No. 1 Cardinal (4-0) won
its fourth straight match of the
season against No. 4 UCLA (4-
2), maintaining its top national
ranking in the process.

"I think this was definitely an
important win for us," said senior
Hilary Barte. "It is still pretty
early in the season, but I think
this win proves how tough we
are."

Barte and sophomore Mallo
ry Burdette defeated UCLA's
top doubles team of Courtney
Dolehide and Andrea Remynse,
8-4, securing Stanford's first dou
bles victory. However, the Card's
number-two doubles team of
freshmen Nicole Gibbs and
Kristie Ahn fell, 8-6, in a close
match to UCLA's Noelle Hickey
and McCall Jones. That left it up
to the match on court No. 3, be
tween Stanford's Carolyn
McVeigh and Veronica Li and
UCLA's Pamela Montez and
Carling Seguso, to break the tie.
The tandem of McVeigh and Li
gave the Cardinal the first point
of the match by securing an over
all doubles victory with an 8-5
win.

"In addition to our usual
preparation of improving indi
vidually and as a team, we also
focused a lot on our doubles play
