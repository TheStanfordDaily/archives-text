## 
### CHRISSY JONES 
Playing in front of a large, en
thusiastic crowd at the Taube
Family Tennis Stadium, the Stan
ford women's tennis team strode
past the UCLA Bruins in ar
guably one of its toughest match
es this season with a 5-2 victory
on Saturday.
The No. 1 Cardinal (4-0) won
its fourth straight match of the
season against No. 4 UCLA (4-
2), maintaining its top national
ranking in the process.

"I think this was definitely an
important win for us," said senior
Hilary Barte. "It is still pretty
early in the season, but I think
this win proves how tough we
are."

Barte and sophomore Mallo
ry Burdette defeated UCLA's
top doubles team of Courtney
Dolehide and Andrea Remynse,
8-4, securing Stanford's first dou
bles victory. However, the Card's
number-two doubles team of
freshmen Nicole Gibbs and
Kristie Ahn fell, 8-6, in a close
match to UCLA's Noelle Hickey
and McCall Jones. That left it up
to the match on court No. 3, be
tween Stanford's Carolyn
McVeigh and Veronica Li and
UCLA's Pamela Montez and
Carling Seguso, to break the tie.
The tandem of McVeigh and Li
gave the Cardinal the first point
of the match by securing an over
all doubles victory with an 8-5
win.

"In addition to our usual
preparation of improving indi
vidually and as a team, we also
focused a lot on our doubles play

Senior Hilary Barte, above, won in both doubles and No. 1 singles to lead the Cardinal women's tennis team over UCLA
by a score of 5-2 at Taube Tennis Stadium on Saturday.
for this match," Barte said. "I think
it showed and I'm very proud of the
team."
Riding its momentum from the
doubles victory, the Cardinal
quickly jumped ahead in singles
play, capturing the first set of the
match on five of the six courts.
In the No. 4 spot, Burdette took
the first singles victory, easily de
feating Dolehide, 6-0,6-1. This was
Burdette's first time playing in
both doubles and singles matches
since battling an undisclosed in
jury. Gibbs finished next as she
notched an equally impressive win
over Hickey, 6-3, 6-1, on court No.
3.Third to capture a win was Barte,
beating Jones at the No. 1 spot and
effectively sealing the win for Stan
ford, though there were three more
matches to be accounted for. Ahn
also produced a 6-4, 6-3 win over
Remynse on court No. 2.
After seeing them bounce back
from a doubles defeat, the veteran
Barte had nothing but good things
to say about the performance of
Ahn and Gibbs in winning their
singles matches.
"I think it is great that we have
two freshmen playing so high in
line," she said. "It sends a strong
message out about our team, and

they both have obviously been
doing a fabulous job. Nicole is so
gritty, so fierce, and Kristie fights
just as hard. I love looking down
and playing next to them."
Stanford's two losses came at
the No. 5 and No. 6 singles spots. Li
dropped both sets, 6-4, 6-4, to
UCLA's Maya Johansson. After
winning the first set in a tiebreaker
by 7-6 (5), Cardinal sophomore
Stacey Tan lost the next set, 2-6, to
Pamela Montez, and fell in the
tiebreaker 1-0 (10). Despite these
two singles losses, the Cardinal still
pulled out an inspiring victory over
the Bruins.
Playing at home certainly
helped the Cardinal, as many fans
came out to cheer in the beautiful,
sunny weather. With the Bruins
handing Stanford its only dual
match defeat last season, the Car
dinal was no doubt seeking re
venge on its home court.
The Cardinal will have this op
portunity when it faces UCLA
again on March 25 in Los Angeles.
The matchup will officially count
for the Pac-10 conference stand
ings, and will give UCLA the
chance to avenge its defeat.
Stanford seeks to pick up its
fifth victory in its next home match
on Thursday, Feb. 10, against
Southern Methodist University at
1:30 p.m.
