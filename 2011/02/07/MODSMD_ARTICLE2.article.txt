## BCS gains accrue to Stanford Orange Bowl leads to higher national profile 
### STEVEN SMALLBERG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With last season's unprecedent
ed success, Stanford football and
the University by extension re
ceived tremendous national expo
sure and publicity. Administrators
say, however, that it has been diffi
cult to quantify the benefits accrued
to Stanford from its accomplish
ments on the field.
"Stanford was being held out to
the nation as a shining example of
an institution that focuses on excel
lence among its student-athletes
on the field, court, classroom and
laboratory," wrote Martin Shell,
vice president for development, in
an e-mail to The Daily. "I have to
believe that some very real benefits
are accruing to the University be
cause of this."
Though gift support to Stanford
increased in the first five months of
the fiscal year starting Sept. 2010,
Shell cited the improving economy,
the stock market and The Stanford
Challenge fundraising campaign as
the primary causes for this growth.
He said athletic success in multiple
sports led to intangible gains.
"[The week] was quite special,"
Shell said, referring to victories in
women's basketball over the Uni
versity of Connecticut and men's
basketball over UC-Berkeley in the
days leading up to the BCS Orange
Bowl game.
"The spectacular Orange Bowl
victory came the next night," Shell
said. "Then, two days after the foot
ball team returned to campus, [red
shirt sophomore quarterback] An
drew Luck announced that he is re
maining on The Farm to complete
the academic work toward his de
gree. From a national exposure
standpoint, it was a remarkable
sports week for the Cardinal."
The publicity generated by the
culmination of the football season
is difficult to measure. One poten
tial gauge was hits on Stanford's
homepage, which received in
creased activity coinciding with the
Orange Bowl.
"On average, we get 45,000 hits a
day at Stanford's homepage," said
Lisa Lapin, assistant vice president
for university communications.
"On the day of the Orange Bowl,
we got 85,000 hits. That's just the
homepage, not gostanford.com or
the Orange Bowl website. It's hard
to say exactly what information
they were looking for, but it's clear
that the Orange Bowl doubled our
homepage traffic."
Arguably attracting even more
publicity than the Orange Bowl vic
tory was Luck's announcement that
he would stay at Stanford for an
other season.
"On the day that Andrew Luck
announced that he would finish his
degree at Stanford, there were over
1,000 different articles on Google
News by the end of the day, and he
was the number one Internet
search term for that day," Lapin
said. "That's remarkable exposure
for the University, especially con
sidering the positive reaction by
sportswriters and other pundits."
Stanford's appearance in the
Orange Bowl had fiscal benefits as

well, but these gains were not as
high as many expected. The rev
enue from the game will be distrib
uted among the schools of the Pac
-10 Conference.
"The money isn't necessarily the
windfall that people think it is, but
we've got a lot of good national at
tention, with East Coast media cov
erage and nationally televised
games," athletic director Bob
Bowlsby said. "That's great to pro
mote Stanford's national brand."
While the enthusiasm surround
ing the football team's success is
difficult to correlate with dona
tions, Shell said that season ticket
sales increased by 12 percent this
season.
"Based on the number of new
accounts and traffic at the ticket
site, I trust there will be an increase
in sales this coming season as well,"
Bowlsby said.
With a consensus top-25 recruit
ing class for next season, Bowlsby
said he has every expectation that
the Cardinal's run of success shall
continue going forward. He hesitat
ed, however, to characterize Stan
ford as a "football factory."
"That's not consistent with the
way we do things," he said. "Coach
[Jim] Harbaugh and his staff
demonstrated this season that you
can put of a team of academic
achievers in the classroom together
and have tremendous success on
the field."
