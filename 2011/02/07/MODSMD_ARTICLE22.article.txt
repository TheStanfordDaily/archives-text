# CHICAGO WIND-SWEPT
## 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH DESK EDITOR 
After dropping the opening frame at
Loyola of Chicago, the Stanford men's vol
leyball team captured three straight sets
for a hard-fought 3-1 victory. With the win,
the No. 2 Cardinal (8-2,5-2 MPSF) finished
off its sixth road match in its last seven
games, concluding a trip that began on Jan.
21 and saw Stanford play seven matches in
three different time zones, including stops
in Hawaii, Los Angeles and Chicago. The
Cardinal finished the tour with a 5-2
record.

Loyola (5-3) certainly didn't play like a
Div. II opponent on Saturday, coming out in
the first set with a blistering .667 hitting per
centage that overwhelmed the Cardinal.
But thanks to three early service aces, Stan
ford jumped out to an 8-2 lead in game two
and didn't look back, taking advantage of
seven Rambler service errors to take the
second set, 25-14.

"After losing the first set, we realized
that we had to be a little sharper on our side
of the net to compete with them, especially
after how they played in the first set," said
junior outside hitter Brad Lawson. "Lucki
ly for us, their serving game eased up and we
were able to get some better passes, which
helped us run a more balanced offense to
keep their blockers guessing."
The third set was much tighter, with 16
ties and four lead changes. But freshman
outside hitter Steven Irvin had a breakout
match off the bench and carried the Cardi
nal with seven kills in the third game alone.
With the score tied at 21-21, Irvin had a kill
to put Stanford up one, and then had anoth
er kill just two points later to make it 24-21.
Lawson put the game away and put Stan
ford up, two sets to one, with his third kill of
the game.

Lawson came on strong in the fourth set
with seven kills, but it was the play of anoth
er freshman that really made the difference
in another tight set. Freshman outside hit

ter Eric Mochalski had four kills in the
fourth set, but more importantly, he did not
miss an attack opportunity, going 6-for-6 on
the match. The hot hitting of Stanford's at
tack killed a late rally by Loyola, and the
Cardinal hit .500 while only missing five
side-out opportunities as the Ramblers
missed nine.
"The key was really our serving and
passing," said Stanford head coach John
Kosty. "The games we lost were due to the
other team being more efficient in their
passing and serving games."
In its first match of the weekend, against
Lewis University (6-2) in Chicago, Stanford
stepped into a hostile environment at Neil
Carey Arena. Kosty called the student sec
tion, "big and right in your face." And with
an announced attendance of 1,356 in a
1,100-seat building, the match felt much
more like a playoff game than a non-confer
ence match between Div. I Stanford and
Div. 11 Lewis.
Lawson had a match-high 19 kills and
the offense was certainly flowing behind a
.370 hitting percentage and junior Evan
Barry's 37 assists. But it was the defense that
carried the Cardinal past the Llyers, 3-1. Se
nior middle blocker Gus Ellis had seven of
Stanford's 15.5 blocks and set the tone with
a solo block on the first point of the match.
The Llyers hit just .270 on the night and
were forced into 21 attack errors that put
their offense on its heels.
"They had some really good young play
ers and a strong offense," Kosty said. "But
we showed that we can play at a high level
on the road. Their fans were certainly loud
but we kept our focus on the game plan."
Stanford got a great boost from its own
young players, most notably Brian Cook.
The freshman outside hitter from Santa
Cruz, Calif, had 10 kills, eight digs and four
blocks while hitting .500.
ft was a contribution Kosty has come to
expect from his young players Cook,
Mochalski and Irvin are third, fourth and
fifth on the team in kills, respectively.
With the last regular-season trip outside
California out of the way, the Cardinal re
turns home and jumps right back into the
MPSL frying pan with matches against UC-
San Diego and UC-lrvine on Lriday and
Saturday. The matches will both start at 7
p.m. at Maples Pavilion.

With the score tied at 21-21, Irvin had a kill
to put Stanford up one, and then had anoth
er kill just two points later to make it 24-21.
Lawson put the game away and put Stan
ford up, two sets to one, with his third kill of
the game.

Lawson came on strong in the fourth set
with seven kills, but it was the play of anoth
er freshman that really made the difference
in another tight set. Freshman outside hit

ter Eric Mochalski had four kills in the
fourth set, but more importantly, he did not
miss an attack opportunity, going 6-for-6 on
the match. The hot hitting of Stanford's at
tack killed a late rally by Loyola, and the
Cardinal hit .500 while only missing five
side-out opportunities as the Ramblers
missed nine.
"The key was really our serving and
passing," said Stanford head coach John
Kosty. "The games we lost were due to the
other team being more efficient in their
passing and serving games."
In its first match of the weekend, against
Lewis University (6-2) in Chicago, Stanford
stepped into a hostile environment at Neil
Carey Arena. Kosty called the student sec
tion, "big and right in your face." And with
an announced attendance of 1,356 in a
1,100-seat building, the match felt much
more like a playoff game than a non-confer
ence match between Div. I Stanford and
Div. 11 Lewis.
Lawson had a match-high 19 kills and
the offense was certainly flowing behind a
.370 hitting percentage and junior Evan
Barry's 37 assists. But it was the defense that
carried the Cardinal past the Llyers, 3-1. Se
nior middle blocker Gus Ellis had seven of
Stanford's 15.5 blocks and set the tone with
a solo block on the first point of the match.
The Llyers hit just .270 on the night and
were forced into 21 attack errors that put
their offense on its heels.
"They had some really good young play
ers and a strong offense," Kosty said. "But
we showed that we can play at a high level
on the road. Their fans were certainly loud
but we kept our focus on the game plan."
Stanford got a great boost from its own
young players, most notably Brian Cook.
The freshman outside hitter from Santa
Cruz, Calif, had 10 kills, eight digs and four
blocks while hitting .500.
ft was a contribution Kosty has come to
expect from his young players Cook,
Mochalski and Irvin are third, fourth and
fifth on the team in kills, respectively.
With the last regular-season trip outside
California out of the way, the Cardinal re
turns home and jumps right back into the
MPSL frying pan with matches against UC-
San Diego and UC-lrvine on Lriday and
Saturday. The matches will both start at 7
p.m. at Maples Pavilion.
