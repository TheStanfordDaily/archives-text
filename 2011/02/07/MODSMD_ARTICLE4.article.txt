# SSQL starts petition
## Opponents gather signatures to protest ROTC's return to campus 
### DANA EDWARDS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford Students for Queer Liberation (SSQL) started
an online petition last week to gain student support for ef
forts to block the reintroduction of ROTC to campus. The pe
tition had gathered 116 signatures at the time of publication.
A formal letter to the Faculty Senate headlined the peti
tion, outlining SSQL's objection to ROTC on the grounds
that the military continues to discriminate against transgen
der students. In the letter, SSQL argued that the return of
ROTC would "constitute a violation of our very own
nondiscrimination policy," a policy that prohibits exclusion
from campus programs and activities on the basis of gender
identity.
Last year, the Faculty Senate formed the Ad Floe Com
mittee on ROTC and tasked it to investigate the potential re
turn of the military to Stanford. The SSQL letter called for
the Faculty Senate to "remain at status quo and declare sup
port for transgender students' identity."
Mario Villaplana 'l4 and Alok Vaid-Menon 'l3, both ac
tive members of SSQL, authored the letter.
Though other campus groups such as National Marriage
Boycott (NMB) endorsed the petition, SSQL is chiefly re
sponsible for its rhetoric and for rallying students in support
of its cause.
"We're building momentum on this issue, trying to reach
out to concerned groups and students," said SSQL leader
Janani Balasubramanian 'l2. "This affects all of us who are
invested in the maintenance of the non-discrimination
clause."
On the other side of the issue, a
pro-ROTC coalition of students is
contemplating authoring a counter
petition, but nothing official is cur
rently circulating. Recent weeks
have seen a surge in the number of
people advocating for the military's
return to Stanford, including an en
dorsement from Professor Con
doleezza Rice and Hoover fellow
George Shultz, both of who are for
mer Secretaries of State.

Some proponents of ROTC
groups argue that barring transgen
der people from military service
does not clearly violate Stanford's
non-discrimination clause. They
claim that the clause only protects
against unlawful discrimination,
and that ROTC's policy is by defini
tion lawful.

Balasubramanian responded to
these claims by stating that legality
often comes down to a matter of se
mantics.

"It depends on which law
you're privileging," Balasubra
manian said. "We think that a rein
troduction of ROTC would not be
aligned with the way that Stanford
has protected gender identity in

the past, for instance in their ef
forts to provide sensitive housing
and health care to all members of
the community."
Balasubramanian hopes SSQL's
petition, which confirms signers'
Stanford affiliation by requiring e
mail addresses, will help sway the
Faculty Senate as the University de
cides whether or not to reinstate
ROTC. Balasubramanian and Vil
laplana both said the ad hoc com
mittee has been unclear regarding
the date of the announcement and
the degree to which it will take into
account popular student opinion.
