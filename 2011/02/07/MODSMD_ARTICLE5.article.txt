## Faculty Senate focuses on student mental health 
### AN LE NGUYEN MANAGING EDITOR 
The Faculty Senate convened Feb. 3 to ad
dress three topics: declining interest in the hu
manities, the opening of the new Graduate
School of Business campus and student mental
health.
The senate first broached the topic of under
graduate and graduate studies in the humani
ties, ceding the floor to University President
John Flennessy.
"We've seen across the country, not only at

Stanford but at many institutions, a decreasing
interest among students majoring in the human
ities," Hennessy said. Fie stated he and Provost
John Etchemendy have begun a discussion
about possible ways to address this trend.
"We explored in a preliminary fashion five
possible ideas," he said.
The first of these ideas was to rethink the In
troduction to the Humanities (IHUM) experi
ence, with the possibility of replicating the
Structured Liberal Education (SLE) program.
The second was to find ways to "attract more
students in courses in the humanities, above and

beyond meeting their minimum GER require
ments."
Hennessy also underscored the need to pro
vide better guidance and information to current
and potential humanities majors about future
careers with their humanities degrees. He next
mentioned efforts to draw undergraduates to
these degrees in the first place.
"We've also begun early discussion about
what we could do to attract more students to a
traditional liberal arts degree, focusing on ma-
jors in the humanities," he said.
The final point Hennessy ad
dressed was enhancing the experi
ence of Ph.D. students in the hu
manities. He stressed, in particular,
the need to prepare these graduate
students for careers outside of aca
demia.

GSB does show and tell
Following Hennessy's discus
sion, GSB dean Garth Saloner gave
a presentation on the business
school and its new Knight Manage
ment Center.
He commenced his talk with the
GSB's two-fold mission statement:
to create ideas that enhance under
standing of management and the
development of innovative, princi
pled and insightful leaders. The
GSB is currently comprised of 799
MBA candidates, 56 Sloan students
and 94 Ph.D. students.
Saloner stated that there had
been a major overhaul of the MBA
curriculum in the past few years.
"The MBA degree has really
matured, and a lot of students start
to think very early ... about going
to business school," he said.
According to Saloner, many of
these students came to the GSB as
"pre-MBA students," who already
did the "bread and butter of the
MBA program" as undergraduates
or professionals.
"That would not be a such prob
lem except for the fact that there's
an equivalent number of students
who never headed down this
track," Saloner said.
To that effect, he stated that a
"one-size-fits-all" model is no
longer appropriate for the diversity
of students at the GSB. The curricu
lum has since changed to enable
students to choose from a "menu"
of required courses. It has also been
revamped so that first-year MBA
students are required to have a
global immersion experience, such
as an overseas study trip or an in
ternship abroad.
Finally, Saloner spoke about the
new Knight Management Center,
which boasts eight new buildings,
structured around three quads. Ac
cording to the dean, "The impor
tant characteristic of this complex
from our perspective is that it is
much more flexible space."
He noted that this flexibility
matches "the needs of the new cur
riculum."
Mental health becomes focal point
The topics of mental health and
well being took up the latter half of
the meeting. The senate opened the
floor to a six-member panel, which
provided recommendations on
how faculty members can be more
attuned to student mental health is
sues.
The panel consisted of Dr. Ira
Friedman, Vaden Health Center di
rector and associate vice provost
for student affairs; Dr. Peter Kao,
associate professor of medicine and
Castano resident fellow; Dr. Rob
Albucher, director of Counseling
and Psychological Services (CAPS)
and clinical associate professor of
psychiatry; Sally Dickson, associate
vice provost for student affairs;
Chris Griffith, associate vice
provost for student affairs; and
ASSU President Angelina Car
dona 'll.
"We're seeing more press cover
age of stressed-out students," Fried
man said.
News coverage of national sur
veys and campus reporting echo
this sentiment. But Friedman was

quick to add, "Let us keep in mind,
however, that being on a college
campus is a protective factor." Col
lege students are actually better off
in measures of well being and
health than their age-matched
peers who do not attend college, he
said.

Kao emphasized the importance
of mental wellness among students
and said that the University has a
robust support network to foster
health and wellness.
To communicate some of the is
sues felt on campus, Cardona read
from an anonymous e-mail she re
ceived last year: "I think I can be
fun sometimes, and I sure know a
lot of people, but I don't have any
real friends... I feel socially awk
ward and out of place and commu
nity-less."

Cardona's description of stu
dent life demonstrated that the
"Stanford Duck Syndrome" a
topic that was raised on multiple
occasions was very much a reali
ty. Speaking on this "syndrome" at
the undergraduate level, Cardona
said, "The more I talk to my peers,
the more I realize that generally
everyone is overwhelmed here;
they're overstressed."
Graduate students and medical
students in residence in particular
also face a high level of stress on
campus. Efforts are underway to in
crease resources available to these
particular populations, the panel
said.
In addressing these mental
health and wellness concerns, the
panelists highlighted prevention ef
forts and the University's "safety
net." The panelists also noted that
while faculty members sometimes
put stress on students, they can also
serve as positive anchors.
"We would like to make sure
that the faculty here as well as your
colleagues know how and when to
access support from our safety net,"
Friedman said, pointing out resi
dence deans, Graduate Life Office
deans and CAPS.
"A simple answer is: when you
are feeling beyond your comfort
level in response to a student's con
cerns or demands, that's when to
call," he continued.
"We have strengthened our re
sources and threat assessments ...
that can help determine whether a
student is possibly going to engage
in dangerous behavior," he added.
The panelists encouraged facul
ty to be mindful of student stress, to
be good listeners and to model a
healthy work-life balance.
