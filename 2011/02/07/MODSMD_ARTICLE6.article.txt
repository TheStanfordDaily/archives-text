# SUN DEVILS SCORCHED
## Juniors lead Cardinal to home victory over ASU 
### JACOB JAFFE DESK EDITOR 
In one of its best offensive per
formances of the year, the Stanford
men's basketball team beat Ari
zona State, 83-75, on Saturday af
ternoon to salvage a split of its
four-game homestand. The Cardi
nal (12-10,5-6 Pac-10) won despite
giving up 51-percent shooting to
the last-place Sun Devils (9-14,1-
10).

This uncharacteristically poor
defense was offset by uncharacter
istic success from two areas where
Stanford usually struggles the
three-point line and the free-throw
line. The Cardinal ranks 204 th na
tionally (out of 346 teams) in three
point shooting and 272 nd national
ly in free-throw shooting, with
marks of 33.5 percent and 65.3 per-

cent, respectively. On Saturday,
Stanford made 10 of its 18 three
point attempts and was 25-for-34
from the free-throw line. Both to
tals nearly doubled the Cardinal's
season averages.

victory over Arizona State.
revolving around its stellar fresh
man class, the Cardinal was led on
Saturday by its trio of junior starters
guards Jeremy Green and Jarrett
Mann and forward Josh Owens. The
three combined for 53 of Stanford's
83 points, 15 of its 26 rebounds and
12 of its 18 assists while going 24-
for-33 from the free-throw line.
Green led the way with a season
high 23 points on highly efficient 6-
for-8 shooting from the floor, in
cluding 5-for-5 on three-pointers.
Mann set a career high with 14
points, highlighted by his 8-for-12
performance from the free-throw
line. In addition, Mann dished out
seven assists and grabbed four
steals both game highs while
giving up only one turnover.
"That's the best game Jarrett and
Jeremy ever had in a Cardinal uni
form," said head coach Johnny
Dawkins. "It was more than scoring,
it was about how they stepped up
and made plays that were needed to
close out the game."
Owens picked up two quick fouls
to start the game and sat for most of
the first half without scoring. He re
sponded with a vengeance in the
second half, scoring 16 points and
making 10 of his 12 free throws, and
he finished with a game-high eight
rebounds.

The result was very much in
doubt through the first 20 minutes

as the two teams traded punches.
Neither team built a lead of more
than five points, and the lead
changed hands 13 times. With
Owens sitting in foul trouble, the
Sun Devils dominated inside,
outscoring Stanford, 16-8, in the
paint. However, thanks to strong
performances by Green and Mann,
as well as boosts off the bench from
freshmen John Gage and Aaron
Bright, the Cardinal led, 36-32, at
the break. Those four players com
bined for 34 of Stanford's 36 points
in the half.
In the second frame, Stanford
scored nine of the first 12 points to
open up a 10-point lead at 45-35,
and the Cardinal never looked
back. During the remaining 16:42,
Arizona State never got within
three points of Stanford, but the
Cardinal could not open up its lead
to more than 10. Instead, the margin
floated around seven for the entire
half, as neither team went on a sig
nificant run. This contrasts starkly
Stanford's game Thursday night
against Arizona, which had five
consecutive runs of at least six
points.
As the Sun Devils tried to claw
their way back into the game late,
Stanford found itself at the free
throw line yet again. This time,
though, the Cardinal converted,
sinking 11 of its last 15 free throws

to secure the win. Green did the
final damage, hitting six free throws
in the final 1:21 to ice the game.
"We got the wrong guy to the
line in Jeremy Green," said Arizona
State coach Herb Sendek. "A cou
ple times we didn't use the best dis
cretion; not that we were in a posi
tion to be choosy a few of the times.
When Jeremy Green's at the line,
Stanford is going to make a lot of
free throws."
For the game, senior point guard
Jamelle McMillan led Arizona
State, scoring a career-high 17
points on 6-for-10 shooting and
matching Mann with four steals.
Sophomore guard Trent Lockett hit
his average with 14 points and led
the Sun Devils with five assists. Se
nior guard Ty Abbott, who is second
on the team in scoring at over 13
points per game, was a nonfactor,
taking only three shots and scoring
just three points before sitting out
the second half with an injured
back.
Up next for the Cardinal is a
road trip to the Washington schools.

istic success from two areas where
Stanford usually struggles the
three-point line and the free-throw
line. The Cardinal ranks 204 th na
tionally (out of 346 teams) in three
point shooting and 272 nd national
ly in free-throw shooting, with
marks of 33.5 percent and 65.3 per-

cent, respectively. On Saturday,
Stanford made 10 of its 18 three
point attempts and was 25-for-34
from the free-throw line. Both to
tals nearly doubled the Cardinal's
season averages.

Junior guard Jeremy Green, above, combined with fellow juniors Jarrett
Mann and Josh Owens for 53 of the Cardinal's 83 points in Saturday's
victory over Arizona State.
revolving around its stellar fresh
man class, the Cardinal was led on
Saturday by its trio of junior starters
guards Jeremy Green and Jarrett
Mann and forward Josh Owens. The
three combined for 53 of Stanford's
83 points, 15 of its 26 rebounds and
12 of its 18 assists while going 24-
for-33 from the free-throw line.
Green led the way with a season
high 23 points on highly efficient 6-
for-8 shooting from the floor, in
cluding 5-for-5 on three-pointers.
Mann set a career high with 14
points, highlighted by his 8-for-12
performance from the free-throw
line. In addition, Mann dished out
seven assists and grabbed four
steals both game highs while
giving up only one turnover.
"That's the best game Jarrett and
Jeremy ever had in a Cardinal uni
form," said head coach Johnny
Dawkins. "It was more than scoring,
it was about how they stepped up
and made plays that were needed to
close out the game."
Owens picked up two quick fouls
to start the game and sat for most of
the first half without scoring. He re
sponded with a vengeance in the
second half, scoring 16 points and
making 10 of his 12 free throws, and
he finished with a game-high eight
rebounds.

The result was very much in
doubt through the first 20 minutes

as the two teams traded punches.
Neither team built a lead of more
than five points, and the lead
changed hands 13 times. With
Owens sitting in foul trouble, the
Sun Devils dominated inside,
outscoring Stanford, 16-8, in the
paint. However, thanks to strong
performances by Green and Mann,
as well as boosts off the bench from
freshmen John Gage and Aaron
Bright, the Cardinal led, 36-32, at
the break. Those four players com
bined for 34 of Stanford's 36 points
in the half.
In the second frame, Stanford
scored nine of the first 12 points to
open up a 10-point lead at 45-35,
and the Cardinal never looked
back. During the remaining 16:42,
Arizona State never got within
three points of Stanford, but the
Cardinal could not open up its lead
to more than 10. Instead, the margin
floated around seven for the entire
half, as neither team went on a sig
nificant run. This contrasts starkly
Stanford's game Thursday night
against Arizona, which had five
consecutive runs of at least six
points.
As the Sun Devils tried to claw
their way back into the game late,
Stanford found itself at the free
throw line yet again. This time,
though, the Cardinal converted,
sinking 11 of its last 15 free throws

to secure the win. Green did the
final damage, hitting six free throws
in the final 1:21 to ice the game.
"We got the wrong guy to the
line in Jeremy Green," said Arizona
State coach Herb Sendek. "A cou
ple times we didn't use the best dis
cretion; not that we were in a posi
tion to be choosy a few of the times.
When Jeremy Green's at the line,
Stanford is going to make a lot of
free throws."
For the game, senior point guard
Jamelle McMillan led Arizona
State, scoring a career-high 17
points on 6-for-10 shooting and
matching Mann with four steals.
Sophomore guard Trent Lockett hit
his average with 14 points and led
the Sun Devils with five assists. Se
nior guard Ty Abbott, who is second
on the team in scoring at over 13
points per game, was a nonfactor,
taking only three shots and scoring
just three points before sitting out
the second half with an injured
back.
Up next for the Cardinal is a
road trip to the Washington schools.
Stanford plays in Pullman against
Washington State on Thursday
night before traveling across the
state to take on Washington on Sat
urday.

In one of its best offensive per
formances of the year, the Stanford
men's basketball team beat Ari
zona State, 83-75, on Saturday af
ternoon to salvage a split of its
four-game homestand. The Cardi
nal (12-10,5-6 Pac-10) won despite
giving up 51-percent shooting to
the last-place Sun Devils (9-14,1-
10).

This uncharacteristically poor
defense was offset by uncharacter
istic success from two areas where
Stanford usually struggles the
three-point line and the free-throw
line. The Cardinal ranks 204 th na
tionally (out of 346 teams) in three
