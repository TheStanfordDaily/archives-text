# SUN DEVILS SCORCHED
## Juniors lead Cardinal to home victory over ASU 
### JACOB JAFFE DESK EDITOR 
In one of its best offensive per
formances of the year, the Stanford
men's basketball team beat Ari
zona State, 83-75, on Saturday af
ternoon to salvage a split of its
four-game homestand. The Cardi
nal (12-10,5-6 Pac-10) won despite
giving up 51-percent shooting to
the last-place Sun Devils (9-14,1-
10).

This uncharacteristically poor
defense was offset by uncharacter
istic success from two areas where
Stanford usually struggles the
three-point line and the free-throw
line. The Cardinal ranks 204 th na
tionally (out of 346 teams) in three
point shooting and 272 nd national
ly in free-throw shooting, with
marks of 33.5 percent and 65.3 per-

cent, respectively. On Saturday,
Stanford made 10 of its 18 three
point attempts and was 25-for-34
from the free-throw line. Both to
tals nearly doubled the Cardinal's
season averages.
