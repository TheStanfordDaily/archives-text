## Burst pipe threatens Bob House First floor nearly floods on Friday night 
### KABIR SAWHNEY DESK EDITOR 
On Friday night, a broken water
pipe in Bob nearly flooded the first
floor of the house and caused a tem
porary water shutoff to three Row
houses. Bob residents managed to
keep the water contained to the
area of the initial leak in the dry
wall.

Samir Siddhanti 'l2, one of the
Bob residents who initially noticed
the leak, said it started around 10
p.m., when several residents noticed
a "mist" emanating from a "dime
sized" hole below a first-floor sink.
Siddhanti called Bob RA Sam
Svoboda 'll, who is a former editor
for The Daily, and Student Hous
ing's emergency maintenance
around 10:30 p.m. By that point,
water had streamed out of the hole
and threatened to damage furniture
and flood three adjoining student
rooms on the first floor.
"A few of our residents actually
tried to block the hole," Svoboda
said. "They put some caulk in it and
some tape and tried to stem the
flooding."

Svoboda and Siddhanti both
said that Housing was slow to re
spond to their emergency request,
since the necessary technician had
to come from his home.
"For half an hour, we were just
doing damage control," Svoboda
said. "We set up some trash cans to
try and catch all the water that was
spraying out, and we kept remov
ing those as they got full. A few of
us were just consistently mopping
for an hour or two hours, just to
make sure that the water didn't
build up and flood."
Svoboda added that, since the
burst pipe carried hot water, a
steam buildup triggered the fire
alarm. Both the fire and police de
partments were called to the house.
After the maintenance techni
cian arrived at Bob around 11:30
p.m., he was able to seal the leak in
the pipe. Repairs necessitated a
brief shutoff of water to Bob, as
well as to Casa Italiana and
Xanadu, as all three houses share a
water piping system.
Svoboda said that the fix put in
place by Housing was only tempo
rary, and that the pipes would ne
cessitate more complete repairs at
a later date.
