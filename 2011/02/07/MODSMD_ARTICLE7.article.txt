## Burst pipe threatens Bob House First floor nearly floods on Friday night 
### KABIR SAWHNEY DESK EDITOR 
On Friday night, a broken water
pipe in Bob nearly flooded the first
floor of the house and caused a tem
porary water shutoff to three Row
houses. Bob residents managed to
keep the water contained to the
area of the initial leak in the dry
wall.

Samir Siddhanti 'l2, one of the
Bob residents who initially noticed
the leak, said it started around 10
p.m., when several residents noticed
a "mist" emanating from a "dime
sized" hole below a first-floor sink.
Siddhanti called Bob RA Sam
Svoboda 'll, who is a former editor
for The Daily, and Student Hous
ing's emergency maintenance
around 10:30 p.m. By that point,
water had streamed out of the hole
and threatened to damage furniture
