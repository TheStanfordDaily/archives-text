## Student group focused on Lotus One dorm concept 
### NARDOS GIRMA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In a two-hour event last Friday, Students
for a Sustainable Stanford (SSS) celebrated its
10th anniversary, reflecting on its past and de
tailing its goals for the future. The event fea
tured speeches from current leaders Sid
dhartha Oza 'll and Molly Oshun 'll, as well
as former president John Mulrow 'O9 and Julie
Kennedy, a senior lecturer in the School of
Earth Sciences.
"We want to be able to have SSS be around
for the next 10 years, for the next 50 to 100
years," Oza said in an interview with The
Daily. "So taking a minute at the 10-year
benchmark to look back and look forward
gives us an opportunity to understand what
change in continuity, in the context of sustain
ability, is really about."
SSS recently became one of three student
led, Haas-affiliated service organizations and
focuses on four areas in sustainability: climate,
water, recycling and environmental justice.
Past SSS projects include campaigns for a
"sustainable civilization" course requirement,
policies to improve campus waste manage
ment and a "production farm."
One of Sustainable Stanford's largest on
going projects is Lotus One, a proposed
"green dorm" that has been in the works since
2002. Lotus One would not only provide sus
tainable housing, but would also function as a
forum for sharing ideas and increasing envi
ronmental awareness.
"What's really the most important thing is
that it's an incubator for student ideas," said
Alex Luisi 'l2, one of two student representa
tives working on the project. "We test them
out there and we'll be able to scale their ideas
out to the real world so that we have more of
an impact than just on campus."
The planners envision Lotus One being lo
cated behind Casa Italiana. Although funding
issues have slowed its progress, it may be exe
cuted in the next two years.
In addition to continued work on Lotus

One, SSS has a variety of other short-term
goals. These include organizing "vision
eAßTh," a festival to be held in the spring,
and raising student awareness about SSS
projects and the broader topic of sustainabil
ity. Attracting new students to continue SSS's

legacy as the largest and most active environ
mental group on campus is another important
priority.
"I was looking for a group that was in
volved with sustainability efforts in Stanford
and reaching outside of Stanford," said

Sharon Tan 'l4. "What attracted me to SSS
was its energy. People here were really pas
sionate and open."
