An Evening with Deborah Harkness:
Reading from A Discovery of Witches
Deep in the stacks of Oxford's Bodleian Library, young scholar Diana Bishop unwittingly
calls up a bewitched alchemical manuscript in the course of her research. Descended
from an old and distinguished line of witches, Diana herself wants nothing to do with
sorcery; so after a furtive glance and a few notes, she banishes the book to the stacks.
But her discovery sets a fantastical underworld stirring, and a horde of demons, witches,
and vampires soon descends upon the library. Diana has stumbled upon a coveted
treasure lost for centuries and she is the only creature who can break its spell.
USC historian Deborah Harkness' first novel, A Discovery of Witches, follows Diana's
efforts to unlock the secrets of the manuscript and her unlikely alliance with geneticist
Matthew Clairmont, an ages-old vampire who has his own reasons to be interested in her
discovery. A prizewinning historian of alchemy, magic, and the occult in Elizabethan
England, Harkness has combined elements of history, fiction, and fantasy to create the first
novel in a new and exciting series.
