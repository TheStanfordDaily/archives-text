# OPINIONS
## No FREE LUNCH Choices 
### Tim Moon 
If you ever go out for a meal with
me, a bit of fair warning: you
might want to bring something to
do for the first 10 minutes of the
meal. Like a crossword puzzle. Or
homework. From the minute that I
get a menu to when the waiter comes
by to take the order, I can be a pret
ty terrible dining companion, poring
over the menu like I'm studying for a
midterm. Sure, I'll nod here and
there, chuckle at the right times, slip
in some "mm-hmm"s and "do tell me
more"s, but I'll really be racking my
brain over whether I should get the
pork or the fish. See, I want to try
everything, but, like all humans not
named Takeru Kobayashi, I can only
eat so much, so choosing just one op
tion becomes about as big a crisis as
they come for me. Of course, just as
all my study time never seems to stop
me from failing on my midterms, my
intense menu perusing never helps
me settle on a dish by the time the
waiter comes over.
So, when the waiter asks me what
I want, I end up having to blurt out
the first thing that comes to mind.
The first time this happened, I was
mildly terrified of what I'd done, but
I've become used to, and now even
embrace, these "game-time deci
sions." Sixty percent of the time, it
works very well, but really, it works
every time. Sometimes, I just knock it
out of the park (like the time that I
picked out the world's best corn dog
at the Santa Cruz Boardwalk), but
I've found that I usually end up
happy regardless of what gets placed
in front of me.
I tend to make other decisions at
the very last minute, too. And as with
my meals, despite all the worrying I
do beforehand, it always seems to
work out in the end. Friday after
noon, I had to make one of the
biggest decisions of my life so far, de
ciding whether I would be taking a
job in Houston or a job here. For the
past two weeks, I'd been asking my
parents for advice, talking to my
friends, doing research on living in
Houston and in San Francisco, think
ing about how each position would
be best for my career, considering
where I'd be happiest and pretty
much just getting myself into the
worst tizzy. I was trying to be as ra
tional and thorough as possible, but
the more rational and thorough I
got, the more confused I became. On

Thursday, I was up all night working
on an assignment due Friday. The
next morning, by the time I finished
up, I only had a couple of hours left
before I had to call the company in
Houston and let them know my de
cision. I thought about just staying
up and going over my options one
last time, but I decided to quite liter
ally "sleep on it" instead, figuring I
didn't want to be incoherent when I
made the call. When my alarm woke
me up a couple of hours later, the de
cision just popped into my head: I
would be keeping my talents in the
Bay Area.
It might seem a little strange that
I spend so much time weighing the
different options before seemingly
ignoring everything I'd considered
to make a decision based on a gut re
action, but these gut reactions actu
ally tend to work out because of all
that thinking. If I'm making choices,
I've probably filtered out the really
bad options already, so any choice is
going to be better than okay. After
that, it's just a matter of being happy
with the choice and not peeking over
at the grass on the other side. Be
sides, uncertainty can be fun, even
more so when you're certain to
make a good choice. That's still un
certainty, I think.
Some might call the say-some
thing-at-the-last-minute-because-I-
don't-want-to-think-more method
lazy. I call it being risky, being bad,
being James Dean (who, in case
you're under the same mistaken im
pression that I used to be under, is
not the same person as delicious
sausage-maker Jimmy Dean). Yes,
let's think of it that way: the next
time we go out to eat, the 10 minutes
of menu reading is just me getting
ready to be full of badness. Maybe
you don't need to bring anything
after all it'll be quite a show.
