# I HAVE TWO HEADS
## The 						Terrible Twenty-Somethings 
### Rachel Kolb 
For many of us, turning 21 might
mark our last-ever birthday
when we feel like we've hit an
exciting milestone. Ten was double
digits; 16 was sweet; 18 made us legal.
From here on out, other than saying
that our frontal lobes are finally fully
developed (so there!) when we turn
25, we're just getting older.
Yet, 21 isn't the beginning of the
rest of our lives, not in the sense of
sinking into full-fledged adulthood.
Technically, almost all of us at Stan
ford are adults, yet it strikes me how
much of a transition stage we're still
undergoing. High school may be the
time of so-called teenage angst, but
college introduces a fresh dilemma:
during our four years as undergrad
uates, we find ourselves highly con
scious of the fact that we are no
longer kids, but we do not always
feel like adults, either. We adopt
more serious responsibility, make
more decisions that affect others in
addition to ourselves and discover
more about what we want to be
come and then we dress up like
zoo animals and yowl across the
floor at that night's campus party.
Since coming to Stanford, I've

seen more costumes than I have
since elementary school, as well as
more neon-colored beads and slip
n-slides. On-campus housing
themes continually play on words
involving Nickelodeon and Disney.
My friends sometimes engage in a
surprising amount of reminiscing
about favorite childhood movies,
books and TV shows. Just watch me,
the Stanford student seems to be
saying. Even in the midst of
midterms and problem sets and
pressure to think about my future, I
can still embrace my youthful side!
If "coolness" still exists here like it
existed in high school, then being
cool seems to be largely based on
proving how committed one can be
to a slew of responsibilities, while si
multaneously proving how un-seri
ously one takes oneself. Even as we
strive to make a difference in the
world, I wonder if we all secretly
long to be five years old again.
Naptime, finger-painting and
other kindergarten perks aside,
there is no denying that the average
Stanford student is exceptionally
aware of the larger world issues
upon which one can build a career, a
political stance or any amount of
grown-up things. We all know that
goofball from down the hall who can
still pack a punch when he speaks up
in class. So what, then, does our de
termination to mix work with a
healthy dose of play say about us?
Are we each facing a sort of existen
tial crisis as we grow up, unwilling to
commit ourselves to one age-based
stereotype over another?
In truth, college seems to be a
time when we straddle the fence
between two phases of develop
ment. Adulthood still feels too new
for us to embrace fully, and for
many of us, our status as students is
the same as it has always been, nine
months out of every year, ever since
we were too young to remember.
Simply by pursuing our studies, we
claim our place in a strange sort of
limbo: legally independent, but still
not unleashed into the real world.
You know, that place out there with
responsibilities. Like cooking for
yourself and paying the bills and
and we'll find out when we get
to it.

For me, this transition period be
tween youth and adulthood has
been a welcome opportunity to
change and discover my identity,
and it seems to be engrained into the
Stanford undergraduate experi
ence, from freshman dorms to de
claring our majors. Still, I can't help
but wonder whether it is merely an
indulgence. This past summer, the
New York Times Magazine pub
lished an article called "What is It
About Twenty-Somethings?" that
has lingered in my mind ever since.
In sum, this piece investigated the
argument that the current genera
tion of individuals in their twenties
or our generation, the millennials
isn't growing up as quickly as
generations past. Even with liberal
arts educations, they are slower to
sever ties from adolescent habits
and slower to get settled into re
sponsibility, a career and a family.
Whether this "twenty-something"
stage is a modern phenomenon or
not, it begs the question: at what
point does our youthful indecision
become counterproductive to ac
complishing real-life goals? At what
point is society better served if we
stop taking our upbringings for
granted, bite the bullet and accept
our status as adults? Yet we cannot
discount the flip side of this ques
tion: whether individuals from our
generation might better approach
self-satisfaction simply by taking the
time to understand the world
around them better.
Whatever the answer to these
questions, vitality, wanderlust and
self-discovery frequently seem to
define this ambivalent stage in our
lives. And, in the end, maybe I'm
overemphasizing the differences
between youth and adulthood. My
own father turned 50 this year, but
whenever I think of him, I always vi
sualize his boundless energy and
sometimes 12-year-old sense of
humor. Maybe, once we find our
balance in life, we really are only as
old as we feel.

For many of us, turning 21 might
mark our last-ever birthday
when we feel like we've hit an
exciting milestone. Ten was double
digits; 16 was sweet; 18 made us legal.
From here on out, other than saying
that our frontal lobes are finally fully
developed (so there!) when we turn
25, we're just getting older.
Yet, 21 isn't the beginning of the
rest of our lives, not in the sense of
sinking into full-fledged adulthood.
Technically, almost all of us at Stan
ford are adults, yet it strikes me how
much of a transition stage we're still
undergoing. High school may be the
time of so-called teenage angst, but
college introduces a fresh dilemma:
during our four years as undergrad
uates, we find ourselves highly con
scious of the fact that we are no
longer kids, but we do not always
feel like adults, either. We adopt
more serious responsibility, make
more decisions that affect others in
addition to ourselves and discover
more about what we want to be
come and then we dress up like
zoo animals and yowl across the
floor at that night's campus party.
Since coming to Stanford, I've

seen more costumes than I have
since elementary school, as well as
more neon-colored beads and slip
n-slides. On-campus housing
themes continually play on words
involving Nickelodeon and Disney.
My friends sometimes engage in a
surprising amount of reminiscing
about favorite childhood movies,
books and TV shows. Just watch me,
the Stanford student seems to be
saying. Even in the midst of
midterms and problem sets and
pressure to think about my future, I
can still embrace my youthful side!
If "coolness" still exists here like it
existed in high school, then being
cool seems to be largely based on
proving how committed one can be
to a slew of responsibilities, while si
multaneously proving how un-seri
ously one takes oneself. Even as we
strive to make a difference in the
world, I wonder if we all secretly
long to be five years old again.
Naptime, finger-painting and
other kindergarten perks aside,
there is no denying that the average
Stanford student is exceptionally
aware of the larger world issues
upon which one can build a career, a
political stance or any amount of
grown-up things. We all know that
goofball from down the hall who can
still pack a punch when he speaks up
in class. So what, then, does our de
termination to mix work with a
healthy dose of play say about us?
Are we each facing a sort of existen
tial crisis as we grow up, unwilling to
commit ourselves to one age-based
stereotype over another?
In truth, college seems to be a
time when we straddle the fence
between two phases of develop
ment. Adulthood still feels too new
for us to embrace fully, and for
many of us, our status as students is
the same as it has always been, nine
months out of every year, ever since
we were too young to remember.
Simply by pursuing our studies, we
claim our place in a strange sort of
limbo: legally independent, but still
not unleashed into the real world.
You know, that place out there with
responsibilities. Like cooking for
yourself and paying the bills and
and we'll find out when we get
to it.

For me, this transition period be
tween youth and adulthood has
been a welcome opportunity to
change and discover my identity,
and it seems to be engrained into the
Stanford undergraduate experi
ence, from freshman dorms to de
claring our majors. Still, I can't help
but wonder whether it is merely an
indulgence. This past summer, the
New York Times Magazine pub
lished an article called "What is It
About Twenty-Somethings?" that
has lingered in my mind ever since.
In sum, this piece investigated the
argument that the current genera
tion of individuals in their twenties
or our generation, the millennials
isn't growing up as quickly as
generations past. Even with liberal
arts educations, they are slower to
sever ties from adolescent habits
and slower to get settled into re
sponsibility, a career and a family.
Whether this "twenty-something"
stage is a modern phenomenon or
not, it begs the question: at what
point does our youthful indecision
become counterproductive to ac
complishing real-life goals? At what
point is society better served if we
stop taking our upbringings for
granted, bite the bullet and accept
our status as adults? Yet we cannot
discount the flip side of this ques
tion: whether individuals from our
generation might better approach
self-satisfaction simply by taking the
time to understand the world
around them better.
Whatever the answer to these
questions, vitality, wanderlust and
self-discovery frequently seem to
define this ambivalent stage in our
lives. And, in the end, maybe I'm
overemphasizing the differences
between youth and adulthood. My
own father turned 50 this year, but
whenever I think of him, I always vi
sualize his boundless energy and
sometimes 12-year-old sense of
humor. Maybe, once we find our
balance in life, we really are only as
old as we feel.
