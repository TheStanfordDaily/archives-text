## SWEEPING THE SPARTANS Card wins every event against SJSU 
### BROOKE DAVIS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
On Saturday, the No. 2 Stanford
women's gymnastics team (9-0)
walked away from its meet against
San Jose State with its highest score
of the season.

San Jose State (6-2) was unable
to capture first place in any event of
the day, although junior Thomasina
Wallace and senior Lily Swann
came close. Wallace tied Stanford
junior Alyssa Brown for second
place on the bars, with both earning

a score of 9.850. Neither score came
close to threatening Stanford junior
Nicole Pechanec's career-best score
of 9.925.

Swann followed behind
Stanford sophomore Ashley Mor
gan for the best all-around score of
the meet. Swann's 38.800 trailed the
39.325 of Morgan, whose win now
marked her best all-around score of
the season.

Stanford took first place in every
event and ended up with a final
score of 196.975, prevailing over the
Spartans' score of 193.825. The

Card could not match its season
highs on vault and balance beam
from the Utah meet, while the un
even bars record still stands from
the Pac-10 Showcase.

Stanford did manage to set one
season-best on Saturday, posting a
score of 49.450 on the floor exercise.
Ashley Morgan took first on the
floor with a score of 9.925, which
tied her career best. She has success
fully scored a 9.925 on the floor in
the past five meets. Her teammate,
freshman Shona Morgan from Mel
bourne, Australia, matched Ash
ley's 9.925 with an equal mark of her
own, grabbing a tie for first place. In
total, six Stanford gymnasts Ash
ley Morgan, Shona Morgan,
Pechanec, freshman Kristina Vacu
lik, senior Shelley Alexander and

sophomore Nicole Dayton
scored season bests on the floor ex
ercise as all six scored above a 9.8.
The meet against San Jose was
Shona Morgan's first of the season, as
she recovers from a knee injury. Nev
ertheless, she not only tied for first on
the floor, but she tied for first on the
beam as well, equaling Brown's mark
0f9.850.The beam was a strong event
for Stanford, as Cardinal gymnasts
had the top six scores.
Stanford will continue its season
at the Chicago Style Invitational, a
meet that will play host to No. 10
UCLA, No. 6 Oregon State and the
Cardinal this Friday at 5:30 p.m.
P.S.T. at Navy Pier in Chicago.
