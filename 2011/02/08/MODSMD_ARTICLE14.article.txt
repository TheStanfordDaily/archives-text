## Dixon earns spot on men's national gymnastics team 
### JENNY PETER STAFF WRITER 
Stanford senior gymnast Josh Dixon earned a
spot on the U.S. national team after placing sixth
in the all-around at the Winter Cup Challenge
this weekend. Dixon is one of five new members
appointed to the team from the Las Vegas meet,
which determined the national team spots. Dixon
will be on the team until August 2011 and will
participate in a competition at the 2011 VISA
Championships this summer in St. Paul, Minn.
Seven other members of the Cardinal team
competed as individuals at the event to boost
their NCAA national ranking and to vie for spots
on the national team. Dixon scored a 168.8 over

the two-day competition, with a strong showing
on his best event, the floor exercise. He placed
second with marks of 15.05 and 15.45. Senior Tim
Gentry placed eighth overall and second on the
still rings at 14.7 and 15.05.
Also competing for Stanford were redshirt
senior Nick Noone, seniors Alex Buscaglia and
Ryan Lieberman, redshirt sophomore John Mar
tin and freshmen Chris Turner and Cale Robin
son.
"It was a great learning experience for all our
gymnasts competing," said head coach Thorn
Glielmi. "Each athlete's experience, focus and
preparation was unique to their needs, but there
was one common goal to hit all
their routines. Josh was 11 for 12,
and Tim was 10 for 12. The other
gymnasts had poor showings on the
first day, and that made it tough to
move into the top group."
Six of the men advanced to the
final round on Saturday after Thurs
day's rocky preliminary round. The
team met some of its expectations
coming into the meet, but also
missed others.
"We had a great opportunity to
land several gymnasts on the na
tional team," Dixon said. "However,
small mistakes and a tough first day
of competition played a major role
in the end result. At this level, con
sistency is the name of the game, and
this early in the competitive season,
if you hit 10 or 11 out of 12 routines,
your chances of earning a spot on
the team are very high."
Besides Dixon and Gentry's top
eight finishes, Turner also fared well
in the all-around at 18th. Turner fin
ished 10th on the pommel horse
with a 13.4 and 13.3. Robinson also
had an impressive third-place finish
on vault with a 15.95 and 15.85.
Buscaglia placed 23rd in the all
around.The highlight came from his
second-place finish in the horizontal
bar, scoring a huge 15.8 the first day
and 14.9 in the final round. Martin
hit a solid pommel horse routine for
a fifth-place finish, while Noone was
the first-place finisher on parallel
bars in his session with a season-best
14.35.
In the final round, the men were
more consistent with their work,
supported each other and show
cased their preparation.
"Really, day two of competition
was a highlight in itself," Dixon said.
"Our Stanford group had an entire
rotation to itself, and we were nail
ing routine after routine ... We re
ally had the luxury of treating it like
a team-format competition simply
because we had the numbers and we
were all familiar with the guy going
before and after us. In such an 'indi
vidual competition,' having a group
of teammates around you is a major
advantage."
Before entering the internation
al circuit, Dixon will continue to
compete with the top-ranked Cardi
nal through the NCAA National
Championships in April. Stanford
will next compete in the Gold Coun
try Classic meet on Saturday at 7
p.m. in Oakland.
