# Fields, not Griffin, puts 'R' in ROY
## 
### Wyndam Makowsky Between the lines 
Blake Griffin will be the
NBA's 2010-2011 Rookie
of the Year. This is indis
putable. It'll almost cer
tainly be unanimous. He's
an All-Star in his first season. He aver
ages nearly 23 points and 13 rebounds
per game. He's liable to throw down at
least one "Oh my gosh!" dunk per
contest. For a league predicated on in
human athleticism, Griffin takes it to a
new level.
But he shouldn't be the Rookie of
the Year. Not because there's any first
year player better than him there's
no one close but because he's not a
true rookie. Griffin was the first over
all pick in the 2oo9 draft, but he missed
the entirety of the 2009-2010 season
with a broken left kneecap. NBA rules
stipulate that because he never took
to the court during that year, his status
as a "rookie" remains intact.
And yet, it shouldn't. He signed his
contract in July 2009, played in the
Summer League and was, in fact,
named MVP. The Summer League
teams are made up of rookies as well
as young veterans and players who
have prior NBA experience. He
played the entire preseason and prac
ticed extensively with the Clippers be
fore his injury. This begets a simple
fact: Griffin has had the invaluable ex
perience of being around an NBA
team and learning about the game at
the professional level. Just being in the
locker room is advantageous. When
he was rehabbing, he was able to do it
with the world's best trainers.
Simply put, when he played in his
first NBA game this fall, he was on a
different level from other NBA rook
ies who, while Griffin was making mil
lions and working with professionals
of the highest echelon last season,
were almost all amateurs.
It's a first-time issue for the NBA.
In its history, the NBA has given the
award to someone from a prior draft
class three times, but none had Grif
fin's experience. Jerry Lucas was
drafted in 1962, but didn't sign until
1963. Larry Bird was chosen in 1978,
but went back to college for another
season before inking a deal with the
Boston Celtics. David Robinson was
drafted in 1987, but because he gradu
ated from Annapolis, he had to first
serve in the Navy and didn't enter the
league until 1989. Never has a player
signed a contract with an NBA team,
missed a season, then gone on to win
Rookie of the Year in his following
campaign.
The NFL doesn't allow this to hap
pen. Of the "big four" American
sports, it is the closest comparison to
the NBA (at least in this case), be
cause both the MLB and NHL have
finely developed minor league sys
tems that impact eligibility, since play
ers are recalled and sent back down
with remarkable frequency. The NFL
has nothing of the sort, and the NBA's
Development League is still in its in
fancy and has yet to work out all of its
kinks it has a long way to go to
reach that level.
In the NFL, although the exact rule
is nearly impossible to find, once you
are on a team, your rookie year be
gins. Take the example of Willis Mc-
Gahee. When he was drafted in 2003,
McGahee was rehabbing tears of his
ACL, PCL and MCL in his left knee.
He never made it onto the field in
2003 and debuted in 2004. In that, his
first year, he rushed for 1,128 yards
and 13 touchdowns. He would have
been a strong contender for Offensive
Rookie of the Year (the award went to
Ben Roethlisberger),but he wasn't al
lowed to be in the conversation.
Which, ultimately, is correct. Mc-
Gahee, even when he was injured,
was, like Griffin, around a profession
al team, rehabbing with the best and
absorbing knowledge that you'd only
find in an NFL environment. Like
Griffin, he had a step up when he final
ly got a chance to play.
But why do we care? Because if
Griffin wasn't eligible, the Rookie of
the Year, if he keeps up his current
production, would most probably be
none other than Stanford's Landry
Fields, a second-round pick of the
New York Knicks and the biggest sur
prise of the 2010 draft class. Though
he'd have competition from DeMar
cus Cousins and John Wall, Fields
would likely be the current frontrun
ner, and he presents a strong case. A

starter since his first game, Fields
leads all NBA guards in rebounding
while averaging 10.2 points per game.
He's first among rookies in three
point shooting percentage, second in
steals per game, third in double-dou
bles and fourth in general shooting
percentage, even besting Griffin, a
forward, in the latter category. His
plus/minus (a stat measuring team
performance when a player is on the
court) is 110 on the season best on
the Knicks.

It's easy to see why: Fields has a
knack for the ball and basketball in
stincts that are practically unteach
able. He's the ideal "glue" player who
can also explode when you need him
too he dropped 25 points on the
Sixers over the weekend. Spike Lee,
the world's most visible Knicks fan,
has been wearing a Fields jersey to
practically every home game. He ex
plains: "There's Muddy Waters; now
we've got Muddy Fields because he
doesn't mind getting dirty, doing the
little things." That style of play has
made him a fan favorite and has
drawn a comparison from his own
general manager to Hall of Famer
John Havlicek. For his efforts, he was
named Eastern Conference Rookie
of the Month for November and De
cember, and was a finalist for the
honor in January.
Fields will not become the first
second-rounder in the modern era to
win the Rookie of the Year award.
But if the NBA had the correct eligi
bility requirements in place, he'd be
leading the pack heading into the All-
Star break.

Wyndam Makowsky doesn't feel any
connection to a player from his fa
vorite college and pro team. Ask him
how many other candidates he's
Facebook friends with at makowsky
@stanford.edu.

forward, in the latter category. His
plus/minus (a stat measuring team
performance when a player is on the
court) is 110 on the season best on
the Knicks.

It's easy to see why: Fields has a
knack for the ball and basketball in
stincts that are practically unteach
able. He's the ideal "glue" player who
can also explode when you need him
too he dropped 25 points on the
Sixers over the weekend. Spike Lee,
the world's most visible Knicks fan,
has been wearing a Fields jersey to
practically every home game. He ex
plains: "There's Muddy Waters; now
we've got Muddy Fields because he
doesn't mind getting dirty, doing the
little things." That style of play has
made him a fan favorite and has
drawn a comparison from his own
general manager to Hall of Famer
John Havlicek. For his efforts, he was
named Eastern Conference Rookie
of the Month for November and De
cember, and was a finalist for the
honor in January.
Fields will not become the first
second-rounder in the modern era to
win the Rookie of the Year award.
But if the NBA had the correct eligi
bility requirements in place, he'd be
leading the pack heading into the All-
Star break.

Blake Griffin will be the
NBA's 2010-2011 Rookie
of the Year. This is indis
putable. It'll almost cer
tainly be unanimous. He's
an All-Star in his first season. He aver
ages nearly 23 points and 13 rebounds
per game. He's liable to throw down at
least one "Oh my gosh!" dunk per
contest. For a league predicated on in
human athleticism, Griffin takes it to a
new level.
But he shouldn't be the Rookie of
the Year. Not because there's any first
year player better than him there's
no one close but because he's not a
true rookie. Griffin was the first over
all pick in the 2oo9 draft, but he missed
the entirety of the 2009-2010 season
with a broken left kneecap. NBA rules
stipulate that because he never took
to the court during that year, his status
as a "rookie" remains intact.
And yet, it shouldn't. He signed his
contract in July 2009, played in the
Summer League and was, in fact,
named MVP. The Summer League
teams are made up of rookies as well
as young veterans and players who
have prior NBA experience. He
played the entire preseason and prac
ticed extensively with the Clippers be
fore his injury. This begets a simple
fact: Griffin has had the invaluable ex
perience of being around an NBA
team and learning about the game at
the professional level. Just being in the
locker room is advantageous. When
he was rehabbing, he was able to do it
with the world's best trainers.
Simply put, when he played in his
first NBA game this fall, he was on a
different level from other NBA rook
ies who, while Griffin was making mil
lions and working with professionals
of the highest echelon last season,
were almost all amateurs.
It's a first-time issue for the NBA.
In its history, the NBA has given the
award to someone from a prior draft
class three times, but none had Grif
fin's experience. Jerry Lucas was
drafted in 1962, but didn't sign until
1963. Larry Bird was chosen in 1978,
but went back to college for another
season before inking a deal with the
Boston Celtics. David Robinson was
drafted in 1987, but because he gradu
ated from Annapolis, he had to first
serve in the Navy and didn't enter the
league until 1989. Never has a player
signed a contract with an NBA team,
missed a season, then gone on to win
Rookie of the Year in his following
campaign.
The NFL doesn't allow this to hap
pen. Of the "big four" American
sports, it is the closest comparison to
the NBA (at least in this case), be
cause both the MLB and NHL have
finely developed minor league sys
tems that impact eligibility, since play
ers are recalled and sent back down
with remarkable frequency. The NFL
has nothing of the sort, and the NBA's
Development League is still in its in
fancy and has yet to work out all of its
kinks it has a long way to go to
reach that level.
In the NFL, although the exact rule
is nearly impossible to find, once you
are on a team, your rookie year be
gins. Take the example of Willis Mc-
Gahee. When he was drafted in 2003,
McGahee was rehabbing tears of his
ACL, PCL and MCL in his left knee.
He never made it onto the field in
2003 and debuted in 2004. In that, his
first year, he rushed for 1,128 yards
and 13 touchdowns. He would have
been a strong contender for Offensive
Rookie of the Year (the award went to
Ben Roethlisberger),but he wasn't al
lowed to be in the conversation.
Which, ultimately, is correct. Mc-
Gahee, even when he was injured,
was, like Griffin, around a profession
al team, rehabbing with the best and
absorbing knowledge that you'd only
find in an NFL environment. Like
Griffin, he had a step up when he final
ly got a chance to play.
But why do we care? Because if
Griffin wasn't eligible, the Rookie of
the Year, if he keeps up his current
production, would most probably be
none other than Stanford's Landry
Fields, a second-round pick of the
New York Knicks and the biggest sur
prise of the 2010 draft class. Though
he'd have competition from DeMar
cus Cousins and John Wall, Fields
would likely be the current frontrun
ner, and he presents a strong case. A

starter since his first game, Fields
leads all NBA guards in rebounding
while averaging 10.2 points per game.
He's first among rookies in three
point shooting percentage, second in
steals per game, third in double-dou
bles and fourth in general shooting
percentage, even besting Griffin, a
forward, in the latter category. His
plus/minus (a stat measuring team
performance when a player is on the
court) is 110 on the season best on
the Knicks.
