# Examining Egypt
## Professors provide historical and economic context for popular uprising 
### JOSHUA FALK DESK EDITOR 
The Abbasi Program in Islamic
Studies hosted a discussion on the
Egyptian popular uprising yesterday,
drawing commentary from history
professor Joel Beinin and political
science assistant professor Lisa Blay
des. History professor Robert Crews
moderated the event, which took
place in the Bechtel Conference
Center.
"If any of you have paid any at
tention to the recent events in Egypt
at all, you'll probably notice that the
analysis of the causes has focused on
two things: Tunisia and the role of so
cial media," Beinin said.
But Beinin downplayed the im

portance of these two factors and cri
tiqued prevailing media coverage,
which tended to overemphasize
Tunisia and social networks.

"I want to suggest that the more
fundamental factors in explaining
these events are structural and his
torical," Beinin added, stressing the
significance of vast unemployment
and World Bank/IMF neo-liberaliza
tion efforts in Egypt.
The Egyptian regime's attitude
toward political demonstrations
since 2000 has been unclear, Beinin
said, citing the 2005 protests as an ex
ample.

"There have been, since 2000, a
series of political movements that the
regime has sometimes tolerated and
sometimes repressed," Beinin said.

"You had, for the first time in 50
years, demonstrations that weren't
simply crushed by the security
forces."

He also said Omar Suleiman, the
recently appointed Egyptian vice
president whom the United States
backs, does not represent fundamen
tal change from Mubarak's 30-year
reign.
"There is a problem in American
political discourse," he added. "Hosni
Mubarak, for decades, has been con
sidered a moderate."
"Why does mainstream Ameri
can political discourse resist from
calling a spade a spade?" Beinin said.
In a discussion of the likely demo
graphic breakdown of the Egyptian
protests, Blaydes cited poll data ex

amining Egyptian attitudes toward
peaceful protest.
"Of the men who were polled in
this sample, you had about a one in
two chance of saying you'd partici
pate in this kind of demonstration,"
Blaydes said.
Roughly half of the Egyptian
population lives on fewer than $2 a
day, she said. Corruption is a major
grievance among Egyptians. A gov
ernment survey showed that the
Egyptian public thought that busi
nessmen, who often have close ties to
Mubarak, were the most corrupt
group in society.
She pointed out that Egypt is
quite conservative relative to the rest
of the Muslim world.
"We don't know how religious
preferences might translate into
votes," she added.
Blaydes also stressed the impor
tance of implementing a system of
voting and governance that maxi
mizes electoral voices and protects
the rights of women and religious mi
norities.
Beinin cautioned that implemen
tation and survival of democracy are
the result of struggle,
"Even in the best of circum
stances and I'm not so convinced
that Egypt is facing the best of cir
cumstances we're not going to see
a switch turned off or on and we'll see
democracy," he said.

"I think that we need to honor the
preferences of average Egyptians in
whatever sort of government we
have moving forward in Egypt,"
Blaydes said.
She stressed the need to redistrib
ute income away from the very
wealthy to the masses, "who are suf
fering under some pretty oppressive
economic conditions."
Beinin added that the Egyptian
educational system needs a massive
overhaul in order to equip students
for citizenship, modern business and
technology.
"If you were to interrogate the
median Egyptian about a whole
range of issues, you would be horri
fied," Beinin said.
In response to a question from an
audience member, Beinin noted that
American endorsement of a particu
lar candidate would only serve to de
legitimize that candidate.
"The best thing for the United
States to do is absolutely nothing,"
Beinin said.
Beinin has written extensively
about workers, peasants and social
movements in the modern Middle
East. Blaydes' research includes
work on Middle Eastern politics and
political economy. She has written
about political institutions in Egypt.

One key cause of Egyptians' discontent cited by scholars is the widespread corruption that exists in Egypt.
Blaydes stressed the need to redistribute income away from the very wealthy to the masses.
