## PA City Council prioritizes finance 
### MARGARET RAWSON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
After cutting 60 staff posi
tions in the last two years, the
Palo Alto City Council has
again set the city's finances as a
priority. City leaders spoke to
The Daily about current chal
lenges and projections for the
future.
During their January retreat
at the Baylands Nature Inter
pretive Center, the council de
cided to maintain last year's top
five priorities for 2011
namely, city finances, communi
ty collaboration for youth well
being, emergency prepared
ness, environmental sustain
ability and land use and trans
portation planning.
Tackling budget cuts
Palo Alto budget cuts in
2011 almost reached $lO mil
lion to cover a $7.1 million
deficit.The city's deficit for 2012
is expected to be up $2 million.
City staff is still recovering from
the cuts, but the quality of serv
ices was not affected, council
members said.
"I don't believe they affect
ed any services," councilmem
ber Greg Scharff said of the
budget cuts.
"We believe that in the first
six months or so it's worked
fine," agreed Lalo Perez, direc
tor of administrative services.
"The goal was to minimize
the impacts on the community,"

Perez said, adding that the aim
was not to "reduce the level of
services, but [to] change how we
deliver the services."
One tactic the council used
last year was contracting out
services, such as park mainte
nance, golf course maintenance,
custodial services and adminis
trative support.
"I don't think there are any
negative effects other than that
staff is obviously working at ca
pacity," Scharff said.
Staff workload continues to
be an issue, as forty-six positions
in the city's general fund remain
vacant.
"Some members of staff are
completely overworked . . .
and yet some positions are still
fine," said councilmember
Nancy Shepherd.
Scharff said the recent budg
et cuts reflect efforts "to bal
ance the budget and make
structural change that prevents
budget deficits in the future," a
theme echoed by Palo Alto
Mayor Sid Espinosa.
"We know that [staff cuts]
impact real people with fami
lies," Espinosa said, stressing
that structural change was
needed to make the city finan
cially stable in the long-term.
"This city council will bal
ance our budget," Espinosa said
in his Jan. 24 "State of the City
Address." He emphasized that
"there is no more critical issue
facing our city."
Speaking on Palo Alto's predict
ed budget gap in 2012,Scharff said,"l
think it's manageable for the city, and
the city is on the right fiscal path."
Pensions and infrastructure
In addition to falling tax revenues,
increasing retirement and healthcare
costs contributed to the city's deficit.
This, in turn, led the council to estab
lish a two-tier pension system.
"Part of the difficult choices we
made was restructuring our pension
program," Perez said. "The bigger,
looming picture that we won't be ad
dressing for 2012 is our infrastruc
ture needs."
The city currently has a backlog
of almost $5OO million in infrastruc
ture needs.
Espinosa began early on in his ad
dress by saying, "Palo Alto is no ex
ception" to the negative effects of the
recession. He later acknowledged,
"Like many cities, we also have a
major infrastructure backlog."
"There's far more good news
here than there is bad," Espinosa
said, arguing that "transformative
policy-making often happens best in
times of change."
Dealing with the city's deficit for
2012, which will be the focus of up
coming talks, "will probably involve
some difficult choices and potential
reduction of further services," Perez
said.
One uncertain aspect will be the
proposed Stanford University Med
ical Center Renewal Project. Stan
ford recently put forward an offer of
$173 million in community benefits
to the city. With regard to this issue,
Scharff thought that Stanford and
Palo Alto were "working really well
together."
But the manner in which the hos
pital expansion factors into the city's
finances remains unclear.
"Until the project is approved, it
wouldn't be prudent for us to count
those dollars for 2012 yet," Perez
said.
