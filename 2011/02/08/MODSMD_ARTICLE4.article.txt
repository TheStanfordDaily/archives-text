## Students choose non-BOSP study abroad options 
### ELLORA ISRANI STAFF WRITER 
Stanford students often hear about the pastries in
Paris, the karaoke in Kyoto and the soccer in Santiago
from the 800 or so students who participate in the Bing
Overseas Study Program (BOSP) each year. By com
parison, the experiences of the roughly 100 students
who enroll in non-BOSP programs each year have not
been in the limelight.

The University is, however, be
ginning to centralize information
about all study abroad programs. In
particular, it will create what BOSP
External Programs Coordinator
Naoko Sakata calls a "one-stop
shopping center" in the BOSP of
fice. At this center, students would
find a research library with informa
tion on nearly 300 non-Stanford
study abroad programs and concen
trated credit evaluation procedures.
Sakata herself would act as an e
mail resource for students consider
ing studies abroad.
Nevertheless, BOSP director
Robert Sinclair said individual stu
dents largely determine Stanford's
involvement when they make their
arrangements through external
programs.
"What we offer is the resource
and contact points and advice," Sin
clair said. "Students who decide to
do it are really doing it by them
selves. They do it through the pro
grams which they apply for."
According to Sakata, transfer
credit is not guaranteed for non-
Stanford study abroad programs.
Students must make decisions
about whether to seek transfer
credit and when to do so.
"They have to work with our of
fice in order to have the courses
evaluated with transfer credit,"
Sakata said. "Students have an op
tion to request transfer credit pre
approval before they go, or even be
fore making the decision to apply to
the program. Or, they can wait until
after they complete the program
and petition after they return to the
campus."
Students enrolled in non-BOSP
programs must also take a leave of
absence from the University since
they are not enrolled in Stanford
courses. This break in enrollment
means a break in financial aid dur
ing the time spent abroad.
Sakata said there are two major
reasons students choose non-BOSP
programs: location and timing.
Many students want to study in

places not currently covered by
Stanford's programs especially
the Middle East, where Sakata esti
mates half of non-BOSP students
choose to go. In addition, students
facing scheduling conflicts, required
courses and long athletic seasons
during the school year may choose
to study abroad during the summer
instead.
For Alice Bosley 'll, who spent
16 weeks studying in Morocco
through AMIDEAST, a quarter
abroad simply didn't seem like
enough time.
"I feel like a quarter is a little bit
too short to go abroad," Bosley said.
"In terms of going abroad and
living with a host family for a while,
I thought doing a semester-long
program would fit what I wanted to
get from abroad more than a quar
ter system would," she added.
Bosley chose to study in Moroc
co because of her longstanding in
terest in Africa and the Middle East,
and her desire to utilize the Arabic
she studied at Stanford. But most
people Bosley knows are still in
clined to take advantage of the
BOSP programs, often for logistical
simplicity. This leads to certain
trade-offs.
"A lot of Stanford programs
abroad kind of transfer the Stanford
bubble to a new city," she said. "And
while, obviously, you're living with
your host family and getting the
abroad experience, from people I
talked to while I was abroad, it kind
of seemed like it was Stanford all
over again."
In contrast, Bosley was thrilled
to meet "a whole group of new peo
ple" during her studies in Morocco.
As BOSP considers opening
new centers around the world, it
may consider the interests of non-
BOSP study abroad students and
open centers in places where those
students are concentrated, includ
ing the Middle East.
"Certainly we are looking at new
opportunities for more formalized
overseas study in new locations,"
Sinclair said. "And of course the
Middle East is one of the top priori
ties."
