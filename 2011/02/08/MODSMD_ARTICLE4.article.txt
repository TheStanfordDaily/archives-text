### ELLORA ISRANI STAFF WRITER 
Stanford students often hear about the pastries in
Paris, the karaoke in Kyoto and the soccer in Santiago
from the 800 or so students who participate in the Bing
Overseas Study Program (BOSP) each year. By com

who enroll in non-BOSP programs each year have not
been in the limelight.
