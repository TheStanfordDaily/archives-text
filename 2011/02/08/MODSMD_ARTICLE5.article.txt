## Cardona proposes ROTC referendum "Advisory referendum" could appear on ballot 
### KATE ABBOTT DEPUTY EDITOR 
ASSU President Angelina
Cardona 'll recently authored
a bill to add "advisory referen
da" regarding ROTC to the
April ASSU elections ballot.
She proposed that the Under
graduate Senate (UGS) and
the Graduate Student Council
(GSC) vote on the bill by next
week; it will need majority ap
proval from both bodies in
order to be included on the
Spring 2011 election ballot.
If passed, the bill would add
"Measure A-Advisory Ques
tion" to the ballot to gauge stu
dent opinion concerning the
potential reinstatement of
ROTC. The ad hoc committee
currently investigating the
issue reported to the ASSU
several weeks ago.
"The presentation was ex
tremely informative," Cardona
said. "It was a two-way conver
sation during which the com
mittee answered questions
that senate had, and they re
ceived input from senators and
other leaders."
The committee also hosted
an open-letter campaign, a
campus-wide town hall and a
meeting with faculty and staff
to continue dialogue and ad
dress concerns about the issue.
Cardona hopes this measure

will provide a representation
of the student body's opinion
on the matter.
"The idea of [the bill] came
shortly after the town hall that
the ASSU co-sponsored, and it
was clear that was the begin
ning of a larger conversation."
"A lot of senators and other
leaders are very supportive of
asking this question," Cardona
said. "They think it gets at the
core of what student govern
ment should be doing."
Cardona said that after lis
tening to the debate at the
town hall and seeing the com
mittee's presentation, she real
ized that "there are many dif
ferent opinions on this issue."
"I see it as my role as presi
dent to synthesize all of these,"
she said.
The bill proposes three op
tions from which students can
choose: support return of
ROTC, do not support or ab
stain. Cardona said that the
current bill is the result of sev
eral drafts with "more neutral"
language. She said that psy
chology professor and com
mittee chair Ewart Thomas
was consulted and supports of
the advisory measure.
"The newest version has a
more neutral approach and
hopefully will yield better re
sponses from the pool," she
said.
Cardona said that she
reached out to Stanford Stu-
