## Professors pioneer stem cell trial 
### PHILIP BUI 
For the first time, researchers are
using embryonic stem cells in a clini
cal trial to treat patients with spinal
cord injuries. The trial strives to test
whether these cells can be safely used
to treat humans.
This initial investigation of embry
onic stem cells stands apart from
prior trials, which have all relied on
adult stem cells. If successful, it may
be expanded to larger clinical trials.
Geron Corporation, a Menlo
Park-based company that develops
cellular technology, sponsored the
trial. Overall, the trial may enroll up
to 10 patients with spinal cord injuries
in seven locations across the country.
The Stanford School of Medicine
and Santa Clara Valley Medical Cen
ter, collaborating together, constitute
the third clinical site for the trial. Cells
will be grown at Stanford, while sur
geries will be administered at the Val
ley Medical Center.
At Stanford, Gary Steinberg, pro
fessor of neurosurgery, and Marco
Lee, clinical assistant professor of
neurosurgery, have been authorized
to implement the new treatment.
"We are very excited about this
trial," Lee said. "This trial marks the
first FDA-approved, clinical, phase
one embryonic stem cell trial. If this
initial clinical trial proves to be safe,
the FDA will approve further trials
with a larger patient pool."

"Most of the people involved
would be overjoyed if there is no ad
verse reaction," Steinberg said.
Adding to the excitement is the
fact that Stanford and Santa Clara are
two of a limited number of institu
tions that will have the opportunity to
carry out this research.
"Stanford is the only site west of
the Mississippi," Steinberg said.
"Geron was very selective who got in
vited to participate."
Northwestern University is the
only other site that has been officially
identified by Geron. The company
has yet to disclose information on the
five remaining sites.
The company wanted facilities
that could rigorously carry out the
clinical trial and provide the neces
sary medical support for participating
patients. The medical centers need to
be equipped to take care of patients
with spinal cord injuries.
The clinical trial recruits patients
who recently suffered a trauma or
blunt injury to the thoracic region of
the spinal cord, which stretches from
the top of the shoulder blades to the
bottom of rib cage. The patients qual
ify as paraplegic because they have
lost motor abilities from the waist
down, including bowel control. The
participants have usually been in car
accidents and have experienced a
crushing fracture to the spine.
Individuals with penetrating
wounds, such as bullet or knife

wounds, are not qualified to enroll in
the study. Researchers have been
able to use embryonic stem cells to re
pair blunt spinal injuries in animal
models, but not penetrating spinal in
juries.
To participate in the trial, a patient
must notify his doctors and request to
opt-in within seven to 14 days of his
injury.
"This requires patients to come to
terms with their condition and re
quest for the new procedure," Lee
said. Finding suitable participants for
the trial can be difficult, because
many patients fully cannot come to
terms with their situation within two
weeks of their traumatic accidents.
Since the clinical trial is currently
in its preliminary stages, there are still
no conclusive results. Researchers do
not know if there will be adverse reac
tions, such as tumor formation, from
the injection of stem cells into the
spinal cord. Positive animal model re
sults are not easily transferable to hu
mans.
But scientists remain hopeful.
"There is a lot of excitement about
this, but there is a lot of caution,"
Steinberg said. "Advances in medi
cine are made in small steps, not
quantum leaps.That being said, we've
never had something like this be
fore."
