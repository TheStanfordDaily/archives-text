## Despite rise in S&P, fundraising declines 
### ISAAC GATENO 
Donations to the University de
clined by 6.4 percent for fiscal year
2010. Despite the drop, Stanford re
mained at the top of U.S. college
fundraising, collecting $599 million
for the 12-month period that ended
in June 2010.
This puts Stanford right above
Harvard, which raised $597 million.
During the same period, however,
the S&P 500 increased 12 percent.
"It is certainly the case that
many of our donors have been im
pacted by the recent financial tur
moil, which likely influenced their
short-term decision-making about
philanthropy," wrote Rebecca
Smith Vogel, assistant vice presi
dent of the Office of Development,
in an e-mail to The Daily.
Smith Vogel also pointed to the
timeline for the Stanford Challenge
campaign as a possible cause for the
lull in donations. The Stanford
Challenge is a five-year campaign
to raise $4.3 billion for multidiscipli
nary research, support for K-12 ed
ucation and undergraduate pro
grams and support for the Universi
ty's core teaching and research.
The fact that the program is cur
rently in its final year may account
for the current state of donations,
Smith Vogel said.
"It is not unusual to see overall

giving dip in the middle years of a
multi-year campaign, since many of
the larger gift commitments were
secured in the early years to get the
campaign off to a strong start," she
said.
Smith Vogel also noted that, de
spite the dip in the dollar-value of
donations, the number of individual
donors rose to a record 76,487 in
2010. The new record represents an
8.5 percent increase over fiscal year
2009. Smith Vogel stated that this
increase is a signal "that donors are
very committed to Stanford, its mis
sion, its faculty and its students."
"It bodes well for the future," she
added.
The University's financial health
is bolstered by another factor; The
Stanford Fund received a record
setting contribution of $20,208,377
last year.
With the recession, the endow
ment took a large hit at the same
time that student need rose signifi
cantly. The Stanford Fund, along
with other annual gifts, was one of
the primary sources of funding for
undergraduate student aid during
the economic turndown.
Overall, giving levels rose over
the past 10 years, a trend that is ex
pected to continue.
