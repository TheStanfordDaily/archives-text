## Colors in the Sky Down with Gravity brings the circus to White Plaza 
### MARWA FARAG DESK EDITOR 
Like most Friday after
noons. White Plaza is fairly
empty aside from the oc
casional student bemoan
ing an upcoming problem
set that looms darkly over his week
end and another cheerful stroller
who appears inordinately pleased
that the end of the week has arrived.
But come 3 p.m., a new diversion
has appeared on the lawn outside of
the bookstore: a small group of guys
quietly juggling plastic balls.
Within the half hour, another
two jugglers have arrived, and a
crate of props emerges from some
where in Old Union. The equip
ment varies from balls to clubs, cigar
boxes and hacky sacks.
Soon, the small patch of grass be
tween the Claw and the passing bi
cycles has become a lively juggling
ring. The number of performers
swells, children stop by to learn and
laugh and a few students take a mo
ment in passing to watch clubs fly
ing through the air in impossibly
controlled patterns.
Despite its spontaneous feel, the
gathering marks the weekly meet
ing of Stanford's juggling club,
Down with Gravity.
"I've been juggling for about
nine years," said Michael Pearce 'l3.
"And I've been a member of this
club for eight."

Pearce, who shares the world
record for greatest number of clubs
juggled at one time, has been com
ing up to Stanford from San Jose
every Friday afternoon since mid
dle school to throw things around
with the group.
"The first time I showed up here
I was 12 years old, and they just
completely welcomed me in,"
Pearce said.
At this moment, a young boy
asking for instructions on how to
juggle pieces of colored cloth inter
rupts him mid-train of thought. He
instantly turns to assist the inquir
ing child.
"Practice throwing it from the
hand holding two pieces of cloth
first," Pearce explains, kneeling
down on the grass to demonstrate.
The boy nods solemnly and fur
rows his brow in intense focus. A
few minutes later he's got it, and a
little girl comes up asking him to
teach her too.
Further away, four jugglers are
practicing passing clubs, throwing
out words like "feast" and "havana"
to denote different formations.
After what sounds like some
complicated engineering, one of the
jugglers, Jeremy Keeshin'l2, calls
out:
"Up ... down ..."
And suddenly, juggling clubs are
thrown in every direction, with each

juggler flinging and catching much
faster than the eye can follow.
Passersby stop and pick up
props. Some have never juggled be
fore, while others explain that
they've juggled "a little bit" and
proceed to effortlessly throw and
catch four, five and six balls.
The members of the club are
happy to help both. Max Cougar
Oswald 'l2 shows a curious kid how
to juggle cigar boxes. Keeshin's
group invites a new addition into
their formation.
"It's great to have a community
where I can mess around and pick
up tricks," Pearce said, commenting
on the group's openness.
Down with Gravity was founded
in 2001 by Miguel Chaves 'O5, and
has maintained its inclusive nature,
as well as its Friday afternoon gath
erings on White Plaza, ever since.
"We'd meet right here on Friday
afternoons at 3 p.m. until it was too
dark to juggle," said Jacob Bien
8.5., M.S. 'O6, Ph.D. 'l2 who first
joined the club as a freshman in
2002.
Bien, who met the original mem
bers of Down with Gravity at his
Admit Weekend in 2002, has been
affiliated with the group for almost
10 years.
"There's a core group of guys in
the group," said Charlie Dunn'll,
the current club president, "but the
Friday meeting is open to every
one."
In addition to Friday gatherings,
the "core group" is responsible for
performances. Down with Gravity
performed last Thursday at the
half-time show of the men's basket
ball game and is planning on doing
the same at this Thursday's game.
They are also hoping to do a bigger
show during spring quarter, which
would be a first for the club.
The group also runs workshops
in the surrounding area for chil
dren. Next Friday, they will be
teaching their tricks to children at
the Northstar Academy in Red
wood City.
"Almost everyone is in math, CS
or physics," remarked Keeshin, not
ing a trend in club involvement.
Other than sharing an affinity
for numbers and throwing props
into the air, however, the boys are
remarkably different in execution
each has his own style and pref
erence in juggling props. A few ac
tually abandon juggling altogether
and hop onto a unicycle. On other
Fridays, slack-rope walkers join the
circus.
As the afternoon winds down,

the balls are thrown higher and the
clubs seem to multiply.
Those who have been practicing
for a while are starting to see re
sults, and the boys are getting more
creative with their formations. Red
and blue balls rest on the green
grass, left behind by those who gave
up or moved on to fancier pieces.
Jugglers cycle in and out, trading
in pencils for hacky sacks and
frowns for smiles. They show off

their updated repertoire and join
others in passing clubs.
"[Down with Gravity] is what
ever the people in the club want to
make of it," Dunn said.
The laughs and the flying colors
make it easy to see the appeal of
juggling — a simple, playful type of
fun that is so often forgotten be
tween lectures and readings and
midterms.
"Sometimes its just fun throw
ing things back and forth," Keeshin
said. "And sometimes you can do
more interesting patterns."
"It's a great way to wind down
from all the p-sets," added another
club member, Sam Hochheimer'13.
The outdoor location, the inclu
sivity and the casual atmosphere all
add up to one simple aim, articulat
ed by Dunn.
"The main goal is to have a good
time on Friday afternoon," he said,
throwing three balls into the air ef
fortlessly.

said. "And sometimes you can do
more interesting patterns."
"It's a great way to wind down
from all the p-sets," added another
club member, Sam Hochheimer'13.
The outdoor location, the inclu
sivity and the casual atmosphere all
add up to one simple aim, articulat

"The main goal is to have a good
time on Friday afternoon," he said,
throwing three balls into the air ef

Like most Friday after
noons. White Plaza is fairly
empty aside from the oc
casional student bemoan
ing an upcoming problem
set that looms darkly over his week
end and another cheerful stroller
who appears inordinately pleased
that the end of the week has arrived.
But come 3 p.m., a new diversion
has appeared on the lawn outside of
the bookstore: a small group of guys
quietly juggling plastic balls.
Within the half hour, another
two jugglers have arrived, and a
crate of props emerges from some
where in Old Union. The equip
ment varies from balls to clubs, cigar
boxes and hacky sacks.
Soon, the small patch of grass be
tween the Claw and the passing bi
cycles has become a lively juggling
ring. The number of performers
swells, children stop by to learn and
laugh and a few students take a mo
ment in passing to watch clubs fly
ing through the air in impossibly
controlled patterns.
Despite its spontaneous feel, the
gathering marks the weekly meet
ing of Stanford's juggling club,
Down with Gravity.
"I've been juggling for about
nine years," said Michael Pearce 'l3.
"And I've been a member of this
club for eight."

Pearce, who shares the world
record for greatest number of clubs
juggled at one time, has been com
ing up to Stanford from San Jose
every Friday afternoon since mid
dle school to throw things around
with the group.
"The first time I showed up here
I was 12 years old, and they just
completely welcomed me in,"
Pearce said.
At this moment, a young boy
asking for instructions on how to
juggle pieces of colored cloth inter
rupts him mid-train of thought. He
instantly turns to assist the inquir
ing child.
"Practice throwing it from the
hand holding two pieces of cloth
first," Pearce explains, kneeling
down on the grass to demonstrate.
The boy nods solemnly and fur
rows his brow in intense focus. A
few minutes later he's got it, and a
little girl comes up asking him to
teach her too.
Further away, four jugglers are
practicing passing clubs, throwing
out words like "feast" and "havana"
to denote different formations.
After what sounds like some
complicated engineering, one of the
jugglers, Jeremy Keeshin'l2, calls
out:
"Up ... down ..."
And suddenly, juggling clubs are
thrown in every direction, with each

juggler flinging and catching much
faster than the eye can follow.
Passersby stop and pick up
props. Some have never juggled be
fore, while others explain that
they've juggled "a little bit" and
proceed to effortlessly throw and
catch four, five and six balls.
The members of the club are
happy to help both. Max Cougar
Oswald 'l2 shows a curious kid how
to juggle cigar boxes. Keeshin's
group invites a new addition into
their formation.
"It's great to have a community
where I can mess around and pick
up tricks," Pearce said, commenting
on the group's openness.
Down with Gravity was founded
in 2001 by Miguel Chaves 'O5, and
has maintained its inclusive nature,
as well as its Friday afternoon gath
erings on White Plaza, ever since.
"We'd meet right here on Friday
afternoons at 3 p.m. until it was too
dark to juggle," said Jacob Bien
8.5., M.S. 'O6, Ph.D. 'l2 who first
joined the club as a freshman in
2002.
Bien, who met the original mem
bers of Down with Gravity at his
Admit Weekend in 2002, has been
affiliated with the group for almost
10 years.
"There's a core group of guys in
the group," said Charlie Dunn'll,
the current club president, "but the
Friday meeting is open to every
one."
In addition to Friday gatherings,
the "core group" is responsible for
performances. Down with Gravity
performed last Thursday at the
half-time show of the men's basket
ball game and is planning on doing
the same at this Thursday's game.
They are also hoping to do a bigger
show during spring quarter, which
would be a first for the club.
The group also runs workshops
in the surrounding area for chil
dren. Next Friday, they will be
teaching their tricks to children at
the Northstar Academy in Red
wood City.
"Almost everyone is in math, CS
or physics," remarked Keeshin, not
ing a trend in club involvement.
Other than sharing an affinity
for numbers and throwing props
into the air, however, the boys are
remarkably different in execution
each has his own style and pref
erence in juggling props. A few ac
tually abandon juggling altogether
and hop onto a unicycle. On other
Fridays, slack-rope walkers join the
circus.
As the afternoon winds down,

the balls are thrown higher and the
clubs seem to multiply.
Those who have been practicing
for a while are starting to see re
sults, and the boys are getting more
creative with their formations. Red
and blue balls rest on the green
grass, left behind by those who gave
up or moved on to fancier pieces.
Jugglers cycle in and out, trading
in pencils for hacky sacks and
frowns for smiles. They show off

their updated repertoire and join
others in passing clubs.
"[Down with Gravity] is what
ever the people in the club want to
make of it," Dunn said.
The laughs and the flying colors
make it easy to see the appeal of
juggling — a simple, playful type of
fun that is so often forgotten be
tween lectures and readings and
midterms.
"Sometimes its just fun throw
ing things back and forth," Keeshin
said. "And sometimes you can do
more interesting patterns."
"It's a great way to wind down
from all the p-sets," added another
club member, Sam Hochheimer'13.

sivity and the casual atmosphere all
