## Colors in the Sky Down with Gravity brings the circus to White Plaza 
### MARWA FARAG DESK EDITOR 
Like most Friday after
noons. White Plaza is fairly
empty aside from the oc
casional student bemoan
ing an upcoming problem
set that looms darkly over his week
end and another cheerful stroller
who appears inordinately pleased
that the end of the week has arrived.
But come 3 p.m., a new diversion
has appeared on the lawn outside of
the bookstore: a small group of guys
quietly juggling plastic balls.
Within the half hour, another
two jugglers have arrived, and a
crate of props emerges from some
where in Old Union. The equip
ment varies from balls to clubs, cigar
boxes and hacky sacks.
Soon, the small patch of grass be
tween the Claw and the passing bi
cycles has become a lively juggling
ring. The number of performers
swells, children stop by to learn and
laugh and a few students take a mo

Down with Gravity.
"I've been juggling for about

with the group.
"The first time I showed up here
I was 12 years old, and they just
completely welcomed me in,"
Pearce said.
At this moment, a young boy
asking for instructions on how to
juggle pieces of colored cloth inter
rupts him mid-train of thought. He
instantly turns to assist the inquir
ing child.
"Practice throwing it from the
hand holding two pieces of cloth
first," Pearce explains, kneeling
down on the grass to demonstrate.
The boy nods solemnly and fur
rows his brow in intense focus. A
few minutes later he's got it, and a
little girl comes up asking him to
teach her too.
Further away, four jugglers are
practicing passing clubs, throwing
out words like "feast" and "havana"
to denote different formations.
After what sounds like some
complicated engineering, one of the
jugglers, Jeremy Keeshin'l2, calls
out:
"Up ... down ..."
And suddenly, juggling clubs are
thrown in every direction, with each
