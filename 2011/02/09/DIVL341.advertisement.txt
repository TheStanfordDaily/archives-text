Cubberley Auditorium
"A spectacularly complicated reproductive mess among adults...
a comedy fertilized by a what if? case study." The Times (London)
What makes a parent? Love, genetics, giving birth? Returning to his scientific roots,
Chemistry Professor Djerassi explores the other side of planned parenthood. TABOOS is
a disquieting comedy about keeping it all in the family when emotions and science collide.
