There's a difference between communicating ideas and experiencing them.
It's the difference between memorizing a foreign language and thinking in
one. Between studying ruins and excavating them. Between analyzing dreams
and living them. The difference is huge. And it's the very essence of the University
of Chicago Summer Session. Where students are engaged at every level—
intellectually, socially, personally, and professionally. Where you can benefit from
the value of taking university courses in an accelerated, intensive format. Join
us this summer for an extraordinary learning experience at the academic home to
85 Nobel laureates.
FOR STUDENTS IN HIGH SCHOOL, COLLEGE, AND BEYOND.
JUNE 20—AUGUST 26, 2011
3, 4, 5, AND 6-WEEK SESSIONS
