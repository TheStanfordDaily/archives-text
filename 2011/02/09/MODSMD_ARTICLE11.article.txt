## THE 						GANG OF 14 A 						look at the handful of Stanford students involved with ROTC 
### BILLY GALLAGHER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The clock reads 3:30 a.m. on a Monday.
Most people across campus are fast
asleep: others are finishing papers and
problem sets. For Aly Gleason 'l3 and
Kirk Morrow 'll, the day has already
begun. They need to make it to San Jose by 5 a.m.
for their early morning physical training for Air
Force Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC).
As elite universities across the nation weigh the
pros and cons of reinstating ROTC on their cam
puses, Stanford students and faculty have begun lin
ing up on both sides of the argument. Yet for as
much debate and discussion that these four letters
have stirred all over campus this year, very few
within the Stanford community know much about
the fourteen students currently participating in the
program.
Fourteen out of 6,887 students the ROTC
community on campus is approximately the same
size as an IHUM section. Hailing from all over the
United States, spanning all four classes, bringing dif
ferent backgrounds, they represent the diversity,
talent and passion of Stanford students. But as the
national spotlight has shifted to their program, most
of the individual cadets don't notice much of a dif
ference between those in ROTC and their peers.
"We're just like anyone else who got into Stan
ford," said Lillian Mcßee 'l4. "We got in through
the same selection process. We're not that different
from everyone else."
Their schedule, however, is far from typical.
Depending on the week, with service and their
ROTC-given jobs, cadets commute anywhere from
two to six times per week to their respective ser
vice's location. Stanford's ROTC program was offi
cially phased out from campus in 1973 and the Uni
versity declined to award academic units for stu
dents who remotely participated in the program. As
a result, Stanford's current Naval and Marine
cadets go to UC-Berkeley, the Air Force cadets go
to San Jose State University and the Army candi
dates go to Santa Clara University.
The commutes to these schools, which range
from half an hour to an hour on a good day, impact
the course selection and extracurricular activities of
the cadets.
"The commute is part of the time commitment,"
said Morrow. "There's definitely been a few times
where there's been a class that I wanted to take but
I couldn't because I would need to be leaving to go
to ROTC at the tail end ... It was more of the com
mute that kept me from taking a class than it was
ROTC events."
"The fact that it's not on campus has inhibited
my ability to have academic freedom in terms of
choosing classes," added Jimmy Ruck 'll.
The cadets are required to take ROTC classes,
which differ from their Stanford course-load.
"The classes are not exactly the same as Stanford
classes because they've been fine tuned to give us
the officer development that we need," added Mor
row. "So they would be a great supplement to Stan
ford classes."
"For both ROTC classes I've had to work way
more than I've ever had to work for IHUM,"
Mcßee said. "And sophomores and upperclassmen
have even harder classes... the whole thing about
classes not being hard enough is definitely unfound
ed."
The difficulty of ROTC classes has prompted
some to question why Stanford does not award ac
ademic credit for the courses.
"The main issue for me is that Stanford doesn't
even recognize this as credit. If you took yoga, you
get one unit of non-academic credit," said Ruck. "At
the very least, Stanford can grant that to ROTC.
There's no doubt in my mind that it's comparable, if
not a lot more strenuous and time-intensive and
physically demanding, than some of these non-aca
demic units."
Most ROTC students spend at least part of four
days per week with their battalion performing a
wide range of activities including physical training,
leadership activities, classes and meetings.
Every Wednesday morning, ROTC cadets from
all four branches meet together on campus for
physical training. All Stanford military-affiliated
persons are invited, and it is the only time the cadets
are together as Stanford students, not at their sepa
rate schools.
The days can be long, especially on Thursdays
when the cadets often leave around noon and do
not return to campus until after 10 p.m. Gleason,
who is also a Division I athlete, noted that the bal
ance can be difficult at times.
"Our coaches are pretty understanding that
ROTC is where I want to go with my life.... I'm in
15 units right now and I couldn't take another class
if I tried. I would actually fail it."
However, it is clear to these students that Stan
ford academics come first.
"Our main priority is school and our second pri
ority is ROTC, and everything else comes after
that," Mcßee said. "While ROTC is a big part of
what we do, our academics come first, which is ex
plicitly stated in the program."
Ruck believes the return of ROTC is important
for the education of students and future officers
alike.
"People will become more exposed to the per
sonal side of the military and learn more about what
this aspect of our nation does on a daily basis," Ruck
said.
"Whether we like it or not, the military is going
to be a fundamental part of foreign policy that
shapes our events and world events for decades to
come, so its something that I feel like any citizen of
any country should have at least a baseline knowl
edge of the American military."

The 14 Stanford undergraduates involved in ROTC programs (above)
must commute to neighboring campuses to participate in the program.
ROTC has been removed from the Farm since 1973.
The clock reads 3:30 a.m. on a Monday.
Most people across campus are fast
asleep: others are finishing papers and
problem sets. For Aly Gleason 'l3 and
Kirk Morrow 'll, the day has already
begun. They need to make it to San Jose by 5 a.m.
for their early morning physical training for Air
Force Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC).
As elite universities across the nation weigh the
pros and cons of reinstating ROTC on their cam
puses, Stanford students and faculty have begun lin
ing up on both sides of the argument. Yet for as
much debate and discussion that these four letters
have stirred all over campus this year, very few
within the Stanford community know much about
the fourteen students currently participating in the
program.
Fourteen out of 6,887 students the ROTC
community on campus is approximately the same
size as an IHUM section. Hailing from all over the
United States, spanning all four classes, bringing dif
ferent backgrounds, they represent the diversity,
talent and passion of Stanford students. But as the
national spotlight has shifted to their program, most
of the individual cadets don't notice much of a dif
ference between those in ROTC and their peers.
"We're just like anyone else who got into Stan
ford," said Lillian Mcßee 'l4. "We got in through
the same selection process. We're not that different
from everyone else."
Their schedule, however, is far from typical.
Depending on the week, with service and their
ROTC-given jobs, cadets commute anywhere from
two to six times per week to their respective ser
vice's location. Stanford's ROTC program was offi
cially phased out from campus in 1973 and the Uni
versity declined to award academic units for stu
dents who remotely participated in the program. As
a result, Stanford's current Naval and Marine
cadets go to UC-Berkeley, the Air Force cadets go
to San Jose State University and the Army candi
dates go to Santa Clara University.
The commutes to these schools, which range
from half an hour to an hour on a good day, impact
the course selection and extracurricular activities of
the cadets.
"The commute is part of the time commitment,"
said Morrow. "There's definitely been a few times
where there's been a class that I wanted to take but
I couldn't because I would need to be leaving to go
to ROTC at the tail end ... It was more of the com
mute that kept me from taking a class than it was
ROTC events."
"The fact that it's not on campus has inhibited
my ability to have academic freedom in terms of
choosing classes," added Jimmy Ruck 'll.
The cadets are required to take ROTC classes,
which differ from their Stanford course-load.
"The classes are not exactly the same as Stanford
classes because they've been fine tuned to give us
the officer development that we need," added Mor
row. "So they would be a great supplement to Stan
ford classes."
"For both ROTC classes I've had to work way
more than I've ever had to work for IHUM,"
Mcßee said. "And sophomores and upperclassmen
have even harder classes... the whole thing about
classes not being hard enough is definitely unfound
ed."
The difficulty of ROTC classes has prompted
some to question why Stanford does not award ac
ademic credit for the courses.
"The main issue for me is that Stanford doesn't
even recognize this as credit. If you took yoga, you
get one unit of non-academic credit," said Ruck. "At
the very least, Stanford can grant that to ROTC.
There's no doubt in my mind that it's comparable, if
not a lot more strenuous and time-intensive and
physically demanding, than some of these non-aca
demic units."
Most ROTC students spend at least part of four
days per week with their battalion performing a
wide range of activities including physical training,
leadership activities, classes and meetings.
Every Wednesday morning, ROTC cadets from
all four branches meet together on campus for
physical training. All Stanford military-affiliated
persons are invited, and it is the only time the cadets
are together as Stanford students, not at their sepa
rate schools.
The days can be long, especially on Thursdays
when the cadets often leave around noon and do
not return to campus until after 10 p.m. Gleason,
who is also a Division I athlete, noted that the bal
ance can be difficult at times.
"Our coaches are pretty understanding that
ROTC is where I want to go with my life.... I'm in
15 units right now and I couldn't take another class
if I tried. I would actually fail it."
However, it is clear to these students that Stan
ford academics come first.
"Our main priority is school and our second pri
ority is ROTC, and everything else comes after
that," Mcßee said. "While ROTC is a big part of
what we do, our academics come first, which is ex
plicitly stated in the program."
Ruck believes the return of ROTC is important
for the education of students and future officers
alike.
"People will become more exposed to the per
sonal side of the military and learn more about what
this aspect of our nation does on a daily basis," Ruck
said.
"Whether we like it or not, the military is going
to be a fundamental part of foreign policy that
shapes our events and world events for decades to
come, so its something that I feel like any citizen of
any country should have at least a baseline knowl
edge of the American military."
