## EDITORIAL ResEd Should Allow Row Houses to Refund Social Dues 
### 
Suppose you were at the ATM,
intending to withdraw cash to
go grocery shopping. You
have a shopping list and a general
idea of how much each item will
cost. You intend to withdraw
enough money to ensure that you
can buy all the groceries on the list,
and you'll just deposit any excess
funds back in your account later.
Now a particularly clever friend
happens to pass by and makes the
following suggestion: "withdraw
money under the restriction that
you cannot redeposit any unused
funds; instead, you'll lose any un
spent cash. This way, you'll buy a lot
of food!" How should you re
spond?
That wasn't a trick question.The
analogy above should illustrate the
absurdity of Res Ed's new policy
that bars Row houses from refund
ing unspent social dues to residents.
Rather, the excess money will be
funneled into the Capital Reserve
Fund (CRF) that future residents
can only use to buy long-term
equipment like furniture. The rea
soning behind the policy goes
something like: "there is no longer
an incentive to spend less than the
collected social dues, so Row hous
es will fully spend their budgets and
enhance social life on the Row."
Analogously, we might expect
that you, the grocery shopper, will
get to the grocery store and decide
to buy less food so that you can re
turn more money to your bank ac
count. Perhaps this is true for those
of you with poor short-term mem
ory, but most normal shoppers
don't forget that they budgeted a
certain quantity of groceries for a
reason. Similarly, Row house staffs
probably don't experience changes
of heart after planning four events
and host only two in order to re
fund their residents; if they plan to
only have two events, they'll revise
the budget downward and charge
less in social dues this is obvi
ously more palatable to residents,
since they pay less up front.
What about the case where a
house puts on all planned events
and still ends up with a surplus?
ResEd may have intended its poli
cy to force the house to have anoth
er social event, since there is basi

cally no reason to relinquish those
funds to a CRF that will likely only
benefit future residents. Therefore,
the Row will host more social
events in aggregate than had al
ready been planned. But why not
simply stipulate that the houses
plan more events when initially
budgeting? Res Ed's solution
seems like a clunky way to accom
plish a relatively simple goal.
The disadvantages of the policy
are clear. There is now a disincen
tive to include a cushion in the
budget for unforeseen expendi
tures or uncertainty in prices.
Therefore, houses are much more
likely to run out of money before
making it through their whole so
cial calendar. Conversely, an end of
quarter surplus would drive the
staff to spend freely and inefficient
ly, probably on really expensive al
cohol; would this really be a justi
fied expenditure of student funds,
given most students' recent belt
tightening? Finally, this policy is
normatively questionable because
it amounts to a coercive money
transfer from current residents to
future residents. Had house staffers
been involved in the policy-making
process, they could have voiced
these concerns; instead, ResEd
moved unilaterally and without
consultation. Even more inexcus
able has been the administration's
unwillingness to clarify the policy
upon student request.
Every possible benefit that
ResEd could hope to capture with
the anti-refund constraint can be
accomplished in simpler ways. If
emergency CRF funds are neces
sary, make residents pay some
nominal fee each quarter to the
CRF, independent of social dues.
To ensure that Row social life re
mains vibrant, help staffs plan and
budget for more events at the be
ginning of the quarter. There is one
inane argument that this policy
equalizes the disparity between so
cial dues at large and small houses;
but refunding everybody nothing is
certainly worse than refunding
some people something. In sum,
ResEd has blindly implemented an
unnecessarily counterintuitive pol
icy that's attendant inefficiency
outweighs its non-unique benefits.

staff to spend freely and inefficient
ly, probably on really expensive al
cohol; would this really be a justi
fied expenditure of student funds,
given most students' recent belt
tightening? Finally, this policy is
normatively questionable because
it amounts to a coercive money
transfer from current residents to
future residents. Had house staffers
been involved in the policy-making
process, they could have voiced
these concerns; instead, ResEd
moved unilaterally and without
consultation. Even more inexcus
able has been the administration's
unwillingness to clarify the policy
upon student request.
Every possible benefit that
ResEd could hope to capture with
the anti-refund constraint can be
accomplished in simpler ways. If
emergency CRF funds are neces
sary, make residents pay some
nominal fee each quarter to the
CRF, independent of social dues.
To ensure that Row social life re
mains vibrant, help staffs plan and
budget for more events at the be
ginning of the quarter. There is one
inane argument that this policy
equalizes the disparity between so
cial dues at large and small houses;
but refunding everybody nothing is
certainly worse than refunding
some people something. In sum,
ResEd has blindly implemented an
unnecessarily counterintuitive pol
icy that's attendant inefficiency
outweighs its non-unique benefits.
