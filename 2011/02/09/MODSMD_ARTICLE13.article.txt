# SEEING GREEN
## A 						stone's throw away? 
### Holly Moeller 
I haven't had a TV in my life for
the past few years. So, when I fi
nally caught video clips from
Cairo last week, I was astounded.
Still images, no matter how provoca
tive, miss so many dimensions of the
conflict: the shouts and chants, the
simmering resentment and dogged
commitment, the flying stones and
sounds of gunfire that turned a rela
tively peaceful protest violent. I find
myself checking the news more
often now, hoping that the Egyptian
military remains ambivalent, fearing
that the body counts will rise.
For many of us, the walls of the
Stanford bubble are thick and
opaque; we can afford only a little
time to think deeply about the Mid
dle East's state of unrest. But we
should take that time, because the
current state of affairs is more than a
lesson on the perils of a 30-year-old
autocracy. Indeed, many of the is
sues faced by Egypt and by its
oil-rich neighbors are fundamen
tally ecological, the consequences of
a human population decoupled
from its environmental base. Could
the simmering chain reaction in the
Middle East today foreshadow a
global tomorrow?
On the surface, Egypt's story
reads like a case study on the inter
section of economics and demogra
phy. On the economics side: a 30-
percent jump in food prices coupled
with a 9.4 percent unemployment
rate and 30 million people living on
less than $2 per day. On the demo
graphic side: the perils of the ex
panding population pyramid. Sixty
percent of Egyptians swell its youth
ful base; 30 percent are between the
ages of 15 and 29.
These young Egyptians our
peers face an uncertain future.
The unemployment rate in the 15-29
age bracket is a staggering 25 per
cent. Job prospects outside the
country are not good: most have
completed many years of schooling,
but the caliber of the educational
system places their diplomas low on
the international scale. Meanwhile,

because of their age, they are less
likely to feel the stabilizing influ
ence of supporting a family. And so,
with nothing to lose and everything
to gain, they turn against a president
who has been in power longer than
they have been alive, hoping that a
change in government will heal
Egypt's ills.
Will it?

Perhaps in part. But the unem
ployment rates and skyrocketing
food prices are symptoms of a scari
er disease: an overpopulated region
(on an overpopulated planet) pre
cariously propped up by subsidies
from nonrenewable resources. In
Egypt, one of the trembling but
tresses is the Nile River, which sub
sidized the fertile delta that birthed
Ancient Egyptian civilization.
A free-flowing Nile was both a
blessing and a curse. It provided a
seemingly endless supply of water
and nutrient-rich silt, but its roaring
floods and devastating droughts
made farming on the delta a per
ilous business. Today, dams harness
the power of the world's longest
river, providing electricity and a
steady flow of water that has effec
tively doubled the growing season.
With an abundance of food and
modern medicine, infant mortality
dropped, and the population pyra
mid's base swelled. But it was not to
last: without annual floods to flush its
back canals and lay down a new layer
of sediment, the Nile Delta becomes
more polluted and sinks further to
ward the Mediterranean each year.
Increased demand for water has cre
ated yet another thirst that cannot be
slaked. Today, the fresh waters of the
Nile no longer reach the sea.
With natural resources stretched
to their maximum, Egypt must look
elsewhere to feed its people. The
Arab world as a whole imports 50
percent of its food, rendering popu
lations vulnerable to price fluctua
tions driven by flooding in Australia
or ethanol demand in the United
States.
And oil, the greatest nonrenew-

able resource of all, compounds the
problem in producing states. The re
source curse has paralyzed their
economies and stratified their soci
eties. Oil wealth, flowing through the
hands of a powerful few, supports
populations that far exceed the
desert region's ability to provide.
Most citizens are supported by heavy
subsidies and a disproportionately
large public sector. Educational sys
tems leave the youth with little op
portunity in the outside world, creat
ing a population wholly dependent
on an unsustainable edifice.
As I wrote last week, internation
al trade allows us to economize pro
duction by growing crops where
water is abundant, manufacturing
goods where labor is cheap and de
signing software where education is
good. But when your economy is
supported by a dwindling resource
and your population is not trained
for a transition, you are vulnerable
to collapse.
What does this say to the rest of
the world? We all rely heavily on oil
to grow our crops, to run our ma
chines, to transport our exports
worldwide. If oil supplies were cut
off tomorrow, and we had to look
within ourselves and our own bor
ders for support, how many stones
would fly across the National Mall?

Cairo last week, I was astounded.
Still images, no matter how provoca
tive, miss so many dimensions of the
conflict: the shouts and chants, the
simmering resentment and dogged
commitment, the flying stones and
sounds of gunfire that turned a rela
tively peaceful protest violent. I find
myself checking the news more
often now, hoping that the Egyptian
military remains ambivalent, fearing
that the body counts will rise.
For many of us, the walls of the
Stanford bubble are thick and
opaque; we can afford only a little
time to think deeply about the Mid
dle East's state of unrest. But we
should take that time, because the
current state of affairs is more than a
lesson on the perils of a 30-year-old
autocracy. Indeed, many of the is
sues faced by Egypt and by its
oil-rich neighbors are fundamen
tally ecological, the consequences of
a human population decoupled
from its environmental base. Could
the simmering chain reaction in the
Middle East today foreshadow a
global tomorrow?
On the surface, Egypt's story
reads like a case study on the inter
section of economics and demogra
phy. On the economics side: a 30-
percent jump in food prices coupled
with a 9.4 percent unemployment
rate and 30 million people living on
less than $2 per day. On the demo
graphic side: the perils of the ex
panding population pyramid. Sixty
percent of Egyptians swell its youth
ful base; 30 percent are between the
ages of 15 and 29.
These young Egyptians our
peers face an uncertain future.
The unemployment rate in the 15-29
age bracket is a staggering 25 per
cent. Job prospects outside the
country are not good: most have
completed many years of schooling,
but the caliber of the educational
system places their diplomas low on
the international scale. Meanwhile,

because of their age, they are less
likely to feel the stabilizing influ
ence of supporting a family. And so,
with nothing to lose and everything
to gain, they turn against a president
who has been in power longer than
they have been alive, hoping that a
change in government will heal
Egypt's ills.
Will it?

Perhaps in part. But the unem
ployment rates and skyrocketing
food prices are symptoms of a scari
er disease: an overpopulated region
(on an overpopulated planet) pre
cariously propped up by subsidies
from nonrenewable resources. In
Egypt, one of the trembling but
tresses is the Nile River, which sub
sidized the fertile delta that birthed
Ancient Egyptian civilization.
A free-flowing Nile was both a
blessing and a curse. It provided a
seemingly endless supply of water
and nutrient-rich silt, but its roaring
floods and devastating droughts
made farming on the delta a per
ilous business. Today, dams harness
the power of the world's longest
river, providing electricity and a
steady flow of water that has effec
tively doubled the growing season.
With an abundance of food and
modern medicine, infant mortality
dropped, and the population pyra
mid's base swelled. But it was not to
last: without annual floods to flush its
back canals and lay down a new layer
of sediment, the Nile Delta becomes
more polluted and sinks further to
ward the Mediterranean each year.
Increased demand for water has cre
ated yet another thirst that cannot be
slaked. Today, the fresh waters of the
Nile no longer reach the sea.
With natural resources stretched
to their maximum, Egypt must look
elsewhere to feed its people. The
Arab world as a whole imports 50
percent of its food, rendering popu
lations vulnerable to price fluctua
tions driven by flooding in Australia
or ethanol demand in the United
States.
And oil, the greatest nonrenew-

able resource of all, compounds the
problem in producing states. The re
source curse has paralyzed their
economies and stratified their soci
eties. Oil wealth, flowing through the
hands of a powerful few, supports
populations that far exceed the
desert region's ability to provide.
Most citizens are supported by heavy
subsidies and a disproportionately
large public sector. Educational sys
tems leave the youth with little op
portunity in the outside world, creat
ing a population wholly dependent
on an unsustainable edifice.
As I wrote last week, internation
al trade allows us to economize pro
duction by growing crops where
water is abundant, manufacturing
goods where labor is cheap and de
signing software where education is
good. But when your economy is
supported by a dwindling resource
and your population is not trained
for a transition, you are vulnerable
to collapse.
What does this say to the rest of
the world? We all rely heavily on oil
to grow our crops, to run our ma
chines, to transport our exports
worldwide. If oil supplies were cut
off tomorrow, and we had to look
within ourselves and our own bor
ders for support, how many stones
would fly across the National Mall?
