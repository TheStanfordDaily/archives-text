# THIS COLUMN IS IRONIC
## Midterm-inally Ill? Some Prescriptions to Avoid Your Work 
### Shane Savitsky 
That time of the quarter we all
dread is in full swing again:
midterm season. Instead of
being allowed to enjoy our privi
leged lives, professors are actually
forcing us to do work. I don't know
about you, but I'm staring down a
slew of papers and exams right now.
(Can someone please tell Econ IB
that scheduling exams two weeks
apart is just sadistic?) Luckily, I'm
here to offer you a variety of op
tions to help you to survive this lat
est round of midterms.
Procrastinate
If you're supposed to practice
what you preach, then I'm definite
ly coming through for you here. I re
ally need to stop procrastinating. I'll
do that later, though. Right now, I'll
tell you how to avoid your midterms
entirely. Just get yourself a Netflix
account. Somehow, in the past two
weeks, I've managed to fly through
the first two seasons of "Parks and
Recreation." I'm so busy that I'm
not really sure how that happened,
but it did. Netflix is actually scientif
ically guaranteed to sap you of the
will to work. Haven't watched all six
seasons of "Lost" yet? There's no
better time than right now.
To top things off, in the midst of
this hellish week of midterms, one
of my good friends who graduated

last year decided to visit. Needless
to say, a few nights this week turned
into Taco Bell-catered Halo fests
reaching well past 3 a.m. That's
probably not the best idea when
you have a political science paper
(or this column) waiting to be writ
ten, but neither is going to EBF at 2
a.m. on a Wednesday night.
Party
Speaking of EBF, you can always
just rage your face off if you don't
want to work. I guarantee that you
probably won't be worrying about
that paper you have due if you're
blacked out. Personally, I'm pretty
glad that Kairos' Wine and Cheese
night is biweekly. If I had to contend
with that this week, I'm not sure
how much work I could possibly get
done on Wednesday.
Seriously, if you're that stressed
about midterms, then your only op
tion is to get to the Bromuda Trian
gle and let your worries flow out of
you. If you go hard enough tonight,
chances are that they won't be the
only thing flowing out of you by
midnight.
Enjoy the sunshine
Ah, the weather! Seriously, this
is why we came to Stanford in the
first place. Look around and see
everyone taking advantage of the
beautiful California clime. Spot the

bros playing hardcore games of ulti
mate on fields around campus.
Check out the sorority girls sunning
themselves on Cowell Lawn. Laugh
as computer science majors franti
cally try to avoid the sun. This is the
life. Why should midterms bring us
down?
Really, you can't ask for any
thing better than the weather at
Stanny U right now. Where's the
winter quarter rain? How is it con
sistently above 60 degrees in early
February? Don't question it. In
stead, alleviate your midterm blues
by cranking up some killer tunes
and loving the sunshine. (Protip: try
"Simple Graces" by Delorean. I
think it was made for this weather.)
Honestly, the Ivy League can suck
it. Blair Waldorf is still prancing
around Columbia in her Chanel
winter coat, but flip flops are al
ready part of my everyday attire.
Score one for Stanny.
Actually get your work done early

I know, I know, what a cheap way
to end the column, right? I'm really
trying to give you some sensible ad
vice. I know you expect better from
me. However, last week I somehow
managed to finish my econ problem
set (due Friday) by Wednesday
evening. It was magical! I had time
for things! I wasn't rushing to do
everything in a three-hour span on
Thursday night.
Here's the best part: if you man
age to finish everything on time,
then you can work in my three

pieces of earlier advice with no
qualms. By day, you could sunbathe
while watching "Arrested Develop
ment" on Netflix. By night, you
could engage in extreme debauch
ery. That's what I call "living the
dream," Stanford.

Actually get your work done early

I know, I know, what a cheap way
to end the column, right? I'm really
trying to give you some sensible ad
vice. I know you expect better from
me. However, last week I somehow
managed to finish my econ problem
set (due Friday) by Wednesday
evening. It was magical! I had time
for things! I wasn't rushing to do
everything in a three-hour span on
Thursday night.
Here's the best part: if you man
age to finish everything on time,
then you can work in my three

pieces of earlier advice with no
qualms. By day, you could sunbathe
while watching "Arrested Develop
ment" on Netflix. By night, you
could engage in extreme debauch
ery. That's what I call "living the
dream," Stanford.
