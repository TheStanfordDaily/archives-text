## TENNIS WHACKS UTES Stanford men roll over visiting Utah 
### DASH DAVIDSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The No. 8 Stanford men's ten
nis team (5-0, 0-0 Pac-10) re
mained undefeated in dual-match
play yesterday afternoon, domi
nating Utah at Taube Tennis Sta
dium by a score of 7-0. Even more
impressive for the Cardinal team

is the fact that the victory came
without two of the squad's top
players —juniors Bradley Klahn
and Ryan Thacher.

For their efforts, Thacher and
Klahn received a wild-card entry
into the doubles draw of the 2011
SAP Open at PIP Pavilion in San
Jose this week and are scheduled
to play their first match Tuesday

evening. Klahn, the defending
NCAA singles champion, was
also awarded a wild-card entry
into the singles draw, where he
will play the No. 12 player in the
world, France's Gael Monfils, in
the first round on Wednesday
night.
The inactivity of Klahn and
Thacher forced head coach John
Whitlinger to reshuffle his lineup.

GAME NOTES: No. 8 Stanford has cruised to
a 5-0 start to its season with strong play up
and down the lineup. Next up for the Cardi

shaky early season, but will arrive on the
Farm riding a two-match winning streak.

With Bradley Klahn and Ryan Thacher gone, Alex Clayton, above, stepped up and played No. 1 singles for the Cardinal yesterday. The senior had an
easy two-set victory as the Cardinal defeated the visiting Utah Utes 7-0. With the win, Stanford stayed undefeated and improved to 5-0 on the season.

beneficiaries, and both recorded
their first collegiate dual-match
victories in the win.
The tone was set early for the
Cardinal, who blitzed the Utes in
the doubles matches and the top
three singles matches, securing a
victory in the contest early on. Se
nior Alex Clayton and sophomore
Denis Lin filled in admirably for
the absent Klahn and Thacher as
the Cardinal's top two players and
dispatched their opponents with
ease in their singles matches,
outscoring them by a combined
tally of 24 games to six.
Ball, who was making his first
collegiate appearance, won out of
the No. 6 spot.
"Everyone played pretty solid
and it went well," Ball said. "For
me personally, it was great to get
my first win under my belt I
was pretty nervous at first but
managed to pull it out in the
end."
Senior Greg Hirshman won at
No. 3 in singles play, and sopho
more Matt Kandath at No. 4.
Kehrer was a straight-set winner
at No. 5.
Ball, a top recruit out of nearby
Menlo School, is one of three
freshmen on the team, each of

whom is looking to contribute
something to a Stanford team that
has been perfect this season.
This weekend looks to be an
important one for the Cardinal.
The team will face No. 38 BYU on
Friday, and on Saturday, Stanford
will head over to Berkeley for a
match with the No. 19 Golden
Bears.
Ball thinks that this type of lop
sided win will be good for the team
as it prepares for the weekend.
"It's definitely good, it gets
everyone match-tough and on top
of their game," he said. "Cal will be
a great match, and there's defi
nitely a lot on the table with them
being our rivals."
Ball added that he doesn't
think the absence of Klahn and
Thacher will negatively affect the
team.
"If anything, it fires us up to
know that one of our guys will play
someone ranked No. 12 in the
world on Wednesday night," he
said. "I think it'll definitely get
Brad ready for this weekend."
The Stanford men's tennis
team must believe it's in a good
place when it can coast to victory
without its top two players. The
duo will return for this weekend's
action, which opens against the
Cougars at 1:30 p.m. on Friday at
Taube Tennis Stadium.

Brad ready for this weekend."
The Stanford men's tennis
team must believe it's in a good
place when it can coast to victory
without its top two players. The
duo will return for this weekend's
action, which opens against the
Cougars at 1:30 p.m. on Friday at
Taube Tennis Stadium.
