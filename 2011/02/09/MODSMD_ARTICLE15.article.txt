nis team (5-0, 0-0 Pac-10) re
mained undefeated in dual-match
play yesterday afternoon, domi
nating Utah at Taube Tennis Sta
dium by a score of 7-0. Even more
impressive for the Cardinal team

For their efforts, Thacher and

world, France's Gael Monfils, in
the first round on Wednesday
night.

Thacher forced head coach John
Whitlinger to reshuffle his lineup.
Sophomore Walker Kehrer and
freshman Jamin Ball were the
