### KEVIN ZHANG DAILY SPORTS INTERN 
Top-ranked Stanford sent its opponents packing at
the 2011 Stanford Invitational last weekend, earning
four victories over Arizona, Cal, San Jose State and
USC. The team successfully defended its 2010 title,

and No. 15 Indiana. Bracket B included No. 1 Stanford,
No. 3 Cal, No. 8 Arizona State and No. 9 San Jose State.

The Cardinal (8-

this time with the
Cardinal on top, 10-
9, in a sudden-death
thriller that went to
triple overtime.
The team began
the tournament

freshman driver Kaley Dodson, sophomore driver Vic

Sophomore driver Vee Dunlevie added two goals.
Later on Saturday, Stanford doubled up rival Cal,
10-5. Junior driver Alyssa Lo led the team with four
goals, and senior goalkeeper Amber Oland had 12
saves. Dries continued her excellent play with a hat-
