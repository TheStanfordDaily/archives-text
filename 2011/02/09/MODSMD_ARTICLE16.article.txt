## Women beat USC in 30T, take home Stanford Invitational title 
### KEVIN ZHANG DAILY SPORTS INTERN 
Top-ranked Stanford sent its opponents packing at
the 2011 Stanford Invitational last weekend, earning
four victories over Arizona, Cal, San Jose State and
USC. The team successfully defended its 2010 title,
which, at the time, marked the first Stanford Invita
tional it won in seven years.
This year's invitational featured eight of the best
teams in the country, separated into two groups. Brack
et A consisted of No. 2 USC, No. 4 UCLA, No. 5 Hawaii
and No. 15 Indiana. Bracket B included No. 1 Stanford,
No. 3 Cal, No. 8 Arizona State and No. 9 San Jose State.

The Cardinal (8-
0) swept its four
games with a diversi
fied attack, defeating
USC in a rematch of
last year's national
championship game.
The final score
looked familiar, but
this time with the
Cardinal on top, 10-
9, in a sudden-death
thriller that went to
triple overtime.
The team began
the tournament
against Arizona
State on Saturday
morning. Led by

sophomore two-meter Annika Dries, who scored half
of the team's goals, Stanford cruised to a 10-1 victory
with all goals coming from non-seniors, including
freshman driver Kaley Dodson, sophomore driver Vic
toria Kennedy and junior driver Pallavi Menon.
Sophomore driver Vee Dunlevie added two goals.
Later on Saturday, Stanford doubled up rival Cal,
10-5. Junior driver Alyssa Lo led the team with four
goals, and senior goalkeeper Amber Oland had 12
saves. Dries continued her excellent play with a hat-

game the Cardinal defeated defending-champion USC in triple overtime for the title.
trick against the Golden Bears.
She was later named Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation Player
of the Week for her excellent tour
nament.
Stanford concluded its bracket
play the following morning with a
dominant 16-4 victory over its
South Bay rival, San Jose State.
Stanford had another balanced at
tack featuring goals from 10 dif
ferent players.
"A key to our strong start has
no doubt been our depth," said
head coach John Tanner. "We have
great depth at every position."
At 4:30 p.m. on Super Bowl
Sunday, Stanford got in the pool
for a much-anticipated matchup
with No. 2 USC. A sizeable crowd
was present for the back-and
forth affair, with both teams gain

ing momentum in separate
stretches. The game was tied after
the first quarter at 2-2, after the
second quarter at 3-3 and at the
end of regulation at 7-7.
After USC senior Kristen
Dronberger notched her fourth
goal on a backhand shot that tied
the score at seven apiece with 1:17
to play, drama unfolded at Avery
in the final minute of regulation.
A Stanford turnover with 10 sec
onds to go followed by an exclu
sion seconds later gave USC one
last shot for a goal. However,
USC's last-second prayer sailed
far wide of the cage, and USC
head coach Jovan Vavic was visi
bly upset about what he thought
was a clock malfunction that
forced the wild shot.
In overtime, Menon had a
beautiful, arcing bar-in goal with
three seconds left in the first over
time period, which put Stanford in
front, 9-8.
The Cardinal seemed to have
the game in check in the second

overtime period with a 9-8 lead,
but a turnover and exclusion with
under 30 seconds left enabled
USC freshmen two-meter Made
line Rosenthal to tie the score with
a goal inside with 13 seconds left.
In sudden death, the teams
were scoreless in the first frame,
which included several huge saves
by both goalies and a bar-out 5-
meter penalty by Menon. The
nail-biter ended with a skip shot
by Dodson with 16 seconds left in
the second sudden-death period.
"The emotional victory really
showed the team's resilience,"
Tanner said. "We missed opportu
nities to go by three goals multiple
times. However, whenever we had
a setback, we rebounded quickly.
Also, it didn't help that the USC
goalie had a great game."
USC's freshman goalie Flora
Bolonyai had 10 saves, including a
breakaway save mid-way through
the second quarter and an athletic
stop in the second overtime peri
od that kept USC within striking

distance. She was named MPSF
Newcomer of the Week after her
impressive outing during the
weekend.
Stanford sported another di
verse offensive outing with goals
coming from seven different play
ers. Dodson, Dries and junior two
meter Melissa Seidemann led the
team with a pair each.
Once the season heats up, Stan
ford plans to see Cal, UCLA and
USC again, whether in the sched
uled MPSF season or the playoffs.
"We need to be more methodi
cal. Against these teams, we need
to find and finish opportunities,"
Tanner said. "Overall, we were not
decisive enough this weekend,
and we need to be crisper on of
fense."
The Card is out of action for
two weeks, but is scheduled to
travel east to Stockton, Calif, to
face Pacific on Feb. 20.
