# Hoping for the NFL lockout
## 
### Kabir Sawhney Follow the Money 
With the NFL's own
ers and Players As
sociation locked in
a heated battle over
a new collective
bargaining agreement, it's becoming
more likely every day that the league
is headed for a lockout. If a new
agreement isn't struck by March 3,
the owners will lock out the players; if
a resolution isn't reached by Septem
ber, the NFL could cancel the entire
season.
There's only one position that I re
ally identify with, which is the players'
refusal to acquiesce to an 18-game
season. Such a long campaign would
increase injury risk tremendously and
dilute the value of each regular-sea
son game.
Although I like the NFL, I have to
concede that I'm really rooting for
neither side to prevail, but rather to
see the lockout happen. An NFL
lockout would be an untold boon for
college football, dramatically increas
ing TV viewership as disaffected fans
would flock from the pros to the
NCAA.
Next season would be a great one
for the nation's collective sporting
conscious to focus firmly on college
football. The results of conference re
alignment and all the juicy story
lines that fall from it will be on full
display, as the new Pac-12, Big Ten
and Big 12 all commence play. As the
Ohio State Tattoo Five and the Cam
Newton sagas continue to unfold, we
could see even more pressure for the
sport to reform itself and curb the un
savory practices that "football-facto
ry" programs regularly engage in.
More viewership would be highly
beneficial to Stanford as well. Fans of
both NFL teams in the Bay Area
would turn to Stanford and Cal for
their football, and we might actually
get a full stadium pretty regularly
when disaffected 49ers fans discover
the (relatively) low ticket prices and
high-quality football just down the
road. Stanford's football team will
likely enter next season with a top-10
ranking and its most hype in recent
memory, so the timing of the NFL
lockout would be fortuitous indeed.
An NFL-less season could also
bring in more money for Stanford
and the Pac-12 in the long term. The
conference is due to renegotiate its
media deal soon and would be in a
much stronger bargaining position if
it had viewership numbers swelled by
exiled NFL fans. Stanford is already
set to see its slice of revenue from the
conference jump dramatically, but an
added dollop of cash never hurts.
College teams could also schedule
games for Sunday, giving us a full
weekend of college football as op
posed to just a single Saturday as we
have now. College programs aren't
technically prevented from schedul
ing games on Sunday they only re
frain from doing so because they
don't want to compete against the
NFL for viewership.
By contrast, the NFL is barred by
its antitrust exemption from staging
Saturday games during the college
regular season. If college football is
able to build a Sunday audience, big
programs could compete regularly
and successfully against the NFL for
years to come.
However, the biggest benefit from
a college football-focused fall would
n't be monetary it would be the in
creased pressure for a playoff Almost
everyone is dissatisfied with the BCS,
but part of the reason that it hasn't
been blown up yet is that, after the
bowls are over, we can all sit back on
our couches and prepare to watch a
few weeks of NFL playoff action.
Without the Super Bowl, the bowl
games would feel empty, and pressure
would intensify for college football to
crown its champion via an eight- or
16-team playoff
After all, one only has to look at
this season to see why a playoff is bet
ter than the BCS system. The Super
Bowl champions, the Green Bay
Packers, got into the playoffs with a
six seed; if we had a BCS-type system
in the NFL, there's no way the Pack
gets voted into the Super Bowl!
