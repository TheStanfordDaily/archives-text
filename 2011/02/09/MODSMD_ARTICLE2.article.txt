N+l founders Mark Greif and
Keith Gessen spoke Tuesday evening

"We would not
run out of beer
again as long as
our magazine
lives."
— Keith Gessen, n+1 founder

on the pleasures and perils of starting
a small literary magazine. In a presen
tation filled with humor and flecked
with colorful anecdotes, Greif and
Gessen offered advice to aspiring
writers and entrepreneurs, sharing
stories about the humble beginnings
of what has in the last five years be
come a successful literary enterprise.
Greif, a current co-editor at n+l,
opened the evening with a public
reading of what he called "The Truth
about n+l," a piece he wrote for the
Welsh journal Raconteur, about
starting one's own magazine. His
work has also appeared in Harper's
and The New York Times.
Discussing his early doubts about
founding a literary and political jour
nal, he said, "it's a foolish act to start a
magazine."
Nevertheless, he launched one.
"I write things that nobody will
publish, and my friends do, too,"
Greif said.
Greif also recounted the financial
troubles that plagued the magazine's
earliest volumes.
"The real source of worry, as it is
for all small magazines, was money,"
he said.
Greif told tales often as colorful,
and as unpredictable, as n+l itself.
From conflicts with Gessen, whom
Greif said he frequently wanted to
"throttle" during the magazine's
tough early days, to the unexpected
pleasures of unpaid literary achieve
ment, Greif offered an unconven
tional inside look into the world of lit
erary startups.
"All of my life, I had wanted to
find out what Bohemia was like, and I
did," Greif said.
Though he suffered from sleepless
nights writing content to dreary after
noons looking for distributors, it was
all worth it in the end, concluded a
smiling Greif.
"People at small magazines work
for free, because freedom is what's at
stake," he said.

Writer Keith Gessen recounted the
early days of his magazine, n+1.
According to co-founder Mark
Grief, they faced many 'sleepless
nights' and 'dreary afternoons.'
Co-editor and co-founder
Gessen, who has written for The
New Yorker, The Nation and the
London Review of Books, took
center stage for the last half of the
event. Dryly observing that his
chief inspiration for starting a mag
azine was really just to "get out of
the house," Gessen lit up the audi
ence with snippets of startup life,
from post-publication parties to
late-night editing woes.
Lamenting the fact that n+l's
first two staff parties ran out of beer
a disaster he described as "very
traumatizing," and which led the
staff to proclaim that "we would not
run out of beer as long as our mag
azine lives" Gessen proceeded
to elicit appreciative laughter from

the audience as he lambasted his
alma mater, Harvard.
"The Lampoon was not funny
[and] the Crimson was not inform
ative," he said.
Citing the bad impression he got
from Harvard's literary magazine,
the Advocate, which he called "pre
tentious," Gessen criticized aca
demic atmospheres that promote
"a psychology of constantly trying
out for something, but never pro
ducing anything for the people
around you."
In the ensuing question and an
swer session, Greif and Gessen
took questions from the audience,
which ranged from how best to deal
with stubborn writers to the advan
tages of moving into book format.
Concluding the lecture, Greif said,
"no one could pay us for what we
do."
