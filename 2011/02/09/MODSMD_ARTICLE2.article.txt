### MILES UNTERREINER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
N+l founders Mark Greif and
Keith Gessen spoke Tuesday evening

"We would not
run out of beer
again as long as
our magazine
lives."
â€” Keith Gessen, n+1 founder

on the pleasures and perils of starting
a small literary magazine. In a presen
tation filled with humor and flecked
with colorful anecdotes, Greif and
Gessen offered advice to aspiring
writers and entrepreneurs, sharing
stories about the humble beginnings
of what has in the last five years be
come a successful literary enterprise.
Greif, a current co-editor at n+l,
opened the evening with a public
reading of what he called "The Truth
about n+l," a piece he wrote for the
Welsh journal Raconteur, about
starting one's own magazine. His
work has also appeared in Harper's
and The New York Times.
Discussing his early doubts about
founding a literary and political jour
nal, he said, "it's a foolish act to start a
magazine."
Nevertheless, he launched one.
"I write things that nobody will
publish, and my friends do, too,"
Greif said.
Greif also recounted the financial
troubles that plagued the magazine's
earliest volumes.
"The real source of worry, as it is
for all small magazines, was money,"
he said.
Greif told tales often as colorful,
and as unpredictable, as n+l itself.
From conflicts with Gessen, whom
Greif said he frequently wanted to
"throttle" during the magazine's
tough early days, to the unexpected
pleasures of unpaid literary achieve
ment, Greif offered an unconven
tional inside look into the world of lit
erary startups.
"All of my life, I had wanted to
find out what Bohemia was like, and I
did," Greif said.
Though he suffered from sleepless
nights writing content to dreary after
noons looking for distributors, it was
all worth it in the end, concluded a
smiling Greif.
"People at small magazines work
for free, because freedom is what's at
stake," he said.
