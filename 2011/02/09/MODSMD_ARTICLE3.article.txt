## Recycle Mania contest begins Stanford to compete with universities in nationwide effort to reduce waste 
### SAMANTHA MCGIRR SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford kicked off Recycle Mania on Sunday,
marking its fifth year as a participant in the na
tionwide competition measuring recycling on col
lege campuses.
The contest runs until April 4 and requires
Stanford to regularly report its recycling and trash
tonnage, with Recycle Mania compiling weekly
rankings of participating universities in eight cat
egories.
630 colleges are participating in this year's
event, according to the tournament's website. The
contest is a project of the College and University
Recycling Council, an arm of the nonprofit organ
ization National Recycling Coalition.
At Stanford, the program represents a joint un
dertaking of Peninsula Sanitary Services, Inc.
(PSSI), Buildings & Grounds Maintenance
(BGM) and the Sustainability and Energy Man-


AN ASTASIA YEE/The Stanford Daily
agement Department (SEM).
According to Fahmida Ahmed,
associate director of the Office of
Sustainability, which is a branch of
SEM, the University plans to
achieve a 10 percent increase in
overall recycling by focusing on ed
ucation and outreach.
"The most common problem we
hear from students is not knowing
what to recycle and what not to,"
Ahmed said, adding that new labels
have been placed on recycling and
compost bins this year to address
this issue.
Additionally, Stanford Recycle -
Mania will feature a new individual
recognition component. To enter a
weekly raffle, students, faculty and
staff must submit a pledge agreeing
not to throw any recyclable items
into the trash. Winners will receive a
small prize.
"It's really important for conser
vation programs aiming for behav
ior change to include incentives,"
Ahmed said.
Stanford has generated varied
rankings during its four years of par
ticipation in Recycle Mania. The

University has consistently placed
among the top five contenders in
the "Gorilla" category, which refers
to total tons recycled. It won first
place in the category in 2008.
However, in the category of
waste minimization, which meas
ures the tons of waste generated per
person, Stanford has performed
poorly. The University placed 147 of
148 schools in 2009 and 191 of 199
schools in 2010.
Julie Muir,PSSI community rela
tions manager, said the mixed per
formance reflected the unique chal
lenges of recycling at a large univer
sity.
"The Gorilla prize gives credit to
larger universities, which have to
handle a lot more material," Muir
said.
The large volume of material,
however, poses difficulties when
sorting the waste.
"We recycle a lot, but we do a re
ally good job of wasting," Muir said.
"Tlirough recycling audits, we can
study what goes to the landfill. We
found that about 25 percent of what
goes to the landfill is actually recy
clable, and about 30 percent is com
postable."
Angela Kwok 'l3, co-president
of the student-run Green Living
Council (GLC), pointed out that
composting is not always a readily
available option for students.

"Composting is lacking in resi
dences," Kwok said. "In dining halls,
it's convenient [to compost], but
when people bring food back to
their room, a lot of them don't take
the time to bring what can be com
posted back to the dining hall."
Muir acknowledged that the
composting program, which began
in 2003, has been an integral compo
nent of sustainability on campus.
She nevertheless stressed the need
for strategic and cautious expan
sion.
"With composting, you have to
pay [sanitation services], and it's
only slightly cheaper than a land
fill," Muir said. "You also have to
consider factors like odor and pest
control. If you move too fast, you
could have problems that set you
back."
According to Muir, all the dining
halls and half the cafes on campus
currently have compost options.
Ahmed hopes the Recycle Mania
competition will prompt individuals
to reconsider not only their recy
cling and composting habits, but
also the entirety of their consumer
behaviors.
"One question we should ask is:
'how can we create less waste to
begin with,"' she said.
