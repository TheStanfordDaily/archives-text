# Tuition to increase by 3.5 percent
## Trustees announce fee hike across schools to 'improve faculty' 
### AN LE NGUYEN MANAGING EDITOR 
The Board of Trustees approved a combined tuition,
room and board increase of 3.5 percent for the 2011-
2012 academic year. This rise will be applied across the
University, with the exception of Stanford Law School,
which will see a 5.75-percent hike in its fees.
In a press briefing Monday, Board President Leslie
Hume said revenue from the tuition increase would ad
dress the University's "need for unrestricted operating
funds."
Approximately 57 percent of Stanford's general
funds the portion of the University budget that can
be used flexibly comes from tuition revenue. This
money is typically used for faculty raises, programmatic
purposes and, occasionally, capital projects.
Hume noted that the trustees felt positively about
the newly approved tuition, room and board fees. She
explained that next year's revenue could pay for faculty
salary increases and the gradual reinstatement of posi
tions frozen during the recession.
"It is going to enable the University to achieve an im
provement of the faculty," Hume said.
According to the trustees, this will be a balanced tu
ition increase since financial aid is expected to go up in
tandem. Financial aid totaled $66 million in 2007 and is
projected to reach $122 million in 2012.
Hume said the trustees "are very conscious about fi
nancial aid."
"Any tuition increase will be met with additional
funds for families whose financial circumstances are un
changed," she added.
At the same time, Dean of Admission Richard Shaw
is spreading the word about Stanford's need-blind fi
nancial aid policy. The University aims to make this pol
icy visible because it does not want prospective students
to turn away from applying simply because of the tuition
hike. Currently, students whose families make under
$60,000 receive full financial aid.
Families making less than $lOO,OOO
are only obligated to pay room and
board.
In Feb. 2010, the Board of
Trustees approved a similar 3.5-
percent increase in undergraduate

tuition for the current academic
year.
The Law School will implement
a more dramatic increase in tuition,
room and board. Flume explained
that the school was "under-pricing"
itself relative to its competitors.
"There was a feeling that we
were delivering a quality product
equal to or better than our competi
tors, and yet our tuition costs less,"
she said.
In other news, the Board of
Trustees gave concept and site ap
proval for Phase 2 of the Stanford
Auxiliary Library project. The Aux
iliary Library, which is located in
Livermore, expects to double its
storage capacity at a $35.5 million
price tag. The West Campus Recre
ation Center, which was approved
in December, received design ap
proval.
In April, the Board of Trustees
will take a more in-depth look at
land use on the Farm.
