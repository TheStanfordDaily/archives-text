# NEWS BRIEFS
## Three scientists named 2010 fellows of American Physics Society 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF —Ivy Nguyen 
Three Stanford scientists two
professors and one research scientist
—> are slated to join the ranks of
the American Physical Society
(APS), according to an announce
ment released Tuesday. Associate
professor of materials science and
engineering Mark Brongersma, sen
ior research scientist Igor
Moskalenko and mechanical engi
neering professor Juan Santiago will
join more than 200 other 2010 fel
lows.
Brongersma, whose lab special
izes in building and studying
nanoscale electronic and photonic
materials such as optical sensors, was
selected for his pioneering work in
plasmonics and silicon nanophoton
ics.
Moskalenko works as a senior re
search scientist in the Hanson Ex
perimental Physics Laboratory
(HEPL) and the Kavli Institute for
Particle Astrophysics and Cosmolo
gy. He was nominated for his work in
gamma-ray astronomy and for mak
ing computations of high-energy
charged particle and gamma radia
tion from the galaxy available to the
astrophysics community at large,
Santiago directs the Stanford Mi
crofluidics Laboratory. He was se
lected for his work in discovering
new measurement methods and new
ways to characterize and explain
electrically driven flow instabilities.
