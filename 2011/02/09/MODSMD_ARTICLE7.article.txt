## Senate puts ROTC question on ballot 
### MARGARET RAWSON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The ASSU Senate passed three bills Tuesday evening: one to add
an advisory question on ROTC to the April ASSU general elections
ballot, a second involving significant special fees reform and a third
to fund Green Events Consulting.
The Senate also discussed a bill to revise the rules of order for the
Constitutional Council.
ROTC
The Senate passed a bill authored by ASSU President Angelina
Cardona 'll to include "advisory referenda" on the spring 2011 bal
lot. The bill would gauge student opinion on the potential return of
ROTC to campus.
"Hopefully there's enough time ... for people to educate them
selves" on ROTC before the vote, Cardona said.
The advisory question will include three response choices. Stu
dents will be able to vote to support the return of ROTC to campus,
oppose the return or abstain from the question.
The measure to include the advisory question on the ballot will
require majority approval by the Graduate Student Council (GSC).
Special Fees
The GSC rejected a bill last week passed by the Senate to allow
student groups receiving special fees to grow their budgets by up to
10 percent without having to petition for student signatures. But
Tuesday saw the Senate passing a new, more comprehensive version
of the bill.
Last night's bill includes the change to the 10 percent budget
growth and stipulates that the chair of the two legislative bodies must
meet during the fall and winter to decide special fees policies. This
change will be added as an appendix to their joint by-laws. The bill
also clarifies the policy governing reserve funds of the student groups
and the release of the names of students who petition for special fees
refunds.
"It's a big bill. I find it surprising that we're not discussing this in
any way," said Will Seaton 'l3, expressing his disappointment as the
senators moved quickly toward a
vote at the end of the meeting with
out discussion.
Senate chair Michael Cruz *l2
then offered to outline the most im
portant components of the bill,
which was later passed unanimously.
One of the GSC's main com
plaints about the first version of the
bill "was that it wasn't a robust bill,"
Cruz said after the meeting. "Com
ing back to the drawing board, we
wanted to address all of the prob
lems in the special fees process."
Last night's bill will require ma
jority approval by the GSC.
Constitutional Council
The Senate discussed a bill co
sponsored by the Constitutional
Council to establish more codified
rules of order for the council, whose
members were present to discuss the
measure.
Previously, very little documenta
tion existed to determine the Coun
cil's structure, "to the really serious
detriment of the ASSU," said council
member Mateo Willmott 'll.
The aim is to make the Constitu
tional Council's work an "expedient,

efficient and really transparent
process," Willmott said.
"All of this is to the benefit of the
student" over the council, said coun
cil member J'vona Ivory 'll.

Other items of importance
The Senate also passed a bill to fi
nancially support Green Events
Consulting (GEC), a program
founded last year to encourage stu
dent groups to make their events
more sustainable. The Senate allo
cated $1,500 from its advocacy and
programming budget to GEC, an
amount that will be matched by the
ASSU Executive discretionary
fund, Cardona said. ASSU executive
chair of sustainability Theo Gibbs
'll heads Green Events Consulting.
On the agenda for next week is a
bill formalizing the transition
process from one Senate body to an
other, after the spring election. Car
dona also announced that she plans
to announce her nomination for
ASSU vice president, who will re
place Kelsei Wharton 'l2, at next
Tuesday's Senate meeting. Wharton
recently stepped down from his po
sition due to an injury.
Cardona's State of the Associa
tion speech will take place in the
eighth week of the quarter.
