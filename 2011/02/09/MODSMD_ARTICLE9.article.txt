# CRONA decries new hospital contract changes
## 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€” Ivy Nguyen 
Committee for Recognition of
Nursing Achievement (CRONA),
which represents 2,700 nurses at
Stanford Hospital and Clinics and
Lucile Packard Children's Hospi
tal, released a press release Tues
day condemning a decision by the
hospitals to impose a new employ
ment contract on the nurses.
"Stanford and Lucile Packard
Hospitals have decided to put cor
porate needs and greed ahead of

the welfare of their nurses, doctors
and patients by imposing these new
working conditions," Lorie John
son, president of CRONA, wrote in
the press release. "We believe the
imposition of these provisions is a
declaration of war on nurses and
could put patient care at risk at
both hospitals."
This development continues a
yearlong contract dispute between
CRONA and the hospitals, in which
both sides were unable to agree on
a new contract to replace the one
that expired last March. The debate
extended through late summer,
when the two sides reached a dead
lock that required the involvement
of a federal mediator.
Though the nurses voted on a
tentative agreement in December,
the majority of nurses rejected the
agreement, prompting CRONA to
inform the hospitals that it would
recommend a new tentative agree
ment if the proposal were changed.
In response, the hospitals declared
an "impasse" and implemented this
current contract.

CRONA will be meeting with
its member nurses this week to out

line its next steps, the press release
said.
